The latter shows the birth of [[Bheeshma]] and his oath and birth of Pandavas and Kauravas. The story then focuses on the childhood Lord Krishna and death of [[Kamsa]]. \n\nElsewhere, [[Dronacharya]] teaches Pandavas and Kauravas and asks to defeat Drupad as ''guru dakshina''. Pandavas do so and gives half of his kingdom to Drona. For revenge, Drupad obtains Dhrishthadhyumna and [[Draupadi]]. \n\nArjuna wins her in her ''swayamvara'' but latter shows her marriage with all five Pandavas. Later, [[Yudhishthir]] is made the king of Indraprashta and Pandavas conduct ''Rajsuya Yagna'' where Draupadi insults [[Duryodhana]]. Latter, shows Duryodhana's revenge by trying to disrobe her and sending Pandavas along with Draupadi for an exile of 13 years. This sows the seed for the Mahabharata War. \n\n[[Indra]] in disguise of a brahmin took Karna's armour and earrings. Krishna reveals Karna's true identity of being the eldest Pandava. \n\nBefore Mahabharata War, Shri Krishna enlightens Arjuna about ''Geeta'' and showed his ''Virata Swaroopa'' to Arjuna.  The latter shows the death of Bheeshma, Drona, Karna, 100 Kauravas in the war that lead to the victory of Pandavas over Kauravas. The show ends with Yudhistira's ''Rajyabhishek''.\n\n== Cast ==\n===Main===\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Nitish Bharadwaj]] as [[Shri Krishna]], Incarnation of Lord Vishnu/ Devaki-Vasudev's eighth son/ Foster

The latter shows the birth of [[Bheeshma]] and his oath and birth of Pandavas and Kauravas. The story then focuses on the childhood Lord Krishna and death of [[Kamsa]]. \n\nElsewhere, [[Dronacharya]] teaches Pandavas and Kauravas and asks to defeat Drupad as ''guru dakshina''. Pandavas do so and gives half of his kingdom to Drona. For revenge, Drupad obtains Dhrishthadhyumna and [[Draupadi]]. \n\nArjuna wins her in her ''swayamvara'' but latter shows her marriage with all five Pandavas. Later, [[Yudhishthir]] is made the king of Indraprashta and Pandavas conduct ''Rajsuya Yagna'' where Draupadi insults [[Duryodhana]]. Latter, shows Duryodhana's revenge by trying to disrobe her and sending Pandavas along with Draupadi for an exile of 13 years. This sows the seed for the Mahabharata War. \n\n[[Indra]] in disguise of a brahmin took Karna's armour and earrings. Krishna reveals Karna's true identity of being the eldest Pandava. \n\nBefore Mahabharata War, Shri Krishna enlightens Arjuna about ''Geeta'' and showed his ''Virata Swaroopa'' to Arjuna.  The latter shows the death of Bheeshma, Drona, Karna, 100 Kauravas in the war that lead to the victory of Pandavas over Kauravas. The show ends with Yudhistira's ''Rajyabhishek''.\n\n== Cast ==\n===Main===\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Nitish Bharadwaj]] as [[Shri Krishna]], Incarnation of Lord Vishnu/ Devaki-Vasudev's eighth son/ Foster

He played in [[Major League Baseball]] as primarily an [[outfielder]] from {{By|1963}} through {{By|1972}}, most notably as a member of the [[Baltimore Orioles]] dynasty that won three consecutive [[List of American League pennant winners|American League pennants]] from 1969 to 1971 and, won the [[World Series]] in 1970. He also played for the [[Chicago White Sox]] and played in the [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] league from 1973 to 1976. Buford also played as an [[infielder]] and was a switch hitter who threw right-handed.\n\n==College career==\nBuford was born in [[Linden, Texas]] and raised in [[Los Angeles, California]]. After graduating from [[Susan Miller Dorsey High School]], he played [[college baseball]] for the [[USC Trojans baseball]] team under legendary coach [[Rod Dedeaux]]. In 1958, he played on the Trojans' [[1958 College World Series|College World Series]] championship team with [[Ron Fairly]] and future baseball executive [[Pat Gillick]]. Buford was also a [[running back]] on the [[USC Trojans football|USC football]] team. His sons Don Buford, Jr. and [[Damon Buford]] also played for the [[USC Trojans]]. Buford is a member of [[Kappa Alpha Psi]] fraternity.\n\n==Professional career==\nIn his major league career, Buford batted .264 with 93 home runs, 418 RBIs, 718 runs scored and 200 stolen bases in 1286 [[games played]]. Primarily a leadoff hitter, he grounded into only 34 double plays during his big-league career (4553 [[at bats]]) and holds the Major League Record for the lowest [[GIDP]] rate, averaging one in every 138 at bats.  His career total is two fewer than [[Jim Rice]]'s single-season record of 36, set in 1984, and 316 fewer than [[Cal Ripken]]'s career record mark of 350 GIDP's. Note: A [[leadoff hitter]] faces less [[double play]] situations, but Buford did not lead off every game in his career.\n\n===Chicago White Sox===\nHe broke into the majors as an infielder who played both [[second baseman|second base]] and [[third baseman|third base]], becoming the White Sox\u2019 regular at the former position in 1965 (after sharing the position with [[Al Weis]] in 1964) and the latter in 1966. In the latter year, he [[stolen base|stole]] a career-high 51 bases (one fewer than the [[American League]] leader, [[Bert Campaneris]]) and led the AL in [[sacrifice hit]]s with 17, while establishing himself as one of the league's top [[Batting order (baseball)|leadoff hitters]].\n\nIn 1967 Buford and [[Ken Berry (baseball)|Ken Berry]] tied for the team lead with a .241 batting average on a White Sox team that battled the [[Boston Red Sox]], [[Detroit Tigers]] and [[Minnesota Twins]] for the American League pennant, which the Red Sox won on the final day of the regular season. The White Sox were eliminated from pennant contention (perhaps due, in large part, to faulty offense; they led the Majors with a 2.45 [[earned run average]], but batted only .225) in the final week of the season after losing a [[doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]] to the lowly [[Kansas City Athletics]] on September 27.\n\n===Baltimore Orioles===\nBuford was traded along with [[Bruce Howard (baseball)|Bruce Howard]] and [[Roger Nelson (baseball)|Roger Nelson]] to the [[Baltimore Orioles]] for [[Luis Aparicio]], [[Russ Snyder]] and [[John Matias]] on November 29, 1967.<ref>[https://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&context=de_November1967 \"Trade Shuffle Sends Aparicio To White Sox,\" ''The Associated Press'' (AP), Thursday, November 30, 1967.] (Scroll down to page 14.) Retrieved April 17, 2020</ref> In 1968 he [[batting average (baseball)|batted]] .282 with 15 home runs in a lineup that also featured the likes of [[Frank Robinson]], [[Brooks Robinson]], [[Boog Powell]], [[Davey Johnson]] and [[Paul Blair (baseball)|Paul Blair]]. In 1969 Buford hit a career-high .291 as the Orioles won the American League pennant. In the first game of the [[1969 World Series|World Series]] against the [[New York Mets]], Buford hit a leadoff home run against fellow ex-USC Trojan [[Tom Seaver]]\u2014the first-ever home run to lead off a World Series. ([[Dustin Pedroia]] and [[Alcides Escobar]] are the only other players to lead off a World Series with a home run, for the [[Boston Red Sox]] in [[2007 World Series|2007]] and the [[Kansas City Royals]] in [[2015 World Series|2015]], respectively.) Buford also drove in another run with a double as the Orioles won 4-1. However, he went 0-for-16 over the next four games, all won by the Mets for a seemingly impossible Series victory.\n\nIn 1970 Buford batted .272 with 17 home runs and a career high 109 [[base on balls|walks]]. The Orioles gained redemption in the [[1970 World Series|World Series]], which they won over the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in five games. Buford, playing in four of those games, went 4-for-15, including a home run in Game Three, which Baltimore won 9-3. In 1971 Buford batted .290 with a career-high 19 home runs. He was also selected to the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] team for the only time in his career. Again the Orioles went to the [[1971 World Series|World Series]]; this time, however, the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] defeated them in seven games. Buford collected six hits in this Series; two of them were home runs.\n\nIn each of the Orioles\u2019 three pennant-winning seasons Buford scored 99 [[Run (baseball)|runs]], leading the American League in that category in 1971.  Buford was the first Baltimore Oriole to homer from both sides of the plate in the same game. He accomplished this feat on April 9, 1970 in a 13-1 win over the [[Cleveland Indians]].  Buford also had the dubious distinction of being the first Oriole ever to [[strikeout|strike out]] five times in one game, on August 26, 1971.[http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/B08260BAL1971.htm] However, his Orioles defeated his former team, the [[Chicago White Sox]], 8&ndash;7.\n\n===Japan===\nAfter the 1971 season the Orioles played an exhibition series in Japan. After slumping to .206 in 1972 Buford returned to Japan, where he had been known as \"The Greatest Leadoff Man in the World\" during the Orioles\u2019 tour, to play professionally. In four seasons, from 1973 to 1976, he hit .270 with 65 home runs.\nIn 1973 and 1974 voted to top 9 Best Players in Japan. Played in All-Star Games receiving Honors.\n\n===Post retirement===\nIn 2006, Buford was the manager of the [[Daytona Cubs]] of the [[Florida State League]]. He had also served on [[Frank Robinson]]'s coaching staff with the Orioles, [[San Francisco Giants]] and [[Washington Nationals]]. Previously, he had front office and other minor league positions with the Orioles. Managed Rookie League Team (Bluefield). Managed A (Aberdeen, MD), managed high A (Frederick, MD), managed AA (Bowie), assistant farm director, farm director, all for the Orioles.\n\nBuford's son Damon Buford also played in the major leagues, playing with the Orioles, Mets, [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], [[Boston Red Sox]] and [[Chicago Cubs]] from 1993 to 2001. Buford's oldest son Don Buford, Jr. also played professional baseball in the Baltimore Orioles organization for four years. He is now an internationally recognized orthopedic surgeon specializing in sports medicine and shoulder surgery. Buford remains one of the most respected individuals to ever teach the game of baseball.  His number 9 was retired by the Daytona Cubs after the 2006 season.\n\nIn October, 2012 Don Buford, Sr. accepted a new position managing Major League Baseball's Urban Youth Academy in Compton, California. The academy focuses on baseball and softball training and education and is free to participants. He is now working on his own Community Organization, Educational Sports Institute which is based in Watts.\nIn 2008, Buford was inducted into the International League Triple A Hall of Fame.\nIn 2001, Buford was inducted into the USC Athletic Hall of Fame.\nIn 1993, Buford was inducted into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Major League Baseball annual runs scored leaders]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Baseballstats|mlb=|espn=|br=b/bufordo01|fangraphs=1001636|brm=buford002don}}, or [https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/b047570e SABR Biography Project], or [https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/B/Pbufod101.htm Retrosheet]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-sports}}\n{{succession box | title=[[Bowie Baysox|Bowie Baysox Manager]] | before=franchise created | years=1993| after= [[Pete Mackanin]]}}\n{{succession box | title=[[Baltimore Orioles|Baltimore Orioles Bench Coach]] | before=[[Jerry Narron]] | years=1994| after= [[Chuck Cottier]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{1958 USC Trojans baseball}}\n{{USC Trojans football rushing leaders navbox}}\n{{1970 Baltimore Orioles}}\n{{Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame}}\n{{Bowie Baysox managers}}\n{{2007\u201309 International League Hall of Fame}}\n{{IL MVPs}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Buford, Don}}\n[[Category:1937 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:African-American baseball coaches]]\n[[Category:African-American baseball players]]\n[[Category:American expatriate baseball players in Japan]]\n[[Category:American League All-Stars]]\n[[Category:Baltimore Orioles coaches]]\n[[Category:Baltimore Orioles executives]]\n[[Category:Baltimore Orioles players]]\n[[Category:Baseball players from Texas]]\n[[Category:Charleston White Sox players]]\n[[Category:Chicago White Sox players]]\n[[Category:Indianapolis Indians players]]\n[[Category:International League MVP award winners]]\n[[Category:Lincoln Chiefs players]]\n[[Category:Lynchburg White Sox players]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball bench coaches]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball farm directors]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball first base coaches]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball infielders]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball left fielders]]\n[[Category:Milwaukee Brewers scouts]]\n[[Category:Minor league baseball managers]]\n[[Category:Nankai Hawks players]]\n[[Category:People from Linden, Texas]]\n[[Category:Rapi\u00f1os de Occidente players]]\n[[Category:San Diego Padres (minor league) players]]\n[[Category:San Francisco Giants coaches]]\n[[Category:Savannah White Sox players]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Taiheiyo Club Lions players]]\n[[Category:USC Trojans baseball players]]\n[[Category:USC Trojans football players]]\n[[Category:Washington Nationals coaches]]\n[[Category:Susan Miller Dorsey High School alumni]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox baseball biography\n|name=Don Buford\n|image=Don Buford (14864708795).jpg\n|caption=Buford in 2014\n|position=[[Left fielder]] / [[Second baseman]] / [[Third baseman]]\n|birth_date={{birth date and age|1937|2|2}}\n|birth_place=[[Linden, Texas]]\n|bats=Switch\n|throws=Right\n|debutleague = MLB\n|debutdate=September 14\n|debutyear=1963\n|debutteam=Chicago White Sox \n|finalleague = MLB\n|finaldate=October 3\n|finalyear=1972\n|finalteam=Baltimore Orioles\n|statleague = MLB\n|stat1label=[[Batting average (baseball)|Batting average]]\n|stat1value=.264\n|stat2label=[[Home run]]s\n|stat2value=93\n|stat3label=[[Runs batted in]]\n|stat3value=418\n|teams=\n* [[Chicago White Sox]] ({{mlby|1963}}\u2013{{mlby|1967}})\n* [[Baltimore Orioles]] ({{mlby|1968}}\u2013{{mlby|1972}})\n* [[Taiheiyo Club Lions]] ({{Baseball year|1973}}\u2013{{Baseball year|1975}})\n* [[Nankai Hawks]] ({{Baseball year|1976}})\n|highlights=\n* [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] ([[1971 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1971]])\n* [[World Series]] champion ({{wsy|1970}})\n* [[Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame]]\n}}\n'''Donald Alvin Buford''' (born February 2, 1937) is an American former professional [[baseball]] player [[Scout (sport)|scout]] and [[coach (baseball)|coach]].
