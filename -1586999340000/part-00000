He became a naturalized American citizen in 1873.\n\n==Early years==\nLeopoldo Carrillo was born on May 24, 1836, in [[Moctezuma, Sonora]] (previously known as Oposura) as the illegitimate son of Luis Carrillo and Dona Maria Martines.{{sfn|Scrivner|2006|p=120}} Luis Carrillo was a Spanish soldier and Dona Maria Martines was half [[Opata]]. Leopoldo had two younger brothers, Francisco and Procopio, and an older sister named Teodosia. He had another relative named Emilio, but it is not known whether he was a brother or a cousin. The latter is likely as Leopoldo referred to him as \"primo\", the Spanish word for cousin.\n\nLeopoldo Carrillo had no formal education, teaching himself how to read, write and speak Spanish, English and the [[Opata language]]. He had humble beginnings selling bottles on the streets to pay for his lessons. This would lead him to becoming a strong supporter of the establishment of Tucson School District #1.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Leopoldo_Carrillo_family.png|thumb|left|Back row: Unknown, Unknown, Luis, Arturo, Matilde, Leopoldo Sr., Leopoldo Jr. Front Row: Unknown. Joaquin c. 1878]]\n\n[[File:Leopoldo Carrillo and his wife Jesusita Suarez.jpg|thumb|right|Jesusita Suarez, Leopoldo Carrillo's first wife]]\n\nLeopoldo Carrillo married Jesusita Suarez on August 21, 1865 in [[Magdalena de Kino Municipality|Magdalena, Mexico]]. Jesusita's sister, Elvira Suarez de Carrillo, moved into the household. Along with hired servants, she helped to look after his large family of nine children.\n\nAfter fifteen years of marriage, Jesusita died on June 28, 1880 at the age of 33. She had given birth to Mortimer Carrillo two days earlier, but the baby did not survive either. As it was improper for an unmarried woman to be living with a widower, Leopoldo married Elvira on September 6, 1880, who helped to raise his children who at the time were from ages two to thirteen.\n\nLeopoldo's success as a businessman allowed for his children to live off most of his earnings. Carrillo was able to afford Leopoldo Jr.'s education at [[Santa Clara College]] in [[Berkeley, California]]. Leopoldo Jr. claimed that he did not need to work as a result of his father's success.\n\n===Gambling===\nLeopoldo Carrillo was very fond of [[gambling]]. Among the games he played were [[poker]] and [[Monte Bank|Monte]], the latter of which is a [[card game]] with origins in [[Spain]]. He reportedly won furniture such as a large mirror from these games,{{sfn|Richards|2005|p=13}} but he was very cautious about gambling debts. He would often put his property under his wife Jesusita's name to minimize his losses. One of his brothers, who owned the key to Leopoldo's safe, would not allow him to gamble if his losses were too great.\n\n==Career==\nLeopoldo Carrillo had a very successful career as an entrepreneur. However, it was not without obstacles. The events of his career were contemporaneous to major civil conflicts such as the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Mexican Revolution]]. In addition to raids by Native Americans, Tucson and the surrounding area was particularly unstable.\n===As a freighter operator===\nIn 1859, Carrillo ventured to the town of Tucson, Arizona which at the time was a government outpost on the verge of exponential growth. As a visionary, he saw the potential for the town's growth via mass transit and was key to getting the railroad through Tucson. Owning a farm near [[Fort Lowell]], he was one of the first members of the Arizona Pioneer Society. As an entrepreneur, he set about to establish numerous facilities in Tucson. His experience as a freighter during the American Civil War and as a supporter of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] gave him national recognition leading to his sudden rise in success. The freight business extended all the way from Sonora to Tucson and to [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. From there, goods were exported all the way to [[China]] and other Asian countries.\n\n===Livestock raiding===\nIn 1869, a raiding party of Native Americans stole from Carrillo's cattle by herding them away from his ranch near [[Mission San Xavier del Bac|San Xavier]]. Leopoldo retaliated by amassing a large group of approximately 50 bronco horses. He led them to recapture the entirety of his missing livestock in addition to capturing four horses from the Native Americans.{{sfn|Indians|1869|1}}\n\n===Kidnapping===\nDuring August 1875, Leopoldo was accused of providing guns to Mexican revolutionists despite him being in Canoa, Arizona at the time.{{sf|Richards|2005|p=11}} Several days later, he was captured by a Mexican rebel named Don Jose Maria Escalante in an effort to obtain his money. A community effort was made to raise enough money to pay the ransom, but Escalante raised the amount from $5,000 to $7,000 in addition to all of Carrillo's cattle from his [[hacienda]]. Even after delivering the money, Escalante still threatened to kill Carrillo anyway. \n\nThough Leopoldo prepared a plan for his family to recover his corpse should the ransom deal fail, he managed to escape on his own. He fled to the mountains disguising himself as a Native American through his dark skin and knowledge of the Opata language. After Carrillo escaped, a friend of his named Juan Bojorquez provided him with a horse to allow him to return to Tucson. They reunited with Jesusita who was accompanied by five other men armed with rifles. After this event, Leopoldo never celebrated the [[Mexican Independence Day]] again.{{sf|Richards|2005|p=12}}\n\nAfter Carrillo's kidnapping, the [[Arizona Citizen]] brought attention to the national level with a series of recollections about the event. They accused the government of [[Sonora]] of conspiracy and corruption holding them responsible for the attempt on Carrillo's life and the theft of $20,000.{{sfn|Troops on Our Southern Border|1875|p=1}} Translating to 2018 inflation, the total losses equated to approximately $458,000.{{sfn|CPI Inflation Calculator}}\n\n[[File:Portrait_of_Jesusita_Suarez.jpg|thumb|left|Jesusita Suarez was instrumental in raising enough money to pay the ransom]]\n===As a property manager===\nLeopoldo Carrillo built numerous establishments in Tucson. By 1881, he had owned more than 100 buildings. Among them included a ten pin bowling alley and a piano parlor used by the Tucson Glee Club.{{sfn|Tucson Glee Club|1869|p=1}} He also commissioned the construction of the city's first two-story building, and built the town's first ice cream parlor{{sfn|Richards|2005|p=26}} which was unique in that it also served wine with it. He published music and was a musician himself.\n===Carrillo's Gardens===\nPerhaps his largest project was known as Carrillo's Gardens located just southwest of the main Tucson area. Built in 1885, it became the city's first free public park.{{sf|Richards|2005|p=15}} Across eight acres, a variety of different fruit trees were planted, and numerous artificial lakes and ponds were constructed. These bodies of water were host to bathhouses and boat rides. The large presence of spring water which is scarce elsewhere in Arizona made the area very popular to the public. The park became home to many activities and facilities from restaurants to a menagerie. The park was also home to the private school known as Carrillo School. Though Carrillo's Gardens no longer exists, the land is used today by the Carrillo Intermediate Magnet School.\n\n==Political beliefs==\nLeopoldo Carrillo strongly associated himself with [[capitalism]]. As the founder of the Mexican Republican Party in Arizona, Carrillo was very active in politics. He was a strong supporter of the Union during the American Civil War, and closely followed the career of [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]], the first Republican candidate for president. He also supported [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s campaign for presidency and the [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement. Leopoldo Carrillo was often a featured speaker at most Republican party rallies.\n\nWhile no evidence has been found, it is possible Leopoldo Carrillo served in the Union forces as at the time, Arizona was considered a part of the [[New Mexico]] territory. He would have served with the New Mexico regiments.\n\n==Death==\nCarrillo died of [[tuberculosis]] at 2 AM in his home at age 54 on December 9, 1890, in [[Pima County]] in Tucson, Arizona. The Arizona Pioneer Society conducted his funeral at the Holy Hope Cemetery and Mausoleum while praising him for his accomplishments. Carrillo had over 300 descendants.{{sfn|Auslander|1977|p=3}} many to this day still living in Tucson.\n==Legacy==\nLeopoldo Carrillo was well regarded for his honest gentlemanly demeanor. As one of the first major developers of Tucson, he was widely praised for his work for the community. After 87 years, the Carrillo homestead was converted into a museum in 1972 which remains open to the public to this day.\n\nThe [[Arizona Citizen]] described Carrillo's horse stable the best in Arizona. The [[Arizona Daily Star]] described him as someone always building and renovating.{{sfn|Scrivner|2006|p=121}} On October 16, 1977, they published an article to invite locals to join in a gathering to commemorate the Carrillo family.\n\nThe Arizona Historical Society keeps thoroughly documented records of letters, articles and photographs related to the Carrillo family which are available for public viewing.\n\n==Paranormal activity==\nVisitors to the Carrillo household have reported sightings of paranormal entities. These include happy teenage girls in the Sosa Bedroom, a woman in the large pier mirror in the zaguan (foyer), and a woman in pain, crying and clutching her stomach. The latter is believed to be Leopoldo's second wife Elvira Suarez de Carrillo who died of stomach cancer. These paranormal events have drawn interest to the museum as it is regarded that the Carrillo family and their relatives benevolently enjoy themselves in the presence of visitors to their home.{{sfn|Richards|2005|p=18}}\n==See also==\n*[[Arizona Historical Society]]\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite news |last= Auslander|first= Edith Sayre|date= October 16, 1977|title= Pioneer Family: 'Pachanga' will pay tribute to Carrillos|publisher=  Arizona Daily Star|ref=harv}} \n*{{cite book |last= Richards|first= Bette Bunker|date= 2005|title= Don Leopoldo Carrillo: Tucson Pioneer|url= |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn= |author-link=|ref=harv }}\n*{{cite news |author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Indians|url= |work= Weekly Arizonian|location= |date= September 4, 1869|access-date= }} \n*{{cite book |last= Scrivner|first= A.V.|date= 2006|title= Valiant Southwest|url= |location= Tucson, AZ|publisher= Gala Text|page= |isbn= 1887116133|author-link=|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite news |author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Troops on Our Southern Border|url= |work= Arizona Citizen|location= |date= September 11, 1875|access-date= }} \n*{{cite news |author= <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Tucson Glee Club|url= |work=  Weekly Arizonian|location= |date= September 7, 1869|access-date= }} \n*{{cite web |url= http://www.in2013dollars.com/1875-dollars-in-2018?amount=20000 |title= CPI Inflation Calculator|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= August 9, 2018|quote=In other words, $20,000 in 1875 is equivalent in purchasing power to $458,161.82 in 2018, a difference of $438,161.82 over 143 years.}}\n==External links==\n*[http://arizonahistoricalsociety.org/ Arizona Historical Society]\n*[https://www.niche.com/k12/carrillo-intermediate-magnet-school-tucson-az/ Carrillo Intermediate Magnet School] - A school named after Leopoldo Carrillo\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carrillo, Leopoldo}}\n[[Category:1836 births]]\n[[Category:1890 deaths]]\n[[Category:19th-century American businesspeople]]\n[[Category:19th-century American politicians]]\n[[Category:American abolitionists]]\n[[Category:American people of Mexican descent]]\n[[Category:History of Tucson, Arizona]]\n[[Category:People from Sonora]]\n[[Category:Arizona Republicans]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|entrepreneur}}{{Infobox person\n| name          =  Leopoldo Carrillo\n| image         = Leopoldo_Carrillo.jpg\n| alt           = Leopoldo Carrillo\n| caption       = A photograph of Leopoldo Carrillo, courtesy of the [[Arizona Historical Society]]\n| birth_date    = {{Birth date|1836|05|24}}\n| birth_place   = [[Moctezuma, Sonora]]\n| death_date    = {{Death date and age|1890|12|09|1836|05|24}}\n| death_place   = [[Tucson, Arizona]]\n| nationality   = Mexican-American\n| other_names   = \n| occupation    = Entrepreneur\n| years_active  = \n| known_for     = Pioneer in Tucson\n| notable_works = Carrillo's Gardens\n| party        = [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]\n| parents = Luis Carrillo, Dona Maria Martines\n| children = 10\n| spouses = Jesusita Suarez, Elvira Suarez de Carrillo\n}}\n\n{{Distinguish|Leo Carrillo}}\n\n'''Don Leopoldo Carrillo''' (May 24, 1836 \u2013 December 9, 1890) was a Mexican-American entrepreneur and one of the earliest pioneers of [[Tucson, Arizona]].

A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Biden is the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|presumptive Democratic nominee]] for [[President of the United States|president]] in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 election]]. He unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in [[Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign|1988]] and in [[Joe Biden 2008 presidential campaign|2008]]. \n\nBiden was raised in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], and [[New Castle County, Delaware]]. He studied at the [[University of Delaware]] before receiving his law degree from [[Syracuse University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joe-Biden|title=Joe Biden &#124; Biography & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> He became a lawyer in 1969 and was elected to the [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle]] [[County Council]] in 1970. He was [[1972 United States Senate election in Delaware|elected]] to the [[List of United States senators from Delaware|U.S. Senate from Delaware]] in 1972 when he became the sixth-youngest senator in American history. Biden was reelected six times and was the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|fourth-most senior senator]] when he resigned to assume the vice presidency in 2009.\n\nAs a senator, Biden was a longtime member and eventually chairman of the [[Foreign Relations Committee]]. He opposed the [[Gulf War]] in 1991 but advocated for U.S. and [[NATO]] intervention in the [[Bosnian War]] in 1994 and 1995, expanding NATO in the 1990s, and the 1999 bombing of [[Serbia]] during the [[Kosovo War]]. He argued and voted for the [[Iraq War Resolution|resolution authorizing the Iraq War]] in 2002 but opposed the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge of U.S. troops]] in 2007. He has also served as chairman of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, as well as the contentious [[U.S. Supreme Court]] nominations of [[Robert Bork]] and [[Clarence Thomas]]. Biden led the efforts to pass the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] and the [[Violence Against Women Act]].\n\nIn [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]], Biden was the [[running mate]] of Democratic presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]]. As vice president, he oversaw [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009#Infrastructure Investment|infrastructure spending]] to counteract the [[Great Recession]] and helped formulate U.S. policy toward [[Iraq]] through the [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)#Full withdrawal (2011)|withdrawal of U.S. troops in 2011]]. His negotiations with congressional [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] helped the Obama administration pass legislation including the [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]], which resolved a taxation deadlock; the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]], which resolved that year's [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|debt ceiling crisis]]; and the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]], which addressed the impending [[United States fiscal cliff|fiscal cliff]]. Obama and Biden were [[2012 United States presidential election|reelected in 2012]].\n\nIn October 2015, after months of speculation, Biden announced he would not seek the presidency in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]]. In January 2017, Obama awarded Biden the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] with distinction.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/us/politics/joe-biden-presidential-medal-freedom.html|title=Obama Surprises Joe Biden With Presidential Medal of Freedom|last=Shear|first=Michael D.|date=January 12, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 24, 2018|language=en}}</ref> After completing his second term as vice president, Biden joined the faculty of the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he was named the [[Benjamin Franklin]] Professor of Presidential Practice.<ref name=\"BidenUPenn\">{{cite news |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-has-a-new-job-2017-2 |title=Here's what Joe Biden will do after 8 years as vice president |last=Berke |first=Jeremy |date=February 7, 2017 |website=Business Insider |access-date=February 8, 2017 |quote=}}</ref> He announced his [[Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign|2020 candidacy for president]] on April 25, 2019, joining a large [[2020 Democratic Party presidential candidates|field of Democratic candidates]] pursuing the party nomination.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/us/politics/biden-2020.html|title=Joe Biden's 2020 Plan Is Almost Complete.

He said Republicans were using busing as a scare tactic to court Southern white votes, and along with Boggs voiced opposition to a [[House of Representatives]] constitutional amendment banning busing.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|page=214}} In 1974, Biden voted to table an amendment to an omnibus education bill promoted by [[Edward Gurney]] (R-FL) that contained anti-busing measures and anti-school desegregation clauses.

Biden spoke to the auditorium and said his position on school busing was evolving, emphasizing that busing in Delaware was in his opinion beyond court restrictions. The crowd was unconvinced, and heckled him until he yielded the microphone.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=2\u20133}} This, along with the prospect of a busing plan in Wilmington, led Biden to align himself with civil rights opponent Senator [[Jesse Helms]] (R-NC) in opposing busing.

A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Biden is the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|presumptive Democratic nominee]] for [[President of the United States|president]] in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 election]]. He unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in [[Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign|1988]] and in [[Joe Biden 2008 presidential campaign|2008]]. \n\nBiden was raised in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], and [[New Castle County, Delaware]]. He studied at the [[University of Delaware]] before receiving his law degree from [[Syracuse University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joe-Biden|title=Joe Biden &#124; Biography & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> He became a lawyer in 1969 and was elected to the [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle]] [[County Council]] in 1970. He was [[1972 United States Senate election in Delaware|elected]] to the [[List of United States senators from Delaware|U.S. Senate from Delaware]] in 1972 when he became the sixth-youngest senator in American history. Biden was reelected six times and was the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|fourth-most senior senator]] when he resigned to assume the vice presidency in 2009.\n\nAs a senator, Biden was a longtime member and eventually chairman of the [[Foreign Relations Committee]]. He opposed the [[Gulf War]] in 1991 but advocated for U.S. and [[NATO]] intervention in the [[Bosnian War]] in 1994 and 1995, expanding NATO in the 1990s, and the 1999 bombing of [[Serbia]] during the [[Kosovo War]]. He argued and voted for the [[Iraq War Resolution|resolution authorizing the Iraq War]] in 2002 but opposed the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge of U.S. troops]] in 2007. He has also served as chairman of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, as well as the contentious [[U.S. Supreme Court]] nominations of [[Robert Bork]] and [[Clarence Thomas]]. Biden led the efforts to pass the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] and the [[Violence Against Women Act]].\n\nIn [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]], Biden was the [[running mate]] of Democratic presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]]. As vice president, he oversaw [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009#Infrastructure Investment|infrastructure spending]] to counteract the [[Great Recession]] and helped formulate U.S. policy toward [[Iraq]] through the [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)#Full withdrawal (2011)|withdrawal of U.S. troops in 2011]]. His negotiations with congressional [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] helped the Obama administration pass legislation including the [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]], which resolved a taxation deadlock; the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]], which resolved that year's [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|debt ceiling crisis]]; and the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]], which addressed the impending [[United States fiscal cliff|fiscal cliff]]. Obama and Biden were [[2012 United States presidential election|reelected in 2012]].\n\nIn October 2015, after months of speculation, Biden announced he would not seek the presidency in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]]. In January 2017, Obama awarded Biden the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] with distinction.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/us/politics/joe-biden-presidential-medal-freedom.html|title=Obama Surprises Joe Biden With Presidential Medal of Freedom|last=Shear|first=Michael D.|date=January 12, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 24, 2018|language=en}}</ref> After completing his second term as vice president, Biden joined the faculty of the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he was named the [[Benjamin Franklin]] Professor of Presidential Practice.<ref name=\"BidenUPenn\">{{cite news |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-has-a-new-job-2017-2 |title=Here's what Joe Biden will do after 8 years as vice president |last=Berke |first=Jeremy |date=February 7, 2017 |website=Business Insider |access-date=February 8, 2017 |quote=}}</ref> He announced his [[Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign|2020 candidacy for president]] on April 25, 2019, joining a large [[2020 Democratic Party presidential candidates|field of Democratic candidates]] pursuing the party nomination.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/us/politics/biden-2020.html|title=Joe Biden's 2020 Plan Is Almost Complete.

He has been cited as one of the greatest heavy metal bassists.\n\nOn 24 September 2012, Harris released his debut solo album, ''[[British Lion (Band)|British Lion]]'', which was followed on the 17 January 2020 by ''[[The Burning (British Lion album)|The Burning]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nHarris was born at [[Whipps Cross University Hospital]] in [[London Borough of Waltham Forest]] and grew up in [[Leytonstone]where he was aspiring to be a professional [[Association football|footballer]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=15}} Scouted by [[Wally St Pier]], Harris was asked to train for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=17}} After gaining an interest in rock music in his early teens, he realised that he no longer desired to play football professionally.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=17}} \n\nInitially Harris wanted to play drums,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=20}} but did not have enough space for a drum kit in his house and so decided on the bass instead.<ref name=\"earlydaysdvd\">{{cite video|date= 23 November 2004|title=[[The History of Iron Maiden \u2013 Part 1: The Early Days]]|medium=DVD|publisher=[[EMI]]}}</ref> Entirely self-taught,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ironmaiden.com/index.php?categoryid=14&p2_articleid=329 | title = Steve Harris as known by Janick Gers | accessdate = 11 February 2012 | publisher = Iron Maiden Official Website | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100819095537/http://www.ironmaiden.com/index.php?categoryid=14&p2_articleid=329 | archivedate = 19 August 2010 | last = Gers | first = Janick|authorlink=Janick Gers}}</ref> his first bass was a copy of a [[Fender Precision Bass|Fender Precision model]] which cost him \u00a340 in 1971.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=20}}\n\nJust 10 months after he bought his first bass, Harris joined a band, initially known as Influence and later Gypsy's Kiss, featuring Bob Verscoyle (lead vocals), Dave Smith (guitar) and drummer Paul Sears.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=21}} After a short number of gigs at the Cart and Horses pub in Maryland Point, Stratford and the Bridgehouse in Canning Town,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=23}} the band split up and Harris auditioned for a band called Smiler in February 1974.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=24}} In this outfit, Harris began writing his own songs and worked with future Iron Maiden members Dennis Wilcock and [[Doug Sampson]],{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=25}} but left the band after they refused to play his material, claiming it was too complicated.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=26}}\n\n==Career==\n\n===Iron Maiden===\n{{Main|Iron Maiden}}\n\nUpon leaving Smiler, Harris went on to create Iron Maiden on Christmas Day 1975,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=26}} with the band's name being inspired by the film ''[[The Man in the Iron Mask (1939 film)|The Man in the Iron Mask]]''.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=28}} Before Iron Maiden signed their contract with [[EMI]] in 1979, Harris worked as an [[Architecture|architectural]] [[technical drawing|draughtsman]] in the [[East End of London]] (he had studied architectural drawing at [[Leyton Sixth Form College]]){{cn|date=April 2019}} until he was made redundant, at which point he undertook a job as a [[street sweeper]].<ref name=\"MH 30th\">{{cite journal | title = Powerslave Driver | journal = Metal Hammer Presents: Iron Maiden 30 Years of Metal Mayhem | year = 2005 | first = Dave | last = Ling | pages = 31\u201334| id = }}</ref>{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=114}}\n\nSince their inception, Harris has been the band's principal composer and lyricist.<ref name=\"musicradar\"/> His song writing typically showcases his trademark galloping bass patterns, which features heavily in songs such as \"[[The Trooper]]\" and \"[[Run to the Hills]]\",<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r9912|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Piece of Mind'' \u2013 Review|accessdate=19 November 2011|first=Steve|last=Huey|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|work=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title= 666 of the Best |journal= [[Kerrang!|Kerrang!

As with many of these volunteers, initially, there were not enough [[Model 1861 Springfield Rifle|Model 1861 Springfield Rifles]] to go around so they were instead issued imported [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|British Pattern 1853 rifles]]. These were the standard rifle for the British army having performed well in the [[Crimean War]]. The Enfield was a was a .577 calibre [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Mini\u00e9-type]] muzzle-loading [[rifled musket]]. It was used by both armies and was the second most widely used infantry weapon in the Union forces.\n\nAt Gettysburg, on the evening of 3 July, General Birney wanted to standardize the weapons in his division<ref name=\"Houghton\" />. That evening, he had the 17th and other Enfield-equipped units in his command exchange their arms for the standard muzzle-loading rifled musket of the Union Army, the [[Springfield Model 1861]] Rifled Musket. It fired a .58 inch [[Minie Ball.]] and came with a square socket bayonet.

Jeff Dionne and Kenneth Albanowski in 1998. Initially, they targeted the Motorola [[Freescale DragonBall|DragonBall]] family of embedded [[68k]] processors (specifically the 68EZ328 series used in the Motorola PalmPilot) on a 2.0.33 Linux kernel. After releasing their initial work, a developer community quickly sprang up extending their work to newer kernels and other microprocessor architectures. In early 1999, support was added for the Motorola (now Freescale) [[Freescale ColdFire|ColdFire]] family of embedded microprocessors. [[ARM architecture|ARM]] processor support was added later.\n\nAlthough originally targeting 2.0 series Linux kernels, it now has ports based on Linux 2.4 and Linux 2.6. The Linux 2.4 ports were forward ported from the 2.0.36 Linux kernel by Michael Leslie and Evan Stawnyczy during their work at Rt-Control. There were never any \u03bcClinux extensions applied to the 2.2 series kernels.\n\nSince version 2.5.46 of the Linux kernel, the major parts of \u03bcClinux have been integrated with the mainline kernel for a number of processor architectures.<ref>Miles Gillham [https://www.linux.com/news/uclinux-and-linux-set-merge \"uClinux and Linux set to merge\"], ''[[Linux.com]]'', November 19, 2002.</ref> \n\nGreg Ungerer (who originally ported \u03bcClinux to the Motorola ColdFire family of processors) continued to maintain and actively push core \u03bcClinux support into the 2.6 series Linux kernels. In this regard, \u03bcClinux is essentially no longer a separate fork of Linux.\n\n\u03bcClinux had support for many architectures, and forms the basis of many products, like [[Router (computing)|network routers]], security cameras, [[DVD player|DVD]] or [[Digital audio player|MP3 players]], [[Voice over Internet Protocol|VoIP]] phone or gateways, [[Image scanner|scanners]], and card readers.\n\nSupport for several of the original target architectures was dropped in 2018.<ref>Linus Torvalds [https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/4/15/201 \"Linux 4.17-rc1\"], ''[[LKML.ORG]]'', 15 April 2018.</ref> The obsolete CPU architectures set to be removed in Linux 4.17 and subsequent releases included ADI Blackfin, Etrax CRIS, Fujitsu FR-V, Mitsubishi M32R, Matsushita/Panasonic MN10300, Imagination META (Metag), and Tilera TILE.<ref>Jonathan Corbet [https://lwn.net/Articles/748074 \"Shedding old architectures and compilers in the kernel\"], ''[[LWN.net]]'', February 26, 2018.</ref>\n\n== Supported architectures ==\nThe current list includes:\n* [[Altera]] [[Nios embedded processor|Nios]]/[[Nios II]]\n* [[Amber (processor core)|Amber]] (open FPGA core)\n* [[ARM architecture|ARM]] [[ARM7TDMI]], [[ARM Cortex-M|ARM Cortex-M3/M4/M7]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Linux for ARM\u00ae Processors www.arm.com Summer/Winter 2013 Robert Boys bob.boys@arm.com System Design Division, ARM |date=2013-09-10 |accessdate=2014-07-17 |url=http://www.sase.com.ar/2013/files/2013/09/SASE2013-Linux-BobBoys.pdf |quote=What about Cortex-M and Cortex-R ? /../ These can run a modified version of Linux called uClinux.}}</ref> [[ARM Cortex-R]]\n* [[Lattice Semiconductor|Lattice]] [[LatticeMico32|Mico32]]\n* [[NXP]] [[Motorola 68000 series|680x0]] (Motorola/Freescale 680x0)\n* [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] [[H8 Family|H8]]\n* [[Hyperstone]] E1/E2 (called hyLinux)\n* [[Intel i960]]\n* [[MIPS Technologies|MIPS]]\n* [[NXP ColdFire]] (Motorola/Freescale ColdFire)\n* [[NEC]] [[NEC V850E|V850E]]\n* [[Xilinx]] [[MicroBlaze]]\n\n=== No longer supported ===\nBefore Linux 4.17 the following architectures were also supported<ref> {{cite web |url=http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1804.0/00306.html |title=[GIT PULL] arch: remove obsolete architecture ports}}</ref>:\n* [[Analog Devices|ADI]] [[Blackfin]]\n* [[Axis Communications|Axis]] [[ETRAX CRIS|ETRAX]]\n* [[Fujitsu]] [[FR-V]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113230737/http://www.uclinux.org/ |title=Official website}}\n*{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113230737/http://www.uclinux.org/pub/uClinux/dist/ |title=\u03bcClinux-dist, complete source distribution package}}\n* [http://sf.net/projects/uclinux/files/ \u03bcClinux at SourceForge]\n* {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324024708/http://retired.beyondlogic.org/uClinux/uClinux.htm |title=\u03bcClinux - Setting up the Development Environment}}\n* [https://github.com/AcceleratedLinux/accelerated-linux Accelerated-Linux], an actively developed continuation of \u03bcClinux-dist\n\n{{Linux kernel}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:UClinux}}\n[[Category:Embedded operating systems]]\n[[Category:Embedded Linux]]\n[[Category:Lightweight Unix-like systems]]\n[[Category:ARM operating systems]]\n[[Category:Linux kernel]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=December 2011}}\n{{lowercase|\u03bcClinux}}\n{{Infobox OS\n| name = \u03bcClinux\n| logo = \n| screenshot = Ipod linux booting kernel.jpg\n| caption = An [[iPod classic|iPod]] booting [[iPodLinux]], based on \u03bcClinux\n| website = {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113230737/http://www.uclinux.org/ |title=uclinux.org}}\n| family = [[Embedded Linux]]\n| source_model = [[Open-source software|Open source]]\n| latest_release_version = \n| latest_release_date = {{Start date and age|2014|5|4}}\n| kernel_type = [[Linux kernel]]-fork\n| userland = uClinux-dist, [[uClibc]], [[BusyBox]]\n| license = \n| working_state = Current\n| supported_platforms = See [[\u03bcClinux#Supported architectures|below]]\n}}\n[[File:Linux kernel System Call Interface and uClibc.svg|thumb|300px|[[uClibc]] is a wrapper around the [[system call]]s of the [[Linux kernel]] and/or \u03bcClinux.]]\n\n'''\u03bcClinux''' is a variation of the [[Linux (kernel)|Linux kernel]], previously maintained as a [[Fork (software development)|fork]], that targets [[microcontroller]]s without a [[memory management unit]] (MMU).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uclinux.org/description/|title=uClinux Description|accessdate=2007-12-31|author=D.

It was written by [[Sezen Aksu]], with music credited as composed by Tarkan. However, Tarkan later admitted in a 2006 interview that this had been done without Aksu's consent, who was the true copyright owner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tarkandeluxe.blogspot.com/2006/03/tarkan-confesses.html |title=Tarkan Deluxe: Tarkan Confesses |publisher=Tarkandeluxe.blogspot.com |date=2006-03-30 |accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref> It formed part of Tarkan's album ''[[\u00d6l\u00fcr\u00fcm Sana (album)|\u00d6l\u00fcr\u00fcm Sana]]''. \"\u015e\u0131mar\u0131k\" was released in [[France]] in 1998 and the rest of the world in 1999, from the [[compilation album]] ''Tarkan'', which was released in [[Europe]]. It has sold two million copies all across Europe. Many versions of the song were recorded in different languages, most notably the English-language cover, titled \"Kiss Kiss\", by [[Greece|Greek]]-[[United States|American]] singer [[Stella Soleil]] in 2001 which was itself covered by [[Australia]]n actress [[Holly Valance]] in 2002.\n\n==The song==\nAs Tarkan's first major single, the song is generally considered his debut single. He had released three albums before this, but never released a song in single format due to the album-orientated nature of the Turkish music industry. The song has also appeared in soundtracks of various movies, including French film ''[[Beau travail]]'' and the American film ''[[XX/XY]]''. It is generally considered Tarkan's signature song in Europe. Its chorus ends with two characteristic [[kiss]] sounds.\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]] is shot in Marseille, France with narrow streets and cobbled roads, with Tarkan [[singing]] and [[jaywalking]]. Several females on the streets see him and start following him to try to [[kiss]] him, but he tries to avoid them by first changing direction and then later by walking faster. More and more women begin to follow him as the song proceeds, but Tarkan eventually starts running in order to avoid them. A big group of women then run after him and as the song finishes, Tarkan takes cover in a street corner. A young girl is there as well and Tarkan kisses her [[forehead]].\n\n==Track listings==\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = Single versions\n| width     = 120\n| image1    = S1 simariklp promo.JPG\n| alt1      =\n| image2    = Lpsimarik 1.JPG\n| alt2      =\n| image3    = Lp simarik3.jpg\n| alt3      =\n}}\n* ''\u015e\u0131mar\u0131k'', 1999\n# \u015e\u0131mar\u0131k Malagutti (4:46)\n# \u015e\u0131mar\u0131k Malagutti edit remix (3:17)\n# \u015e\u0131mar\u0131k Malagutti extended remix (7:00)\n# \u015e\u0131mar\u0131k Ned Divine edit remix (3:13)\n# \u015e\u0131mar\u0131k Ned Divine extended remix (5:56)\n# \u015e\u0131mar\u0131k radio edit(3:12)\n# \u015e\u0131mar\u0131k long (original) version (3:55)\n# \u015e\u0131mar\u0131k Or\u0131ental (4:05)\n# \u015e\u0131mar\u0131k Z\u0131o dub extended remix (6:11)\n# \u015e\u0131mar\u0131k Z\u0131o dub edit remix\n# \u015e\u0131mar\u0131k \u015e\u0131nan soulful (6:14)\n# \u015e\u0131mar\u0131k \u015e\u0131nan dub\nTrack lists to this CD single change depending on the country of release, e.g. [[United States|America]] and Germany.\n\nThere were four promotional [[Vinyl LP|LP]] versions released.\nA promotional CD single was released in France, with an orange cover.

It was written by [[Sezen Aksu]], with music credited as composed by Tarkan. However, Tarkan later admitted in a 2006 interview that this had been done without Aksu's consent, who was the true copyright owner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tarkandeluxe.blogspot.com/2006/03/tarkan-confesses.html |title=Tarkan Deluxe: Tarkan Confesses |publisher=Tarkandeluxe.blogspot.com |date=2006-03-30 |accessdate=2014-04-02}}</ref> It formed part of Tarkan's album ''[[\u00d6l\u00fcr\u00fcm Sana (album)|\u00d6l\u00fcr\u00fcm Sana]]''. \"\u015e\u0131mar\u0131k\" was released in [[France]] in 1998 and the rest of the world in 1999, from the [[compilation album]] ''Tarkan'', which was released in [[Europe]]. It has sold two million copies all across Europe. Many versions of the song were recorded in different languages, most notably the English-language cover, titled \"Kiss Kiss\", by [[Greece|Greek]]-[[United States|American]] singer [[Stella Soleil]] in 2001 which was itself covered by [[Australia]]n actress [[Holly Valance]] in 2002.\n\n==The song==\nAs Tarkan's first major single, the song is generally considered his debut single. He had released three albums before this, but never released a song in single format due to the album-orientated nature of the Turkish music industry. The song has also appeared in soundtracks of various movies, including French film ''[[Beau travail]]'' and the American film ''[[XX/XY]]''. It is generally considered Tarkan's signature song in Europe. Its chorus ends with two characteristic [[kiss]] sounds.\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]] is shot in Marseille, France with narrow streets and cobbled roads, with Tarkan [[singing]] and [[jaywalking]]. Several females on the streets see him and start following him to try to [[kiss]] him, but he tries to avoid them by first changing direction and then later by walking faster. More and more women begin to follow him as the song proceeds, but Tarkan eventually starts running in order to avoid them. A big group of women then run after him and as the song finishes, Tarkan takes cover in a street corner. A young girl is there as well and Tarkan kisses her [[forehead]].\n\n==Track listings==\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = Single versions\n| width     = 120\n| image1    = S1 simariklp promo.JPG\n| alt1      =\n| image2    = Lpsimarik 1.JPG\n| alt2      =\n| image3    = Lp simarik3.jpg\n| alt3      =\n}}\n* ''\u015e\u0131mar\u0131k'', 1999\n# \u015e\u0131mar\u0131k Malagutti (4:46)\n# \u015e\u0131mar\u0131k Malagutti edit remix (3:17)\n# \u015e\u0131mar\u0131k Malagutti extended remix (7:00)\n# \u015e\u0131mar\u0131k Ned Divine edit remix (3:13)\n# \u015e\u0131mar\u0131k Ned Divine extended remix (5:56)\n# \u015e\u0131mar\u0131k radio edit(3:12)\n# \u015e\u0131mar\u0131k long (original) version (3:55)\n# \u015e\u0131mar\u0131k Or\u0131ental (4:05)\n# \u015e\u0131mar\u0131k Z\u0131o dub extended remix (6:11)\n# \u015e\u0131mar\u0131k Z\u0131o dub edit remix\n# \u015e\u0131mar\u0131k \u015e\u0131nan soulful (6:14)\n# \u015e\u0131mar\u0131k \u015e\u0131nan dub\nTrack lists to this CD single change depending on the country of release, e.g. [[United States|America]] and Germany.\n\nThere were four promotional [[Vinyl LP|LP]] versions released.\nA promotional CD single was released in France, with an orange cover.

He also planned to exhume the bodies of the caliphs [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Umar]] from their graves in [[Medina]].

Traditional models in hammered [[copper]] plate exist but are today used primarily for decoration.\n\n==Preparation==\n[[File:\u00c6bleskiver.jpg|thumb|An \u00e6bleskive with red jam]]\nThe batter for \u00e6bleskiver usually includes [[wheat flour]], which is mixed with [[buttermilk]], [[milk]] or [[cream]], [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[sugar]] and a pinch of [[salt]]. Some recipes also include [[fat]] (usually [[butter]]), [[cardamom]] and lemon [[zest (ingredient)|zest]] to improve taste, and a [[leavening agent]], most often [[baking powder]], but sometimes [[yeast]], to aerate the batter.\n\nBatter is poured into the oiled indentations and as the \u00e6bleskiver begin to cook, they are turned with a knitting needle, skewer or fork to give the cakes their characteristic spherical shape. They were traditionally cooked with bits of [[apple]] (''\u00e6ble'') or [[applesauce]] inside but these ingredients are very rarely included in modern Danish forms of the dish. \u00c6bleskiver are not sweet themselves but are traditionally served dipped in [[raspberry]], [[strawberry]], [[black currant]] or [[blackberry]] [[Fruit preserves|jam]] and sprinkled with [[powdered sugar]]. Butter, maple syrup, and whipped cream are also popular toppings<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://aebleskivers.com/history.html|title=History|website=Aebleskivers|language=en|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref>.\n\n\u00c6bleskiver can be bought fried and frozen at supermarkets, only needing heating in an oven.\n\n==Traditions==\n[[File:\u00c6bleskiverCook.jpg|thumb|A man making \u00e6bleskiver at the Danish American Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota]]\nIn Denmark, \u00e6bleskiver are less common in restaurants than they are at casual family gatherings. They can also be found being sold by street vendors in the winter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/food/la-fo-aebleskiver13-2009may13-story.html|title=All about aebleskivers|date=2009-05-13|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> They are traditionally served with jam and powdered sugar and three are placed on a plate at a time.

They are often sold at Christmas markets, charity markets, open-air events<ref name=\":0\" />,[[Scouting and Guiding in Denmark|Scouting functions]], local sports gatherings and similar venues. They are also served at children's birthday parties, due to their popularity and easy preparation. Voluntary associations gain profit from preparing them from the pre-fried, frozen stage and selling them, usually three at a time, with the usual condiments.\n\nIn North America there are several annual events that celebrate \u00e6bleskiver and [[Culture of Denmark|Danish culture]], with churches and museums holding \"\u00c6bleskiver Suppers\" and similar events.\n\n== History ==\nThe exact origin of \u00e6bleskiver is unknown.  One popular speculation is that a band of Vikings were part of a difficult battle.  When they returned to their ship, they wished to cook a meal similar to pancakes.  However, since they lacked regular pans, they instead used their shields or helmets, resulting in a cake with a spherical shape.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.solvangrestaurant.com/about-aebleskiver/|title=About Aebleskiver|date=2017-02-10|website=Solvang Restaurant|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*{{annotated link|Paddu}}, A south Indian breakfast and evening snack.\n* {{annotated link|Puff Puff (food)}}\n* {{annotated link|List of doughnut varieties}}\n* {{annotated link|Danish cuisine}}\n* {{annotated link|Egg waffle}}\n* {{annotated link|Gai daan jai}}, a similar Chinese dish.\n* {{annotated link|Jemput-jemput}}, similar Malaysian snack.\n* {{annotated link|Kue cucur}}, similar Indonesian snack.\n* {{annotated link|List of pancakes}}\n* {{annotated link|Munker}}, the Norwegian version.\n* {{annotated link|Neyyappam}}, a similar sweet dish from Kerala used mainly as prasadam in temples.\n* {{annotated link|Paniyaram}}, a similar dish from the south of India that comes in sweet and savoury varieties.\n* {{annotated link|Poffertjes}}, a similar [[Netherlands|Dutch]] dish that is sweet.\n* {{annotated link|Popover}}\n* {{annotated link|Takoyaki}}, a savoury Japanese version that features octopus.\n* {{annotated link|Unni Appam}}, a similar dish from Kerala that is made in both sweet and spicy styles.\n*{{Portal-inline|Food}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{cookbook}}\n* [http://www.solvangrestaurant.com/about-aebleskiver/ The Story of Aebleskiver] (Solvang Restaurant, [[Solvang, California]])\n* [https://dac.mn Danish American Center], Minneapolis, Minnesota\n \n{{Pancakes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aebleskiver}}\n[[Category:Danish cuisine]]\n[[Category:Pancakes]]\n[[Category:Wheat dishes]]\n{{italic title}}\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86bleskiver"}
