The film is based on [[Susannah Cahalan]]'s memoir ''[[Brain on Fire|Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness]]'' and stars [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]], [[Jenny Slate]], [[Thomas Mann (actor)|Thomas Mann]], [[Tyler Perry]], [[Carrie-Anne Moss]], and [[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]]. The film follows a ''[[New York Post]]'' writer who begins to suffer a mysterious illness. [[Principal photography]] began on July 13, 2015, in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. After being evaluated extensively by many doctors, she was diagnosed to be psychotic. She would have been committed to psychiatric ward in a hospital and probably died of encephalitis, if it weren't for the efforts and skills of a Syrian-American neurologist( Souhel Najjar). He empathized with her case, was able to diagnose and treat her rare illness. It had its world premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 14, 2016. The film was released on [[Netflix]] on June 22, 2018.\n\n== Plot ==\n21-year-old Susannah Cahalan ([[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]]) is a writer for ''[[The New York Post]]'' who lives with her new boyfriend Stephen ([[Thomas Mann (actor)|Thomas Mann]]). Susannah becomes suddenly ill, initially showing symptoms of a common flu like a cough and fatigue, but later begins presenting strange behaviour while in a trance state, such as hearing people say things they haven't said and hypersensitivity to loud noises.\n\nOver time, her behaviour becomes more and more erratic. Finally, Susannah suffers a seizure and seeks medical treatment. The doctor consulted is adamant it is down to Susannah partying too much, working too hard and not getting enough sleep. She moves in with her mother Rhona ([[Carrie-Anne Moss]]) and, after an emotional outburst, suffers another seizure, and is taken to a clinic where she undergoes an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]. Susannah also believes she may have [[bipolar disorder]] due to her severe mood changes.\n\nRhona struggles to care for Susannah, and she later moves in with her father Tom ([[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]]) and his new fianc\u00e9. During dinner one night, she becomes violent towards them while suffering another outburst, and her parents demand she is hospitalized despite the MRI, [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], and all other tests showing normal results. In the hospital, one the doctors informs Susannah's parents she could have [[schizophrenia]], and says that if her behaviour does not improve, she will be transferred to a psychiatric hospital. \n\nSusannah gradually becomes catatonic, and [[Souhel Najjar|Dr. Souhel Najjar]] ([[Navid Negahban]]) is asked to help in investigating her case. He has Susannah draw a clock; she draws it with all of the numbers (1\u201312) on the right side of the face, leading Najjar to believe that the right hemisphere of her brain is swollen and inflamed. Najjar has her undergo a brain biopsy in order to take cells from her brain for diagnosis. Following the biopsy, it is found that Susannah has a rare disease called [[anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis]], a brain inflammation, which Najjar describes as \"brain on fire\". Najjar begins treatment, which leads to a slow but full recovery of her cognitive abilities.\n\nSeven months later, Susannah is back at work. She presents her first written piece since her recovery to her boss Richard ([[Tyler Perry]]). It is well received, and he asks her to start writing a book about her experience, which she later titles '[[Brain on Fire]]'. Before the credits, text on screen confirms Susannah Catalan was the 217th person to be diagnosed with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, but her memoir has helped people all over the world, leading to thousands being diagnosed and treated since. She and Najjar remain close friends.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]] as [[Susannah Cahalan]], a 21-year-old woman who one day wakes up in restraints in a hospital a month after suffering from a mysterious illness that doctors are unable to diagnose<ref name=\"MoretzCast\" />\n* [[Jenny Slate]] as Margo, a friend and co-worker<ref name=\"MannSlateCast\" />\n* [[Thomas Mann (actor)|Thomas Mann]] as Stephen, Cahalan's boyfriend<ref name=\"MannSlateCast\" />\n* [[Tyler Perry]] as Richard, Cahalan's boss at the ''[[New York Post]]''<ref name=\"PerryCast\" />\n* [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as Rhona Nack, Cahalan's mother<ref name=\"MossArmitageCast\" /> \n* [[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]] as Tom Cahalan, Cahalan's father<ref name=\"MossArmitageCast\" /> \n* [[Navid Negahban]] as Dr. [[Souhel Najjar]]\n* [[Alex Zahara]] as Allen\n* Jenn MacLean-Angus as Giselle\n\n== Production ==\nOn May 1, 2014, ''Deadline'' reported that [[Charlize Theron]] had acquired the film rights to [[Susannah Cahalan]]'s 2012 memoir ''[[Brain on Fire|Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness]]''.<ref name=May2014Deadline>{{cite news|last1=Fleming|first1=Mike Jr.|title=Charlize Theron Options 'Brain On Fire' As Star Vehicle For Dakota Fanning|url=https://deadline.com/2014/05/charlize-theron-options-brain-on-fire-as-star-vehicle-for-dakota-fanning-722889/|accessdate=June 27, 2015|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|date=May 1, 2014}}</ref> [[Dakota Fanning]] was set to play Cahalan, a young woman who one day wakes up in a hospital with no memory of the events of the previous month.<ref name=\"May2014Deadline\" /><ref name=Jan2013WP>{{cite news|last1=Scarf|first1=Maggie|title=BRAIN ON FIRE: My Month of Madness By Susannah Cahalan|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/brain-on-fire-my-month-of-madness-by-susannah-cahalan/2013/01/12/d5e5ffcc-43c3-11e2-9648-a2c323a991d6_story.html|accessdate=July 21, 2015|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=The Washington Post Company|date=January 12, 2013}}</ref> Theron would produce along with Beth Kono and A.J.

The film is based on [[Susannah Cahalan]]'s memoir ''[[Brain on Fire|Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness]]'' and stars [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]], [[Jenny Slate]], [[Thomas Mann (actor)|Thomas Mann]], [[Tyler Perry]], [[Carrie-Anne Moss]], and [[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]]. The film follows a ''[[New York Post]]'' writer who begins to suffer a mysterious illness. [[Principal photography]] began on July 13, 2015, in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. After being evaluated extensively by many doctors, she was diagnosed to be psychotic. She would have been committed to psychiatric ward in a hospital and probably died of encephalitis, if it weren't for the efforts and skills of a Syrian-American neurologist( Souhel Najjar). He empathized with her case, was able to diagnose and treat her rare illness. It had its world premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 14, 2016. The film was released on [[Netflix]] on June 22, 2018.\n\n== Plot ==\n21-year-old Susannah Cahalan ([[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]]) is a writer for ''[[The New York Post]]'' who lives with her new boyfriend Stephen ([[Thomas Mann (actor)|Thomas Mann]]). Susannah becomes suddenly ill, initially showing symptoms of a common flu like a cough and fatigue, but later begins presenting strange behaviour while in a trance state, such as hearing people say things they haven't said and hypersensitivity to loud noises.\n\nOver time, her behaviour becomes more and more erratic. Finally, Susannah suffers a seizure and seeks medical treatment. The doctor consulted is adamant it is down to Susannah parting too much, working too hard and not getting enough sleep. She moves in with her mother Rhona ([[Carrie-Anne Moss]]) and, after an emotional outburst, suffers another seizure, and is taken to a clinic where she undergoes an [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]]. Susannah also believes she may have [[bipolar disorder]] due to her severe mood changes.\n\nRhona struggles to care for Susannah, and she later moves in with her father Tom ([[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]]) and his new fianc\u00e9. During dinner one night, she becomes violent towards them while suffering another outburst, and her parents demand she is hospitalized despite the MRI, [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], and all other tests showing normal results. In the hospital, one the doctors informs Susannah's parents she could have [[schizophrenia]], and says that if her behaviour does not improve, she will be transferred to a psychiatric hospital. \n\nSusannah gradually becomes catatonic, and [[Souhel Najjar|Dr. Souhel Najjar]] ([[Navid Negahban]]) is asked to help in investigating her case. He has Susannah draw a clock; she draws it with all of the numbers (1\u201312) on the right side of the face, leading Najjar to believe that the right hemisphere of her brain is swollen and inflamed. Najjar has her undergo a brain biopsy in order to take cells from her brain for diagnosis. Following the biopsy, it is found that Susannah has a rare disease called [[anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis]], a brain inflammation, which Najjar describes as \"brain on fire\". Najjar begins treatment, which leads to a slow but full recovery of her cognitive abilities.\n\nSeven months later, Susannah is back at work. She presents her first written piece since her recovery to her boss Richard ([[Tyler Perry]]). It is well received, and he asks her to start writing a book about her experience, which she later titles '[[Brain on Fire]]'. Before the credits, text on screen confirms Susannah Catalan was the 217th person to be diagnosed with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, but her memoir has helped people all over the world, leading to thousands being diagnosed and treated since. She and Najjar remain close friends.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]] as [[Susannah Cahalan]], a 21-year-old woman who one day wakes up in restraints in a hospital a month after suffering from a mysterious illness that doctors are unable to diagnose<ref name=\"MoretzCast\" />\n* [[Jenny Slate]] as Margo, a friend and co-worker<ref name=\"MannSlateCast\" />\n* [[Thomas Mann (actor)|Thomas Mann]] as Stephen, Cahalan's boyfriend<ref name=\"MannSlateCast\" />\n* [[Tyler Perry]] as Richard, Cahalan's boss at the ''[[New York Post]]''<ref name=\"PerryCast\" />\n* [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as Rhona Nack, Cahalan's mother<ref name=\"MossArmitageCast\" /> \n* [[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]] as Tom Cahalan, Cahalan's father<ref name=\"MossArmitageCast\" /> \n* [[Navid Negahban]] as Dr. [[Souhel Najjar]]\n* [[Alex Zahara]] as Allen\n* Jenn MacLean-Angus as Giselle\n\n== Production ==\nOn May 1, 2014, ''Deadline'' reported that [[Charlize Theron]] had acquired the film rights to [[Susannah Cahalan]]'s 2012 memoir ''[[Brain on Fire|Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness]]''.<ref name=May2014Deadline>{{cite news|last1=Fleming|first1=Mike Jr.|title=Charlize Theron Options 'Brain On Fire' As Star Vehicle For Dakota Fanning|url=https://deadline.com/2014/05/charlize-theron-options-brain-on-fire-as-star-vehicle-for-dakota-fanning-722889/|accessdate=June 27, 2015|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|date=May 1, 2014}}</ref> [[Dakota Fanning]] was set to play Cahalan, a young woman who one day wakes up in a hospital with no memory of the events of the previous month.<ref name=\"May2014Deadline\" /><ref name=Jan2013WP>{{cite news|last1=Scarf|first1=Maggie|title=BRAIN ON FIRE: My Month of Madness By Susannah Cahalan|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/brain-on-fire-my-month-of-madness-by-susannah-cahalan/2013/01/12/d5e5ffcc-43c3-11e2-9648-a2c323a991d6_story.html|accessdate=July 21, 2015|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=The Washington Post Company|date=January 12, 2013}}</ref> Theron would produce along with Beth Kono and A.J.

This situation should be improved by inserting twelve new and better modules, resulting in a slightly longer and significantly more accurate machine. The proposal also included the suggestion for a group from [[Warsaw University]], led by Adam Para, to join the project. \nStarting with the long shutdown of the [[Super Proton Synchrotron]] (SPS) from summer 1980 on, the requested changes were implemented. Eventually, half of the experiment's target calorimeters got replaced and the total number of detector modules was increased from 19 to 20. This led to four times higher spatial resolution of the produced particles as well as 25 % more accurate measurements of the deposited hadronic energy. Additionally, four new drift chambers were installed, improving the reconstruction of [[muon]] tracks.<ref>[https://cds.cern.ch/record/1720097?ln=en CERN Document Server:  New developments at WA1 (CERN Bulletin Issue No. 7/1982)] Retrieved on 14 August 2018</ref><ref name=new>[https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01555493 P.

The suggested detector was a modular setup consisting of magnetized [[iron]] modules in combination with [[wire chamber #Drift chambers|drift chambers]] and plastic [[scintillator|scintillators]].<ref name=memo74> [https://cds.cern.ch/record/594735?ln=en CERN Document Server: Memorandum - design and physics of the proposed muon spectrometer] Retrieved on 16 August 2018</ref> This new proposal was approved by the committee in April 1974. Construction started soon after and was completed in 1976. The experiment's official name was ''WA1'', since it was the first approved experiment at CERN's [[List_of_Super_Proton_Synchrotron_experiments#WA experiments|West Area]].\nThe estimated cost of the detector ranged between 6 and 8 million [[Swiss franc|CHF]].<ref name=proposal/> \n\nIn 1979, an upgrade of the experimental setup was proposed.<ref>[https://cds.cern.ch/record/596902?ln=en CERN Document Server:  Request for approval of WA1 improvement programme] Retrieved on 14 August 2018</ref> The main reason for this upgrade was the comparably low resolution of eight of the 19 detector modules. This situation should be improved by inserting twelve new and better modules, resulting in a slightly longer and significantly more accurate machine. The proposal also included the suggestion for a group from [[Warsaw University]], led by Adam Para, to join the project. \nStarting with the long shutdown of the [[Super Proton Synchrotron]] (SPS) from summer 1980 on, the requested changes were implemented. Eventually, half of the experiment's target calorimeters got replaced and the total number of detector modules was increased from 19 to 20. This led to four times higher spatial resolution of the produced particles as well as 25 % more accurate measurements of the deposited hadronic energy. Additionally, four new drift chambers were installed, improving the reconstruction of [[muon]] tracks.<ref>[https://cds.cern.ch/record/1720097?ln=en CERN Document Server:  New developments at WA1 (CERN Bulletin Issue No. 7/1982)] Retrieved on 14 August 2018</ref><ref name=new>[https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01555493 P.

An important step in this regard was the falsification of the alleged \"high-y anomaly\". The value y characterizes the inelasticity of neutrino collisions, i.e. it measures the amount of energy that an incoming neutrino transfers to the [[hadron]]s during their collision. Experiments at [[Fermilab]] had found the so-called \"high-y anomaly\", which challenged the standard model. However, results from CDHS disproved those findings, strengthening the [[standard model]].<ref>[https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.39.433 M.

In the years 1995 to 1997 the Calcutta Armenians applied to the Calcuta High Court to become independent of the Apostolic Church of Etchmiadzin and the High Court by order of Justice S. K. Hazari ordered that the Church and Armenian community would be independent of the Armenian Apostolic Church. It is possibly the oldest church in the Kolkata area.<ref>{{cite web|title=Armenian Churches of India|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~chaterfamilytree/History_Armenians_in_Calcutta_holy_nazareth.html|format=Web page}}</ref> It was rebuild in 1724 by Agha Jakob Nazar after a fire destroyed the previous Armenian church that had been built on the land in 1688.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> To the first Armenians who settled in India, who were renowned merchants and traders and they built up strong community structures including alms houses, chapels and schools to benefit the local Armenians. the early traders signed agreements with the British East India Company codifying their cultural, religious and trading rights. The entire Calcutta Armenian Community, barring a few, were all descendants of the Armenians of Julfa now in Iran. Very few had connections with Armenia or the Etchmiadzin Apostolic Church. Religious opinions and interventions were sought from the Church authorities of Julfa and very little or no contact was made with Etchmiadzin.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.eablanchette.com/_supportdocs/armenians%20in%20Bengal.pdf | title=Trading networks in a traditioal diaspora - Armenians in India, c. 1600-1800 | date=July 2002 | first=Sushil | last=Chaudhury | accessdate=18 May 2018 }}</ref> The Church at no 2, Armenian St, Calcutta 700001 is known to be the oldest Christian church in Calcutta. There are two chapels. St. Mary's Chapel is situated in the Tangra area of east Calcutta. The chapel of rest of St. Gregory, also known to the local Armenians as the 'small church', is situated in the Park Circus area of Calcutta.\nThe Armenian Churches of Calcutta are managed under High Court orders in suit no 413 of 1888 \u2013 John Gregory Apcar and others versus Thomas Malcolm and Sir Gregory Charles Paul, the Advocate General of Bengal. The Church of St. John at Chinsurah is also managed under the same order of the High Court of Calcutta in Suit no 413 of 1888. All the properties. movable and immovable,  of the Armenian trusts for Calcutta Armenians are owned and managed by the government through the Official Trustee.\n\nThe cemetery, dotted with potted plants, is perhaps most famous for being the final resting place of ''Rezabeebeh Sookia''. Her grave dates back to 1630, which makes it the oldest Christian grave in Kolkata, and proves that the arrival of the Armenians to the city predates that of the English in 1690.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe church's interior is decorated with marble. A staircase leads to a galleries section where the walls are adorned with inset [[fresco]]es and paintings. The altar in the church is adorned with a cross, the Gospel text and twelve candlesticks symbolising [[Jesus Christ]]'s Twelve [[Apostles]]. The altar is also decorated with three paintings by English artist AE Harris, \"Holy Trinity\", \"Last Supper\" and \"The Enshrouding of Our Lord\".  The Church at Armenian st was built over an Armenian graveyard and grave stones of the Calcutta Armenians surround the Church on all sides and some gravestones can even be found inside the Church.\n\nOn the east side of the Churchyard the remains of an Armenian Persian type bath can be found on a boundary wall of Hamam St. 'Hamam' is the Persian word for 'bath'.\n\nThe main Church at no. 2, Armenian St. has been used for a few services for worshippers of other Orthodox Churches such as the Syrian and Russian orthodox communities\n\n== History ==\nOn 22 June 1688, the British [[East India Company]] signed a contract with the Armenians residing in India. The contract was signed by Sir [[Josiah Child]], who represented the [[East India Company]]; and Khoja Sarhad and Khoja Fanush, who represented the Armenian community in Bengal. In accordance with the agreement, the East India Company had to build churches throughout [[India]] in areas that were inhabited by at least 40 Armenians, with the provision of 50 pounds as a salary for the priests in those churches.\n\nIn 1708, which is officially considered the founding date of the church (although 1705 and 1707 have also been given as dates by sources), the East India Company built a small wooden church on what is now the site of the southeast wing of the Church of Holy Nazareth. In 2008, it celebrated its tercentenary.<ref name=tserkov /> Later, an Armenian named Aga Nazar (Jakob Nazar) raised money and built the church in 1724.<ref name=oldrussian /> The present church building was built in 1764 by Aga Mamed Hazar Maliyar on land donated by an Armenian named Kenanentekh Phanoosh, and was designed by Kavond (or Hevond) from [[Persia]].\n\nThe interior of the church was designed by [[Catchick Arakiel]]. Arakiel also built a monastery for priests and erected a high wall around the cemetery. In addition, he donated a clock to be fitted in the church structure. In 1790, Catchick Arakiel attached a room to the clergy and set the clock on the belfry. The expensively decorated interiors, including a combination of black and white marble, were placed with the support of wealthy Armenians, such as Sir Catchick Paul Chater. The outer buildings were all built at the expense of wealthy Calcutta Armenians such as Arathoon Stephen, builder and owner of the world-famous Calcutta GRAND HOTEL.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Armenians in India]]\n* [[Elihu Yale]]\n* [[Paul Chater]] (born Khachik Pogose Astwachatoor)- [[India]]n born [[Hong Kong]]-[[Armenians|Armenian]] businessman who left the residue of his estate to the Calcutta Armenian Church after his death in 1926\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<!-- <ref name=children>{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1100523/jsp/calcutta/story_12477031.jsp |title=Church Children |author= |date=23 May 2010 |work= |publisher=[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|The Telegraph]] |accessdate=5 May 2012}}</ref> -->\n \t\n<!-- <ref name=kravkakh>{{cite web |url=http://ricolor.org/rz/india/mp/2/ |script-title=ru:\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0440 \u0432 \u0418\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0438: \u0410\u0440\u0445\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0438\u0442 \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a (\u0415\u043b\u043f\u0438\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439) |language=Russian|author= |year=2011 |work= |publisher=\u0412 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f  |accessdate=29 July 2011}}</ref> -->\n\n<ref name=tserkov>{{cite web |url=http://www.patriarchia.ru/db/text/448494.html |script-title=ru:\u0410\u0440\u043c\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0445\u0440\u0430\u043c \u0432 \u041a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0443\u0442\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0442 \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443 300-\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u044e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0435\u0439 |language=Russian|author= |date=15 August 2008 |work= |publisher=[[Armenian Patriarchate of Moscow]] |accessdate=29 July 2011}}</ref>\n \t\n<ref name=oldrussian>{{cite web |url=http://www.genocide.ru/lib/bhelp/i/i-16-buddha-armenian.html |title=\u0411\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u041f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u044c \u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0448\u0438\u043c\u044a \u0432\u044a \u0422\u0443\u0440\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0410\u0440\u043c\u044f\u043d\u0430\u043c\u044a |language=cu |date=2000\u20132004 |publisher=Genocide.ru |accessdate=29 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930080522/http://www.genocide.ru/lib/bhelp/i/i-16-buddha-armenian.html |archive-date=30 September 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Armenian Church of the Holy Nazareth}}\n* [http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~chaterfamilytree/History_Armenian_Colonies_+_Churches_in_India.html/ The Church of Holy Nazareth Kolkata]\n\n{{Armenian Apostolic Church}}\n{{Contemporary Armenian Churches}}\n{{Dioceses of the Armenian Apostolic Church}}\n\n[[Category:Armenian diaspora in India]]\n[[Category:Armenian Apostolic churches in India]]\n[[Category:Churches in Kolkata]]\n[[Category:Churches completed in 1724]]\n[[Category:1724 establishments in India]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2018}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=March 2017}}\n{{Infobox religious building\n| building_name         = Holy Nazareth Armenian Church<br/>\u054d\u0578\u0582\u0580\u0562 \u0546\u0561\u0566\u0561\u0580\u0565\u0569 \u0570\u0561\u0575\u056f\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0576 \u0565\u056f\u0565\u0572\u0565\u0581\u056b\n| infobox_width         =\n| image                 = Clock Tower -

In the years 1995 to 1997 the Calcutta Armenians applied to the Calcuta High Court to become independent of the Apostolic Church of Etchmiadzin and the High Court by order of Justice S. K.

The entire Calcutta Armenian Community, barring a few, were all descendants of the Armenians of Julfa now in Iran. Very few had connections with Armenia or the Etchmiadzin Apostolic Church. Religious opinions and interventions were sought from the Church authorities of Julfa and very little or no contact was made with Etchmiadzin.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.eablanchette.com/_supportdocs/armenians%20in%20Bengal.pdf | title=Trading networks in a traditioal diaspora - Armenians in India, c. 1600-1800 | date=July 2002 | first=Sushil | last=Chaudhury | accessdate=18 May 2018 }}</ref> The Church at no 2, Armenian St, Calcutta 700001 is known to be the oldest Christian church in Calcutta. There are two chapels. St. Mary's Chapel is situated in the Tangra area of east Calcutta. The chapel of rest of St. Gregory, also known to the local Armenians as the 'small church', is situated in the Park Circus area of Calcutta.\nThe Armenian Churches of Calcutta are managed under High Court orders in suit no 413 of 1888 \u2013 John Gregory Apcar and others versus Thomas Malcolm and Sir Gregory Charles Paul, the Advocate General of Bengal. The Church of St. John at Chinsurah is also managed under the same order of the High Court of Calcutta in Suit no 413 of 1888. All the properties. movable and immovable,  of the Armenian trusts for Calcutta Armenians are owned and managed by the government through the Official Trustee.\n\nThe cemetery, dotted with potted plants, is perhaps most famous for being the final resting place of ''Rezabeebeh Sookia''. Her grave dates back to 1630, which makes it the oldest Christian grave in Kolkata, and proves that the arrival of the Armenians to the city predates that of the English in 1690.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe church's interior is decorated with marble. A staircase leads to a galleries section where the walls are adorned with inset [[fresco]]es and paintings. The altar in the church is adorned with a cross, the Gospel text and twelve candlesticks symbolising [[Jesus Christ]]'s Twelve [[Apostles]]. The altar is also decorated with three paintings by English artist AE Harris, \"Holy Trinity\", \"Last Supper\" and \"The Enshrouding of Our Lord\".  The Church at Armenian st was built over an Armenian graveyard and grave stones of the Calcutta Armenians surround the Church on all sides and some gravestones can even be found inside the Church.\n\nOn the east side of the Churchyard the remains of an Armenian Persian type bath can be found on a boundary wall of Hamam St. 'Hamam' is the Persian word for 'bath'.\n\nThe main Church at no 2, Armenian St. has been used for a few services for worshippers of other Orthodox Churches such as the Syrian and Russian orthodox communities\n\n== History ==\nOn 22 June 1688, the British [[East India Company]] signed a contract with the Armenians residing in India.

The festival is in honour of the patron saint of Algemes\u00ed, La Mare de D\u00e9u de la Salut, and has been dated back to 1247.\nThe holiday was awarded the [[UNESCO]] \"[[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]\" designation on November 28, 2011.\n[[File:UNESCO-ICH-blue.svg |thumb|left|50px|Logo of Intangible Cultural Heritage, UNESCO]]\n\n==History==\nThis celebration originated in Medieval times (1247) and has been held in Algemes\u00ed on the 7 and 8 September to great popular acclaim since then. The traditional ritual acts of the event have been passed from generation to generation and are rich in: oral expression (theatre), music (63 compositions), dance and performances reminiscent of the Roman, Christian, Moorish and Jewish cultures which have woven the very fabric of this land and which are manifest in the creation of the musical instruments, melodies and costumes that are an integral part of this Festivity.\nThe music of the traditional dol\u00e7aina and tabal, and the pieces for orchestra and timpani that provide musical accompaniment for the \u201c[[Muixeranga]]\u201d human towers and the dance performances of the \u201cbastonets\u201d, \u201cpastoretes\u201d, \u201ccarxofa\u201d, \u201carquets\u201d, \u201cllauradores\u201d and \u201ctornejants\u201d, recreate and stimulate a collective memory, transmitting universal messages of highly artistic visual and aural sentiments.\n[[File:Algemes\u00ed MDS - Les Llauradores 03.jpg|thumb|right|250px| Dance of ''Llauradores''.]]\nThroughout the celebration, Algemes\u00ed becomes a living museum, testament to Valencian and Mediterranean traditions, interlaced with the faith, tradition and culture of the liturgical celebrations at the Basilica, the soundscapes created by the ringing of the bells and the 17th Century surroundings along the routes of the processions which over 1400 people take part in.\n[[File:Arquets d'Algemes\u00ed.jpg|thumb|250px|El [[ball d'arquets]].]]\n[[File:Algemes\u00ed MDS - Els Tornejants 01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Tornetjants dancers.]]\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe feast day of Our Lady of Health, patroness of Algemesi is September 8, and commemorates the legendary discovery in 1247 of a statue depicting the Madonna and Child. The image venerated in the town since the mid-twentieth century is a replica, because during the Civil War the original image of the Virgin of Health was destroyed, as was the chapel. The festival appears to have originated in a street party in the area of the Chapel of Finding and gradually spread to other neighborhoods. The main celebration in held on 7 and 8 September, is preceded by a novena at the Chapel of the Finding, which begins August 29 and ends on September 6. The festival has preserved traditional dances and music, and has served as a source for the recovery of dances that formally existed in other locations and have been able to be re-established. The involvement of the town's inhabitants is the foundation upon which the continuity of this celebration is based. Each ritual works and has been prepared independently since the 18th Century. For this unique feature, UNESCO has recognized the ritual, festive and community participation dimension of the Valencian celebration Our Lady of Health as part of the \"intangible heritage of humanity\".[1]\n\nLa \"Nit del Retorn\" - on September the 6th marks the beginning of the first big events of the Festival of the Mare de Deu de la Salut.

The traditional ritual acts of the event have been passed from generation to generation and are rich in: oral expression (theatre), music (63 compositions), dance and performances reminiscent of the Roman, Christian, Moorish and Jewish cultures which have woven the very fabric of this land and which are manifest in the creation of the musical instruments, melodies and costumes that are an integral part of this Festivity.\nThe music of the traditional dol\u00e7aina and tabal, and the pieces for orchestra and timpani that provide musical accompaniment for the \u201c[[Muixeranga]]\u201d human towers and the dance performances of the \u201cbastonets\u201d, \u201cpastoretes\u201d, \u201ccarxofa\u201d, \u201carquets\u201d, \u201cllauradores\u201d and \u201ctornejants\u201d, recreate and stimulate a collective memory, transmitting universal messages of highly artistic visual and aural sentiments.\n[[File:Algemes\u00ed MDS - Les Llauradores 03.jpg|thumb|right|250px| Dance of ''Llauradores''.]]\nThroughout the celebration, Algemes\u00ed becomes a living museum, testament to Valencian and Mediterranean traditions, interlaced with the faith, tradition and culture of the liturgical celebrations at the Basilica, the soundscapes created by the ringing of the bells and the 17th Century surroundings along the routes of the processions which over 1400 people take part in.\n[[File:Arquets d'Algemes\u00ed.jpg|thumb|250px|El [[ball d'arquets]].]]\n[[File:Algemes\u00ed MDS - Els Tornejants 01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Tornetjants dancers.]]\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe feast day of Our Lady of Health, patroness of Algemesi is September 8, and commemorates the legendary discovery in 1247 of a statue depicting the Madonna and Child.
