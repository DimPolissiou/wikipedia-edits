Hinckley played a prominent part in the [[English Civil War]].<ref>[http://www.hinckleypastpresent.org/civilwarhinckley.html Hinckley in the Civil War] Hinckley Past & Present</ref> Its proximity to several rival strongholds\u2014the royalist garrisons at Caldicote, [[Ashby de la Zouch]] and Leicester, those of the Parliamentarians at [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]] and [[Coventry]], and the presence of parties of troops or brigands occupying several fortified houses in nearby Warwickshire\u2014ensured frequent visits by the warring parties. The local townsfolk were forced to decide whether to declare their allegiances openly or attempt to remain neutral\u2014with the risk of having to pay levies, ransoms, and fines to both sides. In March 1644, Hinckley was occupied by a group of [[Cavalier|Royalist]] troops, though they were soon driven out by a force of [[roundhead|Parliamentarian]]s, who took many prisoners.\n\nThe Civil War years were a particularly unsettled time for the clergy in and around Hinckley. Parsons with parliamentary leanings like Thomas Cleveland, the vicar of Hinckley, suffered [[Committee for Compounding with Delinquents|sequestration by the Leicester County Committee]], like some of his \"malignant\" neighbours accused of visiting royalist garrisons or preaching against Parliament.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nThe town was visited by both parliamentary and royalists troops from the rival garrisons, particularly parliamentary troops from Tamworth, Coventry and [[Astley Castle]] in Warwickshire. Troops from Coventry garrison were particularly active in the town, taking horses and \"free quarter\" and availing themselves of 'dyett and Beere', and taking some of the inhabitants hostage for ransom. Royalist troops raided the town to threaten those with parliamentary sympathies. The notorious Lord Hastings of Ashby de la Zouch is recorded to have \"coursed about the country as far as Dunton and Lutterworth and took near upon a hundred of the clergymen and others, and carried them prisoners \u2026 threatening to hang all them that should take the Parliament's Covenant\". Parliamentary newssheets record that on the night of 4 March 1644, Hastings's men brought in \"26 honest countrymen from several towns\" intending to take them to Ashby de la Zouch, along with a huge herd of cattle, oxen and horses from the country people and a minister named Mr Warner. These prisoners were herded into Hinckley church and asked \"in a jeering manner, 'Where are the Round-heads your brethren at Leicester? Why come they not to redeem you?'\"{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n[[File:Davis, Military window inscription.JPG|thumb|left|This inscription is part of a window in St Mary's church, Hinckley]]\nThe Parliamentarians responded in a memorable \"Skirmish or Great Victory for Parliament\". Colonel Grey with 120 foot-soldiers and 30 troopers from Bagworth House rushed to Hinckley and re-took the town, routed the Royalists, rescued the cattle and released their imprisoned countrymen. No doubt the inhabitants of the town were as relieved as any when Ashby finally surrendered, as Vicars records, \"a great mercy and mighty preservation of the peace and tranquility of all those adjacent parts about it.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n[[File:Hinckley, Leicestershire.jpg|thumb|Map of Hinckley and its surroundings dated 1786]]\n=== 19th century ===\n\nAt the time of the first national census in 1801, Hinckley had a population of 5,158: twenty years later it had increased by about a thousand. The largest industry in the early 19th century was the making of hosiery and only Leicester had a larger output of stockings. In the district, it was estimated ca. 1830 that 6,000 persons were employed in this work.<ref>Curtis, John (1831) ''A Topographical History of the County of Leicester'' Ashby-de-la-Zouch: W.

It is reputed that, many years ago, one of the itinerant sheep drovers bragged that he could drink a hat full of ale. The local landlord put this man to the test by getting the local blacksmith to make a tin hat, which he then filled with ale. Thereafter, the town became known as \"Tin 'At\". Another explanation is that the people of Hinckley used to place buckets on water pumps to keep them clean and prevent the spread of illness, the bucket obviously being the \"Tin 'At\". A tin hat can be seen on top of the flag pole which sits on the roof of the Coral branch at the corner of Castle Street and Market Place. There is also a pub called The Tin Hat and a fair held annually during December in the town centre called The Tin Hat Fair.<ref>[http://www.hinckleypastpresent.org/hinckley.html Hinckley Folklore]</ref>\n\n== Twinning ==\n\nHinckley is [[Town twinning|twinned]] with [[Le Grand-Quevilly]], France,<ref name=\"Hinckley-Grand-Quevilly\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hinckley-bosworth.gov.uk/info/200096/information_for_tourists/646/hinckley_town_twinning/2|title=Hinckley, UK \u2013 Grand-Quevilly, France twinning|accessdate = 14 July 2013|work=Hinckley & Bosworth Borough Council}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ville-grand-quevilly.fr/international/ |title=Twinning with Le Grand Quevilly (fr) |publisher=Ville-grand-quevilly.fr |date= |accessdate=26 July 2013}}</ref> and joined with [[Herford]], Germany in the early 1970s.<ref name=\"Hinckley-Herford\">{{cite web|url = http://www.hinckley-bosworth.gov.uk/info/200096/information_for_tourists/646/hinckley_town_twinning/3|title = Hinckley, UK \u2013 Herford, Germany twinning|accessdate = 14 July 2013|work = Hinckley & Bosworth Borough Council|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141210231432/http://www.hinckley-bosworth.gov.uk/info/200096/information_for_tourists/646/hinckley_town_twinning/3|archive-date = 10 December 2014|url-status = dead}}</ref> Hinckley is also twinned with [[Midland, Ohio]], United States.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{commons category-inline|Hinckley, Leicestershire}}\n* [http://www.hinckleypastpresent.org Hinckley Past & Present \u2013 Hinckley Past and Present]\n\n{{Leicestershire}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Hinckley| ]]\n[[Category:Towns in Leicestershire]]\n[[Category:Hinckley and Bosworth]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Town in Leicestershire, England}}\n{{Other uses}}\n{{Use British English|date=May 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2016}}\n{{Infobox UK place\n| country =                England\n| official_name=           Hinckley\n| coordinates = {{coord|52.5413|-1.3725|display=inline,title}}\n| civil_parish=\n| population = 45,249\n| population_ref = ([[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011]])\n| shire_district=          [[Hinckley and Bosworth]]\n| shire_county=            [[Leicestershire]]\n| region=                  East Midlands\n| constituency_westminster= [[Bosworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Bosworth]]\n| post_town=                HINCKLEY\n| postcode_district =       LE10\n| postcode_area=            LE\n| dial_code=                01455\n| os_grid_reference=        SP425939\n|static_image_name= Hinckley Town Centre.jpg\n|static_image_caption=  Hinckley town centre\n}}\n\n'''Hinckley''' is a [[market town]] in southwest [[Leicestershire]], England.

Hinckley played a prominent part in the [[English Civil War]].<ref>[http://www.hinckleypastpresent.org/civilwarhinckley.html Hinckley in the Civil War] Hinckley Past & Present</ref> Its proximity to several rival strongholds\u2014the royalist garrisons at Caldicote, [[Ashby de la Zouch]] and Leicester, those of the Parliamentarians at [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]] and [[Coventry]], and the presence of parties of troops or brigands occupying several fortified houses in nearby Warwickshire\u2014ensured frequent visits by the warring parties. The local townsfolk were forced to decide whether to declare their allegiances openly or attempt to remain neutral\u2014with the risk of having to pay levies, ransoms, and fines to both sides. In March 1644, Hinckley was occupied by a group of [[Cavalier|Royalist]] troops, though they were soon driven out by a force of [[roundhead|Parliamentarian]]s, who took many prisoners.\n\nThe Civil War years were a particularly unsettled time for the clergy in and around Hinckley. Parsons with parliamentary leanings like Thomas Cleveland, the vicar of Hinckley, suffered [[Committee for Compounding with Delinquents|sequestration by the Leicester County Committee]], like some of his \"malignant\" neighbours accused of visiting royalist garrisons or preaching against Parliament.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nThe town was visited by both parliamentary and royalists troops from the rival garrisons, particularly parliamentary troops from Tamworth, Coventry and [[Astley Castle]] in Warwickshire. Troops from Coventry garrison were particularly active in the town, taking horses and \"free quarter\" and availing themselves of 'dyett and Beere', and taking some of the inhabitants hostage for ransom. Royalist troops raided the town to threaten those with parliamentary sympathies. The notorious Lord Hastings of Ashby de la Zouch is recorded to have \"coursed about the country as far as Dunton and Lutterworth and took near upon a hundred of the clergymen and others, and carried them prisoners \u2026 threatening to hang all them that should take the Parliament's Covenant\". Parliamentary newssheets record that on the night of 4 March 1644, Hastings's men brought in \"26 honest countrymen from several towns\" intending to take them to Ashby de la Zouch, along with a huge herd of cattle, oxen and horses from the country people and a minister named Mr Warner. These prisoners were herded into Hinckley church and asked \"in a jeering manner, 'Where are the Round-heads your brethren at Leicester? Why come they not to redeem you?'\"{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n[[File:Davis, Military window inscription.JPG|thumb|left|This inscription is part of a window in St Mary's church, Hinckley]]\nThe Parliamentarians responded in a memorable \"Skirmish or Great Victory for Parliament\". Colonel Grey with 120 foot-soldiers and 30 troopers from Bagworth House rushed to Hinckley and re-took the town, routed the Royalists, rescued the cattle and released their imprisoned countrymen. No doubt the inhabitants of the town were as relieved as any when Ashby finally surrendered, as Vicars records, \"a great mercy and mighty preservation of the peace and tranquility of all those adjacent parts about it.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n[[File:Hinckley, Leicestershire.jpg|thumb|Map of Hinckley and its surroundings dated 1786]]\n=== 19th century ===\n\nAt the time of the first national census in 1801, Hinckley had a population of 5,158: twenty years later it had increased by about a thousand.

It is reputed that, many years ago, one of the itinerant sheep drovers bragged that he could drink a hat full of ale. The local landlord put this man to the test by getting the local blacksmith to make a tin hat, which he then filled with ale. Thereafter, the town became known as \"Tin 'At\". Another explanation is that the people of Hinckley used to place buckets on water pumps to keep them clean and prevent the spread of illness, the bucket obviously being the \"Tin 'At\". A tin hat can be seen on top of the flag pole which sits on the roof of the Coral branch at the corner of Castle Street and Market Place. There is also a pub called The Tin Hat and a fair held annually during December in the town centre called The Tin Hat Fair.<ref>[http://www.hinckleypastpresent.org/hinckley.html Hinckley Folklore]</ref>\n\n== Twinning ==\n\nHinckley is [[Town twinning|twinned]] with [[Le Grand-Quevilly]], France,<ref name=\"Hinckley-Grand-Quevilly\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hinckley-bosworth.gov.uk/info/200096/information_for_tourists/646/hinckley_town_twinning/2|title=Hinckley, UK \u2013 Grand-Quevilly, France twinning|accessdate = 14 July 2013|work=Hinckley & Bosworth Borough Council}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ville-grand-quevilly.fr/international/ |title=Twinning with Le Grand Quevilly (fr) |publisher=Ville-grand-quevilly.fr |date= |accessdate=26 July 2013}}</ref> and joined with [[Herford]], Germany in the early 1970s.<ref name=\"Hinckley-Herford\">{{cite web|url = http://www.hinckley-bosworth.gov.uk/info/200096/information_for_tourists/646/hinckley_town_twinning/3|title = Hinckley, UK \u2013 Herford, Germany twinning|accessdate = 14 July 2013|work = Hinckley & Bosworth Borough Council|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141210231432/http://www.hinckley-bosworth.gov.uk/info/200096/information_for_tourists/646/hinckley_town_twinning/3|archive-date = 10 December 2014|url-status = dead}}</ref> Hinckley is also twinned with [[Midland, Ohio]], United States.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{commons category-inline|Hinckley, Leicestershire}}\n* [http://www.hinckleypastpresent.org Hinckley Past & Present \u2013 Hinckley Past and Present]\n\n{{Leicestershire}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Hinckley| ]]\n[[Category:Towns in Leicestershire]]\n[[Category:Hinckley and Bosworth]]\n", "name_user": "86.8.172.100", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Undid revision 951920047 bySacredDragonX(talk)  I've undone this removal because this documentary is about Hinckley and the people that live here.

Silva's father was an overseer for the Moratuwa Urban Council and his mother was a member of [[Salvation Army]]. Growing up he was fascinated with singing and dancing.<ref name=\"InfoLanka\">{{cite web|url=http://www.infolanka.com/org/srilanka/people/18.htm|title=Freddie Silva: He took our breath away and we did not care|accessdate=2007-02-29|year=2002|publisher=Info Lanka}}</ref>\n\n===Musician===\nIn the 1950s Silva performed the Alanson Mendis composition \"Bar Bar Bar\" in front of Sir [[John Kotelawala]] and was warmly received. He used this opportunity to get a letter of recommendation from Kotelawala which he presented to Livy Wijemanne of [[Radio Ceylon]] to secure a job as a radio artist.<ref name=\"InfoLanka\"/>\n\nSilva's first recording was \"Mottapala.\" He followed the song with \"Bar Bar Bar\" now updated with music by P. L. A. Somapala. It was a success. Subsequent efforts teamed Silva with the late [[Premakirthi de Alwis]]. Their work include comedic songs like \"Aron Mama\", \"Pankiritta\", \"Nedeyo\", \"Handa Mama\", \"Kekille Rajjuruwo\" and \"Parana Coat\" (from ''Lokuma Hinawa''). Silva's crowning achievement is considered the tune \"Kundumani.\"<ref name=\"InfoLanka\"/>\n\n===Actor===\nSilva got his first screen role through a chance meeting with K. A. W. Perera in 1963. At that time he was living with [[H. R. Jothipala]] and Roy de Silva and frequented parties as a guest entertainer. Perera cast Silva in ''Suhada Sohoyuro'' alongside L. S. Ramachandran and Vijitha Mallika. He appeared at a dance on the beach singing \"Diya Rella Werale Hapi Hapi\" with Pushparani who also died same week and went on to be cast in mainly comedic roles.<ref name=\"InfoLanka\"/>\n\nThe serious side of Silva was seen in ''Sekaya'' (1965), ''Lasanda'' (1974) and ''Sukiri kella'' (1975). In the 1975 film he played a mentally handicapped character and in preparation for the role lived with a real handicapped boy in Koralawella.<ref name=\"InfoLanka\"/>\n\nBy the 1980s, producers were reluctant to make a film without Silva fearing that the movie would flop. He was then living an extravagant life and saved little. In 1989 Silva was awarded the Ranathisara award by leading film weekly Sarasaviya. A turning moment came when his friend [[Vijaya Kumaratunga]] (who he appeared alongside in ten films the last being ''Yukthiyada Shakthiyada'') was murdered.

Silva's father was an overseer for the Moratuwa Urban Council and his mother was a member of [[Salvation Army]]. Growing up he was fascinated with singing and dancing.<ref name=\"InfoLanka\">{{cite web|url=http://www.infolanka.com/org/srilanka/people/18.htm|title=Freddie Silva: He took our breath away and we did not care|accessdate=2007-02-29|year=2002|publisher=Info Lanka}}</ref>\n\n===Musician===\nIn the 1950s Silva performed the Alanson Mendis composition \"Bar Bar Bar\" in front of Sir [[John Kotelawala]] and was warmly received. He used this opportunity to get a letter of recommendation from Kotelawala which he presented to Livy Wijemanne of [[Radio Ceylon]] to secure a job as a radio artist.<ref name=\"InfoLanka\"/>\n\nSilva's first recording was \"Mottapala.\" He followed the song with \"Bar Bar Bar\" now updated with music by P. L. A. Somapala. It was a success. Subsequent efforts teamed Silva with the late [[Premakirthi de Alwis]]. Their work include comedic songs like \"Aron Mama\", \"Pankiritta\", \"Nedeyo\", \"Handa Mama\", \"Kekille Rajjuruwo\" and \"Parana Coat\" (from ''Lokuma Hinawa''). Silva's crowning achievement is considered the tune \"Kundumani.\"<ref name=\"InfoLanka\"/>\n\n===Actor===\nSilva got his first screen role through a chance meeting with K. A. W. Perera in 1963. At that time he was living with [[H. R. Jothipala]] and Roy de Silva and frequented parties as a guest entertainer. Perera cast Silva in ''Suhada Sohoyuro'' alongside L. S. Ramachandran and Vijitha Mallika. He appeared at a dance on the beach singing \"Diya Rella Werale Hapi Hapi\" with Pushparani who also died same week and went on to be cast in mainly comedic roles.<ref name=\"InfoLanka\"/>\n\nThe serious side of Silva was seen in ''Sekaya'' (1965), ''Lasanda'' (1974) and ''Sukiri kella'' (1975). In the 1975 film he played a mentally handicapped character and in preparation for the role lived with a real handicapped boy in Koralawella.<ref name=\"InfoLanka\"/>\n\nBy the 1980s, producers were reluctant to make a film without Silva fearing that the movie would flop. He was then living an extravagant life and saved little. In 1989 Silva was awarded the Ranathisara award by leading film weekly Sarasaviya. A turning moment came when his friend [[Vijaya Kumaratunga]] (who he appeared alongside in ten films the last being ''Yukthiyada Shakthiyada'') was murdered. He cites this event as leading to the downfall of cinema. Still Silva stayed busy appearing in 15 of the 26 films made in 1992.<ref name=\"InfoLanka\"/>\n\nBy the late-'90s Silva received no work and lived in poverty with a pension of 2000 rupees from the Sri Lankan Film Corporation. He called his home a broken down garage that served as bed room, living room and kitchen on Emmanuel Church Road, Rawatawatte. Silva died on 29 October 2001.<ref name=\"InfoLanka\"/>\n\n==Family==\nFreddie Silva was a father of two children from his first marriage of Kamala Silva, his son Janesh Silva, was also an actor and a singer.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vH2y2xXONqo</ref><ref>http://www.english.gossiplankanews.com/2014/08/cancer-risk-factors-and-behaviour-of.html</ref> Freddie's  daughter Chandani Silva is a singer and actress.

It was recorded May 1981 in [[Nashville]], and released on 23 October 1981. The record's songs consist entirely of [[country music|country]] [[cover version|covers]], including works originally written by [[Hank Williams]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[George Jones]] and [[Gram Parsons]]. It was Costello's first album not to be produced by [[Nick Lowe]].\n\nContemporary critical reaction to ''Almost Blue'' was mixed, with [[Trouser Press]] labelling the album \"surprisingly clumsy\" and \"a dud\", while [[Robert Christgau]] gave it a grade of B- and Rolling Stone gave it an overall positive three-star review. In recent years, Allmusic rated it favourably, and [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]] praised the album, calling it one of their favourite cover version albums.<ref>[http://blog.rhapsody.com/2010/02/great-covers-albums.html Rhapsody's Favorite Covers Albums] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731012250/http://blog.rhapsody.com/2010/02/great-covers-albums.html |date=31 July 2010 }} Referenced 1 August 2010</ref>\n\n==Packaging and artwork==\nAlbum cover was designed by [[Barney Bubbles]]. The design is an homage to the 1963 Blue Note album ''[[Midnight Blue (Kenny Burrell album)|Midnight Blue]]'' by [[Kenny Burrell]]. Many versions of the artwork were made, with slightly different base colours.\n\nIt originally appeared with a warning label that read \"WARNING: This album contains country & western music and may cause offence to narrow minded listeners\". An alternative label read \"WARNING! This album contains country & western music and may produce radical reaction in narrow minded people\".\n\nA rare promotional version exists, with plain white cover and a pencil drawing of the band by Bruce Thomas. Each cover is uniquely signed by the band members in coloured marker pen. Tracks includes a short introduction by Elvis Costello, explaining the origins of the particular song. The catalogue number is EC Chat1.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing|\n| extra_column = Writer(s)\n| headline = Side one\n| title1 = [[Why Don't You Love Me (Hank Williams song)|Why Don't You Love Me (Like You Used to Do)?]]\n| length1 = 1:40\n| extra1 = [[Hank Williams]]\n| title2 = [[Sweet Dreams (Don Gibson song)|Sweet Dreams]]\n| length2 = 3:00\n| extra2 = [[Don Gibson]]\n| title3 = [[Success (Loretta Lynn song)|Success]]\n| length3 = 2:41\n| extra3 = Johnny Mullins\n| title4 = I'm Your Toy\n| length4 = 3:23\n| extra4 = [[Gram Parsons]], [[Chris Ethridge]]\n| title5 = [[The Bottle Let Me Down|Tonight the Bottle Let Me Down]]\n| length5 = 2:09\n| extra5 = [[Merle Haggard]]\n| title6 = Brown to Blue\n| length6 = 2:40\n| extra6 = [[George Jones]], Virginia Franks, [[Country Johnny Mathis]]\n}}\n\n{{Track listing|\n| headline = Side two\n| extra_column = Writer(s)\n| title1 = [[Good Year for the Roses|A Good Year for the Roses]]\n| length1 = 3:10\n| extra1 = [[Jerry Chesnut]]\n| title2 = Sittin' and Thinkin'\n| length2 = 3:02\n| extra2 = [[Charlie Rich]]\n| title3 = [[Color of the Blues]]\n| length3 = 2:21\n| extra3 = [[Lawton Williams]], [[George Jones]]\n| title4 = Too Far Gone\n| length4 = 3:28\n| extra4 = [[Billy Sherrill]]\n| title5 = [[Honey Hush]]\n| length5 = 2:15\n| extra5 = [[Big Joe Turner|Lou Willie Turner]]\n| title6 = How Much I've Lied\n| length6 = 2:55\n| extra6 = [[Gram Parsons]], [[David Z (music producer)|Pam Rifkin]]\n}}\n\n<small>Note: The Rykodisc version has the original tracks and bonus tracks on one CD.

It was recorded May 1981 in [[Nashville]], and released on 23 October 1981. The record's songs consist entirely of [[country music|country]] [[cover version|covers]], including works originally written by [[Hank Williams]], [[Merle Haggard]], [[George Jones]] and [[Gram Parsons]]. It was Costello's first album not to be produced by [[Nick Lowe]].\n\nContemporary critical reaction to ''Almost Blue'' was mixed, with [[Trouser Press]] labelling the album \"surprisingly clumsy\" and \"a dud\", while [[Robert Christgau]] gave it a grade of B- and Rolling Stone gave it an overall positive three-star review. In recent years, Allmusic rated it favourably, and [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]] praised the album, calling it one of their favourite cover version albums.<ref>[http://blog.rhapsody.com/2010/02/great-covers-albums.html Rhapsody's Favorite Covers Albums] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731012250/http://blog.rhapsody.com/2010/02/great-covers-albums.html |date=31 July 2010 }} Referenced 1 August 2010</ref>\n\n==Packaging and artwork==\nAlbum cover was designed by [[Barney Bubbles]]. The design is an homage to the 1963 Blue Note album ''[[Midnight Blue (Kenny Burrell album)|Midnight Blue]]'' by [[Kenny Burrell]]. Many versions of the artwork were made, with slightly different base colours.\n\nIt originally appeared with a warning label that read \"WARNING: This album contains country & western music and may cause offence to narrow minded listeners\". An alternative label read \"WARNING! This album contains country & western music and may produce radical reaction in narrow minded people\".\n\nA rare promotional version exists, with plain white cover and a pencil drawing of the band by Bruce Thomas. Each cover is uniquely signed by the band members in coloured marker pen. Tracks includes a short introduction by Elvis Costello, explaining the origins of the particular song. The catalogue number is EC Chat1.\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing|\n| extra_column = Writer(s)\n| headline = Side one\n| title1 = [[Why Don't You Love Me (Hank Williams song)|Why Don't You Love Me (Like You Used to Do)?]]\n| length1 = 1:40\n| extra1 = [[Hank Williams]]\n| title2 = [[Sweet Dreams (Don Gibson song)|Sweet Dreams]]\n| length2 = 3:00\n| extra2 = [[Don Gibson]]\n| title3 = [[Success (Loretta Lynn song)|Success]]\n| length3 = 2:41\n| extra3 = Johnny Mullins\n| title4 = I'm Your Toy\n| length4 = 3:23\n| extra4 = [[Gram Parsons]], [[Chris Ethridge]]\n| title5 = [[The Bottle Let Me Down|Tonight the Bottle Let Me Down]]\n| length5 = 2:09\n| extra5 = [[Merle Haggard]]\n| title6 = Brown to Blue\n| length6 = 2:40\n| extra6 = [[George Jones]], Virginia Franks, [[Country Johnny Mathis]]\n}}\n\n{{Track listing|\n| headline = Side two\n| extra_column = Writer(s)\n| title1 = [[Good Year for the Roses|A Good Year for the Roses]]\n| length1 = 3:10\n| extra1 = [[Jerry Chesnut]]\n| title2 = Sittin' and Thinkin'\n| length2 = 3:02\n| extra2 = [[Charlie Rich]]\n| title3 = [[Color of the Blues]]\n| length3 = 2:21\n| extra3 = [[Lawton Williams]], [[George Jones]]\n| title4 = Too Far Gone\n| length4 = 3:28\n| extra4 = [[Billy Sherrill]]\n| title5 = [[Honey Hush]]\n| length5 = 2:15\n| extra5 = [[Big Joe Turner|Lou Willie Turner]]\n| title6 = How Much I've Lied\n| length6 = 2:55\n| extra6 = [[Gram Parsons]], [[David Z (music producer)|Pam Rifkin]]\n}}\n\n<small>Note: The Rykodisc version has the original tracks and bonus tracks on one CD.

His body shook as though plugged into an electrical socket, he wrote, and new ideas poured into him. Then it started raining and the experience ended.

In this historical context, PRS comprises three stages equivalent to those subsumed within PRS: thesis (intellectual proposition, problem), antithesis (negation of the proposition, response to thesis), and synthesis (resolution of tension between proposition and reaction, resolution).

His body shook as though plugged into an electrical socket, he wrote, and new ideas poured into him. Then it started raining and the experience ended.

Infrastructure is owned by the [[South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive]] (SYPTE), with operator [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach]] responsible for the operation and maintenance of rolling stock.\n\nInterest in the development of a modern tram system for Sheffield mounted during the 1980s, after further planning was performed by SYPTE, the Supertram proposal was approved via an [[Act of Parliament#United Kingdom Parliament|Act of Parliament]] during 1991. Construction of the Supertram network, which incorporated several existing heavy rail sections as well as new track, was carried out in sections, allowing for the commencement of the first revenue services during 1994. Early operations were hindered by a complex ticketing system and the initially small coverage area, contributing to disappointing ridership figures during its first years.<ref name = \"rail mag15\">[https://www.railmagazine.com/infrastructure/light-rail/sheffield-supertram-s-logical-progression \"Sheffield Supertram\u2019s logical progression\"] ''[[Rail (magazine)|Rail]]'' 9 December 2015</ref>\n\nDuring 1997, in an efforts to turn around the network's performance, the operation of Supertram was privatised to Stagecoach at price of \u00a31.15 million, who took over from South Yorkshire Supertram Limited. Following management and operational changes, as well as further expansion of the system, ridership numbers have risen considerably.<ref name = \"rail mag15\"/> The Supertram network currently consists of 50 stations across four colour-coded lines, the '''Blue''', '''Purple''', '''Yellow''' and '''Tram-Train''' ('''Black''') routes. As well as connecting with local and national bus and rail services, the network serves six [[park and ride]] sites.<ref>[https://www.stagecoachbus.com/supertram/about-supertraml About Supertram]{{Dead link|date=January 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 'Stagecoach Supertram'</ref>\n\nStarting in 2008, interest has been expressed in the launch of hybrid [[tram-train]] operations, enabling services to traverse sections of the main line rail network in addition to tramways. During 2012, this interest solidified into an experimental trial being planned, as this would be the first deployment of tram-trains anywhere in the United Kingdom. The start of tram-train operations, using a purpose-procured fleet of new [[Vossloh]]-built [[British Rail Class 399|Class 399]] [[Vossloh Citylink|Citylink]] [[electric multiple unit]]s, had been repeatedly delayed due to shortcomings in the planning of infrastructure adaptations, while significant cost overruns have also been experienced. On 25 October 2018, Supertram commenced operations of the new tram-train line from Cathedral to [[Rotherham Parkgate tram stop|Rotherham Parkgate]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stagecoachbus.com/supertram/tram-train/introducing-tram-train|title=Supertram {{!}} Tram Train|website=www.stagecoachbus.com|accessdate=21 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181021151151/https://www.stagecoachbus.com/supertram/tram-train/introducing-tram-train|archivedate=21 October 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Initial development===\nThe origins of what would become the Supertram network came from within the ambitions that were held by the South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive (SYPTE), which was initially a constituent element of the short-lived (1974\u20131986) [[South Yorkshire County Council]], being assigned the role of public transport coordination.<ref name = \"rail tech\"/> Akin to many the larger British cities, [[Sheffield]] had once possessed an extensive tram network, the [[Sheffield Tramway]], which had been completely closed by the end of 1960 amid arguments that motorised [[bus]]es offered superior economics to trams.<ref name = \"rail mag15\"/> The SYPTE took interest in an earlier and more expansive light rail proposal, deciding to investigate it further. The original plan was refined and sufficiently modified to include multiple pre-existing heavy rail alignments in advance of efforts being made to secure the required permissions to proceed.<ref name = \"rail tech\">[https://www.railway-technology.com/projects/sheffield-tram/ \"Sheffield Supertram, Operated by Stagecoach Supertram, United Kingdom.\"] ''railway-technology.com'', Retrieved: 12 May 2018.</ref>\n\nDuring 1985, an [[Act of Parliament#United Kingdom Parliament|Act of Parliament]] authorised the construction of the Supertram. The initial line, on which construction commenced during 1991, was built by the SYPTE at a cost of \u00a3240&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/southyorkshire/content/articles/2005/10/06/sheffield_supertram_feature.shtml |title = Sheffield Supertram information |work = BBC South Yorkshire |publisher = BBC News |accessdate = 11 March 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"thetrams_history\" /> Between 1994 and 1995, the first line was opened in several stages; the first section to open, which was located along a former heavy rail alignment to [[Meadowhall Interchange|Meadowhall]], was opened on 21 March 1994.<ref name=\"thetrams_history\" /> The start of services on the Supertram came only shortly after the launch of another modern tram network, the [[Manchester Metrolink]] network.\n\nUpon opening, the network was operated by South Yorkshire Supertram Limited,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/02634683|title=SOUTH YORKSHIRE SUPERTRAM LIMITED|website=data.companieshouse.gov.uk|accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref> which was an originally wholly owned subsidiary company of SYPTE established to run the venture. The early years of the Supertram were not straightforward; in the eyes of some officials, the scheme was reportedly viewed as having been a failure. Running in direct competition with cheaper and more frequent [[bus]]es, far greater numbers of passengers chose to continue commuting by means other than the fledgling tram network; retailers also frequently complained due to the disruption caused by the lengthy construction works performed while establishing the Supertram network.<ref name = \"20year bbc\">Vincent, James.

Allegedly, by 1996, the councils backing the Supertram had recognised that the operation had both operational and managerial problems which required addressing, thus consultants were asked to draw up options for the system's reorganisation into a more commercially viable venture, including the [[Passenger rail franchising in Great Britain|franchising]] of Supertram and its wholesale selling-off.<ref name = \"rail mag15\"/>\n\n===Privatisation===\n[[File:Sheffield Supertram - Meadowhall Interchange_07-07-04.jpg|thumb|Two [[Siemens-Duewag Supertram]]s at [[Meadowhall Interchange]] in July 2004 in a modified version of the original Stagecoach livery]]\n[[File:Supertram 104 at Gleadless Townend tramstop Sheffield.jpg|thumb|[[Siemens-Duewag Supertram]] 124 arriving at Gleadless Townend tram stop, on the Blue Route to Halfway]]\n\nDuring December 1997, the operating company, South Yorkshire Supertram Limited, was [[Privatisation|privatised]], having been sold to the international transportation company [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach]] for \u00a31.15&nbsp;million; the sale left multiple local councils with the long-term debt for the Supertram's establishment however.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/sheffield-supertram-falls-victim-to-competition-from-cheap-buses-1336364.html \"Sheffield supertram falls victim to competition from cheap buses.\"] ''[[The Independent]]'', 10 June 1996.</ref> The sale price was substantially below the anticipated \u00a380 million that the councils had hoped to raise to help pay off the accumulated debts from the system.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3651587.stm \"Losses 'jeopardising tram plans'.\"] ''BBC News'', 23 April 2005.</ref> Under the terms of the deal struck by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government of the era, a measurable reduction in the system's operating costs was achieved, but it had also meant that the people of South Yorkshire were each paying 5p per week for the Supertram, a practice which was continued over many years.<ref name = \"20year bbc\"/> Stagecoach acquired the concession for the maintenance and operation of the Supertram network until 2024.<ref name=thetrams_history>{{cite web |last= Courtenay |first=Peter |url=http://www.thetrams.co.uk/supertram/history.php |title=Sheffield Supertram: History |accessdate=19 August 2007 |work=TheTrams.co.uk }}</ref><ref name = \"20year bbc\"/>\n\nWhile there were initially plans for Supertram extend service coverage to a greater area of South Yorkshire, such as via envisioned lines that would have run to [[Barnsley]] and [[Doncaster]], progress on such ambitions has been restricted.<ref name = \"20year bbc\"/> According to ''[[BBC News]]'', there has been considerable frustration expressed amongst people outside of Sheffield that they are essentially paying for something they do not use. However, as of 2014, plans to extend Supertram are in various stages of action, and the network has been extended as time has gone on.<ref name = \"20year bbc\"/> Over time, patronage of the Supertram has typically gone up, having grown from 7.8&nbsp;million passenger journeys in 1996/97, to 15.0&nbsp;million during 2011/12.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/light-rail-and-tram-statistics-2011-12 | title=Light rail and tram statistics: 2011/12 | publisher=Government Digital Service | date=19 July 2012}} Table LRT0101.</ref><ref name = \"20year bbc\"/>\n\nThe substantial increase in the Supertram's usage over the years has been credited to various factors.

The trams are 40% low floor design, the vehicles have been specially designed for gradients as steep as 10%. In the 1980s a design choice was taken to create the longest possible vehicle to avoid multiple working<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supertram.com/uploads/Designingourtrams.pdf|title=Home - Supertram|website=Supertram.com|accessdate=4 August 2018}}</ref> which resulted in a {{Convert|34.8|m|adj = on}} design, the third-longest tram design in operation in Europe at the time<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supertram.com/uploads/vehicleinfo.pdf|title=Home - Supertram|website=Supertram.com|accessdate=4 August 2018}}</ref> and the longest in service in the UK until the {{Convert|42.8|m|adj = on}} long [[Edinburgh Tram (vehicle)|Edinburgh Trams]] were introduced.\n\nLaunched in an initial light grey livery, following the awarding of the operating franchise to Stagecoach the trams were reliveried in Stagecoach's corporate livery from 1997. From 2006 the trams were refurbished, and a new dedicated Supertram blue\u2013based livery was launched, rolled out by 2008.\n\n====Stadler Citylink (Class 399)====\n{{Main|British Rail Class 399|Stadler Citylink}}\n[[Stadler Rail|Stadler]] supplied seven [[British Rail Class 399|tram-train vehicles]], delivered between November 2015 and November 2016.<ref name=RGI201115/>\n\n==Infrastructure==\n[[File:Supertram Castle Square.jpg|thumb|[[Siemens-Duewag Supertram]] 125 leaving Castle Square tram stop, on the Purple Route to [[Meadowhall Interchange]]]]\n\n===Track===\n[[File:Sheffield Supertram - Park Square 02-07-04.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of the Supertram [[triangular junction]] at Park Square]] \nThe network is {{convert|29|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, with {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} of track.<ref name=\"technical\">{{cite web |url=http://www.supertram.com/technical.html |title=About us: Technical |accessdate=19 August 2007 |work=Stagecoach Supertram}}</ref> It features two types of track; [[tramway track]] where either pedestrians or road traffic share the right of way and ballasted [[Rail tracks|railway track]] when there are no such requirements.\n\nTramway track consists of a [[Grooved rail|grooved tramway rail]] set into a concrete base with troughs into which the rails are laid. Most of the track is on-street using 35G-section grooved tram rail, with BS11-80A {{convert|80|lb/yd|kg/m|1|abbr=on}} [[flat-bottom rail]] elsewhere.<ref name=\"technical\" /> The railway track was supplied by [[British Steel Corporation]] Track Products of Workington and laid on sleepers consisting of concrete blocks with steel ties which gives a spring feeling when travelling on these sections. The track is laid on a bed of ballast which in turn rests on a prepared formation. Street crossings are usually laid with grooved tramway rails.\n\n===Overhead wiring===\nSupertram is powered through 12 electric substations and fed through {{Convert|107|mm2|adj = on|abbr = on}} cross-section [[Overhead lines|overhead line]] equipment (OHLE) wire.<ref name=\"technical\" /> The substations convert the 11&nbsp;kV&nbsp;AC supply into 750&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC supply into the overhead. The 12 substations are situated as follows:\n* Blackburn Meadows\n* Carbrook\n* Nunnery Square\n* Park Square\n* Arbourthorne\n* Gleadless Townend\n* Birley\n* Crystal Peaks, Ochre Dyke Lane\n* Halfway, Eckington Way\n* University, Brook Hill\n* Langsett Road, Capel Street\n* Middlewood\n\nThe overhead line equipment depends on the location. If the tracks are close together, central poles with 'steady' arms on each side are used. If the tracks are further apart, poles on either side with span wire are used. With aesthetics in mind a minimum number of traction poles are used and whenever possible the wire is anchored onto neighbouring buildings. Supertram, [[Sheffield City Council]] and landlords were in talks to try and hide anchor points as much as possible and blend them into the structures.\n\nThe contact wires are twin cadmium copper ones, twin wires being necessary because of the high installed power rating of the trams (1 megawatt). The [[regenerative braking]] on the tram feeds current back into the wires.\n\n===Operation===\n[[File:Sheffield Supertram - Cab 07-04.jpg|thumb|The driving cab of a [[Siemens-Duewag Supertram]], heading towards Castle Square from Ponds Forge/Fitzalan Square.]]\nThe rules of operation of the Sheffield Supertram are similar to those of a traditional [[railway company|railway]]. Unlike normal trains, tramways can be operated without signalling, although block signalling is sometimes necessary on single-line sections. The trams are driven on a line-of-sight basis, so that the tram can be stopped if an obstruction is spotted ahead.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nSignals, however, are used to give indications to tram drivers when running on-street and at street crossings. As trams have priority<ref>{{cite web |last= Collier |first=Brent |url=http://www.jctconsultancy.co.uk/Symposium/Symposium2017/PapersForDownload/Sprucing%20Up%20Your%20ITS%20Brent%20Collier%20and%20Stephanie%20Cooper%20Sheffield%20City%20Council.pdf |title=JCT Symposium 2017: Sprucing up your ITS|accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref> at many places, it was necessary to give them different traffic light phases from motor traffic and therefore different types of indication have to be used from those applicable to motor vehicles. Signal phases for the tramway are specifically modified to account for the length of the tram. The tram signals are usually operated alongside and in conjunction with traffic signals. Signals consist of white lights arranged vertically (for go), horizontally (for stop) and a cross (for caution). Two other light arrangement indicate a point direction at junctions.\n\n{{clear}}\n'''Tramway signals'''\n<gallery perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Tramway signalling - Proceed.svg|Proceed.\nFile:Tramway signalling - Stop.svg|Stop.\nFile:Tramway signalling - Caution.svg|Caution and proceed.\nFile:Tramway signalling - Turning left.svg|Turning left and proceed.\nFile:Tramway signalling - Turning right.svg|Turning right and proceed.\n</gallery>\n'''Junction signals'''\n<gallery>\nFile:Tramway signalling - Junction signalling - turning left.png|Points set for left.\nFile:Tramway signalling - Junction signalling - turning right.png|Points set for right.\nFile:Tramway signalling - Junction signalling - stop.png|Points misaligned or not detected.\n</gallery>\n\nPoints indicators are provided at junctions to indicate the route which is set through the points. At junctions, where Supertram and train movements can conflict with road traffic, fixed signals are provided in addition to points indicators. A points indicator may only be passed if it displays the correct route indication for the tram concerned and, where fixed signals are provided, if both points indicators and fixed signals are set for the correct route.\n\nLine-side signals give instructions or warnings to tram drivers. To distinguish them from normal road signs, they are diamond-shaped. The most common are speed restrictions which are in miles per hour. These are particularly necessary on road-running where trams travel along with road traffic.\n\nThe route a tram is to take is computer-controlled. The route is set on a device in the tram before a journey is started, and on approach to junctions, a signal is sent from the tram to a device known as a VIS loop buried beneath the track. This automatically sets the points in the correct direction.\n\n===Depot===\n[[File:Supertram Sheffield Station 05-07-04.jpg|thumb|[[Siemens-Duewag Supertram]] 122, operating the Purple Route to Herdings Park, on the [[permanent way]] leaving [[Sheffield station]] for [[Sheffield College]] (Granville Road) in July 2004]]\nThe depot is located at Nunnery Square and occupies the former carriage sidings alongside the [[Sheffield to Lincoln Line|Sheffield-Lincoln railway line]]. It was designed and constructed by [[Balfour Beatty]] on {{Convert|2.6|ha}} of land and consists of a three-line workshop building, six stabling sidings, a turning loop, engineers sidings and sundry equipment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe main offices and reception, supervisor's offices, plant room, staff mess rooms, paint shop, first aid are on the first floor level on the South side of the building. The south-west of the building is home to the Operations and Power Controller's office, where live control of the running of the service is monitored using SCADA, [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] and radio contact. The depot substation is also located in the south-west corner, two 600&nbsp;kVA transformer-rectifiers supply the tramway overhead and an 800&nbsp;kVA transformer feeds the depot facilities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn the workshop itself are two through-running lines (numbered 8 and 9) and line 10, a stub end. All lines have inspection pits and line 8 possesses a Hegenscheidt [[Metal lathe#Wheel lathe|wheel lathe]]. This machine allows wheel turning whilst both sets of doors are closed. The [[Wheelset (railroad)|wheelsets]] are turned in situ. High level access is provided on lines 9 and 10 for servicing of equipment boxes and pantographs. An automated washing machine is located on line 7. The site's security is provided by [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] and fence guarding and is under control of security personnel housed in the operations centre. Road access is from Woodbourn Road at the end of the depot.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe site was, before the arrival of Supertram, already dedicated to the railway industry, [[Nunnery engine shed]] filled most of the site whilst lines of the [[Midland Railway]], [[Great Central Railway]] and [[London & North Eastern Railway]] irrigated the area and served [[colliery|collieries]].\n\n===Tram stop design===\n[[File:Donetsk Way Tram Stop. - geograph.org.uk - 305291.jpg|thumb|Donetsk Way tram stop.

Two [[viaducts]] and one underpass are of interest: the two viaducts carry Supertram onto Park Square (a major road junction in the centre of the city), one of them being a six-span viaduct, the other the [[Tied arch bridge|bowstring]] steel arch [[Park Square Bridge]]. The underpass takes the tram underneath the busy [[A57 road|A57]] roundabout outside the [[University of Sheffield]].\n\n===Ticketing===\nPrior to the Stagecoach takeover, ticketing was done via ticket machines, provided by Abberfield Technology of Australia. These blue ticket machines dispensed adult single ride tickets, senior citizen concessionary tickets and child concessionary tickets. As well as singles, the machines sold multi-packs at a discount. Fare tables were shown on the machines with the validity of the different prices. To travel, each ticket had to be validated in a yellow machine on the platform. The ticket defined the type of passenger and trip. On validation, an overprint was added, giving the tramstop code, time and date of validation and the point of validation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nAs the machines did not dispense change, nearby shop-owners were often asked for change to purchase tickets from the machines. There were also problems with machine reliability.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} When Stagecoach took over South Yorkshire Supertram, it removed the ticket machines and began selling tickets on board. This change brought two key positives: an improved staff presence on board each tram, and meant that passenger's tickets could be systematically checked.\n\nStagecoach Sheffield period tickets are valid on the trams and on Stagecoach buses, and period SYPTE tickets covering Sheffield or the whole of South Yorkshire are valid on Supertram as well as buses and trains. Unlike some other tramway and light rail operators in England, Supertram accepts [[English National Concessionary Travel Scheme|concessionary travel passes]] issued by any English local authority.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.supertram.com/ticketinformation.html | title=Stagecoach Supertram Ticket Information | accessdate=4 January 2010 | publisher=[[Stagecoach Group]] }}</ref> [[PlusBus]] tickets are accepted as well.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n==Opening dates==\n\n* 21 March 1994: Fitzalan Square to Meadowhall\n* 22 August 1994: Fitzalan Square to Spring Lane\n* 5 December 1994: Spring Lane to Gleadless Townend\n* 18 February 1995: Fitzalan Square to Cathedral\n* 17 February 1995: Cathedral to Shalesmoor\n* 27 March 1995: Gleadless Townend to Halfway\n* 3 April 1995: Gleadless Townend to Herdings Park\n* 23 October 1995: Shalesmoor to Middlewood/Malin Bridge\n* 25 October 2018: Tinsley/Meadowhall South to Rotherham Parkgate (tram-train)\n==Corporate affairs==\n===Ownership and structure===\nThe system is owned by the [[South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive]] (SYPTE), which in turn is controlled by the [[Sheffield City Region Combined Authority]], which consists of representatives from the metropolitan boroughs of [[Sheffield]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham|Rotherham]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster|Doncaster]], and [[Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley|Barnsley]].\n\nSupertram is operated through an exclusive concession agreement between SYPTE and South Yorkshire Supertram Ltd (SYSL), now a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach Holdings PLC]].

Infrastructure is owned by the [[South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive]] (SYPTE), with operator [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach]] responsible for the operation and maintenance of rolling stock.\n\nInterest in the development of a modern tram system for Sheffield mounted during the 1980s, after further planning was performed by SYPTE, the Supertram proposal was approved via an [[Act of Parliament#United Kingdom Parliament|Act of Parliament]] during 1991. Construction of the Supertram network, which incorporated several existing heavy rail sections as well as new track, was carried out in sections, allowing for the commencement of the first revenue services during 1994. Early operations were hindered by a complex ticketing system and the initially small coverage area, contributing to disappointing ridership figures during its first years.<ref name = \"rail mag15\">[https://www.railmagazine.com/infrastructure/light-rail/sheffield-supertram-s-logical-progression \"Sheffield Supertram\u2019s logical progression\"] ''[[Rail (magazine)|Rail]]'' 9 December 2015</ref>\n\nDuring 1997, in an efforts to turn around the network's performance, the operation of Supertram was privatised to Stagecoach at price of \u00a31.15 million, who took over from South Yorkshire Supertram Limited. Following management and operational changes, as well as further expansion of the system, ridership numbers have risen considerably.<ref name = \"rail mag15\"/> The Supertram network currently consists of 50 stations across four colour-coded lines, the '''Blue''', '''Purple''', '''Yellow''' and '''Tram-Train''' ('''Black''') routes. As well as connecting with local and national bus and rail services, the network serves six [[park and ride]] sites.<ref>[https://www.stagecoachbus.com/supertram/about-supertraml About Supertram]{{Dead link|date=January 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 'Stagecoach Supertram'</ref>\n\nStarting in 2008, interest has been expressed in the launch of hybrid [[tram-train]] operations, enabling services to traverse sections of the main line rail network in addition to tramways. During 2012, this interest solidified into an experimental trial being planned, as this would be the first deployment of tram-trains anywhere in the United Kingdom. The start of tram-train operations, using a purpose-procured fleet of new [[Vossloh]]-built [[British Rail Class 399|Class 399]] [[Vossloh Citylink|Citylink]] [[electric multiple unit]]s, had been repeatedly delayed due to shortcomings in the planning of infrastructure adaptations, while significant cost overruns have also been experienced. On 25 October 2018, Supertram commenced operations of the new tram-train line from Cathedral to [[Rotherham Parkgate tram stop|Rotherham Parkgate]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stagecoachbus.com/supertram/tram-train/introducing-tram-train|title=Supertram {{!}} Tram Train|website=www.stagecoachbus.com|accessdate=21 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181021151151/https://www.stagecoachbus.com/supertram/tram-train/introducing-tram-train|archivedate=21 October 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Initial development===\nThe origins of what would become the Supertram network came from within the ambitions that were held by the South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive (SYPTE), which was initially a constituent element of the short-lived (1974\u20131986) [[South Yorkshire County Council]], being assigned the role of public transport coordination.<ref name = \"rail tech\"/> Akin to many the larger British cities, [[Sheffield]] had once possessed an extensive tram network, the [[Sheffield Tramway]], which had been completely closed by the end of 1960 amid arguments that motorised [[bus]]es offered superior economics to trams.<ref name = \"rail mag15\"/> The SYPTE took interest in an earlier and more expansive light rail proposal, deciding to investigate it further. The original plan was refined and sufficiently modified to include multiple pre-existing heavy rail alignments in advance of efforts being made to secure the required permissions to proceed.<ref name = \"rail tech\">[https://www.railway-technology.com/projects/sheffield-tram/ \"Sheffield Supertram, Operated by Stagecoach Supertram, United Kingdom.\"] ''railway-technology.com'', Retrieved: 12 May 2018.</ref>\n\nDuring 1985, an [[Act of Parliament#United Kingdom Parliament|Act of Parliament]] authorised the construction of the Supertram. The initial line, on which construction commenced during 1991, was built by the SYPTE at a cost of \u00a3240&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/southyorkshire/content/articles/2005/10/06/sheffield_supertram_feature.shtml |title = Sheffield Supertram information |work = BBC South Yorkshire |publisher = BBC News |accessdate = 11 March 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"thetrams_history\" /> Between 1994 and 1995, the first line was opened in several stages; the first section to open, which was located along a former heavy rail alignment to [[Meadowhall Interchange|Meadowhall]], was opened on 21 March 1994.<ref name=\"thetrams_history\" /> The start of services on the Supertram came only shortly after the launch of another modern tram network, the [[Manchester Metrolink]] network.\n\nUpon opening, the network was operated by South Yorkshire Supertram Limited,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/02634683|title=SOUTH YORKSHIRE SUPERTRAM LIMITED|website=data.companieshouse.gov.uk|accessdate=25 October 2018}}</ref> which was an originally wholly owned subsidiary company of SYPTE established to run the venture. The early years of the Supertram were not straightforward; in the eyes of some officials, the scheme was reportedly viewed as having been a failure. Running in direct competition with cheaper and more frequent [[bus]]es, far greater numbers of passengers chose to continue commuting by means other than the fledgling tram network; retailers also frequently complained due to the disruption caused by the lengthy construction works performed while establishing the Supertram network.<ref name = \"20year bbc\">Vincent, James. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-26663137 \"Sheffield Supertram marks 20-year journey\"] ''BBC News'' 21 March 2014</ref> The complex ticketing system originally adopted has also been attributed as having being a source of irritance and confusion to would-be passengers.<ref name = \"rail mag15\"/>\n\nWithin the first two years of operations, it became clear that the projections for passenger numbers had been overly optimistic, while there was concern that the system represented poor value for money and did not seem to be gaining traction.<ref name = \"20year bbc\"/> Thus, the issue of what party should bear the cost became a politicised matter. Allegedly, by 1996, the councils backing the Supertram had recognised that the operation had both operational and managerial problems which required addressing, thus consultants were asked to draw up options for the system's reorganisation into a more commercially viable venture, including the [[Passenger rail franchising in Great Britain|franchising]] of Supertram and its wholesale selling-off.<ref name = \"rail mag15\"/>\n\n===Privatisation===\n[[File:Sheffield Supertram - Meadowhall Interchange_07-07-04.jpg|thumb|Two [[Siemens-Duewag Supertram]]s at [[Meadowhall Interchange]] in July 2004 in a modified version of the original Stagecoach livery]]\n[[File:Supertram 104 at Gleadless Townend tramstop Sheffield.jpg|thumb|[[Siemens-Duewag Supertram]] 124 arriving at Gleadless Townend tram stop, on the Blue Route to Halfway]]\n\nDuring December 1997, the operating company, South Yorkshire Supertram Limited, was [[Privatisation|privatised]], having been sold to the international transportation company [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach]] for \u00a31.15&nbsp;million; the sale left multiple local councils with the long-term debt for the Supertram's establishment however.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/sheffield-supertram-falls-victim-to-competition-from-cheap-buses-1336364.html \"Sheffield supertram falls victim to competition from cheap buses.\"] ''[[The Independent]]'', 10 June 1996.</ref> The sale price was substantially below the anticipated \u00a380 million that the councils had hoped to raise to help pay off the accumulated debts from the system.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3651587.stm \"Losses 'jeopardising tram plans'.\"] ''BBC News'', 23 April 2005.</ref> Under the terms of the deal struck by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government of the era, a measurable reduction in the system's operating costs was achieved, but it had also meant that the people of South Yorkshire were each paying 5p per week for the Supertram, a practice which was continued over many years.<ref name = \"20year bbc\"/> Stagecoach acquired the concession for the maintenance and operation of the Supertram network until 2024.<ref name=thetrams_history>{{cite web |last= Courtenay |first=Peter |url=http://www.thetrams.co.uk/supertram/history.php |title=Sheffield Supertram: History |accessdate=19 August 2007 |work=TheTrams.co.uk }}</ref><ref name = \"20year bbc\"/>\n\nWhile there were initially plans for Supertram extend service coverage to a greater area of South Yorkshire, such as via envisioned lines that would have run to [[Barnsley]] and [[Doncaster]], progress on such ambitions has been restricted.<ref name = \"20year bbc\"/> According to ''[[BBC News]]'', there has been considerable frustration expressed amongst people outside of Sheffield that they are essentially paying for something they do not use. However, as of 2014, plans to extend Supertram are in various stages of action, and the network has been extended as time has gone on.<ref name = \"20year bbc\"/> Over time, patronage of the Supertram has typically gone up, having grown from 7.8&nbsp;million passenger journeys in 1996/97, to 15.0&nbsp;million during 2011/12.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/light-rail-and-tram-statistics-2011-12 | title=Light rail and tram statistics: 2011/12 | publisher=Government Digital Service | date=19 July 2012}} Table LRT0101.</ref><ref name = \"20year bbc\"/>\n\nThe substantial increase in the Supertram's usage over the years has been credited to various factors.

The trams are 40% low floor design, the vehicles have been specially designed for gradients as steep as 10%. In the 1980s a design choice was taken to create the longest possible vehicle to avoid multiple working<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supertram.com/uploads/Designingourtrams.pdf|title=Home - Supertram|website=Supertram.com|accessdate=4 August 2018}}</ref> which resulted in a {{Convert|34.8|m|adj = on}} design, the third-longest tram design in operation in Europe at the time<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supertram.com/uploads/vehicleinfo.pdf|title=Home - Supertram|website=Supertram.com|accessdate=4 August 2018}}</ref> and the longest in service in the UK until the {{Convert|42.8|m|adj = on}} long [[Edinburgh Tram (vehicle)|Edinburgh Trams]] were introduced.\n\nLaunched in an initial light grey livery, following the awarding of the operating franchise to Stagecoach the trams were reliveried in Stagecoach's corporate livery from 1997. From 2006 the trams were refurbished, and a new dedicated Supertram blue\u2013based livery was launched, rolled out by 2008.\n\n====Stadler Citylink (Class 399)====\n{{Main|British Rail Class 399|Stadler Citylink}}\n[[Stadler Rail|Stadler]] supplied seven [[British Rail Class 399|tram-train vehicles]], delivered between November 2015 and November 2016.<ref name=RGI201115/>\n\n==Infrastructure==\n[[File:Supertram Castle Square.jpg|thumb|[[Siemens-Duewag Supertram]] 125 leaving Castle Square tram stop, on the Purple Route to [[Meadowhall Interchange]]]]\n\n===Track===\n[[File:Sheffield Supertram - Park Square 02-07-04.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of the Supertram [[triangular junction]] at Park Square]] \nThe network is {{convert|29|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, with {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} of track.<ref name=\"technical\">{{cite web |url=http://www.supertram.com/technical.html |title=About us: Technical |accessdate=19 August 2007 |work=Stagecoach Supertram}}</ref> It features two types of track; [[tramway track]] where either pedestrians or road traffic share the right of way and ballasted [[Rail tracks|railway track]] when there are no such requirements.\n\nTramway track consists of a [[Grooved rail|grooved tramway rail]] set into a concrete base with troughs into which the rails are laid. Most of the track is on-street using 35G-section grooved tram rail, with BS11-80A {{convert|80|lb/yd|kg/m|1|abbr=on}} [[flat-bottom rail]] elsewhere.<ref name=\"technical\" /> The railway track was supplied by [[British Steel Corporation]] Track Products of Workington and laid on sleepers consisting of concrete blocks with steel ties which gives a spring feeling when travelling on these sections. The track is laid on a bed of ballast which in turn rests on a prepared formation. Street crossings are usually laid with grooved tramway rails.\n\n===Overhead wiring===\nSupertram is powered through 12 electric substations and fed through {{Convert|107|mm2|adj = on|abbr = on}} cross-section [[Overhead lines|overhead line]] equipment (OHLE) wire.<ref name=\"technical\" /> The substations convert the 11&nbsp;kV&nbsp;AC supply into 750&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC supply into the overhead. The 12 substations are situated as follows:\n* Blackburn Meadows\n* Carbrook\n* Nunnery Square\n* Park Square\n* Arbourthorne\n* Gleadless Townend\n* Birley\n* Crystal Peaks, Ochre Dyke Lane\n* Halfway, Eckington Way\n* University, Brook Hill\n* Langsett Road, Capel Street\n* Middlewood\n\nThe overhead line equipment depends on the location. If the tracks are close together, central poles with 'steady' arms on each side are used. If the tracks are further apart, poles on either side with span wire are used. With aesthetics in mind a minimum number of traction poles are used and whenever possible the wire is anchored onto neighbouring buildings. Supertram, [[Sheffield City Council]] and landlords were in talks to try and hide anchor points as much as possible and blend them into the structures.\n\nThe contact wires are twin cadmium copper ones, twin wires being necessary because of the high installed power rating of the trams (1 megawatt). The [[regenerative braking]] on the tram feeds current back into the wires.\n\n===Operation===\n[[File:Sheffield Supertram - Cab 07-04.jpg|thumb|The driving cab of a [[Siemens-Duewag Supertram]], heading towards Castle Square from Ponds Forge/Fitzalan Square.]]\nThe rules of operation of the Sheffield Supertram are similar to those of a traditional [[railway company|railway]]. Unlike normal trains, tramways can be operated without signalling, although block signalling is sometimes necessary on single-line sections. The trams are driven on a line-of-sight basis, so that the tram can be stopped if an obstruction is spotted ahead.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nSignals, however, are used to give indications to tram drivers when running on-street and at street crossings. As trams have priority<ref>{{cite web |last= Collier |first=Brent |url=http://www.jctconsultancy.co.uk/Symposium/Symposium2017/PapersForDownload/Sprucing%20Up%20Your%20ITS%20Brent%20Collier%20and%20Stephanie%20Cooper%20Sheffield%20City%20Council.pdf |title=JCT Symposium 2017: Sprucing up your ITS|accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref> at many places, it was necessary to give them different traffic light phases from motor traffic and therefore different types of indication have to be used from those applicable to motor vehicles. Signal phases for the tramway are specifically modified to account for the length of the tram. The tram signals are usually operated alongside and in conjunction with traffic signals. Signals consist of white lights arranged vertically (for go), horizontally (for stop) and a cross (for caution). Two other light arrangement indicate a point direction at junctions.\n\n{{clear}}\n'''Tramway signals'''\n<gallery perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Tramway signalling - Proceed.svg|Proceed.\nFile:Tramway signalling - Stop.svg|Stop.\nFile:Tramway signalling - Caution.svg|Caution and proceed.\nFile:Tramway signalling - Turning left.svg|Turning left and proceed.\nFile:Tramway signalling - Turning right.svg|Turning right and proceed.\n</gallery>\n'''Junction signals'''\n<gallery>\nFile:Tramway signalling - Junction signalling - turning left.png|Points set for left.\nFile:Tramway signalling - Junction signalling - turning right.png|Points set for right.\nFile:Tramway signalling - Junction signalling - stop.png|Points misaligned or not detected.\n</gallery>\n\nPoints indicators are provided at junctions to indicate the route which is set through the points. At junctions, where Supertram and train movements can conflict with road traffic, fixed signals are provided in addition to points indicators. A points indicator may only be passed if it displays the correct route indication for the tram concerned and, where fixed signals are provided, if both points indicators and fixed signals are set for the correct route.\n\nLine-side signals give instructions or warnings to tram drivers. To distinguish them from normal road signs, they are diamond-shaped. The most common are speed restrictions which are in miles per hour. These are particularly necessary on road-running where trams travel along with road traffic.\n\nThe route a tram is to take is computer-controlled. The route is set on a device in the tram before a journey is started, and on approach to junctions, a signal is sent from the tram to a device known as a VIS loop buried beneath the track. This automatically sets the points in the correct direction.\n\n===Depot===\n[[File:Supertram Sheffield Station 05-07-04.jpg|thumb|[[Siemens-Duewag Supertram]] 122, operating the Purple Route to Herdings Park, on the [[permanent way]] leaving [[Sheffield station]] for [[Sheffield College]] (Granville Road) in July 2004]]\nThe depot is located at Nunnery Square and occupies the former carriage sidings alongside the [[Sheffield to Lincoln Line|Sheffield-Lincoln railway line]]. It was designed and constructed by [[Balfour Beatty]] on {{Convert|2.6|ha}} of land and consists of a three-line workshop building, six stabling sidings, a turning loop, engineers sidings and sundry equipment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe main offices and reception, supervisor's offices, plant room, staff mess rooms, paint shop, first aid are on the first floor level on the South side of the building. The south-west of the building is home to the Operations and Power Controller's office, where live control of the running of the service is monitored using SCADA, [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] and radio contact. The depot substation is also located in the south-west corner, two 600&nbsp;kVA transformer-rectifiers supply the tramway overhead and an 800&nbsp;kVA transformer feeds the depot facilities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn the workshop itself are two through-running lines (numbered 8 and 9) and line 10, a stub end. All lines have inspection pits and line 8 possesses a Hegenscheidt [[Metal lathe#Wheel lathe|wheel lathe]]. This machine allows wheel turning whilst both sets of doors are closed. The [[Wheelset (railroad)|wheelsets]] are turned in situ. High level access is provided on lines 9 and 10 for servicing of equipment boxes and pantographs. An automated washing machine is located on line 7. The site's security is provided by [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] and fence guarding and is under control of security personnel housed in the operations centre. Road access is from Woodbourn Road at the end of the depot.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe site was, before the arrival of Supertram, already dedicated to the railway industry, [[Nunnery engine shed]] filled most of the site whilst lines of the [[Midland Railway]], [[Great Central Railway]] and [[London & North Eastern Railway]] irrigated the area and served [[colliery|collieries]].\n\n===Tram stop design===\n[[File:Donetsk Way Tram Stop. - geograph.org.uk - 305291.jpg|thumb|Donetsk Way tram stop. The platform edge's alignment and rugged paving can be seen.]]\nThe Supertram has 50 stops,<ref>{{cite web |last= Courtenay |first=Peter |url=http://www.thetrams.co.uk/factsnfigures.php?section=supertram |title=Sheffield Supertram: Facts and figures |accessdate=19 August 2007 |format= |work= }}</ref> which are generally {{Convert|26.5|m|abbr = on}} long and {{Convert|3|m|abbr = on}} deep and are of a network-wide standard making them easy to understand and use.

Two [[viaducts]] and one underpass are of interest: the two viaducts carry Supertram onto Park Square (a major road junction in the centre of the city), one of them being a six-span viaduct, the other the [[Tied arch bridge|bowstring]] steel arch [[Park Square Bridge]]. The underpass takes the tram underneath the busy [[A57 road|A57]] roundabout outside the [[University of Sheffield]].\n\n===Ticketing===\nPrior to the Stagecoach takeover, ticketing was done via ticket machines, provided by Abberfield Technology of Australia. These blue ticket machines dispensed adult single ride tickets, senior citizen concessionary tickets and child concessionary tickets. As well as singles, the machines sold multi-packs at a discount. Fare tables were shown on the machines with the validity of the different prices. To travel, each ticket had to be validated in a yellow machine on the platform. The ticket defined the type of passenger and trip. On validation, an overprint was added, giving the tramstop code, time and date of validation and the point of validation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nAs the machines did not dispense change, nearby shop-owners were often asked for change to purchase tickets from the machines. There were also problems with machine reliability.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} When Stagecoach took over South Yorkshire Supertram, it removed the ticket machines and began selling tickets on board. This change brought two key positives: an improved staff presence on board each tram, and meant that passenger's tickets could be systematically checked.\n\nStagecoach Sheffield period tickets are valid on the trams and on Stagecoach buses, and period SYPTE tickets covering Sheffield or the whole of South Yorkshire are valid on Supertram as well as buses and trains. Unlike some other tramway and light rail operators in England, Supertram accepts [[English National Concessionary Travel Scheme|concessionary travel passes]] issued by any English local authority.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.supertram.com/ticketinformation.html | title=Stagecoach Supertram Ticket Information | accessdate=4 January 2010 | publisher=[[Stagecoach Group]] }}</ref> [[PlusBus]] tickets are accepted as well.\n{{clear|right}}\n\n==Opening dates==\n\n* 21 March 1994: Fitzalan Square to Meadowhall\n* 22 August 1994: Fitzalan Square to Spring Lane\n* 5 December 1994: Spring Lane to Gleadless Townend\n* 18 February 1995: Fitzalan Square to Cathedral\n* 17 February 1995: Cathedral to Shalesmoor\n* 27 March 1995: Gleadless Townend to Halfway\n* 3 April 1995: Gleadless Townend to Herdings Park\n* 23 October 1995: Shalesmoor to Middlewood/Malin Bridge\n* 25 October 2018: Tinsley/Meadowhall South to Rotherham Parkgate (tram-train)\n==Corporate affairs==\n===Ownership and structure===\nThe system is owned by the [[South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive]] (SYPTE), which in turn is controlled by the [[Sheffield City Region Combined Authority]], which consists of representatives from the metropolitan boroughs of [[Sheffield]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham|Rotherham]], [[Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster|Doncaster]], and [[Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley|Barnsley]].\n\nSupertram is operated through an exclusive concession agreement between SYPTE and South Yorkshire Supertram Ltd (SYSL), now a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach Holdings PLC]]. SYSL holds the concession to operate and maintain the network until 31 March 2024. \n\n===Business trends===\nThe key trends in recent years for Sheffield Supertram are (years ending 31 March):\n[[File:399206 Parkgate.jpg|thumb|A Supertram tram-train, pictured following introduction of the service in October 2018]]\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

The fleet of five tram trains, costing \u00a39&nbsp;million was expected to be in operation by the end of 2010 with the whole project costing \u00a324&nbsp;million for the 37 mile route. It was planned that the hourly [[Northern Rail (Serco-Abellio)|Northern Rail]] service from Barnsley to Huddersfield would be scrapped, being replaced by a more frequent tram service with more stops and a faster service due to the trams' more rapid acceleration.

Since both kingdoms were named Sicily, they were collectively known as the \"Two Sicilies\" (''Utraque Sicilia'', literally \"both Sicilies\"), and the unified kingdom adopted this name. The King of the Two Sicilies was [[Expedition of the Thousand|overthrown by Giuseppe Garibaldi]] in 1860, after which the people voted in a [[plebiscite]] to join the [[House of Savoy|Savoyard]] [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. The annexation of the Two Sicilies completed the first phase of [[Italian unification]], and the new [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Kingdom of Italy]] was proclaimed in 1861.\n\nThe Two Sicilies were heavily agricultural, like the other Italian states.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nicola Zitara|url=http://www.eleaml.org/e_book/unitruff_cap1.pdf|title=La legge di Archimede: L'accumulazione selvaggia nell'Italia unificata e la nascita del colonialismo interno|publisher=Eleaml-Fora!|language=Italian}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Name==\nThe name \"Two Sicilies\" originated from the partition of the medieval [[Kingdom of Sicily]].

The expedition resulted in a striking series of defeats for the Sicilian armies facing the growing troops of Garibaldi. After the capture of Palermo and Sicily, Garibaldi disembarked in [[Calabria]] and moved towards Naples, while in the meantime the Piedmontese also invaded the Kingdom from the [[Marche]]. The last battles took place at [[battle of Volturnus (1860)|Volturnus in 1860]] and at the [[siege of Gaeta (1860)|siege of Gaeta]], where King [[Francesco II of the Two Sicilies|Francis II]] (reigned 1859\u20131861) had sought shelter, hoping for French help, which never came.

One of the most important industrial complexes in the kingdom was the [[shipyard]] of [[Castellammare di Stabia]], which employed 1800 workers. The engineering factory of [[Pietrarsa]] was the largest industrial plant in the Italian peninsula{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}, producing tools, [[cannon]]s, rails, [[locomotive]]s. The complex also included a school for train drivers, and naval engineers and, thanks to this school, the kingdom was able to replace the English personnel who had been necessary until then. The first [[steamboat]] with [[propellor|screw propulsion]] known in the Mediterranean Sea was the \"Giglio delle Onde\", with mail delivery and passenger transport purposes after 1847.\n\nIn Calabria, the Fonderia Ferdinandea was a large [[foundry]] where cast iron was produced. The [[Reali ferriere ed Officine di Mongiana]] was an iron foundry and [[weapon]]s factory. Founded in 1770, it employed 1600 workers in 1860 and closed in 1880.  In Sicily (near [[Catania]] and [[Agrigento]]), [[sulfur]] was mined to make [[gunpowder]]. The Sicilian mines were able to satisfy most of the global demand for sulfur. [[Silk]] cloth production was focused in [[San Leucio]] (near [[Caserta]]). The region of [[Basilicata]] also had several mills in [[Potenza]] and [[San Chirico Raparo]], where [[cotton]], [[wool]] and silk were processed.

In [[Industrial Revolution|industrializing]] Britain, with the repeal of [[Tariff|tariffs]] on salt in 1824, demand for sulfur from Sicily surged upward. The increasing British control and exploitation of the mining, refining, and transportation of the sulfur, coupled with the failure of this lucrative export to transform Sicily's backward and impoverished economy, led to the 'Sulfur Crisis' of 1840, when [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies|King Ferdinand II]] gave a monopoly of the sulfur industry to a French firm, violating an earlier 1816 trade agreement with Britain.

The expedition resulted in a striking series of defeats for the Sicilian armies facing the growing troops of Garibaldi. After the capture of Palermo and Sicily, Garibaldi disembarked in [[Calabria]] and moved towards Naples, while in the meantime the Piedmontese also invaded the Kingdom from the [[Marche]].

The engineering factory of [[Pietrarsa]] was the largest industrial plant in the Italian peninsula{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}, producing tools, [[cannon]]s, rails, [[locomotive]]s. The complex also included a school for train drivers, and naval engineers and, thanks to this school, the kingdom was able to replace the English personnel who had been necessary until then. The first [[steamboat]] with [[propellor|screw propulsion]] known in the Mediterranean Sea was the \"Giglio delle Onde\", with mail delivery and passenger transport purposes after 1847.\n\nIn Calabria, the Fonderia Ferdinandea was a large [[foundry]] where cast iron was produced. The [[Reali ferriere ed Officine di Mongiana]] was an iron foundry and [[weapon]]s factory. Founded in 1770, it employed 1600 workers in 1860 and closed in 1880.  In Sicily (near [[Catania]] and [[Agrigento]]), [[sulfur]] was mined to make [[gunpowder]]. The Sicilian mines were able to satisfy most of the global demand for sulfur. [[Silk]] cloth production was focused in [[San Leucio]] (near [[Caserta]]). The region of [[Basilicata]] also had several mills in [[Potenza]] and [[San Chirico Raparo]], where [[cotton]], [[wool]] and silk were processed.  [[food industry|Food processing]] was widespread, especially near [[Naples]] ([[Torre Annunziata]] and [[Gragnano]]).<!-- Deleted because just too incredible and unsourced.

In [[Industrial Revolution|industrializing]] Britain, with the repeal of [[Tariff|tariffs]] on salt in 1824, demand for sulfur from Sicily surged upward. The increasing British control and exploitation of the mining, refining, and transportation of the sulfur, coupled with the failure of this lucrative export to transform Sicily's backward and impoverished economy, led to the 'Sulfur Crisis' of 1840, when [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies|King Ferdinand II]] gave a monopoly of the sulfur industry to a French firm, violating an earlier 1816 trade agreement with Britain. A peaceful solution was eventually negotiated by France.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thomson|first1=D.

Emulsions are part of a more general class of two-phase systems of [[matter]] called [[colloid]]s. Although the terms ''colloid'' and ''emulsion'' are sometimes used interchangeably, ''emulsion'' should be used when both phases, dispersed and continuous, are liquids. In an emulsion, one liquid (the dispersed [[phase (matter)|phase]]) is [[dispersion (chemistry)|dispersed]] in the other (the continuous phase). Examples of emulsions include [[vinaigrette]]s, homogenized [[milk]], and some [[cutting fluid]]s for [[metal working]]. \n\nTwo liquids can form different types of emulsions. As an example, oil and water can form, first, an oil-in-water emulsion, wherein the oil is the dispersed phase, and water is the continuous phase. ([[Lipoproteins]], used by all complex living organisms, are one example of this.) Second, they can form a water-in-oil emulsion, wherein water is the dispersed phase and oil is the continuous phase. Multiple emulsions are also possible, including a \"water-in-oil-in-water\" emulsion and an \"oil-in-water-in-oil\" emulsion.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=17076645 |year=2006 |last1=Khan |first1=A.

The droplets dispersed in the continuous phase (sometimes referred to as the \u201cdispersion medium\u201d) are usually assumed to be [[Probability distribution|statistically distributed]].\n\nThe term \"emulsion\" is also used to refer to the photo-sensitive side of [[photographic film]]. Such a [[photographic emulsion]] consists of [[silver halide]] colloidal particles dispersed in a [[gelatin]] matrix. [[Nuclear emulsion]]s are similar to photographic emulsions, except that they are used in particle physics to detect high-energy [[elementary particle]]s.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"emulsion\" comes from the Latin ''emulgere'' \"to milk out,\" from ''ex'' \"out\" + ''mulgere'' \"to milk\", as milk is an emulsion of fat and water, along with other components.<ref name=\"OnlineEtymol\">{{cite web |last1=Harper |first1=Douglas |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |url=https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=emulsion |website=www..etymonline.com |publisher=Etymonline |accessdate=2 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Appearance and properties==\n{{Quote box\n |title =[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] definition\n |quote = Fluid system in which liquid droplets are dispersed in a liquid.\n\n''Note 1'': The definition is based on the definition in ref.<ref>{{cite book|title=Compendium of Chemical Terminology (The \"Gold Book\")|year=1997|publisher=[[Blackwell Scientific Publications]]|location=Oxford|author=IUPAC|chapter-url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/E02065.html|url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120310221658/http://goldbook.iupac.org/E02065.html|archivedate=2012-03-10 |doi=10.1351/goldbook.E02065 |chapter=Emulsion|isbn=978-0-9678550-9-7}}</ref>\n\n''Note 2'': The droplets may be amorphous, liquid-crystalline, or any<br/>mixture thereof.\n\n''Note 3'': The diameters of the droplets constituting the ''[[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersed phase]]''<br/>usually range from approximately 10&nbsp;nm to 100&nbsp;\u03bcm; i.e., the droplets<br/>may exceed the usual size limits for [[colloid]]al particles.\n\n''Note 4'': An emulsion is termed an oil/water (o/w) emulsion if the<br/>dispersed phase is an organic material and the ''continuous phase'' is<br/>water or an aqueous solution and is termed water/oil (w/o) if the dispersed<br/>phase is water or an aqueous solution and the continuous phase is an<br/>organic liquid (an \"oil\").\n\n''Note 5'': A w/o emulsion is sometimes called an inverse emulsion.<br/>The term \"inverse emulsion\" is misleading, suggesting incorrectly that<br/>the emulsion has properties that are the opposite of those of an emulsion.<br/>Its use is, therefore, not recommended.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Terminology of polymers and polymerization processes in dispersed systems (IUPAC Recommendations 2011)|journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]]|year=2011|volume=83|issue=12|pages=2229\u20132259|doi=10.1351/PAC-REC-10-06-03 |last1=Slomkowski |first1=Stanislaw |last2=Alem\u00e1n|first2=Jos\u00e9 V.|last3=Gilbert|first3=Robert G. |last4=Hess |first4=Michael |last5=Horie |first5=Kazuyuki |last6=Jones |first6=Richard G. |last7=Kubisa |first7=Przemyslaw |last8=Meisel |first8=Ingrid |last9=Mormann |first9=Werner |last10=Penczek |first10=Stanis\u0142aw |last11=Stepto|first11=Robert F.

Because of many undesirable side-effects caused by surfactants, their presence is disadvantageous or prohibitive in many applications. In addition, the stability of a microemulsion is often easily compromised by dilution, by heating, or by changing pH levels.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}\n\nCommon emulsions are inherently unstable and, thus, do not tend to form spontaneously.

Over time, emulsions tend to revert to the stable state of the phases comprising the emulsion.

Emulsifiers and emulsifying particles tend to promote dispersion of the phase in which they do not dissolve very well.

One class of emulsifiers is known as \"surface active agents\", or [[surfactant]]s. Emulsifiers are compounds that typically have a polar or hydrophilic (i.e. water-soluble) part and a non-polar (i.e. hydrophobic or lipophilic) part. Because of this, emulsifiers tend to have more or less solubility either in water or in oil.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}} Emulsifiers that are more soluble in water (and conversely, less soluble in oil) will generally form oil-in-water emulsions, while emulsifiers that are more soluble in oil will form water-in-oil emulsions. <ref>Cassiday, L.

A well-known example of this phenomenon, the \"[[ouzo effect]]\", happens when water is poured into a strong alcoholic [[anise]]-based beverage, such as [[ouzo]], [[pastis]], [[absinthe]], [[Arak (distilled beverage)|arak]], or [[Rak\u0131|raki]]. The anisolic compounds, which are soluble in [[ethanol]], then form nano-size droplets and emulsify within the water. The resulting color of the drink is opaque and milky white.\n\n==Mechanisms of emulsification==\nA number of different chemical and physical processes and mechanisms can be involved in the process of emulsification:{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}\n\n* Surface tension theory \u2013 according to this theory, emulsification takes place by reduction of interfacial tension between two phases\n* Repulsion theory \u2013 the emulsifying agent creates a film over one phase that forms globules, which repel each other. This repulsive force causes them to remain suspended in the dispersion medium\n* Viscosity modification \u2013 emulgents like [[Gum arabic|acacia]] and [[tragacanth]], which are hydrocolloids, as well as PEG (or [[polyethylene glycol]]), glycerine, and other polymers like CMC ([[carboxymethyl cellulose]]), all increase the viscosity of the medium, which helps create and maintain the suspension of globules of dispersed phase\n\n==Uses==\n\n===In food===\nOil-in-water emulsions are common in food products:\n* Crema (foam) in [[espresso]] \u2013 coffee oil in water (brewed coffee), unstable emulsion\n* [[Mayonnaise]] and [[Hollandaise sauce]]s \u2013 these are oil-in-water emulsions stabilized with egg yolk [[lecithin]], or with other types of food additives, such as [[sodium stearoyl lactylate]]\n* [[Homogenized milk]] \u2013 an emulsion of milk fat in water, with milk proteins as the emulsifier \u2013 an emulsion of vegetable oil in vinegar, if this is prepared using only oil and vinegar (i.e., without an emulsifier), an unstable emulsion results\n\nWater-in-oil emulsions are less common in food, but still exist:\n* [[Butter]] \u2013 an emulsion of water in butterfat\n* [[Margarine]]\n\nOther foods can be turned into products similar to emulsions, for example [[meat emulsion]] is a suspension of meat in liquid that is similar to true emulsions.\n\n===Health care===\nIn [[pharmaceutics]], [[Hairstyling product|hairstyling]], [[personal hygiene]], and [[cosmetics]], emulsions are frequently used.

The smaller the droplet the greater the [[surface tension]] and thus the greater the force required to merge with other [[lipids]]. The oil is emulsified with detergents using a [[high-shear mixer]] to stabilize the emulsion so, when they encounter the lipids in the [[cell membrane]] or envelope of [[Cell envelope|bacteria]] or [[virus]]es, they force the lipids to merge with themselves. On a mass scale, in effect this disintegrates the membrane and kills the pathogen. The soybean oil emulsion does not harm normal human cells, or the cells of most other [[higher organisms]], with the exceptions of [[Spermatozoon|sperm cells]] and [[blood cells]], which are vulnerable to nanoemulsions due to the peculiarities of their membrane structures.

Such agents encapsulate the fuel in a fuel-water emulsion, thereby trapping the flammable vapors in the water phase. This emulsion is achieved by applying an [[Aqueous solution|aqueous]] surfactant solution to the fuel through a high-pressure nozzle. Emulsifiers are not effective at extinguishing large fires involving bulk/deep liquid fuels, because the amount of emulsifier agent needed for extinguishment is a function of the volume of the fuel, whereas other agents such as [[Fire-fighting foam|aqueous film-forming foam]] <!-- (AFFF) --> need cover only the surface of the fuel to achieve vapor mitigation.<ref>{{cite book|title=Principles of Fire Protection Chemistry and Physics |author=Friedman, Raymond |isbn= 978-0-87765-440-7|year=1998|publisher=[[Jones & Bartlett Learning]]}}</ref>\n\n===Chemical synthesis===\n{{main|Emulsion polymerization}}\nEmulsions are used to manufacture polymer dispersions \u2013 polymer production in an emulsion 'phase' has a number of process advantages, including prevention of coagulation of product.

Emulsions are part of a more general class of two-phase systems of [[matter]] called [[colloid]]s.

In an emulsion, one liquid (the dispersed [[phase (matter)|phase]]) is [[dispersion (chemistry)|dispersed]] in the other (the continuous phase). Examples of emulsions include [[vinaigrette]]s, homogenized [[milk]], and some [[cutting fluid]]s for [[metal working]]. \n\nThe word \"emulsion\" comes from the Latin ''emulgere'' \"to milk out,\" from ''ex'' \"out\" + ''mulgere'' \"to milk\", as milk is an emulsion of fat and water, along with other components.<ref name=\"OnlineEtymol\">{{cite web |last1=Harper |first1=Douglas |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |url=https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=emulsion |website=www..etymonline.com |publisher=Etymonline |accessdate=2 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nTwo liquids can form different types of emulsions. As an example, oil and water can form, first, an oil-in-water emulsion, wherein the oil is the dispersed phase, and water is the continuous phase. ([[Lipoproteins]], used by all complex living organisms, are one example of this.) Second, they can form a water-in-oil emulsion, wherein water is the dispersed phase and oil is the continuous phase.

Emulsifiers and emulsifying particles tend to promote dispersion of the phase in which they do not dissolve very well.

One class of emulsifiers is known as \"surface active agents\", or [[surfactant]]s. Emulsifiers are compounds that typically have a polar or hydrophilic (i.e. water-soluble) part and a non-polar (i.e. hydrophobic or lipophilic) part. Because of this, emulsifiers tend to have more or less solubility either in water or in oil.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}} Emulsifiers that are more soluble in water (and conversely, less soluble in oil) will generally form oil-in-water emulsions, while emulsifiers that are more soluble in oil will form water-in-oil emulsions. <ref>Cassiday, L.

A well-known example of this phenomenon, the \"[[ouzo effect]]\", happens when water is poured into a strong alcoholic [[anise]]-based beverage, such as [[ouzo]], [[pastis]], [[absinthe]], [[Arak (distilled beverage)|arak]], or [[Rak\u0131|raki]]. The anisolic compounds, which are soluble in [[ethanol]], then form nano-size droplets and emulsify within the water. The resulting color of the drink is opaque and milky white.\n\n==Mechanisms of emulsification==\nA number of different chemical and physical processes and mechanisms can be involved in the process of emulsification:{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}\n\n* Surface tension theory \u2013 according to this theory, emulsification takes place by reduction of interfacial tension between two phases\n* Repulsion theory \u2013 the emulsifying agent creates a film over one phase that forms globules, which repel each other. This repulsive force causes them to remain suspended in the dispersion medium\n* Viscosity modification \u2013 emulgents like [[Gum arabic|acacia]] and [[tragacanth]], which are hydrocolloids, as well as PEG (or [[polyethylene glycol]]), glycerine, and other polymers like CMC ([[carboxymethyl cellulose]]), all increase the viscosity of the medium, which helps create and maintain the suspension of globules of dispersed phase\n\n==Uses==\n\n===In food===\nOil-in-water emulsions are common in food products:\n* Crema (foam) in [[espresso]] \u2013 coffee oil in water (brewed coffee), unstable emulsion\n* [[Mayonnaise]] and [[Hollandaise sauce]]s \u2013 these are oil-in-water emulsions stabilized with egg yolk [[lecithin]], or with other types of food additives, such as [[sodium stearoyl lactylate]]\n* [[Homogenized milk]] \u2013 an emulsion of milk fat in water, with milk proteins as the emulsifier \u2013 an emulsion of vegetable oil in vinegar, if this is prepared using only oil and vinegar (i.e., without an emulsifier), an unstable emulsion results\n\nWater-in-oil emulsions are less common in food, but still exist:\n* [[Butter]] \u2013 an emulsion of water in butterfat\n* [[Margarine]]\n\nOther foods can be turned into products similar to emulsions, for example [[meat emulsion]] is a suspension of meat in liquid that is similar to true emulsions.\n\n===Health care===\nIn [[pharmaceutics]], [[Hairstyling product|hairstyling]], [[personal hygiene]], and [[cosmetics]], emulsions are frequently used. These are usually oil and water emulsions but dispersed, and which is continuous depends in many cases on the [[pharmaceutical formulation]]. These emulsions may be called [[cream (pharmaceutical)|cream]]s, [[ointment]]s, [[liniment]]s (balms), [[paste (rheology)|paste]]s, [[Thin film|film]]s, or [[liquid]]s, depending mostly on their oil-to-water ratios, other additives, and their intended [[route of administration]].<ref name=\"Aulton\">{{cite book|editor=Aulton, Michael E.|edition=3rd|title=Aulton's Pharmaceutics: The Design and Manufacture of Medicines|publisher=[[Churchill Livingstone]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-443-10108-3|pages=92\u201397, 384, 390\u2013405, 566\u201369, 573\u201374, 589\u201396, 609\u201310, 611}}</ref><ref name=\"Remington\">{{Cite book|last1=Troy|first1=David A.|last2=Remington|first2=Joseph P.|last3=Beringer|first3=Paul|title=Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy|edition=21st|year=2006|publisher=[[Lippincott Williams & Wilkins]]|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-7817-4673-1|pages=325\u2013336, 886\u201387}}</ref> The first 5 are [[topical]] [[dosage form]]s, and may be used on the surface of the [[human skin|skin]], [[transdermal]]ly, [[Eye drop|ophthalmically]], [[rectal]]ly, or [[vagina]]lly.

The smaller the droplet the greater the [[surface tension]] and thus the greater the force required to merge with other [[lipids]]. The oil is emulsified with detergents using a [[high-shear mixer]] to stabilize the emulsion so, when they encounter the lipids in the [[cell membrane]] or envelope of [[Cell envelope|bacteria]] or [[virus]]es, they force the lipids to merge with themselves. On a mass scale, in effect this disintegrates the membrane and kills the pathogen. The soybean oil emulsion does not harm normal human cells, or the cells of most other [[higher organisms]], with the exceptions of [[Spermatozoon|sperm cells]] and [[blood cells]], which are vulnerable to nanoemulsions due to the peculiarities of their membrane structures. For this reason, these nanoemulsions are not currently used [[intravenous]]ly (IV). The most effective application of this type of nanoemulsion is for the [[disinfection]] of surfaces.

Such agents encapsulate the fuel in a fuel-water emulsion, thereby trapping the flammable vapors in the water phase. This emulsion is achieved by applying an [[Aqueous solution|aqueous]] surfactant solution to the fuel through a high-pressure nozzle. Emulsifiers are not effective at extinguishing large fires involving bulk/deep liquid fuels, because the amount of emulsifier agent needed for extinguishment is a function of the volume of the fuel, whereas other agents such as [[Fire-fighting foam|aqueous film-forming foam]] <!-- (AFFF) --> need cover only the surface of the fuel to achieve vapor mitigation.<ref>{{cite book|title=Principles of Fire Protection Chemistry and Physics |author=Friedman, Raymond |isbn= 978-0-87765-440-7|year=1998|publisher=[[Jones & Bartlett Learning]]}}</ref>\n\n===Chemical synthesis===\n{{main|Emulsion polymerization}}\nEmulsions are used to manufacture polymer dispersions \u2013 polymer production in an emulsion 'phase' has a number of process advantages, including prevention of coagulation of product.

This algorithm assumes that the user is not interested in the values of <math>\\overrightarrow{x}</math> itself, but rather the result of applying some operator <math>M</math> onto x, <math>\\langle x|M|x\\rangle</math>.\n\nFirst, the algorithm represents the vector <math>\\overrightarrow{b}</math> as a [[quantum state]] of the form:\n: <math>|b\\rangle=\\sum_{i \\mathop =1}^N b_i|i\\rangle.</math>\n\nNext, Hamiltonian simulation techniques are used to apply the unitary operator <math>e^{iAt}</math> to <math>|b\\rangle</math> for a superposition of different times <math>t</math>. The ability to decompose <math>|b\\rangle</math> into the eigenbasis of <math>A</math> and to find the corresponding eigenvalues <math>\\lambda_j</math> is facilitated by the use of [[quantum phase estimation]].\n\nThe state of the system after this decomposition is approximately:\n:<math>\\sum_{j \\mathop =1}^N \\beta_j|u_j\\rangle|\\lambda_j\\rangle,</math>\n\nwhere <math>u_j</math> is the eigenvector basis of <math>A</math>, and <math>|b\\rangle=\\sum_{j \\mathop =1}^N \\beta_j|u_j\\rangle</math>.\n\nWe would then like to perform the linear map taking <math>|\\lambda_j\\rangle</math> to <math>C\\lambda^{-1}_j|\\lambda_j\\rangle</math>, where <math>C</math> is a normalizing constant. The linear mapping operation is not unitary and thus will require a number of repetitions as it has some probability of failing. After it succeeds, we uncompute the <math>|\\lambda_j\\rangle</math> register and are left with a state proportional to:\n\n: <math>\\sum_{i \\mathop =1}^N \\beta_i\\lambda^{-1}_j|u_j\\rangle=A^{-1}|b\\rangle=|x\\rangle,</math>\n\nwhere <math>|x\\rangle</math> is a quantum-mechanical representation of the desired solution vector&nbsp;''x''. To read out all components of ''x'' would require the procedure be repeated at least ''N'' times. However, it is often the case that one is not interested in <math>x</math> itself, but rather some expectation value of a linear operator ''M'' acting on&nbsp;''x''. By mapping ''M'' to a quantum-mechanical operator and performing the quantum measurement corresponding to ''M'', we obtain an estimate of the expectation value <math>\\langle x|M|x\\rangle</math>. This allows for a wide variety of features of the vector ''x'' to be extracted including normalization, weights in different parts of the state space, and moments without actually computing all the values of the solution vector&nbsp;''x''.\n\n== Explanation of the algorithm ==\n\n=== Initialization ===\nFirstly, the algorithm requires that the matrix <math>A</math> be [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]] so that it can be converted into a [[unitary operator]]. In the case where <math>A</math> is not Hermitian, define \n:<math>\\mathbf{C} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n     0 & A \\\\\n     A^t & 0  \n  \\end{bmatrix}. </math>\n\nAs <math>C</math> is Hermitian, the algorithm can now be used to solve <math>Cy=\\begin{bmatrix}\n     b \\\\\n     0  \n  \\end{bmatrix}. </math> to obtain <math>y = \\begin{bmatrix}\n     0 \\\\\n     x  \n  \\end{bmatrix} </math>.\n\nSecondly, The algorithm requires an efficient procedure to prepare <math>|b\\rangle</math>, the quantum representation of b. It is assumed that there exists some linear operator <math>B</math> that can take some arbitrary quantum state <math>|\\mathrm{initial}\\rangle</math> to <math>|b\\rangle</math> efficiently or that this algorithm is a subroutine in a larger algorithm and is given <math>|b\\rangle</math> as input. Any error in the preparation of state <math>|b\\rangle</math> is ignored.\n\nFinally, the algorithm assumes that the state <math>| \\psi_0 \\rangle </math> can be prepared efficiently. Where\n\n: <math>| \\psi_0 \\rangle := \\sqrt{2/T} \\sum_{\\tau \\mathop =0}^{T-1} \\sin\\pi\\left(\\tfrac{\\tau+\\tfrac{1}{2}}{T}\\right) |\\tau\\rangle</math>\n\nfor some large <math>T</math>. The coefficients of <math>| \\psi_0 \\rangle </math> are chosen to minimize a certain quadratic loss function which induces error in the <math>U_\\mathrm{invert}</math> subroutine described below.\n\n=== Hamiltonian simulation ===\n[[Hamiltonian simulation]] is used to transform the Hermitian matrix <math>A</math> into a unitary operator, which can then be applied at will. This is possible if ''A'' is ''s''-sparse and efficiently row computable, meaning it has at most ''s'' nonzero entries per row and given a row index these entries can be computed in time&nbsp;O(''s''). Under these assumptions, quantum Hamiltonian simulation allows <math>e^{iAt}</math> to be simulated in time <math>O(\\log(N)s^2t)</math>.\n\n=== <math>U_\\mathrm{invert}</math> subroutine ===\nThe key subroutine to the algorithm, denoted <math>U_\\mathrm{invert}</math>, is defined as follows and incorporates a [[phase estimation]] subroutine:\n\n1. Prepare <math>|\\psi_0\\rangle^C</math> on register ''C''\n\n2. Apply the conditional Hamiltonian evolution (sum)\n\n3. Apply the Fourier transform to the register&nbsp;''C''. Denote the resulting basis states with <math>|k\\rangle</math> for ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''T''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1. Define <math>\\lambda_k:=2\\pi k/t_0</math>.\n\n4. Adjoin a three-dimensional register ''S'' in the state\n: <math>|h(\\lambda_k)\\rangle^S := \\sqrt{1-f(\\lambda_k)^2 - g(\\lambda_k)^2} |\\mathrm{nothing} \\rangle^S + f(\\lambda_k)| \\mathrm{well} \\rangle^S+g (\\lambda_k) | \\mathrm{ill} \\rangle^S, </math>\n\n5. Reverse steps 1\u20133, uncomputing any garbage produced along the way.\n\nThe phase estimation procedure in steps 1-3 allows for the estimation of eigenvalues of ''A'' up to error <math>\\epsilon</math>.\n\nThe ancilla register in step 4 is necessary to construct a final state with inverted eigenvalues corresponding to the diagonalized inverse of ''A''.  In this register, the functions ''f'', ''g'', are called filter functions. The states 'nothing', 'well' and 'ill' are used to instruct the loop body on how to proceed; 'nothing' indicates that the desired matrix inversion has not yet taken place, 'well' indicates that the inversion has taken place and the loop should halt, and 'ill' indicates that part of <math>|b\\rangle</math> is in the ill-conditioned subspace of ''A'' and the algorithm will not be able to produce the desired inversion. Producing a state proportional to the inverse of ''A'' requires 'well' to be measured, after which the overall state of the system collapses to the desired state by the extended [[Born rule]].\n\n=== Main loop ===\nThe body of the algorithm follows the [[amplitude amplification]] procedure: starting with <math>U_\\mathrm{invert}B|\\mathrm{initial}\\rangle</math>, the following operation is repeatedly applied:\n\n: <math>U_\\mathrm{invert}BR_\\mathrm{init}B^\\dagger U^\\dagger_\\mathrm{invert}R_\\mathrm{succ}</math>\n\nwhere\n\n: <math>R_\\mathrm{succ}=I-2|\\mathrm{well}\\rangle\\langle \\mathrm{well}|,</math>\n\nand\n\n: <math>R_\\mathrm{init}=I-2|\\mathrm{initial}\\rangle\\langle\\mathrm{initial}|.</math>\n\nAfter each repetition, <math>S</math> is measured and will produce a value of 'nothing', 'well', or 'ill' as described above. This loop is repeated until <math>S</math> is measured, which occurs with a probability <math>p</math>. Rather than repeating <math>\\frac{1}{p}</math> times to minimize error, amplitude amplification is used to achieve the same error resilience using only <math>O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{p}}\\right)</math> repetitions.\n\n=== Scalar measurement ===\nAfter successfully measuring 'well' on <math>S</math> the system will be in a state proportional to:\n\n: <math>\\sum_{i \\mathop =1}^N \\beta_i \\lambda^{-1}_j |u_j\\rangle = A^{-1} |b \\rangle = | x\\rangle.</math>\n\nFinally, we perform the quantum-mechanical operator corresponding to M and obtain an estimate of the value of <math>\\langle x|M|x\\rangle</math>.\n\n== Run time analysis ==\n\n=== Classical efficiency ===\nThe best classical algorithm which produces the actual solution vector <math>\\overrightarrow{x}</math> is [[Gaussian elimination]], which runs in <math>O(N^3)</math> time.\n\nIf ''A'' is ''s''-sparse and positive semi-definite, then the [[Conjugate Gradient method]] can be used to find the solution vector <math>\\overrightarrow{x}</math>, which can be found in <math>O(Ns\\kappa)</math> time by minimizing the quadratic function <math>|A\\overrightarrow{x} -\\overrightarrow{b}|^2</math>.\n\nWhen only a summary statistic of the solution vector <math>\\overrightarrow{x}</math> is needed, as is the case for the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations, a classical computer can find an estimate of <math>\\overrightarrow{x}^\\dagger M \\overrightarrow{x}</math> in <math>O(N\\sqrt{\\kappa})</math>.\n\n=== Quantum efficiency ===\nThe runtime of the quantum algorithm for solving systems of linear equations originally proposed by Harrow et al. was shown to be <math>O(\\kappa^2\\log N/\\varepsilon)</math>, where  <math>\\varepsilon>0</math> is the error parameter and <math>\\kappa</math> is the [[condition number]] of <math>A</math>.

For certain problems, quantum algorithms supply exponential speedups over their classical counterparts, the most famous example being Shor's factoring algorithm. Few such exponential speedups are known, and those that are (such as the use of quantum computers to simulate other quantum systems) have so far found limited use outside the domain of quantum mechanics. This algorithm provides an exponentially faster method of estimating features of the solution of a set of linear equations, which is a problem ubiquitous in science and engineering, both on its own and as a subroutine in more complex problems.\n\n=== Electromagnetic scattering ===\nClader et al. provided a preconditioned version of the linear systems algorithm that provided two advances. First, they demonstrated how a [[preconditioner]] could be included within the quantum algorithm. This expands the class of problems that can achieve the promised exponential speedup, since the scaling of HHL and the best classical algorithms are both polynomial in the [[condition number]]. The second advance was the demonstration of how to use HHL to solve for the [[radar cross-section]] of a complex shape.

This algorithm assumes that the user is not interested in the values of <math>\\overrightarrow{x}</math> itself, but rather the result of applying some operator <math>M</math> onto x, <math>\\langle x|M|x\\rangle</math>.\n\nFirst, the algorithm represents the vector <math>\\overrightarrow{b}</math> as a [[quantum state]] of the form:\n: <math>|b\\rangle=\\sum_{i \\mathop =1}^N b_i|i\\rangle.</math>\n\nNext, Hamiltonian simulation techniques are used to apply the unitary operator <math>e^{iAt}</math> to <math>|b\\rangle</math> for a superposition of different times <math>t</math>. The ability to decompose <math>|b\\rangle</math> into the eigenbasis of <math>A</math> and to find the corresponding eigenvalues <math>\\lambda_j</math> is facilitated by the use of [[quantum phase estimation]].\n\nThe state of the system after this decomposition is approximately:\n:<math>\\sum_{j \\mathop =1}^N \\beta_j|u_j\\rangle|\\lambda_j\\rangle,</math>\n\nwhere <math>u_j</math> is the eigenvector basis of <math>A</math>, and <math>|b\\rangle=\\sum_{j \\mathop =1}^N \\beta_j|u_j\\rangle</math>.\n\nWe would then like to perform the linear map taking <math>|\\lambda_j\\rangle</math> to <math>C\\lambda^{-1}_j|\\lambda_j\\rangle</math>, where <math>C</math> is a normalizing constant. The linear mapping operation is not unitary and thus will require a number of repetitions as it has some probability of failing. After it succeeds, we uncompute the <math>|\\lambda_j\\rangle</math> register and are left with a state proportional to:\n\n: <math>\\sum_{i \\mathop =1}^N \\beta_i\\lambda^{-1}_j|u_j\\rangle=A^{-1}|b\\rangle=|x\\rangle,</math>\n\nwhere <math>|x\\rangle</math> is a quantum-mechanical representation of the desired solution vector&nbsp;''x''. To read out all components of ''x'' would require the procedure be repeated at least ''N'' times. However, it is often the case that one is not interested in <math>x</math> itself, but rather some expectation value of a linear operator ''M'' acting on&nbsp;''x''. By mapping ''M'' to a quantum-mechanical operator and performing the quantum measurement corresponding to ''M'', we obtain an estimate of the expectation value <math>\\langle x|M|x\\rangle</math>. This allows for a wide variety of features of the vector ''x'' to be extracted including normalization, weights in different parts of the state space, and moments without actually computing all the values of the solution vector&nbsp;''x''.\n\n== Explanation of the algorithm ==\n\n=== Initialization ===\n\nFirstly, the algorithm requires that the matrix <math>A</math> be [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]] so that it can be converted into a [[unitary operator]]. In the case where <math>A</math> is not Hermitian, define \n:<math>\\mathbf{C} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n     0 & A \\\\\n     A^t & 0  \n  \\end{bmatrix}. </math>\n\nAs <math>C</math> is Hermitian, the algorithm can now be used to solve <math>Cy=\\begin{bmatrix}\n     b \\\\\n     0  \n  \\end{bmatrix}. </math> to obtain <math>y = \\begin{bmatrix}\n     0 \\\\\n     x  \n  \\end{bmatrix} </math>.\n\nSecondly, The algorithm requires an efficient procedure to prepare <math>|b\\rangle</math>, the quantum representation of b. It is assumed that there exists some linear operator <math>B</math> that can take some arbitrary quantum state <math>|\\mathrm{initial}\\rangle</math> to <math>|b\\rangle</math> efficiently or that this algorithm is a subroutine in a larger algorithm and is given <math>|b\\rangle</math> as input. Any error in the preparation of state <math>|b\\rangle</math> is ignored.\n\nFinally, the algorithm assumes that the state <math>| \\psi_0 \\rangle </math> can be prepared efficiently. Where\n\n: <math>| \\psi_0 \\rangle := \\sqrt{2/T} \\sum_{\\tau \\mathop =0}^{T-1} \\sin\\pi\\left(\\tfrac{\\tau+\\tfrac{1}{2}}{T}\\right) |\\tau\\rangle</math>\n\nfor some large <math>T</math>. The coefficients of <math>| \\psi_0 \\rangle </math> are chosen to minimize a certain quadratic loss function which induces error in the <math>U_\\mathrm{invert}</math> subroutine described below.\n\n=== Hamiltonian simulation ===\n\n[[Hamiltonian simulation]] is used to transform the Hermitian matrix <math>A</math> into a unitary operator, which can then be applied at will. This is possible if ''A'' is ''s''-sparse and efficiently row computable, meaning it has at most ''s'' nonzero entries per row and given a row index these entries can be computed in time&nbsp;O(''s''). Under these assumptions, quantum Hamiltonian simulation allows <math>e^{iAt}</math> to be simulated in time <math>O(\\log(N)s^2t)</math>.\n\n=== <math>U_\\mathrm{invert}</math> subroutine ===\nThe key subroutine to the algorithm, denoted <math>U_\\mathrm{invert}</math>, is defined as follows and incorporates a [[phase estimation]] subroutine:\n\n1. Prepare <math>|\\psi_0\\rangle^C</math> on register ''C''\n\n2. Apply the conditional Hamiltonian evolution (sum)\n\n3. Apply the Fourier transform to the register&nbsp;''C''. Denote the resulting basis states with <math>|k\\rangle</math> for ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''T''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1. Define <math>\\lambda_k:=2\\pi k/t_0</math>.\n\n4. Adjoin a three-dimensional register ''S'' in the state\n: <math>|h(\\lambda_k)\\rangle^S := \\sqrt{1-f(\\lambda_k)^2 - g(\\lambda_k)^2} |\\mathrm{nothing} \\rangle^S + f(\\lambda_k)| \\mathrm{well} \\rangle^S+g (\\lambda_k) | \\mathrm{ill} \\rangle^S, </math>\n\n5. Reverse steps 1\u20133, uncomputing any garbage produced along the way.\n\nThe phase estimation procedure in steps 1-3 allows for the estimation of eigenvalues of ''A'' up to error <math>\\epsilon</math>.\n\nThe ancilla register in step 4 is necessary to construct a final state with inverted eigenvalues corresponding to the diagonalized inverse of ''A''.  In this register, the functions ''f'', ''g'', are called filter functions. The states 'nothing', 'well' and 'ill' are used to instruct the loop body on how to proceed; 'nothing' indicates that the desired matrix inversion has not yet taken place, 'well' indicates that the inversion has taken place and the loop should halt, and 'ill' indicates that part of <math>|b\\rangle</math> is in the ill-conditioned subspace of ''A'' and the algorithm will not be able to produce the desired inversion. Producing a state proportional to the inverse of ''A'' requires 'well' to be measured, after which the overall state of the system collapses to the desired state by the extended [[Born rule]].\n\n=== Main loop ===\n\nThe body of the algorithm follows the [[amplitude amplification]] procedure: starting with <math>U_\\mathrm{invert}B|\\mathrm{initial}\\rangle</math>, the following operation is repeatedly applied:\n\n: <math>U_\\mathrm{invert}BR_\\mathrm{init}B^\\dagger U^\\dagger_\\mathrm{invert}R_\\mathrm{succ}</math>\n\nwhere\n\n: <math>R_\\mathrm{succ}=I-2|\\mathrm{well}\\rangle\\langle \\mathrm{well}|,</math>\n\nand\n\n: <math>R_\\mathrm{init}=I-2|\\mathrm{initial}\\rangle\\langle\\mathrm{initial}|.</math>\n\nAfter each repetition, <math>S</math> is measured and will produce a value of 'nothing', 'well', or 'ill' as described above. This loop is repeated until <math>S</math> is measured, which occurs with a probability <math>p</math>. Rather than repeating <math>\\frac{1}{p}</math> times to minimize error, amplitude amplification is used to achieve the same error resilience using only <math>O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{p}}\\right)</math> repetitions.\n\n=== Scalar measurement ===\n\nAfter successfully measuring 'well' on <math>S</math> the system will be in a state proportional to:\n\n: <math>\\sum_{i \\mathop =1}^N \\beta_i \\lambda^{-1}_j |u_j\\rangle = A^{-1} |b \\rangle = | x\\rangle.</math>\n\nFinally, we perform the quantum-mechanical operator corresponding to M and obtain an estimate of the value of <math>\\langle x|M|x\\rangle</math>.\n\n== Run time analysis ==\n\n=== Classical efficiency ===\n\nThe best classical algorithm which produces the actual solution vector <math>\\overrightarrow{x}</math> is [[Gaussian elimination]], which runs in <math>O(N^3)</math> time.\n\nIf ''A'' is ''s''-sparse and positive semi-definite, then the [[Conjugate Gradient method]] can be used to find the solution vector <math>\\overrightarrow{x}</math>, which can be found in <math>O(Ns\\kappa)</math> time by minimizing the quadratic function <math>|A\\overrightarrow{x} -\\overrightarrow{b}|^2</math>.\n\nWhen only a summary statistic of the solution vector <math>\\overrightarrow{x}</math> is needed, as is the case for the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations, a classical computer can find an estimate of <math>\\overrightarrow{x}^\\dagger M \\overrightarrow{x}</math> in <math>O(N\\sqrt{\\kappa})</math>.\n\n=== Quantum efficiency ===\n\nThe runtime of the quantum algorithm for solving systems of linear equations originally proposed by Harrow et al. was shown to be <math>O(\\kappa^2\\log N/\\varepsilon)</math>, where  <math>\\varepsilon>0</math> is the error parameter and <math>\\kappa</math> is the [[condition number]] of <math>A</math>.

The quantum circuit is optimized and compiled into a linear optical network with four photonic quantum bits (qubits) and four controlled logic gates, which is used to coherently implement every subroutine for this algorithm.

For certain problems, quantum algorithms supply exponential speedups over their classical counterparts, the most famous example being Shor's factoring algorithm. Few such exponential speedups are known, and those that are (such as the use of quantum computers to simulate other quantum systems) have so far found limited use outside the domain of quantum mechanics. This algorithm provides an exponentially faster method of estimating features of the solution of a set of linear equations, which is a problem ubiquitous in science and engineering, both on its own and as a subroutine in more complex problems.\n\n=== Electromagnetic scattering ===\nClader et al. provided a preconditioned version of the linear systems algorithm that provided two advances. First, they demonstrated how a [[preconditioner]] could be included within the quantum algorithm. This expands the class of problems that can achieve the promised exponential speedup, since the scaling of HHL and the best classical algorithms are both polynomial in the [[condition number]]. The second advance was the demonstration of how to use HHL to solve for the [[radar cross-section]] of a complex shape. This was one of the first end to end examples of how to use HHL to solve a concrete problem exponentially faster than the best known classical algorithm. <ref name=\"Preconditioned quantum linear system algorithm by Clader et al.\">{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.250504|pmid = 23829722|title = Preconditioned Quantum Linear System Algorithm|journal = Physical Review Letters|volume = 110|issue = 25|pages = 250504|year = 2013|last1 = Clader|first1 = B.
