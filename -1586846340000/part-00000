She was funded by a ''[[don des vaisseaux]]'' grant by the [[Estates of Brittany]]. <ref name=Roche85 /> She was active in the European theatres of the [[Anglo-French War (1778\u20131783)|Anglo-French War]] and of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], notably taking an important role in the [[Glorious First of June]]. Later, she took part in the  [[Croisi\u00e8re du Grand Hiver]] and was broken up.<ref name=forrer21 />\n\n== Context ==\nThe [[Seven Years' War]] had left the [[French Navy]] severly depleted, and the Crown did not have funds to replace the ships lost during the conflict. In late 1761 [[\u00c9tienne Fran\u00e7ois, duc de Choiseul]] took the direction of the Navy and proposed that the great institutions of France make voluntary donations, a scheme named ''[[don des vaisseaux]]''.

He also reminded of the shortcomings of [[French ship Royal Louis (1759)|''Royal Louis'']], an unsuccessful 100-gun of the time.<ref name=binet222>Binet, p.222</ref> \n\nGroignard hoped to complete construction by 1763, but delay in complete the 1-million load and difficulties in stocking construction wood soon set the schedule back. On 28 March 1763, Groignard sent completed plans to the construction commission, which failed to forward them to Choiseul. On 6 May, Choiseul wrote directly to Groignard to enquire, and setting further requirements that the artillery be set on the three batteries (limiting armament of the castles),<ref name=forrer14>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.14</ref> and that autonomy be sufficient to feed 1,000 men for six months, with water for two.<ref name=binet223>Binet, p.223</ref> By July, construction was expected to be completed in 1765,<ref name=binet225>Binet, p.225</ref> and there were several exchanges of letters and budget estimations between various administrations and rival naval engineers, second-guessing Groignard and arguing about the furniture and spare parts needed for the ship.<ref name=binet228>Binet, p.228</ref> \n\n[[File:Three-decker Bretagne-P4130051.JPG|thumb|left|Depiction on ''Bretagne'' flying the white ensign of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]].]]\nBy 3 January 1764, the Commission was requesting revised versions of the plans as to reduce the dimensions of ''Bretagne''.<ref name=binet231>Binet, p.231</ref> On 23, Groignard submitted his new plans, along with a memorandum underlining that this version would not allow the ship to hold six month worth of food and was compromising her stability, speed and man\u0153uverability; furthermore, he warned that the lower headspace of the gundecks in the smaller project would hinder evacuation of smoke from the guns in combat conditions.<ref name=binet235>Binet, p.235</ref> On 19 February, Choiseul declined to approve the revised plans and requested a third version; Groignard quickly completed the new plans and went directly to Paris himself to submit them, short-circuiting the construction Commission of the Estates of Brittany<ref name=binet237>Binet, p.237</ref> and talking Choiseul out of the notion that the lower battery could be armed with 24-pounders instead of 36-pounders to reduce the cost.<ref name=binet238>Binet, p.238</ref><ref name=forrer14 /> On 7 May, Choiseul informed the Commission that his plans had met with approval and that the construction could begin.<ref name=binet238 />\n\nThe Commission then started procuring the raw materials needed for the construction, notably wood, fabric for the sails, iron and cables. Lacking experience in the matter, it requested advice from Roth, director of the East India Company in Lorient,<ref name=forrer14 /> who replied on 1 April with a long memorandum.<ref name=binet239>Binet, p.239</ref> Besides explaining how to assess the quality of the materials, how to transport it on land and how to store it, the memorandum observed that a number of parts would need to be obtained from outside of Bretagne, and sometimes even abroard, notably from the Netherlands.<ref name=binet240>Binet, p.240</ref> Providers would span from [[Newcastle]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Riga]].<ref name=binet240 />\n\nIn August 1764, Groignard started laying down parts in Lorient shipyard, hoping to take advantage of the summer weather and of a moment of low activity by the East India Company. However, the fluyts needed to transport construction wood were damaged and a lack of wood and nails soon slowed down the work.<ref name=binet242>Binet, p.242</ref> In December, the Estates and the Company signed an understanding that Groignard would have access to the parts and materials stocked in the Company stores, and that the Estates would replenish them within three months.<ref name=binet243>Binet, p.243</ref> On 12 December, the keel was laid down, the bow had been assembled, and the [[Frame (nautical)|frames]] were made and ready to be installed.<ref name=binet244>Binet, p.244</ref>\n\nHowever, on 12 January 1765, the Commission ordered that the construction be halted, <ref name=binet244 /> and summoned Groignard to Nantes.<ref name=binet249>Binet, p.249</ref> Realising its lack of competence, the Commission had decided to cease procuring material directly and to delegate that task to the harbour mandated for the construction, which would be either Lorient or Brest.<ref name=binet250>Binet, p.252</ref> By March, Brest had won the contract; <ref name=binet254>Binet, p.254</ref> the ship was dismantled and her parts were brought to Brest in May 1765.<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /> Groignard remained in charge of the work, <ref name=binet254 /> while the Commission was little involved from then on.<ref name=binet255>Binet, p.255</ref> \n\nOn 5 July 1765, the keel was laid down in Brest<ref name=binet256>Binet, p.256</ref> in the upper dry dock of Pontaniou.<ref name=forrer15>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.15</ref> By mid-July, the framing was completed.<ref name=binet256 /> By mid-September, the hull was [[Caulk|caulked]].<ref name=binet257>Binet, p.257</ref> In late February 1766, carpenters had completed the [[orlop deck]] and were preparing construction of the [[Gun deck|first battery]].<ref name=binet257 /> In April, the sides were completed up to the lower battery, and the decks of the lower and middle batteries were installed.<ref name=binet258>Binet, p.258</ref> On 24 May 1766, ''Bretagne'' was launched.<ref name=binet258 /><ref name=Roche85 />\n\nCompletion of the ship remained slow: <ref name=forrer15 /> although ''Bretagne'' was declared completed on 30 September 1767 <ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /><ref name=forrer15 /> and officially commissioned in 1768,<ref name=binet261>Binet, p.261</ref> work remained to be done to make her sea worthy in June 1770, and she spent the whole year of 1770 fitting out.<ref name=forrer15 /> On 30 November 1771, she was declared in need of an extensive refit.<ref name=forrer15 />\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1773, ''Bretagne'' was listed as serving in the Brest Brigade of the Ponant Division of the Navy.<ref name=binet261 /> However, her state was deteriorating, and harbour director Count de Breugnon sent her to a dry dock, where she entered on 9 August.<ref name=forrer15 /> In 1775, [[Louis Guillouet, comte d'Orvilliers|Orvilliers]] took command of the Brest squadron and, finding her timbers rotten, petitionned [[Antoine de Sartine|Sartine]] for an extensive refit;<ref name=binet261 /><ref name=forrer15 />  reconstruction started on 1 September 1776, taking  480,000 pounds, and ''Bretagne'' was launched on 7 April 1777.

On 28 March 1763, Groignard sent completed plans to the construction commission, which failed to forward them to Choiseul. On 6 May, Choiseul wrote directly to Groignard to enquire, and setting further requirements that the artillery be set on the three batteries (limiting armament of the castles),<ref name=forrer14>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.14</ref> and that autonomy be sufficient to feed 1,000 men for six months, with water for two.<ref name=binet223>Binet, p.223</ref> By July, construction was expected to be completed in 1765,<ref name=binet225>Binet, p.225</ref> and there were several exchanges of letters and budget estimations between various administrations and rival naval engineers, second-guessing Groignard and arguing about the furniture and spare parts needed for the ship.<ref name=binet228>Binet, p.228</ref> \n\n[[File:Three-decker Bretagne-P4130051.JPG|thumb|left|Depiction on ''Bretagne'' flying the white ensign of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]].]]\nBy 3 January 1764, the Commission was requesting revised versions of the plans as to reduce the dimensions of ''Bretagne''.<ref name=binet231>Binet, p.231</ref> On 23, Groignard submitted his new plans, along with a memorandum underlining that this version would not allow the ship to hold six month worth of food and was compromising her stability, speed and man\u0153uverability; furthermore, he warned that the lower headspace of the gundecks in the smaller project would hinder evacuation of smoke from the guns in combat conditions.<ref name=binet235>Binet, p.235</ref> On 19 February, Choiseul declined to approve the revised plans and requested a third version; Groignard quickly completed the new plans and went directly to Paris himself to submit them, short-circuiting the construction Commission of the Estates of Brittany<ref name=binet237>Binet, p.237</ref> and talking Choiseul out of the notion that the lower battery could be armed with 24-pounders instead of 36-pounders to reduce the cost.<ref name=binet238>Binet, p.238</ref><ref name=forrer14 /> On 7 May, Choiseul informed the Commission that his plans had met with approval and that the construction could begin.<ref name=binet238 />\n\nThe Commission then started procuring the raw materials needed for the construction, notably wood, fabric for the sails, iron and cables. Lacking experience in the matter, it requested advice from Roth, director of the East India Company in Lorient,<ref name=forrer14 /> who replied on 1 April with a long memorandum.<ref name=binet239>Binet, p.239</ref> Besides explaining how to assess the quality of the materials, how to transport it on land and how to store it, the memorandum observed that a number of parts would need to be obtained from outside of Bretagne, and sometimes even abroard, notably from the Netherlands.<ref name=binet240>Binet, p.240</ref> Providers would span from [[Newcastle]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Riga]].<ref name=binet240 />\n\nIn August 1764, Groignard started laying down parts in Lorient shipyard, hoping to take advantage of the summer weather and of a moment of low activity by the East India Company. However, the fluyts needed to transport construction wood were damaged and a lack of wood and nails soon slowed down the work.<ref name=binet242>Binet, p.242</ref> In December, the Estates and the Company signed an understanding that Groignard would have access to the parts and materials stocked in the Company stores, and that the Estates would replenish them within three months.<ref name=binet243>Binet, p.243</ref> On 12 December, the keel was laid down, the bow had been assembled, and the [[Frame (nautical)|frames]] were made and ready to be installed.<ref name=binet244>Binet, p.244</ref>\n\nHowever, on 12 January 1765, the Commission ordered that the construction be halted, <ref name=binet244 /> and summoned Groignard to Nantes.<ref name=binet249>Binet, p.249</ref> Realising its lack of competence, the Commission had decided to cease procuring material directly and to delegate that task to the harbour mandated for the construction, which would be either Lorient or Brest.<ref name=binet250>Binet, p.252</ref> By March, Brest had won the contract; <ref name=binet254>Binet, p.254</ref> the ship was dismantled and her parts were brought to Brest in May 1765.<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /> Groignard remained in charge of the work, <ref name=binet254 /> while the Commission was little involved from then on.<ref name=binet255>Binet, p.255</ref> \n\nOn 5 July 1765, the keel was laid down in Brest<ref name=binet256>Binet, p.256</ref> in the upper dry dock of Pontaniou.<ref name=forrer15>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.15</ref> By mid-July, the framing was completed.<ref name=binet256 /> By mid-September, the hull was [[Caulk|caulked]].<ref name=binet257>Binet, p.257</ref> In late February 1766, carpenters had completed the [[orlop deck]] and were preparing construction of the [[Gun deck|first battery]].<ref name=binet257 /> In April, the sides were completed up to the lower battery, and the decks of the lower and middle batteries were installed.<ref name=binet258>Binet, p.258</ref> On 24 May 1766, ''Bretagne'' was launched.<ref name=binet258 /><ref name=Roche85 />\n\nCompletion of the ship remained slow: <ref name=forrer15 /> although ''Bretagne'' was declared completed on 30 September 1767 <ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /><ref name=forrer15 /> and officially commissioned in 1768,<ref name=binet261>Binet, p.261</ref> work remained to be done to make her sea worthy in June 1770, and she spent the whole year of 1770 fitting out.<ref name=forrer15 /> On 30 November 1771, she was declared in need of an extensive refit.<ref name=forrer15 />\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1773, ''Bretagne'' was listed as serving in the Brest Brigade of the Ponant Division of the Navy.<ref name=binet261 /> However, her state was deteriorating, and harbour director Count de Breugnon sent her to a dry dock, where she entered on 9 August.<ref name=forrer15 /> In 1775, [[Louis Guillouet, comte d'Orvilliers|Orvilliers]], took command of the Brest squadron and, finding her timbers rotten, petitionned [[Antoine de Sartine|Sartine]] for an extensive refit;<ref name=binet261 /><ref name=forrer15 />  reconstruction started on 1 September 1776, taking  480,000 pounds, and ''Bretagne'' was launched on 7 April 1777.

The bureau was split into naval and army sections which, over time, specialised in foreign espionage and internal counter-espionage activities, respectively. This specialisation was because the Admiralty wanted to know the maritime strength of the [[Imperial German Navy]]. This specialisation was formalised before 1914. During the [[First World War]] in 1916, the two sections underwent administrative changes so that the foreign section became the section MI1(c) of the [[Directorate of Military Intelligence (United Kingdom)|Directorate of Military Intelligence]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sis.gov.uk/output/Page470.html |title=SIS Records&nbsp;\u2014 War Office Military Intelligence (MI) Sections in the First World War |publisher=Sis.gov.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820014944/http://www.sis.gov.uk/output/Page470.html |archivedate=20 August 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIts first director was [[Mansfield Smith-Cumming|Captain Sir Mansfield George Smith-Cumming]], who often dropped the ''Smith'' in routine communication.

At this time, the organisation was known in [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Whitehall]] by a variety of titles including the ''Foreign Intelligence Service'', the ''Secret Service'', ''MI1(c)'', the ''Special Intelligence Service'' and even ''C's organisation''. Around 1920, it began increasingly to be referred to as the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), a title that it has continued to use to the present day and which was enshrined in statute in the Intelligence Services Act 1994.

The ''Report of the Anglo-Polish Historical Committee'' was written by leading historians and experts who had been granted unprecedented access to British intelligence archives, and concluded that 48 percent of all reports received by British secret services from continental Europe in 1939\u201345 had come from Polish sources.<ref name=\"google1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EJ5vIyDBpLcC&pg=PA234 |title=The Eagle Unbowed: Poland and the Poles in the Second World War |first=Halik |last=Kochanski |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-0674068148|pages=234-235}}</ref> This was facilitated by the fact that occupied Poland had a tradition of insurgency organizations passed down through generations, with networks in emigre Polish communities in Germany and France; a major part of Polish resistance activity was clandestine and involved cellular intelligence networks; while Nazi Germany used Poles as forced labourers across the continent, putting them in a unique position to spy on the enemy. Liaison was undertaken by SIS officer [[Wilfred Dunderdale]], and reports included advanced warning of the [[Afrikakorps]]' departure for Libya, awareness of the readiness of Vichy French units to fight against the Allies or switch sides in [[Operation Torch]], and advance warning both of [[Operation Barbarossa]] and [[Operation Edelweiss]], the German Caucasus campaign. [[Armia Krajowa and V-1 and V-2|Polish-sourced reporting on German secret weapons]] began in 1941, and [[Operation Most III|Operation Wildhorn]] enabled a British special operations flight to airlift a [[V-2 Rocket]] that had been captured by the Polish resistance.

The Soviet Bloc ceased to swallow the lion's share of operational priorities, although the stability and intentions of a weakened but still nuclear-capable Federal Russia constituted a significant concern. Instead, functional rather than geographical intelligence requirements came to the fore such as [[counter-proliferation]] (via the agency's Production and Targeting, Counter-Proliferation Section) which had been a sphere of activity since the discovery of Pakistani physics students studying nuclear-weapons related subjects in 1974; counter-terrorism (via two joint sections run in collaboration with the Security Service, one for [[Irish republicanism]] and one for international terrorism); counter-narcotics and serious crime (originally set up under the [[Western Hemisphere]] controllerate in 1989); and a 'global issues' section looking at matters such as the environment and other public welfare issues.

McColl's policies were part and parcel with a wider 'open government initiative' developed from 1993 by the government of [[John Major]]. As part of this, SIS operations, and those of the national signals intelligence agency, [[GCHQ]], were placed on a statutory footing through the 1994 [[Intelligence Services Act 1994|Intelligence Services Act]]. Although the Act provided procedures for authorisations and warrants, this essentially enshrined mechanisms that had been in place at least since 1953 (for authorisations) and 1985 (under the [[Interception of Communications Act 1985|Interception of Communications Act]], for warrants). Under this Act, since 1994, SIS and GCHQ activities have been subject to scrutiny by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament's]] [[Intelligence and Security Committee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/13/pdfs/ukpga_19940013_en.pdf|title=Intelligence Services Act 1994|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring the mid-1990s the British intelligence community was subjected to a comprehensive costing review by the government. As part of broader defence cut-backs SIS had its resources cut back twenty-five percent across the board and senior management was reduced by forty percent. As a consequence of these cuts, the Requirements division (formerly the Circulating Sections of the 1921 Arrangement) were deprived of any representation on the board of directors. At the same time, the Middle East and Africa controllerates were pared back and amalgamated. According to the findings of Lord Butler of Brockwell's ''Review of Weapons of Mass Destruction'', the reduction of operational capabilities in the Middle East and of the Requirements division's ability to challenge the quality of the information the Middle East Controllerate was providing weakened the [[Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Committee]]'s estimates of [[Iraq]]'s non-conventional weapons programmes. These weaknesses were major contributors to the UK's erroneous assessments of Iraq's 'weapons of mass destruction' prior to the 2003 invasion of that country.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Politics/documents/2004/07/14/butler.pdf|title=Review of Intelligence on weapons of mass destruction|publisher=Committee led by Lord Butler|accessdate=1 July 2012|location=London}}</ref>\n\nOn one occasion in 1998, MI6 believed it might be able to obtain 'actionable intelligence' which could help the CIA capture [[Osama Bin Laden]], the leader of [[Al Qaeda]]. But given that this might result in his being transferred or rendered to the United States, MI6 decided it had to ask for ministerial approval before passing the intelligence on (in case he faced the death penalty or mistreatment). This was approved by a minister 'provided the CIA gave assurances regarding humane treatment'.

He reported back to London that there were aspects of the way the detainee had been handled by the US military before the interview that did not appear consistent with the [[Geneva Conventions]]. Two days after the interview, he was sent instructions, copied to all MI5 and MI6 officers in Afghanistan, about how to deal with concerns over mistreatment, referring to signs of abuse: \"Given that they are not within our custody or control, the law does not require you to intervene to protect this.\" It went on to say that the Americans had to understand that the UK did not condone such mistreatment and that a complaint should be made to a senior US official if there was any coercion by the US in conjunction with an MI6 interview.<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.339</ref>\n\nIn the run-up to the [[invasion of Iraq in 2003]], it is alleged, although not confirmed, that some SIS members conducted [[Operation Mass Appeal]] which was a campaign to plant stories about Iraq's WMDs in the media.

Afterwards they raised concerns about the poor detention conditions there. As a result the British government informed JSOC in Iraq that prisoners captured by British special forces would only be turned over to JSOC if there was an undertaking not to send them to Balad.

A third individual was branded a British spy in the Balkans and left the office of the High Representative in Bosnia, whilst a further two British intelligence officers working in [[Zagreb]], remained in place despite their cover being blown in the local press. The exposure of the agents across the three capitals has markedly undermined the British intelligence operations in the area, including SIS efforts to capture The Hague's most wanted men, which riled many local intelligence agencies in the Balkans, some of which are suspected of continuing ties to alleged war criminals. They were riled due to MI6 operating \"not so much a spy network as a network of influence within Balkan security services and the media,\" said the director of the International Crisis Group in Serbia and Bosnia, which caused some of them to be \"upset\". In Serbia, the SIS station chief was forced to leave his post in August 2004 after a campaign against him led by country's DB intelligence agency, where his work investigating the [[Assassination of Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107|2003 assassination]] of the reformist prime minister [[Zoran Djindjic]] won him few friends.<ref name=\"MI6 spies exposed by Balkan rivals\"/>\n\nOn 15 November 2006, SIS allowed an interview with current operations officers for the first time. The interview was on the [[Colin Murray]] Show on [[BBC Radio 1]]. The two officers (one male and one female) had their voices disguised for security reasons. The officers compared their real experience with the fictional portrayal of SIS in the [[James Bond films]]. While denying that there ever existed a \"[[licence to kill (concept)|licence to kill]]\" and reiterating that SIS operated under British law, the officers confirmed that there is a '[[Q (James Bond)|Q]]'-like figure who is head of the technology department, and that their director is referred to as 'C'. The officers described the lifestyle as quite glamorous and very varied, with plenty of overseas travel and adventure, and described their role primarily as intelligence gatherers, developing relationships with potential sources.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1534306/MI6-licensed-to-thrill-listeners-to-Radio-1.html|title=MI6 licensed to thrill listeners to Radio 1|date=16 November 2006|accessdate=1 July 2012|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Philip|last=Johnston}}</ref>\n\nSir [[John Sawers]] became head of the SIS in November 2009, the first outsider to head SIS in more than 40 years.

It was tasked by the [[Director Special Forces]] to support MI6's operations (akin to the CIA's [[Special Activities Center|SAC]] \u2013 a covert paramilitary unit for SIS). It was not a formal squadron within the establishment of any individual UK Special Forces unit, but at the disposal of both the Director Special Forces and the SIS; previously, SIS relied primarily on contractor personnel. The Squadron carried out missions that required 'maximum discretion' in places that were 'off the radar or considered dangerous'; the Squadron's members often operated in plain clothes, with the full range of national support, such as false identities at its disposal. In early March 2011, during the Libyan Civil War, a covert operation in Libya involving E Squadron went wrong: The aim of the mission was to cement SIS's contacts with the rebels by flying in two SIS agents in a [[Chinook]] helicopter to meet a Libyan Intermediary in a town near Benghazi, who had promised to fix them up a meeting with the [[National Transitional Council|NTC]]. A team consisting of six E Squadron members (all from the SAS) and two SIS officers were flown into Libya by an RAF Special Forces Flight Chinook; the Squadron's members were carrying bags containing arms, ammunition, explosives, computers, maps and passports from at least four nationalities. Despite technical backup, the team landed in Libya without any prior agreement with the rebel leadership, and the plan failed as soon as the team landed. The locals became suspicious they were foreign mercenaries or spies and the team was detained by rebel forces and taken to a military base in Benghazi. They were then hauled before a senior rebel leader; the team told him that they were in the country to determine the rebels' needs and to offer assistance, but the discovery of British troops on the ground enraged the rebels who were fearful that Gaddafi would use such evidence to destroy the credibility of the NTC. Negotiations between senior rebel leaders and British officials in London finally led to their release and they were allowed to board [[HMS Cumberland (F85)|HMS Cumberland]].<ref>Stuart, Mark Muller, ''Storm in the Desert: Britain's Intervention in Libya and the Arab Spring'', Birlinn Ltd, 2017, {{ISBN|1780274521}}, {{ISBN|978-1780274522}}</ref><ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.296, p.314</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16624401|title=SAS on ground during Libya crisis|work=BBC News|date=19 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 November 2011 SIS warned the national transitional council in Benghazi after discovering details of planned strikes, said foreign secretary [[William Hague]]. 'The agencies obtained firm intelligence, were able to warn the NTC of the threat, and the attacks were prevented,' he said. In a rare speech on the intelligence agencies, he praised the key role played by SIS and GCHQ in bringing Gaddafi's 42-year dictatorship to an end, describing them as 'vital assets' with a 'fundamental and indispensable role' in keeping the nation safe. 'They worked to identify key political figures, develop contacts with the emerging opposition and provide political and military intelligence. 'Most importantly, they saved lives,' he said. The speech follows criticism that SIS had been too close to the Libyan regime and was involved in the extraordinary rendition of anti-Gaddafi activists.

The top-secret mission, dubbed Operation X to disguise its purpose, used modern electronic intelligence (ELINT) technologies to bug him along with his friends and family. Gaddafi had been hiding out in the desert for a month but the breakthrough came when he made two phone calls, one after the other, to say he was safe. It allowed the joint British and French bugging operation to pinpoint his location.

The bureau was split into naval and army sections which, over time, specialised in foreign espionage and internal counter-espionage activities, respectively. This specialisation was because the Admiralty wanted to know the maritime strength of the [[Imperial German Navy]]. This specialisation was formalised before 1914. During the [[First World War]] in 1916, the two sections underwent administrative changes so that the foreign section became the section MI1(c) of the [[Directorate of Military Intelligence (United Kingdom)|Directorate of Military Intelligence]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sis.gov.uk/output/Page470.html |title=SIS Records&nbsp;\u2014 War Office Military Intelligence (MI) Sections in the First World War |publisher=Sis.gov.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820014944/http://www.sis.gov.uk/output/Page470.html |archivedate=20 August 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIts first director was [[Mansfield Smith-Cumming|Captain Sir Mansfield George Smith-Cumming]], who often dropped the ''Smith'' in routine communication.

In August 1919, Cumming created the new passport control department, providing diplomatic cover for agents abroad. The post of ''Passport Control Officer'' provided operatives with [[diplomatic immunity]].<ref name=Sinclair>\"C\": The Secret Life of Sir Stewart Graham Menzies, Spymaster to Winston Churchill, Anthony Cave Brown, Collier, 1989</ref>\n\nCirculating Sections established intelligence requirements and passed the intelligence back to its consumer departments, mainly the [[War Office]] and [[Admiralty]].<ref>Davies (2004), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TTW2h5GHlWkC&pg=PA182&lpg=PA182&dq=%22Circulating+Sections%22+Mi6&source=bl&ots=vzKfe_QdxN&sig=gVaVwvnYBqYYBK6QrZQTWAU9ig8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiYq-_uzebeAhUsB8AKHenvCEcQ6AEwCnoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Circulating%20Sections%22%20Mi6&f=false p. 182]</ref>\n\nThe debate over the future structure of British Intelligence continued at length after the end of hostilities but [[Mansfield Smith-Cumming|Cumming]] managed to engineer the return of the Service to Foreign Office control. At this time, the organisation was known in [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Whitehall]] by a variety of titles including the ''Foreign Intelligence Service'', the ''Secret Service'', ''MI1(c)'', the ''Special Intelligence Service'' and even ''C's organisation''. Around 1920, it began increasingly to be referred to as the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), a title that it has continued to use to the present day and which was enshrined in statute in the Intelligence Services Act 1994. During the Second World War, the name MI6 was used as a flag of convenience, the name by which it is frequently known in popular culture since.<ref name=\"sisweb\" />\n\nIn the immediate post-war years under [[Mansfield Smith-Cumming|Sir Mansfield George Smith-Cumming]] and throughout most of the 1920s, SIS was focused on Communism, in particular, Russian Bolshevism.

Instead, functional rather than geographical intelligence requirements came to the fore such as [[counter-proliferation]] (via the agency's Production and Targeting, Counter-Proliferation Section) which had been a sphere of activity since the discovery of Pakistani physics students studying nuclear-weapons related subjects in 1974; counter-terrorism (via two joint sections run in collaboration with the Security Service, one for [[Irish republicanism]] and one for international terrorism); counter-narcotics and serious crime (originally set up under the [[Western Hemisphere]] controllerate in 1989); and a 'global issues' section looking at matters such as the environment and other public welfare issues. In the mid-1990s these were consolidated into a new post of Controller, Global and Functional.<ref>Davies (2004), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TTW2h5GHlWkC&pg=PA354&lpg=PA354&dq=Controller,+Global+and+Functional+mi6&source=bl&ots=vzKfe_R9rL&sig=T0y1Zqyx8plT752vCpx6t3kRdI8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj6u6Pvz-beAhWrBcAKHWIxBf0Q6AEwCnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Controller%2C%20Global%20and%20Functional%20mi6&f=false p. 354]</ref>\n\nDuring the transition, then-C Sir [[Colin McColl]] embraced a new, albeit limited, policy of openness towards the press and public, with 'public affairs' falling into the brief of Director, Counter-Intelligence and Security (renamed Director, Security and Public Affairs). McColl's policies were part and parcel with a wider 'open government initiative' developed from 1993 by the government of [[John Major]]. As part of this, SIS operations, and those of the national signals intelligence agency, [[GCHQ]], were placed on a statutory footing through the 1994 [[Intelligence Services Act 1994|Intelligence Services Act]]. Although the Act provided procedures for authorisations and warrants, this essentially enshrined mechanisms that had been in place at least since 1953 (for authorisations) and 1985 (under the [[Interception of Communications Act 1985|Interception of Communications Act]], for warrants). Under this Act, since 1994, SIS and GCHQ activities have been subject to scrutiny by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament's]] [[Intelligence and Security Committee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/13/pdfs/ukpga_19940013_en.pdf|title=Intelligence Services Act 1994|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring the mid-1990s the British intelligence community was subjected to a comprehensive costing review by the government. As part of broader defence cut-backs SIS had its resources cut back twenty-five percent across the board and senior management was reduced by forty percent. As a consequence of these cuts, the Requirements division (formerly the Circulating Sections of the 1921 Arrangement) were deprived of any representation on the board of directors. At the same time, the Middle East and Africa controllerates were pared back and amalgamated. According to the findings of Lord Butler of Brockwell's ''Review of Weapons of Mass Destruction'', the reduction of operational capabilities in the Middle East and of the Requirements division's ability to challenge the quality of the information the Middle East Controllerate was providing weakened the [[Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Committee]]'s estimates of [[Iraq]]'s non-conventional weapons programmes. These weaknesses were major contributors to the UK's erroneous assessments of Iraq's 'weapons of mass destruction' prior to the 2003 invasion of that country.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Politics/documents/2004/07/14/butler.pdf|title=Review of Intelligence on weapons of mass destruction|publisher=Committee led by Lord Butler|accessdate=1 July 2012|location=London}}</ref>\n\nOn one occasion in 1998, MI6 believed it might be able to obtain 'actionable intelligence' which could help the CIA capture [[Osama Bin Laden]], the leader of [[Al Qaeda]]. But given that this might result in his being transferred or rendered to the United States, MI6 decided it had to ask for ministerial approval before passing the intelligence on (in case he faced the death penalty or mistreatment). This was approved by a minister 'provided the CIA gave assurances regarding humane treatment'. In the end, not enough intelligence came through to make it worth while going ahead.<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.313</ref>\n\nIn 2001, it became clear that [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] and his [[Northern Alliance|forces]] were the best option for going after Bin Laden; the priority for MI6 was developing intelligence coverage.

He reported back to London that there were aspects of the way the detainee had been handled by the US military before the interview that did not appear consistent with the [[Geneva Conventions]]. Two days after the interview, he was sent instructions, copied to all MI5 and MI6 officers in Afghanistan, about how to deal with concerns over mistreatment, referring to signs of abuse: \"Given that they are not within our custody or control, the law does not require you to intervene to protect this.\" It went on to say that the Americans had to understand that the UK did not condone such mistreatment and that a complaint should be made to a senior US official if there was any coercion by the US in conjunction with an MI6 interview.<ref>Corera, Gordon, ''MI6: Life and Death in the British Secret Service'', W&N , 2012, {{ISBN|0753828332|978-0753828335}}, p.339</ref>\n\nIn the run-up to the [[invasion of Iraq in 2003]], it is alleged, although not confirmed, that some SIS members conducted [[Operation Mass Appeal]] which was a campaign to plant stories about Iraq's WMDs in the media.

In Spring 2005, the SAS detachment operating in Basra and southern Iraq, known as Operation Hathor, escorted MI6 case officers into Basra so they could meet their sources and handlers.

A third individual was branded a British spy in the Balkans and left the office of the High Representative in Bosnia, whilst a further two British intelligence officers working in [[Zagreb]], remained in place despite their cover being blown in the local press. The exposure of the agents across the three capitals has markedly undermined the British intelligence operations in the area, including SIS efforts to capture The Hague's most wanted men, which riled many local intelligence agencies in the Balkans, some of which are suspected of continuing ties to alleged war criminals. They were riled due to MI6 operating \"not so much a spy network as a network of influence within Balkan security services and the media,\" said the director of the International Crisis Group in Serbia and Bosnia, which caused some of them to be \"upset\". In Serbia, the SIS station chief was forced to leave his post in August 2004 after a campaign against him led by country's DB intelligence agency, where his work investigating the [[Assassination of Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107|2003 assassination]] of the reformist prime minister [[Zoran Djindjic]] won him few friends.<ref name=\"MI6 spies exposed by Balkan rivals\"/>\n\nOn 15 November 2006, SIS allowed an interview with current operations officers for the first time. The interview was on the [[Colin Murray]] Show on [[BBC Radio 1]]. The two officers (one male and one female) had their voices disguised for security reasons. The officers compared their real experience with the fictional portrayal of SIS in the [[James Bond films]]. While denying that there ever existed a \"[[licence to kill (concept)|licence to kill]]\" and reiterating that SIS operated under British law, the officers confirmed that there is a '[[Q (James Bond)|Q]]'-like figure who is head of the technology department, and that their director is referred to as 'C'. The officers described the lifestyle as quite glamorous and very varied, with plenty of overseas travel and adventure, and described their role primarily as intelligence gatherers, developing relationships with potential sources.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1534306/MI6-licensed-to-thrill-listeners-to-Radio-1.html|title=MI6 licensed to thrill listeners to Radio 1|date=16 November 2006|accessdate=1 July 2012|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Philip|last=Johnston}}</ref>\n\nSir [[John Sawers]] became head of the SIS in November 2009, the first outsider to head SIS in more than 40 years.

It was tasked by the [[Director Special Forces]] to support MI6's operations (akin to the CIA's [[Special Activities Center|SAC]] \u2013 a covert paramilitary unit for SIS). It was not a formal squadron within the establishment of any individual UK Special Forces unit, but at the disposal of both the Director Special Forces and the SIS; previously, SIS relied primarily on contractor personnel. The Squadron carried out missions that required 'maximum discretion' in places that were 'off the radar or considered dangerous'; the Squadron's members often operated in plain clothes, with the full range of national support, such as false identities at its disposal. In early March 2011, during the Libyan Civil War, a covert operation in Libya involving E Squadron went wrong: The aim of the mission was to cement SIS's contacts with the rebels by flying in two SIS agents in a [[Chinook]] helicopter to meet a Libyan Intermediary in a town near Benghazi, who had promised to fix them up a meeting with the [[National Transitional Council|NTC]]. A team consisting of six E Squadron members (all from the SAS) and two SIS officers were flown into Libya by an RAF Special Forces Flight Chinook; the Squadron's members were carrying bags containing arms, ammunition, explosives, computers, maps and passports from at least four nationalities. Despite technical backup, the team landed in Libya without any prior agreement with the rebel leadership, and the plan failed as soon as the team landed. The locals became suspicious they were foreign mercenaries or spies and the team was detained by rebel forces and taken to a military base in Benghazi. They were then hauled before a senior rebel leader; the team told him that they were in the country to determine the rebels' needs and to offer assistance, but the discovery of British troops on the ground enraged the rebels who were fearful that Gaddafi would use such evidence to destroy the credibility of the NTC. Negotiations between senior rebel leaders and British officials in London finally led to their release and they were allowed to board [[HMS Cumberland (F85)|HMS Cumberland]].<ref>Stuart, Mark Muller, ''Storm in the Desert: Britain's Intervention in Libya and the Arab Spring'', Birlinn Ltd, 2017, {{ISBN|1780274521}}, {{ISBN|978-1780274522}}</ref><ref>Neville, Leigh, '' Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military)'', Osprey Publishing, 2015  {{ISBN|978-1472807908}}, p.296, p.314</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16624401|title=SAS on ground during Libya crisis|work=BBC News|date=19 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 16 November 2011 SIS warned the national transitional council in Benghazi after discovering details of planned strikes, said foreign secretary [[William Hague]]. 'The agencies obtained firm intelligence, were able to warn the NTC of the threat, and the attacks were prevented,' he said. In a rare speech on the intelligence agencies, he praised the key role played by SIS and GCHQ in bringing Gaddafi's 42-year dictatorship to an end, describing them as 'vital assets' with a 'fundamental and indispensable role' in keeping the nation safe. 'They worked to identify key political figures, develop contacts with the emerging opposition and provide political and military intelligence. 'Most importantly, they saved lives,' he said.

Examples of literature that feature revenge as a theme include the plays ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[Othello]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]], the novel ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' by [[Alexandre Dumas]], and the short story \"[[The Cask of Amontillado]]\" by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. More modern examples include the novels ''[[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]'' by [[Stephen King]], ''[[Gone Girl (novel)|Gone Girl]]'' by [[Gillian Flynn]], and ''[[The Princess Bride (novel)|The Princess Bride]]'' by [[William Goldman]]. Although revenge is a theme in itself, it is also considered to be a [[genre]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Women and Revenge in Shakespeare: Gender, Genre, and Ethics|last = Marguerite|first = Tassi|date = September 22, 2012|journal = Renaissance Quarterly}}</ref>\n\nRevenge as a genre has been consistent with a variety of themes that have frequently appeared in different texts over the last few centuries. Such themes include but are not limited to: [[disguise]], [[Masking (personality)|masking]], [[Sexual intercourse|sex]], [[cannibalism]], the [[grotesque body|grotesque]], bodily fluids, power, violent murders, and secrecy.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Revenge: An Analysis of Its Psychological Underpinnings|last = Grobbink|first = Leonie|date = July 2015|journal = International Journal of Offender Therapy & Comparative Criminology|volume = 59|issue = 8|pages = 892\u2013907|doi = 10.1177/0306624X13519963|pmid = 24441031}}</ref> Each theme is usually coupled with the concept of [[Irony#Dramatic irony|dramatic irony]].

The root of the violence is usually derived from the characters' childhood development.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.nonviolenceandsocialjustice.org/Research-Literature/Sanctuary-Model-literature-and-works-by-Sandra-Bloom/Reflections-on-the-Desire-for-Revenge/75/|title = Reflections on the Desire for Revenge|date = 2001|website = Center for Nonviolence and Social Justice|last = Bloom|first = Sandra|publisher = Journal of Emotional Abuse}}</ref> Violent murders are seen in many texts ranging from dramas to novels. ''[[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]'', a 20th-century novel written by [[Stephen King]], has examples of this theme that do occur during the final scenes. Another text that incorporates this theme is the 16th-century drama ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]].\n\nThe themes of masking and disguise have the ability to go hand in hand with one another. A character may employ disguise literally or [[metaphor]]ically. A mask is the literal example of this theme; while pretending to be something one is not is considered to be the metaphoric example. Additional themes that may cause the [[protagonist]] and [[antagonist]] to develop a masked or disguised identity include sex, power, and even [[cannibalism]]. Examples of sex and power being used as themes can be seen in the novel ''[[Gone Girl (novel)|Gone Girl]]'', by [[Gillian Flynn]], as well as the already mentioned drama, ''[[Titus Andronicus]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Willbern|first=David|date=|title=Rape and Revenge in \"Titus Andronicus\"|url=|journal=English Literary Renaissance|volume=8|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n== On the Internet ==\nThe emergence of the [[Internet]] has provided new ways of exacting revenge.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Obeidat|first=Zaid|date=|title=Consumer Revenge Using the Internet and Social Media: An Examination of the Role of Service Failure Types and Cognitive Appraisal Processes|url=|journal=Psychology & Marketing|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Customer revenge targets businesses and corporations with the intent to cause damage or harm.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gr\u00e9goire|first=Yany|date=|title=A comprehensive model of customer direct and indirect revenge: understanding the effects of perceived greed and customer power|url=|journal=Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> In general, people tend to place more credence in [[Customer review|online reviews]] rather than [[corporate communication]]s.<ref name=\":02\" /> With technology becoming more readily available, corporations and firms are more likely to experience damage caused by negative reviews posted online going [[viral phenomenon|viral]].

Examples of literature that feature revenge as a theme include the plays ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[Othello]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]], the novel ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' by [[Alexandre Dumas]], and the short story \"[[The Cask of Amontillado]]\" by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. More modern examples include the novels ''[[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]'' by [[Stephen King]], ''[[Gone Girl (novel)|Gone Girl]]'' by [[Gillian Flynn]], and ''[[The Princess Bride (novel)|The Princess Bride]]'' by [[William Goldman]]. Although revenge is a theme in itself, it is also considered to be a [[genre]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Women and Revenge in Shakespeare: Gender, Genre, and Ethics|last = Marguerite|first = Tassi|date = September 22, 2012|journal = Renaissance Quarterly}}</ref>\n\nRevenge as a genre has been consistent with a variety of themes that have frequently appeared in different texts over the last few centuries. Such themes include but are not limited to: [[disguise]], [[Masking (personality)|masking]], [[Sexual intercourse|sex]], [[cannibalism]], the [[grotesque body|grotesque]], bodily fluids, power, violent murders, and secrecy.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Revenge: An Analysis of Its Psychological Underpinnings|last = Grobbink|first = Leonie|date = July 2015|journal = International Journal of Offender Therapy & Comparative Criminology|volume = 59|issue = 8|pages = 892\u2013907|doi = 10.1177/0306624X13519963|pmid = 24441031}}</ref> Each theme is usually coupled with the concept of [[Irony#Dramatic irony|dramatic irony]].

The root of the violence is usually derived from the characters' childhood development.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.nonviolenceandsocialjustice.org/Research-Literature/Sanctuary-Model-literature-and-works-by-Sandra-Bloom/Reflections-on-the-Desire-for-Revenge/75/|title = Reflections on the Desire for Revenge|date = 2001|website = Center for Nonviolence and Social Justice|last = Bloom|first = Sandra|publisher = Journal of Emotional Abuse}}</ref> Violent murders are seen in many texts ranging from dramas to novels. ''[[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]'', a 20th-century novel written by [[Stephen King]], has examples of this theme that do occur during the final scenes. Another text that incorporates this theme is the 16th-century drama ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]].\n\nThe themes of masking and disguise have the ability to go hand in hand with one another. A character may employ disguise literally or [[metaphor]]ically. A mask is the literal example of this theme; while pretending to be something one is not is considered to be the metaphoric example. Additional themes that may cause the [[protagonist]] and [[antagonist]] to develop a masked or disguised identity include sex, power, and even [[cannibalism]]. Examples of sex and power being used as themes can be seen in the novel ''[[Gone Girl (novel)|Gone Girl]]'', by [[Gillian Flynn]], as well as the already mentioned drama, ''[[Titus Andronicus]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Willbern|first=David|date=|title=Rape and Revenge in \"Titus Andronicus\"|url=|journal=English Literary Renaissance|volume=8|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n== On the Internet ==\nThe emergence of the [[Internet]] has provided new ways of exacting revenge.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Obeidat|first=Zaid|date=|title=Consumer Revenge Using the Internet and Social Media: An Examination of the Role of Service Failure Types and Cognitive Appraisal Processes|url=|journal=Psychology & Marketing|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Customer revenge targets businesses and corporations with the intent to cause damage or harm.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gr\u00e9goire|first=Yany|date=|title=A comprehensive model of customer direct and indirect revenge: understanding the effects of perceived greed and customer power|url=|journal=Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> In general, people tend to place more credence in [[Customer review|online reviews]] rather than [[corporate communication]]s.<ref name=\":02\" /> With technology becoming more readily available, corporations and firms are more likely to experience damage caused by negative reviews posted online going [[viral phenomenon|viral]].

Per MOS:TV, fiction is always treated in the present, even if a series has ended, so \"is\" is the correct word to use. --> an American animated television series created by [[Skyler Page]] for [[Cartoon Network]]. The series revolves around a young boy named Clarence and his two best friends Jeff and Sumo. \nPage, a former storyboard artist for ''[[Adventure Time]]'' and revisionist for ''[[Secret Mountain Fort Awesome]]'', developed the series at [[Cartoon Network Studios]] as part of their shorts development program in 2012.\n\nThe pilot aired after the 2014 ''[[Hall of Game Awards]]'' show on February 17, 2014. The series officially premiered on April 14, 2014 and was seen by approximately 2.3 million viewers, outperforming shows in its same demographic in the time slot. The series' pilot was nominated for a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]]. The series completed its run on June 24, 2018.\n\n==Premise==\nThe series focuses on the daily life of Clarence Wendle, a fun-loving and spirited boy, and his best friends: Jeff, who is the more intellectual type, and Sumo, who often uses drastic measures when solving problems.\n\nClarence lives with his divorced mother Mary and her boyfriend Chad in the fictional town of Aberdale, [[Arizona]], located near [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. Each episode focuses on the daily-life situations and problems that Clarence and his friends encounter, and their everyday adventures and life experiences as kids.\n\nOther characters include students and faculty at Aberdale Elementary, Clarence's school. Certain episodes focus on the life of supporting characters, like the citizens of Aberdale and  Clarence's classmates.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n[[File:Clarence (2014) screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|The main characters, from left to right: Sumo, Jeff, and Clarence|alt=]]\n*Clarence Wendle (voiced by [[Skyler Page]] {{small|(episodes 1\u201332 and 35\u201336)}} and Spencer Rothbell {{small|(episodes 33\u201334 and 37\u2013130)}}) - An overweight, extroverted, optimistic, and wide-eyed 10-year-old boy who wants to bring out the best in everything and everyone. In the pilot episode, he was the \"new kid\" in Aberdale and could not wait to make friends. He is the kind of person who listens to and follows his heart, reacting toward life with unfailing excitement and enthusiasm. A \"[[nice guy]]\" and proud of it, Clarence enjoys helping people and doing good deeds without rewards, often by using unorthodox methods to do so. He can sometimes let his imagination get the better of him, can get a bit too friendly, and has a bad habit of meddling into people's personal lives. Clarence has a wide range of interests and hobbies, and despite sometimes coming off as a goofball, he more often than not displays an underlying intelligence.\n*{{anchor|Jeff Randell}}Jeffrey \"Jeff\" Randell (voiced by [[Sean Giambrone]]) - Clarence's second best friend. Jeff is by far the most intelligent, levelheaded, and morally inclined of the trio and tries his best to prevent Clarence from going down a bad road. Jeff's most well-known trait is that he has a cube-shaped head which represents his \"square\" personality. He is an avid fan of [[game shows]] and enjoys playing along with them.\n*Ryan \"Sumo\" Sumouski (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]] in the TV series and [[Jason Marsden]] in the pilot) - Clarence's best friend, who is fearless, unpredictable, and often takes drastic and crude measures when trying to solve problems. Despite this often being a drawback, Sumo is loyal to Jeff and Clarence and available when they need support. He and Jeff tend to quarrel with each other due to their opposing personalities, but Clarence acts as the glue that holds the boys' friendships together. In the third season, Sumo was transferred to the new school called West Aberdale.\n\n===Supporting===\n*Mary Wendle (voiced by [[Katie Crown]]) \u2013 Clarence's mother who is always there to support her son no matter the difficulty. She lives with her boyfriend Chad and her son Clarence. It is revealed In \"Hurricane Dilliss\" she has an overbearing mother (now deceased) which makes her very annoyed by her taking over her life.\n*Charles \"Chad\" Caswell III (voiced by [[Eric Edelstein]]) \u2013 Mary's boyfriend who works at various odd-jobs and acts as Clarence's father figure (Although Clarence mostly calls him Chad). Also has a fondness for guitar playing and rock music.\n*Belson Noles (voiced by [[Jason Marsden]] in the pilot episode and [[Roger Craig Smith]] in the TV series) \u2013 The resident bully, who is more likely to use insults and quips rather than use physical violence. Self-absorbed, apathetic, and superficial, Belson is rather unpopular among his peers, yet Clarence is the only one that actually likes him, though the same can't be said for him. Belson is also prone to [[envy]], as he is aggravated by the fact that Clarence is the \"popular kid\" at Aberdale Elementary School and has occasionally tried to ruin his reputation. He is also named after Nelson Boles, who helped create the series. He likely takes after his father, who appears in \"Company Man\" because they both show a desire for complete control over others (the father over his employees, to Belson over the students).\n*Chelsea Keezheekoni (voiced by Grace Kaufman) \u2013 A plucky and outspoken girl who insists that she is superior to any boy, mainly Sumo. She and Sumo have shared a kiss in Clarence, Jeff and Sumo's treehouse in \"Too Gross For Comfort\".\n*Breehn (voiced by [[Joshua Rush]]) \u2013 One of the intelligent kids in class who is more of Jeff's friend than Clarence's, and keeps himself well grounded at all times. However, in later episodes he warms up to Clarence and joins him on some of his misadventures. He becomes a better friend of Clarence, and lets loose when with him.\n*Ms. Melanie Baker (voiced by Katie Crown) \u2013 The children's 4th grade teacher at Aberdale Elementary School who is shown to be helpful and caring, yet easily overwhelmed.\n*Percy Dahmer (voiced by Roger Craig Smith) \u2013 A short, wimpy boy who speaks in a weak voice and is friends with Clarence and Belson.\n*Nathan (voiced by Skyler Page and Damien Haas) \u2013 One of Belson's friends. He's a big guy who is considered dim-witted. He becomes friends with Clarence as well, often participating in his escapades.\n*Dustin Conway (voiced by Kyle Arem) \u2013 Another one of Clarence's classmates and Belson's friends. He later becomes friends with Clarence.\n*Mel Sumouski (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]) \u2013 Sumo's father who has a stern voice but is really quite wacky.\n*EJ and Sue Randell (voiced by [[Lea DeLaria]] and [[Tig Notaro]]) \u2013 Jeff's [[lesbian]] mothers; EJ has a very similar appearance to Jeff (possibly his birth mother) and has a masculine dress taste, while Sue is free spirited and always shows a patient personality with her son.\n*Jim Reese (voiced by Skyler Page and [[Donovan Patton]]) \u2013 The gruff yet dim-witted vice-principal of the school. He is a former police officer with a voracious appetite.\n*Guyler - A blond-haired boy with a long neck and a big nose. Although generally silent, he does make occasional grunts. He is friends with Clarence, and joins him on his escapades. At first a minor character, he becomes more prominent in later episodes; specifically in \"A Nightmare on Aberdale Street: Balance's Revenge\".\n*Regis Gilben \u2013 A silent and motionless boy who communicates with an eerie wind sound instead of a voice. Everyone can seemingly understand this; also, somehow he is ghost-like and can touch without moving.\n*Mavis (voiced by Spencer Rothbell) \u2013 A squat, red-haired girl who speaks in unintelligible grunts and has a fear of fire hydrants.\n*Joshua \"Josh\" Maverick (voiced by Brent Popolizio) \u2013 A grumpy teenager who doesn't like children, especially Sumo, and later Clarence. He is shown to be very accident prone and constantly gets severe injuries during every one of his appearances.\n*Kimby (voiced by Isabella Niems) \u2013 Another of Clarence's classmates.

However, she never appears after her debut in the second episode, \"Pretty Great Day With a Girl\", due to her moving away, save for a cameo in \"Rough Riders Elementary\" and a flashback in \"Clarence For President\".\n*Amy Shutzger (voiced by Skyler Page and Damien Haas) \u2014 A big girl who, along with Mavis, is the only recurring female character to be voiced by a man.

It was further considered when Page became hired at Cartoon Network Studios. A crew of two or three polished the pilot episode; after it had been picked up, a crew of 30 to 35 writers, storyboard artists, revisionists, colorists and designers were employed. Meanwhile, animation is outsourced to South Korea through the [[Saerom Animation]].<ref name=\"Milligan 2014a\" />{{rp|20}} Page explained that the hardest part of production was keeping pace, especially where once an episode is completed, one must start over. He called this \"exciting\", but \"very challenging\".<ref name=\"Milligan 2014a\" />{{rp|21}}\n\nAccording to writer Spencer Rothbell, the series was created with a naturalistic tone, similar to cartoons of the 1990s, combined with a more modern feeling. Given this naturalism, writers can reference works that have inspired for them or fit the genre of an episode. He ultimately felt that it was about \"empowering kids and having fun\".<ref name=\"Serrao 2014\" /> Rothbell also avoids \"pigeonholing\" into one type of story, and that while some plots are mostly character-driven, others are \"based on one idea that we think is really funny\".<ref name=\"Cartoon Network 2014b\" /> Inspiration also came from the shows Page watched as a child, which invoked more poignant and relatable situations. Despite this, elements of fantasy are allowed, and that conveying both incongruous to one another was one technique he particularly enjoyed. Boles noted that the [[art director|art direction]] called for inconsistent character design to avoid having to fit model sheet with the universe perfectly\u2014a result of what he dubs ''the ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' effect''.<ref name=\"Milligan 2014a\" />{{rp|20}} Attention is also paid to background characters in order to expand variety in its plot and [[Fictional universe|universe]].<ref name=\"Milligan 2014a\" />{{rp|20\u201321}}\n<!--\n  -- Per policy ([[WP:BLPCRIME]]), mentions of the allegations raised against Page cannot be included until a successful conviction against him has been secured and reported by reliable sources.\n  --\n  -- Please see the following discussion:\n  -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons/Noticeboard/Archive203#Skylor_Page_at_Clarence_.282014_TV_series.29.E2.80.8E\n  \u2013\n  \u2013 See also:\n  \u2013 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons#Persons_accused_of_crime\n  -->\n\n===Crossover===\nClarence, Jeff, Sumo, and Belson appeared in \"The Grampies\", the short accompanying the ''[[Uncle Grandpa]]'' episode \"Pizza Eve\", along with other Cartoon Network characters from currently running and ended cartoons.

Per MOS:TV, fiction is always treated in the present, even if a series has ended, so \"is\" is the correct word to use. --> an American animated television series created by [[Skyler Page]] for [[Cartoon Network]]. The series revolves around a young boy named Clarence and his two best friends Jeff and Sumo. \nPage, a former storyboard artist for ''[[Adventure Time]]'' and revisionist for ''[[Secret Mountain Fort Awesome]]'', developed the series at [[Cartoon Network Studios]] as part of their shorts development program in 2012.\n\nThe pilot aired after the 2014 ''[[Hall of Game Awards]]'' show on February 17, 2014. The series officially premiered on April 14, 2014 and was seen by approximately 2.3 million viewers, outperforming shows in its same demographic in the time slot. The series' pilot was nominated for a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]]. The show completed its run on June 24, 2018.\n\n==Premise==\nThe show focuses on the daily life of Clarence Wendle, a fun-loving and spirited boy, and his best friends: Jeff, who is the more intellectual type, and Sumo, who often uses drastic measures when solving problems.\n\nClarence lives with his divorced mother Mary and her boyfriend Chad in the fictional town of Aberdale, [[Arizona]], located near [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. Each episode focuses on the daily-life situations and problems that Clarence and his friends encounter, and their everyday adventures and life experiences as kids.\n\nOther characters include students and faculty at Aberdale Elementary, Clarence's school. Certain episodes focus on the life of supporting characters, like the citizens of Aberdale and  Clarence's classmates.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n[[File:Clarence (2014) screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|The main characters, from left to right: Sumo, Jeff, and Clarence|alt=]]\n*Clarence Wendle (voiced by [[Skyler Page]] {{small|(episodes 1\u201332 and 35\u201336)}} and Spencer Rothbell {{small|(episodes 33\u201334 and 37\u2013130)}}) - An overweight, extroverted, optimistic, and wide-eyed 10-year-old boy who wants to bring out the best in everything and everyone. In the pilot episode, he was the \"new kid\" in Aberdale and could not wait to make friends. He is the kind of person who listens to and follows his heart, reacting toward life with unfailing excitement and enthusiasm. A \"[[nice guy]]\" and proud of it, Clarence enjoys helping people and doing good deeds without rewards, often by using unorthodox methods to do so. He can sometimes let his imagination get the better of him, can get a bit too friendly, and has a bad habit of meddling into people's personal lives. Clarence has a wide range of interests and hobbies, and despite sometimes coming off as a goofball, he more often than not displays an underlying intelligence.\n*{{anchor|Jeff Randell}}Jeffrey \"Jeff\" Randell (voiced by [[Sean Giambrone]]) - Clarence's second best friend. Jeff is by far the most intelligent, levelheaded, and morally inclined of the trio and tries his best to prevent Clarence from going down a bad road. Jeff's most well-known trait is that he has a cube-shaped head which represents his \"square\" personality. He is an avid fan of [[game shows]] and enjoys playing along with them.\n*Ryan \"Sumo\" Sumouski (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]] in the TV series and [[Jason Marsden]] in the pilot) - Clarence's best friend, who is fearless, unpredictable, and often takes drastic and crude measures when trying to solve problems. Despite this often being a drawback, Sumo is loyal to Jeff and Clarence and available when they need support. He and Jeff tend to quarrel with each other due to their opposing personalities, but Clarence acts as the glue that holds the boys' friendships together. In the third season, Sumo was transferred to the new school called West Aberdale.\n\n===Supporting===\n*Mary Wendle (voiced by [[Katie Crown]]) \u2013 Clarence's mother who is always there to support her son no matter the difficulty. She lives with her boyfriend Chad and her son Clarence. It is revealed In \"Hurricane Dilliss\" she has an overbearing mother (now deceased) which makes her very annoyed by her taking over her life.\n*Charles \"Chad\" Caswell III (voiced by [[Eric Edelstein]]) \u2013 Mary's boyfriend who works at various odd-jobs and acts as Clarence's father figure (Although Clarence mostly calls him Chad). Also has a fondness for guitar playing and rock music.\n*Belson Noles (voiced by [[Jason Marsden]] in the pilot episode and [[Roger Craig Smith]] in the TV series) \u2013 The resident bully, who is more likely to use insults and quips rather than use physical violence. Self-absorbed, apathetic, and superficial, Belson is rather unpopular among his peers, yet Clarence is the only one that actually likes him, though the same can't be said for him. Belson is also prone to [[envy]], as he is aggravated by the fact that Clarence is the \"popular kid\" at Aberdale Elementary School and has occasionally tried to ruin his reputation. He is also named after Nelson Boles, who helped create the show. He likely takes after his father, who appears in \"Company Man\" because they both show a desire for complete control over others (the father over his employees, to Belson over the students).\n*Chelsea Keezheekoni (voiced by Grace Kaufman) \u2013 A plucky and outspoken girl who insists that she is superior to any boy, mainly Sumo. She and Sumo have shared a kiss in Clarence, Jeff and Sumo's treehouse in \"Too Gross For Comfort\".\n*Breehn (voiced by [[Joshua Rush]]) \u2013 One of the intelligent kids in class who is more of Jeff's friend than Clarence's, and keeps himself well grounded at all times. However, in later episodes he warms up to Clarence and joins him on some of his misadventures. He becomes a better friend of Clarence, and lets loose when with him.\n*Ms. Melanie Baker (voiced by Katie Crown) \u2013 The children's 4th grade teacher at Aberdale Elementary School who is shown to be helpful and caring, yet easily overwhelmed.\n*Percy Dahmer (voiced by Roger Craig Smith) \u2013 A short, wimpy boy who speaks in a weak voice and is friends with Clarence and Belson.\n*Nathan (voiced by Skyler Page and Damien Haas) \u2013 One of Belson's friends. He's a big guy who is considered dim-witted. He becomes friends with Clarence as well, often participating in his escapades.\n*Dustin Conway (voiced by Kyle Arem) \u2013 Another one of Clarence's classmates and Belson's friends. He later becomes friends with Clarence.\n*Mel Sumouski (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]) \u2013 Sumo's father who has a stern voice but is really quite wacky.\n*EJ and Sue Randell (voiced by [[Lea DeLaria]] and [[Tig Notaro]]) \u2013 Jeff's [[lesbian]] mothers; EJ has a very similar appearance to Jeff (possibly his birth mother) and has a masculine dress taste, while Sue is free spirited and always shows a patient personality with her son.\n*Jim Reese (voiced by Skyler Page and [[Donovan Patton]]) \u2013 The gruff yet dim-witted vice-principal of the school. He is a former police officer with a voracious appetite.\n*Guyler - A blond-haired boy with a long neck and a big nose. Although generally silent, he does make occasional grunts. He is friends with Clarence, and joins him on his escapades. At first a minor character, he becomes more prominent in later episodes; specifically in \"A Nightmare on Aberdale Street: Balance's Revenge\".\n*Regis Gilben \u2013 A silent and motionless boy who communicates with an eerie wind sound instead of a voice. Everyone can seemingly understand this; also, somehow he is ghost-like and can touch without moving.\n*Mavis (voiced by Spencer Rothbell) \u2013 A squat, red-haired girl who speaks in unintelligible grunts and has a fear of fire hydrants.\n*Joshua \"Josh\" Maverick (voiced by Brent Popolizio) \u2013 A grumpy teenager who doesn't like children, especially Sumo, and later Clarence. He is shown to be very accident prone and constantly gets severe injuries during every one of his appearances.\n*Kimby (voiced by Isabella Niems) \u2013 Another of Clarence's classmates. Kimby is shown as an introverted, awkward, insecure, yet lovely girl who constantly plays with her hair. As a [[girly girl]], Kimby often collects dolls and stuffed animals, enjoys giving and receiving makeovers, and listens to [[boy bands]].\n*Malessica (voiced by Ivy Bishop) \u2013 One of Kimby's friends who is the object of Jeff's affection.\n*Courtlin (voiced by Tayler Buck) \u2013 Another of Kimby's friends. She has a confident personality and isn't afraid to speak her mind.\n*Branda Shoop (voiced by Katie Crown) \u2013 The inattentive, irresponsible guidance counsellor who cares less about the students and more about the rules, safety and herself. She has been working at the school for 29 years, as revealed in \"The Substitute\".\n\n===Others===\n*Amy Gillis (voiced by [[Ava Acres]]) \u2014 A nice girl who is a good friend to Clarence. However, she never appears after her debut in the second episode, \"Pretty Great Day With a Girl\", due to her moving away, save for a cameo in \"Rough Riders Elementary\" and a flashback in \"Clarence For President\".\n*Amy Shutzger (voiced by Skyler Page and Damien Haas) \u2014 A big girl who, along with Mavis, is the only recurring female character to be voiced by a man.

It was further considered when Page became hired at Cartoon Network Studios. A crew of two or three polished the pilot episode; after it had been picked up, a crew of 30 to 35 writers, storyboard artists, revisionists, colorists and designers were employed. Meanwhile, animation is outsourced to South Korea through the [[Saerom Animation]].<ref name=\"Milligan 2014a\" />{{rp|20}} Page explained that the hardest part of production was keeping pace, especially where once an episode is completed, one must start over. He called this \"exciting\", but \"very challenging\".<ref name=\"Milligan 2014a\" />{{rp|21}}\n\nAccording to writer Spencer Rothbell, the show was created with a naturalistic tone, similar to cartoons of the 1990s, combined with a more modern feeling. Given this naturalism, writers can reference works that have inspired for them or fit the genre of an episode. He ultimately felt that it was about \"empowering kids and having fun\".<ref name=\"Serrao 2014\" /> Rothbell also avoids \"pigeonholing\" into one type of story, and that while some plots are mostly character-driven, others are \"based on one idea that we think is really funny\".<ref name=\"Cartoon Network 2014b\" /> Inspiration also came from the shows Page watched as a child, which invoked more poignant and relatable situations. Despite this, elements of fantasy are allowed, and that conveying both incongruous to one another was one technique he particularly enjoyed. Boles noted that the [[art director|art direction]] called for inconsistent character design to avoid having to fit model sheet with the universe perfectly\u2014a result of what he dubs ''the ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' effect''.<ref name=\"Milligan 2014a\" />{{rp|20}} Attention is also paid to background characters in order to expand variety in its plot and [[Fictional universe|universe]].<ref name=\"Milligan 2014a\" />{{rp|20\u201321}}\n<!--\n  -- Per policy ([[WP:BLPCRIME]]), mentions of the allegations raised against Page cannot be included until a successful conviction against him has been secured and reported by reliable sources.\n  --\n  -- Please see the following discussion:\n  -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons/Noticeboard/Archive203#Skylor_Page_at_Clarence_.282014_TV_series.29.E2.80.8E\n  \u2013\n  \u2013 See also:\n  \u2013 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons#Persons_accused_of_crime\n  -->\n\n===Crossover===\nClarence, Jeff, Sumo, and Belson appeared in \"The Grampies\", the short accompanying the ''[[Uncle Grandpa]]'' episode \"Pizza Eve\", along with other Cartoon Network characters from currently running and ended cartoons.
