It may be built that way because of constraints, or may be intended for expansion once traffic volumes rise. The term [[super two]] is often used by [[roadgeek]]s for this type of road, but [[Traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineer]]s use that term for a high-quality surface road. Most of these roads are not tolled.\n\nA somewhat related concept is a \"four-lane undivided expressway\". This is much rarer; a former example is some sections of [[U.S. Route 101]] in northern [[California]].\n\nIn Europe, the concept of ''express road'', is related to road which are classed between a motorway and an ordinary road. This concept is recognized both by European union law and by [[UNECE]] treaty. This type of road is not very standardized, and its geometry may vary from country to country or within a same country. Those road are usually, but not always, reserved for motorized vehicle, and accessible with [[Limited-access road]] (see [[:fr:Voie rapide]]). Some European union regulation considers the high-quality roads are roads \"which play an important role in long-distance freight and passenger traffic, integrate the main urban and economic centres, interconnect with other transport modes and link mountainous, remote, landlocked and peripheral NUTS 2 regions to central regions of the Union\u00bb. According to this same regulation \u00abHigh-quality roads shall be specially designed and built for motor traffic, and shall be either motorways, express roads or conventional strategic roads.\"\n\n==Justification==\nTwo-lane freeways are usually built as a temporary solution due to lack of funds, as an [[environmental movement|environmental]] compromise or as a way to overcome problems constrained from highway reconstruction when there are four lanes or more. If the road is widened, the existing road is typically allocated to traffic going in one direction, and the lanes for the other direction are built as a whole new roadbed adjacent to the existing one. When upgraded in this manner, the road becomes a typical freeway. Many two-lane freeways are built so that when the road is upgraded to a proper divided freeway, the existing overpasses and ramps do not need reconstruction.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nA '''super-2 expressway''' is a high-speed surface road with at-grade intersections, depending on the common usage of the term expressway in the area. By this definition, Super-2s can be considered the first stage of project which is expected to become a full freeway, with the transportation authority owning the land necessary for the future adjacent carriageway. At-grade intersections exist but there is sufficient land to replace them with interchanges. In some US states, a super-2 expressway is simply referred to as a super-2, regardless of whether it is fully controlled-access or not. Highway 410 in Ontario was originally a super-2 before being upgraded to a full freeway. Similarly, most of Highway 102 in Nova Scotia was a super-2 for three decades before being upgraded. Many super-2 expressways are simply just short transitional segments between surface street and four-lane divided freeways.\n\nA '''super-4 expressway''' is a multi-lane divided highway with at-grade intersections, although the highway will become a full controlled-access freeway if the intersections are replaced with interchanges. A super-4 may have been a super-2 that has been twinned, although such instances of super-4 intermediaries are rare as super-2s are often upgraded right away to full freeways. Highway 40 in Ontario is a super-4 expressway between Highway 402 and Wellington St., and from Indian Rd to Rokeby Line. The remaining sections of Highway 40 are super-2 expressways. Other super-4 expressways include the [[Hanlon Parkway]] in Guelph and [[Black Creek Drive]] in Toronto, both which have sufficient right of way to allow for interchanges and overpasses to replace the at-grade crossings.\n\nWhen a super-2 expressway is converted to a four-lane divided freeway, conversion artifacts such as double yellow lines, or broken yellow lines in passing zones are usually cleanly bestowed in favor of more consistent [[road marking]] for four-lane divided expressways.\n\n==List of two-lane freeways==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2008}}\n{{Expand list|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Argentina===\n*[[National Route 38 (Argentina)|National Route 38]], between [[Famaill\u00e1]] and [[Juan Bautista Alberdi, Tucum\u00e1n|Juan Bautista Alberdi]] in [[Tucum\u00e1n Province]].\n\n===Australia===\n[[Image:Bypass2.jpg|thumb|The [[Kingston Bypass]]]]\n* In [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], the [[Mornington Peninsula Freeway]], is a two-lane freeway between the interchange with Jetty Road and the interchange with Boneo Road at 90&nbsp;km/h.\n* In [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], the [[Cunningham Highway]], is a two-lane freeway between Warwick Road and Ripley Road, After Ripley Road the [[Cunningham Highway]] is grade separated until it meets the [[Ipswich Motorway]], M2.\n* In [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]]; [[Kingston Bypass]] has been constructed as a two-Lane expressway,<ref name=\"dier\">{{cite web |year = 2011 |url = http://www.transport.tas.gov.au/infrastructure_projects/kingston_bypass |title = Kingston Bypass |publisher = [[Department of Infrastructure, Energy and Resources]] |accessdate = 15 November 2011 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111103073636/http://www.transport.tas.gov.au/infrastructure_projects/kingston_bypass |archivedate = 3 November 2011 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"parliament\">{{cite web |year = 2009 |url = http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/ctee/REPORTS/Kingston%20Bypass.pdf |title = Channel Highway, Kingston Bypass |publisher = [[Government of Tasmania]] |accessdate = 15 November 2011 }}</ref> with provision for [[dual carriageway]] in the future when needed.<ref name=\"dier\" /><ref name=\"parliament\" />\n* In north-eastern [[Tasmania]], the [[Bass Highway (Tasmania)|Bass Highway]] has some grade-separated interchanges, and the standard rural freeway 110&nbsp;km/h speed limit, but with some sections having only two lanes.\n* On the [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine Coast]] in [[Queensland]], the [[Sunshine Motorway]] is a two-lane freeway between Kawana Way and Nicklin Way, and again between David Low Way and Emu Mountain Road (although it has a [[roundabout]] in this section).\n* In [[Townsville]], [[Queensland]], the future [[Townsville Ring Road]] is planned to be the future route of [[Highway 1 (Australia)|Highway 1]] through the city. The first stage of the project, the two-laned [[Douglas Arterial Road]] opened in April 2005. Once all four stages are built, it will have two lanes in each direction, and be designated as the M1.\n* [[Canberra]]'s [[Gungahlin Drive Extension]] (GDE) was constructed as a two-lane grade-separated freeway for part of its length.

However, most of these have been built with low overpasses wide enough to accommodate only two-lanes, which indicates that there is no intent to widen them into freeways in the foreseeable future. In [[German language|German]] this type of road is called an ''[[Autostrasse]]''.\n* In Germany rural segments of the [[Bundesautobahn 8|A 8]] in the Saarland (between Saarlouis and the Luxembourg border), the [[Bundesautobahn 60|A 60]] from the exit for [[Pr\u00fcm]] to the [[Belgium|Belgian]] border, and the [[Bundesautobahn 62|A 62]] between the [[Bundesautobahn 6|A 6]] and the A 8, are two lanes (or, in the former two cases, 2 + 1 with an extra climbing lane). Unlike the Autostrassen previously mentioned, these segments are built to Autobahn standards but with only one carriageway; all of the overpasses, culverts and short bridges, cuttings and earthworks are wide enough for twin carriageways, and only some long bridges would need to be dualized for upgrading to a full 4- or 5-lane Autobahn.\n* In [[Croatia]], the [[Istrian Y]] highway complex used to consist out of two-lane freeways, which were due to be upgraded to four-lane ones, should the traffic increase. The complex is classified as consisting of expressways and as such has a general speed limit of {{convert|110|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, although a limit of {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} tends to be more prevalent there. However, as the traffic increases came sooner than it was predicted, the status of Istrian Y was changed to [[semi-highway]], as a widening to four or six lanes is already in progress.\n*Highway 19 in the [[Czech Republic]] is a two-lane expressway between Highway 3 and [[Zahradka]].\n*Some of the motorways in former German areas in Poland were originally two-lane expressways when built in the 1930s. Currently the road from [[Elbl\u0105g]] to [[Kaliningrad]] in [[Russia]] is still two-lane and in Poland is signed as [[Expressway S22 (Poland)|expressway S22]].\n*In [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]], a large amount of two-lane expressways were built in the period 1960-1990 (Sweden) and 1970-2000 (Norway). In addition, some have been built in Denmark. Only a few such roads have been built recently because there were many serious accidents. Many have been widened to four-lane expressways. Those remaining have, in Sweden, been converted to [[2+1 road]]s with a barrier between the directions. In Norway and many other European countries the two-lane expressways are too narrow to convert to 2+1-road if they are not widened.\n\n===Indonesia===\n*The part of [[Semarang Toll Road]], the Jatingaleh-Krapyak section, was a two-lane expressway. That section has since been upgraded into four-lane expressway.\n*The part of [[Belmera Toll Road]] from Amplas Interchange to southern terminus was a two-lane expressway. That section has since been upgraded into four-lane expressway.\n\n===Japan===\n[[Image:ObihiroHirooExpwy.jpg|thumb|two-lane expressway in [[Obihiro, Hokkaido]], Japan]]\nWhile most expressways in Japan are four-lane divided expressways with median barriers, some expressways in rural areas are two-lane expressways, such as some sections of the [[Hokkaid\u014d Expressway]]. The two-lane expressways in Japan are built in the same manner as the ordinary four-lane expressways with grade-separated interchanges and full access control, allowing future conversions to full four-lane divided expressways.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.c-nexco.co.jp/english/pdf/nexco_english.pdf |title = NEXCO-Central Business Outline |accessdate = 13 April 2008 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref>\n\n===Malaysia===\n[[File:Hezery99-SKVE Section 3.JPG|thumb|The two-lane expressway section of the [[South Klang Valley Expressway]] E26 in Malaysia]]\n[[File:Sungai Johor Bridge at Senai-Desaru Expressway.JPG|thumb|The [[Sungai Johor Bridge]] and two-lane expressway as be seen from the westbound of [[Senai\u2013Desaru Expressway]] in May 2016]]\n\nThe two-lane expressway is not a new concept in [[Malaysia]], as the [[Kuala Lumpur\u2013Karak Expressway]] was initially a two-lane toll expressway before being upgraded to a full expressway in 1997.<ref>{{cite news |title = Lebuh raya dua lorong Cahaya Baru-Penawar ikut piawai LLM |publisher = [[Berita Harian]] |date = 27 June 2011 <!--|accessdate = 6 July 2011--> |language = ms }}</ref> While the full four-lane divided toll expressways are more favored in recent years due to their higher traffic capacity, a few two-lane expressways do exist, such as the [[Kempas Highway]] and the [[North Klang Straits Bypass]]. These expressways, however, only have partial access control with at-grade intersections commonly available like most other federal and state roads. Nevertheless, these two-lane highways are still classified as \"two-lane expressways\" as they are maintained by highway concessionaires, namely [[PLUS Expressways Berhad]] (Kempas Highway) and Shapadu (North Klang Straits Bypass).\nMeanwhile, the [[South Klang Valley Expressway]] at Teluk Panglima Garang is a two-lane carriageway making it the first true two-lane expressway in Klang Valley and the second in Malaysia.\n\nThe first true two-lane expressway with [[controlled-access highway|full access control]] is the section of the [[Senai\u2013Desaru Expressway]] between Cahaya Baru and Penawar.<ref name=\"blogjalanraya\">{{cite web |url = http://blogjalanraya.blogspot.com/2012/08/reviu-eksklusif-lebuhraya-senai-desaru.html |title = Reviu eksklusif Lebuhraya Senai-Desaru E22 |publisher = Blog Jalan Raya Malaysia |language = Malay |date = 23 August 2012 |accessdate = 12 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Mexico===\n*A new Super-2 bypass of [[Mexicali]] (MEX-2D) was completed in summer 2006.

Three interchanges exist\u2014one at each end, and one in the middle, providing access to MEX-5 (north to downtown Mexicali and south to [[San Felipe, Baja California|San Felipe]]). The road has complete control of access. According to a toll collector, this Super-2 is scheduled for an upgrade to a full toll freeway (four lanes, two in each direction) by sometime in 2008. Eventually, this freeway may be constructed all the way to [[San Luis R\u00edo Colorado]], replacing the existing four lane undivided highway, MEX-2.\n*A Super-2 toll road, MEX-150D and MEX-190D (MEX-150D travels to [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]]), connects [[Mexico City]] and [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca]].\n*A Super-2 bypass of [[Poza Rica, Veracruz]], was finished in 2005.

After 1992, South Korean Government planned to widen all two-lane expressways into four-lane. All expressways except [[88 Olympic Expressway]] (Route 12) has been widened before 2004. 88 Olympic Expressway was the last two-lane limited access tollway of South Korea, for 144 of its 183 kilometers, between exits 14 (Damyang) and 26 (East Goryeong). Although a service rating of two-lane section was poor, still they were fully integrated into South Korea's ticketed tollway system.

Median construction has alleviated this problem somewhat.\n*[[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]], from [[Erving, Massachusetts|Erving]] to the eastern [[U.S. Route 202 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 202]] interchange in [[Phillipston, Massachusetts|Phillipston]].\n*[[Plimoth Plantation Highway]], a spur off [[Massachusetts Route 3|Route 3]] in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]].\n*[[U.S. Route 44 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 44]] from [[Massachusetts Route 105|Route 105]] in [[Middleborough, Massachusetts|Middleborough]] to [[Massachusetts Route 58|Route 58]] in [[Carver, Massachusetts|Carver]]. This stretch of highway has a [[guard rail]] that acts as a [[median barrier]].\n\n====Michigan====\n\n*A rare instance of a two-lane freeway that was restricted to only one direction of traffic existed in Michigan at one time, of which [[U.S. Route 16 in Michigan|U.S. Highway 16]] was restricted to eastbound traffic when bypassing [[Farmington, Michigan]]. This rare instance permitted passing traffic without the liability of a head-on collision, though this changed when it was upgraded to a four-lane divided freeway which became [[Interstate 96|I-96]], and later [[M-102 (Michigan highway)|M-102]], then [[M-5 (Michigan highway)|M-5]].\n\n====Minnesota====\n\n*[[U.S. Route 12 in Minnesota|U.S. Highway 12]] bypasses around [[Long Lake, Minnesota|Long Lake]], from [[Wayzata, Minnesota|Wayzata]] to [[Orono, Minnesota|Orono]]. Originally built without a median, a median was installed in September 2016 in response to the highway's high accident rate.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.startribune.com/highway-of-death-to-get-center-divider/381814241/ |title = Hwy. 12 in Western Hennepin County\u2014the 'Corridor of Death'\u2014to Get Center Divider: MnDOT Will Build the Concrete Median on a Deadly Stretch of Hwy. 12. |first = Tim |last = Harlow |work= Star Tribune |location= Minneapolis |date = June 3, 2016 |access-date= September 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Missouri====\n\n*[[U.S. Route 54 in Missouri|U.S. Route 54]] bypasses [[Mexico, Missouri]], on a two-lane expressway around the city.

The divided highway begins just east of the West Mexico Interchange, while the east end is only a set of ramps to eventually be connected to the planned expressway.\n\n====New Hampshire====\n\n* [[Interstate 93]] (Franconia Notch Parkway) from [[Lincoln, New Hampshire|Lincoln]] (mile marker 113) to [[Franconia, New Hampshire|Franconia]] (mile marker 121), due to fears that building a four-lane highway would destabilize the [[Old Man of the Mountain]], long before the rock formation's natural collapse from erosion occurred on 3 May 2003. The highway was constructed with a median divider. This segment of I-93 is now the only Interstate highway with fewer than four lanes.\n*[[Laconia, New Hampshire|Laconia]] Bypass ([[U.S. Route 3]] and [[New Hampshire Route 11]])\n*[[New Hampshire Route 101]] from [[Milford, New Hampshire|Milford]] to [[Amherst, New Hampshire|Amherst]] and again from exit 13 ([[New Hampshire Route 27]]) in [[Hampton, New Hampshire|Hampton]] to Highland Avenue at [[Hampton Beach, New Hampshire|Hampton Beach]].

There is a full cloverleaf at Halls Mill, a westbound entrance at Howell Road, and full access from Fairfield Road.\n\n====New York====\n\n*An example of a two-lane [[parkway]] is [[Bethpage State Parkway]] on [[Long Island]]. This was constructed by [[Robert Moses]] as a two-lane freeway in part due to aesthetics. Like most parkways (especially those created by Moses), the road was originally meant to deliver a pleasurable motoring experience, and as such incorporates natural scenery, as well as pedestrian and bicycle trails for those who choose not to drive.\n*[[New York State Route 104]] has two-lane freeway sections between [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] and [[Oswego, New York|Oswego]]. It was originally intended to become a freeway, but only one set of lanes were built.\n*[[New York State Route 85]] near [[Albany, New York|Albany]] contains a section of approximately {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} of two-lane expressway extending from the Albany city line to the roundabout at Blessing Road. This section, colloquially known as the Slingerlands Bypass, was originally constructed as two lanes of a four-lane expressway when it was designed in the 1940s and 1950s. However, the remaining two lanes were never completed. In the future, the unused portions of adjacent land could easily be used to construct the two lanes originally planned, with minimal effort, if necessary. This is due to the fact that most of the grading and drainage is already present from the original construction work.\n*[[New York State Route 5S]] has a two-lane freeway section between Ilion and its junction with [[New York State Route 28]]. The highway is a divided four-lane freeway west of this, extending to Utica.\n\n====North Carolina====\n\n* [[U.S. Route 1 in North Carolina|U.S. Highway 1]] between [[Cary, North Carolina|Cary]] and [[Sanford, North Carolina|Sanford]] (exits 70 and 98) was a two-lane freeway until its expansion to four divided lanes in the late 1990s.\n* [[U.S. Route 17 in North Carolina|U.S. Highway 17]] between exits 224 and 229 in the [[Edenton, North Carolina|Edenton]] area was a two-lane freeway until the late 1990s.\n* [[U.S. Route 64 in North Carolina|U.S. Highway 64]] between exits 457 and 463 in the [[Nashville, North Carolina|Nashville]] area was a two-lane freeway until the late 70s.\n* [[U.S. Route 421 in North Carolina|U.S. Highway 421]] was originally constructed with three two-lane freeway segments\u2014the first between [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]] and [[Yadkinville, North Carolina|Yadkinville]], with the second sections as part of a bypass around the towns of [[North Wilkesboro, North Carolina|North Wilkesboro]] and [[Wilkesboro, North Carolina|Wilkesboro]].

It may be built that way because of constraints, or may be intended for expansion once traffic volumes rise. The term [[super two]] is often used by [[roadgeek]]s for this type of road, but [[Traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineer]]s use that term for a high-quality surface road. Most of these roads are not tolled.\n\nA somewhat related concept is a \"four-lane undivided expressway\". This is much rarer; a former example is some sections of [[U.S. Route 101]] in northern [[California]].\n\nIn Europe, the concept of ''express road'', is related to road which are classed between a motorway and an ordinary road. This concept is recognized both by European union law and by [[UNECE]] treaty. This type of road is not very standardized, and its geometry may vary from country to country or within a same country. Those road are usually, but not always, reserved for motorized vehicle, and accessible with [[Limited-access road]] (see [[:fr:Voie rapide]]). Some European union regulation considers the high-quality roads are roads \u00abwhich play an important role in long-distance freight and passenger traffic, integrate the main urban and economic centres, interconnect with other transport modes and link mountainous, remote, landlocked and peripheral NUTS 2 regions to central regions of the Union\u00bb. According to this same regulation \u00abHigh-quality roads shall be specially designed and built for motor traffic, and shall be either motorways, express roads or conventional strategic roads.\u00bb\n\n==Justification==\nTwo-lane freeways are usually built as a temporary solution due to lack of funds, as an [[environmental movement|environmental]] compromise or as a way to overcome problems constrained from highway reconstruction when there are four lanes or more. If the road is widened, the existing road is typically allocated to traffic going in one direction, and the lanes for the other direction are built as a whole new roadbed adjacent to the existing one. When upgraded in this manner, the road becomes a typical freeway. Many two-lane freeways are built so that when the road is upgraded to a proper divided freeway, the existing overpasses and ramps do not need reconstruction.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nA '''super-2 expressway''' is a high-speed surface road with at-grade intersections, depending on the common usage of the term expressway in the area. By this definition, Super-2s can be considered the first stage of project which is expected to become a full freeway, with the transportation authority owning the land necessary for the future adjacent carriageway. At-grade intersections exist but there is sufficient land to replace them with interchanges. In some US states, a super-2 expressway is simply referred to as a super-2, regardless of whether it is fully controlled-access or not. Highway 410 in Ontario was originally a super-2 before being upgraded to a full freeway. Similarly, most of Highway 102 in Nova Scotia was a super-2 for three decades before being upgraded. Many super-2 expressways are simply just short transitional segments between surface street and four-lane divided freeways.\n\nA '''super-4 expressway''' is a multi-lane divided highway with at-grade intersections, although the highway will become a full controlled-access freeway if the intersections are replaced with interchanges. A super-4 may have been a super-2 that has been twinned, although such instances of super-4 intermediaries are rare as super-2s are often upgraded right away to full freeways. Highway 40 in Ontario is a super-4 expressway between Highway 402 and Wellington St., and from Indian Rd to Rokeby Line. The remaining sections of Highway 40 are super-2 expressways. Other super-4 expressways include the [[Hanlon Parkway]] in Guelph and [[Black Creek Drive]] in Toronto, both which have sufficient right of way to allow for interchanges and overpasses to replace the at-grade crossings.\n\nWhen a super-2 expressway is converted to a four-lane divided freeway, conversion artifacts such as double yellow lines, or broken yellow lines in passing zones are usually cleanly bestowed in favor of more consistent [[road marking]] for four-lane divided expressways.\n\n==List of two-lane freeways==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2008}}\n{{Expand list|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Argentina===\n*[[National Route 38 (Argentina)|National Route 38]], between [[Famaill\u00e1]] and [[Juan Bautista Alberdi, Tucum\u00e1n|Juan Bautista Alberdi]] in [[Tucum\u00e1n Province]].\n\n===Australia===\n[[Image:Bypass2.jpg|thumb|The [[Kingston Bypass]]]]\n* In [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], the [[Mornington Peninsula Freeway]], is a two-lane freeway between the interchange with Jetty Road and the interchange with Boneo Road at 90&nbsp;km/h.\n* In [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], the [[Cunningham Highway]], is a two-lane freeway between Warwick Road and Ripley Road, After Ripley Road the [[Cunningham Highway]] is grade separated until it meets the [[Ipswich Motorway]], M2.\n* In [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]]; [[Kingston Bypass]] has been constructed as a two-Lane expressway,<ref name=\"dier\">{{cite web |year = 2011 |url = http://www.transport.tas.gov.au/infrastructure_projects/kingston_bypass |title = Kingston Bypass |publisher = [[Department of Infrastructure, Energy and Resources]] |accessdate = 15 November 2011 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111103073636/http://www.transport.tas.gov.au/infrastructure_projects/kingston_bypass |archivedate = 3 November 2011 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"parliament\">{{cite web |year = 2009 |url = http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/ctee/REPORTS/Kingston%20Bypass.pdf |title = Channel Highway, Kingston Bypass |publisher = [[Government of Tasmania]] |accessdate = 15 November 2011 }}</ref> with provision for [[dual carriageway]] in the future when needed.<ref name=\"dier\" /><ref name=\"parliament\" />\n* In north-eastern [[Tasmania]], the [[Bass Highway (Tasmania)|Bass Highway]] has some grade-separated interchanges, and the standard rural freeway 110&nbsp;km/h speed limit, but with some sections having only two lanes.\n* On the [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine Coast]] in [[Queensland]], the [[Sunshine Motorway]] is a two-lane freeway between Kawana Way and Nicklin Way, and again between David Low Way and Emu Mountain Road (although it has a [[roundabout]] in this section).\n* In [[Townsville]], [[Queensland]], the future [[Townsville Ring Road]] is planned to be the future route of [[Highway 1 (Australia)|Highway 1]] through the city.

However, most of these have been built with low overpasses wide enough to accommodate only two-lanes, which indicates that there is no intent to widen them into freeways in the foreseeable future. In [[German language|German]] this type of road is called an ''[[Autostrasse]]''.\n* In Germany rural segments of the [[Bundesautobahn 8|A 8]] in the Saarland (between Saarlouis and the Luxembourg border), the [[Bundesautobahn 60|A 60]] from the exit for [[Pr\u00fcm]] to the [[Belgium|Belgian]] border, and the [[Bundesautobahn 62|A 62]] between the [[Bundesautobahn 6|A 6]] and the A 8, are two lanes (or, in the former two cases, 2 + 1 with an extra climbing lane). Unlike the Autostrassen previously mentioned, these segments are built to Autobahn standards but with only one carriageway; all of the overpasses, culverts and short bridges, cuttings and earthworks are wide enough for twin carriageways, and only some long bridges would need to be dualized for upgrading to a full 4- or 5-lane Autobahn.\n* In [[Croatia]], the [[Istrian Y]] highway complex used to consist out of two-lane freeways, which were due to be upgraded to four-lane ones, should the traffic increase. The complex is classified as consisting of expressways and as such has a general speed limit of {{convert|110|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, although a limit of {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} tends to be more prevalent there. However, as the traffic increases came sooner than it was predicted, the status of Istrian Y was changed to [[semi-highway]], as a widening to four or six lanes is already in progress.\n*Highway 19 in the [[Czech Republic]] is a two-lane expressway between Highway 3 and [[Zahradka]].\n*Some of the motorways in former German areas in Poland were originally two-lane expressways when built in the 1930s. Currently the road from [[Elbl\u0105g]] to [[Kaliningrad]] in [[Russia]] is still two-lane and in Poland is signed as [[Expressway S22 (Poland)|expressway S22]].\n*In [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]], a large amount of two-lane expressways were built in the period 1960-1990 (Sweden) and 1970-2000 (Norway). In addition, some have been built in Denmark. Only a few such roads have been built recently because there were many serious accidents. Many have been widened to four-lane expressways. Those remaining have, in Sweden, been converted to [[2+1 road]]s with a barrier between the directions. In Norway and many other European countries the two-lane expressways are too narrow to convert to 2+1-road if they are not widened.\n\n===Indonesia===\n*The part of [[Semarang Toll Road]], the Jatingaleh-Krapyak section, was a two-lane expressway.

This section, colloquially known as the Slingerlands Bypass, was originally constructed as two lanes of a four-lane expressway when it was designed in the 1940s and 1950s. However, the remaining two lanes were never completed. In the future, the unused portions of adjacent land could easily be used to construct the two lanes originally planned, with minimal effort, if necessary. This is due to the fact that most of the grading and drainage is already present from the original construction work.\n*[[New York State Route 5S]] has a two-lane freeway section between Ilion and its junction with [[New York State Route 28]].

A new concept was evolved to address these issues and enable organizations to dynamically, collaboratively, and cost-effectively integrate, optimize, and configure their manufacturing units and supply networks.

However, manufacturers struggle to find balance maintenance strategies without compromising the system's reliability or productivity. Intelligent Maintenance Systems are designed to provide support tools for decision making to optimize maintenance operations. Intelligent prognostic and health management tools are necessary to identify practical, reliable, and cost-saving maintenance strategies to ensure nZDM in production, consistently. Dr. Jay Lee {{fact|date=April 2020}} first introduced the nZDM concept in 2000 while working for NSF I/UCRC<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/iucrc/home.jsp|title=NSF IUCRC {{!}} Home|website=www.nsf.gov|access-date=2020}}</ref> in the area of Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS).

As a result, manufacturers were pressurized to improve their responsivity and efficiency in terms of product development, operations, lead times, resource utilization, and quality control, which were coupled with complex supply chain networks, [[manufacturing execution system]]<nowiki/>s (MES) and [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) systems. A new concept was evolved to address these issues and enable organizations to dynamically, collaboratively, and cost-effectively integrate, optimize, and configure their manufacturing units and supply networks. This concept was called E-manufacturing<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jay|last2=Wang|first2=Haixia|date=2008|title=New Technologies for Maintenance|journal=Complex System Maintenance Handbook|series=Springer Series in Reliability Engineering|language=en|publisher=Springer|pages=49\u201378|doi=10.1007/978-1-84800-011-7_3|isbn=978-1-84800-010-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=David Zhengwen|last2=Anosike|first2=Anthony Ikechukwu|last3=Lim|first3=Ming Kim|last4=Akanle|first4=Oluwaremilekun Mowanuola|date=2006|title=An agent-based approach for e-manufacturing and supply chain integration|journal=Computers & Industrial Engineering|volume=51|issue=2|pages=343\u2013360|doi=10.1016/j.cie.2006.02.012}}</ref>, which was first envisioned by AMR Research Inc. in 2000<ref>{{cite journal|title=AMR Advanced Market Research - Global Data Collection CATI & Online|url=https://amr-research.com/en/|journal=AMR}}</ref> and conceptualized by Lee et al.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jay|date=2003|title=E-manufacturing\u2014fundamental, tools, and transformation|journal=Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing|volume=19|issue=6|pages=501\u2013507|doi=10.1016/S0736-5845(03)00060-7}}</ref> in 2002. The concept was defined as: \u201cE-manufacturing is a systematic methodology that enables the manufacturing operations to successfully integrate with the functional objectives of an enterprise through the use of the Internet, tether-free (i.e., wireless, web, etc.) and predictive technologies.\u201d E-Manufacturing paradigm was enabled by the ubiquitous internet and telecommunication facilities (i.e. wireless, web, etc.), which helped manufacturing operators to achieve near-zero downtime (nZDM) performance and synchronize with the business systems.\n\nMaintenance operations are essential to minimize unplanned downtime, to assure product quality, to reduce customer dissatisfaction, and to maintain a competitive edge in the market. However, manufacturers struggle to find balanced maintenance strategies without compromising the system's reliability or productivity. Intelligent Maintenance Systems are designed to provide support tools for decision making to optimize maintenance operations. Intelligent prognostic and health management tools are necessary to identify practical, reliable, and cost-saving maintenance strategies to ensure nZDM in production, consistently. Dr. Jay Lee {{fact|date=April 2020}} first introduced the nZDM concept in 2000 while working for NSF I/UCRC<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/iucrc/home.jsp|title=NSF IUCRC {{!}} Home|website=www.nsf.gov|access-date=2020}}</ref> in the area of Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS). The key focus was to measure the degradation of machines and processes to predict and prevent potential issues. Analytical techniques based on Big Data, along with a systematic toolbox approach, were first proposed by the IMS Center in 2001.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jay|date=2003|title=E-manufacturing\u2014fundamental, tools, and transformation|journal=Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing|volume=19|issue=6|pages=501\u2013507|doi=10.1016/S0736-5845(03)00060-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://imscenter.net/|title=Intelligent maintenance system|language=en-us}}</ref>\n\n==Main Elements==\n\nNear-zero downtime manufacturing is based on two main technologies, namely (1) Accurate Diagnostics and (2) Real-time Prognostics{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}. Both of these technologies are described as follows: \n \n===Prognostics===\n\nPrognostics aims to make accurate predictions of the remaining useful life (RUL) of machinery before a failure occurs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Heng|first1=Aiwina|last2=Zhang|first2=Sheng|last3=Tan|first3=Andy C.C.|last4=Mathew|first4=Joseph|date=2009|title=Rotating machinery prognostics: State of the art, challenges and opportunities|journal=Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing|volume=23|issue=3|pages=724\u2013739|bibcode=2009MSSP...23..724H|doi=10.1016/j.ymssp.2008.06.009}}</ref> Current prognostic approaches can be categorized into three classes, namely model-based, data-driven and hybrid prognostics approaches.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Si|first1=Xiao-Sheng|last2=Wang|first2=Wenbin|last3=Hu|first3=Chang-Hua|last4=Zhou|first4=Dong-Hua|date=2011|title=Remaining useful life estimation \u2013 A review on the statistical data driven approaches|journal=European Journal of Operational Research|volume=213|issue=1|pages=1\u201314|doi=10.1016/j.ejor.2010.11.018}}</ref> Rotating machinery is of critical concern in the manufacturing industry. Hence, the majority of the studies in literature concentrated on prognostics and health management (PHM) applications, including but not limited to, standard rotary machinery components, such as bearings, gears, shafts, and motors.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jay|last2=Wu|first2=Fangji|last3=Zhao|first3=Wenyu|last4=Ghaffari|first4=Masoud|last5=Liao|first5=Linxia|last6=Siegel|first6=David|date=2014|title=Prognostics and health management design for rotary machinery systems\u2014Reviews, methodology and applications|journal=Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing|volume=42|issue=1\u20132|pages=314\u2013334|bibcode=2014MSSP...42..314L|doi=10.1016/j.ymssp.2013.06.004}}</ref> A significant contribution has been made in are using vibration signals for prognostics.
