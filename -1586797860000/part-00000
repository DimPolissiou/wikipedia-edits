People dying may precede the survivors in this state, which typically comes with a calm, retrospective view for the individual, and a stable condition of emotions.\n\nIn a book co-authored with [[David_Kessler_(writer)|David Kessler]] and published posthumously, K\u00fcbler-Ross expanded her model to include any form of personal loss, such as the death of a loved one, the loss of a job or income, major [[Social rejection|rejection]], the end of a relationship or [[divorce]], [[drug addiction]], [[incarceration]], the onset of a [[disease]] or an [[infertility]] diagnosis, and even minor losses, such as a loss of insurance coverage.<ref name=GriefGrieving>{{Cite book |title=On grief & grieving : finding the meaning of grief through the five stages of loss |last=K\u00fcbler-Ross |first=Elisabeth |date=2014 |publisher=Scribner |last2=Kessler |first2=David | name-list-format = vanc |isbn=9781476775555 |location=New York |oclc=863077888}}</ref> Kessler has also proposed \"Meaning\" as a sixth stage of grief.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H920DwAAQBAJ |title = Finding Meaning: The Sixth Stage of Grief|isbn = 9781501192739|last1 = Kessler|first1 = David|date = 5 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nCriticisms of this five-stage model of grief center mainly on a lack of [[empirical research]] and [[empirical evidence]] supporting the stages as described by K\u00fcbler-Ross and, to the contrary, empirical support for other modes of the expression of grief.

In December, an alliance was formed between groups in New York and Connecticut.  January bore witness to a correspondence link between Boston and New York City, and by March, Providence had initiated connections with New York, [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], and [[Newport, Rhode Island]].  March also marked the emergence of Sons of Liberty organizations in New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia.\n\nIn Boston, another example of violence could be found in their treatment of local stamp distributor [[Andrew Oliver]]. They burned his effigy in the streets. When he did not resign, they escalated to burning down his office building. Even after he resigned, they almost destroyed the whole house of his close associate Lieutenant Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]]. It is believed that the Sons of Liberty did this to excite the lower classes and get them actively involved in rebelling against the authorities.

The Sons of Liberty were able to gain enough seats in the New York assembly elections of December 1784 to have passed a set of punitive laws against Loyalists. In violation of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], they called for the confiscation of the property of Loyalists.<ref>Schecter, pg. 382</ref> [[Alexander Hamilton]] defended the Loyalists, citing the supremacy of the treaty.\n\n==Flags==\nIn 1767, the Sons of Liberty adopted a flag called the ''rebellious stripes flag'' with nine vertical stripes, four white and five red.

Miller, ''Origins of the American Revolution'' (Boston, 1943) p. 74.</ref> The British passed a series of taxes aimed at the colonists, and many of the colonists refused to pay certain taxes; they argued that they should not be held accountable for taxes which were decided upon without any form of their consent through a representative.

In August 1765, the group was founded in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]].<ref>Anger, p. 135</ref>  By November 6, a committee was set up in [[New York (state)|New York]] to correspond with other colonies. In December, an alliance was formed between groups in New York and Connecticut.  January bore witness to a correspondence link between Boston and New York City, and by March, Providence had initiated connections with New York, [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], and [[Newport, Rhode Island]].  March also marked the emergence of Sons of Liberty organizations in New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia.\n\nIn Boston, another example of violence could be found in their treatment of local stamp distributor [[Andrew Oliver]]. They burned his effigy in the streets. When he did not resign, they escalated to burning down his office building. Even after he resigned, they almost destroyed the whole house of his close associate Lieutenant Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]]. It is believed that the Sons of Liberty did this to excite the lower classes and get them actively involved in rebelling against the authorities. Their actions made many of the stamp distributors resign in fear.\n\nEarly in the American Revolution, the former Sons of Liberty generally joined more formal groups, such as the [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]].\n\nThe Sons of Liberty popularized the use of [[tarring and feathering|tar and feathering]] to punish and humiliate offending government officials starting in 1767. This method was also used against British Loyalists during the American Revolution. This punishment had long been used by sailors to punish their mates.<ref>Benjamin H.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1559903 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n===New York===\nIn December 1773, a new group calling itself the Sons of Liberty issued and distributed a declaration in New York City called the ''Association of the Sons of Liberty in New York,\" which formally stated that they were opposed to the [[Tea Act]] and that anyone who assisted in the execution of the act was \"an enemy to the liberties of America\" and that \"whoever shall transgress any of these resolutions, we will not deal with, or employ, or have any connection with him.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=T.

In March 1784, they rallied an enormous crowd that called for the expulsion of any remaining Loyalists from the state starting May 1. The Sons of Liberty were able to gain enough seats in the New York assembly elections of December 1784 to have passed a set of punitive laws against Loyalists. In violation of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], they called for the confiscation of the property of Loyalists.<ref>Schecter, pg. 382</ref> [[Alexander Hamilton]] defended the Loyalists, citing the supremacy of the treaty. \n\n==Flags==\nIn 1767, the Sons of Liberty adopted a flag called the ''rebellious stripes flag'' with nine vertical stripes, four white and five red. [[Ensign of the United States|A flag having 13 horizontal red and white stripes]] was used by Commodore [[Esek Hopkins]] (Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Navy) and by American merchant ships during the war.

Returning to its original name (the \"WWE Draft\") and a traditional draft format, it was the second draft of 2019, following April's [[2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up|Superstar Shake-up]]. The draft began on the October 11 episode of ''[[Friday Night SmackDown]]'' (in [[Paradise, Nevada]]) and concluded on the October 14 episode of ''[[Monday Night Raw]]'' (in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]), with ''SmackDown'' airing on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] and ''Raw'' on the [[USA Network]]. It was the first draft in which the brand's television networks were presented as having an influence over WWE's drafting decisions. \n\n2019 was the first year in which the WWE held two drafts during the same calendar year. This was because of the issues of the [[2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up#Wild Card Rule|Wild Card Rule]] introduced with April's Superstar Shake-up and even more so because of ''SmackDown''{{'}}s move to FOX\u2014''Raw'' and ''SmackDown'' were both previously on the USA Network. Over 70 wrestlers (both singles competitors and tag teams) from the Raw, SmackDown, [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]], and [[205 Live (WWE brand)|205 Live]] rosters were eligible to be drafted to either Raw or SmackDown, including all Raw and SmackDown champions. Most draft picks were announced on the live broadcasts of ''SmackDown'' and ''Raw'', while supplemental picks were announced afterwards via WWE's website. In storyline, wrestlers who were not drafted to either brand became free agents and could sign with the brand of their choosing. The Wild Card Rule also ended with this draft.\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\nIn April 2019, [[WWE]] held the [[2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up|Superstar Shake-up]], a [[WWE draft|draft]] between WWE's [[WWE brand extension|brands]] with a nontraditional format in which drafting decisions were made behind the scenes rather than on-screen.<ref name=\"Raw04152019\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/04/15/4-15-powells-wwe-raw-tv-review-the-2019-wwe-superstar-shakeup-night-one/|title=4/15 Powell's WWE Raw TV Review: The 2019 WWE Superstar Shakeup Night One|date=April 15, 2019|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=April 15, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Smackdown04162019\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/04/16/4-16-wwe-smackdown-live-results-barnetts-review-of-the-2019-wwe-superstar-shakeup-night-two-with-vince-mcmahon-introducing-the-brands-biggest-acquisition-paige-introduces-her-new-tag-team/|title=4/16 WWE Smackdown Live Results: Barnett's review of the 2019 WWE Superstar Shakeup Night Two with Vince McMahon introducing the brand's biggest acquisition, Paige introduces her new tag team|date=April 16, 2019|last=Barnett|first=Jake |work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref> Shortly after the Shake-up, WWE Chairman and CEO [[Vince McMahon]] introduced the [[2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up#Wild Card Rule|Wild Card Rule]], in which up to four wrestlers would be allowed to appear on the opposing brand's show by invitation for one night only with unsanctioned appearances penalized.<ref name=\"Raw05062019\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/05/06/5-6-wwe-raw-results-powells-review-of-roman-reigns-returning-to-raw-the-build-to-money-in-the-bank-continues/|title=5/6 WWE Raw Results: Powell's review of Roman Reigns returning to Raw, the build to Money in the Bank continues|date=May 6, 2019|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=May 6, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/article/raw-smackdown-live-wild-card-rule-explained|title=Mr. McMahon's new \"Wild Card Rule\" explained|date=May 6, 2019|last=Benigno|first=Anthony|work=[[WWE]].com|accessdate=May 7, 2019}}</ref> Following this, however, the Wild Card Rule's stipulations were not enforced, with numerous wrestlers freely appearing on both shows weekly without any penalties, blurring the lines between the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] brands.

Returning to its original name (the \"WWE Draft\") and a traditional draft format, it was the second draft of 2019, following April's [[2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up|Superstar Shake-up]]. The draft began on the October 11 episode of ''[[Friday Night SmackDown]]'' (in [[Paradise, Nevada]]) and concluded on the October 14 episode of ''[[Monday Night Raw]]'' (in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]), with ''SmackDown'' airing on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] and ''Raw'' on the [[USA Network]]. It was the first draft in which the brand's television networks were presented as having an influence over WWE's drafting decisions. \n\n2019 was the first year in which the WWE held two drafts during the same calendar year. This was because of the issues of the [[2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up#Wild Card Rule|Wild Card Rule]] introduced with April's Superstar Shake-up and even more so because of ''SmackDown''{{'}}s move to FOX\u2014''Raw'' and ''SmackDown'' were both previously on the USA Network. Over 70 wrestlers (both singles competitors and tag teams) from the Raw, SmackDown, [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]], and [[205 Live (WWE brand)|205 Live]] rosters were eligible to be drafted to either Raw or SmackDown, including all Raw and SmackDown champions. Most draft picks were announced on the live broadcasts of ''SmackDown'' and ''Raw'', while supplemental picks were announced afterwards via WWE's website. In storyline, wrestlers who were not drafted to either brand became free agents and could sign with the brand of their choosing. The Wild Card Rule also ended with this draft.\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\nIn April 2019, [[WWE]] held the [[2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up|Superstar Shake-up]], a [[WWE draft|draft]] between WWE's [[WWE brand extension|brands]] with a nontraditional format in which drafting decisions were made behind the scenes rather than on-screen.<ref name=\"Raw04152019\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/04/15/4-15-powells-wwe-raw-tv-review-the-2019-wwe-superstar-shakeup-night-one/|title=4/15 Powell's WWE Raw TV Review: The 2019 WWE Superstar Shakeup Night One|date=April 15, 2019|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=April 15, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Smackdown04162019\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/04/16/4-16-wwe-smackdown-live-results-barnetts-review-of-the-2019-wwe-superstar-shakeup-night-two-with-vince-mcmahon-introducing-the-brands-biggest-acquisition-paige-introduces-her-new-tag-team/|title=4/16 WWE Smackdown Live Results: Barnett's review of the 2019 WWE Superstar Shakeup Night Two with Vince McMahon introducing the brand's biggest acquisition, Paige introduces her new tag team|date=April 16, 2019|last=Barnett|first=Jake |work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref> Shortly after the Shake-up, WWE Chairman and CEO [[Vince McMahon]] introduced the [[2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up#Wild Card Rule|Wild Card Rule]], in which up to four wrestlers would be allowed to appear on the opposing brand's show by invitation for one night only with unsanctioned appearances penalized.<ref name=\"Raw05062019\">{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2019/05/06/5-6-wwe-raw-results-powells-review-of-roman-reigns-returning-to-raw-the-build-to-money-in-the-bank-continues/|title=5/6 WWE Raw Results: Powell's review of Roman Reigns returning to Raw, the build to Money in the Bank continues|date=May 6, 2019|last=Powell|first=Jason|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=May 6, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/article/raw-smackdown-live-wild-card-rule-explained|title=Mr. McMahon's new \"Wild Card Rule\" explained|date=May 6, 2019|last=Benigno|first=Anthony|work=[[WWE]].com|accessdate=May 7, 2019}}</ref> Following this, however, the Wild Card Rule's stipulations were not enforced, with numerous wrestlers freely appearing on both shows weekly without any penalties, blurring the lines between the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] brands.

The draft was announced to occur on the October 11 and 14 episodes of ''SmackDown'' and ''Raw'', respectively. Returning to its original name (the \"WWE Draft\") and a traditional draft format, personalities from FOX and NBCUniversal were scheduled to appear; the first time that television networks were presented as having an influence over WWE's drafting decisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/article/wwe-draft-coming-this-october|title=WWE Draft set for SmackDown on Oct. 11 and Raw on Oct. 14|date=September 15, 2019|author=WWE.com Staff|work=[[WWE]]|accessdate=September 15, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/new-wwe-draft-set-for-two-nights-in-october-2019-over-smackdown-raw-shows/|title=New WWE Draft set for two nights in October 2019 over SmackDown, Raw shows|date=September 15, 2019|last=Crosby|first=Jack|work=[[CBS Sports]]|accessdate=September 15, 2019}}</ref> The Wild Card Rule also ended with this draft.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/wwe/2019/09/17/wwe-confirms-wild-card-rule-dead-wwe-draft-raw-smackdown-live/|title=WWE Confirms the Wild Card Rule Will Be Gone After the WWE Draft|date=September 17, 2019|last=Casey|first=Connor|work=ComicBook.com|accessdate=September 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe picks were presented by personalities associated with [[Fox Sports]] and NBCUniversal properties, including Fox [[Fox MLB|MLB]] analyst [[Alex Rodriguez]], ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''{{'}}s [[Michael Che]] and [[Colin Jost]] (who performed in the [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant Memorial Battle Royal]] at [[WrestleMania 35]] earlier in 2019), ''[[Mr. Robot]]''{{'}}s [[Christian Slater]], ''[[Fox NFL]]'' lead commentators [[Joe Buck]] and [[Troy Aikman]], ''[[Mad Money]]'' host [[Jim Cramer]], Fox MLB analysts [[Kevin Burkhardt]] and [[Frank Thomas (designated hitter)|Frank Thomas]], ''[[Fox NFL Sunday]]''{{'}}s [[Terry Bradshaw]], [[Howie Long]], [[Michael Strahan]], [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]], and [[Tony Gonzalez]], NFL analysts [[Ronde Barber]], [[Charles Davis (defensive back)|Charles Davis]], [[Chris Spielman]], and [[Daryl Johnston]], ''[[Fox NFL Kickoff]]''{{'}}s [[Charissa Thompson]], [[Michael Vick]], and [[Peter Schrager]], ''[[Big Noon Kickoff]]''{{'}}s [[Rob Stone (sportscaster)|Rob Stone]] (former [[WWE 24/7 Champion]]), [[Brady Quinn]], [[Reggie Bush]], [[Matt Leinart]], and [[Urban Meyer]], ''[[Fox College Football]]'' analyst [[Joel Klatt]], [[Dul\u00e9 Hill]] from USA's ''[[Psych]]'' and ''[[Suits (American TV series)|Suits]]'', [[James Roday]] from ''Psych'', [[Marcus Lemonis]] from [[CNBC]]'s ''[[The Profit (TV series)|The Profit]]'', [[Margaret Josephs]] and [[Melissa Gorga]] from [[Bravo (American TV channel)|Bravo]]'s ''[[The Real Housewives of New Jersey]]'', [[Rodney Harrison]] and [[Chris Simms]] from NBC's ''[[Football Night in America]]'', and [[Rebecca Lowe]], [[Robbie Mustoe]], and [[Kyle Martino]] from ''Premier League Live''.<ref name=\"2019draftrules\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/article/star-studded-celebrity-lineup-including-alex-rodriguez-michael-che-and-colin-jost|title=Star-studded celebrity lineup, including Alex Rodriguez, Michael Che and Colin Jost, to take part in WWE Draft|date=October 10, 2019|work=[[WWE]].com|accessdate=October 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===2019 draft rules===\nThe rules of the draft were posted on WWE's website on October 10.<ref name=\"2019draftrules\"/> The list of eligible wrestlers was posted the same day.
