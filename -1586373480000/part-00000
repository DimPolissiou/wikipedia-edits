He is also and avid fan of WWE megastar John Cena. He is voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta|Barry White]] and first appeared on television, along with the rest of his family, in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] \"[[Good Night (The Simpsons short)|Good Night]]\" on April 19, 1987. Homer was created and designed by cartoonist [[Matt Groening]] while he was waiting in the lobby of [[James L. Brooks]]' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip ''[[Life in Hell]]'' but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the character after his father, Homer Groening. After appearing for three seasons on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', the Simpson family got their own series on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], which debuted December 17, 1989.\n\nAs patriarch of the [[Simpson family|eponymous family]], Homer and his wife [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] have three children: [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. As the family's provider, he works at the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]] as safety inspector. Homer embodies many [[Working class in the United States|American working class]] stereotypes: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, lazy, balding, clumsy, dim-witted, hot-tempered, childish, and addicted to beer, junk food and watching television. However, he often tries his hardest to be a decent man and is fiercely devoted to his family, especially when they need him the most. Despite the suburban [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going to [[Outer space|space]], climbing the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, fighting former President [[George H. W. Bush]] and winning a [[Grammy Award]] as a member of a barbershop quartet.\n\nIn the shorts and earlier episodes, Castellaneta voiced Homer with a loose impression of [[Walter Matthau]]; however, during the second and third seasons of the half-hour show, Homer's voice evolved to become more robust, to allow the expression of a fuller range of emotions. He has appeared in other media relating to ''The Simpsons''\u2014including video games, ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', [[The Simpsons Ride]], commercials, and comic books\u2014and inspired an entire line of merchandise. His signature catchphrase, the annoyed grunt \"[[D'oh!]]\", has been included in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of English|The New Oxford Dictionary of English]]'' since 1998 and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' since 2001.\n\nHomer is one of the most influential characters in the history of television, and is widely considered to be an American [[cultural icon]]. The British newspaper ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' described him as \"The greatest comic creation of [modern] time\". He was named the greatest character \"of the last 20 years\" in 2010 by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', was ranked the second-greatest cartoon character by ''[[TV Guide]]'', behind [[Bugs Bunny]], and was voted the greatest television character of all time by [[Channel 4]] viewers. For voicing Homer, Castellaneta has won four [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] and a special-achievement [[Annie Award]]. In 2000, Homer and his family were awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].\n\n==Role in ''The Simpsons''==\nHomer Jay Simpson is the bumbling husband of Marge and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=78\u201379}} He is the son of [[Mona Simpson (The Simpsons)|Mona]] and [[Grampa Simpson|Abraham \"Grampa\" Simpson]].

He is voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]] and first appeared on television, along with the rest of his family, in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] \"[[Good Night (The Simpsons short)|Good Night]]\" on April 19, 1987. Homer was created and designed by cartoonist [[Matt Groening]] while he was waiting in the lobby of [[James L. Brooks]]' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip ''[[Life in Hell]]'' but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the character after his father, Homer Groening. After appearing for three seasons on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', the Simpson family got their own series on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], which debuted December 17, 1989.\n\nAs patriarch of the [[Simpson family|eponymous family]], Homer and his wife [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] have three children: [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. As the family's provider, he works at the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]] as safety inspector. Homer embodies many [[Working class in the United States|American working class]] stereotypes: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, lazy, balding, clumsy, dim-witted, hot-tempered, childish, and addicted to beer, junk food and watching television. However, he often tries his hardest to be a decent man and is fiercely devoted to his family, especially when they need him the most. Despite the suburban [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going to [[Outer space|space]], climbing the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, fighting former President [[George H. W. Bush]] and winning a [[Grammy Award]] as a member of a barbershop quartet.\n\nIn the shorts and earlier episodes, Castellaneta voiced Homer with a loose impression of [[Walter Matthau]]; however, during the second and third seasons of the half-hour show, Homer's voice evolved to become more robust, to allow the expression of a fuller range of emotions. He has appeared in other media relating to ''The Simpsons''\u2014including video games, ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', [[The Simpsons Ride]], commercials, and comic books\u2014and inspired an entire line of merchandise. His signature catchphrase, the annoyed grunt \"[[D'oh!]]\", has been included in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of English|The New Oxford Dictionary of English]]'' since 1998 and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' since 2001.\n\nHomer is one of the most influential characters in the history of television, and is widely considered to be an American [[cultural icon]]. The British newspaper ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' described him as \"The greatest comic creation of [modern] time\". He was named the greatest character \"of the last 20 years\" in 2010 by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', was ranked the second-greatest cartoon character by ''[[TV Guide]]'', behind [[Bugs Bunny]], and was voted the greatest television character of all time by [[Channel 4]] viewers. For voicing Homer, Castellaneta has won four [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] and a special-achievement [[Annie Award]]. In 2000, Homer and his family were awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].\n\n==Role in ''The Simpsons''==\nHomer Jay Simpson is the bumbling husband of Marge and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=78\u201379}} He is the son of [[Mona Simpson (The Simpsons)|Mona]] and [[Grampa Simpson|Abraham \"Grampa\" Simpson]].

His teachers included Forel, Babinski and Freud. After his study, he worked in his father's pharmacy, but did not stay long. During the First World War he served on the Russian front. At this time he met the well-known Budapest opera singer Hedy Bendiner and married her. After the war, he worked as a journalist in various languages: he wrote in Hungarian for newspapers in Budapest and Kronstadt, he published German articles in Hermannstadt and Temeswar, and in Bucharest he worked for a respected Romanian press. <ref>https://kulturportal-west-ost.eu/biographien/fulop-miller-rene-2</ref>\n\nCuriosity and a thirst for knowledge led him to the Soviet Union to study its cultural life.

The book is still relevant as a deep analysis of the shipwreck of a state-censored culture. He followed this book with two more in quick succession, ''Lenin and Gandhi'' and ''Rasputin: The Holy Devil''. The first book contrasted the violent revolutionary and the peaceful rebel and the second, the contradiction of a holy man who was a magnet for women. His most successful book was ''The Power and Secret of the Jesuits'', which was still being reprinted after 1945.

He defined \"Americanism\" as a counter-cultural spirit to the world of faith. In ''Die Fantasiemaschine: Eine Saga der Gewinnsucht'' [\"''The Fantasy Machine: A Saga of Greed''\"] (1931), together with Joseph Gregor, he looked at the history of American theatre and cinema for evidence of the distorted image of the consumer world. This theme was continued in his English language essay, ''Dehumanization in Modern Society'' (1955). His first work of fiction was ''Katzenmusik [\"Caterwauling''\"] (dated 1936 but 1935; trans Richard Winston as ''Sing, Brat, Sing'' 1947), a satirical tale of a four year old musical prodigy.

(In approximately 2009, the prize was reorganised and by early 2015 took the form of the reward for an 8000 word essay on one of a number of set topics, open only to students of C Block.
