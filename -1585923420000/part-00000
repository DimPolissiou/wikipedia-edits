The table can be sorted by each different category.\n\nThe date of appointment as premier is the date on which they were sworn in by the [[Governor of Queensland|Governor]] for their first term. The day on which they departed office is the final day of their final term. This is either the day a new premier was appointed or their date of death if they died whilst in office.\n\n==Overview==\n\nThe [[median]] age of a Premier on the first day of their first term is roughly 48 years, and 240 days which falls between [[Russell Cooper]] and [[John Douglas (Queensland politician)|John Douglas]]. The youngest person to assume the office was [[Robert Herbert]] at 28 years and 181 days. The oldest person to assume office was [[Frank Cooper (Australian politician)|Frank Cooper]] at 70 years and 62 days.\n\nThe oldest living former Premier is [[Russell Cooper]], born 4 February 1941 (age {{age in years and days|1941|02|04}}). The youngest living former Premier is [[Campbell Newman]], born 12 August 1963, (age {{age in years and days|1963|08|12}}). The youngest living Premier is the incumbent [[Annastacia Palaszczuk]], born 25 July 1969, (age {{age in years and days|1969|07|25}}).\n\nThe longest-lived Premier was [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] who died on 23 April 2005 at the age of 94 years and 100 days. [[Arthur Edward Moore]] was the second longest-lived Premier, aged 86 years and 332 days, 7 years and 232 days short of Bjelke-Petersen. Bjelke-Petersen surpassed Moore's lifespan on 11 December 1997. The oldest living Premier, [[Russell Cooper]], will tie Moore if he lives to 2 January 2028, and tie Bjelke-Petersen if he lives to 15 May 2035. The shortest-lived Premier was [[Thomas Joseph Byrnes]] who died in office at the age of 37 years and 320 days on 27 September 1898.\n\nThe Premier with the longest retirement is [[Robert Herbert]]. He left office on 7 August 1866, and died 38 years and 272 days later on 6 May 1905. The Premier with the shortest retirement is [[James Robert Dickson]], who died on 10 January 1901, 1 year and 40 days after leaving office on 1 December 1899.\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n! #\n!

Of the 32 deceased premiers, 14 eventually became the oldest of their time, while 18 did not (including all 3 premiers who died in office, and 15 others). [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] became the oldest living premier when [[Vince Gair]] died in 1980 and remained so until his death in 2005, for a record 24 years and 163 days. [[Hugh Nelson (Australian politician)|Hugh Nelson]] became the oldest living premier after the death of [[Robert Herbert]], but he survived Herbert by only 240 days.\n\nOn two occasions the oldest living premier lost this distinction not by his death, but due to the appointment of a premier who was older. [[Robert Herbert]] lost this distinction when [[Arthur Macalister]] was appointed, but when [[John Douglas (Queensland politician)|John Douglas]] died in 1904 Herbert regained it again until his own death in 1905 for a total period of 6 years and 340 days. [[Arthur Macalister]] lost this distinction when [[Sir Robert Mackenzie, 10th Baronet|Robert Mackenzie]] was appointed, but regained it again when Mackenzie died in 1875, Consequently, Macalister too was the oldest living premier twice: first from 1866 to 1867 (from first appointment), and a second time from Mackenzie's death in 1873 until his own death in 1883 for a total period of 10 years and 15 days.\n\n[[Vince Gair]] was the oldest to acquire this distinction at the age of 76 years, and 338 days. [[Gordon Chalk]], who was aged 77 years, and 345 days when he died, on 26 April 1991 was the oldest premier to die without ever acquiring this distinction.

The table can be sorted by each different category.\n\nThe date of appointment as premier is the date on which they were sworn in by the [[Governor of Queensland|Governor]] for their first term. The day on which they departed office is the final day of their final term. This is either the day a new premier was appointed or their date of death if they died whilst in office.\n\n==Overview==\n\nThe [[median]] age of a Premier on the first day of their first term is roughly 48 years, and 240 days which falls between [[Russell Cooper]] and [[John Douglas (Queensland politician)|John Douglas]]. The youngest person to assume the office was [[Robert Herbert]] at 28 years and 181 days. The oldest person to assume office was [[Frank Cooper (Australian politician)|Frank Cooper]] at 70 years and 62 days.\n\nThe oldest living former Premier is [[Russell Cooper]], born 4 February 1941 (age {{age in years and days|1941|02|04}}). The youngest living former Premier is [[Campbell Newman]], born 12 August 1963, (age {{age in years and days|1963|08|12}}). The youngest living Premier is the incumbent [[Annastacia Palaszczuk]], born 25 July 1969, (age {{age in years and days|1969|07|25}}).\n\nThe longest-lived Premier was [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] who died on 23 April 2005 at the age of 94 years and 100 days. [[Arthur Edward Moore]] was the second longest-lived Premier, aged 86 years and 332 days, 7 years and 232 days short of Bjelke-Petersen. Bjelke-Petersen surpassed Moore's lifespan on 11 December 1997. The oldest living Premier, [[Russell Cooper]], will tie Moore if he lives to 2 January 2028, and tie Bjelke-Petersen if he lives to 15 May 2035. The shortest-lived Premier was [[Thomas Joseph Byrnes]] who died in office at the age of 37 years and 320 days on 27 September 1898.\n\nThe Premier with the longest retirement is [[Robert Herbert]]. He left office on 7 August 1866, and died 38 years and 272 days later on 6 May 1905. The Premier with the shortest retirement is [[James Robert Dickson]], who died on 10 Janunary 1901, 1 year and 40 days after leaving office on 1 December 1899.\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n! #\n!

Of the 32 deceased premiers, 14 eventually became the oldest of their time, while 18 did not (including all 3 premiers who died in office, and 15 others). [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] became the oldest living premier when [[Vince Gair]] died in 1980 and remained so until his death in 2005, for a record 24 years and 163 days. [[Hugh Nelson (Australian politician)|Hugh Nelson]] became the oldest living premier after the death of [[Robert Herbert]], but he survived Herbert by only 240 days.\n\nOn two occasions the oldest living premier lost this distinction not by his death, but due to the appointment of a premier who was older. [[Robert Herbert]] lost this distinction when [[Arthur Macalister]] was appointed, but when [[John Douglas (Queensland politician)|John Douglas]] died in 1904 Herbert regained it again until his own death in 1905 for a total period of 6 years and 340 days. [[Arthur Macalister]] lost this distinction when [[Sir Robert Mackenzie, 10th Baronet|Robert Mackenzie]] was appointed, but regained it again when Mackenzie died in 1875, Consequently, Macalister too was the oldest living premier twice: first from 1866 to 1867 (from first appointment), and a second time from Mackenzie's death in 1873 until his own death in 1883 for a total period of 10 years and 15 days.\n\n[[Vince Gair]] was the oldest to acquire this distinction at the age of 76 years, and 338 days. [[Gordon Chalk]], who was aged 77 years, and 345 days when he died, on 26 April 1991 was the oldest premier to die without ever acquiring this distinction. [[Wayne Goss]] who was aged 63 years and 257 days when he died on 10 November 2014 is the most recent premier to die without ever acquiring this distinction.\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2 | Premier\n! colspan=2 | Period when oldest living premier\n! colspan=2 | Age\n! rowspan=2 | Duration\n|-\n!

It was released as the [[lead single]] from their fourth [[studio album]] ''[[Tourism (Roxette album)|Tourism]]'' on 3 July 1992. The song was a commercial success upon release, topping the national [[Record chart|singles chart]]s in Norway and Spain. It also peaked at number two in several countries, including Austria, Belgium, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. It was held off the top spot in many of these territories by [[Dr. Alban]]'s \"[[It's My Life (Dr. Alban song)|It's My Life]]\". The single was backed by several remixes created by Swedish production duo BomKrash, which consisted of [[Jacob Hellner]] and Carl-Michael Herl\u00f6fsson.\n\n==Composition and style==\nAccording to [[Ultimate Guitar Archive|Ultimate Guitar]], \"How Do You Do!\" is an uptempo [[pop rock]] song written in [[Time signature|common time]] with a tempo of 121 [[beats per minute]]. It utilises a common trait found in Roxette compositions of the [[Verse (music)|verse]] using a different [[key signature]] than the [[Refrain|chorus]]. The verse is composed in [[C (musical note)|C]], and consists of three repetitions of a basic C\u2013F\u2013G\u2013F sequence, followed by one shortened sequence of C\u2013F\u2013G. The [[pre-chorus]] makes use of a [[power chord]] structure, and consists of a sequence of Am\u2013G\u2013F\u2013C\u2013Em, which is then amended to Am\u2013G\u2013F\u2013G. Following a brief pause, [[Marie Fredriksson]] takes over [[lead vocalist|lead vocals]] for the song's chorus, which moves up from the verses by two keys to [[E-flat major|E\u266d]]. The chorus is composed almost entirely of [[Sharp (music)|sharp notes]], and follows a sequence of D\u266f\u2013A\u266f\u2013D\u266f\u2013G\u266f\u2013A\u266f\u2013C[[Minor chord|m]]\u2013G\u266f\u2013A\u266f\u2013Cm\u2013G\u266f\u2013A\u266f. The [[Bridge (music)|bridge]] consists of four short repetitions of Cm\u2013A\u266f, played as power chords. The last chorus and outro are in F, following the transposed sequence F-C-F-B\u266d-C-Dm-B\u266d-C-Dm-B\u266d-C.

It was released as the [[lead single]] from their fourth [[studio album]] ''[[Tourism (Roxette album)|Tourism]]'' on 3 July 1992. The song was a commercial success upon release, topping the national [[Record chart|singles chart]]s in Norway and Spain. It also peaked at number two in several countries, including Austria, Belgium, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. It was held off the top spot in many of these territories by [[Dr. Alban]]'s \"[[It's My Life (Dr. Alban song)|It's My Life]]\". The single was backed by several remixes created by Swedish production duo BomKrash, which consisted of [[Jacob Hellner]] and Carl-Michael Herl\u00f6fsson.\n\n==Composition and style==\nAccording to [[Ultimate Guitar Archive|Ultimate Guitar]], \"How Do You Do!\" is an uptempo [[pop rock]] song written in [[Time signature|common time]] with a tempo of 121 [[beats per minute]]. It utilises a common trait found in Roxette compositions of the [[Verse (music)|verse]] using a different [[key signature]] than the [[Refrain|chorus]]. The verse is composed in [[C (musical note)|C]], and consists of three repetitions of a basic C\u2013F\u2013G\u2013F sequence, followed by one shortened sequence of C\u2013F\u2013G. The [[pre-chorus]] makes use of a [[power chord]] structure, and consists of a sequence of Am\u2013G\u2013F\u2013C\u2013Em, which is then amended to Am\u2013G\u2013F\u2013G. Following a brief pause, [[Marie Fredriksson]] takes over [[lead vocalist|lead vocals]] for the song's chorus, which moves up from the verses by two keys to [[E-flat major|E\u266d]]. The chorus is composed almost entirely of [[Sharp (music)|sharp notes]], and follows a sequence of D\u266f\u2013A\u266f\u2013D\u266f\u2013G\u266f\u2013A\u266f\u2013C[[Minor chord|m]]\u2013G\u266f\u2013A\u266f\u2013Cm\u2013G\u266f\u2013A\u266f. The [[Bridge (music)|bridge]] consists of four short repetitions of Cm\u2013A\u266f, played as power chords. The last chorus and outro are in F, following the transposed sequence F-C-F-B\u266d-C-Dm-B\u266d-C-Dm-B\u266d-C. American musician [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]] is referenced in the song's lyrics.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/r/roxette/how_do_you_do_ver2_crd.htm |title=How Do You Do!

{"title_page": "Kernelization", "text_new": "{{About|complexity theory|kernelized machine learning methods|Kernel method}} \n\nIn [[computer science]], a '''kernelization''' is a technique for designing efficient [[algorithm]]s that achieve their efficiency by a preprocessing stage in which inputs to the algorithm are replaced by a smaller input, called a \"kernel\". The result of solving the problem on the kernel should either be the same as on the original input, or it should be easy to transform the output on the kernel to the desired output for the original problem.\n\nKernelization is often achieved by applying a set of reduction rules that cut away parts of the instance that are easy to handle. In [[parameterized complexity|parameterized complexity theory]], it is often possible to prove that a kernel with guaranteed bounds on the size of a kernel (as a function of some parameter associated to the problem) can be found in [[polynomial time]]. When this is possible, it results in a [[fixed-parameter tractability|fixed-parameter tractable]] algorithm whose running time is the sum of the (polynomial time) kernelization step and the (non-polynomial but bounded by the parameter) time to solve the kernel. Indeed, every problem that can be solved by a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm can be solved by a kernelization algorithm of this type.\n\n==Example: vertex cover==\nA standard example for a kernelization algorithm is the kernelization of the [[vertex cover|vertex cover problem]] by S. Buss.<ref>This unpublished observation is acknowledged in a paper of {{harvtxt|Buss|Goldsmith|1993}}</ref>\nIn this problem, the input is an [[undirected graph]] <math>G</math> together with a number <math>k</math>. The output is a set of at most <math>k</math> vertices that includes an endpoint of every edge in the graph, if such a set exists, or a failure exception if no such set exists. This problem is [[NP-hard]]. However, the following reduction rules may be used to kernelize it:\n# If <math>k>0</math> and <math>v</math> is a vertex of degree greater than <math>k</math>, remove <math>v</math> from the graph and decrease <math>k</math> by one. Every vertex cover of size <math>k</math> must contain <math>v</math> since otherwise too many of its neighbors would have to be picked to cover the incident edges. Thus, an optimal vertex cover for the original graph may be formed from a cover of the reduced problem by adding <math>v</math> back to the cover.\n# If <math>v</math> is an isolated vertex, remove it. An isolated vertex cannot cover any edges, so in this case <math>v</math> cannot be part of any minimal cover.\n# If more than <math>k^2</math> edges remain in the graph, and neither of the previous two rules can be applied, then the graph cannot contain a vertex cover of size <math>k</math>. For, after eliminating all vertices of degree greater than <math>k</math>, each remaining vertex can only cover at most <math>k</math> edges and a set of <math>k</math> vertices could only cover at most <math>k^2</math> edges. In this case, the instance may be replaced by an instance with two vertices, one edge, and <math>k=0</math> , which also has no solution.\n\nAn algorithm that applies these rules repeatedly until no more reductions can be made necessarily terminates with a kernel that has at most <math>k^2</math> edges and (because each edge has at most two endpoints and there are no isolated vertices) at most <math>2k^2</math> vertices. This kernelization may be implemented in [[linear time]]. Once the kernel has been constructed, the vertex cover problem may be solved by a [[brute force search]] algorithm that tests whether each subset of the kernel is a cover of the kernel.\nThus, the vertex cover problem can be solved in time <math>O(2^{2k^2}+n+m)</math> for a graph with <math>n</math> vertices and <math>m</math> edges, allowing it to be solved efficiently when <math>k</math> is small even if <math>n</math> and <math>m</math> are both large.\n\nAlthough this bound is fixed-parameter tractable, its dependence on the parameter is higher than might be desired. More complex kernelization procedures can improve this bound, by finding smaller kernels, at the expense of greater running time in the kernelization step. In the vertex cover example, kernelization algorithms are known that produce kernels with at most <math>2k</math> vertices.\nOne algorithm that achieves this improved bound exploits the half-integrality of the [[Vertex_cover#ILP_formulation|linear program relaxation of vertex cover]] due to [[George Nemhauser|Nemhauser]] and Trotter.<ref>{{harvtxt |Flum|Grohe|2006}}</ref> Another kernelization algorithm achieving that bound is based on what is known as the crown reduction rule and uses [[Matching (graph theory)|alternating path]] arguments.<ref>{{harvtxt |Flum|Grohe|2006}} give a kernel based on the crown reduction that has <math>3k</math> vertices. The <math>2k</math> vertex bound is a bit more involved and folklore.</ref> The currently best known kernelization algorithm in terms of the number of vertices is due to {{harvtxt |Lampis|2011}} and achieves <math>2k-c\\log k</math> vertices for any fixed constant <math>c</math>.\n\nIt is not possible, in this problem, to find a kernel of size <math>O(\\log k)</math>, unless P = NP, for such a kernel would lead to a polynomial-time algorithm for the NP-hard vertex cover problem.

The result of solving the problem on the kernel should either be the same as on the original input, or it should be easy to transform the output on the kernel to the desired output for the original problem.\n\nKernelization is often achieved by applying a set of reduction rules that cut away parts of the instance that are easy to handle. In [[parameterized complexity|parameterized complexity theory]], it is often possible to prove that a kernel with guaranteed bounds on the size of a kernel (as a function of some parameter associated to the problem) can be found in [[polynomial time]]. When this is possible, it results in a [[fixed-parameter tractability|fixed-parameter tractable]] algorithm whose running time is the sum of the (polynomial time) kernelization step and the (non-polynomial but bounded by the parameter) time to solve the kernel. Indeed, every problem that can be solved by a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm can be solved by a kernelization algorithm of this type.\n\n==Example: vertex cover==\nA standard example for a kernelization algorithm is the kernelization of the [[vertex cover|vertex cover problem]] by S. Buss.<ref>This unpublished observation is acknowledged in a paper of {{harvtxt|Buss|Goldsmith|1993}}</ref>\nIn this problem, the input is an [[undirected graph]] <math>G</math> together with a number <math>k</math>. The output is a set of at most <math>k</math> vertices that includes an endpoint of every edge in the graph, if such a set exists, or a failure exception if no such set exists. This problem is [[NP-hard]]. However, the following reduction rules may be used to kernelize it:\n# If <math>k>0</math> and <math>v</math> is a vertex of degree greater than <math>k</math>, remove <math>v</math> from the graph and decrease <math>k</math> by one. Every vertex cover of size <math>k</math> must contain <math>v</math> since otherwise too many of its neighbors would have to be picked to cover the incident edges. Thus, an optimal vertex cover for the original graph may be formed from a cover of the reduced problem by adding <math>v</math> back to the cover.\n# If <math>v</math> is an isolated vertex, remove it. An isolated vertex cannot cover any edges, so in this case <math>v</math> cannot be part of any minimal cover.\n# If more than <math>k^2</math> edges remain in the graph, and neither of the previous two rules can be applied, then the graph cannot contain a vertex cover of size <math>k</math>. For, after eliminating all vertices of degree greater than <math>k</math>, each remaining vertex can only cover at most <math>k</math> edges and a set of <math>k</math> vertices could only cover at most <math>k^2</math> edges. In this case, the instance may be replaced by an instance with two vertices, one edge, and <math>k=0</math> , which also has no solution.\n\nAn algorithm that applies these rules repeatedly until no more reductions can be made necessarily terminates with a kernel that has at most <math>k^2</math> edges and (because each edge has at most two endpoints and there are no isolated vertices) at most <math>2k^2</math> vertices. This kernelization may be implemented in [[linear time]]. Once the kernel has been constructed, the vertex cover problem may be solved by a [[brute force search]] algorithm that tests whether each subset of the kernel is a cover of the kernel.\nThus, the vertex cover problem can be solved in time <math>O(2^{2k^2}+n+m)</math> for a graph with <math>n</math> vertices and <math>m</math> edges, allowing it to be solved efficiently when <math>k</math> is small even if <math>n</math> and <math>m</math> are both large.\n\nAlthough this bound is fixed-parameter tractable, its dependence on the parameter is higher than might be desired. More complex kernelization procedures can improve this bound, by finding smaller kernels, at the expense of greater running time in the kernelization step. In the vertex cover example, kernelization algorithms are known that produce kernels with at most <math>2k</math> vertices.\nOne algorithm that achieves this improved bound exploits the half-integrality of the [[Vertex_cover#ILP_formulation|linear program relaxation of vertex cover]] due to [[George Nemhauser|Nemhauser]] and Trotter.<ref>{{harvtxt |Flum|Grohe|2006}}</ref> Another kernelization algorithm achieving that bound is based on what is known as the crown reduction rule and uses [[Matching (graph theory)|alternating path]] arguments.<ref>{{harvtxt |Flum|Grohe|2006}} give a kernel based on the crown reduction that has <math>3k</math> vertices. The <math>2k</math> vertex bound is a bit more involved and folklore.</ref> The currently best known kernelization algorithm in terms of the number of vertices is due to {{harvtxt |Lampis|2011}} and achieves <math>2k-c\\log k</math> vertices for any fixed constant <math>c</math>.\n\nIt is not possible, in this problem, to find a kernel of size <math>O(\\log k)</math>, unless P = NP, for such a kernel would lead to a polynomial-time algorithm for the NP-hard vertex cover problem. However, much stronger bounds on the kernel size can be proven in this case: unless [[coNP]] <math>\\subseteq</math> [[NP/poly]] (believed unlikely by [[computational complexity theory|complexity theorists]]), for every <math>\\epsilon>0</math> it is impossible in polynomial time to find kernels with <math>O(k^{2-\\epsilon})</math> edges.<ref name=\"dvm10\">{{harvtxt|Dell|van Melkebeek|2010}}</ref>\nIt is unknown for vertex cover whether kernels with <math>(2-\\epsilon)k</math> vertices for some <math>\\epsilon>0</math> would have any unlikely complexity-theoretic consequences.\n\n==Definition==\nIn the literature, there is no clear consensus on how kernelization should be formally defined and there are subtle differences in the uses of that expression.\n\n=== Downey-Fellows Notation ===\nIn the Notation of {{harvtxt |Downey|Fellows|1999}}, a ''parameterized problem'' is a subset <math>L\\subseteq\\Sigma^*\\times\\N</math> describing a [[decision problem]].\n\nA '''kernelization''' for a parameterized problem <math>L</math> is an algorithm that takes an instance <math>(x,k)</math> and maps it in time polynomial in <math>|x|</math> and <math>k</math> to an instance <math>(x',k')</math> such that\n* <math>(x,k)</math> is in <math>L</math> if and only if <math>(x',k')</math> is in <math>L</math>,\n* the size of <math>x'</math> is bounded by a computable function <math>f</math> in <math>k</math>, and\n* <math>k'</math> is bounded by a function in <math>k</math>.\nThe output <math>(x',k')</math> of kernelization is called a kernel.

This approach is fruitful for instances whose solution size is large, but for which some other complexity measure is bounded. For example, the ''feedback vertex number'' of an undirected graph <math>G</math> is defined as the minimum cardinality of a set of vertices whose removal makes <math>G</math> acyclic. The [[vertex cover]] problem parameterized by the feedback vertex number of the input graph has a polynomial kernelization<ref name=\"JansenB13\">{{harvtxt|Jansen|Bodlaender|2013}}</ref>: There is a polynomial-time algorithm that, given a graph <math>G</math> whose feedback vertex number is <math>k</math>, outputs a graph <math>G'</math> on <math>O(k^3)</math> vertices such that a minimum vertex cover in <math>G'</math> can be transformed into a minimum vertex cover for <math>G</math> in polynomial time. The kernelization algorithm therefore guarantees that instances with a small feedback vertex number <math>k</math> are reduced to small instances.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Iterative compression]], a different design technique for fixed-parameter tractable algorithms\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|colwidth=35em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{citation\n| last1 = Abu-Khzam | first1 = Faisal N.\n| last2 = Collins | first2 = Rebecca L.\n| last3 = Fellows | first3 = Michael R. | author3-link = Michael Fellows\n| last4 = Langston | first4 = Michael A. | author4-link = Michael Langston\n| last5 = Suters | first5 = W.

However, a continuity between all these ideas derived from the basic sources from the [[Quran]] and [[Hadith|Islamic narratives]]. One canonical idea is, that the [[Azrael#In Islam|angel of death]] ([[Arabic]]: ''Malak al-Maut'') appears to the dying to take out their souls. The sinners' souls are extracted in the most painful way while the righteous are treated easily. This source doesn't help with secondary school homework but it is very informative.\n\nAnother common idea, although appearing relatively late in Islamic traditions,<ref>Stephen Burge Angels in Islam: Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti's al-Haba'ik fi akhbar al-mala'ik Routledge 2015 {{ISBN|978-1-136-50473-0}} p. 89</ref> adds that, after the burial, two angels \u2013 [[Munkar and Nakir]] \u2013 come to question the dead in order to test their faith.

In Islamic belief, death is predetermined by God, and the exact time of a person's death is known only to God.\nMuslims expect that their last word in this world would be their [[Shahadah|profession of faith]] (which reads \"I testify that there is no god but [[Allah]], and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah\"). That's why, those near a dying person encourage him to pronounce these words.<ref>{{cite book |last=Buturovic |first=Amila  |title=Carved in Stone, Etched in Memory: Death, Tombstones and Commemoration in Bosnian Islam Since C.1500 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ABOrCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA35 |page=35}}</ref> Sometimes, it is whispered into the ear of the dying.

In ancient times, those of the Islamic community firmly believed that life was the ultimate test for eternal life with Allah. Now, this is illuminated through modern Islamic times.\n\n== Hardship ==\nDeath often appears as a painful experience in Islamic tradition. After the soul has departed from the body, seeing one's relatives weeping and watching one's burial as a disembodied spirit is thought of as rather agonizing than pleasing.<ref>Jane I.

Death is inevitable. No matter how much people try to escape death, it will reach everyone ({{cite quran|50|19|s=ns|b=n}}). Again, those who deny resurrection and [[Akhirah|afterlife]], and thus challenge God, the Quran challenges them by saying that why these people then do not put back the soul which has reached the throat (of the dying person) and is about to escape the body?

Now, this is illuminated through modern Islamic times.\n\n== Hardship ==\nDeath often appears as a painful experience in Islamic tradition. After the soul has departed from the body, seeing one's relatives weeping and watching one's burial as a disembodied spirit is thought of as rather agonizing than pleasing.<ref>Jane I.
