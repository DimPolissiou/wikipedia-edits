Technology can support and improve the learning environment. As technology is becoming more predominant in the world today, teachers believe that developing these technological skills among students can be very beneficial for entering the workforce.<ref name=\"use\"/> The technology creation of online textbooks has made tablets and laptops widely popular in the classroom. With this ability, students are able to have readily available access to this resource anywhere at any time. Laptops can be used to quickly access information in the classroom and gather knowledge. They can be used for interactive activities involving polls, note taking, recording data, and research. \n\nSocial media has a strong impact on students. The studies focused on the impact of social media and reflected that 38% of students focus on the positive role of social media for their studies while 16% of students agreed on this strongly, but only 40% disagreed. 4.7% of students strongly disagreed that social media helps them in the study. It is also clear that social media impacts both genders and according to the results, it can be seen that 53% of female students are getting the negative impact of social media on their studies while 46% disagreed this point. In the male students, 40% agrees that social media has a negative impact on studies while 59% disagreed this notion.<ref name=\":04\"/> \n\nThe impact of using technology within classrooms can have a negative effect as well.

[[Quizlet]] is a new tool that helps students study in a new way<!-- Be more specific. What is a \"new way?\" This shouldn't sound like an advertisement, but it should be more detailed.  -->. Quizlet allows users to create flashcard sets that are always available to study. It also takes these card sets and automatically generates practice tests and other activities to help students study, which they can share with other users. There is opposition to learning websites such as Quizlet because some people believe they make it easier for students to cheat, claiming that students can use their phone during the test to look up answers and can pass off other students work as their own.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kolodny |first1=Lora |title=Popular study app Quizlet faces a moment of truth as a new school year begins |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/23/quizlet-a-popular-study-app-faces-a-moment-of-truth.html |website=www.cnbc.com |accessdate=11 November 2018}}</ref>  \n\n== Methods institutions use to communicate ==\nCollege institutions are adapting many social media platforms into their educational systems to improve communication with students and the overall quality of student life.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.lcibs.co.uk/the-role-of-social-media-in-education/|title=The Role of Social Media in Education|date=2017-07-20|work=LCIBS|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en-US}}</ref> It provides colleges with an easy fast method of communication and allows them to give and receive feedback to students.

It discussed that social media helps faculty to provide good examples and understanding regarding visuals. It has a positive role in providing news update to students and informs them about course activities.

This study did not provide a negative impact on students. Other studies by Maqableh, Quteshat, Masadeh and Huda Karajeh in 2015 did not provide any negative impact of social media on students but focused on the ignorance of academics due to spending a lot of time on social media.

Technology can support and improve the learning environment. As technology is becoming more predominant in the world today, teachers believe that developing these technological skills among students can be very beneficial for entering the workforce.<ref name=\"use\"/> The technology creation of online textbooks has made tablets and laptops widely popular in the classroom. With this ability, students are able to have readily available access to this resource anywhere at any time. Laptops can be used to quickly access information in the classroom and gather knowledge. They can be used for interactive activities involving polls, note taking, recording data, and research. \n\nSocial media has a strong impact on students. The studies focused on the impact of social media and reflected that 38% of students focus on the positive role of social media for their studies while 16% of students agreed on this strongly, but only 40% disagreed. 4.7% of students strongly disagreed that social media helps them in the study. It is also clear that social media impacts both genders and according to the results, it can be seen that 53% of female students are getting the negative impact of social media on their studies while 46% disagreed this point. In the male students, 40% agrees that social media has a negative impact on studies while 59% disagreed this notion.<ref name=\":04\"/> \n\nThe impact of using technology within classrooms can have a negative effect as well.

The internet gives students access to more resources than ever before, in terms of both research and learning tools. Students are taught to be more critical in life overall when they have to decide which sources are credible or not when doing internet research.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Internet as a Learning Tool |url=http://www.csun.edu/~ac64224/paper2.html |website=www.csun.edu |accessdate=11 November 2018}}</ref> Students can also engage in [[active learning]] by using devices to participate in their field and [[Service-learning|service learning]] by working with organizations outside of the classroom to solve problems and create new projects.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kembel |first1=George |title=The Classroom in 2020 |url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/04/08/stanford-design-2020-technology-data-companies-10-education.html#26401e1e4ee4 |website=www.forbes.com |accessdate=11 November 2018}}</ref> \n\nStudents can also use their devices to access [[learning management systems]] like [[Blackboard Inc.|Blackboard]] and Canvas. Students are able to complete their work anywhere as long as they have internet service, which grants them more freedom outside the classroom. \n\nOther apps have been developed that combine learning tasks with elements of social media. [[Quizlet]] is a new tool that helps students study in a new way<!-- Be more specific. What is a \"new way?\" This shouldn't sound like an advertisement, but it should be more detailed.  -->. Quizlet allows users to create flashcard sets that are always available to study. It also takes these card sets and automatically generates practice tests and other activities to help students study, which they can share with other users. There is opposition to learning websites such as Quizlet because some people believe they make it easier for students to cheat, claiming that students can use their phone during the test to look up answers and can pass off other students work as their own.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kolodny |first1=Lora |title=Popular study app Quizlet faces a moment of truth as a new school year begins |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/23/quizlet-a-popular-study-app-faces-a-moment-of-truth.html |website=www.cnbc.com |accessdate=11 November 2018}}</ref>  \n\n== Methods institutions use to communicate ==\nCollege institutions are adapting many social media platforms into their educational systems to improve communication with students and the overall quality of student life.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.lcibs.co.uk/the-role-of-social-media-in-education/|title=The Role of Social Media in Education|date=2017-07-20|work=LCIBS|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en-US}}</ref> It provides colleges with an easy fast method of communication and allows them to give and receive feedback to students.

In many classrooms across America, teachers have created social media pages for their classes on which they can post assignments as well as interact with their students. Schools have felt the need to make regulations for how students and faculty interact online. Many teachers stay away from \"friending\" of \"following\" their students online because it can become too personal.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2018/01/26/579955559/teach-students-to-use-social-media-the-right-way-and-the-possibilities-are-endle|title=Teach Students To Use Social Media (The Right Way) And The Possibilities Are Endless|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Social media ==\n\n<!-- Needs expansion at some point-- the article is about social media in education, and thus far there is no history of social media in education (only internet use in general) -->[[Use of social media in education]] has helped some educators mentor their students more effectively.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=S.

Pottery created using a wheel acquires full rotational symmetry in its cross-section, while allowing substantial freedom of shape in the vertical direction. Upon this inherently symmetrical starting point, potters from ancient times onwards have added patterns that modify the rotational symmetry to achieve visual objectives.\n\nCast metal vessels lacked the inherent rotational symmetry of wheel-made pottery, but otherwise provided a similar opportunity to decorate their surfaces with patterns pleasing to those who used them. The ancient [[Chinese people|Chinese]], for example, used symmetrical patterns in their bronze castings as early as the 17th century BC. Bronze vessels exhibited both a bilateral main motif and a repetitive translated border design.<ref>[http://www.chinavoc.com/arts/handicraft/bronze.htm The Art of Chinese Bronzes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031211185121/http://chinavoc.com/arts/handicraft/bronze.htm |date=2003-12-11 }}.

In classical music, Bach used the symmetry concepts of permutation and invariance.<ref>see (\"Fugue No. 21,\" [http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~tas3/wtc/ii21s.pdf pdf] or [http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~tas3/wtc/ii21.html Shockwave])</ref>\n\n====Pitch structures====\nSymmetry is also an important consideration in the formation of [[scale (music)|scale]]s and [[chord (music)|chords]], traditional or [[tonality|tonal]] music being made up of non-symmetrical groups of [[pitch (music)|pitches]], such as the [[diatonic scale]] or the [[major chord]].

As pioneers in [[Recording practices of the Beatles|recording]], songwriting and artistic presentation, the group revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the [[Baby boomers|era's youth]] and sociocultural movements.{{sfn|Frontani|2007|p=157}}\n\nLed by primary songwriters [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]], the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and [[Hamburg]] over three years from 1960, initially with [[Stuart Sutcliffe]] playing [[Bass guitar|bass]]. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including [[Pete Best]], before asking Starr to join them in 1962. Manager [[Brian Epstein]] moulded them into a professional act and producer [[George Martin]] guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after their first hit, \"[[Love Me Do]]\", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed \"[[Beatlemania]]\", the band acquired the nickname \"the Fab Four\", with Epstein, Martin and other members of the band's entourage sometimes given the informal title of \"[[fifth Beatle]]\".\n\nBy early 1964, the Beatles were international stars, leading the \"[[British Invasion]]\" of the United States pop market and breaking numerous sales records. They soon made their film debut with ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' (1964). From 1965 onwards, they produced increasingly innovative recordings, including the albums ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' (1965), ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' (1966) and ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' (1967), and enjoyed further commercial success with ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' (also known as \"the White Album\", 1968) and ''[[Abbey Road]]'' (1969). In 1968, they founded [[Apple Corps]], a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee projects related to the band's legacy. After [[Break-up of the Beatles|the group's break-up]] in 1970, all four members enjoyed success as solo artists. Lennon was [[Murder of John Lennon|shot and killed]] in December 1980, and Harrison died of lung cancer in November 2001.

Their initial impact would have been enough to establish the Beatles as one of their era's most influential cultural forces, but they didn't stop there. Although their initial style was a highly original, irresistibly catchy synthesis of early American rock and roll and R&B, the Beatles spent the rest of the 1960s expanding rock's stylistic frontiers, consistently staking out new musical territory on each release. The band's increasingly sophisticated experimentation encompassed a variety of genres, including [[folk-rock]], [[country music|country]], [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]], and [[baroque pop]], without sacrificing the effortless mass appeal of their early work.{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=160}}}}\n\nIn ''The Beatles as Musicians'', [[Walter Everett (musicologist)|Walter Everett]] describes Lennon and McCartney's contrasting motivations and approaches to composition: \"McCartney may be said to have constantly developed \u2013 as a means to entertain \u2013 a focused musical talent with an ear for counterpoint and other aspects of craft in the demonstration of a universally agreed-upon common language that he did much to enrich. Conversely, Lennon's mature music is best appreciated as the daring product of a largely unconscious, searching but undisciplined artistic sensibility.\"{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=9}}\n\nIan MacDonald describes McCartney as \"a natural melodist \u2013 a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony\". His melody lines are characterised as primarily \"vertical\", employing wide, [[Consonance and dissonance|consonant]] intervals which express his \"extrovert energy and optimism\". Conversely, Lennon's \"sedentary, ironic personality\" is reflected in a \"horizontal\" approach featuring minimal, dissonant intervals and repetitive melodies which rely on their harmonic accompaniment for interest: \"Basically a realist, he instinctively kept his melodies close to the rhythms and cadences of speech, colouring his lyrics with bluesy tone and harmony rather than creating tunes that made striking shapes of their own.\"{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=12}} MacDonald praises Harrison's lead guitar work for the role his \"characterful lines and textural colourings\" play in supporting Lennon and McCartney's parts, and describes Starr as \"the father of modern pop/rock drumming\".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=382\u2013383}}\n\n=== Influences ===\nThe band's earliest influences include [[Elvis Presley]], [[Carl Perkins]], [[Little Richard]] and [[Chuck Berry]].{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=140, 660, 856\u2013858, 881}} During the Beatles' co-residency with Little Richard at the [[Star-Club]] in Hamburg, from April to May 1962, he advised them on the proper technique for performing his songs.{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=660}} Of Presley, Lennon said, \"Nothing really affected me until I heard Elvis. If there hadn't been Elvis, there would not have been the Beatles.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=881}} Other early influences include [[Buddy Holly]], [[Eddie Cochran]], [[Roy Orbison]]{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=289, 526, 830}} and [[the Everly Brothers]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=111, 123, 131, 133}}\n\nThe Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[the Who]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[the Lovin' Spoonful]], [[the Byrds]] and [[the Beach Boys]], whose 1966 album ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' amazed and inspired McCartney.{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=99, 217, 357, 1195}}{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=333\u2013335, 359}}{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|pp=147, 150, 162, 169}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Miles |first=Barry |date=November 1966 |title=A Conversation with Paul McCartney |newspaper=International Times |location=London}}</ref> Referring to the Beach Boys' creative leader, Martin later stated: \"No one made a greater impact on the Beatles than Brian [Wilson].\"{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=17}} Ravi Shankar, with whom Harrison studied for six weeks in India in late 1966, had a significant effect on his musical development during the band's later years.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|pp=147, 165, 177}}\n\n=== Genres ===\nOriginating as a skiffle group, the Beatles quickly embraced 1950s rock and roll and helped pioneer the Merseybeat genre,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/style/merseybeat-ma0000012018/songs|title=Merseybeat \u2013 Significant Albums, Artists and Songs|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=27 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016041739/http://www.allmusic.com/style/merseybeat-ma0000012018/songs|archive-date=16 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> and their repertoire ultimately expanded to include a broad variety of pop music.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=30\u201332, 100\u2013107}} Reflecting the range of styles they explored, Lennon said of ''Beatles for Sale'', \"You could call our new one a Beatles country-and-western LP\",{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=255}} while Gould credits ''Rubber Soul'' as \"the instrument by which legions of folk-music enthusiasts were coaxed into the camp of pop\".{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=296}}\n\n[[File:Guitarras de McCartney y Harrison.jpg|upright=.75|thumb|A [[H\u00f6fner 500/1|H\u00f6fner \"violin\" bass guitar]] and [[Gretsch|Gretsch Country Gentleman guitar]], models played by McCartney and Harrison, respectively; the [[Vox AC30]] amplifier behind them is the model the Beatles used during performances in the early 1960s.|alt=Two electric guitars, a light brown violin-shaped bass and a darker brown guitar resting against a Vox amplifier]]\n\nAlthough the 1965 song \"Yesterday\" was not the first pop record to employ orchestral strings, it marked the group's first recorded use of classical music elements. Gould observes: \"The more traditional sound of strings allowed for a fresh appreciation of their talent as composers by listeners who were otherwise allergic to the din of drums and electric guitars.\"{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=278}} They continued to experiment with string arrangements to various effect; ''Sgt. Pepper''{{'}}s \"[[She's Leaving Home]]\", for instance, is \"cast in the {{lang|en-US|mold}} of a sentimental Victorian ballad\", Gould writes, \"its words and music filled with the clich\u00e9s of musical melodrama\".{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=402}}\n\nThe band's stylistic range expanded in another direction with their 1966 B-side \"Rain\", described by [[Martin C. Strong|Martin Strong]] as \"the first overtly psychedelic Beatles record\".{{sfn|Strong|2004|p=108}} Other psychedelic numbers followed, such as \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" (recorded before \"Rain\"), \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", \"[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]\" and \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\". The influence of [[Indian classical music]] was evident in Harrison's \"[[The Inner Light (song)|The Inner Light]]\", \"[[Love You To]]\" and \"[[Within You Without You]]\" \u2013 Gould describes the latter two as attempts \"to replicate the [[raga]] form in miniature\".{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=406, 462\u2013463}}\n\nInnovation was the most striking feature of their creative evolution, according to music historian and pianist Michael Campbell: \"'A Day in the Life' encapsulates the art and achievement of the Beatles as well as any single track can. It highlights key features of their music: the sound imagination, the persistence of tuneful melody, and the close coordination between words and music. It represents a new category of song \u2013 more sophisticated than pop&nbsp;... and uniquely innovative. There literally had never before been a song \u2013 classical or vernacular \u2013 that had blended so many disparate elements so imaginatively.\"{{sfn|Campbell|2008|p=196}} Philosophy professor Bruce Ellis Benson agrees: \"the Beatles&nbsp;... give us a wonderful example of how such far-ranging influences as Celtic music, rhythm and blues, and country and western could be put together in a new way.\"{{sfn|Benson|2003|p=43}}\n\nAuthor Dominic Pedler describes the way they crossed musical styles: \"Far from moving sequentially from one genre to another (as is sometimes conveniently suggested) the group maintained ''in parallel'' their mastery of the traditional, catchy chart hit while simultaneously forging rock and dabbling with a wide range of peripheral influences from country to vaudeville. One of these threads was their take on folk music, which would form such essential groundwork for their later collisions with Indian music and philosophy.\"{{sfn|Pedler|2003|p=256}} As the personal relationships between the band members grew increasingly strained, their individual tastes became more apparent. The minimalistic cover artwork for the White Album contrasted with the complexity and diversity of its music, which encompassed Lennon's \"[[Revolution 9]]\" (whose [[musique concr\u00e8te]] approach was influenced by Yoko Ono), Starr's [[country music|country]] song \"[[Don't Pass Me By]]\", Harrison's [[rock ballad]] \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\", and the \"[[Heavy metal music#Origins: late 1960s and early 1970s|proto-metal]] roar\" of McCartney's \"[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]\".<ref name=\"White Album AllMusic\">{{cite web |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |title=''The Beatles [White Album]'' \u2013 The Beatles |publisher=AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-beatles-white-album-mw0000418113 |accessdate=21 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530202730/https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-beatles-white-album-mw0000418113 |archive-date=30 May 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Contribution of George Martin ===\n[[File:Beatles and George Martin in studio 1966.JPG|right|thumb|alt=The Beatles with George Martin in the studio in the mid-1960s|Martin (second from right) in the studio with the Beatles in the mid-1960s]]\n[[George Martin]]'s close involvement in his role as producer made him one of the leading candidates for the informal title of the \"[[fifth Beatle]]\".{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=721}} He applied his classical musical training in various ways, and functioned as \"an informal music teacher\" to the progressing songwriters, according to Gould.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=121, 290}} Martin suggested to a sceptical McCartney that the arrangement of \"Yesterday\" should feature a string quartet accompaniment, thereby introducing the Beatles to a \"hitherto unsuspected world of classical instrumental colour\", in MacDonald's description.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=158}} Their creative development was also facilitated by Martin's willingness to experiment in response to their suggestions, such as adding \"something [[baroque music|baroque]]\" to a particular recording.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=290}} In addition to scoring orchestral arrangements for recordings, Martin often performed on them, playing instruments including piano, organ and [[Brass instrument|brass]].{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=382, 405, 409, 443, 584}}\n\nCollaborating with Lennon and McCartney required Martin to adapt to their different approaches to songwriting and recording. MacDonald comments, \"while [he] worked more naturally with the conventionally articulate McCartney, the challenge of catering to Lennon's intuitive approach generally spurred him to his more original arrangements, of which '[[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!]]' is an outstanding example.\"{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=238}} Martin said of the two composers' distinct songwriting styles and his stabilising influence:\n\n{{blockquote|Compared with Paul's songs, all of which seemed to keep in some sort of touch with reality, John's had a psychedelic, almost mystical quality&nbsp;... John's imagery is one of the best things about his work&nbsp;\u2013 'tangerine trees', 'marmalade skies', 'cellophane flowers' ...&nbsp;I always saw him as an aural [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], rather than some drug-ridden record artist. On the other hand, I would be stupid to pretend that drugs didn't figure quite heavily in the Beatles' lives at that time&nbsp;... they knew that I, in my schoolmasterly role, didn't approve&nbsp;... Not only was I not into it myself, I couldn't see the need for it; and there's no doubt that, if I too had been on dope, ''Pepper'' would never have been the album it was. Perhaps it was the combination of dope and no dope that worked, who knows?{{sfn|Martin|1979|pp=205\u2013206}}}}\n\nHarrison echoed Martin's description of his stabilising role: \"I think we just grew through those years together, him as the straight man and us as the loonies; but he was always there for us to interpret our madness \u2013 we used to be slightly avant-garde on certain days of the week, and he would be there as the anchor person, to communicate that through the engineers and on to the tape.\"{{sfn|Harry|2003|p=264}}\n\n=== In the studio ===\n{{see also|Recording practices of the Beatles}}\n\nMaking innovative use of technology while expanding the possibilities of recorded music, the Beatles urged experimentation by Martin and his recording engineers. Seeking ways to put chance occurrences to creative use, accidental guitar feedback, a resonating glass bottle, a tape loaded the wrong way round so that it played backwards \u2013 any of these might be incorporated into their music.{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1995|p=103}} Their desire to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers Norman Smith, [[Ken Townsend]] and Geoff Emerick, all contributed significantly to their records from ''Rubber Soul'' and, especially, ''Revolver'' onwards.{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1995|p=103}}\n\nAlong with innovative studio techniques such as [[audio signal processing|sound effects]], unconventional microphone placements, tape loops, [[double tracking]] and [[vari-speed]] recording, the Beatles augmented their songs with instruments that were unconventional in rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the sitar in \"Norwegian Wood\" and the [[swarmandal]] in \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=212}} They also used novel electronic instruments such as the Mellotron, with which McCartney supplied the flute voices on the \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" intro,{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=219}} and the [[clavioline]], an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on \"[[Baby, You're a Rich Man]]\".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=259}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{Main|Cultural impact of the Beatles}}\n\n[[File:The Beatles on Green Hill in Almaty, Kazakhstan.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|alt=A monument of the English rock band the Beatles in Almaty, Kazakhstan|''The Beatles Monument'' in [[Almaty]], [[Kazakhstan]]]]\n\nFormer ''Rolling Stone'' associate editor [[Robert Greenfield]] compared the Beatles to [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], as \"artists who broke through the constraints of their time period to come up with something that was unique and original&nbsp;...

The company was organised with James and his partner, Emmanuel Silver, owning a controlling interest, variously described as 51% or 50% plus one share. McCartney had 20%. Reports again vary concerning Lennon's portion \u2013 19 or 20% \u2013 and Brian Epstein's \u2013 9 or 10% \u2013 which he received in lieu of a 25% band management fee.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=15\u201317}}{{sfn|Norman|1996|pp=169\u201371, 368\u2013369}}{{sfn|Brown|Gaines|2002|p=178}} In 1965, the company went public. Five million shares were created, of which the original principals retained 3.75&nbsp;million. James and Silver each received 937,500 shares (18.75% of 5&nbsp;million); Lennon and McCartney each received 750,000 shares (15%); and Epstein's management company, NEMS Enterprises, received 375,000 shares (7.5%). Of the 1.25&nbsp;million shares put up for sale, Harrison and Starr each acquired 40,000.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=37\u201338}} At the time of the stock offering, Lennon and McCartney renewed their three-year publishing contracts, binding them to Northern Songs until 1973.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=42}}\n\nHarrison created [[Harrisongs]] to represent his Beatles compositions, but signed a three-year contract with Northern Songs that gave it the copyright to his work through March 1968, which included \"[[Taxman]]\" and \"[[Within You Without You]]\".{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=45}} The songs on which Starr received co-writing credit before 1968, such as \"[[What Goes On (The Beatles song)|What Goes On]]\" and \"[[Flying (The Beatles song)|Flying]]\", were also Northern Songs copyrights.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=46\u201347}} Harrison did not renew his contract with Northern Songs when it ended, signing instead with [[Apple Corps|Apple Publishing]] while retaining the copyright to his work from that point on. Harrison thus owns the rights to his later Beatles songs such as \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\" and \"Something\". That year, as well, Starr created [[Startling Music]], which holds the rights to his Beatles compositions, \"Don't Pass Me By\" and \"[[Octopus's Garden]]\".{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=60\u201361}}{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=351}}\n\nIn March 1969, James arranged to sell his and his partner's shares of Northern Songs to the British broadcasting company [[Associated Television]] (ATV), founded by impresario [[Lew Grade]], without first informing the Beatles. The band then made a bid to gain a controlling interest by attempting to work out a deal with a consortium of London brokerage firms that had accumulated a 14% holding.{{sfn|Norman|1996|pp=369\u2013372}} The deal collapsed over the objections of Lennon, who declared, \"I'm sick of being fucked about by men in suits sitting on their fat arses in [[City of London|the City]].\"{{sfn|Norman|1996|p=372}} By the end of May, ATV had acquired a majority stake in Northern Songs, controlling nearly the entire Lennon\u2013McCartney catalogue, as well as any future material until 1973.{{sfn|Miles|1998|p=296}} In frustration, Lennon and McCartney sold their shares to ATV in late October 1969.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=236}}\n\nIn 1981, financial losses by ATV's parent company, [[Associated Communications Corporation]] (ACC), led it to attempt to sell its music division. According to authors Brian Southall and Rupert Perry, Grade contacted McCartney, offering ATV Music and Northern Songs for $30&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=129}} According to an account McCartney gave in 1995, he met with Grade and explained he was interested solely in the Northern Songs catalogue if Grade were ever willing to \"separate off\" that portion of ATV Music. Soon afterwards, Grade offered to sell him Northern Songs for \u00a320&nbsp;million, giving the ex-Beatle \"a week or so\" to decide. By McCartney's account, he and Ono countered with a \u00a35&nbsp;million bid that was rejected.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=130}} According to reports at the time, Grade refused to separate Northern Songs and turned down an offer of \u00a321\u201325&nbsp;million from McCartney and Ono for Northern Songs. In 1982, ACC was acquired in a [[takeover]] by Australian business magnate [[Robert Holmes \u00e0 Court]] for \u00a360&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=130, 139}}\n\nIn 1985, [[Michael Jackson]] purchased ATV for a reported $47.5&nbsp;million. The acquisition gave him control over the publishing rights to more than 200 Beatles songs, as well as 40,000 other copyrights.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=140, 174, 176}} In 1995, in a deal that earned him a reported $110&nbsp;million, Jackson merged his music publishing business with [[Sony]], creating a new company, [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]], in which he held a 50% stake. The merger made the new company, then valued at over half a billion dollars, the third-largest music publisher in the world.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=198}} In 2016, Sony acquired Jackson's share of Sony/ATV from the Jackson estate for $750&nbsp;million.<ref>Christman, Ed. \"Sony Finalizes Acquisition of Michael Jackson Estate's Stake in Sony/ATV Publishing\" ''Billboard'' 30 September 2016</ref>\n\nDespite the lack of publishing rights to most of their songs, Lennon's estate and McCartney continue to receive their respective shares of the writers' royalties, which together are 33{{frac|3}}% of total commercial proceeds in the US and which vary elsewhere around the world between 50 and 55%.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=195}} Two of Lennon and McCartney's earliest songs \u2013 \"Love Me Do\" and \"P.S.

With a line-up comprising [[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]], they are regarded as the [[Cultural impact of the Beatles|most influential band of all time]].{{sfn|Hasted|2017|p=425}} The group were integral to the development of [[counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]] and [[popular music]]'s recognition as an art form.{{sfn|Frontani|2007|p=125}} Rooted in [[skiffle]], [[beat music|beat]] and 1950s [[rock and roll]], their sound incorporated elements of [[classical music]] and [[traditional pop]] in innovative ways; the band later explored music styles ranging from [[sentimental ballad|ballads]] and [[Music of India|Indian music]] to [[Psychedelic music|psychedelia]] and [[hard rock]]. As pioneers in [[Recording practices of the Beatles|recording]], songwriting and artistic presentation, the group revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the [[Baby boomers|era's youth]] and sociocultural movements.{{sfn|Frontani|2007|p=157}}\n\nLed by primary songwriters [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]], the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and [[Hamburg]] over three years from 1960, initially with [[Stuart Sutcliffe]] playing [[Bass guitar|bass]]. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including [[Pete Best]], before asking Starr to join them in 1962. Manager [[Brian Epstein]] moulded them into a professional act and producer [[George Martin]] guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after their first hit, \"[[Love Me Do]]\", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed \"[[Beatlemania]]\", the band acquired the nickname \"the Fab Four\", with Epstein, Martin and other members of the band's entourage sometimes given the informal title of \"[[fifth Beatle]]\".\n\nBy early 1964, the Beatles were international stars, leading the \"[[British Invasion]]\" of the United States pop market and breaking numerous sales records. They soon made their film debut with ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' (1964). From 1965 onwards, they produced increasingly innovative recordings, including the albums ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' (1965), ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' (1966) and ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' (1967), and enjoyed further commercial success with ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' (also known as \"the White Album\", 1968) and ''[[Abbey Road]]'' (1969). In 1968, they founded [[Apple Corps]], a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee projects related to the band's legacy. After [[Break-up of the Beatles|the group's break-up]] in 1970, all four members enjoyed success as solo artists. Lennon was [[Murder of John Lennon|shot and killed]] in December 1980, and Harrison died of lung cancer in November 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.\n\nThe Beatles are the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music act of all time]], with certified sales of over 183 million units in the US and estimated sales of 600 million units worldwide.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-19800654|title=From Fab Four to fabulously rich|last=Hotten|first=Russell|date=2012-10-04|access-date=2020-01-08|language=en-GB}}</ref> They hold the record for most number-one albums on the [[UK Albums Chart]], [[List of artists by number of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles|most number-one hits on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, and most singles sold in the UK. The group were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1988, and all four main members were inducted individually between 1994 and 2015. In 2008, the group topped ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''<nowiki/>'s list of the all-time most successful artists on the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The band have received seven [[Grammy Award]]s, four [[Brit Awards]], an [[Academy Award]] (for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score#1970s|Best Original Song Score]] for the 1970 film ''[[Let It Be (1970 film)|Let It Be]]'') and fifteen [[Ivor Novello Awards]].

They briefly called themselves the Blackjacks, before changing their name to [[the Quarrymen]] after discovering that another local group was already using the name.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=47\u201352}} Fifteen-year-old [[Paul McCartney]] joined them as a rhythm guitarist shortly after he and Lennon met that July.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=93\u201399}} In February 1958, McCartney invited his friend [[George Harrison]] to watch the band. The fifteen-year-old auditioned for Lennon, impressing him with his playing, but Lennon initially thought Harrison was too young for the band. After a month of Harrison's persistence, during a second meeting (arranged by McCartney), he performed the lead guitar part of the instrumental song \"[[Raunchy (instrumental)|Raunchy]]\" on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus,<ref>{{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=47}}; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|p=127}}.</ref> and they enlisted him as their [[lead guitar]]ist.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=47}}{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=13}}\n\nBy January 1959, Lennon's Quarry Bank friends had left the group, and he began his studies at the [[Liverpool College of Art]].{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=103}} The three guitarists, billing themselves as Johnny and the Moondogs,{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=17}} were playing [[rock and roll]] whenever they could find a drummer.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=742\u2013743}} Lennon's art school friend [[Stuart Sutcliffe]], who had just sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar with the proceeds, joined in January 1960, and it was he who suggested changing the band's name to ''Beatals'', as a tribute to [[Buddy Holly]] and [[the Crickets]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=18}}{{sfn|Gilliland| 1969|loc=show 27, track 4}} They used this name until May, when they became the Silver Beetles, before undertaking a brief [[The Beat Ballad Show Tour|tour of Scotland]] as the backing group for pop singer and fellow [[Liverpudlian]] [[Johnny Gentle]]. By early July, they had refashioned themselves as the Silver Beatles, and by the middle of August shortened the name to ''The Beatles''.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=18\u201322}}\n\n[[Allan Williams]], the Beatles' unofficial manager, arranged a residency for them [[The Beatles in Hamburg|in Hamburg]], but lacking a full-time drummer they auditioned and hired [[Pete Best]] in mid-August 1960. The band, now a five-piece, left four days later, contracted to club owner [[Bruno Koschmider]] for what would be a 3{{frac|2}}-month residency.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=21\u201325}} Beatles historian [[Mark Lewisohn]] writes: \"They pulled into Hamburg at dusk on 17 August, the time when the [[Reeperbahn|red-light area]] comes to life&nbsp;... flashing neon lights screamed out the various entertainment on offer, while scantily clad women sat unabashed in shop windows waiting for business opportunities.\"{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=22}}\n\n[[File:Reeperbahn.jpg|alt=The Reeperbahn nightclub as seen from the sidewalk with its entrance lighted.

After closing Indra due to noise complaints, he moved them to the [[Kaiserkeller]] in October.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=23}} When he learned they had been performing at the rival [[Top Ten Club]] in breach of their contract, he gave the band one month's termination notice,{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=24, 33}} and reported the underage Harrison, who had obtained permission to stay in Hamburg by lying to the German authorities about his age.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=88}} The authorities arranged for Harrison's deportation in late November.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=24}} One week later, Koschmider had McCartney and Best arrested for arson after they set fire to a condom in a concrete corridor; the authorities deported them.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=24\u201325}} Lennon returned to Liverpool in early December, while Sutcliffe remained in Hamburg until late February with his German fianc\u00e9e [[Astrid Kirchherr]],{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=25}} who took the first semi-professional photos of the Beatles.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=222\u2013224}}\n\nDuring the next two years, the Beatles were resident for periods in Hamburg, where they used [[Phenmetrazine|Preludin]] both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=66\u201367}} In 1961, during their second Hamburg engagement, Kirchherr cut Sutcliffe's hair in the \"[[exi (subculture)|exi]]\" (existentialist) style, later adopted by the other Beatles.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=32}}{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=76}} When Sutcliffe decided to leave the band early that year and resume his art studies in Germany, McCartney took up the bass.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=89, 94}} Producer [[Bert Kaempfert]] contracted what was now a four-piece group until June 1962, and he used them as [[Tony Sheridan]]'s [[backup band|backing band]] on a series of recordings for [[Polydor Records]].{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 27, track 4}}{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=249\u2013251}} As part of the sessions, the Beatles were signed to Polydor for one year.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=450}} Credited to \"Tony Sheridan & the Beat Brothers\", the single \"[[My Bonnie]]\", recorded in June 1961 and released four months later, reached number 32 on the ''[[Musikmarkt]]'' chart.{{sfn|Everett|2001|p=100}}\n\nAfter the Beatles completed their second Hamburg residency, they enjoyed increasing popularity in Liverpool with the growing [[beat music|Merseybeat]] movement. However, they were also growing tired of the monotony of numerous appearances at the same clubs night after night.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=33}} In November 1961, during one of the group's frequent performances at [[The Cavern Club]], they encountered [[Brian Epstein]], a local record-store owner and music columnist.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=84\u201387}} He later recalled: \"I immediately liked what I heard. They were fresh, and they were honest, and they had what I thought was a sort of presence&nbsp;... [a] star quality.\"{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=34\u201335}}\n\nEpstein courted the band over the next couple of months, and they appointed him as their manager in January 1962.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=84\u201388}} Throughout early and mid-1962, Epstein sought to free the Beatles from their contractual obligations to Bert Kaempfert Productions. He eventually negotiated a one-month-early release from their contract in exchange for one last recording session in Hamburg.{{sfn|Winn|2008|p=10}} Tragedy greeted them on their return to Germany in April, when a distraught Kirchherr met them at the airport with news of Sutcliffe's death the previous day from what was later determined as a [[cerebral hemorrhage|brain haemorrhage]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=56}}\n\nEpstein began negotiations with record labels for a recording contract. To secure a UK record contract, Epstein negotiated an early end to the band's contract with Polydor, in exchange for more recordings backing Tony Sheridan.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=612, 629}} After a New Year's Day audition, [[The Beatles' Decca audition|Decca Records rejected the band]] with the comment \"Guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein.\"{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=67}} However, three months later, producer [[George Martin]] signed the Beatles to [[EMI]]'s [[Parlophone]] label.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=56}}\n\n[[File:Abbey Rd Studios.jpg|thumb|right|Main entrance at Abbey Road Studios|alt=A flight of stone steps leads from an asphalt car park up to the main entrance of a white two-story building.

I Love You (The Beatles song)|P.S.

On 27 August, their manager's assistant, Peter Brown, phoned to inform them that Epstein had died.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=709, 713\u2013719}} The coroner ruled the death an accidental [[Bromoureide|carbitol]] overdose, although it was widely rumoured to be a suicide.{{sfn|Brown|Gaines|2002|p=249}}{{refn|group=nb|Epstein had been in a fragile emotional state, stressed by personal troubles.

It was dismissed as \"blatant rubbish\" by the ''[[Daily Express]]''; the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' called it \"a colossal conceit\"; and ''[[The Guardian]]'' labelled the film \"a kind of fantasy morality play about the grossness and warmth and stupidity of the audience\".{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=455\u2013456}} Gould describes it as \"a great deal of raw footage showing a group of people getting on, getting off, and riding on a bus\".{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=455\u2013456}} Although the viewership figures were respectable, its slating in the press led US television networks to lose interest in broadcasting the film.{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=703}}\n\nThe group were less involved with ''Yellow Submarine'', which only featured the band appearing as themselves for a short live-action segment.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=276}} Premiering in July 1968, the film featured cartoon versions of the band members and a soundtrack with eleven of their songs, including four unreleased studio recordings that made their debut in the film.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=485}} Critics praised the film for its music, humour and innovative visual style.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=487\u201388, 505\u2013506}} A [[Yellow Submarine (album)|soundtrack LP]] was issued seven months later; it contained those four new songs, the title track (already issued on ''Revolver''), \"All You Need Is Love\" (already issued as a single and on the US ''Magical Mystery Tour'' LP) and seven instrumental pieces composed by Martin.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=304, 350}}\n\n====India retreat, Apple Corps and the White Album====\nIn February 1968, the Beatles travelled to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's [[ashram]] in [[Rishikesh]], India, to take part in a three-month meditation \"Guide Course\". Their [[The Beatles in India|time in India]] marked one of the band's most prolific periods, yielding numerous songs, including a majority of those on their next album.{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=108\u2013109}} However, Starr left after only ten days, unable to stomach the food, and McCartney eventually grew bored and departed a month later.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=463\u2013468}} For Lennon and Harrison, creativity turned to question when an electronics technician known as [[Magic Alex]] suggested that the Maharishi was attempting to manipulate them.{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=705\u2013706}} When he alleged that the Maharishi had made sexual advances to women attendees, a persuaded Lennon left abruptly just two months into the course, bringing an unconvinced Harrison and the remainder of the group's entourage with him.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=463\u2013468}} In anger, Lennon wrote a scathing song titled \"Maharishi\", renamed \"[[Sexy Sadie]]\" to avoid potential legal issues. McCartney said, \"We made a mistake. We thought there was more to him than there was.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=705\u2013706}}\n\nIn May, Lennon and McCartney traveled to New York for the public unveiling of the Beatles' new business venture, [[Apple Corps]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=282}} It was initially formed several months earlier as part of a plan to create a tax-effective business structure, but the band then desired to extend the corporation to other pursuits, including record distribution, peace activism, and education.{{sfn|Doggett|2011|pp=20, 26}} McCartney described Apple as \"rather like a Western communism\".{{sfn|Doggett|2011|p=26}} The enterprise drained the group financially with a series of unsuccessful projects{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=280\u2013281}} handled largely by members of the Beatles' entourage, who were given their jobs regardless of talent and experience.{{sfn|Doggett|2011|p=22}} Among its numerous subsidiaries were [[Apple Electronics]], established to foster technological innovations with Magic Alex at the head, and Apple Retailing, which opened the short-lived [[Apple Boutique]] in London.{{sfn|Doggett|2011|pp=20, 22, 25, 35}} Harrison later said, \"Basically, it was chaos ...

[It's] John and the band, Paul and the band, George and the band.\"{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=509}} The sessions also produced the Beatles' longest song yet, \"[[Hey Jude]]\", released in August as a non-album single with \"[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=152}}\n\nIssued in November, the White Album was the band's first [[Apple Records]] album release, although EMI continued to own their recordings.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=278}} The record attracted more than 2 million advance orders, selling nearly 4 million copies in the US in little over a month, and its tracks dominated the playlists of American radio stations.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=528}} Its lyric content was the focus of much analysis by the counterculture.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=311\u2013313}} Despite its popularity, reviewers were largely confused by the album's content, and it failed to inspire the level of critical writing that ''Sgt. Pepper'' had.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=528}} General critical opinion eventually turned in favour of the White Album, and in 2003, ''Rolling Stone'' ranked it as the tenth greatest album of all time.<ref name=\"RS 500 greatest\" />\n\n==== ''Abbey Road'', ''Let It Be'' and separation ====\n\nAlthough ''[[Let It Be (Beatles album)|Let It Be]]'' was the Beatles' final album release, it was largely recorded before ''[[Abbey Road]]''. The project's impetus came from an idea Martin attributes to McCartney, who suggested they \"record an album of new material and rehearse it, then perform it before a live audience for the very first time \u2013 on record and on film\".{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=539}} Originally intended for a one-hour television programme to be called ''Beatles at Work'', in the event much of the album's content came from studio work beginning in January 1969, many hours of which were captured on film by director [[Michael Lindsay-Hogg]].{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=539}}{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=306\u2013307}} Martin said that the project was \"not at all a happy recording experience. It was a time when relations between the Beatles were at their lowest ebb.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=539}} Lennon described the largely impromptu sessions as \"hell&nbsp;... the most miserable&nbsp;... on Earth\", and Harrison, \"the low of all-time\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=310}} Irritated by McCartney and Lennon, Harrison walked out for five days. Upon returning, he threatened to leave the band unless they \"abandon[ed] all talk of live performance\" and instead focused on finishing a new album, initially titled ''Get Back'', using songs recorded for the TV special.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=307}} He also demanded they cease work at [[Twickenham Film Studios]], where the sessions had begun, and relocate to the newly finished [[Apple Studio]]. His bandmates agreed, and it was decided to salvage the footage shot for the TV production for use in a feature film.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=306\u2013307, 309}}\n\n[[File:Billy Preston perforning in 1971.jpg|alt=American musician Billy Preston in 1971|thumb|left|American soul musician [[Billy Preston]] (pictured in 1971) was, for a short time, considered a [[fifth Beatle]] during the recording of ''Get Back''.]]\n\nTo alleviate tensions within the band and improve the quality of their live sound, Harrison invited keyboardist [[Billy Preston]] to participate in the last nine days of sessions.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=309\u2013314}} Preston received label billing on the \"[[Get Back]]\" single \u2013 the only musician ever to receive that acknowledgment on an official Beatles release.{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=451, 660}} After the rehearsals, the band could not agree on a location to film a concert, rejecting several ideas, including a boat at sea, a lunatic asylum, the Tunisian desert, and the [[Colosseum]].{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=539}} Ultimately, what would be their [[The Beatles' rooftop concert|final live performance]] was filmed on the rooftop of the Apple Corps building at 3 [[Savile Row]], London, on 30 January 1969.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=307\u2013308, 312}} Five weeks later, engineer [[Glyn Johns]], whom Lewisohn describes as ''Get Back''{{'}}s \"uncredited producer\", began work assembling an album, given \"free rein\" as the band \"all but washed their hands of the entire project\".{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=309, 316\u2013323}}\n\n[[File:3 Savile Row.jpg|thumb|upright=.75|alt=A terrace house with four floors and an attic.

Lennon, Harrison and Starr favoured [[Allen Klein]], who had managed [[the Rolling Stones]] and [[Sam Cooke]];{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=612}} McCartney wanted [[Lee Eastman|Lee]] and John Eastman \u2013 father and brother, respectively, of [[Linda McCartney|Linda Eastman]],{{sfn|Doggett|2011|pp=70, 132}} whom McCartney married on 12 March.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=336}} Agreement could not be reached, so both Klein and the Eastmans were temporarily appointed: Klein as the Beatles' business manager and the Eastmans as their lawyers.{{sfn|Doggett|2011|pp=71\u201372}}{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=164\u2013166}} Further conflict ensued, however, and financial opportunities were lost.{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=612}} On 8 May, Klein was named sole manager of the band,{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=322}} the Eastmans having previously been dismissed as the Beatles' lawyers. McCartney refused to sign the management contract with Klein, but he was out-voted by the other Beatles.{{sfn|Goodman|2015|pp=174\u2013175}}\n\nMartin stated that he was surprised when McCartney asked him to produce another album, as the ''Get Back'' sessions had been \"a miserable experience\" and he had \"thought it was the end of the road for all of us\".{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=560}} The primary recording sessions for ''Abbey Road'' began on 2 July.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=324}} Lennon, who rejected Martin's proposed format of a \"continuously moving piece of music\", wanted his and McCartney's songs to occupy separate sides of the album.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=563}} The eventual format, with individually composed songs on the first side and the second consisting largely of a [[List of musical medleys|medley]], was McCartney's suggested compromise.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=563}} Emerick noted that the replacement of the studio's [[vacuum tube|valve]] mixing console with a transistorised one yielded a less punchy sound, leaving the group frustrated at the thinner tone and lack of impact and contributing to its \"kinder, gentler\" feel relative to their previous albums.{{sfn|Emerick|Massey|2006|pp=277\u2013278}}\n\nOn 4 July, the first solo single by a Beatle was released: Lennon's \"[[Give Peace a Chance]]\", credited to the [[Plastic Ono Band]]. The completion and mixing of \"[[I Want You (She's So Heavy)]]\" on 20 August was the last occasion on which all four Beatles were together in the same studio.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=191}} On 8 September, while Starr was in hospital, the other band members met to discuss recording a new album.

Their initial impact would have been enough to establish the Beatles as one of their era's most influential cultural forces, but they didn't stop there. Although their initial style was a highly original, irresistibly catchy synthesis of early American rock and roll and R&B, the Beatles spent the rest of the 1960s expanding rock's stylistic frontiers, consistently staking out new musical territory on each release. The band's increasingly sophisticated experimentation encompassed a variety of genres, including [[folk-rock]], [[country music|country]], [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]], and [[baroque pop]], without sacrificing the effortless mass appeal of their early work.{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=160}}}}\n\nIn ''The Beatles as Musicians'', [[Walter Everett (musicologist)|Walter Everett]] describes Lennon and McCartney's contrasting motivations and approaches to composition: \"McCartney may be said to have constantly developed \u2013 as a means to entertain \u2013 a focused musical talent with an ear for counterpoint and other aspects of craft in the demonstration of a universally agreed-upon common language that he did much to enrich. Conversely, Lennon's mature music is best appreciated as the daring product of a largely unconscious, searching but undisciplined artistic sensibility.\"{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=9}}\n\nIan MacDonald describes McCartney as \"a natural melodist \u2013 a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony\". His melody lines are characterised as primarily \"vertical\", employing wide, [[Consonance and dissonance|consonant]] intervals which express his \"extrovert energy and optimism\". Conversely, Lennon's \"sedentary, ironic personality\" is reflected in a \"horizontal\" approach featuring minimal, dissonant intervals and repetitive melodies which rely on their harmonic accompaniment for interest: \"Basically a realist, he instinctively kept his melodies close to the rhythms and cadences of speech, colouring his lyrics with bluesy tone and harmony rather than creating tunes that made striking shapes of their own.\"{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=12}} MacDonald praises Harrison's lead guitar work for the role his \"characterful lines and textural colourings\" play in supporting Lennon and McCartney's parts, and describes Starr as \"the father of modern pop/rock drumming\".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=382\u2013383}}\n\n=== Influences ===\nThe band's earliest influences include [[Elvis Presley]], [[Carl Perkins]], [[Little Richard]] and [[Chuck Berry]].{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=140, 660, 856\u2013858, 881}} During the Beatles' co-residency with Little Richard at the [[Star-Club]] in Hamburg, from April to May 1962, he advised them on the proper technique for performing his songs.{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=660}} Of Presley, Lennon said, \"Nothing really affected me until I heard Elvis. If there hadn't been Elvis, there would not have been the Beatles.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=881}} Other early influences include [[Buddy Holly]], [[Eddie Cochran]], [[Roy Orbison]]{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=289, 526, 830}} and [[the Everly Brothers]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=111, 123, 131, 133}}\n\nThe Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[the Who]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[the Lovin' Spoonful]], [[the Byrds]] and [[the Beach Boys]], whose 1966 album ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' amazed and inspired McCartney.{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=99, 217, 357, 1195}}{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=333\u2013335, 359}}{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|pp=147, 150, 162, 169}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Miles |first=Barry |date=November 1966 |title=A Conversation with Paul McCartney |newspaper=International Times |location=London}}</ref> Referring to the Beach Boys' creative leader, Martin later stated: \"No one made a greater impact on the Beatles than Brian [Wilson].\"{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=17}} Ravi Shankar, with whom Harrison studied for six weeks in India in late 1966, had a significant effect on his musical development during the band's later years.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|pp=147, 165, 177}}\n\n=== Genres ===\nOriginating as a skiffle group, the Beatles quickly embraced 1950s rock and roll and helped pioneer the Merseybeat genre,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/style/merseybeat-ma0000012018/songs|title=Merseybeat \u2013 Significant Albums, Artists and Songs|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=27 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016041739/http://www.allmusic.com/style/merseybeat-ma0000012018/songs|archive-date=16 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> and their repertoire ultimately expanded to include a broad variety of pop music.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=30\u201332, 100\u2013107}} Reflecting the range of styles they explored, Lennon said of ''Beatles for Sale'', \"You could call our new one a Beatles country-and-western LP\",{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=255}} while Gould credits ''Rubber Soul'' as \"the instrument by which legions of folk-music enthusiasts were coaxed into the camp of pop\".{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=296}}\n\n[[File:Guitarras de McCartney y Harrison.jpg|upright=.75|thumb|A [[H\u00f6fner 500/1|H\u00f6fner \"violin\" bass guitar]] and [[Gretsch|Gretsch Country Gentleman guitar]], models played by McCartney and Harrison, respectively; the [[Vox AC30]] amplifier behind them is the model the Beatles used during performances in the early 1960s.|alt=Two electric guitars, a light brown violin-shaped bass and a darker brown guitar resting against a Vox amplifier]]\n\nAlthough the 1965 song \"Yesterday\" was not the first pop record to employ orchestral strings, it marked the group's first recorded use of classical music elements. Gould observes: \"The more traditional sound of strings allowed for a fresh appreciation of their talent as composers by listeners who were otherwise allergic to the din of drums and electric guitars.\"{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=278}} They continued to experiment with string arrangements to various effect; ''Sgt. Pepper''{{'}}s \"[[She's Leaving Home]]\", for instance, is \"cast in the {{lang|en-US|mold}} of a sentimental Victorian ballad\", Gould writes, \"its words and music filled with the clich\u00e9s of musical melodrama\".{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=402}}\n\nThe band's stylistic range expanded in another direction with their 1966 B-side \"Rain\", described by [[Martin C. Strong|Martin Strong]] as \"the first overtly psychedelic Beatles record\".{{sfn|Strong|2004|p=108}} Other psychedelic numbers followed, such as \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" (recorded before \"Rain\"), \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", \"[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]\" and \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\". The influence of [[Indian classical music]] was evident in Harrison's \"[[The Inner Light (song)|The Inner Light]]\", \"[[Love You To]]\" and \"[[Within You Without You]]\" \u2013 Gould describes the latter two as attempts \"to replicate the [[raga]] form in miniature\".{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=406, 462\u2013463}}\n\nInnovation was the most striking feature of their creative evolution, according to music historian and pianist Michael Campbell: \"'A Day in the Life' encapsulates the art and achievement of the Beatles as well as any single track can. It highlights key features of their music: the sound imagination, the persistence of tuneful melody, and the close coordination between words and music. It represents a new category of song \u2013 more sophisticated than pop&nbsp;... and uniquely innovative. There literally had never before been a song \u2013 classical or vernacular \u2013 that had blended so many disparate elements so imaginatively.\"{{sfn|Campbell|2008|p=196}} Philosophy professor Bruce Ellis Benson agrees: \"the Beatles&nbsp;... give us a wonderful example of how such far-ranging influences as Celtic music, rhythm and blues, and country and western could be put together in a new way.\"{{sfn|Benson|2003|p=43}}\n\nAuthor Dominic Pedler describes the way they crossed musical styles: \"Far from moving sequentially from one genre to another (as is sometimes conveniently suggested) the group maintained ''in parallel'' their mastery of the traditional, catchy chart hit while simultaneously forging rock and dabbling with a wide range of peripheral influences from country to vaudeville. One of these threads was their take on folk music, which would form such essential groundwork for their later collisions with Indian music and philosophy.\"{{sfn|Pedler|2003|p=256}} As the personal relationships between the band members grew increasingly strained, their individual tastes became more apparent. The minimalistic cover artwork for the White Album contrasted with the complexity and diversity of its music, which encompassed Lennon's \"[[Revolution 9]]\" (whose [[musique concr\u00e8te]] approach was influenced by Yoko Ono), Starr's [[country music|country]] song \"[[Don't Pass Me By]]\", Harrison's [[rock ballad]] \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\", and the \"[[Heavy metal music#Origins: late 1960s and early 1970s|proto-metal]] roar\" of McCartney's \"[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]\".<ref name=\"White Album AllMusic\">{{cite web |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |title=''The Beatles [White Album]'' \u2013 The Beatles |publisher=AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-beatles-white-album-mw0000418113 |accessdate=21 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530202730/https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-beatles-white-album-mw0000418113 |archive-date=30 May 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Contribution of George Martin ===\n[[File:Beatles and George Martin in studio 1966.JPG|right|thumb|alt=The Beatles with George Martin in the studio in the mid-1960s|Martin (second from right) in the studio with the Beatles in the mid-1960s]]\n[[George Martin]]'s close involvement in his role as producer made him one of the leading candidates for the informal title of the \"[[fifth Beatle]]\".{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=721}} He applied his classical musical training in various ways, and functioned as \"an informal music teacher\" to the progressing songwriters, according to Gould.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=121, 290}} Martin suggested to a sceptical McCartney that the arrangement of \"Yesterday\" should feature a string quartet accompaniment, thereby introducing the Beatles to a \"hitherto unsuspected world of classical instrumental colour\", in MacDonald's description.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=158}} Their creative development was also facilitated by Martin's willingness to experiment in response to their suggestions, such as adding \"something [[baroque music|baroque]]\" to a particular recording.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=290}} In addition to scoring orchestral arrangements for recordings, Martin often performed on them, playing instruments including piano, organ and [[Brass instrument|brass]].{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=382, 405, 409, 443, 584}}\n\nCollaborating with Lennon and McCartney required Martin to adapt to their different approaches to songwriting and recording. MacDonald comments, \"while [he] worked more naturally with the conventionally articulate McCartney, the challenge of catering to Lennon's intuitive approach generally spurred him to his more original arrangements, of which '[[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!]]' is an outstanding example.\"{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=238}} Martin said of the two composers' distinct songwriting styles and his stabilising influence:\n\n{{blockquote|Compared with Paul's songs, all of which seemed to keep in some sort of touch with reality, John's had a psychedelic, almost mystical quality&nbsp;... John's imagery is one of the best things about his work&nbsp;\u2013 'tangerine trees', 'marmalade skies', 'cellophane flowers' ...&nbsp;I always saw him as an aural [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], rather than some drug-ridden record artist. On the other hand, I would be stupid to pretend that drugs didn't figure quite heavily in the Beatles' lives at that time&nbsp;... they knew that I, in my schoolmasterly role, didn't approve&nbsp;... Not only was I not into it myself, I couldn't see the need for it; and there's no doubt that, if I too had been on dope, ''Pepper'' would never have been the album it was.

Seeking ways to put chance occurrences to creative use, accidental guitar feedback, a resonating glass bottle, a tape loaded the wrong way round so that it played backwards \u2013 any of these might be incorporated into their music.{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1995|p=103}} Their desire to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers Norman Smith, [[Ken Townsend]] and Geoff Emerick, all contributed significantly to their records from ''Rubber Soul'' and, especially, ''Revolver'' onwards.{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1995|p=103}}\n\nAlong with innovative studio techniques such as [[audio signal processing|sound effects]], unconventional microphone placements, tape loops, [[double tracking]] and [[vari-speed]] recording, the Beatles augmented their songs with instruments that were unconventional in rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the sitar in \"Norwegian Wood\" and the [[swarmandal]] in \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=212}} They also used novel electronic instruments such as the Mellotron, with which McCartney supplied the flute voices on the \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" intro,{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=219}} and the [[clavioline]], an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on \"[[Baby, You're a Rich Man]]\".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=259}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{Main|Cultural impact of the Beatles}}\n\n[[File:The Beatles on Green Hill in Almaty, Kazakhstan.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|alt=A monument of the English rock band the Beatles in Almaty, Kazakhstan|''The Beatles Monument'' in [[Almaty]], [[Kazakhstan]]]]\n\nFormer ''Rolling Stone'' associate editor [[Robert Greenfield]] compared the Beatles to [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], as \"artists who broke through the constraints of their time period to come up with something that was unique and original&nbsp;...

The company was organised with James and his partner, Emmanuel Silver, owning a controlling interest, variously described as 51% or 50% plus one share. McCartney had 20%. Reports again vary concerning Lennon's portion \u2013 19 or 20% \u2013 and Brian Epstein's \u2013 9 or 10% \u2013 which he received in lieu of a 25% band management fee.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=15\u201317}}{{sfn|Norman|1996|pp=169\u201371, 368\u2013369}}{{sfn|Brown|Gaines|2002|p=178}} In 1965, the company went public. Five million shares were created, of which the original principals retained 3.75 million. James and Silver each received 937,500 shares (18.75% of 5 million); Lennon and McCartney each received 750,000 shares (15%); and Epstein's management company, NEMS Enterprises, received 375,000 shares (7.5%). Of the 1.25 million shares put up for sale, Harrison and Starr each acquired 40,000.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=37\u201338}} At the time of the stock offering, Lennon and McCartney renewed their three-year publishing contracts, binding them to Northern Songs until 1973.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=42}}\n\nHarrison created [[Harrisongs]] to represent his Beatles compositions, but signed a three-year contract with Northern Songs that gave it the copyright to his work through March 1968, which included \"[[Taxman]]\" and \"[[Within You Without You]]\".{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=45}} The songs on which Starr received co-writing credit before 1968, such as \"[[What Goes On (The Beatles song)|What Goes On]]\" and \"[[Flying (The Beatles song)|Flying]]\", were also Northern Songs copyrights.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=46\u201347}} Harrison did not renew his contract with Northern Songs when it ended, signing instead with [[Apple Corps|Apple Publishing]] while retaining the copyright to his work from that point on. Harrison thus owns the rights to his later Beatles songs such as \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\" and \"Something\". That year, as well, Starr created [[Startling Music]], which holds the rights to his Beatles compositions, \"Don't Pass Me By\" and \"[[Octopus's Garden]]\".{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=60\u201361}}{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=351}}\n\nIn March 1969, James arranged to sell his and his partner's shares of Northern Songs to the British broadcasting company [[Associated Television]] (ATV), founded by impresario [[Lew Grade]], without first informing the Beatles. The band then made a bid to gain a controlling interest by attempting to work out a deal with a consortium of London brokerage firms that had accumulated a 14% holding.{{sfn|Norman|1996|pp=369\u2013372}} The deal collapsed over the objections of Lennon, who declared, \"I'm sick of being fucked about by men in suits sitting on their fat arses in [[City of London|the City]].\"{{sfn|Norman|1996|p=372}} By the end of May, ATV had acquired a majority stake in Northern Songs, controlling nearly the entire Lennon\u2013McCartney catalogue, as well as any future material until 1973.{{sfn|Miles|1998|p=296}} In frustration, Lennon and McCartney sold their shares to ATV in late October 1969.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=236}}\n\nIn 1981, financial losses by ATV's parent company, [[Associated Communications Corporation]] (ACC), led it to attempt to sell its music division. According to authors Brian Southall and Rupert Perry, Grade contacted McCartney, offering ATV Music and Northern Songs for $30 million.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=129}} According to an account McCartney gave in 1995, he met with Grade and explained he was interested solely in the Northern Songs catalogue if Grade were ever willing to \"separate off\" that portion of ATV Music. Soon afterwards, Grade offered to sell him Northern Songs for \u00a320 million, giving the ex-Beatle \"a week or so\" to decide. By McCartney's account, he and Ono countered with a \u00a35 million bid that was rejected.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=130}} According to reports at the time, Grade refused to separate Northern Songs and turned down an offer of \u00a321\u201325 million from McCartney and Ono for Northern Songs. In 1982, ACC was acquired in a [[takeover]] by Australian business magnate [[Robert Holmes \u00e0 Court]] for \u00a360 million.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=130, 139}}\n\nIn 1985, [[Michael Jackson]] purchased ATV for a reported $47.5 million. The acquisition gave him control over the publishing rights to more than 200 Beatles songs, as well as 40,000 other copyrights.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=140, 174, 176}} In 1995, in a deal that earned him a reported $110 million, Jackson merged his music publishing business with [[Sony]], creating a new company, [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]], in which he held a 50% stake. The merger made the new company, then valued at over half a billion dollars, the third-largest music publisher in the world.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=198}} In 2016, Sony acquired Jackson's share of Sony/ATV from the Jackson estate for $750 million.<ref>Christman, Ed. \"Sony Finalizes Acquisition of Michael Jackson Estate's Stake in Sony/ATV Publishing\" ''Billboard'' 30 September 2016</ref>\n\nDespite the lack of publishing rights to most of their songs, Lennon's estate and McCartney continue to receive their respective shares of the writers' royalties, which together are 33{{frac|3}}% of total commercial proceeds in the US and which vary elsewhere around the world between 50 and 55%.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=195}} Two of Lennon and McCartney's earliest songs \u2013 \"Love Me Do\" and \"P.S. I Love You\" \u2013 were published by an EMI subsidiary, Ardmore & Beechwood, before they signed with James. McCartney acquired their publishing rights from Ardmore{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=192\u2013193}} in 1978,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=13&ti=1,13&SC=Author&SA=Ardmore%20%26%20Beechwood%2C%20Ltd%2E&PID=Upy2LYQ_qgX3JEfWR3-tuPzH0eAB&SEQ=20190215123104&SID=4 |title=Public Catalog |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=19 May 1978 |website=cocatalog.loc.gov |publisher=U.S. Copyright Office |access-date=15 February 2019 |quote=}}</ref> and they are the only two Beatles songs owned by McCartney's company MPL Communications.{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=536}} On 18 January 2017, McCartney filed a suit in the [[United States district court]] against Sony/ATV Music Publishing seeking to reclaim ownership of his share of the Lennon\u2013McCartney song catalogue beginning in 2018.
