It was written by Lo and its producers Jakob Jerlstr\u00f6m and Ludvig S\u00f6derberg, known collectively as The Struts. The track was released for [[music download|digital download]] on 4 August 2016 as the album's [[lead single]]. It was released to [[contemporary hit radio]] stations in the United States on 23 August, and in the United Kingdom three days later. \n\nThe song is a [[Beat (music)#Downbeat and upbeat|downtempo]] [[electropop]] work with elements of [[techno]] and [[house music]]. The track was inspired by the \"Cool Girl\" monologue by character Amy Elliott-Dunne in the 2014 feature film ''[[Gone Girl (film)|Gone Girl]]''. According to the singer, the lyrics talk about the \"games that we play in a relationship because we are so scared to be vulnerable\". [[Music journalism|Critics]] had diverse opinions about the meaning of the track, with some of them noting themes about [[casual relationship|casual]] and commitment-free relationships.\n\n\"Cool Girl\" received positive reviews from critics, who commended its production and lyrical themes. It was a moderate commercial success, entering the top 30 in Australia, Denmark, New Zealand and Sweden. It received sales certifications in these countries as well as in France, Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom. An accompanying music video for the song premiered on 19 August 2016, as the first installment of the [[Tim Erem]]-directed short film, ''[[Fairy Dust (film)|Fairy Dust]]'', which features some songs from ''Lady Wood''. In the clip, Lo appears dancing on a motel parking lot with a group of dancers, while in another scene she is shown with her head shaved in the middle of a desert writing on top of a glass coffin. \n\nLo performed the song in 2016 on television shows ''[[The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon]]'', Sweden{{'}}s ''[[Idol 2016]]'' and ''[[The X Factor Australia]]''. The performance on ''Idol 2016'' garnered negative reviews from viewers, who criticized the singer for touching her crotch on a [[family-friendly]] show. Lo later included \"Cool Girl\" on the set list of her ''[[Lady Wood Tour]]'' in 2017.\n\n== Background and development ==\nThe writing process for \"Cool Girl\" started when Lo was taking a day-off during her [[Queen of the Clouds Tour|Queen of the Clouds tour]] in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark. She received a [[bass line]] at her hotel from Jakob Jerlstr\u00f6m and Ludvig S\u00f6derberg, known collectively as The Struts. They ask her if she wanted to write lyrics to it. Since she liked the track, Lo set up her bedroom studio and started listening to it on repeat. She had recently watched the film ''[[Gone Girl (film)|Gone Girl]]'' (2014), and began to analyze a monologue by the character portrayed by [[Rosamund Pike]] talking about being a \"cool girl\".<ref name=\"back\"/><ref name=\"genius\"/> Lo added, \"I just remember this monologue that she has in the movie where she says she's changed a lot things [sic] about herself to become someone that she thought her husband would want.\"<ref name=\"genius\">{{cite web |url=https://genius.com/a/tove-lo-breaks-down-cool-girl-on-genius-video-series-verified |title=Tove Lo Breaks Down 'Cool Girl' On Genius' Video Series 'Verified' |last=Kennedy |first=John |date=13 October 2016 |website=[[Genius (website)|Genius]] |publisher= |access-date=18 November 2019 |quote=Watch the video included on the article. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191118044908/https://genius.com/a/tove-lo-breaks-down-cool-girl-on-genius-video-series-verified |archive-date=18 November 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Inspired by the monologue, she wrote the melody, chorus and pre-chorus with sarcastic lyrics and sent the track back to The Struts.

It was written by Lo and its producers Jakob Jerlstr\u00f6m and Ludvig S\u00f6derberg, known collectively as The Struts. The track was released for [[music download|digital download]] on 4 August 2016 as the album's [[lead single]]. It was released to [[contemporary hit radio]] stations in the United States on 23 August, and in the United Kingdom three days later. \n\nThe song is a [[Beat (music)#Downbeat and upbeat|downtempo]] [[electropop]] work with elements of [[techno]] and [[house music]]. The track was inspired by the \"Cool Girl\" monologue by character Amy Elliott-Dunne in the 2014 feature film ''[[Gone Girl (film)|Gone Girl]]''. According to the singer, the lyrics talk about the \"games that we play in a relationship because we are so scared to be vulnerable\". [[Music journalism|Critics]] had diverse opinions about the meaning of the track, with some of them noting themes about [[casual relationship|casual]] and commitment-free relationships.\n\n\"Cool Girl\" received positive reviews from critics, who commended its production and lyrical themes. It was a moderate commercial success, entering the top 30 in Australia, Denmark, New Zealand and Sweden. It received sales certifications in these countries as well as in France, Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom. An accompanying music video for the song premiered on 19 August 2016, as the first installment of the [[Tim Erem]]-directed short film, ''[[Fairy Dust (film)|Fairy Dust]]'', which features some songs from ''Lady Wood''. In the clip, Lo appears dancing on a motel parking lot with a group of dancers, while in another scene she is shown with her head shaved in the middle of a desert writing on top of a glass coffin. \n\nLo performed the song in 2016 on television shows ''[[The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon]]'', Sweden{{'}}s ''[[Idol 2016]]'' and ''[[The X Factor Australia]]''. The performance on ''Idol 2016'' garnered negative reviews from viewers, who criticized the singer for touching her crotch on a [[family-friendly]] show. Lo later included \"Cool Girl\" on the set list of her ''[[Lady Wood Tour]]'' in 2017.\n\n== Background and development ==\nThe writing process for \"Cool Girl\" started when Lo was taking a day-off during her [[Queen of the Clouds Tour|Queen of the Clouds tour]] in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark. She received a [[bass line]] at her hotel from Jakob Jerlstr\u00f6m and Ludvig S\u00f6derberg, known collectively as The Struts. They ask her if she wanted to write lyrics to it. Since she liked the track, Lo set up her bedroom studio and started listening to it on repeat. She had recently watched the film ''[[Gone Girl (film)|Gone Girl]]'' (2014), and began to analyze a monologue by the character portrayed by [[Rosamund Pike]] talking about being a \"cool girl\".<ref name=\"back\"/><ref name=\"genius\"/> Lo added, \"I just remember this monologue that she has in the movie where she says she's changed a lot things [sic] about herself to become someone that she thought her husband would want.\"<ref name=\"genius\">{{cite web |url=https://genius.com/a/tove-lo-breaks-down-cool-girl-on-genius-video-series-verified |title=Tove Lo Breaks Down 'Cool Girl' On Genius' Video Series 'Verified' |last=Kennedy |first=John |date=13 October 2016 |website=[[Genius (website)|Genius]] |publisher= |access-date=18 November 2019 |quote=Watch the video included on the article. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191118044908/https://genius.com/a/tove-lo-breaks-down-cool-girl-on-genius-video-series-verified |archive-date=18 November 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Inspired by the monologue, she wrote the melody, chorus and pre-chorus with sarcastic lyrics and sent the track back to The Struts.
