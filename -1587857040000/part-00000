After returning to Salem, Steve and Kayla finally make love for the first time. After Steve is cleared, Harper hires Kayla to be his son Jack's nurse. An old friend of Kayla's, Jack falls in love with her. Steve knows how happy Kayla makes a dying Jack, who is secretly another sibling whom Jo Johnson had placed up for adoption.

Kayla finally remembers Harper was the man who attacked her, just before being taken hostage by him at the loft. After that experience, Kayla undergoes a risky surgery to restore her hearing and agrees to marry Steve.\n\nAfter their marriage, Steve and Kayla almost adopt a young deaf boy named Benji, who is eventually found to be Stefano DiMera's son. Later, Steve helps Nick Corelli hide from the police.<ref name=\"buddytv1\"/> Nick gifts Steve and Kayla with a mansion for their trouble.

Steve agrees to undergo plastic surgery fix his eye, in order to infiltrate the preacher's camp for the ISA as Daniel Lucas.\n \nAfter the ISA operation ends with the appearance of Shane's death, life is upended for Steve and Kayla yet again when Marina Toscano appears, claiming to be Steve's presumed dead first wife. Knowing she is pregnant but not yet having told Steve, Kayla encourages Steve to help Marina, in hopes the old entanglements can be resolved. Marina and Steve travel to Italy to retrieve the key, where Kayla catches them in an apparently compromising situation. Steve's eye socket is damaged again in a fight, and he decides to start wearing the patch again. Back in Salem, Steve works to regain Kayla's trust, and is shocked to learn from Jack she is pregnant. Kayla and Marina argue in her hotel room, where Marina is later found dead.\n\nKayla is kidnapped by [[Victor Kiriakis]], and released in exchange for the key. Steve and Kayla plan another wedding, as their marriage had been invalidated by the fact of Marina, but Kayla is arrested during the ceremony for her murder. Kayla gives birth to Stephanie Johnson after going into labor on the witness stand. Convicted of murder, Kayla is sent to prison. At first she tries to keep Stephanie with her, but then decides prison was no place for a baby. Sheila the nanny, who had become obsessed with the baby, kidnaps Stephanie and takes her to Australia. Upon hearing of Stephanie's kidnapping, Kayla escapes from prison, and she and Steve follow Sheila to Australia where they manage to get their baby back. After word came that Kayla had been cleared of Marina's murder, they return to Salem, where they are finally legally married.\n\nIn the fall of 1990, Steve decides to become a police officer. He is injured in a boat explosion, rigged by Lawrence Alamain and meant for Bo. Steve begins to recover, but is \"killed\" when Lawrence has his IV poisoned.

She had been planning to go to Africa with Doctors Without Borders, but is shocked when Steve appears at the church. He doesn't remember his past, and she is devastated to think he doesn't know who she is and to watch him take up with [[Billie Reed]]. A series of events, including their daughter's race car crash and a stay in quarantine after being exposed to a toxin at the hospital, help slowly bring them back together. Eventually, a trip to a cabin where they once hid out together on the run sparks Steve's memory to return in its entirety, and the two are reunited.\n\nIn 2007, Benji DiMera (who's forced by EJ) returns to Salem with a tarot card that turns Steve into a DiMera soldier. It turns out Stefano and EJ had tortured him during his missing years. Due to Steve's programming, Kayla is forced into removing John Black's kidney so an ailing Stefano can have it. Steve is committed to the mental hospital, and Kayla works to help him recover, despite his resistance. When his programming is again activated by EJ in order to have him kill Bo on Tinda Lau, Kayla is finally able to break through to him, and they spend some time on the island recovering.\n\nBack in Salem, Steve and Kayla begin to discuss the idea of having another baby. When Philip Kiriakis' son Tyler is abandoned anonymously at the hospital by Philip and Mimi's surrogate, Kayla and Steve take him in and care for him as Pocket. After Steve takes Stefano hostage in retaliation for Benji's murder when the vendetta heats up, social services take Pocket away when he becomes ill. Steve and Kayla are accused of poisoning him by Philip, but it turns out to be a rare genetic disorder. Steve and Kayla and Philip all decide it was in his best interest to go live with another foster family.\n\nIn 2008, Kayla and Steve support Stephanie after it is revealed she was raped by Ford Decker. They travel to Ireland to help Shawn meet with the sister he had thought was dead. While there, Kayla learns she is pregnant. Kayla and Steve are both caught in the plane crash on the way back to Salem, which kills her father [[Shawn Brady]] and is later found to be the work of a deranged Ava Vitali. Kayla aids Daniel and Lexie in treating Bo's pancreas condition. Under all these stresses, she begins to have problems with her pregnancy, which leads Steve to keep the information about his ex-girlfriend Ava from her. Ava mistakenly kidnaps Hope thinking she is Kayla, but Steve, Kayla, and Bo soon follow to rescue Hope. Kayla discovers the pills Ava had been taking kept Ava from ever becoming sane. Afterward, Ava leaves Steve and Kayla alone, though she fled the country rather than pay for her crimes.\n\nStressed, and with an already troubled pregnancy, Kayla goes into premature labor. Joseph Johnson is delivered at 26 weeks. After stabilizing, he is briefly kidnapped in the late summer of 2008 by Stefano DiMera. In early 2009, Kayla is accidentally shot by Hope at University Hospital, a situation Bo has foreseen in his psychic visions. Though the bullet penetrates the sac around the heart, Kayla recovers after surgery. Offscreen, Kayla and Steve decide to leave Salem to run a clinic in a remote part of the world. They take their infant son with them, and relay their decision and details of their situation to their daughter Stephanie in a letter, in April 2009.\n\nIn June 2010, Kayla briefly returns along with several other Brady and Horton family members to pay respects to Alice Horton after she took ill. Kayla returned once again in December 2011 to assist Caroline in running the Brady Pub. She further confesses she and Steve were experiencing issues, and he was back in the ISA. She confessed that while he was the man she loved, he was not the man she wanted to be with.\n\n==Cultural impact==\nIn the mid-80s, the baby name \"Kayla\" jumped from the roughly 900th most popular girl's name, to around the top 10, where it has remained ever since.

Steve agrees to undergo plastic surgery fix his eye, in order to infiltrate the preacher's camp for the ISA as Daniel Lucas.\n \nAfter the ISA operation ends with the appearance of Shane's death, life is upended for Steve and Kayla yet again when Marina Toscano appears, claiming to be Steve's presumed dead first wife. Knowing she is pregnant but not yet having told Steve, Kayla encourages Steve to help Marina, in hopes the old entanglements can be resolved. Marina and Steve travel to Italy to retrieve the key, where Kayla catches them in an apparently compromising situation. Steve's eye socket is damaged again in a fight, and he decides to start wearing the patch again. Back in Salem, Steve works to regain Kayla's trust, and is shocked to learn from Jack she is pregnant. Kayla and Marina argue in her hotel room, where Marina is later found dead.\n\nKayla is kidnapped by [[Victor Kiriakis]], and released in exchange for the key. Steve and Kayla plan another wedding, as their marriage had been invalidated by the fact of Marina, but Kayla is arrested during the ceremony for her murder. Kayla gives birth to Stephanie Johnson after going into labor on the witness stand. Convicted of murder, Kayla is sent to prison. At first she tries to keep Stephanie with her, but then decides prison was no place for a baby. Sheila the nanny, who had become obsessed with the baby, kidnaps Stephanie and takes her to Australia. Upon hearing of Stephanie's kidnapping, Kayla escapes from prison, and she and Steve follow Sheila to Australia where they manage to get their baby back. After word came that Kayla had been cleared of Marina's murder, they return to Salem, where they are finally legally married.\n\nIn the fall of 1990, Steve decides to become a police officer. He is injured in a boat explosion, rigged by Lawrence Alamain and meant for Bo. Steve begins to recover, but is \"killed\" when Lawrence has his IV poisoned. Kayla moves in with Shane Donovan for protection, and the two eventually begin a relationship. Things become complicated when Kim returns to town in 1991 to find her sister and ex-husband living together, and circumstances lead her to become involved with Lawrence Alamain.\n\nShane is paralyzed in the line of duty. At first he refuses to have the surgery to regain the use of his legs, but Kayla helps him recover as their relationship deepens. However, Kayla decides to move to Los Angeles in the spring of 1992 to start a new life for her and her daughter.\n\n===2006\u2014===\nIn 2006, Kayla, now a doctor, returns to Salem for Frankie and Jennifer's wedding, having completed medical school in Los Angeles. She had been planning to go to Africa with Doctors Without Borders, but is shocked when Steve appears at the church. He doesn't remember his past, and she is devastated to think he doesn't know who she is and to watch him take up with [[Billie Reed]]. A series of events, including their daughter's race car crash and a stay in quarantine after being exposed to a toxin at the hospital, help slowly bring them back together. Eventually, a trip to a cabin where they once hid out together on the run sparks Steve's memory to return in its entirety, and the two are reunited.\n\nIn 2007, Benji DiMera (who's forced by EJ) returns to Salem with a tarot card that turns Steve into a DiMera soldier. It turns out Stefano and EJ had tortured him during his missing years. Due to Steve's programming, Kayla is forced into removing John Black's kidney so an ailing Stefano can have it. Steve is committed to the mental hospital, and Kayla works to help him recover, despite his resistance. When his programming is again activated by EJ in order to have him kill Bo on Tinda Lau, Kayla is finally able to break through to him, and they spend some time on the island recovering.\n\nBack in Salem, Steve and Kayla begin to discuss the idea of having another baby. When Philip Kiriakis' son Tyler is abandoned anonymously at the hospital by Philip and Mimi's surrogate, Kayla and Steve take him in and care for him as Pocket. After Steve takes Stefano hostage in retaliation for Benji's murder when the vendetta heats up, social services take Pocket away when he becomes ill. Steve and Kayla are accused of poisoning him by Philip, but it turns out to be a rare genetic disorder. Steve and Kayla and Philip all decide it was in his best interest to go live with another foster family.\n\nIn 2008, Kayla and Steve support Stephanie after it is revealed she was raped by Ford Decker. They travel to Ireland to help Shawn meet with the sister he had thought was dead. While there, Kayla learns she is pregnant. Kayla and Steve are both caught in the plane crash on the way back to Salem, which kills her father [[Shawn Brady]] and is later found to be the work of a deranged Ava Vitali. Kayla aids Daniel and Lexie in treating Bo's pancreas condition. Under all these stresses, she begins to have problems with her pregnancy, which leads Steve to keep the information about his ex-girlfriend Ava from her. Ava mistakenly kidnaps Hope thinking she is Kayla, but Steve, Kayla, and Bo soon follow to rescue Hope. Kayla discovers the pills Ava had been taking kept Ava from ever becoming sane. Afterward, Ava leaves Steve and Kayla alone, though she fled the country rather than pay for her crimes.\n\nStressed, and with an already troubled pregnancy, Kayla goes into premature labor. Joseph Johnson is delivered at 26 weeks. After stabilizing, he is briefly kidnapped in the late summer of 2008 by Stefano DiMera. In early 2009, Kayla is accidentally shot by Hope at University Hospital, a situation Bo has foreseen in his psychic visions. Though the bullet penetrates the sac around the heart, Kayla recovers after surgery. Offscreen, Kayla and Steve decide to leave Salem to run a clinic in a remote part of the world. They take their infant son with them, and relay their decision and details of their situation to their daughter Stephanie in a letter, in April 2009.\n\nIn June 2010, Kayla briefly returns along with several other Brady and Horton family members to pay respects to Alice Horton after she took ill. Kayla returned once again in December 2011 to assist Caroline in running the Brady Pub. She further confesses she and Steve were experiencing issues, and he was back in the ISA. She confessed that while he was the man she loved, he was not the man she wanted to be with.\n\n==Cultural impact==\nIn the mid-80s, the baby name \"Kayla\" jumped from the roughly 900th most popular girl's name, to around the top 10, where it has remained ever since. This is widely attributed to Kayla Brady's arrival on the show, with which it coincides.<ref>[http://www.thinkbabynames.com/search.php?g=0&t=1&s=Kayla Baby Names - Kayla<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.soapcentral.com/days/whoswho/kayla.php Kayla Brady Johnson profile - SoapCentral.com]\n\n{{Days of Our Lives}}\n{{Days of Our Lives characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Johnson, Kayla}}\n[[Category:Days of Our Lives characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional physicians]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1982]]\n[[Category:Fictional sexual assault victims]]\n", "name_user": "78.246.10.107", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(KAYLA BRADY)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayla_Brady"}

The 12Y became the primary French 1,000&nbsp;hp (750&nbsp;kW) class engine and was used in a number of famous aircraft, including the [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406]] and [[Dewoitine D.520]].\n\nIts design was based on the earlier and somewhat smaller, [[Hispano-Suiza 12X|12X]]. The 12X did not see widespread use before the 12Y replaced it and became one of the most powerful French designs on the eve of the war. The [[Hispano-Suiza 12Z|12Z]] was being designed but this was ended by the fall of France and the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation]].\n\nThe 12Y was produced under [[Hispano-Suiza]] licence in the Soviet Union as the '''Klimov M-100'''. This design led to the highly successful [[Klimov M-105|Klimov VK-105]] series that powered the [[Yak-1|Yakovlev]] and [[Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Gudkov LaGG-3|Lavochkin]] fighters as well as the [[Petlyakov Pe-2]] bomber. Licensed production of the early models was also undertaken in [[Czechoslovakia]] as the '''Avia HS 12Ydrs''' and in [[Switzerland]] as the HS-77.\n\n==Design and development==\n\n===Early development===\nThe 12Y was a fairly traditional in construction, a 36-litre [[Water cooling|water-cooled]] [[V12 engine|V-12]] with the two cast aluminium cylinder banks set at 60 degrees to each other. The [[cylinder head]]s were not removable, instead both [[cylinder bank]]s could be quickly removed from the [[crankcase]] section of the engine. This made it somewhat famous for being leak-proof, a design feature that was considered by other designers and almost became a part of the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]].\n\nThe major design change from the earlier 12X was to use a master-articulated [[connecting rod]] system, instead of the fork-and-blade type. A [[single overhead camshaft]] (SOHC) drove the [[Poppet valve|valves]], which were filled with liquid [[sodium]] for cooling. Only a single intake and exhaust valve were used, unlike most designs of the era which had moved to three or four valves per cylinder. A single-stage, single-speed [[supercharger]] was standard, although the art of designing a useful [[intake]] was not as well developed as in other countries, and high [[altitude]] performance was always lacking.\n\nThe first 12Y test articles were constructed in 1932, and almost immediately the entire French aviation industry started designing around it. At the time the engine developed only 760&nbsp;hp (570&nbsp;kW), but it was clear it had potential to the 1,000&nbsp;hp (750&nbsp;kW) class. An early modification led to the '''Hispano-Suiza 12Ycrs''' which used a hollow [[Driveshaft|propeller shaft]] to allow a [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|20 mm cannon]] to fire through the propeller spinner (a combination known as a ''moteur-canon''). All later versions shared this feature. The '''12Ydrs''' was the next major series, with a basic rating of 836&nbsp;hp (623&nbsp;kW) at sea level with a [[compression ratio]] of 5.8:1.\n\nThe [[French Air Force|Arm\u00e9e de l'Air]] changed their nomenclature, so the next version was the '''Hispano-Suiza 12Y-21''', which increased the compression ratio to 7:1, when running on 100 [[octane]] [[Avgas|gasoline]]. This boosted power to 867&nbsp;hp (647 &nbsp;kW). In 1936 the connecting rod design was changed slightly to create the '''12Y-31''', but the lower 5.8:1 compression ratio was retained and the power was increased only slightly over the drs model to 850&nbsp;hp (630&nbsp;kW). Nevertheless, this became one of the most used engine designs of the pre-war era, used in almost all French fighter designs and prototypes.\n\n[[File:Moteur Hispano-Suiza 12 Ybrs DSC 0351.jpg|thumb|right|12 Ybrs showing valve gear]]\n\n===Late variants===\nA real effort to improve the performance of the engine in 1938 resulted in the '''Hispano-Suiza 12Y-45''', which used the S-39-H3 supercharger co-designed by Andr\u00e9 Planiol and [[Poland|Polish]] engineer [[Joseph Szydlowski]]. The Szydlowski-Planiol device was larger, but much more efficient than the indifferent Hispano-Suiza models. When used with 100 octane fuel, the supercharger boosted to the -21's 7:1, increasing power to 900&nbsp;hp (670&nbsp;kW). Combined with the Ratier [[constant-speed propeller]], this allowed the D.520 to perform as well as contemporary designs from Germany and England.\n\nAnother improvement in supercharging led to the '''Hispano-Suiza 12Y-49''', whose performance improved from 850&nbsp;hp (630&nbsp;kW) at sea level to 920&nbsp;hp (690&nbsp;kW) at just over 10,000&nbsp;ft (3,000&nbsp;m). This improvement in power with altitude was a common feature of most engines of the era, the result of the supercharger \"robbing\" power at low altitudes while not boosting the power due to the possibility of detonation.\n\nThe final major version was the 1,085&nbsp;hp (809&nbsp;kW) '''Hispano-Suiza 12Y-51''', which had just started into production at the time of the [[Armistice with France (Second Compi\u00e8gne)|Armistice with Germany]]. The -51 was the first version that came close to the performance limits of the engine, although the single-stage supercharging meant that it was unable to compete with designs from England and Germany above 15,000&nbsp;ft (5,000&nbsp;m).\n\n===Foreign derivatives===\nIn the early 1930s the [[Czechoslovakia]]n Republic gained rights to build a license version of the HS-12Y. This was produced by [[Avia]] ([[\u0160koda Auto|\u0160koda]]) at Prag - [[\u010cakovice]]. The engine was intended to become the standard powerplant of all Czech military aircraft. Both the HS-12Ycrs and HS-12Ydrs were built in quantity and were more commonly known by these names rather than any Czech designation. Aircraft powered by these engines included the [[Avia B-34]], [[Avia B-534]], [[Avia B-71]], [[Avia B-35]], [[Avia B-135]] and [[Rogo\u017earski IK-3]] .\n\nSwitzerland license built and assembled several different versions of the basic 12Ycrs for use in several aircraft: the reconnaissance biplane the [[EKW C-35]], the multipurpose [[EKW C-36]], the Swiss assembled [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406|D-3800]] copy of the French M.S. 406 fighter and Swiss built versions of the French M.S.412 fighter called the [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406|D.3801]]. [[Saurer]] developed the engine further after the Fall of France into the YS-2 and YS-3 engines.  These were used in more powerful follow-on versions of the same basic French fighter design, the [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406|M.S.450]] called the [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406|D.3802]] and then the final version called the [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406|D.3803]].\n\nIn the mid-1930s, [[Russia]]n engineer Vladimir Klimov was sent to France to obtain a license for local production of the 12Y. A series of design changes were added to cope with cold weather operation, and the engine entered production in 1935 as the [[Klimov M-100]] with about 750&nbsp;hp (560&nbsp;kW).<ref>Kotelnikov 2005, p. 136.</ref> However a series of continual upgrades increased the allowable RPM from the 12Y's fairly low 2,400 to 2,700, thereby increasing power to 1,100&nbsp;hp (820&nbsp;kW).

The 12Y became the primary French 1,000&nbsp;hp (750&nbsp;kW) class engine and was used in a number of famous aircraft, including the [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406]] and [[Dewoitine D.520]].\n\nIts design was based on the earlier and somewhat smaller, [[Hispano-Suiza 12X|12X]]. The 12X did not see widespread use before the 12Y replaced it and became one of the most powerful French designs on the eve of the war. The [[Hispano-Suiza 12Z|12Z]] was being designed but this was ended by the fall of France and the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation]].\n\nThe 12Y was produced under [[Hispano-Suiza]] licence in the Soviet Union as the '''Klimov M-100'''. This design led to the highly successful [[Klimov M-105|Klimov VK-105]] series that powered the [[Yak-1|Yakovlev]] and [[Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Gudkov LaGG-3|Lavochkin]] fighters as well as the [[Petlyakov Pe-2]] bomber. Licensed production of the early models was also undertaken in [[Czechoslovakia]] as the '''Avia HS 12Ydrs''' and in [[Switzerland]] as the HS-77.\n\n==Design and development==\n\n===Early development===\nThe 12Y was a fairly traditional in construction, a 36-litre [[Water cooling|water-cooled]] [[V12 engine|V-12]] with the two cast aluminium cylinder banks set at 60 degrees to each other. The [[cylinder head]]s were not removable, instead both [[cylinder bank]]s could be quickly removed from the [[crankcase]] section of the engine. This made it somewhat famous for being leak-proof, a design feature that was considered by other designers and almost became a part of the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]].\n\nThe major design change from the earlier 12X was to use a master-articulated [[connecting rod]] system, instead of the fork-and-blade type. A [[single overhead camshaft]] (SOHC) drove the [[Poppet valve|valves]], which were filled with liquid [[sodium]] for cooling. Only a single intake and exhaust valve were used, unlike most designs of the era which had moved to three or four valves per cylinder. A single-stage, single-speed [[supercharger]] was standard, although the art of designing a useful [[intake]] was not as well developed as in other countries, and high [[altitude]] performance was always lacking.\n\nThe first 12Y test articles were constructed in 1932, and almost immediately the entire French aviation industry started designing around it. At the time the engine developed only 760&nbsp;hp (570&nbsp;kW), but it was clear it had potential to the 1,000&nbsp;hp (750&nbsp;kW) class. An early modification led to the '''Hispano-Suiza 12Ycrs''' which used a hollow [[Driveshaft|propeller shaft]] to allow a [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|20 mm cannon]] to fire through the propeller spinner (a combination known as a ''moteur-canon''). All later versions shared this feature. The '''12Ydrs''' was the next major series, with a basic rating of 836&nbsp;hp (623&nbsp;kW) at sea level with a [[compression ratio]] of 5.8:1.\n\nThe [[French Air Force|Arm\u00e9e de l'Air]] changed their nomenclature, so the next version was the '''Hispano-Suiza 12Y-21''', which increased the compression ratio to 7:1, when running on 100 [[octane]] [[Avgas|gasoline]]. This boosted power to 867&nbsp;hp (647 &nbsp;kW). In 1936 the connecting rod design was changed slightly to create the '''12Y-31''', but the lower 5.8:1 compression ratio was retained and the power was increased only slightly over the drs model to 850&nbsp;hp (630&nbsp;kW). Nevertheless, this became one of the most used engine designs of the pre-war era, used in almost all French fighter designs and prototypes.\n\n[[File:Moteur Hispano-Suiza 12 Ybrs DSC 0351.jpg|thumb|right|12 Ybrs showing valve gear]]\n\n===Late variants===\nA real effort to improve the performance of the engine in 1938 resulted in the '''Hispano-Suiza 12Y-45''', which used the S-39-H3 supercharger co-designed by Andr\u00e9 Planiol and [[Poland|Polish]] engineer [[Joseph Szydlowski]]. The Szydlowski-Planiol device was larger, but much more efficient than the indifferent Hispano-Suiza models. When used with 100 octane fuel, the supercharger boosted to the -21's 7:1, increasing power to 900&nbsp;hp (670&nbsp;kW). Combined with the [[constant-speed]] Ratier propeller, this allowed the D.520 to perform as well as contemporary designs from Germany and England.\n\nAnother improvement in supercharging led to the '''Hispano-Suiza 12Y-49''', whose performance improved from 850&nbsp;hp (630&nbsp;kW) at sea level to 920&nbsp;hp (690&nbsp;kW) at just over 10,000&nbsp;ft (3,000&nbsp;m). This improvement in power with altitude was a common feature of most engines of the era, the result of the supercharger \"robbing\" power at low altitudes while not boosting the power due to the possibility of detonation.\n\nThe final major version was the 1,085&nbsp;hp (809&nbsp;kW) '''Hispano-Suiza 12Y-51''', which had just started into production at the time of the [[Armistice with France (Second Compi\u00e8gne)|Armistice with Germany]]. The -51 was the first version that came close to the performance limits of the engine, although the single-stage supercharging meant that it was unable to compete with designs from England and Germany above 15,000&nbsp;ft (5,000&nbsp;m).\n\n===Foreign derivatives===\nIn the early 1930s the [[Czechoslovakia]]n Republic gained rights to build a license version of the HS-12Y. This was produced by [[Avia]] ([[\u0160koda Auto|\u0160koda]]) at Prag - [[\u010cakovice]]. The engine was intended to become the standard powerplant of all Czech military aircraft. Both the HS-12Ycrs and HS-12Ydrs were built in quantity and were more commonly known by these names rather than any Czech designation. Aircraft powered by these engines included the [[Avia B-34]], [[Avia B-534]], [[Avia B-71]], [[Avia B-35]], [[Avia B-135]] and [[Rogo\u017earski IK-3]] .\n\nSwitzerland license built and assembled several different versions of the basic 12Ycrs for use in several aircraft: the reconnaissance biplane the [[EKW C-35]], the multipurpose [[EKW C-36]], the Swiss assembled [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406|D-3800]] copy of the French M.S. 406 fighter and Swiss built versions of the French M.S.412 fighter called the [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406|D.3801]]. [[Saurer]] developed the engine further after the Fall of France into the YS-2 and YS-3 engines.  These were used in more powerful follow-on versions of the same basic French fighter design, the [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406|M.S.450]] called the [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406|D.3802]] and then the final version called the [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406|D.3803]].\n\nIn the mid-1930s, [[Russia]]n engineer Vladimir Klimov was sent to France to obtain a license for local production of the 12Y. A series of design changes were added to cope with cold weather operation, and the engine entered production in 1935 as the [[Klimov M-100]] with about 750&nbsp;hp (560&nbsp;kW).<ref>Kotelnikov 2005, p. 136.</ref> However a series of continual upgrades increased the allowable RPM from the 12Y's fairly low 2,400 to 2,700, thereby increasing power to 1,100&nbsp;hp (820&nbsp;kW). The resulting design, the '''[[Klimov M-105]] (VK-105)''' became one of the major Soviet engine designs during the war, powering all [[Yakovlev]] fighters.\n\n==Variants==\nTabulated data from Lage 2004<ref name=Lage>Lage, 2004, pp.486\u20137</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Type 73 Hispano 12Y engines.

A double bond exist between the R'N and the carbon centre.  These compounds are analogues of [[acyl chloride]]. Imidoyl chlorides tend to be highly reactive and are more commonly found as intermediates in a wide variety of synthetic procedures. Such procedures include [[Gattermann aldehyde synthesis]], Houben-Hoesch ketone synthesis, and the [[Beckmann rearrangement]]. Their chemistry is related to that of enamines and their [[tautomers]] when the \u03b1 hydrogen is next to the C=N bond.<ref name=\"Ulrich\">Ulrich, H.

The structure of the carboxylic acid amides plays a role in the outcome of the synthesis. Imidoyl chloride can be prepared by treating a monosubstituted carboxylic acid amide with [[phosgene]].<ref name=\"Ulrich\" />\n:RC(O)NHR\u2019  +  COCl<sub>2</sub>   \u2192   RC(NR\u2019)Cl  +  HCl  +  CO<sub>2</sub>\nThionyl chloride is also used.<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.15227/orgsyn.031.0048|title = N,N'-Diphenylbenzamidine|journal = Organic Syntheses|year = 1951|volume = 31|pages = 48|author=Arthur C.

Most of these syntheses involve replacing the chloride with alcohols, thiols, amines, and cyanates, respectively.<ref name=\"Ulrich\" /> Imidoyl chlorides can also undergo [[Friedel-Crafts reaction]]s to install an imine groups on aromatic substrates. If the nitrogen of the imidoyl chloride has two substituents, the resulting chloroiminium ion is vulnerable to attack by aromatic rings without the need for a Lewis acid to remove the chloride first. This reaction is called the [[Vilsmeier\u2013Haack reaction]], and the chloroiminium ion is referred to as the Vilsmeier reagent.<ref>{{cite journal|authorlink=Anton Vilsmeier|last1=Vilsmeier|first1=Anton|last2=Haack|first2=Albrecht|title=\u00dcber die Einwirkung von Halogenphosphor auf Alkyl-formanilide.

The Vilsmeier-Haack reaction can be a useful technique to add functional groups to an aromatic ring if the ring contains electron-withdrawing groups, which make using the alternative Friedel-Crafts reaction difficult.\n\nImidoyl chlorides can be easily halogenated at the \u03b1 carbon position.<ref name=\"Ulrich\" /> By treating imidoyl chlorides with hydrogen halide, will cause all \u03b1 hydrogens to be replaced with the halide. This method can be an effective way to halogenate many substances. Imidoyl chlorides can also be used to form peptide bonds by first creating amidines and then allowing them to be hydrolyzed to the amide. This approach may prove to be a useful route to synthesizing synthetic proteins.<ref name=\"Ulrich\" />\n\nImidoyl chlorides can be difficult to handle. Imidoyl chlorides react readily with water, which makes any attempt to isolate and store them for long periods of time difficult. Further, imidoyl chlorides tend to undergo self-condensation at higher temperatures if the imidoyl chloride has an \u03b1 CH group. At even higher temperatures, the chlorine of the imidoyl chloride tends to be eliminated, leaving the nitrile. Because of these complications, imidoyl chlorides are typically prepared and used immediately. More stable intermediates are being sought, with substances such as imidoylbenzotriazoles being suggested.<ref>Katritzky, A. R.; Stevens, C. V.; Zhang, G.-F.; Jiang, J.; Kimpe, N. D.

Imidoyl chlorides tend to be highly reactive and are more commonly found as intermediates in a wide variety of synthetic procedures. Such procedures include Gattermann aldehyde synthesis, Houben-Hoesch ketone synthesis, and the Beckmann rearrangement. Their chemistry is related to that of enamines and their [[tautomers]] when the \u03b1 hydrogen is next to the C=N bond.<ref name=\"Ulrich\">Ulrich, H. The Chemistry of Imidoyl Halides; Plenum Press: New York, 1968; pp. 55\u2013112.</ref>  Many chlorinated N-[[heterocycle]]s are formally imidoyl chlorides, e.g. [[2-Chloropyridine|2-chloropyridine]], 2, 4, and 6-chloro[[pyrimidine]]s.\n\n== Synthesis and properties==\nImidoyl halides are synthesized by combining amides and halogenating agents.  The structure of the carboxylic acid amides plays a role in the outcome of the synthesis. Imidoyl chloride can be prepared by treating a monosubstituted carboxylic acid amide with [[phosgene]].<ref name=\"Ulrich\" />\n:RC(O)NHR\u2019  +  COCl<sub>2</sub>   \u2192   RC(NR\u2019)Cl  +  HCl  +  CO<sub>2</sub>\nThionyl chloride is also used.<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.15227/orgsyn.031.0048|title = N,N'-Diphenylbenzamidine|journal = Organic Syntheses|year = 1951|volume = 31|pages = 48|author=Arthur C. Hontz, E. C. Wagner}}</ref>\n\nImidoyl chlorides are generally colorless liquids or low-melting solids that are sensitive to both heat and especially moisture. In their [[Infrared spectroscopy|IR spectra]] these compounds exhibit a  characteristic \u03bd<sub>C=N</sub> band near 1650\u20131689&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>. Although both the syn and anti configurations are possible, most imidoyl chlorides adopt the anti configuration.<ref name=\"Ulrich\" />\n[[File:YUXJIK.png|thumb|right|Structure of the imidoyl chloride C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>N=C(Cl)C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>-4-Me (color code:yellow = F, green = Cl; violet=N)<ref>{{cite journal|authors=T.

(Russ.Chem.Bull.)|year=1993|page=1605}}</ref>]]\n\n== Reactivity ==\nImidoyl chlorides react readily with water, hydrogen sulfide, amines, and hydrogen halides. Treating imidoyl chlorides with water forms the corresponding amide:\n\n:RC(NR\u2019)Cl  +  H<sub>2</sub>O   \u2192   RCONHR\u2019  +  HCl\n\nAliphatic imidoyl chlorides are more sensitive toward [[hydrolysis]] than aryl derivatives. Electron-withdrawing substituents decrease the reaction rate.  Imidoyl chlorides react with [[hydrogen sulfide]] to produce [[thioamide]]s:<ref name=\"Ulrich\" />\n:RC(NR\u2019)Cl  +  H<sub>2</sub>S   \u2192   RC(S)NHR\u2019  +  HCl\n\nWhen amines are treated with imidoyl chlorides, [[amidines]] are obtained.<ref name=\"Ulrich\" />\n\n:RC(NR\u2019)Cl  +  2R\u201dNH<sub>2</sub>   \u2192   RC(NR\u2019)NHR\u201d  +  R\u201dNH<sub>3</sub>Cl\nWhen R' \u2260 R\", two isomers are possible.\n\nUpon heating, imidoyl chlorides also undergo [[dehydrohalogenation]] to form nitriles:<ref name=\"Ulrich\" />\n\n:RC(NR\u2019)Cl   \u2192   RC\u2261N  +  R\u2019Cl\n\nTreatment of imidoyl chloride with hydrogen halides, such as HCl, forms the corresponding iminium chloride cations:<ref name=\"Ulrich\" />\n\n:RC(NR\u2019)Cl  +  HCl   \u2192   [RC(NHR\u2019)Cl]<sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>\n\n== Applications ==\nImidoyl chlorides are useful intermediates in the syntheses of several compounds, including imidates, thioimidates, amidines, and imidoyl cyanides. Most of these syntheses involve replacing the chloride with alcohols, thiols, amines, and cyanates, respectively.<ref name=\"Ulrich\" /> Imidoyl chlorides can also undergo [[Friedel-Crafts reaction]]s to install an imine groups on aromatic substrates. If the nitrogen of the imidoyl chloride has two substituents, the resulting chloroiminium ion is vulnerable to attack by aromatic rings without the need for a Lewis acid to remove the chloride first. This reaction is called the [[Vilsmeier\u2013Haack reaction]], and the chloroiminium ion is referred to as the Vilsmeier reagent.<ref>{{cite journal|authorlink=Anton Vilsmeier|last1=Vilsmeier|first1=Anton|last2=Haack|first2=Albrecht|title=\u00dcber die Einwirkung von Halogenphosphor auf Alkyl-formanilide.

The Vilsmeier-Haack reaction can be a useful technique to add functional groups to an aromatic ring if the ring contains electron-withdrawing groups, which make using the alternative Friedel-Crafts reaction difficult.\n\nImidoyl chlorides can be easily halogenated at the \u03b1 carbon position.<ref name=\"Ulrich\" /> By treating imidoyl chlorides with hydrogen halide, will cause all \u03b1 hydrogens to be replaced with the halide. This method can be an effective way to halogenate many substances. Imidoyl chlorides can also be used to form peptide bonds by first creating amidines and then allowing them to be hydrolyzed to the amide. This approach may prove to be a useful route to synthesizing synthetic proteins.<ref name=\"Ulrich\" />\n\nImidoyl chlorides can be difficult to handle. Imidoyl chlorides react readily with water, which makes any attempt to isolate and store them for long periods of time difficult. Further, imidoyl chlorides tend to undergo self-condensation at higher temperatures if the imidoyl chloride has an \u03b1 CH group. At even higher temperatures, the chlorine of the imidoyl chloride tends to be eliminated, leaving the nitrile. Because of these complications, imidoyl chlorides are typically prepared and used immediately. More stable intermediates are being sought, with substances such as imidoylbenzotriazoles being suggested.<ref>Katritzky, A. R.; Stevens, C. V.; Zhang, G.-F.; Jiang, J.; Kimpe, N. D.

As the competition accelerated, Bo and Steve got in a knife fight which ended with Steve losing his eye.\n\nThey split up and Steve returned to Salem to work for [[Victor Kiriakis]]. He was deployed to get a piece of film from [[Kimberly Brady]], but the film found its way to [[Melissa Horton|Melissa]] and Pete Jannings who promptly went on the run when they figured out how dangerous it was. [[Bo and Hope Brady]] went off in pursuit, sure that the film would give them the evidence they needed to convict Kiriakis for his crimes. Although Victor and Steve were both arrested, they managed to get free thanks to Victor's blackmailing Larry Welch to taking the blame.\n\nSteve's next project went even worse. He held a mysterious man covered in bandages and planned to sell him to Victor. The plan fell through when the man escaped. Things got even uglier for him when Britta walked back into his life. Although they began seeing each other, she wound up injured after someone tried to shoot him and shot her in the crossfire. Once she recovered, she walked out. This left him with the chance to meet and fall in love with [[Kayla Brady]]. After they hooked up, he began having disturbing memories and became increasingly distant from her. He soon found himself enmeshed in a host of problems. After he discovered that his sister\u2014[[Adrienne Johnson Kiriakis|Adrienne]]\u2014killed their father in self-defense, he decided to shield her and take the blame. All the while she had blocked the incident from her mind, but as the memories returned, she confessed just before he could be sentenced for the crime.\n\nNext, Steve got mixed up with [[Harper Deveraux]], helping him to fake his death so that he could escape while battling with Steve's old boss Victor. Learning of the plot, Victor had the blanks in Steve's gun changed for live ones and Harper ended up in a coma after being shot by Steve. Grabbing Kayla, Steve went on the run only to be cleared of the charges while he was away.\n\nWhen he returned to Salem with Kayla, things would take an unexpected turn. He and his sister had recently discovered that [[Jack Deveraux]] was their long lost brother. Because Jack was dying at the time they didn't bother him with this fact. At the same time, Kayla became Jack's nurse and he fell madly in love with her. Seeing this, Steve started to push her away so that she could spend her time with Jack and make him happy. This proved effective and Jack married Kayla, but the plan quickly collapsed after that. Steve had discovered that Harper was poisoning Kayla so he kidnapped her to save her life. Although she was already ill, she refused to believe him and ran. This was enough to spark things up between them, however, and they began an affair which they tried to shield from Jack. The affair was publicly exposed in the newspaper. Jack was crushed, raped Kayla and had Steve beaten. Steve went after him and wound up pushing him off a roof. The fall resulted in severe injuries and Jack needed a kidney transplant to live. Since Steve, as his brother, was a match, he agreed to give up a kidney for him, though only at his mother's prompting.\n\nThe nightmare wasn't over for Kayla though. Harper was on the loose and he kidnapped her and Kimberly when they realized that he was the Riverfront Knifer. Steve saved them, but Kayla was injured in the fallout and suffered from deafness and loss of speech. After a successful surgery, she could hear again and Steve asked her to marry him. They did and her speech returned just in time for her to say 'I do.' The happy couple went off to the Orient for their honeymoon. There they encountered a deaf boy named [[Benjy Hawk|Benjy]]. They returned to Salem with the child but his mother soon came after them. She told them that his father was a nasty man but let them look out for him, hoping that they could protect him. She was found dead soon after. The mysterious father turned out to be the nefarious [[Stefano DiMera]] but, to ease their burden, Benjy's grandfather, Orion, arrived to take him away to live in secrecy.\n\nDanger ended up coming at Steve and Kayla from another source soon after. Harper had escaped prison and kidnapped her once again, but Steve managed to save her and put Harper back in prison.\n\nThe next year, Steve became mixed up with [[Nick Corelli]] after he found his severely burned body. Steve hid Nick while he recovered and had to bring Kayla into the fold to help out. When Nick was sufficiently recovered, he left them but his bad luck followed him. Steve would have to come to his rescue when he needed help trying to get rid of Eddie who was trying to steal his secret fortune. When Eddie was shot in a standoff, Nick gave Steve and Kayla his mansion as a token of his thanks.\n\nLater that year, Steve joined the [[ISA (Days of our Lives)|ISA]] and was sent to track an arsonist who had been torching black churches in the south. His investigation brought him to [[Saul Taylor]]'s revivalist camp, which just happened to be set up right outside Salem. After undergoing some facial surgery and getting a glass eye, he infiltrated the group under the alias of Brother Daniel Lucas. He soon discovered that Taylor was using the camp as a front for stolen goods and that he was behind many of the bombings which included an explosion that killed his best friend's parents. The investigation ended when Taylor's partner shot him and then went off a cliff during a fight.\n\nReturning to focus his attention on Kayla, Steve found that she was expecting a child. Their happiness was complicated by the arrival of [[Marina Toscano]], who claimed to be Steve's wife. While he had indeed married her, he had thought her long since dead, confessing to Kayla that he believed that he'd killed her during a seaboard fight. Marina made it clear that she didn't want Steve back, she just needed his help getting a key that they'd thrown into the sea. Hoping for a quick divorce, he agreed to help her and went to Italy to get the key. While there, he had to fight off Kiriakis' henchmen when they tried to get the key from him. The fight left him with a broken glass eye. Meanwhile, in Salem, Kayla had had enough of Marina putting her husband and family in danger and the pair got in a fight. Later, Marina turned up dead and Kayla became a key suspect. To make things worse, Kiriakis kidnapped her in a bid to get the key. She was released when [[Isabella Black|Isabella]] gave the key to Victor. The couple then rushed to get married before she gave birth and she was arrested for Marina's murder during the wedding. Kayla stood trial, thanks largely to doctored evidence that Kiriakis had sent to [[John Black (Days of our Lives)|John Black]]. She was convicted and gave Steve their newborn daughter, [[Stephanie Johnson (Days of Our Lives)|Stephanie]], to raise. He hired a nanny, Kelly Parker, who, unfortunately, turned out to be quite crazy and kidnapped the child when Kayla escaped from prison. Steve and Kayla went in pursuit of her, tracking her to Australia where they were lucky enough to find Bo and Hope who helped them track her down. After getting Stephanie back, they had the additional good news that Kayla had been cleared of the murder conviction and they all returned to Salem.\n\nUnfortunately, Harper Devereaux wasn't finished with the couple and escaped from prison once again for revenge. Harper tried to shoot Steve while he and Kayla were married, but his son, Jack, learning of the plot, stopped him and pushed him from the bell tower from which he took aim. After he plummeted to his death, the wedding continued. Now Steve decided to turn over another leaf in his life and become a police officer. While out on patrol one night, he investigated a boat where he discovered a card from [[Lawrence Alamain]]. The boat then promptly blew up and left him severely injured. He went into a coma but recovered. Fearing what he knew, Lawrence had Steve's [[intravenous|IV]] poisoned. When Steve died, Lawrence then had his casket switched before it could be buried and rushed Steve's body off.\n\n===2006\u201309===\nSixteen years later, Steve reappeared suffering from severe amnesia and calling himself Nick. He was discovered by Jack, who took him back to Salem, shocking Kayla by showing up at [[Jennifer Horton]] and [[Frankie Brady|Frankie]]'s wedding. He had no idea who she was, but she tried her best to make him remember. After the pair was attacked by a lethal [[bioweapon|biological agent]], they recuperated in the hospital but her recovery was complicated by a reaction to the antidote. Steve faked his memories in a bid to help Kayla recover, giving her the confidence to get better. She soon realized that he'd been faking and distanced herself from him. From then on, he tried hard to take back the life that he'd lost and get her back. It took a lot of effort to convince her that he was his old self again, but they eventually reunited.\n\nThe reunion was far from smooth, however. In Steve's absence from Salem, he was held by the DiMera's who tortured and brainwashed him into being one of their soldiers. As Steve began to realize this, he tried to resist and to kill the man who was controlling him: Stefano's son, [[EJ DiMera]]. This has proved difficult and EJ managed to force Steve into kidnapping John Black\u2014so that he could steal his kidney\u2014and in committing other illegal acts. Steve began pushing Kayla away to protect her and went in and out of mental hospitals where he was still at the mercy of EJ and his agents.\n\nLater, Steve helped [[Hope Brady]] get out of the DiMera house by telling [[Stefano DiMera]] that they were having an affair.  Stefano believed it and let Steve and Hope leave.  Steve has been involved in helping end the vendetta including assisting in faking Stefano's death, but when Andre killed Benjy, Steve lost control.  He kidnapped Stefano and demanded Andre bring Roman Brady\u2014who Andre had kidnapped\u2014to the television stations where he was holding Stefano.  Andre did as Steve said and released Roman.  Realizing Steve was out of his mind with grief, Stefano dropped all charges against Steve for the kidnapping, doing so to honor Benjy's memory.\n\nSteve was then kidnapped by his old lover [[Ava Vitali]]. Steve and Kayla's baby boy, named Joe, was born prematurely. After Kayla survived being accidentally shot by Hope, she and Steve quietly left town.\n\nAs of 2014, Steve has rejoined the ISA as an undercover agent, and Kayla has returned to Salem where she serves as a doctor.  They are currently estranged.\n\n===2015\u201318===\nIn August 2015, Steve abruptly returned to Salem after Joey (now a teenager) showed up on his doorstep, having run away from his boarding school.  He resigned from the ISA, rescued Bo from the clutches of an as-yet-unknown group who had captured and tortured Bo as a means of trying to find the secrets behind Dr. Salinas's miracle drug, and returned him to Salem in time to save Hope from a murderous Aiden Jennings.  He is currently attempting to heal his relationship with Kayla and his family, and has entered into a partnership with John Black, another ex-ISA agent, to start a new private investigation business, tentatively called \"Black Patch\".\n\n\n{{Days of Our Lives}}\n{{Days of Our Lives characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Johnson, Steve (Days Of Our Lives)}}\n[[Category:Days of Our Lives characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional private investigators]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1985]]\n[[Category:Fictional victims of brainwashing and indoctrination]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=February 2007}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Steve Johnson (''Days of Our Lives'')}}\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Steve Johnson\n| series         = Days of Our Lives\n| portrayer      = [[Stephen Nichols]]\n| first          = {{Start date|1985|06|13}}\n| last           = \n| creator        = [[Sheri Anderson]], [[Thom Racina]] and [[Leah Laiman]]\n| introducer = {{Plainlist |\n*[[Betty Corday]] and [[Al Rabin]] (1985)\n*[[Ken Corday]] and Stephen Wyman (2006)\n* Ken Corday, [[Albert Alarr]] and Greg Meng (2015)\n}}\n| classification = [[List of Days of Our Lives cast members|Present; regular]]\n| image1         = Stephen Nichols as Patch.jpg\n| caption1       = \n| nicknames      = Patch\n| alias          = Steven Earl Johnson <br> [[Stefano DiMera]] (2019\u2013)\n| years          = {{Flatlist |\n* 1985\u201390 \n* 2006\u201309\n* 2015\u2013present\n}}\n| occupation     = [[Private Investigator]]<br>[[ISA (Days of Our Lives)|ISA Agent]]<br>[[Police officer]]<br>[[Merchant navy|Merchant Marine]]<br>[[Delivery (commerce)|Deliveryman]] \n| residence = [[Salem (Days of Our Lives)|Salem]], [[Illinois]] <!-- 110 Guilford Street Apt# 36 Salem, USA-->\n| family         = [[Johnson family|Johnson]]\n| parents        = Duke Johnson <br>Jo Johnson\n| uncles         = Earl Duke Johnson\n| brothers= [[Jack Deveraux]]\n| sisters=[[Adrienne Johnson Kiriakis]]\n| spouse         = {{Plainlist|\n* Marina Toscano (until 1989) \n*[[Kayla Brady]] (1988\u20131989, 1990\u20132012, 2017\u2013present)\n}}\n| sons          = {{ubl|[[Days of Our Lives characters (2010s)#Tripp Dalton|Tripp Dalton]]|[[Joey Johnson (Days of Our Lives)|Joey Johnson]]}}\n| daughters     = [[Stephanie Johnson (Days of Our Lives)|Stephanie Johnson]]\n| nieces/nephews = [[Abigail Deveraux]]<br />[[JJ Deveraux]]<br />Victor Kiriakis II (adoptive)<br />Joseph Kiriakis (adoptive)<br />[[Sonny Kiriakis]]\n}}\n\n'''Steve''' \"'''Patch'''\" '''Johnson''' is a [[fictional character]] on [[NBC]]'s daytime drama, ''[[Days of Our Lives]]''.
