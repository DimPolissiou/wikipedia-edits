It is a typical example of [[mixed farming]] which has been passed down the generations from Dan, the original farmer, to his son Phil and is now co-owned by Phil and Jill's four children: David, who manages it with his wife Ruth; Shula Hebden-Lloyd, owner of the riding stables, was married to  Alistair, a vet; her twin Kenton, runs the village's only pub with his wife Jolene; and the widowed Elizabeth Pargeter. Jill lives in Brookfield with her son David, his wife Ruth and their children Pip, Josh, and Ben.\n* The [[List of The Archers characters#The Aldridge family|Aldridges]] at [[Home farm (agriculture)|Home Farm]]. Brian, who is portrayed as a money-driven [[agribusiness]]man and his wife Jennifer. They have five children: the two Jennifer brought into their marriage: Adam, a farmer married to chef Ian Craig and Debbie a farmer based in Hungary; two born into the marriage, Kate with a family abandoned in South Africa, and Alice married to farrier Chris Carter; and schoolboy Ruairi, Brian's son by one of his affairs. The family also includes Kate's daughter Phoebe and Jennifer's sister Lilian.\n* The Bridge Farm [[List of The Archers characters#The Archer family|Archers]] practise [[organic farming]]. Their operations include a farm shop, a farm caf\u00e9, a [[vegetable box scheme]] and a dairy. Tony and Pat's children are Helen and Tom, and their three grandchildren: Johnny, who is the son of their dead son John; and Henry and Jack.\n* The [[List of The Archers characters#The Pargetter family|Pargetters]], a [[landed gentry]] family who have to make their [[stately home]], Lower Loxley Hall, pay the bills as a public attraction. The family includes Nigel Pargetter's widow, Elizabeth {{n\u00e9e}} Archer, her son Freddie and his twin sister Lily.\n* The [[Joe Grundy|Grundys]], formerly struggling [[tenant farmer]]s who were brought to prominence in the late 1970s and early 1980s as comic characters, but are now seen as doggedly battling adversity.\n* The [[List of The Archers characters#The Carter family|Carters]], Neil and Susan. Their son, Chris, is married to Alice Aldridge; their daughter, Emma, has successively married brothers, Will and Edward Grundy.\n* The [[List of The Archers characters#Lynda Snell|Snells]], Lynda, married to the long-suffering Robert, is the butt of many jokes, although her sheer energy makes her a stalwart of village life.\n\n==Ambridge==\n{{See also|List of fictional towns and villages}}\n* ''Arkwright Hall'' is a large Victorian mansion with a 17th-century atmosphere. The building served as a community centre for many years, containing a soundproofed room and field studies centre. Later it fell into disrepair, but was renovated when Jack Woolley leased the mansion to the [[Landmark Trust]]; architect Lewis Carmichael led the restoration of the building to its [[Victorian era|Victorian]] splendour.\n* ''Bridge Farm'' is a {{Convert|168|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm previously on Berrow Estate, but now owned by Pat and Tony Archer. The farm became wholly dedicated to [[organic farming]] in 1984, in a storyline inspired by a scriptwriter's visit to Brynllys farm in [[Ceredigion]], the home of [[Rachel's Organic]].<ref name=Times6847838>{{cite news | title=The Soil Association | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article6847838.ece | work=The Times | location=London | date=25 September 2009| accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> In 2003, Tom Archer began producing his Bridge Farm pork sausages. In early 2013, the family decided to sell their dairy herd and buy organic milk instead and the following year, Tony Archer bought a small [[Angus cattle|Aberdeen Angus]] herd.\n* ''Brookfield Farm'' is a {{Convert|469|acre|ha|adj=on}} mixed farm which was managed by Dan Archer and then by his son Phil. After Phil's retirement in 2001, his son David Archer took over.\n* ''Grange Farm'' was a working farm run by the Grundys until their eviction in 2000. The farmhouse, along with {{Convert|50|acre|ha|}} of land, was sold to Oliver Sterling, who then began \"hobby farming\". He took young Ed Grundy on as cow man and later gave him full responsibility for running the farm.\n* ''Grey Gables'', once a country club, is now a luxurious hotel. The late Caroline Sterling bought it with her husband Oliver Sterling. The hotel boasts a pool, spa, health club and a golf course. Ian Craig is the executive chef.\n* ''Home Farm'' is a {{Convert|1922|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm, by far the largest in Ambridge. In recent years, Home Farm expanded into soft fruit and deer farming.\n* ''Lower Loxley Hall'' is a large 300-year-old country house located just outside Ambridge. It serves primarily as a conference centre. \n* ''The Bull'', the village's only [[Public house|pub]], is perhaps the most recognisable structure in Ambridge\n* ''St. Stephen's Church'', established in 1281, dates back to [[Normans|Norman]] times. The church has undergone many changes over the years, including a number of different vicars. The eight bells are rung by a group led by Neil Carter.\n* Ambridge still has a ''[[Village shop#United Kingdom|village shop and post office]]'', originally thanks to Jack Woolley's philanthropy. The business is now a community shop managed by Susan and run by a team of volunteers.\n* ''Willow Farm'' is owned by the Tucker family. After Betty's death in 2005, the house was divided to accommodate Roy and his family. The [[Agricultural land|farmland]] is home to Neil Carter's pigs.\n\n==Topicality==\nUnlike some soap operas, episodes of ''The Archers'' portray events taking place on the date of broadcast, allowing many topical subjects to be included. Real-life events which can be readily predicted in advance are often written into the script, such as the annual [[Oxford Farming Conference]]<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/backstage/oxford_conference.shtml | title= Oxford Farming Conference | accessdate= 17 February 2008 | publisher= BBC Radio 4 | date= 3 January 2008 | url-status= dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080628092518/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/backstage/oxford_conference.shtml | archivedate= 28 June 2008 }}</ref> and the [[FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{cite episode|title= {{date|2006-06-27}}|series= The Archers |network= BBC Radio 4 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/archive_synopsis.shtml?week=20060625&day=2 }}</ref> On some occasions, scenes recorded at these events are planned and edited into episodes shortly before transmission.\n\nMore challengingly for the production team, some significant but unforeseen events require scenes to be rewritten and rerecorded at short notice, such as the death of [[Princess Margaret]] (particularly poignant because she had appeared as herself on the programme),<ref name=\"princess margaret\">{{cite web | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/backstage/princess_margaret.shtml | title= Princess Margaret Remembered | accessdate=17 February 2008| date=10 February 2002 | publisher= BBC Radio 4}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode|title= {{date|2002-02-10}}|series= The Archers |network= BBC Radio 4 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/archive_synopsis.shtml?week=20020210&day=0 }}</ref> the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|World Trade Center attacks]],<ref>{{cite episode|title= {{date|2001-09-12}}|series= The Archers |network= BBC Radio 4 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/archive_synopsis.shtml?week=20010909&day=3 }}</ref> and the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]].<ref>{{cite episode|title= {{date|2005-07-11}}|series= The Archers |network= BBC Radio 4 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/archive_synopsis.shtml?week=20050710&day=1 }}</ref> The events and implications of the [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth crisis|2001 foot-and-mouth crisis]] required many \"topical inserts\"<ref>{{cite episode|title= {{date|2001-02-22}}|series= The Archers |network= BBC Radio 4 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/archive_synopsis.shtml?week=20010218&day=4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite episode|title= {{date|2001-02-23}}|series= The Archers |network= BBC Radio 4 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/archive_synopsis.shtml?week=20010218&day=5 }}</ref><ref>{{cite episode|title= {{date|2001-02-27}}|series= The Archers |network= BBC Radio 4 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/archive_synopsis.shtml?week=20010225&day=2 }}</ref><ref>{{cite episode|title= {{date|2001-03-01}}|series= The Archers |network= BBC Radio 4 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/archive_synopsis.shtml?week=20010225&day=4 }}</ref> and the rewriting of several storylines.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/backstage/drama_in_a_crisis.shtml | title= Drama in a Crisis | accessdate=17 February 2008| publisher=BBC Radio 4| date=2 March 2001}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2012, Oliver Sterling, owner of Grange Farm, together with his tenant, Ed Grundy, elected to vaccinate the badgers on their farm in an attempt to prevent the spread of bovine [[tuberculosis]].

By the nature of the storylines concentrating on particular groups of characters, in any one week out of a cast of about 60, the episodes include approximately 20{{ndash}}30 speaking-characters. Most of the cast do acting work on other projects and can disappear for long periods if they are working on commitments such as films or television series. [[Tamsin Greig]] plays Debbie Aldridge and has appeared on many television series such as ''[[Green Wing]]'', ''[[Love Soup]]'', ''[[Black Books]]'' and ''[[Episodes (TV series)|Episodes]]'', so Debbie manages a farm in [[Hungary]] and her visits to Ambridge are infrequent.

Recordings were sent to London, and the BBC decided to commission the series for a longer national run. In the five pilots the Archers owned Wimberton Farm, rather than Brookfield. Baseley subsequently edited ''The Archers'' for 22 years.\n\nSince 1 January 1951, five 15-minute episodes (since 1998, six 12\u00bd-minute episodes) have been transmitted each week, at first on the [[BBC Light Programme]]<ref name=\"Donovan, Paul 1991 p. 8\">Donovan, Paul (1991), ''The Radio Companion''. London: Grafton; p. 8.</ref> and subsequently on the [[BBC Home Service]] (now [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]]). Early afternoon repeats of the previous evening's episode began on 14 December 1964. The original scriptwriters were Geoffrey Webb and [[Edward J. Mason]], who were also working on the nightly thriller series about the special agent Dick Barton. The popularity of his adventures partly inspired ''The Archers'', which eventually took over Barton's evening slot. At first, however, the national launch placed the serial at the 'terrible'<ref>Smethurst, William (1996), ''The Archers: The True Story''.

An omnibus edition of the week's episodes began on Saturday, 5 January 1952.\n\nOriginally produced with collaborative input from the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]], ''The Archers'' was conceived as a means of disseminating information to farmers and smallholders to help increase productivity in the [[Postwar]] era of [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|rationing]] and food shortages.<ref name=\"Donovan, Paul 1991 p. 8\"/>\n\n''The Archers'' originally centred on the lives of three farmers; Dan Archer, farming efficiently with little cash, Walter Gabriel, farming inefficiently with little cash, and George Fairbrother, a wealthy businessman farming at a loss for tax purposes (which one could do in those days).<ref>Norman Painting, ''Forever Ambridge'' (1975)</ref> The programme was hugely successful, winning the National Radio Awards' 'Most entertaining programme of the Year' award jointly with ''[[Take It from Here]]'' in 1954, and winning the award outright in 1955, in which year the audience was reported to have peaked at 20 million.<ref name=\"The Listener 29 August 1985\">''The Listener'', 29 August 1985.</ref>\n\nAt the late 1950s, despite the growth of television and radio's consequent decline, the programme was still claiming eleven million listeners and was also being transmitted in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.<ref>Smethurst, William (1996), ''The Archers: The True Story''.

Phil and Grace Archer had been married just a few months earlier, and their blossoming relationship was the talk of the nation. However, searching for a story which would demonstrate some real tragedy among the increasingly unconvincing episode cliff-hangers, Godfrey Baseley had decided that Grace would have to die. The scripts for the week commencing 19 September 1955 were written, recorded, and broadcast on each day, with an \"exercise in topicality\" given as the explanation to the cast. On Thursday, listeners heard the [[sound effect]]s of Grace trying to rescue ''Midnight'', her horse, from a fire in the stable at Brookfield and the crash of a falling [[Beam (structure)|timber beam]].<ref name=\"ep10000\">{{cite episode|title= {{date|1989-05-26}}|number= 10,000|series= The Archers |network= BBC Radio 4 }}</ref>\n\nWhether the timing of the episode was a deliberate attempt to overshadow the opening night of the BBC's first commercial rival has been debated ever since. It was certainly planned some months in advance, but it may well be that the actual date of the death was changed during the scriptwriting stage to coincide with [[History of ITV|the launch of Associated-Rediffusion]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Smethurst |title = The Archers| year = 1996 |publisher= |location= | isbn = | page = 63 |chapter = Dead Girls Tell No Tales |quote = Even this presupposes that the BBC realized the impact that the 'death' would have&nbsp;\u2014 and all the evidence is that the BBC was totally taken by surprise.}}</ref> Deliberate or not, the episode attracted widespread media attention, being reported by newspapers around the world.\n\nThis controversy has been parodied twice: in \"[[The Bowmans (Hancock)|The Bowmans]]\", an episode of the television comedy programme ''Hancock'', and in the play ''[[The Killing of Sister George]]'' and [[The Killing of Sister George (film)|its 1968 film adaptation]]. On the 50th anniversary of ITV's launch, [[Ysanne Churchman]], who played Grace, sent them a congratulatory card signed \"Grace Archer\".\n\nIn 1996, William Smethurst recounted a conversation with Baseley in which he reveals his real motivation for killing off Grace Archer: Churchman was encouraging the other actors to join a trade union.<ref>{{cite book |author=Smethurst |title = The Archers |year = 1996 |publisher = |location = |isbn =|page = 64 |chapter = Dead Girls Tell No Tales |quote='She was trying to get the actors to join a trade union,' he told the author of this book, in 1995, 'so I killed her off.

All except the Friday evening episode are repeated the following day at 14:02. The six episodes are re-run unabridged in the Sunday morning [[omnibus (broadcast)|omnibus]] at 10:00.

It is a typical example of [[mixed farming]] which has been passed down the generations from Dan, the original farmer, to his son Phil and is now co-owned by Phil and Jill's four children: David, who manages it with his wife Ruth; Shula Hebden-Lloyd, owner of the riding stables, was married to  Alistair, a vet; her twin Kenton, runs the village's only pub with his wife Jolene; and the widowed Elizabeth Pargeter. Jill lives in Brookfield with her son David, his wife Ruth and their children Pip, Josh, and Ben.\n* The [[List of The Archers characters#The Aldridge family|Aldridges]] at [[Home farm (agriculture)|Home Farm]]. Brian, who is portrayed as a money-driven [[agribusiness]]man and his wife Jennifer. They have five children: the two Jennifer brought into their marriage: Adam, a farmer married to chef Ian Craig and Debbie a farmer based in Hungary; two born into the marriage, Kate with a family abandoned in South Africa, and Alice married to farrier Chris Carter; and schoolboy Ruairi, Brian's son by one of his affairs. The family also includes Kate's daughter Phoebe and Jennifer's sister Lilian.\n* The Bridge Farm [[List of The Archers characters#The Archer family|Archers]] practise [[organic farming]]. Their operations include a farm shop, a farm caf\u00e9, a [[vegetable box scheme]] and a dairy. Tony and Pat's children are Helen and Tom, and their three grandchildren: Johnny, who is the son of their dead son John; and Henry and Jack.\n* The [[List of The Archers characters#The Pargetter family|Pargetters]], a [[landed gentry]] family who have to make their [[stately home]], Lower Loxley Hall, pay the bills as a public attraction. The family includes Nigel Pargetter's widow, Elizabeth {{n\u00e9e}} Archer, her son Freddie and his twin sister Lily.\n* The [[Joe Grundy|Grundys]], formerly struggling [[tenant farmer]]s who were brought to prominence in the late 1970s and early 1980s as comic characters, but are now seen as doggedly battling adversity.\n* The [[List of The Archers characters#The Carter family|Carters]], Neil and Susan. Their son, Chris, is married to Alice Aldridge; their daughter, Emma, has successively married brothers, Will and Edward Grundy.\n* The [[List of The Archers characters#Lynda Snell|Snells]], Lynda, married to the long-suffering Robert, is the butt of many jokes, although her sheer energy makes her a stalwart of village life.\n\n==Ambridge==\n{{See also|List of fictional towns and villages}}\n* ''Arkwright Hall'' is a large Victorian mansion with a 17th-century atmosphere. The building served as a community centre for many years, containing a soundproofed room and field studies centre. Later it fell into disrepair, but was renovated when Jack Woolley leased the mansion to the [[Landmark Trust]]; architect Lewis Carmichael led the restoration of the building to its [[Victorian era|Victorian]] splendour.\n* ''Bridge Farm'' is a {{Convert|168|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm previously on Berrow Estate, but now owned by Pat and Tony Archer. The farm became wholly dedicated to [[organic farming]] in 1984, in a storyline inspired by a scriptwriter's visit to Brynllys farm in [[Ceredigion]], the home of [[Rachel's Organic]].<ref name=Times6847838>{{cite news | title=The Soil Association | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article6847838.ece | work=The Times | location=London | date=25 September 2009| accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> In 2003, Tom Archer began producing his Bridge Farm pork sausages. In early 2013, the family decided to sell their dairy herd and buy organic milk instead and the following year, Tony Archer bought a small [[Angus cattle|Aberdeen Angus]] herd.\n* ''Brookfield Farm'' is a {{Convert|469|acre|ha|adj=on}} mixed farm which was managed by Dan Archer and then by his son Phil. After Phil's retirement in 2001, his son David Archer took over.\n* ''Grange Farm'' was a working farm run by the Grundys until their eviction in 2000. The farmhouse, along with {{Convert|50|acre|ha|}} of land, was sold to Oliver Sterling, who then began \"hobby farming\". He took young Ed Grundy on as cow man and later gave him full responsibility for running the farm.\n* ''Grey Gables'', once a country club, is now a luxurious hotel. The late Caroline Sterling bought it with her husband Oliver Sterling. The hotel boasts a pool, spa, health club and a golf course. Ian Craig is the executive chef.\n* ''Home Farm'' is a {{Convert|1922|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm, by far the largest in Ambridge. In recent years, Home Farm expanded into soft fruit and deer farming.\n* ''Lower Loxley Hall'' is a large 300-year-old country house located just outside Ambridge. It serves primarily as a conference centre. \n* ''The Bull'', the village's only [[Public house|pub]], is perhaps the most recognisable structure in Ambridge\n* ''St. Stephen's Church'', established in 1281, dates back to [[Normans|Norman]] times. The church has undergone many changes over the years, including a number of different vicars. The eight bells are rung by a group led by Neil Carter.\n* Ambridge still has a ''[[Village shop#United Kingdom|village shop and post office]]'', originally thanks to Jack Woolley's philanthropy. The business is now a community shop managed by Susan and run by a team of volunteers.\n* ''Willow Farm'' is owned by the Tucker family. After Betty's death in 2005, the house was divided to accommodate Roy and his family. The [[Agricultural land|farmland]] is home to Neil Carter's pigs.\n\n==Topicality==\nUnlike some soap operas, episodes of ''The Archers'' portray events taking place on the date of broadcast, allowing many topical subjects to be included. Real-life events which can be readily predicted in advance are often written into the script, such as the annual [[Oxford Farming Conference]]<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/backstage/oxford_conference.shtml | title= Oxford Farming Conference | accessdate= 17 February 2008 | publisher= BBC Radio 4 | date= 3 January 2008 | url-status= dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080628092518/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/backstage/oxford_conference.shtml | archivedate= 28 June 2008 }}</ref> and the [[FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{cite episode|title= {{date|2006-06-27}}|series= The Archers |network= BBC Radio 4 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/archive_synopsis.shtml?week=20060625&day=2 }}</ref> On some occasions, scenes recorded at these events are planned and edited into episodes shortly before transmission.\n\nMore challengingly for the production team, some significant but unforeseen events require scenes to be rewritten and rerecorded at short notice, such as the death of [[Princess Margaret]] (particularly poignant because she had appeared as herself on the programme),<ref name=\"princess margaret\">{{cite web | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/backstage/princess_margaret.shtml | title= Princess Margaret Remembered | accessdate=17 February 2008| date=10 February 2002 | publisher= BBC Radio 4}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode|title= {{date|2002-02-10}}|series= The Archers |network= BBC Radio 4 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/archive_synopsis.shtml?week=20020210&day=0 }}</ref> the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|World Trade Center attacks]],<ref>{{cite episode|title= {{date|2001-09-12}}|series= The Archers |network= BBC Radio 4 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/archive_synopsis.shtml?week=20010909&day=3 }}</ref> and the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]].<ref>{{cite episode|title= {{date|2005-07-11}}|series= The Archers |network= BBC Radio 4 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/archive_synopsis.shtml?week=20050710&day=1 }}</ref> The events and implications of the [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth crisis|2001 foot-and-mouth crisis]] required many \"topical inserts\"<ref>{{cite episode|title= {{date|2001-02-22}}|series= The Archers |network= BBC Radio 4 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/archive_synopsis.shtml?week=20010218&day=4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite episode|title= {{date|2001-02-23}}|series= The Archers |network= BBC Radio 4 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/archive_synopsis.shtml?week=20010218&day=5 }}</ref><ref>{{cite episode|title= {{date|2001-02-27}}|series= The Archers |network= BBC Radio 4 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/archive_synopsis.shtml?week=20010225&day=2 }}</ref><ref>{{cite episode|title= {{date|2001-03-01}}|series= The Archers |network= BBC Radio 4 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/archive_synopsis.shtml?week=20010225&day=4 }}</ref> and the rewriting of several storylines.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/archers/backstage/drama_in_a_crisis.shtml | title= Drama in a Crisis | accessdate=17 February 2008| publisher=BBC Radio 4| date=2 March 2001}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2012, Oliver Sterling, owner of Grange Farm, together with his tenant, Ed Grundy, elected to vaccinate the badgers on their farm in an attempt to prevent the spread of bovine [[tuberculosis]].

Most of the cast do acting work on other projects and can disappear for long periods if they are working on commitments such as films or television series.

Baseley subsequently edited ''The Archers'' for 22 years.\n\nSince 1 January 1951, five 15-minute episodes (since 1998, six 12\u00bd-minute episodes) have been transmitted each week, at first on the [[BBC Light Programme]]<ref name=\"Donovan, Paul 1991 p. 8\">Donovan, Paul (1991), ''The Radio Companion''.

The original scriptwriters were Geoffrey Webb and [[Edward J. Mason]], who were also working on the nightly thriller series about the special agent Dick Barton. The popularity of his adventures partly inspired ''The Archers'', which eventually took over Barton's evening slot. At first, however, the national launch placed the serial at the 'terrible'<ref>Smethurst, William (1996), ''The Archers: The True Story''.

Phil and Grace Archer had been married just a few months earlier, and their blossoming relationship was the talk of the nation. However, searching for a story which would demonstrate some real tragedy among the increasingly unconvincing episode cliff-hangers, Godfrey Baseley had decided that Grace would have to die. The scripts for the week commencing 19 September 1955 were written, recorded, and broadcast on each day, with an \"exercise in topicality\" given as the explanation to the cast. On Thursday, listeners heard the [[sound effect]]s of Grace trying to rescue ''Midnight'', her horse, from a fire in the stable at Brookfield and the crash of a falling [[Beam (structure)|timber beam]].<ref name=\"ep10000\">{{cite episode|title= {{date|1989-05-26}}|number= 10,000|series= The Archers |network= BBC Radio 4 }}</ref>\n\nWhether the timing of the episode was a deliberate attempt to overshadow the opening night of the BBC's first commercial rival has been debated ever since. It was certainly planned some months in advance, but it may well be that the actual date of the death was changed during the scriptwriting stage to coincide with [[History of ITV|the launch of Associated-Rediffusion]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Smethurst |title = The Archers| year = 1996 |publisher= |location= | isbn = | page = 63 |chapter = Dead Girls Tell No Tales |quote = Even this presupposes that the BBC realized the impact that the 'death' would have&nbsp;\u2014 and all the evidence is that the BBC was totally taken by surprise.}}</ref> Deliberate or not, the episode attracted widespread media attention, being reported by newspapers around the world.\n\nThis controversy has been parodied twice: in \"[[The Bowmans (Hancock)|The Bowmans]]\", an episode of the television comedy programme ''Hancock'', and in the play ''[[The Killing of Sister George]]'' and [[The Killing of Sister George (film)|its 1968 film adaptation]]. On the 50th anniversary of ITV's launch, [[Ysanne Churchman]], who played Grace, sent them a congratulatory card signed \"Grace Archer\".\n\nIn 1996, William Smethurst recounted a conversation with Baseley in which he reveals his real motivation for killing off Grace Archer: Churchman was encouraging the other actors to join a trade union.<ref>{{cite book |author=Smethurst |title = The Archers |year = 1996 |publisher = |location = |isbn =|page = 64 |chapter = Dead Girls Tell No Tales |quote='She was trying to get the actors to join a trade union,' he told the author of this book, in 1995, 'so I killed her off.

Excerpts from these movements were then used for a time as bridging music between scenes. The 1954 recordings were never made available to the public and their use was restricted even inside the BBC, partly because of an agreement with the Musicians' Union.\n\nIn 1992, the theme was re-recorded in stereo, retaining the previous arrangements. The venue was Symphony Hall in Birmingham, the conductor Ron Goodwin, producer David Welsby and the sound mixer Norman McLeod. The slightly different sound mixing and more leisurely tempo reportedly led some listeners to consider the new version inferior, specifically that it lacked \"brio\", although the BBC publicised the fact that the orchestra contained some of the musicians who had played in the previous recording, including Harold Rich (piano) and Norman Parker (percussion). {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\n[[Robert Robinson (broadcaster)|Robert Robinson]] once compared the tune to \"the genteel abandon of a lifelong teetotaller who has suddenly taken to drink\". {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} On [[April Fool's Day]] 2004 both ''[[The Independent]]'' and ''[[The Today Programme]]'' claimed that BBC executives had commissioned composer [[Brian Eno]] to record an electronic version of \"Barwick Green\" as a replacement for the current theme,<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tumti-tumti-tumti-tum-kerrang-ambridge-in-uproar-over-enos-newwave-theme-tune-568412.html |title= Tum-ti tum-ti tum-ti tum... kerrang.

Each is intent upon exploring the medium itself. Of course, they use acrylic, sometimes spreading it out like sand, sometimes caking it on the canvas like mud.\" Commenting on Bloom's work, Brenson wrote \"Mr. Bloom [sic] digs into it, makes it matte and suggests aerial views of landscapes like Jules Olitski.

Yet there is more to her art, because of the mode\u2014or the mood\u2014in which she creates it.

[[Michael Brenson]], in the New York Times, wrote about the exhibition \"Each artist in the show is, of course, abstract. Each has the Formalist commitment to surface. Each is intent upon exploring the medium itself. Of course, they use acrylic, sometimes spreading it out like sand, sometimes caking it on the canvas like mud.\" Commenting on Bloom's work, Brenson wrote \"Mr. Bloom [sic] digs into it, makes it matte and suggests aerial views of landscapes like Jules Olitski.
