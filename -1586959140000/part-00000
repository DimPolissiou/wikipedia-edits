Protests emerged when the Flemish adviser [[Jean de Sauvage]] was named its president, presaging later troubles.]]\nThe '''Revolt of the Comuneros''' ({{lang-es|Guerra de las Comunidades de Castilla}}, \"War of the Communities of Castile\") was an uprising by citizens of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] against the rule of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]] and his administration between 1520 and 1521. At its height, the rebels controlled the heart of Castile, ruling the cities of [[Valladolid]], [[Tordesillas]], and [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]].\n\nThe revolt occurred in the wake of political instability in the [[Crown of Castile]] after the death of Queen [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella I]] in 1504. Isabella's daughter [[Joanna of Castile|Joanna]] succeeded to the throne. Due to Joanna's mental instability, Castile was ruled by the nobles and her father, King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], as a [[regent]]. After Ferdinand's death in 1516, Joanna's sixteen-year-old son Charles was proclaimed king of both Castile and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]].  Charles had been raised in the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Netherlands]] with little knowledge of [[Castilian language|Castilian]].  He arrived in Spain in October 1517 accompanied by a large retinue of Flemish nobles and clerics.  These factors resulted in mistrust between the new king and the Castilian social elites, who could see the threat to their power and status.\n\nIn 1519, Charles was elected [[Holy Roman Emperor]].  He departed for Germany in 1520, leaving the Dutch cardinal [[Adrian of Utrecht]] to rule Castile in his absence.  Soon, a series of anti-government riots broke out in the cities, and local city councils (''Comunidades'') took power.  The rebels chose Charles' own mother, Queen Joanna, as an alternative ruler, hoping they could control her madness.  The rebel movement took on a radical [[manorialism|anti-feudal]] dimension, supporting peasant rebellions against the landed nobility.  On April 23, 1521, after nearly a year of rebellion, the reorganized supporters of the emperor struck a crippling blow to the comuneros at the [[Battle of Villalar]].  The following day, rebel leaders [[Juan L\u00f3pez de Padilla]], [[Juan Bravo]], and [[Francisco Maldonado]] were beheaded.  The army of the comuneros fell apart.  Only the city of Toledo kept alive the rebellion led by [[Mar\u00eda Pacheco]], until its surrender in October 1521.\n\nThe character of the revolution is a matter of historiographical debate.  According to some scholars, the revolt was one of the first modern revolutions, notably because of the anti-noble sentiment against social injustice and its basis on ideals of democracy and freedom.  Others consider it a more typical rebellion against high taxes and perceived foreign control.  From the 19th century onwards, the revolt has been mythologized by various Spaniards, generally liberals who drew political inspiration from it.  Conservative intellectuals have traditionally adopted more pro-Imperial stances toward the revolt, and have been critical of both the motives and the government of the comuneros.  With [[Spanish transition to democracy|the end of Franco's dictatorship]] and the establishment of the [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]], positive commemoration of the ''Comunidades'' has grown.  April 23 is now celebrated as [[Castile and Le\u00f3n Day]], and the incident is often referred to in [[Castilian nationalism]].\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Bernard van Orley (1487-1541) Karel V - Koninklijk klooster van Brou (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|alt=A young Charles V.|A 1516 portrait of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles I of Castile and Aragon]], later Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, by [[Bernard van Orley]].

The second half of the 15th century saw profound political, economic, and social changes in Spain.  Economic growth created new urban industries and offered a route to power and wealth not tied to the aristocracy.  Support from these urban elites was critical to [[Catholic Monarchs|Ferdinand and Isabella's]] centralization of power, and they acted as a counterweight to the landed aristocracy and the clergy.<ref name=\"Halp10\">[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 10.</ref>\n\nHowever, with [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella I]]'s death and [[Joanna of Spain|Joanna]]'s accession in 1504, this alliance between the national government and the budding middle class faltered.<ref name=\"Halp10\" /> The Castilian government decayed with each successive administration, becoming rife with corruption.<ref>[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 113.</ref> Joanna's husband, [[Philip I of Castile|Philip I]], reigned briefly; he was replaced by [[Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros|Archbishop Cisneros]] as regent for a short time, and then by Isabella's widower [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] who ruled from Aragon.<ref name=\"hal151\">[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 151.</ref> Ferdinand's claim to continue ruling Castile as regent was somewhat tenuous after Isabella's death, but no plausible alternatives existed as the sovereign, their widowed daughter [[Joanna of Castile|Joanna]], was mentally unfit to reign on her own.<ref name=\"hal151\" /> The landed nobility of Castile took advantage of the weak and corrupt [[Council of Castile|Royal Council]] to illegally expand their territory and domain with private armies while the government did nothing.<ref>[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 66.</ref> In response, the towns signed mutual defense pacts, relying on each other rather than the national government.<ref>[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 93.</ref>\n\nThe budgets of both Castile and Aragon had been in poor condition for some time.  The government had [[Alhambra Decree|expelled the Jews]] in 1492 and the [[Morisco|Muslims of Granada]] in 1502, moves that undercut lucrative trades and businesses.<ref>[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 147.  The [[silk]] industry is held up as particularly relevant, as the Moors had been deeply involved in it; more generally, many Muslim converts to Christianity who had not been expelled still emigrated from 1500 onward.</ref> Ferdinand and Isabella had been forced to borrow money to pay troops during and after the [[Reconquista#Granada War|Reconquista]], and Spanish military obligations had only increased since then.<ref name=\"hal147\">[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 147.</ref> A large number of troops were required to maintain stability in recently conquered [[Emirate of Granada|Granada]], threatened by revolt from the maltreated [[morisco]]s (former Muslims who had converted to Christianity) and frequent [[Barbary pirate|naval raids]] from Muslim nations along the Mediterranean.<ref name=\"hal163\">[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 163.</ref> Additionally, Ferdinand had [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre|invaded and occupied the Iberian part of Navarre]] in 1512, and forces were required to garrison it against Navarrese revolts and French armies.<ref>[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 145.</ref> Very little money was left to pay for the royal army in Castile proper, let alone service foreign debts.  The corruption in the government since Isabella's death only made the budget shortfalls worse.<ref name=\"hal147\" />\n\n===Succession of Charles===\nIn 1516, Ferdinand died.  The remaining heir was Ferdinand and Isabella's grandson [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]], who became King Charles I of both [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] in [[coregency]] with his mother Joanna.  Charles was brought up in [[Flanders]], the homeland of his father Philip, and barely knew Castilian.<ref>[[#Lyn64|Lynch 1964]], p. 36.</ref> The people greeted him with skepticism, but also hoped he would restore stability.  With the arrival of the new king in late 1517, [[List of people associated with the Revolt of the Comuneros#Royal Council and Advisers|his Flemish court]] took positions of power in Castile; young Charles only trusted people he knew from the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Netherlands]].  Among the most scandalous of these was the appointment of the twenty-year-old [[William de Cro\u00ff (bishop)|William de Cro\u00ff]] as [[Archbishop of Toledo]].  The Archbishopric was an important position; it had been held by [[Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros|Archbishop Cisneros]], the former regent of the country.<ref>[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 126.</ref><ref name=\"Lynch38\" /> Six months into his rule, discontent openly simmered among rich and poor alike.  Even some monks began to agitate, denouncing the opulence of the royal court, the Flemish, and the nobility in their sermons.  One of the first public protests involved placards posted in churches, which read:\n{{quote|You, land of Castile, very wretched and damned are you to suffer that as noble a kingdom as you are, you will be governed by those who have no love for you.<ref>[[#Die77|J. L. D\u00edez 1977]], p. 7.  \"T\u00fa, tierra de Castilla, muy desgraciada y maldita eres al sufrir que un tan noble reino como eres, sea gobernado por quienes no te tienen amor.\"</ref>}}\nWith the unrest growing, Charles' paternal grandfather [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I]] died in 1519.  A new election had to be held to choose the next emperor.  Charles campaigned aggressively for the post, vying with [[Francis I of France|King Francis I of France]] to bribe the most [[prince-elector]]s.<ref name=\"sea50\">[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 50.</ref> Charles I won the election, becoming Emperor Charles V and cementing the power of the [[House of Habsburg]]. He prepared to head to Germany to take possession of his new domains in the Holy Roman Empire.<ref name=\"sea50\" />\n\n===New taxes: The Cortes of Santiago and Corunna===\nCharles had already stressed the treasury to its limit with his extravagant Flemish court, and over 1&nbsp;million [[florin]]s were spent in bribes for the election.<ref name=\"Lynch38\">[[#Lyn64|Lynch 1964]], p. 38.</ref> Taxes{{efn|This article uses the term \"tax\" to encompass a variety of revenue-raising methods the government used.  Briefly, ''servicios'' were flat monetary grants paid to the treasury; the ''encabezamiento'' was a portion of the sales tax towns collected sent to the government; and the ''cruzada'' (\"crusade\") was a special and semi-voluntary contribution that counted as an [[indulgence]] and was generally used for war against the Muslims.  Charles wanted to abolish the lenient ''encabezamiento'' and return to an older and harsher system of direct royal control of tolls, pasturage fees, and the like.  He also requested large ''servicios'' at the Cortes he held.  Part of the revenue problem the government had was that income from the ''cruzada'' had fallen greatly since the [[Reconquista]] had finished in 1492.<ref name=\"hal147\" />}} had to be raised to cover the debt, but any new taxes had to be approved by the ''[[Cortes Generales#History of the Cortes|Cortes]]'' (Castile's own parliamentary body).  Thus, in late March 1520, Charles convened the Cortes in [[Santiago de Compostela]].  Charles ensured the Cortes would only have limited power, and further attempted to stack the Cortes with pliable representatives he could bribe.<ref name=\"Lynch38\" /> Support for the opposition only increased in response, and the representatives demanded that their grievances be heard first before any new tax was granted.<ref name=\"Hal159\">[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 159.</ref>\n\nA group of clerics soon circulated a statement in protest of the king. It argued three points: any new taxes should be rejected; Castile should be embraced and the foreign Empire rejected; and if the king did not take into account his subjects, the ''Comunidades'' themselves should defend the interests of the kingdom.<ref name=\"Perez39\">[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 39\u201340.</ref> It was the first time where the word ''comunidades'' (communities, communes) was used to signify the independent populace, and the name would stick to the councils later formed.<ref name=\"Perez39\" />\n\nAt this point, most of the members of the Cortes in Santiago intended to vote against the king's requested duties and taxes, even with the Cortes stacked with royalists.  In response, Charles decided to suspend the Cortes on April 4.<ref>[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 75.</ref> He convened them again in [[a Coru\u00f1a|Corunna]] <!--See talk page for why Corunna is used, not A/La Coru\u00f1a.--> on April 22, this time getting his program passed.<ref name=\"Lynch38\" /> On May 20, he embarked for Germany, and left as regent of his Spanish possessions his former tutor, Adrian of Utrecht (better known as the future Pope Adrian VI).<ref>[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 77\u201379.</ref>\n\n==Beginnings of the Revolt==\n===Rebelliousness in Toledo===\n[[File:Toledo Skyline Panorama, Spain - Dec 2006.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=A cityscape; two tall buildings dominate the view, the Alc\u00e1zar and the Cathedral.|Toledo, home of the first ''Comunidad'']]\n[[File:Juan de Padilla.gif|thumb|175px|alt=A bearded man wearing a feathered cap, armor, and sash.|[[Juan L\u00f3pez de Padilla]], leader of the ''Comunidad'' of Toledo]]\nIn April 1520, [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] was already unstable.  The city council had been at the forefront of protests against Charles' bid to become Holy Roman Emperor.  They decried the short-term expenses that would be borne by [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and questioned the role of Castile in this new political framework, given the possibility that the land would become a mere imperial province.<ref name=\"Perez39\" /> The situation erupted when the royal government summoned the most radical of the city councilors away from the city, intending to send back more easily controllable replacements on a royal salary.  The order came on April 15; one day later, as the councilors prepared to leave, a large crowd opposed to the departure rioted and drove out the royal administrators instead.<ref>[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 160.</ref> A citizen's committee was elected under the leadership of [[Juan L\u00f3pez de Padilla]] and [[Pedro Laso de la Vega]], naming themselves a ''Comunidad''.  On April 21, the remaining administrators were driven from the fortifications of the [[Alc\u00e1zar of Toledo]].<ref>[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 161, and [[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 87.  [[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]] lists the final fall as happening on May 31; this is (almost certainly) referring to the formal capture of the Alc\u00e1zar.  The defending forces had long since left by then.</ref>\n\nFollowing Charles' departure to Germany, the riots multiplied in the cities of [[Geography of Spain#The Inner Plateau and associated mountains|central Castile]], especially after the arrival of legislators who had voted \"yes\" to the taxes Charles had asked for.  [[Segovia]] had some of the earliest and most violent incidents; on May 30, a mob of woolworkers murdered two administrators and the city's legislator who had voted in favor.<ref>[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 3.</ref> Incidents of a similar size occurred in cities such as [[Burgos]] and [[Guadalajara, Spain|Guadalajara]], while others, such as [[Le\u00f3n, Spain|Le\u00f3n]], [[\u00c1vila, Spain|\u00c1vila]], and [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]], suffered minor altercations.<ref>[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 50\u201352.</ref>\n\n===Proposals to other cities===\nWith widespread discontent circulating, on June 8 Toledo's council suggested to cities with a vote in the Cortes to hold an emergency meeting.  They proffered five goals:\n# Cancel the taxes voted in the Cortes of Corunna.\n# A return to the local-controlled ''[[#endnote Anone|encabezamiento]]'' system of taxation.\n# Reserve official positions and church [[benefice]]s for Castilians.\n# Prohibit money from leaving the kingdom to fund foreign affairs.\n# Designate a Castilian to lead the kingdom in the absence of the king.<ref name=\"perez53\">[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 53\u201354.</ref>\n\nThese claims, especially the first two, spread quickly through society.<ref name=\"perez53\" /> Ideas began to circulate of replacing the king; Toledo's leaders floated the possibility of turning the cities of Castile into independent [[City-state|free cities]], similar to [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and other [[Repubbliche Marinare|Italian republics]].<ref name=\"perez53\" /> Competing proposals suggested keeping the monarchy, but dethroning Charles.  They proposed that he be replaced by either his mother Queen Joanna or his Castilian-born brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]].<ref name=\"Hal159\" /> With these ideas, the revolt shifted from a simple protest against taxes to a broader revolution.  Many cities, while not quite in outright revolt, stopped sending taxes to the Royal Council and began to self-govern.<ref name=\"hal164\">[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 164.</ref>\n\n==Expansion of the Revolt==\n===Blockade of Segovia===\n[[File:AcueductoSegovia edit1.jpg|thumb|alt=A stone aqueduct bordered by a modern road and smaller houses.|Segovia, the city of the first armed clash between the comuneros and the royalists]]\nThe situation moved closer to armed conflict on June 10.  [[Rodrigo Ronquillo]] had been sent to Segovia by the [[Council of Castile|Royal Council]] to investigate the recent murder of Segovia's legislator, but Segovia refused him entry.  Unable to besiege a city of 30,000 with only a small force, Ronquillo instead set out to blockade foodstuffs and other supplies from entering Segovia.  The people of Segovia, led by militia leader and noble Juan Bravo, rallied around the ''Comunidad''.  Segovia requested aid against Ronquillo's army from the ''Comunidades'' of Toledo and Madrid.  The cities responded by sending their militias, captained by Juan L\u00f3pez de Padilla and [[Juan de Zapata]], who won in the first major confrontation between the forces of the king and the rebels.<ref name=\"hal163\"/>\n\n===The Junta of \u00c1vila===\nOther cities now followed the lead of Toledo and Segovia, deposing their governments.  A revolutionary Cortes, {{lang|es|La Santa Junta de las Comunidades}} (\"Holy Assembly of the Communities\"),{{efn|''[[wikt:junta|Junta]]'', meaning \"Congress\" or \"Assembly,\" did not yet have the negative connotation of \"Oligarchical military dictatorship\" in the 16th century.}} held its first session in [[\u00c1vila, Spain|\u00c1vila]] and declared itself the legitimate government deposing the Royal Council.  Padilla was named Captain-General, and troops were assembled.  Still, only four cities sent representatives at first: Toledo, Segovia, Salamanca, and Toro.<ref>[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 166.</ref>\n\n===Burning of Medina del Campo===\n[[File:Medinapano03.jpg|thumb|alt=A stone castle, surrounded by an empty moat.|The ''[[Castillo de la Mota]]'' of [[Medina del Campo]]]]\nFaced with the situation in Segovia, Regent and Cardinal [[Adrian of Utrecht]] decided to use the royal artillery, located in nearby [[Medina del Campo]], to take Segovia and defeat Padilla.  Adrian ordered his commander [[Antonio de Fonseca]] to seize the artillery.<ref name=\"hal165\">[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 165.</ref> Fonseca arrived on August 21 in Medina, but encountered heavy resistance from the townspeople, as the city had strong trade links to Segovia.  Fonseca ordered the setting of a fire to distract the resistance, but it grew out of control.  Much of the town was destroyed, including a [[Franciscan]] monastery and a trade warehouse containing goods valued at more than 400,000 [[ducat]]s.<ref name=\"sea129\" /> Fonseca had to withdraw his troops, and the event was a public relations disaster for the government.<ref name=\"sea129\">[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 129.</ref><ref name=\"Halp6\" /> Uprisings throughout Castile occurred, even in cities that previously had been neutral such as Castile's capital, [[Valladolid]].  The establishment of the ''Comunidad'' of Valladolid caused the most important core of the [[Geography of Spain#The Inner Plateau and associated mountains|Iberian plateau]] to declare for the rebels, upending the stability of the government.  New members now joined the Junta of \u00c1vila and the Royal Council looked discredited; Adrian had to flee to [[Medina de Rioseco]] as Valladolid fell.<ref name=\"Halp6\">[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 6.</ref> The royal army, with many of its soldiers unpaid for months, started to disintegrate.<ref name=\"hal165\" />\n\n===The Junta of Tordesillas===\n[[File:Johanna I van Castili\u00eb.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A lady with a long, thin face wearing red robes and a hood in the style of a nun.|[[Joanna the Mad]], officially the Queen and co-regent of Castile with her son Charles, actually had no power whatsoever]]\nThe comunero army now properly organized itself, integrating the militias of Toledo, Madrid, and Segovia.  Once told of Fonseca's attack, the comunero forces went to Medina del Campo and took possession of the artillery that had just been denied to Fonseca's troops.<ref>[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 60.</ref> On August 29, the comuneros' army arrived at [[Tordesillas]] with the goal of declaring [[Joanna of Castile|Queen Joanna]] the sole sovereign.  The Junta moved from \u00c1vila to Tordesillas at the Queen's request and invited cities that had not yet sent representatives to do so.<ref>[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 164.</ref> A total of thirteen cities were represented in the Junta of Tordesillas: [[Burgos]], [[Soria]], [[Segovia]], [[\u00c1vila, Spain|\u00c1vila]], [[Valladolid]], [[Le\u00f3n, Spain|Le\u00f3n]], [[Salamanca]], [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]], [[Toro, Zamora|Toro]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]], [[Guadalajara, Spain|Guadalajara]], and [[Madrid]].<ref>[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 167.</ref> The only invited cities that failed to attend were the four Andalusian cities: [[Seville]], [[Granada]], [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordova]], and [[Ja\u00e9n, Spain|Ja\u00e9n]].  Since most of the kingdom was represented at Tordesillas, the Junta renamed itself the {{lang|es|[[Cortes Generales|Cortes y Junta General del Reino]]}} (\"General Assembly of the Kingdom\").<ref>[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 61.  In the spelling of the time, it was rendered ''Cortes e Junta General del Reyno''.</ref> On September 24, 1520, the mad Queen, for the only time, presided over the Cortes.<ref>[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 147.</ref>\n\nThe legislators met with Queen Joanna and explained the purpose of the Cortes: to proclaim her sovereignty and restore lost stability to the kingdom.  The next day, September 25, the Cortes issued a declaration pledging to use arms if necessary and for the whole to aid any one city that was threatened.  On September 26, the Cortes of Tordesillas declared itself the new legitimate government and denounced the Royal Council.  Oaths of self-defense were taken by all the cities represented over the week, finishing by September 30.  The revolutionary government now had structure and a free hand to act, with the Royal Council still ineffective and confused.<ref>[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 179.</ref>\n\n===Scope of the rebellion===\n[[File:Escultura en bronce de Juan de Padilla, obra del escultor toledano Julio Mart\u00edn de Vidales.jpg|thumb|right|Bronze sculpture of Juan de Padilla in Toledo]]\nThe comuneros were strong in the [[Geography of Spain#The Inner Plateau and associated mountains|central plateau of the Iberian Peninsula]], as well as scattered other places such as [[Murcia]].  The rebels sought to propound their revolutionary ideas to the rest of the kingdom, but without much success.  There were few attempts at rebellion elsewhere, such as in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] to the northwest or in [[Andalusia]] to the south.<ref name=\"perez146\">[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 146\u2013147.</ref>  ''Comunidades'' in the south were set up in [[Ja\u00e9n, Spain|Ja\u00e9n]], [[\u00dabeda]], and [[Baeza]], unique in Andalusia, but with time they were drawn back into the royalists.  Murcia stayed with the rebel cause, but did not coordinate much with the Junta, and the rebellion there had a character closer to the nearby [[Revolt of the Brotherhoods]] in [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] in [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]].<ref>[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 155.</ref> In [[Extremadura]] to the southwest, the city of [[Plasencia]] joined the  ''Comunidades'', but this was undermined by the close proximity of other royalist cities such as [[Ciudad Rodrigo]] and [[C\u00e1ceres, Spain|C\u00e1ceres]].<ref name=\"perez146\" /> A close correlation can be drawn between poor economic fortunes over the previous twenty years and the rebellion; central Castile suffered from agricultural failure and other setbacks under the Royal Council, while Andalusia was relatively prosperous with its maritime trade.  Andalusia's leadership also feared that in the instability of a civil war, the [[Moriscos]] of Granada would likely revolt.<ref>[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 183, 205.</ref>\n\n{{wide image|ComunerosCityControl.png|760px|alt=Map of Spain with cities colored by affiliation; see text for details.|3=The rebels were strongest in the central plateau of Spain; the royalists controlled Andalusia in the South and Galicia in the North.

He spearheaded the recruitment of nobility to the royalist side, and two Castilian co-regents were appointed to lessen the appearance of foreign control.]]\n\n===Turning of the nobles===\nThe growing success of the comuneros emboldened people to accuse members of the old government of complicity with royal abuses.  The protests attacked the landed nobility as well, many of whom had illegally taken property during the reign of the regents and weak kings after Isabella's death.  In [[Due\u00f1as, Palencia|Due\u00f1as]], the Count of Buend\u00eda's vassals revolted against him on September 1, 1520, encouraged by rebel monks.<ref name=\"Halp185\" /> This uprising was followed by others of a similar anti-feudal nature.<ref>[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 65.</ref> The leadership of the comuneros was forced to take a stance on these new rebellions; reluctant to openly endorse them, the Junta initially denounced them but did nothing to oppose them.<ref>[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 306.</ref> The dynamics of the uprising thus changed profoundly, as it could now jeopardize the status of the entire [[Manorialism|manorial system]].  The nobles had previously been somewhat sympathetic to the cause due to their loss of privileges to the central government.  However, these new developments lead to a dramatic drop in support for the comuneros from aristocrats, who were frightened by the more radical elements of the revolution.<ref name=\"Halp185\">[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 185.</ref>\n\n===Response of Charles V===\nAt first, Charles seemed not to grasp the magnitude of the revolt.  He continued to demand payments from Castile; with the government of Castile still in arrears, Cardinal Adrian found it impossible to secure any new loans.<ref name=\"hal164\" /> A letter from Cardinal Adrian on August 25 warned Charles of the severity of the situation:\n\n{{quote|Your Highness is making a great error if you think that you will be able to collect and make use of this tax; there is no one in the Kingdom, not in Seville or Valladolid or any other city who will ever pay anything of it; all the grandees and members of the council are amazed that Your Highness has scheduled payments from these funds.<ref name=\"hal164\" />|[[Adrian of Utrecht]]}}\n\nOnce he realized that a full-fledged revolution was underway, Charles responded vigorously.  Through Cardinal Adrian, he undertook new policy initiatives, such as canceling the taxes granted in the Cortes of Corunna.  Most important was the appointment of two new Castilian co-regents: the [[Constable of Castile]], [[\u00cd\u00f1igo Fern\u00e1ndez]], and the [[Admiral of Castile]], [[Fadrique Enr\u00edquez]].<ref>[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 155\u2013156.</ref> This negated two of the most salient complaints of the rebels.  In addition, Adrian approached the nobles to convince them that their best interests lay with the king.  The Royal Council was re-established in the fief of Admiral Enr\u00edquez, [[Medina de Rioseco]], which enabled the Council to be nearer to the revolting cities and reassure skeptical supporters.<ref>[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 163.</ref> While the royal army was still in tatters, many high nobles maintained their own well-trained mercenary armies\u2014armies that with the revolt's recent radicalization would now fight for the king.<ref name=\"Halp6\" />\n\n==Organization, funding, and diplomacy==\nThe first political defeats of the comuneros came in October 1520.  The comuneros' attempt to use Queen Joanna for legitimacy did not bear fruit, as she blocked their initiatives and refused to sign any edicts.<ref>[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 156.</ref> In turn, dissenting voices inside the comuneros now began to be heard, especially in [[Burgos]].  The wavering position of Burgos was soon known to the royalists, and the Constable of Castile negotiated with Burgos's government.  The Royal Council granted a number of significant concessions to Burgos in exchange for them leaving the Junta.<ref>[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 215.</ref>\n\nFollowing this incident, the Royal Council hoped that other cities would imitate Burgos and leave the comuneros peacefully.  Valladolid, the former seat of royal power, was considered especially likely to turn, but too many supporters of the king had left city politics and lost their influence.  It remained rebel-controlled.<ref>[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 179.</ref> The Admiral of Castile continued his campaign to try to convince the comuneros to return to the royal government and thereby avoid a violent suppression.<ref>[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 192\u2013195.</ref> This attitude concealed a great shortage of funds on the royal side.<ref name=\"hal181\">[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 181.</ref>\n\nDuring October and November 1520, both sides accepted that a military conclusion would soon be necessary and actively devoted themselves to fundraising, recruiting soldiers, and training their troops.  The comuneros organized their militias in the major cities and levied new taxes on the countryside; they also took measures aimed at eliminating waste, routinely auditing their treasurers and dismissing those thought to be corrupt.<ref>[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 170.</ref> The royal government, which had lost much of its revenue due to the revolt, sought loans from [[Portugal]] and from conservative Castilian bankers, who saw reassuring signs in the switch of the allegiance of Burgos.<ref name=\"hal181\" />\n\n==Battle of Tordesillas==\n{{main|Military history of the Revolt of the Comuneros#Battle of Tordesillas}}\n\n===Leadership disputes===\n[[File:BattleofTordesillas.PNG|thumb|right|310px|alt=Map of army maneuvers.

[[Pedro T\u00e9llez-Gir\u00f3n, 3rd Count of Ure\u00f1a|Pedro Gir\u00f3n]]'s rebel force was larger but slower, with 10,000 infantry, 900 cavalry, and 13 artillery pieces.  The rebels' deficiency in cavalry would hurt them throughout the war.<ref name=\"seaver200\" />]]\nGradually, both the city of Toledo and its leader Juan L\u00f3pez de Padilla lost influence within the Junta, though Padilla retained popularity and prestige among the commoners.  Two new figures emerged within the ''Comunidades'', [[Pedro T\u00e9llez-Gir\u00f3n, 3rd Count of Ure\u00f1a|Pedro Gir\u00f3n]] and [[Antonio Osorio de Acu\u00f1a]].  Gir\u00f3n was one of the most powerful nobles who supported the comuneros; his rebellion is thought to originate from Charles' refusal to grant Gir\u00f3n the prestigious [[Dukes of Medina Sidonia|Duchy of Medina-Sidonia]] a year prior to the war.  Antonio de Acu\u00f1a was the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Zamora in Spain|Bishop of Zamora]].  Acu\u00f1a was also the head of the ''Comunidad'' in Zamora and the leader of its army, which included more than 300 priests.<ref>[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 75.</ref><ref name=\"Alfonso Guilarte\">[[#Gui83|Guilarte 1983]].</ref>\n\nOn the royalist side, the nobles could not agree on what tactics to use.  Some preferred to directly challenge the rebels in combat, while others such as the Constable of Castile favored continued waiting and the building of defensive fortifications.  The Admiral of Castile preferred negotiations and exhausting all the possible peaceful options first.<ref>[[#Lyn64|Lynch 1964]], p. 40.</ref> Patience, however, began to run thin; armies were expensive to maintain once assembled.  In late November 1520, both armies took positions between Medina de Rioseco and Tordesillas, and a confrontation was inevitable.<ref name=\"perez78\">[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 78.</ref>\n\n===Royal capture===\nWith Pedro Gir\u00f3n in command, the army of the comuneros advanced on [[Medina de Rioseco]], following the orders of the Junta.  Gir\u00f3n established his headquarters in [[Villabr\u00e1gima]], a town merely {{convert|8|km|mi}} from the royalist army.  The royalists occupied nearby villages to cut communication lines back to other comuneros.<ref name=\"perez78\" />\n\nThis situation continued until December 2, when Gir\u00f3n, apparently thinking the royal army would remain entrenched,{{efn|There exists a theory that [[Pedro T\u00e9llez-Gir\u00f3n, 3rd Count of Ure\u00f1a|Gir\u00f3n]]'s errors were in fact an intentional betrayal of the comuneros.

However, with this movement, the comuneros left the path to Tordesillas completely unprotected. The royal army took advantage of the blunder, marching by night on December 4 and occupying Tordesillas the next day.  The small rebel garrison was overwhelmed.<ref name=\"seaver200\">[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 200\u2013202.</ref>\n\nSeizure of Tordesillas marked a serious defeat for the comuneros, who lost [[Joanna of Castile|Queen Joanna]] and with her their claim to legitimacy. In addition, thirteen representatives of the Junta were imprisoned, though others fled and escaped.<ref name=\"hal189\" /> Morale fell among the rebels, and much angry criticism was directed towards Pedro Gir\u00f3n for his maneuvering of the troops out of position and for his failure to attempt to retake Tordesillas or capture Medina de Rioseco.  Gir\u00f3n was obliged to resign from his post and withdrew from the war.<ref>[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 206.</ref>\n\n==Events of December and January==\n\n===Reorganization of the comuneros===\nFollowing the loss of Tordesillas, the comuneros regrouped in [[Valladolid]].  The Junta reconvened on December 15, but with only eleven cities represented, down from a height of fourteen.  Soria and Guadalajara's representatives did not return, and Burgos had left earlier.<ref>[[#Per70|P\u00e9rez 1970]], p. 262.  Note that the original Junta of Tordesillas had thirteen cities represented, not fourteen; Murcia joined later.</ref> Valladolid would be the third capital of the rebels, after \u00c1vila and Tordesillas.<ref>[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 95</ref>\n\nThe situation was somewhat worse for the army, with a large number of desertions in Valladolid and Villalpando.  This forced the rebels to intensify their recruitment drives, especially in Toledo, Salamanca, and Valladolid itself.  With these new recruits and the arrival of Juan de Padilla to Valladolid, the rebel military apparatus was rebuilt and morale bolstered.  At the beginning of 1521, the comuneros prepared for an all-out war, despite disagreements within the movement.  Some suggested seeking a peaceful resolution, while others favored continuing the war.  Those who favored war were divided between two tactics: occupy [[Simancas]] and [[Torrelobat\u00f3n]], a less ambitious proposal defended by [[Pedro Laso de la Vega]]; or lay siege to Burgos, a tactic favored by Padilla.<ref>[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 99</ref>\n\n===Military initiatives in Palencia and Burgos===\n[[File:Burgos Santa Maria Arc.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=An ornate stone gate with statues.|[[Arco de Santa Mar\u00eda]] in [[Burgos]], one of the few cities loyal to the king on the Iberian plateau]]\n\nIn the far north of Castile, the rebel army began a series of operations conducted by [[Antonio Osorio de Acu\u00f1a|Antonio de Acu\u00f1a]], bishop of Zamora.  They received orders from the Junta on December 23 to try and raise a rebellion in [[Palencia (province)|Palencia]].  They were tasked with expelling royalists, collecting taxes on behalf of the Junta, and creating an administration sympathetic to the comuneros cause. Acu\u00f1a's army made a series of raids into the area around [[Due\u00f1as, Palencia|Due\u00f1as]], raising more than 4,000 ducats and inspiring the peasantry.  He returned to Valladolid in early 1521, then came back to Due\u00f1as on January 10 to begin a major offensive against the nobles of [[Tierra de Campos]].  The nobles' land and holdings were completely devastated.<ref name=\"Alfonso Guilarte\" /><ref name=\"perez105\" />\n\nIn mid-January, Pedro de Ayala, Count of Salvatierra, joined the comuneros and organized an army of about two thousand men who set about raiding the north of Castile.<ref name=\"seaver294\">[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 294</ref> Nearby, Burgos awaited the fulfillment of the pledges made by Cardinal Adrian after they had joined the royalist cause two months prior.  The slow response led to dissatisfaction and uncertainty in the city.  Ayala and Acu\u00f1a, aware of this situation, decided to besiege Burgos, Ayala from its north and Acu\u00f1a from its south.  They also sought to undermine the defenses by encouraging a revolt of the inhabitants of Burgos.<ref name=\"perez105\">[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 105</ref>\n\n===Royalist response===\nStill in Germany, Charles V issued the Edict of Worms on December 17, 1520 (not to be confused with the [[Edict of Worms]] of May 25, 1521, against [[Martin Luther]]), which condemned 249 prominent ''Comunidad'' members. For secular rebels, the punishment was death; clergy were to receive lighter penalties. Similarly, the edict also declared that those who supported the ''Comunidades'' were traitors, disloyal, rebels, and infidels.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/historia/CarlosV/7_1_14.shtml |title=Texto \u00edntegro del Edicto de Worms |publisher=Cervantes Virtual Library |date=December 17, 1520 |accessdate=2008-07-20 |language=Spanish }}</ref>\n\nThe Royal Council's next move was the occupation of [[Ampudia]] in Palencia, a town loyal to the Count of Salvatierra. The Junta sent Padilla to meet Acu\u00f1a; their combined force besieged the royal army at [[Torremormoj\u00f3n|the castle of Mormoj\u00f3n]]. The royal army slipped away by nightfall, and Mormoj\u00f3n was forced to pay tribute to avoid being pillaged.  Ampudia was recovered by the rebels the next day, January 16.<ref name=\"seaver228\">[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 228, and [[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 104.

The comuneros of Burgos had to surrender, and this was the last rebellion to be seen in Castile.<ref name=\"perez105\" /><ref name=\"seaver228\" />\n\n==Rebel campaigns of early 1521==\n\n===Padilla's decision on the rebels' next move===\n[[File:Castillo de Torrelobat\u00f3n (torre del homenaje).jpg|thumb|alt=A stone tower at the corner of the defensive walls.|The taking of the [[Castle of Torrelobat\u00f3n]], built in the 13th century, provided a much-needed victory for the comuneros.  The castle was renovated in 2007 and is now a tourist site.]]\nAfter abandoning the siege of Burgos due to the failure of its revolt, Padilla decided to return to Valladolid, while Acu\u00f1a opted to resume his skirmishing and harassment of noble properties around Tierra de Campos. With this series of actions, Acu\u00f1a intended to destroy or occupy the homes of the prominent nobles.  The rebels now set themselves completely against the [[manorialism|manorial system]].  This would be one of the strongest features of the second phase of the rebellion.<ref name=\"seaver228\" />\n\nAfter the recent setbacks suffered by the comuneros, Padilla realized that they needed a victory to raise morale.  He decided to take [[Torrelobat\u00f3n]] and its castle.  Torrelobat\u00f3n was a stronghold halfway between Tordesillas and Medina de Rioseco, and was very close to Valladolid.  Taking it would grant the rebels an excellent fortress for launching military operations and remove a threat on Valladolid.<ref>[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 248.</ref>\n\n===Battle of Torrelobat\u00f3n===\nOn February 21, 1521, the [[Military history of the Revolt of the Comuneros#Battle of Torrelobat\u00f3n|siege of Torrelobat\u00f3n]] began.  Outnumbered, the town nevertheless resisted for four days, thanks to its walls.  On February 25, the comuneros entered the town and subjected it to a massive looting spree as a reward to the troops.  Only churches were spared.<ref>[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 251.</ref> The castle resisted for another two days. The comuneros then threatened to [[hanging|hang]] all of the inhabitants, at which point the castle surrendered.  The defenders did secure an agreement to spare half of the goods inside the castle, thus avoiding further looting.<ref>[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 107.  \"Los asaltantes amenzaron con ahorcar a todos los inhabitantes si no se rend\u00eda.\"</ref>\n\nThe victory in Torrelobat\u00f3n lifted the spirits of the rebel camp while worrying the royalists about the rebel advance, exactly as Padilla hoped.  The faith of the nobles in Cardinal Adrian was again shaken, as he was accused of having done nothing to avoid losing Torrelobat\u00f3n.  The Constable of Castile began to send troops to the Tordesillas area to contain the rebels and prevent any further advances.<ref name=\"perez110\">[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 110.</ref>\n\nDespite the renewed enthusiasm among the rebels, a decision was made to remain in their positions near Valladolid without pressing their advantage or launching a new attack.  This caused many of the soldiers to return to their home communities, tired of waiting for salaries and new orders.<ref>[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 109.</ref> This was a problem the comunero forces had throughout the war; they possessed only a small number of full-time soldiers, and their militias were constantly \"dissolving and recruiting.\"<ref>[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 319.</ref> A serious attempt to negotiate a peaceful end to the war was tried again by the moderates, but was undercut by extremists of both sides.<ref>[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 278.</ref>\n\nIn the north, after the failure of the siege of Burgos in January, the Count of Salvatierra resumed his campaign.

They feared Acu\u00f1a might attack their holdings as he did in [[Tierra de Campos]].  The [[Diego L\u00f3pez Pacheco|Marquis of Villena]] and [[Diego Hurtado de Mendoza y Luna|Duke of Infantado]] contacted Acu\u00f1a and persuaded him to sign a pact of mutual neutrality.<ref name=\"perez114\">[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 114\u2013115.</ref>\n\nAcu\u00f1a soon had to confront [[Antonio de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]], who had been appointed commander of the royalist army in the Toledo area.

After royalist troops burned the town of [[Mora, Spain|Mora]] on April 12, Acu\u00f1a returned to the countryside with roughly 1,500 men under his command.  He moved into [[Yepes]], and from there conducted raids and operations against royalist-controlled rural areas.

The [[Constable of Castile]] moved his troops (including soldiers recently transferred from the defense of Navarre) southwest from Burgos to meet with the [[Fadrique Enr\u00edquez|Admiral]]'s forces near Tordesillas.<ref name=\"perez110\" /> Meanwhile, the comuneros reinforced their troops at Torrelobat\u00f3n, which was far less secure than the comuneros preferred.  Their forces were suffering from desertions, and the presence of royalist artillery would make Torrelobat\u00f3n's castle vulnerable. Juan L\u00f3pez de Padilla considered withdrawing to [[Toro, Spain|Toro]] to seek reinforcements in early April, but wavered.  He delayed his decision until the early hours of April 23, losing considerable time and allowing the royalists to unite their forces in [[Pe\u00f1aflor de Hornija|Pe\u00f1aflor]].<ref name=\"seaver324\">[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 324\u2013325.</ref><ref name=\"perezorig313\">[[#Per70|P\u00e9rez 1970]], p. 313\u2013314.</ref>\n\nThe combined royalist army pursued the comuneros. Again, the royalists had a strong advantage in cavalry, with their army consisting of 6,000 infantry and 2,400 cavalry against Padilla's 7,000 infantry and 400 cavalry.  Heavy rain slowed Padilla's infantry more than the royalist cavalry and rendered the primitive firearms of the rebels' 1,000 [[arquebusiers]] nearly useless.<ref name=\"seaver324\" /> Padilla hoped to reach the relative safety of Toro and the heights of [[Vega de Valdetronco]], but his infantry was too slow.  He gave battle with the harrying royalist cavalry at the town of Villalar.  The cavalry charges scattered the rebel ranks, and the battle became a slaughter.  There were an estimated 500\u20131,000 rebel casualties and many desertions.<ref name=\"perezorig313\" />\n\nThe three most important leaders of the rebellion were captured: Juan L\u00f3pez de Padilla, Juan Bravo, and [[Francisco Maldonado]].

The magnitude of the defeat became apparent in a few days, after the first survivors began arriving in the city and confirmed the fact that the three rebel leaders had been executed.  Toledo was declared in mourning over the death of Juan de Padilla.<ref>[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 123.</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Padilla, [[Antonio de Acu\u00f1a|Bishop Acu\u00f1a]] lost popularity in favour of [[Mar\u00eda Pacheco]], Padilla's widow.<ref>[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 128.</ref> People began to suggest negotiating with the royalists, seeking to avoid further suffering in the city.

Castile had withdrawn some of its troops from occupied [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] to fight the comuneros, and [[Francis I of France|King Francis I of France]] used the opportunity to [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre#1521 French invasion|invade with support from the Navarrese]].  The royalist army was forced to march on Navarre to respond rather than besiege Toledo.  Acu\u00f1a left Toledo to travel to Navarre, but he was recognized and caught.

She requested the intervention of her uncle, the respected [[Diego L\u00f3pez Pacheco|Marquis of Villena]], to negotiate with the Royal Council, hoping he would be able to obtain better concessions.  The Marquis eventually abandoned the negotiations, and Mar\u00eda Pacheco took on personal negotiations with [[Antonio de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga|Prior Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]], the commander of the besieging forces.  Her demands, though somewhat galling to honor, were ultimately minor, such as guaranteeing the property and reputation of her children.<ref name=\"seaver346\">[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 346\u2013347.</ref>\n\nStill concerned about the French, the royal government gave in.  With the support of all parties, the surrender of Toledo was orchestrated on October 25, 1521.

Protests emerged when the Flemish adviser [[Jean de Sauvage]] was named its president, presaging later troubles.]]\nThe '''Revolt of the Comuneros''' ({{lang-es|Guerra de las Comunidades de Castilla}}, \"War of the Communities of Castile\") was an uprising by citizens of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] against the rule of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]] and his administration between 1520 and 1521. At its height, the rebels controlled the heart of Castile, ruling the cities of [[Valladolid]], [[Tordesillas]], and [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]].\n\nThe revolt occurred in the wake of political instability in the [[Crown of Castile]] after the death of Queen [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella I]] in 1504. Isabella's daughter [[Joanna of Castile|Joanna]] succeeded to the throne. Due to Joanna's mental instability, Castile was ruled by the nobles and her father, King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], as a [[regent]]. After Ferdinand's death in 1516, Joanna's sixteen-year-old son Charles was proclaimed king of both Castile and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]].  Charles had been raised in the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Netherlands]] with little knowledge of [[Castilian language|Castilian]].  He arrived in Spain in October 1517 accompanied by a large retinue of Flemish nobles and clerics.  These factors resulted in mistrust between the new king and the Castilian social elites, who could see the threat to their power and status.\n\nIn 1519, Charles was elected [[Holy Roman Emperor]].  He departed for Germany in 1520, leaving the Dutch cardinal [[Adrian of Utrecht]] to rule Castile in his absence.  Soon, a series of anti-government riots broke out in the cities, and local city councils (''Comunidades'') took power.  The rebels chose Charles' own mother, Queen Joanna, as an alternative ruler, hoping they could control her madness.  The rebel movement took on a radical [[manorialism|anti-feudal]] dimension, supporting peasant rebellions against the landed nobility.  On April 23, 1521, after nearly a year of rebellion, the reorganized supporters of the emperor struck a crippling blow to the comuneros at the [[Battle of Villalar]].  The following day, rebel leaders [[Juan L\u00f3pez de Padilla]], [[Juan Bravo]], and [[Francisco Maldonado]] were beheaded.  The army of the comuneros fell apart.  Only the city of Toledo kept alive the rebellion led by [[Mar\u00eda Pacheco]], until its surrender in October 1521.\n\nThe character of the revolution is a matter of historiographical debate.  According to some scholars, the revolt was one of the first modern revolutions, notably because of the anti-noble sentiment against social injustice and its basis on ideals of democracy and freedom.  Others consider it a more typical rebellion against high taxes and perceived foreign control.  From the 19th century onwards, the revolt has been mythologized by various Spaniards, generally liberals who drew political inspiration from it.  Conservative intellectuals have traditionally adopted more pro-Imperial stances toward the revolt, and have been critical of both the motives and the government of the comuneros.  With [[Spanish transition to democracy|the end of Franco's dictatorship]] and the establishment of the [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]], positive commemoration of the ''Comunidades'' has grown.  April 23 is now celebrated as [[Castile and Le\u00f3n Day]], and the incident is often referred to in [[Castilian nationalism]].\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Bernard van Orley (1487-1541) Karel V - Koninklijk klooster van Brou (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|alt=A young Charles V.|A 1516 portrait of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles I of Castile and Aragon]], later Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, by [[Bernard van Orley]].

The second half of the 15th century saw profound political, economic, and social changes in Spain.  Economic growth created new urban industries and offered a route to power and wealth not tied to the aristocracy.

The remaining heir was Ferdinand and Isabella's grandson [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]], who became King Charles I of both [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] in [[coregency]] with his mother Joanna.  Charles was brought up in [[Flanders]], the homeland of his father Philip, and barely knew Castilian.<ref>[[#Lyn64|Lynch 1964]], p. 36.</ref> The people greeted him with skepticism, but also hoped he would restore stability.  With the arrival of the new king in late 1517, [[List of people associated with the Revolt of the Comuneros#Royal Council and Advisers|his Flemish court]] took positions of power in Castile; young Charles only trusted people he knew from the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Netherlands]].  Among the most scandalous of these was the appointment of the twenty-year-old [[William de Cro\u00ff (bishop)|William de Cro\u00ff]] as [[Archbishop of Toledo]].  The Archbishopric was an important position; it had been held by [[Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros|Archbishop Cisneros]], the former regent of the country.<ref>[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 126.</ref><ref name=\"Lynch38\" /> Six months into his rule, discontent openly simmered among rich and poor alike.  Even some monks began to agitate, denouncing the opulence of the royal court, the Flemish, and the nobility in their sermons.  One of the first public protests involved placards posted in churches, which read:\n{{quote|You, land of Castile, very wretched and damned are you to suffer that as noble a kingdom as you are, you will be governed by those who have no love for you.<ref>[[#Die77|J.

A new election had to be held to choose the next emperor.

Briefly, ''servicios'' were flat monetary grants paid to the treasury; the ''encabezamiento'' was a portion of the sales tax towns collected sent to the government; and the ''cruzada'' (\"crusade\") was a special and semi-voluntary contribution that counted as an [[indulgence]] and was generally used for war against the Muslims.  Charles wanted to abolish the lenient ''encabezamiento'' and return to an older and harsher system of direct royal control of tolls, pasturage fees, and the like.  He also requested large ''servicios'' at the Cortes he held.  Part of the revenue problem the government had was that income from the ''cruzada'' had fallen greatly since the [[Reconquista]] had finished in 1492.<ref name=\"hal147\" />}} had to be raised to cover the debt, but any new taxes had to be approved by the ''[[Cortes Generales#History of the Cortes|Cortes]]'' (Castile's own parliamentary body).  Thus, in late March 1520, Charles convened the Cortes in [[Santiago de Compostela]].  Charles ensured the Cortes would only have limited power, and further attempted to stack the Cortes with pliable representatives he could bribe.<ref name=\"Lynch38\" /> Support for the opposition only increased in response, and the representatives demanded that their grievances be heard first before any new tax was granted.<ref name=\"Hal159\">[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 159.</ref>\n\nA group of clerics soon circulated a statement in protest of the king.

In response, Charles decided to suspend the Cortes on April 4.<ref>[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 75.</ref> He convened them again in [[a Coru\u00f1a|Corunna]] <!--See talk page for why Corunna is used, not A/La Coru\u00f1a.--> on April 22, this time getting his program passed.<ref name=\"Lynch38\" /> On May 20, he embarked for Germany, and left as regent of his Spanish possessions his former tutor, Adrian of Utrecht (better known as the future Pope Adrian VI).<ref>[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 77\u201379.</ref>\n\n==Beginnings of the Revolt==\n===Rebelliousness in Toledo===\n[[File:Toledo Skyline Panorama, Spain - Dec 2006.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=A cityscape; two tall buildings dominate the view, the Alc\u00e1zar and the Cathedral.|Toledo, home of the first ''Comunidad'']]\n[[File:Juan de Padilla.gif|thumb|175px|alt=A bearded man wearing a feathered cap, armor, and sash.|[[Juan L\u00f3pez de Padilla]], leader of the ''Comunidad'' of Toledo]]\nIn April 1520, [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] was already unstable.  The city council had been at the forefront of protests against Charles' bid to become Holy Roman Emperor.  They decried the short-term expenses that would be borne by [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and questioned the role of Castile in this new political framework, given the possibility that the land would become a mere imperial province.<ref name=\"Perez39\" /> The situation erupted when the royal government summoned the most radical of the city councilors away from the city, intending to send back more easily controllable replacements on a royal salary.  The order came on April 15; one day later, as the councilors prepared to leave, a large crowd opposed to the departure rioted and drove out the royal administrators instead.<ref>[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 160.</ref> A citizen's committee was elected under the leadership of [[Juan L\u00f3pez de Padilla]] and [[Pedro Laso de la Vega]], naming themselves a ''Comunidad''.

The defending forces had long since left by then.</ref>\n\nFollowing Charles' departure to Germany, the riots multiplied in the cities of [[Geography of Spain#The Inner Plateau and associated mountains|central Castile]], especially after the arrival of legislators who had voted \"yes\" to the taxes Charles had asked for.  [[Segovia]] had some of the earliest and most violent incidents; on May 30, a mob of woolworkers murdered two administrators and the city's legislator who had voted in favor.<ref>[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 3.</ref> Incidents of a similar size occurred in cities such as [[Burgos]] and [[Guadalajara, Spain|Guadalajara]], while others, such as [[Le\u00f3n, Spain|Le\u00f3n]], [[\u00c1vila, Spain|\u00c1vila]], and [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]], suffered minor altercations.<ref>[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 50\u201352.</ref>\n\n===Proposals to other cities===\nWith widespread discontent circulating, on June 8 Toledo's council suggested to cities with a vote in the Cortes to hold an emergency meeting.  They proffered five goals:\n# Cancel the taxes voted in the Cortes of Corunna.\n# A return to the local-controlled ''[[#endnote Anone|encabezamiento]]'' system of taxation.\n# Reserve official positions and church [[benefice]]s for Castilians.\n# Prohibit money from leaving the kingdom to fund foreign affairs.\n# Designate a Castilian to lead the kingdom in the absence of the king.<ref name=\"perez53\">[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 53\u201354.</ref>\n\nThese claims, especially the first two, spread quickly through society.<ref name=\"perez53\" /> Ideas began to circulate of replacing the king; Toledo's leaders floated the possibility of turning the cities of Castile into independent [[City-state|free cities]], similar to [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and other [[Repubbliche Marinare|Italian republics]].<ref name=\"perez53\" /> Competing proposals suggested keeping the monarchy, but dethroning Charles.  They proposed that he be replaced by either his mother Queen Joanna or his Castilian-born brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]].<ref name=\"Hal159\" /> With these ideas, the revolt shifted from a simple protest against taxes to a broader revolution.  Many cities, while not quite in outright revolt, stopped sending taxes to the Royal Council and began to self-govern.<ref name=\"hal164\">[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 164.</ref>\n\n==Expansion of the Revolt==\n===Blockade of Segovia===\n[[File:AcueductoSegovia edit1.jpg|thumb|alt=A stone aqueduct bordered by a modern road and smaller houses.|Segovia, the city of the first armed clash between the comuneros and the royalists]]\nThe situation moved closer to armed conflict on June 10.  [[Rodrigo Ronquillo]] had been sent to Segovia by the [[Council of Castile|Royal Council]] to investigate the recent murder of Segovia's legislator, but Segovia refused him entry.  Unable to besiege a city of 30,000 with only a small force, Ronquillo instead set out to blockade foodstuffs and other supplies from entering Segovia.  The people of Segovia, led by militia leader and noble Juan Bravo, rallied around the ''Comunidad''.  Segovia requested aid against Ronquillo's army from the ''Comunidades'' of Toledo and Madrid.  The cities responded by sending their militias, captained by Juan L\u00f3pez de Padilla and [[Juan de Zapata]], who won in the first major confrontation between the forces of the king and the rebels.<ref name=\"hal163\"/>\n\n===The Junta of \u00c1vila===\nOther cities now followed the lead of Toledo and Segovia, deposing their governments.  A revolutionary Cortes, {{lang|es|La Santa Junta de las Comunidades}} (\"Holy Assembly of the Communities\"),{{efn|''[[wikt:junta|Junta]]'', meaning \"Congress\" or \"Assembly,\" did not yet have the negative connotation of \"Oligarchical military dictatorship\" in the 16th century.}} held its first session in [[\u00c1vila, Spain|\u00c1vila]] and declared itself the legitimate government deposing the Royal Council.  Padilla was named Captain-General, and troops were assembled.  Still, only four cities sent representatives at first: Toledo, Segovia, Salamanca, and Toro.<ref>[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 166.</ref>\n\n===Burning of Medina del Campo===\n[[File:Medinapano03.jpg|thumb|alt=A stone castle, surrounded by an empty moat.|The ''[[Castillo de la Mota]]'' of [[Medina del Campo]]]]\nFaced with the situation in Segovia, Regent and Cardinal [[Adrian of Utrecht]] decided to use the royal artillery, located in nearby [[Medina del Campo]], to take Segovia and defeat Padilla.  Adrian ordered his commander [[Antonio de Fonseca]] to seize the artillery.<ref name=\"hal165\">[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 165.</ref> Fonseca arrived on August 21 in Medina, but encountered heavy resistance from the townspeople, as the city had strong trade links to Segovia.

Much of the town was destroyed, including a [[Franciscan]] monastery and a trade warehouse containing goods valued at more than 400,000 [[ducat]]s.<ref name=\"sea129\" /> Fonseca had to withdraw his troops, and the event was a public relations disaster for the government.<ref name=\"sea129\">[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 129.</ref><ref name=\"Halp6\" /> Uprisings throughout Castile occurred, even in cities that previously had been neutral such as Castile's capital, [[Valladolid]].  The establishment of the ''Comunidad'' of Valladolid caused the most important core of the [[Geography of Spain#The Inner Plateau and associated mountains|Iberian plateau]] to declare for the rebels, upending the stability of the government.

Since most of the kingdom was represented at Tordesillas, the Junta renamed itself the {{lang|es|[[Cortes Generales|Cortes y Junta General del Reino]]}} (\"General Assembly of the Kingdom\").<ref>[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 61.

The next day, September 25, the Cortes issued a declaration pledging to use arms if necessary and for the whole to aid any one city that was threatened.  On September 26, the Cortes of Tordesillas declared itself the new legitimate government and denounced the Royal Council.  Oaths of self-defense were taken by all the cities represented over the week, finishing by September 30.  The revolutionary government now had structure and a free hand to act, with the Royal Council still ineffective and confused.<ref>[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 179.</ref>\n\n===Scope of the rebellion===\n[[File:Escultura en bronce de Juan de Padilla, obra del escultor toledano Julio Mart\u00edn de Vidales.jpg|thumb|right|Bronze sculpture of Juan de Padilla in Toledo]]\nThe comuneros were strong in the [[Geography of Spain#The Inner Plateau and associated mountains|central plateau of the Iberian Peninsula]], as well as scattered other places such as [[Murcia]].  The rebels sought to propound their revolutionary ideas to the rest of the kingdom, but without much success.  There were few attempts at rebellion elsewhere, such as in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] to the northwest or in [[Andalusia]] to the south.<ref name=\"perez146\">[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 146\u2013147.</ref>  ''Comunidades'' in the south were set up in [[Ja\u00e9n, Spain|Ja\u00e9n]], [[\u00dabeda]], and [[Baeza]], unique in Andalusia, but with time they were drawn back into the royalists.  Murcia stayed with the rebel cause, but did not coordinate much with the Junta, and the rebellion there had a character closer to the nearby [[Revolt of the Brotherhoods]] in [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] in [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]].<ref>[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 155.</ref> In [[Extremadura]] to the southwest, the city of [[Plasencia]] joined the  ''Comunidades'', but this was undermined by the close proximity of other royalist cities such as [[Ciudad Rodrigo]] and [[C\u00e1ceres, Spain|C\u00e1ceres]].<ref name=\"perez146\" /> A close correlation can be drawn between poor economic fortunes over the previous twenty years and the rebellion; central Castile suffered from agricultural failure and other setbacks under the Royal Council, while Andalusia was relatively prosperous with its maritime trade.  Andalusia's leadership also feared that in the instability of a civil war, the [[Moriscos]] of Granada would likely revolt.<ref>[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 183, 205.</ref>\n\n{{wide image|ComunerosCityControl.png|760px|alt=Map of Spain with cities colored by affiliation; see text for details.|3=The rebels were strongest in the central plateau of Spain; the royalists controlled Andalusia in the South and Galicia in the North.

He spearheaded the recruitment of nobility to the royalist side, and two Castilian co-regents were appointed to lessen the appearance of foreign control.]]\n\n===Turning of the nobles===\nThe growing success of the comuneros emboldened people to accuse members of the old government of complicity with royal abuses.  The protests attacked the landed nobility as well, many of whom had illegally taken property during the reign of the regents and weak kings after Isabella's death.  In [[Due\u00f1as, Palencia|Due\u00f1as]], the Count of Buend\u00eda's vassals revolted against him on September 1, 1520, encouraged by rebel monks.<ref name=\"Halp185\" /> This uprising was followed by others of a similar anti-feudal nature.<ref>[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 65.</ref> The leadership of the comuneros was forced to take a stance on these new rebellions; reluctant to openly endorse them, the Junta initially denounced them but did nothing to oppose them.<ref>[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 306.</ref> The dynamics of the uprising thus changed profoundly, as it could now jeopardize the status of the entire [[Manorialism|manorial system]].  The nobles had previously been somewhat sympathetic to the cause due to their loss of privileges to the central government.  However, these new developments lead to a dramatic drop in support for the comuneros from aristocrats, who were frightened by the more radical elements of the revolution.<ref name=\"Halp185\">[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 185.</ref>\n\n===Response of Charles V===\nAt first, Charles seemed not to grasp the magnitude of the revolt.  He continued to demand payments from Castile; with the government of Castile still in arrears, Cardinal Adrian found it impossible to secure any new loans.<ref name=\"hal164\" /> A letter from Cardinal Adrian on August 25 warned Charles of the severity of the situation:\n\n{{quote|Your Highness is making a great error if you think that you will be able to collect and make use of this tax; there is no one in the Kingdom, not in Seville or Valladolid or any other city who will ever pay anything of it; all the grandees and members of the council are amazed that Your Highness has scheduled payments from these funds.<ref name=\"hal164\" />|[[Adrian of Utrecht]]}}\n\nOnce he realized that a full-fledged revolution was underway, Charles responded vigorously.  Through Cardinal Adrian, he undertook new policy initiatives, such as canceling the taxes granted in the Cortes of Corunna.  Most important was the appointment of two new Castilian co-regents: the [[Constable of Castile]], [[\u00cd\u00f1igo Fern\u00e1ndez]], and the [[Admiral of Castile]], [[Fadrique Enr\u00edquez]].<ref>[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 155\u2013156.</ref> This negated two of the most salient complaints of the rebels.  In addition, Adrian approached the nobles to convince them that their best interests lay with the king.  The Royal Council was re-established in the fief of Admiral Enr\u00edquez, [[Medina de Rioseco]], which enabled the Council to be nearer to the revolting cities and reassure skeptical supporters.<ref>[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 163.</ref> While the royal army was still in tatters, many high nobles maintained their own well-trained mercenary armies\u2014armies that with the revolt's recent radicalization would now fight for the king.<ref name=\"Halp6\" />\n\n==Organization, funding, and diplomacy==\nThe first political defeats of the comuneros came in October 1520.  The comuneros' attempt to use Queen Joanna for legitimacy did not bear fruit, as she blocked their initiatives and refused to sign any edicts.<ref>[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 156.</ref> In turn, dissenting voices inside the comuneros now began to be heard, especially in [[Burgos]].  The wavering position of Burgos was soon known to the royalists, and the Constable of Castile negotiated with Burgos's government.  The Royal Council granted a number of significant concessions to Burgos in exchange for them leaving the Junta.<ref>[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 215.</ref>\n\nFollowing this incident, the Royal Council hoped that other cities would imitate Burgos and leave the comuneros peacefully.  Valladolid, the former seat of royal power, was considered especially likely to turn, but too many supporters of the king had left city politics and lost their influence.  It remained rebel-controlled.<ref>[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 179.</ref> The Admiral of Castile continued his campaign to try to convince the comuneros to return to the royal government and thereby avoid a violent suppression.<ref>[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 192\u2013195.</ref> This attitude concealed a great shortage of funds on the royal side.<ref name=\"hal181\">[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 181.</ref>\n\nDuring October and November 1520, both sides accepted that a military conclusion would soon be necessary and actively devoted themselves to fundraising, recruiting soldiers, and training their troops.  The comuneros organized their militias in the major cities and levied new taxes on the countryside; they also took measures aimed at eliminating waste, routinely auditing their treasurers and dismissing those thought to be corrupt.<ref>[[#Hal81|Haliczer 1981]], p. 170.</ref> The royal government, which had lost much of its revenue due to the revolt, sought loans from [[Portugal]] and from conservative Castilian bankers, who saw reassuring signs in the switch of the allegiance of Burgos.<ref name=\"hal181\" />\n\n==Battle of Tordesillas==\n{{main|Military history of the Revolt of the Comuneros#Battle of Tordesillas}}\n\n===Leadership disputes===\n[[File:BattleofTordesillas.PNG|thumb|right|310px|alt=Map of army maneuvers.

[[Pedro T\u00e9llez-Gir\u00f3n, 3rd Count of Ure\u00f1a|Pedro Gir\u00f3n]]'s rebel force was larger but slower, with 10,000 infantry, 900 cavalry, and 13 artillery pieces.  The rebels' deficiency in cavalry would hurt them throughout the war.<ref name=\"seaver200\" />]]\nGradually, both the city of Toledo and its leader Juan L\u00f3pez de Padilla lost influence within the Junta, though Padilla retained popularity and prestige among the commoners.  Two new figures emerged within the ''Comunidades'', [[Pedro T\u00e9llez-Gir\u00f3n, 3rd Count of Ure\u00f1a|Pedro Gir\u00f3n]] and [[Antonio Osorio de Acu\u00f1a]].  Gir\u00f3n was one of the most powerful nobles who supported the comuneros; his rebellion is thought to originate from Charles' refusal to grant Gir\u00f3n the prestigious [[Dukes of Medina Sidonia|Duchy of Medina-Sidonia]] a year prior to the war.  Antonio de Acu\u00f1a was the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Zamora in Spain|Bishop of Zamora]].  Acu\u00f1a was also the head of the ''Comunidad'' in Zamora and the leader of its army, which included more than 300 priests.<ref>[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 75.</ref><ref name=\"Alfonso Guilarte\">[[#Gui83|Guilarte 1983]].</ref>\n\nOn the royalist side, the nobles could not agree on what tactics to use.  Some preferred to directly challenge the rebels in combat, while others such as the Constable of Castile favored continued waiting and the building of defensive fortifications.  The Admiral of Castile preferred negotiations and exhausting all the possible peaceful options first.<ref>[[#Lyn64|Lynch 1964]], p. 40.</ref> Patience, however, began to run thin; armies were expensive to maintain once assembled.

The small rebel garrison was overwhelmed.<ref name=\"seaver200\">[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 200\u2013202.</ref>\n\nSeizure of Tordesillas marked a serious defeat for the comuneros, who lost [[Joanna of Castile|Queen Joanna]] and with her their claim to legitimacy. In addition, thirteen representatives of the Junta were imprisoned, though others fled and escaped.<ref name=\"hal189\" /> Morale fell among the rebels, and much angry criticism was directed towards Pedro Gir\u00f3n for his maneuvering of the troops out of position and for his failure to attempt to retake Tordesillas or capture Medina de Rioseco.

The Junta reconvened on December 15, but with only eleven cities represented, down from a height of fourteen.  Soria and Guadalajara's representatives did not return, and Burgos had left earlier.<ref>[[#Per70|P\u00e9rez 1970]], p. 262.

This forced the rebels to intensify their recruitment drives, especially in Toledo, Salamanca, and Valladolid itself.  With these new recruits and the arrival of Juan de Padilla to Valladolid, the rebel military apparatus was rebuilt and morale bolstered.  At the beginning of 1521, the comuneros prepared for an all-out war, despite disagreements within the movement.  Some suggested seeking a peaceful resolution, while others favored continuing the war.  Those who favored war were divided between two tactics: occupy [[Simancas]] and [[Torrelobat\u00f3n]], a less ambitious proposal defended by [[Pedro Laso de la Vega]]; or lay siege to Burgos, a tactic favored by Padilla.<ref>[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 99</ref>\n\n===Military initiatives in Palencia and Burgos===\n[[File:Burgos Santa Maria Arc.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=An ornate stone gate with statues.|[[Arco de Santa Mar\u00eda]] in [[Burgos]], one of the few cities loyal to the king on the Iberian plateau]]\n\nIn the far north of Castile, the rebel army began a series of operations conducted by [[Antonio Osorio de Acu\u00f1a|Antonio de Acu\u00f1a]], bishop of Zamora.  They received orders from the Junta on December 23 to try and raise a rebellion in [[Palencia (province)|Palencia]].  They were tasked with expelling royalists, collecting taxes on behalf of the Junta, and creating an administration sympathetic to the comuneros cause. Acu\u00f1a's army made a series of raids into the area around [[Due\u00f1as, Palencia|Due\u00f1as]], raising more than 4,000 ducats and inspiring the peasantry.  He returned to Valladolid in early 1521, then came back to Due\u00f1as on January 10 to begin a major offensive against the nobles of [[Tierra de Campos]].  The nobles' land and holdings were completely devastated.<ref name=\"Alfonso Guilarte\" /><ref name=\"perez105\" />\n\nIn mid-January, Pedro de Ayala, Count of Salvatierra, joined the comuneros and organized an army of about two thousand men who set about raiding the north of Castile.<ref name=\"seaver294\">[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 294</ref> Nearby, Burgos awaited the fulfillment of the pledges made by Cardinal Adrian after they had joined the royalist cause two months prior.  The slow response led to dissatisfaction and uncertainty in the city.  Ayala and Acu\u00f1a, aware of this situation, decided to besiege Burgos, Ayala from its north and Acu\u00f1a from its south.  They also sought to undermine the defenses by encouraging a revolt of the inhabitants of Burgos.<ref name=\"perez105\">[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 105</ref>\n\n===Royalist response===\nStill in Germany, Charles V issued the Edict of Worms on December 17, 1520 (not to be confused with the [[Edict of Worms]] of May 25, 1521, against [[Martin Luther]]), which condemned 249 prominent ''Comunidad'' members. For secular rebels, the punishment was death; clergy were to receive lighter penalties. Similarly, the edict also declared that those who supported the ''Comunidades'' were traitors, disloyal, rebels, and infidels.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/historia/CarlosV/7_1_14.shtml |title=Texto \u00edntegro del Edicto de Worms |publisher=Cervantes Virtual Library |date=December 17, 1520 |accessdate=2008-07-20 |language=Spanish }}</ref>\n\nThe Royal Council's next move was the occupation of [[Ampudia]] in Palencia, a town loyal to the Count of Salvatierra. The Junta sent Padilla to meet Acu\u00f1a; their combined force besieged the royal army at [[Torremormoj\u00f3n|the castle of Mormoj\u00f3n]]. The royal army slipped away by nightfall, and Mormoj\u00f3n was forced to pay tribute to avoid being pillaged.

The comuneros of Burgos had to surrender, and this was the last rebellion to be seen in Castile.<ref name=\"perez105\" /><ref name=\"seaver228\" />\n\n==Rebel campaigns of early 1521==\n\n===Padilla's decision on the rebels' next move===\n[[File:Castillo de Torrelobat\u00f3n (torre del homenaje).jpg|thumb|alt=A stone tower at the corner of the defensive walls.|The taking of the [[Castle of Torrelobat\u00f3n]], built in the 13th century, provided a much-needed victory for the comuneros.

With this series of actions, Acu\u00f1a intended to destroy or occupy the homes of the prominent nobles.  The rebels now set themselves completely against the [[manorialism|manorial system]].  This would be one of the strongest features of the second phase of the rebellion.<ref name=\"seaver228\" />\n\nAfter the recent setbacks suffered by the comuneros, Padilla realized that they needed a victory to raise morale.  He decided to take [[Torrelobat\u00f3n]] and its castle.  Torrelobat\u00f3n was a stronghold halfway between Tordesillas and Medina de Rioseco, and was very close to Valladolid.  Taking it would grant the rebels an excellent fortress for launching military operations and remove a threat on Valladolid.<ref>[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 248.</ref>\n\n===Battle of Torrelobat\u00f3n===\nOn February 21, 1521, the [[Military history of the Revolt of the Comuneros#Battle of Torrelobat\u00f3n|siege of Torrelobat\u00f3n]] began.  Outnumbered, the town nevertheless resisted for four days, thanks to its walls.  On February 25, the comuneros entered the town and subjected it to a massive looting spree as a reward to the troops.  Only churches were spared.<ref>[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 251.</ref> The castle resisted for another two days. The comuneros then threatened to [[hanging|hang]] all of the inhabitants, at which point the castle surrendered.  The defenders did secure an agreement to spare half of the goods inside the castle, thus avoiding further looting.<ref>[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 107.  \"Los asaltantes amenzaron con ahorcar a todos los inhabitantes si no se rend\u00eda.\"</ref>\n\nThe victory in Torrelobat\u00f3n lifted the spirits of the rebel camp while worrying the royalists about the rebel advance, exactly as Padilla hoped.  The faith of the nobles in Cardinal Adrian was again shaken, as he was accused of having done nothing to avoid losing Torrelobat\u00f3n.  The Constable of Castile began to send troops to the Tordesillas area to contain the rebels and prevent any further advances.<ref name=\"perez110\">[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 110.</ref>\n\nDespite the renewed enthusiasm among the rebels, a decision was made to remain in their positions near Valladolid without pressing their advantage or launching a new attack.  This caused many of the soldiers to return to their home communities, tired of waiting for salaries and new orders.<ref>[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 109.</ref> This was a problem the comunero forces had throughout the war; they possessed only a small number of full-time soldiers, and their militias were constantly \"dissolving and recruiting.\"<ref>[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 319.</ref> A serious attempt to negotiate a peaceful end to the war was tried again by the moderates, but was undercut by extremists of both sides.<ref>[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 278.</ref>\n\nIn the north, after the failure of the siege of Burgos in January, the Count of Salvatierra resumed his campaign.

He traveled south, declaring his impending claim on the archdiocese to every village as he passed.  This raised enthusiasm among the commoners, who received him with cheers, but aroused suspicion in the aristocracy.  They feared Acu\u00f1a might attack their holdings as he did in [[Tierra de Campos]].  The [[Diego L\u00f3pez Pacheco|Marquis of Villena]] and [[Diego Hurtado de Mendoza y Luna|Duke of Infantado]] contacted Acu\u00f1a and persuaded him to sign a pact of mutual neutrality.<ref name=\"perez114\">[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 114\u2013115.</ref>\n\nAcu\u00f1a soon had to confront [[Antonio de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]], who had been appointed commander of the royalist army in the Toledo area.  Z\u00fa\u00f1iga was a [[prior]] in the [[Knights of St. John]], who maintained a base in Castile at the time.<ref>[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 116</ref> Acu\u00f1a received information that Z\u00fa\u00f1iga was in the area of [[Corral de Almaguer]], and pursued battle with him near [[Tembleque]].  Z\u00fa\u00f1iga drove the rebel forces off, and then launched a counterattack of his own between [[Lillo, Spain|Lillo]] and [[El Romeral]], inflicting a crushing defeat on Acu\u00f1a.  Acu\u00f1a, a relentless self-promoter, tried to minimize the loss and even claimed that he had emerged victorious from the confrontation.<ref name=\"Alfonso Guilarte\" /><ref name=\"seaver332\">[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 332.</ref>\n\nUndaunted, Acu\u00f1a continued into Toledo.  He appeared at the [[Zocodover Plaza]] in the heart of the city on March 29, 1521, [[Good Friday]].  The crowd gathered around him and took him directly to the cathedral, claiming the archbishop's chair for him.<ref name=\"Alfonso Guilarte\" /><ref name=\"seaver333\">[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 333\u2013334.</ref> The next day he met with [[Mar\u00eda Pacheco]], wife of Juan de Padilla and ''de facto'' leader of the Toledo ''Comunidad'' in her husband's absence.

After royalist troops burned the town of [[Mora, Spain|Mora]] on April 12, Acu\u00f1a returned to the countryside with roughly 1,500 men under his command.  He moved into [[Yepes]], and from there conducted raids and operations against royalist-controlled rural areas.  He first attacked and pillaged [[Villaseca de la Sagra]], then faced Z\u00fa\u00f1iga again in an inconclusive battle near the [[Tagus river]] in [[Illescas, Toledo|Illescas]].<ref name=\"perez122\">[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 122.</ref> Light skirmishing near Toledo would continue until news of Villalar ended the war.<ref name=\"perez122\" />\n\n==Battle of Villalar==\n{{main|Battle of Villalar}}\n[[File:BatallaDeVillalar.jpg|right|thumb|300px|alt=Soldiers and cannon on the battlefield; an officer on a white horse points to direct his men.|A 19th century work by [[Manuel Picolo L\u00f3pez]] depicting the [[Battle of Villalar]]]]\nIn early April 1521, the royalist side moved to combine their armies and threaten Torrelobat\u00f3n.  The [[Constable of Castile]] moved his troops (including soldiers recently transferred from the defense of Navarre) southwest from Burgos to meet with the [[Fadrique Enr\u00edquez|Admiral]]'s forces near Tordesillas.<ref name=\"perez110\" /> Meanwhile, the comuneros reinforced their troops at Torrelobat\u00f3n, which was far less secure than the comuneros preferred.  Their forces were suffering from desertions, and the presence of royalist artillery would make Torrelobat\u00f3n's castle vulnerable. Juan L\u00f3pez de Padilla considered withdrawing to [[Toro, Spain|Toro]] to seek reinforcements in early April, but wavered.  He delayed his decision until the early hours of April 23, losing considerable time and allowing the royalists to unite their forces in [[Pe\u00f1aflor de Hornija|Pe\u00f1aflor]].<ref name=\"seaver324\">[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 324\u2013325.</ref><ref name=\"perezorig313\">[[#Per70|P\u00e9rez 1970]], p. 313\u2013314.</ref>\n\nThe combined royalist army pursued the comuneros. Again, the royalists had a strong advantage in cavalry, with their army consisting of 6,000 infantry and 2,400 cavalry against Padilla's 7,000 infantry and 400 cavalry.  Heavy rain slowed Padilla's infantry more than the royalist cavalry and rendered the primitive firearms of the rebels' 1,000 [[arquebusiers]] nearly useless.<ref name=\"seaver324\" /> Padilla hoped to reach the relative safety of Toro and the heights of [[Vega de Valdetronco]], but his infantry was too slow.  He gave battle with the harrying royalist cavalry at the town of Villalar.  The cavalry charges scattered the rebel ranks, and the battle became a slaughter.  There were an estimated 500\u20131,000 rebel casualties and many desertions.<ref name=\"perezorig313\" />\n\nThe three most important leaders of the rebellion were captured: Juan L\u00f3pez de Padilla, Juan Bravo, and [[Francisco Maldonado]].  They were beheaded the next morning in the Plaza of Villalar, with a large portion of the royalist nobility present.<ref>[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 111.</ref> The remains of the rebel army at Villalar fragmented, with some attempting to join Acu\u00f1a's army near Toledo and others deserting.

The magnitude of the defeat became apparent in a few days, after the first survivors began arriving in the city and confirmed the fact that the three rebel leaders had been executed.  Toledo was declared in mourning over the death of Juan de Padilla.<ref>[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 123.</ref>\n\nAfter the death of Padilla, [[Antonio de Acu\u00f1a|Bishop Acu\u00f1a]] lost popularity in favour of [[Mar\u00eda Pacheco]], Padilla's widow.<ref>[[#Per01|P\u00e9rez 2001]], p. 128.</ref> People began to suggest negotiating with the royalists, seeking to avoid further suffering in the city.

Castile had withdrawn some of its troops from occupied [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] to fight the comuneros, and [[Francis I of France|King Francis I of France]] used the opportunity to [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre#1521 French invasion|invade with support from the Navarrese]].  The royalist army was forced to march on Navarre to respond rather than besiege Toledo.  Acu\u00f1a left Toledo to travel to Navarre, but he was recognized and caught.  It is disputed whether he was seeking to join the French and continue fighting, or was simply fleeing.<ref name=\"seaver336\">[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 336.</ref>\n\nMar\u00eda Pacheco took control of the city and the remains of the rebel army, living in the [[Alc\u00e1zar of Toledo|Alc\u00e1zar]], collecting taxes, and strengthening defenses.  She requested the intervention of her uncle, the respected [[Diego L\u00f3pez Pacheco|Marquis of Villena]], to negotiate with the Royal Council, hoping he would be able to obtain better concessions.  The Marquis eventually abandoned the negotiations, and Mar\u00eda Pacheco took on personal negotiations with [[Antonio de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga|Prior Z\u00fa\u00f1iga]], the commander of the besieging forces.  Her demands, though somewhat galling to honor, were ultimately minor, such as guaranteeing the property and reputation of her children.<ref name=\"seaver346\">[[#Sea28|Seaver 1928]], p. 346\u2013347.</ref>\n\nStill concerned about the French, the royal government gave in.  With the support of all parties, the surrender of Toledo was orchestrated on October 25, 1521.  Thus, on October 31 the comuneros left the Alc\u00e1zar of Toledo and new officials were appointed to run the city.  The truce guaranteed the freedom and property of all the comuneros.<ref name=\"seaver346\" />\n\n===Revolt of February 1522===\nThe new administrator of Toledo restored order and brought the city back under royal control.

Royal soldiers filled the city and the administrator ordered Pacheco's execution.<ref name=\"Perez131\" /> Riots broke out in protest.  The incident was temporarily remedied thanks to the intervention of Mar\u00eda de Mendoza, the sister of Mar\u00eda Pacheco.

Spain would provide the bulk of the Habsburgs' armies and financial resources over this period.  Charles placed Castilians in high governmental positions in both Castile and the Empire at large, and generally left the administration of Castile in Castilian hands.<ref name=\"Lynch46\" /> In that sense, the revolt could be considered successful.<ref name=\"Lynch46\">[[#Lyn64|Lynch 1964]], p. 46.</ref>\n\nSome of the reforms of [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella I]] which reduced noble power were reversed as a price for luring the nobility to the royalist side.

D\u00edez praised the comuneros on behalf of the [[Trienio Liberal|liberal government in power at the time]], likely the first positive governmental recognition for their cause.
