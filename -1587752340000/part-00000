{"title_page": "Cordilleran ice sheet", "text_new": "[[File:Map missoula floods.gif|thumb|right|350 px|Southern edge of the ice sheet. It extended north along the Pacific coast and covered the Alaska Peninsula.]]\n\nThe '''Cordilleran ice sheet''' was a major [[ice sheet]] that periodically covered large parts of [[North America]] during glacial periods over the last ~2.6 million years. This included the following areas:\n\n*[[Western Montana]]\n*The [[Idaho Panhandle]]\n*Northern [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] down to about [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]] and [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]]\n*All of [[British Columbia]]\n*The southwestern third or so of [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]]\n*All of the [[Southeast Alaska|Alaska Panhandle]]\n*[[South Central Alaska]]\n*The [[Alaska Peninsula]]\n*Almost all of the [[continental shelf]] north of the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]]\n\nThe ice sheet covered up to 2.5 million square kilometres at the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] and probably more than that in some previous periods, when it may have extended into the northeast extremity of [[Oregon]] and the Salmon River Mountains in Idaho. It is probable, though, that its northern margin also migrated south due to the influence of [[starvation (glaciology)|starvation]] caused by very low levels of precipitation.\n\nAt its eastern end the Cordilleran ice sheet merged with the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] at the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]], forming an area of ice that contained one and a half times as much water as the [[Antarctic ice sheet]] does today. At its western end it is currently understood that several small glacial [[Last Glacial Maximum refugia|refugia]] existed during the last glacial maximum below present [[sea level]] in the now-submerged [[Hecate Strait]] and on the [[Brooks Peninsula]] in northern [[Vancouver Island]]. However, evidence of ice-free refugia above present sea level north of the [[Olympic Peninsula]] has been refuted by genetic and geological studies since the middle 1990s. The ice sheet faded north of the [[Alaska Range]] because the climate was too dry to form [[glaciers]].\n\nUnlike the Laurentide Ice Sheet, which is believed to have taken as much as eleven thousand years to fully melt, it is believed the Cordilleran ice sheet, except for areas that remain glaciated today, melted very quickly, probably in four thousand years or less. This rapid melting caused such [[floods]] as the overflow of [[Lake Missoula]] and shaped the topography of the extremely fertile [[Inland Empire (Pacific Northwest)|Inland Empire]] of [[Eastern Washington]].\n\n==Sea levels during glaciation==\n\nBecause of the weight of the ice, the mainland of northwest North America was so depressed that sea levels at the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] were over a hundred metres higher than they are today (measured by the level of [[bedrock]]).\n\nHowever, on the western edge at the [[Haida Gwaii]] (formerly known as the Queen Charlotte Islands), the lower thickness of the ice sheet meant that sea levels were as much as 170 metres lower than they are today, forming a  [[lake]] in the deepest parts of the strait. This was because the much greater thickness of the center of the ice sheet served to push upwards areas at the edge of the continental shelf in a glacial [[forebulge]]. The effect of this during [[deglaciation]] was that sea levels on the edge of the ice sheet, which naturally deglaciated first, initially rose due to an increase in the volume of water, but later fell due to rebound after deglaciation. Some underwater features along the [[Pacific Northwest]] were exposed because of the lower sea levels, including [[Bowie Seamount]] west of Haida Gwaii which has been interpreted as an active volcanic island throughout the last ice age.\n\nThese effects are important because they have been used to explain how migrants to North America from [[Beringia]] were able to travel southward during the deglaciation process due purely to the exposure of submerged land between the mainland and numerous continental islands. They are also important for understanding the direction [[evolution]] has taken since the ice retreated.\n\nEven today, the region is notable for its rapid changes in sea level, which, however, have little effect on most of the coast due to the numerous [[fjords]].\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Geography of Canada]]\n* [[Ice sheet]]\n\n==References==\n* Hidy, A.

It extended north along the Pacific coast and covered the Alaska Peninsula.]]\n\nThe '''Cordilleran ice sheet''' was a major [[ice sheet]] that periodically covered large parts of [[North America]] during glacial periods over the last ~2.6 million years. This included the following areas:\n\n*[[Western Montana]]\n*The [[Idaho Panhandle]]\n*Northern [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] down to about [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]] and [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]]\n*All of [[British Columbia]]\n*The southwestern third or so of [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]]\n*All of the [[Southeast Alaska|Alaska Panhandle]]\n*[[South Central Alaska]]\n*The [[Alaska Peninsula]]\n*Almost all of the [[continental shelf]] north of the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]]\n\nThe ice sheet covered up to 2.5 million square kilometres at the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] and probably more than that in some previous periods, when it may have extended into the northeast extremity of [[Oregon]] and the Salmon River Mountains in Idaho. It is probable, though, that its northern margin also migrated south due to the influence of [[starvation (glaciology)|starvation]] caused by very low levels of precipitation.\n\nAt its eastern end the Cordilleran ice sheet merged with the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] at the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]], forming an area of ice that contained one and a half times as much water as the [[Antarctic ice sheet]] does today. At its western end it is currently understood that several small glacial [[Last Glacial Maximum refugia|refugia]] existed during the last glacial maximum below present [[sea level]] in the now-submerged [[Hecate Strait]] and on the [[Brooks Peninsula]] in northern [[Vancouver Island]]. However, evidence of ice-free refugia above present sea level north of the [[Olympic Peninsula]] has been refuted by genetic and geological studies since the middle 1990s. The ice sheet faded north of the [[Alaska Range]] because the climate was too dry to form [[glaciers]].\n\nUnlike the Laurentide Ice Sheet, which is believed to have taken as much as eleven thousand years to fully melt, it is believed the Cordilleran ice sheet, except for areas that remain glaciated today, melted very quickly, probably in four thousand years or less. This rapid melting caused such [[floods]] as the overflow of [[Lake Missoula]] and shaped the topography of the extremely fertile [[Inland Empire (Pacific Northwest)|Inland Empire]] of [[Eastern Washington]].\n\n==Sea levels during glaciation==\n\nBecause of the weight of the ice, the mainland of northwest North America was so depressed that sea levels at the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] were over a hundred metres higher than they are today (measured by the level of [[bedrock]]).\n\nHowever, on the western edge at the [[Haida Gwaii]] (formerly known as the Queen Charlotte Islands), the lower thickness of the ice sheet meant that sea levels were as much as 170 metres lower than they are today, forming a  [[lake]] in the deepest parts of the strait. This was because the much greater thickness of the centre of the ice sheet served to push upwards areas at the edge of the continental shelf in a glacial [[forebulge]]. The effect of this during [[deglaciation]] was that sea levels on the edge of the ice sheet, which naturally deglaciated first, initially rose due to an increase in the volume of water, but later fell due to rebound after deglaciation. Some underwater features along the [[Pacific Northwest]] were exposed because of the lower sea levels, including [[Bowie Seamount]] west of Haida Gwaii which has been interpreted as an active volcanic island throughout the last ice age.\n\nThese effects are important because they have been used to explain how migrants to North America from [[Beringia]] were able to travel southward during the deglaciation process due purely to the exposure of submerged land between the mainland and numerous continental islands. They are also important for understanding the direction [[evolution]] has taken since the ice retreated.\n\nEven today, the region is notable for its rapid changes in sea level, which, however, have little effect on most of the coast due to the numerous [[fjords]].\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Geography of Canada]]\n* [[Ice sheet]]\n\n==References==\n* Hidy, A.

The 52nd running of the [[Daytona 500]], it was held on February 14, 2010, in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], at [[Daytona International Speedway]], before a crowd of about 175,000 attendees. [[Chip Ganassi Racing|Earnhardt Ganassi Racing]] driver [[Jamie McMurray]] won the 208-lap race from the 13th position. [[Dale Earnhardt Jr.]] of [[Hendrick Motorsports]] finished in second, and [[Roush Fenway Racing]]'s [[Greg Biffle]] was third.\n\n[[Mark Martin]], the oldest [[pole position]] winner in event history at 51 years and 27 days, led the opening four laps before [[Kasey Kahne]] passed him on lap five. Martin retook the lead two laps later. The lead changed 52 times among a then record-breaking 21 different drivers during the course of the race, with [[Kevin Harvick]] leading the most laps (41). It was twice [[Racing flags#Red flag|stopped]] because a large [[pothole]] developed between turns one and two, due to moisture, cold weather, and heavy cars scraping the tarmac surface as they ran low to the ground for better [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] efficiency. Harvick led on the 206th lap, until McMurray passed to claim his first Daytona 500 victory, and the fourth of his career.\n\nBecause this was the first race of the season, McMurray led the [[List of Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series champions|Drivers' Championship]] with 195 [[List of NASCAR points scoring systems|points]], followed by Earnhardt in second place who had 175 points and Biffle in third with 170 points. [[Clint Bowyer]] and Harvick were fourth and fifth with 165 and 155 points, respectively. In the  [[List of NASCAR Manufacturers' champions|Manufacturers' Championship]], [[Chevrolet]] led with nine points, ahead of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in second place with six points. [[Toyota]] was in third with four points, and [[Dodge]] completed the top four with three points with thirty-five races left in the season.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Daytona International Speedway.svg|alt=Layout of Daytona International Speedway|thumb|left|[[Daytona International Speedway]], where the race was held]]\n\nThe 2010 [[Daytona 500]] was the 1st of the 36 [[Stock car racing|stock car races]] in the [[2010 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series]],<ref name=\"rr500\" /> and the 52nd edition of the event.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/os-xpm-2010-02-14-os-nascar-daytona-500-storylines-0214-20100214-story.html|title=NASCAR: Storylines to watch for the 52nd running of the Daytona 500|last=Ganguli|first=Tania|date=February 14, 2010|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|access-date=January 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190112110306/https://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/os-xpm-2010-02-14-os-nascar-daytona-500-storylines-0214-20100214-story.html|archive-date=January 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It was held on February 14, 2010, in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], at [[Daytona International Speedway]],<ref name=rr500/>  a [[Oval track racing|superspeedway]] track.<ref name=\"tacksnascar\">{{cite web|title=NASCAR Race Tracks|url=http://www.nascar.com/races/tracks/|accessdate=December 20, 2011|work=NASCAR|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105015851/http://www.nascar.com/races/tracks/|archivedate=January 5, 2013}}</ref> Its standard track is a four-turn, {{convert|2.5|mi|km|adj=on}} superspeedway.<ref name=\"daytrack\">{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/travel/news/story?id=2346804|title=Daytona International Speedway|date=June 27, 2011|publisher=[[ESPN]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120202142/http://espn.go.com/espn/thelife/news/story?id=2346804|archivedate=January 20, 2012|url-status=dead|accessdate=June 25, 2015}}</ref> Daytona's turns are banked at 31&nbsp;[[Degree (angle)|degrees]], and the [[Straight (racing)|front stretch]]\u2014the location of the finish line\u2014is banked at 18&nbsp;degrees.<ref name=daytrack />\n\n[[NASCAR]] founder [[Bill France Sr.]] conceived the Daytona 500,<ref name=nelson500>{{cite book|last=R.

The series is set to air all nine episodes in the UK on the 23 April 2020 on [[Sky Atlantic]], and in the US on [[Cinemax]]. The series was created by [[Gareth Evans (director)|Gareth Evans]], best known for ''[[The Raid (2011 film)|The Raid]]'' action crime films, along with Matt Flannery.\n\n==Premise==\nSet in the heart of [[London]], one of the world's most dynamic and multicultural cities, ''Gangs of London'' tells the story of the city being torn apart by the turbulent power struggles of the [[Gangs in the United Kingdom|international gangs]] that control it and the sudden power vacuum that's created when the head of London's most powerful crime family is assassinated.\n\nFor 20 years, Finn Wallace ([[Colm Meaney]]) was the most powerful criminal in London. Billions of pounds flowed through his organization each year. But now he's dead \u2013 and nobody knows who ordered the hit.

Retrieved on February 19, 2010.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|date=December 2016}}\nAl Connors (Loye Hawkins) is a [[private detective]] operating in [[Miami]], [[Florida]] that is contacted by a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer, David McLeod, in order to enlist Al's services to protect the wife of an African head of state in town for diplomatic business. McLeod suspects a security leak and feels the wife is under better protection out of CIA hands. Connors accepts the job and suggests posing as a newlywed couple at a local hotel.\n\nConnors meets the wife, Mrs. Ashanti, at the hotel and informs her of the ruse to which she's initially reluctant to participate in until Connors assures her it's for appearances only and doesn't have any inappropriate intentions towards her. Ashanti complains of a sore back, prompting Connors to call for a masseuse to come to their room.\n\nLater, Connors observes the masseuse at the window gesturing to a man on the sidewalk, raising his suspicions of her and prompting him to watch her perform her work even at the protest of Wanda and the masseuse. He turns out to be correct in his suspicions, as in a moment when he is out of the room the masseuse prepares a syringe. Connors enters the room in time, and the masseuse hastily hides the syringe back in her pocket. The masseuse leaves without incident and Connors orders some well-done New York strip steaks and [[Justerini & Brooks|J&B]] scotch from room service. While waiting for their room service to arrive, Connors explains to Mrs. Ashanti that he is from [[Harlem]] and that he learned how to be a detective in Harlem. He left, however, because there were too many detectives in Harlem. Mrs. Ashanti also mentions spending time in Harlem and thought it was a fantastic place.\n\nRoom service arrives and without provocation Connors knocks out the room service deliverer (who was a man dressed as a woman), claiming he can \"smell a New York Strip steak a block away\" and then reveals a gun hidden under the cover of one of the room service trays. Soon two more men enter the room; thugs working for a local crime kingpin \"Big Daddy\", who Connor quickly dispatches using his fighting and martial arts skills. Connors holds the gun to one the thug's head and makes him confess who sent him, and the thug reveals the name of the person who sent him is Big Daddy. Connors deems the hotel to be unsafe and leaves with Ashanti to a safer location.\n\nThe safer location turns out to be the apartment of Connor's current girlfriend, who is initially reluctant to leave but soon does so without objection. Ashanti continues to complain about her sore back and Connors offers to help her with his own massage knowledge eventually leading to he and Ashanti consummating their relationship on the bed of apartment's tenant. Presumably the next day, Connors safely delivers Ashanti back into the hands of the CIA and her husband, the head of state of an African nation.\n\nOn return to his office Connors expresses his intentions to have a \"goof-off day\" to his secretary but the intentions are soon dashed with the entrance of another potential client, this one being Harry De Bauld and small entourage of thugs. De Bauld is the leader of a local criminal organization and recently his daughter, Wanda, has been kidnapped by a rival gang, ran by a man known only as \"Big Daddy.\" Connors questions De Bauld about the mysterious Big Daddy, to which De Bauld can only provide a few details: Big Daddy is known for never pulling any of his own stunts, and physically, he has large muscles, and wears large bands around his muscles. A money/hostage exchange is set to occur and De Bauld loudly wishes Connors to exploit that exchange in order to recover his daughter, to carry it out Connors is given a large sum of cash for his services as well as a large amount of [[cocaine]], his end of the hostage exchange.\n\nConnors meets with one of Big Daddy's men in a local gym to set up the details of the exchange, but Connors uses that as a ruse to follow the man to the hide-out where they are holding Wanda. After taking out several of the men guarding the location as well as the man running the compound Connors is able to recover Wanda and he takes her with him to a safe hiding place.\n\nThe hiding place, once again, turns out to be his girlfriend's home whom he has to eject, this time at her great annoyance. Wanda and Connors talk some, Wanda revealing she's not happy with her father whose criminal activities had recently grown more intense with the involvement of [[drug trafficking]]. Wanda and Connors consummate their relationship on the bed of the apartment's tenant.\n\nThe following day, Connors delivers Wanda back into the hands of her father in his office but refuses to return the drugs trying to convince De Bauld to drop that aspect of his organization in order to repair the relationship with his daughter. Connors also wishes to meet with Big Daddy in order to put a stop to his activities once and for all.\n\nConnors and Big Daddy meet later to discuss their differences. Big Daddy tries to enlist Connors into his organization, but Connors refuses and the two fight. Connors is able to quickly defeat and kill Big Daddy and then leaves in the arms of Wanda, who had arrived with her brother to observe the fight and potentially aid Connors.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Loye Hawkins]] as Al Connors\n*[[Cathy Davis (actor)|Cathy Davis]] as Wanda De Bauld\n*[[Patricia Fulton]] as Mrs. Ashanti\n*[[Wanda Starr]] as Sue\n*[[Steve Gallon]] as Harry De Bauld\n*[[Laster Wilson]] as Larry De Bauld\n*[[Wayne Crawford]] as Big Daddy (as Scott Lawrence)\n*[[Vaughn Harris]] as David McLeod, CIA (as Vaughan Harris)\n*[[Richie Vallon]] as Jim\n*[[Michael Murrell]] as Paul Benson\n*[[Angela Schon]] as Jo Ann\n*[[Douglas Ferraro]] as Man #1\n*[[Fernando Yi]] as Man #2\n*[[Colleen Martinez]] as Masseuse\n*[[Hyatt Hodgdon]] as Mac\n*[[Mickeal Taylor]] as Special Man\n*[[Raff Prieto]] as Waitress\n*[[Lafon Hockaday]] as Health Spa Owner\n*[[Patrick Hackett]] as Health Spa Extra\n*[[Jesus Correa]] as Health Spa Extra\n*[[Douglas Brinson]] as Bellboy\n==Legacy==\n''The Guy from Harlem'' was the subject of a 2012 [[RiffTrax]].

Retrieved on February 19, 2010.</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|date=December 2016}}\nAl Connors (Loye Hawkins) is a [[private detective]] operating in [[Miami]], [[Florida]] that is contacted by a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer, David McLeod, in order to enlist Al's services to protect the wife of an African head of state in town for diplomatic business. McLeod suspects a security leak and feels the wife is under better protection out of CIA hands. Connors accepts the job and suggests posing as a newlywed couple at a local hotel.\n\nConnors meets the wife, Mrs. Ashanti, at the hotel and informs her of the ruse to which she's initially reluctant to participate in until Connors assures her it's for appearances only and doesn't have any inappropriate intentions towards her. Ashanti complains of a sore back, prompting Connors to call for a masseuse to come to their room.\n\nLater, Connors observes the masseuse at the window gesturing to a man on the sidewalk, raising his suspicions of her and prompting him to watch her perform her work even at the protest of Wanda and the masseuse. He turns out to be correct in his suspicions, as in a moment when he is out of the room the masseuse prepares a syringe. Connors enters the room in time, and the masseuse hastily hides the syringe back in her pocket. The masseuse leaves without incident and Connors orders some well-done New York strip steaks and [[Justerini & Brooks|J&B]] scotch from room service. While waiting for their room service to arrive, Connors explains to Mrs. Ashanti that he is from [[Harlem]] and that he learned how to be a detective in Harlem. He left, however, because there were too many detectives in Harlem. Mrs. Ashanti also mentions spending time in Harlem and thought it was a fantastic place.\n\nRoom service arrives and without provocation Connors knocks out the room service deliverer (who was a man dressed as a woman), claiming he can \"smell a New York Strip steak a block away\" and then reveals a gun hidden under the cover of one of the room service trays. Soon two more men enter the room; thugs working for a local crime kingpin \"Big Daddy\", who Connor quickly dispatches using his fighting and martial arts skills. Connors holds the gun to one the thug's head and makes him confess who sent him, and the thug reveals the name of the person who sent him is Big Daddy. Connors deems the hotel to be unsafe and leaves with Ashanti to a safer location.\n\nThe safer location turns out to be the apartment of Connor's current girlfriend, who is initially reluctant to leave but soon does so without objection. Ashanti continues to complain about her sore back and Connors offers to help her with his own massage knowledge eventually leading to he and Ashanti consummating their relationship on the bed of apartment's tenant. Presumably the next day, Connors safely delivers Ashanti back into the hands of the CIA and her husband, the head of state of an African nation.\n\nOn return to his office Connors expresses his intentions to have a \"goof-off day\" to his secretary but the intentions are soon dashed with the entrance of another potential client, this one being Harry De Bauld and small entourage of thugs. De Bauld is the leader of a local criminal organization and recently his daughter, Wanda, has been kidnapped by a rival gang, ran by a man known only as \"Big Daddy.\" Connors questions De Bauld about the mysterious Big Daddy, to which De Bauld can only provide a few details: Big Daddy is known for never pulling any of his own stunts, and physically, he has large muscles, and wears large bands around his muscles.
