[...] It seems an odd argument to say that a capitalist will only be efficient in producing use-value of a good quality when trying to make more money than the next capitalist. It would seem easier to rely on the planning of use-values in a rational way, which because there is no duplication, would be produced more cheaply and be of a higher quality. [...] Although money, and so monetary calculation, will disappear in socialism this does not mean that there will no longer be any need to make choices, evaluations and calculations. [...] Wealth will be produced and distributed in its natural form of useful things, of objects that can serve to satisfy some human need or other. Not being produced for sale on a market, items of wealth will not acquire an exchange-value in addition to their use-value.

For example, [[Alexandre Vinet]], who claimed to have been the first person to use the term, defined socialism simply as \"the opposite of [[individualism]]\".<ref>Cort, John C. ''\"Christian socialism\"''. Orbis Books, New York, 1988. pp. 355.</ref> [[Robert Owen]] also viewed socialism as a matter of ethics, although he used it with a slightly more specific meaning to refer to the view that human society can and should be improved for the benefit of all. In a similar vein, [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] claimed that socialism is \"every aspiration towards the amelioration of society\".<ref>Boyle, James. ''\"What is Socialism?\"'', The Shakespeare Press, 1912. pp. 35.</ref>\n\nIn the first half of the 19th century, many writers who described themselves as socialists\u2014and who would be later called [[utopian socialism|utopian socialists]]\u2014wrote down descriptions of what they believed to be the ideal human society. Some of them also created small communities that put their ideals into practice. A constant feature of these ideal societies was social and economic [[egalitarianism|equality]]. Because the people who proposed the creation of such societies called themselves socialists, the term socialism came to refer not only to a certain moral doctrine, but also to a type of egalitarian society based on such a doctrine.\n\nOther early advocates of socialism took a more scientific approach by favouring social leveling to create a [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]] society based upon freedom for individual talent to prosper,<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h44-ph.html|title=Adam Smith|website=www.fsmitha.com}}</ref> such as Count [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], who was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and believed a socialist society would eliminate the disorderly aspects of capitalism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politicsir.cass.anu.edu.au/|title=Welcome to the School of Politics &amp; International Relations|first1=Head of|last1=School|last2=admin.spirsocy@anu.edu.au|website=School of Politics & International Relations}}</ref> He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work.<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/> The key focus of this early socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to progress.<ref name=\"SocialismAVeryShortIntroduction\">''Newman, Michael''. (2005) ''Socialism: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}</ref> Simon's ideas provided a foundation for scientific economic planning and technocratic administration of society.\n\nOther early socialist thinkers such as [[Charles Hall (economist)|Charles Hall]] and [[Thomas Hodgskin]] based their ideas on [[David Ricardo]]'s economic theories. They reasoned that the equilibrium value of commodities approximated to prices charged by the producer when those commodities were in elastic supply and that these producer prices corresponded to the embodied labor&mdash;the cost of the labor (essentially the wages paid) that was required to produce the commodities. The Ricardian socialists viewed profit, interest and rent as deductions from this exchange-value.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/utopia.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712235906/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/utopia.htm |archivedate=2015-07-12 }}</ref> These ideas embodied early conceptions of [[market socialism]].\n\nAfter the advent of [[Karl Marx]]'s [[Marxian economics|theory of capitalism]] and [[scientific socialism]], socialism came to refer to ownership and administration of the [[means of production]] by the working class, either through the state apparatus or through independent cooperatives. In [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory, socialism refers to a specific stage of social and economic development that will displace capitalism, characterized by coordinated production, public or cooperative ownership of capital, diminishing class conflict and inequalities that spawn from such and the end of wage-labor with a method of compensation based on the principle of \"[[To each according to his contribution|From each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economictheories.org/2008/07/karl-marx-socialism-and-scientific.html|title=Karl Marx Socialism and Scientific Communism|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Differences between various schools ==\nAlthough they share a common root (as elaborated upon in the above sections), schools of socialism are divided on many issues and sometimes there is a split within a school. The following is a brief overview of the major issues which have generated or are generating significant controversy amongst socialists in general.\n\n=== Theory ===\nSome branches of socialism arose largely as a philosophical construct (e.g. [[utopian socialism]])\u2014others in the heat of a revolution (e.g. [[Classical Marxism|early Marxism]] or [[Leninism]]). A few arose merely as the product of a ruling party (e.g. [[Stalinism]]), other as a product or various worker movements (e.g. [[anarcho-syndicalism]]), or a party or other group contending for political power in a democratic society (e.g. [[social democracy]]).\n\nSome are in favour of a socialist revolution (e.g. [[Maoism]], [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], [[revolutionary socialism]], [[social anarchism]] and [[Trotskyism]]) whilst others tend to support [[Reformism|reform]] instead (e.g. [[Fabianism]] and [[individualist anarchism]]). Others believe both are possible (e.g. [[syndicalism]] or various forms of [[Marxism]]). The first utopian socialists even failed to address the question of how a socialist society would be achieved, upholding the belief that technology was a necessity for a socialist society and that they themselves had no comprehension of the technology of the future.{{citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2016}}\n\nSocialists are also divided on which rights and liberties are desirable such as the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] liberties (like those guaranteed by the United States [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] or the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]]). Some hold that they are to be preserved (or even enhanced) in a socialist society (e.g. [[anarchism]] or [[left communism]]) whilst others believe them to be undesirable (e.g. [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism]]). [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] even held different opinions at different times and some schools are divided on this issue (e.g. different strains of Trotskyism).\n\nAll socialists criticize the current system in some way. Some criticisms center on the ownership of the means of production (e.g. Marxism) whereas others tend to focus on the nature of mass and equitable distribution (e.g. most forms of utopian socialism). Most are opposed to unchecked industrialism as well as capitalism (e.g. [[green left]]) and believe that under socialism the environment must be protected. Utopian socialists like [[Robert Owen]] and [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] argued, although not from exactly the same perspective, that the injustice and widespread poverty of the societies they lived in were a problem of distribution of the goods created. On the other hand, Marxian socialists determined that the root of the injustice is based not in the function of distribution of goods already created, but rather in the fact that the ownership of the means of production is in the hands of the upper class. Marxian socialists also maintain in contrast to the utopian socialists that the root of injustice is not in how goods ([[commodity|commodities]]) are distributed, but for whose economic benefit are they produced and sold.\n\n=== Practice ===\nMost forms and derivatives of Marxism and anarchism advocated total or near-total socialization of the economy. Less radical schools (e.g. [[Bernsteinism]], [[reformism]] and [[Revisionism (Marxism)|reformist Marxism]]) proposed a mixed market economy instead. [[Mixed economy|Mixed economies]] can in turn range anywhere from those developed by the social democratic governments that have periodically governed Northern and Western European countries, to the inclusion of small [[cooperative]]s in the planned economy of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] under [[Josip Broz Tito]]. A related issue is whether it is better to reform capitalism to create a fairer society (e.g. most social democrats) or to totally overthrow the capitalist system (all Marxists).\n\nSome schools advocate centralized state control of the socialized sectors of the economy (e.g. Leninism), whilst others argue for control of those sectors by [[workers' council]]s (e.g. [[anarcho-communism]], [[council communism]], left communism, Marxism or [[syndicalism]]). This question is usually referred to by socialists in terms of \"ownership of the [[means of production]]\". None of the social democratic parties of Europe advocate total state ownership of the means of production in their contemporary demands and popular press.\n\nAnother issue socialists are divided on is what legal and political apparatus the workers would maintain and further develop the socialization of the means of production. Some advocate that the power of the workers' councils should itself constitute the basis of a socialist state (coupled with [[direct democracy]] and the widespread use of [[referendum]]s), but others hold that socialism entails the existence of a legislative body administered by people who would be elected in a [[representative democracy]].\n\nDifferent ideologies support different governments. During the era of the Soviet Union, Western socialists were bitterly divided as to whether the Soviet Union was actually socialist, moving toward socialism, or inherently unsocialist and in fact inimical to true socialism. Similarly, today the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] claims to be socialist and refers to its own approach as [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]], but most other socialists consider China to be essentially capitalist. The Chinese leadership concurs with most of the usual [[#Opposition and criticisms of socialism|critiques against a command economy]] and many of their actions to manage what they call a socialist economy have been determined by this opinion.\n\n== Socialist planned economy ==\nThis form of socialism combines public ownership and management of the means of production with [[Planned economy|centralized state planning]] and can refer to a broad range of economic systems from the centralized [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet-style command economy]] to participatory planning via workplace democracy. In a centrally-planned economy decisions regarding the quantity of goods and services to be produced as well as the allocation of output (distribution of goods and services) are planned in advanced by a planning agency. This type of economic system was often combined with a one-party political system and is associated with the [[Communist state]]s of the 20th century.\n\n=== State-directed economy ===\nA state-directed economy is a system where either the state or [[worker cooperative]]s own the means of production, but economic activity is directed to some degree by a government agency or planning ministry through mechanisms such as [[indicative planning]] or dirigisme. This differs from a centralized planned economy, or a command economy, in that micro-economic decision making, such as quantity to be produced and output requirements, is left to managers and workers in state enterprises or cooperative enterprises rather than being mandated by a comprehensive economic plan from a centralized planning board. However, the state will plan long-term strategic investment and some aspect of production. It is possible for a state-directed economy to have elements of both a market and planned economy. For example, production and investment decisions may be semi-planned by the state, but distribution of output may be determined by the market mechanism.\n\nState-directed socialism can also refer to technocratic socialism\u2014economic systems that rely on technocratic management and technocratic planning mechanisms, along with public ownership of the means of production. A forerunner of this concept was [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], who understood the state would undergo a transformation in a socialist system and change its role from one of \"political administration of men, to the administration of things\".\n\nElements of state-directed socialist economies include [[dirigisme]], [[economic planning]], [[state socialism]] and [[technocracy]].\n\n=== Decentralized planned economy ===\nA decentralized planned economy is one where ownership of enterprises is accomplished through various forms of [[Socialism#Self-managed economy|self-management]] and worker cooperatives in which planning of production and distribution is done from the bottom-up by local worker councils in a democratic manner. This form of socialist economy is related to the political philosophies of [[libertarian socialism]], [[syndicalism]] and various forms of communal utopian socialism.\n\nExamples of decentralized democratic planning include [[council communism]], [[individualist anarchism]], [[industrial democracy]], [[participatory economics]], [[Soviet democracy]] and [[syndicalism]].<ref name=\"Graham-2005\"/>\n\n== Market socialism ==\n{{main|Market socialism}}\nMarket socialism refers to various economic systems that involve either public ownership and management or worker cooperative ownership over the means of production, or a combination of both, and the market mechanism for allocating economic output, deciding what to produce and in what quantity. In state-oriented forms of market socialism where state enterprises attempt to maximize profit, the profits can fund government programs and services eliminating or greatly diminishing the need for various forms of taxation that exist in capitalist systems.\n\nSome forms of market socialism are based on [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic theory]], with the aim of attaining [[pareto efficiency]] by setting price to equal marginal cost in public enterprises. This form of socialism was promoted by [[Oskar Lange]], [[Abba Lerner]] and Fredrick Taylor. Other forms of market socialism are based on [[classical economics]], such as those advocated by [[Thomas Hodgskin]], who viewed interest accumulation, rent and profit as deductions from exchange-value, so that eliminating the capitalist element from the economy would lead to a free market and socialism. The term market socialism has also been applied to planned economic systems that try to organize themselves partially along market-lines while retaining centralized state ownership of capital.\n\nExamples of market socialism include [[economic democracy]], the [[Lange model]], [[liberal socialism]], [[market-oriented left-libertarianism]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] the [[New Economic Mechanism]] and [[Ricardian socialism]]. Other types of market socialist systems such as mutualism are related to the political philosophy of [[libertarian socialism]].\n\n=== Socialist market economy ===\nA socialist market economy refers to the economic systems adopted by the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]]. Although there is dispute as to whether or not these models actually constitute [[state capitalism]], the decisive means of production remain under state-ownership. State enterprises are organized into corporations ([[corporatization]]) and operate like private capitalist enterprises. A substantial private sector exists alongside the state sector of the economy, but it plays a secondary role usually relegated to the service sector and production of consumer goods.\n\nExamples of socialist market economies include the [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics]] and the [[socialist-oriented market economy]].\n\n== Socialist ideologies ==\n=== Utopian socialism ===\n{{main|Utopian socialism}}\n[[File:Hw-fourier.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Charles Fourier]], influential French early socialist]]\nUtopian socialism is  a term used to define the first currents of modern [[Socialism|socialist]] thought as exemplified by the work of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Robert Owen]], which inspired [[Karl Marx]] and other early socialists.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/heavenonearth/synopsis.html| title=Heaven on Earth: The Rise and Fall of Socialism| publisher=Public Broadcasting System| accessdate=December 15, 2011}}</ref> However, visions of imaginary ideal societies, which competed with revolutionary social democratic movements, were viewed as not being grounded in the material conditions of society and as \"reactionary\".<ref name=Draper>{{cite book |last=Draper|first=Hal|title=Karl Marx's Theory of Revolution, Volume IV: Critique of Other Socialisms|year=1990|publisher=Monthly Review Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-85345-798-5|pages=1\u201321}}</ref> Although it is technically possible for any set of ideas or any person living at any time in history to be a utopian socialist, the term is most often applied to those socialists who lived in the first quarter of the 19th century who were ascribed the label \"utopian\" by later socialists as a negative term, in order to imply naivete and dismiss their ideas as fanciful or unrealistic.<ref name=\"SocialismAVeryShortIntroduction\"/> Forms of socialism which existed in traditional societies are referred to as [[primitive communism]] by Marxists.\n\nReligious sects whose members live communally, such as the [[Hutterites]], for example, are not usually called \"utopian socialists\", although their way of living is a prime example. They have been categorized as [[religious socialism|religious socialists]] by some. Likewise, modern [[intentional communities]] based on socialist ideas could also be categorized as \"utopian socialist\".\n\n=== Marxism ===\n{{main|Communism|Marxism}}\n[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Karl Marx]] (1818\u20131883)]]\nMarxism, or Marxist communism, refers to [[Classless society|classless]], [[Stateless society|stateless]] social organization based upon [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]] and to a variety of movements acting in the name of this goal which are influenced by the thought of Karl Marx. In general, the classless forms of social organisation are not capitalised, while movements associated with official [[communist parties]] and [[Communist states]] usually are. In the classic Marxist definition ([[pure communism]]), a communist economy refers to a system that has achieved a superabundance of goods and services due to an increase in technological capability and advances in the productive forces and therefore has transcended socialism  (see [[post-scarcity economy]]). This is a hypothetical stage of social and economic development with few speculative details known about it.\n\nThe actual goal of communism has never been attained in practice from a Marxist position, though anarchist societies have provided a glimpse of what a communist world would look like. The real idea behind it is to abolish all leadership, and govern with a [[commune]]. That is, the people themselves make all decisions, and everyone contributing to the wellbeing of the [[State (polity)|commune]]. In practice, most governments that have claimed to be communist have been [[totalitarian]] [[dictatorships]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe modern political marxist communist movement was created when the social democratic parties of Europe split between their rightist and leftist tendencies during World War I.  The leftists, led internationally by [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Karl Liebknecht]], to distinguish their brand of socialism from the \"[[reformist]]\" social democrats, were called \"communists\".  However, after Luxemburg's and Liebknecht's murders the term communist became generally associated solely with the parties and organisations following Lenin, along with their various derivations, such as [[Stalinism]] or [[Maoism]].\n\nThere is a considerable variety of views among self-identified communists. However, [[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]], [[school (discipline)|schools]] of communism associated with Karl Marx and of Vladimir Lenin respectively, have the distinction of having been a major force in world politics since the early 20th century. [[Class struggle]] plays a central role in Marxism. This theory views the formation of communism as the culmination of the class struggle between the capitalist class, the owners of most of the capital and the working class. Marx held that society could not be transformed from the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] to the communist mode of production all at once, but required a transitional state which Marx described as the revolutionary [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].\n\nSome forms of the communist society that Marx envisioned, as emerging from capitalism, have been claimed to be achieved for limited periods during certain historical moments and under certain circumstances. For example, the [[Paris Commune]] in fact let Marx reinforce and implement his theories by adapting them to a real experience he could draw from. Another similar case, though disputed by [[anarcho-syndicalism]] or even [[anarchism]], was the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] of 1936 (often missed or unmentioned by official [[historiography]]), during which much of Spain's economy in most of [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] areas, some of which enjoyed a practical absence of [[State (polity)|state]], was put under workers' direct collective control.\n\nIn addition to this, the term communism (as well as socialism) is often used to refer to those political and economic systems and states dominated by a political, bureaucratic class, typically attached to one [[One-party state|single]] [[Communist party]] that follow Marxist-Leninist doctrines and often claim to represent the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] in a non-democratic fashion, described by critics as in a [[totalitarian]] and [[bureaucratic]]. These systems are also often called Stalinism, [[state capitalism]], [[state communism]] or [[state socialism]].\n\nWith the Soviet Union's creation after the end of [[Russian Civil War]] that followed to initial success of Red [[October Revolution]] in Russia, other socialist parties in other countries and the [[Bolshevik party]] itself became Communist parties, owing allegiance of varying degrees to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (see [[Communist International]]). After World War II, regimes calling themselves Communist took power in Eastern Europe. In 1949, the Communists in China, supported by Soviet Union and led by [[Mao Zedong]], came to power and established the [[People's Republic of China]]. Among the other countries in the [[Third World]] that adopted a bureaucratic [[Communist state]] as form of government at some point were Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Angola and Mozambique. By the early 1980s, almost one third of the world's population lived under Communist states.\n\nCommunism carries a strong [[social stigma]] in the United States due to a history of [[Anti-communism#United States|anti-communism in the United States]].<!--research communism in South America--> Since the early 1970s, the term [[Eurocommunism]] was used to refer to the policies of Communist parties in [[western Europe]], which sought to break with the tradition of uncritical and unconditional support of the Soviet Union. Such parties were politically active and electorally significant in France and Italy. With the collapse of the statalized [[one-party system]]s and [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] governments, in [[Eastern Europe]] from the late 1980s and the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985\u20131991)|breakup of the Soviet Union]] on December 8, 1991, [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] state communism's influence has decreased dramatically in Europe, but around a quarter of the world's population still lives under such a kind of Communist states.\n\n==== Leninism and Marxism\u2013Leninism ====\n{{main|Leninism|Marxism\u2013Leninism}}\n[[Vladimir Lenin]] never used the term Leninism, nor did he refer to his views as Marxism\u2013Leninism. However, his ideas diverged from classical Marxist theory on several important points (see the articles on Marxism and Leninism for more information). [[Bolshevik]] communists saw these differences as advancements of Marxism made by Lenin. After Lenin's death, his ideology and contributions to Marxist theory were termed \"Marxism\u2013Leninism\", or sometimes only \"Leninism\". Marxism\u2013Leninism soon became the official name for the ideology of the [[Comintern]] and of [[Communist Party|Communist parties]] around the world.\n\n==== Stalinism ====\n{{main|Stalinism}}\nStalinism was the theory and practice of [[communism]] practiced by [[Joseph Stalin]], leader of the Soviet Union from 1928\u20131953. Officially it adhered to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], but whether Stalin's practices actually followed the principles of Marx and Lenin is a subject of debate and [[Anti-Stalinist left|criticism]]. In contrast to Marx and Lenin, Stalin made few new theoretical contributions. Stalin's main contributions to communist theory were ''[[Socialism in One Country]]'' and the theory of [[Aggravation of class struggle under socialism]], a theoretical base supporting the repression of political opponents as necessary. Stalinism took an aggressive stance on [[class conflict]], utilizing [[state violence]] in an attempt to forcibly purge society of the [[bourgeoisie]].<ref>Stephen Kotkin.

Even when the [[proletariat]] has seized state power through a socialist [[revolution]], the potential remains for a [[bourgeoisie]] to restore capitalism. Indeed, Mao famously stated that \"the bourgeoisie [in a socialist country] is right inside the Communist Party itself\", implying that corrupt Party officials would subvert socialism if not prevented.\n\nUnlike the earlier forms of Marxism-Leninism in which the urban [[proletariat]] was seen as the main source of revolution, and the countryside was largely ignored, Mao focused on the peasantry as a revolutionary force which, he said, could be mobilized by a Communist Party with their knowledge and leadership.\n\nUnlike most other political ideologies, including other [[socialist]] and Marxist ones, Maoism contains an integral [[military]] doctrine and explicitly connects its political ideology with [[military strategy]]. In Maoist thought, \"political power comes from the barrel of the gun\" (one of Mao's quotes), and the [[peasantry]] can be mobilized to undertake a \"[[people's war]]\" of armed struggle involving [[guerrilla warfare]].\n\nSince the death of Mao and the reforms of Deng, most of the parties explicitly defining themselves as \"Maoist\" have disappeared, but various communist groups around the world, particularly armed ones like the [[Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]], the [[Communist Party of India (Maoist)|CPI (Maoist)]] and [[Communist Party of India (Marxist\u2013Leninist)|CPI (ML)]] of India and the [[New People's Army]] of the [[Philippines]], continue to advance Maoist ideas and get press attention for them. These groups generally have the idea that Mao's ideas were betrayed before they could be fully or properly implemented.\n\n==== Trotskyism ====\n{{main|Trotskyism}}\nTrotskyism is the theory of Marxism as advocated by [[Leon Trotsky]].  Trotsky considered himself a [[Bolshevik]]\u2013[[Leninism|Leninist]], arguing for the establishment of a [[vanguard party]].  He considered himself an advocate of orthodox Marxism.  His politics differed greatly from those of [[Stalinism|Stalin]] or [[Maoism|Mao]], most importantly in declaring the need for an international \"[[permanent revolution]]\" and arguing that democracy is essential to both socialism and communism. Numerous groups around the world continue to describe themselves as Trotskyist and see themselves as standing in this tradition, although they have diverse interpretations of the conclusions to be drawn from this.\n\n==== Council communism and left communism ====\n{{main|Council communism|Left communism}}\nCouncil communism, or councilism, is a current of [[libertarian Marxism]] that emerged from the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|November Revolution]] in the 1920s, characterized by its opposition to [[state capitalism]]/[[state socialism]] as well as its advocacy of [[workers' councils]] as the basis for [[Socialist state|workers' democracy]]. Originally affiliated with the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany]] (KAPD), council communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within the greater [[libertarian socialism]] movement.\n\nChief among the tenets of council communism is its opposition to the [[Vanguard party|party vanguardism]]<ref name=\"Pannekoek36\">[[Anton Pannekoek]] (1936) [http://libcom.org/library/workers-councils-book-pannekoek ''Workers\u2019 Councils'']</ref><ref>[http://libcom.org/library/notes-trotsky-pannekoek-bordiga-gilles-dauv%C3%A9 ''Notes on Trotsky, Pannekoek, Bordiga \u2013 Gilles Dauv\u00e9'']</ref> and [[democratic centralism]]<ref>Pannekoek, Anton. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/pannekoe/1936/dictatorship.htm State Capitalism and Dictatorship] International Council Correspondence, Vol.III, No.1, January 1937.</ref> of [[Leninism|Leninist ideologies]] and its contention that democratic workers' councils arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural form of working class organization and authority. Council communism also stands in contrast to [[social democracy]] through its formal rejection of both the [[reformism]] and [[parliamentarism]].<ref>Ruhle, Otto. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/ruhle/1920/ruhle02.htm \"The Revolution Is Not A Party Affair\".] 1920.</ref>\n\nThe historical origins of left communism can be traced to the period before [[World War I]], but it only came into focus after 1918. All left communists were supportive of the [[October Revolution]] in Russia, but retained a critical view of its development. However, some would in later years come to reject the idea that the revolution had a [[proletarian]] or [[socialist]] nature, asserting that it had simply carried out the tasks of the [[bourgeois]] revolution by creating a state capitalist system.\n\n==== Autonomism ====\n{{main|Autonomism}}\n[[File:AntonioNegri SeminarioInternacionalMundo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Antonio Negri]], main theorist of [[Autonomism#Italian autonomism|Italian autonomism]]]]\nAutonomism refers to a set of [[left-wing]] political and social movements and theories close to the [[socialism|socialist movement]]. As an identifiable theoretical system it first emerged in [[History of Italy as a Republic|Italy in the 1960s]] from [[workerist]] (''[[operaismo]]'') [[communism]]. Later, post-[[Marxism|Marxist]] and [[anarchist]] tendencies became significant after influence from the [[Situationist International|Situationists]], the failure of Italian [[far-left]] movements in the 1970s, and the emergence of a number of important theorists including [[Antonio Negri]], who had contributed to the 1969 founding of ''[[Potere Operaio]]'', Mario Tronti, [[Paolo Virno]], etc.\n\nUnlike other forms of Marxism, autonomist Marxism emphasises the ability of the working class to force changes to the organization of the capitalist system independent of the state, trade unions or political parties. Autonomists are less concerned with party political organization than other Marxists, focusing instead on self-organized action outside of traditional organizational structures. Autonomist Marxism is thus a \"bottom up\" theory: it draws attention to activities that autonomists see as everyday working class resistance to capitalism, for example absenteeism, slow working, and socialization in the workplace.\n\nThrough translations made available by Danilo Montaldi and others, the Italian autonomists drew upon previous activist research in the United States by the [[Johnson-Forest Tendency]] and in France by the group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]].\n\nIt influenced the German and Dutch Autonomen, the worldwide [[Social Centre movement]], and today is influential in Italy, France, and to a lesser extent the English-speaking countries. Those who describe themselves as autonomists now vary from Marxists to [[post-structuralism|post-structuralists]] and anarchists. The Autonomist Marxist and ''Autonomen'' movements provided inspiration to some on the revolutionary left in English speaking countries, particularly among anarchists, many of whom have adopted autonomist tactics. Some English-speaking anarchists even describe themselves as ''Autonomists''.\n\nThe Italian ''operaismo'' movement also influenced Marxist academics such as [[Harry Cleaver]], [[John Holloway (economist)|John Holloway]], Steve Wright, and [[Nick Dyer-Witheford]].\n\n=== Anarchism ===\n{{main|Anarchism}}\nAnarchism is a [[political philosophy]] that advocates [[stateless society|stateless societies]] based on non-[[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free association]]s.<ref name=\"iaf-ifa.org\"/><ref>\"That is why Anarchy, when it works to destroy authority in all its aspects, when it demands the abrogation of laws and the abolition of the mechanism that serves to impose them, when it refuses all hierarchical organization and preaches free agreement \u2014 at the same time strives to maintain and enlarge the precious kernel of social customs without which no human or animal society can exist.\" [[Peter Kropotkin]].

Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, [[popular education]] issues, the [[general strike]] or [[antimilitarism]]. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and [[syndicalism]] (or [[trade union]]ism). The [[Federaci\u00f3n Anarquista Ib\u00e9rica|Spanish Workers Federation]] in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain.

Furthermore, it means that, within capitalism, any gains or losses made by some workers from or to bosses will eventually affect all workers. Therefore, all workers must support one another in their [[class conflict]] to [[Wiktionary:Liberate|liberate]] themselves.\n\nAnarcho-syndicalists believe that only [[direct action]]\u2014that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal, as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position\u2014will allow workers to liberate themselves.<ref>Rocker, Rudolf. 'Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice' AK Press (2004) p. 73</ref> Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organizations (the organizations that struggle against the wage system, which, in anarcho-syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or \"business agents\"; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves.\n\n[[Rudolf Rocker]] was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labor in his 1938 pamphlet ''[[Anarcho-Syndicalism (book)|Anarcho-Syndicalism]]''. The [[International Workers Association]] is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labor unions from different countries.

Henry David Thoreau (1817\u20131862), uno de los escritores pr\u00f3ximos al movimiento de la filosof\u00eda trascendentalista, es uno de los m\u00e1s conocidos. Su obra m\u00e1s representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una caba\u00f1a en el bosque, y vivir en \u00edntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosof\u00eda trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon\u00eda de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan.

Later, in De Profundis, he described Kropotkin's life as one \"of the most perfect lives I have come across in my own experience\" and talked of him as \"a man with a soul of that beautiful white Christ that seems coming out of Russia.\" But in The Soul of Man Under Socialism, which appeared in 1890, it is [[William Godwin|Godwin]] rather than Kropotkin whose influence seems dominant.\" George Woodcock.

(p. 447)</ref> In a socialist society, people will have the possibility to realise their talents as \"each member of the society will share in the general prosperity and happiness of the society\". Wilde added that \"upon the other hand, Socialism itself will be of value simply because it will lead to individualism\" since individuals will no longer need to fear poverty or starvation. This individualism would, in turn, protect against governments \"armed with economic power as they are now with political power\" over their citizens. However, Wilde advocated non-capitalist individualism, saying that \"of course, it might be said that the Individualism generated under conditions of private property is not always, or even as a rule, of a fine or wonderful type\" a critique which is \"quite true\".<ref name=\"The Soul of Man\">{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/soul-of-man-under-socialism-oscar-wilde |title=The Soul of Man |publisher=Libcom.org |date=2005-09-08 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}</ref> In Wilde's imagination, in this way socialism would free men from manual labour and allow them to devote their time to creative pursuits, thus developing their soul.

Classic social democracy was a political philosophy that attempted to achieve socialism through gradual, parliamentary means and by reforming capitalism from within rather than through revolutionary means.  The term ''social democracy'' can refer to the particular kind of society that social democrats advocate.\n\nThe [[Socialist International]] (SI), the worldwide organization of social democratic and democratic socialist parties, defines social democracy as an ideal form of [[representative democracy]] that may solve the problems found in a [[liberal democracy]]. The SI emphasizes the following principles: firstly, ''freedom''\u2014not only individual liberties, but also freedom from discrimination and freedom from dependence on either the owners of the means of production or the holders of abusive political power. Secondly, ''equality and social justice''\u2014not only before the law but also economic and socio-cultural equality as well, and equal opportunities for all including those with physical, mental, or social disabilities. Finally, ''solidarity''\u2014unity and a sense of compassion for the victims of injustice and inequality.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080222070726/http://www.socialistinternational.org/4Principles/dofpeng2.html \"Declaration of Principles\"]. Socialist International.</ref>\n\nSocial democracy seeks to contain capitalism through transitioning unstable private sector enterprises into public ownership, correcting economic and social inequality through social safety nets and services (sometimes referred to as [[welfare state]] policies) and more aggressive regulation of markets and private enterprise than other forms of [[mixed economy]]. Over the past forty years, social democracy has increasingly been replaced with alternate economic systems such as the [[social market economy]] or [[Third Way]] mixed economies that are informed by [[Keynesian economics]].\n\n=== Democratic socialism ===\n{{main|Democratic socialism}}\nModern [[democratic socialism]] is a broad political movement that seeks to propagate the ideals of socialism within the context of a democratic system. Democratic socialism is closely related to social democracy and in some accounts are identical while other accounts stress differences.  Many democratic socialists support social democracy as a road to reform of the current system while others support more revolutionary change in society to establish socialist goals. Generally, social democracy is considered to be more centrist and broadly supportive of current capitalist systems (for example, the [[mixed economy]]) and the [[welfare state]] while many democratic socialists support a more fully socialist system, either through [[evolutionary socialism|evolutionary]] or [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]] means.\n\nDemocratic socialists and social democrats both advocate the concept of the [[welfare state]], but whereas most social democrats view the welfare state as the end itself, irrespective of any hierarchies of power that may persist following welfare reforms, many democratic socialists view it as the means to an egalitarian end. {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Highlighting this difference, contemporary advocates of the democratic socialist model have criticized the social democratic approach of a welfare state if it is not adequately providing socioeconomic welfare programs at the universal level. <ref name=\"Day\">{{cite web|last=Day|first=Meagan|title=Why We Need Free College for Everyone \u2014 Even Rich People|work=Jacobin Magazine (July, 2019)|url=https://jacobinmag.com/2019/07/free-college-tuition-bernie-sanders-means-testing-universal-social-programs|quote=Where a meager means-tested welfare-state model breeds alienation and competition, a robust universal welfare-state model breeds trust and cooperation.

Members of several major religions have found that their beliefs about human society fit with socialist principles and ideas. As a result, religious socialist movements have developed within these religions.\n\n==== Christian socialism ====\n{{main|Christian socialism}}\n{{further|Christian left|Social Gospel}}\nThere are individuals and groups, past and present, that are clearly both Christian and socialist, such as [[Frederick Denison Maurice]], author of ''The Kingdom of Christ'' (1838), and the [[Christian Socialist Movement]] (UK) (CSM), affiliated with the British [[The Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. [[Distributism]], is a [[Third Way (centrism)|third-way]] economic philosophy formulated by such Catholic thinkers as [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[Hilaire Belloc]] to apply the principles of [[social justice]] articulated by the Roman Catholic Church, especially in Pope [[Leo XIII]]'s encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]''.\n\nVarious [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] clerical parties have at times referred to themselves as \"Christian Social.\" Two examples are the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]] of [[Karl Lueger]] in Austria before and after World War I, and the contemporary [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria]]. Yet these parties have never espoused socialist policies and have always stood at the conservative side of [[Christian Democracy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.socialdemocraticpartyofamerica.org/politicalspectrum.htm|title=Political Spectrum as seen by the Social Democratic Party of America|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]] of [[Venezuela]] was an advocate of a form of Christian socialism as he claims that [[Jesus Christ]] was a socialist.\n\n==== Christian anarchism ====\n{{main|Christian anarchism}}\n[[File:L.N.Tolstoy Prokudin-Gorsky.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Leo Tolstoy]]]]\nChristian anarchism is a [[Christian movement|movement]] in [[political theology]] that combines [[anarchism]] and [[Christianity]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |pages=2\u20134 |url= |accessdate=|quote=Locating Christian anarchism...In political theology}}</ref> The foundation of Christian anarchism is a rejection of violence, with [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]'' regarded as a key text.<ref name=CritiqueofViolence>{{cite web |first=Alexandre |last=Christoyannopoulos |url=http://www.psa.ac.uk/journals/pdf/5/2010/1338_1226.pdf |title=A Christian Anarchist Critique of Violence: From Turning the Other Cheek to a Rejection of the State |date=March 2010 |publisher=Political Studies Association |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yRpM4GdE?url=http://www.psa.ac.uk/journals/pdf/5/2010/1338_1226.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-05 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |pages=19 and 208 |url= |accessdate=|quote=Leo Tolstoy}}</ref> Tolstoy sought to separate [[Russian Orthodox Christianity]]\u2014which was merged with the [[State (polity)|state]]\u2014from what he believed was the true message of Jesus as contained in the Gospels, specifically in the [[Sermon on the Mount]].

''[[The Green Book (Libya)|The Green Book]]'' (written by [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]]) consists of three parts, namely \"The Solution of the Problem of Democracy: 'The Authority of the People'\", \"The Solution of the Economic Problem: 'Socialism'\", and \"The Social Basis of the Third Universal Theory\". The book is controversial because it completely rejects modern conceptions of [[liberal democracy]] and encourages the institution of a form of [[direct democracy]] based on popular committees. Critics charge that Qaddafi uses these committees as tools of [[autocratic]] political repression in practice.\n\nScholars have highlighted the similarities between the Islamic economic system and socialist theory. For example, both are against unearned income. [[Islam]] does allow private ownership of [[natural resource]]s and large industries which are owned collectively, or at least encouraged to be so.\n\n=== Regional socialism ===\n==== Arab socialism ====\n{{main|Arab socialism}}\nThe [[Ba'ath Party|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]] rules [[Syria]] and has ruled [[Iraq]] under [[Saddam Hussein]] based on a tradition of [[secular]], non-Marxist socialism. Ba'thist beliefs combine [[Arab socialism]], [[nationalism]], and [[pan-Arabism]]. The mostly secular ideology often contrasts with that of other Arab governments in the Middle East, which sometimes lean towards [[Islamism]] and [[theocracy]]. The Ba'athists have persecuted socialists in their own countries. In Iraq, the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] assisted Iraq with a list of communists to eliminate, effectively wiping them out. Socialist Lynn Walsh argues that the Iraqi Ba'athists promoted capitalists from within the party and outside the country.<ref>Walsh, Lynn. ''Imperialism and the gulf war'', [http://www.socialistworld.net/publications/gulfcrisis/c5.html Chapter 5], 1990-91.</ref>\n\n==== Irish republican socialism ====\nSocialism has traditionally been part of the [[Irish republican]] movement since the early 20th century, when [[James Connolly]], an Irish [[Marxist]] theorist, took part in the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916.  Today, most Irish nationalist and Republican organizations located in [[Northern Ireland]] advocate some form of socialism, both Marxist and non-Marxist.  The [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] which until recently was the largest nationalist party in Northern Ireland promotes social democracy while militant Republican parties such as [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], [[Republican Sinn F\u00e9in]], and the [[32 County Sovereignty Movement]] all promote their own varieties of democratic socialism intended to re-distribute wealth on an all-island basis once a [[united Ireland]] has been achieved.  The [[Irish Republican Socialist Movement]], encompassing the [[Irish Republican Socialist Party]] and [[Irish National Liberation Army]] as well as the defunct [[Official Irish Republican Army]] and Irish National Liberation Front are known for promoting an ideology which combines [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninism]] with traditional revolutionary militant Republicanism and is said to be the most direct fulfillment of Connolly's legacy.\n\n=== Eco-socialism ===\n{{main|Eco-socialism}}\nMerging aspects of Marxism, [[socialism]], [[environmentalism]], anarchism and [[ecology]], Eco-socialists generally believe that the capitalist system is the cause of [[social exclusion]], [[Economic inequality|inequality]] and [[environmental degradation]]. Eco-socialists criticise many within the [[Green movement]] for not going far enough in their critique of the current world system and for not being overtly [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]]. At the same time, Eco-socialists would blame the traditional Left for overlooking or not properly addressing ecological problems.<ref name=Babylon>Wall, D., ''Babylon and Beyond: The Economics of Anti-Capitalist, Anti-Globalist and Radical Green Movements'', 2005</ref> Eco-socialists are [[anti-globalisation]]. [[Joel Kovel]] sees [[globalisation]] as a force driven by capitalism \u2013 in turn, the rapid [[economic growth]] encouraged by globalisation causes acute ecological crises.<ref name=Kovel>Kovel, J., ''The Enemy of Nature'', 2002</ref>\n\nEco-socialism goes beyond a criticism of the actions of large corporations and targets the inherent properties of capitalism. Such an analysis follows [[Marxism|Marx's]] theories about the contradiction between [[use value]]s and [[exchange value]]s. As [[Joel Kovel]] explains, within a market economy, goods are not produced to meet needs but are produced to be exchanged for money that we then use to acquire other goods. As we have to keep selling to keep buying, we must persuade others to buy our goods just to ensure our survival, which leads to the production of goods with no previous use that can be sold to sustain our ability to buy other goods. Eco-socialists like Kovel stress that this contradiction has reached a destructive extent, where certain essential activities such as caring for relatives full-time and basic subsistence are unrewarded while unnecessary economic activities earn certain individuals huge fortunes.<ref name=Kovel/>\n\n[[Agrarian socialism]] is another variant of eco-socialism.\n\n==== Green anarchism ====\n{{main|Green anarchism}}\nGreen anarchism, or eco-anarchism, is a school of thought within [[anarchism]] which puts a particular emphasis on [[environmental issues]]. An important early influence was the thought of the American [[individualist anarchist]] [[Henry David Thoreau]] and his book ''[[Walden]]''.<ref name=\"Thoreau\">\"Su obra m\u00e1s representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una caba\u00f1a en el bosque, y vivir en \u00edntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosof\u00eda trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon\u00eda de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por [[John Zerzan]]. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar tambi\u00e9n motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX.\"[http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html \"LA INSUMISI\u00d3N VOLUNTARIA.

Aflaq and al-Bitar both studied at the [[Sorbonne]] in the early 1930s, at a time when [[centre-left]] [[Positivism]] was still the dominant ideology amongst France's academic elite. The Ba'ath party included a significant number of [[Christian Arabs]] among its founding members. For them, a resolutely nationalist and secular political framework was a suitable way to avoid a faith-based Islamic orientation and to give non-Muslims full acknowledgement as citizens.\n\nIn 1955, a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] by the military against the historical leadership of Aflaq and al-Bitar led the Syrian and Iraqi parties to split into rival organizations\u2014the Qotri (Regionalist) Syria-based party and the Qawmi (Nationalist) Iraq-based party.<ref name='The Struggle for Power in Syria: Sectarianism, Regionalism and Tribalism in Politics'>{{cite news |first=Nikolaos |last=van Dam |title=The Struggle for Power in Syria: Sectarianism, Regionalism and Tribalism in Politics |year=1979 |publisher=I B Tauris}}</ref>  Both Ba'ath parties kept their names and maintained parallel structures, but became so antagonistic that the Syrian Ba'ath government became the only Arab government to support non-Arab [[Iran]] against Iraq during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]].\n\nIn Syria, the Ba'ath Party has had a [[monopoly]] on political power since the party's 1963 coup. Ba'athists seized power in Iraq in 1963, but were deposed months later. They  returned to power in a 1968 coup and remained the sole party of government until the [[2003 Iraq invasion]].

The party sought independence from French colonial rule in [[Vietnam]] during the early 20th century. Its origins lie in the mid-1920s, when a group of young Hanoi-based intellectuals began publishing revolutionary material. From 1928, the VNQD\u0110 attracted attention through its assassinations of French officials and Vietnamese collaborators. During the 1930s, the party was eclipsed by [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s [[Indochinese Communist Party]] (ICP). Vietnam was occupied by [[Imperial Japan|Japan]] during World War II and in the chaos that followed the Japanese surrender in 1945 the VNQD\u0110 and the ICP briefly joined forces in the fight for Vietnamese independence. After a falling out, Ho purged the VNQD\u0110, leaving his communist-dominated [[Viet Minh]] unchallenged as the foremost anti-colonial militant organisation. As a part of the post-war settlement that ended the [[First Indochina War]], Vietnam was [[Partition of Vietnam|partitioned into two zones]]. The remnants of the VNQD\u0110 fled to the anti-communist [[South Vietnam|south]], where they remained until the [[Fall of Saigon]] in 1975 and the reunification of Vietnam under communist rule.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Socialism}}\n{{cols|colwidth=16em}}\n* [[Anarchism]]\n* [[Anarchist economics]]\n* [[Anarchist schools of thought]]\n* [[Authoritarian socialism]]\n* [[Christian socialism]]\n* [[Communism]]\n* [[Democratic socialism]]\n* [[Ethical socialism]]\n* [[History of anarchism]]\n* [[History of communism]]\n* [[History of socialism]]\n* [[Labour movement]]\n* \"[[The labor problem]]\"\n* [[Left-libertarianism]]\n* [[Liberal socialism]]\n* [[Libertarianism]]\n* [[Libertarian socialism]]\n* [[List of communist ideologies]]\n* [[Market socialism]]\n* [[Marxian economics]]\n* [[Marxism]]\n* [[Marxist schools of thought]]\n* [[Mutualism (economic theory)]]\n* [[Reformism]]\n* [[Revolutionary socialism]]\n* [[Social democracy]]\n* [[Socialism]]\n* [[Socialist economics]]\n* [[Socialist mode of production]]\n* [[Socialist state]]\n* [[State socialism]]\n* [[Syndicalism]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* G.

[...] Exchange-value, prices and so money are goals in themselves in a capitalist society or in any market. There is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital or sums of money and human welfare. Under conditions of backwardness, the spur of money and the accumulation of wealth has led to a massive growth in industry and technology. [...] It seems an odd argument to say that a capitalist will only be efficient in producing use-value of a good quality when trying to make more money than the next capitalist. It would seem easier to rely on the planning of use-values in a rational way, which because there is no duplication, would be produced more cheaply and be of a higher quality. [...] Although money, and so monetary calculation, will disappear in socialism this does not mean that there will no longer be any need to make choices, evaluations and calculations. [...] Wealth will be produced and distributed in its natural form of useful things, of objects that can serve to satisfy some human need or other. Not being produced for sale on a market, items of wealth will not acquire an exchange-value in addition to their use-value. In socialism their value, in the normal non-economic sense of the word, will not be their selling price nor the time needed to produce them but their usefulness.

For example, [[Alexandre Vinet]], who claimed to have been the first person to use the term, defined socialism simply as \"the opposite of [[individualism]]\".<ref>Cort, John C. ''\"Christian socialism\"''. Orbis Books, New York, 1988. pp. 355.</ref> [[Robert Owen]] also viewed socialism as a matter of ethics, although he used it with a slightly more specific meaning to refer to the view that human society can and should be improved for the benefit of all. In a similar vein, [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] claimed that socialism is \"every aspiration towards the amelioration of society\".<ref>Boyle, James. ''\"What is Socialism?\"'', The Shakespeare Press, 1912. pp. 35.</ref>\n\nIn the first half of the 19th century, many writers who described themselves as socialists\u2014and who would be later called [[utopian socialism|utopian socialists]]\u2014wrote down descriptions of what they believed to be the ideal human society. Some of them also created small communities that put their ideals into practice. A constant feature of these ideal societies was social and economic [[egalitarianism|equality]]. Because the people who proposed the creation of such societies called themselves socialists, the term socialism came to refer not only to a certain moral doctrine, but also to a type of egalitarian society based on such a doctrine.\n\nOther early advocates of socialism took a more scientific approach by favouring social leveling to create a [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]] society based upon freedom for individual talent to prosper,<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h44-ph.html|title=Adam Smith|website=www.fsmitha.com}}</ref> such as Count [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], who was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and believed a socialist society would eliminate the disorderly aspects of capitalism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politicsir.cass.anu.edu.au/|title=Welcome to the School of Politics &amp; International Relations|first1=Head of|last1=School|last2=admin.spirsocy@anu.edu.au|website=School of Politics & International Relations}}</ref> He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work.<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/> The key focus of this early socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to progress.<ref name=\"SocialismAVeryShortIntroduction\">''Newman, Michael''. (2005) ''Socialism: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}</ref> Simon's ideas provided a foundation for scientific economic planning and technocratic administration of society.\n\nOther early socialist thinkers such as [[Charles Hall (economist)|Charles Hall]] and [[Thomas Hodgskin]] based their ideas on [[David Ricardo]]'s economic theories. They reasoned that the equilibrium value of commodities approximated to prices charged by the producer when those commodities were in elastic supply and that these producer prices corresponded to the embodied labor&mdash;the cost of the labor (essentially the wages paid) that was required to produce the commodities. The Ricardian socialists viewed profit, interest and rent as deductions from this exchange-value.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/utopia.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712235906/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/utopia.htm |archivedate=2015-07-12 }}</ref> These ideas embodied early conceptions of [[market socialism]].\n\nAfter the advent of [[Karl Marx]]'s [[Marxian economics|theory of capitalism]] and [[scientific socialism]], socialism came to refer to ownership and administration of the [[means of production]] by the working class, either through the state apparatus or through independent cooperatives. In [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory, socialism refers to a specific stage of social and economic development that will displace capitalism, characterized by coordinated production, public or cooperative ownership of capital, diminishing class conflict and inequalities that spawn from such and the end of wage-labor with a method of compensation based on the principle of \"[[To each according to his contribution|From each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.economictheories.org/2008/07/karl-marx-socialism-and-scientific.html|title=Karl Marx Socialism and Scientific Communism|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Differences between various schools ==\nAlthough they share a common root (as elaborated upon in the above sections), schools of socialism are divided on many issues and sometimes there is a split within a school. The following is a brief overview of the major issues which have generated or are generating significant controversy amongst socialists in general.\n\n=== Theory ===\nSome branches of socialism arose largely as a philosophical construct (e.g. [[utopian socialism]])\u2014others in the heat of a revolution (e.g. [[Classical Marxism|early Marxism]] or [[Leninism]]). A few arose merely as the product of a ruling party (e.g. [[Stalinism]]), other as a product or various worker movements (e.g. [[anarcho-syndicalism]]), or a party or other group contending for political power in a democratic society (e.g. [[social democracy]]).\n\nSome are in favour of a socialist revolution (e.g. [[Maoism]], [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], [[revolutionary socialism]], [[social anarchism]] and [[Trotskyism]]) whilst others tend to support [[Reformism|reform]] instead (e.g. [[Fabianism]] and [[individualist anarchism]]). Others believe both are possible (e.g. [[syndicalism]] or various forms of [[Marxism]]). The first utopian socialists even failed to address the question of how a socialist society would be achieved, upholding the belief that technology was a necessity for a socialist society and that they themselves had no comprehension of the technology of the future.{{citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2016}}\n\nSocialists are also divided on which rights and liberties are desirable such as the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] liberties (like those guaranteed by the United States [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] or the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]]). Some hold that they are to be preserved (or even enhanced) in a socialist society (e.g. [[anarchism]] or [[left communism]]) whilst others believe them to be undesirable (e.g. [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism]]). [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] even held different opinions at different times and some schools are divided on this issue (e.g. different strains of Trotskyism).\n\nAll socialists criticize the current system in some way. Some criticisms center on the ownership of the means of production (e.g. Marxism) whereas others tend to focus on the nature of mass and equitable distribution (e.g. most forms of utopian socialism). Most are opposed to unchecked industrialism as well as capitalism (e.g. [[green left]]) and believe that under socialism the environment must be protected. Utopian socialists like [[Robert Owen]] and [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] argued, although not from exactly the same perspective, that the injustice and widespread poverty of the societies they lived in were a problem of distribution of the goods created. On the other hand, Marxian socialists determined that the root of the injustice is based not in the function of distribution of goods already created, but rather in the fact that the ownership of the means of production is in the hands of the upper class. Marxian socialists also maintain in contrast to the utopian socialists that the root of injustice is not in how goods ([[commodity|commodities]]) are distributed, but for whose economic benefit are they produced and sold.\n\n=== Practice ===\nMost forms and derivatives of Marxism and anarchism advocated total or near-total socialization of the economy. Less radical schools (e.g. [[Bernsteinism]], [[reformism]] and [[Revisionism (Marxism)|reformist Marxism]]) proposed a mixed market economy instead. [[Mixed economy|Mixed economies]] can in turn range anywhere from those developed by the social democratic governments that have periodically governed Northern and Western European countries, to the inclusion of small [[cooperative]]s in the planned economy of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] under [[Josip Broz Tito]]. A related issue is whether it is better to reform capitalism to create a fairer society (e.g. most social democrats) or to totally overthrow the capitalist system (all Marxists).\n\nSome schools advocate centralized state control of the socialized sectors of the economy (e.g. Leninism), whilst others argue for control of those sectors by [[workers' council]]s (e.g. [[anarcho-communism]], [[council communism]], left communism, Marxism or [[syndicalism]]). This question is usually referred to by socialists in terms of \"ownership of the [[means of production]]\". None of the social democratic parties of Europe advocate total state ownership of the means of production in their contemporary demands and popular press.\n\nAnother issue socialists are divided on is what legal and political apparatus the workers would maintain and further develop the socialization of the means of production. Some advocate that the power of the workers' councils should itself constitute the basis of a socialist state (coupled with [[direct democracy]] and the widespread use of [[referendum]]s), but others hold that socialism entails the existence of a legislative body administered by people who would be elected in a [[representative democracy]].\n\nDifferent ideologies support different governments. During the era of the Soviet Union, Western socialists were bitterly divided as to whether the Soviet Union was actually socialist, moving toward socialism, or inherently unsocialist and in fact inimical to true socialism. Similarly, today the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] claims to be socialist and refers to its own approach as [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]], but most other socialists consider China to be essentially capitalist. The Chinese leadership concurs with most of the usual [[#Opposition and criticisms of socialism|critiques against a command economy]] and many of their actions to manage what they call a socialist economy have been determined by this opinion.\n\n== Socialist planned economy ==\nThis form of socialism combines public ownership and management of the means of production with [[Planned economy|centralized state planning]] and can refer to a broad range of economic systems from the centralized [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet-style command economy]] to participatory planning via workplace democracy. In a centrally-planned economy decisions regarding the quantity of goods and services to be produced as well as the allocation of output (distribution of goods and services) are planned in advanced by a planning agency. This type of economic system was often combined with a one-party political system and is associated with the [[Communist state]]s of the 20th century.\n\n=== State-directed economy ===\nA state-directed economy is a system where either the state or [[worker cooperative]]s own the means of production, but economic activity is directed to some degree by a government agency or planning ministry through mechanisms such as [[indicative planning]] or dirigisme. This differs from a centralized planned economy, or a command economy, in that micro-economic decision making, such as quantity to be produced and output requirements, is left to managers and workers in state enterprises or cooperative enterprises rather than being mandated by a comprehensive economic plan from a centralized planning board. However, the state will plan long-term strategic investment and some aspect of production. It is possible for a state-directed economy to have elements of both a market and planned economy. For example, production and investment decisions may be semi-planned by the state, but distribution of output may be determined by the market mechanism.\n\nState-directed socialism can also refer to technocratic socialism\u2014economic systems that rely on technocratic management and technocratic planning mechanisms, along with public ownership of the means of production. A forerunner of this concept was [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], who understood the state would undergo a transformation in a socialist system and change its role from one of \"political administration of men, to the administration of things\".\n\nElements of state-directed socialist economies include [[dirigisme]], [[economic planning]], [[state socialism]] and [[technocracy]].\n\n=== Decentralized planned economy ===\nA decentralized planned economy is one where ownership of enterprises is accomplished through various forms of [[Socialism#Self-managed economy|self-management]] and worker cooperatives in which planning of production and distribution is done from the bottom-up by local worker councils in a democratic manner. This form of socialist economy is related to the political philosophies of [[libertarian socialism]], [[syndicalism]] and various forms of communal utopian socialism.\n\nExamples of decentralized democratic planning include [[council communism]], [[individualist anarchism]], [[industrial democracy]], [[participatory economics]], [[Soviet democracy]] and [[syndicalism]].<ref name=\"Graham-2005\"/>\n\n== Market socialism ==\n{{main|Market socialism}}\nMarket socialism refers to various economic systems that involve either public ownership and management or worker cooperative ownership over the means of production, or a combination of both, and the market mechanism for allocating economic output, deciding what to produce and in what quantity. In state-oriented forms of market socialism where state enterprises attempt to maximize profit, the profits can fund government programs and services eliminating or greatly diminishing the need for various forms of taxation that exist in capitalist systems.\n\nSome forms of market socialism are based on [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic theory]], with the aim of attaining [[pareto efficiency]] by setting price to equal marginal cost in public enterprises. This form of socialism was promoted by [[Oskar Lange]], [[Abba Lerner]] and Fredrick Taylor. Other forms of market socialism are based on [[classical economics]], such as those advocated by [[Thomas Hodgskin]], who viewed interest accumulation, rent and profit as deductions from exchange-value, so that eliminating the capitalist element from the economy would lead to a free market and socialism. The term market socialism has also been applied to planned economic systems that try to organize themselves partially along market-lines while retaining centralized state ownership of capital.\n\nExamples of market socialism include [[economic democracy]], the [[Lange model]], [[liberal socialism]], [[market-oriented left-libertarianism]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] the [[New Economic Mechanism]] and [[Ricardian socialism]]. Other types of market socialist systems such as mutualism are related to the political philosophy of [[libertarian socialism]].\n\n=== Socialist market economy ===\nA socialist market economy refers to the economic systems adopted by the [[People's Republic of China]] and the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]]. Although there is dispute as to whether or not these models actually constitute [[state capitalism]], the decisive means of production remain under state-ownership. State enterprises are organized into corporations ([[corporatization]]) and operate like private capitalist enterprises. A substantial private sector exists alongside the state sector of the economy, but it plays a secondary role usually relegated to the service sector and production of consumer goods.\n\nExamples of socialist market economies include the [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics]] and the [[socialist-oriented market economy]].\n\n== Socialist ideologies ==\n=== Utopian socialism ===\n{{main|Utopian socialism}}\n[[File:Hw-fourier.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Charles Fourier]], influential French early socialist]]\nUtopian socialism is  a term used to define the first currents of modern [[Socialism|socialist]] thought as exemplified by the work of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Robert Owen]], which inspired [[Karl Marx]] and other early socialists.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/heavenonearth/synopsis.html| title=Heaven on Earth: The Rise and Fall of Socialism| publisher=Public Broadcasting System| accessdate=December 15, 2011}}</ref> However, visions of imaginary ideal societies, which competed with revolutionary social democratic movements, were viewed as not being grounded in the material conditions of society and as \"reactionary\".<ref name=Draper>{{cite book |last=Draper|first=Hal|title=Karl Marx's Theory of Revolution, Volume IV: Critique of Other Socialisms|year=1990|publisher=Monthly Review Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-85345-798-5|pages=1\u201321}}</ref> Although it is technically possible for any set of ideas or any person living at any time in history to be a utopian socialist, the term is most often applied to those socialists who lived in the first quarter of the 19th century who were ascribed the label \"utopian\" by later socialists as a negative term, in order to imply naivete and dismiss their ideas as fanciful or unrealistic.<ref name=\"SocialismAVeryShortIntroduction\"/> Forms of socialism which existed in traditional societies are referred to as [[primitive communism]] by Marxists.\n\nReligious sects whose members live communally, such as the [[Hutterites]], for example, are not usually called \"utopian socialists\", although their way of living is a prime example. They have been categorized as [[religious socialism|religious socialists]] by some. Likewise, modern [[intentional communities]] based on socialist ideas could also be categorized as \"utopian socialist\".\n\n=== Marxism ===\n{{main|Communism|Marxism}}\n[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Karl Marx]] (1818\u20131883)]]\nMarxism, or Marxist communism, refers to [[Classless society|classless]], [[Stateless society|stateless]] social organization based upon [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]] and to a variety of movements acting in the name of this goal which are influenced by the thought of Karl Marx. In general, the classless forms of social organisation are not capitalised, while movements associated with official [[communist parties]] and [[Communist states]] usually are. In the classic Marxist definition ([[pure communism]]), a communist economy refers to a system that has achieved a superabundance of goods and services due to an increase in technological capability and advances in the productive forces and therefore has transcended socialism  (see [[post-scarcity economy]]). This is a hypothetical stage of social and economic development with few speculative details known about it.\n\nThe actual goal of communism has never been attained in practice from a Marxist position, though anarchist societies have provided a glimpse of what a communist world would look like. The real idea behind it is to abolish all leadership, and govern with a [[commune]]. That is, the people themselves make all decisions, and everyone contributing to the wellbeing of the [[State (polity)|commune]]. In practice, most governments that have claimed to be communist have been [[totalitarian]] [[dictatorships]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe modern political marxist communist movement was created when the social democratic parties of Europe split between their rightist and leftist tendencies during World War I.  The leftists, led internationally by [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Karl Liebknecht]], to distinguish their brand of socialism from the \"[[reformist]]\" social democrats, were called \"communists\".  However, after Luxemburg's and Liebknecht's murders the term communist became generally associated solely with the parties and organisations following Lenin, along with their various derivations, such as [[Stalinism]] or [[Maoism]].\n\nThere is a considerable variety of views among self-identified communists. However, [[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]], [[school (discipline)|schools]] of communism associated with Karl Marx and of Vladimir Lenin respectively, have the distinction of having been a major force in world politics since the early 20th century. [[Class struggle]] plays a central role in Marxism. This theory views the formation of communism as the culmination of the class struggle between the capitalist class, the owners of most of the capital and the working class. Marx held that society could not be transformed from the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] to the communist mode of production all at once, but required a transitional state which Marx described as the revolutionary [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].\n\nSome forms of the communist society that Marx envisioned, as emerging from capitalism, have been claimed to be achieved for limited periods during certain historical moments and under certain circumstances. For example, the [[Paris Commune]] in fact let Marx reinforce and implement his theories by adapting them to a real experience he could draw from. Another similar case, though disputed by [[anarcho-syndicalism]] or even [[anarchism]], was the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] of 1936 (often missed or unmentioned by official [[historiography]]), during which much of Spain's economy in most of [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] areas, some of which enjoyed a practical absence of [[State (polity)|state]], was put under workers' direct collective control.\n\nIn addition to this, the term communism (as well as socialism) is often used to refer to those political and economic systems and states dominated by a political, bureaucratic class, typically attached to one [[One-party state|single]] [[Communist party]] that follow Marxist-Leninist doctrines and often claim to represent the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] in a non-democratic fashion, described by critics as in a [[totalitarian]] and [[bureaucratic]]. These systems are also often called Stalinism, [[state capitalism]], [[state communism]] or [[state socialism]].\n\nWith the Soviet Union's creation after the end of [[Russian Civil War]] that followed to initial success of Red [[October Revolution]] in Russia, other socialist parties in other countries and the [[Bolshevik party]] itself became Communist parties, owing allegiance of varying degrees to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (see [[Communist International]]). After World War II, regimes calling themselves Communist took power in Eastern Europe. In 1949, the Communists in China, supported by Soviet Union and led by [[Mao Zedong]], came to power and established the [[People's Republic of China]]. Among the other countries in the [[Third World]] that adopted a bureaucratic [[Communist state]] as form of government at some point were Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Angola and Mozambique. By the early 1980s, almost one third of the world's population lived under Communist states.\n\nCommunism carries a strong [[social stigma]] in the United States due to a history of [[Anti-communism#United States|anti-communism in the United States]].<!--research communism in South America--> Since the early 1970s, the term [[Eurocommunism]] was used to refer to the policies of Communist parties in [[western Europe]], which sought to break with the tradition of uncritical and unconditional support of the Soviet Union. Such parties were politically active and electorally significant in France and Italy. With the collapse of the statalized [[one-party system]]s and [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] governments, in [[Eastern Europe]] from the late 1980s and the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985\u20131991)|breakup of the Soviet Union]] on December 8, 1991, [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] state communism's influence has decreased dramatically in Europe, but around a quarter of the world's population still lives under such a kind of Communist states.\n\n==== Leninism and Marxism\u2013Leninism ====\n{{main|Leninism|Marxism\u2013Leninism}}\n[[Vladimir Lenin]] never used the term Leninism, nor did he refer to his views as Marxism\u2013Leninism. However, his ideas diverged from classical Marxist theory on several important points (see the articles on Marxism and Leninism for more information). [[Bolshevik]] communists saw these differences as advancements of Marxism made by Lenin. After Lenin's death, his ideology and contributions to Marxist theory were termed \"Marxism\u2013Leninism\", or sometimes only \"Leninism\". Marxism\u2013Leninism soon became the official name for the ideology of the [[Comintern]] and of [[Communist Party|Communist parties]] around the world.\n\n==== Stalinism ====\n{{main|Stalinism}}\nStalinism was the theory and practice of [[communism]] practiced by [[Joseph Stalin]], leader of the Soviet Union from 1928\u20131953. Officially it adhered to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], but whether Stalin's practices actually followed the principles of Marx and Lenin is a subject of debate and [[Anti-Stalinist left|criticism]]. In contrast to Marx and Lenin, Stalin made few new theoretical contributions. Stalin's main contributions to communist theory were ''[[Socialism in One Country]]'' and the theory of [[Aggravation of class struggle under socialism]], a theoretical base supporting the repression of political opponents as necessary. Stalinism took an aggressive stance on [[class conflict]], utilizing [[state violence]] in an attempt to forcibly purge society of the [[bourgeoisie]].<ref>Stephen Kotkin.

Even when the [[proletariat]] has seized state power through a socialist [[revolution]], the potential remains for a [[bourgeoisie]] to restore capitalism. Indeed, Mao famously stated that \"the bourgeoisie [in a socialist country] is right inside the Communist Party itself\", implying that corrupt Party officials would subvert socialism if not prevented.\n\nUnlike the earlier forms of Marxism-Leninism in which the urban [[proletariat]] was seen as the main source of revolution, and the countryside was largely ignored, Mao focused on the peasantry as a revolutionary force which, he said, could be mobilized by a Communist Party with their knowledge and leadership.\n\nUnlike most other political ideologies, including other [[socialist]] and Marxist ones, Maoism contains an integral [[military]] doctrine and explicitly connects its political ideology with [[military strategy]]. In Maoist thought, \"political power comes from the barrel of the gun\" (one of Mao's quotes), and the [[peasantry]] can be mobilized to undertake a \"[[people's war]]\" of armed struggle involving [[guerrilla warfare]].\n\nSince the death of Mao and the reforms of Deng, most of the parties explicitly defining themselves as \"Maoist\" have disappeared, but various communist groups around the world, particularly armed ones like the [[Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]], the [[Communist Party of India (Maoist)|CPI (Maoist)]] and [[Communist Party of India (Marxist\u2013Leninist)|CPI (ML)]] of India and the [[New People's Army]] of the [[Philippines]], continue to advance Maoist ideas and get press attention for them. These groups generally have the idea that Mao's ideas were betrayed before they could be fully or properly implemented.\n\n==== Trotskyism ====\n{{main|Trotskyism}}\nTrotskyism is the theory of Marxism as advocated by [[Leon Trotsky]].  Trotsky considered himself a [[Bolshevik]]\u2013[[Leninism|Leninist]], arguing for the establishment of a [[vanguard party]].  He considered himself an advocate of orthodox Marxism.  His politics differed greatly from those of [[Stalinism|Stalin]] or [[Maoism|Mao]], most importantly in declaring the need for an international \"[[permanent revolution]]\" and arguing that democracy is essential to both socialism and communism. Numerous groups around the world continue to describe themselves as Trotskyist and see themselves as standing in this tradition, although they have diverse interpretations of the conclusions to be drawn from this.\n\n==== Council communism and left communism ====\n{{main|Council communism|Left communism}}\nCouncil communism, or councilism, is a current of [[libertarian Marxism]] that emerged from the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319|November Revolution]] in the 1920s, characterized by its opposition to [[state capitalism]]/[[state socialism]] as well as its advocacy of [[workers' councils]] as the basis for [[Socialist state|workers' democracy]]. Originally affiliated with the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany]] (KAPD), council communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within the greater [[libertarian socialism]] movement.\n\nChief among the tenets of council communism is its opposition to the [[Vanguard party|party vanguardism]]<ref name=\"Pannekoek36\">[[Anton Pannekoek]] (1936) [http://libcom.org/library/workers-councils-book-pannekoek ''Workers\u2019 Councils'']</ref><ref>[http://libcom.org/library/notes-trotsky-pannekoek-bordiga-gilles-dauv%C3%A9 ''Notes on Trotsky, Pannekoek, Bordiga \u2013 Gilles Dauv\u00e9'']</ref> and [[democratic centralism]]<ref>Pannekoek, Anton. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/pannekoe/1936/dictatorship.htm State Capitalism and Dictatorship] International Council Correspondence, Vol.III, No.1, January 1937.</ref> of [[Leninism|Leninist ideologies]] and its contention that democratic workers' councils arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural form of working class organization and authority. Council communism also stands in contrast to [[social democracy]] through its formal rejection of both the [[reformism]] and [[parliamentarism]].<ref>Ruhle, Otto.

All left communists were supportive of the [[October Revolution]] in Russia, but retained a critical view of its development. However, some would in later years come to reject the idea that the revolution had a [[proletarian]] or [[socialist]] nature, asserting that it had simply carried out the tasks of the [[bourgeois]] revolution by creating a state capitalist system.\n\n==== Autonomism ====\n{{main|Autonomism}}\n[[File:AntonioNegri SeminarioInternacionalMundo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Antonio Negri]], main theorist of [[Autonomism#Italian autonomism|Italian autonomism]]]]\nAutonomism refers to a set of [[left-wing]] political and social movements and theories close to the [[socialism|socialist movement]]. As an identifiable theoretical system it first emerged in [[History of Italy as a Republic|Italy in the 1960s]] from [[workerist]] (''[[operaismo]]'') [[communism]]. Later, post-[[Marxism|Marxist]] and [[anarchist]] tendencies became significant after influence from the [[Situationist International|Situationists]], the failure of Italian [[far-left]] movements in the 1970s, and the emergence of a number of important theorists including [[Antonio Negri]], who had contributed to the 1969 founding of ''[[Potere Operaio]]'', Mario Tronti, [[Paolo Virno]], etc.\n\nUnlike other forms of Marxism, autonomist Marxism emphasises the ability of the working class to force changes to the organization of the capitalist system independent of the state, trade unions or political parties. Autonomists are less concerned with party political organization than other Marxists, focusing instead on self-organized action outside of traditional organizational structures. Autonomist Marxism is thus a \"bottom up\" theory: it draws attention to activities that autonomists see as everyday working class resistance to capitalism, for example absenteeism, slow working, and socialization in the workplace.\n\nThrough translations made available by Danilo Montaldi and others, the Italian autonomists drew upon previous activist research in the United States by the [[Johnson-Forest Tendency]] and in France by the group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]].\n\nIt influenced the German and Dutch Autonomen, the worldwide [[Social Centre movement]], and today is influential in Italy, France, and to a lesser extent the English-speaking countries. Those who describe themselves as autonomists now vary from Marxists to [[post-structuralism|post-structuralists]] and anarchists. The Autonomist Marxist and ''Autonomen'' movements provided inspiration to some on the revolutionary left in English speaking countries, particularly among anarchists, many of whom have adopted autonomist tactics. Some English-speaking anarchists even describe themselves as ''Autonomists''.\n\nThe Italian ''operaismo'' movement also influenced Marxist academics such as [[Harry Cleaver]], [[John Holloway (economist)|John Holloway]], Steve Wright, and [[Nick Dyer-Witheford]].\n\n=== Anarchism ===\n{{main|Anarchism}}\nAnarchism is a [[political philosophy]] that advocates [[stateless society|stateless societies]] based on non-[[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free association]]s.<ref name=\"iaf-ifa.org\"/><ref>\"That is why Anarchy, when it works to destroy authority in all its aspects, when it demands the abrogation of laws and the abolition of the mechanism that serves to impose them, when it refuses all hierarchical organization and preaches free agreement \u2014 at the same time strives to maintain and enlarge the precious kernel of social customs without which no human or animal society can exist.\" [[Peter Kropotkin]].

These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity.

Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, [[popular education]] issues, the [[general strike]] or [[antimilitarism]]. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and [[syndicalism]] (or [[trade union]]ism). The [[Federaci\u00f3n Anarquista Ib\u00e9rica|Spanish Workers Federation]] in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910.

Therefore, all workers must support one another in their [[class conflict]] to [[Wiktionary:Liberate|liberate]] themselves.\n\nAnarcho-syndicalists believe that only [[direct action]]\u2014that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal, as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position\u2014will allow workers to liberate themselves.<ref>Rocker, Rudolf.

They should not have bosses or \"business agents\"; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves.\n\n[[Rudolf Rocker]] was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labor in his 1938 pamphlet ''[[Anarcho-Syndicalism (book)|Anarcho-Syndicalism]]''. The [[International Workers Association]] is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labor unions from different countries.

Henry David Thoreau (1817\u20131862), uno de los escritores pr\u00f3ximos al movimiento de la filosof\u00eda trascendentalista, es uno de los m\u00e1s conocidos. Su obra m\u00e1s representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una caba\u00f1a en el bosque, y vivir en \u00edntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosof\u00eda trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon\u00eda de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan.

Wilde added that \"upon the other hand, Socialism itself will be of value simply because it will lead to individualism\" since individuals will no longer need to fear poverty or starvation. This individualism would, in turn, protect against governments \"armed with economic power as they are now with political power\" over their citizens. However, Wilde advocated non-capitalist individualism, saying that \"of course, it might be said that the Individualism generated under conditions of private property is not always, or even as a rule, of a fine or wonderful type\" a critique which is \"quite true\".<ref name=\"The Soul of Man\">{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/soul-of-man-under-socialism-oscar-wilde |title=The Soul of Man |publisher=Libcom.org |date=2005-09-08 |accessdate=2013-10-11}}</ref> In Wilde's imagination, in this way socialism would free men from manual labour and allow them to devote their time to creative pursuits, thus developing their soul.

Classic social democracy was a political philosophy that attempted to achieve socialism through gradual, parliamentary means and by reforming capitalism from within rather than through revolutionary means.  The term ''social democracy'' can refer to the particular kind of society that social democrats advocate.\n\nThe [[Socialist International]] (SI), the worldwide organization of social democratic and democratic socialist parties, defines social democracy as an ideal form of [[representative democracy]] that may solve the problems found in a [[liberal democracy]]. The SI emphasizes the following principles: firstly, ''freedom''\u2014not only individual liberties, but also freedom from discrimination and freedom from dependence on either the owners of the means of production or the holders of abusive political power. Secondly, ''equality and social justice''\u2014not only before the law but also economic and socio-cultural equality as well, and equal opportunities for all including those with physical, mental, or social disabilities. Finally, ''solidarity''\u2014unity and a sense of compassion for the victims of injustice and inequality.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080222070726/http://www.socialistinternational.org/4Principles/dofpeng2.html \"Declaration of Principles\"]. Socialist International.</ref>\n\nSocial democracy seeks to contain capitalism through transitioning unstable private sector enterprises into public ownership, correcting economic and social inequality through social safety nets and services (sometimes referred to as [[welfare state]] policies) and more aggressive regulation of markets and private enterprise than other forms of [[mixed economy]]. Over the past forty years, social democracy has increasingly been replaced with alternate economic systems such as the [[social market economy]] or [[Third Way]] mixed economies that are informed by [[Keynesian economics]].\n\n=== Democratic socialism ===\n{{main|Democratic socialism}}\nModern [[democratic socialism]] is a broad political movement that seeks to propagate the ideals of socialism within the context of a democratic system. Democratic socialism is closely related to social democracy and in some accounts are identical while other accounts stress differences.  Many democratic socialists support social democracy as a road to reform of the current system while others support more revolutionary change in society to establish socialist goals. Generally, social democracy is considered to be more centrist and broadly supportive of current capitalist systems (for example, the [[mixed economy]]) and the [[welfare state]] while many democratic socialists support a more fully socialist system, either through [[evolutionary socialism|evolutionary]] or [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]] means.\n\nDemocratic socialists and social democrats both advocate the concept of the [[welfare state]], but whereas most social democrats view the welfare state as the end itself, irrespective of any hierarchies of power that may persist following welfare reforms, many democratic socialists view it as the means to an egalitarian end. {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Highlighting this difference, contemporary advocates of the democratic socialist model have criticized the social democratic approach of a welfare state if it is not adequately providing socioeconomic welfare programs at the universal level. <ref name=\"Day\">{{cite web|last=Day|first=Meagan|title=Why We Need Free College for Everyone \u2014 Even Rich People|work=Jacobin Magazine (July, 2019)|url=https://jacobinmag.com/2019/07/free-college-tuition-bernie-sanders-means-testing-universal-social-programs|quote=Where a meager means-tested welfare-state model breeds alienation and competition, a robust universal welfare-state model breeds trust and cooperation.

The mostly secular ideology often contrasts with that of other Arab governments in the Middle East, which sometimes lean towards [[Islamism]] and [[theocracy]]. The Ba'athists have persecuted socialists in their own countries. In Iraq, the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] assisted Iraq with a list of communists to eliminate, effectively wiping them out. Socialist Lynn Walsh argues that the Iraqi Ba'athists promoted capitalists from within the party and outside the country.<ref>Walsh, Lynn. ''Imperialism and the gulf war'', [http://www.socialistworld.net/publications/gulfcrisis/c5.html Chapter 5], 1990-91.</ref>\n\n==== Irish republican socialism ====\nSocialism has traditionally been part of the [[Irish republican]] movement since the early 20th century, when [[James Connolly]], an Irish [[Marxist]] theorist, took part in the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916.  Today, most Irish nationalist and Republican organizations located in [[Northern Ireland]] advocate some form of socialism, both Marxist and non-Marxist.  The [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] which until recently was the largest nationalist party in Northern Ireland promotes social democracy while militant Republican parties such as [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], [[Republican Sinn F\u00e9in]], and the [[32 County Sovereignty Movement]] all promote their own varieties of democratic socialism intended to re-distribute wealth on an all-island basis once a [[united Ireland]] has been achieved.  The [[Irish Republican Socialist Movement]], encompassing the [[Irish Republican Socialist Party]] and [[Irish National Liberation Army]] as well as the defunct [[Official Irish Republican Army]] and Irish National Liberation Front are known for promoting an ideology which combines [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninism]] with traditional revolutionary militant Republicanism and is said to be the most direct fulfillment of Connolly's legacy.\n\n=== Eco-socialism ===\n{{main|Eco-socialism}}\nMerging aspects of Marxism, [[socialism]], [[environmentalism]], anarchism and [[ecology]], Eco-socialists generally believe that the capitalist system is the cause of [[social exclusion]], [[Economic inequality|inequality]] and [[environmental degradation]]. Eco-socialists criticise many within the [[Green movement]] for not going far enough in their critique of the current world system and for not being overtly [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]]. At the same time, Eco-socialists would blame the traditional Left for overlooking or not properly addressing ecological problems.<ref name=Babylon>Wall, D., ''Babylon and Beyond: The Economics of Anti-Capitalist, Anti-Globalist and Radical Green Movements'', 2005</ref> Eco-socialists are [[anti-globalisation]]. [[Joel Kovel]] sees [[globalisation]] as a force driven by capitalism \u2013 in turn, the rapid [[economic growth]] encouraged by globalisation causes acute ecological crises.<ref name=Kovel>Kovel, J., ''The Enemy of Nature'', 2002</ref>\n\nEco-socialism goes beyond a criticism of the actions of large corporations and targets the inherent properties of capitalism. Such an analysis follows [[Marxism|Marx's]] theories about the contradiction between [[use value]]s and [[exchange value]]s. As [[Joel Kovel]] explains, within a market economy, goods are not produced to meet needs but are produced to be exchanged for money that we then use to acquire other goods. As we have to keep selling to keep buying, we must persuade others to buy our goods just to ensure our survival, which leads to the production of goods with no previous use that can be sold to sustain our ability to buy other goods. Eco-socialists like Kovel stress that this contradiction has reached a destructive extent, where certain essential activities such as caring for relatives full-time and basic subsistence are unrewarded while unnecessary economic activities earn certain individuals huge fortunes.<ref name=Kovel/>\n\n[[Agrarian socialism]] is another variant of eco-socialism.\n\n==== Green anarchism ====\n{{main|Green anarchism}}\nGreen anarchism, or eco-anarchism, is a school of thought within [[anarchism]] which puts a particular emphasis on [[environmental issues]]. An important early influence was the thought of the American [[individualist anarchist]] [[Henry David Thoreau]] and his book ''[[Walden]]''.<ref name=\"Thoreau\">\"Su obra m\u00e1s representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una caba\u00f1a en el bosque, y vivir en \u00edntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosof\u00eda trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon\u00eda de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por [[John Zerzan]]. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar tambi\u00e9n motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX.\"[http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html \"LA INSUMISI\u00d3N VOLUNTARIA.

It opposes Western [[imperialism]] and calls for the ethnic \"awakening\" or \"resurrection\" of the [[Arabs|Arab people]] into a single united state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baath-party.org/eng/constitution1.htm|title=The Baath Arab Socialist Party National Leadership|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n''Ba'ath'', also spelled as ''Ba'th'' or ''Baath'', means resurrection or renaissance. The party's motto, \"Unity, Liberty, Socialism\" (''wahda, hurriya, ishtirakiya''), was inspired by the French [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] political doctrine linking national unity and social equity.<ref name='Histoire  de Saint-Just D\u00e9put\u00e9 de la Convention Nationale'>{{cite news |first=Ernest |last=Hamel |title=Histoire de Saint-Just D\u00e9put\u00e9 de la Convention Nationale |year=1859 |publisher=Impr. et Librairie Poulet-Malassis et Broise}}</ref> In the slogan, \"unity\" refers to Arab unity, \"liberty\" emphasizes being free from foreign control and interference, and \"socialism\" refers to [[Arab socialism]], not European-style [[Marxism]] or [[communism]].\n\nThe party was founded in [[Damascus]], [[Syria]] in 1940 by the Syrian intellectuals [[Michel Aflaq]] and [[Salah al-Bitar]], and since its inception, it has established branches in different Arab countries, although the only countries it has ever held power in are Syria and [[Iraq]]. Aflaq and al-Bitar both studied at the [[Sorbonne]] in the early 1930s, at a time when [[centre-left]] [[Positivism]] was still the dominant ideology amongst France's academic elite. The Ba'ath party included a significant number of [[Christian Arabs]] among its founding members. For them, a resolutely nationalist and secular political framework was a suitable way to avoid a faith-based Islamic orientation and to give non-Muslims full acknowledgement as citizens.\n\nIn 1955, a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] by the military against the historical leadership of Aflaq and al-Bitar led the Syrian and Iraqi parties to split into rival organizations\u2014the Qotri (Regionalist) Syria-based party and the Qawmi (Nationalist) Iraq-based party.<ref name='The Struggle for Power in Syria: Sectarianism, Regionalism and Tribalism in Politics'>{{cite news |first=Nikolaos |last=van Dam |title=The Struggle for Power in Syria: Sectarianism, Regionalism and Tribalism in Politics |year=1979 |publisher=I B Tauris}}</ref>  Both Ba'ath parties kept their names and maintained parallel structures, but became so antagonistic that the Syrian Ba'ath government became the only Arab government to support non-Arab [[Iran]] against Iraq during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]].\n\nIn Syria, the Ba'ath Party has had a [[monopoly]] on political power since the party's 1963 coup. Ba'athists seized power in Iraq in 1963, but were deposed months later. They  returned to power in a 1968 coup and remained the sole party of government until the [[2003 Iraq invasion]].

The party sought independence from French colonial rule in [[Vietnam]] during the early 20th century. Its origins lie in the mid-1920s, when a group of young Hanoi-based intellectuals began publishing revolutionary material. From 1928, the VNQD\u0110 attracted attention through its assassinations of French officials and Vietnamese collaborators. During the 1930s, the party was eclipsed by [[Ho Chi Minh]]'s [[Indochinese Communist Party]] (ICP). Vietnam was occupied by [[Imperial Japan|Japan]] during World War II and in the chaos that followed the Japanese surrender in 1945 the VNQD\u0110 and the ICP briefly joined forces in the fight for Vietnamese independence. After a falling out, Ho purged the VNQD\u0110, leaving his communist-dominated [[Viet Minh]] unchallenged as the foremost anti-colonial militant organisation. As a part of the post-war settlement that ended the [[First Indochina War]], Vietnam was [[Partition of Vietnam|partitioned into two zones]]. The remnants of the VNQD\u0110 fled to the anti-communist [[South Vietnam|south]], where they remained until the [[Fall of Saigon]] in 1975 and the reunification of Vietnam under communist rule.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Socialism}}\n{{cols|colwidth=16em}}\n* [[Anarchism]]\n* [[Anarchist economics]]\n* [[Anarchist schools of thought]]\n* [[Authoritarian socialism]]\n* [[Christian socialism]]\n* [[Communism]]\n* [[Democratic socialism]]\n* [[Ethical socialism]]\n* [[History of anarchism]]\n* [[History of communism]]\n* [[History of socialism]]\n* [[Labour movement]]\n* \"[[The labor problem]]\"\n* [[Left-libertarianism]]\n* [[Liberal socialism]]\n* [[Libertarianism]]\n* [[Libertarian socialism]]\n* [[List of communist ideologies]]\n* [[Market socialism]]\n* [[Marxian economics]]\n* [[Marxism]]\n* [[Marxist schools of thought]]\n* [[Mutualism (economic theory)]]\n* [[Reformism]]\n* [[Revolutionary socialism]]\n* [[Social democracy]]\n* [[Socialism]]\n* [[Socialist economics]]\n* [[Socialist mode of production]]\n* [[Socialist state]]\n* [[State socialism]]\n* [[Syndicalism]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* G.

The governor\u2019s office was flooded with letters from an outraged Kurmi-kshatriya public and was soon obliged to rescind the allegation in an 1896 communique to the police department \"His Honor [the governor] is ... of the opinion that Kurmis constitute a respectable community which he would be reluctant to exclude from Government service.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=William R. |last=Pinch|title=Peasants and monks in British India|url=https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc|url-access=registration |year=1996|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20061-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc/page/89 89]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe first Kurmi caste association had been formed in 1894 at [[Lucknow]] to protest against the police recruitment policy.

In the north, these observers claimed, a field of 'second-rate barley' would belong to a Rajput or Brahman who took pride in shunning the plough and secluding his womenfolk. Such a man was to be blamed for his own decline, fecklessly mortgaging and then selling off his lands to maintain his unproductive dependents. By the same logic, a flourishing field of wheat would belong to a non-twice-born tiller, wheat being a crop requiring skill and enterprise on the part of the cultivator.

The governor\u2019s office was flooded with letters from an outraged Kurmi-kshatriya public and was soon obliged to rescind the allegation in an 1896 communique to the police department \"His Honor [the governor] is ... of the opinion that Kurmis constitute a respectable community which he would be reluctant to exclude from Government service.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=William R. |last=Pinch|title=Peasants and monks in British India|url=https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc|url-access=registration |year=1996|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-20061-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc/page/89 89]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe first Kurmi caste association had been formed in 1894 at [[Lucknow]] to protest against the police recruitment policy. This was followed by an organisation in Awadh that sought to draw other communities&nbsp;\u2014 such as the [[Patidar]]s, [[Maratha]]s, [[Kapu]]s, [[Reddy]]s and [[Naidu]]s&nbsp;\u2014 under the umbrella of the Kurmi name. This body then campaigned for Kurmis to classify themselves as Kshatriya in the 1901 census and, in 1910, led to the formation of the [[All India Kurmi Kshatriya Mahasabha]].<ref name=Jaffrelot2003p197>{{cite book |title=India's silent revolution: the rise of the lower castes in North India |page=197 |first=Christophe |last=Jaffrelot |publisher=C.

They lost badly but in 1934 the three communities formed the [[Triveni Sangh]] political party, which allegedly had a million dues-paying members by 1936. However, the organisation was hobbled by competition from the Congress-backed [[Backward Class]] Federation, which was formed around the same time, and by co-option of community leaders by the Congress party. The Triveni Sangh suffered badly in the 1937 elections, although it did win in some areas. The organisation also suffered from caste rivalries, notably the superior organisational ability of the higher castes who opposed it, as well as the inability of the Yadavs to renounce their belief that they were natural leaders and that the Kurmi were somehow inferior. Similar problems beset a later planned caste union, the ''Raghav Samaj'', with the Koeris.<ref name=Jaffrelot2003p197/>\n\nAgain in the 1970s, the India Kurmi Kshatriya Sabha attempted to bring the Koeris under their wing, but disunity troubled this alliance.<ref>{{cite news |first=Akshaya |last=Mukul |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/young-india-votes/news/Mighty-Kurmis-of-Bihar/articleshow/555124.cms |title=Mighty Kurmis of Bihar |work=The Times of India |date=12 March 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Fernandes to head Janata Dal (United) | url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/2003/10/31/stories/2003103104371100.htm | author=Gargi Parsai | date=31 October 2003 | newspaper=The Hindu | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65xylZw3k?url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/2003/10/31/stories/2003103104371100.htm | archivedate=6 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nMany private caste-based armies surfaced in Bihar between the 1970s and 1990s, largely influenced by landlord farmers reacting to the growing influence of left extremist groups.

As stated in a letter for Reverend John Leland to President [[Thomas Jefferson]], the Cheese was made \"without the assistance of a single slave.\"\n\nThe townspeople brought their milk (According to Dumas Malone's biography on President Thomas Jefferson, the cheese was made from the milk of 900 cows) and curd to the mill where a large hoop was placed on a cider press, resulting in a massive cheese press.  The townspeople added their ingredients, sang a [[hymn]] over the press, and, after a time, the cheese was ready.<ref name=TGM/>  As more ingredients than were necessary were presented, three smaller cheeses were created,<ref name=Hayward>John Hayward, ''A gazetteer of the United States of America...'', 1854.</ref> but Leland dedicated the largest cheese to Jefferson, calling the cheese \"the greatest cheese ever put to press in the New World or Old.\"<ref name=TGM/>\n\nThe final product weighed {{convert|1235|lb}}, was {{convert|4|ft}} wide, and {{convert|15|in}} thick.<ref name=TGM/><ref name=NEH>Joseph Barlow Felt, ''New-England Historical and Genealogical Register and Antiquarian Journal '',  1870.</ref><ref name=Berkshire>David Dudley Field, Chester Dewey, Berkshire Association, ''A History of the County of Berkshire, Massachusetts, in Two Parts...'', 1829.</ref><ref name=ATN>David Lillard, ''Appalachian Trail Names: Origins of Place Names Along the AT''.

After floating down the Hudson River (North River) to NYC, the mammoth cheese was loaded onto the sloop Astrea and taken to Baltimore where it was loaded onto a horse drawn wagon for the trip to Washington. The three-week, {{convert|500|mi|adj=on}} trip became an event from town to town as word spread about the gift.{{clarify|date=October 2015}}<ref name=TGM/>\n\n==Delivery to the White House==\nThe cheese was eventually presented to Jefferson on January 1, 1802.  Leland considered the cheese an act of \"profound respect...to the popular ratification of his election.\"  While the cheese did serve to praise Jefferson, the town also made a political statement in its letter to Jefferson, noting that \"the cheese was procured by the personal labor of freeborn farmers with the voluntary and cheerful aid of their wives and daughters, without the assistance of a single slave.\"<ref name=ATN/> Although the gift would draw criticisms of Jefferson and the people of Cheshire,<ref>Robert Baylor Semple, ''A History of the Rise and Progress of the Baptists in Virginia''.  Pitt & Dickenson, 1894.</ref> Jefferson praised the act as \"extraordinary proof of the skill with which those domestic arts...are practiced by [the citizens of Cheshire].\"  The President then cut a piece of the cheese to present to the town, and it was widely considered the greatest cheese presented at the [[White House]].<ref name=TGM/>  Jefferson, who opposed the gift giving custom on principle, gave a $200 donation (over 50% of the actual market price<ref>John Whitcomb, Claire Whitcomb, ''Real Life at the White House: Two Hundred Years of Daily Life at America's Most Famous Residence''.

President [[Andrew Jackson]]'s supporters commissioned a similar cheese for consumption in 1837, as his supporters believed that \"every honor which Jefferson had ever received should be paid him.\"<ref>Benjamin Perley Poore, ''Perley's Reminiscences of Sixty Years in the National Metropolis''.  1886.</ref>  This event later became the inspiration for a recurring event on the White House [[television drama]] ''[[The West Wing]]'', entitled \"[[Big Block of Cheese Day]].\"<ref>''The West Wing'', episodes 105 (\"[[The Crackpots and These Women]]\") and 216 (\"[[Somebody's Going to Emergency, Somebody's Going to Jail]]\").</ref> The cheese inspired a critically acclaimed work of fiction, ''The Mammoth Cheese'', by [[Sheri Holman]] in 2004 and published by the [[Grove Press]], which told the story about a small town cheesemaker convinced by her pastor to make a giant cheese for the President-elect.<ref>The Grove Press [http://www.groveatlantic.com product listing]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216204118/http://www.groveatlantic.com/ |date=February 16, 2007 }}.

Produced and distributed by [[20th Century Fox]], the series began with ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' (1987), directed by [[John McTiernan]], and was followed by three sequels, ''[[Predator 2]]'' (1990), ''[[Predators (film)|Predators]]'' (2010), and ''[[The Predator (film)|The Predator]]'' (2018), directed by [[Stephen Hopkins (director)|Stephen Hopkins]], [[Nimr\u00f3d Antal]], and [[Shane Black]], respectively. The series has led to numerous [[novel]]s, [[comics]], and [[video game]] [[Predator (franchise)#Other media|spin-offs]] such as ''[[Predator: Concrete Jungle]]'' released in 2005 to generally mixed reviews. The [[Alien vs. Predator (franchise)|''Alien vs. Predator'' franchise]] combines the continuities of the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' franchise]] with the ''Predator'' franchise and consists of two films as well as varying series of comics, books, and video games.\n\n==Setting==\nThe ''Predator'' franchise depicts a series of deadly encounters between humanity and a hostile, trophy hunting, extraterrestrial species known as the [[Predator (fictional species)|Predators]]. Predominantly transpiring in the present day of the 20th and 21st century, the series comprises films that, while largely independent, portray human confrontations with Predators in different locations and time zones. The franchise's sole recurring plot detail has mercenaries and corporations, including the OWLF (The Other Worldly Life Forms Program) headed by CIA agent Peter Keyes and its successor Project Stargazer (with ties to Yutani Corporation and their eventual collaborative work with Weyland Corporation in developing interstellar travel among other advanced technologies) headed by his son Sean Keyes, tracking the Predators whenever they appear. Both groups pursue them for different reasons, the former to eliminate them because they are seen as terrible threats, and the latter to capture them for scientific and military purposes.\n\n==Background==\n''Predator'' was [[John McTiernan]]'s first studio film as director. The studio hired screenplay writer [[Shane Black]] to not only play a supporting role in the film, but to keep an eye on McTiernan due to the director's inexperience.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cinephiliabeyond.org/predator-john-mctiernans-first-studio-gig-became-epic-action-classic/ |title=\u2018Predator\u2019: John McTiernan\u2019s First Studio Gig that Became an Epic Action Classic |work=Cinephilia & Beyond |accessdate=September 13, 2019}}</ref> [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] was originally cast as the film's creature,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teletext.co.uk/bigscreen/your-film-views/2c716751d7abb28f897edd93c630b4ef/Vortex+Van+Damme+in+Predator.aspx |title=Teletext Big Screen Vortex |publisher=Teletext.co.uk |date= |accessdate=March 3, 2009}}</ref> the idea being that the physical action star would use his martial arts skills to make the creature an agile, [[ninja]]-esque hunter.

While flying to Japan with ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' director [[James Cameron]], Winston, who had been hired to design the Predator, was doing concept art on the flight. Cameron saw what he was drawing and said, \"I always wanted to see something with [[Mandible (arthropod mouthpart)|mandibles]]\", and Winston subsequently included them in his designs.<ref name=\"jcvd-denofgeek\" /> Schwarzenegger recommended Winston after his experience working on ''[[The Terminator]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2012/06/25th-anniversary-5-things-you-might-not-know-about-predator-109412/ |title=25th Anniversary: 5 Things You Might Not Know About \u2018Predator\u2019 |work=Indie Wire |first=Drew |last=Tayler |date=June 12, 2012 |accessdate=October 20, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/the-predator-movies-behind-scenes-hidden-trivia/ |title=20 Crazy Details Behind The Making Of The Predator Movies |work=Screen Rant |first=Jason |last=Wojnar |date=September 11, 2018 |accessdate=October 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe film's creature was originally designed with a long neck, a [[dog]]-like head and a single eye. This design was abandoned when it became apparent that the jungle locations would make shooting the complex design too difficult. Originally, the studio contracted the makeup effects for the alien from [[Richard Edlund]]'s ''Boss Film Creature Shop''. However, with problems filming the creature in Mexico and attempts to create a convincing monster of Van Damme, wearing a much different body suit, failing, makeup effects responsibilities were given to Winston and his studio, [[R/GA|R/Greenberg Associates]]. According to former ''Boss Film Creature Shop'' makeup supervisor Steve Johnson, the makeup failed because of an impractical design by McTiernan that included {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=mid|-length}} extensions that gave the creature a backward bent [[satyr]]-leg. The design did not work in the jungle locations. After six weeks of shooting in the jungles of [[Palenque]], [[Mexico]], the production had to shut down so that Winston could make the new creature. This took eight months and then filming resumed for five weeks.<ref name=\"stanwinstonschool.com\"/>\n\nThe clicking sound of the creature was provided by [[Peter Cullen]]. Despite his resolution not to voice any more monsters following injuries to his throat sustained during the [[Dubbing (filmmaking)#Automated Dialogue Replacement / post-sync|ADR]] of [[King Kong (1976 film)|''King Kong'']], his agent convinced him to audition. The clicking sound was inspired by a mixture of the visual of the creature and his recollection of a dying horseshoe crab.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=62478 |title=Prime Directive: An Exclusive Interview with Peter Cullen |publisher=dvdtimes.co.uk |accessdate=2009-09-08 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nR/Greenberg Associates created the film's optical effects, including the creature's ability to become [[invisible]], its [[thermal vision]] point-of-view, its glowing blood, and the [[electric spark]] effects. The invisibility effect was achieved by having someone in a bright [[Chroma key|red suit]] (because it was the farthest opposite of the green of the jungle and the blue of the sky) the size of the creature. The take was then repeated without the actors using a 30% wider lens on the camera. When the two takes were combined optically, a vague outline of the alien could be seen with the background scenery bending around its shape. For the thermal vision, [[infrared film]] could not be used because it did not register in the range of [[Thermoregulation|body temperature]] [[wavelength]]s. The glowing blood was achieved by green liquid from [[glow stick|chem-lite sticks]] used by campers. The electrical sparks were [[Rotoscoping|rotoscoped]] animation using white paper pin registered on portable light tables to black-and-white prints of the film frames. The drawings were [[compositing|composited]] by the optical crew for the finished effects.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://vfxblog.com/2017/06/12/predator-vfx-optical-red-suit-thermal-camera/ |title=\u2018Predator\u2019: VFX supe Joel Hynek recalls the days of optical compositing, thermal cameras and *that* red suit |work=vfxblog |first=Ian |last=Failes |date=June 12, 2017 |accessdate=October 20, 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3505508/r-p-richard-alan-greenberg-predator-visual-effects-artist-little-monsters-director/ |title=R.I.P.

Weathers also stated that he would act as if his physique was naturally given to him, and would work out only after all the other actors were nowhere to be seen. It was reported that actor [[Sonny Landham]] was so unstable on the set that a bodyguard was hired; not to protect Landham, but to protect the other cast members from him.<ref>''Predator - Special Edition'' (DVD) (2006)</ref>\n\nAccording to Schwarzenegger, filming was physically demanding as he had to swim in very cold water and spent three weeks covered in mud for the climactic battle with the alien. In addition, cast and crew endured very cold temperatures in the Mexican jungle that required [[heat lamp]]s to be on all of the time. Schwarzenegger also faced the challenge of working with Kevin Peter Hall who could not see in the creature's suit. Hall could not see out of the mask and had to rehearse his scenes with it off and then memorize where everything was.\n\nThe film was particularly successful and subsequently inspired a number of [[comic book]]s, [[video game]]s and popular [[anecdote]]s within the media. Schwarzenegger was asked to reprise his role in a ''Predator'' sequel, but was already attached to ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' and could not accept the role. The character was rewritten from the developing sequel's script, and the sequel to ''Predator'', directed by [[Stephen Hopkins (director)|Stephen Hopkins]], was scheduled for 1990.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/5278126/robert-rodriguez-wants-arnold-schwarzenegger-for-predators |title=Robert Rodriguez Wants Arnold Schwarzenegger For Predators |work=Gizmodo |first=Alasdair |last=Wilkins |date=June 4, 2009 |accessdate=October 21, 2019 }}</ref>\n\nDue to excessive violence, ''[[Predator 2]]'' was the first film to be given the newly instituted [[NC-17]] rating in the United States. It was eventually rated R by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] after being re-cut to its final theatrical length.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/movies-originally-rated-x-nc-17-shocking/12/?v=6&n=f |title=Predator 2 |work=Screen Rant |accessdate=October 21, 2019}}</ref> The film cast [[Danny Glover]] in the lead role, and reprised Kevin Peter Hall as the Predator. Also, returning to the role of [[List of Predator characters#Anna|Anna]] in the sequel, [[Elpidia Carrillo]] was slated to be in two scenes but was cut back to a brief appearance on a video screen in the government agents' surveillance trailer.

The map on which General Philips shows Dutch where the helicopter went down (not intended to be identifiable to the audience) shows the Brazilian municipality of [[Parnagu\u00e1]] and some of the surrounding ''[[Chapada das Mangabeiras]]'' mountain range area. The novelization of the first film places events as occurring in [[Guatemala]], which is also given as their location in the later sequel ''Predators''.</ref> Army Special Operations and Vietnam Veteran Major Alan \"Dutch\" Schaefer<ref group=notes name=\"aboutdutch\">Dutch's full name is never given in the film although the script, novelization, and some merchandise give his name as Alan \"Dutch\" Schaefer.</ref> and his elite rescue team \u2014 Mac, Billy, Blain, Poncho, and Hawkins \u2014 are tasked by Dutch's former commanding officer, General Philips, with rescuing a foreign official and his aide held hostage by insurgents. [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent Dillon, a former [[commando]] and an old friend of Dutch from [[Vietnam War]], is assigned to supervise the team over Dutch's objections.\n\nThe team discovers the wreckage of a helicopter and three skinned corpses, identified by Dutch as [[Green Berets]] out of [[Fort Bragg]] that he knew personally. Dutch's team reaches the insurgent camp and kills the insurgents, including a Soviet [[espionage|intelligence]] officer searching through valuable documents. Confronted by Dutch, Dillon admits the mission was a [[frame-up|setup]] to retrieve intelligence from captured operatives and that the dead military unit disappeared weeks earlier in a failed rescue.\n\nAfter capturing Anna, a [[guerrilla]], the team proceeds to its extraction point, unaware that it is being tracked with [[thermal imaging]] by an unseen observer. Anna escapes and is chased by Hawkins, but they are ambushed by the creature. It spares Anna but kills Hawkins and drags his body away. Dutch organizes a search for Hawkins' body, during which Blain is killed by the creature's plasma weapon. Enraged, Mac initiates a firefight in which the creature is wounded, revealing luminescent green blood. The unit regroups and realizes that something in the jungle is stalking them. Dillon believes more guerrillas are responsible, but Billy is adamant that the perpetrator is not human, an assertion that is met with skepticism. The team makes camp for the night, setting traps in all directions.\n\nThat night the traps are set off, and Mac kills a wild pig, mistaking it for the creature. In the confusion, the creature steals Blain's body and Dutch realizes that their enemy uses the trees to travel, stalking them like a predator. A second attempt to capture the creature using traditional trapping techniques such as a net and pitfall actually succeeds but it escapes leaving Poncho injured. Mac and Dillon pursue the alien, but it outmaneuvers and kills them. The creature catches up with the others, killing Billy and Poncho and wounding Dutch. Realizing the creature does not target unarmed prey because there is \"no sport\" in it, Dutch sends Anna to the helicopter unarmed. The creature pursues Dutch into a river and its cloaking device malfunctions. The creature, now visible, goes within a few feet of a mud-covered Dutch. His thermal signature reduced, Dutch remains unseen by the creature and it moves on. Dutch realizes he can use mud as camouflage.\n\nWhile the creature collects trophies from the bodies, Dutch crafts traps and weapons and lures the creature out with a war cry and fire. Dutch disables the creature's cloaking device and inflicts minor injuries but falls into a river, losing his mud cover, and is pinned by the creature. Acknowledging Dutch as a worthy foe and wishing to fight him in equal terms because of the [[policies]] of his civilization, the creature discards its mask and plasma caster and engages him in hand-to-hand combat. Dutch is almost beaten, but manages to crush the creature under a trap's counterweight. As the creature lies dying, it activates a [[self-destruct]] device while laughing maniacally in Billy's voice.

Expansions upon this [[Shared fictional universe|shared universe]] between the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' and ''Predator'' franchises followed, through comics and video games, until a film franchise was launched with the release of ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' in 2004, followed by the sequel ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]'' in 2007, with an eventual [[Alien vs. Predator (franchise)#Future|third film]] being a possibility. The franchise has spawned various comics, novels, video games, and other merchandise based upon or inspired by the films.\n\n===''Alien vs. Predator'' (2004)===\n{{main|Alien vs. Predator (film)}}\n\nIn 2004, a Predator mothership arrives in [[Earth]] orbit to draw humans to an ancient Predator training ground on [[Bouvet Island|Bouvet\u00f8ya]], an island about one thousand miles north of [[Antarctica]]. A buried [[pyramid]] giving off a \"heat bloom\" attracts a group of explorers led by billionaire and self-taught engineer Charles Bishop Weyland ([[Lance Henriksen]]), the original founder and CEO of Weyland Industries, who unknowingly activates an Alien egg production line as a hibernating Alien Queen is awakened within the pyramid. Three Predators descend unto the planet and enters the structure, killing all humans in their way with the intention of hunting the newly formed Aliens, while the scattered explorers are captured alive by Aliens and implanted with embryos. Two Predators die in the ensuing battle with an Alien. The third Predator allies itself with the lone surviving human, Alexa \"Lex\" Woods ([[Sanaa Lathan]]), while in their way out of the pyramid as it is destroyed by the Predator's wrist bomb and eventually battles with the escaped Alien Queen on the surface. The Queen is defeated by being dragged down by a water tower into the dark depths of the frozen sea, but not before she fatally wounds the last Predator. The orbiting Predator mothership uncloaks and the crew retrieves the fallen Predator. A Predator elder gives Lex a spear as a sign of respect, and then departs. Once in orbit it is revealed that an Alien [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Chestburster|Chestburster]] was present within the corpse, thus a Predalien hybrid is born.\n\n===''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'' (2007)===\n{{main|Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem}}\n\nSet immediately after the events of the previous film, the [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Predalien|Predalien]] hybrid aboard the Predator scout ship, having just separated from the mothership shown in the previous film, has grown to full adult size and sets about killing the Predators aboard the ship, causing it to crash in the small town of [[Gunnison, Colorado]]. The last surviving Predator activates a distress beacon containing a video recording of the Predalien, which is received by a [[veteran]] Predator on the Predator homeworld, who sets off towards Earth to \"clean up\" the infestation. When it arrives, the Predator tracks the Aliens into a section of the sewer below the town. He removes evidence of their presence as he moves along using a corrosive blue liquid and uses a laser net to try to contain the creatures, but the Aliens still manage to escape into the town above. The Predator fashions a plasma pistol from its remaining plasma caster and hunts Aliens all across town, accidentally cutting the power to the town in the process. During a confrontation with human survivors, the Predator loses its plasma pistol. The Predator then fights the Predalien singlehandedly, and the two mortally wound one another just as the US air force drops a tactical nuclear bomb on the town, incinerating both combatants along with the Predalien's warriors and hive, as well as the few remaining humans in the town. The salvaged plasma pistol is then taken to a Ms. Yutani of the Yutani Corporation, foreshadowing an advancement in technology leading to the future events of the ''Alien'' films.\n\n===Future===\n{{main|Alien vs. Predator (franchise)#Future}}\nA third film has been variously rumored since the production of ''Requiem''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/oh-god-aliens-vs-predator-3-is-coming-vic-1405/ |title=Oh, God.

Produced and distributed by [[20th Century Fox]], the series began with ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' (1987), directed by [[John McTiernan]], and was followed by three sequels, ''[[Predator 2]]'' (1990), ''[[Predators (film)|Predators]]'' (2010), and ''[[The Predator (film)|The Predator]]'' (2018), directed by [[Stephen Hopkins (director)|Stephen Hopkins]], [[Nimr\u00f3d Antal]], and [[Shane Black]], respectively. The series has led to numerous [[novel]]s, [[comics]], and [[video game]] [[Predator (franchise)#Other media|spin-offs]] such as ''[[Predator: Concrete Jungle]]'' released in 2005 to generally mixed reviews. The [[Alien vs. Predator (franchise)|''Alien vs. Predator'' franchise]] combines the continuities of the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' franchise]] with the ''Predator'' franchise and consists of two films as well as varying series of comics, books, and video games.\n\n==Setting==\nThe ''Predator'' franchise depicts a series of deadly encounters between humanity and a hostile, trophy hunting, extraterrestrial species known as the [[Predator (fictional species)|Predators]]. Predominantly transpiring in the present day of the 20th and 21st century, the series comprises films that, while largely independent, portray human confrontations with Predators in different locations and time zones. The franchise's sole recurring plot detail has mercenaries and corporations, including the OWLF (The Other Worldly Life Forms Program) headed by CIA agent Peter Keyes and its successor Project Stargazer (with ties to Yutani Corporation and their eventual collaborative work with Weyland Corporation in developing interstellar travel among other advanced technologies) headed by his son Sean Keyes, tracking the Predators whenever they appear. Both groups pursue them for different reasons, the former to eliminate them because they are seen as terrible threats, and the latter to capture them for scientific and military purposes.\n\n==Background==\n''Predator'' was [[John McTiernan]]'s first studio film as director.

While flying to Japan with ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' director [[James Cameron]], Winston, who had been hired to design the Predator, was doing concept art on the flight. Cameron saw what he was drawing and said, \"I always wanted to see something with [[Mandible (arthropod mouthpart)|mandibles]]\", and Winston subsequently included them in his designs.<ref name=\"jcvd-denofgeek\" /> Schwarzenegger recommended Winston after his experience working on ''[[The Terminator]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2012/06/25th-anniversary-5-things-you-might-not-know-about-predator-109412/ |title=25th Anniversary: 5 Things You Might Not Know About \u2018Predator\u2019 |work=Indie Wire |first=Drew |last=Tayler |date=June 12, 2012 |accessdate=October 20, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/the-predator-movies-behind-scenes-hidden-trivia/ |title=20 Crazy Details Behind The Making Of The Predator Movies |work=Screen Rant |first=Jason |last=Wojnar |date=September 11, 2018 |accessdate=October 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe film's creature was originally designed with a long neck, a [[dog]]-like head and a single eye. This design was abandoned when it became apparent that the jungle locations would make shooting the complex design too difficult. Originally, the studio contracted the makeup effects for the alien from [[Richard Edlund]]'s ''Boss Film Creature Shop''. However, with problems filming the creature in Mexico and attempts to create a convincing monster of Van Damme, wearing a much different body suit, failing, makeup effects responsibilities were given to Winston and his studio, [[R/GA|R/Greenberg Associates]]. According to former ''Boss Film Creature Shop'' makeup supervisor Steve Johnson, the makeup failed because of an impractical design by McTiernan that included {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=mid|-length}} extensions that gave the creature a backward bent [[satyr]]-leg. The design did not work in the jungle locations. After six weeks of shooting in the jungles of [[Palenque]], [[Mexico]], the production had to shut down so that Winston could make the new creature. This took eight months and then filming resumed for five weeks.<ref name=\"stanwinstonschool.com\"/>\n\nThe clicking sound of the creature was provided by [[Peter Cullen]]. Despite his resolution not to voice any more monsters following injuries to his throat sustained during the [[Dubbing (filmmaking)#Automated Dialogue Replacement / post-sync|ADR]] of [[King Kong (1976 film)|''King Kong'']], his agent convinced him to audition. The clicking sound was inspired by a mixture of the visual of the creature and his recollection of a dying horseshoe crab.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=62478 |title=Prime Directive: An Exclusive Interview with Peter Cullen |publisher=dvdtimes.co.uk |accessdate=2009-09-08 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nR/Greenberg Associates created the film's optical effects, including the creature's ability to become [[invisible]], its [[thermal vision]] point-of-view, its glowing blood, and the [[electric spark]] effects. The invisibility effect was achieved by having someone in a bright [[Chroma key|red suit]] (because it was the farthest opposite of the green of the jungle and the blue of the sky) the size of the creature. The take was then repeated without the actors using a 30% wider lens on the camera. When the two takes were combined optically, a vague outline of the alien could be seen with the background scenery bending around its shape. For the thermal vision, [[infrared film]] could not be used because it did not register in the range of [[Thermoregulation|body temperature]] [[wavelength]]s. The glowing blood was achieved by green liquid from [[glow stick|chem-lite sticks]] used by campers. The electrical sparks were [[Rotoscoping|rotoscoped]] animation using white paper pin registered on portable light tables to black-and-white prints of the film frames. The drawings were [[compositing|composited]] by the optical crew for the finished effects.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://vfxblog.com/2017/06/12/predator-vfx-optical-red-suit-thermal-camera/ |title=\u2018Predator\u2019: VFX supe Joel Hynek recalls the days of optical compositing, thermal cameras and *that* red suit |work=vfxblog |first=Ian |last=Failes |date=June 12, 2017 |accessdate=October 20, 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3505508/r-p-richard-alan-greenberg-predator-visual-effects-artist-little-monsters-director/ |title=R.I.P.

Weathers also stated that he would act as if his physique was naturally given to him, and would work out only after all the other actors were nowhere to be seen. It was reported that actor [[Sonny Landham]] was so unstable on the set that a bodyguard was hired; not to protect Landham, but to protect the other cast members from him.<ref>''Predator - Special Edition'' (DVD) (2006)</ref>\n\nAccording to Schwarzenegger, filming was physically demanding as he had to swim in very cold water and spent three weeks covered in mud for the climactic battle with the alien. In addition, cast and crew endured very cold temperatures in the Mexican jungle that required [[heat lamp]]s to be on all of the time. Schwarzenegger also faced the challenge of working with Kevin Peter Hall who could not see in the creature's suit. Hall could not see out of the mask and had to rehearse his scenes with it off and then memorize where everything was.\n\nThe film was particularly successful and subsequently inspired a number of [[comic book]]s, [[video game]]s and popular [[anecdote]]s within the media. Schwarzenegger was asked to reprise his role in a ''Predator'' sequel, but was already attached to ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' and could not accept the role. The character was rewritten from the developing sequel's script, and the sequel to ''Predator'', directed by [[Stephen Hopkins (director)|Stephen Hopkins]], was scheduled for 1990.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/5278126/robert-rodriguez-wants-arnold-schwarzenegger-for-predators |title=Robert Rodriguez Wants Arnold Schwarzenegger For Predators |work=Gizmodo |first=Alasdair |last=Wilkins |date=June 4, 2009 |accessdate=October 21, 2019 }}</ref>\n\nDue to excessive violence, ''[[Predator 2]]'' was the first film to be given the newly instituted [[NC-17]] rating in the United States. It was eventually rated R by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] after being re-cut to its final theatrical length.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/movies-originally-rated-x-nc-17-shocking/12/?v=6&n=f |title=Predator 2 |work=Screen Rant |accessdate=October 21, 2019}}</ref> The film cast [[Danny Glover]] in the lead role, and reprised Kevin Peter Hall as the Predator.

[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent Dillon, a former [[commando]] and an old friend of Dutch from [[Vietnam War]], is assigned to supervise the team over Dutch's objections.\n\nThe team discovers the wreckage of a helicopter and three skinned corpses, identified by Dutch as [[Green Berets]] out of [[Fort Bragg]] that he knew personally. Dutch's team reaches the insurgent camp and kills the insurgents, including a Soviet [[espionage|intelligence]] officer searching through valuable documents. Confronted by Dutch, Dillon admits the mission was a [[frame-up|setup]] to retrieve intelligence from captured operatives and that the dead military unit disappeared weeks earlier in a failed rescue.\n\nAfter capturing Anna, a [[guerrilla]], the team proceeds to its extraction point, unaware that it is being tracked with [[thermal imaging]] by an unseen observer. Anna escapes and is chased by Hawkins, but they are ambushed by the creature. It spares Anna but kills Hawkins and drags his body away. Dutch organizes a search for Hawkins' body, during which Blain is killed by the creature's plasma weapon. Enraged, Mac initiates a firefight in which the creature is wounded, revealing luminescent green blood. The unit regroups and realizes that something in the jungle is stalking them. Dillon believes more guerrillas are responsible, but Billy is adamant that the perpetrator is not human, an assertion that is met with skepticism. The team makes camp for the night, setting traps in all directions.\n\nThat night the traps are set off, and Mac kills a wild pig, mistaking it for the creature. In the confusion, the creature steals Blain's body and Dutch realizes that their enemy uses the trees to travel, stalking them like a predator. A second attempt to capture the creature using traditional trapping techniques such as a net and pitfall actually succeeds but it escapes leaving Poncho injured. Mac and Dillon pursue the alien, but it outmaneuvers and kills them. The creature catches up with the others, killing Billy and Poncho and wounding Dutch. Realizing the creature does not target unarmed prey because there is \"no sport\" in it, Dutch sends Anna to the helicopter unarmed. The creature pursues Dutch into a river and its cloaking device malfunctions. The creature, now visible, goes within a few feet of a mud-covered Dutch. His thermal signature reduced, Dutch remains unseen by the creature and it moves on. Dutch realizes he can use mud as camouflage.\n\nWhile the creature collects trophies from the bodies, Dutch crafts traps and weapons and lures the creature out with a war cry and fire. Dutch disables the creature's cloaking device and inflicts minor injuries but falls into a river, losing his mud cover, and is pinned by the creature. Acknowledging Dutch as a worthy foe and wishing to fight him in equal terms because of the [[policies]] of his civilization, the creature discards its mask and plasma caster and engages him in hand-to-hand combat. Dutch is almost beaten, but manages to crush the creature under a trap's counterweight. As the creature lies dying, it activates a [[self-destruct]] device while laughing maniacally in Billy's voice. Dutch takes cover just before the device explodes. He is picked up by Philips and Anna in the helicopter.\n\n===''Predator 2'' (1990)===\n{{main|Predator 2}}\nIn the record hot summer of 1997, a different Predator arrives in Los Angeles and hunts violent gang members, drawing the attention of the local police force and specifically Lieutenant Harrigan, who pursues the creature as it rampages throughout the city.

A buried [[pyramid]] giving off a \"heat bloom\" attracts a group of explorers led by billionaire and self-taught engineer Charles Bishop Weyland ([[Lance Henriksen]]), the original founder and CEO of Weyland Industries, who unknowingly activates an Alien egg production line as a hibernating Alien Queen is awakened within the pyramid. Three Predators descend unto the planet and enters the structure, killing all humans in their way with the intention of hunting the newly formed Aliens, while the scattered explorers are captured alive by Aliens and implanted with embryos. Two Predators die in the ensuing battle with an Alien. The third Predator allies itself with the lone surviving human, Alexa \"Lex\" Woods ([[Sanaa Lathan]]), while in their way out of the pyramid as it is destroyed by the Predator's wrist bomb and eventually battles with the escaped Alien Queen on the surface. The Queen is defeated by being dragged down by a water tower into the dark depths of the frozen sea, but not before she fatally wounds the last Predator. The orbiting Predator mothership uncloaks and the crew retrieves the fallen Predator. A Predator elder gives Lex a spear as a sign of respect, and then departs. Once in orbit it is revealed that an Alien [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Chestburster|Chestburster]] was present within the corpse, thus a Predalien hybrid is born.\n\n===''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'' (2007)===\n{{main|Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem}}\n\nSet immediately after the events of the previous film, the [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Predalien|Predalien]] hybrid aboard the Predator scout ship, having just separated from the mothership shown in the previous film, has grown to full adult size and sets about killing the Predators aboard the ship, causing it to crash in the small town of [[Gunnison, Colorado]]. The last surviving Predator activates a distress beacon containing a video recording of the Predalien, which is received by a [[veteran]] Predator on the Predator homeworld, who sets off towards Earth to \"clean up\" the infestation. When it arrives, the Predator tracks the Aliens into a section of the sewer below the town. He removes evidence of their presence as he moves along using a corrosive blue liquid and uses a laser net to try to contain the creatures, but the Aliens still manage to escape into the town above. The Predator fashions a plasma pistol from its remaining plasma caster and hunts Aliens all across town, accidentally cutting the power to the town in the process. During a confrontation with human survivors, the Predator loses its plasma pistol. The Predator then fights the Predalien singlehandedly, and the two mortally wound one another just as the US air force drops a tactical nuclear bomb on the town, incinerating both combatants along with the Predalien's warriors and hive, as well as the few remaining humans in the town.

The Fields were already a hallowed site for games by the time the Circus was built in 220 BC. The ''[[Taurian Games|ludi Taurei]]'' were hosted annually in the Fields since they were inaugurated by Rome's last king [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]] (d. 495 BC).<ref>{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=498-500}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2nd century BC, this broad space was encroached upon by buildings and monuments.  The circus had no permanent seating, nor were there any permanent structures to mark the perimeter of the race track. By the early 3rd century AD, the only open space that remained was a small piazza in the center, no more than 300 meters long, where the ''[[ludi]]'' (public games) had always been held.\n\nThere were many structures in the vicinity of the circus (\u201cin circo Flaminio\u201d). The [[Temple of Pietas]] lay on the edge of the [[Forum Holitorium]] to the southeast. The Temple of Mars was situated in the northwest. It is estimated that by 220 BC there were six temples, including one to [[Apollo]], in the Flaminian Fields. A theatre dedicated to Apollo was also set up in 179 BC, close to the temple of Apollo, and later rebuilt under the dictatorship of [[Caesar]]. The rebuilding of the theatre necessitated shortening the Circus itself, and required that several temples be destroyed.<ref>{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=507}}</ref> \n\nThe temple of Apollo \"''in circo''\" acquired special significance under Augustus, as a popular legend developed that he had been sired by the god while his mother [[Atia (mother of Augustus)|Atia]] was visiting the temple.<ref>{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=506}}</ref> \n\nAugustus undertook myriad new constructions around the Circus, most notably demolishing the small theater dedicated to Apollo and the temples of Diana and Pietas to build the [[Theatre of Marcellus]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=511}}</ref> Augustus also built the [[Porticus Octaviae]], which hemmed in the Circus on its northeastern side.<ref>{{cite book| url=http://archive1.village.virginia.edu/spw4s/RomanForum/GoogleEarth/AK_GE/AK_HTML/GF-008.html|title=Rome Alive: A Source Guide to the Ancient City, Vol. 1| author=Peter Aicher| publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci| year=2004}}</ref>\n\nIn AD 15, statues to the deified Augustus were erected, dedicated by [[Gaius Norbanus Flaccus (consul 15)|C. Norbanus Flaccus]]. Also inside was the [[Porticus Octaviae]]. The entrance to the piazza was marked by one of three large marble arches erected in honor of [[Germanicus]], engraved with records of his military conquests. To the east was the [[Theatre of Marcellus]].\n\nA fragment of the [[Severan marble plan]] preserves a mention of the Circus Flaminius.\n\n==Use==\nThe Circus Flaminius was never meant to rival the much larger [[Circus Maximus]], and, unlike the Circus Maximus, it was not just an entertainment venue. It almost certainly lacked a track designed for [[chariot racing]].<ref>[[T.P. Wiseman]], ''Remus: A Roman Myth'' (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 211</ref> The only ''ludi'' held there were the [[Taurian Games]], which featured horseback racing around turning posts ''(metae)''.<ref>[[Varro]], ''De lingua latina'' 5.154; also recorded by the ''[[Fasti Ostienses]]''.</ref> The obscure Taurian Games were held to [[propitiation|propitiate]] the gods of the underworld ''([[Di Inferi|di inferi]])'', and seem to have been symbolically grounded in the site itself, as they were never moved to a different circus. Equestrian events were also associated with underworld deities in other rituals and festivals in the Campus Martius. [[Strabo]] makes no mention of equestrian activities taking place in the Circus Flaminius. [[Valerius Maximus]], who is likely to be in error, is the only ancient source that claims the ''Ludi Plebeii'' ([[Plebeian Games]]) were held there. In 2 BC, the circus was flooded for the slaughter of 36 crocodiles to commemorate the building of the [[Forum of Augustus]].<ref> Cassius Dio ''Roman History'' 55.10</ref>\n\nThe Circus also hosted ceremonies related to the [[Roman triumph]], as the Flaminian Fields traditionally figured along the triumphal route towards Capitoline Hill.

The Fields were already a hallowed site for games by the time the Circus was built in 220 BC. The ''[[Taurian Games|ludi Taurei]]'' were hosted annually in the Fields since they were inaugurated by Rome's last king [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]] (d. 495 BC).<ref>{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=498-500}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2nd century BC, this broad space was encroached upon by buildings and monuments.  The circus had no permanent seating, nor were there any permanent structures to mark the perimeter of the race track. By the early 3rd century AD, the only open space that remained was a small piazza in the center, no more than 300 meters long, where the ''[[ludi]]'' (public games) had always been held.\n\nThere were many structures in the vicinity of the circus (\u201cin circo Flaminio\u201d). The [[Temple of Pietas]] lay on the edge of the [[Forum Holitorium]] to the southeast. The Temple of Mars was situated in the northwest. It is estimated that by 220 BC there were six temples, including one to [[Apollo]], in the Flaminian Fields. A theatre dedicated to Apollo was also set up in 179 BC, close to the temple of Apollo, and later rebuilt under the dictatorship of [[Caesar]]. The rebuilding of the theatre necessitated shortening the Circus itself, and required that several temples be destroyed.<ref>{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=507}}</ref> \n\nThe temple of Apollo \"''in circo''\" acquired special significance under Augustus, as a popular legend developed that he had been sired by the god while his mother [[Atia (mother of Augustus)|Atia]] was visiting the temple.<ref>{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=506}}</ref> Despite this, it was Augustus who demolished the Temple of Apollo to make way for the [[Theatre of Marcellus]], which still stands roughly at the point where the circus ended on its' northern side. Augustus also built the [[Porticus Octaviae]], which hemmed in the Circus on its northeastern side.<ref>{{cite book| url=http://archive1.village.virginia.edu/spw4s/RomanForum/GoogleEarth/AK_GE/AK_HTML/GF-008.html|title=Rome Alive: A Source Guide to the Ancient City, Vol. 1| author=Peter Aicher| publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci| year=2004}}</ref>\n\nIn AD 15, statues to the deified Augustus were erected, dedicated by [[Gaius Norbanus Flaccus (consul 15)|C. Norbanus Flaccus]]. Also inside was the [[Porticus Octaviae]]. The entrance to the piazza was marked by one of three large marble arches erected in honor of [[Germanicus]], engraved with records of his military conquests. To the east was the [[Theatre of Marcellus]].\n\nA fragment of the [[Severan marble plan]] preserves a mention of the Circus Flaminius.\n\n==Use==\nThe Circus Flaminius was never meant to rival the much larger [[Circus Maximus]], and, unlike the Circus Maximus, it was not just an entertainment venue. It almost certainly lacked a track designed for [[chariot racing]].<ref>[[T.P. Wiseman]], ''Remus: A Roman Myth'' (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 211</ref> The only ''ludi'' held there were the [[Taurian Games]], which featured horseback racing around turning posts ''(metae)''.<ref>[[Varro]], ''De lingua latina'' 5.154; also recorded by the ''[[Fasti Ostienses]]''.</ref> The obscure Taurian Games were held to [[propitiation|propitiate]] the gods of the underworld ''([[Di Inferi|di inferi]])'', and seem to have been symbolically grounded in the site itself, as they were never moved to a different circus. Equestrian events were also associated with underworld deities in other rituals and festivals in the Campus Martius. [[Strabo]] makes no mention of equestrian activities taking place in the Circus Flaminius. [[Valerius Maximus]], who is likely to be in error, is the only ancient source that claims the ''Ludi Plebeii'' ([[Plebeian Games]]) were held there. In 2 BC, the circus was flooded for the slaughter of 36 crocodiles to commemorate the building of the [[Forum of Augustus]].<ref> Cassius Dio ''Roman History'' 55.10</ref>\n\nThe Circus also hosted ceremonies related to the [[Roman triumph]], as the Flaminian Fields traditionally figured along the triumphal route towards Capitoline Hill. In 63 BC [[Lucullus|Lucius Licinius Lucullus]] celebrated his triumph in the [[Third Mithridatic War]] and exhibited his spoils in the Circus, including a solid gold statue of [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Atlas of Ancient Rome| author=Andrea Carandini| publisher=Princeton University Press| year=2017| p=506}}</ref> Augustus did the same when he exhibited the captured insignia of the enemy armies from his campaigns in [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] in the northern part of the Circus.\n\nAccording to [[Plutarch]], the Dictator [[Sulla]] massacred 6,000 prisoners in the Circus Flaminius after the [[Battle of the Colline Gate (82 BC)|Battle of the Colline Gate]] in 82 BC.

those with DLB \"might have a less favourable prognosis, with accelerated cognitive decline, shorter lifespan, and increased admission to residential care\".<ref name=Mueller2017/> An increased rate

Therapies under study as of 2019 aim to reduce brain levels of alpha-synuclein (pharmaceuticals [[ambroxol]], [[NPT200-11]], and [[E2027]]) or to use immunotherapy to reduce widespread

those with DLB \"might have a less favourable prognosis, with accelerated cognitive decline, shorter lifespan, and increased admission to residential care\".<ref name=Mueller2017/> An increased rate

Together they managed to save the Pro League club from relegation with two games to spare.\"Our predicament was not the easiest situation to inherit as the team hadn\u2019t won a league match since November 24, and in a situation like this there are numerous factors surrounding the dynamics of the team which clearly are not functioning at an optimum level. So to improve the results, whilst finding a playing style that was suited the characteristics of the playing group, was a fine balancing act but one we managed to navigate successfully.I was privileged to work in the Saudi Pro League and with their players and therefore understand deeply the affiliation they have for their country and what it means to them all as football  really is the only sport that matters there.<ref>https://www.a-league.com.au/news/aussie-coachs-success-saudi-arabia</ref>.\u201d\n\n===Double Pass===\nIn 2018, Papas was appointed Project Manager and Football Consultant for Belgian based Talent Development Company, Double Pass.

Papas was then elevated to Head Coach under Postecoglou in 2020 explaining \"I think I'm in a really good period in my career, working for someone I really respect and can learn so much from and challenge myself.

So to improve the results, whilst finding a playing style that was suited the characteristics of the playing group, was a fine balancing act but one we managed to navigate successfully.I was privileged to work in the Saudi Pro League and with their players and therefore understand deeply the affiliation they have for their country and what it means to them all as football  really is the only sport that matters there.<ref>https://www.a-league.com.au/news/aussie-coachs-success-saudi-arabia</ref>.\u201d\n\n===Double Pass===\nIn 2018, Papas was appointed Project Manager and Football Consultant for Belgian based Talent Development Company, Double Pass.

Since secondary metabolites are often created by modified primary metabolite synthases, or \"borrow\" substrates of primary metabolite origin, these categories should not be interpreted as saying that all molecules in the category are secondary metabolites (for example the steroid category), but rather that there are secondary metabolites in these categories.\n\n== Plant secondary metabolites==\nPlants are capable of producing and synthesizing diverse groups of organic compounds and are divided into two major groups: primary and secondary metabolites. Secondary metabolites are metabolic intermediates or products which are not essential to growth and life of the producing plants but rather required for interaction of plants with their environment and produced in response to stress. Their antibiotic, antifungal and antiviral properties protect the plant from pathogens.

It is currently classified as [[Endangered species|Endangered]] by the [[IUCN]]; and a second species, ''[[Giant aye-aye|Daubentonia robusta]]'', appears to have become [[extinct]] at some point within the last 1000 years.{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|pp=533\u2013534}}\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe genus ''Daubentonia'' was named after the French naturalist [[Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton]] by his student, [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], in 1795. Initially, Geoffroy considered using the Greek name ''Scolecophagus'' (\"worm-eater\") in reference to its eating habits, but he decided against it because he was uncertain about the aye-aye's habits and whether other related species might eventually be discovered.{{R|2012Dunkel_et_al}}  In 1863, British zoologist [[John Edward Gray]] coined the family name Daubentoniidae.{{Sfn|Groves|2005}}\n\nThe French naturalist [[Pierre Sonnerat]] was the first to use the vernacular name \"'''aye-aye'''\" in 1782 when he described and illustrated the lemur, though it was also called the \"'''long-fingered lemur'''\" by English zoologist [[George Shaw]] in 1800\u2014a name that did not stick.  According to Sonnerat, the name \"aye-aye\" was a \"''cri d'exclamation & d'\u00e9tonnement''\" (cry of exclamation and astonishment).  However, American paleoanthropologist [[Ian Tattersall]] noted in 1982 that the name resembles the [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] name \"hai hai\" or \"hay hay\", which refers to the animal and is used around the island. According to Dunkel ''et al.'' (2012), the widespread use of the Malagasy name indicates that the name could not have come from Sonnerat. Another hypothesis proposed by Simons and Meyers (2001) is that it derives from \"''heh heh''\", which is Malagasy for \"I don't know\". If correct, then the name might have originated from Malagasy people saying \"''heh heh''\" to [[avoidance speech|avoid saying the name]] of a feared, magical animal.{{R|2012Dunkel_et_al}}\n\n== Evolutionary history and taxonomy ==\nDue to its [[Cladistics|derived]] [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] features, the classification of the aye-aye was debated following its discovery.  The possession of continually growing [[incisor]]s (front teeth) parallels those of [[rodent]]s, leading early naturalists to mistakenly classify the aye-aye within the mammalian order [[Rodent]]ia{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|p=257}} and as a squirrel, due to its toes, hair coloring, and tail.

However, as the aye-ayes begin to reach maturity, their bodies will be completely covered in thick fur and are typically not one solid color. On the head and back, the ends of the hair are typically tipped with white while the rest of the body will ordinarily be a yellow and/or brown color.\n\nAmong the aye-aye's signature traits are its fingers.<ref name=\"Perry2012\" /> The third finger, which is thinner than the others, is used for tapping, while the fourth finger, the longest, is used for pulling bugs out of trees, using the hooked nail.<ref name=Science/> The middle finger is unique in that it possesses a ball-and-socket metacarpophalangeal joint.<ref>{{Cite journal |title = Anatomy of the hand and arm in Daubentonia madagascariensis: a functional and phylogenetic outlook|last = Soligo|first = C.|date = 2005|journal = Folia Primatol|volume = 76|issue = 5|pages = 262\u2013300|doi = 10.1159/000088034|pmid = 16230860|access-date = |url=https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/88034}}</ref> The aye-aye has also evolved a sixth digit, a [[pseudothumb]], to aid in gripping.<ref name= \"Hartstone\u2010Rose2019\">{{cite journal|last1= Hartstone\u2010Rose|first1= A.|last2= Dickinson|first2= E.|last3= Boettcher|first3=M.

These ridges can be regarded as the acoustic equivalent of a [[Fresnel lens]], and may be seen in a large variety of unrelated animals, such as [[lesser galago]], [[bat-eared fox]], [[mouse lemur]], and others.\n\nFemales have two nipples located in the region of the groin.\n\n== Behaviour and lifestyle ==\n[[File:Ayeaye, Daubentonia madagascariensis, Joseph Wolf.jpg|thumb|220px|An aye-aye foraging, c.1863, [[Joseph Wolf]].]]\n[[File:Aye-Aye Daubentonia madagascariensis in Copenhagen (Left Hand).jpg|thumb|220px|right|Closeup of the hand showing the elongated digits and the thinner third digit.]]\nThe aye-aye is a nocturnal and arboreal animal meaning that it spends most of its life high in the trees. Although they are known to come down to the ground on occasion, aye-ayes sleep, eat, travel and mate in the trees and are most commonly found close to the canopy where there is plenty of cover from the dense foliage. During the day, aye-ayes sleep in spherical nests in the forks of tree branches that are constructed out of leaves, branches and vines before emerging after dark to begin their hunt for food. Aye-aye are solitary animals that mark their large home range with scent.  The smaller territories of females often overlap those of at least a couple of males. Male aye-ayes tend to share their territories with other males and are even known to share the same nests (although not at the same time), and can seemingly tolerate each other until they hear the call of a female that is looking for a mate.\n\n=== Diet and foraging ===\nThe aye-aye is an [[omnivore]] and commonly eats seeds, fruits, nectar and fungi, but also insect larvae and honey.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=606}}\nAye-ayes tap on the trunks and branches of trees at a rate of up to eight times per second, and listen to the echo produced to find hollow chambers. Studies have suggested that the acoustic properties associated with the foraging cavity have no effect on excavation behavior.<ref name=\":0\" /> Once a chamber is found, they chew a hole into the wood and get grubs out of that hole with their highly adapted narrow and bony middle fingers.<ref name=Haring>{{cite journal|last=Haring|first=David|title=Eep!

Up to 80% of the night is spent foraging in the canopy, separated by occasional rest periods. It climbs trees by making successive vertical leaps, much like a squirrel. Horizontal movement is more difficult, but the aye-aye rarely descends to jump to another tree, and can often travel up to {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} a night.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Dodo: Journal of Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust Volume 30|last=|first=|publisher=Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust|year=1994|isbn=0-9515581-7-X|location=Jersey, Channel Islands|pages=43}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Gnawed limb, Daubentonia madagascariensis.jpg|thumb|245px|right|Gnawed limb by an Aye-Aye to prey on larvae]]\nThough foraging is usually solitary, they occasionally forage in groups.

It usually sticks to foraging in its own personal home range, or territory. The home ranges of males often overlap, and the males can be very social with each other. Female home ranges never overlap, though a male's home range often overlaps that of several females. The male aye-ayes live in large areas up to {{convert|80|acre|m2}}, while females have smaller living spaces that goes up to {{convert|20|acre|m2}}. It is difficult for the males to defend a singular female because of the large home range. They are seen exhibiting polygyny because of this.<ref>{{Cite journal |title = Patterns of Range Use and Social Organization in Aye-ayes (Daubentonia madagascariensis) on Nosy Mangabe|last = Sterling|first = Eleanor|date = 1993|journal = Lemur Social Systems and Their Ecological Basis|pages = 1\u201310|doi = 10.1007/978-1-4899-2412-4_1|pmid = |editor-last = Kappeler|location = Plenum Press, New York|isbn = 978-1-4899-2414-8}}</ref> Regular scent marking with their cheeks and neck is how aye-ayes let others know of their presence and repel intruders from their territory.{{r|Durrell}}\n\nLike many other prosimians, the female aye-aye is dominant to the male. They are not typically monogamous, and will often challenge each other for mates. Male aye-ayes are very assertive in this way, and sometimes even pull other males away from a female during mating. Males are normally locked to females during mating in sessions that may last up to an hour. Outside of mating, males and females interact only occasionally, usually while foraging.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The aye-aye is thought to be the only primate which uses [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] to find its prey.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aye-Aye|url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/aye-aye/?source=A-to-Z|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=7 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n[[File:Aye-aye at night in the wild in Madagascar.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Aye-ayes are nocturnal.]]\nThe aye-aye lives primarily on the east coast of Madagascar. Its natural habitat is [[rainforest]] or [[deciduous]] forest, but many live in cultivated areas due to deforestation. Rainforest aye-ayes, the most common, dwell in canopy areas, and are usually sighted above 70 meters altitude. They sleep during the day in nests built in the forks of trees.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n== Conservation ==\nThe aye-aye was thought to be extinct in 1933, but was rediscovered in 1957. Nine individuals were transported to [[Nosy Mangabe]], an island near [[Maroantsetra]] off eastern Madagascar, in 1966.{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=605\u2013606}} Recent research shows the aye-aye is more widespread than was previously thought, but its conservation status was changed to [[Endangered species|Endangered]] in 2014.<ref name=IUCN/><ref name=CITES>{{cite web | url = http://checklist.cites.org/#/en/search/scientific_name=Daubentonia | title = Checklist of CITES Species | website = CITES | publisher = UNEP-WCMC | accessdate = 18 March 2015}}</ref> This is for three main reasons: the aye-aye is considered evil, the forests of Madagascar are being destroyed, and the farmers will kill aye-ayes to protect their crops and for poaching.

Others believe, if one points its narrowest finger at someone, they are marked for death. Some say that the appearance of an aye-aye in a village predicts the death of a villager, and the only way to prevent this is to kill it. The [[Sakalava]] people go so far as to claim aye-ayes sneak into houses through the thatched roofs and murder the sleeping occupants by using their middle finger to puncture the victim's [[aorta]].{{r|2007Piper}}\n\n=== Captive breeding ===\n[[File:Aye Aye.JPG|270px|thumb|upright|At the [[Duke Lemur Center]] in Durham, North Carolina]]\nThe conservation of this species has been aided by captive breeding, primarily at the [[Duke Lemur Center]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]]. This center has been influential in keeping, researching and breeding aye-ayes and other lemurs. They have sent multiple teams to capture lemurs in Madagascar and have since created captive breeding groups for their lemurs. Specifically, they were responsible for the first aye-aye born into captivity and studied how he and the other aye-aye infants born at the center develop through infancy.

It is currently classified as [[Endangered species|Endangered]] by the [[IUCN]]; and a second species, ''[[Giant aye-aye|Daubentonia robusta]]'', appears to have become [[extinct]] at some point within the last 1000 years.{{Sfn|Nowak|1999|pp=533\u2013534}}\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe genus ''Daubentonia'' was named after the French naturalist [[Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton]] by his student, [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], in 1795. Initially, Geoffroy considered using the Greek name ''Scolecophagus'' (\"worm-eater\") in reference to its eating habits, but he decided against it because he was uncertain about the aye-aye's habits and whether other related species might eventually be discovered.{{R|2012Dunkel_et_al}}  In 1863, British zoologist [[John Edward Gray]] coined the family name Daubentoniidae.{{Sfn|Groves|2005}}\n\nThe French naturalist [[Pierre Sonnerat]] was the first to use the vernacular name \"'''aye-aye'''\" in 1782 when he described and illustrated the lemur, though it was also called the \"'''long-fingered lemur'''\" by English zoologist [[George Shaw]] in 1800\u2014a name that did not stick.  According to Sonnerat, the name \"aye-aye\" was a \"''cri d'exclamation & d'\u00e9tonnement''\" (cry of exclamation and astonishment).  However, American paleoanthropologist [[Ian Tattersall]] noted in 1982 that the name resembles the [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] name \"hai hai\" or \"hay hay\", which refers to the animal and is used around the island. According to Dunkel ''et al.'' (2012), the widespread use of the Malagasy name indicates that the name could not have come from Sonnerat. Another hypothesis proposed by Simons and Meyers (2001) is that it derives from \"''heh heh''\", which is Malagasy for \"I don't know\". If correct, then the name might have originated from Malagasy people saying \"''heh heh''\" to [[avoidance speech|avoid saying the name]] of a feared, magical animal.{{R|2012Dunkel_et_al}}\n\n== Evolutionary history and taxonomy ==\nDue to its [[Cladistics|derived]] [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] features, the classification of the aye-aye was debated following its discovery.  The possession of continually growing [[incisor]]s (front teeth) parallels those of [[rodent]]s, leading early naturalists to mistakenly classify the aye-aye within the mammalian order [[Rodent]]ia{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|p=257}} and as a squirrel, due to its toes, hair coloring, and tail. However, the aye-aye is also similar to felines in its head shape, eyes, ears and nostrils.<ref name=Science>{{cite journal|title=The Aye-Ayes or Cheiromys of Madagascar|journal=Science|date=3 November 1881|volume=2|issue=75|pages=574\u2013576|doi=10.1126/science.os-2.76.574 |pmid=17791380}}</ref>\n\nThe aye-aye's classification with the order Primates has been just as uncertain.  It has been considered a highly derived member of the family [[Indridae]], a [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] branch of the [[strepsirrhine]] suborder, and of indeterminate relation to all living primates.{{Sfn|Yoder|Vilgalys|Ruvolo|1996|pp=??}}  In 1931, Anthony and Coupin classified the aye-aye under infraorder '''Chiromyiformes''', a sister group to the other strepsirrhines. [[Colin Groves]] upheld this classification in 2005 because he was not entirely convinced the aye-aye formed a [[clade]] with the rest of the Malagasy lemurs.{{Sfn|Groves|2005|p=121}}\n\nHowever, molecular results have consistently placed ''Daubentonia'' as the most [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] of [[lemurs]].<ref name=\"Del Pero1995\">{{cite journal|last1= Del Pero|first1= M.|last2= Crovella|first2= S.|last3= Cervella|first3= P.|last4= Ardito|first4= G.|last5= Rumpler|first5= Y.|title= Phylogenetic relationships among Malagasy lemurs as revealed by mitochondrial DNA sequence analysis |journal= Primates|volume= 36|issue= 3|year= 1995|pages= 431\u2013440|doi= 10.1007/BF02382865}}</ref><ref name=\"Porter1995\">{{cite journal|last1= Porter|first1= C.A.|last2= Sampaio|first2= I.|last3= Schneider|first3= H.|last4= Schneider|first4= M.P.C.|last5= Czelusniak|first5= J.|last6= Goodman|first6= M.|title= Evidence on primate phylogeny from \u03b5-globin gene sequences and flanking regions|journal= Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume= 40|issue= 1|year= 1995|pages= 30\u201355|doi= 10.1007/BF00166594}}</ref><ref name=\"Yoder1996\">{{cite journal|last1= Yoder|first1= A.D.|last2= Vilgalys|first2= R.|last3= Ruvolo|first3= M.|title= Molecular evolutionary dynamics of cytochrome b in strepsirrhine primates: the phylogenetic significance of third-position transversions |journal= Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume= 13|issue= 10|year= 1996|pages= 1339\u20131350|doi= 10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025580}}</ref><ref name=\"Roos2004\">{{cite journal|last1= Roos|first1= C.|last2= Schmitz|first2= J.|last3= Zischler|first3= H.|title= Primate jumping genes elucidate strepsirrhine phylogeny |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume= 101|issue= 29|year= 2004|pages= 10650\u201310654|doi= 10.1073/pnas.0403852101|pmid= 15249661|pmc= 489989|bibcode= 2004PNAS..10110650R}}</ref><ref name=\"Horvath2008\">{{Cite journal |last1= Horvath |first1= J.E. |last2= Weisrock |first2= D.W. |last3= Embry |first3= S.L. |last4= Fiorentino |first4= I. |last5= Balhoff |first5= J.P. |last6= Kappeler |first6= P. |last7= Wray |first7= G.A. |last8= Willard |first8= H.F. |last9= Yoder |first9= A.D. |doi= 10.1101/gr.7265208 |title= Development and application of a phylogenomic toolkit: Resolving the evolutionary history of Madagascar's lemurs |journal= Genome Research |volume= 18 |issue= 3 |pages= 489\u2013499 |year= 2008 |pmid= 18245770|pmc= 2259113}}</ref><ref name=\"Orlando2008\">{{Cite journal |last1= Orlando |first1= L. |last2= Calvignac |first2= S. |last3= Schnebelen |first3= C. |last4= Douady |first4= C.J. |last5= Godfrey |first5= L.R. |last6= H\u00e4nni |first6= C. |doi= 10.1186/1471-2148-8-121 |title= DNA from extinct giant lemurs links archaeolemurids to extant indriids |journal= BMC Evolutionary Biology |volume= 8 |issue= 121 |pages= 121 |year= 2008 |pmid= 18442367|pmc= 2386821}}</ref><ref name=\"Brosius2011\">{{cite journal|last1= Brosius|first1= J.|last2= Perelman|first2= P.|last3= Johnson|first3= W.E.|last4= Roos|first4= C.|last5= Seu\u00e1nez|first5= H.N.|last6= Horvath|first6= J.E.|last7=Moreira|first7= M.A.M.|last8= Kessing|first8= B.|last9= Pontius|first9= J.|last10= Roelke|first10= M.|last11= Rumpler|first11= Y.|last12= Schneider|first12= M.P.C.|last13= Silva|first13= A.|last14= O'Brien|first14= S.J.|last15= Pecon-Slattery|first15= J.|title=A Molecular Phylogeny of Living Primates |journal= PLoS Genetics|volume= 7|issue= 3|year= 2011|pages= e1001342|doi= 10.1371/journal.pgen.1001342}}</ref><ref name=\"Perry2012\">{{cite journal|last1= Perry|first1= G.H.|last2= Reeves|first2= D.|last3= Melsted|first3= P.|last4= Ratan|first4= A.|last5= Miller|first5= W.|last6= Michelini|first6= K.|last7= Louis|first7= E.E.|last8= Pritchard|first8= J.K.|last9= Mason|first9= C.E.|last10= Gilad|first10= Y.|title=A Genome Sequence Resource for the Aye-Aye (''Daubentonia madagascariensis''), a Nocturnal Lemur from Madagascar |journal= Genome Biology and Evolution |volume= 4|issue= 2|year= 2012|pages= 126\u2013135|doi= 10.1093/gbe/evr132}}</ref>  The most parsimonious explanation for this is that all lemurs are derived from a single ancestor that [[Oceanic dispersal|rafted]] from Africa to Madagascar during the [[Paleogene]].<ref name=\"Roos2004\" /><ref name=Sellers>{{cite web | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090225011846/http://homepage.mac.com/wis/Personal/lectures/human-origins/PrimateEvolution.pdf | title = Primate Evolution | accessdate = 2008-10-23 | last = Sellers | first = Bill | date = 2000-10-20 | publisher = [[University of Edinburgh]] | pages = 13\u201317}}</ref><ref name = \"Ali&Huber\">{{Cite journal | last = Ali | first = J.

However, as the aye-ayes begin to reach maturity, their bodies will be completely covered in thick fur and are typically not one solid color. On the head and back, the ends of the hair are typically tipped with white while the rest of the body will ordinarily be a yellow and/or brown color.\n\nAmong the aye-aye's signature traits are its fingers.<ref name=\"Perry2012\" /> The third finger, which is thinner than the others, is used for tapping, while the fourth finger, the longest, is used for pulling bugs out of trees, using the hooked nail.<ref name=Science/> The middle finger is unique in that it possesses a ball-and-socket metacarpophalangeal joint.<ref>{{Cite journal |title = Anatomy of the hand and arm in Daubentonia madagascariensis: a functional and phylogenetic outlook|last = Soligo|first = C.|date = 2005|journal = Folia Primatol|volume = 76|issue = 5|pages = 262\u2013300|doi = 10.1159/000088034|pmid = 16230860|access-date = |url=https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/88034}}</ref> The aye-aye has also evolved a sixth digit, a [[pseudothumb]], to aid in gripping.<ref name= \"Hartstone\u2010Rose2019\">{{cite journal|last1= Hartstone\u2010Rose|first1= A.|last2= Dickinson|first2= E.|last3= Boettcher|first3=M.

These ridges can be regarded as the acoustic equivalent of a [[Fresnel lens]], and may be seen in a large variety of unrelated animals, such as [[lesser galago]], [[bat-eared fox]], [[mouse lemur]], and others.\n\nFemales have two nipples located in the region of the groin.\n\n== Behaviour and lifestyle ==\n[[File:Ayeaye, Daubentonia madagascariensis, Joseph Wolf.jpg|thumb|220px|An aye-aye foraging, c.1863, [[Joseph Wolf]].]]\n[[File:Aye-Aye Daubentonia madagascariensis in Copenhagen (Left Hand).jpg|thumb|220px|right|Closeup of the hand showing the elongated digits and the thinner third digit.]]\nThe aye-aye is a nocturnal and arboreal animal meaning that it spends most of its life high in the trees. Although they are known to come down to the ground on occasion, aye-ayes sleep, eat, travel and mate in the trees and are most commonly found close to the canopy where there is plenty of cover from the dense foliage. During the day, aye-ayes sleep in spherical nests in the forks of tree branches that are constructed out of leaves, branches and vines before emerging after dark to begin their hunt for food. Aye-aye are solitary animals that mark their large home range with scent.  The smaller territories of females often overlap those of at least a couple of males. Male aye-ayes tend to share their territories with other males and are even known to share the same nests (although not at the same time), and can seemingly tolerate each other until they hear the call of a female that is looking for a mate.\n\n=== Diet and foraging ===\nThe aye-aye is an [[omnivore]] and commonly eats seeds, fruits, nectar and fungi, but also insect larvae and honey.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=606}}\nAye-ayes tap on the trunks and branches of trees at a rate of up to eight times per second, and listen to the echo produced to find hollow chambers. Studies have suggested that the acoustic properties associated with the foraging cavity have no effect on excavation behavior.<ref name=\":0\" /> Once a chamber is found, they chew a hole into the wood and get grubs out of that hole with their highly adapted narrow and bony middle fingers.<ref name=Haring>{{cite journal|last=Haring|first=David|title=Eep!

Up to 80% of the night is spent foraging in the canopy, separated by occasional rest periods. It climbs trees by making successive vertical leaps, much like a squirrel.

It usually sticks to foraging in its own personal home range, or territory. The home ranges of males often overlap, and the males can be very social with each other. Female home ranges never overlap, though a male's home range often overlaps that of several females. The male aye-ayes live in large areas up to {{convert|80|acre|m2}}, while females have smaller living spaces that goes up to {{convert|20|acre|m2}}. It is difficult for the males to defend a singular female because of the large home range. They are seen exhibiting polygyny because of this.<ref>{{Cite journal |title = Patterns of Range Use and Social Organization in Aye-ayes (Daubentonia madagascariensis) on Nosy Mangabe|last = Sterling|first = Eleanor|date = 1993|journal = Lemur Social Systems and Their Ecological Basis|pages = 1\u201310|doi = 10.1007/978-1-4899-2412-4_1|pmid = |editor-last = Kappeler|location = Plenum Press, New York|isbn = 978-1-4899-2414-8}}</ref> Regular scent marking with their cheeks and neck is how aye-ayes let others know of their presence and repel intruders from their territory.{{r|Durrell}}\n\nLike many other prosimians, the female aye-aye is dominant to the male. They are not typically monogamous, and will often challenge each other for mates. Male aye-ayes are very assertive in this way, and sometimes even pull other males away from a female during mating. Males are normally locked to females during mating in sessions that may last up to an hour. Outside of mating, males and females interact only occasionally, usually while foraging.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The aye-aye is thought to be the only primate which uses [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] to find its prey.<ref>{{cite web|title=Aye-Aye|url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/aye-aye/?source=A-to-Z|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=7 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n[[File:Aye-aye at night in the wild in Madagascar.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Aye-ayes are nocturnal.]]\nThe aye-aye lives primarily on the east coast of Madagascar. Its natural habitat is [[rainforest]] or [[deciduous]] forest, but many live in cultivated areas due to deforestation. Rainforest aye-ayes, the most common, dwell in canopy areas, and are usually sighted above 70 meters altitude. They sleep during the day in nests built in the forks of trees.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n== Conservation ==\nThe aye-aye was thought to be extinct in 1933, but was rediscovered in 1957. Nine individuals were transported to [[Nosy Mangabe]], an island near [[Maroantsetra]] off eastern Madagascar, in 1966.{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=605\u2013606}} Recent research shows the aye-aye is more widespread than was previously thought, but its conservation status was changed to [[Endangered species|Endangered]] in 2014.<ref name=IUCN/><ref name=CITES>{{cite web | url = http://checklist.cites.org/#/en/search/scientific_name=Daubentonia | title = Checklist of CITES Species | website = CITES | publisher = UNEP-WCMC | accessdate = 18 March 2015}}</ref> This is for three main reasons: the aye-aye is considered evil, the forests of Madagascar are being destroyed, and the farmers will kill aye-ayes to protect their crops and for poaching.

When spotted, they are killed on sight and hung up so that the evil spirit will be carried away by travelers.]]\n\nThe aye-aye is often viewed as a harbinger of evil and killed on sight. Others believe, if one points its narrowest finger at someone, they are marked for death. Some say that the appearance of an aye-aye in a village predicts the death of a villager, and the only way to prevent this is to kill it. The [[Sakalava]] people go so far as to claim aye-ayes sneak into houses through the thatched roofs and murder the sleeping occupants by using their middle finger to puncture the victim's [[aorta]].{{r|2007Piper}}\n\n=== Captive breeding ===\n[[File:Aye Aye.JPG|270px|thumb|upright|At the [[Duke Lemur Center]] in Durham, North Carolina]]\nThe conservation of this species has been aided by captive breeding, primarily at the [[Duke Lemur Center]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]]. This center has been influential in keeping, researching and breeding aye-ayes and other lemurs. They have sent multiple teams to capture lemurs in Madagascar and have since created captive breeding groups for their lemurs. Specifically, they were responsible for the first aye-aye born into captivity and studied how he and the other aye-aye infants born at the center develop through infancy. They have also revolutionized the understanding of the aye-aye diet.<ref name=Haring/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=IUCN>{{cite iucn | page = e.T6302A16114609 | title = ''Daubentonia madagascariensis'' | author = Andriaholinirina, N. | display-authors = etal | year = 2014 | access-date = 11 April 2020|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"2012Dunkel_et_al\">{{cite journal | last1 = Dunkel | first1 = A.R. | last2 = Zijlstra | first2 = J.S. | last3 = Groves | first3 = C.P. | title = Giant rabbits, marmosets, and British comedies: etymology of lemur names, part 1 | url = http://www.aeecl.org/lemurnews/lemurnews2011_16.pdf | journal = Lemur News | volume = 16 | year = 2011\u20132012 | issn = 1608-1439 | pages = 64\u201370}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"2007Piper\">{{cite book | last = Piper | year = 2007 | title = Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals | publisher = Greenwood Press | first = Ross|url=https://archive.org/details/extraordinaryani0000pipe| url-access = registration | quote = aye-aye. | isbn = 9780313339226 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Durrell\">{{cite web | url = http://www.durrell.org/Animals/Mammals/Ayeaye/ | title = Aye-Aye | work = [[Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust]] | date = 2006-10-26 | accessdate = 2011-12-21}}</ref>\n\n<!--<ref name=\"2010Knowles\">[http://www.aolnews.com/science/article/superstitious-villagers-are-killing-off-harmless-primate-called-aye-aye/19416515?icid=main|main|dl1|link3|http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aolnews.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fsuperstitious-villagers-are-killing-off-harmless-primate-called-aye-aye%2F19416515 Harmless Creature Killed Because of Superstition], {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528043039/http://www.aolnews.com/science/article/superstitious-villagers-are-killing-off-harmless-primate-called-aye-aye/19416515?icid=main%7Cmain%7Cdl1%7Clink3%7Chttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.aolnews.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fsuperstitious-villagers-are-killing-off-harmless-primate-called-aye-aye%2F19416515 |date=2010-05-28 }} David Knowles, March 27, 2010</ref>-->\n\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Daubentonia madagascariensis}}\n{{Wikispecies|Daubentonia madagascariensis}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n\n*[http://members.tripod.com/uakari/ayeaye.html Primate Behavior: Aye-Aye]\n*ARKive \u2013 [https://web.archive.org/web/20060422080202/http://www.arkive.org/species/GES/mammals/Daubentonia_madagascariensis/ images and movies of the aye-aye ''(Daubentonia madagascariensis)'']\n*[http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/aye-aye Primate Info Net ''Daubentonia madagascariensis'' Factsheet]\n*[http://ecos.fws.gov/species_profile/servlet/gov.doi.species_profile.servlets.SpeciesProfile?spcode=A00P U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Species Profile]\n\n{{Primates}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q186778}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Mammals described in 1788]]\n[[Category:EDGE species]]\n[[Category:Lemurs]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Madagascar]]\n\n== Literature cited ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n\n* <!-- {{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007}} -->{{cite book | last1 = Ankel-Simons | first1 = F. | title= Primate Anatomy | edition = 3rd | publisher = Academic Press | year = 2007 |isbn= 978-0-12-372576-9 | ref = harv}}\n* <!-- {{Sfn|Beck|2009}} -->{{Cite journal | last1 = Beck | first1 = R.
