He has made state visits to Bhutan and Nepal and Japan within the first 100 days of his government followed by visits of Myanmar and Australia and also hosted Asia leaders like Australian Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]], Chinese President [[Xi Jinping]] and Vietnamese Prime Minister [[Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ea5n D\u0169ng]] apart from inviting [[SAARC]] leaders in his inauguration ceremony. External Affairs Minister Swaraj has also made official visits to several Asian capitals like [[Dhaka]], Bangladesh, [[Kathmandu]], Nepal, [[Naypidaw]], Myanmar, [[Singapore]], [[Hanoi]], Vietnam, [[Manama]], Bahrain, [[Kabul]], Afghanistan, [[Dushanbe]], Tajikistan, [[Male]], Maldives, [[Abu Dhabi]], United Arab Emirates [[Seoul]], South Korea and [[Beijing]], China.\n\n===South China Sea disputes===\nThough India's exclusive economic zone does not extend into the [[South China Sea]], the region is geopolitically important to India as a high volume of its trade passes through the South China Sea. Modi intends India to act as a stabilizing force in the Indo-Pacific Region as a part of Modi's underlying [[Look East policy (India)|Act East]] foreign policy initiative .<ref>{{citation|title=Trump Is Driving Xi into Modi's Arms|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/27/trump-is-driving-xi-into-modis-arms/|publisher=[[Foreign Policy]]|date=27 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==South Asia policy==\n{{Further|South Asian foreign policy of the Narendra Modi government}}\nEven before becoming the Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] hinted that his foreign policy will actively focus on improving ties with India's immediate neighbors which is being termed as \"neighborhood first\" policy in the media<ref name=\"articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com\"/><ref name=\"India, Modi and the neighbourhood\"/><ref name=\"The New York Times\"/> and he started well by inviting all heads of state/heads of government of South Asian countries in his inauguration and on the second day on office he held bilateral talks with all of them individually which was dubbed as a [[List of SAARC summits|mini SAARC summit]] by the media.<ref name=\"The mini SAARC summit\"/> Later during a launch event at [[ISRO]] he has asked Indian scientists to take the endeavor to develop a dedicated ''SAARC satellite''<ref name=\"claws.in\"/> to share the fruits of the technology like tele-medicine, e-learning etc. with the people across South Asia to complement the currently operating [[Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme]] program in the region.\n\n==West Asia policy==\n{{Further|Middle Eastern foreign policy of the Narendra Modi government}}\nIndian External Affairs Ministry refers to the region of 'Middle East' as West Asia and not as Middle East which is a more popular attribution, particularly in the western countries. The region plays a vital role in India's economy as it supplies nearly two third of India's total oil import, bilateral trade is also flourishing in recent years particularly with UAE and other Gulf states. Over the years millions of Indians mostly working class have migrated to the gulf looking for jobs and they account for a sizeable share in the total remittances received from abroad.\n\n===Link West policy===\nIn an attempt to strengthen ties with India's western neighbors specially the [[Persian gulf|gulf countries]], Modi proposed this policy to complement his [[Act East policy]] concerning East Asia. Although it is called 'Link West' (West of India) which gives it a bigger geographical connotation, it is most likely to focus on the [[Middle East|middle-east]] and some of India's strategic thinkers are calling it as Modi's middle-east policy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/modi-and-the-middle-east-towards-a-link-west-policy/|title=Modi and the Middle East: Towards a Link West Policy|author=C Raja Mohan|newspaper=[[The Indian Express]]|date=5 October 2014|accessdate=14 February 2015}}</ref> The West Asia Approach of India<ref>[http://www.dnd.com.pk/the-west-asia-approach-of-india-and-its-relations-with-middle-east/103010]</ref> is working successfully and its relations with Middle East are improving since Modi came in power.

Indian foreign policy makers say that India's interests in the [[Gulf Cooperation Council|GCC countries]] are intimately linked with its energy security, trade, employment for Indians and remittances while Middle Eastern foreign policy experts believe that India has showcased itself as \"Security Partner\" during Modi's visit to UAE.

The most notable examples of [[Renaissance architecture]] in the city are the house of the Baryczko merchant family (1562), a building called \"The Negro\" (early 17th century), and Salwator tenement (1632). The most interesting examples of [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] architecture are the [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle]] (1596\u20131619) and the [[Jesuit Church, Warsaw|Jesuit Church]] (1609\u20131626) at Old Town. Among the first structures of the early Baroque, the most important are [[St. Hyacinth's Church, Warsaw|St. Hyacinth's Church]] (1603\u20131639) and [[Sigismund's Column]] (1644).\n\n[[File:Hotel Bristol, Warszawa.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Hotel Bristol, Warsaw|Hotel Bristol]] is a unique example of Warsaw's architectural heritage, combining [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Neo-Renaissance]] designs.]]\n\nBuilding activity occurred in numerous noble palaces and churches during the later decades of the 17th century.

The neoclassical architecture in Warsaw can be described by the simplicity of the geometrical forms teamed with a great inspiration from the Roman period. Some of the best examples of the neoclassical style are the [[\u0141azienki Palace|Palace on the Water]] (rebuilt 1775\u20131795), [[Kr\u00f3likarnia]] (1782\u20131786), [[Carmelite Church, Warsaw|Carmelite Church]] (fa\u00e7ade 1761\u20131783) and Evangelical [[Holy Trinity Church, Warsaw|Holy Trinity Church]] (1777\u20131782). The economic growth during the first years of [[Congress Poland]] caused a rapid rise of architecture. The Neoclassical revival affected all aspects of architecture; the most notable examples are the [[Great Theatre, Warsaw|Great Theater]] (1825\u20131833) and buildings located at [[Plac Bankowy, Warsaw|Bank Square]] (1825\u20131828).\n\n[[File:6 Warszawa 149.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Warsaw University of Technology]] building courtyard]]\n\nExceptional examples of the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] architecture of the later periods were not restored by the [[communism|communist]] authorities after the war (like the previously mentioned Kronenberg Palace and insurance company Rosja building) or they were rebuilt in socialist realism style (like [[Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra|Warsaw Philharmony]] edifice originally inspired by [[Palais Garnier]] in Paris).

There are over 100 different species of trees and the avenues are a place to sit and relax. At the east end of the park, the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] is situated. In the 19th century the Krasi\u0144ski Palace Garden was remodelled by Franciszek Szanior. Within the central area of the park one can still find old trees dating from that period: [[Ginkgo biloba|maidenhair tree]], [[Juglans nigra|black walnut]], [[Corylus colurna|Turkish hazel]] and [[Pterocarya fraxinifolia|Caucasian wingnut]] trees. With its benches, flower carpets, a pond with ducks on and a playground for kids, the Krasi\u0144ski Palace Garden is a popular strolling destination for the Varsovians. The Monument of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising is also situated here. \u0141azienki Park covers an area of 76 ha. The unique character and history of the park is reflected in its [[landscape architecture]] (pavilions, sculptures, bridges, water cascades, ponds) and vegetation (domestic and foreign species of trees and bushes). What makes this park different from other green spaces in Warsaw is the presence of peacocks and pheasants, which can be seen here walking around freely, and royal carp in the pond. Wilan\u00f3w Palace Park dates back to the second half of the 17th century. It covers an area of 43 ha. Its central [[Garden \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise|French-styled area]] corresponds to the ancient, Baroque forms of the palace. The eastern section of the park, closest to the Palace, is the two-level garden with a terrace facing the pond.

The first remedial measure was the Warsaw area enlargement (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 but the city authorities were still forced to introduce residency registration limitations: only the spouses and children of the permanent residents as well as some persons of public importance (like renowned specialists) were allowed to get the registration, hence halving the population growth in the following years. It also bolstered a stereotype popular among the dwellers of other cities claiming that average Varsovians thought of themselves as better only because they lived in the capital.

All state agencies are located there, including the [[Parliament of Poland|Polish Parliament]], the [[President of Poland|Presidential Office]] and the [[Supreme Court of Poland|Supreme Court]]. In the Polish parliament the city and the area are represented by 31 [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] (out of 460). Additionally, Warsaw elects two [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] (Members of the European Parliament).\n\n[[Sejm|The Sejm]] is the lower house of the Polish parliament. The Sejm is made up of 460 deputies, or Pose\u0142 in Polish (literally 'Envoy'). It is elected by universal ballot and is presided over by a speaker called the [[Marshal of the Sejm]] (Marsza\u0142ek Sejmu).\n\n===Municipal government===\n<!-- DO NOT ADD MORE PICTURES TO THIS SECTION -->\n\nThe municipal government existed in Warsaw until World War II and was restored in 1990 (during the communist times, the National City Council&nbsp;\u2013 ''Miejska Rada Narodowa''&nbsp;\u2013 governed in Warsaw). Since 1990, the system of city administration has been changed several times&nbsp;\u2013 also as the result of the reform which restored ''[[powiat]]''s, cancelled in 1975. Finally, according to the ''Warsaw Act'', the city is divided into 18 districts and forms one ''city powiat'' with a unified municipal government.<ref name=\"admin\">{{cite web |url=http://e-warsaw.pl/2/index.php?id=568 |title=Administration |work=e-warsaw.pl |accessdate=31 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218181549/http://e-warsaw.pl/2/index.php?id=568 |archive-date=18 December 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pa\u0142ac Komisji Rz\u0105dowej Przychod\u00f3w i Skarbu w Warszawie 2018.jpg|thumb|left|[[Neoclassical architecture in Poland|Neoclassical]] Commission Palace, the house of the city's government]]\n\nThe basic unit of territorial division in Poland is a commune (''[[gmina]]'').<ref name=\"altrock\">{{cite book |author=Uwe Altrock|title=Spatial planning and urban development in the new EU member states: from adjustment to reinvention|year=2006 |page=262 |pages=|chapter=|chapterurl=|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|location=|isbn=0-7546-4684-X |url=|accessdate=}}</ref> A city is also a commune&nbsp;\u2013 but with a city charter.<ref name=\"altrock\"/> Both cities and communes are governed by a mayor&nbsp;\u2013 but in the communes the mayor is [[vogt]] (''w\u00f3jt'' in Polish), however in the cities&nbsp;\u2013 ''burmistrz''. Some bigger cities obtain the entitlements, i.e. tasks and privileges, which are possessed by the units of the second level of the territorial division&nbsp;\u2013 counties (''powiaty'' in Polish). An example of such entitlement is a car registration: a ''gmina'' cannot register cars, this is a ''powiat's'' task (i.e. a registration number depends on what ''powiat'' a car had been registered in, not the ''gmina''). In this case we say \"city county\" or ''powiat grodzki''. Such cities are for example [[Lublin]], [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Gda\u0144sk]], and [[Pozna\u0144]]. In Warsaw, its districts additionally have some of a ''powiat''{{'s}} entitlements&nbsp;\u2013 like the already mentioned car registration. For example, the Wola district has its own evidence and the Ursyn\u00f3w district&nbsp;\u2013 its own (and the cars from Wola have another type of registration number than those from Ursyn\u00f3w). But for instance the districts in Krak\u00f3w do not have the entitlements of a ''powiat'', so the registration numbers in Krak\u00f3w are of the same type for all districts.\n\n[[File:Dutch Embassy in Warsaw 2016.jpg|thumb|Embassy of the Netherlands]]\n\n[[Legislature|Legislative power]] in Warsaw is vested in a [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[Warsaw City Council]] (''Rada Miasta''), which comprises 60 members.<ref name=\"admin\"/> Council members are elected directly every five years (since [[2018_Polish_local_elections|2018 election]]).

If the mayor vetoes a bill, the Council has 30 days to override the veto by a two-thirds majority vote.\n\nEach of the 18 separate city districts has its own council (''Rada dzielnicy'').<ref name=\"admin\"/> Their duties are focused on aiding the President and the City Council, as well as supervising various municipal companies, city-owned property and schools. The head of each of the District Councils is named the Mayor (''Burmistrz'') and is elected by the local council from the candidates proposed by the President of Warsaw.\n\nThe mayor of Warsaw is called President. Generally, in Poland, the mayors of bigger cities are called ''presidents''&nbsp;\u2013 i.e. cities with over 100,000 people or that had a president before 1990. The first Warsaw President was Jan Andrzej Menich (1695\u20131696).<ref name=Petrozolin/> Between 1975 and 1990 the Warsaw presidents simultaneously led the [[Warsaw Voivodeship (1975-1998)|Warsaw Voivode]].

In 1995 the factory was purchased by the South Korean car manufacturer [[Daewoo]], which assembled the Tico, Espero, Nubia, Tacuma, Leganza, Lanos and Matiz there for the European market.

The Vistula River is the specific axis of Warsaw, which divides the city into two parts, left and right. The left one is situated both on the [[moraine]] plateau ({{convert|10|to|25|m|1|abbr=on}} above Vistula level) and on the Vistula terraces (max. {{convert|6.5|m|1|abbr=on}} above Vistula level).

It is {{convert|20|to|25|m|1|abbr=on}} high in the Old Town and Central district and about {{convert|10|m|1|abbr=on}} in the north and south of Warsaw. It goes through the city and plays an important role as a landmark.\n\nThe plain moraine plateau has only a few natural and artificial ponds and also groups of [[clay pit]]s. The pattern of the Vistula terraces is asymmetrical. The left side consists mainly of two levels: the highest one contains former flooded terraces and the lowest one the flood plain terrace. The contemporary flooded terrace still has visible valleys and ground [[depression (geology)|depressions]] with water systems coming from the old Vistula&nbsp;\u2013 riverbed. They consist of still quite natural streams and lakes as well as the pattern of drainage ditches. The right side of Warsaw has a different pattern of geomorphological forms. There are several levels of the Vistula plain terraces (flooded as well as formerly flooded), and only a small part is a not so visible moraine escarpment. [[Aeolian processes|Aeolian]] sand with a number of dunes parted by [[peat]] swamps or small ponds cover the highest terrace.

The neoclassical architecture in Warsaw can be described by the simplicity of the geometrical forms teamed with a great inspiration from the Roman period.

The economic growth during the first years of [[Congress Poland]] caused a rapid rise of architecture. The Neoclassical revival affected all aspects of architecture; the most notable examples are the [[Great Theatre, Warsaw|Great Theater]] (1825\u20131833) and buildings located at [[Plac Bankowy, Warsaw|Bank Square]] (1825\u20131828).\n\n[[File:6 Warszawa 149.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Warsaw University of Technology]] building courtyard]]\n\nExceptional examples of the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] architecture of the later periods were not restored by the [[communism|communist]] authorities after the war (like the previously mentioned Kronenberg Palace and insurance company Rosja building) or they were rebuilt in socialist realism style (like [[Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra|Warsaw Philharmony]] edifice originally inspired by [[Palais Garnier]] in Paris).

There are over 100 different species of trees and the avenues are a place to sit and relax. At the east end of the park, the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] is situated. In the 19th century the Krasi\u0144ski Palace Garden was remodelled by Franciszek Szanior. Within the central area of the park one can still find old trees dating from that period: [[Ginkgo biloba|maidenhair tree]], [[Juglans nigra|black walnut]], [[Corylus colurna|Turkish hazel]] and [[Pterocarya fraxinifolia|Caucasian wingnut]] trees. With its benches, flower carpets, a pond with ducks on and a playground for kids, the Krasi\u0144ski Palace Garden is a popular strolling destination for the Varsovians. The Monument of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising is also situated here. \u0141azienki Park covers an area of 76 ha. The unique character and history of the park is reflected in its [[landscape architecture]] (pavilions, sculptures, bridges, water cascades, ponds) and vegetation (domestic and foreign species of trees and bushes). What makes this park different from other green spaces in Warsaw is the presence of peacocks and pheasants, which can be seen here walking around freely, and royal carp in the pond. Wilan\u00f3w Palace Park dates back to the second half of the 17th century. It covers an area of 43 ha. Its central [[Garden \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise|French-styled area]] corresponds to the ancient, Baroque forms of the palace. The eastern section of the park, closest to the Palace, is the two-level garden with a terrace facing the pond. The park around the Kr\u00f3likarnia Palace is situated on the old escarpment of the Vistula. The park has lanes running on a few levels deep into the ravines on both sides of the palace.\n\n[[File:Reservoir Warsaw.jpg|thumb|[[Saxon Garden]] with the Temple of Vesta]]\n\nOther green spaces in the city include the [[Botanical garden|Botanic Garden]] and the University Library garden.

The first remedial measure was the Warsaw area enlargement (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 but the city authorities were still forced to introduce residency registration limitations: only the spouses and children of the permanent residents as well as some persons of public importance (like renowned specialists) were allowed to get the registration, hence halving the population growth in the following years. It also bolstered a stereotype popular among the dwellers of other cities claiming that average Varsovians thought of themselves as better only because they lived in the capital.

All state agencies are located there, including the [[Parliament of Poland|Polish Parliament]], the [[President of Poland|Presidential Office]] and the [[Supreme Court of Poland|Supreme Court]]. In the Polish parliament the city and the area are represented by 31 [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] (out of 460). Additionally, Warsaw elects two [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] (Members of the European Parliament).\n\n[[Sejm|The Sejm]] is the lower house of the Polish parliament. The Sejm is made up of 460 deputies, or Pose\u0142 in Polish (literally 'Envoy'). It is elected by universal ballot and is presided over by a speaker called the [[Marshal of the Sejm]] (Marsza\u0142ek Sejmu).\n\n===Municipal government===\n<!-- DO NOT ADD MORE PICTURES TO THIS SECTION -->\n\nThe municipal government existed in Warsaw until World War II and was restored in 1990 (during the communist times, the National City Council&nbsp;\u2013 ''Miejska Rada Narodowa''&nbsp;\u2013 governed in Warsaw). Since 1990, the system of city administration has been changed several times&nbsp;\u2013 also as the result of the reform which restored ''[[powiat]]''s, cancelled in 1975.

Some bigger cities obtain the entitlements, i.e. tasks and privileges, which are possessed by the units of the second level of the territorial division&nbsp;\u2013 counties (''powiaty'' in Polish). An example of such entitlement is a car registration: a ''gmina'' cannot register cars, this is a ''powiat's'' task (i.e. a registration number depends on what ''powiat'' a car had been registered in, not the ''gmina''). In this case we say \"city county\" or ''powiat grodzki''. Such cities are for example [[Lublin]], [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Gda\u0144sk]], and [[Pozna\u0144]]. In Warsaw, its districts additionally have some of a ''powiat''{{'s}} entitlements&nbsp;\u2013 like the already mentioned car registration. For example, the Wola district has its own evidence and the Ursyn\u00f3w district&nbsp;\u2013 its own (and the cars from Wola have another type of registration number than those from Ursyn\u00f3w). But for instance the districts in Krak\u00f3w do not have the entitlements of a ''powiat'', so the registration numbers in Krak\u00f3w are of the same type for all districts.\n\n[[File:Dutch Embassy in Warsaw 2016.jpg|thumb|Embassy of the Netherlands]]\n\n[[Legislature|Legislative power]] in Warsaw is vested in a [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[Warsaw City Council]] (''Rada Miasta''), which comprises 60 members.<ref name=\"admin\"/> Council members are elected directly every five years (since [[2018_Polish_local_elections|2018 election]]).
