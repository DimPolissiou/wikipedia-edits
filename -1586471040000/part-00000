Adding [[nitrogen fertilizer]] to the soil increases the concentration of [[alkaloid]]s present in the plant. Datura can be grown from seed, which is sown with several feet between plants.

To harvest, the entire plant is cut down, the leaves are stripped from the plant, and everything is left to dry. When the fruits begin to burst open, the seeds are harvested.

Kushner is the elder son of the former real-estate developer [[Charles Kushner]], the son of Jewish immigrants from the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], and is married to [[Ivanka Trump]], President Trump's daughter and fellow advisor. As a result of his father's conviction and incarceration for fraud, he took over management of his father's real estate company [[Kushner Companies]], which launched his business career. He later also bought [[Observer Media]], publisher of the ''[[New York Observer]]''. He is the co-founder and part owner of [[Cadre (company)|Cadre]], an online real-estate investment platform.\n\nDuring the [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|2016 Trump presidential campaign]], Kushner helped develop and run Trump's [[digital media]] strategy. On January 9, 2017, he was named as a senior White House advisor, raising concerns about [[nepotism]]. He also stirred controversy for his conflicts of interest, as he continued to engage in business, even profiting on policy proposals that he himself pushed for within the administration.

Kushner is the elder son of the former real-estate developer [[Charles Kushner]], the son of Jewish immigrants from the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], and is married to [[Ivanka Trump]], President Trump's daughter and fellow advisor. As a result of his father's conviction and incarceration for fraud, he took over management of his father's real estate company [[Kushner Companies]], which launched his business career. He later also bought [[Observer Media]], publisher of the ''[[New York Observer]]''. He is the co-founder and part owner of [[Cadre (company)|Cadre]], an online real-estate investment platform.\n\nDuring the [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|2016 Trump presidential campaign]], Kushner helped develop and run Trump's [[digital media]] strategy. On January 9, 2017, he was named as a senior White House advisor, raising concerns about [[nepotism]]. He also stirred controversy for his conflicts of interest, as he continued to engage in business, even profiting on policy proposals that he himself pushed for within the administration. Kushner was unable to obtain Top Secret Security clearance until May 2018, when Trump reportedly intervened on his son-in-law's behalf.\n\nAs senior White House advisor, Kushner pushed strongly for the [[FIRST STEP Act]], a criminal justice reform bill which Trump signed into law in 2018. Kushner authored a peace plan in the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], which was announced in January 2020, but which was seen as overwhelmingly favoring Israel.

They have released five studio albums and two live albums on Frontline and subsequently on MCM Music, distributed through [[Massacre Records]].

By the time of its first tour in 1993, the band was Eric Clayton \u2013 vocals, Jeff Clayton \u2013 guitars, Dean Forsyth \u2013 bass, Jayson Heart \u2013 drums, and Nathan Van Hala \u2013 keyboards. The band took its name from a song on the [[David Bowie]] album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]''. Saviour Machine recorded and released their first demos in 1990. A theatrical stage show featuring [[pyrotechnics]], images projected onto a background screen and other [[theatrical properties|props]] attracted a growing fan base in [[Southern California]].  \n{{Listen\n|filename=Saviour Machine - Legion.ogg\n|title=\"Legion\"\n|description=Sample of \"Legion\" by Saviour Machine, from ''[[Saviour Machine I]]'' (1993).  Containing lyrics with apocalyptic themes, this song eventually led to the album being banned from Christian bookstores in the United States.}}\n\nIn 1993, with the help of Deliverance frontman Jimmy P. Brown II, Saviour Machine signed with and released their first full-length album on Intense Records, an imprint of the Frontline subsidiary of [[Roadrunner Records]]. Musically, the band developed a guitar-driven rock music sound, featuring melodic [[riff]]s and extensive solos by Jeff Clayton.\n\nDespite critical acclaim from the mainstream press<ref>{{cite web |author=Espiau, Olivier |title=Saviour Machine - Saviour Machine II |publisher=Open Publishing |year=2004 |work=Metal Storm |url= http://www.metalstorm.ee/pub/review.php?review_id=292&print_page=yes |accessdate=September 9, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Espiau, Olivier |title= Saviour Machine - Saviour Machine I |publisher=Open Publishing |date=February 4, 2004 |work=Metal Storm |url= http://www.metalstorm.ee/bands/album.php?album_id=1033&band_id=149&bandname=Saviour+Machine |accessdate=September 9, 2007 }}</ref> and a growing number of fans nationwide, people in some conservative circles reportedly felt threatened by Saviour Machine's lyrical direction and stage presentation, most prominently the white make-up and jewel worn by vocalist Eric Clayton. During their 1993 tour with [[Heavy metal music|metal]] band [[Deliverance (metal band)|Deliverance]], the controversy spilled over at a concert at the New Union, a club in [[Minneapolis]]. Several songs into their set, the power was cut and the performers were ushered from the stage. This was followed by an announcement from New Union management stating they were uncomfortable with the content of the show. However, many in the crowd gathered with the band shortly after at a local [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]] restaurant to show their continued support.{{ref|1}}\n\n===Studio transition (1994\u20131996)===\nConfusion and political upheaval at Intense/Frontline led to less-than-ideal conditions for the recording of the band's next album in 1994, ''Saviour Machine II''. Musically, the addition of [[pianist]] Nathan Van Hala resulted in a [[european classical music|classical music]]-based sound.  Many songs featured [[piano]] compositions and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] [[orchestration]]. Charles Cooper also joined the band at this time after Dean Forsyth left.\n\nWith the release of ''Saviour Machine II'' the band began to pursue new representation. A growing following had developed in [[Europe]], particularly in [[Germany]]. This led to the formation of MCM Music, an independent label for all Saviour Machine projects, by vocalist Eric Clayton and his European management team. The band also secured a deal with [[Massacre Records]], a German label that specializes in death metal and other heavy/extreme music. Saviour Machine was given full creative control on all future projects.\n\nMultiple tours of [[Europe]] followed in 1995 and 1996. During a 1995 performance at Owen Teck Rocknight, a [[music festival]] in Owen, [[Germany]], Saviour Machine recorded their first live album. ''Live in Deutschland'', released in 1995, featured selections from ''Saviour Machine I'' and ''Saviour Machine II''. It was after this tour that the membership of Saviour Machine changed with the replacement of Jeff Clayton by Joshua. They performed at [[Wacken Open Air]] festival in 1997.\n\n===The ''Legend'' trilogy (1997\u20132007)===\nSaviour Machine next turned to the ''Legend'' trilogy. ''Legend'' was advertised as \"the unofficial soundtrack to the end of the world\" in promotional materials<ref name=\"HM_97_65\"/> owing to its study of [[end times|end-time]] [[Bible prophecy|Biblical prophecy]]. The ''Legend'' trilogy comprises four full-length CDs totaling more than five hours of music. ''Legend I'' and ''Legend II'' were released in 1997 and 1998, respectively. The studio composition of the band stayed the same through \"Legend II\" after which Jeff Clayton and Jayson Heart left the band. ''[[Legend III:I]]'' was released in 2001. The long-awaited final disc, ''Legend III:II'', was scheduled to be released July 7, 2007. ''Legend'' parts ''I'' through ''III:I'' were released by MCM Music and Massacre Records; however, ''Legend III:II'' was released independently.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sound7.de/article.php?channel=3&article=4154 |title=Eric Clayton im Interview |accessdate=December 4, 2007 |author=Brunner, David |date=August 11, 2006 |work=Sound7.de |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223232552/http://www.sound7.de/article.php?channel=3&article=4154 |archivedate=December 23, 2007 }}</ref> On May 27, 2007, Eric Clayton released a statement on the Saviour Machine MySpace blog saying that, due to health problems, he would not be able to finish ''Legend III:II'' in time to make the July 7 release date.

A second live album was released in 2002, again featuring a performance from Owen Teck Rocknight in Owen, Germany. ''Live in Deutschland 2002'' featured selections from ''Legend I'', ''Legend II'' and ''Legend III:I''.\n\n===Inactive years (2008\u20132016)===\nEric Clayton has repeatedly stated that Saviour Machine's work will end upon the completion of the ''Legend'' trilogy. In a video message created on September 3, 2009, Eric stated that despite his frail health he is doing quite well and plans to release segments from a journal he has been keeping since 1997. He said that the excerpts will likely serve as his final interview.<ref>[http://www.saviourmachine.com Saviour Machine Home Page - A Message From Eric Clayton]</ref>\n\nDespite these statements, Saviour Machine's homepage went offline in 2013.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} Saviour Machine's Facebook page, which had received regular updates through 2012, also went inactive during 2013, and subsequently was taken down in 2014.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} Eric Clayton officially retired Saviour Machine as a band and the whole unfinished Legend project in the same year.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n=== Re-union and plan for new release (2017\u2013present) ===\n\nAccording to an interview with Eric Clayton during [[Wacken Open Air]] 2017 as well as statements on the Facebook page and Youtube channel of the band, they are working on a new album to be released in the future.

Musically, the band developed a guitar-driven rock music sound, featuring melodic [[riff]]s and extensive solos by Jeff Clayton.\n\nDespite critical acclaim from the mainstream press<ref>{{cite web |author=Espiau, Olivier |title=Saviour Machine - Saviour Machine II |publisher=Open Publishing |year=2004 |work=Metal Storm |url= http://www.metalstorm.ee/pub/review.php?review_id=292&print_page=yes |accessdate=September 9, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Espiau, Olivier |title= Saviour Machine - Saviour Machine I |publisher=Open Publishing |date=February 4, 2004 |work=Metal Storm |url= http://www.metalstorm.ee/bands/album.php?album_id=1033&band_id=149&bandname=Saviour+Machine |accessdate=September 9, 2007 }}</ref> and a growing number of fans nationwide, people in some conservative circles reportedly felt threatened by Saviour Machine's lyrical direction and stage presentation, most prominently the white make-up and jewel worn by vocalist Eric Clayton. During their 1993 tour with [[Heavy metal music|metal]] band [[Deliverance (metal band)|Deliverance]], the controversy spilled over at a concert at the New Union, a club in [[Minneapolis]]. Several songs into their set, the power was cut and the performers were ushered from the stage. This was followed by an announcement from New Union management stating they were uncomfortable with the content of the show. However, many in the crowd gathered with the band shortly after at a local [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]] restaurant to show their continued support.{{ref|1}}\n\n===Studio transition (1994 - 1996)===\nConfusion and political upheaval at Intense/Frontline led to less-than-ideal conditions for the recording of the band's next album in 1994, ''Saviour Machine II''. Musically, the addition of [[pianist]] Nathan Van Hala resulted in a [[european classical music|classical music]]-based sound.  Many songs featured [[piano]] compositions and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] [[orchestration]]. Charles Cooper also joined the band at this time after Dean Forsyth left.\n\nWith the release of ''Saviour Machine II'' the band began to pursue new representation. A growing following had developed in [[Europe]], particularly in [[Germany]]. This led to the formation of MCM Music, an independent label for all Saviour Machine projects, by vocalist Eric Clayton and his European management team. The band also secured a deal with [[Massacre Records]], a German label that specializes in death metal and other heavy/extreme music. Saviour Machine was given full creative control on all future projects.\n\nMultiple tours of [[Europe]] followed in 1995 and 1996. During a 1995 performance at Owen Teck Rocknight, a [[music festival]] in Owen, [[Germany]], Saviour Machine recorded their first live album. ''Live in Deutschland'', released in 1995, featured selections from ''Saviour Machine I'' and ''Saviour Machine II''. It was after this tour that the membership of Saviour Machine changed with the replacement of Jeff Clayton by Joshua. They performed at [[Wacken Open Air]] festival in 1997.\n\n===The ''Legend'' trilogy (1997 - 2007)===\nSaviour Machine next turned to the ''Legend'' trilogy. ''Legend'' was advertised as \"the unofficial soundtrack to the end of the world\" in promotional materials<ref name=\"HM_97_65\"/> owing to its study of [[end times|end-time]] [[Bible prophecy|Biblical prophecy]]. The ''Legend'' trilogy comprises four full-length CDs totaling more than five hours of music. ''Legend I'' and ''Legend II'' were released in 1997 and 1998, respectively. The studio composition of the band stayed the same through \"Legend II\" after which Jeff Clayton and Jayson Heart left the band. ''[[Legend III:I]]'' was released in 2001. The long-awaited final disc, ''Legend III:II'', was scheduled to be released July 7, 2007. ''Legend'' parts ''I'' through ''III:I'' were released by MCM Music and Massacre Records; however, ''Legend III:II'' was released independently.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sound7.de/article.php?channel=3&article=4154 |title=Eric Clayton im Interview |accessdate=December 4, 2007 |author=Brunner, David |date=August 11, 2006 |work=Sound7.de |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223232552/http://www.sound7.de/article.php?channel=3&article=4154 |archivedate=December 23, 2007 }}</ref> On May 27, 2007, Eric Clayton released a statement on the Saviour Machine MySpace blog saying that, due to health problems, he would not be able to finish ''Legend III:II'' in time to make the July 7 release date.

A second live album was released in 2002, again featuring a performance from Owen Teck Rocknight in Owen, Germany. ''Live in Deutschland 2002'' featured selections from ''Legend I'', ''Legend II'' and ''Legend III:I''.\n\n===Inactive years (2008\u20132016)===\nEric Clayton has repeatedly stated that Saviour Machine's work will end upon the completion of the ''Legend'' trilogy. In a video message created on September 3, 2009, Eric stated that despite his frail health he is doing quite well and plans to release segments from a journal he has been keeping since 1997.
