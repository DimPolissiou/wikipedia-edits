Prussia never had a major navy, nor did the other German states before the [[German Empire]] was formed in 1871. Tirpitz took the modest Imperial Navy and, starting in the 1890s, turned it into a world-class force that could threaten Britain's [[Royal Navy]]. However, during [[World War I]], his [[High Seas Fleet]] proved unable to end Britain's [[Command of the sea|command of the sea]] and its chokehold on Germany's economy. The one great engagement at sea, the [[Battle of Jutland]], ended in a narrow German tactical victory but a strategic failure. As the High Seas Fleet's limitations became increasingly apparent during the war, Tirpitz became an outspoken advocate for [[unrestricted submarine warfare]], a policy which would ultimately bring Germany into conflict with the United States. By the beginning of 1916, he was dismissed from office and never regained power.\n\n==Family and early life==\nTirpitz was born in [[K\u00fcstrin]] (today Kostrzyn in [[Poland]]) in the [[Prussia]]n province of [[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], the son of lawyer and later judge Rudolf Tirpitz (1811\u20131905). His mother was the daughter of a doctor. Tirpitz grew up in [[Frankfurt (Oder)]]. He recorded in his memoirs that as a child he was a mediocre pupil.\n\nTirpitz spoke [[English language|English]] fluently and was sufficiently at home in [[UK|Great Britain]] that he sent his two daughters to [[Cheltenham Ladies' College]].\n\nOn 18 November 1884 he married Maria Augusta Lipke (born 11 October 1860 in Schwetz, West Prussia, died after 1941). \nOn 12 June 1900 he was elevated to the Prussian nobility, becoming [[von]] Tirpitz. His son, ''Oberleutnant zur See'' Wolfgang von Tirpitz, was taken [[prisoner of war]] following the sinking of {{SMS|Mainz}} in the [[Battle of Heligoland (1914)|Battle of Heligoland Bight]] on 28 August 1914.\n\n==Naval career==\nTirpitz joined the [[Prussian Navy]] more by accident than design when a friend announced that he was doing so. Tirpitz decided he liked the idea and with the consent of his parents became a naval cadet at the age of 16, on 24 April 1865. He attended [[Kiel]] Naval School. Within a year Prussia was at war with Austria. Tirpitz became a midshipman ([[Seekadett]]) on 24 June 1866 and was posted to a sailing ship patrolling the [[English Channel]]. In 1866 Prussia became part of the [[North German Confederation]], the navy officially became that of the confederation and Tirpitz joined the new institution on 24 June 1869.\n\nOn 22 September 1869 he had obtained the rank of ''[[Unterleutnant zur See]]'' (sub-lieutenant) and served on board {{SMS|K\u00f6nig Wilhelm}}. During the [[Franco-Prussian War]] the Prussian Navy was greatly outnumbered and so the ship spent the duration of the war at anchor, much to the embarrassment of the navy. During the early years of Tirpitz's career, Prussia and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] were on good terms and the Prussian Navy spent much time in British ports. Tirpitz reported that [[Plymouth]] was more hospitable to German sailors than was [[Kiel]], while it was also easier to obtain equipment and supplies there, which were of better quality than available at home. At this time the British [[Royal Navy]] was pleased to assist that of Prussia in its development and a considerable respect grew up in Prussian officers of their British counterparts.<ref>Massie p. 166</ref>\n\n===Development of torpedoes===\n[[Unification of Germany]] in 1871 again meant a change of name, to the [[German Imperial Navy]]. On 25 May 1872 Tirpitz was promoted to ''[[Leutnant zur See]]'' (lieutenant at sea) and on 18 November 1875 to ''[[Kapit\u00e4nleutnant]]'' (captain-lieutenant). In 1877 he was chosen to visit the [[Whitehead Torpedo]] development works at [[Fiume]] and afterwards was placed in charge of the German torpedo section, later renamed the torpedo inspectorate. By 1879 a working device had been produced, but even under demonstration conditions Tirpitz reckoned it was as likely to miss a target as to hit it. On 17 September 1881 he became ''[[Korvettenkapit\u00e4n]]'' (corvette captain). From developing torpedoes, Tirpitz moved on to developing torpedo boats to deliver them. The State Secretary for the Navy, [[Leo von Caprivi]], was a distant relation, and Tirpitz now worked with him on the development of tactics. Caprivi envisioned that the boats would be used defensively against their most likely enemy, France, but Tirpitz set about developing plans to attack the French home port of [[Cherbourg]]. Tirpitz later described his time with torpedo boats as 'the eleven best years of my life'.<ref>Massie p. 167</ref>\n\n===Strategic development of the Navy===\nIn 1887 the torpedo boats escorted [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Prince Wilhelm]] to attend the Golden Jubilee celebrations of his grandmother, [[Queen Victoria]]. This was the first time Tirpitz met Wilhelm. In July 1888 Caprivi was succeeded by [[Alexander von Monts]]. Torpedo boats were no longer considered important, and Tirpitz requested transfer, commanding the cruisers {{SMS|Preussen|1873|6}} and then {{SMS|W\u00fcrttemberg|1878|6}}. He was promoted to Captain ([[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]]) 24 November 1888 and in 1890 became chief of staff of the Baltic Squadron. On one occasion the Kaiser was attending dinner with the senior naval officers at Kiel and asked their opinion on how the navy should develop. Finally the question came to Tirpitz and he advised building battleships. This was an answer which appealed to the Kaiser, and nine months later he was transferred to [[Berlin]] to work on a new strategy for creating a high seas fleet. Tirpitz appointed a staff of officers he had known from his time with the torpedo boats and collected together all sorts of vessels as stand-in battleships to conduct exercises to test out tactics. On 1 December 1892 he made a presentation of his findings to the Kaiser. This brought him into conflict with the Navy State Secretary, Admiral [[Friedrich von Hollmann]]. Hollmann was responsible for procurement of ships, and had a policy of collecting ships as funding permitted. Tirpitz had concluded that the best fighting arrangement was a squadron of eight identical battleships, rather than any other combination of ships with mixed abilities. Further ships should then be added in groups of eight. Hollmann favoured a mixed fleet including cruisers for long distance operations overseas. Tirpitz believed that in a war no number of cruisers would be safe unless backed up by sufficient battleships.\n\n''[[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]]'' (captain at sea) Tirpitz became chief of the naval staff in 1892 and was made a ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' (rear admiral) in 1895.\n\nIn autumn 1895, frustrated by the non-adoption of his recommendations, Tirpitz asked to be replaced. The Kaiser, not wishing to lose him, asked instead that he prepare a set of recommendations for ship construction. This was delivered on 3 January 1896, but the timing was bad as it coincided with raids into the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] in [[Southern Africa]] by pro-British forces against the pro-German [[Boers]]. The Kaiser immediately set his mind to demanding cruisers which could operate at a distance and influence the war. Hollman was tasked with obtaining money from the ''[[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]'' for a building programme, but failed to gain funding for enough ships to satisfy anyone. [[Reichskanzler|Imperial Chancellor]] [[Prince Chlodwig von Hohenlohe-Schillingsf\u00fcrst|Hohenlohe]] saw no sense in naval enlargement and reported back that the Reichstag opposed it. Admiral [[Gustav von Senden-Bibran]], Chief of the Naval Cabinet, advised that the only possibility lay in replacing Hollmann: Wilhelm impulsively decided to appoint Tirpitz.<ref>Massie, pp. 169\u2013170</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, however, Hollmann had obtained funding for one battleship and three large cruisers. It was felt that replacing him before the bill had completed approval through the Reichstag would be a mistake. Instead, Tirpitz was placed in charge of the [[German East Asia Squadron]] in the [[Far East]] but with a promise of appointment as Secretary at a suitable moment. The cruiser squadron operated from British facilities in [[Hong Kong]] which were far from satisfactory as the German ships always took second place for available docks. Tirpitz was instructed to find a suitable site for a new port, selecting four possible sites. Although he initially favoured the bay at [[Jiaozhou Bay concession|Kiautschou/Tsingtao]], others in the naval establishment advocated a different location and even Tirpitz wavered on his commitment in his final report. A 'lease' on the land was acquired in 1898 after it was fortuitously occupied by German forces. On 12 March 1896 the Reichstag cut back Hollmann's appropriation of 70 million marks to 58 million, and Hollman offered his resignation. Tirpitz was summoned home and offered the post of Secretary of the Imperial Navy office ([[Reichsmarineamt]]). He went home the long way, touring the United States on the way and arriving in Berlin 6 June 1897. He was pessimistic of his chances of succeeding with the Reichstag.<ref>Massie p. 171</ref>\n\n===State Secretary of the Imperial Navy Office===\nOn 15 June Tirpitz presented a memorandum on the makeup and purpose of the German fleet to the Kaiser. This defined the principal enemy as Great Britain, and the principal area of conflict to be that between [[Heligoland]] and the [[River Thames|Thames]]. Cruiser warfare around the globe was deemed impractical because Germany had few bases to resupply ships, while the chief need was for as many battleships as possible to take on the British fleet. A target was outlined for two squadrons of eight battleships, plus a fleet flagship and two reserves. This was to be completed by 1905 and cost 408 million marks, or 58 million per year, the same as the existing budget. The proposal was innovative in several ways. It made a clear statement of naval needs, whereas before the navy had grown piecemeal. It set out the programme for seven years ahead, which neither the Reichstag nor the navy should change. It defined a change in German foreign policy so as to justify the existence of the fleet: Great Britain up to this point had been friendly, now it was officially an enemy. The Kaiser agreed the plan and Tirpitz retired to [[Sankt Blasien|St Blasien]] in the [[Black Forest]] with a team of naval specialists to draft a [[German Naval Laws|naval bill]] for presentation to the Reichstag. Information about the plan leaked out to [[Eduard von Knorr|Admiral Knorr]], head of the [[German Imperial Naval High Command|Naval High Command]]. Tirpitz agreed to a joint committee to discuss changes in the navy, but then arranged that it never receive any information. Similarly, he arranged a joint committee  with the Treasury State Secretary to discuss finance, which never discussed anything. Meanwhile, he continued his best efforts to convince the Kaiser and Chancellor, so that in due course he could announce the issues had already been decided at a higher level and thereby avoid debate.<ref>Massie pp. 172\u2013174</ref>\n\nOnce the bill was nearly complete Tirpitz started a round of visits to obtain support. First he visited the former Chancellor and elder statesman, [[Otto von Bismarck|Prince Bismarck]]. Armed with the announcement that the Kaiser intended to name the next ship launched ''Furst Bismarck'', he persuaded the former chancellor, who had been dismissed from office for disagreement with Wilhelm II, to modestly support the proposals. Tirpitz now visited  the [[King of Saxony]], the Prince Regent of Bavaria, the [[Grand Duke of Baden]] and Oldenburg and the councils of the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] towns. On 19 October the draft bill was sent to the printers for presentation to the ''Reichstag''. Tirpitz's approach was to be as accommodating with the deputies as he could. He was patient and good humoured, proceeding on the assumption that if everything was explained carefully, then the deputies would naturally be convinced. Groups were invited to private meetings to discuss the bill. Tours of ships and shipyards were arranged. The Kaiser and Chancellor stressed that the fleet was only intended for protection of Germany, but so that even a first class power might think twice before attacking. Highlights from a letter Prince Bismarck wrote were read out in the Reichstag, though not mentioning passages where he expressed reservations. Papers were circulated showing the relative size of foreign fleets, and how much Germany had fallen behind, particularly when considering the great power of her army compared to others.<ref>Massie pp. 174\u2013178</ref>\n\nA press bureau was created in the Navy Ministry to ensure journalists were thoroughly briefed, and to politely answer any and all objections. Pre-written articles were provided for the convenience of journalists. University professors were invited to speak on the importance of protecting German trade. The [[Navy League (Germany)|Navy League]] was formed to  popularise the idea of world naval power and its importance to the [[German Empire|Empire]]. It was argued that colonies overseas were essential, and Germany deserved her 'place in the sun'. League membership grew from 78,000 in 1898, to 600,000 in 1901 and 1.1 million by 1914. Especial attention was given to members of the budget committee who would consider the bill in detail. Their interests and connections were analysed to find ways to influence them. Steel magnate [[Friedrich Alfred Krupp|Fritz Krupp]] and shipowner [[Albert Ballin]] of the [[Hamburg-America Line]] were invited to speak on the benefits of the bill to trade and industry.<ref>Massie p. 178</ref>\n\nObjections were raised that the bill surrendered one of the most important powers of the Reichstag, that of annually scrutinising expenditure. Conservatives felt that expenditure on the navy was wasted, and that if money was available it should go to the army, which would be the deciding factor in any likely war. [[Eugen Richter]] of the Liberal Radical Union opposing the bill observed that if it was intended for Germany now seriously to take up the Trident to match its other forces then such a small force would not suffice and there would be no end to ship building. [[August Bebel]] of the Social Democrats argued that there existed a number of deputies who were Anglophobes and wished to pick a fight with Britain, but that to imagine such a fleet could take on the Royal Navy was insanity and anyone saying it belonged in the madhouse.<ref>Massie pp. 177\u2013179</ref>\n\nYet by the end of the debates the country was convinced that the bill would and should be passed. On 26 March 1898 it did so, by a majority of 212 to 139. All those around the Kaiser were ecstatic at their success. Tirpitz as navy minister was elevated to a seat on the Prussian Ministry of State. His influence and importance as the man who had accomplished this miracle was assured and he was to remain at the center of government for the next nineteen years.\n\n====Second Naval Bill====\nOne year after the passage of the bill Tirpitz appeared before the Reichstag and declared his satisfaction with it. The specified fleet would still be smaller than the French or British, but would be able to deter the Russians in the [[Baltic region|Baltic]]. Within another year all had changed. In October 1899 the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] broke out between the British and [[Boers]] in [[South Africa]]. In January 1900 a British cruiser intercepted three German mail steamers and searched them for war supplies intended for the Boers. Germany was outraged and the opportunity presented itself for a second Naval Bill. The second bill doubled the number of battleships from nineteen to thirty-eight. This would form four squadrons of eight ships, plus two flagships and four reserves. The bill now spanned seventeen years from 1901 to 1917 with the final ships being completed by 1920. This would constitute the second-largest fleet in the world and although no mention was made in the bill of specific enemies, it made several general mentions of a greater power which it was intended to oppose. There was only one navy which could be meant. On 5 December 1899 Tirpitz was promoted to ''[[Vizeadmiral]]'' (vice admiral). The bill passed on 20 June 1900.<ref>Massie pp. 180\u2013181</ref>\n\nSpecifically written into the preamble was an explanation of Tirpitz's Risk Theory. Although the German fleet would be smaller, it was likely that an enemy with a world spanning empire would not be able to concentrate all its forces in local waters. Even if it could, the German fleet would still be sufficiently powerful to inflict significant damage in any battle, sufficient damage that the enemy would be unable to maintain its other naval commitments and must suffer irreparable harm. Thus no such enemy would risk an engagement. Privately Tirpitz acknowledged that a second risk existed: that Britain, seeing its growing enemy might choose to strike first, might destroy the German fleet before it grew to a dangerous size. A similar course had been taken before, when [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]] sank [[Denmark|Danish]] ships [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|at Copenhagen]] to prevent them falling into French hands, and would be again in the [[Second World War]] when French ships were sunk [[Attack on Mers-el-Kebir|at Mers-el-K\u00e9bir]] to prevent them falling into German hands. A term, \"[[Copenhagenization (naval)|Copenhagenization]]\", even existed in English for this. Tirpitz calculated this danger period would end in 1904 or 1905. In the event, Britain responded to the increased German building programme by building more ships herself and the theoretical danger period extended itself to beyond the start of the Great War. As a reward for the successful bill Tirpitz was ennobled with the hereditary article ''von'' before his name in 1900.<ref>Massie pp. 181\u2013182</ref>\n\nTirpitz noted the difficulties in his relationship with the Kaiser. Wilhelm respected him as the only man who had succeeded in persuading the Reichstag to start and then increase a world class navy, but he remained unpredictable. He was fanatical about the navy, but would come up with wild ideas for improvements, which Tirpitz had to deflect to maintain his objectives. Each summer Tirpitz would go to St Blasien with his aides to work on naval plans, then in September he would travel to the Kaiser's retreat at [[Rominten Hunting Lodge|Rominten]], where Tirpitz found he would be more relaxed and willing to listen to a well argued explanation.<ref>Massie pp. 182\u2013183</ref>\n\nThree supplementary naval bills ('Novelles') were passed, in June 1906, April 1908 and June 1912. The first followed German diplomatic defeats over [[Morocco]], and added six large cruisers to the fleet. The second followed fears of British encroachment, and reduced the replacement time which a ship would remain in service from 25 to 20 years. The third was caused by the [[Agadir Crisis]] where again Germany had to draw back. This time three more battleships were added.<ref>Massie p. 183</ref>\n\nThe first naval law caused little alarm in Great Britain. There was already in force a dual power standard defining the size of the British fleet as at least that of the next two largest fleets combined. There was now a new player, but her fleet was similar in size to the other two possible threats, Russia and France, and a number of battleships were already under construction. The second naval law, however, caused serious alarm: eight [[King Edward VII-class battleship]]s were ordered in response. It was the regularity and efficiency with which Germany was now building ships, which were seen to be as good as any in the world, which raised concern. Information about the design of the new battleships suggested they were only intended to operate within a short range of a home base and not to stay at sea for extended periods. They seemed designed only for operations in the [[North Sea]]. The result was that Britain abandoned its policy of isolation which had held force since the time of Nelson and began to look for allies against the growing threat from Germany. Ships were withdrawn from around the world and brought back to British waters, while construction of new ships increased.<ref>Massie pp. 184\u2013185</ref>\n\n====Tirpitz Plan====\nTirpitz's design to achieve world power status through naval power, while at the same time addressing domestic issues, is referred to as the [[Tirpitz Plan]]. Politically, the Tirpitz Plan was marked by the [[Fleet Acts]] of 1898, 1900, 1908 and 1912. By 1914, they had given Germany the second-largest naval force in the world (roughly 40% smaller than the [[Royal Navy]]). It included seventeen modern [[Battleship|dreadnoughts]], five [[battlecruiser]]s, twenty-five [[cruiser]]s and twenty pre-dreadnought [[battleship]]s as well as over forty [[submarine]]s. Although including fairly unrealistic targets, the expansion programme was sufficient to alarm the British, starting a costly naval arms race and pushing the British into closer ties with the French.\n\nTirpitz developed a \"Risk Theory\" whereby, if the [[German Imperial Navy]] reached a certain level of strength relative to the British [[Royal Navy]], the British would try to avoid confrontation with Germany (that is, maintain a [[fleet in being]]). If the two navies fought, the German Navy would inflict enough damage on the British that the latter ran a risk of losing their naval dominance. Because the British relied on their navy to maintain control over the [[British Empire]], Tirpitz felt they would opt to maintain naval supremacy in order to safeguard their empire, and let Germany become a world power, rather than lose the empire at the cost of keeping Germany less powerful. This theory sparked a naval [[arms race]] between Germany and Great Britain in the first decade of the 20th century.\n\n[[Image:Alfred v.Tirpitz 1915.png|thumb|upright|left|Grand Admiral von Tirpitz in 1915]]\n\nThis theory was based on the assumption that Great Britain would have to send its fleet into the [[North Sea]] to blockade the German ports (blockading Germany was the only way the Royal Navy could seriously harm Germany), where the German Navy could force a battle. However, due to Germany's geographic location, Great Britain could blockade Germany by closing the entrance to the North Sea in the [[English Channel]] and the area between [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] and the [[Shetland Islands]]. Faced with this option a German Admiral commented, \"If the British do that, the role of our navy will be a sad one,\" correctly predicting the role the surface fleet would have during the [[First World War]].\n\nPolitically and strategically, Tirpitz's Risk Theory ensured its own failure. By its very nature it forced Britain into measures that would have been previously unacceptable to the British establishment. The necessity to concentrate the fleet against the German threat involved Britain making arrangements with other powers that enabled her to return the bulk of her naval forces to [[Home Fleet|Home Waters]]. The first evidence of this is seen in the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance|Anglo-Japanese treaty]] of 1902 that enabled the battleships of the China squadron to be re-allocated back to Europe. The Japanese fleet, largely constructed in British shipyards, then proceeded to utterly destroy the Russian navy in the [[Russo-Japanese War|war of 1904\u201305]], removing Russia as a credible maritime opponent. The necessity to reduce the Mediterranean Fleet in order to reinforce the navy in home waters was also a powerful influence in its d\u00e9tente and [[Entente Cordiale]] with the French. By forcing the British to come to terms with its most traditional opponent, Tirpitz scuttled his own policy. Britain was no longer at 'risk' from France, and the Japanese destruction of the Russian fleet removed that nation as a naval threat. In the space of a few years, Germany was faced with virtually the whole strength of the Royal Navy deployed against its own fleet, and Britain committed to her list of potential enemies. The Tirpitz 'risk theory' made it more probable that, in any future conflict between the European powers, Britain would be on the side of Germany's foes, and that the full force of the most powerful navy in the world would be concentrated against her fleet.\n\nTirpitz had been made a ''[[Gro\u00dfadmiral]]'' (grand admiral) in 1911, without patent (the document that accompanied formal promotions personally signed at this level by the Kaiser himself). At that time, the [[German Imperial Navy]] had only four ranks for admirals: rear admiral, (''Konteradmiral'', equal to a ''Generalmajor'' in the army, with no pips on the shoulders); vice admiral (''Vizeadmiral'', equal to a ''Generalleutnant'', with one pip); admiral (equal to a ''General der Infanterie'', with two pips), and grand admiral (equal to a field marshal). Tirpitz's shoulder boards had four pips, and he never received a grand admiral's baton or the associated insignia. \n\n====World War I====\n\nDespite the building programme he oversaw, he believed that the war had come too soon for a successful surface challenge to the Royal Navy, as the Fleet Act of 1900 had included a seventeen-year timetable. Unable to direct naval operations from his purely administrative position, Tirpitz became a vocal spokesman for unrestricted [[U-boat]] warfare, which he felt could break the British stranglehold on Germany's sea lines of communication. While the German Navy briefly abandoned the observance of prize rules in 1915, this policy was soon reversed following the outcry over [[Sinking of the RMS Lusitania|the Lusitania's sinking]]. When the restrictions on the submarine war were not lifted, he fell out with the Kaiser and felt compelled to resign on 15 March 1916. He was replaced as Secretary of State of the Imperial Naval Office by [[Eduard von Capelle]]. \n\nDespite his support for unrestricted U-boat warfare, Tirpitz placed a low priority on submarine construction during his leadership of the Imperial Naval Office. Ultimately, this decision would result in a severe shortage of newly built U-boats by 1917.\n\n==Fatherland Party==\nIn 1917, Grand Admiral Tirpitz was co-founder of the [[Pan-Germanism|Pan-Germanic]] and nationalist [[Fatherland Party (Germany)|Fatherland Party]] (''Deutsche Vaterlandspartei'').<ref>Patrick J. Kelly, ''Tirpitz and the Imperial German Navy'' (2011) pp. 410\u2013421</ref> The party was organised jointly by [[Heinrich Cla\u00df]], [[Konrad Freiherr von Wangenheim]], Tirpitz as chairman and [[Wolfgang Kapp]] as his deputy. The party attracted the opponents of a negotiated peace and organised opposition to the parliamentary majority which was seeking peace negotiations. It sought to bring together outside parliament all parties on the political right, which had not previously been done. At its peak, in the summer of 1918, it had around 1,250,000 members. It proposed both ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and [[General (Germany)|General]] [[Erich Ludendorff]] as 'people's emperors' of a [[military state]] whose legitimacy was based upon war and war aims instead of on the parliamentary government of the ''Reich''. Internally, there were calls for a ''[[coup d'etat]]'' against the German government, to be led by Hindenburg and Ludendorff, even against the Emperor if necessary. Tirpitz's experience with the Navy League and mass political agitation convinced him that the means for a coup was at hand.<ref>Raffael Scheck, ''Alfred von Tirpitz and German right-wing politics, 1914\u20131930'' (1998), chapter 5</ref>\n\nTirpitz considered that one of the main aims of the war must be annexation of new territory in the west, to allow Germany to develop into a world power. This meant holding the [[Belgium|Belgian]] ports of [[Zeebrugge]] and [[Ostend]], with an eye to the main enemy, the United Kingdom. He proposed a separate peace treaty with Russia, giving them access to the ocean. Germany would be a great [[Continental Europe|continental]] state but could maintain its world position only by expanding world trade and continuing the fight against the UK. He complained of indecision and ambiguity in German policy, humanitarian ideas of self-preservation, a policy of appeasement of neutrals at the expense of vital German interests, and begging for peace. He called for vigorous warfare without regard for diplomatic and commercial consequences and supported the most extreme use of weapons, especially unrestricted submarine warfare.\n\nFrom 1908 to 1918, Tirpitz was a member of the [[Prussian House of Lords]]. After Germany's defeat, he supported the right-wing [[German National People's Party]] (''Deutschnationale Volkspartei'', or ''DNVP'') and sat for it in the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]'' from 1924 until 1928.\n\nTirpitz died in Ebenhausen, near [[Munich]], on 6 March 1930. He is buried in the [[Munich Waldfriedhof|Waldfriedhof]] in Munich.\n\n==Honours==\n*Honorary Doctorates from the Universities of [[G\u00f6ttingen]] (16 June 1913) and [[Greifswald]]\n*Honorary doctorate of engineering from the [[Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg]]\n*Freeman of the city of [[Frankfurt (Oder)]] (15 January 1917)\n*The German battleship [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']] was named after him in 1939.\n\n;Foreign honours\n*{{flagicon|Russian Empire}} [[Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky]] \u2013 ''August 1902'' \u2013 during the visit of the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|German Emperor]] to the Russian fleet maneuvers in Reval.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Latest intelligence - the Imperial meeting at Reval |day_of_week=Saturday |date=9 August 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36842| }}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n*{{cite book |title=My Memoirs |location= London/ New York |year=1919}} Republished in a single volume by NSNB with an introduction by Erik Empson in 2013 [https://www.amazon.com/Memoirs-Volumes-Illustrated-First-Classics-ebook/dp/B00DH2E9LE/ ASIN B00DH2E9LE].\n*{{cite book |title=The structure of German World Power |location= Stuttgart/ Berlin  |year=1924}}\n*{{cite book |title=German policy |location= Hamburg/Berlin |year=1926}}\n*{{cite book |title=Memories, 5 volumes | location= Berlin/Leipzig |year=1927}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anglo-German naval arms race]]\n* [[German interest in the Caribbean]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{commons}}\n===Works===\n* Tirpitz, Alfred von, ''Erinnerungen'' (Leipzig: K.F.Koehler, 1919).\n\n===Secondary source===\n* Berghahn, V.R.

Prussia never had a major navy, nor did the other German states before the [[German Empire]] was formed in 1871. Tirpitz took the modest Imperial Navy and, starting in the 1890s, turned it into a world-class force that could threaten Britain's [[Royal Navy]]. However, during [[World War I]], his [[High Seas Fleet]] proved unable to end Britain's [[Command of the sea|command of the sea]] and its chokehold on Germany's economy. The one great engagement at sea, the [[Battle of Jutland]], ended in a narrow German tactical victory but a strategic failure. As the High Seas Fleet's limitations became increasingly apparent during the war, Tirpitz became an outspoken advocate for [[unrestricted submarine warfare]], a policy which would ultimately bring Germany into conflict with the United States. By the beginning of 1916, he was dismissed from office and never regained power.\n\n==Family and early life==\nTirpitz was born in [[K\u00fcstrin]] (today Kostrzyn in [[Poland]]) in the [[Prussia]]n province of [[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], the son of lawyer and later judge Rudolf Tirpitz (1811\u20131905). His mother was the daughter of a doctor. Tirpitz grew up in [[Frankfurt (Oder)]]. He recorded in his memoirs that he was a mediocre pupil as a child.\n\nTirpitz spoke [[English language|English]] fluently and was sufficiently at home in [[UK|Great Britain]] that he sent his two daughters to [[Cheltenham Ladies' College]].\n\nOn 18 November 1884 he married Maria Augusta Lipke (born 11 October 1860 in Schwetz, West Prussia, died after 1941). \nOn 12 June 1900 he was elevated to the Prussian nobility, becoming [[von]] Tirpitz. His son, ''Oberleutnant zur See'' Wolfgang von Tirpitz, was taken [[prisoner of war]] following the sinking of {{SMS|Mainz}} in the [[Battle of Heligoland (1914)|Battle of Heligoland Bight]] on 28 August 1914.\n\n==Naval career==\nTirpitz joined the [[Prussian Navy]] more by accident than design when a friend announced that he was doing so. Tirpitz decided he liked the idea and with the consent of his parents became a naval cadet at the age of 16, on 24 April 1865. He attended [[Kiel]] Naval School. Within a year Prussia was at war with Austria. Tirpitz became a midshipman ([[Seekadett]]) on 24 June 1866 and was posted to a sailing ship patrolling the [[English Channel]]. In 1866 Prussia became part of the [[North German Confederation]], the navy officially became that of the confederation and Tirpitz joined the new institution on 24 June 1869.\n\nOn 22 September 1869 he had obtained the rank of ''[[Unterleutnant zur See]]'' (sub-lieutenant) and served on board {{SMS|K\u00f6nig Wilhelm}}. During the [[Franco-Prussian War]] the Prussian Navy was greatly outnumbered and so the ship spent the duration of the war at anchor, much to the embarrassment of the navy. During the early years of Tirpitz's career, Prussia and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] were on good terms and the Prussian Navy spent much time in British ports. Tirpitz reported that [[Plymouth]] was more hospitable to German sailors than was [[Kiel]], while it was also easier to obtain equipment and supplies there, which were of better quality than available at home. At this time the British [[Royal Navy]] was pleased to assist that of Prussia in its development and a considerable respect grew up in Prussian officers of their British counterparts.<ref>Massie p. 166</ref>\n\n===Development of torpedoes===\n[[Unification of Germany]] in 1871 again meant a change of name, to the [[German Imperial Navy]]. On 25 May 1872 Tirpitz was promoted to ''[[Leutnant zur See]]'' (lieutenant at sea) and on 18 November 1875 to ''[[Kapit\u00e4nleutnant]]'' (captain-lieutenant). In 1877 he was chosen to visit the [[Whitehead Torpedo]] development works at [[Fiume]] and afterwards was placed in charge of the German torpedo section, later renamed the torpedo inspectorate. By 1879 a working device had been produced, but even under demonstration conditions Tirpitz reckoned it was as likely to miss a target as to hit it. On 17 September 1881 he became ''[[Korvettenkapit\u00e4n]]'' (corvette captain). From developing torpedoes, Tirpitz moved on to developing torpedo boats to deliver them. The State Secretary for the Navy, [[Leo von Caprivi]], was a distant relation, and Tirpitz now worked with him on the development of tactics. Caprivi envisioned that the boats would be used defensively against their most likely enemy, France, but Tirpitz set about developing plans to attack the French home port of [[Cherbourg]]. Tirpitz later described his time with torpedo boats as 'the eleven best years of my life'.<ref>Massie p. 167</ref>\n\n===Strategic development of the Navy===\nIn 1887 the torpedo boats escorted [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Prince Wilhelm]] to attend the Golden Jubilee celebrations of his grandmother, [[Queen Victoria]]. This was the first time Tirpitz met Wilhelm. In July 1888 Caprivi was succeeded by [[Alexander von Monts]]. Torpedo boats were no longer considered important, and Tirpitz requested transfer, commanding the cruisers {{SMS|Preussen|1873|6}} and then {{SMS|W\u00fcrttemberg|1878|6}}. He was promoted to Captain ([[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]]) 24 November 1888 and in 1890 became chief of staff of the Baltic Squadron. On one occasion the Kaiser was attending dinner with the senior naval officers at Kiel and asked their opinion on how the navy should develop. Finally the question came to Tirpitz and he advised building battleships. This was an answer which appealed to the Kaiser, and nine months later he was transferred to [[Berlin]] to work on a new strategy for creating a high seas fleet. Tirpitz appointed a staff of officers he had known from his time with the torpedo boats and collected together all sorts of vessels as stand-in battleships to conduct exercises to test out tactics. On 1 December 1892 he made a presentation of his findings to the Kaiser. This brought him into conflict with the Navy State Secretary, Admiral [[Friedrich von Hollmann]]. Hollmann was responsible for procurement of ships, and had a policy of collecting ships as funding permitted. Tirpitz had concluded that the best fighting arrangement was a squadron of eight identical battleships, rather than any other combination of ships with mixed abilities. Further ships should then be added in groups of eight. Hollmann favoured a mixed fleet including cruisers for long distance operations overseas. Tirpitz believed that in a war no number of cruisers would be safe unless backed up by sufficient battleships.\n\n''[[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]]'' (captain at sea) Tirpitz became chief of the naval staff in 1892 and was made a ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' (rear admiral) in 1895.\n\nIn autumn 1895, frustrated by the non-adoption of his recommendations, Tirpitz asked to be replaced. The Kaiser, not wishing to lose him, asked instead that he prepare a set of recommendations for ship construction. This was delivered on 3 January 1896, but the timing was bad as it coincided with raids into the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] in [[Southern Africa]] by pro-British forces against the pro-German [[Boers]]. The Kaiser immediately set his mind to demanding cruisers which could operate at a distance and influence the war. Hollman was tasked with obtaining money from the ''[[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]'' for a building programme, but failed to gain funding for enough ships to satisfy anyone. [[Reichskanzler|Imperial Chancellor]] [[Prince Chlodwig von Hohenlohe-Schillingsf\u00fcrst|Hohenlohe]] saw no sense in naval enlargement and reported back that the Reichstag opposed it. Admiral [[Gustav von Senden-Bibran]], Chief of the Naval Cabinet, advised that the only possibility lay in replacing Hollmann: Wilhelm impulsively decided to appoint Tirpitz.<ref>Massie, pp. 169\u2013170</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, however, Hollmann had obtained funding for one battleship and three large cruisers. It was felt that replacing him before the bill had completed approval through the Reichstag would be a mistake. Instead, Tirpitz was placed in charge of the [[German East Asia Squadron]] in the [[Far East]] but with a promise of appointment as Secretary at a suitable moment. The cruiser squadron operated from British facilities in [[Hong Kong]] which were far from satisfactory as the German ships always took second place for available docks. Tirpitz was instructed to find a suitable site for a new port, selecting four possible sites. Although he initially favoured the bay at [[Jiaozhou Bay concession|Kiautschou/Tsingtao]], others in the naval establishment advocated a different location and even Tirpitz wavered on his commitment in his final report. A 'lease' on the land was acquired in 1898 after it was fortuitously occupied by German forces. On 12 March 1896 the Reichstag cut back Hollmann's appropriation of 70 million marks to 58 million, and Hollman offered his resignation. Tirpitz was summoned home and offered the post of Secretary of the Imperial Navy office ([[Reichsmarineamt]]). He went home the long way, touring the United States on the way and arriving in Berlin 6 June 1897. He was pessimistic of his chances of succeeding with the Reichstag.<ref>Massie p. 171</ref>\n\n===State Secretary of the Imperial Navy Office===\nOn 15 June Tirpitz presented a memorandum on the makeup and purpose of the German fleet to the Kaiser. This defined the principal enemy as Great Britain, and the principal area of conflict to be that between [[Heligoland]] and the [[River Thames|Thames]]. Cruiser warfare around the globe was deemed impractical because Germany had few bases to resupply ships, while the chief need was for as many battleships as possible to take on the British fleet. A target was outlined for two squadrons of eight battleships, plus a fleet flagship and two reserves. This was to be completed by 1905 and cost 408 million marks, or 58 million per year, the same as the existing budget. The proposal was innovative in several ways. It made a clear statement of naval needs, whereas before the navy had grown piecemeal. It set out the programme for seven years ahead, which neither the Reichstag nor the navy should change. It defined a change in German foreign policy so as to justify the existence of the fleet: Great Britain up to this point had been friendly, now it was officially an enemy. The Kaiser agreed the plan and Tirpitz retired to [[Sankt Blasien|St Blasien]] in the [[Black Forest]] with a team of naval specialists to draft a [[German Naval Laws|naval bill]] for presentation to the Reichstag. Information about the plan leaked out to [[Eduard von Knorr|Admiral Knorr]], head of the [[German Imperial Naval High Command|Naval High Command]]. Tirpitz agreed to a joint committee to discuss changes in the navy, but then arranged that it never receive any information. Similarly, he arranged a joint committee  with the Treasury State Secretary to discuss finance, which never discussed anything. Meanwhile, he continued his best efforts to convince the Kaiser and Chancellor, so that in due course he could announce the issues had already been decided at a higher level and thereby avoid debate.<ref>Massie pp. 172\u2013174</ref>\n\nOnce the bill was nearly complete Tirpitz started a round of visits to obtain support. First he visited the former Chancellor and elder statesman, [[Otto von Bismarck|Prince Bismarck]]. Armed with the announcement that the Kaiser intended to name the next ship launched ''Furst Bismarck'', he persuaded the former chancellor, who had been dismissed from office for disagreement with Wilhelm II, to modestly support the proposals. Tirpitz now visited  the [[King of Saxony]], the Prince Regent of Bavaria, the [[Grand Duke of Baden]] and Oldenburg and the councils of the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] towns. On 19 October the draft bill was sent to the printers for presentation to the ''Reichstag''. Tirpitz's approach was to be as accommodating with the deputies as he could. He was patient and good humoured, proceeding on the assumption that if everything was explained carefully, then the deputies would naturally be convinced. Groups were invited to private meetings to discuss the bill. Tours of ships and shipyards were arranged. The Kaiser and Chancellor stressed that the fleet was only intended for protection of Germany, but so that even a first class power might think twice before attacking. Highlights from a letter Prince Bismarck wrote were read out in the Reichstag, though not mentioning passages where he expressed reservations. Papers were circulated showing the relative size of foreign fleets, and how much Germany had fallen behind, particularly when considering the great power of her army compared to others.<ref>Massie pp. 174\u2013178</ref>\n\nA press bureau was created in the Navy Ministry to ensure journalists were thoroughly briefed, and to politely answer any and all objections. Pre-written articles were provided for the convenience of journalists. University professors were invited to speak on the importance of protecting German trade. The [[Navy League (Germany)|Navy League]] was formed to  popularise the idea of world naval power and its importance to the [[German Empire|Empire]]. It was argued that colonies overseas were essential, and Germany deserved her 'place in the sun'. League membership grew from 78,000 in 1898, to 600,000 in 1901 and 1.1 million by 1914. Especial attention was given to members of the budget committee who would consider the bill in detail. Their interests and connections were analysed to find ways to influence them. Steel magnate [[Friedrich Alfred Krupp|Fritz Krupp]] and shipowner [[Albert Ballin]] of the [[Hamburg-America Line]] were invited to speak on the benefits of the bill to trade and industry.<ref>Massie p. 178</ref>\n\nObjections were raised that the bill surrendered one of the most important powers of the Reichstag, that of annually scrutinising expenditure. Conservatives felt that expenditure on the navy was wasted, and that if money was available it should go to the army, which would be the deciding factor in any likely war. [[Eugen Richter]] of the Liberal Radical Union opposing the bill observed that if it was intended for Germany now seriously to take up the Trident to match its other forces then such a small force would not suffice and there would be no end to ship building. [[August Bebel]] of the Social Democrats argued that there existed a number of deputies who were Anglophobes and wished to pick a fight with Britain, but that to imagine such a fleet could take on the Royal Navy was insanity and anyone saying it belonged in the madhouse.<ref>Massie pp. 177\u2013179</ref>\n\nYet by the end of the debates the country was convinced that the bill would and should be passed. On 26 March 1898 it did so, by a majority of 212 to 139. All those around the Kaiser were ecstatic at their success. Tirpitz as navy minister was elevated to a seat on the Prussian Ministry of State. His influence and importance as the man who had accomplished this miracle was assured and he was to remain at the center of government for the next nineteen years.\n\n====Second Naval Bill====\nOne year after the passage of the bill Tirpitz appeared before the Reichstag and declared his satisfaction with it. The specified fleet would still be smaller than the French or British, but would be able to deter the Russians in the [[Baltic region|Baltic]]. Within another year all had changed. In October 1899 the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] broke out between the British and [[Boers]] in [[South Africa]]. In January 1900 a British cruiser intercepted three German mail steamers and searched them for war supplies intended for the Boers. Germany was outraged and the opportunity presented itself for a second Naval Bill. The second bill doubled the number of battleships from nineteen to thirty-eight. This would form four squadrons of eight ships, plus two flagships and four reserves. The bill now spanned seventeen years from 1901 to 1917 with the final ships being completed by 1920. This would constitute the second-largest fleet in the world and although no mention was made in the bill of specific enemies, it made several general mentions of a greater power which it was intended to oppose. There was only one navy which could be meant. On 5 December 1899 Tirpitz was promoted to ''[[Vizeadmiral]]'' (vice admiral). The bill passed on 20 June 1900.<ref>Massie pp. 180\u2013181</ref>\n\nSpecifically written into the preamble was an explanation of Tirpitz's Risk Theory. Although the German fleet would be smaller, it was likely that an enemy with a world spanning empire would not be able to concentrate all its forces in local waters. Even if it could, the German fleet would still be sufficiently powerful to inflict significant damage in any battle, sufficient damage that the enemy would be unable to maintain its other naval commitments and must suffer irreparable harm. Thus no such enemy would risk an engagement. Privately Tirpitz acknowledged that a second risk existed: that Britain, seeing its growing enemy might choose to strike first, might destroy the German fleet before it grew to a dangerous size. A similar course had been taken before, when [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]] sank [[Denmark|Danish]] ships [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|at Copenhagen]] to prevent them falling into French hands, and would be again in the [[Second World War]] when French ships were sunk [[Attack on Mers-el-Kebir|at Mers-el-K\u00e9bir]] to prevent them falling into German hands. A term, \"[[Copenhagenization (naval)|Copenhagenization]]\", even existed in English for this. Tirpitz calculated this danger period would end in 1904 or 1905. In the event, Britain responded to the increased German building programme by building more ships herself and the theoretical danger period extended itself to beyond the start of the Great War. As a reward for the successful bill Tirpitz was ennobled with the hereditary article ''von'' before his name in 1900.<ref>Massie pp. 181\u2013182</ref>\n\nTirpitz noted the difficulties in his relationship with the Kaiser. Wilhelm respected him as the only man who had succeeded in persuading the Reichstag to start and then increase a world class navy, but he remained unpredictable. He was fanatical about the navy, but would come up with wild ideas for improvements, which Tirpitz had to deflect to maintain his objectives. Each summer Tirpitz would go to St Blasien with his aides to work on naval plans, then in September he would travel to the Kaiser's retreat at [[Rominten Hunting Lodge|Rominten]], where Tirpitz found he would be more relaxed and willing to listen to a well argued explanation.<ref>Massie pp. 182\u2013183</ref>\n\nThree supplementary naval bills ('Novelles') were passed, in June 1906, April 1908 and June 1912. The first followed German diplomatic defeats over [[Morocco]], and added six large cruisers to the fleet. The second followed fears of British encroachment, and reduced the replacement time which a ship would remain in service from 25 to 20 years. The third was caused by the [[Agadir Crisis]] where again Germany had to draw back. This time three more battleships were added.<ref>Massie p. 183</ref>\n\nThe first naval law caused little alarm in Great Britain. There was already in force a dual power standard defining the size of the British fleet as at least that of the next two largest fleets combined. There was now a new player, but her fleet was similar in size to the other two possible threats, Russia and France, and a number of battleships were already under construction. The second naval law, however, caused serious alarm: eight [[King Edward VII-class battleship]]s were ordered in response. It was the regularity and efficiency with which Germany was now building ships, which were seen to be as good as any in the world, which raised concern. Information about the design of the new battleships suggested they were only intended to operate within a short range of a home base and not to stay at sea for extended periods. They seemed designed only for operations in the [[North Sea]]. The result was that Britain abandoned its policy of isolation which had held force since the time of Nelson and began to look for allies against the growing threat from Germany. Ships were withdrawn from around the world and brought back to British waters, while construction of new ships increased.<ref>Massie pp. 184\u2013185</ref>\n\n====Tirpitz Plan====\nTirpitz's design to achieve world power status through naval power, while at the same time addressing domestic issues, is referred to as the [[Tirpitz Plan]]. Politically, the Tirpitz Plan was marked by the [[Fleet Acts]] of 1898, 1900, 1908 and 1912. By 1914, they had given Germany the second-largest naval force in the world (roughly 40% smaller than the [[Royal Navy]]). It included seventeen modern [[Battleship|dreadnoughts]], five [[battlecruiser]]s, twenty-five [[cruiser]]s and twenty pre-dreadnought [[battleship]]s as well as over forty [[submarine]]s. Although including fairly unrealistic targets, the expansion programme was sufficient to alarm the British, starting a costly naval arms race and pushing the British into closer ties with the French.\n\nTirpitz developed a \"Risk Theory\" whereby, if the [[German Imperial Navy]] reached a certain level of strength relative to the British [[Royal Navy]], the British would try to avoid confrontation with Germany (that is, maintain a [[fleet in being]]). If the two navies fought, the German Navy would inflict enough damage on the British that the latter ran a risk of losing their naval dominance. Because the British relied on their navy to maintain control over the [[British Empire]], Tirpitz felt they would opt to maintain naval supremacy in order to safeguard their empire, and let Germany become a world power, rather than lose the empire at the cost of keeping Germany less powerful. This theory sparked a naval [[arms race]] between Germany and Great Britain in the first decade of the 20th century.\n\n[[Image:Alfred v.Tirpitz 1915.png|thumb|upright|left|Grand Admiral von Tirpitz in 1915]]\n\nThis theory was based on the assumption that Great Britain would have to send its fleet into the [[North Sea]] to blockade the German ports (blockading Germany was the only way the Royal Navy could seriously harm Germany), where the German Navy could force a battle. However, due to Germany's geographic location, Great Britain could blockade Germany by closing the entrance to the North Sea in the [[English Channel]] and the area between [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] and the [[Shetland Islands]]. Faced with this option a German Admiral commented, \"If the British do that, the role of our navy will be a sad one,\" correctly predicting the role the surface fleet would have during the [[First World War]].\n\nPolitically and strategically, Tirpitz's Risk Theory ensured its own failure. By its very nature it forced Britain into measures that would have been previously unacceptable to the British establishment. The necessity to concentrate the fleet against the German threat involved Britain making arrangements with other powers that enabled her to return the bulk of her naval forces to [[Home Fleet|Home Waters]]. The first evidence of this is seen in the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance|Anglo-Japanese treaty]] of 1902 that enabled the battleships of the China squadron to be re-allocated back to Europe. The Japanese fleet, largely constructed in British shipyards, then proceeded to utterly destroy the Russian navy in the [[Russo-Japanese War|war of 1904\u201305]], removing Russia as a credible maritime opponent. The necessity to reduce the Mediterranean Fleet in order to reinforce the navy in home waters was also a powerful influence in its d\u00e9tente and [[Entente Cordiale]] with the French. By forcing the British to come to terms with its most traditional opponent, Tirpitz scuttled his own policy. Britain was no longer at 'risk' from France, and the Japanese destruction of the Russian fleet removed that nation as a naval threat. In the space of a few years, Germany was faced with virtually the whole strength of the Royal Navy deployed against its own fleet, and Britain committed to her list of potential enemies. The Tirpitz 'risk theory' made it more probable that, in any future conflict between the European powers, Britain would be on the side of Germany's foes, and that the full force of the most powerful navy in the world would be concentrated against her fleet.\n\nTirpitz had been made a ''[[Gro\u00dfadmiral]]'' (grand admiral) in 1911, without patent (the document that accompanied formal promotions personally signed at this level by the Kaiser himself). At that time, the [[German Imperial Navy]] had only four ranks for admirals: rear admiral, (''Konteradmiral'', equal to a ''Generalmajor'' in the army, with no pips on the shoulders); vice admiral (''Vizeadmiral'', equal to a ''Generalleutnant'', with one pip); admiral (equal to a ''General der Infanterie'', with two pips), and grand admiral (equal to a field marshal). Tirpitz's shoulder boards had four pips, and he never received a grand admiral's baton or the associated insignia. \n\n====World War I====\n\nDespite the building programme he oversaw, he believed that the war had come too soon for a successful surface challenge to the Royal Navy, as the Fleet Act of 1900 had included a seventeen-year timetable. Unable to direct naval operations from his purely administrative position, Tirpitz became a vocal spokesman for unrestricted [[U-boat]] warfare, which he felt could break the British stranglehold on Germany's sea lines of communication. While the German Navy briefly abandoned the observance of prize rules in 1915, this policy was soon reversed following the outcry over [[Sinking of the RMS Lusitania|the Lusitania's sinking]]. When the restrictions on the submarine war were not lifted, he fell out with the Kaiser and felt compelled to resign on 15 March 1916. He was replaced as Secretary of State of the Imperial Naval Office by [[Eduard von Capelle]]. \n\nDespite his support for unrestricted U-boat warfare, Tirpitz placed a low priority on submarine construction during his leadership of the Imperial Naval Office. Ultimately, this decision would result in a severe shortage of newly built U-boats by 1917.\n\n==Fatherland Party==\nIn 1917, Grand Admiral Tirpitz was co-founder of the [[Pan-Germanism|Pan-Germanic]] and nationalist [[Fatherland Party (Germany)|Fatherland Party]] (''Deutsche Vaterlandspartei'').<ref>Patrick J. Kelly, ''Tirpitz and the Imperial German Navy'' (2011) pp. 410\u2013421</ref> The party was organised jointly by [[Heinrich Cla\u00df]], [[Konrad Freiherr von Wangenheim]], Tirpitz as chairman and [[Wolfgang Kapp]] as his deputy. The party attracted the opponents of a negotiated peace and organised opposition to the parliamentary majority which was seeking peace negotiations. It sought to bring together outside parliament all parties on the political right, which had not previously been done. At its peak, in the summer of 1918, it had around 1,250,000 members. It proposed both ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and [[General (Germany)|General]] [[Erich Ludendorff]] as 'people's emperors' of a [[military state]] whose legitimacy was based upon war and war aims instead of on the parliamentary government of the ''Reich''. Internally, there were calls for a ''[[coup d'etat]]'' against the German government, to be led by Hindenburg and Ludendorff, even against the Emperor if necessary. Tirpitz's experience with the Navy League and mass political agitation convinced him that the means for a coup was at hand.<ref>Raffael Scheck, ''Alfred von Tirpitz and German right-wing politics, 1914\u20131930'' (1998), chapter 5</ref>\n\nTirpitz considered that one of the main aims of the war must be annexation of new territory in the west, to allow Germany to develop into a world power. This meant holding the [[Belgium|Belgian]] ports of [[Zeebrugge]] and [[Ostend]], with an eye to the main enemy, the United Kingdom. He proposed a separate peace treaty with Russia, giving them access to the ocean. Germany would be a great [[Continental Europe|continental]] state but could maintain its world position only by expanding world trade and continuing the fight against the UK. He complained of indecision and ambiguity in German policy, humanitarian ideas of self-preservation, a policy of appeasement of neutrals at the expense of vital German interests, and begging for peace. He called for vigorous warfare without regard for diplomatic and commercial consequences and supported the most extreme use of weapons, especially unrestricted submarine warfare.\n\nFrom 1908 to 1918, Tirpitz was a member of the [[Prussian House of Lords]]. After Germany's defeat, he supported the right-wing [[German National People's Party]] (''Deutschnationale Volkspartei'', or ''DNVP'') and sat for it in the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]'' from 1924 until 1928.\n\nTirpitz died in Ebenhausen, near [[Munich]], on 6 March 1930. He is buried in the [[Munich Waldfriedhof|Waldfriedhof]] in Munich.\n\n==Honours==\n*Honorary Doctorates from the Universities of [[G\u00f6ttingen]] (16 June 1913) and [[Greifswald]]\n*Honorary doctorate of engineering from the [[Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg]]\n*Freeman of the city of [[Frankfurt (Oder)]] (15 January 1917)\n*The German battleship [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']] was named after him in 1939.\n\n;Foreign honours\n*{{flagicon|Russian Empire}} [[Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky]] \u2013 ''August 1902'' \u2013 during the visit of the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|German Emperor]] to the Russian fleet maneuvers in Reval.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Latest intelligence - the Imperial meeting at Reval |day_of_week=Saturday |date=9 August 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36842| }}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n*{{cite book |title=My Memoirs |location= London/ New York |year=1919}} Republished in a single volume by NSNB with an introduction by Erik Empson in 2013 [https://www.amazon.com/Memoirs-Volumes-Illustrated-First-Classics-ebook/dp/B00DH2E9LE/ ASIN B00DH2E9LE].\n*{{cite book |title=The structure of German World Power |location= Stuttgart/ Berlin  |year=1924}}\n*{{cite book |title=German policy |location= Hamburg/Berlin |year=1926}}\n*{{cite book |title=Memories, 5 volumes | location= Berlin/Leipzig |year=1927}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anglo-German naval arms race]]\n* [[German interest in the Caribbean]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{commons}}\n===Works===\n* Tirpitz, Alfred von, ''Erinnerungen'' (Leipzig: K.F.Koehler, 1919).\n\n===Secondary source===\n* Berghahn, V.R.

The town is situated at the eastern limit of Obicinele Bucovinei mountains, in Humorului Depression, at the confluence of [[Moldova River]] and [[Humor River (Moldova)|Humor River]]. The average altitude of the town is 470 meters. The [[European route E58]] and the [[Suceava]] - [[Vatra Dornei]] railway pass through the town. Suceava, the county capital, is located 34&nbsp;km away. The town of [[Frasin]] is located nearby Gura Humorului (only 7&nbsp;km away).\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the 1775 Austrian Bukovina census, its population comprised only about 60,000 spread over 10,422 square kilometers. In order to encourage the development of this sparsely-settled land, the authorities subsidized the immigration of colonists to Bukovina. With the end of the first wave of settlement, colonists were to continue arriving at their own expense. As a result of these policies, the census of 1910 showed that the population had risen to over 800,000. People of many different ethnic groups took part in this immigration, including [[Germans]], [[Rusyns]], [[Hungarians in Romania|Hungarians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Poles]], [[Romanians]], and [[Jews]].\n\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Austrian and Romanian census data and/or official estimates\n|1910 |5,308\n|1930 |6,042\n|1948 |4,573\n|1956 |7,216\n|1966 |9,081\n|1977 |13,235\n|1992 |16,629\n|2002 |15,656\n|2011 |12,729\n|2016 |17,047\n}}\n\nIn 1992, Gura Humorului had a population of about 17,000 inhabitants were living within the town limits.

During [[World War I]], Bukovina became a battlefield between Austria opposing [[Russia]]n and [[Romania]]n troops. Although the Russians were finally driven out in 1917, defeated Austria would cede the Bukovina province to Romania through the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] (1919).\n\n==Jewish history of Gura Humorului==\n{{main|History of the Jews in Romania}}\nNo Jews lived in Gura Humorului before 1835, when they were allowed to settle, joining other, already represented, ethnic groups (such as Germans from [[Bohemia]], mainly from the [[B\u00f6hmerwald]]: thirty families settled on the mountainous and densely forested lands nearby the town, establishing a quarter named ''Bori''). The Jewish community began to flourish in 1869, when they formed around a third of the town's population (880 people); the same year, a [[Beth midrash]] was established.\n\nA turning point in the town's history was the disastrous fire of May 11, 1899 which destroyed most of the town, more than 400 houses, including many Jewish businesses and homes. It was rebuilt with donations from the [[United States]] Jewish communities.\n\nThe Jewish community in Gura Humorului continued to grow, reaching 1,951 members in 1927.\n\nJewish cultural life reached its peak in the inter-war period. The languages of choice in city life were Yiddish, German and [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. Most of the Jewish community adhered to [[Orthodox Judaism]], and Jewish youngsters studied the [[Torah]] along with secular subjects such as geography, history, and mathematics. The community had established Jewish social and political institutions that contributed to all fields of public life.\n\nWhile persecutions began to increase under the threats posed by Romanian [[Fascism|fascist]] movements such as the [[Iron Guard]], it was [[World War II]] that brought an end to Jewish presence in Gura Humorului.

The town is situated at the eastern limit of Obicinele Bucovinei mountains, in Humorului Depression, at the confluence of [[Moldova River]] and [[Humor River (Moldova)|Humor River]]. The average altitude of the town is 470 meters. The [[European route E58]] and the [[Suceava]] - [[Vatra Dornei]] railway pass through the town. Suceava, the county capital, is located 34&nbsp;km away. The town of [[Frasin]] is located nearby Gura Humorului (only 7&nbsp;km away).\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the 1775 Austrian Bukovina census, its population comprised only about 60,000 spread over 10,422 square kilometers. In order to encourage the development of this sparsely-settled land, the authorities subsidized the immigration of colonists to Bukovina. With the end of the first wave of settlement, colonists were to continue arriving at their own expense. As a result of these policies, the census of 1910 showed that the population had risen to over 800,000. People of many different ethnic groups took part in this immigration, including [[Germans]], [[Rusyns]], [[Hungarians in Romania|Hungarians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Poles]], [[Romanians]], and [[Jews]].\n\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Austrian and Romanian census data and/or official estimates\n|1910 |5,308\n|1930 |6,042\n|1948 |4,573\n|1956 |7,216\n|1966 |9,081\n|1977 |13,235\n|1992 |16,629\n|2002 |15,656\n|2011 |12,729\n|2016 |17,047\n}}\n\nIn 1992, Gura Humorului had a population of about 17,000 inhabitants were living within the town limits.

During [[World War I]], Bukovina became a battlefield between Austria opposing [[Russia]]n and [[Romania]]n troops. Although the Russians were finally driven out in 1917, defeated Austria would cede the Bukovina province to Romania through the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] (1919).\n\n==Jewish history of Gura Humorului==\n{{main|History of the Jews in Romania}}\nNo Jews lived in Gura Humorului before 1835, when they were allowed to settle, joining other, already represented, ethnic groups (such as Germans from [[Bohemia]], mainly from the [[B\u00f6hmerwald]]: thirty families settled on the mountainous and densely forested lands nearby the town, establishing a quarter named ''Bori''). The Jewish community began to flourish in 1869, when they formed around a third of the town's population (880 people); the same year, a [[Beth midrash]] was established.\n\nA turning point in the town's history was the disastrous fire of May 11, 1899 which destroyed most of the town, more than 400 houses, including many Jewish businesses and homes. It was rebuilt with donations from the [[United States]] Jewish communities.\n\nThe Jewish community in Gura Humorului continued to grow, reaching 1,951 members in 1927.\n\nJewish cultural life reached its peak in the inter-war period. The languages of choice in city life were Yiddish, German and [[Romanian language|Romanian]]. Most of the Jewish community adhered to [[Orthodox Judaism]], and Jewish youngsters studied the [[Torah]] along with secular subjects such as geography, history, and mathematics. The community had established Jewish social and political institutions that contributed to all fields of public life.\n\nWhile persecutions began to increase under the threats posed by Romanian [[Fascism|fascist]] movements such as the [[Iron Guard]], it was [[World War II]] that brought an end to Jewish presence in Gura Humorului. Under the dictatorship of [[Ion Antonescu]], Jews were rounded up and deported to [[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria]], where most of them perished \u2013 mass murdered through various means, including shootings and [[criminal negligence]] (see [[Romania during World War II#Romania and the Holocaust|Holocaust in Romania]]). Virtually all of the Jewish community in Gura Humorului was deported: 2,945 people were all transported on October 10, 1941.\n\nThe vast majority of survivors [[Aliyah|migrated]] to [[Israel]] in 1947-1951. Statistics show that they numbered below 500 people in all at the time of their departure.\n\n==Twin towns \u2013 sister cities==\n* {{flagicon|France}} [[Marly-le-Roi]], [[France]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n* {{flagicon|Poland}} [[Puck, Poland]]<ref>[http://www.ziare.com/suceava/primar/orasul-gura-humorului-infratit-cu-localitatea-poloneza-puck-2252070 orasul-gura-humorului-infratit-cu-localitatea-poloneza-puck_www.ziare.com]</ref>\n* {{flagicon|Romania}} [[Sulina]], [[Romania]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.primaria-sulina.ro/generaleoras/hot184infratireGuraHumorului.pdf |title=Decision No 183 on 5 December 2006 by Sulina |access-date=31 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401060459/https://www.primaria-sulina.ro/generaleoras/hot184infratireGuraHumorului.pdf |archive-date=1 April 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Natives==\n* [[Andreea Boghian]] - rower\n* [[Nathan Juran]] - American film director\n* [[Olha Kobylianska]] - Ukrainian-German writer\n* [[Viorel Lucaci]] - rugby player\n* [[Mihai Macovei]] - rugby player\n* [[Rixi Markus]] - [[Contract bridge|bridge]] player\n* [[Vlad Nistor]] - rugby player\n* [[Daniel Plai]] - rugby player\n* [[Victor S\u0103hleanu]] - physician and anthropologist\n* [[Dorin Semeghin]] - footballer\n* [[C\u0103t\u0103lin \u021a\u0103ranu]] - professional go player (5 Dan)\n* [[Salomon Wininger]] - biographer\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Gura Humorului 725300, Romania - panoramio (1).jpg|Panoramic view of the town\nFile:Primaria din Gura Humorului (1901)6.jpg|The Town Hall\nFile:Judecatoria Gura Humorului.jpg|The Town Court\nFile:Scoala nr. 1 din Gura Humorului.jpg|School No. 1\nFile:Scoala nr. 2 din Gura Humorului.jpg|School No. 2\nFile:Centrul ora\u0219ului Gura Humorului.jpg|Hotel Bucovina\nFile:Gura Humorului 725300, Romania - panoramio.jpg|Traditional Romanian wooden house\nFile:Olga Kobyleanska2.jpg|Olha Kobylianska Statue\nFile:Biserica romano-catolica din Gura Humorului10.jpg|The Roman Catholic Church\nFile:La catedral ortodoxa.jpg|The Orthodox Cathedral\nFile:Sinagoga Mare din Gura Humorului.jpg|The Synagogue\nFile:Voronet.jpg|[[Vorone\u021b Monastery]]\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Gura Humorului}}\n{{wikivoyage|Gura Humorului}}\n* {{in lang|ro}} [http://www.primariagh.ro/ Gura Humorului Town Hall official site]\n* {{in lang|ro}} [http://www.gurahumorului.info/ Gura Humorului touristic site]\n* {{in lang|ro}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20180601104848/http://gurahumor.ro/ Gura Humorului unofficial site]\n* {{in lang|ro}} [http://www.tourismguide.ro/html/orase/Suceava/Gura%20Humorului/scurt_istoric.php Tourism Guide - Gura Humorului web page]\n* {{in lang|ro}} [http://judetulsuceava.ro/localitati/orase/gura-humorului/ Suceava County site - Gura Humorului web page]\n* {{in lang|ro}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20121112184450/http://picasaweb.google.com/EdwardTurJ/OldBukowinaPhotosGurahumora Photo Gallery - Old photos of Gura Humorului]\n* {{in lang|he}} [http://humora.tripod.com/ Gura Humorului Jewish Community]\n* {{in lang|he}} [http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/gura1/gur203.html Comprehensive lists of Gura Humorului Jews killed in 1941]\n\n{{Suceava County}}\n\n[[Category:Towns in Romania]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Suceava County]]\n[[Category:Spa towns in Romania]]\n[[Category:Shtetls]]\n[[Category:Bukovina-German people]]\n[[Category:Jewish communities in Romania]]\n[[Category:Duchy of Bukovina]]\n[[Category:Localities in Southern Bukovina]]\n[[Category:Holocaust locations in Romania]]\n", "name_user": "Markussep", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gura_Humorului"}
