''[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/31/maths.science The science of fun]'' The Guardian, 30 May 2008</ref>\n\n==Major areas of research==\n\n===Combinatorial game theory===\nConway was widely known for his contributions to [[combinatorial game theory]] (CGT), a theory of [[partisan game]]s. This he developed with [[Elwyn Berlekamp]] and [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]], and with them also co-authored the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]''. He also wrote the book ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'' (''ONAG'') which lays out the mathematical foundations of CGT.\n\nHe was also one of the inventors of [[Sprouts (game)|sprouts]], as well as [[phutball|philosopher's football]]. He developed detailed analyses of many other games and puzzles, such as the [[Soma cube]], [[peg solitaire]], and [[Conway's soldiers]]. He came up with the [[angel problem]], which was solved in 2006.\n\nHe invented a new system of numbers, the [[surreal numbers]], which are closely related to certain games and have been the subject of a mathematical novelette by [[Donald Knuth]].<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/1995/dec/infinityplusonea599 Infinity Plus One, and Other Surreal Numbers] by Polly Shulman, [[Discover Magazine]], 1 December 1995</ref> He also invented a nomenclature for exceedingly [[large number]]s, the [[Conway chained arrow notation]]. Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.\n\n===Geometry===\nIn the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], Conway established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the [[grand antiprism]] in the process, the only [[non-Wythoffian]] uniform [[polychoron]].<ref>J. H. Conway, \"Four-dimensional Archimedean polytopes\", Proc. Colloquium on Convexity, Copenhagen 1965, Kobenhavns Univ. Mat. Institut (1967) 38\u201339.</ref> Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].\n\nIn the theory of tessellations, he devised the [[Conway criterion]] which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.<ref name=rhoads>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329\u2013353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.| bibcode=2005JCoAM.174..329R }}</ref>\n\nHe investigated lattices in higher dimensions, and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].\n\n===Geometric topology===\nIn knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayPolynomial.html Conway Polynomial] [[Wolfram MathWorld]]</ref> After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s.<ref>Livingston, Charles, Knot Theory (MAA Textbooks), 1993, {{ISBN|0883850273}}</ref> Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings.<ref>Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118.</ref>\n\n===Group theory===\nHe was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and [[Simon P. Norton]] he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the [[Conway groups]].<ref name=harris>Harris (2015)</ref> This work made him a key player in the successful [[classification of the finite simple groups]].\n\nBased on a 1978 observation by mathematician [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as [[monstrous moonshine]]. This subject, named by Conway, relates the [[monster group]] with [[elliptic modular function]]s, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics\u2014[[finite group]]s and [[complex function theory]]. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to [[string theory]].<ref>[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Monstrous_Moonshine_conjecture.html Monstrous Moonshine conjecture] David Darling: Encyclopedia of Science</ref>\n\nConway introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>]] to 13 points.\n\n===Number theory===\nAs a graduate student, he proved one case of a [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]], that every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.<ref>[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]</ref>\n\n===Algebra===\nConway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s.<ref>Conway and Smith (2003): \"Conway and Smith's book is a wonderful introduction to the normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions.\"</ref>  Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html| title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)| author=John Baez| date=2 October 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nHe invented a [[Conway base 13 function|base 13 function]] as a counterexample to the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the [[intermediate value theorem]]: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a [[Darboux property]] but is ''not'' [[continuous function|continuous]].\n\n===Algorithmics===\nFor calculating the day of the week, he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway could usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practised his calendrical calculations on his computer, which was programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logged on. One of his early books was on [[finite-state machine]]s.\n\n===Theoretical physics===\nIn 2004, Conway and [[Simon B. Kochen]], another Princeton mathematician, proved the [[free will theorem]], a startling version of the \"[[Hidden-variable theory|no hidden variables]]\" principle of [[quantum mechanics]]. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. In Conway's provocative wording: \"if experimenters have [[free will]], then so do elementary particles.\"<ref>''[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html Conway's Proof Of The Free Will Theorem] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516002546/http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html |date=16 May 2010 }}'' by Jasvir Nagra</ref>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nConway received the [[Berwick Prizes|Berwick Prize]] (1971),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lms.ac.uk/prizes/list-lms-prize-winners|title=List of LMS prize winners &#124; London Mathematical Society|website=www.lms.ac.uk}}</ref> was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (1981),<ref name=royal/> was the first recipient of the [[P\u00f3lya Prize (LMS)]] (1987),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\"/> won the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]] (1998) and received the [[Leroy P.

Much of this is discussed in the 0th part of ''ONAG''.\n\n===Geometry===\nIn the mid-1960s with [[Michael Guy (computer scientist)|Michael Guy]], Conway established that there are sixty-four [[uniform polychoron|convex uniform polychora]] excluding two infinite sets of prismatic forms. They discovered the [[grand antiprism]] in the process, the only [[non-Wythoffian]] uniform [[polychoron]].<ref>J. H. Conway, \"Four-dimensional Archimedean polytopes\", Proc. Colloquium on Convexity, Copenhagen 1965, Kobenhavns Univ. Mat. Institut (1967) 38\u201339.</ref> Conway has also suggested a system of notation dedicated to describing [[polyhedra]] called [[Conway polyhedron notation]].\n\nIn the theory of tessellations, he devised the [[Conway criterion]] which describes rules for deciding if a prototile will tile the plane.<ref name=rhoads>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/j.cam.2004.05.002 | volume=174 | issue=2 | title=Planar tilings by polyominoes, polyhexes, and polyiamonds | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics | pages=329\u2013353 | last1 = Rhoads | first1 = Glenn C.| bibcode=2005JCoAM.174..329R }}</ref>\n\nHe investigated lattices in higher dimensions, and was the first to determine the symmetry group of the [[Leech lattice]].\n\n===Geometric topology===\nIn knot theory, Conway formulated a new variation of the [[Alexander polynomial]] and produced a new invariant now called the Conway polynomial.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayPolynomial.html Conway Polynomial] [[Wolfram MathWorld]]</ref> After lying dormant for more than a decade, this concept became central to work in the 1980s on the novel [[knot polynomial]]s.<ref>Livingston, Charles, Knot Theory (MAA Textbooks), 1993, {{ISBN|0883850273}}</ref> Conway further developed [[tangle theory]] and invented a system of notation for tabulating knots, nowadays known as [[Conway notation (knot theory)|Conway notation]], while correcting a number of errors in the 19th century knot tables and extending them to include all but four of the non-alternating primes with 11 crossings.<ref>Topology Proceedings 7 (1982) 118.</ref>\n\n===Group theory===\nHe was the primary author of the ''[[ATLAS of Finite Groups]]'' giving properties of many [[finite simple group]]s. Working with his colleagues Robert Curtis and [[Simon P. Norton]] he constructed the first concrete representations of some of the [[sporadic group]]s. More specifically, he discovered three sporadic groups based on the symmetry of the [[Leech lattice]], which have been designated the [[Conway groups]].<ref name=harris>Harris (2015)</ref> This work made him a key player in the successful [[classification of the finite simple groups]].\n\nBased on a 1978 observation by mathematician [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], Conway and Norton formulated the complex of conjectures known as [[monstrous moonshine]]. This subject, named by Conway, relates the [[monster group]] with [[elliptic modular function]]s, thus bridging two previously distinct areas of mathematics\u2014[[finite group]]s and [[complex function theory]]. Monstrous moonshine theory has now been revealed to also have deep connections to [[string theory]].<ref>[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/M/Monstrous_Moonshine_conjecture.html Monstrous Moonshine conjecture] David Darling: Encyclopedia of Science</ref>\n\nConway introduced the [[Mathieu groupoid]], an extension of the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub>]] to 13 points.\n\n===Number theory===\nAs a graduate student, he proved one case of a [[Waring's problem|conjecture]] by [[Edward Waring]], that every integer could be written as the sum of 37 numbers each raised to the fifth power, though [[Chen Jingrun]] solved the problem independently before Conway's work could be published.<ref>[http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2005-09-57.pdf#page=34 Breakfast with John Horton Conway]</ref>\n\n===Algebra===\nConway has written textbooks and done original work in algebra, focusing particularly on [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s.<ref>Conway and Smith (2003): \"Conway and Smith's book is a wonderful introduction to the normed division algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the octonions.\"</ref>  Together with [[Neil Sloane]], he invented the [[icosians]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week20.html| title=This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 20)| author=John Baez| date=2 October 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Analysis===\nHe invented a [[Conway base 13 function|base 13 function]] as a counterexample to the [[converse (logic)|converse]] of the [[intermediate value theorem]]: the function takes on every real value in each interval on the real line, so it has a [[Darboux property]] but is ''not'' [[continuous function|continuous]].\n\n===Algorithmics===\nFor calculating the day of the week, he invented the [[Doomsday algorithm]]. The algorithm is simple enough for anyone with basic arithmetic ability to do the calculations mentally. Conway can usually give the correct answer in under two seconds. To improve his speed, he practiced his calendrical calculations on his computer, which is programmed to quiz him with random dates every time he logs on. One of his early books was on [[finite-state machine]]s.\n\n===Theoretical physics===\nIn 2004, Conway and [[Simon B. Kochen]], another Princeton mathematician, proved the [[free will theorem]], a startling version of the \"[[Hidden-variable theory|no hidden variables]]\" principle of [[quantum mechanics]]. It states that given certain conditions, if an experimenter can freely decide what quantities to measure in a particular experiment, then elementary particles must be free to choose their spins to make the measurements consistent with physical law. In Conway's provocative wording: \"if experimenters have [[free will]], then so do elementary particles.\"<ref>''[http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html Conway's Proof Of The Free Will Theorem] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516002546/http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html |date=16 May 2010 }}'' by Jasvir Nagra</ref>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nConway received the [[Berwick Prizes|Berwick Prize]] (1971),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.lms.ac.uk/prizes/list-lms-prize-winners|title=List of LMS prize winners &#124; London Mathematical Society|website=www.lms.ac.uk}}</ref> was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (1981),<ref name=royal/> was the first recipient of the [[P\u00f3lya Prize (LMS)]] (1987),<ref name=\"LMS Prizewinners\"/> won the [[Nemmers Prize in Mathematics]] (1998) and received the [[Leroy P.

The engineer, William Rockefeller, later admitted that before reaching the curve he had gone into a \"daze\", a sort of [[highway hypnosis]].\n\nThe leader of the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) team investigating said it was likely that the accident would have been prevented had [[positive train control]] (PTC) been installed per a prior federal mandate requiring its installation by 2015. Due to a number of other recent accidents involving Metro-North trains and tracks, the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA) demanded improved safety measures, which Metro-North began implementing within a week of the accident.\n\nIn late 2014, almost a year after the accident, the NTSB released its final report on the accident. After reiterating its earlier conclusion that PTC would have prevented the accident entirely, it found the most direct cause was Rockefeller's inattention as the train entered the curve. There were other contributing factors.

After a [[2008 Chatsworth train collision|2008 wreck]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], the FRA mandated all American railroads implement PTC by 2015. Many resisted, complaining about the cost of the technology. Among those railroads were both MTA commuter railroads, Metro-North and the [[Long Island Rail Road]], which have sought to have that deadline extended until 2018. In the wake of the Spuyten Duyvil derailment, U.S. Rep. [[Sean Patrick Maloney]], a resident of [[Cold Spring, New York|Cold Spring]] whose neighbor James Lovell was one of those killed, introduced legislation to make low-interest loans and guarantees available so that commuter railroads like Metro-North could implement PTC.<ref name=\"FRA letter story\" /> Eventually other congressmembers from the lower Hudson Valley joined as cosponsors.<ref name=\"Journal News Deep Dive story\">{{cite news|last=Juva-Brown|first=Theresa|title=Bronx derailment: Grants program pushed for Metro-North|url=http://www.lohud.com/article/20131215/NEWS/312150049/Bronx-derailment-Grants-program-pushed-Metro-North-|newspaper=[[The Journal News]]|date=December 15, 2013|accessdate=December 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Metro-North crew installing speed restriction sign.jpg|thumb|left|Metro-North crews install speed-restriction sign on a stretch of the [[New Haven Line]] two weeks after the Spuyten Duyvil accident|alt=Four men in reflectorized orange vests and neon green helmets standing next to a set of four railroad tracks installing a signpost next to the track.

It sounds an alarm when the train exceeds speed limits for 25 seconds and shuts it down after an additional 15 seconds if no action is taken by the engineer. It might have been able to prevent the accident; however it was in the locomotive, at the rear of the train, not the cab where Rockefeller was located.<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" />\n\nWhile Metro-North used it only to prevent collisions, rail safety experts said it could easily be configured to force trains to slow down at curves such as Spuyten Duyvil, since it relied on signals sent through the rails themselves. It was also preferable to the traditional [[dead man's switch]] the cab was equipped with, which requires constant action and attention from the engineer. The MTA said it was considering doing so at 30 sites on the Metro-North and LIRR networks.<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" /> On December 6, the FRA issued an emergency order requiring Metro-North to have two qualified crew members in the cab at any point where the speed limit drops by more than {{convert|20|mph}} until it installs that technology in cabs and at those sites.<ref name=\"FRA mandate story\" /> The next day Metro-North announced it was upgrading the signals at the Spuyten Duyvil curve and several others in the system; it would also lower the speed limit going into the curve so that it would be a less-than-20-mph drop and thus the extra engineer would not be necessary.<ref name=\"MTA changes story\">{{cite news|title=Safety Upgrades Coming to Metro-North Derailment Site: MTA|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Safety-Upgrades-MTA-Metro-North-Train-Derailment-Bronx-Spuyten-Duyvil-Curve-234987791.html|newspaper=[[WNBC-TV]]|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref> U.S. Senators [[Richard Blumenthal]] of Connecticut and [[Charles Schumer]] of New York called on Metro-North to install cameras to monitor both the track and the engineers.<ref name=\"Senators call for cameras\">{{cite news|last=Castillo|first=Alfonso A.|title=Senators call for train cameras to monitor engineer, track|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/senators-call-for-train-cameras-to-monitor-engineer-track-1.6564959|newspaper=[[Newsday]]|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn December 12, the FRA went further.

The engineer, William Rockefeller, later admitted that before reaching the curve he had gone into a \"daze\", a sort of [[highway hypnosis]].\n\nThe leader of the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) team investigating said it was likely that the accident would have been prevented had [[positive train control]] (PTC) been installed per a prior federal mandate requiring its installation by 2015. Due to a number of other recent accidents involving Metro-North trains and tracks, the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA) demanded improved safety measures, which Metro-North began implementing within a week of the accident.\n\nIn late 2014, almost a year after the accident, the NTSB released its final report on the accident. After reiterating its earlier conclusion that PTC would have prevented the accident entirely, it found the most direct cause was Rockefeller's inattention as the train entered the curve. There were other contributing factors. A medical examination following the accident diagnosed [[sleep apnea]], which had hampered his ability to fully adjust his sleep patterns to the morning shift which he had begun working two weeks earlier. The report faulted both Metro-North for not screening its employees in sensitive positions for [[sleep disorder]]s, and the FRA for not requiring railroads to do such screening.<ref name=\"NTSB brief\" />\n\n=={{anchor|Train}}Background==\n\nThe train involved in the accident was the second southbound [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]] train of the day, leaving [[Poughkeepsie (Metro-North station)|Poughkeepsie]], the line's northern terminus, at its scheduled departure time of 5:54&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|EST]].<ref name=\"current Metro-North schedule\">[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], {{cite web|url= http://web.mta.info/mnr/html/planning/schedules/pdf/NOV172013HUD-SS.pdf |title=Hudson Line weekend schedule|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|date= November 17, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216041718/http://www.mta.info/mnr/html/planning/schedules/pdf/NOV172013HUD-SS.pdf|archivedate=December 16, 2013|accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref> It was powered by a [[GE Genesis|GE P32AC-DM]] [[dual-mode locomotive|locomotive]],<ref name=\"Rockefeller interview transcript\">{{cite web|title=Transcript of Interview 8808 Engineer|url=http://dms.ntsb.gov/public%2F55500-55999%2F55841%2F551511.pdf|publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]]|page=48|date=December 3, 2013|accessdate=October 31, 2014}}</ref> capable of running on either diesel fuel or electricity from a [[third rail]].

These had led to five deaths and 129 injuries. \"The specific causes of each of these accidents may vary,\" Szabo wrote, \"but regardless of the reasons, four serious accidents in less than seven months is simply unacceptable.\"<ref name=\"FRA letter story\">{{cite news|last1=Keane|first1=Angela Greiling|last2=Klopott|first2=Freeman|last3=Goldman|first3=Henry|title=Metro-North Rebuked by U.S. Rail Regulator Over Accidents|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-12-04/metro-north-rebuked-by-u-s-rail-regulator-over-accidents.html|newspaper=[[Bloomberg news]]|date=December 3, 2013|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nSzabo asked the MTA for \"a serious, good faith commitment to the safe operation of the system.\" He said it needed to tell employees what, specifically, it would do to improve safety. He requested an answer in two days.<ref name=\"FRA letter story\" /> \"Immediate corrective action is imperative.\" Metro-North announced the day afterwards that it would institute a telephone line where employees could confidentially report \"close calls.\"<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" /> Prendergast later replied to Szabo that the railroad had held mandatory safety discussions for 4,000 employees at 20 locations since the accident.<ref name=\"FRA mandate story\">{{cite news|last=Juva-Brown|first=Theresa|title=Metro-North ordered to have extra crew members in train cabs, new signals|url=http://www.lohud.com/article/20131206/NEWS/312060056/Metro-North-ordered-extra-crew-members-train-cabs-new-signals|newspaper=The Journal News|date=December 6, 2013|accessdate=December 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe accident spurred further discussion of [[positive train control]] (PTC), which might have prevented it. After a [[2008 Chatsworth train collision|2008 wreck]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], the FRA mandated all American railroads implement PTC by 2015. Many resisted, complaining about the cost of the technology. Among those railroads were both MTA commuter railroads, Metro-North and the [[Long Island Rail Road]], which have sought to have that deadline extended until 2018. In the wake of the Spuyten Duyvil derailment, U.S. Rep. [[Sean Patrick Maloney]], a resident of [[Cold Spring, New York|Cold Spring]] whose neighbor James Lovell was one of those killed, introduced legislation to make low-interest loans and guarantees available so that commuter railroads like Metro-North could implement PTC.<ref name=\"FRA letter story\" /> Eventually other congressmembers from the lower Hudson Valley joined as cosponsors.<ref name=\"Journal News Deep Dive story\">{{cite news|last=Juva-Brown|first=Theresa|title=Bronx derailment: Grants program pushed for Metro-North|url=http://www.lohud.com/article/20131215/NEWS/312150049/Bronx-derailment-Grants-program-pushed-Metro-North-|newspaper=[[The Journal News]]|date=December 15, 2013|accessdate=December 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Metro-North crew installing speed restriction sign.jpg|thumb|left|Metro-North crews install speed-restriction sign on a stretch of the [[New Haven Line]] two weeks after the Spuyten Duyvil accident|alt=Four men in reflectorized orange vests and neon green helmets standing next to a set of four railroad tracks installing a signpost next to the track.

Instead they pointed to doubts about the technology's efficacy for large commuter rail networks. On a radio talk show following the crash, New York Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] conceded that PTC is \"controversial ... [some people say] it's not what it's cracked up to be.\" The MTA itself said it was \"untested and unproven for commuter railroads [of our] size and complexity.\"<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" />\n\nSeveral days later ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the train had a device known as an [[cab signalling#Cab signalling in the United States|alerter]]. It sounds an alarm when the train exceeds speed limits for 25 seconds and shuts it down after an additional 15 seconds if no action is taken by the engineer. It might have been able to prevent the accident; however it was in the locomotive, at the rear of the train, not the cab where Rockefeller was located.<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" />\n\nWhile Metro-North used it only to prevent collisions, rail safety experts said it could easily be configured to force trains to slow down at curves such as Spuyten Duyvil, since it relied on signals sent through the rails themselves. It was also preferable to the traditional [[dead man's switch]] the cab was equipped with, which requires constant action and attention from the engineer. The MTA said it was considering doing so at 30 sites on the Metro-North and LIRR networks.<ref name=\"NYT alerter story\" /> On December 6, the FRA issued an emergency order requiring Metro-North to have two qualified crew members in the cab at any point where the speed limit drops by more than {{convert|20|mph}} until it installs that technology in cabs and at those sites.<ref name=\"FRA mandate story\" /> The next day Metro-North announced it was upgrading the signals at the Spuyten Duyvil curve and several others in the system; it would also lower the speed limit going into the curve so that it would be a less-than-20-mph drop and thus the extra engineer would not be necessary.<ref name=\"MTA changes story\">{{cite news|title=Safety Upgrades Coming to Metro-North Derailment Site: MTA|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Safety-Upgrades-MTA-Metro-North-Train-Derailment-Bronx-Spuyten-Duyvil-Curve-234987791.html|newspaper=[[WNBC-TV]]|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref> U.S. Senators [[Richard Blumenthal]] of Connecticut and [[Charles Schumer]] of New York called on Metro-North to install cameras to monitor both the track and the engineers.<ref name=\"Senators call for cameras\">{{cite news|last=Castillo|first=Alfonso A.|title=Senators call for train cameras to monitor engineer, track|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/senators-call-for-train-cameras-to-monitor-engineer-track-1.6564959|newspaper=[[Newsday]]|date=December 8, 2013|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn December 12, the FRA went further.

[[World Wide Tours bus crash#Prosecution of Ophadell Williams|In 2012]], prosecutors argued that Ophadell Williams, the driver of a bus on which 15 passengers died on their way to a casino in [[Connecticut]], had knowingly endangered lives by repeatedly driving without adequate sleep.

the United Kingdom by Sid Gentle Films for [[BBC America]]. The series follows [[Eve Polastri]] ([[Sandra Oh]]), a [[British intelligence agencies|British intelligence]] investigator tasked with capturing psychopathic assassin [[Villanelle (character)|Villanelle]] ([[Jodie Comer]]); as the chase progresses, the two [[Relationship of Eve Polastri and Villanelle|develop a mutual obsession]]. Based on the ''[[Codename Villanelle|Villanelle]]'' novel series by [[Luke Jennings]], each of the show's series has featured a different female [[showrunner]]. [[Phoebe Waller-Bridge]] was head writer of the first series, while [[Emerald Fennell]] took over for the second series. Suzanne Heathcote will serve as showrunner for the third series.\n\nThe show has been highly successful in both the United States and the United Kingdom, receiving critical acclaim for both the first and second series, particularly for its writing and the lead actresses' performances. The first series had unbroken weekly ratings increases, among adults especially. It has received several accolades, including a [[Peabody Award]] and the [[British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series]]. Both Oh and Comer have won multiple Best Actress awards for their roles, with [[Fiona Shaw]] winning one for Best Supporting Actress as Carolyn Martens.\n\nBy January 2020, ''Killing Eve'' had been renewed for both a third and a fourth series.<ref name=\"auto5\">{{cite web |last=Webb Mitovich |first=Matt |title=''Killing Eve'' Renewed for Season 3 |url=https://tvline.com/2019/04/08/killing-eve-renewed-season-3/ |website=[[TVLine]] |accessdate=8 April 2019 |location=United States |date=8 April 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"auto4\">{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/tv/2020/01/03/killing-eve-renewed-season-4/|website=Entertainment Weekly|date=3 January 2020|title=Killing Eve renewed for season 4|last=Snierson|first=Dan}}</ref> The third series premiered on 12 April 2020.\n\n==Synopsis==\nBored with her protection role within the British intelligence agencies, [[Eve Polastri]] is overly interested with female assassins, their psychologies, and their methods of killing. After brashly investigating behind-the-scenes in relation to a witness she is handling, she is fired from [[MI5]]; however, to her delight, she is recruited by a secret division within [[MI6]] chasing an international assassin who calls herself [[Villanelle (character)|Villanelle]]. Eve crosses paths with Villanelle and discovers that members within both of their secret circles may be more interconnected than she is comfortable with, but forms [[Relationship of Eve Polastri and Villanelle|an obsession with Villanelle that is more enthusiastically reciprocated]]. Both women begin to focus less on their initial missions in order to desperately seek more about the other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/shows/killing-eve/about|title=About the Show|website=[[BBC America]]|accessdate=24 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{See also|Relationship of Eve Polastri and Villanelle}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Sandra Oh]] as [[Eve Polastri]], an agent with [[MI5]] (the UK's domestic [[counter-intelligence]] and security agency) who becomes obsessed with a notorious assassin and is recruited on an off-the-books basis to the foreign [[intelligence agency]] [[MI6]].\n* [[Jodie Comer]] as [[Villanelle (character)|Oksana Astankova / Villanelle]], a psychopathic, skilled assassin who becomes obsessed with the MI5 officer who is tracking her.\n* [[Fiona Shaw]] as Carolyn Martens, head of the Russia Section at [[MI6]].\n* [[Kim Bodnia]] as Konstantin Vasiliev, Villanelle's handler.\n* [[Owen McDonnell]] as Niko Polastri, Eve's English-Polish husband, a teacher.\n* Sean Delaney as Kenny Stowton, Carolyn's son, an ex-hacker who has been recruited by MI6.
