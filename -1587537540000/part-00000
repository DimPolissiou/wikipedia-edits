Thomas expressed an interest in re-signing with Phoenix,<ref>https://www.azcentral.com/sports/suns/articles/0627suns0627.html</ref> though the Suns were over the salary cap and expected Stoudemire to return as their starter.<ref>https://www.azcentral.com/sports/suns/articles/0630suns0630.html</ref>\n\n===Los Angeles Clippers===\nOn July 13, 2006, Thomas signed a four-year, $24 million contract with the [[Los Angeles Clippers]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=2518352|title=Tim Thomas joining Clippers|date=2006-07-13|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-14}}</ref> He frequently started in place of [[Elton Brand]] and [[Chris Kaman]], though Thomas himself also battled injuries.\n\n===Second stint with New York===\nOn November 21, 2008, Thomas and [[Cuttino Mobley]] were traded to the New York Knicks, in exchange for [[Zach Randolph]] and [[Mardy Collins]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nba.com/2008/news/features/11/21/aldridge.reax/|title=NBA.com: Knicks not done dealing, pull off trade with Clippers|website=www.nba.com|access-date=2019-03-14}}</ref> In his return to the Knicks, Thomas was reunited with [[Mike D'Antoni]], who was his coach in Phoenix.\n\n===Second stint with Chicago===\nOn February 19, 2009, Thomas was traded again to the Bulls along with center [[Jerome James]] and guard [[Anthony Roberson]] in exchange for guard [[Larry Hughes]] just before the trade deadline.<ref name=\"Thomas back to Bulls\">{{cite web\n|url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3919012\n|title = Sources: Knicks trade for Bulls' Hughes\n|first =\n|last = \n|accessdate = February 19, 2009}}</ref> His second stint in Chicago was more successful than his first, as he provided veteran leadership to the young team, helping the Bulls make a late-season push to qualify for the playoffs.

The unit of measurement used is the [[Solar radius|radius of the Sun]] (approximately {{convert|1|solar radius|km mi|0|abbr=on|disp=out|lk=on}}).\n\nThe exact order of this list is very incomplete, as great uncertainties currently remain, especially when deriving various important parameters used in calculations, such as stellar [[luminosity]] and [[effective temperature]]. Often stellar radii can only be expressed as an average or within a large range of values. Values for stellar radii vary significantly in sources and throughout the literature, mostly as the boundary of the very tenuous atmosphere ([[Opacity (optics)|opacity]]) greatly differs depending on the wavelength of light in which the [[star]] is observed.\n\nRadii of several stars can be directly obtained by [[Astronomical optical interferometry|stellar interferometry]]. Other methods can use lunar [[occultation]]s or from [[eclipsing binaries]], which can be used to test other indirect methods of finding true stellar size. Only a few useful [[supergiant]] stars can be occulted by the Moon, including [[Antares]] and [[Aldebaran]]. Examples of eclipsing binaries are [[Epsilon Aurigae]], [[VV Cephei]], and [[HR 5171]].\n\n__TOC__\n\n==Caveats==\n[[File:Sun and VY Canis Majoris.svg|thumb|right|309x309 px|The extreme [[red hypergiant]] star [[VY Canis Majoris]] compared to the Sun and Earth's orbit.]]\nComplex issues exist in determining the true radii of the largest stars, which in many cases do display significant errors. The following lists are generally based on various considerations or assumptions; these include:\n* Largest stars are usually expressed in units of the [[solar radius]] ({{solar radius}}), where {{solar radius|1.00}} equals 695,700 kilometres.\n* Stellar radii or diameters are usually derived only approximately using [[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law]] for the deduced stellar [[luminosity]] and [[effective temperature|effective surface temperature]].\n* [[Stellar distance]]s, and their errors, for most, remain uncertain or poorly determined.\n* Many supergiant stars have extended atmospheres, and many are embedded within opaque dust shells, making their true effective temperatures highly uncertain.\n* Many extended supergiant atmospheres also significantly change in size over time, regularly or irregularly pulsating over several months or years as [[variable star]]s. This makes adopted [[luminosity|luminosities]] poorly known and may significantly change the quoted radii.\n* Other direct methods for determining stellar radii rely on lunar [[occultation]]s or from eclipses in binary systems. This is only possible for a very small number of stars.\n* Based on various theoretical [[stellar evolution|evolutionary models]], few red supergiants will exceed 1,500 times the Sun (roughly 3,000\u20133,715&nbsp;K and M<sub>bol</sub> = \u22129 or {{solar luminosity|300,000}}).{{clarify|date=October 2019}} Such limits maybe also depend on the stellar [[metallicity]].<ref name=\"levesqueetal2005\">Table 4 in {{Cite journal|last1=Levesque|first1=Emily M.|last2=Massey|first2=Philip|last3=Olsen|first3=K.

The unit of measurement used is the [[Solar radius|radius of the Sun]] (approximately {{convert|1|solar radius|km mi|0|abbr=on|disp=out|lk=on}}).\n\nThe exact order of this list is very incomplete, as great uncertainties currently remain, especially when deriving various important parameters used in calculations, such as stellar [[luminosity]] and [[effective temperature]]. Often stellar radii can only be expressed as an average or within a large range of values. Values for stellar radii vary significantly in sources and throughout the literature, mostly as the boundary of the very tenuous atmosphere ([[Opacity (optics)|opacity]]) greatly differs depending on the wavelength of light in which the [[star]] is observed.\n\nRadii of several stars can be directly obtained by [[Astronomical optical interferometry|stellar interferometry]]. Other methods can use lunar [[occultation]]s or from [[eclipsing binaries]], which can be used to test other indirect methods of finding true stellar size. Only a few useful [[supergiant]] stars can be occulted by the Moon, including [[Antares]] and [[Aldebaran]]. Examples of eclipsing binaries are [[Epsilon Aurigae]], [[VV Cephei]], and [[HR 5171]].\n\n__TOC__\n\n==Caveats==\n[[File:Sun and VY Canis Majoris.svg|thumb|right|309x309 px|The extreme [[red hypergiant]] star [[VY Canis Majoris]] compared to the Sun and Earth's orbit.]]\nComplex issues exist in determining the true radii of the largest stars, which in many cases do display significant errors. The following lists are generally based on various considerations or assumptions; these include:\n* Largest stars are usually expressed in units of the [[solar radius]] ({{solar radius}}), where {{solar radius|1.00}} equals 695,700 kilometres.\n* Stellar radii or diameters are usually derived only approximately using [[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law]] for the deduced stellar [[luminosity]] and [[effective temperature|effective surface temperature]].\n* [[Stellar distance]]s, and their errors, for most, remain uncertain or poorly determined.\n* Many supergiant stars have extended atmospheres, and many are embedded within opaque dust shells, making their true effective temperatures highly uncertain.\n* Many extended supergiant atmospheres also significantly change in size over time, regularly or irregularly pulsating over several months or years as [[variable star]]s. This makes adopted [[luminosity|luminosities]] poorly known and may significantly change the quoted radii.\n* Other direct methods for determining stellar radii rely on lunar [[occultation]]s or from eclipses in binary systems.

There were two distinct forms of shadow puppetry, Pekingese (northern) and Cantonese (southern). The two styles were differentiated by the method of making the puppets and the positioning of the rods on the [[puppets]], as opposed to the type of [[Play (theatre)|play]] performed by the puppets. Both styles generally performed plays depicting great adventure and fantasy, rarely was this very stylized form of theatre used for political propaganda. Cantonese shadow puppets were the larger of the two. They were built using thick leather which created more substantial shadows. Symbolic color was also very prevalent; a black face represented honesty, a red one bravery. The rods used to control Cantonese puppets were attached perpendicular to the puppets' heads. Thus, they were not seen by the audience when the shadow was created. Pekingese puppets were more delicate and smaller. They were created out of thin, translucent leather (usually taken from the belly of a peacock). They were painted with vibrant paints, thus they cast a very colorful shadow. The thin rods which controlled their movements were attached to a leather collar at the neck of the puppet. The rods ran parallel to the bodies of the puppet then turned at a ninety degree angle to connect to the neck. While these rods were visible when the shadow was cast, they laid outside the shadow of the puppet; thus they did not interfere with the appearance of the figure. The rods attached at the necks to facilitate the use of multiple heads with one body. When the heads were not being used, they were stored in a muslin book or fabric lined box. The heads were always removed at night. This was in keeping with the old superstition that if left intact, the puppets would come to life at night. Some puppeteers went so far as to store the heads in one book and the bodies in another, to further reduce the possibility of reanimating puppets. Shadow puppetry is said to have reached its highest point of artistic development in the seventh century before becoming a tool of the government.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n==Xiangsheng==\n[[Xiangsheng]] is a style of traditional Chinese comedic performance in the form of a monologue or dialogue.\n[[China|Chinese]] performers usually clap with the audience at the end of a performance; the return applause is a sign of appreciation to the audience.<ref>{{cite book |title=China, Japan, Korea Culture and Customs |author1=Brown, Ju |author2=Brown, John |publisher=BookSurge |location=North Charleston |year=2006 |page=55 |isbn=1-4196-4893-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3r-3YH3t45cC&pg=PA55}}</ref>\n\n==Modern Chinese theatre==\nModern Chinese theatre and drama has changed quite a lot compared to the past. The influences of the modern world affected the form of music/ theatre/ drama the Chinese were having. The rapid development of the country made theater not as important, as it started to pay focus on its economic environment, not its culture. Although some elderly Chinese try to protect and make the old Chinese theater tradition not fade out, but the fading out of the traditional Chinese is unavoidable. The current Chinese theater has been developed to a new form: people do not watch plays from theater, they watch it at homes on their TV.

Since the owners would invest in further training for these people, they did not need much knowledge and skills beforehand.

These actors developed outstanding singing and dancing techniques to serve the ultimate goal of creating a character.<ref>{{harvnb|Shen|loc=p. 99.}}</ref> The most common way was for the leaders to hire music masters to teach them.

A fragrance breeze flutters the sleeve and a red haze arises, While jade wrists flit round and round in mazy flight.\"</blockquote>\n\n== Shadow play ==\nDuring the Dynasty of Empress Ping, [[Shadow play|shadow puppetry]] first emerged as a recognized form of theatre in China{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}. There were two distinct forms of shadow puppetry, Pekingese (northern) and Cantonese (southern). The two styles were differentiated by the method of making the puppets and the positioning of the rods on the [[puppets]], as opposed to the type of [[Play (theatre)|play]] performed by the puppets. Both styles generally performed plays depicting great adventure and fantasy, rarely was this very stylized form of theatre used for political propaganda. Cantonese shadow puppets were the larger of the two. They were built using thick leather which created more substantial shadows. Symbolic color was also very prevalent; a black face represented honesty, a red one bravery. The rods used to control Cantonese puppets were attached perpendicular to the puppets' heads. Thus, they were not seen by the audience when the shadow was created. Pekingese puppets were more delicate and smaller. They were created out of thin, translucent leather (usually taken from the belly of a peacock). They were painted with vibrant paints, thus they cast a very colorful shadow. The thin rods which controlled their movements were attached to a leather collar at the neck of the puppet. The rods ran parallel to the bodies of the puppet then turned at a ninety degree angle to connect to the neck. While these rods were visible when the shadow was cast, they laid outside the shadow of the puppet; thus they did not interfere with the appearance of the figure. The rods attached at the necks to facilitate the use of multiple heads with one body. When the heads were not being used, they were stored in a muslin book or fabric lined box. The heads were always removed at night. This was in keeping with the old superstition that if left intact, the puppets would come to life at night. Some puppeteers went so far as to store the heads in one book and the bodies in another, to further reduce the possibility of reanimating puppets. Shadow puppetry is said to have reached its highest point of artistic development in the seventh century before becoming a tool of the government.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n==Xiangsheng==\n[[Xiangsheng]] is a style of traditional Chinese comedic performance in the form of a monologue or dialogue.\n[[China|Chinese]] performers usually clap with the audience at the end of a performance; the return applause is a sign of appreciation to the audience.<ref>{{cite book |title=China, Japan, Korea Culture and Customs |author1=Brown, Ju |author2=Brown, John |publisher=BookSurge |location=North Charleston |year=2006 |page=55 |isbn=1-4196-4893-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3r-3YH3t45cC&pg=PA55}}</ref>\n\n==Modern Chinese theatre==\nModern Chinese theatre and drama has changed quite a lot compared to the past. The influences of the modern world affected the form of music/ theatre/ drama the Chinese were having. The rapid development of the country made theater not as important, as it started to pay focus on its economic environment, not its culture. Although some elderly Chinese try to protect and make the old Chinese theater tradition not fade out, but the fading out of the traditional Chinese is unavoidable. The current Chinese theater has been developed to a new form: people do not watch plays from theater, they watch it at homes on their TV. In addition to music theater, the modern world inspired new forms of drama, including what became known as the spoken drama ({{zh|s=\u8bdd\u5267|t=\u8a71\u5287|p=Hu\u00e0j\u00f9}}) of the Western stage.<ref>http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199920082/obo-9780199920082-0011.xml</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of theatres in China]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite book|chapter=Early Chinese Plays and Theater|last=Dolby|first=William|title=Chinese Theatre: From Its Origins to the Present Day|url=https://archive.org/details/chinesetheater00coli|url-access=registration|editor-last=Mackerras|editor-first=Colin|editor-link=Colin Mackerras|editor2-last=Wichmann|editor2-first=Elizabeth|isbn=0-8248-0813-4|year=1983|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|ref={{harvid|Dolby}}}}\n* {{Cite book|title=Chinese Opera: Images and Stories|last=Siu|first=Wang-Ngai|last2=Lovrick|first2=Peter|publisher=[[UBC Press]]|year=1997|isbn=0-7748-0592-7|ref={{harvid|Siu and Lovrick}}}}\n* {{cite book|title=Elite Theatre in Ming China, 1368\u20131644|last=Shen|first=Grant Guangren|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2005|isbn=0-415-34326-7|ref={{harvid|Shen}}}}\n* {{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Chinese Theater|last=Ye|first=Tan|year=2008|publisher=[[The Scarecrow Press]]|isbn=978-0-8108-5514-4|ref={{harvid|Ye}}}}\n* Fong, Kuang-Yu and Kaplin, Stephen. \"Theatre on a Tabletop: Puppetry for Small Spaces\".

{"title_page": "Bantustan", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2012}}\n{{Use South African English|date=May 2012}}\n{{Apartheid}}\nA '''Bantustan''' (also known as [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] homeland, [[Black people|black]] homeland, [[Khoisan|black]] state or simply homeland; {{Lang-af|Bantoestan}}) was a territory that the white [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] administration of South Africa set aside for [[People of Indigenous South African Bantu languages|black inhabitants]] of [[South Africa]] and [[South West Africa]] (now [[Namibia]]), as part of its policy of [[apartheid]]. The Government established ten Bantustans in South Africa, and ten in neighbouring South West Africa (then under South African administration), for the purpose of concentrating the members of designated ethnic groups, thus making each of those territories ethnically homogeneous as the basis for creating autonomous nation states for South Africa's different [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|black ethnic groups]]. Under the [[Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act]] of 1970, the Government stripped black South Africans of their citizenship, which deprived them of their few remaining political and civil rights in South Africa, and declared them to be citizens of these  homelands.<ref name=\"britannica\">[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Bantustan]</ref>\n\nThe term was first used in the late 1940s and was coined from Bantu (meaning ''people'' in some of the [[Bantu languages]]) and ''[[-stan]]'' (a suffix meaning ''[[Homeland|land]]'' in the [[Persian language]] and some Persian-influenced languages of [[Western Asia|western]], [[Central Asia|central]], and [[South Asia|southern Asia]]). It was regarded as a disparaging term by some critics of the apartheid-era government's ''homelands''. The word ''bantustan'', today, is often used in a [[pejorative]] sense when describing a region that lacks any real legitimacy, consists of several unconnected enclaves, or emerges from national or international [[gerrymandering]].{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe Government of South Africa declared as independent four of the South African Bantustans\u2014[[Transkei]], [[Bophuthatswana]], [[Venda]], and [[Ciskei]] (the so-called \"TBVC States\"), but this declaration was never recognised by [[Anti-Apartheid Movement|anti-apartheid forces]] in South Africa or by any international government. Other Bantustans (like [[KwaZulu]], [[Lebowa]], and [[QwaQwa]]) were assigned 'autonomy' but never granted 'independence'. In South West Africa, [[Ovamboland]], [[Kavangoland]], and [[East Caprivi]] were declared to be self-determining. The Bantustans were abolished with the end of apartheid in South Africa in 1994.\n\n== Creation ==\n[[File:South Africa racial map, 1979.gif|right|thumb|350px|Racial-demographic map of South Africa published by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] in 1979 with data from the 1970 South African census]]\nBritish colonial administrations in the 19th century, and subsequent South African governments, had established \"reserves\" in 1913 and 1936, with the intention of segregating black South Africans from whites. When the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] came to power in 1948, Minister for Native Affairs (and later [[Prime Minister of South Africa]]) [[Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd]] built on this, introducing a series of measures that reshaped South African society such that whites would be the demographic majority. The creation of the homelands or Bantustans was a central element of this strategy, as the long-term goal was to make the Bantustans independent. As a result, blacks would lose their South African citizenship and voting rights, allowing whites to remain in control of South Africa.\n\n[[File:South_Africa_%26_South_West_Africa_Bantustans_Map.svg|right|thumb|350px|Map of South Africa and South West Africa (now Namibia). This map shows the Bantustans that were present in both countries.]]\n\"The term 'Bantustan' was used by apartheid's apologists in reference to the [[partition of India]] in 1947. However, it quickly became pejorative in left and anti-apartheid usage, where it remained, while being abandoned by the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] in favour of 'homelands'.\"<ref>Susan Mathieson and David Atwell, \"Between Ethnicity and Nationhood: Shaka Day and the Struggle over Zuluness in post-Apartheid South Africa\" in ''Multicultural States: Rethinking Difference and Identity'' edited by David Bennett {{ISBN|0-415-12159-0}} (Routledge UK, 1998) p.122</ref>\n\n\"While apartheid was an ideology born of the will to survive or, put differently, the fear of extinction, Afrikaner leaders differed on how best to implement it. While some were satisfied with segregationist policies placing them at the top of a social and economic hierarchy, others truly believed in the concept of 'separate but equal'. For the latter, the ideological justification for the classification, segregation, and denial of political rights was the plan to set aside special land reserves for black South Africans, later called 'bantustans' or 'homelands'. Each ethnic group would have its own state with its own political system and economy, and each would rely on its own labour force. These independent states would then coexist alongside white South Africa in a spirit of friendship and collaboration. In their own areas, black citizens would enjoy full rights.\"<ref>Norman, Kajsa. Into the laager. Afrikaners living on the edge. Jonathan Ball Publishers. 2016. {{ISBN|978-1-86842-736-9}}. Page 106.</ref>\n\nVerwoerd argued that the Bantustans were the \"original homes\" of the black peoples of South Africa. In 1951, the government of [[Daniel Fran\u00e7ois Malan]] introduced the [[Bantu Authorities Act]] to establish \"homelands\" allocated to the country's black ethnic groups. These amounted to 13% of the country's land, the remainder being reserved for the white population. The homelands were run by cooperative tribal leaders, while uncooperative chiefs were forcibly deposed. Over time, a ruling black elite emerged with a personal and financial interest in the preservation of the homelands. While this aided the homelands' political stability to an extent, their position was still entirely dependent on South African support.\n\nThe role of the homelands was expanded in 1959 with the passage of the [[Bantu Self-Government Act]], which set out a plan called \"[[Separate Development]]\". This enabled the homelands to establish themselves in the long term as self-governing territories and ultimately as nominally fully \"independent\" states.\n\nThis process was to be achieved in a series of four major steps for each homeland:\n\n* The unification of the reserves set aside for the various \"tribes\" (officially called \"nations\" since 1959) under a single \"Territorial Authority\"\n* The establishment of a legislative assembly for each homeland with limited powers of self-rule\n* The establishment of the homeland as a \"self-governing territory\"\n* The granting of full nominal independence to the homeland\n\nThis general framework was not in each case followed in a clear-cut way, but often with a number of intermediate and overlapping steps.\n\nThe homeland of [[Transkei]] served in many regards as a \"testing ground\" for apartheid policies; its institutional development started already before the 1959 act, and its attainment of self-government and independence were therefore implemented earlier than for the other homelands.\n\nThis plan was stepped up under Verwoerd's successor as prime minister, [[John Vorster]], as part of his \"enlightened\" approach to apartheid. However, the true intention of this policy was to fulfill Verwoerd's original plan to make South Africa's blacks nationals of the homelands rather than of South Africa\u2014thus removing the few rights they still had as citizens. The homelands were encouraged to opt for independence, as this would greatly reduce the number of black citizens of South Africa. The process of creating the legal framework for this plan was completed by the [[Black Homelands Citizenship Act]] of 1970, which formally designated all black South Africans as citizens of the homelands, even if they lived in \"white South Africa\", and cancelled their South African citizenship, and the [[Bantu Homelands Constitution Act, 1971|Bantu Homelands Constitution Act]] of 1971, which provided a general blueprint for the stages of constitutional development of all homelands (except Transkei) from the establishment of Territorial Authorities up to full independence.\n\nBy 1984, all ten homelands in South Africa had attained self-government and four of them ([[Transkei]], [[Bophuthatswana|Boputhatswana]], [[Venda]] and [[Ciskei]]) had been declared fully independent between 1976 and 1981.\n\nThe following table shows the time-frame of the institutional and legal development of the ten South African Bantustans in light of the above-mentioned four major steps:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!Homeland\n!Tribe/Nation\n!Establishment of a unified territorial authority\n!Establishment of a legislative assembly\n!Self-Government\n!Nominal independence\n!Notes\n|-\n|{{Flag|Transkei}}\n|[[Xhosa people|Xhosa]]\n|1956<ref>The Transkeian Territorial Authority was established to replace the United Transkeian Territories General Council, by Proclamation No. R.180 in SA Government Gazette No. 5736 of 31 August 1956 with effect from 1 September 1956.</ref>\n|1963<ref name=\":3\">The Transkei was granted self-government by the Transkei Constitution Act 48 of 1963.

It has been estimated that 3.5 million people were forced from their homes from the 1960s through the 1980s, many being resettled in the Bantustans.\n\nThe government made clear that its ultimate aim was the total removal of the black population from South Africa. [[Connie Mulder]], the Minister of Plural Relations and Development, told the [[House of Assembly]] on 7 February 1978:\n\n{{quote|sign=|If our policy is taken to its logical conclusion as far as the black people are concerned, there will be not one black man with South African citizenship ...

In theory, self-governing Bantustans had control over many aspects of their internal functioning but were not yet sovereign nations. Independent Bantustans (Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei; also known as the TBVC states) were intended to be fully sovereign. In reality, they had little economic infrastructure worth mentioning and, with few exceptions, encompassed swaths of disconnected territory. This meant that the Bantustans were little more than puppet states controlled by South Africa.\n\nThroughout the existence of the \"independent\" Bantustans, South Africa remained the only country to recognise their independence. The South African government, lobbied for their recognition. In 1976, leading up to a [[United States House of Representatives]] resolution urging the President not to recognise Transkei, the South African government intensely lobbied lawmakers to oppose the bill.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pitterman |first=Shelly |authorlink= |title=A Fine Face for Apartheid |work=Southern Africa Perspectives |publisher= |date= |url=http://kora.matrix.msu.edu/files/50/304/32-130-E84-84-al.sff.document.af000020.pdf |format= |doi= |accessdate= }}</ref> Arbitrary and unrecognized [[Amateur radio call signs]] were created for the \"independent\" states and [[QSL cards]] were sent by operators using them, but the [[International Telecommunications Union]] never accepted these stations as legitimate.<ref>[http://lesnouvellesdx.fr/galerie/galerie2.php?page=moreqsl&pfx=S8  S8 - Transkei(Entit\u00e9 DXCC ayant chang\u00e9 de pr\u00e9fixe)]</ref> Each TBVC state extended recognition to the other independent Bantustans while South Africa showed its commitment to the notion of TBVC sovereignty by building embassies in the TBVC capitals.\n\n==Life in the Bantustans==\nThe Bantustans were generally poor, with few local employment opportunities.<ref name=\"Colorado Bantustans\">{{cite web|title=Bantustans |url=http://autocww2.colorado.edu/~blackmon/E64ContentFiles/AfricanHistory/Bantustans.html |publisher=Colorado.edu |accessdate=7 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203213119/http://autocww2.colorado.edu/~blackmon/E64ContentFiles/AfricanHistory/Bantustans.html |archivedate=3 December 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> However, some opportunities did exist for advancement for blacks and some advances in education and infrastructure were made.<ref>{{cite book|title=South Africa, the Prospects of Peaceful Change|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ugTO-eg84bcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=homeland&f=false|isbn = 0253353947|last1 = Hanf|first1 = Theodor|last2 = Weiland|first2 = Heribert|last3 = Vierdag|first3 = Gerda|year = 1981}}</ref>\n\nTheir single most important home-grown source of revenue was the provision of [[casino]]s and [[toplessness|topless]] revue shows, which the National Party government had prohibited in South Africa proper as being immoral. This provided a lucrative source of income for the South African elite, who constructed [[megaresort]]s such as [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]] in the homeland of [[Bophuthatswana]]. Bophuthatswana also possessed deposits of platinum, and other natural resources, which made it the wealthiest of the Bantustans.\n\nHowever, the homelands were only kept afloat by massive subsidies from the South African government; for instance, by 1985 in [[Transkei]], 85% of the homeland's income came from direct transfer payments from [[Pretoria]]. The Bantustans' governments were invariably corrupt and little wealth trickled down to the local populations, who were forced to seek employment as \"guest workers\" in South Africa proper. Millions of people had to work in often appalling conditions, away from their homes for months at a time. On the other hand, only 40% of Bophuthatswana's population worked outside the 'homeland' because the homeland was able to create industrial sites like Zone 15 and Babelegi.\n\nNot surprisingly, the homelands were extremely unpopular among the urban black population, many of whom lived in squalor in slum housing. Their working conditions were often equally poor, as they were denied any significant rights or protections in South Africa proper. The allocation of individuals to specific homelands was often quite arbitrary. Many individuals assigned to homelands did not live in or originate from the homelands to which they were assigned, and the division into designated ethnic groups often took place on an arbitrary basis, particularly in the case of people of mixed ethnic ancestry.\n\nBantustan leaders were widely perceived as collaborators with the Apartheid system, although some were successful in acquiring a following. Most homeland leaders had an ambivalent stance regarding the independence of their homelands: a majority was sceptical, remained cautious and avoided a definite decision, some outright rejected it due to their rejection of \"separate development\" and a professed commitment to \"opposing apartheid from within the system\", whilst others believed that nominal independence could serve to consolidate their power bases (to an even higher degree than the, in fact, already quite powerful status they enjoyed as rulers of self-governing homelands) and presented an opportunity to build a society relatively free from racial discrimination.<ref>{{cite book|title=South Africa: Time Running Out|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=sq43lnbklEUC&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn = 9780520045477|date = January 1981}}</ref> In general, the leaders of the Bantustans, despite their overall collaboration and often-times collusion with the apartheid regime, did not shy away from occasionally attacking the South African government's racial policies and calling for the repeal or softening of apartheid laws (most of which were repealed in nominally independent states). Various plans for a federal solution were at times mooted, both by the Bantustan governments and by opposition parties in South Africa as well as circles inside the white ruling National Party. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://psimg.jstor.org/fsi/img/pdf/t0/10.5555/al.sff.document.boo19840000.042.000_final.pdf |title=Survey of race relations in South Africa: 1983\n|publisher=[[South African Institute of Race Relations]]}}</ref>\n\n==Later developments==\nIn January 1985, State President [[P. W. Botha]] declared that blacks in South Africa proper would no longer be deprived of South African citizenship in favour of Bantustan citizenship and that black citizens within the independent Bantustans could reapply for South African citizenship; [[F. W. de Klerk]] stated on behalf of the National Party during the [[South African general election, 1987|1987 general election]] that \"every effort to turn the tide [of black workers] streaming into the urban areas failed. It does not help to bluff ourselves about this. The economy demands the permanent presence of the majority of blacks in urban areas ... They cannot stay in South Africa year after year without political representation.\"<ref>Gardner, John. ''Politicians and Apartheid: Trailing in the People's Wake''.

Sweden: Motala Grafiska. 1991. p. 6.</ref>\n\nThese remarks were however by no means meant as a rejection of the Bantustan system in general: the goal of the apartheid regime during the second half of the 1980s was to \"modernize\" the organisational framework of apartheid while leaving its fundamental principles (including the homelands) unchanged.\n\nThe government was forced to accept the permanent presence of blacks in urban areas as well as the practical unfeasibility of the hitherto very strict forms of \"influx control\" (replacing it by \"softer\" means of control), not to mention the impossibility of a total removal of all blacks to the homelands even in the long run. It was hoping to \"pacify\" the black urban population by developing various plans to confer upon them limited rights at the local level (but not the upper levels of government). Furthermore, the urban (and rural) residential areas remained segregated based on race in accordance with the [[Group Areas Act]].\n\n\"Separate development\" as a principle remained in force, and the apartheid regime went on to rely on the Bantustans as one of the main pillars of its policy in dealing with the black population. Until 1990, attempts continued to urge self-governing homelands to opt for independence (e.g. Lebowa, Gazankulu and KwaZulu) and on occasion the governments of self-governing homelands (e.g. KwaNdebele) themselves expressed interest in obtaining eventual independence.\n\nIt was also contemplated in circles of the ruling [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] to create additional nominally independent entities in the urban areas in the form of \"independent\" black \"city states\".\n\nThe long-term vision during this time was the creation of some form of a multi-racial \"confederation of South African states\" with a common citizenship, but separated into racially defined areas. Plans were made (of which only very few were realised) for the development of different \"joint\" institutions charged with mutual consultation, deliberation and a number of executive functions in relation to \"general affairs\" common to all population groups, insofar as these institutions would pose no threat to apartheid and the preservation of overall white rule. This \"confederation\" would include the so-called \"common area\" \u2014 meaning the bulk of South African territory outside of the homelands \u2014 under continued white-minority rule and limited power-sharing arrangements with the segregated [[Coloureds|Coloured]] and [[Indian South Africans|Indian]]/[[Asian South Africans|Asian]] population groups, the independent and self-governing homelands as well as possible additional black entities in urban areas.\n\nFrom 1990 to 1994 these \"confederational\" ideas were in principle still entertained by large parts of the National Party (and in various forms also by certain parties and groups of the white liberal opposition), but their overtly race-based foundations gradually became less pronounced in the course of the negotiations to end apartheid, and the focus shifted to securing \"minority rights\" (having in mind primarily the white population in particular) after an expected handover of power to the black majority. Federalist plans also met with support from some homeland governments and parties, most importantly the [[Inkatha Freedom Party]], which was the ruling party of KwaZulu. But since especially the [[African National Congress]] made it clear that the principles of \"one man - one vote\" and a unitary state were non-negotiable, (con-)federal schemes were eventually dropped. Because of this, the Inkatha Freedom Party threatened to boycott the [[1994 South African general election|April 1994 elections]] that ended apartheid and decided only in the last minute to participate in them after concessions had been made to them and as well as to the still ruling National Party and several white opposition groups.<ref>The most important concessions to Zulu separatist as well as white government and opposition forces were the [[wikisource:Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Amendment Act, No. 2 of 1994|Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Amendment Act, No. 2 of 1994]] and the [[wikisource:Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Second Amendment Act, No. 3 of 1994|Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Second Amendment Act, No. 3 of 1994]], which amended the [[wikisource:Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1993/1994-04-27|Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1993]] (the \"Interim Constitution\" which ended apartheid) already before this constitution came into force on 27 April 1994 (the first day of the first democratic elections). \n\nThe first amendment (promulgated on 3 March 1994) contained, ''inter alia'', the renaming of the Province of Natal to KwaZulu/Natal (nowadays written with a hyphen instead of a slash), an extension of the powers of the provinces vis-\u00e0-vis the national government and also intended to satisfy the demands of segments of the white (especially Afrikaans-speaking) population by establishing a 20-member \"Volkstaat Council\" to look into the possibility of creating a \"Volkstaat\" as an autonomous territory for Afrikaans speakers.\n\nThe second amendment (promulgated on 26 April 1994, only hours before the constitution abolishing apartheid came into force and the elections began) was part of the deal arranged at the last minute to ensure the participation of the [[Inkatha Freedom Party]] in the elections; it modified the future constitution to ensure a special status for the [[List of Zulu kings|Zulu Monarch]] in [[KwaZulu-Natal]] province and, in general, provided for the institution, role, authority and status of traditional monarchs in provincial constitutions.</ref>\n\nIn the period leading up to the elections in 1994, several leaders in the independent and self-governing homelands (e.g. in [[1994 Bophuthatswana crisis|Boputhatswana]]), who did not wish to relinquish their power, vehemently opposed the dismantling of the Bantustans and, in doing so, received support from white far-right parties, sections of the apartheid state apparatus and radical pro-apartheid groups like the [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]].\n\n==Dissolution==\nWith the demise of the apartheid regime in South Africa in 1994, all Bantustans (both nominally independent and self-governing) were dismantled and their territories reincorporated into the Republic of South Africa with effect from 27 April 1994 (the day on which the Interim Constitution, which formally ended apartheid, came into force and the [[1994 South African general election|first democratic elections]] began) in terms of [[wikisource:Constitution_of_the_Republic_of_South_Africa,_1993/1994-04-27/Chapter_1|section 1(2)]] and [[wikisource:Constitution_of_the_Republic_of_South_Africa,_1993/1994-04-27/Schedule_1|Schedule 1]] of the [[Interim Constitution (South Africa)|Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1993]] (\"Interim Constitution\").<ref>Act to introduce a new Constitution for the Republic of South Africa and to provide for matters incidental thereto (Act No. 200 of 1993), as amended before coming into force by the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Amendment Act, No. 2 of 1994 and the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Second Amendment Act, No. 3 of 1994, text available online at [[Wikisource:Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1993/1994-04-27|Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1993 as of 27 April 1994]]</ref>\n\nThe drive to achieve this was spearheaded by the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) as a central element of its programme of reform. Reincorporation was mostly achieved peacefully, although there was some resistance from the local elites, who stood to lose out on the opportunities for wealth and political power provided by the homelands. The dismantling of the homelands of Bophuthatswana and Ciskei was particularly difficult. In Ciskei, South African security forces had to intervene in March 1994 to defuse a political crisis.\n\nFrom 1994, most parts of the country were constitutionally redivided into new [[Provinces of South Africa|provinces]].\n\nNevertheless, many leaders of former Bantustans or Homelands have had a role in South African politics since their abolition. Some had entered their own parties into the [[1994 South African general election|first non-racial election]] while others joined the ANC. [[Mangosuthu Buthelezi]] was chief minister of his [[KwaZulu]] homeland from 1976 until 1994. In post-apartheid South Africa he has served as president of the [[Inkatha Freedom Party]] and Minister of Home Affairs. [[Bantubonke Holomisa]], who was a general in the homeland of Transkei from 1987, has served as the president of the [[United Democratic Movement]] since 1997. General [[Constand Viljoen]], an Afrikaner who served as chief of the [[South African Defence Force]], sent 1,500 of his militiamen to protect [[Lucas Mangope]] and to contest the termination of [[Bophuthatswana]] as a homeland in 1994. He founded the [[Freedom Front]] in 1994. Lucas Mangope, former chief of the Motsweda Ba hurutshe-Boo-Manyane tribe of the Tswana and head of Bophuthatswana is president of the [[United Christian Democratic Party]], effectively a continuation of the ruling party of the homeland. [[Oupa Gqozo]], the last ruler of [[Ciskei]], entered his [[African Democratic Movement]] in the 1994 elections but was unsuccessful. The [[Dikwankwetla Party]], which ruled [[Qwaqwa]], remains a force in the [[Maluti-a-Phofung Local Municipality|Maluti a Phofung]] council where it is the largest opposition party. The [[Ximoko Party]], which ruled Gazankulu, has a presence in local government in [[Giyani]]. Similarly, the former [[KwaNdebele]] chief minister George Mahlangu and others formed the [[Sindawonye Progressive Party]] which is one of the major opposition parties in [[Thembisile Hani Local Municipality]] and [[Dr JS Moroka Local Municipality]] (encompassing the territory of the former homeland).\n\n==List of Bantustans==\n===Bantustans in South Africa===\n\n[[File:Bantustans in South Africa.svg|thumb|300px|right|Map of the black homelands in South Africa at the end of apartheid in 1994]]\nThe homelands are listed below with the ethnic group for which each homeland was designated.

The Government established ten Bantustans in South Africa, and ten in neighbouring South West Africa (then under South African administration), for the purpose of concentrating the members of designated ethnic groups, thus making each of those territories ethnically homogeneous as the basis for creating 'autonomous' nation states for South Africa's different [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|black ethnic groups]]. Under the [[Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act]] of 1970, the Government stripped black South Africans of their citizenship, which deprived them of their few remaining political and civil rights in South Africa, and declared them to be citizens of these  homelands.<ref name=\"britannica\">[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Bantustan]</ref>\n\nThe term was first used in the late 1940s and was coined from Bantu (meaning ''people'' in some of the [[Bantu languages]]) and ''[[-stan]]'' (a suffix meaning ''[[Homeland|land]]'' in the [[Persian language]] and some Persian-influenced languages of [[Western Asia|western]], [[Central Asia|central]], and [[South Asia|southern Asia]]). It was regarded as a disparaging term by some critics of the apartheid-era government's ''homelands''. The word ''bantustan'', today, is often used in a [[pejorative]] sense when describing a region that lacks any real legitimacy, consists of several unconnected enclaves, or emerges from national or international [[gerrymandering]].{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe Government of South Africa declared as independent four of the South African Bantustans\u2014[[Transkei]], [[Bophuthatswana]], [[Venda]], and [[Ciskei]] (the so-called \"TBVC States\"), but this declaration was never recognised by [[Anti-Apartheid Movement|anti-apartheid forces]] in South Africa or by any international government. Other Bantustans (like [[KwaZulu]], [[Lebowa]], and [[QwaQwa]]) were assigned 'autonomy' but never granted 'independence'. In South West Africa, [[Ovamboland]], [[Kavangoland]], and [[East Caprivi]] were declared to be self-determining. The Bantustans were abolished with the end of apartheid in South Africa in 1994.\n\n== Creation ==\n[[File:South Africa racial map, 1979.gif|right|thumb|350px|Racial-demographic map of South Africa published by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] in 1979 with data from the 1970 South African census]]\nBritish colonial administrations in the 19th century, and subsequent South African governments, had established \"reserves\" in 1913 and 1936, with the intention of segregating black South Africans from whites. When the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] came to power in 1948, Minister for Native Affairs (and later [[Prime Minister of South Africa]]) [[Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd]] built on this, introducing a series of measures that reshaped South African society such that whites would be the demographic majority. The creation of the homelands or Bantustans was a central element of this strategy, as the long-term goal was to make the Bantustans independent. As a result, blacks would lose their South African citizenship and voting rights, allowing whites to remain in control of South Africa.\n\n[[File:South_Africa_%26_South_West_Africa_Bantustans_Map.svg|right|thumb|350px|Map of South Africa and South West Africa (now Namibia). This map shows the Bantustans that were present in both countries.]]\n\"The term 'Bantustan' was used by apartheid's apologists in reference to the [[partition of India]] in 1947. However, it quickly became pejorative in left and anti-apartheid usage, where it remained, while being abandoned by the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] in favour of 'homelands'.\"<ref>Susan Mathieson and David Atwell, \"Between Ethnicity and Nationhood: Shaka Day and the Struggle over Zuluness in post-Apartheid South Africa\" in ''Multicultural States: Rethinking Difference and Identity'' edited by David Bennett {{ISBN|0-415-12159-0}} (Routledge UK, 1998) p.122</ref>\n\n\"While apartheid was an ideology born of the will to survive or, put differently, the fear of extinction, Afrikaner leaders differed on how best to implement it. While some were satisfied with segregationist policies placing them at the top of a social and economic hierarchy, others truly believed in the concept of 'separate but equal'. For the latter, the ideological justification for the classification, segregation, and denial of political rights was the plan to set aside special land reserves for black South Africans, later called 'bantustans' or 'homelands'. Each ethnic group would have its own state with its own political system and economy, and each would rely on its own labour force. These independent states would then coexist alongside white South Africa in a spirit of friendship and collaboration. In their own areas, black citizens would enjoy full rights.\"<ref>Norman, Kajsa.

Page 106.</ref>\n\nVerwoerd argued that the Bantustans were the \"original homes\" of the black peoples of South Africa. In 1951, the government of [[Daniel Fran\u00e7ois Malan]] introduced the [[Bantu Authorities Act]] to establish \"homelands\" allocated to the country's black ethnic groups. These amounted to 13% of the country's land, the remainder being reserved for the white population. The homelands were run by cooperative tribal leaders, while uncooperative chiefs were forcibly deposed. Over time, a ruling black elite emerged with a personal and financial interest in the preservation of the homelands. While this aided the homelands' political stability to an extent, their position was still entirely dependent on South African support.\n\nThe role of the homelands was expanded in 1959 with the passage of the [[Bantu Self-Government Act]], which set out a plan called \"[[Separate Development]]\". This enabled the homelands to establish themselves in the long term as self-governing territories and ultimately as nominally fully \"independent\" states.\n\nThis process was to be achieved in a series of four major steps for each homeland:\n\n* The unification of the reserves set aside for the various \"tribes\" (officially called \"nations\" since 1959) under a single \"Territorial Authority\"\n* The establishment of a legislative assembly for each homeland with limited powers of self-rule\n* The establishment of the homeland as a \"self-governing territory\"\n* The granting of full nominal independence to the homeland\n\nThis general framework was not in each case followed in a clear-cut way, but often with a number of intermediate and overlapping steps.\n\nThe homeland of [[Transkei]] served in many regards as a \"testing ground\" for apartheid policies; its institutional development started already before the 1959 act, and its attainment of self-government and independence were therefore implemented earlier than for the other homelands.\n\nThis plan was stepped up under Verwoerd's successor as prime minister, [[John Vorster]], as part of his \"enlightened\" approach to apartheid. However, the true intention of this policy was to fulfill Verwoerd's original plan to make South Africa's blacks nationals of the homelands rather than of South Africa\u2014thus removing the few rights they still had as citizens. The homelands were encouraged to opt for independence, as this would greatly reduce the number of black citizens of South Africa. The process of creating the legal framework for this plan was completed by the [[Black Homelands Citizenship Act]] of 1970, which formally designated all black South Africans as citizens of the homelands, even if they lived in \"white South Africa\", and cancelled their South African citizenship, and the [[Bantu Homelands Constitution Act, 1971|Bantu Homelands Constitution Act]] of 1971, which provided a general blueprint for the stages of constitutional development of all homelands (except Transkei) from the establishment of Territorial Authorities up to full independence.\n\nBy 1984, all ten homelands in South Africa had attained self-government and four of them ([[Transkei]], [[Bophuthatswana|Boputhatswana]], [[Venda]] and [[Ciskei]]) had been declared fully independent between 1976 and 1981.\n\nThe following table shows the time-frame of the institutional and legal development of the ten South African Bantustans in light of the above-mentioned four major steps:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+\n!Homeland\n!Tribe/Nation\n!Establishment of a unified territorial authority\n!Establishment of a legislative assembly\n!Self-Government\n!Nominal independence\n!Notes\n|-\n|{{Flag|Transkei}}\n|[[Xhosa people|Xhosa]]\n|1956<ref>The Transkeian Territorial Authority was established to replace the United Transkeian Territories General Council, by Proclamation No. R.180 in SA Government Gazette No. 5736 of 31 August 1956 with effect from 1 September 1956.</ref>\n|1963<ref name=\":3\">The Transkei was granted self-government by the Transkei Constitution Act 48 of 1963.

It has been estimated that 3.5 million people were forced from their homes from the 1960s through the 1980s, many being resettled in the Bantustans.\n\nThe government made clear that its ultimate aim was the total removal of the black population from South Africa. [[Connie Mulder]], the Minister of Plural Relations and Development, told the [[House of Assembly]] on 7 February 1978:\n\n{{quote|sign=|If our policy is taken to its logical conclusion as far as the black people are concerned, there will be not one black man with South African citizenship ...

In theory, self-governing Bantustans had control over many aspects of their internal functioning but were not yet sovereign nations. Independent Bantustans (Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei; also known as the TBVC states) were intended to be fully sovereign. In reality, they had little economic infrastructure worth mentioning and, with few exceptions, encompassed swaths of disconnected territory. This meant that the Bantustans were little more than puppet states controlled by South Africa.\n\nThroughout the existence of the \"independent\" Bantustans, South Africa remained the only country to recognise their independence. The South African government, lobbied for their recognition. In 1976, leading up to a [[United States House of Representatives]] resolution urging the President not to recognise Transkei, the South African government intensely lobbied lawmakers to oppose the bill.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pitterman |first=Shelly |authorlink= |title=A Fine Face for Apartheid |work=Southern Africa Perspectives |publisher= |date= |url=http://kora.matrix.msu.edu/files/50/304/32-130-E84-84-al.sff.document.af000020.pdf |format= |doi= |accessdate= }}</ref> Arbitrary and unrecognized [[Amateur radio call signs]] were created for the \"independent\" states and [[QSL cards]] were sent by operators using them, but the [[International Telecommunications Union]] never accepted these stations as legitimate.<ref>[http://lesnouvellesdx.fr/galerie/galerie2.php?page=moreqsl&pfx=S8  S8 - Transkei(Entit\u00e9 DXCC ayant chang\u00e9 de pr\u00e9fixe)]</ref> Each TBVC state extended recognition to the other independent Bantustans while South Africa showed its commitment to the notion of TBVC sovereignty by building embassies in the TBVC capitals.\n\n==Life in the Bantustans==\nThe Bantustans were generally poor, with few local employment opportunities.<ref name=\"Colorado Bantustans\">{{cite web|title=Bantustans |url=http://autocww2.colorado.edu/~blackmon/E64ContentFiles/AfricanHistory/Bantustans.html |publisher=Colorado.edu |accessdate=7 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203213119/http://autocww2.colorado.edu/~blackmon/E64ContentFiles/AfricanHistory/Bantustans.html |archivedate=3 December 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref> However, some opportunities did exist for advancement for blacks and some advances in education and infrastructure were made.<ref>{{cite book|title=South Africa, the Prospects of Peaceful Change|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ugTO-eg84bcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=homeland&f=false|isbn = 0253353947|last1 = Hanf|first1 = Theodor|last2 = Weiland|first2 = Heribert|last3 = Vierdag|first3 = Gerda|year = 1981}}</ref>\n\nTheir single most important home-grown source of revenue was the provision of [[casino]]s and [[toplessness|topless]] revue shows, which the National Party government had prohibited in South Africa proper as being immoral. This provided a lucrative source of income for the South African elite, who constructed [[megaresort]]s such as [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]] in the homeland of [[Bophuthatswana]]. Bophuthatswana also possessed deposits of platinum, and other natural resources, which made it the wealthiest of the Bantustans.\n\nHowever, the homelands were only kept afloat by massive subsidies from the South African government; for instance, by 1985 in [[Transkei]], 85% of the homeland's income came from direct transfer payments from [[Pretoria]]. The Bantustans' governments were invariably corrupt and little wealth trickled down to the local populations, who were forced to seek employment as \"guest workers\" in South Africa proper. Millions of people had to work in often appalling conditions, away from their homes for months at a time. On the other hand, only 40% of Bophuthatswana's population worked outside the 'homeland' because the homeland was able to create industrial sites like Zone 15 and Babelegi.\n\nNot surprisingly, the homelands were extremely unpopular among the urban black population, many of whom lived in squalor in slum housing. Their working conditions were often equally poor, as they were denied any significant rights or protections in South Africa proper. The allocation of individuals to specific homelands was often quite arbitrary. Many individuals assigned to homelands did not live in or originate from the homelands to which they were assigned, and the division into designated ethnic groups often took place on an arbitrary basis, particularly in the case of people of mixed ethnic ancestry.\n\nBantustan leaders were widely perceived as collaborators with the Apartheid system, although some were successful in acquiring a following. Most homeland leaders had an ambivalent stance regarding the independence of their homelands: a majority was sceptical, remained cautious and avoided a definite decision, some outright rejected it due to their rejection of \"separate development\" and a professed commitment to \"opposing apartheid from within the system\", whilst others believed that nominal independence could serve to consolidate their power bases (to an even higher degree than the, in fact, already quite powerful status they enjoyed as rulers of self-governing homelands) and presented an opportunity to build a society relatively free from racial discrimination.<ref>{{cite book|title=South Africa: Time Running Out|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=sq43lnbklEUC&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn = 9780520045477|date = January 1981}}</ref> In general, the leaders of the Bantustans, despite their overall collaboration and often-times collusion with the apartheid regime, did not shy away from occasionally attacking the South African government's racial policies and calling for the repeal or softening of apartheid laws (most of which were repealed in nominally independent states).

W. de Klerk]] stated on behalf of the National Party during the [[South African general election, 1987|1987 general election]] that \"every effort to turn the tide [of black workers] streaming into the urban areas failed.

Sweden: Motala Grafiska. 1991. p. 6.</ref>\n\nThese remarks were however by no means meant as a rejection of the Bantustan system in general: the goal of the apartheid regime during the second half of the 1980s was to \"modernize\" the organisational framework of apartheid while leaving its fundamental principles (including the homelands) unchanged.\n\nThe government was forced to accept the permanent presence of blacks in urban areas as well as the practical unfeasibility of the hitherto very strict forms of \"influx control\" (replacing it by \"softer\" means of control), not to mention the impossibility of a total removal of all blacks to the homelands even in the long run. It was hoping to \"pacify\" the black urban population by developing various plans to confer upon them limited rights at the local level (but not the upper levels of government). Furthermore, the urban (and rural) residential areas remained segregated based on race in accordance with the [[Group Areas Act]].\n\n\"Separate development\" as a principle remained in force, and the apartheid regime went on to rely on the Bantustans as one of the main pillars of its policy in dealing with the black population. Until 1990, attempts continued to urge self-governing homelands to opt for independence (e.g. Lebowa, Gazankulu and KwaZulu) and on occasion the governments of self-governing homelands (e.g. KwaNdebele) themselves expressed interest in obtaining eventual independence.\n\nIt was also contemplated in circles of the ruling [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] to create additional nominally independent entities in the urban areas in the form of \"independent\" black \"city states\".\n\nThe long-term vision during this time was the creation of some form of a multi-racial \"confederation of South African states\" with a common citizenship, but separated into racially defined areas. Plans were made (of which only very few were realised) for the development of different \"joint\" institutions charged with mutual consultation, deliberation and a number of executive functions in relation to \"general affairs\" common to all population groups, insofar as these institutions would pose no threat to apartheid and the preservation of overall white rule. This \"confederation\" would include the so-called \"common area\" \u2014 meaning the bulk of South African territory outside of the homelands \u2014 under continued white-minority rule and limited power-sharing arrangements with the segregated [[Coloureds|Coloured]] and [[Indian South Africans|Indian]]/[[Asian South Africans|Asian]] population groups, the independent and self-governing homelands as well as possible additional black entities in urban areas.\n\nFrom 1990 to 1994 these \"confederational\" ideas were in principle still entertained by large parts of the National Party (and in various forms also by certain parties and groups of the white liberal opposition), but their overtly race-based foundations gradually became less pronounced in the course of the negotiations to end apartheid, and the focus shifted to securing \"minority rights\" (having in mind primarily the white population in particular) after an expected handover of power to the black majority. Federalist plans also met with support from some homeland governments and parties, most importantly the [[Inkatha Freedom Party]], which was the ruling party of KwaZulu. But since especially the [[African National Congress]] made it clear that the principles of \"one man - one vote\" and a unitary state were non-negotiable, (con-)federal schemes were eventually dropped. Because of this, the Inkatha Freedom Party threatened to boycott the [[1994 South African general election|April 1994 elections]] that ended apartheid and decided only in the last minute to participate in them after concessions had been made to them and as well as to the still ruling National Party and several white opposition groups.<ref>The most important concessions to Zulu separatist as well as white government and opposition forces were the [[wikisource:Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Amendment Act, No. 2 of 1994|Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Amendment Act, No. 2 of 1994]] and the [[wikisource:Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Second Amendment Act, No. 3 of 1994|Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Second Amendment Act, No. 3 of 1994]], which amended the [[wikisource:Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1993/1994-04-27|Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1993]] (the \"Interim Constitution\" which ended apartheid) already before this constitution came into force on 27 April 1994 (the first day of the first democratic elections). \n\nThe first amendment (promulgated on 3 March 1994) contained, ''inter alia'', the renaming of the Province of Natal to KwaZulu/Natal (nowadays written with a hyphen instead of a slash), an extension of the powers of the provinces vis-\u00e0-vis the national government and also intended to satisfy the demands of segments of the white (especially Afrikaans-speaking) population by establishing a 20-member \"Volkstaat Council\" to look into the possibility of creating a \"Volkstaat\" as an autonomous territory for Afrikaans speakers.\n\nThe second amendment (promulgated on 26 April 1994, only hours before the constitution abolishing apartheid came into force and the elections began) was part of the deal arranged at the last minute to ensure the participation of the [[Inkatha Freedom Party]] in the elections; it modified the future constitution to ensure a special status for the [[List of Zulu kings|Zulu Monarch]] in [[KwaZulu-Natal]] province and, in general, provided for the institution, role, authority and status of traditional monarchs in provincial constitutions.</ref>\n\nIn the period leading up to the elections in 1994, several leaders in the independent and self-governing homelands (e.g. in [[1994 Bophuthatswana crisis|Boputhatswana]]), who did not wish to relinquish their power, vehemently opposed the dismantling of the Bantustans and, in doing so, received support from white far-right parties, sections of the apartheid state apparatus and radical pro-apartheid groups like the [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]].\n\n==Dissolution==\nWith the demise of the apartheid regime in South Africa in 1994, all Bantustans (both nominally independent and self-governing) were dismantled and their territories reincorporated into the Republic of South Africa with effect from 27 April 1994 (the day on which the Interim Constitution, which formally ended apartheid, came into force and the [[1994 South African general election|first democratic elections]] began) in terms of [[wikisource:Constitution_of_the_Republic_of_South_Africa,_1993/1994-04-27/Chapter_1|section 1(2)]] and [[wikisource:Constitution_of_the_Republic_of_South_Africa,_1993/1994-04-27/Schedule_1|Schedule 1]] of the [[Interim Constitution (South Africa)|Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1993]] (\"Interim Constitution\").<ref>Act to introduce a new Constitution for the Republic of South Africa and to provide for matters incidental thereto (Act No. 200 of 1993), as amended before coming into force by the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Amendment Act, No. 2 of 1994 and the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Second Amendment Act, No. 3 of 1994, text available online at [[Wikisource:Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1993/1994-04-27|Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1993 as of 27 April 1994]]</ref>\n\nThe drive to achieve this was spearheaded by the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) as a central element of its programme of reform. Reincorporation was mostly achieved peacefully, although there was some resistance from the local elites, who stood to lose out on the opportunities for wealth and political power provided by the homelands. The dismantling of the homelands of Bophuthatswana and Ciskei was particularly difficult. In Ciskei, South African security forces had to intervene in March 1994 to defuse a political crisis.\n\nFrom 1994, most parts of the country were constitutionally redivided into new [[Provinces of South Africa|provinces]].\n\nNevertheless, many leaders of former Bantustans or Homelands have had a role in South African politics since their abolition. Some had entered their own parties into the [[1994 South African general election|first non-racial election]] while others joined the ANC. [[Mangosuthu Buthelezi]] was chief minister of his [[KwaZulu]] homeland from 1976 until 1994. In post-apartheid South Africa he has served as president of the [[Inkatha Freedom Party]] and Minister of Home Affairs. [[Bantubonke Holomisa]], who was a general in the homeland of Transkei from 1987, has served as the president of the [[United Democratic Movement]] since 1997. General [[Constand Viljoen]], an Afrikaner who served as chief of the [[South African Defence Force]], sent 1,500 of his militiamen to protect [[Lucas Mangope]] and to contest the termination of [[Bophuthatswana]] as a homeland in 1994. He founded the [[Freedom Front]] in 1994. Lucas Mangope, former chief of the Motsweda Ba hurutshe-Boo-Manyane tribe of the Tswana and head of Bophuthatswana is president of the [[United Christian Democratic Party]], effectively a continuation of the ruling party of the homeland. [[Oupa Gqozo]], the last ruler of [[Ciskei]], entered his [[African Democratic Movement]] in the 1994 elections but was unsuccessful. The [[Dikwankwetla Party]], which ruled [[Qwaqwa]], remains a force in the [[Maluti-a-Phofung Local Municipality|Maluti a Phofung]] council where it is the largest opposition party. The [[Ximoko Party]], which ruled Gazankulu, has a presence in local government in [[Giyani]]. Similarly, the former [[KwaNdebele]] chief minister George Mahlangu and others formed the [[Sindawonye Progressive Party]] which is one of the major opposition parties in [[Thembisile Hani Local Municipality]] and [[Dr JS Moroka Local Municipality]] (encompassing the territory of the former homeland).\n\n==List of Bantustans==\n===Bantustans in South Africa===\n\n[[File:Bantustans in South Africa.svg|thumb|300px|right|Map of the black homelands in South Africa at the end of apartheid in 1994]]\nThe homelands are listed below with the ethnic group for which each homeland was designated.
