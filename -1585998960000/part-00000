Founded by [[Paul Waaktaar-Savoy]] (guitars), [[Magne Furuholmen]] (keyboards, guitars), and [[Morten Harket]] (vocals), the band rose to fame during the mid-1980s and continued its global success in the 1990s and the 21st century.\n\nA-ha achieved their biggest success with their debut album ''[[Hunting High and Low]]'' in 1985. That album peaked at number one in their native country Norway, number 2 in the UK, and number 15 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' album chart; yielded two international number-one singles: \"[[Take On Me]]\" and \"[[The Sun Always Shines on T.V.]]\"; and earned the band a [[Grammy Award]] nomination as Best New Artist.

John Ratcliff introduced them to his manager, <span class=\"plainlinks\">[http://a-ha.com/the-band/the-story-so-far/chapter-11/ Terry Slater]</span>, and after a few meetings, A-ha enlisted Ratcliff as a manager as well. Slater and Ratcliff formed TJ Management. Ratcliff dealt with technical and musical aspects and Slater acted as the group's international business manager and as liaison to Warner Brothers' head office in Los Angeles.\n\n===''Hunting High and Low'' (1984\u20131986)===\nAn early version of \"[[Take On Me]]\" was the first song that Morten Harket had heard Magne Furuholmen and P\u00e5l Waaktaar play in [[Asker]]. At that time, the song was called \"Miss Eerie\", and the two men were still known as [[Bridges (band)|Bridges]]. Morten stated it sounded more like a \" Juicy fruit song \" for a gum advert -  It was renamed \"Lesson One\" when it was first recorded by A-ha. After some re-writing, multiple re-recordings, and three releases, \"Take On Me\" became a hit on both sides of the Atlantic in 1985. The first version of the song, released in 1984, was promoted by a video of the band performing the song in front of a blue background. The song was then re-recorded with production by Alan Tarney, but this new release failed to chart. The song was re-released with a new, groundbreaking video; this time, the song peaked at number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"US Singles-positions for A-ha\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/a-ha-p3491/charts-awards/billboard-singles| title=Allmusic: A-ha (Singles)|website=[[AllMusic]]| accessdate=25 March 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"UK\" /> A-ha became the first Norwegian band to have a number one hit in the U.S. The popularity of \"Take on Me\" earned the band a spot on the American television series ''[[Soul Train]]'' in 1985, making them one of the few white artists to appear on the black music-oriented show. (Gino Vanelli, Elton John, David Bowie, Hall & Oates, Sheena Easton, and Teena Marie all had performed on ''Soul Train'' prior to A-ha's 1985 performance.)\n\nThe video used a pencil-sketch animation/live-action combination called [[Rotoscope|rotoscoping]], in which individual frames of live video are drawn over or coloured.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.muchmusic.com/archives/2008/02/video_spotlight_4.php |title=Much Music Retro Video Spotlight |work=Much Music |accessdate=13 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420081935/http://blog.muchmusic.com/archives/2008/02/video_spotlight_4.php |archivedate=20 April 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It became one of the most instantly recognisable and most enduringly popular music videos in the US where it was nominated for eight awards at the third annual [[MTV Video Awards]] in 1986, winning six, including Best New Artist in a Video, Best Concept Video, Best Direction, Best Special Effects, and Viewer's Choice and Best Video of the Year. Their six MTV Award wins for that video gave them twice as many wins as [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]\" and more than any artist in the three years of the awards combined.\n\nThe band's second single worldwide was \"[[The Sun Always Shines on T.V.]]\", even though \"Love is Reason\" was the 2nd single in Norway. In the US the song peaked at number 20 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and reached number 17 on [[Radio & Records]] airplay chart. A remix version was a club hit, rising to number 5 on the [[Hot Dance Singles Sales]] chart.<ref name=\"US Singles-positions for A-ha\"/> The music video for the song was another popular and critical success, nominated in three categories at the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards and winning two, Best Cinematography and Best Editing, bringing A-ha's total to 11 nominations and eight wins. The following year, [[Peter Gabriel]] would earn 13 nominations and win nine awards, also for two separate videos. In successive years, even as the award categories expanded, only a few artists have approached\u2014and none have surpassed the single-year award totals of A-ha and Gabriel.\n\nA-ha's American success culminated in their 1986 [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination in the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] category, which was eventually won by [[Sade (band)|Sade]]. \"The Sun Always Shines on TV\" turned out to be A-ha's last Hot 100 [[Top 40]] single, and to this day in the United States, A-ha is remembered by the general public almost entirely because of their number one hit single, \"Take On Me\".<ref name=\"US Singles-positions for A-ha\"/> As such, the band is frequently considered a [[one-hit wonder]] there, despite their two Top 40 hits. In the UK, however, the story was very different: \"The Sun Always Shines on TV\" became their only number 1 there.<ref name=\"UK\" /> In the UK, A-ha enjoyed continued success with two more hit singles from the same album\u2014\"Train of Thought\" and \"Hunting High and Low\" (with another innovative video) \u2014and the band remained popular throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nThe band's first album, 1985's ''[[Hunting High and Low]]'', became a worldwide bestseller, spending most of October and November in the top 20 of [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s Top 200 album chart.

Despite the commercial reception, [[Q (magazine)|''Q'' magazine]] listed the album as one of the 50 best albums of 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/qlists.html#1993 |title=Rocklist.net...Q magazine Recordings Of The Year |website=Rocklistmusic.co.uk |date= |accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> The following February, A-ha performed two concerts during the [[1994 Winter Olympics]] in [[Lillehammer]], Norway, followed by tours of South Africa and Norway. A-ha were also chosen to compose the official song for the Winter [[Paralympic Games]] in Lillehammer, which they entitled \"Shapes That Go Together\".\n\nIn 1994, the band unofficially entered a hiatus, and band members then focused on solo projects.<ref name=\"A-ha to break up after 25 years\"/>\n\n===First comeback (1998\u20132007)===\n[[File:A-ha all1.jpg|thumb|right|A-ha live at Cologne, 29 October 2005]]\nThe band was invited to perform at the [[Nobel Peace Prize Concert]] in 1998. Paul wrote \"[[Summer Moved On]]\" especially for this performance.<ref>interview on \"A-ha live at valhall homecoming\" DVD, 2001</ref> They also performed \"The Sun Always Shines on TV\". This performance was A-ha's comeback into the world of music, yet the band's set was controversially omitted from a programme of highlights of that concert that was televised in the UK, and even more controversially in the US by [[FOX]]. Nevertheless, the band returned to the studio. Those recording sessions resulted in 2000's ''[[Minor Earth Major Sky]]'', an international tour, and a webcast performance of the band opening the new [[Coca Cola Vallhall Arena|Vallhall Arena]] in Oslo on the 24 and 25 March 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://a-ha.com/news/articles/a-ha-concert-in-oslo-will-be-live-on-the-internet |title=Archived copy |accessdate=21 August 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008140307/http://a-ha.com/news/articles/a-ha-concert-in-oslo-will-be-live-on-the-internet/ |archivedate=8 October 2016 |df=dmy }} News item announcing the webcast.</ref> A-ha's video for \"I Wish I Cared\" was one of the first fully web-based animated flash music videos to be made available. (The first was Duran Duran's flash video for the 2000 song \"Someone Else Not Me\".{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}) The album reached platinum status, with sales of 1.5 million copies, and spawned four singles: \"Summer Moved On\", \"Minor Earth Major Sky\", \"Velvet\" and \"The Sun Never Shone That Day\". \"Summer Moved On\" went to No.&nbsp;1 in 17 countries.\n\nA-ha made a return appearance at the [[Nobel Peace Prize Concert]] in 2001, performing a new song, Differences, and [[Hunting High and Low (A-ha song)|Hunting High and Low]]. The subsequent album, ''[[Lifelines (A-ha album)|Lifelines]]'', was released in 2002, going platinum in Norway and producing two top 5 hits there, \"[[Forever Not Yours]]\" and \"[[Lifelines (song)|Lifelines]]\". Jesper Hiro directed the video for \"Lifelines\", based on the short film ''[[A Year Along the Abandoned Road]]'', which was directed by Morten Skallerud in 1991. The original short film was 12 minutes long; it shows a whole year passing by in one shot at 50,000 times the normal speed.\n\nA live album from their 2002 tour, titled ''[[How Can I Sleep with Your Voice in My Head]]'', was released in March 2003, preceded by a live single of the 1986 hit \"The Sun Always Shines on TV.\" In 2004, a book entitled \"The Swing of Things\" was published, which also featured a CD of early demo material. That year A-ha celebrated their 20th anniversary with the release of a new singles collection, ''[[The Definitive Singles Collection 1984\u20132004]]''. This compilation brought them back into the UK Top 20 Album Charts, where they reached number 13 and earned a [[Music recording certification|Gold album]].\n\nOn 2 July 2005, A-ha performed at the Berlin edition of [[Live 8]], in front of an audience of nearly 200,000 people. They began with \"Hunting High and Low\", followed by \"Take On Me\", during which [[Morten Harket]] had difficulties hearing himself when his [[in-ear monitor]] failed: he requested a two-minute break, which he used to comment on the cause of Live 8. The intended two minutes became almost seven, and the third song, \"Summer Moved On,\" became the last of their set. Although four songs had been rehearsed, the band's time had run out and the organisers told them to leave the stage.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n[[File:A-ha Morten2.jpg|thumb|left|Lead vocalist [[Morten Harket]] live at Cologne, 29 October 2005]]\nOn 12 September 2005, A-ha played a quickly sold-out show at [[Irving Plaza]] in New York City, the band's first concert in North America since 1986 despite not having released any material there since 1993. On 27 August 2005, the band played a concert for 120,000 people in [[Frogner Park]] in Oslo, the largest concert ever in Norway.\n\nOn 4 November 2005, the band released its eighth studio album, ''[[Analogue (album)|Analogue]]''. The UK release of the single \"[[Analogue (All I Want)|Analogue]]\" gave A-ha their first top 10 hit in the UK since 1988.<ref name=\"UK\" /> The album includes a guest appearance by [[Graham Nash]] of [[Crosby Stills & Nash]] performing backup vocals on the songs \"Over the Treetops\" and \"Cosy Prisons\". The song \"[[Celice (song)|Celice]]\" became the band's ninth to go No.&nbsp;1 on a major national chart, and its music video sparked criticism for its sexual content. The following tour included a gig at London's Shepherd's Bush in February 2006, along with a TV special in Africa. In 2006, A-ha recorded a cover of [[John Lennon]]'s \"[[No.&nbsp;9 Dream]]\" for [[Amnesty International]]. It was released in June 2007 on the album \"[[Make Some Noise (campaign)|Make Some Noise]]\". On 30 October 2006 in London, A-ha received the prestigious [[Q (magazine)|''Q'' Magazine]] Inspiration Award for their long contribution to music and for inspiring many of their younger colleagues in the business.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} On 15 September 2007, A-ha played a free outdoor concert in Kiel, Germany. The band played on a floating stage in the harbour. This concert was streamed live on the internet via [[MSN]].\n\nOn 24 January 2009, 25 years after its first release, A-ha won the Norwegian Spellemann award for Hit of All Time for \"[[Take On Me]]\" on the 50th anniversary of the official hit list in Norway.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n===New direction and farewell (2008\u20132010)===\nOn 20\u201322 May 2008, [[Morten Harket]], [[Magne Furuholmen]] and [[Paul Waaktaar-Savoy|P\u00e5l Waaktaar-Savoy]] performed concerts in [[Oslo]], Norway, to promote their respective solo material before coming together as A-ha to play \"[[Train of Thought (A-ha song)|Train of Thought]]\", \"[[Take On Me]]\", and two new songs, \"Riding the Crest\" and \"Shadowside\", which previewed the new A-ha album, ''[[Foot of the Mountain]]''. These events led up to their performance at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]] on 24 May.\n\nOn 24 April 2009, A-ha surprised their fan base by releasing their new single, \"Foot of the Mountain\", premiering that day on Norwegian radio. The single had been completed only the night before. The song is based upon the track \"The Longest Night\" by Magne Furuholmen, which was released on his album ''[[A Dot of Black in the Blue of Your Bliss]]''. The single was released on 22 May in Germany. The band promoted the song by playing it during the final of ''Germany's Next Topmodel'' on 21 May in the Lanxess Arena, Cologne.\n\n''[[Foot of the Mountain]]'', A-ha's ninth studio album, was released in Europe on 19 June 2009.

John Ratcliff introduced them to his manager, <span class=\"plainlinks\">[http://a-ha.com/the-band/the-story-so-far/chapter-11/ Terry Slater]</span>, and after a few meetings, A-ha enlisted Ratcliff as a manager as well. Slater and Ratcliff formed TJ Management. Ratcliff dealt with technical and musical aspects and Slater acted as the group's international business manager and as liaison to Warner Brothers' head office in Los Angeles.\n\n===''Hunting High and Low'' (1984\u20131986)===\nAn early version of \"[[Take On Me]]\" was the first song that Morten Harket had heard Magne Furuholmen and P\u00e5l Waaktaar play in [[Asker]]. At that time, the song was called \"Miss Eerie\", and the two men were still known as [[Bridges (band)|Bridges]]. Morten stated it sounded more like a \" Juicy fruit song \" for a gum advert -  It was renamed \"Lesson One\" when it was first recorded by A-ha. After some re-writing, multiple re-recordings, and three releases, \"Take On Me\" became a hit on both sides of the Atlantic in 1985. The first version of the song, released in 1984, was promoted by a video of the band performing the song in front of a blue background. The song was then re-recorded with production by Alan Tarney, but this new release failed to chart. The song was re-released with a new, groundbreaking video; this time, the song peaked at number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"US Singles-positions for A-ha\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/a-ha-p3491/charts-awards/billboard-singles| title=Allmusic: A-ha (Singles)|website=[[AllMusic]]| accessdate=25 March 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"UK\" /> A-ha became the first Norwegian band to have a number one hit in the U.S. The popularity of \"Take on Me\" earned the band a spot on the American television series ''[[Soul Train]]'' in 1985, making them one of the few white artists to appear on the black music-oriented show.

Their six MTV Award wins for that video gave them twice as many wins as [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]\" and more than any artist in the three years of the awards combined.\n\nThe band's second single worldwide was \"[[The Sun Always Shines on T.V.]]\", even though \"Love is Reason\" was the 2nd single in Norway. In the US the song peaked at number 20 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and reached number 17 on [[Radio & Records]] airplay chart. A remix version was a club hit, rising to number 5 on the [[Hot Dance Singles Sales]] chart.<ref name=\"US Singles-positions for A-ha\"/> The music video for the song was another popular and critical success, nominated in three categories at the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards and winning two, Best Cinematography and Best Editing, bringing A-ha's total to 11 nominations and eight wins. The following year, [[Peter Gabriel]] would earn 13 nominations and win nine awards, also for two separate videos. In successive years, even as the award categories expanded, only a few artists have approached\u2014and none have surpassed the single-year award totals of A-ha and Gabriel.\n\nA-ha's American success culminated in their 1986 [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination in the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] category, which was eventually won by [[Sade (band)|Sade]]. \"The Sun Always Shines on TV\" turned out to be A-ha's last Hot 100 [[Top 40]] single, and to this day in the United States, A-ha is remembered by the general public almost entirely because of their number one hit single, \"Take On Me\".<ref name=\"US Singles-positions for A-ha\"/> As such, the band is frequently considered a [[one-hit wonder]] there, despite their two Top 40 hits. In the UK, however, the story was very different: \"The Sun Always Shines on TV\" became their only number 1 there.<ref name=\"UK\" /> In the UK, A-ha enjoyed continued success with two more hit singles from the same album\u2014\"Train of Thought\" and \"Hunting High and Low\" (with another innovative video) \u2014and the band remained popular throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nThe band's first album, 1985's ''[[Hunting High and Low]]'', became a worldwide bestseller, spending most of October and November in the top 20 of [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s Top 200 album chart. The album and its four hit singles garnered international recognition for A-ha.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, A-ha were very popular in South America, especially in Brazil, where the band sold out some of the largest stadiums in the world. At the [[Rock in Rio|Rock in Rio II]] festival in January 1991, A-ha shocked the international entertainment press by drawing an audience of 198,000 at [[Maracan\u00e3 stadium]] for their top-billed evening concert\u2014a [[Guinness World Record]] for biggest rock concert attendance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LqY3qCF-8pQC&q=%22A-ha%22+Guinness+rio&dq=%22A-ha%22+Guinness+rio&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwip277jkJDYAhWBQ48KHZW9BmUQ6AEILDAB|title=Guinness World Records 2001|first=Tim|last=Footman|date=1 September 2000|publisher=Mint Publishers, Incorporated|accessdate=17 December 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref> In contrast, the other performers ([[George Michael]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], and [[Guns N' Roses]]) each drew less than a third of that audience, 60,000 each. In a 2009 interview from Cody Eide in ''Musicweek'', celebrating A-ha's up and coming 25-year anniversary, the band members revealed that the record-breaking concert and the lack of media attention they received were a devastating blow to the band. The 1991 Rock in Rio festival, which should have been the band's crowning achievement, was instead a moment of crushing disappointment. \"MTV interviewed everybody except us\", remembers Waaktaar-Savoy. \"They were all calling their bosses and saying, 'We must cover A-ha; it's the only night that has sold out.'

Relative to previous releases, the album was a commercial disappointment. The only single from the album to chart officially outside of Norway was \"Dark Is the Night\", which peaked at number 19 in the United Kingdom. ''Memorial Beach'' is notably the last official American release by A-ha to date, although their material has continued to have limited availability there as imports.

The subsequent album, ''[[Lifelines (A-ha album)|Lifelines]]'', was released in 2002, going platinum in Norway and producing two top 5 hits there, \"[[Forever Not Yours]]\" and \"[[Lifelines (song)|Lifelines]]\". Jesper Hiro directed the video for \"Lifelines\", based on the short film ''[[A Year Along the Abandoned Road]]'', which was directed by Morten Skallerud in 1991. The original short film was 12 minutes long; it shows a whole year passing by in one shot at 50,000 times the normal speed.\n\nA live album from their 2002 tour, titled ''[[How Can I Sleep with Your Voice in My Head]]'', was released in March 2003, preceded by a live single of the 1986 hit \"The Sun Always Shines on TV.\" In 2004, a book entitled \"The Swing of Things\" was published, which also featured a CD of early demo material. That year A-ha celebrated their 20th anniversary with the release of a new singles collection, ''[[The Definitive Singles Collection 1984\u20132004]]''. This compilation brought them back into the UK Top 20 Album Charts, where they reached number 13 and earned a [[Music recording certification|Gold album]].\n\nOn 2 July 2005, A-ha performed at the Berlin edition of [[Live 8]], in front of an audience of nearly 200,000 people. They began with \"Hunting High and Low\", followed by \"Take On Me\", during which [[Morten Harket]] had difficulties hearing himself when his [[in-ear monitor]] failed: he requested a two-minute break, which he used to comment on the cause of Live 8. The intended two minutes became almost seven, and the third song, \"Summer Moved On,\" became the last of their set. Although four songs had been rehearsed, the band's time had run out and the organisers told them to leave the stage.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n[[File:A-ha Morten2.jpg|thumb|left|Lead vocalist [[Morten Harket]] live at Cologne, 29 October 2005]]\nOn 12 September 2005, A-ha played a quickly sold-out show at [[Irving Plaza]] in New York City, the band's first concert in North America since 1986 despite not having released any material there since 1993. On 27 August 2005, the band played a concert for 120,000 people in [[Frogner Park]] in Oslo, the largest concert ever in Norway.\n\nOn 4 November 2005, the band released its eighth studio album, ''[[Analogue (album)|Analogue]]''. The UK release of the single \"[[Analogue (All I Want)|Analogue]]\" gave A-ha their first top 10 hit in the UK since 1988.<ref name=\"UK\" /> The album includes a guest appearance by [[Graham Nash]] of [[Crosby Stills & Nash]] performing backup vocals on the songs \"Over the Treetops\" and \"Cosy Prisons\". The song \"[[Celice (song)|Celice]]\" became the band's ninth to go No.&nbsp;1 on a major national chart, and its music video sparked criticism for its sexual content. The following tour included a gig at London's Shepherd's Bush in February 2006, along with a TV special in Africa. In 2006, A-ha recorded a cover of [[John Lennon]]'s \"[[No.&nbsp;9 Dream]]\" for [[Amnesty International]].

Unionist postcard 1912]]\n'''Unionism in Ireland''' is a political tradition on the island that professes loyalty to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Crown]] and [[Constitution of the United Kingdom]]. The overwhelming sentiment of a once ascendant minority [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestant population]], in the decades following [[Catholic Emancipation]] (1829) it mobilised to oppose the restoration of an [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish parliament]]. As \"Ulster unionism,\" in the century since [[Partition of Ireland|Partition]] (1921), its commitment has been to the retention within the United Kingdom of the six Ulster counties of [[Northern Ireland]]. Within the framework of a [[Northern Ireland peace process|peace settlement for Northern Ireland]], since 1998 unionists have reconciled to sharing office with [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] in a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] administration, while continuing to rely on the connection with Great Britain to secure their cultural and economic interests.\n\n==Irish Unionism 1800-1904==\n\n===The Act of Union 1800===\n[[File:Battle of Ballynahinch (2).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Detail from The [[Battle of Ballynahinch]] 1798 by Thomas Robinson. Government Yeomanry prepare to hang a United Irish insurgent, Hugh McCulloch, a grocer.]]\n\nIn the last decades of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] (1542-1800) [[Protestants]] in public life advanced themselves as \"Irish patriots.\"  Their patriotism focused upon an [[Protestant Ascendancy|Ascendancy]] [[Parliament of Ireland|parliament in Dublin]]. Confined on a narrow franchise to communicants of the ([[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]]) [[Church of Ireland]], the parliament denied equal protection and public office both to Protestant \"[[Dissenters]]\" and to the Kingdom's dispossessed [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] majority. The high point of this parliamentary patriotism was the formation during the [[American War of Independence]], of the [[Irish Volunteers (18th century)|Irish Volunteers]] and, as that militia drilled and paraded, the securing in 1782 of the parliament's legislative independence from [[British Privy Council]] in London.\n\nIn [[Presbyterian]] [[Ulster]], where confident in their own numbers Protestants looked upon the Catholic interest with relative equanimity, combinations of tradesmen, merchants, and tenant farmers protested against a parliament that continued in the service of the Kingdom's greatest proprietors and of an executive in [[Dublin Castle]] still appointed, through the office of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], by English ministers.  \nDespairing of reform and emboldened by the [[French Revolution]], these United Irishmen determined that \"if the men of property will not support us, they must fall,\" and that if they were to fall that \"Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter\u201d should unite \"to break the connection with England.\" Such [[Jacobin]] resolve was broken upon the wheel of their [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 uprising]], an insurrection joined in the south by Catholic peasantry.'''\n\nThe British government, that had had to deploy its own forces to suppress the rebellion and to turn back and defeat French intervention, resolved upon a Union. For the chief of Castle executive [[Lord Castlereagh]], the principal merit of a bringing Ireland directly under the British constitution was a resolution of what was ultimately the key issue for the governance of the country, the Catholic question.:<ref>John Bew, Castlereagh. Enlightenment, War and Tyranny. Quercas. London 2012. P. 127</ref>\n<blockquote>Linked with England, the Protestants, feeling less exposed, would be more confident and liberal; and the Catholics would have less inducement to look beyond that indulgence which is consistent with the security of our establishment.<ref>Castlereagh to Sir Laurence Parsons, 28 November 1798, Castlereagh Correspondence, vol. 11, pp. 32-35</ref>\n</blockquote>\nHowever, opposition from within this \"establishment,\" and not least from the King, [[King George III|George III]], obliged Castlereagh to defy what he saw as \"the very logic of the Union.\"<ref>Bew (2012). p.126</ref> The Union bill that, with a generous distribution of titles and emoluments, he put through the Irish Parliament omitted the provision for Catholic emancipation. A separate Irish executive in Dublin was retained, but representation, still wholly Protestant, was transferred to Westminster constituted as the Parliament of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].\n\nIn decades that followed the [[Acts of Union 1800|Act of Union (1800)]] Protestants of every sectarian persuasion and class reconciled to the loss of an Irish parliament. The legislative union with [[Great Britain]] was seen to not only to occasion their relative prosperity but, as the Roman Catholic majority in Ireland began to stir and gather in a new national movement, also to guarantee their \"liberty.\"\n\n===Catholic Emancipation and the emergence of Nationalist Ireland===\n[[File:Catholic ascendency.jpg|thumb|right|Catholic Emancipation as a world turned upside down: held aloft, Daniel O'Connell promises whigs--symbol of Ascendancy rank and property--for \"ye all.\"]]\nIt took the Union thirty years to deliver on the promise of [[Catholic Emancipation]] (1829)\u2014to admit Catholics to Parliament--and permit an erosion of the Protestant monopoly on position and influence.  An opportunity, had the Union been earlier \"complete,\" to integrate Catholics through their re-emerging propertied and professional classes as a \"dilute minority\" may have passed. As it was, on the morrow of Emancipation it was clear they had chosen \"another route.\" <ref>{{Cite book|title = Modern Ireland 1600-1972t|last = Foster|first = R.

Emancipated within the jurisdiction of the [[Westminster]] parliament, Catholics had to preface principle with the vindication of an historical right\u2014of the Irish as \u201ca people\u201d deserving of a separate representation.  Ireland was re-imagined as a political nation through popular history, balladry, and literature which chronicled the centuries-long resistance of \"the [[Gaels|Gael]]\" and, when all else was lost, of the \"dark days\" of endurance under the [[Penal Laws]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Inventing the Nation: Ireland|last = Comerford|first = R.V.|publisher = Arnold|year = 2003|isbn=0-340-73112-5|location = London}}</ref> Scarcely avoided was the suggestion that in this \"story of the nation\" Irish Protestants were, as [[John Banim]] (the \"[[Walter Scott]] of Ireland\") proposed, \"half-countrymen.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = When God Took Sides: Religion and Identity in Irish History - Unfinished History|last = Elliott|first = Marianne|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2009|isbn=978-0-19-920693-3|location = Oxford|page = 38 }}</ref>\n\nOne response to this imputation of \"foreignness\" to Protestants was inscribed defiantly upon the [[Williamite]] banners of the marching [[Orange Order]]: \"[[Siege of Derry|Derry]], [[Battle of Aughrim|Aughrim]], and the [[Battle of the Boyne|Boyne]],\" \"Sons of Conquerors.\" But short of embracing what Catholics viewed as Ascendancy \"triumphalism,\" the difficulty for Protestants in orientating themselves to the national movement was acute. It was made more so by the reality that in the greater part of country the only element around which the movement could reliably build was the Catholic clergy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=MacDonagh|first=Oliver|title=The Politicisation of the Irish Catholic Bishops 1800-1850 |journal=The Historical Journal|date=1975|volume=18|issue=1|pages=37\u201353|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2638467?seq=1}}</ref>\n\n===Protestant unity and the New Reformation===\n\n[[Image:Protestant Unity.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1899 penny print of Henry Cooke's 1841 speech in \"reply to Daniel O'Connell\"]]\nIn an incident celebrated by unionists, in 1841, disdaining to engage a \"bully . . . the Cock of the North,\" O\u2019Connell refused the challenge of the then Moderator of the Presbyterian General Assembly, [[Henry Cooke (minister)|Henry Cooke]], to debate Repeal in Belfast.\n<blockquote>Look at the town of Belfast.

This was a revivalist movement that owed much to Ulster-Presbyterian ministries in the United States (from where Cooke received his doctorate). The belief it carried in personal empowerment through faith was to lend itself in Ireland to a politically-charged prosperity gospel. ''In The Mystery Solved: or, Ireland's Miseries; the Grand Cause and Cure'', a work that caused a \"sensation\" on its publication in 1852 (a copy was sent to every member of Parliament, and one was \"graciously accepted\" by Queen Victoria),  Dr. Edward Marcus Dill, a \"General  missionary agent\" of the Presbyterian Assembly, argued that the poverty of Catholic Ireland  was rooted, not in a history of political disability, but in a counterfeit faith.<ref>.{{cite web||author=W.

Caricature 1881.]]\nIn December 1885, the [[Liberal Party]] leader [[William Ewart Gladstone]] announced his conversion to a compromise that had been prepared by O\u2019Connell prior to his death in 1847. Ireland would have a measure of \u201chome rule\u201d within the United Kingdom.\n\nUp to, and through, the great starvation, the [[Irish Famine]], of the 1840s, successive governments, Whig and Tory, had maintained a studied indifference to the systemic consequences in Ireland of peasant dispossession and unchecked landlordism. The issues of a low-level agrarian war came to [[Westminster]] in 1852. In a direct challenge to the landed-interest [[Irish Conservative Party]], what the [[Young Ireland]]er Gavan Duffy optimistically described as the \u201c[[Tenant Right League|League of North and South]]\u201d returned 50 tenant-rights MPs. For unionism the more momentous challenge lay in the wake of the [[1867 Reform Act]]. In Great Britain it produced an electorate that no longer identified instinctively with the landed interest. In Ireland, where it more than doubled in size, in 1874 the electorate returned 59 Members for the [[Home Rule League]] who were to sit as the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP). Of these, only two were returned from Ulster (from the border county of Cavan): \"Ulster protestants, as a body, were as strongly opposed to home rule as they had been to repeal.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Making of Modern Ireland 1603-1923|last=Beckett|first=J.C.|publisher=Faber & Faber|year=1966|isbn=0-571-09267-5|location=London|pages=381}}</ref>\n\nThe Home Rule League was led nonetheless by the son of a Church of Ireland rector and an Ulsterman. [[Isaac Butt]] had been seduced from his commitments to the Conservative Party and Orange Order by the failure of the Union to give famine-stricken Cork the relief that he believed would have been given Cornwall. In the British [[House of Commons]] Butt was seconded by another maverick from the north, a Catholic convert, [[Joseph Biggar]]. Biggar led an aggressive form of obstructionism that deliberately courted the judgement that as a body the IPP was \u201cpractically foreign\u201d and \u201cvalued its place in the House only as a means of making itself so-disagreeable as to obtain its release.\u201d<ref>James Bryce, \u201cHow we became Home-Rulers.\u201d ''The Contemporary Review''. Vol. LI. May 1887, pp. 736-756. p.740</ref>\n\nGladstone in his first ministry (1868-1874) attempted conciliation. In [[Disestablishment of the Church of Ireland|1869 the Church of Ireland was disestablished]] and in 1870 a [[Land Acts (Ireland)|Land Act]] acknowledged for the first time a political responsibility for agrarian conditions. But spurred by the collapse of agricultural prices in the [[Long Depression]], the [[Land War]] intensified. From 1879 it was organised by the direct-action [[Irish National Land League]], led by another of Butt's lieutenants (and who, like Butt, bestowed upon the Nationalist movement \"a deceptively ecumenical air\") the southern (albeit half-American) Protestant [[Charles Stewart Parnell]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Atlas of Irish History|last=Duffy|first=Sean|publisher=Gill & Macmillan|year=1997|isbn=0-7171-2479-7|location=Dublin|pages=106}}</ref>  As late as 1881 Gladstone resorted (over a 41-hour [[filibuster]] by IPP) to a Coercion Act allowing for arbitrary arrest and detention in protection of \u201cperson and property.\u201d\n\nThe final and decisive shift in favour of constitutional concessions came in the wake of the [[Representation of the People Act 1884|Third Reform Act of 1884]]. The near-universal admission to the suffrage of male heads of household tripled the electorate in Ireland. The 1885 election returned an IPP of 85 Members (including 17 from Catholic-majority areas of Ulster), marshalled now under the leadership of Parnell. Gladstone, whose Liberals lost all 15 of their Irish seats, was able to form his second ministry only with their Commons support.\n\n===Reaction to Gladstone\u2019s Home Rule Bills===\n[[File:Unionist Convention 1892 (3).jpg|thumb|left|\"God Save the Queen\" \"Erin Go Bragh\" Ulster Unionist Convention, Belfast, 1892]]\nThe [[Government of Ireland Bill 1886|Government of Ireland Bill]] that Gladstone tabled in June 1886 incorporated what he imagined were assurances for Unionism. The 200 or so popularly elected members of the \u201cIrish Legislative Body\u201d would sit in session with 28 [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish Peers]] and a further 75 Members elected on a highly restrictive property franchise. The anticipated result might have been rough nationalist-unionist parity.\n\nWhat was clear to unionists was that Ireland was being put out of the United Kingdom. The \u201cImperial Parliament\u201d in London would retain sovereignty (\u201cdevolving\u201d powers to Dublin) but no Irish representation. What was proposed was a proximate restoration of the constitution of the Kingdom of Ireland as it had existed before 1782\u2014a colonial legislature in Dublin with an executive accountable to London through the Lord Lieutenant. But it was with arrangements for representation in Ireland on terms, and in an era, that unionists feared could only march in one direction--toward majority rule and total separation.\n\nThe alarm among Protestants appeared to surmount all previous distinctions of party or class and, in addition to express fears of \"[[Rome Rule]],\" spoke to their growing material concerns. These were not only those of the existential struggles in the countryside over land and rent. The upper and middle classes found in Britain and the Empire \"a wide range of profitable careers--in the army, in the public services, in commerce--from which they might be shut out if the link between Ireland and Great Britain were weakened or severed.\"<ref>Beckett (1966), pp. 398-399</ref> That same link was critical for all those engaged in the great export industries of the North--textiles, engineering, shipbuilding--for whom the Irish hinterland was less present than Clydeside or the North of England.\n\nFor Protestant workers there was the concern that Home Rule would force accommodation of the growing numbers of Catholics arriving at mill and factory gates from the outlying country and western districts. While the plentiful supply of cheap labour helped attract the English and Scottish capital that employed them, Protestant workers organised to protect \u201ctheir\u201d jobs (a function performed in the skilled trades by the apprenticeship system) and tied housing. The once largely rural Orange Order was given a renewed lease and mandate.<ref>Foster (1988), pp. 389-390</ref> The pattern, in itself, was not unique to Belfast or its satellites. Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool and other British centres experiencing heavy Irish immigration developed similar nativist, and even Orange, ward and workplace politics<ref>{{Cite book|title=Irish Migrants in Modern Britain, 1750\u20131922|last=MacRaild|first=Donald|publisher=Macmillan|year=1999|isbn=978-0-312-22032-7|location=London}}</ref>--to which Irish Unionists made conscious appeal.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Irish Unionism 2: Ulster Unionism and the Origins of Northern Ireland 1886-1922|last=Buckland|first=Patrick|publisher=Gill & Macmillan|year=1973|location=London|pages=13}}</ref>\n\nGladstone's own party was split on Home Rule and the House divided against the measure. People were already battling on the streets when the news reached Belfast. The rumour among unionists was that [[1886 Belfast riots|the rioting]], which took upwards of fifty lives, had been triggered when a group of Catholic navvies, anticipating the Bill's passage, pushed a Protestant out of their dock, warning him that \"neither he nor any of his sort should get leave to work there, or earn a loaf there or any other place.\"<ref>Bardon (2008) p. 408</ref>\n\nIn 1891 Ulster's [[Liberal Unionists]], part of larger Liberal break with Gladstone, entered the [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] and at Westminster took the Conservative whip.\n\nIn 1892, despite bitter division, in which the Catholic hierarchy took a heavy hand, over the personally-compromised leadership of Parnell, the Nationalists were able to help Gladstone to a third ministry. The result was a second Home Rule bill.

The Conservatives formed a new ministry.\n\n===Constructive Unionism===\n[[File:Flag of the Congested Districts Board for Ireland (1893\u20131907).svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Congested Districts Board for Ireland]], 1893\u20131907]]\nThe new Prime Minister [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], who had expressed the view that \"free representative institutions\" are best confined to \"people who are of [[Nordic race|Teutonic race]],\" believed his government should \"leave Home Rule sleeping the sleep of the unjust.\"<ref>Bardon (2008). p. 418</ref> Irish Conservatives applauded when in 1887 Dublin Castle was given standing power to suspend [[habeas corpus]].

A new Department of Agriculture and Technical instruction broke with the traditions of Irish Boards by announcing that its aim was to \"be in touch with public opinion of the classes whom its work concerns, and to rely largely for its success upon their active assistance and co-operation.\"<ref>Good (1920). p, 210</ref> It supported and encouraged dairy cooperatives, the \"creameries\" that were to be an important institution in the emergence of a new class of independent smallholders.<ref>Bardon (2009) pp. 421-423</ref>\n\nGreater reform followed when, with the support of the splinter [[Liberal Unionist Party]], Salisbury returned to office in 1895. [[Land Acts (Ireland)|The Land Act of 1896]] introduced for the first time the principle of compulsory sale to tenants, through its application was limited to bankrupt estates. \u201cYou would suppose,\u201d said [[Sir Edward Carson]], Dublin barrister and the leading spokesman for Irish Conservatives, \u201cthat the Government were revolutionists verging on Socialism.\u201d.<ref>Good (1920), p. 209</ref> Having been first obliged to surrender their hold on local government (transferred at a stroke in 1898 to democratically-elected councils), the old landlord class had the terms of their retirement fixed by the [[Land Acts (Ireland)|Wyndham Land Act]] of 1903.

Until then, unionism had largely placed itself behind those of [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] landed interest that appeared to have the greatest pull at Westminster. The UUC still accorded a degree of precedence to aristocracy. Castlereagh's descendant and former Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the [[Charles Stewart Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 6th Marquess of Londonderry|Marquess of Londonderry]] presided over its Executive (and [[Edith Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Marchioness of Londonderry|Lady Londonderry]] over the Ulster Women's Unionist Council). The Council also retained the services of Carson, from 1892 MP for [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. But marshalled by Captain [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], a millionaire director of Belfast's [[Dunville & Co|Dunville Whiskey]], it was northern employers who were undertaking the real political and organisational work.\n\nThe manufacturers and merchants of Belfast and neighbouring industrial districts were, for the most part, of farming and Presbyterian stock and had little natural sympathy for the old landed interest.<ref>Good (1920), p. 227</ref> Crucially, while southern landowners had been politically at war with their tenants, northern employers could count on voting with the majority of their own workforce. For Nationalists this was a matter employers playing \"the Orange card.\" Employers did look to sectarian division to weaken labour protest, although Orangemen could not always be relied upon. In the great [[1907 Belfast Dock strike|Belfast Dock strike of 1907]], the [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] leader [[James Larkin]] was able to engage the support of the [[Independent Orange Order]].<ref>Collins, Peter (1998). \"Larkin, James\", S.J. Connolly, The Oxford Companion to Irish History. Oxford University Press. p. 302</ref> (In 1903 its founder, Tom Sloan, had been the only Unionist MP to vote for the Miners' Eight Hour bill).\n\nLoyalist workers were conscious, and resentful, of the imputation that they were the retainers of \u201cbig-house unionists.\u201d  A manifesto signed in the spring of 1914 by two thousand labour men, on behalf of the only \u201cfully organised and articulate\u201d trade unionists in Ireland, repudiated the suggestion of the radical and socialist press that Ulster was being manipulated by \u201can aristocratic plot.\u201d If Sir Edward Carson led in the battle for the Union it was \u201cbecause we, the workers, the people, the democracy of Ulster, have chosen him.\u201d  Chairman of the Boilermakers\u2019 Society, J. Hanna, insisted that it was as the \u201cfreemen and as members of the greatest democracy in Great Britain and Ireland, the organised trade unions of the country,\u201d that \u201cthey would not have Home Rule.\u201d<ref>John Biggs-Davison, ''The Hand is Red''. London, Johnson. 1973. P. 74</ref>\n\nThe difficulty for nationalists and for those, like [[James Connolly]], who believed that class solidarity should draw workers down the path of national independence, was that without having to break political ranks with their employers, workers were beginning to see that \u201cgreatest democracy\u201d was paying dividends. Thanks to the legislative union, in whose defence Unionists among them effectively voted Conservative, workers in Ireland were able to benefit from the majorities found \u201cacross the water\u201d for labour and social reform-\u2014under the a Liberal-majority government from 1906, for the [[Trade Disputes Act 1906]], for the [[National Insurance Act 1911]] and for the \u201c[[People's Budget]] 1911. \u00a0\n\nThe nationalist cause in the industrial North was not helped by those who suggested that collective bargaining, social security and progressive taxation were principles for which majorities would not be as readily found in a Dublin Parliament. Objecting to an \u201cinefficient and extravagant government . . . which had no parallel in Europe,\u201d ''[[Sinn Fein]]'' President [[Arthur Griffith]] proposed that \u201cimperialism and socialism\u2014forms of the cosmopolitan heresy and in essence one\u2014have offered man the material world.

A total of 234,046 women signed the Ulster Women's Declaration; 237,368 men signed the [[Ulster Covenant|Solemn League and Covenant]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Ulster Covenant|last=Gordon|first=Lucy|publisher=Ulster society|year=1989|location=Belfast}}</ref>\n\nUnionist women had been involved in political campaigning from the time of the first Home Rule Bill in 1886. Some were active [[suffragette]]s. [[Isabella Tod]], an anti-Home Rule Liberal and campaigner for girls education, was an early pioneer. In 1873 she founded the Northern Irish branch of the [[National Society for Women's Suffrage]]. Later, while still based in Belfast, this became the [[Irish Women's Suffrage Society]] publishing the weekly ''The Irish Citizen''.<ref>Courtney (2013). pp. 240-241</ref>\n\nNot all IWSS Unionists were impressed by the Women's Declaration. Elizabeth McCracken, a regular contributor to ''The Irish Citizen'' and the [[Belfast News Letter]] noted the failure Unionist women to formulate \"any demand on their own behalf or that of their own sex.\"<ref>History Ireland, Irish Suffragettes at the time of the Home Rule Crisis, https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/irish-suffragettes-at-the-time-of-the-home-rule-crisis/</ref> The Declaration, nonetheless, was a political affirmation of intent by women, organised and publicly staged by women--the Ulster Women's Unionist Council. Founded in January 1911, by 1913, with well over 100,000 members, the UWUC was the largest women's political group in Ireland.\n\nDetermined to \"sink all differences in favour of the Union,\" the UWUC avoided public comment on the suffrage question. But for many women signing the Council's Declaration was a first taste of political involvement. In September 1913 it appeared that the Unionist Council had determined it should not be their last. The Council informed the UWUC that \"the draft articles\" for a Provisional Government to be set up in the event of Home Rule being legislated \"include the franchise for women.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/irish-suffragettes-at-the-time-of-the-home-rule-crisis/|title=Irish Suffragettes at the time of the Home Rule Crisis|accessdate=8 March 2020|author=History Ireland}}</ref> The Irish Parliamentary Party made no such commitment for a Dublin parliament.  In contrast to Ulster Unionists who divided, in 1912 the Nationalists had voted as a block against a \"Conciliation\" Bill that would have conceded the principle of women suffrage, albeit on a highly restrictive property basis.<ref>Burke, Jason (2018), \"Carson's Betrayal of Women?

In 1912 the Prime Minister, [[Herbert Asquith]], introduced the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Third Home Rule Bill]]. A more generous dispensation than the earlier bills, it would, for the first time, have given an Irish parliament an accountable executive. It was carried in the Commons by a majority of ten. As expected, it was defeated in the Lords, but as result of the crisis engendered by the opposition of the peers to the 1909 People's Budget the Lords now only had the power of delay. Home Rule would become law in 1914.\n\nFrom the outset there had been discussion of giving \u201can option to Ulster.\u201d In response to the First Home rule Bill in 1886, \u201cRadical Unionists\u201d\u2014Liberals who proposed federalising the relationship between all countries of the United Kingdom\u2014argued that \u201cthe Protestant part of Ulster should receive special treatment . . . on grounds identical with those that support the general contention for Home Rule\u201d <ref>R. W. Dale, \u201cThe Liberal Party and Home Rule,\u201d 1887 784.</ref> In Ulster there was no interest in the federalists\u2019 idea of a Belfast legislature, but the riposte to nationalists remained. In summarising ''The Case Against Home Rule'' (1912),  L. S. Amery argued that against \u201cevery argument that can justify three million Nationalists asserting their national idea over a million Unionists\u201c is \u201cthe stubborn fact that if Irish Nationalism constitutes a nation, then Ulster is a nation too.\u201d <ref>Biggs-Davidson 78</ref>\n\nFaced with the eventual enactment of Home Rule, Carson appeared to press the point. On 28 September 1912, \u2018Ulster Day\u2019 he was the first to sign, in Belfast City Hall, [[Ulster Covenant|Ulster's Solemn League and Covenant]]<ref name=proni>{{cite web|url=http://www.proni.gov.uk/index/search_the_archives/ulster_covenant/ulster_day.htm|title=The Ulster Covenant: Ulster Day|accessdate=29 September 2012|author=[[PRONI]]}}</ref> binding its signatories \u201cto stand by one another in defending for ourselves and our children our position of equal citizenship in the United Kingdom, and in using all means which may be found necessary to defeat the present [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] to set up a Home Rule Parliament in Ireland.\u201d (The historic reference, widely understood, was to the sixteenth-century [[Covenanters|Scottish Covenants]] that had bound Presbyterians to defend in arms their reformed faith)\n\nIn January 1913, Carson declared for the exclusion of Ulster and called for the enlistment of up to 100,000 Covenanters as drilled and armed [[Ulster Volunteers]]. On September 23rd, the second Ulster Day, he accepted Chairmanship of a Provisional Government, elaborately organised by Craig.  If Home Rule were imposed \u201cwe will be governed as a conquered community and nothing else.\u201d <ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973). p. 79.</ref>\n\nFor Carson and for other southern Unionists the object of the gamble on Ulster\u2014with the surety of support from British Conservatives and possibly, following the [[Curragh Mutiny|incident at Curragh]], in the Army\u2014was to out manoeuvre both the Government and the Nationalists, so as to retain Ireland as a whole under the direct authority of the Crown in Westminster. Ulster excluding itself from the jurisdiction of a Dublin Parliament was the threat, but if \u201can option\u201d for Ulster was all that was achieved, it would have been--as Carson later accounted it--a defeat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sluggerotoole.com/2016/08/28/edward-carson-no-one-on-earth-is-so-clearly-the-typical-irishman/|title=Edward Carson, \u2018No one on earth is so clearly the \u201ctypical Irishman\u201d\u2018|last=archive.org|website=www.sluggerotoole.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref>\n\nFor Unionists in the North, the integrity of Ireland within the United Kingdom was not an existential issue. With the signing of the Covenant and the creation of the Provisional government, northern Protestants had effectively \"proclaimed themselves a people apart from the rest of Ireland, and decreed the exclusion of Unionists, as well as Nationalists, who had the misfortune to reside on the wrong bank of the Boyne.\u201d The differences in class between the two sections of Unionism were complicated by the unresolved differences of creed. One of the arguments that was now employed behind the scenes for the exclusion of a smaller enclave of six, rather than the full nine, Ulster counties is that it would possess not merely a Protestant but a Presbyterian majority.<ref>Good (1920). pp. 225-226)</ref>\n\nEconomic differences also made for separation. Agricultural Ulster, and Belfast as a distribution centre, might have important links with the south and west of the country. But the major industries, textiles, shipbuilding and engineering brought those they engaged into routine contact, not with Limerick, Cork or even Dublin, but with Glasgow, Liverpool and London. An Irish partition would not involve the potential loss of a valued hinterland, entrep\u00f4t or market.\n\nUltimately, as recalled by the man celebrated for landing German guns for Ulster Volunteers, Major [[Frederick H. Crawford]], the decision on the Ulster Unionist Council was that \u201cwe could not dictate to the rest of Ireland.\u201d Beyond the Protestant pale in Ulster there was simply no hope of rescuing Unionist brethren from the strength of the demand for Home Rule and from the British sympathy it engaged. \n<blockquote>I moved a resolution that in future our policy be confined to Ulster . . . This very naturally caused dismay among the Unionists of the South and West but when we asked them for an alternative they could suggest no alternative.<ref>Frederick H Crawford, Guns for Ulster, Graham and Heslip, Belfast 1947</ref><ref>Biggs Davidson (1973). pp. 71-72</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Partition===\n[[File:Irish UK election 1918.png|thumb|right|The 1918 general election result in Ireland. Sinn Fein sweeps the south and west]]\nWith the Nationalists seeking to match the Ulster Volunteers by drilling and arming of [[National Volunteers]], in July 1914 King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] called the parties to a [[Buckingham Palace Conference|conference of Buckingham Palace]].  The IPP leader [[John Redmond]] insisted that if any part of Ireland was to be excluded from Dublin's jurisdiction it should only be those limited areas in the north-east with clear Unionist majorities.  Carson, still seeking the leverage that might induce Nationalists to settle on terms more conducive to the continued sovereignty of the Crown in Westminster, insisted on a \u201cclean cut\u201d for the whole nine counties of Ulster. If this was done generously, he suggested that Ulster might, in time, \u201ccome in.\u201d  For a few days the conference, in words of Winston Churchill, \u201ctoiled round the muddy byways of Fermanagh and Tyrone\u201d and no amending bill was agreed.<ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973). p. 229</ref>\n\nOn August 4th 1914, the United Kingdom declared war on Germany. A few weeks later the Home Rule bill received [[Royal Assent]] but with implementation suspended for the duration of European hostilities. With the issue of exclusion unresolved, leaders on both sides entered into a rival solicitation of Government favour by committing themselves, and their volunteers, to the war effort. Having, on the eve of war, been under growing pressure to set up his Provisional Government, Carson declared that \u201cEngland difficulty is not Ulster\u2019s opportunity . . . We do not seeks to purchase terms by selling our patriotism.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title =Dividing Ireland: World War One and Partition|last = Hennessey|first = Thomas|publisher = Routledge|year = 1998|location = London|pages = 72}}</ref>\n\nThat, however, was how Redmond's position came to be perceived on the nationalist side. Seizing upon \u201cEngland difficulty,\u201d contingents of republican [[Irish Volunteers]] and Connolly's [[Irish Citizen Army|Citizen Army]],  ensured that while Irishmen, at Redmond's urging, were sacrificing themselves for the sake of \u201cCatholic Belgium,\u201d Britain could be seen on the streets of [[Easter Rising|Dublin in Easter 1916]] suppressing an Irish \u201cstrike for freedom.\u201d In the aftermath of the Rising and in the course of a [[Conscription Crisis|national campaign against military conscription]], the IPP \u2018s capital was exhausted.<ref>Hennessey (1998)</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title =The Resurrection of Ireland: The Sinn F\u00e9in Party, 1916-1923|last = Laffan|first = Michael|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2012|location = Cambridge|isbn=9781139106849}}</ref>\n\nSensing an opportunity, at the hastily arranged [[Irish Convention]] in Dublin in 1917, the Southern unionists' leader [[St John Brodrick, 1st Earl of Midleton|Lord Middleton]] offered the beleaguered IPP the immediate establishment of an all-Ireland parliament that, among other guarantees for unionists, would split fiscal powers with Westminster and surrender any ambition for an independent tariff policy. But the decision of the Lloyd George and his Cabinet to simultaneously introduce conscription to Ireland--in effect, to make the first order of an Irish government cooperation in the impressment of men for the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]--ruined the credibility of the proposal  with nationalists<ref>[[Stephen Gwynn|Gwynn, Stephen]] (1919), ''John Redmond's last Years'' Ch.

He proposed a United Kingdom federation of England, Scotland, Ulster and the South of Ireland. But the plan evoked no nationalist response.<ref>Biggs-Davison (1973). p. 94</ref>\n\nIn the \"[[Khaki election]]\" of December 1918, the first Westminster poll since 1910 and the first with all adult males and women from age thirty eligible to vote (the electorate tripled), the IPP was almost wholly replaced in nationalist constituencies by Sinn F\u00e9in. Acting on their mandate, Sinn F\u00e9in MPs met in Dublin in January 1919 as the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the national assembly, of the Republic declared in 1916 and demanded that the \"English garrison\" evacuate. In the six north-east counties the Unionists took 22 out of 29 seats, with  Carson, wary of [[Bolshevism|\"Bolshevik]]\" sedition, having taken the additional precaution of running candidates in Belfast as [[Ulster Unionist Labour Association|Labour Unionists]].\n\nViolence against Catholics in Belfast, driven out of workplaces and attacked in their districts, and a boycott of Belfast goods, accompanied by looting and destruction, in the South, helped consolidate \"real partition, spiritual and voluntary\"<ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973) pp. 99-100</ref> in advance of the constitutional partition. This otherwise uncompromising Republicans recognised was, at least for now, inevitable. In August 1920 [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], President of D\u00e1il, declared in favour of \"giving each county power to vote itself out of the Republic if it so wished.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title =Revolutionary Government in Ireland|last = Mitchell|first = Arthur|publisher = Gill & Macmillan|year = 1995|location = Dublin|isbn=0-7171-2015-5|pages = 310}}</ref>\n\nAs they battled with the Republic in the South and West, the British Government, in the hope of brokering a compromise that might yet hold Ireland within the jurisdiction of the \u201cImperial Parliament,\u201d proceeded with the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]. This provided for two subordinate parliaments. In Belfast a \u201cNorthern Ireland\u201d parliament would convene for the six rather than nine Ulster counties (in three, Craig conceded, Sinn F\u00e9iners would make government \"absolutely impossible for us\"). The island's remaining twenty-six counties, \"Southern Ireland,\" would be represented in Dublin. In a joint Council, the two parliaments would be free to enter into all-Ireland arrangements.\n\nIn 1921, elections for these parliaments were duly held. But in \"Southern Ireland\" this was for parliament which, by British agreement, would now constitute itself as the D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann of the [[Irish Free State]]. Under the terms of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], the twenty-six counties were to have the \"same constitutional status in the Community of Nations known as the British Empire as the Dominion of [[Canada]].\"<ref> {{cite web|title= The Anglo-Irish Treaty, 6 December 1921|url=http://www.https://cain.ulster.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/ait1921.htm/|accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref> It was not clear to all parties at the time\u2014civil war ensued\u2014but this was de facto independence.\n\nUnionists in Northern Ireland thus found themselves in the unanticipated and unsought position of having to work a constitutional arrangement that was the \u201cby-product of the desperate attempt by British statesmen\u201d to reconcile \u201cthe determination of the Protestant population of the North to remain firmly and without qualification within the United Kingdom\u201d with the aspirations of the Nationalist majority in Ireland for Irish unity and independence,<ref>{{Cite book|title = Lessons of Ulster|last = Utley|first = T.E.|publisher = J.M.

Belfast, like [[Ottawa]], had a two-chamber [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Parliament]], a Cabinet and [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland|Prime Minister]] ([[Sir James Craig]]), and [[the Crown]] represented by a [[Governor of Northern Ireland|Governor]] ([[James Hamilton, 3rd Duke of Abercorn|the Duke of Abercorn]]) and advised by a [[Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Privy Council]]. All this was suggestive, not a devolved administration within the United Kingdom, but of a state constituted under the Crown outside the direct jurisdiction of the Westminster parliament.\n\nThe impression that Ireland as a whole was being removed from the orbit of Westminster politics was reinforced by refusal of the parties of Government and Opposition to organise, or canvass for votes, in the six counties.<ref>{{Cite book|title =Fatal Influence: The Impact of Ireland on British Politics|last = Mathews|first = Kevin|publisher = University College Dublin Press|year = 2004|location = Dublin|isbn=978-1904558057|pages = 310}}</ref>  The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] were content that [[Ulster Unionist Party]] MPs took their party [[whip]] in the [[House of Commons]] where, by general agreement, matters within the competence of the Belfast Parliament could not be raised.

Despite its broad legislative powers, the Belfast Parliament did not, in any case, have the kinds of tax and spending powers that might have engendered that kind of party competition. For all its [[Queen-in-Parliament|crown-in-parliament]] pretension and, from 1932, the grandeur of its [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Buildings at Stormont]], the Northern Ireland Parliament was \"effectively dependant for supply on the Parliament at Westminster.\"<ref>Biggs-Davison (1973), p. 18</ref> The principal sources of government revenue, income and corporation taxes, customs and excise, were entirely beyond Belfast's control.<ref>{{Cite book |title = The Government of Northern Ireland: Public Finance and Public Services, 1921-1964|last = Lawrence|first = R.J..|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1965|location = Oxford|pages = 40\u201341+}}</ref>\n\nThe one unambiguous remit of the Belfast parliament was precisely that in which the Gladstone Home Rule bills had sought to limit a Dublin parliament: internal \"law and order.\" Unionists argue that these were \"responsibilities thrust upon them\": <blockquote>[U]nionists leaders had no desire to \"dominate\" Catholics in the pursuit of loyalist self-determination. As [[Sir Edward Carson|Lord Carson]] argued in the House of Commons . . ., unionists never asked to govern any Ulster Catholic but were perfectly happy that both Protestants and Catholics should be governed from Westminster. The strongest foundation for the good government of Ulster, he argued, was the fact that Westminster was aloof from the religious and racial distinction of its inhabitants.<ref>Aughey (1995), p. 15</ref></blockquote>\n\nCatholics were a third of the population in the six counties: a minority in four, [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[County Down|Down]] and [[County Armagh|Armagh]], and a majority in two, [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]]. Carson was apprehensive, fearing that with a separate parliament sectarianism could be the only basis for politics. In 1921 he reminded Craig and other Unionist leaders: \"We used to say that we could not trust an Irish parliament in Dublin to do justice to the Protestant minority. Let us take care that that reproach can no longer be made against your parliament, and from the outset let them see that the Catholic minority have nothing to fear from a Protestant majority.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = Dudley Edwards | first = Ruth | title = Biography: Carson by Geoffrey Lewis | newspaper = The Times | date = 29 May 2005 | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article526275.ece |access-date=13 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n===On the edge of the Union===\n[[File:USC OrangeLodge1970.jpg|thumb|upright|An Orange Order banner dedicated to the Ulster Special Constabulary. 2007]]\nIn retirement in London Carson confided to the historian [[Charles Petrie (historian)|Sir Charles Petrie]] his disillusionment with Belfast politics: \"I fought to keep Ulster part of the United Kingdom, but Stormont is turning her into a second-class Dominion.\"<ref>Sir Charles Petrie, ''A Historian Looks At His World'' (London: Sedgwick & Jackson, 1972), p. 27.</ref> Yet in the first critical years of the new Northern Ireland administration, Carson had stood with other Unionist leaders in urging measures that were both resented by nationalists and poorly understood or appreciated in Great Britain.\n\nOne of the first act of Northern Ireland legislature was to overturn a British attempt to maximise the representation of a minority-populated \"centre ground.\" In 1919 [[proportional representation]] (PR) had been prescribed for all Irish elections. In the January 1920 urban council elections in Ulster preference voting assisted nationalists to the control of 21 of 45 townships, including [[Omagh]], [[Newry]] and \"what was the greatest blow to Unionist pride\", [[Derry]].<ref>Generally, unionists prefer to use Londonderry, the official name of the city, whereas nationalists prefer the name 'Derry'. Due to this complexity and potential for problems, Wikipedia uses a consensus where ''Derry'' is used to refer to the city and Londonderry the county.</ref>  In Belfast, where under the old [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post system]] Unionists had taken 52 of 60 council seats, under PR the nationalists were able to take ten, although perhaps \"most disturbing to Carson and his followers\" was the success of twelve labour candidates (ten for the independent [[Belfast Labour Party]]).<ref>Matthews (2004). p. 20</ref>  In the county, and rural district, council elections that followed in June 1920 nationalists took control of two of the six counties (Fermanagh and, for the first time Tyrone) and 36 of the 55 districts.\n\nThe twelve anti-partitionist MPs returned in May 1921 to the fifty-two member Northern parliament refused to take their seats. They joined nationalist councillors, and large numbers of Catholic school officials and teachers, in pledging themselves to Dublin. At the annual [[Parades in Northern Ireland|12th of July Orange celebrations]] Carson denounced those who elected swore allegiance to the Republic and vowed that Ulster would \"tolerate no Sinn F\u00e9in organisation or methods\" within its border. At the same time, he declared that \"real object\" of the independent Labour movement was \"to bring about disunity among our people.\"<ref>Matthews (2004). p. 22</ref>\n\nThe 1922 Local Government Act that restored the winner-take-all voting system also authorised the N.I. Minister of Home Affairs to rearrange local government constituencies. Unionists dispute that this led to a systematic policy of [[gerrymandering|gerrymander]]. In what is generally cited as the most egregious example, Derry, from 1923 a \"nationalist city\" with a Unionist council, they point to the low turnout among a dispirited and abstentionist nationalist electorate, and among Catholics voting to the comparatively strong support for labour candidates.<ref>{{Cite book |title = Londonderry Revisited: A Loyalist Analysis of the Civil Rights Controversy|last = Kingsley|first = Paul|publisher = Belfast Publicationss|year = 1989|location = Belfast|isbn = 0951554905|pages = 19\u201339}}</ref> But a generation later, in 1968 when nationalists were taking to the streets of the city, the veteran Unionist MP and former Northern Ireland Attorney General Edmunnd Warnock advised the then Prime Minister Terence O'Neill that \"If ever a community had a right to demonstrate against a denial of civil rights, Derry is the finest example.\" Warnock confessed to his own role in the \"manipulation of ward boundaries for the sole purpose of retaining unionist control\".

It was an almost entirely Protestant force, an excuse the nationalists alleged for arming Orangemen.

Consistent with the obligation under the Government of Ireland Act to neither establish nor endow a religion, a 1923 Education Act provided that in schools religious instruction would only be permitted after school hours and with parental consent. Lord Londonderry, as Minister of Education, owned that his ambition was mixed Protestant-Catholic education. In a reprise of the reception of Dublin-Castle National Schools proposal a century before, a coalition of Protestant clerics, school principals and Orangemen insisted on the imperative of bible teaching. Craig relented, amending the act in 1925. Meanwhile, the Catholic hierarchy refused to transfer any schools, and would not allow male Catholic student teachers to enrol in a common training college with Protestants or women.<ref> {{cite web|title= Lord Londonderry & Education Reform in 1920s Northern Ireland |author= Neil Fleming |url=http://www.historyireland.com/troubles-in-ni/ni-1920-present/lord-londonderry-education-reform-in-1920s-northern-ireland/|accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref> In the North (as in the South) a pillar of sectarian division, the school-age segregation of Protestants and Catholics, was sustained.\n\nIn looking to the post-war future, the Unionist Government under Basil Brooke ([[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Lord Brookeborough]]) did make two reform commitments. First, it promised a programme of \"slum clearance\" and public housing construction (in the wake of the [[Belfast Blitz]] the authorities acknowledged that much of the housing stock had been \"uninhabitable\" before the war). Second, the Government accepted an offer from London--understood as a reward for the province's wartime service--to match the parity in taxation between Northern Ireland and Great Britain with parity in the services delivered. What Northern Ireland might loose in autonomy, it was going to gain in a closer, more equal, Union. Since the Belfast government could not in any case control the tax implications, it seemed that they could only welcome British financial support for the public spending that would follow.<ref>{{Cite book |title = History of Northern Ireland|last = Buckland|first = Patrick|publisher =Gill & Macmillan|year = 1981|location = Dublin|isbn = 9780717110698|pages = 83}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1960s Unionism was administering something at odds with the conservatism of those to whom leadership had been conceded in the resistance to Irish Home Rule. Under the impetus of the [[Labour Government 1945-1951|post-War Labour government]] in Britain, and thanks to the generosity of British exchequer, Northern Ireland had emerged with an advanced [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|welfare state]]. The Education Act (NI), 1947, \"revolutionised access\" to secondary and further education. Catholic grant-aided schools were fully funded, and a school transfer test (the [[Eleven Plus]]) enabled qualifying students to receive a grammar-school education irrespective of background or circumstances. Health-care provision was expanded and re-organised on the model of the [[National Health Service]] in Great Britain to ensure universal access. The Victorian-era [[Irish Poor Laws|Poor Law]], sustained after 1921, was replaced with a comprehensive system of social-security. Under the Housing Act (NI) 1945 the public subvention for new home construction was even greater, proportionately, than in England and Wales. The distinction between rural and urban housing was abolished, and local councils become housing authorities.<ref>Wichert (1981, pp. 43-49</ref>\n\n===1960s: reform and protest===\n[[File:NICRA 1968 Derry march.jpg|thumb|upright]]\nIn the 1960s, under premiership of [[Terence O'Neill]], Ulster Unionism was led through seeming economic-policy successes into a political crisis that upended the 1921 devolved constitution. A scion of a landed family (brought Up partly in [[Abyssinia]] and partly at [[Eton College|Eton]]) and, like all contenders for his position, a member of the [[Orange Order]], O'Neill was the unlikely champion of a technocratic approach to government that was impatient with what he decried as \"ancient hatreds.\"<ref>Cole John, in Introduction to {{Cite book |title = Ulster at the Crossroads|last = O'Neill|first = Terence|publisher = Faber & Faber|year = 1969|location = London|pages = 11}}</ref> \n\nRecognising the decline of the province's Victorian-era industries, under O'Neill the Stormont administration intensified its efforts to attract outside capital. Investment in new infrastructure, training schemes coordinated with trade unions, and direct grants succeeded in attracting American, British and continental firms (some of these introducing into the one time [[linenopolis]] artificial fibres). In its own terms, the strategy was a success: the level of manufacturing employment was better than sustained. Yet Protestant workers and local Unionist leadership were unsettled.

Speaking to Labour MPs in London, [[John Hume]] suggested that \"the plan\" was \"to develop the strongly Unionist-Belfast-Coleraine-Portadown triangle and to cause a migration from West to East Ulster, redistributing and scattering the minority to that the Unionist Party will not only maintain but strengthen its position.\"<ref>''Derry Journal'', 6 August 1965, cited in Kingsley (1989) pp. 98-99</ref>\n\nHume, a teacher from Derry, presented himself as a spokesman for an emerging \"third force\": a \"generation of younger Catholics in the North\" frustrated with a \"flags and slogans\" nationalism whose seeming indifference to \"the general welfare of Northern Ireland\" had made \"the task of Unionist ascendancy simpler.\" Determined to engage the \"great social problems of housing, unemployment and emigration\", these new \"political wanderers\" were willing to acknowledge that \"the Protestant tradition in the North is as strong and as legitimate\" as their own (if \"a man wishes Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom [that] does not necessarily make him a bigot or a discriminator\") and that Irish unity, \"if it is to come,\" could be achieved only \"by the will of the Northern majority.\"<ref>John Hume (1964), \"The Northern Catholic I\", ''The Irish Times'' (May 18 ), cited in part in Kingsley (1989) pp. 121-123</ref> Although they appeared to meet Unionists half way, Hume and those who joined him in what he proposed would be \"the emergence of normal politics\" presented the Unionist government with a new challenge. Drawing on the struggle for black equality in the United States, they spoke a language of universal rights that had an international resonance far beyond that of the particularist claims of Irish nationalism. \n\nSince 1964, the [[Campaign for Social Justice]] had been collating and publicising evidence of discrimination in employment and housing. From April 1967 the cause was taken up by the Belfast-based [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]].

Irish commemorative postage stamp, 2015]]O'Neill had not disguised an ambition to bring the politics as well as the economy of Northern Ireland \"into the twentieth century.\" In January 1965, at O'Neill personal invitation, the ''[[taoiseach]]'' [[Sean Lemass]] (whose government was pursuing a similar \"modernising\" agenda in the South) made an unheralded visit to Stormont. After O'Neill reciprocated with a visit to Dublin, the Nationalists were persuaded, for the first time, to assume the role at Stormont of [[Her Majesty's Opposition]]. With this and other conciliatory gestures (unprecedented visits to a Catholic hospitals and schools, flying the Union flag at half mast for the death of [[Pope John XXIII]]) O'Neill incurred the wrath of those he understood as \"self-styled 'loyalists' who see moderation as treason, and decency as weakness,\"<ref>O'Neill (1969), p. 123</ref> among these the Reverend [[Ian Paisley]]. \n\nAs Moderator of his own [[Free Presbyterian Church]], and at a time when he believed mainline presbyteries were being led down a \"Roman road\" by the [[Irish Council of Churches]], Paisley saw himself treading in the path of the \"greatest son\" of [[Presbyterian Church of Ireland|Irish Presbyterianism]], Dr. [[Henry Cooke (minister)|Henry Cooke]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ianpaisley.org/revivalist/1980/Rev80mar.htm/|title=Exit Dr. Craig the Evangelical - Enter Dr. Craig the Ecumenical|website=ianpaisley.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>  Like Cooke, Paisley was alert to [[ecumenicism]] \"both political and ecclesiastical.\" After the Lemass meeting, Paisely announced that \"the Ecumenists . . . are selling us out. Every Ulster Protestant must unflinchingly resist these leaders and let it be known in no uncertain manner that they will not sit idly by as these modern [[Robert Lundy|Lundies]] pursue their policy of treachery.\" Paisley had his own ideas of a \"third force\" in Ulster politics.

There was to be a needs-based points system for public housing; an ombudsman to investigate citizen grievances; universal franchise in council elections (\"One man, one vote\"); and The Londonderry Corporation was suspended and replaced by Development Commission. The Special Powers Act was to be reviewed. \n\nAt a [[Downing Street]] summit on 4 November, [[Harold Wilson]] had warned O'Neill that his government could not \"tolerate a situation in which the liberalising trend was being retarded rather than accelerate,\" and that if that were the case they might \"feel compelled to propose a radical course involving the complete liquidation of all financial agreement with Northern Ireland.\" The British Prime Minister muttered darkly about how, with British subsidy, the major Belfast employers, [[Shorts]], the aircraft manufacturer, and [[Harland and Wolff]], the shipyard, \"had become a kind of soup kitchen.\"<ref>quoted in Prince and Warner (2019), p. 99</ref>\n\nWith members of his cabinet urging him to call Wilson's \"bluff,\" and facing a [[Backbencher]] motion of no-confidence, in January 1969 O'Neill called a [[1969 Northern Ireland general election| general election]]. Having reminded his television audience that under the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] \"the supreme authority of the Parliament of the United Kingdom [remained] unaffected and undiminished over all persons, matters and things\" in Northern Ireland, O'Neill employed the talking points supplied by Wilson. \n<blockquote>I make no apology for the financial and economic support we have received from Britain.

And those who talk so glibly about acts of impoverished defiance do not know or care what is at stake. Your job if you are a worker at Shorts or Harland and Wolff; your subsidies if you are a farmer; your pension if you are retired; all these aspects of our life, and many others depend on support from Britain.

This rights-based perspective drew on what, internationally, proved to be the most compelling account of a conflict that over thirty years took more than 3,600 lives, and injured and bereaved many thousands more. This places at the heart of the conflict the movement for the \"civil rights of the Catholic/Nationalist community.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Civil Rights and Peace Agreements |last=Bell |first=Chirstine|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=33}}</ref> It is the belief that many in that community came to support or acquiesce in the Republican return to \"physical force\" in 1970-71 because, in the words of [[Eamonn McCann]], the notion that it was possible to achieve full citizenship within the North \"was beaten out of people's heads by the cops and their semi-official auxiliaries.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=McCann: War and Peace in Northern Ireland |last=McCann |first=Eamonn |year=1998 |publisher=Hot Press Books |location=Dublin|page=145}}</ref><ref>See also {{Cite book|title=From Civil Rights to Armalites: Derry and the Birth of the Irish Troubles |last=) Dochtartaigh |first=Nail|year=1997|publisher=Cork University Press |location=Cork}} </ref> \n\nAs an account of The Troubles, this is consistent with the broad support that the two main nationalist parties expressed for the provision in the Agreement for a possible Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland. As a party that \"has its origins in the civil rights movement\", Hume's [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP) maintained that it had \"been a consistent voice [often the solitary voice] calling for effective protection of the human rights of all.\"<ref>SDLP (2001), ''A Bill of Rights for All of US: Submission to the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Commission on a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland'', SDLP Policy Paers, p. 1</ref> As the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] had begun to explore a negotiated settlement with the British government, they too had laid claim to the civil rights legacy. Already in the mid-1980s [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] President [[Gerry Adams]] was pointing to the involvement of the [[Wolfe Tone Societies|Wolf Tone Clubs]] in [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association|NICRA]], and arguing that human rights had always been an integral part of the republican struggle.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Politics of Irish Freedom |last=Adams |first=Gerry |year=1986 |publisher=Brandon Books|isbn=0863220843 |page=12}}</ref>\n\nGiven that it appears to extenuate the republican resort to terrorism, Unionists have tended to reject the civil-rights account of the Troubles in almost every particular. in the late 1960s [[Ian Paisley|Paisley]] was not alone is dismissing talk of civil rights as much \"cant\" behind which stood preparations for a renewed armed campaign. There was broad Unionist belief that the civil rights movement's demand for \"simple justice\" or, as was often presented in the metropolitan press, for \"British standards\", was \"largely a charade,\" and that what was really \"going on\" was a \"modern version of the old battle between nationalities.\"<ref>Utley (1975), p. 35</ref>\n\nWhile they might concede \"that several abuses of normal civil right did occur under the Stormont government\", unionists argue that nationalists greatly exaggerated their impact upon the Catholic community.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Demonisation of the Protestant Community |last=Gudgin |first=Graham |year=1997 |publisher=The Ulster Society|location = Belfast) |page=4}}</ref><ref>See also \"Stormont discrimination of Catholics hugely exaggerated says David Trimble\", ''Irish News'', 13 October 2018. https://www.irishnews.com/news/2018/10/13/news/stormont-discrimination-of-catholics-hugely-exaggerated-says-david-trimble-s-ex-aide-1457251/</ref> Paul Kingsley's frequently cited \"loyalist analysis of the Civil Rights controversy\" maintains that, to the limited extent they occurred, the abuses protested by NICRA were as nothing compared to the profounder disadvantages for Catholic community represented by the nationalist policy of non-participation in public affairs (\"much of the blame must fall on those who behaved as if they were not citizens at all\")<ref>Biggs-Davison (1973), p. 143</ref> and by the \"structural\" characteristics of low social status, of larger families and lower education attainment.<ref>Kingsley (1994), pp, 54-75</ref><ref>See also Alcock (1994), pp. 85-86</ref>\n\nThe real interest behind the agitation for civil rights in Kingsley's account, is the social and political ambition of an emergent Catholic middle class (beneficiaries of the 1947 Education Act). Through the polemic of civil rights those who wished to pursue careers in law, public administration and elective office found release from the self-denying nationalist ordinances of non-recognition and abstention. They could represent themselves \"as people who were heroically breaking down the barriers of discrimination: the promoters of Catholic group interests rather than traitors to the cause.\" \"The political necessity to find a way to get the Catholic middle class into positions of influence,\" Kingsley argues, \"meant that the discrimination argument had to be brought to the fore\".<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 125</ref>\n\nIf not from the outset, then by the summer of 1968 as republicans and left-wing militants took the initiative, \"civil rights leaders\" also came to realise the ability of their campaign \"to convince the British government of the moral superiority of the Catholics position\", and to \"win changed which would be of symbolic importance.\" These in turn would \"undermine Unionist self-confidence, and open the way for further demands\".<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 137</ref> On the street this was the calculation that urged a strategy of tension: provoking violent reactions from an ill-prepared police force and the \"entirely predictable\" and--Kingsley and other unionist commentators<ref>Gregory Campbell (2018), \"Working-class protestants feared what civil rights movement would become\", ''News Letter'', 5 October. https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/gregory-campbell-working-class-protestants-feared-what-civil-rights-movement-would-become-1-8657612</ref> allow--\"ill disciplined\" and \"ferocious\", intrusions into the picture of Protestant mobs, ever anxious to lend the authorities a hand in teaching \"the rebels\" a lesson. If inadvertently, the civil-rights agitation fostered the perceptions of deteriorating security and legitimacy that contributed not only to the introduction of British troops (August 1969) but also, over the course of 1970-71, to the ascendancy within IRA-Sinn F\u00e9in of an ultra-nationalist [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|\"Provisional\" wing]] committed to a return to republicanism's \"physical force\" tradition.<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 172-198</ref><ref>See also Nelson McCausland (2018), \"Why unionists must ensure that the true origins of the civil rights movement are not forgotten\".

They depended on their capacities and strength of political will alone to ensure Northern Ireland remained a part of the Union. What ensued was a dialectic of stubborn self-righteousness within Northern Ireland between unionist and nationalist. It was sponsored on the one hand by a British government equivocal about the integrity of its own state, thereby encouraging unionist intolerance founded on insecurity; and an Irish government hypocritically and irresponsibly playing the [[irridentism|irredentist]] card, thereby encouraging Catholic alienation from the state and helping to provoke those very features of the Stormont regime which it smugly condemned.<ref>Aughey (1995), pp. 9-10</ref></blockquote>\n\nBritish equivocation, in this view, proved disastrous when the tensions to which it had contributed to in Northern Ireland finally exploded. Had the British Government been willing from 1968/69 to act on the proposition that Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom, their response would have been \"fundamentally different.\" If they had thought there were social and political grievances which were remediable by law, it would have been seen as the business of Parliament in Westminster to act. But acts of rebellion would have been suppressed and punished as such with the full authority and force of the state. At no point would the policy have been one of containment and negotiation. <blockquote>It is scarcely conceivable . . . that in a state of civil disturbance in Britain large parts of Birmingham or Manchester would have been allowed for months on to become rebel enclaves to which the police and the army were denied access. It would have been quite incredible also that, at a time when the lawful authorities still had overwhelming force at their disposal, the leaders of a rebellion in Warwickshire or Lancashire would have been given safe conducts to London to discuss conditions of peace.<ref>Utley (1975), pp. 15-16</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe example of [[Free Derry]] was replicated in other nationalist neighbourhoods both in Derry and in Belfast.

The problem of accommodating that minority within the political of Northern Ireland has to some extent been an aspect of a wider problem within Ireland as a whole.\n\nIt is therefore clearly desirable that any new arrangements for Northern Ireland should, whilst meeting the wishes of Northern Ireland and Great Britain, be so far as possible acceptable to accepted by the Republic of Ireland.\n\nNorthern Ireland must and will remain part of the United Kingdom for as long as that is the wish of a majority of the people, but that status does not preclude the necessary taking into account of what has been described in this paper as the 'Irish Dimension.'\n\nA Northern Ireland assembly or authority must be capable of involving all its members constructively in way which satisfy them and hose they represent that the whole community has a part to pay in the government of the Province. ...[T]here are strong arguments that the objective of real participation should be achieved by giving minority interests a share in the exercise of executive power ...<ref>{{cite book|last=Northern Ireland Office|year=1972|title=Green Paper: The Future of Northern Ireland|pages=140|location=London|publisher= HMSO|}} quoted in Kingsley (1989), pp. 230-231</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn June 1973 [[Proportional Representation|PR]] elections were held for an Assembly. Following negotiations at Sunningdale in England, attended by the Dublin government, on 1 January 1974 the former Unionist prime minister Brian Faulkner agreed to form an Executive in coalition with the SDLP and the smaller \"cross-community\" [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]]. Faulkner's later successor as party leader, [[James Molyneaux]], argued that the difficulty for most unionists  was not an arrangement in which \"Protestants and Catholics must consent\"--that \"would be comparatively simple.\" It was that, despite a promise not share power with parties \"whose ''primary'' aim is a united Ireland\",<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first= Barry|year=1984|title=John Hume: Statesman of the Troubles|location=Belfast|publisher= Blackstaff Press|isbn=9780856403170|pages=140}}</ref> Faulkner had committed them to agreement with \"Republican Catholics\" <ref>Interview with James Molyneaux, 18 May 1982 quoted in {{cite book|last=O'Malley|first= Padraig |year=1983|title=The Uncivil Wars: Ireland Today|pages=17, 26, 39|location=Boston|publisher= Houghton Mifflin|isbn=039534414X}}</ref> \n\nHaving drawn on both the [[Republican Labour Party|Republican]], and [[Northern Ireland Labour Party|Northern Ireland, Labour]] parties, and with a commitment to \"accommodate progressive Protestants,\"  the SDLP had announced themselves as something more than nationalist or republican party.<ref>{{cite book|last=Devlin|first= Paddy|year=1993|title=Straight Left: an Autobiography|location=Belfast|publisher= Blackstaff Press|isbn=0856405140|pages=191}}</ref> But with PIRA continuing to draw on fury over internment and Bloody Sunday, Eamonn McCann notes that \"in order to sell the deal to the Catholic community the SDLP had to present it not just as a means of expressing its aspiration towards a united Ireland but a means of achieving it\".<ref>McCann (1980), p. 141</ref> The new Health and Social Service Minister, [[Paddy Devlin]], conceded that \"all other issues were governed\" by a drive to \"get all-Ireland institutions established\" that would \"produce the dynamic that would lead ultimately to an agreed united Ireland.\"<ref>Devlin, p. 205</ref> \n\nThe [[Sunningdale Agreement]] envisaged a Council of Ireland comprising, with equal delegations from Dublin and Belfast, a Council of Ministers with \"executive and harmonising functions\" and a Consultative Assembly with \"advisory and review functions.\" As they would only have a plurality of representation on the Northern side, these created the possibility of Unionists being manoeuvred into a minority position. \"In retrospect\", Devlin regretted his party had not \"adopted a two stage approach, by allowing power sharing at Stormont to establish itself\",<ref>Devlin, p. 252</ref> but by the time he and his colleagues recognised the damage they had caused to Faulkner's position by prioritising the \"Irish Dimension\" it was too late. \n\nWithin a week of taking office as First Minister, opposition to the Sunningdale proposals forced Faulkner to resign as UUP leader. In a [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|surprise Westminster election]] at the end of February, his new pro-Agreement grouping, the [[Unionist Party of Northern Ireland]], was rolled over by a [[United Ulster Unionist Coalition]] in which the bulk of his old party stood with William Craig's [[Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party|Ulster Vanguard]] and Paisley's new electoral vehicle, the [[Democratic Unionist Party|Democratic Unionists]]. Arguing that they had deprived Faulkner of any semblance of a mandate, the victors called for new Assembly elections. \n\nWhen on 14 May the Assembly defeated a motion rejecting the Sunningdale Agreement, Harry Murray, the shipyard convener for the [[Ulster Workers' Council]] (UWC), a loyalist labour coalition, announced a general strike. Within two weeks the UWC, supported by the [[Ulster Defence Association]] and UVF paramilitaries, had an effective stranglehold on energy supplies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Don|year=1994|title=Fourteen May Days: The Inside Story of the Loyalist Strike of 1974|location=Dublin|publisher=Gill & Macmillan|isbn=0717121771}}</ref> Concessions sought by Faulkner were blocked by the SDLP.

From the UUP's James Molyneaux there were the familiar objections to \"something very far removed from straightforward democracy\" and which could give republicans an effective \"veto.\"  But with Paisley calling on unionists not to \"lose sight\" of an opportunity for the \"Ulster people\" to \"freely elect their own Assembly and to begin to bring Direct Rule to account\", there was not blanket rejection.<ref>O'Mally (1983), pp. 372-373</ref> That was to come from nationalists.\n\nJohn Hume dismissed the initiative as \"insulting.\" Not only did it imply, with the 70 percent hurdle, a very much higher degree of unionist unanimity and consent than was required in 1973, it suggested that, for the present at least, the Irish Dimension\" would have adequate \"institutional expression\" in continuing \"intergovernmental\" exchanges with Dublin--then at a low point following the [[1981 Irish hunger strike|PIRA Hunger Strike]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=John|year=2003|title= 'Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two: The Iron Lady|location=London|publisher= Jonathan Cape|pages=426}}</ref> Seconded by the Dublin government, SDLP insisted that without of \"a very strong and positive and concrete expression of the Irish identity\" the proposals were unworkable.<ref>O'Mally (1983), pp. 368-369</ref> \n\nThere were other calculations in an initiative that, in the wake of the Hunger Strike, had the potential to deflect criticism not only from the Republic but also from the United States,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bew|first1=Paul|last2=Patterson|first2=Henry|year=1985|title= The British State and the Ulster Crisis: From Wilson to Thatcher|location=London|publisher= Verso Books|isbn=978-0860918158|pages=112}}</ref><ref>Wichert (1991), pp. 194-195.</ref> but in 1985 the British government appeared to reverse tack. With the [[Taoiseach|Irish Taoiseach]], [[Garret FitzGerald]] Thatcher signed an agreement that projected not rolling devolution but a rolling Irish Dimension. An [[British\u2013Irish Intergovernmental Conference|Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference]] would invite the Irish government to \"put forward views on proposals\" for major legislation concerning Northern Ireland, and this Conference would have a permanent [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]], including officials from the Republic's [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Ireland)|Department of Foreign Affairs]], quartered in Northern Ireland itself. Proposals from The Irish government would be entertained, however, only on \"matters [that] are not the responsibility of a devolved administration in Northern Ireland.\" If unionists wished to limit Dublin's influence, the suggestion was that they would have to climb down from their insistence of \"simple majority rule\" and think again as to how nationalists could be accommodated at Stormont.<ref>{{cite book|last=Aughey|first=Arthur|year=1989|title= Under Siege: Ulster Unionism and the Anglo-Irish Agreement|location=Belfast|publisher= Blacksaff Press}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ulster Says No poster.svg|100px|left|Campaign against the Anglo-Irish Agreement]]\nThe unionist reaction, Thatcher recalled in her memoirs, was \"worse than anyone had predicted to me\".<ref>Margaret Thatcher, ''The Downing Street Years'' (London: HarperCollins, 1993), p. 403.</ref> The [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) and [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) led an \"Ulster says No\"  campaign against the Agreement, that included strikes, [[civil disobedience]] and a mass resignation of unionist MPs from Westminster and suspensions of district council meetings.<ref name=aia>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/aia/chron.htm Anglo-Irish Agreement \u2013 Chronology of Events] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206111841/http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/aia/chron.htm |date=2 June 2019}} [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN).

Party]] led by [[Arlene Foster]], followed by the more moderate [[Ulster Unionist Party]] led by [[Robin Swann]]. Both parties are active across [[Northern Ireland]]. On a smaller level, the [[Progressive Unionist Party]], which is the political wing of the [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1966)|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) paramilitary group, attracts some support in the greater Belfast area. [[Traditional Unionist Voice]] is opposed to the current constitutional arrangements in Northern Ireland following the [[Belfast Agreement]] and [[St Andrews Agreement]]. The pluralist [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] is currently allied to the Ulster Unionist Party. While the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]] supports the status quo position of Northern Ireland, it does not define itself as Unionist.\n\nModerate unionists who support the principle of [[Equal Citizenship]] between Northern Ireland and Great Britain have campaigned for mainstream British political parties to organise and contest elections in Northern Ireland. Equal citizenship pressure groups have included the [[Campaign for Equal Citizenship]] (CEC), [[Labour Representation Campaign]], [[Democracy Now (UK pressure group)|Democracy Now]] and, currently, [[Labour - Federation of Labour Groups]]. Momentum for this concept picked up after the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Party Conference voted in favour of working in Northern Ireland in 1989.

While nationalism has had a number of Protestant leaders (for instance, [[Henry Grattan]], [[Theobald Wolfe Tone]], [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and [[Douglas Hyde]]), unionism was invariably always led by Protestant leaders and politicians. Prior to a decades-long ban, Catholics had been allowed to be members of the UUP as recently as the 1920s, including [[Denis Henry]] (the first [[Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland]]), who was a member of the UUP from its foundation in 1905 and a UUP MP for [[South Londonderry (UK Parliament constituency)|South Londonderry]].

However, a strong decline in the Catholic birthrate may slow down or even reverse the growth in the Catholic population (which may in turn be balanced by an increased rate of emigration of young Protestants, often to study and work in Great Britain). Recent influxes of immigrants, especially from Eastern Europe, are also having a significant effect on the demographic balance, although how many choose to reside permanently in Northern Ireland or take an interest in the political scene remains to be seen.\n\n===Ties to Unionism in Scotland===\nThere is some degree of social and political co-operation between some [[Unionism in Scotland|Scottish unionists]] and Northern Irish unionists, due to their similar aims of maintaining the unity of their [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent country]] with the United Kingdom. For example, the [[Orange Order]] parades in Orange Walks in Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, many unionists in Scotland shy away from connections to unionism in Ireland in order not to endorse any side of a largely sectarian conflict. This brand of unionism is largely concentrated in the [[Central Belt]] and west of Scotland. [[Loyalist]]s in Scotland are seen as a militant or extreme branch of [[British unionism|unionism]]. Orangism in west and central Scotland, and opposition to it by [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] in Scotland, can be explained as a result of the large amount of immigration from the Republic and Northern Ireland.\n\nSongs and symbols of unionism, particularly of the Northern Irish variety, are used by many supporters of [[Rangers F.C.]], a football club based in [[Glasgow]]. Both Rangers and their longtime rival [[Celtic F.C.]], which has Irish Roman Catholic roots, have a reputation for [[sectarian]] clashes and bitter opposition to each other, frequently characterised by religious taunts, chants and other provocations. This behaviour by some supporters is condemned by the management of the clubs. Despite the symbols associated with the clubs, not all Rangers supporters can be automatically classified as unionists, nor all Celtic supporters as nationalists. For example, there were Celtic supporters of the \"No Thanks\" campaign for the 2014 independence referendum and Rangers supporters of the \"Yes Scotland\" campaign- despite Celtic FC having nationalist origins and Rangers FC having unionist origins. There was found to be no link between support of left and right-wing parties at general elections for Rangers or Celtic fans either.\n\n==Unionists in southern Ireland 1891\u20131922 {{anchor|Irish unionism}}==\n\n{{main|Irish Unionist Alliance#Southern Unionists}}\n\nAfter 1890, and particularly during the period from the start of the [[First World War]] to the mid-1920s, the number of Unionists in what is now the [[Republic of Ireland]] declined to a point where their numbers were widely regarded as almost insignificant.<ref>McDowell, R.B. ''Crisis and Decline: The Fate of the Southern Unionists''. The Lilliput Press (1998).</ref> This is attributed to a number of factors:\n* [[Land reform]] from the 1870s to the 1900s, arranged by the [[Irish Land Commission|Land Commission]]. This broke up many of the large Protestant-owned estates, many of whose former owners chose in the 1920s to use their compensation money to settle in Britain, often in other estates that they owned there.\n* The disestablishment of the [[Church of Ireland]] in 1871. This led the Church to sell many of its properties, in the process laying off many Protestant workers who subsequently moved away.\n* The [[Irish War of Independence]] and its aftermath. During the War, some elements of the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) allegedly conducted a campaign of murder and [[ethnic cleansing]] against Unionists in parts of the country such as Cork. Historians disagree as to whether such murders were isolated incidents or parts of a wider organised campaign.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Attacks continued in the 1920s against many Unionists who had assisted the British in the War, and in the process 300 historic homes were burned. Such attacks were said to be reprisals for the British forces' destruction of the homes and property of [[Irish republicanism|republicans]], actual or suspected.\n* Emigration. Large numbers of Unionists left Ireland (voluntarily or otherwise) in the years before and after independence, mainly for [[Northern Ireland]], Great Britain and Canada.\n* Assimilation. Many of the Unionists who remained [[cultural assimilation|assimilated]] to some extent into the majority nationalist culture.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} This was encouraged by the [[Irish Free State|Free State]] government, and was largely accepted with resignation. The process was accelerated by the pro-Free State stance taken by most Unionists in the [[Irish Civil War]]. The process of assimilation had begun prior to Irish independence, with a number of [[Protestant Nationalist]]s playing leading roles in the [[Irish nationalist]] and [[Gaelic revival]] movements.\n* Intermarriage and the ''Ne Temere'' decree. Unionists were and are {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} largely Protestant, and in many mixed households the children were brought up as Catholics, often because of family or community pressure and the 1908 papal ''[[Ne Temere]]'' decree. There was also a high number of single, unmarried female Unionists in the aftermath of World War I who could not find Protestant husbands.<ref>See Bence-Jones, Mark ''Twilight of the Ascendancy\" Constable, London 1993 {{ISBN|978-0-09-472350-4}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[President of Ireland]], [[Douglas Hyde]] (1938\u20131945) was Protestant, though only two senior Irish politicians attended his Church of Ireland funeral; the Catholic members of the government had to wait on the pavement near the Church to be compliant with [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]].\n\nSome Unionists in the south simply adapted and began to associate themselves with the new southern Irish regime of [[Cumann na nGaedheal]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} On 19 January 1922, leading Unionists held a meeting and unanimously decided to support the Free State government.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Many gained appointment to the Free State's Senate, including the [[Windham Wyndham-Quin, 4th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl|4th Earl of Dunraven]] and [[Thomas Westropp Bennett]].

The overwhelming sentiment of a once ascendant minority [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestant population]], in the decades following [[Catholic Emancipation]] (1829) it mobilised to oppose the restoration of an [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish parliament]]. As \"Ulster unionism,\" in the century since [[Partition of Ireland|Partition]] (1921), its commitment has been to the retention within the United Kingdom of the six Ulster counties of [[Northern Ireland]]. Within the framework of a [[Northern Ireland peace process|peace settlement for Northern Ireland]], since 1998 unionists have reconciled to sharing office with [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] in a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] administration, while continuing to rely on the connection with Great Britain to secure their cultural and economic interests.\n\n==Irish Unionism 1800-1904==\n\n===The Act of Union 1800===\n[[File:Battle of Ballynahinch (2).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Detail from The [[Battle of Ballynahinch]] 1798 by Thomas Robinson. Government Yeomanry prepare to hang a United Irish insurgent, Hugh McCulloch, a grocer.]]\n\nIn the last decades of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] (1542-1800) [[Protestants]] in public life advanced themselves as \"Irish patriots.\"  Their patriotism focused upon an [[Protestant Ascendancy|Ascendancy]] [[Parliament of Ireland|parliament in Dublin]]. Confined on a narrow franchise to communicants of the ([[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]]) [[Church of Ireland]], the parliament denied equal protection and public office both to Protestant \"[[Dissenters]]\" and to the Kingdom's dispossessed [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] majority. The high point of this parliamentary patriotism was the formation during the [[American War of Independence]], of the [[Irish Volunteers (18th century)|Irish Volunteers]] and, as that militia drilled and paraded, the securing in 1782 of the parliament's legislative independence from [[British Privy Council]] in London.\n\nIn [[Presbyterian]] [[Ulster]], where confident in their own numbers Protestants looked upon the Catholic interest with relative equanimity, combinations of tradesmen, merchants, and tenant farmers protested against a parliament that continued in the service of the Kingdom's greatest proprietors and of an executive in [[Dublin Castle]] still appointed, through the office of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], by English ministers.  \nDespairing of reform and emboldened by the [[French Revolution]], these United Irishmen determined that \"if the men of property will not support us, they must fall,\" and that if they were to fall that \"Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter\u201d should unite \"to break the connection with England.\" Such [[Jacobin]] resolve was broken upon the wheel of their [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 uprising]], an insurrection joined in the south by Catholic peasantry.'''\n\nThe British government, that had had to deploy its own forces to suppress the rebellion and to turn back and defeat French intervention, resolved upon a Union. For the chief of Castle executive [[Lord Castlereagh]], the principal merit of a bringing Ireland directly under the British constitution was a resolution of what was ultimately the key issue for the governance of the country, the Catholic question.:<ref>John Bew, Castlereagh. Enlightenment, War and Tyranny. Quercas. London 2012. P. 127</ref>\n<blockquote>Linked with England, the Protestants, feeling less exposed, would be more confident and liberal; and the Catholics would have less inducement to look beyond that indulgence which is consistent with the security of our establishment.<ref>Castlereagh to Sir Laurence Parsons, 28 November 1798, Castlereagh Correspondence, vol. 11, pp. 32-35</ref>\n</blockquote>\nHowever, opposition from within this \"establishment,\" and not least from the King, [[King George III|George III]], obliged Castlereagh to defy what he saw as \"the very logic of the Union.\"<ref>Bew (2012). p.126</ref> The Union bill that, with a generous distribution of titles and emoluments, he put through the Irish Parliament omitted the provision for Catholic emancipation. A separate Irish executive in Dublin was retained, but representation, still wholly Protestant, was transferred to Westminster constituted as the Parliament of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].\n\nIn decades that followed the [[Acts of Union 1800|Act of Union (1800)]] Protestants of every sectarian persuasion and class reconciled to the loss of an Irish parliament. The legislative union with [[Great Britain]] was seen to not only to occasion their relative prosperity but, as the Roman Catholic majority in Ireland began to stir and gather in a new national movement, also to guarantee their \"liberty.\"\n\n===Catholic Emancipation and the emergence of Nationalist Ireland===\n[[File:Catholic ascendency.jpg|thumb|right|Catholic Emancipation as a world turned upside down: held aloft, Daniel O'Connell promises whigs--symbol of Ascendancy rank and property--for \"ye all.\"]]\nIt took the Union thirty years to deliver on the promise of [[Catholic Emancipation]] (1829)\u2014to admit Catholics to Parliament--and permit an erosion of the Protestant monopoly on position and influence.

Caricature 1881.]]\nIn December 1885, the [[Liberal Party]] leader [[William Ewart Gladstone]] announced his conversion to a compromise that had been prepared by O\u2019Connell prior to his death in 1847. Ireland would have a measure of \u201chome rule\u201d within the United Kingdom.\n\nUp to, and through, the great starvation, the [[Irish Famine]], of the 1840s, successive governments, Whig and Tory, had maintained a studied indifference to the systemic consequences in Ireland of peasant dispossession and unchecked landlordism. The issues of a low-level agrarian war came to [[Westminster]] in 1852. In a direct challenge to the landed-interest [[Irish Conservative Party]], what the [[Young Ireland]]er Gavan Duffy optimistically described as the \u201c[[Tenant Right League|League of North and South]]\u201d returned 50 tenant-rights MPs. For unionism the more momentous challenge lay in the wake of the [[1867 Reform Act]]. In Great Britain it produced an electorate that no longer identified instinctively with the landed interest. In Ireland, where it more than doubled in size, in 1874 the electorate returned 59 Members for the [[Home Rule League]] who were to sit as the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP). Of these, only two were returned from Ulster (from the border county of Cavan): \"Ulster protestants, as a body, were as strongly opposed to home rule as they had been to repeal.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Making of Modern Ireland 1603-1923|last=Beckett|first=J.C.|publisher=Faber & Faber|year=1966|isbn=0-571-09267-5|location=London|pages=381}}</ref>\n\nThe Home Rule League was led nonetheless by the son of a Church of Ireland rector and an Ulsterman. [[Isaac Butt]] had been seduced from his commitments to the Conservative Party and Orange Order by the failure of the Union to give famine-stricken Cork the relief that he believed would have been given Cornwall. In the British [[House of Commons]] Butt was seconded by another maverick from the north, a Catholic convert, [[Joseph Biggar]]. Biggar led an aggressive form of obstructionism that deliberately courted the judgement that as a body the IPP was \u201cpractically foreign\u201d and \u201cvalued its place in the House only as a means of making itself so-disagreeable as to obtain its release.\u201d<ref>James Bryce, \u201cHow we became Home-Rulers.\u201d ''The Contemporary Review''. Vol. LI. May 1887, pp. 736-756. p.740</ref>\n\nGladstone in his first ministry (1868-1874) attempted conciliation. In [[Disestablishment of the Church of Ireland|1869 the Church of Ireland was disestablished]] and in 1870 a [[Land Acts (Ireland)|Land Act]] acknowledged for the first time a political responsibility for agrarian conditions. But spurred by the collapse of agricultural prices in the [[Long Depression]], the [[Land War]] intensified. From 1879 it was organised by the direct-action [[Irish National Land League]], led by another of Butt's lieutenants (and who, like Butt, bestowed upon the Nationalist movement \"a deceptively ecumenical air\") the southern (albeit half-American) Protestant [[Charles Stewart Parnell]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Atlas of Irish History|last=Duffy|first=Sean|publisher=Gill & Macmillan|year=1997|isbn=0-7171-2479-7|location=Dublin|pages=106}}</ref>  As late as 1881 Gladstone resorted (over a 41-hour [[filibuster]] by IPP) to a Coercion Act allowing for arbitrary arrest and detention in protection of \u201cperson and property.\u201d\n\nThe final and decisive shift in favour of constitutional concessions came in the wake of the [[Representation of the People Act 1884|Third Reform Act of 1884]]. The near-universal admission to the suffrage of male heads of household tripled the electorate in Ireland. The 1885 election returned an IPP of 85 Members (including 17 from Catholic-majority areas of Ulster), marshalled now under the leadership of Parnell. Gladstone, whose Liberals lost all 15 of their Irish seats, was able to form his second ministry only with their Commons support.\n\n===Reaction to Gladstone\u2019s Home Rule Bills===\n[[File:Unionist Convention 1892 (3).jpg|thumb|left|\"God Save the Queen\" \"Erin Go Bragh\" Ulster Unionist Convention, Belfast, 1892]]\nThe [[Government of Ireland Bill 1886|Government of Ireland Bill]] that Gladstone tabled in June 1886 incorporated what he imagined were assurances for Unionism. The 200 or so popularly elected members of the \u201cIrish Legislative Body\u201d would sit in session with 28 [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish Peers]] and a further 75 Members elected on a highly restrictive property franchise. The anticipated result might have been rough nationalist-unionist parity.\n\nWhat was clear to unionists was that Ireland was being put out of the United Kingdom. The \u201cImperial Parliament\u201d in London would retain sovereignty (\u201cdevolving\u201d powers to Dublin) but no Irish representation. What was proposed was a proximate restoration of the constitution of the Kingdom of Ireland as it had existed before 1782\u2014a colonial legislature in Dublin with an executive accountable to London through the Lord Lieutenant. But it was with arrangements for representation in Ireland on terms, and in an era, that unionists feared could only march in one direction--toward majority rule and total separation.\n\nThe alarm among Protestants appeared to surmount all previous distinctions of party or class and, in addition to express fears of \"[[Rome Rule]],\" spoke to their growing material concerns. These were not only those of the existential struggles in the countryside over land and rent. The upper and middle classes found in Britain and the Empire \"a wide range of profitable careers--in the army, in the public services, in commerce--from which they might be shut out if the link between Ireland and Great Britain were weakened or severed.\"<ref>Beckett (1966), pp. 398-399</ref> That same link was critical for all those engaged in the great export industries of the North--textiles, engineering, shipbuilding--for whom the Irish hinterland was less present than Clydeside or the North of England.\n\nFor Protestant workers there was the concern that Home Rule would force accommodation of the growing numbers of Catholics arriving at mill and factory gates from the outlying country and western districts. While the plentiful supply of cheap labour helped attract the English and Scottish capital that employed them, Protestant workers organised to protect \u201ctheir\u201d jobs (a function performed in the skilled trades by the apprenticeship system) and tied housing. The once largely rural Orange Order was given a renewed lease and mandate.<ref>Foster (1988), pp. 389-390</ref> The pattern, in itself, was not unique to Belfast or its satellites. Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool and other British centres experiencing heavy Irish immigration developed similar nativist, and even Orange, ward and workplace politics<ref>{{Cite book|title=Irish Migrants in Modern Britain, 1750\u20131922|last=MacRaild|first=Donald|publisher=Macmillan|year=1999|isbn=978-0-312-22032-7|location=London}}</ref>--to which Irish Unionists made conscious appeal.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Irish Unionism 2: Ulster Unionism and the Origins of Northern Ireland 1886-1922|last=Buckland|first=Patrick|publisher=Gill & Macmillan|year=1973|location=London|pages=13}}</ref>\n\nGladstone's own party was split on Home Rule and the House divided against the measure. People were already battling on the streets when the news reached Belfast. The rumour among unionists was that [[1886 Belfast riots|the rioting]], which took upwards of fifty lives, had been triggered when a group of Catholic navvies, anticipating the Bill's passage, pushed a Protestant out of their dock, warning him that \"neither he nor any of his sort should get leave to work there, or earn a loaf there or any other place.\"<ref>Bardon (2008) p. 408</ref>\n\nIn 1891 Ulster's [[Liberal Unionists]], part of larger Liberal break with Gladstone, entered the [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] and at Westminster took the Conservative whip.\n\nIn 1892, despite bitter division, in which the Catholic hierarchy took a heavy hand, over the personally-compromised leadership of Parnell, the Nationalists were able to help Gladstone to a third ministry. The result was a second Home Rule bill. It was greeted by an Ulster opposition more highly developed and better organised.\n\nA great Ulster Unionist Convention was held in Belfast organised by the Liberal Unionist Thomas Sinclair, in earlier years \"an articulate critic of the Orange Ascendancy.\"<ref>Graham Walker (1996) \"Thomas Sinclair: Presbyterian Liberal Unionist\" ''Unionism in Modern Ireland''. Richard English, Graham Walker eds., Macmillan London. pp. 19-40. p. 20</ref> Speakers and observers dwelt on the diversity of creed, class and party represented among the 12,300 delegates attending. As reported by the [[Northern Whig]] there were \"the old tenant-righters of the 'sixties' . . . the sturdy reformers of Antrim. . . the Unitarians of Down, always progressive in their politics . . . the old-fashioned Tories of the Counties . . . modern Conservatives . . .  Orangemen . . .

The Conservatives formed a new ministry.\n\n===Constructive Unionism===\n[[File:Flag of the Congested Districts Board for Ireland (1893\u20131907).svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Congested Districts Board for Ireland]], 1893\u20131907]]\nThe new Prime Minister [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], who had expressed the view that \"free representative institutions\" are best confined to \"people who are of [[Nordic race|Teutonic race]],\" believed his government should \"leave Home Rule sleeping the sleep of the unjust.\"<ref>Bardon (2008). p. 418</ref> Irish Conservatives applauded when in 1887 Dublin Castle was given standing power to suspend [[habeas corpus]]. However, as Chief Secretary for Ireland, his nephew [[Gerald Balfour, 2nd Earl of Balfour|Gerald Balfour]], determined upon a \u201cconstructive\u201d course, pursuing reforms intended, as some saw it, to \u201ckill home rule with kindness.\u201d\n\nFor the express purpose of relieving poverty and reducing emigration, in the \u201c[[Congested Districts Board for Ireland|congested districts]]\u201d of the west Balfour initiated a programme not only of public works, but of subsidy for local craft industries. A new Department of Agriculture and Technical instruction broke with the traditions of Irish Boards by announcing that its aim was to \"be in touch with public opinion of the classes whom its work concerns, and to rely largely for its success upon their active assistance and co-operation.\"<ref>Good (1920). p, 210</ref> It supported and encouraged dairy cooperatives, the \"creameries\" that were to be an important institution in the emergence of a new class of independent smallholders.<ref>Bardon (2009) pp. 421-423</ref>\n\nGreater reform followed when, with the support of the splinter [[Liberal Unionist Party]], Salisbury returned to office in 1895. [[Land Acts (Ireland)|The Land Act of 1896]] introduced for the first time the principle of compulsory sale to tenants, through its application was limited to bankrupt estates. \u201cYou would suppose,\u201d said [[Sir Edward Carson]], Dublin barrister and the leading spokesman for Irish Conservatives, \u201cthat the Government were revolutionists verging on Socialism.\u201d.<ref>Good (1920), p. 209</ref> Having been first obliged to surrender their hold on local government (transferred at a stroke in 1898 to democratically-elected councils), the old landlord class had the terms of their retirement fixed by the [[Land Acts (Ireland)|Wyndham Land Act]] of 1903. They had ceased to be an effective social or political influence.\n\n==\"The Ulster Option\" 1905-1920==\n===\"The democracy of Ulster\"===\n[[File:Unionist clubs marching down Donegall Square North, Belfast, 9 April 1912 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Unionist march in Belfast, 9 April 1912]]\nIn 1905 the Ulster Unionist Council was established to represent all shades of unionism in the north. Until then, unionism had largely placed itself behind those of [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] landed interest that appeared to have the greatest pull at Westminster. The UUC still accorded a degree of precedence to aristocracy. Castlereagh's descendant and former Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the [[Charles Stewart Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 6th Marquess of Londonderry|Marquess of Londonderry]] presided over its Executive (and [[Edith Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Marchioness of Londonderry|Lady Londonderry]] over the Ulster Women's Unionist Council). The Council also retained the services of Carson, from 1892 MP for [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. But marshalled by Captain [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], a millionaire director of Belfast's [[Dunville & Co|Dunville Whiskey]], it was northern employers who were undertaking the real political and organisational work.\n\nThe manufacturers and merchants of Belfast and neighbouring industrial districts were, for the most part, of farming and Presbyterian stock and had little natural sympathy for the old landed interest.<ref>Good (1920), p. 227</ref> Crucially, while southern landowners had been politically at war with their tenants, northern employers could count on voting with the majority of their own workforce. For Nationalists this was a matter employers playing \"the Orange card.\" Employers did look to sectarian division to weaken labour protest, although Orangemen could not always be relied upon. In the great [[1907 Belfast Dock strike|Belfast Dock strike of 1907]], the [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] leader [[James Larkin]] was able to engage the support of the [[Independent Orange Order]].<ref>Collins, Peter (1998). \"Larkin, James\", S.J. Connolly, The Oxford Companion to Irish History. Oxford University Press. p. 302</ref> (In 1903 its founder, Tom Sloan, had been the only Unionist MP to vote for the Miners' Eight Hour bill).\n\nLoyalist workers were conscious, and resentful, of the imputation that they were the retainers of \u201cbig-house unionists.\u201d  A manifesto signed in the spring of 1914 by two thousand labour men, on behalf of the only \u201cfully organised and articulate\u201d trade unionists in Ireland, repudiated the suggestion of the radical and socialist press that Ulster was being manipulated by \u201can aristocratic plot.\u201d If Sir Edward Carson led in the battle for the Union it was \u201cbecause we, the workers, the people, the democracy of Ulster, have chosen him.\u201d  Chairman of the Boilermakers\u2019 Society, J. Hanna, insisted that it was as the \u201cfreemen and as members of the greatest democracy in Great Britain and Ireland, the organised trade unions of the country,\u201d that \u201cthey would not have Home Rule.\u201d<ref>John Biggs-Davison, ''The Hand is Red''. London, Johnson. 1973. P. 74</ref>\n\nThe difficulty for nationalists and for those, like [[James Connolly]], who believed that class solidarity should draw workers down the path of national independence, was that without having to break political ranks with their employers, workers were beginning to see that \u201cgreatest democracy\u201d was paying dividends. Thanks to the legislative union, in whose defence Unionists among them effectively voted Conservative, workers in Ireland were able to benefit from the majorities found \u201cacross the water\u201d for labour and social reform-\u2014under the a Liberal-majority government from 1906, for the [[Trade Disputes Act 1906]], for the [[National Insurance Act 1911]] and for the \u201c[[People's Budget]] 1911. \u00a0\n\nThe nationalist cause in the industrial North was not helped by those who suggested that collective bargaining, social security and progressive taxation were principles for which majorities would not be as readily found in a Dublin Parliament. Objecting to an \u201cinefficient and extravagant government . . . which had no parallel in Europe,\u201d ''[[Sinn Fein]]'' President [[Arthur Griffith]] proposed that \u201cimperialism and socialism\u2014forms of the cosmopolitan heresy and in essence one\u2014have offered man the material world. Nationalism has offered him a free soul<ref>\u201dPat Walsh (1994), ''Irish Republicanism and Socialism'', Belfast. Athol Press, p.12</ref> For Ulster workers, as for Ulster employers, there was interest and calculation in a common Unionism.\n\nIn an open letter to U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], in 1918 Edward Carson wrote:<ref>{{Cite book|title = Two Irelands Beyond the Sea: Ulster Unionism and America, 1880-1920|last = Flewelling|first = Lindsey|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2018|isbn = 978-1-78694-045-2|location = Oxford|pages = 73\u201374}}</ref><blockquote>The Ulstermen of to-day, forming as they do the chief industrial community in Ireland, are as devoted adherents to the cause of democratic freedom as were their forefathers in the eighteenth century.

A total of 234,046 women signed the Ulster Women's Declaration; 237,368 men signed the [[Ulster Covenant|Solemn League and Covenant]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Ulster Covenant|last=Gordon|first=Lucy|publisher=Ulster society|year=1989|location=Belfast}}</ref>\n\nUnionist women had been involved in political campaigning from the time of the first Home Rule Bill in 1886. Some were active [[suffragette]]s. [[Isabella Tod]], an anti-Home Rule Liberal and campaigner for girls education, was an early pioneer. In 1873 she founded the Northern Irish branch of the [[National Society for Women's Suffrage]]. Later, while still based in Belfast, this became the [[Irish Women's Suffrage Society]] publishing the weekly ''The Irish Citizen''.<ref>Courtney (2013). pp. 240-241</ref>\n\nNot all IWSS Unionists were impressed by the Women's Declaration. Elizabeth McCracken, a regular contributor to ''The Irish Citizen'' and the [[Belfast News Letter]] noted the failure Unionist women to formulate \"any demand on their own behalf or that of their own sex.\"<ref>History Ireland, Irish Suffragettes at the time of the Home Rule Crisis, https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/irish-suffragettes-at-the-time-of-the-home-rule-crisis/</ref> The Declaration, nonetheless, was a political affirmation of intent by women, organised and publicly staged by women--the Ulster Women's Unionist Council. Founded in January 1911, by 1913, with well over 100,000 members, the UWUC was the largest women's political group in Ireland.\n\nDetermined to \"sink all differences in favour of the Union,\" the UWUC avoided public comment on the suffrage question. But for many women signing the Council's Declaration was a first taste of political involvement. In September 1913 it appeared that the Unionist Council had determined it should not be their last. The Council informed the UWUC that \"the draft articles\" for a Provisional Government to be set up in the event of Home Rule being legislated \"include the franchise for women.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/irish-suffragettes-at-the-time-of-the-home-rule-crisis/|title=Irish Suffragettes at the time of the Home Rule Crisis|accessdate=8 March 2020|author=History Ireland}}</ref> The Irish Parliamentary Party made no such commitment for a Dublin parliament.  In contrast to Ulster Unionists who divided, in 1912 the Nationalists had voted as a block against a \"Conciliation\" Bill that would have conceded the principle of women suffrage, albeit on a highly restrictive property basis.<ref>Burke, Jason (2018), \"Carson's Betrayal of Women?

In 1912 the Prime Minister, [[Herbert Asquith]], introduced the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Third Home Rule Bill]]. A more generous dispensation than the earlier bills, it would, for the first time, have given an Irish parliament an accountable executive. It was carried in the Commons by a majority of ten. As expected, it was defeated in the Lords, but as result of the crisis engendered by the opposition of the peers to the 1909 People's Budget the Lords now only had the power of delay. Home Rule would become law in 1914.\n\nFrom the outset there had been discussion of giving \u201can option to Ulster.\u201d In response to the First Home rule Bill in 1886, \u201cRadical Unionists\u201d\u2014Liberals who proposed federalising the relationship between all countries of the United Kingdom\u2014argued that \u201cthe Protestant part of Ulster should receive special treatment . . . on grounds identical with those that support the general contention for Home Rule\u201d <ref>R. W. Dale, \u201cThe Liberal Party and Home Rule,\u201d 1887 784.</ref> In Ulster there was no interest in the federalists\u2019 idea of a Belfast legislature, but the riposte to nationalists remained. In summarising ''The Case Against Home Rule'' (1912),  L. S. Amery argued that against \u201cevery argument that can justify three million Nationalists asserting their national idea over a million Unionists\u201c is \u201cthe stubborn fact that if Irish Nationalism constitutes a nation, then Ulster is a nation too.\u201d <ref>Biggs-Davidson 78</ref>\n\nFaced with the eventual enactment of Home Rule, Carson appeared to press the point. On 28 September 1912, \u2018Ulster Day\u2019 he was the first to sign, in Belfast City Hall, [[Ulster Covenant|Ulster's Solemn League and Covenant]]<ref name=proni>{{cite web|url=http://www.proni.gov.uk/index/search_the_archives/ulster_covenant/ulster_day.htm|title=The Ulster Covenant: Ulster Day|accessdate=29 September 2012|author=[[PRONI]]}}</ref> binding its signatories \u201cto stand by one another in defending for ourselves and our children our position of equal citizenship in the United Kingdom, and in using all means which may be found necessary to defeat the present [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] to set up a Home Rule Parliament in Ireland.\u201d (The historic reference, widely understood, was to the sixteenth-century [[Covenanters|Scottish Covenants]] that had bound Presbyterians to defend in arms their reformed faith)\n\nIn January 1913, Carson declared for the exclusion of Ulster and called for the enlistment of up to 100,000 Covenanters as drilled and armed [[Ulster Volunteers]]. On September 23rd, the second Ulster Day, he accepted Chairmanship of a Provisional Government, elaborately organised by Craig.  If Home Rule were imposed \u201cwe will be governed as a conquered community and nothing else.\u201d <ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973). p. 79.</ref>\n\nFor Carson and for other southern Unionists the object of the gamble on Ulster\u2014with the surety of support from British Conservatives and possibly, following the [[Curragh Mutiny|incident at Curragh]], in the Army\u2014was to out manoeuvre both the Government and the Nationalists, so as to retain Ireland as a whole under the direct authority of the Crown in Westminster. Ulster excluding itself from the jurisdiction of a Dublin Parliament was the threat, but if \u201can option\u201d for Ulster was all that was achieved, it would have been--as Carson later accounted it--a defeat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sluggerotoole.com/2016/08/28/edward-carson-no-one-on-earth-is-so-clearly-the-typical-irishman/|title=Edward Carson, \u2018No one on earth is so clearly the \u201ctypical Irishman\u201d\u2018|last=archive.org|website=www.sluggerotoole.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref>\n\nFor Unionists in the North, the integrity of Ireland within the United Kingdom was not an existential issue. With the signing of the Covenant and the creation of the Provisional government, northern Protestants had effectively \"proclaimed themselves a people apart from the rest of Ireland, and decreed the exclusion of Unionists, as well as Nationalists, who had the misfortune to reside on the wrong bank of the Boyne.\u201d The differences in class between the two sections of Unionism were complicated by the unresolved differences of creed. One of the arguments that was now employed behind the scenes for the exclusion of a smaller enclave of six, rather than the full nine, Ulster counties is that it would possess not merely a Protestant but a Presbyterian majority.<ref>Good (1920). pp. 225-226)</ref>\n\nEconomic differences also made for separation. Agricultural Ulster, and Belfast as a distribution centre, might have important links with the south and west of the country. But the major industries, textiles, shipbuilding and engineering brought those they engaged into routine contact, not with Limerick, Cork or even Dublin, but with Glasgow, Liverpool and London. An Irish partition would not involve the potential loss of a valued hinterland, entrep\u00f4t or market.\n\nUltimately, as recalled by the man celebrated for landing German guns for Ulster Volunteers, Major [[Frederick H. Crawford]], the decision on the Ulster Unionist Council was that \u201cwe could not dictate to the rest of Ireland.\u201d Beyond the Protestant pale in Ulster there was simply no hope of rescuing Unionist brethren from the strength of the demand for Home Rule and from the British sympathy it engaged. \n<blockquote>I moved a resolution that in future our policy be confined to Ulster . . . This very naturally caused dismay among the Unionists of the South and West but when we asked them for an alternative they could suggest no alternative.<ref>Frederick H Crawford, Guns for Ulster, Graham and Heslip, Belfast 1947</ref><ref>Biggs Davidson (1973). pp. 71-72</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Partition===\n[[File:Irish UK election 1918.png|thumb|right|The 1918 general election result in Ireland. Sinn Fein sweeps the south and west]]\nWith the Nationalists seeking to match the Ulster Volunteers by drilling and arming of [[National Volunteers]], in July 1914 King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] called the parties to a [[Buckingham Palace Conference|conference of Buckingham Palace]].  The IPP leader [[John Redmond]] insisted that if any part of Ireland was to be excluded from Dublin's jurisdiction it should only be those limited areas in the north-east with clear Unionist majorities.  Carson, still seeking the leverage that might induce Nationalists to settle on terms more conducive to the continued sovereignty of the Crown in Westminster, insisted on a \u201cclean cut\u201d for the whole nine counties of Ulster. If this was done generously, he suggested that Ulster might, in time, \u201ccome in.\u201d  For a few days the conference, in words of Winston Churchill, \u201ctoiled round the muddy byways of Fermanagh and Tyrone\u201d and no amending bill was agreed.<ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973). p. 229</ref>\n\nOn August 4th 1914, the United Kingdom declared war on Germany. A few weeks later the Home Rule bill received [[Royal Assent]] but with implementation suspended for the duration of European hostilities. With the issue of exclusion unresolved, leaders on both sides entered into a rival solicitation of Government favour by committing themselves, and their volunteers, to the war effort. Having, on the eve of war, been under growing pressure to set up his Provisional Government, Carson declared that \u201cEngland difficulty is not Ulster\u2019s opportunity . . . We do not seeks to purchase terms by selling our patriotism.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title =Dividing Ireland: World War One and Partition|last = Hennessey|first = Thomas|publisher = Routledge|year = 1998|location = London|pages = 72}}</ref>\n\nThat, however, was how Redmond's position came to be perceived on the nationalist side. Seizing upon \u201cEngland difficulty,\u201d contingents of republican [[Irish Volunteers]] and Connolly's [[Irish Citizen Army|Citizen Army]],  ensured that while Irishmen, at Redmond's urging, were sacrificing themselves for the sake of \u201cCatholic Belgium,\u201d Britain could be seen on the streets of [[Easter Rising|Dublin in Easter 1916]] suppressing an Irish \u201cstrike for freedom.\u201d In the aftermath of the Rising and in the course of a [[Conscription Crisis|national campaign against military conscription]], the IPP \u2018s capital was exhausted.<ref>Hennessey (1998)</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title =The Resurrection of Ireland: The Sinn F\u00e9in Party, 1916-1923|last = Laffan|first = Michael|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2012|location = Cambridge|isbn=9781139106849}}</ref>\n\nSensing an opportunity, at the hastily arranged [[Irish Convention]] in Dublin in 1917, the Southern unionists' leader [[St John Brodrick, 1st Earl of Midleton|Lord Middleton]] offered the beleaguered IPP the immediate establishment of an all-Ireland parliament that, among other guarantees for unionists, would split fiscal powers with Westminster and surrender any ambition for an independent tariff policy. But the decision of the Lloyd George and his Cabinet to simultaneously introduce conscription to Ireland--in effect, to make the first order of an Irish government cooperation in the impressment of men for the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]--ruined the credibility of the proposal  with nationalists<ref>[[Stephen Gwynn|Gwynn, Stephen]] (1919), ''John Redmond's last Years'' Ch.

He proposed a United Kingdom federation of England, Scotland, Ulster and the South of Ireland. But the plan evoked no nationalist response.<ref>Biggs-Davison (1973). p. 94</ref>\n\nIn the \"[[Khaki election]]\" of December 1918, the first Westminster poll since 1910 and the first with all adult males and women from age thirty eligible to vote (the electorate tripled), the IPP was almost wholly replaced in nationalist constituencies by Sinn F\u00e9in. Acting on their mandate, Sinn F\u00e9in MPs met in Dublin in January 1919 as the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the national assembly, of the Republic declared in 1916 and demanded that the \"English garrison\" evacuate. In the six north-east counties the Unionists took 22 out of 29 seats, with  Carson, wary of [[Bolshevism|\"Bolshevik]]\" sedition, having taken the additional precaution of running candidates in Belfast as [[Ulster Unionist Labour Association|Labour Unionists]].\n\nViolence against Catholics in Belfast, driven out of workplaces and attacked in their districts, and a boycott of Belfast goods, accompanied by looting and destruction, in the South, helped consolidate \"real partition, spiritual and voluntary\"<ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973) pp. 99-100</ref> in advance of the constitutional partition. This otherwise uncompromising Republicans recognised was, at least for now, inevitable. In August 1920 [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], President of D\u00e1il, declared in favour of \"giving each county power to vote itself out of the Republic if it so wished.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title =Revolutionary Government in Ireland|last = Mitchell|first = Arthur|publisher = Gill & Macmillan|year = 1995|location = Dublin|isbn=0-7171-2015-5|pages = 310}}</ref>\n\nAs they battled with the Republic in the South and West, the British Government, in the hope of brokering a compromise that might yet hold Ireland within the jurisdiction of the \u201cImperial Parliament,\u201d proceeded with the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]. This provided for two subordinate parliaments. In Belfast a \u201cNorthern Ireland\u201d parliament would convene for the six rather than nine Ulster counties (in three, Craig conceded, Sinn F\u00e9iners would make government \"absolutely impossible for us\"). The island's remaining twenty-six counties, \"Southern Ireland,\" would be represented in Dublin. In a joint Council, the two parliaments would be free to enter into all-Ireland arrangements.\n\nIn 1921, elections for these parliaments were duly held. But in \"Southern Ireland\" this was for parliament which, by British agreement, would now constitute itself as the D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann of the [[Irish Free State]]. Under the terms of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], the twenty-six counties were to have the \"same constitutional status in the Community of Nations known as the British Empire as the Dominion of [[Canada]].\"<ref> {{cite web|title= The Anglo-Irish Treaty, 6 December 1921|url=http://www.https://cain.ulster.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/ait1921.htm/|accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref> It was not clear to all parties at the time\u2014civil war ensued\u2014but this was de facto independence.\n\nUnionists in Northern Ireland thus found themselves in the unanticipated and unsought position of having to work a constitutional arrangement that was the \u201cby-product of the desperate attempt by British statesmen\u201d to reconcile \u201cthe determination of the Protestant population of the North to remain firmly and without qualification within the United Kingdom\u201d with the aspirations of the Nationalist majority in Ireland for Irish unity and independence,<ref>{{Cite book|title = Lessons of Ulster|last = Utley|first = T.E.|publisher = J.M.

Belfast, like [[Ottawa]], had a two-chamber [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Parliament]], a Cabinet and [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland|Prime Minister]] ([[Sir James Craig]]), and [[the Crown]] represented by a [[Governor of Northern Ireland|Governor]] ([[James Hamilton, 3rd Duke of Abercorn|the Duke of Abercorn]]) and advised by a [[Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Privy Council]]. All this was suggestive, not a devolved administration within the United Kingdom, but of a state constituted under the Crown outside the direct jurisdiction of the Westminster parliament.\n\nThe impression that Ireland as a whole was being removed from the orbit of Westminster politics was reinforced by refusal of the parties of Government and Opposition to organise, or canvass for votes, in the six counties.<ref>{{Cite book|title =Fatal Influence: The Impact of Ireland on British Politics|last = Mathews|first = Kevin|publisher = University College Dublin Press|year = 2004|location = Dublin|isbn=978-1904558057|pages = 310}}</ref>  The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] were content that [[Ulster Unionist Party]] MPs took their party [[whip]] in the [[House of Commons]] where, by general agreement, matters within the competence of the Belfast Parliament could not be raised.

Despite its broad legislative powers, the Belfast Parliament did not, in any case, have the kinds of tax and spending powers that might have engendered that kind of party competition. For all its [[Queen-in-Parliament|crown-in-parliament]] pretension and, from 1932, the grandeur of its [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Buildings at Stormont]], the Northern Ireland Parliament was \"effectively dependant for supply on the Parliament at Westminster.\"<ref>Biggs-Davison (1973), p. 18</ref> The principal sources of government revenue, income and corporation taxes, customs and excise, were entirely beyond Belfast's control.<ref>{{Cite book |title = The Government of Northern Ireland: Public Finance and Public Services, 1921-1964|last = Lawrence|first = R.J..|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1965|location = Oxford|pages = 40\u201341+}}</ref>\n\nThe one unambiguous remit of the Belfast parliament was precisely that in which the Gladstone Home Rule bills had sought to limit a Dublin parliament: internal \"law and order.\" Unionists argue that these were \"responsibilities thrust upon them\": <blockquote>[U]nionists leaders had no desire to \"dominate\" Catholics in the pursuit of loyalist self-determination. As [[Sir Edward Carson|Lord Carson]] argued in the House of Commons . . ., unionists never asked to govern any Ulster Catholic but were perfectly happy that both Protestants and Catholics should be governed from Westminster. The strongest foundation for the good government of Ulster, he argued, was the fact that Westminster was aloof from the religious and racial distinction of its inhabitants.<ref>Aughey (1995), p. 15</ref></blockquote>\n\nCatholics were a third of the population in the six counties: a minority in four, [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[County Down|Down]] and [[County Armagh|Armagh]], and a majority in two, [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]]. Carson was apprehensive, fearing that with a separate parliament sectarianism could be the only basis for politics. In 1921 he reminded Craig and other Unionist leaders: \"We used to say that we could not trust an Irish parliament in Dublin to do justice to the Protestant minority. Let us take care that that reproach can no longer be made against your parliament, and from the outset let them see that the Catholic minority have nothing to fear from a Protestant majority.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = Dudley Edwards | first = Ruth | title = Biography: Carson by Geoffrey Lewis | newspaper = The Times | date = 29 May 2005 | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article526275.ece |access-date=13 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n===On the edge of the Union===\n[[File:USC OrangeLodge1970.jpg|thumb|upright|An Orange Order banner dedicated to the Ulster Special Constabulary. 2007]]\nIn retirement in London Carson confided to the historian [[Charles Petrie (historian)|Sir Charles Petrie]] his disillusionment with Belfast politics: \"I fought to keep Ulster part of the United Kingdom, but Stormont is turning her into a second-class Dominion.\"<ref>Sir Charles Petrie, ''A Historian Looks At His World'' (London: Sedgwick & Jackson, 1972), p. 27.</ref> Yet in the first critical years of the new Northern Ireland administration, Carson had stood with other Unionist leaders in urging measures that were both resented by nationalists and poorly understood or appreciated in Great Britain.\n\nOne of the first act of Northern Ireland legislature was to overturn a British attempt to maximise the representation of a minority-populated \"centre ground.\" In 1919 [[proportional representation]] (PR) had been prescribed for all Irish elections. In the January 1920 urban council elections in Ulster preference voting assisted nationalists to the control of 21 of 45 townships, including [[Omagh]], [[Newry]] and \"what was the greatest blow to Unionist pride\", [[Derry]].<ref>Generally, unionists prefer to use Londonderry, the official name of the city, whereas nationalists prefer the name 'Derry'. Due to this complexity and potential for problems, Wikipedia uses a consensus where ''Derry'' is used to refer to the city and Londonderry the county.</ref>  In Belfast, where under the old [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post system]] Unionists had taken 52 of 60 council seats, under PR the nationalists were able to take ten, although perhaps \"most disturbing to Carson and his followers\" was the success of twelve labour candidates (ten for the independent [[Belfast Labour Party]]).<ref>Matthews (2004). p. 20</ref>  In the county, and rural district, council elections that followed in June 1920 nationalists took control of two of the six counties (Fermanagh and, for the first time Tyrone) and 36 of the 55 districts.\n\nThe twelve anti-partitionist MPs returned in May 1921 to the fifty-two member Northern parliament refused to take their seats. They joined nationalist councillors, and large numbers of Catholic school officials and teachers, in pledging themselves to Dublin. At the annual [[Parades in Northern Ireland|12th of July Orange celebrations]] Carson denounced those who elected swore allegiance to the Republic and vowed that Ulster would \"tolerate no Sinn F\u00e9in organisation or methods\" within its border. At the same time, he declared that \"real object\" of the independent Labour movement was \"to bring about disunity among our people.\"<ref>Matthews (2004). p. 22</ref>\n\nThe 1922 Local Government Act that restored the winner-take-all voting system also authorised the N.I. Minister of Home Affairs to rearrange local government constituencies. Unionists dispute that this led to a systematic policy of [[gerrymandering|gerrymander]]. In what is generally cited as the most egregious example, Derry, from 1923 a \"nationalist city\" with a Unionist council, they point to the low turnout among a dispirited and abstentionist nationalist electorate, and among Catholics voting to the comparatively strong support for labour candidates.<ref>{{Cite book |title = Londonderry Revisited: A Loyalist Analysis of the Civil Rights Controversy|last = Kingsley|first = Paul|publisher = Belfast Publicationss|year = 1989|location = Belfast|isbn = 0951554905|pages = 19\u201339}}</ref> But a generation later, in 1968 when nationalists were taking to the streets of the city, the veteran Unionist MP and former Northern Ireland Attorney General Edmunnd Warnock advised the then Prime Minister Terence O'Neill that \"If ever a community had a right to demonstrate against a denial of civil rights, Derry is the finest example.\" Warnock confessed to his own role in the \"manipulation of ward boundaries for the sole purpose of retaining unionist control\".

It was an almost entirely Protestant force, an excuse the nationalists alleged for arming Orangemen. A 1922 Special Powers Act gave the Northern Ireland Home Affairs Minister discretionary powers to direct the RUC and Specials as his agents in searches, arrests, detentions, and proscriptions.

First, it promised a programme of \"slum clearance\" and public housing construction (in the wake of the [[Belfast Blitz]] the authorities acknowledged that much of the housing stock had been \"uninhabitable\" before the war). Second, the Government accepted an offer from London--understood as a reward for the province's wartime service--to match the parity in taxation between Northern Ireland and Great Britain with parity in the services delivered. What Northern Ireland might loose in autonomy, it was going to gain in a closer, more equal, Union. Since the Belfast government could not in any case control the tax implications, it seemed that they could only welcome British financial support for the public spending that would follow.<ref>{{Cite book |title = History of Northern Ireland|last = Buckland|first = Patrick|publisher =Gill & Macmillan|year = 1981|location = Dublin|isbn = 9780717110698|pages = 83}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1960s Unionism was administering something at odds with the conservatism of those to whom leadership had been conceded in the resistance to Irish Home Rule. Under the impetus of the [[Labour Government 1945-1951|post-War Labour government]] in Britain, and thanks to the generosity of British exchequer, Northern Ireland had emerged with an advanced [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|welfare state]]. The Education Act (NI), 1947, \"revolutionised access\" to secondary and further education. Catholic grant-aided schools were fully funded, and a school transfer test (the [[Eleven Plus]]) enabled qualifying students to receive a grammar-school education irrespective of background or circumstances. Health-care provision was expanded and re-organised on the model of the [[National Health Service]] in Great Britain to ensure universal access. The Victorian-era [[Irish Poor Laws|Poor Law]], sustained after 1921, was replaced with a comprehensive system of social-security. Under the Housing Act (NI) 1945 the public subvention for new home construction was even greater, proportionately, than in England and Wales. The distinction between rural and urban housing was abolished, and local councils become housing authorities.<ref>Wichert (1981, pp. 43-49</ref>\n\n===1960s: reform and protest===\n[[File:NICRA 1968 Derry march.jpg|thumb|upright]]\nIn the 1960s, under premiership of [[Terence O'Neill]], Ulster Unionism was led through seeming economic-policy successes into a political crisis that upended the 1921 devolved constitution. A scion of a landed family (brought Up partly in [[Abyssinia]] and partly at [[Eton College|Eton]]) and, like all contenders for his position, a member of the [[Orange Order]], O'Neill was the unlikely champion of a technocratic approach to government that was impatient with what he decried as \"ancient hatreds.\"<ref>Cole John, in Introduction to {{Cite book |title = Ulster at the Crossroads|last = O'Neill|first = Terence|publisher = Faber & Faber|year = 1969|location = London|pages = 11}}</ref> \n\nRecognising the decline of the province's Victorian-era industries, under O'Neill the Stormont administration intensified its efforts to attract outside capital. Investment in new infrastructure, training schemes coordinated with trade unions, and direct grants succeeded in attracting American, British and continental firms (some of these introducing into the one time [[linenopolis]] artificial fibres). In its own terms, the strategy was a success: the level of manufacturing employment was better than sustained. Yet Protestant workers and local Unionist leadership were unsettled.

Drawing on the struggle for black equality in the United States, they spoke a language of universal rights that had an international resonance far beyond that of the particularist claims of Irish nationalism. \n\nSince 1964, the [[Campaign for Social Justice]] had been collating and publicising evidence of discrimination in employment and housing. From April 1967 the cause was taken up by the Belfast-based [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]].

Irish commemorative postage stamp, 2015]]O'Neill had not disguised an ambition to bring the politics as well as the economy of Northern Ireland \"into the twentieth century.\" In January 1965, at O'Neill personal invitation, the ''[[taoiseach]]'' [[Sean Lemass]] (whose government was pursuing a similar \"modernising\" agenda in the South) made an unheralded visit to Stormont. After O'Neill reciprocated with a visit to Dublin, the Nationalists were persuaded, for the first time, to assume the role at Stormont of [[Her Majesty's Opposition]]. With this and other conciliatory gestures (unprecedented visits to a Catholic hospitals and schools, flying the Union flag at half mast for the death of [[Pope John XXIII]]) O'Neill incurred the wrath of those he understood as \"self-styled 'loyalists' who see moderation as treason, and decency as weakness,\"<ref>O'Neill (1969), p. 123</ref> among these the Reverend [[Ian Paisley]]. \n\nAs Moderator of his own [[Free Presbyterian Church]], and at a time when he believed mainline presbyteries were being led down a \"Roman road\" by the [[Irish Council of Churches]], Paisley saw himself treading in the path of the \"greatest son\" of [[Presbyterian Church of Ireland|Irish Presbyterianism]], Dr. [[Henry Cooke (minister)|Henry Cooke]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ianpaisley.org/revivalist/1980/Rev80mar.htm/|title=Exit Dr. Craig the Evangelical - Enter Dr. Craig the Ecumenical|website=ianpaisley.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>  Like Cooke, Paisley was alert to [[ecumenicism]] \"both political and ecclesiastical.\" After the Lemass meeting, Paisely announced that \"the Ecumenists . . . are selling us out. Every Ulster Protestant must unflinchingly resist these leaders and let it be known in no uncertain manner that they will not sit idly by as these modern [[Robert Lundy|Lundies]] pursue their policy of treachery.\" Paisley had his own ideas of a \"third force\" in Ulster politics.

There was to be a needs-based points system for public housing; an ombudsman to investigate citizen grievances; universal franchise in council elections (\"One man, one vote\"); and The Londonderry Corporation was suspended and replaced by Development Commission. The Special Powers Act was to be reviewed. \n\nAt a [[Downing Street]] summit on 4 November, [[Harold Wilson]] had warned O'Neill that his government could not \"tolerate a situation in which the liberalising trend was being retarded rather than accelerate,\" and that if that were the case they might \"feel compelled to propose a radical course involving the complete liquidation of all financial agreement with Northern Ireland.\" The British Prime Minister muttered darkly about how, with British subsidy, the major Belfast employers, [[Shorts]], the aircraft manufacturer, and [[Harland and Wolff]], the shipyard, \"had become a kind of soup kitchen.\"<ref>quoted in Prince and Warner (2019), p. 99</ref>\n\nWith members of his cabinet urging him to call Wilson's \"bluff,\" and facing a [[Backbencher]] motion of no-confidence, in January 1969 O'Neill called a [[1969 Northern Ireland general election| general election]]. Having reminded his television audience that under the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] \"the supreme authority of the Parliament of the United Kingdom [remained] unaffected and undiminished over all persons, matters and things\" in Northern Ireland, O'Neill employed the talking points supplied by Wilson. \n<blockquote>I make no apology for the financial and economic support we have received from Britain. As a part of the United Kingdom we have always considered this to be our right. But we cannot be a part of the United Kingdom merely when it suits us. And those who talk so glibly about acts of impoverished defiance do not know or care what is at stake. Your job if you are a worker at Shorts or Harland and Wolff; your subsidies if you are a farmer; your pension if you are retired; all these aspects of our life, and many others depend on support from Britain.

This rights-based perspective drew on what, internationally, proved to be the most compelling account of a conflict that over thirty years took more than 3,600 lives, and injured and bereaved many thousands more. This places at the heart of the conflict the movement for the \"civil rights of the Catholic/Nationalist community.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Civil Rights and Peace Agreements |last=Bell |first=Chirstine|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=33}}</ref> It is the belief that many in that community came to support or acquiesce in the Republican return to \"physical force\" in 1970-71 because, in the words of [[Eamonn McCann]], the notion that it was possible to achieve full citizenship within the North \"was beaten out of people's heads by the cops and their semi-official auxiliaries.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=McCann: War and Peace in Northern Ireland |last=McCann |first=Eamonn |year=1998 |publisher=Hot Press Books |location=Dublin|page=145}}</ref><ref>See also {{Cite book|title=From Civil Rights to Armalites: Derry and the Birth of the Irish Troubles |last=) Dochtartaigh |first=Nail|year=1997|publisher=Cork University Press |location=Cork}} </ref> \n\nAs an account of The Troubles, this is consistent with the broad support that the two main nationalist parties expressed for the provision in the Agreement for a possible Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.

Already in the mid-1980s [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] President [[Gerry Adams]] was pointing to the involvement of the [[Wolfe Tone Societies|Wolf Tone Clubs]] in [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association|NICRA]], and arguing that human rights had always been an integral part of the republican struggle.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Politics of Irish Freedom |last=Adams |first=Gerry |year=1986 |publisher=Brandon Books|isbn=0863220843 |page=12}}</ref>\n\nGiven that it appears to extenuate the republican resort to terrorism, Unionists have tended to reject the civil-rights account of the Troubles in almost every particular. in the late 1960s [[Ian Paisley|Paisley]] was not alone is dismissing talk of civil rights as much \"cant\" behind which stood preparations for a renewed armed campaign. There was broad Unionist belief that the civil rights movement's demand for \"simple justice\" or, as was often presented in the metropolitan press, for \"British standards\", was \"largely a charade,\" and that what was really \"going on\" was a \"modern version of the old battle between nationalities.\"<ref>Utley (1975), p. 35</ref>\n\nWhile they might concede \"that several abuses of normal civil right did occur under the Stormont government\", unionists argue that nationalists greatly exaggerated their impact upon the Catholic community.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Demonisation of the Protestant Community |last=Gudgin |first=Graham |year=1997 |publisher=The Ulster Society|location = Belfast) |page=4}}</ref><ref>See also \"Stormont discrimination of Catholics hugely exaggerated says David Trimble\", ''Irish News'', 13 October 2018. https://www.irishnews.com/news/2018/10/13/news/stormont-discrimination-of-catholics-hugely-exaggerated-says-david-trimble-s-ex-aide-1457251/</ref> Paul Kingsley's frequently cited \"loyalist analysis of the Civil Rights controversy\" maintains that, to the limited extent they occurred, the abuses protested by NICRA were as nothing compared to the profounder disadvantages for Catholic community represented by the nationalist policy of non-participation in public affairs (\"much of the blame must fall on those who behaved as if they were not citizens at all\")<ref>Biggs-Davison (1973), p. 143</ref> and by the \"structural\" characteristics of low social status, of larger families and lower education attainment.<ref>Kingsley (1994), pp, 54-75</ref><ref>See also Alcock (1994), pp. 85-86</ref>\n\nThe real interest behind the agitation for civil rights in Kingsley's account, is the social and political ambition of an emergent Catholic middle class (beneficiaries of the 1947 Education Act). Through the polemic of civil rights those who wished to pursue careers in law, public administration and elective office found release from the self-denying nationalist ordinances of non-recognition and abstention. They could represent themselves \"as people who were heroically breaking down the barriers of discrimination: the promoters of Catholic group interests rather than traitors to the cause.\" \"The political necessity to find a way to get the Catholic middle class into positions of influence,\" Kingsley argues, \"meant that the discrimination argument had to be brought to the fore\".<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 125</ref>\n\nIf not from the outset, then by the summer of 1968 as republicans and left-wing militants took the initiative, \"civil rights leaders\" also came to realise the ability of their campaign \"to convince the British government of the moral superiority of the Catholics position\", and to \"win changed which would be of symbolic importance.\" These in turn would \"undermine Unionist self-confidence, and open the way for further demands\".<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 137</ref> On the street this was the calculation that urged a strategy of tension: provoking violent reactions from an ill-prepared police force and the \"entirely predictable\" and--Kingsley and other unionist commentators<ref>Gregory Campbell (2018), \"Working-class protestants feared what civil rights movement would become\", ''News Letter'', 5 October. https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/gregory-campbell-working-class-protestants-feared-what-civil-rights-movement-would-become-1-8657612</ref> allow--\"ill disciplined\" and \"ferocious\", intrusions into the picture of Protestant mobs, ever anxious to lend the authorities a hand in teaching \"the rebels\" a lesson.

It was sponsored on the one hand by a British government equivocal about the integrity of its own state, thereby encouraging unionist intolerance founded on insecurity; and an Irish government hypocritically and irresponsibly playing the [[irridentism|irredentist]] card, thereby encouraging Catholic alienation from the state and helping to provoke those very features of the Stormont regime which it smugly condemned.<ref>Aughey (1995), pp. 9-10</ref></blockquote>\n\nBritish equivocation, in this view, proved disastrous when the tensions to which it had contributed to in Northern Ireland finally exploded. Had the British Government been willing from 1968/69 to act on the proposition that Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom, their response would have been \"fundamentally different.\" If they had thought there were social and political grievances which were remediable by law, it would have been seen as the business of Parliament in Westminster to act. But acts of rebellion would have been suppressed and punished as such with the full authority and force of the state. At no point would the policy have been one of containment and negotiation. <blockquote>It is scarcely conceivable . . . that in a state of civil disturbance in Britain large parts of Birmingham or Manchester would have been allowed for months on to become rebel enclaves to which the police and the army were denied access. It would have been quite incredible also that, at a time when the lawful authorities still had overwhelming force at their disposal, the leaders of a rebellion in Warwickshire or Lancashire would have been given safe conducts to London to discuss conditions of peace.<ref>Utley (1975), pp. 15-16</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe example of [[Free Derry]] was replicated in other nationalist neighbourhoods both in Derry and in Belfast.

It articulated what were to be the enduring principles of the British approach to a settlement. <blockquote>It is a fact that an element of the minority in Northern Ireland has hitherto seen itself as simply part of the wider Irish community. The problem of accommodating that minority within the political of Northern Ireland has to some extent been an aspect of a wider problem within Ireland as a whole.\n\nIt is therefore clearly desirable that any new arrangements for Northern Ireland should, whilst meeting the wishes of Northern Ireland and Great Britain, be so far as possible acceptable to accepted by the Republic of Ireland.\n\nNorthern Ireland must and will remain part of the United Kingdom for as long as that is the wish of a majority of the people, but that status does not preclude the necessary taking into account of what has been described in this paper as the 'Irish Dimension.'\n\nA Northern Ireland assembly or authority must be capable of involving all its members constructively in way which satisfy them and hose they represent that the whole community has a part to pay in the government of the Province. ...[T]here are strong arguments that the objective of real participation should be achieved by giving minority interests a share in the exercise of executive power ...<ref>{{cite book|last=Northern Ireland Office|year=1972|title=Green Paper: The Future of Northern Ireland|pages=140|location=London|publisher= HMSO|}} quoted in Kingsley (1989), pp. 230-231</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn June 1973 [[Proportional Representation|PR]] elections were held for an Assembly. Following negotiations at Sunningdale in England, attended by the Dublin government, on 1 January 1974 the former Unionist prime minister Brian Faulkner agreed to form an Executive in coalition with the SDLP and the smaller \"cross-community\" [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]]. Faulkner's later successor as party leader, [[James Molyneaux]], argued that the difficulty for most unionists  was not an arrangement in which \"Protestants and Catholics must consent\"--that \"would be comparatively simple.\" It was that, despite a promise not share power with parties \"whose ''primary'' aim is a united Ireland\",<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first= Barry|year=1984|title=John Hume: Statesman of the Troubles|location=Belfast|publisher= Blackstaff Press|isbn=9780856403170|pages=140}}</ref> Faulkner had committed them to agreement with \"Republican Catholics\" <ref>Interview with James Molyneaux, 18 May 1982 quoted in {{cite book|last=O'Malley|first= Padraig |year=1983|title=The Uncivil Wars: Ireland Today|pages=17, 26, 39|location=Boston|publisher= Houghton Mifflin|isbn=039534414X}}</ref> \n\nHaving drawn on both the [[Republican Labour Party|Republican]], and [[Northern Ireland Labour Party|Northern Ireland, Labour]] parties, and with a commitment to \"accommodate progressive Protestants,\"  the SDLP had announced themselves as something more than nationalist or republican party.<ref>{{cite book|last=Devlin|first= Paddy|year=1993|title=Straight Left: an Autobiography|location=Belfast|publisher= Blackstaff Press|isbn=0856405140|pages=191}}</ref> But with PIRA continuing to draw on fury over internment and Bloody Sunday, Eamonn McCann notes that \"in order to sell the deal to the Catholic community the SDLP had to present it not just as a means of expressing its aspiration towards a united Ireland but a means of achieving it\".<ref>McCann (1980), p. 141</ref> The new Health and Social Service Minister, [[Paddy Devlin]], conceded that \"all other issues were governed\" by a drive to \"get all-Ireland institutions established\" that would \"produce the dynamic that would lead ultimately to an agreed united Ireland.\"<ref>Devlin, p. 205</ref> \n\nThe [[Sunningdale Agreement]] envisaged a Council of Ireland comprising, with equal delegations from Dublin and Belfast, a Council of Ministers with \"executive and harmonising functions\" and a Consultative Assembly with \"advisory and review functions.\" As they would only have a plurality of representation on the Northern side, these created the possibility of Unionists being manoeuvred into a minority position. \"In retrospect\", Devlin regretted his party had not \"adopted a two stage approach, by allowing power sharing at Stormont to establish itself\",<ref>Devlin, p. 252</ref> but by the time he and his colleagues recognised the damage they had caused to Faulkner's position by prioritising the \"Irish Dimension\" it was too late. \n\nWithin a week of taking office as First Minister, opposition to the Sunningdale proposals forced Faulkner to resign as UUP leader. In a [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|surprise Westminster election]] at the end of February, his new pro-Agreement grouping, the [[Unionist Party of Northern Ireland]], was rolled over by a [[United Ulster Unionist Coalition]] in which the bulk of his old party stood with William Craig's [[Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party|Ulster Vanguard]] and Paisley's new electoral vehicle, the [[Democratic Unionist Party|Democratic Unionists]]. Arguing that they had deprived Faulkner of any semblance of a mandate, the victors called for new Assembly elections. \n\nWhen on 14 May the Assembly defeated a motion rejecting the Sunningdale Agreement, Harry Murray, the shipyard convener for the [[Ulster Workers' Council]] (UWC), a loyalist labour coalition, announced a general strike.

From the UUP's James Molyneaux there were the familiar objections to \"something very far removed from straightforward democracy\" and which could give republicans an effective \"veto.\"  But with Paisley calling on unionists not to \"lose sight\" of an opportunity for the \"Ulster people\" to \"freely elect their own Assembly and to begin to bring Direct Rule to account\", there was not blanket rejection.<ref>O'Mally (1983), pp. 372-373</ref> That was to come from nationalists.\n\nJohn Hume dismissed the initiative as \"insulting.\" Not only did it imply, with the 70 percent hurdle, a very much higher degree of unionist unanimity and consent than was required in 1973, it suggested that, for the present at least, the Irish Dimension\" would have adequate \"institutional expression\" in continuing \"intergovernmental\" exchanges with Dublin--then at a low point following the [[1981 Irish hunger strike|PIRA Hunger Strike]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=John|year=2003|title= 'Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two: The Iron Lady|location=London|publisher= Jonathan Cape|pages=426}}</ref> Seconded by the Dublin government, SDLP insisted that without of \"a very strong and positive and concrete expression of the Irish identity\" the proposals were unworkable.<ref>O'Mally (1983), pp. 368-369</ref> \n\nThere were other calculations in an initiative that, in the wake of the Hunger Strike, had the potential to deflect criticism not only from the Republic but also from the United States,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bew|first1=Paul|last2=Patterson|first2=Henry|year=1985|title= The British State and the Ulster Crisis: From Wilson to Thatcher|location=London|publisher= Verso Books|isbn=978-0860918158|pages=112}}</ref><ref>Wichert (1991), pp. 194-195.</ref> but in 1985 the British government appeared to reverse tack.

Proposals from The Irish government would be entertained, however, only on \"matters [that] are not the responsibility of a devolved administration in Northern Ireland.\" If unionists wished to limit Dublin's influence, the suggestion was that they would have to climb down from their insistence of \"simple majority rule\" and think again as to how nationalists could be accommodated at Stormont.<ref>{{cite book|last=Aughey|first=Arthur|year=1989|title= Under Siege: Ulster Unionism and the Anglo-Irish Agreement|location=Belfast|publisher= Blacksaff Press}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ulster Says No poster.svg|100px|left|Campaign against the Anglo-Irish Agreement]]\nThe unionist reaction, Thatcher recalled in her memoirs, was \"worse than anyone had predicted to me\".<ref>Margaret Thatcher, ''The Downing Street Years'' (London: HarperCollins, 1993), p. 403.</ref> The [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) and [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) led an \"Ulster says No\"  campaign against the Agreement, that included strikes, [[civil disobedience]] and a mass resignation of unionist MPs from Westminster and suspensions of district council meetings.<ref name=aia>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/aia/chron.htm Anglo-Irish Agreement \u2013 Chronology of Events] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206111841/http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/aia/chron.htm |date=2 June 2019}} [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN).

On a smaller level, the [[Progressive Unionist Party]], which is the political wing of the [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1966)|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) paramilitary group, attracts some support in the greater Belfast area. [[Traditional Unionist Voice]] is opposed to the current constitutional arrangements in Northern Ireland following the [[Belfast Agreement]] and [[St Andrews Agreement]]. The pluralist [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] is currently allied to the Ulster Unionist Party. While the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]] supports the status quo position of Northern Ireland, it does not define itself as Unionist.\n\nModerate unionists who support the principle of [[Equal Citizenship]] between Northern Ireland and Great Britain have campaigned for mainstream British political parties to organise and contest elections in Northern Ireland. Equal citizenship pressure groups have included the [[Campaign for Equal Citizenship]] (CEC), [[Labour Representation Campaign]], [[Democracy Now (UK pressure group)|Democracy Now]] and, currently, [[Labour - Federation of Labour Groups]]. Momentum for this concept picked up after the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Party Conference voted in favour of working in Northern Ireland in 1989.

However, a strong decline in the Catholic birthrate may slow down or even reverse the growth in the Catholic population (which may in turn be balanced by an increased rate of emigration of young Protestants, often to study and work in Great Britain). Recent influxes of immigrants, especially from Eastern Europe, are also having a significant effect on the demographic balance, although how many choose to reside permanently in Northern Ireland or take an interest in the political scene remains to be seen.\n\n===Ties to Unionism in Scotland===\nThere is some degree of social and political co-operation between some [[Unionism in Scotland|Scottish unionists]] and Northern Irish unionists, due to their similar aims of maintaining the unity of their [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent country]] with the United Kingdom. For example, the [[Orange Order]] parades in Orange Walks in Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, many unionists in Scotland shy away from connections to unionism in Ireland in order not to endorse any side of a largely sectarian conflict. This brand of unionism is largely concentrated in the [[Central Belt]] and west of Scotland. [[Loyalist]]s in Scotland are seen as a militant or extreme branch of [[British unionism|unionism]]. Orangism in west and central Scotland, and opposition to it by [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] in Scotland, can be explained as a result of the large amount of immigration from the Republic and Northern Ireland.\n\nSongs and symbols of unionism, particularly of the Northern Irish variety, are used by many supporters of [[Rangers F.C.]], a football club based in [[Glasgow]]. Both Rangers and their longtime rival [[Celtic F.C.]], which has Irish Roman Catholic roots, have a reputation for [[sectarian]] clashes and bitter opposition to each other, frequently characterised by religious taunts, chants and other provocations. This behaviour by some supporters is condemned by the management of the clubs. Despite the symbols associated with the clubs, not all Rangers supporters can be automatically classified as unionists, nor all Celtic supporters as nationalists. For example, there were Celtic supporters of the \"No Thanks\" campaign for the 2014 independence referendum and Rangers supporters of the \"Yes Scotland\" campaign- despite Celtic FC having nationalist origins and Rangers FC having unionist origins. There was found to be no link between support of left and right-wing parties at general elections for Rangers or Celtic fans either.\n\n==Unionists in southern Ireland 1891\u20131922 {{anchor|Irish unionism}}==\n\n{{main|Irish Unionist Alliance#Southern Unionists}}\n\nAfter 1890, and particularly during the period from the start of the [[First World War]] to the mid-1920s, the number of Unionists in what is now the [[Republic of Ireland]] declined to a point where their numbers were widely regarded as almost insignificant.<ref>McDowell, R.B. ''Crisis and Decline: The Fate of the Southern Unionists''. The Lilliput Press (1998).</ref> This is attributed to a number of factors:\n* [[Land reform]] from the 1870s to the 1900s, arranged by the [[Irish Land Commission|Land Commission]]. This broke up many of the large Protestant-owned estates, many of whose former owners chose in the 1920s to use their compensation money to settle in Britain, often in other estates that they owned there.\n* The disestablishment of the [[Church of Ireland]] in 1871. This led the Church to sell many of its properties, in the process laying off many Protestant workers who subsequently moved away.\n* The [[Irish War of Independence]] and its aftermath. During the War, some elements of the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) allegedly conducted a campaign of murder and [[ethnic cleansing]] against Unionists in parts of the country such as Cork. Historians disagree as to whether such murders were isolated incidents or parts of a wider organised campaign.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Attacks continued in the 1920s against many Unionists who had assisted the British in the War, and in the process 300 historic homes were burned. Such attacks were said to be reprisals for the British forces' destruction of the homes and property of [[Irish republicanism|republicans]], actual or suspected.\n* Emigration. Large numbers of Unionists left Ireland (voluntarily or otherwise) in the years before and after independence, mainly for [[Northern Ireland]], Great Britain and Canada.\n* Assimilation. Many of the Unionists who remained [[cultural assimilation|assimilated]] to some extent into the majority nationalist culture.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} This was encouraged by the [[Irish Free State|Free State]] government, and was largely accepted with resignation. The process was accelerated by the pro-Free State stance taken by most Unionists in the [[Irish Civil War]]. The process of assimilation had begun prior to Irish independence, with a number of [[Protestant Nationalist]]s playing leading roles in the [[Irish nationalist]] and [[Gaelic revival]] movements.\n* Intermarriage and the ''Ne Temere'' decree. Unionists were and are {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} largely Protestant, and in many mixed households the children were brought up as Catholics, often because of family or community pressure and the 1908 papal ''[[Ne Temere]]'' decree. There was also a high number of single, unmarried female Unionists in the aftermath of World War I who could not find Protestant husbands.<ref>See Bence-Jones, Mark ''Twilight of the Ascendancy\" Constable, London 1993 {{ISBN|978-0-09-472350-4}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[President of Ireland]], [[Douglas Hyde]] (1938\u20131945) was Protestant, though only two senior Irish politicians attended his Church of Ireland funeral; the Catholic members of the government had to wait on the pavement near the Church to be compliant with [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]].\n\nSome Unionists in the south simply adapted and began to associate themselves with the new southern Irish regime of [[Cumann na nGaedheal]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} On 19 January 1922, leading Unionists held a meeting and unanimously decided to support the Free State government.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Many gained appointment to the Free State's Senate, including the [[Windham Wyndham-Quin, 4th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl|4th Earl of Dunraven]] and [[Thomas Westropp Bennett]]. Several generations of one Unionist political family, the Dockrells, won election as [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] (TDs). The Dublin borough of [[Rathmines]] had a unionist majority up to the late 1920s, when a local government re-organisation abolished all Dublin borough councils. Later, the Earl of Granard and the Provost of [[Trinity College Dublin]] gained appointment to the President of Ireland's advisory body, the [[Council of State]]. Most Irish Unionists, however, simply withdrew from public life, and from the late 1920s there were no self-professed Unionists elected to the Irish parliament until the election of [[Ian Marshall (farmer)|Ian Marshall]] to [[Seanad \u00c9ireann]] in 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-43920260|title=Sinn F\u00e9in votes help unionist into Irish senate|last=Adair|first=Gordon|date=27 April 2018|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=28 April 2018}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110222065415/http://www.reform.org/TheReformMovement_files/article_files/articles/southernunis.htm 1998 Review of \"Crisis and Decline; the fate of the Southern Unionists\"] by [[Geoffrey Wheatcroft]].</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n\n===Unionism in Northern Ireland===\n* [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]\n* [[Politics of Northern Ireland]]\n* [[Republic of Ireland\u2013United Kingdom border]]\n* [[Ulster loyalism]]\n* [[Ulster Scots people]]\n\n===Southern unionism===\n* [[Anglo-Irish people]]\n* [[Reform Group (Ireland)]]\n* [[West Brit]]\n\n===Unionism in Great Britain===\n* [[Scotch-Irish Americans]]\n* [[Unionism in England]]\n* [[Unionism in Scotland]]\n* [[Unionism in the United Kingdom]]\n\n===Unionist political parties===\n* [[Conservative Party (UK)]], officially the Conservative and Unionist Party (1830\u2013present)\n* [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (1905\u2013present)\n* [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (1971\u2013present)\n* [[Progressive Unionist Party]] (1978\u2013present)\n* [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP 1993\u2013present)\n* [[Traditional Unionist Voice]] (2007\u2013present)\n\n* [[Liberal Unionist Party]] (1886\u20131912)\n* [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] (1891\u20131922)\n* [[Communist Party of Northern Ireland]] (1941\u20131970)\n* [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]] (1949\u20131987)\n* [[Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party]] (1973\u20131978)\n* [[Volunteer Political Party]] (1974\u20131975)\n* [[Unionist Party of Northern Ireland]] (1974\u20131981)\n* [[United Ulster Unionist Party]] (1975\u20131984)\n* [[Donegal Progressive Party]] (1970s\u20132000s)\n* [[Ulster Popular Unionist Party]] (1980\u20131995)\n* [[Ulster Democratic Party|Ulster (Loyalist) Democratic Party]] (1982\u20132001)\n* [[UK Unionist Party]] (UKUP 1995\u20132007)\n* [[United Unionist Coalition]] (1998\u20132012)\n* [[Northern Ireland Unionist Party]] (1999\u20132008)\n* [[NI21]] (2013\u20132016)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n===Articles===\n\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070211101921/http://www.obelus.org/index.php?artID=11 Anonymous (2005) Obelus.org \"Ulster Unionism: dead but not gone\"]\n*[https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/the-dog-that-didnt-bark-southern-unionism-in-pre-and-post-revolutionary-ireland/] \u00d3 Beach\u00e1in, D.

Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized on September 15, 1915, as an exclusively Canadian Grenadier Guards (CGG) formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The [[Governor General of Canada]], HRH, Duke of Connaught (Colonel of the Canadian Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for soldiers began on October 23, 1915.  \n[[File:87th Battalion badges.jpg|thumb|Badges of the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF - Hayes-Rivet (MHR) collection]]\n\n== Unit distinctions & achievements ==\nThe 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF holds several distinctions in compared to other CEF battalions:\n* CGG was one of only 7 Militia Regiments (out of 51 CEF units) to recruit their own battalions that fought as a distinct unit within the Canadian Corps.\n* The 87th Battalion was one of only 3 Canadian units authorized by the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to recruit across all of Canada. The other 2 were the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] and [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]].\n* The 87th Battalion was the only Canadian Foot Guards CEF unit active during The Great War. The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2nd Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77th Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF. The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4th and 7th Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF, but these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.\n* Title of 'Guardsman' was awarded by [[King George V]] in 1919 as a permanent distinction in conjunction with all other Guards units, in recognition of their collective contributions to victory in the Great War.\n* 87th Battalion were the first to liberate Belgium on 5 November, 1918. Patrols from the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), of the 4th Division, crossed the River Aunelle, thereby marking the liberation, by the Canadians, of the first part of occupied Belgium.\n\n== Unit milestones ==\n=== Mobilization and England ===\nThe 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|''Empress of Britain'']] on April 23, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27 at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 1916) and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year. During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and four drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.\n\n=== First Actions & casualties ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the [[1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment), CEF]]. Of these CGG members, two, 177281 Private John Leitch, (later KIA 9 April, 1917), and 178218 Private William Anson Ogilvie, would distinguish themselves with the 1st Battalion during the Battle of the Somme and win multiple Military Medals for bravery in the field. The initial loss of men were replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, Battalion, (Ottawa) CEF, from the GGFG. The battalion was introduced and indoctrinated into trench warfare beginning August 18, 1916 in the Ypres area. Their first casualties, two wounded, occurred that same day. The first 87th Battalion fatality occurred on August 26, 1916. Total casualties for the first weeks of the war were eventually 17 KIA / 25 WIA. On September 16, 1916, the 87th battalion participated in their first trench raid resulting in 36 casualties out of 60 engaged unit members.\n\n===  Battle of the Somme ===\nOn 10 October, 1916, the 87th Battalion was relocated to Albert area along the Ancre area and on the 21 October, attacked and took a section of Regina Trench. The first gallantry awards earned by the 87th Battalion were awarded to four members for the attack on Regina Trench, CSM W. Blaney, Sgt. J.C. Noon, Ptes J.E. Blaney, and J.D. Hunter. After some routine activities and tours along the front, on November 18, the 87th Battalion was assigned to capture a section of Desire Trench, as well as its support systems. The attack was launched from Regina Trench. It succeeded well beyond expectations, and in addition to capturing Desire, Major Franklin Hall, with 41 volunteers, with only their rifles, bayonets, grenades and 2 Lewis Guns advanced a further 500 yards and captured part of Grandcourt Trench, including taking 115 prisoners. 80 of these were taken unaided by four privates; Roy, Thompson, Garneau and Winke.  \n\n==Officers Commanding==\n*Lieut.-Col.

Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized on September 15, 1915, as an exclusively Canadian Grenadier Guards (CGG) formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The [[Governor General of Canada]], HRH, Duke of Connaught (Colonel of the Canadian Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for soldiers began on October 23, 1915.  \n[[File:87th Battalion badges.jpg|thumb|Badges of the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF - Hayes-Rivet (MHR) collection]]\n\n== Unit distinctions & achievements ==\nThe 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF holds several distinctions in compared to other CEF battalions:\n* CGG was one of only 7 Militia Regiments (out of 51 CEF units) to recruit their own battalions that fought as a distinct unit within the Canadian Corps.\n* The 87th Battalion was one of only 3 Canadian units authorized by the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to recruit across all of Canada. The other 2 were the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] and [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]].\n* The 87th Battalion was the only Canadian Foot Guards CEF unit active during The Great War. The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2nd Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77th Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF. The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4th and 7th Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF, but these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.\n* Title of 'Guardsman' was awarded by [[King George V]] in 1919 as a permanent distinction in conjunction with all other Guards units, in recognition of their collective contributions to victory in the Great War.\n* 87th Battalion were the first to liberate Belgium on 5 November, 1918. Patrols from the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), of the 4th Division, crossed the River Aunelle, thereby marking the liberation, by the Canadians, of the first part of occupied Belgium.\n\n== Unit milestones ==\n=== Mobilization and England ===\nThe 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|''Empress of Britain'']] on April 23, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27 at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 1916) and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year. During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and four drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.\n\n=== First Actions & casualties ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the [[1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment), CEF]]. Of these CGG members, two, 177281 Private John Leitch, (later KIA 9 April, 1917), and 178218 Private William Anson Ogilvie, would distinguish themselves with the 1st Battalion during the Battle of the Somme and win multiple Military Medals for bravery in the field. The initial loss of men were replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, Battalion, (Ottawa) CEF, from the GGFG. The battalion was introduced and indoctrinated into trench warfare beginning August 18, 1916 in the Ypres area. Their first casualties, two wounded, occurred that same day. The first 87th Battalion fatality occurred on August 26, 1916. Total casualties for the first weeks of the war were eventually 17 KIA / 25 WIA. On September 16, 1916, the 87th battalion participated in their first trench raid resulting in 36 casualties out of 60 engaged unit members.\n\n===  Battle of the Somme ===\nOn 10 October, 1916, the 87th Battalion was relocated to Albert area along the Ancre area and on the 21 October, attacked and took a section of Regina Trench. The first gallantry awards earned by the 87th Battalion were awarded to four members for the attack on Regina Trench, CSM W. Blaney, Sgt. J.C. Noon, Ptes J.E. Blaney, and J.D. Hunter. After some routine activities and tours along the front, on November 18, the 87th Battalion was assigned to capture a section of Desire Trench, as well as its support systems. The attack was launched from Regina Trench. It succeeded well beyond expectations, and in addition to capturing Desire, Major Franklin Hall, with 41 volunteers, with only their rifles, bayonets, grenades and 2 Lewis Guns advanced a further 500 yards and captured part of Grandcourt Trench, including taking 115 prisoners. 80 of these were taken unaided by four privates; Roy, Thompson, Garneau and Winke.  \n\n==Officers Commanding==\n*Lieut.-Col.

In 1955 he married his second wife, Monica Forbes Curtis of the [[Forbes family]].

''Spill Out'' was written \"half of it on the booze and half off, and he didn't remember which half was which\".<ref name=white/> In 1976 Pudney developed cancer of the throat from which he died a year later in much pain. He wrote about his illness unflinchingly in his autobiographical ''Thank Goodness for Cake'', posthumously published in 1978.<ref name=dnb/> His grandson [[Toby Perkins]] is the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Chesterfield]].\n\n==Works==\n\n===Poetry===\n*''Spring Encounter'' (1933)\n*''Open the Sky'' ([[Boriswood]] 1934)\n*''Dispersal Point and other Air Poems'' (1942)\n*''The Grass Grew All Round'' (1942)\n*''Beyond This Disregard'' (1943) poems\n*''South of Forty'' (1943) poems\n*''Ten Summers'': Poems 1933-1943 (1944)\n*''Almanack of Hope'': Sonnets (1944)\n*''Air Force Poetry'' (1944) (anthology, edited with [[Henry Treece|Henry Treece]])\n*''Flight above Cloud'' (1944)\n*''World Still There'' (1945)\n*Selected Poems (1946)\n*''Low Life'' (1947)\n*''Commemorations'' (1948)\n*''Sixpenny Songs'' (1953)\n*Collected Poems (1957)\n*''Spill Out'': Poems and Ballads (1967)\n*''Spandrels'': Poems and Ballads (1969)\n*''Take This Orange'': Poems and Ballads (1971)\n*Selected Poems 1967-1973 (1973)\n*''Living in a One-Sided House'' (1976) poems\n*''Writers' Workshop'', poetry anthology publication, editor with [[Norman Hidden]] and [[Michael Johnson (editor)|Michael Johnson]] (from 1967)<ref>Durham University.

Pudney also wrote broad-ranging non-fiction, often commissioned, which served as his primary source of income. \n\n==Education and Early Career==\nJohn Pudney was born at [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley Marish]], the only son of Henry William Pudney (a farmer and countryman) and Mabel Sleigh Pudney. He was educated at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], where he first encountered [[W. H. Auden]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and [[Humphrey Spender]]. He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor.
