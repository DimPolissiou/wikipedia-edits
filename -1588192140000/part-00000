It is the largest town in the region of [[Zemgale]] (Semigalia). Jelgava was the capital of the united [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]] (1578\u20131795) and the administrative center of the [[Courland Governorate]] (1795\u20131918).\n\nJelgava is situated on a fertile plain rising only {{convert|3.5|m|1|abbr=off}} [[above mean sea level]] on the right bank of the river [[Lielupe]].  At high water the plain and sometimes the town as well can be flooded. It is a [[Jelgava Station|railway center]] and is also host to [[Jelgava Air Base]].  Its importance as a railway centre can be seen by the fact that it lies at the junction of over 6 railway lines connecting Riga to Lithuania, eastern and western Latvia, and Lithuania to the Baltic sea.\n\n== Name ==\n\nUntil 1917, the city was officially referred to as '''Mitau'''. The name Jelgava is believed to be derived from the [[Livonian language|Livonian]] word ''j\u0101lgab'', meaning \"town on the river.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Am-_PBCqIUcC&pg=PA124&lpg=PA124&dq=jelgava+name+meaning&source=bl&ots=zADJmjHbXf&sig=_HU-KyzeHqocFoLC00ZTCgjraw0&hl=en&ei=ufnLSfisDZmGsAafm5meCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result|title=Latvia as an Independent State|first=Alfred|last=Bilmanis|date=1 November 2008|publisher=Read Books|via=Google Books}}</ref> The origin of the German name ''Mitau'' is unclear, although it is suggested that it came from the [[Latvian language|Latvian]] words ''m\u012bt'' or ''main\u012bt'', meaning \"to exchange\" or \"to trade,\" thus making it \"trading-place.\"  An alternate explanation is that ''Mitau'' came from ''Mitte in der Aue'', German for \"the middle of the Aa\", referring to the Lielupe River, formerly known as the Courland Aa (''Kurl\u00e4ndische Aa'' in German). {{Citation needed|reason=This whole section does not cite any references or sources.|date=October 2008}}\n\n== History ==\nThe [[Livonian people|Livonian]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} settlement Jelgava began developing between the rivers Lielupe and Driksa during the 10th century. Led by the Grand Master [[:lv:Konr\u0101ds fon Manderns|Konrad von Mandern]], the crusading [[Livonian Order]] constructed the [[castle]] in Mitau on a natural island fortification (''Pilssala'') in 1265\u20131266. Using Mitau as a southern fortress, the German knights subdued the surrounding Livonians and Semigallians by 1290. The town rose in importance as a defensive fixture against the [[Lithuania]]ns to the south, who succeeded in plundering Jelgava in 1345.\n\nAs a result of the fall of the Livonian Order in the [[Livonian War]], Mitau became a town of the [[Duchy of Courland]] in 1561. Jelgava received city rights in 1573, and became the capital of the united duchies of Courland and Semigallia in 1578. When the Duchy of Courland split in 1596, Jelgava became the residence of Duke [[Friedrich Kettler]] of Semigallia. The city again became the capital of the united duchies in 1617. Because the duchy became a [[vassal]] of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], Jelgava was also referred to by the Polish name ''Mitawa''. The Commonwealth's repeated wars with [[Sweden]] subjected Jelgava to several sieges. Despite the wars, the city grew as a center for trade and industry. As Courland's neighbors increased in strength, however, the duchy and Jelgava began to fall under Russia's [[sphere of influence]]; [[Carl Christian Joseph of Saxony, Duke of Courland]] had to abdicate under Russian siege in 1763. The duchess from 1711 to 1730 was Anna Ivanovna, later Empress [[Anna I of Russia]].\n\nThe penultimate duke of Courland, [[Ernst Johann von Biron]], expanded the cultural aspects of Jelgava. He constructed the ducal palace and opened the first public library in the city. In 1775 the last Duke of Courland, [[Peter von Biron]], founded the [[Jelgava Gymnasium|Academia Petrina]], which became a cultural center for the country. The duke also encouraged theatrical performances at his court.\n[[File:Academia petrina.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Academia Petrina]]]]\n\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, the citizens of Jelgava clamored for more rights. However, [[Imperial Russia]] [[annexation|annexed]] the city with Courland in 1795 during the [[Partitions of Poland]]. As the seat of the [[Count of Provence]], the palace of Jelgava was the residence (1798\u20131801 and 1804\u20131807) of [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] before he became the French king. Although the city was occupied by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] troops during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], it was largely spared destruction.\n\nJelgava further expanded after the [[Riga\u2013Jelgava Railway|construction of its railway in 1868]]. The development of its infrastructure encouraged rural Latvians to migrate to the city, as merchants, craftsmen, teachers, and officials. By 1914 Jelgava had over 45,000 inhabitants. However, Jelgava suffered considerably after the outbreak of [[World War I]]. The spirited defence of Jelgava by two battalions of the Latvian Home Guard in 1915, helped inspire the formation of the [[Latvian Rifles]]. [[German Empire|German]] troops occupied the city during the war, and British prisoners of war, sent there as forced labour, suffered atrocious conditions and treatment.<ref>Meeting the Enemy by Richard Van Emden</ref> After the war, in 1919, Jelgava became a battleground between [[Bolshevik]] [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guards]], German [[Freikorps|paramilitaries]], and Latvian freedom fighters. After the [[Liberation of Jelgava (1919)|latter's victory in November 1919]], Jelgava became an important city in [[history of Latvia#Independence|independent Latvia]]. In 1925 a [[sugar factory]] was built in Jelgava, the first such factory in Latvia. In 1939 [[Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies]] was opened in [[Jelgava Palace]].\n\nAs a result of the [[Nazi-Soviet Pact]], Jelgava was occupied and annexed with the rest of Latvia by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1940 during [[World War II]]. Much of the city's remaining German population were resettled into the territory of German occupied Poland during the [[Nazi\u2013Soviet population transfers]]. German forces from [[Army Group North]] occupied Jelgava from 1941 to 1944 until the capture of the city by the [[Red Army]]. During the war, German police along with Latvian auxiliary police murdered the Jewish inhabitants of the city during a series of mass shootings (see [[Jelgava massacres]]). The main synagogue was burned to the ground.\n\nIn late July 1944, the Soviet [[Red army]] launched an attack from the south in the direction of Jelgava and [[Tukums]] to encircle the German [[Army Group North]]. Jelgava was declared a fortress (''Festung'') however, there were only a few scattered German and Latvian units in the city. From 30 July until 7 August, after heavy street fighting and several [[Strategic bombing|air raids]], the Red Army managed to occupy the left bank of the Lielupe river. In late August, the German army launched a counterattack on Jelgava from the north but it failed to drive back the Soviets. Jelgava remained on the frontline until 10 October when the German army retreated to [[Courland]]. \nThe city's historic centre, industry, rail network, and public buildings were heavily damaged by the fighting, with almost 90% of the city destroyed.\n[[File:19440816 soviet soldiers attack jelgava.jpg|200px|thumb|Soviet soldiers fight in the streets of Jelgava (summer 1944).]]\n\nJelgava was rebuilt in typical Soviet style after [[World War II]] as part of the [[Latvian SSR]]. Jelgava became home to several big factories. Among them were the sugar factory, which was heavily expanded from 1975 [[assembly line]], and administration buildings for the [[Riga Autobus Factory]] (RAF). \nFollowing Latvian independence, Jelgava has slowly regained its original Germanic heritage and is now a popular tourist site. Owing to Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies, many of Jelgava's inhabitants are students or people connected with education. For this reason Jelgava is sometimes called the ''Student capital of Latvia''.\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of 1 January 2017, the city had a population of 61,308.\n\n{{bar box\n|width = 300px\n|float = middle\n|title = Demographics of Jelgava 2017\n|titlebar = #ddd\n|bars =\n{{bar percent|Latvians|red|58.4}}\n{{bar percent|Russians|yellow|26.7}}\n{{bar percent|Belarusians|violet|5.3}}\n{{bar percent|Ukrainians|blue|2.5}}\n{{bar percent|Poles|orange|1.8}}\n{{bar percent|Romani|green|1.3}}\n{{bar percent|Lithuanians|black|1.4}}\n{{bar percent|Others|purple|2.6}}\n}}\n== Sights ==\n\nJelgava before the Second World War had regular, broad streets lined with the mansions of the [[Baltic German]] nobility who resided at the former capital of Courland.  The old castle (1266) of the dukes of Courland, situated on an island in the river, was destroyed by [[Ernst Johann von Biron|Duke Biren]], who had [[Jelgava Palace|a spacious palace]] erected (1738\u20131772) by [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] at the bridge across the Lielupe. The palace contains the [[sarcophagi]] of almost all of the Curonian dukes, except the last one. The future [[Louis XVIII]] sojourned in the palace between 1798 and 1800. It now functions as [[Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies]]. Other landmarks include the [[baroque architecture|Baroque]] church of [[:lv:Jelgavas Sv\u0113t\u0101s Annas eva\u0146\u0123\u0113liski luterisk\u0101 bazn\u012bca| St. Anne's Church]] (Liela Street 22a), the tower of the destroyed Jelgava St. Trinity Church (Akad\u0113mijas Street 1), and two handsome structures: the [[:lv:Villa Medem|Villa Medem]] and the [[Academia Petrina]].\n\nin addition the following cultural and historical objects can be seen: [[:lv:Jelgavas pils|Jelgava Castle]] (Liel\u0101 Street 2), Jelgava Old Town , [[:lv:Jelgavas Bezvain\u012bg\u0101s Jaunavas Marijas Romas kato\u013cu katedr\u0101le| St. Mary's Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception]] (Kato\u013cu Street 11) , [[:lv:Jelgavas Sv.

Jelgava, Latvia.jpg|thumb|Bus station in Jelgava, Latvia]]\n'''Jelgava''' ({{IPA-lv|j\u00e6l\u0261ava|pron|Lv-Jelgava.ogg}}; {{lang-de|Mitau}}; see also [[#Name|other names]]) is a city in central [[Latvia]] about {{convert|41|km|0|abbr=off}} southwest of [[Riga]] with 55,972 inhabitants (2019). It is the largest town in the region of [[Zemgale]] (Semigalia). Jelgava was the capital of the united [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]] (1578\u20131795) and the administrative center of the [[Courland Governorate]] (1795\u20131918).\n\nJelgava is situated on a fertile plain rising only {{convert|3.5|m|1|abbr=off}} [[above mean sea level]] on the right bank of the river [[Lielupe]].  At high water the plain and sometimes the town as well can be flooded. It is a [[Jelgava Station|railway center]] and is also host to [[Jelgava Air Base]].  Its importance as a railway centre can be seen by the fact that it lies at the junction of over 6 railway lines connecting Riga to Lithuania, eastern and western Latvia, and Lithuania to the Baltic sea.\n\n== Name ==\n\nUntil 1917, the city was officially referred to as '''Mitau'''. The name Jelgava is believed to be derived from the [[Livonian language|Livonian]] word ''j\u0101lgab'', meaning \"town on the river.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Am-_PBCqIUcC&pg=PA124&lpg=PA124&dq=jelgava+name+meaning&source=bl&ots=zADJmjHbXf&sig=_HU-KyzeHqocFoLC00ZTCgjraw0&hl=en&ei=ufnLSfisDZmGsAafm5meCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result|title=Latvia as an Independent State|first=Alfred|last=Bilmanis|date=1 November 2008|publisher=Read Books|via=Google Books}}</ref> The origin of the German name ''Mitau'' is unclear, although it is suggested that it came from the [[Latvian language|Latvian]] words ''m\u012bt'' or ''main\u012bt'', meaning \"to exchange\" or \"to trade,\" thus making it \"trading-place.\"  An alternate explanation is that ''Mitau'' came from ''Mitte in der Aue'', German for \"the middle of the Aa\", referring to the Lielupe River, formerly known as the Courland Aa (''Kurl\u00e4ndische Aa'' in German). {{Citation needed|reason=This whole section does not cite any references or sources.|date=October 2008}}\n\n== History ==\nThe [[Livonian people|Livonian]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} settlement Jelgava began developing between the rivers Lielupe and Driksa during the 10th century. Led by the Grand Master [[:lv:Konr\u0101ds fon Manderns|Konrad von Mandern]], the crusading [[Livonian Order]] constructed the [[castle]] in Mitau on a natural island fortification (''Pilssala'') in 1265\u20131266. Using Mitau as a southern fortress, the German knights subdued the surrounding Livonians and Semigallians by 1290. The town rose in importance as a defensive fixture against the [[Lithuania]]ns to the south, who succeeded in plundering Jelgava in 1345.\n\nAs a result of the fall of the Livonian Order in the [[Livonian War]], Mitau became a town of the [[Duchy of Courland]] in 1561. Jelgava received city rights in 1573, and became the capital of the united duchies of Courland and Semigallia in 1578. When the Duchy of Courland split in 1596, Jelgava became the residence of Duke [[Friedrich Kettler]] of Semigallia. The city again became the capital of the united duchies in 1617. Because the duchy became a [[vassal]] of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], Jelgava was also referred to by the Polish name ''Mitawa''. The Commonwealth's repeated wars with [[Sweden]] subjected Jelgava to several sieges. Despite the wars, the city grew as a center for trade and industry. As Courland's neighbors increased in strength, however, the duchy and Jelgava began to fall under Russia's [[sphere of influence]]; [[Carl Christian Joseph of Saxony, Duke of Courland]] had to abdicate under Russian siege in 1763. The duchess from 1711 to 1730 was Anna Ivanovna, later Empress [[Anna I of Russia]].\n\nThe penultimate duke of Courland, [[Ernst Johann von Biron]], expanded the cultural aspects of Jelgava. He constructed the ducal palace and opened the first public library in the city. In 1775 the last Duke of Courland, [[Peter von Biron]], founded the [[Jelgava Gymnasium|Academia Petrina]], which became a cultural center for the country. The duke also encouraged theatrical performances at his court.\n[[File:Academia petrina.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Academia Petrina]]]]\n\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, the citizens of Jelgava clamored for more rights. However, [[Imperial Russia]] [[annexation|annexed]] the city with Courland in 1795 during the [[Partitions of Poland]]. As the seat of the [[Count of Provence]], the palace of Jelgava was the residence (1798\u20131801 and 1804\u20131807) of [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] before he became the French king. Although the city was occupied by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] troops during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], it was largely spared destruction.\n\nJelgava further expanded after the [[Riga\u2013Jelgava Railway|construction of its railway in 1868]]. The development of its infrastructure encouraged rural Latvians to migrate to the city, as merchants, craftsmen, teachers, and officials. By 1914 Jelgava had over 45,000 inhabitants. However, Jelgava suffered considerably after the outbreak of [[World War I]]. The spirited defence of Jelgava by two battalions of the Latvian Home Guard in 1915, helped inspire the formation of the [[Latvian Rifles]]. [[German Empire|German]] troops occupied the city during the war, and British prisoners of war, sent there as forced labour, suffered atrocious conditions and treatment.<ref>Meeting the Enemy by Richard Van Emden</ref> After the war, in 1919, Jelgava became a battleground between [[Bolshevik]] [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guards]], German [[Freikorps|paramilitaries]], and Latvian freedom fighters. After the [[Liberation of Jelgava (1919)|latter's victory in November 1919]], Jelgava became an important city in [[history of Latvia#Independence|independent Latvia]]. In 1925 a [[sugar factory]] was built in Jelgava, the first such factory in Latvia. In 1939 [[Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies]] was opened in [[Jelgava Palace]].\n\nAs a result of the [[Nazi-Soviet Pact]], Jelgava was occupied and annexed with the rest of Latvia by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1940 during [[World War II]]. Much of the city's remaining German population were resettled into the territory of German occupied Poland during the [[Nazi\u2013Soviet population transfers]]. German forces from [[Army Group North]] occupied Jelgava from 1941 to 1944 until the capture of the city by the [[Red Army]]. During the war, German police along with Latvian auxiliary police murdered the Jewish inhabitants of the city during a series of mass shootings (see [[Jelgava massacres]]). The main synagogue was burned to the ground.\n\nIn late July 1944, the Soviet [[Red army]] launched an attack from the south in the direction of Jelgava and [[Tukums]] to encircle the German [[Army Group North]]. Jelgava was declared a fortress (''Festung'') however, there were only a few scattered German and Latvian units in the city. From 30 July until 7 August, after heavy street fighting and several [[Strategic bombing|air raids]], the Red Army managed to occupy the left bank of the Lielupe river. In late August, the German army launched a counterattack on Jelgava from the north but it failed to drive back the Soviets. Jelgava remained on the frontline until 10 October when the German army retreated to [[Courland]]. \nThe city's historic centre, industry, rail network, and public buildings were heavily damaged by the fighting, with almost 90% of the city destroyed.\n[[File:19440816 soviet soldiers attack jelgava.jpg|200px|thumb|Soviet soldiers fight in the streets of Jelgava (summer 1944).]]\n\nJelgava was rebuilt in typical Soviet style after [[World War II]] as part of the [[Latvian SSR]]. Jelgava became home to several big factories. Among them were the sugar factory, which was heavily expanded from 1975 [[assembly line]], and administration buildings for the [[Riga Autobus Factory]] (RAF). \nFollowing Latvian independence, Jelgava has slowly regained its original Germanic heritage and is now a popular tourist site. Owing to Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies, many of Jelgava's inhabitants are students or people connected with education. For this reason Jelgava is sometimes called the ''Student capital of Latvia''.\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of 1 January 2017, the city had a population of 61,308.\n\n{{bar box\n|width = 300px\n|float = middle\n|title = Demographics of Jelgava 2017\n|titlebar = #ddd\n|bars =\n{{bar percent|Latvians|red|58.4}}\n{{bar percent|Russians|yellow|26.7}}\n{{bar percent|Belarusians|violet|5.3}}\n{{bar percent|Ukrainians|blue|2.5}}\n{{bar percent|Poles|orange|1.8}}\n{{bar percent|Romani|green|1.3}}\n{{bar percent|Lithuanians|black|1.4}}\n{{bar percent|Others|purple|2.6}}\n}}\n== Sights ==\n\nJelgava before the Second World War had regular, broad streets lined with the mansions of the [[Baltic German]] nobility who resided at the former capital of Courland.  The old castle (1266) of the dukes of Courland, situated on an island in the river, was destroyed by [[Ernst Johann von Biron|Duke Biren]], who had [[Jelgava Palace|a spacious palace]] erected (1738\u20131772) by [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] at the bridge across the Lielupe. The palace contains the [[sarcophagi]] of almost all of the Curonian dukes, except the last one. The future [[Louis XVIII]] sojourned in the palace between 1798 and 1800. It now functions as [[Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies]]. Other landmarks include the [[baroque architecture|Baroque]] church of [[:lv:Jelgavas Sv\u0113t\u0101s Annas eva\u0146\u0123\u0113liski luterisk\u0101 bazn\u012bca| St. Anne's Church]] (Liela Street 22a), the tower of the destroyed Jelgava St. Trinity Church (Akad\u0113mijas Street 1), and two handsome structures: the [[:lv:Villa Medem|Villa Medem]] and the [[Academia Petrina]].\n\nin addition the following cultural and historical objects can be seen: [[:lv:Jelgavas pils|Jelgava Castle]] (Liel\u0101 Street 2), Jelgava Old Town , [[:lv:Jelgavas Bezvain\u012bg\u0101s Jaunavas Marijas Romas kato\u013cu katedr\u0101le| St. Mary's Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception]] (Kato\u013cu Street 11) , [[:lv:Jelgavas Sv.

This [[still life]] painting depicts a variety of French Baroque musical instruments, such as a [[natural horn]], [[transverse flute]], [[Musette de cour|musette]], [[pardessus de viole]], and [[lute]].]]\nA '''musical instrument''' is a device created or adapted to make [[Music|musical sounds]]. In principle, any object that produces sound can be considered a musical instrument\u2014it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument. The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments may have been used for ritual, such as a [[horn (music)|horn]] to signal success on the hunt, or a [[drum]] in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of [[melody|melodies]] for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications and technologies.\n\nThe date and origin of the first device considered a musical instrument is disputed. The oldest object that some scholars refer to as a musical instrument, a simple [[flute]], dates back as far as 67,000 years. Some consensus dates early flutes to about 37,000 years ago. However, most historians believe that determining a specific time of musical instrument invention is impossible, as many early musical instruments were made from animal skins, bone, wood and other non-durable materials.\n\nMusical instruments developed independently in many populated regions of the world. However, contact among civilizations caused rapid spread and adaptation of most instruments in places far from their origin. By the [[Middle Ages]], instruments from [[Mesopotamia]] were in [[maritime Southeast Asia]], and Europeans played instruments originating from North Africa. Development in the Americas occurred at a slower pace, but cultures of North, Central, and South America shared musical instruments. \n\nBy 1400, musical instrument development slowed in many areas and was dominated by the [[Western world|Occident]]. During the [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] periods of music, lasting from roughly 1750 to 1900, many new musical instruments were developed. While the evolution of traditional musical instruments slowed beginning in the 20th century, the proliferation of [[electricity]] led to the invention of new electric instruments, such as [[electric guitar]]s and [[synthesizer]]s.\n\nMusical instrument classification is a discipline in its own right, and many systems of classification have been used over the years. Instruments can be classified by their effective range, their material composition, their size, role, etc. However, the most common academic method, [[Hornbostel\u2013Sachs]], uses the means by which they produce sound. The academic study of musical instruments is called [[organology]].\n\n==Definition and basic operation==\n[[File:TamTam.jpg|thumb|right|225px|[[Bamileke]] [[slit drum]] drummers in Cameroon's [[West Province (Cameroon)|West Province]].]]\nA musical instrument is used to make [[Music|musical sounds]]. Once humans moved from making sounds with their bodies \u2014 for example, by clapping\u2014to using objects to create music from sounds, musical instruments were born.<ref name=\"Montagu1\">{{harvnb|Montagu|2007|p=1}}</ref> Primitive instruments were probably designed to emulate natural sounds, and their purpose was ritual rather than entertainment.<ref name=\"Rault9\">{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=9}}</ref> The concept of melody and the artistic pursuit of musical composition were probably unknown to early players of musical instruments. A person sounding a bone flute to signal the start of a hunt does so without thought of the modern notion of \"making music\".<ref name=\"Rault9\" />\n\nMusical instruments are constructed in a broad array of styles and shapes, using many different materials. Early musical instruments were made from \"found objects\" such as shells and plant parts.<ref name=\"Rault9\" /> As instruments evolved, so did the selection and quality of materials. Virtually every material in nature has been used by at least one culture to make musical instruments.<ref name=\"Rault9\" /> One plays a musical instrument by interacting with it in some way \u2014 for example, by plucking the strings on a [[string instrument]], striking the surface of a drum, or blowing into an animal horn.<ref name=\"Rault9\" />\n\n==Archaeology==\nResearchers have discovered archaeological evidence of musical instruments in many parts of the world. Some finds are 67,000 years old, however their status as musical instruments is often in dispute. Consensus solidifying about artifacts dated back to around 37,000 years old and later. Only artifacts made from durable materials or using durable methods tend to survive. As such, the specimens found cannot be irrefutably placed as the earliest musical instruments.<ref name=\"Blades34\">{{harvnb|Blades|1992|p=34}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fl\u00fbte pal\u00e9olithique (mus\u00e9e national de Slov\u00e9nie, Ljubljana) (9420310527).jpg|thumb|Found in [[Slovenia]], the [[Divje Babe Flute]] is considered the world's [[paleolithic flutes|oldest known musical instrument]]]]\nIn July 1995, Slovenian archaeologist Ivan Turk discovered a bone carving in the northwest region of [[Slovenia]]. The carving, named the [[Divje Babe Flute]], features four holes that Canadian musicologist Bob Fink determined could have been used to play four notes of a [[diatonic scale]].

Comparing and organizing instruments based on their complexity is misleading, since advancements in musical instruments have sometimes reduced complexity. For example, construction of early [[slit drum]]s involved felling and hollowing out large trees; later slit drums were made by opening bamboo stalks, a much simpler task.<ref name=\"Sachs60\">{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=60}}</ref>\n\nGerman musicologist [[Curt Sachs]], one of the most prominent [[Musicology|musicologists]]<ref name=\"Brown\">{{harvnb|Brown|2008}}</ref> and [[Ethnomusicology|musical ethnologists]]<ref name=\"Baines37\">{{harvnb|Baines|1993|p=37}}</ref> in modern times, argues that it is misleading to arrange the development of musical instruments by workmanship, since cultures advance at different rates and have access to different raw materials. For example, contemporary [[anthropology|anthropologists]] comparing musical instruments from two cultures that existed at the same time but differed in organization, culture, and handicraft [[Anthropological theories of value|cannot determine which instruments are more \"primitive\"]].<ref name=\"Sachs61\">{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=61}}</ref> Ordering instruments by geography is also not totally reliable, as it cannot always be determined when and how cultures contacted one another and shared knowledge. Sachs proposed that a geographical chronology until approximately 1400 is preferable, however, due to its limited subjectivity.<ref name=\"Sachs63\">{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=63}}</ref> Beyond 1400, one can follow the overall development of musical instruments by time period.<ref name=\"Sachs63\" />\n\nThe science of marking the order of musical instrument development relies on archaeological artifacts, artistic depictions, and literary references. Since data in one research path can be inconclusive, all three paths provide a better historical picture.<ref name=\"Blades34\" />\n\n===Primitive and prehistoric===\n[[File:Two Teponaztli.jpg|thumb|Two [[Aztec]] slit drums (''[[teponaztli]]''). The characteristic \"'''H'''\" slits can be seen on the top of the drum in the foreground.]]\n[[File:Guitar (molo).jpg|thumb|Guitar (molo)]]\nUntil the 19th century AD, European-written music histories began with mythological accounts of how musical instruments were invented. Such accounts included [[Jubal (Bible)|Jubal]], descendant of [[Cain]] and \"father of all such as handle the harp and the organ\", [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], inventor of the [[Pan flute|pan pipes]], and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], who is said to have made a dried [[tortoise]] shell into the first [[lyre]]. Modern histories have replaced such mythology with anthropological speculation, occasionally informed by archeological evidence. Scholars agree that there was no definitive \"invention\" of the musical instrument since the definition of the term \"musical instrument\" is completely subjective to both the scholar and the would-be inventor. For example, a ''[[Homo habilis]]'' slapping his body could be the makings of a musical instrument regardless of the being's intent.<ref name=\"Sachs297\">{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=297}}</ref> Music is an amazing thing!!\n\n\nAmong the first devices external to the human body that are considered instruments are [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattles]], stampers, and various [[drum]]s.<ref name=\"Blades36\">{{harvnb|Blades|1992|p=36}}</ref> These instruments evolved due to the human motor impulse to add sound to emotional movements such as dancing.<ref name=\"Sachs26\">{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=26}}</ref> Eventually, some cultures assigned ritual functions to their musical instruments, using them for hunting and various ceremonies.<ref name=\"Rault34\">{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=34}}</ref> Those cultures developed more complex percussion instruments and other instruments such as ribbon reeds, flutes, and trumpets. Some of these labels carry far different connotations from those used in modern day; early flutes and trumpets are so-labeled for their basic operation and function rather than resemblance to modern instruments.<ref name=Sachs34>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=34\u201352}}</ref> Among early cultures for whom drums developed ritual, even sacred importance are the [[Chukchi people]] of the [[Russian Far East]], the indigenous people of [[Melanesia]], and many cultures of [[Africa]]. In fact, drums were pervasive throughout every African culture.<ref name=\"Blades51\">{{harvnb|Blades|1992|p=51}}</ref> One East African tribe, the [[Wahinda]], believed it was so holy that seeing a drum would be fatal to any person other than the sultan.<ref name=Sachs35>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=35}}</ref>\n\nHumans eventually developed the concept of using musical instruments to produce [[melody]], which was previously common only in singing. Similar to the process of [[reduplication]] in language, instrument players first developed repetition and then arrangement. An early form of melody was produced by pounding two stamping tubes of slightly different sizes\u2014one tube would produce a \"clear\" sound and the other would answer with a \"darker\" sound. Such instrument pairs also included [[Bullroarer (music)|bullroarers]], slit drums, shell trumpets, and skin drums. Cultures who used these instrument pairs associated them with gender; the \"father\" was the bigger or more energetic instrument, while the \"mother\" was the smaller or duller instrument. Musical instruments existed in this form for thousands of years before patterns of three or more tones would evolve in the form of the earliest [[xylophone]].<ref name=Sachs52>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=52\u201353}}</ref> Xylophones originated in the mainland and archipelago of [[Southeast Asia]], eventually spreading to Africa, the Americas, and Europe.<ref name=\"Marcuse24\">{{harvnb|Marcuse|1975|pp=24\u201328}}</ref> Along with xylophones, which ranged from simple sets of three \"leg bars\" to carefully tuned sets of parallel bars, various cultures developed instruments such as the [[harp|ground harp]], [[zither|ground zither]], [[musical bow]], and [[Jew's harp|jaw harp]].<ref name=Sachs53>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=53\u201359}}</ref>\n\n===Antiquity===\nImages of musical instruments begin to appear in Mesopotamian artifacts in 2800 BC or earlier. Beginning around 2000 BC, [[Sumer]]ian and [[Babylon]]ian cultures began delineating two distinct classes of musical instruments due to [[division of labor]] and the evolving class system. Popular instruments, simple and playable by anyone, evolved differently from professional instruments whose development focused on effectiveness and skill.<ref name=Sachs67>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=67}}</ref> Despite this development, very few musical instruments have been recovered in [[Mesopotamia]]. Scholars must rely on artifacts and [[cuneiform]] texts written in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] or [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] to reconstruct the early history of musical instruments in Mesopotamia. Even the process of assigning names to these instruments is challenging since there is no clear distinction among various instruments and the words used to describe them.<ref name=Sachs68>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=68\u201369}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Sumerian and Babylonian artists mainly depicted ceremonial instruments, historians have distinguished six [[idiophone]]s used in early Mesopotamia: concussion clubs, clappers, [[Sistrum|sistra]], bells, cymbals, and rattles.<ref name=Sachs69>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=69}}</ref> Sistra are depicted prominently in a great relief of [[Amenhotep III]],<ref name=Remnant168>{{harvnb|Remnant|1989|p=168}}</ref> and are of particular interest because similar designs have been found in far-reaching places such as [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and among the Native American [[Yaqui]] tribe.<ref name=Sachs70>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=70}}</ref> The people of Mesopotamia preferred stringed instruments, as evidenced by their proliferation in Mesopotamian figurines, plaques, and seals. Innumerable varieties of harps are depicted, as well as lyres and lutes, the forerunner of modern stringed instruments such as the [[violin]].<ref name=Sachs82>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=82}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Egyptian lute players 001.jpg|thumb|[[Ancient Egypt]]ian tomb painting depicting lute players, [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]] ({{circa|1350}} BC)]]\nMusical instruments used by the Egyptian culture before 2700 BC bore striking similarity to those of Mesopotamia, leading historians to conclude that the civilizations must have been in contact with one another. Sachs notes that Egypt did not possess any instruments that the Sumerian culture did not also possess.<ref name=Sachs86>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=86}}</ref> However, by 2700 BC the cultural contacts seem to have dissipated; the lyre, a prominent ceremonial instrument in Sumer, did not appear in Egypt for another 800 years.<ref name=Sachs86 /> Clappers and concussion sticks appear on Egyptian vases as early as 3000 BC. The civilization also made use of sistra, vertical flutes, double clarinets, arched and angular harps, and various drums.<ref name=\"Rault71\">{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=71}}</ref>\n\nLittle history is available in the period between 2700 BC and 1500 BC, as Egypt (and indeed, Babylon) entered a long violent period of war and destruction. This period saw the [[Kassites]] destroy the Babylonian empire in Mesopotamia and the [[Hyksos]] destroy the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]]. When the Pharaohs of Egypt conquered Southwest Asia in around 1500 BC, the cultural ties to Mesopotamia were renewed and Egypt's musical instruments also reflected heavy influence from Asiatic cultures.<ref name=Sachs86 /> Under their new cultural influences, the people of the [[New Kingdom]] began using [[oboe]]s, trumpets, [[lyre]]s, [[lute]]s, [[castanets]], and [[cymbal]]s.<ref name=Sachs98>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=98\u2013104}}</ref>\n\nUnlike Mesopotamia and Egypt, professional musicians did not exist in [[Israel]] between 2000 and 1000 BC. While the history of musical instruments in Mesopotamia and Egypt relies on artistic representations, the culture in Israel produced few such representations.

The first record of this type of influence is in 384 AD, when China established an orchestra in its imperial court after a conquest in [[Turkestan]]. Influences from Middle East, Persia, India, Mongolia, and other countries followed. In fact, Chinese tradition attributes many musical instruments from this period to those regions and countries.<ref name=Sachs207>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=207}}</ref> Cymbals gained popularity, along with more advanced trumpets, clarinets, oboes, flutes, drums, and lutes.<ref name=Sachs218>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=218}}</ref> Some of the first [[Bow (music)|bowed]] zithers appeared in China in the 9th or 10th century, influenced by Mongolian culture.<ref name=Sachs216>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=216}}</ref>\n\nIndia experienced similar development to China in the Middle Ages; however, stringed instruments developed differently as they accommodated different styles of music. While stringed instruments of China were designed to produce precise tones capable of matching the tones of chimes, stringed instruments of India were considerably more flexible. This flexibility suited the slides and [[tremolo]]s of Hindu music. Rhythm was of paramount importance in Indian music of the time, as evidenced by the frequent depiction of drums in reliefs dating to the Middle Ages. The emphasis on rhythm is an aspect native to Indian music.<ref name=Sachs221>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=221}}</ref> Historians divide the development of musical instruments in medieval India between pre-Islamic and Islamic periods due to the different influence each period provided.<ref name=Sachs222>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=222}}</ref>\n\nIn pre-Islamic times, idiophones such as [[handbell]]s, cymbals, and peculiar instruments resembling gongs came into wide use in Hindu music. The gong-like instrument was a bronze disk that was struck with a hammer instead of a mallet. Tubular drums, stick zithers ([[veena]]), short fiddles, double and triple flutes, coiled trumpets, and curved India horns emerged in this time period.<ref name=Sachs223>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=222\u2013228}}</ref> Islamic influences brought new types of drums, perfectly circular or octagonal as opposed to the irregular pre-Islamic drums.<ref name=Sachs229>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=229}}</ref> Persian influence brought oboes and [[sitar]]s, although Persian sitars had three strings and Indian version had from four to seven.<ref name=Sachs231>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=231}}</ref> The Islamic culture also introduced double-[[clarinet]] instruments as the [[Alboka]] (from Arab, al-buq or \"horn\") nowadays only alive in [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]].

Keyboards and lutes developed as [[polyphonic]] instruments, and composers arranged increasingly complex pieces using more advanced [[tablature]]. Composers also began designing pieces of music for specific instruments.<ref name=\"Sachs297\" /> In the latter half of the sixteenth century, [[orchestration]] came into common practice as a method of writing music for a variety of instruments. Composers now specified orchestration where individual performers once applied their own discretion.<ref name=Sachs298>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=298}}</ref> The polyphonic style dominated popular music, and the instrument makers responded accordingly.<ref name=Sachs351>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=351}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The Duet c1635 by Saftleven.jpg|thumb|200px|''The Duet'', by Dutch painter [[Cornelis Saftleven]], c. 1635. It shows a [[violin]]ist and a [[cittern]] player.]]\nBeginning in about 1400, the rate of development of musical instruments increased in earnest as compositions demanded more dynamic sounds. People also began writing books about creating, playing, and cataloging musical instruments; the first such book was [[Sebastian Virdung]]'s 1511 treatise ''Musica getuscht und ausgezogen'' ('Music Germanized and Abstracted').<ref name=\"Sachs298\" /> Virdung's work is noted as being particularly thorough for including descriptions of \"irregular\" instruments such as hunters' horns and cow bells, though Virdung is critical of the same. Other books followed, including [[Arnolt Schlick]]'s ''Spiegel der Orgelmacher und Organisten'' ('Mirror of Organ Makers and Organ Players') the following year, a treatise on organ building and organ playing.<ref name=Sachs299>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=299}}</ref> Of the instructional books and references published in the Renaissance era, one is noted for its detailed description and depiction of all wind and stringed instruments, including their relative sizes. This book, the ''Syntagma musicum'' by [[Michael Praetorius]], is now considered an authoritative reference of sixteenth-century musical instruments.<ref name=Sachs301>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=301}}</ref>\n\nIn the sixteenth century, musical instrument builders gave most instruments \u2013 such as the violin \u2013 the \"classical shapes\" they retain today. An emphasis on aesthetic beauty also developed; listeners were as pleased with the physical appearance of an instrument as they were with its sound. Therefore, builders paid special attention to materials and workmanship, and instruments became collectibles in homes and museums.<ref name=Sachs302>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=302}}</ref> It was during this period that makers began constructing instruments of the same type in various sizes to meet the demand of ''consorts'', or ensembles playing works written for these groups of instruments.<ref name=Sachs303>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=303}}</ref>\n\nInstrument builders developed other features that endure today. For example, while organs with multiple keyboards and pedals already existed, the first organs with [[Organ stop|solo stops]] emerged in the early fifteenth century. These stops were meant to produce a mixture of timbres, a development needed for the complexity of music of the time.<ref name=Sachs307>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=307}}</ref> Trumpets evolved into their modern form to improve portability, and players used [[Mute (music)|mutes]] to properly blend into [[chamber music]].<ref name=Sachs328>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=328}}</ref>\n\n====Baroque====\n[[File:Stainer.jpg|thumb|[[Baroque]] mounted [[Jacob Stainer]] violin from 1658]]\nBeginning in the seventeenth century, composers began writing works to a higher emotional degree. They felt that [[polyphony]] better suited the emotional style they were aiming for and began writing musical parts for instruments that would complement the singing human voice.<ref name=Sachs351/> As a result, many instruments that were incapable of larger ranges and dynamics, and therefore were seen as unemotional, fell out of favor. One such instrument was the shawm.<ref name=Sachs352>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=352}}</ref> Bowed instruments such as the violin, [[viola]], [[baryton]], and various lutes dominated popular music.<ref name=Sachs353>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=353\u2013357}}</ref> Beginning in around 1750, however, the lute disappeared from musical compositions in favor of the rising popularity of the [[guitar]].<ref name=Sachs374>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=374}}</ref> As the prevalence of [[string orchestra]]s rose, wind instruments such as the flute, oboe, and bassoon were readmitted to counteract the monotony of hearing only strings.<ref name=Sachs380>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=380}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-seventeenth century, what was known as a hunter's horn underwent transformation into an \"art instrument\" consisting of a lengthened tube, a narrower bore, a wider bell, and much wider range. The details of this transformation are unclear, but the modern [[French horn|horn]] or, more colloquially, French horn, had emerged by 1725.<ref name=Sachs384>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=384}}</ref> The [[slide trumpet]] appeared, a variation that includes a long-throated mouthpiece that slid in and out, allowing the player infinite adjustments in [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]. This variation on the trumpet was unpopular due to the difficulty involved in playing it.<ref name=Sachs385>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=385}}</ref> Organs underwent tonal changes in the Baroque period, as manufacturers such as Abraham Jordan of London made the stops more expressive and added devices such as expressive pedals.

The design changes that broadened the quality of timbres allowed instruments to produce a wider variety of expression. Large orchestras rose in popularity and, in parallel, the composers determined to produce entire orchestral scores that made use of the expressive abilities of modern instruments. Since instruments were involved in collaborations of a much larger scale, their designs had to evolve to accommodate the demands of the orchestra.<ref name=Sachs388>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=388}}</ref>\n\nSome instruments also had to become louder to fill larger halls and be heard over sizable orchestras. Flutes and bowed instruments underwent many modifications and design changes\u2014most of them unsuccessful\u2014in efforts to increase volume. Other instruments were changed just so they could play their parts in the scores. Trumpets traditionally had a \"defective\" range\u2014they were incapable of producing certain notes with precision.<ref name=Sachs389>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=389}}</ref> New instruments such as the [[clarinet]], [[saxophone]], and [[tuba]] became fixtures in orchestras. Instruments such as the clarinet also grew into entire \"families\" of instruments capable of different ranges: small clarinets, normal clarinets, bass clarinets, and so on.<ref name=Sachs388/>\n\nAccompanying the changes to timbre and volume was a shift in the typical pitch used to tune instruments. Instruments meant to play together, as in an orchestra, must be tuned to the same standard lest they produce audibly different sounds while playing the same notes. Beginning in 1762, the average [[concert pitch]] began rising from a low of 377 vibrations to a high of 457 in 1880 Vienna.<ref name=Sachs390>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=390}}</ref> Different regions, countries, and even instrument manufacturers preferred different standards, making orchestral collaboration a challenge.

Various methods examine aspects such as the physical properties of the instrument (material, color, shape, etc.), the use for the instrument, the means by which music is produced with the instrument, the [[Range (music)|range]] of the instrument, and the instrument's place in an [[orchestra]] or other ensemble. Most methods are specific to a geographic area or cultural group and were developed to serve the unique classification requirements of the group.<ref name=Montagu210>{{harvnb|Montagu|2007|p=210}}</ref> The problem with these specialized classification schemes is that they tend to break down once they are applied outside of their original area. For example, a system based on instrument use would fail if a culture invented a new use for the same instrument. Scholars recognize [[Hornbostel\u2013Sachs]] as the only system that applies to any culture and, more important, provides only possible classification for each instrument.<ref name=Montagu211>{{harvnb|Montagu|2007|p=211}}</ref><ref name=Kartomi176>{{harvnb|Kartomi|1990|p=176}}</ref> The most common types of instrument classifications are [[String instrument|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], [[Woodwind instrument|woodwind]], and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]].\n\n===Ancient systems===\nAn ancient Hindu system named the ''[[Natya Shastra]]'', written by the sage [[Bharata Muni]] and dating from between 200 BC and 200 AD, divides instruments into four main classification groups: instruments where the sound is produced by vibrating strings; percussion instruments with skin heads; instruments where the sound is produced by vibrating columns of air; and \"solid\", or non-skin, percussion instruments.<ref name=Montagu211/> This system was adapted to some degree in 12th-century Europe by [[Johannes de Muris]], who used the terms ''tensibilia'' (stringed instruments), ''inflatibilia'' (wind instruments), and ''percussibilia'' (all percussion instruments).<ref name=\"Rault190\">{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=190}}</ref> In 1880, [[Victor-Charles Mahillon]] adapted the ''Natya Shastra'' and assigned Greek labels to the four classifications: ''chordophones'' (stringed instruments), ''membranophones'' (skin-head percussion instruments), ''aerophones'' (wind instruments), and ''autophones'' (non-skin percussion instruments).<ref name=Montagu211/>\n\n===Hornbostel\u2013Sachs===\n[[Erich von Hornbostel]] and [[Curt Sachs]] adopted Mahillon's scheme and published an extensive new scheme for classification in ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Ethnologie'' in 1914. Hornbostel and Sachs used most of Mahillon's system, but replaced the term ''autophone'' with ''idiophone''.<ref name=Montagu211/>\n\nThe original [[Hornbostel\u2013Sachs]] system classified instruments into four main groups:\n* [[Idiophone]]s, which produce sound by vibrating the primary body of the instrument itself; they are sorted into concussion, percussion, shaken, scraped, split, and plucked idiophones, such as [[claves]], [[xylophone]], [[guiro]], [[slit drum]], [[mbira]], and [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]].<ref name=Marcuse3>{{harvnb|Marcuse|1975|p=3}}</ref>\n* [[Membranophone]]s, which produce sound by a vibrating a stretched membrane; they may be [[drums]] (further sorted by the shape of the shell), which are struck by hand, with a stick, or rubbed, but [[kazoos]] and other instruments that use a stretched membrane for the primary sound (not simply to modify sound produced in another way) are also considered membranophones.<ref name=Marcuse117>{{harvnb|Marcuse|1975|p=117}}</ref>\n* [[Chordophone]]s, which produce sound by vibrating one or more strings; they are sorted into according to the relationship between the string(s) and the sounding board or chamber. For example, if the strings are laid out parallel to the sounding board and there is no neck, the instrument is a [[zither]] whether it is plucked like an [[autoharp]] or struck with hammers like a [[piano]]. If the instrument has strings parallel to the sounding board or chamber and the strings extend past the board with a neck, then the instrument is a [[lute]], whether the sound chamber is constructed of wood like a [[guitar]] or uses a membrane like a [[banjo]].<ref name=Marcuse177>{{harvnb|Marcuse|1975|p=177}}</ref>\n* [[Aerophone]]s, which produce a sound with a vibrating column of air; they are sorted into free aerophones such as a [[bullroarer]] or [[whip]], which move freely through the air; reedless aerophones such as [[flute]]s and recorders, which cause the air to pass over a sharp edge; reed instruments, which use a vibrating reed (this category may be further divided into two classifications: single-reeded and double-reeded instruments. Examples of the former are clarinets and saxophones, while the latter includes oboes and bassoons); and lip-vibrated aerophones such as [[trumpet]]s, trombones and tubas, for which the lips themselves function as vibrating reeds.<ref name=Marcuse549>{{harvnb|Marcuse|1975|p=549}}</ref>\n\nSachs later added a fifth category, [[electrophone]]s, such as [[theremin]]s, which produce sound by electronic means.<ref name=\"Sachs447\"/> Within each category are many subgroups. The system has been criticised and revised over the years, but remains widely used by [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologists]] and [[organology|organologists]].<ref name=\"Rault190\" /><ref name=\"Campbell39\">{{harvnb|Campbell|Greated|Myers|2004|p=39}}</ref>\n\n===Schaeffner===\nAndre Schaeffner, a curator at the [[Mus\u00e9e de l'Homme]], disagreed with the Hornbostel\u2013Sachs system and developed his own system in 1932. Schaeffner believed that the pure physics of a musical instrument, rather than its specific construction or playing method, should always determine its classification. (Hornbostel\u2013Sachs, for example, divide aerophones on the basis of sound production, but membranophones on the basis of the shape of the instrument). His system divided instruments into two categories: instruments with solid, vibrating bodies and instruments containing vibrating air.<ref name=Kartomi174>{{harvnb|Kartomi|1990|pp=174\u2013175}}</ref>\n\n===Range===\n{{main|Range (music)}}\nMusical instruments are also often classified by their musical range in comparison with other instruments in the same family. This exercise is useful when placing instruments in context of an orchestra or other ensemble.\n\nThese terms are named after singing voice classifications:\n* [[Soprano]] instruments: [[flute]], [[violin]], [[soprano saxophone]], [[trumpet]], [[clarinet]], [[oboe]], [[piccolo]]\n* [[Alto]] instruments: [[alto saxophone]], [[french horn]], [[english horn]], [[viola]], [[alto horn]]\n* [[Tenor]] instruments: [[trombone]], [[tenor saxophone]], [[guitar]], [[tenor drum]]\n* [[Baritone]] instruments: [[bassoon]], [[baritone saxophone]], [[bass clarinet]], [[cello]], [[baritone horn]], [[euphonium]]\n* [[Bass (sound)|Bass]] instruments: [[double bass]], [[bass guitar]], [[contrabassoon]], [[bass saxophone]], [[tuba]], [[bass drum]]\n\nSome instruments fall into more than one category. For example, the cello may be considered tenor, baritone or bass, depending on how its music fits into the ensemble. The trombone and French horn may be alto, tenor, baritone, or bass depending on the range it is played in. Many instruments have their range as part of their name: [[soprano saxophone]], [[tenor saxophone]], [[baritone horn]], [[alto flute]], [[bass guitar]], etc. Additional adjectives describe instruments above the soprano range or [[contrabass|below the bass]], for example the [[sopranino saxophone]] and [[contrabass clarinet]]. When used in the name of an instrument, these terms are relative, describing the instrument's range in comparison to other instruments of its family and not in comparison to the human voice range or instruments of other families. For example, a bass flute's range is from C<sub>3</sub> to F\u266f<sub>6</sub>, while a bass clarinet plays about one octave lower.\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:African music instrument made from a can 01.jpg|thumb|African [[Mbira|kalimba]] made from a food can]]\n<!--[[Musical instrument construction]] redirects directly here.-->\nThe materials used in making musical instruments vary greatly by culture and application. Many of the materials have special significance owing to their source or rarity. Some cultures worked substances from the human body into their instruments. In ancient Mexico, for example, the material drums were made from might contain actual human body parts obtained from sacrificial offerings. In New Guinea, drum makers would mix human blood into the adhesive used to attach the [[Acoustic membrane|membrane]].<ref name=\"Rault184\">{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=184}}</ref> [[Morus (plant)|Mulberry]] trees are held in high regard in China owing to their mythological significance\u2014instrument makers would hence use them to make zithers. The [[Yakuts]] believe that making drums from trees struck by lightning gives them a special connection to nature.<ref name=\"Rault185\">{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=185}}</ref>\n\nMusical instrument construction is a specialized trade that requires years of training, practice, and sometimes an apprenticeship. Most makers of musical instruments specialize in one genre of instruments; for example, a [[luthier]] makes only stringed instruments. Some make only one type of instrument such as a piano. Whatever the instrument constructed, the instrument maker must consider materials, construction technique, and decoration, creating a balanced instrument that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.<ref name=\"Rault195\">{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=195}}</ref> Some builders are focused on a more artistic approach and develop [[experimental musical instrument]]s, often meant for individual playing styles developed by the builder themself.\n\n==User interfaces==\n[[File:Usnaconsole2.jpg|thumb|The five-manual, 522-stop detached console at the [[Naval Academy Chapel|United States Naval Academy Chapel]] crafted by R.

[[Keyboard instrument]]s are any instruments that are played with a [[musical keyboard]], which is a row of small keys that can be pressed. Every key generates one or more sounds; most keyboard instruments have extra means ([[Piano#Pedals|pedals]] for a piano, [[Organ stop|stops]] and a [[pedal keyboard]] for an organ) to manipulate these sounds.

This [[still life]] painting depicts a variety of French Baroque musical instruments, such as a [[natural horn]], [[transverse flute]], [[Musette de cour|musette]], [[pardessus de viole]], and [[lute]].]]\nA '''musical instrument''' is a device created or adapted to make [[Music|musical sounds]]. In principle, any object that produces sound can be considered a musical instrument\u2014it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument. The history of musical instruments dates to the beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments may have been used for ritual, such as a [[horn (music)|horn]] to signal success on the hunt, or a [[drum]] in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of [[melody|melodies]] for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications and technologies.\n\nThe date and origin of the first device considered a musical instrument is disputed. The oldest object that some scholars refer to as a musical instrument, a simple [[flute]], dates back as far as 67,000 years. Some consensus dates early flutes to about 37,000 years ago. However, most historians believe that determining a specific time of musical instrument invention is impossible, as many early musical instruments were made from animal skins, bone, wood and other non-durable materials.\n\nMusical instruments developed independently in many populated regions of the world. However, contact among civilizations caused rapid spread and adaptation of most instruments in places far from their origin. By the [[Middle Ages]], instruments from [[Mesopotamia]] were in [[maritime Southeast Asia]], and Europeans played instruments originating from North Africa. Development in the Americas occurred at a slower pace, but cultures of North, Central, and South America shared musical instruments. \n\nBy 1400, musical instrument development slowed in many areas and was dominated by the [[Western world|Occident]]. During the [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] periods of music, lasting from roughly 1750 to 1900, many new musical instruments were developed. While the evolution of traditional musical instruments slowed beginning in the 20th century, the proliferation of [[electricity]] led to the invention of new electric instruments, such as [[electric guitar]]s and [[synthesizer]]s.\n\nMusical instrument classification is a discipline in its own right, and many systems of classification have been used over the years. Instruments can be classified by their effective range, their material composition, their size, role, etc. However, the most common academic method, [[Hornbostel\u2013Sachs]], uses the means by which they produce sound. The academic study of musical instruments is called [[organology]].\n\n==Definition and basic operation==\n[[File:TamTam.jpg|thumb|right|225px|[[Bamileke]] [[slit drum]] drummers in Cameroon's [[West Province (Cameroon)|West Province]].]]\nA musical instrument is used to make [[Music|musical sounds]]. Once humans moved from making sounds with their bodies \u2014 for example, by clapping\u2014to using objects to create music from sounds, musical instruments were born.<ref name=\"Montagu1\">{{harvnb|Montagu|2007|p=1}}</ref> Primitive instruments were probably designed to emulate natural sounds, and their purpose was ritual rather than entertainment.<ref name=\"Rault9\">{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=9}}</ref> The concept of melody and the artistic pursuit of musical composition were probably unknown to early players of musical instruments. A person sounding a bone flute to signal the start of a hunt does so without thought of the modern notion of \"making music\".<ref name=\"Rault9\" />\n\nMusical instruments are constructed in a broad array of styles and shapes, using many different materials. Early musical instruments were made from \"found objects\" such as shells and plant parts.<ref name=\"Rault9\" /> As instruments evolved, so did the selection and quality of materials. Virtually every material in nature has been used by at least one culture to make musical instruments.<ref name=\"Rault9\" /> One plays a musical instrument by interacting with it in some way \u2014 for example, by plucking the strings on a [[string instrument]], striking the surface of a drum, or blowing into an animal horn.<ref name=\"Rault9\" />\n\n==Archaeology==\nResearchers have discovered archaeological evidence of musical instruments in many parts of the world. Some finds are 67,000 years old, however their status as musical instruments is often in dispute. Consensus solidifying about artifacts dated back to around 37,000 years old and later. Only artifacts made from durable materials or using durable methods tend to survive. As such, the specimens found cannot be irrefutably placed as the earliest musical instruments.<ref name=\"Blades34\">{{harvnb|Blades|1992|p=34}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fl\u00fbte pal\u00e9olithique (mus\u00e9e national de Slov\u00e9nie, Ljubljana) (9420310527).jpg|thumb|Found in [[Slovenia]], the [[Divje Babe Flute]] is considered the world's [[paleolithic flutes|oldest known musical instrument]]]]\nIn July 1995, Slovenian archaeologist Ivan Turk discovered a bone carving in the northwest region of [[Slovenia]].

Comparing and organizing instruments based on their complexity is misleading, since advancements in musical instruments have sometimes reduced complexity. For example, construction of early [[slit drum]]s involved felling and hollowing out large trees; later slit drums were made by opening bamboo stalks, a much simpler task.<ref name=\"Sachs60\">{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=60}}</ref>\n\nGerman musicologist [[Curt Sachs]], one of the most prominent [[Musicology|musicologists]]<ref name=\"Brown\">{{harvnb|Brown|2008}}</ref> and [[Ethnomusicology|musical ethnologists]]<ref name=\"Baines37\">{{harvnb|Baines|1993|p=37}}</ref> in modern times, argues that it is misleading to arrange the development of musical instruments by workmanship, since cultures advance at different rates and have access to different raw materials. For example, contemporary [[anthropology|anthropologists]] comparing musical instruments from two cultures that existed at the same time but differed in organization, culture, and handicraft [[Anthropological theories of value|cannot determine which instruments are more \"primitive\"]].<ref name=\"Sachs61\">{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=61}}</ref> Ordering instruments by geography is also not totally reliable, as it cannot always be determined when and how cultures contacted one another and shared knowledge.

Since data in one research path can be inconclusive, all three paths provide a better historical picture.<ref name=\"Blades34\" />\n\n===Primitive and prehistoric===\n[[File:Two Teponaztli.jpg|thumb|Two [[Aztec]] slit drums (''[[teponaztli]]''). The characteristic \"'''H'''\" slits can be seen on the top of the drum in the foreground.]]\n[[File:Guitar (molo).jpg|thumb|Guitar (molo)]]\nUntil the 19th century AD, European-written music histories began with mythological accounts of how musical instruments were invented. Such accounts included [[Jubal (Bible)|Jubal]], descendant of [[Cain]] and \"father of all such as handle the harp and the organ\", [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], inventor of the [[Pan flute|pan pipes]], and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], who is said to have made a dried [[tortoise]] shell into the first [[lyre]]. Modern histories have replaced such mythology with anthropological speculation, occasionally informed by archeological evidence. Scholars agree that there was no definitive \"invention\" of the musical instrument since the definition of the term \"musical instrument\" is completely subjective to both the scholar and the would-be inventor. For example, a ''[[Homo habilis]]'' slapping his body could be the makings of a musical instrument regardless of the being's intent.<ref name=\"Sachs297\">{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=297}}</ref>\n\nAmong the first devices external to the human body that are considered instruments are [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattles]], stampers, and various [[drum]]s.<ref name=\"Blades36\">{{harvnb|Blades|1992|p=36}}</ref> These instruments evolved due to the human motor impulse to add sound to emotional movements such as dancing.<ref name=\"Sachs26\">{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=26}}</ref> Eventually, some cultures assigned ritual functions to their musical instruments, using them for hunting and various ceremonies.<ref name=\"Rault34\">{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=34}}</ref> Those cultures developed more complex percussion instruments and other instruments such as ribbon reeds, flutes, and trumpets. Some of these labels carry far different connotations from those used in modern day; early flutes and trumpets are so-labeled for their basic operation and function rather than resemblance to modern instruments.<ref name=Sachs34>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=34\u201352}}</ref> Among early cultures for whom drums developed ritual, even sacred importance are the [[Chukchi people]] of the [[Russian Far East]], the indigenous people of [[Melanesia]], and many cultures of [[Africa]]. In fact, drums were pervasive throughout every African culture.<ref name=\"Blades51\">{{harvnb|Blades|1992|p=51}}</ref> One East African tribe, the [[Wahinda]], believed it was so holy that seeing a drum would be fatal to any person other than the sultan.<ref name=Sachs35>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=35}}</ref>\n\nHumans eventually developed the concept of using musical instruments to produce [[melody]], which was previously common only in singing. Similar to the process of [[reduplication]] in language, instrument players first developed repetition and then arrangement. An early form of melody was produced by pounding two stamping tubes of slightly different sizes\u2014one tube would produce a \"clear\" sound and the other would answer with a \"darker\" sound. Such instrument pairs also included [[Bullroarer (music)|bullroarers]], slit drums, shell trumpets, and skin drums. Cultures who used these instrument pairs associated them with gender; the \"father\" was the bigger or more energetic instrument, while the \"mother\" was the smaller or duller instrument. Musical instruments existed in this form for thousands of years before patterns of three or more tones would evolve in the form of the earliest [[xylophone]].<ref name=Sachs52>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=52\u201353}}</ref> Xylophones originated in the mainland and archipelago of [[Southeast Asia]], eventually spreading to Africa, the Americas, and Europe.<ref name=\"Marcuse24\">{{harvnb|Marcuse|1975|pp=24\u201328}}</ref> Along with xylophones, which ranged from simple sets of three \"leg bars\" to carefully tuned sets of parallel bars, various cultures developed instruments such as the [[harp|ground harp]], [[zither|ground zither]], [[musical bow]], and [[Jew's harp|jaw harp]].<ref name=Sachs53>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=53\u201359}}</ref>\n\n===Antiquity===\nImages of musical instruments begin to appear in Mesopotamian artifacts in 2800 BC or earlier. Beginning around 2000 BC, [[Sumer]]ian and [[Babylon]]ian cultures began delineating two distinct classes of musical instruments due to [[division of labor]] and the evolving class system. Popular instruments, simple and playable by anyone, evolved differently from professional instruments whose development focused on effectiveness and skill.<ref name=Sachs67>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=67}}</ref> Despite this development, very few musical instruments have been recovered in [[Mesopotamia]]. Scholars must rely on artifacts and [[cuneiform]] texts written in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] or [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] to reconstruct the early history of musical instruments in Mesopotamia. Even the process of assigning names to these instruments is challenging since there is no clear distinction among various instruments and the words used to describe them.<ref name=Sachs68>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=68\u201369}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Sumerian and Babylonian artists mainly depicted ceremonial instruments, historians have distinguished six [[idiophone]]s used in early Mesopotamia: concussion clubs, clappers, [[Sistrum|sistra]], bells, cymbals, and rattles.<ref name=Sachs69>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=69}}</ref> Sistra are depicted prominently in a great relief of [[Amenhotep III]],<ref name=Remnant168>{{harvnb|Remnant|1989|p=168}}</ref> and are of particular interest because similar designs have been found in far-reaching places such as [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and among the Native American [[Yaqui]] tribe.<ref name=Sachs70>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=70}}</ref> The people of Mesopotamia preferred stringed instruments, as evidenced by their proliferation in Mesopotamian figurines, plaques, and seals. Innumerable varieties of harps are depicted, as well as lyres and lutes, the forerunner of modern stringed instruments such as the [[violin]].<ref name=Sachs82>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=82}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Egyptian lute players 001.jpg|thumb|[[Ancient Egypt]]ian tomb painting depicting lute players, [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]] ({{circa|1350}} BC)]]\nMusical instruments used by the Egyptian culture before 2700 BC bore striking similarity to those of Mesopotamia, leading historians to conclude that the civilizations must have been in contact with one another. Sachs notes that Egypt did not possess any instruments that the Sumerian culture did not also possess.<ref name=Sachs86>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=86}}</ref> However, by 2700 BC the cultural contacts seem to have dissipated; the lyre, a prominent ceremonial instrument in Sumer, did not appear in Egypt for another 800 years.<ref name=Sachs86 /> Clappers and concussion sticks appear on Egyptian vases as early as 3000 BC. The civilization also made use of sistra, vertical flutes, double clarinets, arched and angular harps, and various drums.<ref name=\"Rault71\">{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=71}}</ref>\n\nLittle history is available in the period between 2700 BC and 1500 BC, as Egypt (and indeed, Babylon) entered a long violent period of war and destruction. This period saw the [[Kassites]] destroy the Babylonian empire in Mesopotamia and the [[Hyksos]] destroy the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]]. When the Pharaohs of Egypt conquered Southwest Asia in around 1500 BC, the cultural ties to Mesopotamia were renewed and Egypt's musical instruments also reflected heavy influence from Asiatic cultures.<ref name=Sachs86 /> Under their new cultural influences, the people of the [[New Kingdom]] began using [[oboe]]s, trumpets, [[lyre]]s, [[lute]]s, [[castanets]], and [[cymbal]]s.<ref name=Sachs98>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=98\u2013104}}</ref>\n\nUnlike Mesopotamia and Egypt, professional musicians did not exist in [[Israel]] between 2000 and 1000 BC. While the history of musical instruments in Mesopotamia and Egypt relies on artistic representations, the culture in Israel produced few such representations. Scholars must therefore rely on information gleaned from the [[Bible]] and the [[Talmud]].<ref name=Sachs105>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=105}}</ref> The Hebrew texts mention two prominent instruments associated with [[Jubal (Bible)|Jubal]]: the ''ugab'' (pipes) and ''[[kinnor]]'' (lyre).<ref name=Sachs106>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=106}}</ref> Other instruments of the period included the ''tof'' ([[frame drum]]), ''pa'amon'' (small bells or jingles), [[shofar]], and the trumpet-like ''hasosra''.<ref name=Sachs108>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=108\u2013113}}</ref>\n\nThe introduction of a monarchy in Israel during the 11th&nbsp;century BC produced the first professional musicians and with them a drastic increase in the number and variety of musical instruments.<ref name=Sachs114>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=114}}</ref> However, identifying and classifying the instruments remains a challenge due to the lack of artistic interpretations. For example, stringed instruments of uncertain design called nevals and asors existed, but neither archaeology nor etymology can clearly define them.<ref name=Sachs116>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=116}}</ref> In her book ''A Survey of Musical Instruments'', American musicologist Sibyl Marcuse proposes that the nevel must be similar to vertical harp due to its relation to ''nabla'', the Phoenician term for \"harp\".<ref name=\"Marcuse385\">{{harvnb|Marcuse|1975|p=385}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Greece]], [[Rome]], and [[Etruria]], the use and development of musical instruments stood in stark contrast to those cultures' achievements in architecture and sculpture. The instruments of the time were simple and virtually all of them were imported from other cultures.<ref name=Sachs128>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=128}}</ref> Lyres were the principal instrument, as musicians used them to honor the gods.<ref name=Sachs129>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=129}}</ref> Greeks played a variety of wind instruments they classified as ''[[aulos]]'' (reeds) or ''[[syrinx (instrument)|syrinx]]'' (flutes); Greek writing from that time reflects a serious study of reed production and playing technique.<ref name=Campbell82/> Romans played reed instruments named ''[[tibia (instrument)|tibia]]'', featuring side-holes that could be opened or closed, allowing for greater flexibility in playing modes.<ref name=Campbell83>{{harvnb|Campbell|Greated|Myers|2004|p=83}}</ref> Other instruments in common use in the region included vertical harps derived from those of the [[Orient]], lutes of Egyptian design, various pipes and organs, and clappers, which were played primarily by women.<ref name=Sachs149>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=149}}</ref>\n\nEvidence of musical instruments in use by early civilizations of [[India]] is almost completely lacking, making it impossible to reliably attribute instruments to the [[Munda languages|Munda]] and [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] language-speaking cultures that first settled the area. Rather, the history of musical instruments in the area begins with the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] that emerged around 3000 BC. Various rattles and whistles found among excavated artifacts are the only physical evidence of musical instruments.<ref name=Sachs151>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=151}}</ref> A clay statuette indicates the use of drums, and examination of the [[Indus script]] has also revealed representations of vertical arched harps identical in design to those depicted in Sumerian artifacts. This discovery is among many indications that the Indus Valley and Sumerian cultures maintained cultural contact. Subsequent developments in musical instruments in India occurred with the [[Rigveda]], or hymns. These songs used various drums, shell trumpets, harps, and flutes.<ref name=Sachs152>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=152}}</ref> Other prominent instruments in use during the early centuries AD were the [[Snake charming|snake charmer's]] [[double clarinet]], [[bagpipes]], barrel drums, cross flutes, and short lutes.

The Chinese believed that music was an essential part of character and community, and developed a unique system of classifying their musical instruments according to their material makeup.<ref name=Sachs162>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=162\u2013164}}</ref>\n\n[[Idiophone]]s were extremely important in Chinese music, hence the majority of early instruments were idiophones.

For example, they had no stringed instruments; all of their instruments were idiophones, drums, and wind instruments such as flutes and trumpets. Of these, only the flute was capable of producing a melody.<ref name=Sachs192>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=192}}</ref> In contrast, [[pre-Columbian]] [[South America]]n civilizations in areas such as modern-day [[Peru]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]], and [[Chile]] were less advanced culturally but more advanced musically. South American cultures of the time used pan-pipes as well as varieties of flutes, idiophones, drums, and shell or wood trumpets.<ref name=Sachs196>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=196\u2013201}}</ref>\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Painting ney.jpg|thumb|A young Persian lady playing a ''[[ney]]'', painted on [[Hasht Behesht]] walls in [[Esfahan]], [[Safavid dynasty]]. ]]\nDuring the period of time loosely referred to as the [[Middle Ages]], China developed a tradition of integrating musical influence from other regions.  The first record of this type of influence is in 384 AD, when China established an orchestra in its imperial court after a conquest in [[Turkestan]]. Influences from Middle East, Persia, India, Mongolia, and other countries followed. In fact, Chinese tradition attributes many musical instruments from this period to those regions and countries.<ref name=Sachs207>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=207}}</ref> Cymbals gained popularity, along with more advanced trumpets, clarinets, oboes, flutes, drums, and lutes.<ref name=Sachs218>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=218}}</ref> Some of the first [[Bow (music)|bowed]] zithers appeared in China in the 9th or 10th century, influenced by Mongolian culture.<ref name=Sachs216>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=216}}</ref>\n\nIndia experienced similar development to China in the Middle Ages; however, stringed instruments developed differently as they accommodated different styles of music. While stringed instruments of China were designed to produce precise tones capable of matching the tones of chimes, stringed instruments of India were considerably more flexible. This flexibility suited the slides and [[tremolo]]s of Hindu music. Rhythm was of paramount importance in Indian music of the time, as evidenced by the frequent depiction of drums in reliefs dating to the Middle Ages. The emphasis on rhythm is an aspect native to Indian music.<ref name=Sachs221>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=221}}</ref> Historians divide the development of musical instruments in medieval India between pre-Islamic and Islamic periods due to the different influence each period provided.<ref name=Sachs222>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=222}}</ref>\n\nIn pre-Islamic times, idiophones such as [[handbell]]s, cymbals, and peculiar instruments resembling gongs came into wide use in Hindu music. The gong-like instrument was a bronze disk that was struck with a hammer instead of a mallet. Tubular drums, stick zithers ([[veena]]), short fiddles, double and triple flutes, coiled trumpets, and curved India horns emerged in this time period.<ref name=Sachs223>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=222\u2013228}}</ref> Islamic influences brought new types of drums, perfectly circular or octagonal as opposed to the irregular pre-Islamic drums.<ref name=Sachs229>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=229}}</ref> Persian influence brought oboes and [[sitar]]s, although Persian sitars had three strings and Indian version had from four to seven.<ref name=Sachs231>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=231}}</ref> The Islamic culture also introduced double-[[clarinet]] instruments as the [[Alboka]] (from Arab, al-buq or \"horn\") nowadays only alive in [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]].

Keyboards and lutes developed as [[polyphonic]] instruments, and composers arranged increasingly complex pieces using more advanced [[tablature]]. Composers also began designing pieces of music for specific instruments.<ref name=\"Sachs297\" /> In the latter half of the sixteenth century, [[orchestration]] came into common practice as a method of writing music for a variety of instruments. Composers now specified orchestration where individual performers once applied their own discretion.<ref name=Sachs298>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=298}}</ref> The polyphonic style dominated popular music, and the instrument makers responded accordingly.<ref name=Sachs351>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=351}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The Duet c1635 by Saftleven.jpg|thumb|200px|''The Duet'', by Dutch painter [[Cornelis Saftleven]], c. 1635. It shows a [[violin]]ist and a [[cittern]] player.]]\nBeginning in about 1400, the rate of development of musical instruments increased in earnest as compositions demanded more dynamic sounds. People also began writing books about creating, playing, and cataloging musical instruments; the first such book was [[Sebastian Virdung]]'s 1511 treatise ''Musica getuscht und ausgezogen'' ('Music Germanized and Abstracted').<ref name=\"Sachs298\" /> Virdung's work is noted as being particularly thorough for including descriptions of \"irregular\" instruments such as hunters' horns and cow bells, though Virdung is critical of the same. Other books followed, including [[Arnolt Schlick]]'s ''Spiegel der Orgelmacher und Organisten'' ('Mirror of Organ Makers and Organ Players') the following year, a treatise on organ building and organ playing.<ref name=Sachs299>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=299}}</ref> Of the instructional books and references published in the Renaissance era, one is noted for its detailed description and depiction of all wind and stringed instruments, including their relative sizes. This book, the ''Syntagma musicum'' by [[Michael Praetorius]], is now considered an authoritative reference of sixteenth-century musical instruments.<ref name=Sachs301>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=301}}</ref>\n\nIn the sixteenth century, musical instrument builders gave most instruments \u2013 such as the violin \u2013 the \"classical shapes\" they retain today. An emphasis on aesthetic beauty also developed; listeners were as pleased with the physical appearance of an instrument as they were with its sound. Therefore, builders paid special attention to materials and workmanship, and instruments became collectibles in homes and museums.<ref name=Sachs302>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=302}}</ref> It was during this period that makers began constructing instruments of the same type in various sizes to meet the demand of ''consorts'', or ensembles playing works written for these groups of instruments.<ref name=Sachs303>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=303}}</ref>\n\nInstrument builders developed other features that endure today. For example, while organs with multiple keyboards and pedals already existed, the first organs with [[Organ stop|solo stops]] emerged in the early fifteenth century. These stops were meant to produce a mixture of timbres, a development needed for the complexity of music of the time.<ref name=Sachs307>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=307}}</ref> Trumpets evolved into their modern form to improve portability, and players used [[Mute (music)|mutes]] to properly blend into [[chamber music]].<ref name=Sachs328>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=328}}</ref>\n\n====Baroque====\n[[File:Stainer.jpg|thumb|[[Baroque]] mounted [[Jacob Stainer]] violin from 1658]]\nBeginning in the seventeenth century, composers began writing works to a higher emotional degree. They felt that [[polyphony]] better suited the emotional style they were aiming for and began writing musical parts for instruments that would complement the singing human voice.<ref name=Sachs351/> As a result, many instruments that were incapable of larger ranges and dynamics, and therefore were seen as unemotional, fell out of favor. One such instrument was the shawm.<ref name=Sachs352>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=352}}</ref> Bowed instruments such as the violin, [[viola]], [[baryton]], and various lutes dominated popular music.<ref name=Sachs353>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|pp=353\u2013357}}</ref> Beginning in around 1750, however, the lute disappeared from musical compositions in favor of the rising popularity of the [[guitar]].<ref name=Sachs374>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=374}}</ref> As the prevalence of [[string orchestra]]s rose, wind instruments such as the flute, oboe, and bassoon were readmitted to counteract the monotony of hearing only strings.<ref name=Sachs380>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=380}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-seventeenth century, what was known as a hunter's horn underwent transformation into an \"art instrument\" consisting of a lengthened tube, a narrower bore, a wider bell, and much wider range.

The design changes that broadened the quality of timbres allowed instruments to produce a wider variety of expression. Large orchestras rose in popularity and, in parallel, the composers determined to produce entire orchestral scores that made use of the expressive abilities of modern instruments. Since instruments were involved in collaborations of a much larger scale, their designs had to evolve to accommodate the demands of the orchestra.<ref name=Sachs388>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=388}}</ref>\n\nSome instruments also had to become louder to fill larger halls and be heard over sizable orchestras. Flutes and bowed instruments underwent many modifications and design changes\u2014most of them unsuccessful\u2014in efforts to increase volume. Other instruments were changed just so they could play their parts in the scores. Trumpets traditionally had a \"defective\" range\u2014they were incapable of producing certain notes with precision.<ref name=Sachs389>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=389}}</ref> New instruments such as the [[clarinet]], [[saxophone]], and [[tuba]] became fixtures in orchestras. Instruments such as the clarinet also grew into entire \"families\" of instruments capable of different ranges: small clarinets, normal clarinets, bass clarinets, and so on.<ref name=Sachs388/>\n\nAccompanying the changes to timbre and volume was a shift in the typical pitch used to tune instruments. Instruments meant to play together, as in an orchestra, must be tuned to the same standard lest they produce audibly different sounds while playing the same notes. Beginning in 1762, the average [[concert pitch]] began rising from a low of 377 vibrations to a high of 457 in 1880 Vienna.<ref name=Sachs390>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=390}}</ref> Different regions, countries, and even instrument manufacturers preferred different standards, making orchestral collaboration a challenge. Despite even the efforts of two organized international summits attended by noted composers like [[Hector Berlioz]], no standard could be agreed upon.<ref name=Sachs391>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=391}}</ref>\n\n====Twentieth century to present====\n[[File:FGF museum 01.

Examples of electromechanical instruments include [[Hammond organ]]s and [[electric guitar]]s.<ref name=Sachs447/> Sachs also defined a subcategory of \"radioelectric instruments\" such as the [[theremin]], which produces music through the player's hand movements around two [[antennas]].<ref name=Sachs448>{{harvnb|Sachs|1940|p=448}}</ref>\n[[Image:Moog Modular 55 img2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A 1975 [[Moog synthesizer|Moog]] Modular 55 synthesizer]]\nThe latter half of the 20th century saw the evolution of [[synthesizer]]s, which produce sound using analog or digital circuits and [[microchips]].

Various methods examine aspects such as the physical properties of the instrument (material, color, shape, etc.), the use for the instrument, the means by which music is produced with the instrument, the [[Range (music)|range]] of the instrument, and the instrument's place in an [[orchestra]] or other ensemble. Most methods are specific to a geographic area or cultural group and were developed to serve the unique classification requirements of the group.<ref name=Montagu210>{{harvnb|Montagu|2007|p=210}}</ref> The problem with these specialized classification schemes is that they tend to break down once they are applied outside of their original area. For example, a system based on instrument use would fail if a culture invented a new use for the same instrument. Scholars recognize [[Hornbostel\u2013Sachs]] as the only system that applies to any culture and, more important, provides only possible classification for each instrument.<ref name=Montagu211>{{harvnb|Montagu|2007|p=211}}</ref><ref name=Kartomi176>{{harvnb|Kartomi|1990|p=176}}</ref> The most common types of instrument classifications are [[String instrument|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], [[Woodwind instrument|woodwind]], and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]].\n\n===Ancient systems===\nAn ancient Hindu system named the ''[[Natya Shastra]]'', written by the sage [[Bharata Muni]] and dating from between 200 BC and 200 AD, divides instruments into four main classification groups: instruments where the sound is produced by vibrating strings; percussion instruments with skin heads; instruments where the sound is produced by vibrating columns of air; and \"solid\", or non-skin, percussion instruments.<ref name=Montagu211/> This system was adapted to some degree in 12th-century Europe by [[Johannes de Muris]], who used the terms ''tensibilia'' (stringed instruments), ''inflatibilia'' (wind instruments), and ''percussibilia'' (all percussion instruments).<ref name=\"Rault190\">{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=190}}</ref> In 1880, [[Victor-Charles Mahillon]] adapted the ''Natya Shastra'' and assigned Greek labels to the four classifications: ''chordophones'' (stringed instruments), ''membranophones'' (skin-head percussion instruments), ''aerophones'' (wind instruments), and ''autophones'' (non-skin percussion instruments).<ref name=Montagu211/>\n\n===Hornbostel\u2013Sachs===\n[[Erich von Hornbostel]] and [[Curt Sachs]] adopted Mahillon's scheme and published an extensive new scheme for classification in ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Ethnologie'' in 1914. Hornbostel and Sachs used most of Mahillon's system, but replaced the term ''autophone'' with ''idiophone''.<ref name=Montagu211/>\n\nThe original [[Hornbostel\u2013Sachs]] system classified instruments into four main groups:\n* [[Idiophone]]s, which produce sound by vibrating the primary body of the instrument itself; they are sorted into concussion, percussion, shaken, scraped, split, and plucked idiophones, such as [[claves]], [[xylophone]], [[guiro]], [[slit drum]], [[mbira]], and [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]].<ref name=Marcuse3>{{harvnb|Marcuse|1975|p=3}}</ref>\n* [[Membranophone]]s, which produce sound by a vibrating a stretched membrane; they may be [[drums]] (further sorted by the shape of the shell), which are struck by hand, with a stick, or rubbed, but [[kazoos]] and other instruments that use a stretched membrane for the primary sound (not simply to modify sound produced in another way) are also considered membranophones.<ref name=Marcuse117>{{harvnb|Marcuse|1975|p=117}}</ref>\n* [[Chordophone]]s, which produce sound by vibrating one or more strings; they are sorted into according to the relationship between the string(s) and the sounding board or chamber. For example, if the strings are laid out parallel to the sounding board and there is no neck, the instrument is a [[zither]] whether it is plucked like an [[autoharp]] or struck with hammers like a [[piano]]. If the instrument has strings parallel to the sounding board or chamber and the strings extend past the board with a neck, then the instrument is a [[lute]], whether the sound chamber is constructed of wood like a [[guitar]] or uses a membrane like a [[banjo]].<ref name=Marcuse177>{{harvnb|Marcuse|1975|p=177}}</ref>\n* [[Aerophone]]s, which produce a sound with a vibrating column of air; they are sorted into free aerophones such as a [[bullroarer]] or [[whip]], which move freely through the air; reedless aerophones such as [[flute]]s and recorders, which cause the air to pass over a sharp edge; reed instruments, which use a vibrating reed (this category may be further divided into two classifications: single-reeded and double-reeded instruments. Examples of the former are clarinets and saxophones, while the latter includes oboes and bassoons); and lip-vibrated aerophones such as [[trumpet]]s, trombones and tubas, for which the lips themselves function as vibrating reeds.<ref name=Marcuse549>{{harvnb|Marcuse|1975|p=549}}</ref>\n\nSachs later added a fifth category, [[electrophone]]s, such as [[theremin]]s, which produce sound by electronic means.<ref name=\"Sachs447\"/> Within each category are many subgroups. The system has been criticised and revised over the years, but remains widely used by [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologists]] and [[organology|organologists]].<ref name=\"Rault190\" /><ref name=\"Campbell39\">{{harvnb|Campbell|Greated|Myers|2004|p=39}}</ref>\n\n===Schaeffner===\nAndre Schaeffner, a curator at the [[Mus\u00e9e de l'Homme]], disagreed with the Hornbostel\u2013Sachs system and developed his own system in 1932. Schaeffner believed that the pure physics of a musical instrument, rather than its specific construction or playing method, should always determine its classification. (Hornbostel\u2013Sachs, for example, divide aerophones on the basis of sound production, but membranophones on the basis of the shape of the instrument). His system divided instruments into two categories: instruments with solid, vibrating bodies and instruments containing vibrating air.<ref name=Kartomi174>{{harvnb|Kartomi|1990|pp=174\u2013175}}</ref>\n\n===Range===\n{{main|Range (music)}}\nMusical instruments are also often classified by their musical range in comparison with other instruments in the same family. This exercise is useful when placing instruments in context of an orchestra or other ensemble.\n\nThese terms are named after singing voice classifications:\n* [[Soprano]] instruments: [[flute]], [[violin]], [[soprano saxophone]], [[trumpet]], [[clarinet]], [[oboe]], [[piccolo]]\n* [[Alto]] instruments: [[alto saxophone]], [[french horn]], [[english horn]], [[viola]], [[alto horn]]\n* [[Tenor]] instruments: [[trombone]], [[tenor saxophone]], [[guitar]], [[tenor drum]]\n* [[Baritone]] instruments: [[bassoon]], [[baritone saxophone]], [[bass clarinet]], [[cello]], [[baritone horn]], [[euphonium]]\n* [[Bass (sound)|Bass]] instruments: [[double bass]], [[bass guitar]], [[contrabassoon]], [[bass saxophone]], [[tuba]], [[bass drum]]\n\nSome instruments fall into more than one category. For example, the cello may be considered tenor, baritone or bass, depending on how its music fits into the ensemble. The trombone and French horn may be alto, tenor, baritone, or bass depending on the range it is played in. Many instruments have their range as part of their name: [[soprano saxophone]], [[tenor saxophone]], [[baritone horn]], [[alto flute]], [[bass guitar]], etc. Additional adjectives describe instruments above the soprano range or [[contrabass|below the bass]], for example the [[sopranino saxophone]] and [[contrabass clarinet]]. When used in the name of an instrument, these terms are relative, describing the instrument's range in comparison to other instruments of its family and not in comparison to the human voice range or instruments of other families. For example, a bass flute's range is from C<sub>3</sub> to F\u266f<sub>6</sub>, while a bass clarinet plays about one octave lower.\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:African music instrument made from a can 01.jpg|thumb|African [[Mbira|kalimba]] made from a food can]]\n<!--[[Musical instrument construction]] redirects directly here.-->\nThe materials used in making musical instruments vary greatly by culture and application. Many of the materials have special significance owing to their source or rarity. Some cultures worked substances from the human body into their instruments. In ancient Mexico, for example, the material drums were made from might contain actual human body parts obtained from sacrificial offerings. In New Guinea, drum makers would mix human blood into the adhesive used to attach the [[Acoustic membrane|membrane]].<ref name=\"Rault184\">{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=184}}</ref> [[Morus (plant)|Mulberry]] trees are held in high regard in China owing to their mythological significance\u2014instrument makers would hence use them to make zithers. The [[Yakuts]] believe that making drums from trees struck by lightning gives them a special connection to nature.<ref name=\"Rault185\">{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=185}}</ref>\n\nMusical instrument construction is a specialized trade that requires years of training, practice, and sometimes an apprenticeship. Most makers of musical instruments specialize in one genre of instruments; for example, a [[luthier]] makes only stringed instruments. Some make only one type of instrument such as a piano. Whatever the instrument constructed, the instrument maker must consider materials, construction technique, and decoration, creating a balanced instrument that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.<ref name=\"Rault195\">{{harvnb|Rault|2000|p=195}}</ref> Some builders are focused on a more artistic approach and develop [[experimental musical instrument]]s, often meant for individual playing styles developed by the builder themself.\n\n==User interfaces==\n[[File:Usnaconsole2.jpg|thumb|The five-manual, 522-stop detached console at the [[Naval Academy Chapel|United States Naval Academy Chapel]] crafted by R.

[[Keyboard instrument]]s are any instruments that are played with a [[musical keyboard]], which is a row of small keys that can be pressed. Every key generates one or more sounds; most keyboard instruments have extra means ([[Piano#Pedals|pedals]] for a piano, [[Organ stop|stops]] and a [[pedal keyboard]] for an organ) to manipulate these sounds. They may produce sound by wind being fanned ([[organ (music)|organ]]) or pumped ([[accordion]]),<ref name=\"bicknell\">Bicknell, Stephen (1999). \"The organ case\".

The [[theremin]], an [[electrophone]], is played without physical contact by the player. The theremin senses the proximity of the player's hands, which triggers changes in its sound. More recently, a [[MIDI controller]] keyboard used with a [[digital audio workstation]] may have a musical keyboard and a bank of sliders, knobs, and buttons that change many sound parameters of a [[synthesizer]].\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of musical instruments]]\n* [[Folk instrument]]\n* [[Experimental musical instrument]]\n* [[Recording studio as an instrument]]\n* [[Music instrument technology]]\n* [[Orchestra]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{citation |last=Baines |first=Anthony |title=Brass Instruments: Their History and Development |publisher=Dover Publications |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-486-27574-1}}\n* {{citation |last=Bicknell |first=Stephen |title=The History of the English Organ |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-521-65409-8}}\n* {{citation |last=Blades |first=James |title=Percussion Instruments and Their History |publisher=Bold Strummer Ltd |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-933224-61-2 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/percussioninstru00jame }}\n* {{citation |last=Brown |first=Howard Mayer |title=Sachs, Curt |publisher=Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians |year=2008 |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/24256 |accessdate=5 June 2008}}\n* {{citation |last1=Campbell |first1=Murray |last2=Greated |first2=Clive A. |last3=Myers |first3=Arnold |title=Musical Instruments: History, Technology, and Performance of Instruments of Western Music |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-19-816504-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/musicalinstrumen00dona }}\n* {{citation |last=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |title=Archeologists discover ice age dwellers' flute |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=30 December 2004 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2004/12/30/flute-prehistoric041230.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813200036/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2004/12/30/flute-prehistoric041230.html |archivedate=13 August 2010 |accessdate=7 February 2009}}\n* {{citation |last1=Chase |first1=Philip G. |last2=Nowell |first2=April |title=Taphonomy of a Suggested Middle Paleolithic Bone Flute from Slovenia |date=August\u2013October 1998 |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=39 |issue=4 |page=549 |doi=10.1086/204771}}\n* {{citation |last=Collinson |first=Francis M. |title=The Bagpipe |publisher=Routledge |year=1975 |isbn=978-0-7100-7913-8}}\n* {{citation |last=de Schauensee |first=Maude |title=Two Lyres from Ur |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-924171-88-8}}\n* {{citation |last=Grillet |first=Laurent |title=Les ancetres du violon v.1 |year=1901 |publisher=Paris}}\n* {{citation |last=Kartomi |first=Margaret J. |title=On Concepts and Classifications of Musical Instruments |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-226-42548-1}}\n* {{citation |last=Manning |first=Peter |title=Electronic and Computer Music |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-19-517085-6}}\n* {{citation |last=Marcuse |first=Sibyl |title=A Survey of Musical Instruments |publisher=Harper & Row |year=1975 |isbn=978-0-06-012776-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/surveyofmusicali00marc }}\n* {{citation |last=Montagu |first=Jeremy |title=Origins and Development of Musical Instruments |publisher=The Scarecrow Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-8108-5657-8}}\n* {{citation |last=Moorey |first=P.R.S. |title=What Do We Know About the People Buried in the Royal Cemetery? |journal=Expedition |volume=20 |issue=1 |year=1977 |pages=24\u201340}}\n* {{citation |last1=Pinch |first1=Revor |last2=Trocco |first2=Frank |title=Analog Days: The Invention and Impact of the Moog Synthesizer |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-674-01617-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/analogdaysinvent00trev }}\n* {{citation |last=Rault |first=Lucie |title=Musical Instruments: A Worldwide Survey of Traditional Music-making |publisher=Thames & Hudson Ltd |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-500-51035-3}}\n* {{citation |last=Remnant |first=Mary |title=Musical Instruments: An Illustrated History from Antiquity to the Present |publisher=Batsford |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-7134-5169-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/musicalinstrumen0000remn_h0w6 }}\n* {{citation |last=Sachs |first=Curt |title=The History of Musical Instruments |publisher=Dover Publications |year=1940 |isbn=978-0-486-45265-4}}\n* {{citation |last=Slovenian Academy of Sciences |title=Early Music |date=11 April 1997 |journal=Science |volume=276 |issue=5310 |pages=203\u2013205 |doi=10.1126/science.276.5310.203g}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last=Wade-Matthews |first=Max |title=Musical Instruments: Illustrated Encyclopedia |url=https://archive.org/details/musicillustrated00wade |url-access=registration |publisher=Lorenz |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7548-1182-4}}\n* Music Library Association (1974).

Retrieved July 28, 2012.</ref> It prohibits unequal application of voter registration requirements, and [[racial segregation]] in schools, employment, and [[public accommodations]].\n\nInitially, powers given to enforce the act were weak, but these were supplemented during later years. Congress asserted its authority to legislate under several different parts of the [[United States Constitution]], principally its power to regulate [[interstate commerce]] under [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]] (section 8), its duty to guarantee all citizens [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection]] of the laws under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], and its duty to protect voting rights under the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]].\n\nThe legislation had been proposed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] in June 1963, but opposed by filibuster in the Senate. After [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy was assassinated]] on November 22, 1963, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] pushed the bill forward. The final vote in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] was 289\u2013126 with 136\u201335 (80%) in the [[House Republican Conference]] and 153\u201391 (63%) in the [[House Democratic Caucus]] with 16 members voting present or abstaining,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/88-1964/h182|title=H.R. 7152.

PASSAGE.}}</ref> The Act was signed into law by President Johnson at the [[White House]] on July 2, 1964.\n\n==Background==\nIn the 1883 landmark ''[[Civil Rights Cases]]'' the United States Supreme Court had ruled that Congress did not have the power to prohibit discrimination in the private sector, thus stripping the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]] of much of its ability to protect civil rights.<ref>[http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/122/recon/civilrightsact.html \"The Civil Rights Act of March 1, 1875\"], www.gmu.edu.</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the legal justification for voiding the Civil Rights Act of 1875 was part of a larger trend by members of the United States Supreme Court to invalidate most government regulations of the private sector, except when dealing with laws designed to protect traditional public morality.\n\n[[File:President Kennedy addresses nation on Civil Rights, 11 June 1963.jpg|thumb|upright|right|United States President John F. Kennedy addresses the nation about civil rights on June 11, 1963]]\nIn the 1930s, during the New Deal, the majority of the Supreme Court justices gradually shifted their legal theory to allow for greater government regulation of the private sector under the commerce clause, thus paving the way for the Federal government to enact civil rights laws prohibiting both public and private sector discrimination on the basis of the commerce clause in northern vaginia they all started fighting. \n\nThe 1964 bill was first proposed by [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] in his [[Report to the American People on Civil Rights]] on June 11, 1963.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/Archives/JFKPOF-045-005.aspx|title=Radio and television address on civil rights, 11 June 1963|publisher=John F.

Kennedy delivered this speech in the aftermath of the [[Birmingham campaign]] and the growing number of demonstrations and protests throughout the southern United States. Kennedy was moved to action following the elevated racial tensions and wave of black riots in the spring of 1963.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/eyesontheprize/about/pt_104.html|title=''Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years'', episode 4 \"No Easy Walk (1961\u20131963)\"|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nEmulating the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]], Kennedy's civil rights bill included provisions to ban discrimination in public accommodations, and to enable the [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] to join in lawsuits against state governments which operated segregated school systems, among other provisions. However, it did not include a number of provisions deemed essential by civil rights leaders, including protection against police brutality, ending discrimination in private employment, or granting the Justice Department power to initiate desegregation or job discrimination lawsuits.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis64.htm#1964cra64h Civil Rights Act Passes in the House] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===House of Representatives===\n[[File:Civilrightsact1964.jpg|thumb|First page of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]]\n\nOn June 11, 1963, President Kennedy met with Republican leaders to discuss the legislation before his television address to the nation that evening. Two days later, [[Senate Minority Leader]] [[Everett Dirksen]] and [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Mike Mansfield]] both voiced support for the president's bill, except for provisions guaranteeing equal access to places of public accommodations. This led to several Republican Representatives drafting a compromise bill to be considered. On June 19, the president sent his bill to Congress as it was originally written, saying legislative action was \"imperative\".<ref>Loevy, Robert (1997), ''The Civil Rights Act of 1964: The Passage of the Law that Ended Racial Segregation'', State University of New York Press, p. 171. {{ISBN|0-7914-3362-5}}</ref><ref>Golway, Terry and Krantz, Les (2010), ''JFK: Day by Day'', Running Press, p. 284. {{ISBN|978-0-7624-3742-9}}</ref> The president's bill went first to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], where it was referred to the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee]], chaired by [[Emanuel Celler]], a Democrat from [[New York (state)|New York]]. After a series of hearings on the bill, Celler's committee strengthened the act, adding provisions to ban racial discrimination in employment, providing greater protection to black voters, eliminating segregation in all publicly owned facilities (not just schools), and strengthening the anti-segregation clauses regarding public facilities such as lunch counters. They also added authorization for the Attorney General to file lawsuits to protect individuals against the deprivation of any rights secured by the Constitution or U.S. law. In essence, this was the controversial \"Title III\" that had been removed from the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957|1957 Act]] and [[Civil Rights Act of 1960|1960 Act]]. Civil rights organizations pressed hard for this provision because it could be used to protect peaceful protesters and black voters from police brutality and suppression of free speech rights.\n\nKennedy called the congressional leaders to the White House in late October 1963 to line up the necessary votes in the House for passage.<ref>Reeves, Richard (1993), ''President Kennedy: Profile of Power'', pp. 628\u2013631</ref> The bill was reported out of the Judiciary Committee in November 1963 and referred to the [[United States House Committee on Rules|Rules Committee]], whose chairman, [[Howard W. Smith]], a Democrat and staunch segregationist from [[Virginia]], indicated his intention to keep the bill bottled up indefinitely.\n\n===Johnson's appeal to Congress===\nThe [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy]] on November 22, 1963, changed the political situation. Kennedy's successor as president, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], made use of his experience in legislative politics, along with the [[bully pulpit]] he wielded as president, in support of the bill. In his first address to a [[Joint session of the United States Congress|joint session of Congress]] on November 27, 1963, Johnson told the legislators, \"No memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy's memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1963/Transition-to-Johnson/12295509434394-3/|title=Transition to Johnson|work=UPI}}</ref>\n\nJudiciary Committee chairman Celler filed a [[discharge petition|petition to discharge]] the bill from the Rules Committee; it required the support of a majority of House members to move the bill to the floor. Initially Celler had a difficult time acquiring the signatures necessary, with many Representatives who supported the civil rights bill itself remaining cautious about violating normal House procedure with the rare use of a discharge petition. By the time of the 1963 winter recess, 50 signatures were still needed.\n\nAfter the return of Congress from its winter recess, however, it was apparent that public opinion in the North favored the bill and that the petition would acquire the necessary signatures. To avert the humiliation of a successful discharge petition, Chairman Smith relented and allowed the bill to pass through the Rules Committee.\n\n===Lobbying efforts===\nLobbying support for the Civil Rights Act was coordinated by the [[Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights|Leadership Conference on Civil Rights]], a coalition of 70 liberal and labor organizations. The principal lobbyists for the Leadership Conference were civil rights lawyer [[Joseph L. Rauh Jr.]] and [[Clarence Mitchell Jr.]] of the NAACP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://civilrights.org/history-leadership-conference-civil-human-rights-leadership-conference-education-fund/|title=History of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights & The Leadership Conference Education Fund \u2013 The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights|publisher=|access-date=June 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629031854/http://civilrights.org/history-leadership-conference-civil-human-rights-leadership-conference-education-fund/|archive-date=June 29, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Passage in the Senate===\n[[File:MLK and Malcolm X USNWR cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|[[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and [[Malcolm X]] at the [[United States Capitol]] on March 26, 1964.

Normally, the bill would have been referred to the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]], chaired by United States Senator [[James O. Eastland]], [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[Mississippi]]. Given Eastland's firm opposition, it seemed impossible that the bill would reach the Senate floor. [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Mike Mansfield]] took a novel approach to prevent the bill from being relegated to Judiciary Committee limbo. Having initially waived a second reading of the bill, which would have led to it being immediately referred to Judiciary, Mansfield gave the bill a second reading on February 26, 1964, and then proposed, in the absence of precedent for instances when a second reading did not immediately follow the first, that the bill bypass the Judiciary Committee and immediately be sent to the Senate floor for debate.\n\nWhen the bill came before the full Senate for debate on March 30, 1964, the \"Southern Bloc\" of 18 southern Democratic Senators and one Republican Senator led by [[Richard Russell, Jr.|Richard Russell]] (D-GA) launched a [[filibuster]] to prevent its passage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dirksencenter.org/print_basics_histmats_civilrights64_contents.htm#senate |title=A Case History: The 1964 Civil Rights Act |publisher=The Dirksen Congressional Center |accessdate=July 21, 2016}}</ref> Said Russell: \"We will resist to the bitter end any measure or any movement which would have a tendency to bring about [[social equality]] and [[miscegenation|intermingling and amalgamation of the races]] in our (Southern) states.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-civil-rights-quotes-20140629-story.html |title=The Civil Rights Act: What JFK, LBJ, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X had to say |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=February 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lyndon Johnson signing Civil Rights Act, 2 July, 1964.jpg|thumb|United States President [[Lyndon B.

The compromise bill was weaker than the House version in regard to government power to regulate the conduct of private business, but it was not so weak as to cause the House to reconsider the legislation.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis64.htm#1964cra64s Civil Rights Act \u2013 Battle in the Senate] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref>\n\nOn the morning of June 10, 1964, Senator [[Robert Byrd]] (D-W.Va.) completed a filibustering address that he had begun 14 hours and 13 minutes earlier opposing the legislation. Until then, the measure had occupied the Senate for 60 working days, including six Saturdays. A day earlier, Democratic Whip [[Hubert Humphrey]] of Minnesota, the bill's manager, concluded he had the 67 votes required at that time to end the debate and end the filibuster. With six wavering senators providing a four-vote victory margin, the final tally stood at 71 to 29. Never in history had the Senate been able to muster enough votes to cut off a filibuster on a civil rights bill. And only once in the 37 years since 1927 had it agreed to [[cloture]] for any measure.<ref>[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Civil_Rights_Filibuster_Ended.htm Civil Rights Filibuster Ended] \u2013 United States Senate</ref>\n\nOn June 19, the substitute (compromise) bill passed the Senate by a vote of 73\u201327, and quickly passed through the House\u2013Senate [[United States Congress Conference committee|conference committee]], which adopted the Senate version of the bill.

The prohibition on sex discrimination was added to the Civil Rights Act by [[Howard W. Smith]], a powerful Virginia Democrat who chaired the House Rules Committee and who strongly opposed the legislation. Smith's amendment was passed by a teller vote of 168 to 133. Historians debate Smith's motivation, whether it was a [[Wrecking amendment|cynical attempt to defeat the bill]] by someone opposed to civil rights both for blacks and women, or an attempt to support their rights by broadening the bill to include women.<ref name=\"Freeman\">Freeman, Jo. \"How 'Sex' Got Into Title VII: Persistent Opportunism as a Maker of Public Policy,\" ''Law and Inequality: A Journal of Theory and Practice'', Vol. 9, No. 2, March 1991, pp 163\u2013184.

[[Martha Griffiths]],<ref>Olson, Lynne (2001), ''Freedom's Daughters: The Unsung Heroines of the Civil Rights Movement'', p. 360</ref> he was the chief spokesperson for the amendment.<ref name=\"Gold\"/> For twenty years Smith had sponsored the Equal Rights Amendment (with no linkage to racial issues) in the House because he believed in it. He for decades had been close to the [[National Woman's Party]] and its leader [[Alice Paul]], who was also the leader in winning the right to vote for women in 1920, the author of the first Equal Rights Amendment, and a chief supporter of equal rights proposals since then. She and other feminists had worked with Smith since 1945 trying to find a way to include sex as a protected civil rights category. Now was the moment.<ref>Rosenberg, Rosalind (2008), ''Divided Lives: American Women in the Twentieth Century'', p. 187 notes that Smith had been working for years with two Virginia feminists on the issue.</ref> Griffiths argued that the new law would protect black women but not white women, and that was unfair to white women. Furthermore, she argued that the laws \"protecting\" women from unpleasant jobs were actually designed to enable men to monopolize those jobs, and that was unfair to women who were not allowed to try out for those jobs.<ref>Harrison, Cynthia (1989), ''On Account of Sex: The Politics of Women's Issues, 1945\u20131968'', p. 179</ref> The amendment passed with the votes of Republicans and Southern Democrats.

President Johnson realized that supporting this bill would risk losing the South's overwhelming support of the Democratic Party. Both Attorney General [[Robert Kennedy]] and Vice President Johnson had pushed for the introduction of the civil rights legislation. Johnson told Kennedy aide [[Ted Sorensen]] that \"I know the risks are great and we might lose the South, but those sorts of states may be lost anyway.\"<ref>Kotz, Nick (2005), ''Judgment Days: Lyndon Baines Johnson, Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Laws that Changed America'', p. 61.</ref> Senator [[Richard Russell, Jr.]] later warned President Johnson that his strong support for the civil rights bill \"will not only cost you the South, it will cost you the election\".<ref>Branch, Taylor (1998), ''Pillar of Fire'', p. 187.</ref> Johnson, however, went on to win the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 election]] by one of the biggest landslides in American history.

He stated that the reason for his opposition to the 1964 bill was Title II, which in his opinion violated individual liberty and [[states' rights]]. Democrats and Republicans from the Southern states opposed the bill and led an unsuccessful 83-day filibuster, including Senators [[Albert Gore, Sr.]] (D-TN) and [[J. William Fulbright]] (D-AR), as well as Senator [[Robert Byrd]] (D-WV), who personally filibustered for 14 hours straight.\n\n====Continued resistance====\nThere were white business owners who claimed that Congress did not have the constitutional authority to ban segregation in public accommodations. For example, Moreton Rolleston, the owner of a motel in Atlanta, Georgia, said he should not be forced to serve black travelers, saying, \"the fundamental question [...] is whether or not Congress has the power to take away the liberty of an individual to run his business as he sees fit in the selection and choice of his customers\".<ref name=\"jstor.org\">{{Cite journal|title=Travelers, Strangers, and Jim Crow: Law, Public Accommodations, and Civil Rights in America|first=A.K.|last=Sandoval-Strausz|journal=Law and History Review|volume=23|issue=1|pages=53\u201394|date=Spring 2005|doi=10.1017/s0738248000000055|jstor=30042844|doi-access=free}}</ref> Rolleston claimed that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a breach of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] and also violated the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] and [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth]] Amendments by depriving him of \"liberty and property without due process\".<ref name=\"jstor.org\"/> In ''[[Heart of Atlanta Motel v.

This title is not intended to apply to foreign assistance programs.\nSection 601{{spaced ndash}}This section states the general principle that no person in the United States shall be excluded from participation in or otherwise discriminated against on the ground of race, color, or national origin under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\n\nSection 602 directs each Federal agency administering a program of Federal financial assistance by way of grant, contract, or loan to take action pursuant to rule, regulation, or order of general applicability to effectuate the principle of section 601 in a manner consistent with the achievement of the objectives of the statute authorizing the assistance. In seeking the effect compliance with its requirements imposed under this section, an agency is authorized to terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue assistance under a program to any recipient as to whom there has been an express finding pursuant to a hearing of a failure to comply with the requirements under that program, and it may also employ any other means authorized by law. However, each agency is directed first to seek compliance with its requirements by voluntary means.\n\nSection 603 provides that any agency action taken pursuant to section 602 shall be subject to such judicial review as would be available for similar actions by that agency on other grounds. Where the agency action consists of terminating or refusing to grant or to continue financial assistance because of a finding of a failure of the recipient to comply with the agency's requirements imposed under section 602, and the agency action would not otherwise be subject to judicial review under existing law, judicial review shall nevertheless be available to any person aggrieved as provided in section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act ({{usc|5|1009}}). The section also states explicitly that in the latter situation such agency action shall not be deemed committed to unreviewable agency discretion within the meaning of section 10. The purpose of this provision is to obviate the possible argument that although section 603 provides for review in accordance with section 10, section 10 itself has an exception for action \"committed to agency discretion,\" which might otherwise be carried over into section 603. It is not the purpose of this provision of section 603, however, otherwise to alter the scope of judicial review as presently provided in section 10(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n'''Executive Order'''\n\nDecember 11, 2019 [[Executive order]] on Combating Anti-Semitism states: \"While Title VI does not cover discrimination based on religion, individuals who face discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin do not lose protection under Title VI for also being a member of a group that shares common religious practices.

It shall be the policy of the executive branch to enforce Title VI against prohibited forms of discrimination rooted in [[anti-Semitism]] as vigorously as against all other forms of discrimination prohibited by Title VI.\" The order specifies that agencies responsible for Title VI enforcement shall \"consider\" the (non-legally binding) [[Working Definition of Antisemitism|working definition of anti Semitism]] adopted by the [[International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance]] (IHRA) on May 26, 2016 as well as the IHRA list of [[Contemporary Examples of Anti-Semitism]], \"to the extent that any examples might be useful as evidence of discriminatory intent\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-combating-anti-semitism/|title=Executive Order on Combating Anti-Semitism}}</ref>\n\n=== Title VII\u2014equal employment opportunity ===\n{{see also|United States labor law|Employment discrimination law in the United States}}\nTitle VII of the Act, codified as Subchapter VI of Chapter 21 of [[title 42 of the United States Code]], prohibits discrimination by covered employers on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin (see {{usc|42|2000e-2}}<ref name = \"Finduslaw\">{{cite web |url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 |title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 \u2013 CRA \u2013 Title VII \u2013 Equal Employment Opportunities \u2013 42 US Code Chapter 21 |publisher=finduslaw |accessdate=June 6, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021141154/http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 |archive-date=October 21, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>).

Woodmen of the World Life Insurance Company]]'', 791 F.2d 888 (11th Cir. 1986).</ref> The EEO Title VII has also been supplemented with legislation prohibiting pregnancy, age, and disability discrimination (''see'' [[Pregnancy Discrimination#Pregnancy Discrimination Act|Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978]], [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://finduslaw.com/age_discrimination_in_employment_act_of_1967_adea_29_u_s_code_chapter_14 |title=Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 |publisher=Finduslaw.com |accessdate=June 6, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208062408/http://finduslaw.com/age_discrimination_in_employment_act_of_1967_adea_29_u_s_code_chapter_14 |archive-date=December 8, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]]).\n\nIn very narrowly defined situations, an employer is permitted to discriminate on the basis of a protected trait where the trait is a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ) reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise. To prove the [[bona fide occupational qualifications]] defense, an employer must prove three elements: a direct relationship between the protected trait and the ability to perform the duties of the job, the BFOQ relates to the \"essence\" or \"central mission of the employer's business\", and there is no less-restrictive or reasonable alternative (''[[United Automobile Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc.]]'', {{ussc|499|187|1991}} 111 S.Ct. 1196). The Bona Fide Occupational Qualification exception is an extremely narrow exception to the general prohibition of discrimination based on protected traits (''[[Dothard v. Rawlinson]]'', {{ussc|433|321|1977}} 97 S.Ct. 2720). An employer or customer's preference for an individual of a particular religion is not sufficient to establish a Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (''[[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v.

Retrieved July 28, 2012.</ref> It prohibits unequal application of voter registration requirements, and [[racial segregation]] in schools, employment, and [[public accommodations]].\n\nInitially, powers given to enforce the act were weak, but these were supplemented during later years. Congress asserted its authority to legislate under several different parts of the [[United States Constitution]], principally its power to regulate [[interstate commerce]] under [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]] (section 8), its duty to guarantee all citizens [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection]] of the laws under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], and its duty to protect voting rights under the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]].\n\nThe legislation had been proposed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] in June 1963, but opposed by filibuster in the Senate. After [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy was assassinated]] on November 22, 1963, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] pushed the bill forward. The final vote in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] was 289\u2013126 with 136\u201335 (80%) in the [[House Republican Conference]] and 153\u201391 (63%) in the [[House Democratic Caucus]] with 16 members voting present or abstaining,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/88-1964/h182|title=H.R. 7152.

PASSAGE.}}</ref> The Act was signed into law by President Johnson at the [[White House]] on July 2, 1964.\n\n==Background==\nIn the 1883 landmark ''[[Civil Rights Cases]]'' the United States Supreme Court had ruled that Congress did not have the power to prohibit discrimination in the private sector, thus stripping the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]] of much of its ability to protect civil rights.<ref>[http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/122/recon/civilrightsact.html \"The Civil Rights Act of March 1, 1875\"], www.gmu.edu.</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, the legal justification for voiding the Civil Rights Act of 1875 was part of a larger trend by members of the United States Supreme Court to invalidate most government regulations of the private sector, except when dealing with laws designed to protect traditional public morality.\n\n[[File:President Kennedy addresses nation on Civil Rights, 11 June 1963.jpg|thumb|upright|right|United States President John F. Kennedy addresses the nation about civil rights on June 11, 1963]]\nIn the 1930s, during the New Deal, the majority of the Supreme Court justices gradually shifted their legal theory to allow for greater government regulation of the private sector under the commerce clause, thus paving the way for the Federal government to enact civil rights laws prohibiting both public and private sector discrimination on the basis of the commerce clause.\n\nThe 1964 bill was first proposed by [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] in his [[Report to the American People on Civil Rights]] on June 11, 1963.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/Archives/JFKPOF-045-005.aspx|title=Radio and television address on civil rights, 11 June 1963|publisher=John F.

Kennedy delivered this speech in the aftermath of the [[Birmingham campaign]] and the growing number of demonstrations and protests throughout the southern United States. Kennedy was moved to action following the elevated racial tensions and wave of black riots in the spring of 1963.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/eyesontheprize/about/pt_104.html|title=''Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years'', episode 4 \"No Easy Walk (1961\u20131963)\"|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nEmulating the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]], Kennedy's civil rights bill included provisions to ban discrimination in public accommodations, and to enable the [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] to join in lawsuits against state governments which operated segregated school systems, among other provisions. However, it did not include a number of provisions deemed essential by civil rights leaders, including protection against police brutality, ending discrimination in private employment, or granting the Justice Department power to initiate desegregation or job discrimination lawsuits.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis64.htm#1964cra64h Civil Rights Act Passes in the House] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===House of Representatives===\n[[File:Civilrightsact1964.jpg|thumb|First page of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]]\n\nOn June 11, 1963, President Kennedy met with Republican leaders to discuss the legislation before his television address to the nation that evening. Two days later, [[Senate Minority Leader]] [[Everett Dirksen]] and [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Mike Mansfield]] both voiced support for the president's bill, except for provisions guaranteeing equal access to places of public accommodations. This led to several Republican Representatives drafting a compromise bill to be considered. On June 19, the president sent his bill to Congress as it was originally written, saying legislative action was \"imperative\".<ref>Loevy, Robert (1997), ''The Civil Rights Act of 1964: The Passage of the Law that Ended Racial Segregation'', State University of New York Press, p. 171. {{ISBN|0-7914-3362-5}}</ref><ref>Golway, Terry and Krantz, Les (2010), ''JFK: Day by Day'', Running Press, p. 284. {{ISBN|978-0-7624-3742-9}}</ref> The president's bill went first to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], where it was referred to the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee]], chaired by [[Emanuel Celler]], a Democrat from [[New York (state)|New York]]. After a series of hearings on the bill, Celler's committee strengthened the act, adding provisions to ban racial discrimination in employment, providing greater protection to black voters, eliminating segregation in all publicly owned facilities (not just schools), and strengthening the anti-segregation clauses regarding public facilities such as lunch counters. They also added authorization for the Attorney General to file lawsuits to protect individuals against the deprivation of any rights secured by the Constitution or U.S. law. In essence, this was the controversial \"Title III\" that had been removed from the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957|1957 Act]] and [[Civil Rights Act of 1960|1960 Act]]. Civil rights organizations pressed hard for this provision because it could be used to protect peaceful protesters and black voters from police brutality and suppression of free speech rights.\n\nKennedy called the congressional leaders to the White House in late October 1963 to line up the necessary votes in the House for passage.<ref>Reeves, Richard (1993), ''President Kennedy: Profile of Power'', pp. 628\u2013631</ref> The bill was reported out of the Judiciary Committee in November 1963 and referred to the [[United States House Committee on Rules|Rules Committee]], whose chairman, [[Howard W. Smith]], a Democrat and staunch segregationist from [[Virginia]], indicated his intention to keep the bill bottled up indefinitely.\n\n===Johnson's appeal to Congress===\nThe [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy]] on November 22, 1963, changed the political situation. Kennedy's successor as president, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], made use of his experience in legislative politics, along with the [[bully pulpit]] he wielded as president, in support of the bill. In his first address to a [[Joint session of the United States Congress|joint session of Congress]] on November 27, 1963, Johnson told the legislators, \"No memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy's memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1963/Transition-to-Johnson/12295509434394-3/|title=Transition to Johnson|work=UPI}}</ref>\n\nJudiciary Committee chairman Celler filed a [[discharge petition|petition to discharge]] the bill from the Rules Committee; it required the support of a majority of House members to move the bill to the floor. Initially Celler had a difficult time acquiring the signatures necessary, with many Representatives who supported the civil rights bill itself remaining cautious about violating normal House procedure with the rare use of a discharge petition. By the time of the 1963 winter recess, 50 signatures were still needed.\n\nAfter the return of Congress from its winter recess, however, it was apparent that public opinion in the North favored the bill and that the petition would acquire the necessary signatures. To avert the humiliation of a successful discharge petition, Chairman Smith relented and allowed the bill to pass through the Rules Committee.\n\n===Lobbying efforts===\nLobbying support for the Civil Rights Act was coordinated by the [[Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights|Leadership Conference on Civil Rights]], a coalition of 70 liberal and labor organizations. The principal lobbyists for the Leadership Conference were civil rights lawyer [[Joseph L. Rauh Jr.]] and [[Clarence Mitchell Jr.]] of the NAACP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://civilrights.org/history-leadership-conference-civil-human-rights-leadership-conference-education-fund/|title=History of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights & The Leadership Conference Education Fund \u2013 The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights|publisher=|access-date=June 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629031854/http://civilrights.org/history-leadership-conference-civil-human-rights-leadership-conference-education-fund/|archive-date=June 29, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Passage in the Senate===\n[[File:MLK and Malcolm X USNWR cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|[[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and [[Malcolm X]] at the [[United States Capitol]] on March 26, 1964.

Normally, the bill would have been referred to the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]], chaired by United States Senator [[James O. Eastland]], [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[Mississippi]]. Given Eastland's firm opposition, it seemed impossible that the bill would reach the Senate floor. [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Mike Mansfield]] took a novel approach to prevent the bill from being relegated to Judiciary Committee limbo. Having initially waived a second reading of the bill, which would have led to it being immediately referred to Judiciary, Mansfield gave the bill a second reading on February 26, 1964, and then proposed, in the absence of precedent for instances when a second reading did not immediately follow the first, that the bill bypass the Judiciary Committee and immediately be sent to the Senate floor for debate.\n\nWhen the bill came before the full Senate for debate on March 30, 1964, the \"Southern Bloc\" of 18 southern Democratic Senators and one Republican Senator led by [[Richard Russell, Jr.|Richard Russell]] (D-GA) launched a [[filibuster]] to prevent its passage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dirksencenter.org/print_basics_histmats_civilrights64_contents.htm#senate |title=A Case History: The 1964 Civil Rights Act |publisher=The Dirksen Congressional Center |accessdate=July 21, 2016}}</ref> Said Russell: \"We will resist to the bitter end any measure or any movement which would have a tendency to bring about [[social equality]] and [[miscegenation|intermingling and amalgamation of the races]] in our (Southern) states.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-civil-rights-quotes-20140629-story.html |title=The Civil Rights Act: What JFK, LBJ, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X had to say |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=February 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lyndon Johnson signing Civil Rights Act, 2 July, 1964.jpg|thumb|United States President [[Lyndon B.

The compromise bill was weaker than the House version in regard to government power to regulate the conduct of private business, but it was not so weak as to cause the House to reconsider the legislation.<ref>[http://www.crmvet.org/tim/timhis64.htm#1964cra64s Civil Rights Act \u2013 Battle in the Senate] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans</ref>\n\nOn the morning of June 10, 1964, Senator [[Robert Byrd]] (D-W.Va.) completed a filibustering address that he had begun 14 hours and 13 minutes earlier opposing the legislation. Until then, the measure had occupied the Senate for 60 working days, including six Saturdays. A day earlier, Democratic Whip [[Hubert Humphrey]] of Minnesota, the bill's manager, concluded he had the 67 votes required at that time to end the debate and end the filibuster. With six wavering senators providing a four-vote victory margin, the final tally stood at 71 to 29. Never in history had the Senate been able to muster enough votes to cut off a filibuster on a civil rights bill. And only once in the 37 years since 1927 had it agreed to [[cloture]] for any measure.<ref>[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Civil_Rights_Filibuster_Ended.htm Civil Rights Filibuster Ended] \u2013 United States Senate</ref>\n\nOn June 19, the substitute (compromise) bill passed the Senate by a vote of 73\u201327, and quickly passed through the House\u2013Senate [[United States Congress Conference committee|conference committee]], which adopted the Senate version of the bill.

This title is not intended to apply to foreign assistance programs.\nSection 601{{spaced ndash}}This section states the general principle that no person in the United States shall be excluded from participation in or otherwise discriminated against on the ground of race, color, or national origin under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\n\nSection 602 directs each Federal agency administering a program of Federal financial assistance by way of grant, contract, or loan to take action pursuant to rule, regulation, or order of general applicability to effectuate the principle of section 601 in a manner consistent with the achievement of the objectives of the statute authorizing the assistance. In seeking the effect compliance with its requirements imposed under this section, an agency is authorized to terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue assistance under a program to any recipient as to whom there has been an express finding pursuant to a hearing of a failure to comply with the requirements under that program, and it may also employ any other means authorized by law. However, each agency is directed first to seek compliance with its requirements by voluntary means.\n\nSection 603 provides that any agency action taken pursuant to section 602 shall be subject to such judicial review as would be available for similar actions by that agency on other grounds. Where the agency action consists of terminating or refusing to grant or to continue financial assistance because of a finding of a failure of the recipient to comply with the agency's requirements imposed under section 602, and the agency action would not otherwise be subject to judicial review under existing law, judicial review shall nevertheless be available to any person aggrieved as provided in section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act ({{usc|5|1009}}). The section also states explicitly that in the latter situation such agency action shall not be deemed committed to unreviewable agency discretion within the meaning of section 10. The purpose of this provision is to obviate the possible argument that although section 603 provides for review in accordance with section 10, section 10 itself has an exception for action \"committed to agency discretion,\" which might otherwise be carried over into section 603. It is not the purpose of this provision of section 603, however, otherwise to alter the scope of judicial review as presently provided in section 10(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n'''Executive Order'''\n\nDecember 11, 2019 [[Executive order]] on Combating Anti-Semitism states: \"While Title VI does not cover discrimination based on religion, individuals who face discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin do not lose protection under Title VI for also being a member of a group that shares common religious practices.

It shall be the policy of the executive branch to enforce Title VI against prohibited forms of discrimination rooted in [[anti-Semitism]] as vigorously as against all other forms of discrimination prohibited by Title VI.\" The order specifies that agencies responsible for Title VI enforcement shall \"consider\" the (non-legally binding) [[Working Definition of Antisemitism|working definition of anti Semitism]] adopted by the [[International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance]] (IHRA) on May 26, 2016 as well as the IHRA list of [[Contemporary Examples of Anti-Semitism]], \"to the extent that any examples might be useful as evidence of discriminatory intent\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-combating-anti-semitism/|title=Executive Order on Combating Anti-Semitism}}</ref>\n\n=== Title VII\u2014equal employment opportunity ===\n{{see also|United States labor law|Employment discrimination law in the United States}}\nTitle VII of the Act, codified as Subchapter VI of Chapter 21 of [[title 42 of the United States Code]], prohibits discrimination by covered employers on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin (see {{usc|42|2000e-2}}<ref name = \"Finduslaw\">{{cite web |url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 |title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 \u2013 CRA \u2013 Title VII \u2013 Equal Employment Opportunities \u2013 42 US Code Chapter 21 |publisher=finduslaw |accessdate=June 6, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021141154/http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 |archive-date=October 21, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>).

Woodmen of the World Life Insurance Company]]'', 791 F.2d 888 (11th Cir. 1986).</ref> The EEO Title VII has also been supplemented with legislation prohibiting pregnancy, age, and disability discrimination (''see'' [[Pregnancy Discrimination#Pregnancy Discrimination Act|Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978]], [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://finduslaw.com/age_discrimination_in_employment_act_of_1967_adea_29_u_s_code_chapter_14 |title=Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 |publisher=Finduslaw.com |accessdate=June 6, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208062408/http://finduslaw.com/age_discrimination_in_employment_act_of_1967_adea_29_u_s_code_chapter_14 |archive-date=December 8, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]]).\n\nIn very narrowly defined situations, an employer is permitted to discriminate on the basis of a protected trait where the trait is a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ) reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise. To prove the [[bona fide occupational qualifications]] defense, an employer must prove three elements: a direct relationship between the protected trait and the ability to perform the duties of the job, the BFOQ relates to the \"essence\" or \"central mission of the employer's business\", and there is no less-restrictive or reasonable alternative (''[[United Automobile Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc.]]'', {{ussc|499|187|1991}} 111 S.Ct. 1196). The Bona Fide Occupational Qualification exception is an extremely narrow exception to the general prohibition of discrimination based on protected traits (''[[Dothard v. Rawlinson]]'', {{ussc|433|321|1977}} 97 S.Ct. 2720). An employer or customer's preference for an individual of a particular religion is not sufficient to establish a Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (''[[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Kamehameha School\u2014Bishop Estate]]'', 990 F.2d 458 (9th Cir. 1993)).\n\nTitle VII allows for any employer, labor organization, joint labor-management committee, or employment agency to bypass the \"unlawful employment practice\" for any person involved with the [[Communist Party of the United States]] or of any other organization required to register as a Communist-action or Communist-front organization by final order of the Subversive Activities Control Board pursuant to the [[Subversive Activities Control Act]] of 1950.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/civil-rights-act/images/act-06.jpg|title=H.R. 7152--16|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=December 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere are partial and whole exceptions to Title VII for four types of employers:\n\n* Federal government; (Comment: The proscriptions against employment discrimination under Title VII are now applicable to certain federal government offices under [https://web.archive.org/web/20101021141154/http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21#17 42 U.S.C.

The EEOC documented the nature and magnitude of discriminatory employment practices, the first study of this kind done.\n\nIn 1972, Congress passed the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Act]].<ref>[http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/history/35th/milestones/1972.html Milestones In The History of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission: 1972] Accessed July 1, 2014</ref> The Act amended Title VII and gave EEOC authority to initiate its own enforcement litigation.

Historic J\u0113kabpils lies on the left bank, in [[Selonia]] while historic Krustpils ({{lang-de|Kreutzburg}}) lies on the right bank, in [[Latgale]]. The two cities were united during Soviet rule in 1962 under the J\u0113kabpils name, but retain their distinct regional character.\n\nJ\u0113kabpils was also formerly home to former Soviet [[J\u0113kabpils Air Base]].\n\n==History==\n\nA stone cross-castle&nbsp;\u2014 [[Krustpils Castle|Cruczeborch]] ({{lang-de|Kreutzburg}}) \u2013 was built in 1237 by the bishop of [[R\u012bga]]. Archeological excavations on the nearby Asote mound indicate that this place was a busy trading centre for the [[Latgalians]], one of the Latvian tribes, and had been inhabited since 1,000 BC. An adjoining settlement already existed when [[Krustpils Castle]] was first built; it grew up around the castle as the village of Krustpils. The village was often destroyed during local wars, such as Polish-Swedish battles, but was always rebuilt afterward.\n\nDuring the 17th century persecuted [[Old Believers]] from [[Russia]] settled along the Daugava river. In 1670 this settlement, gradually growing around the Sala Inn, became known as J\u0113kabpils ({{lang|de|Jakobstadt}} in German) in honor of the Duke of [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia|Courland]], [[Jacob Kettler]], who granted [[Magdeburg rights]] to the town.\n\nA local legend about the town's origin states that the duke was hunting one day but became lost. At the Daugava River he simultaneously spotted a lynx underneath a fir tree as well as a town at the same time. This image of the lynx underneath a fir tree is the town's [[coat of arms]].\n\nIn the period of the Duchy of Courland the residents of the town were mostly Russian Old believers, [[Poles]] and [[Lithuanians]]. Duke Jacob built a small port in the town to transport goods from a nearby iron foundry. At the end of 17th. century there were an anchor mint, a gun [[foundry]], lime and [[tar kiln]]s and several other factories in Jacobstadt.\nIn 1704, during the [[Great Northern War]], the town was occupied by the Russians. However, after few months a major battle, the ([[Battle of J\u0113kabpils]]), took place near the town. A [[Swedish Empire|Swedish]] army under [[Adam Ludwig Lewenhaupt|Adam Lewenhaupt]] defeated a much larger Russian force and thus stopped [[Russian Empire]] from further invasion in the Duchy.\nAfter the war and an epidemic of plague, the town again prospered. [[Barges]] from [[Belarus]] imported grain, honey, tobacco, spirits, textiles etc. At the same time land transport from [[Jaunjelgava|Friedrichstadt]] amounted to approx. 9000 cart loads a year during second half of the 18th century. Jacobstadt was also part of the postal road from [[Jelgava]] to Friedrichstadt and further to [[Il\u016bkste]].\nIn 1764 the first ferry crossing to Krustpils was opened in the town. During the reign of [[Peter von Biron]] a small community of German-speaking craftsmen developed in the town besides Russians and Poles.  [[Jews]], however, were prohibited from entering the town. In 1795 Jacobstadt, like the whole Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, was incorporated into the Russian Empire.\n\nIn 1826 [[Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve]] made his geodesic measurements near the town.\nIn 1834 the first hospital was opened in the town. During this period a theater and library were also opened and the first streets were cobbled.\nIn 1861 with the opening of the [[Riga\u2013Daugavpils Railway|Riga\u2013Daugavpils railway]] through Krustpils the role of the Daugava and barges as a main means of transport decreased. However the river was still used for [[timber rafting]].\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century there were a bank, an insurance company, a match factory, a [[steam mill]], a [[brewery]], [[typography]] and several other enterprises. During the [[First World War]] heavy battles were fought around the town and some 280 buildings in the town were destroyed or damaged.\n\nIn 1919 J\u0113kabpils became the administrative centre of the newly established Jaunjelgava district. In 1932 a [[sugar refinery]] was built in the town. In 1936 a bridge was built over the Daugava. In this way J\u0113kabpils and Krustpils were united for the first time.\nDuring the [[Second World War]] the bridge was blown up. A new bridge was constructed only in 1962.\n\nJ\u0113kabpils and Krustpils were merged in 1962 under the name J\u0113kabpils.

Historic J\u0113kabpils lies on the left bank, in [[Selonia]] while historic Krustpils ({{lang-de|Kreutzburg}}) lies on the right bank, in [[Latgale]]. The two cities were united during Soviet rule in 1962 under the J\u0113kabpils name, but retain their distinct regional character.\n\nJ\u0113kabpils was also formerly home to former Soviet [[J\u0113kabpils Air Base]].\n\n==History==\n\nA stone cross-castle&nbsp;\u2014 [[Krustpils Castle|Cruczeborch]] ({{lang-de|Kreutzburg}}) \u2013 was built in 1237 by the bishop of [[R\u012bga]]. Archeological excavations on the nearby Asote mound indicate that this place was a busy trading centre for the [[Latgalians]], one of the Latvian tribes, and had been inhabited since 1,000 BC. An adjoining settlement already existed when [[Krustpils Castle]] was first built; it grew up around the castle as the village of Krustpils. The village was often destroyed during local wars, such as Polish-Swedish battles, but was always rebuilt afterward.\n\nDuring the 17th century persecuted [[Old Believers]] from [[Russia]] settled along the Daugava river. In 1670 this settlement, gradually growing around the Sala Inn, became known as J\u0113kabpils ({{lang|de|Jakobstadt}} in German) in honor of the Duke of [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia|Courland]], [[Jacob Kettler]], who granted [[Magdeburg rights]] to the town.\n\nA local legend about the town's origin states that the duke was hunting one day but became lost. At the Daugava River he simultaneously spotted a lynx underneath a fir tree as well as a town at the same time. This image of the lynx underneath a fir tree is the town's [[coat of arms]].\n\nIn the period of the Duchy of Courland the residents of the town were mostly Russian Old believers, [[Poles]] and [[Lithuanians]]. Duke Jacob built a small port in the town to transport goods from a nearby iron foundry. At the end of 17th. century there were an anchor mint, a gun [[foundry]], lime and [[tar kiln]]s and several other factories in Jacobstadt.\nIn 1704, during the [[Great Northern War]], the town was occupied by the Russians. However, after few months a major battle, the ([[Battle of J\u0113kabpils]]), took place near the town. A [[Swedish Empire|Swedish]] army under [[Adam Ludwig Lewenhaupt|Adam Lewenhaupt]] defeated a much larger Russian force and thus stopped [[Russian Empire]] from further invasion in the Duchy.\nAfter the war and an epidemic of plague, the town again prospered. [[Barges]] from [[Belarus]] imported grain, honey, tobacco, spirits, textiles etc. At the same time land transport from [[Jaunjelgava|Friedrichstadt]] amounted to approx. 9000 cart loads a year during second half of the 18th century. Jacobstadt was also part of the postal road from [[Jelgava]] to Friedrichstadt and further to [[Il\u016bkste]].\nIn 1764 the first ferry crossing to Krustpils was opened in the town. During the reign of [[Peter von Biron]] a small community of German-speaking craftsmen developed in the town besides Russians and Poles.  [[Jews]], however, were prohibited from entering the town. In 1795 Jacobstadt, like the whole Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, was incorporated into the Russian Empire.\n\nIn 1826 [[Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve]] made his geodesic measurements near the town.\nIn 1834 the first hospital was opened in the town. During this period a theater and library were also opened and the first streets were cobbled.\nIn 1861 with the opening of the [[Riga\u2013Daugavpils Railway|Riga\u2013Daugavpils railway]] through Krustpils the role of the Daugava and barges as a main means of transport decreased. However the river was still used for [[timber rafting]].\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century there were a bank, an insurance company, a match factory, a [[steam mill]], a [[brewery]], [[typography]] and several other enterprises. During the [[First World War]] heavy battles were fought around the town and some 280 buildings in the town were destroyed or damaged.\n\nIn 1919 J\u0113kabpils became the administrative centre of the newly established Jaunjelgava district. In 1932 a [[sugar refinery]] was built in the town. In 1936 a bridge was built over the Daugava. In this way J\u0113kabpils and Krustpils were united for the first time.\nDuring the [[Second World War]] the bridge was blown up. A new bridge was constructed only in 1962.\n\nJ\u0113kabpils and Krustpils were merged in 1962 under the name J\u0113kabpils. During the [[Latvian SSR|Soviet period]] the united city was home to several big factories. Among them were the sewing enterprise ''Asote'', the [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]] splinter mine ''Dolom\u012bts'', a [[reinforced concrete]] construction factory, a dairy processing plant and several other enterprises.\nAfter the restoration of Latvian independence in 1991 many factories went bankrupt or production was drastically reduced.\n\n==Geography==\n\nThe population of J\u0113kabpils town is 29,100.

It is also used as an [[Performance-enhancing substance|athletic performance enhancer]], [[Nootropic|cognitive enhancer]], [[anorectic|appetite suppressant]], and recreationally as an [[aphrodisiac]] and [[euphoriant]]. It is a [[central nervous system]] (CNS) [[stimulant]] of the [[substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamine class]].{{Citation needed}}\n\nAdderall is generally well tolerated and effective in treating the symptoms of ADHD and narcolepsy. At therapeutic doses, Adderall causes emotional and cognitive effects such as [[euphoria]], change in [[libido|desire for sex]], increased [[wakefulness]], and improved [[Executive functions|cognitive control]]. At these doses, it induces physical effects such as a faster reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. In contrast, much larger doses of Adderall can impair cognitive control, cause [[Rhabdomyolysis|rapid muscle breakdown]], or induce a [[Stimulant psychosis#Amphetamines|psychosis]] (e.g., delusions and paranoia). The side effects of Adderall vary widely among individuals, but most commonly include [[insomnia]], [[dry mouth]], and [[loss of appetite]]. The risk of developing an [[addiction]] is insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed at fairly low daily doses, such as those used for treating ADHD; however, the routine use of Adderall in larger daily doses poses a significant risk of addiction due to the pronounced [[reinforcement|reinforcing effects]] that are present at high doses. Recreational doses of amphetamine are generally much larger than prescribed [[therapeutic dose]]s, and carry a far greater risk of serious adverse effects.{{#tag:ref|<ref name=\"Libido\" /><ref name=\"Adderall IR\" /><ref name=\"Malenka_2009\" /><ref name=\"Ergogenics\" /><ref name=\"FDA\" /><ref name=\"Cochrane\" /><ref name=\"Stimulant Misuse\" /><ref name=\"NHMH_3e-Addiction doses\" /><ref name=\"Addiction risk\" /><ref name=\"EncycOfPsychopharm\">{{Cite book | author = Stolerman IP | editor = Stolerman IP | title = Encyclopedia of Psychopharmacology | year = 2010 | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin, Germany; London, England | isbn = 9783540686989 | page = 78}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Howell|first=L|title=Monoamine transporters and psychostimulant addiction|url=|journal=Biochemical Pharmacology|volume=75|issue=1|pages=196\u2013217|pmid=17825265|year=2008|doi=10.1016/j.bcp.2007.08.003}}</ref>|group=\"sources\"}}\n\nThe two amphetamine enantiomers that compose Adderall (i.e., levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine) alleviate the symptoms of ADHD and narcolepsy by increasing the activity of the [[neurotransmitter]]s [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]] in the [[human brain|brain]], which results in part from their interactions with [[human trace amine-associated receptor&nbsp;1]] (hTAAR1) and [[vesicular monoamine transporter 2]] (VMAT2) in [[neuron]]s.

Although Zn<sup>2+</sup> inhibited uptake, Zn<sup>2+</sup> facilitated [3H]MPP+ release induced by amphetamine, MPP+, or K+-induced depolarization specifically at hDAT but not at the human serotonin and the norepinephrine transporter (hNET).&nbsp;... Surprisingly, this amphetamine-elicited efflux was markedly enhanced, rather than inhibited, by the addition of 10&nbsp;\u03bcM Zn<sup>2+</sup> to the superfusion buffer (Fig. 2 A, open squares). We stress that Zn<sup>2+</sup> per se did not affect basal efflux (Fig. 2 A).&nbsp;... In many brain regions, Zn<sup>2+</sup> is stored in synaptic vesicles and co-released together with glutamate; under basal conditions, the extracellular levels of Zn<sup>2+</sup> are low (\u223c10&nbsp;nM; see Refs. 39, 40). Upon neuronal stimulation, however, Zn<sup>2+</sup> is co-released with the neurotransmitters and, consequently, the free Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentration may transiently reach values that range from 10\u201320&nbsp;\u03bcM (10) up to 300&nbsp;\u03bcM (11).

It is a [[central nervous system]] (CNS) [[stimulant]] of the [[substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamine class]].{{Citation needed}}\n\nAdderall is generally well tolerated and effective in treating the symptoms of ADHD and narcolepsy. At therapeutic doses, Adderall causes emotional and cognitive effects such as [[euphoria]], change in [[libido|desire for sex]], increased [[wakefulness]], and improved [[Executive functions|cognitive control]]. At these doses, it induces physical effects such as a faster reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. In contrast, much larger doses of Adderall can impair cognitive control, cause [[Rhabdomyolysis|rapid muscle breakdown]], or induce a [[Stimulant psychosis#Amphetamines|psychosis]] (e.g., delusions and paranoia). The side effects of Adderall vary widely among individuals, but most commonly include [[insomnia]], [[dry mouth]], and [[loss of appetite]]. The risk of developing an [[addiction]] is insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed at fairly low daily doses, such as those used for treating ADHD; however, the routine use of Adderall in larger daily doses poses a significant risk of addiction due to the pronounced [[reinforcement|reinforcing effects]] that are present at high doses. Recreational doses of amphetamine are generally much larger than prescribed [[therapeutic dose]]s, and carry a far greater risk of serious adverse effects.{{#tag:ref|<ref name=\"Libido\" /><ref name=\"Adderall IR\" /><ref name=\"Malenka_2009\" /><ref name=\"Ergogenics\" /><ref name=\"FDA\" /><ref name=\"Cochrane\" /><ref name=\"Stimulant Misuse\" /><ref name=\"NHMH_3e-Addiction doses\" /><ref name=\"Addiction risk\" /><ref name=\"EncycOfPsychopharm\">{{Cite book | author = Stolerman IP | editor = Stolerman IP | title = Encyclopedia of Psychopharmacology | year = 2010 | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin, Germany; London, England | isbn = 9783540686989 | page = 78}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Howell|first=L|title=Monoamine transporters and psychostimulant addiction|url=|journal=Biochemical Pharmacology|volume=75|issue=1|pages=196\u2013217|pmid=17825265|year=2008|doi=10.1016/j.bcp.2007.08.003}}</ref>|group=\"sources\"}}\n\nThe two amphetamine enantiomers that compose Adderall (i.e., levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine) alleviate the symptoms of ADHD and narcolepsy by increasing the activity of the [[neurotransmitter]]s [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]] in the [[human brain|brain]], which results in part from their interactions with [[human trace amine-associated receptor&nbsp;1]] (hTAAR1) and [[vesicular monoamine transporter 2]] (VMAT2) in [[neuron]]s.
