Image-Line also offers other VST instruments and audio applications. FL Studio has been used by numerous [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[electronic dance music|EDM]] producers.\n\n==History of FL Studio==\nThe first version of FruityLoops (1.0.0) was developed by Didier Dambrin and was partially released in December 1997. Its official launch was in early 1998, when it was still a four-channel<ref name=\"techmag\"/> [[MIDI]] [[drum machine]].<ref name=\"Lex Luger (producer)\"/> Dambrin became Chief Software Architect for the program,<ref name=\"ovguide\">{{cite news|title=FL Studio Video|url=http://www.ovguide.com/fl-studio-9202a8c04000641f80000000001e8c37|publisher=OVGuide|accessdate=2011-05-28|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BVDMAk0f?url=http://www.ovguide.com/fl-studio-9202a8c04000641f80000000001e8c37|archive-date=2012-10-18|url-status=dead\n}}</ref><ref name=\"QUICKSELLING\" /> and it quickly underwent a series of large upgrades that made it into a popular and complex [[digital audio workstation]]. FL Studio has undergone a number of major updates since its inception. On 22 May 2018, a macOS-compatible version of FL Studio was released.\n\n==Software overview==\n\n* '''FL Studio Express''' - This version allows for [[step sequencer]]-only editing and is chiefly suited for 64-step [[loop (music)|loop]] creation.<ref name=\"what\"/> Each pattern can consist of an unlimited number of instruments\u2014either samples, native, or [[Virtual Studio Technology|VST]] instruments. Instruments in the pattern can be routed to the Mixer tool for effects processing, and effects as of version 10.0 include Delay, Delay Bank, EQUOo, Flangus, Love Philter, Vocoder, Parametric EQ & EQ2, Multiband Compressor, Spectroman, Stereo Enhancer, Wave Candy, Wave Shaper, and Soundgoodizer. There is no [[piano roll]], playlist ability, automation, audio recording, or VST/[[ReWire]] client.<ref name=\"editions\">{{cite news|title=Editions|url=http://www.image-line.com/flstudio-feature-comparison/|publisher=[[Image-Line Software]]|website=image-line.com|accessdate=2015-04-26}}</ref>\n* '''Fruity Edition''' \u2013 The Fruity Edition allows users to access the playlist, [[piano roll]], and event automation features, which allow for complex and lengthy arranging and sequencing. There is also VST/ReWire support so that FL Studio can be an instrument in other hosts such as Cubase, Sonic Solutions, [[Logic Studio|Logic]], and other software. As of version 10.0 this edition includes the Simsynth Live [[synthesizer]] instrument, the DrumSynth live percussion synthesizer, the DX10FM synthesizer, and the Wasp/Wasp XT synthesizers. There is no audio recording feature.<ref name=\"editions\"/> In FL Studio 12, this was given (spline-based) automation.\n* '''Producer Edition''' \u2013 The Producer Edition includes all of the features of the Fruity Edition, as well as full recording for internal and external audio and post-production tools. It allows for hand-drawing point and curve based [[spline (mathematics)|splines]] (referred to as \"Automation Clips\"). Plugins include Edison, Slicex (loop slicer and re-arranger), [[Sytrus]], Maximus, Vocodex and Synthmaker. It also allows for waveform viewing of audio clips and the ability to add cue points.<ref name=\"editions\"/>\n* '''Signature Bundle''' \u2013 This edition includes the Producer Edition as well as a series of plugins such as the Fruity Video player, DirectWave Sampler, Harmless, NewTone, Pitcher, Gross Beat and the Hardcore Guitar Effects Suite.<ref name=\"editions\"/>\n* '''All Plugins Bundle''' \u2013 The All Plugins Bundle includes the Signature Bundle along with extra plugins, particularly synthesizers.\n* '''Free Demo''' \u2013 The free demo version includes all of the program's features, all plugins, and allows users to render project audio to [[WAV]], [[MIDI]], [[MP3]], and [[Ogg|OGG]].<ref name=\"what\" /> However, there are several drawbacks to this limitation as projects saved in demo mode will only open fully once FL Studio and plugins have been registered. Also, instrument presets cannot be saved and the audio output of some instruments will cut out momentarily every few minutes until the program and its plugins have been registered.<ref name=\"FL Studio 12.5 BETA 3\" />\n* '''Mobile''' \u2013 On June 21, 2011, Image-Line released [[FL Studio Mobile]] for iOS and in April 2013 for Android. Both support the ability to create multi-track projects on mobile devices including [[iPod Touch]]es, [[iPhone]]s, [[iPad]]s.,<ref name=\"mobile\"/> Android 2.3.3 and higher Smart Phones and Tablets.\n* '''Groove''' \u2013 On September 2, 2013, A new standalone app for Windows 8 was released.

Its official launch was in early 1998, when it was still a four-channel<ref name=\"techmag\"/> [[MIDI]] [[drum machine]].<ref name=\"Lex Luger (producer)\"/> Dambrin became Chief Software Architect for the program,<ref name=\"ovguide\">{{cite news|title=FL Studio Video|url=http://www.ovguide.com/fl-studio-9202a8c04000641f80000000001e8c37|publisher=OVGuide|accessdate=2011-05-28|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BVDMAk0f?url=http://www.ovguide.com/fl-studio-9202a8c04000641f80000000001e8c37|archive-date=2012-10-18|url-status=dead\n}}</ref><ref name=\"QUICKSELLING\" /> and it quickly underwent a series of large upgrades that made it into a popular and complex [[digital audio workstation]]. FL Studio has undergone a number of major updates since its inception. On 22 May 2018, a macOS-compatible version of FL Studio was released.\n\n==Software overview==\n\n* '''FL Studio Express''' - This version allows for [[step sequencer]]-only editing and is chiefly suited for 64-step [[loop (music)|loop]] creation.<ref name=\"what\"/> Each pattern can consist of an unlimited number of instruments\u2014either samples, native, or [[Virtual Studio Technology|VST]] instruments. Instruments in the pattern can be routed to the Mixer tool for effects processing, and effects as of version 10.0 include Delay, Delay Bank, EQUOo, Flangus, Love Philter, Vocoder, Parametric EQ & EQ2, Multiband Compressor, Spectroman, Stereo Enhancer, Wave Candy, Wave Shaper, and Soundgoodizer. There is no [[piano roll]], playlist ability, automation, audio recording, or VST/[[ReWire]] client.<ref name=\"editions\">{{cite news|title=Editions|url=http://www.image-line.com/flstudio-feature-comparison/|publisher=[[Image-Line Software]]|website=image-line.com|accessdate=2015-04-26}}</ref>\n* '''Fruity Edition''' \u2013 The Fruity Edition allows users to access the playlist, [[piano roll]], and event automation features, which allow for complex and lengthy arranging and sequencing. There is also VST/ReWire support so that FL Studio can be an instrument in other hosts such as Cubase, Sonic Solutions, [[Logic Studio|Logic]], and other software. As of version 10.0 this edition includes the Simsynth Live [[synthesizer]] instrument, the DrumSynth live percussion synthesizer, the DX10FM synthesizer, and the Wasp/Wasp XT synthesizers. There is no audio recording feature.<ref name=\"editions\"/> In FL Studio 12, this was given (spline-based) automation.\n* '''Producer Edition''' \u2013 The Producer Edition includes all of the features of the Fruity Edition, as well as full recording for internal and external audio and post-production tools. It allows for hand-drawing point and curve based [[spline (mathematics)|splines]] (referred to as \"Automation Clips\"). Plugins include Edison, Slicex (loop slicer and re-arranger), [[Sytrus]], Maximus, Vocodex and Synthmaker. It also allows for waveform viewing of audio clips and the ability to add cue points.<ref name=\"editions\"/>\n* '''Signature Bundle''' \u2013 This edition includes the Producer Edition as well as a series of plugins such as the Fruity Video player, DirectWave Sampler, Harmless, NewTone, Pitcher, Gross Beat and the Hardcore Guitar Effects Suite.<ref name=\"editions\"/>\n* '''All Plugins Bundle''' \u2013 The All Plugins Bundle includes the Signature Bundle along with extra plugins, particularly synthesizers.\n* '''Free Demo''' \u2013 The free demo version includes all of the program's features, all plugins, and allows users to render project audio to [[WAV]], [[MIDI]], [[MP3]], and [[Ogg|OGG]].<ref name=\"what\" /> However, there are several drawbacks to this limitation as projects saved in demo mode will only open fully once FL Studio and plugins have been registered. Also, instrument presets cannot be saved and the audio output of some instruments will cut out momentarily every few minutes until the program and its plugins have been registered.<ref name=\"FL Studio 12.5 BETA 3\" />\n* '''Mobile''' \u2013 On June 21, 2011, Image-Line released [[FL Studio Mobile]] for iOS and in April 2013 for Android. Both support the ability to create multi-track projects on mobile devices including [[iPod Touch]]es, [[iPhone]]s, [[iPad]]s.,<ref name=\"mobile\"/> Android 2.3.3 and higher Smart Phones and Tablets.\n* '''Groove''' \u2013 On September 2, 2013, A new standalone app for Windows 8 was released.

He first competed as \"Jack Dempsey\" (by his own recollection) in the fall of 1914, in [[Cripple Creek, Colorado]]. His brother, Bernie, who often fought under the pseudonym, \"Jack Dempsey\"\u2014this a common practice of the day, in fighters' admiration of [[middleweight]] boxer and former champion, [[Jack \"Nonpareil\" Dempsey]]\u2014had signed to fight veteran George Copelin. Upon learning Copelin had sparred with then current world heavyweight champion [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], and given Bernie Dempsey was nearing 40 years of age, he strategically decided to back out of the fight.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Toby|title=Kid Blackie|date=1987|publisher=Wayfinder Press|location=Ouray, CO|isbn=0-9608764-7-2|page=79|ref=harv}}</ref> He substituted his brother, still unknown in Eastern Colorado, as \"Jack Dempsey\". The fans at ringside immediately knew this was not the man they'd paid to see.\n\nThe promoter became violently angry and \"sailed into us, barehanded\", threatening to stop the fight.<ref name=\"Round by Round An Autobiography\"/> Copelin himself, who outweighed Dempsey by 20 lbs. (165 to 145) upon seeing Dempsey's small stature in the ring, warned the promoter, \"I might kill that skinny guy.\" The promoter reluctantly permitted the fight to commence, and in his first outing as \"Jack Dempsey\", the future champion downed Copelin six times in the first round and twice in the second.{{sfnp|Dempsey|Considine|Slocum|1960|p=49}} From there, it was a battle of attrition (\"Neither Bernie nor I had taken into consideration the high altitude at Cripple Creek.\"), until a last knockdown of Copelin in the seventh, moved the referee to make the then-unusual move of stopping the fight once Copelin regained his feet. According to Dempsey \"In those days they didn't stop mining-town fights as long as one guy could move.\"{{sfnp|Dempsey|Considine|Slocum|1960|p=50}} This trial by fire carried with it a $100 purse. The promoter, angered at the switch pulled by the brothers, had laid no promised side bets, \"...and even if I did, I wouldn't give you anything.\"{{sfnp|Smith|1987|p=82}}\n\nSuch lessons were hard, but fighting was something Jack Dempsey did well. Following the name change, Dempsey won six bouts in a row by [[knockout]] before losing on a disqualification in four rounds to Jack Downey. During this early part of his career, Dempsey campaigned in Utah, frequently entering fights in towns in the [[Wasatch range|Wasatch Mountain Range]] region.  He followed his loss against Downey with a knockout win and two draws versus Johnny Sudenberg in [[Nevada]]. Three more wins and a draw followed when he met Downey again, this time resulting in a four-round draw.  Following these wins, Dempsey racked up 10 more wins that included matches against Sudenberg and Downey, knocking out Downey in two rounds.  These wins were followed with three no-decision matches, although at this point in the history of boxing, the use of judges to score a fight was often forbidden, so if a fight went the distance, it was called a draw or a no decision, depending on the state or county where the fight was held.\n\nAfter the United States entered [[World War I]] in 1917, Dempsey worked in a shipyard and continued to box. Afterward, he was accused by some boxing fans of being a [[slacker#World wars|slacker]] for not enlisting. This remained a black mark on his reputation until 1920, when evidence produced showed he had attempted to enlist in the [[U.S. Army]], but had been classified 4-F.<ref group=upper-alpha>According to This Draft Card https://www.archives.gov/atlanta/wwi-draft/dempsey.html</ref> After the war, Dempsey spent two years in [[Salt Lake City]], \"bumming around\" as he called it, before returning to the ring.<ref name=\"Boxing 2004\">{{cite book |title=The 12 Greatest Rounds Of Boxing: The Untold Stories |first1=Ferdie |last1=Pacheco |date= 2005 |location=London|publisher=Robson, Trafalgar Square |page=208 |isbn=9781861058058}}</ref>\n\n===World heavyweight champion===\n[[File:Jack Dempsey, Harry Houdini and Benny Leonard2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Dempsey mock punching [[Harry Houdini]] (held back by [[Benny Leonard]])]]\nAmong his opponents as a rising contender were [[Fireman Jim Flynn]], the only boxer ever to beat Dempsey by a knockout when Dempsey lost to him in the first round (although some boxing historians believe the fight was a \"fix\"),<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://coxscorner.tripod.com/dempsey_dive.html |first1=Monte |last1=Cox |first2=Bob |last2=Soderman |title= Did Jack Dempsey Take a Dive? |publisher=Cox's Corner |accessdate= 16 July 2008}}</ref> and [[Gunboat Smith]], formerly a highly ranked contender who had beaten both World Champion [[Jess Willard]] and Hall of Famer [[Sam Langford]].

In the interview, Kearns claimed to have informed Dempsey  he had wagered his share of the purse favoring a Dempsey win with a first-round knockout.  Kearns further stated he had applied [[plaster of Paris]] to the wrappings on the fighter's hands.\n\nBoxing historian [[J. J. Johnston]] said, \"the films show Willard upon entering the ring walking over to Dempsey and examining his hands.\" That, along with an experiment conducted by a boxing magazine designed to re-enact the fight have been noted as proof that Kearns' story was false.<ref name=\"coxscorner.tripod.com\"/>\n\n''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' magazine founder and editor [[Nat Fleischer]] claimed to be present when Dempsey's hands were wrapped, stating, \"Jack Dempsey had no loaded gloves, and no plaster of Paris over his bandages. I watched the proceedings and the only person who had anything to do with the taping of Jack's hands was Deforest. Kearns had nothing to do with it, so his plaster of Paris story is simply not true.\"\n\nDeforest himself said that he regarded the stories of Dempsey's gloves being loaded as libel, calling them \"trash\", and said he did not apply any foreign substance to them, which I can verify since I watched the taping.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fleischer |first1=Nat |authorlink=Nat Fleischer|title=50 Years At Ringside|location=New York |publisher=Fleet Publishing Corp |year=1958 |page=118}}</ref> [[Sports writer]] [[Red Smith (sportswriter)|Red Smith]], in Dempsey's obituary published by ''The New York Times''' was openly dismissive of the claim.<ref name=\"Smith\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0624.html |date=June 1, 1983 |title=OBITUARY: Jack Dempsey, 87, is Dead; Boxing Champion of 1920s |first1=Red |last1=Smith |authorlink1=Red Smith (sportswriter) |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAnother rumor is that Dempsey used a [[knuckleduster]] during the first round.  Some speculated that the object used was a [[rail spike]].<ref name=\"Boxing 2004\"/> In the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' on July 3, 1979, Joe Stone, an ex-referee and boxing writer, asserted that in a film taken of the fight an object on the canvas could be seen after the final knockdown. He further asserted that the object appears to be removed by someone from Dempsey's corner. In the same film, however, Dempsey can be seen at various times during the fight pushing and holding with Willard with the palm of the glove in question and holding on to the ropes with both hands, making it next to impossible that he had any foreign object embedded in his glove, and the 'object' resembles a cigar.<ref name=\"coxscorner.tripod.com\"/>\n\nFurther controversy was fueled by the fact that Dempsey left the ring at the end of the first round, thinking the fight was over. This was seen as a violation of the rules, however Willard's corner did not ask for enforcement in order for the referee to disqualify Dempsey.<ref name=\"Boxing 2004\"/>\n\n===Title defenses===\n[[File:Jack Dempsey v Georges Carpentier cph.3b35134.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Dempsey and Carpentier in the arena before the fight]]\nFollowing his victory, Jack Dempsey traveled around the country, making publicity appearances with circuses, staging exhibitions, and appearing in a low-budget Hollywood movie. Dempsey did not defend his title until September 1920, with a fight against [[Billy Miske]] in [[Benton Harbor]], Michigan. Miske was knocked out in three rounds.\n\nDempsey's second title defense was in December 1920 against Bill Brennan at [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]], [[New York City]].

At this point he was out of the ring for approximately 14 seconds, less than the 20 second rule for out-of-ring knockouts. Nevertheless, he was helped back into the ring by the writers at ringside.

The fight was an elimination bout for a title shot against Tunney. Sharkey was beating Dempsey until the end.

Generating more interest than the Carpentier and Firpo bouts, the fight brought in a record-setting $2 million gate. Reportedly, gangster [[Al Capone]] offered to fix the rematch in his favor, but the referee was changed to prevent that from happening.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Listed|first1=Not|title=1927 Dempsey loses on long count|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/dempsey-loses-on-long-count|website=History.com|publisher=A&E Television Networks, LLC|accessdate=16 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323214646/https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/dempsey-loses-on-long-count|archive-date=March 23, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Millions around the country listened to the match by radio while hundreds of reporters covered the event.

Today's equivalent in U.S currency would be approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1927|r=0}}}}.00.{{inflation-fn|US}}\n\nDempsey was losing the fight on points when in the seventh round he knocked Tunney down with a left hook to the chin then landed several more punches. A new rule instituted at the time of the fight mandated that when a fighter knocked down an opponent, he must immediately go to a neutral corner.  Dempsey, however, refused to immediately move to the neutral corner when instructed by the referee. The referee had to escort Dempsey to the neutral corner, which bought Tunney at least an extra five seconds to recover.  Even though the official timekeeper clocked 14 seconds Tunney was down, Tunney got up at the referee's count of 9.  Dempsey then attempted to finish Tunney off before the end of the round, but failed to do so.  Tunney dropped Dempsey for a count of one in round eight and won the final two rounds of the fight, retaining the title of World Heavyweight Champion on a unanimous decision. Ironically, the neutral corner rule was requested during negotiations by members of the Dempsey camp. Another discrepancy was, when Tunney knocked Dempsey down, the timekeeper started the count immediately, not waiting for Tunney to move to a neutral corner.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.genetunney.org/idol63.html |title=Jack Dempsey \u2013 The Idol of Fistiana |first= Nat |last= Fleischer |chapter= Ch. 63: Drama of the Long Count |accessdate= 30 July 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314164236/http://www.genetunney.org/idol63.html |archivedate= 14 March 2007 |publisher= C.

He first competed as \"Jack Dempsey\" (by his own recollection) in the fall of 1914, in [[Cripple Creek, Colorado]]. His brother, Bernie, who often fought under the pseudonym, \"Jack Dempsey\"\u2014this a common practice of the day, in fighters' admiration of [[middleweight]] boxer and former champion, [[Jack \"Nonpareil\" Dempsey]]\u2014had signed to fight veteran George Copelin. Upon learning Copelin had sparred with then current world heavyweight champion [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], and given Bernie Dempsey was nearing 40 years of age, he strategically decided to back out of the fight.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Toby|title=Kid Blackie|date=1987|publisher=Wayfinder Press|location=Ouray, CO|isbn=0-9608764-7-2|page=79|ref=harv}}</ref> He substituted his brother, still unknown in Eastern Colorado, as \"Jack Dempsey\". The fans at ringside immediately knew this was not the man they'd paid to see.\n\nThe promoter became violently angry and \"sailed into us, barehanded\", threatening to stop the fight.<ref name=\"Round by Round An Autobiography\"/> Copelin himself, who outweighed Dempsey by 20 lbs. (165 to 145) upon seeing Dempsey's small stature in the ring, warned the promoter, \"I might kill that skinny guy.\" The promoter reluctantly permitted the fight to commence, and in his first outing as \"Jack Dempsey\", the future champion downed Copelin six times in the first round and twice in the second.{{sfnp|Dempsey|Considine|Slocum|1960|p=49}} From there, it was a battle of attrition (\"Neither Bernie nor I had taken into consideration the high altitude at Cripple Creek.\"), until a last knockdown of Copelin in the seventh, moved the referee to make the then-unusual move of stopping the fight once Copelin regained his feet. According to Dempsey \"In those days they didn't stop mining-town fights as long as one guy could move.\"{{sfnp|Dempsey|Considine|Slocum|1960|p=50}} This trial by fire carried with it a $100 purse. The promoter, angered at the switch pulled by the brothers, had laid no promised side bets, \"...and even if I did, I wouldn't give you anything.\"{{sfnp|Smith|1987|p=82}}\n\nSuch lessons were hard, but fighting was something Jack Dempsey did well. Following the name change, Dempsey won six bouts in a row by [[knockout]] before losing on a disqualification in four rounds to Jack Downey. During this early part of his career, Dempsey campaigned in Utah, frequently entering fights in towns in the [[Wasatch range|Wasatch Mountain Range]] region.  He followed his loss against Downey with a knockout win and two draws versus Johnny Sudenberg in [[Nevada]]. Three more wins and a draw followed when he met Downey again, this time resulting in a four-round draw.  Following these wins, Dempsey racked up 10 more wins that included matches against Sudenberg and Downey, knocking out Downey in two rounds.  These wins were followed with three no-decision matches, although at this point in the history of boxing, the use of judges to score a fight was often forbidden, so if a fight went the distance, it was called a draw or a no decision, depending on the state or county where the fight was held.\n\nAfter the United States entered [[World War I]] in 1917, Dempsey worked in a shipyard and continued to box. Afterward, he was accused by some boxing fans of being a [[slacker#World wars|slacker]] for not enlisting. This remained a black mark on his reputation until 1920, when evidence produced showed he had attempted to enlist in the [[U.S. Army]], but had been classified 4-F.<ref group=upper-alpha>According to This Draft Card https://www.archives.gov/atlanta/wwi-draft/dempsey.html</ref> After the war, Dempsey spent two years in [[Salt Lake City]], \"bumming around\" as he called it, before returning to the ring.<ref name=\"Boxing 2004\">{{cite book |title=The 12 Greatest Rounds Of Boxing: The Untold Stories |first1=Ferdie |last1=Pacheco |date= 2005 |location=London|publisher=Robson, Trafalgar Square |page=208 |isbn=9781861058058}}</ref>\n\n===World heavyweight champion===\n[[File:Jack Dempsey, Harry Houdini and Benny Leonard2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Dempsey mock punching [[Harry Houdini]] (held back by [[Benny Leonard]])]]\nAmong his opponents as a rising contender were [[Fireman Jim Flynn]], the only boxer ever to beat Dempsey by a knockout when Dempsey lost to him in the first round (although some boxing historians believe the fight was a \"fix\"),<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://coxscorner.tripod.com/dempsey_dive.html |first1=Monte |last1=Cox |first2=Bob |last2=Soderman |title= Did Jack Dempsey Take a Dive? |publisher=Cox's Corner |accessdate= 16 July 2008}}</ref> and [[Gunboat Smith]], formerly a highly ranked contender who had beaten both World Champion [[Jess Willard]] and Hall of Famer [[Sam Langford]].

I sincerely wish Dempsey all the luck possible and hope that he garnishes all the riches that comes with the championship. I have had my fling with the title. I was champion for four years and I assure you that they'll never have to give a benefit for me. I have invested the money I have made\".<ref name=\"coxscorner.tripod.com\"/>  Willard later claimed to have been defeated by \"[[gangsterism]]\".<ref name=\"Boxing 2004\"/>\n\nAfter being fired by Dempsey, manager Jack Kearns gave an account of the fight in the January 20, 1964 issue of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' that has become known as the \"loaded gloves theory\".  In the interview, Kearns claimed to have informed Dempsey  he had wagered his share of the purse favoring a Dempsey win with a first-round knockout.  Kearns further stated he had applied [[plaster of Paris]] to the wrappings on the fighter's hands.\n\nBoxing historian [[J. J. Johnston]] said, \"the films show Willard upon entering the ring walking over to Dempsey and examining his hands.\" That, along with an experiment conducted by a boxing magazine designed to re-enact the fight have been noted as proof that Kearns' story was false.<ref name=\"coxscorner.tripod.com\"/>\n\n''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' magazine founder and editor [[Nat Fleischer]] claimed to be present when Dempsey's hands were wrapped, stating, \"Jack Dempsey had no loaded gloves, and no plaster of Paris over his bandages. I watched the proceedings and the only person who had anything to do with the taping of Jack's hands was Deforest. Kearns had nothing to do with it, so his plaster of Paris story is simply not true.\"\n\nDeforest himself said that he regarded the stories of Dempsey's gloves being loaded as libel, calling them \"trash\", and said he did not apply any foreign substance to them, which I can verify since I watched the taping.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fleischer |first1=Nat |authorlink=Nat Fleischer|title=50 Years At Ringside|location=New York |publisher=Fleet Publishing Corp |year=1958 |page=118}}</ref> [[Sports writer]] [[Red Smith (sportswriter)|Red Smith]], in Dempsey's obituary published by ''The New York Times''' was openly dismissive of the claim.<ref name=\"Smith\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0624.html |date=June 1, 1983 |title=OBITUARY: Jack Dempsey, 87, is Dead; Boxing Champion of 1920s |first1=Red |last1=Smith |authorlink1=Red Smith (sportswriter) |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=June 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAnother rumor is that Dempsey used a [[knuckleduster]] during the first round.  Some speculated that the object used was a [[rail spike]].<ref name=\"Boxing 2004\"/> In the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' on July 3, 1979, Joe Stone, an ex-referee and boxing writer, asserted that in a film taken of the fight an object on the canvas could be seen after the final knockdown. He further asserted that the object appears to be removed by someone from Dempsey's corner. In the same film, however, Dempsey can be seen at various times during the fight pushing and holding with Willard with the palm of the glove in question and holding on to the ropes with both hands, making it next to impossible that he had any foreign object embedded in his glove, and the 'object' resembles a cigar.<ref name=\"coxscorner.tripod.com\"/>\n\nFurther controversy was fueled by the fact that Dempsey left the ring at the end of the first round, thinking the fight was over. This was seen as a violation of the rules, however Willard's corner did not ask for enforcement in order for the referee to disqualify Dempsey.<ref name=\"Boxing 2004\"/>\n\n===Title defenses===\n[[File:Jack Dempsey v Georges Carpentier cph.3b35134.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Dempsey and Carpentier in the arena before the fight]]\nFollowing his victory, Jack Dempsey traveled around the country, making publicity appearances with circuses, staging exhibitions, and appearing in a low-budget Hollywood movie. Dempsey did not defend his title until September 1920, with a fight against [[Billy Miske]] in [[Benton Harbor]], Michigan. Miske was knocked out in three rounds.\n\nDempsey's second title defense was in December 1920 against Bill Brennan at [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]], [[New York City]].

Generating more interest than the Carpentier and Firpo bouts, the fight brought in a record-setting $2 million gate.

A new rule instituted at the time of the fight mandated that when a fighter knocked down an opponent, he must immediately go to a neutral corner.  Dempsey, however, refused to immediately move to the neutral corner when instructed by the referee. The referee had to escort Dempsey to the neutral corner, which bought Tunney at least an extra five seconds to recover.  Even though the official timekeeper clocked 14 seconds Tunney was down, Tunney got up at the referee's count of 9.  Dempsey then attempted to finish Tunney off before the end of the round, but failed to do so.  Tunney dropped Dempsey for a count of one in round eight and won the final two rounds of the fight, retaining the title of World Heavyweight Champion on a unanimous decision. Ironically, the neutral corner rule was requested during negotiations by members of the Dempsey camp. Another discrepancy was, when Tunney knocked Dempsey down, the timekeeper started the count immediately, not waiting for Tunney to move to a neutral corner.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.genetunney.org/idol63.html |title=Jack Dempsey \u2013 The Idol of Fistiana |first= Nat |last= Fleischer |chapter= Ch. 63: Drama of the Long Count |accessdate= 30 July 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314164236/http://www.genetunney.org/idol63.html |archivedate= 14 March 2007 |publisher= C.

He played [[college football]] at [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]], where he was recognized as a unanimous [[All-America]]n. He was drafted by the Rams with the thirteenth pick in the first round of the [[2014 NFL Draft]]. He has been selected to six [[Pro Bowl]]s in his six years into the league, won the [[NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year]] and has twice been named as the [[AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year]], having won it back-to-back in 2017 and 2018.

His father Archie, whose football career ended due to a patellar fracture suffered while playing at [[Norfolk State Spartans football|Norfolk State]], introduced Aaron to strength training when he was 12, seeking to provide more structure in his son's life. Aaron himself would later admit that he was \"lazy as a kid\". By age 14, he and his father woke up at 4:30 am and almost immediately proceeded to work out for nearly two hours in the basement gym that Archie installed in the family home.<ref name=Gonzalez>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/los-angeles-rams/post/_/id/39627/how-rams-dt-aaron-donald-became-the-nfls-most-unstoppable-force |title=How Rams DT Aaron Donald became the NFL's most unstoppable force |first=Alden |last=Gonzalez |website=ESPN.com |date=January 12, 2019 |accessdate=January 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\nDonald attended [[Penn Hills High School]], where he played [[high school football]] for head coach Ron Graham.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://triblive.com/sports/nfl/14566877-74/penn-hills-cherishes-aaron-donald-as-he-prepares-for-super-bowl-debut |title=Penn Hills cherishes Aaron Donald as he prepares for Super Bowl debut |last=Divittorio |first=Michael |website=triblive.com |access-date=February 11, 2019}}</ref> He was selected first team All-State Class AAAA in each of his final two seasons, and compiled 63 tackles, 15 tackles for loss, and 11 sacks as a senior.

When Aaron was named Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2014, he bought his father a used truck; four years later, he bought his father a $40,000 [[Rolex]] watch as a birthday present. A few weeks after he signed his most recent contract extension, he set up both of his parents (who by that time had divorced) with retirement funds sufficient to allow both to permanently stop working, plus brand-new homes of their choosing. His father's new home was in [[Penn Hills Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Penn Hills]], near Aaron's old high school. However, at Aaron's and Archie Jr.'s insistence, Archie Sr. never sold his old home. All three still occasionally return to their old basement gym for offseason workouts.<ref name=Gonzalez/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.therams.com/team/players-roster/aaron-donald/ Los Angeles Rams bio]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131104055501/http://www.pittsburghpanthers.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/aaron_donald_710949.html Pittsburgh Panthers bio]\n\n{{Los Angeles Rams roster navbox}}\n{{Navboxes\n| title = Aaron Donald\u2014awards and honors\n| list1 =\n{{Lombardi Award}}\n{{Bronko Nagurski Trophy}}\n{{Chuck Bednarik Award}}\n{{Outland Trophy}}\n{{2013 NCAA Division I FBS College Football Consensus All-Americans}}\n{{2014 NFL Draft}}\n{{RamsFirstPick}}\n{{St. Louis Rams 2014 draft navbox}}\n{{AP Defensive Rookies of the Year}}\n{{AP Defensive Players of the Year}}\n{{NFL sack leaders}}\n{{NFL Top 100}}\n{{NFL2010s}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Donald, Aaron}}\n[[Category:1991 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Pittsburgh]]\n[[Category:African-American players of American football]]\n[[Category:Players of American football from Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:American football defensive tackles]]\n[[Category:Pittsburgh Panthers football players]]\n[[Category:All-American college football players]]\n[[Category:St. Louis Rams players]]\n[[Category:Los Angeles Rams players]]\n[[Category:National Conference Pro Bowl players]]\n[[Category:Unconferenced Pro Bowl players]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American football defensive tackle}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=May 2019}}\n{{Infobox NFL biography\n| name = Aaron Donald\n| image = Aaron donald 2019 (cropped).jpg\n| alt = \n| caption = Donald in 2019\n| current_team = Los Angeles Rams\n| number = 99\n| position = [[Defensive tackle]]\n| birth_date = {{Birth date and age|1991|5|23}}\n| birth_place = [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]\n| death_date = \n| death_place = \n| height_ft = 6\n| height_in = 1\n| weight_lbs = 280\n| high_school = [[Penn Hills High School|Penn Hills]]<br/>(Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)\n| college = [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]]\n| draftyear = 2014\n| draftround = 1\n| draftpick = 13\n| pastteams = \n* [[History of the St. Louis Rams|St. Louis]] / [[Los Angeles Rams]] ({{NFL Year|2014}}\u2013present)\n| status = Active\n| highlights = \n* 6\u00d7 [[Pro Bowl]] ([[2015 Pro Bowl|2014]]\u2013[[2020 Pro Bowl|2019]])\n* 5\u00d7 First-team [[All-Pro]] ([[2015 All-Pro Team|2015]]\u2013[[2019 All-Pro Team|2019]])\n* 2\u00d7 [[AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award|NFL Defensive Player of the Year]] (2017, 2018)\n* [[NFL sacks leader]] (2018)\n* [[NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year]] (2014)\n* [[PFWA All-Rookie Team]] ([[PFWA All-Rookie Team#2014|2014]])\n* [[NFL 2010s All-Decade Team]]\n* [[ACC Defensive Player of the Year]] (2013)\n* [[Bronko Nagurski Trophy]] (2013)\n* [[Chuck Bednarik Award]] (2013)\n* [[Lombardi Award]] (2013)\n* [[Outland Trophy]] (2013)\n* [[Unanimous All-American]] ([[2013 College Football All-America Team|2013]])\n* All-[[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] team (2013)\n* All-[[Big East Conference (1979-2013)|Big East]] team (2012)\n* Second-team All-[[Big East Conference (1979-2013)|Big East]] (2011)\n| statseason = 2019\n| statweek   = 17\n| statlabel1 = [[Tackle (football move)|Tackles]]\n| statvalue1 = 312\n| statlabel2 = [[Quarterback sack|Sacks]]\n| statvalue2 = 72\n| statlabel3 = [[Fumble|Forced fumbles]]\n| statvalue3 = 15\n| statlabel4 = [[Fumble|Fumble recoveries]]\n| statvalue4 = 5\n| statlabel5 = [[Pass deflected|Pass deflections]]\n| statvalue5 = 11\n| nflnew = aarondonald/2543485\n| pfr = DonaAa00\n}}\n\n'''Aaron Charles Donald''' (born May 23, 1991) is an [[American football]] [[defensive tackle]] for the [[Los Angeles Rams]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). He played [[college football]] at [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]], where he was recognized as a unanimous [[All-America]]n. He was drafted by the Rams with the thirteenth pick in the first round of the [[2014 NFL Draft]]. He has been selected to six [[Pro Bowl]]s in his six years into the league, won the [[NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year]] and has twice been named as the [[AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year]], having won it back-to-back in 2017 and 2018.

His father Archie, whose football career ended due to a patellar fracture suffered while playing at [[Norfolk State Spartans football|Norfolk State]], introduced Aaron to strength training when he was 12, seeking to provide more structure in his son's life. Aaron himself would later admit that he was \"lazy as a kid\". By age 14, he and his father woke up at 4:30 am and almost immediately proceeded to work out for nearly two hours in the basement gym that Archie installed in the family home.<ref name=Gonzalez>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/los-angeles-rams/post/_/id/39627/how-rams-dt-aaron-donald-became-the-nfls-most-unstoppable-force |title=How Rams DT Aaron Donald became the NFL's most unstoppable force |first=Alden |last=Gonzalez |website=ESPN.com |date=January 12, 2019 |accessdate=January 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\nDonald attended [[Penn Hills High School]], where he played [[high school football]] for head coach Ron Graham.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://triblive.com/sports/nfl/14566877-74/penn-hills-cherishes-aaron-donald-as-he-prepares-for-super-bowl-debut |title=Penn Hills cherishes Aaron Donald as he prepares for Super Bowl debut |last=Divittorio |first=Michael |website=triblive.com |access-date=February 11, 2019}}</ref> He was selected first team All-State Class AAAA in each of his final two seasons, and compiled 63 tackles, 15 tackles for loss, and 11 sacks as a senior.

When Aaron was named Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2014, he bought his father a used truck; four years later, he bought his father a $40,000 [[Rolex]] watch as a birthday present. A few weeks after he signed his most recent contract extension, he set up both of his parents (who by that time had divorced) with retirement funds sufficient to allow both to permanently stop working, plus brand-new homes of their choosing. His father's new home was in [[Penn Hills Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Penn Hills]], near Aaron's old high school. However, at Aaron's and Archie Jr.'s insistence, Archie Sr. never sold his old home.

In the picture above, the wind blowing North in the northern hemisphere creates a surface stress and a resulting [[Ekman spiral]] is found below it in the [[water column]].]]\n\n'''Ekman transport''' is part of Ekman motion theory, first investigated in 1902 by [[Vagn Walfrid Ekman]]. Winds are the main source of energy for ocean circulation, and Ekman Transport is a component of wind-driven ocean current.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\">{{cite book |last1=Sarmiento |first1=Jorge L. |last2=Gruber |first2=Nicolas |title=Ocean biogeochemical dynamics |date=2006 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-01707-5}}</ref> Ekman transport occurs when ocean surface waters are influenced by the friction force acting on them via the wind.

This is because they lead to upwelling (Ekman suction) and downwelling (Ekman pumping) in order to obey mass conservation laws. Mass conservation, in reference to Ekman transfer, requires that any water displaced within an area must be replenished. This can be done by either Ekman suction or Ekman pumping depending on wind patterns.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\"/>\n\n==Theory==\nEkman theory explains the theoretical state of circulation if water currents were driven only by the transfer of momentum from the wind. In the physical world, this is difficult to observe because of the influences of many simultaneous [[Ocean current|current]] driving forces (for example, [[pressure]] and [[density gradient]]s). Though the following theory technically applies to the idealized situation involving only wind forces, Ekman motion describes the wind-driven portion of circulation seen in the surface layer.<ref>Colling p 44</ref><ref>Sverdrup p 228</ref>\n\nSurface currents flow at a 45\u00b0 angle to the wind due to a balance between the Coriolis force and the [[Drag (physics)|drags]] generated by the wind and the water.<ref>Mann & Lazier p 169</ref> If the ocean is divided vertically into thin layers, the magnitude of the velocity (the speed) decreases from a maximum at the surface until it dissipates. The direction also shifts slightly across each subsequent layer (right in the northern hemisphere and left in the southern hemisphere). This is called the [[Ekman Spiral|Ekman spiral]].<ref>Knauss p 124.</ref> The layer of water from the surface to the point of dissipation of this spiral is known as the [[Ekman layer]]. If all flow over the Ekman layer is integrated, the net transportation is at 90\u00b0 to the right (left) of the surface wind in the northern (southern) hemisphere.<ref name=Colling42-44/>\n\n==Mechanisms==\nThere are three major wind patterns that lead to Ekman suction or pumping. The first are wind patterns that are parallel to the coastline.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\"/> Due to the [[Coriolis effect]], surface water moves at a 90\u00b0 angle to the wind current. If the wind moves in a direction causing the water to be pulled away from the coast then Ekman suction will occur.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\"/> On the other hand, if the wind is moving in such a way that surface waters move towards the shoreline then Ekman pumping will take place.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\"/>\n\nThe second mechanism of wind currents resulting in Ekman transfer is the trade winds both north and south of the equator pulling surface waters towards the poles.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\"/> There is a great deal of Ekman suction at the equator because water is being pulled northward north of the equator and southward south of the equator. This leads to a divergence in the water, resulting in Ekman suction, and therefore, upwelling.<ref name=\"Chemical oceanography and the marin\">{{cite book |last1=Emerson |first1=Steven R. |last2=Hedges |first2=John I. |title=Chemical oceanography and the marine carbon cycle |date=2017 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York, United States of America |isbn=978-0-521-83313-4}}</ref>\n\nThe third wind pattern influencing Ekman transfer is large-scale wind patterns in the open ocean.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\"/> Open ocean wind circulation can lead to gyre-like structures of piled up sea surface water resulting in horizontal gradients of sea surface height.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\"/> This pile up of water causes the water to have a downward flow and suction, due to gravity and the concept of mass balance. Ekman pumping in the central ocean is a consequence of this convergence of water.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\"/>\n\n==Ekman suction==\nEkman Suction is the component of Ekman transport that results in areas of upwelling due to the divergence of water.<ref name=\"Chemical oceanography and the marin\"/> Returning to the concept of mass conservation, any water displaced by Ekman transport must be replenished. As the water diverges it creates space and acts as a suction in order to fill in the space by pulling up, or upwelling, deep sea water to the euphotic zone.<ref name=\"Chemical oceanography and the marin\"/>\n\nEkman suction has major consequences for the biogeochemical processes in the area because it leads to upwelling. Upwelling carries nutrient rich, and cold deep-sea water to the euphotic zone, promoting phytoplankton blooms and kickstarting an extremely high-productive environment.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Charles B. |last2=Wheeler |first2=Patricia A. |title=Biological Oceanography |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-1-4443-3302-2 |edition=Second|date=2012-05-21 }}</ref> Areas of upwelling leads to the promotion of fisheries, in fact nearly half of the world's fish catch comes from areas of upwelling.<ref name=\"oceanmotion.org\">{{cite web |last1=Lindstrom |first1=Eric J. |title=Ocean Motion : Definition : Wind Driven Surface Currents - Upwelling and Downwelling |url=http://oceanmotion.org/html/background/upwelling-and-downwelling.htm |website=oceanmotion.org}}</ref>\n\nEkman suction occurs both along coastlines and in the open ocean, but also occurs along the equator. Along the Pacific coastline of California, Central America, and Peru, as well as along the Atlantic coastline of Africa there are areas of upwelling due to Ekman suction.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\"/> Due to the Coriolis effect the surface water moves 90\u00b0 to the left (in the South Hemisphere) of the wind current, therefore causing the water to diverge from the coast boundary, leading to Ekman suction. Additionally, there are areas of upwelling as a consequence of Ekman suction where the Polar Easterlies winds meet the Westerlies in the subpolar regions north of the subtropics, as well as were the Northeast Trade Winds meet the Southeast Trade Winds along the Equator.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\"/> Similarly, due to the Coriolis effect the surface water moves 90\u00b0 to the left (in the South Hemisphere) of the wind currents the surface water diverges along these boundaries, resulting in upwelling in order to conserve mass.\n\n==Ekman pumping==\nEkman Pumping is the component of Ekman transport that results in areas of downwelling due to the convergence of water.<ref name=\"Chemical oceanography and the marin\"/> As discussed above, the concept of mass conservation requires that a pile up of surface water must be pushed downward. This pile up of warm, nutrient-poor surface water gets pumped vertically down the water column, resulting in areas of downwelling.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\"/>\n\nEkman pumping has dramatic impacts on the surrounding environments. Downwelling, due to Ekman pumping, leads to nutrient poor waters, therefore reducing the biological productivity of the area.<ref name=\"oceanmotion.org\"/> Additionally, it transports heat and dissolved oxygen vertically down the water column as warm oxygen rich surface water is being pumped towards the deep ocean water.<ref name=\"oceanmotion.org\"/>\n\nEkman pumping can be found along the coasts as well as in the open ocean. Along the Pacific Coast in the Southern Hemisphere northerly winds move parallel to the coastline.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\"/> Due to the Coriolis effect the surface water gets pulled 90\u00b0 to the right of the wind current, therefore causing the water to converge along the coast boundary, leading to Ekman pumping. In the open ocean Ekman pumping occurs with gyres.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\"/> Specifically, in the subtropics, between 20\u00b0N and 50\u00b0N, there is Ekman pumping as the tradewinds shift to westerlies causing a pile up of surface water.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\"/>\n\n==Mathematical derivation==\nSome assumptions of the fluid dynamics involved in the process must be made in order to simplify the process to a point where it is solvable.

This is because they lead to upwelling (Ekman suction) and downwelling (Ekman pumping) in order to obey mass conservation laws. Mass conservation, in reference to Ekman transfer, requires that any water displaced within an area must be replenished. This can be done by either Ekman suction or Ekman pumping depending on wind patterns.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\"/>\n\n==Theory==\nEkman theory explains the theoretical state of circulation if water currents were driven only by the transfer of momentum from the wind. In the physical world, this is difficult to observe because of the influences of many simultaneous [[Ocean current|current]] driving forces (for example, [[pressure]] and [[density gradient]]s). Though the following theory technically applies to the idealized situation involving only wind forces, Ekman motion describes the wind-driven portion of circulation seen in the surface layer.<ref>Colling p 44</ref><ref>Sverdrup p 228</ref>\n\nSurface currents flow at a 45\u00b0 angle to the wind due to a balance between the Coriolis force and the [[Drag (physics)|drags]] generated by the wind and the water.<ref>Mann & Lazier p 169</ref> If the ocean is divided vertically into thin layers, the magnitude of the velocity (the speed) decreases from a maximum at the surface until it dissipates. The direction also shifts slightly across each subsequent layer (right in the northern hemisphere and left in the southern hemisphere). This is called the [[Ekman Spiral|Ekman spiral]].<ref>Knauss p 124.</ref> The layer of water from the surface to the point of dissipation of this spiral is known as the [[Ekman layer]]. If all flow over the Ekman layer is integrated, the net transportation is at 90\u00b0 to the right (left) of the surface wind in the northern (southern) hemisphere.<ref name=Colling42-44/>\n\n==Mechanisms==\nThere are three major wind patterns that lead to Ekman suction or pumping. The first are wind patterns that are parallel to the coastline.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\"/> Due to the [[Coriolis effect]], surface water moves at a 90\u00b0 angle to the wind current. If the wind moves in a direction causing the water to be pulled away from the coast then Ekman suction will occur.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\"/> On the other hand, if the wind is moving in such a way that surface waters move towards the shoreline then Ekman pumping will take place.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\"/>\n\nThe second mechanism of wind currents resulting in Ekman transfer is the trade winds both north and south of the equator pulling surface waters towards the poles.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\"/> There is a great deal of Ekman suction at the equator because water is being pulled northward north of the equator and southward south of the equator. This leads to a divergence in the water, resulting in Ekman suction, and therefore, upwelling.<ref name=\"Chemical oceanography and the marin\">{{cite book |last1=Emerson |first1=Steven R. |last2=Hedges |first2=John I. |title=Chemical oceanography and the marine carbon cycle |date=2017 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York, United States of America |isbn=978-0-521-83313-4}}</ref>\n\nThe third wind pattern influencing Ekman transfer is large-scale wind patterns in the open ocean.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\"/> Open ocean wind circulation can lead to gyre-like structures of piled up sea surface water resulting in horizontal gradients of sea surface height.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\"/> This pile up of water causes the water to have a downward flow and suction, due to gravity and the concept of mass balance. Ekman pumping in the central ocean is a consequence of this convergence of water.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\"/>\n\n==Ekman suction==\nEkman Suction is the component of Ekman transport that results in areas of upwelling due to the divergence of water.<ref name=\"Chemical oceanography and the marin\"/> Returning to the concept of mass conservation, any water displaced by Ekman transport must be replenished. As the water diverges it creates space and acts as a suction in order to fill in the space by pulling up, or upwelling, deep sea water to the euphotic zone.<ref name=\"Chemical oceanography and the marin\"/>\n\nEkman suction has major consequences for the biogeochemical processes in the area because it leads to upwelling. Upwelling carries nutrient rich, and cold deep-sea water to the euphotic zone, promoting phytoplankton blooms and kickstarting an extremely high-productive environment.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Charles B. |last2=Wheeler |first2=Patricia A. |title=Biological Oceanography |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-1-4443-3302-2 |edition=Second|date=2012-05-21 }}</ref> Areas of upwelling leads to the promotion of fisheries, in fact nearly half of the world's fish catch comes from areas of upwelling.<ref name=\"oceanmotion.org\">{{cite web |last1=Lindstrom |first1=Eric J. |title=Ocean Motion : Definition : Wind Driven Surface Currents - Upwelling and Downwelling |url=http://oceanmotion.org/html/background/upwelling-and-downwelling.htm |website=oceanmotion.org}}</ref>\n\nEkman suction occurs both along coastlines and in the open ocean, but also occurs along the equator. Along the Pacific coastline of California, Central America, and Peru, as well as along the Atlantic coastline of Africa there are areas of upwelling due to Ekman suction.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\"/> Due to the Coriolis effect the surface water moves 90\u00b0 to the left of the wind current, therefore causing the water to diverge from the coast boundary, leading to Ekman suction. Additionally, there are areas of upwelling as a consequence of Ekman suction where the Polar Easterlies winds meet the Westerlies in the subpolar regions north of the subtropics, as well as were the Northeast Trade Winds meet the Southeast Trade Winds along the Equator.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\"/> Similarly, due to the Coriolis effect the surface water moves 90\u00b0 to the left of the wind currents the surface water diverges along these boundaries, resulting in upwelling in order to conserve mass.\n\n==Ekman pumping==\nEkman Pumping is the component of Ekman transport that results in areas of downwelling due to the convergence of water.<ref name=\"Chemical oceanography and the marin\"/> As discussed above, the concept of mass conservation requires that a pile up of surface water must be pushed downward. This pile up of warm, nutrient-poor surface water gets pumped vertically down the water column, resulting in areas of downwelling.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\"/>\n\nEkman pumping has dramatic impacts on the surrounding environments. Downwelling, due to Ekman pumping, leads to nutrient poor waters, therefore reducing the biological productivity of the area.<ref name=\"oceanmotion.org\"/> Additionally, it transports heat and dissolved oxygen vertically down the water column as warm oxygen rich surface water is being pumped towards the deep ocean water.<ref name=\"oceanmotion.org\"/>\n\nEkman pumping can be found along the coasts as well as in the open ocean. Along the Pacific Coast in the Southern Hemisphere northerly winds move parallel to the coastline.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\"/> Due to the Coriolis effect the surface water gets pulled 90\u00b0 to the right of the wind current, therefore causing the water to converge along the coast boundary, leading to Ekman pumping. In the open ocean Ekman pumping occurs with gyres.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\"/> Specifically, in the subtropics, between 20\u00b0N and 50\u00b0N, there is Ekman pumping as the tradewinds shift to westerlies causing a pile up of surface water.<ref name=\"Ocean biogeochemical dynamics\"/>\n\n==Mathematical derivation==\nSome assumptions of the fluid dynamics involved in the process must be made in order to simplify the process to a point where it is solvable.

In July 2016, it was announced that Peter would be returning as a regular character and he returned on 17 October 2016.\n\nPeter's storylines have included a number of affairs, alcoholism and a custody battle involving his son [[Simon Barlow]] (Alex Bain). Peter became involved in a bigamy storyline when he married Rovers barmaid [[Shelley Unwin]] ([[Sally Lindsay]]) and florist [[Lucy Richards]] ([[Katy Carmichael]]). Having been discovered, Peter was left alone and fled Weatherfield. He returned briefly in 2007 when his stepsister [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]) was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of [[Charlie Stubbs (Coronation Street)|Charlie Stubbs]] ([[Bill Ward (actor)|Bill Ward]]). He returned for good in 2008 with five-year-old Simon, whom he had by Lucy; who had since died from breast cancer. Peter began a relationship with [[Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Danson]]) and they married during the [[Coronation Street Live (2010)|50th anniversary episode]]; however, they separated after Peter's affair with [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]) was discovered. Peter later went on to marry Carla, and then had an affair with much younger [[Tina McIntyre]] ([[Michelle Keegan]]). Peter was framed for Tina's murder by [[Rob Donovan]] ([[Marc Baylis]]) and upon his release from prison, his marriage to Carla broke down and he left. When he returned in 2016, it was revealed he had begun a relationship with [[Toyah Battersby]] ([[Georgia Taylor]]), which they agreed to keep secret from a pregnant Leanne, in order to not affect her pregnancy. Simon and Leanne's sister [[Eva Price]] ([[Catherine Tyldesley]]) soon discovered this, followed by Leanne, and he and Toyah subsequently purchased [[The Rovers Return]], from [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street)|Steve McDonald]] ([[Simon Gregson]]). He and Toyah soon begin family planning, with them beginning [[surrogacy]]; as Toyah had multiple failed IVF treatments in the past and was unable to conceive naturally. Their baby son was [[stillborn]], and Toyah and Eva secretly agreed to pretend that Eva and Aidan's daughter, [[Susie Price|Susie]], is Peter's daughter, as Eva does not want to be a mother, but Toyah tells Peter after Eva has a change of heart, resulting in their split. Afterwards, Peter buys 50% of the Underworld factory from [[Alya Nazir]] ([[Sair Khan]]), partnering with Carla, and supports Simon after he is the victim of bullying by former friend [[List of Coronation Street characters (2018)#Tyler Jefferies|Tyler Jefferies]] (Will Barnett), which results in Peter being shot with a [[paint gun]]. Peter also sleeps with [[Abi Franklin]] ([[Sally Carman]]) and supports Carla after the factory collapses after it is sabotaged by builder [[Gary Windass]] ([[Mikey North]]), which sees Carla blamed for the death of [[Rana Habeeb]] ([[Bhavna Limbachia]]). Carla has a mental breakdown before the couple reunite into another relationship.\n\n==Storylines==\n\n===1965\u20131986===\nPeter and his twin sister [[Susan Barlow|Susan]] were born to [[Ken Barlow|Ken]] ([[William Roache]]) and [[Valerie Barlow]] ([[Anne Reid]]). Ken and Val planned to emigrate to [[Jamaica]] with the twins as Ken had been offered a teaching post there. While Val was getting ready for a leaving party in the [[Rovers Return Inn]] for them, she was electrocuted and killed by a faulty [[hairdryer]]. Ken then sent the twins to [[Glasgow]] to live with Val's parents; he saw them only sporadically as they grew up.\n \nPeter did not attend Ken's wedding to [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre Langton]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]) in 1981 as he had joined the navy after leaving school, but he visited when Susan ([[Wendy Jane Walker]]) married [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]). As Ken refused to go to the wedding due to the feud he and Mike had, Peter made an emotional appeal, saying that he and Susan had barely seen their father and that he always assumed Ken would step up if his children needed him and he was able to help. Ken reconsiders and attends the wedding.\n\n===2000\u20132003===\nPeter returned in December 2000 after leaving the Navy and the collapse of his marriage to Jessica Midgeley, who left him for another man. He accidentally let it be known that Susan had a teenage son, [[Adam Barlow]] ([[Iain De Caestecker]]), fathered by Mike. Deirdre told [[Dev Alahan]] ([[Jimmi Harkishin]]), who then told Mike. Susan (now played by [[Joanna Foster]]), who had been visiting at the time, attempted to flee when Mike threatened legal action and she was killed in a car crash. Peter was devastated, blaming himself and Deirdre for Susan's death. He started dating barmaid, [[Shelley Unwin]] ([[Sally Lindsay]]), but when Peter's old Navy friend, [[Ciaran McCarthy]] ([[Keith Duffy]]), visited, he made a pass at Shelley, causing a temporary rift between the couple. Peter later met florist, [[Lucy Richards]] ([[Katy Carmichael]]), while buying flowers for Shelley. He was attracted to her and a brief affair occurred but Peter chose to marry Shelley.\nLucy, unknown to Peter, hired his stepsister, [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]), to work for her, covering her [[maternity leave]]. Tracy informed Peter that her employer was pregnant and Peter realised that he was the child's father. He offered to marry Lucy while still engaged to Shelley, promising her that his other relationship was over. Lucy gave birth to a son, [[Simon Barlow|Simon]] (Oscar and Jake Hartley). When she discovered that Peter was still seeing Shelley, she threw him out and banned him from seeing Simon. Peter was torn between his son and Shelley, but eventually married her, thus committing [[bigamy]]. When both women discover Peter's secret, Shelley threw him out and the two women temporarily took over his betting shop. Lucy told Peter that she and Simon would emigrate to [[Australia]] alone, threatening to expose his crime if he contested her decision. Peter resigned himself to the situation and moved back to [[Portsmouth]].\n\n===2007\u2013===\nPeter returns to [[Weatherfield]] after Ken contacts him in regards to Tracy's stormy relationship with her boyfriend, [[Charlie Stubbs (Coronation Street)|Charlie Stubbs]] ([[Bill Ward (actor)|Bill Ward]]). Tracy later kills Charlie, supposedly in self-defence, and Peter decides to stay when she is charged with murder. Peter later has a brief fling with [[Maria Connor|Maria Sutherland]] ([[Samia Ghadie]]), however, once Tracy is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, Peter returns to Portsmouth, taking Adam with him, and ending his relationship with Maria.\n\nLucy dies from [[ovarian cancer]] and Peter is given custody of five-year-old Simon (now played by [[Alex Bain (actor)|Alex Bain]]). Due to his business in Portsmouth failing, Peter brings Simon back to Weatherfield, seeking Ken and Deirdre's help but Ken suspects, correctly, that Peter plans to leave Simon with him. Peter changes his mind when he learns that Lucy had left her estate to him, providing that he used it for Simon's benefit. He buys the local bookmakers and renames it \"Barlow's Bookies\". Peter begins a relationship with [[Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Danson]]). Peter and Leanne decide to open a bar, but Ken is hesitant about the venture because of Peter's alcoholism. On the opening night of the bar, Peter falls off the wagon and gets drunk and is forced to go to [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]]. Peter and Leanne get engaged, but Peter feels threatened by the return of Leanne's ex-husband, [[Nick Tilsley]] ([[Ben Price]]), until Leanne convinces him that Nick is just a friend. Nick decides to open the bar and offers Leanne a job as bar manager. Feeling guilty for ruining her previous venture, Peter persuades her to take the job and starts mentoring Leanne's friend, [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]), when he realises that she also has a drink problem. Carla begins to lean on Peter emotionally for support and she later attempts to seduce him. Peter then tells Carla that he cannot see her any more.\n\nPeter celebrates his stag do at his and Leanne's former bar, The Joinery, owned by Nick in December 2010. The premises is destroyed by an explosion caused by a problem with the gas supply. Following the explosion, a tram derails and crashes into the street. The bar is destroyed and Peter is trapped inside. Peter is rushed to [[hospital]] with crush injuries to his legs and trauma to his lower back and chest, and suffers a [[cardiac tamponade]]. Aware that he is unlikely to survive, he marries Leanne in his hospital bed and goes into [[cardiac arrest]] moments after the ceremony has concluded. Fortunately, he survives and leaves hospital in a wheelchair.\n\nPeter supports Carla again after her mother dies, and this makes Leanne, who knows about Carla's feelings for Peter, feel insecure and causes several arguments between the two women. Carla is subsequently raped by crooked businessman [[Frank Foster (Coronation Street)|Frank Foster]] ([[Andrew Lancel]]) and Peter lends much emotional support, to the annoyance of Leanne. Peter begins drinking again and goes to Carla's flat, telling her that she was the woman he loved and that he would leave Leanne for her. He and Carla sleep together that night and an affair begins. Leanne finds out about the affair but offers to forgive him and try to work on fixing their marriage but Peter tells her that he loves Carla. Leanne leaves in a taxi with a tearful Simon running after the car, begging her to stay. Simon then starts misbehaving with Peter as he blames him and Carla for Leanne's departure. When Leanne returns, she fights Peter for custody of Simon and Leanne eventually wins a residency order, at the same time reconciling with Nick. Peter and Carla later get engaged.\n\nPeter begins an affair with Simon's nanny, [[Tina McIntyre]] ([[Michelle Keegan]]). Carla later finds out that she is pregnant and confides in [[Michelle Connor]] ([[Kym Marsh]]) that she isn't ready to be a mother. She almost has a termination but cannot go through with it. Carla informs Peter that she is pregnant, and on the same day Tina also tells Peter that she might be pregnant. Tina's pregnancy scare is later discovered to be a false alarm and Peter vows to stand by Carla and raise their child. Tina asks Peter to move away with her to a new life away from Weatherfield. Peter initially agrees, but after realising how much he loved Carla, he decides to stay in Weatherfield. Upset and angry, Tina threatens to tell Carla about their affair and viciously attacks Peter scratching him on the face. Peter leaves and decides to come clean to Carla about the affair before Tina can tell her. He tells her in the Rovers back room and Carla is devastated by his betrayal. At the same time, Carla's brother [[Rob Donovan]] ([[Marc Baylis]]) visits Tina and begs her not to tell Carla about the affair but Tina refuses and following a confrontation, falls from the balcony of the builder's yard. When she comes round and threatens Rob, he attacks her with a metal pipe. Peter is devastated when Tina is found seriously injured and hospitalised. Carla throws him out the following day, and he is questioned by the police over Tina's attack. He denies being responsible and is released on bail. Tina later dies of her injuries and Peter finds out when he comes into the pub drunk and begs Carla for another chance. She gives him a bottle of wine and tells him to drink himself to death. Carla later suffers a miscarriage and Rob swears revenge on Peter, blaming him for everything.\n\nThe Street turns on Peter in the aftermath of Tina's death, with everyone believing him to be responsible for her murder. A bracelet belonging to [[Steph Britton]] (Tisha Merry) that Rob had stolen from the flat to make it look like a burglary, is discovered in the Barlows' garden shed where Rob had accidentally dropped it. Peter is arrested after his fingerprints are discovered on the bracelet, after he had moved it into the kitchen. Peter is charged with Tina's murder and remanded in custody. In prison, Peter discovers that [[Jim McDonald (Coronation Street)|Jim McDonald]] ([[Charles Lawson]]), who is serving a sentence in the same prison for armed robbery, is running an illegal alcohol side venture; hence his nickname \"the Landlord\". Peter later finds Jim's stash in the prison kitchen, drinks it all and is hospitalised. When he regains consciousness he asks to see Carla and she comes to visit him. Thinking he is going to die, Peter tells Carla that he believes that she killed Tina and that he will take the blame for her and take her secret to the grave. Carla then realises that Peter is innocent if he genuinely believed her to be guilty. Peter recovers and goes on trial. Whilst giving evidence, Carla tells the court that she believes that Peter is innocent. Despite this, Peter is found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of fifteen years before he can apply for parole. Carla eventually discovers that Rob is the killer and reports him to the police. He is arrested and Peter is released from prison with his conviction overturned. He begs Carla for another chance but she refuses, Peter decides to leave Weatherfield and move back to Portsmouth and Simon begs him not to go but Peter convinces him that it is for the best. Peter briefly returned to attend stepmother Deirdre's funeral and briefly sees his ex-wife Carla, before leaving once again.\n\nIn October 2016, Peter arrived back on the street, surprising Ken and Tracy. However, when Ken becomes suspicious about his real intentions for returning, an almighty argument ensues between the pair, resulting in Ken suffering a severe [[stroke]]. Peter informs the doctors of the argument and worries that this may have contributed to Ken's stroke, however he is assured that the stroke occurred due to Ken's age. He is adamant for Tracy not to find out, however she does so when the nurse informs the Barlows of Ken's progress, and so Tracy orders Peter to leave Weatherfield. As he prepared to leave, Peter bumped into his long-time friend [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street)|Steve McDonald]] ([[Simon Gregson]]), who invites him to stay at [[The Rovers Return]]. In 2017, Peter buys The Rovers from Steve and his mother [[Liz McDonald|Liz]] ([[Beverley Callard]]), after Steve is ordered to sell up as part of Michelle's divorce settlement. Peter makes his new girlfriend [[Toyah Battersby]] ([[Georgia Taylor]]) the landlady, with Peter acting as pub landlord. In 2018, Peter and Toyah are delighted when they are informed that their surrogate has fallen pregnant with their baby, however Toyah later decides not to tell Peter when she learns that the surrogate has miscarried. Instead, she and Leanne's secretly pregnant half-sister [[Eva Price]] ([[Catherine Tyldesley]]) decide to pass her baby off as Peter and Toyah's, as Eva decides she does not want the baby. After the baby is born and named after Peter's deceased twin sister Susan, however, Toyah decides to reveal all to Peter, who therefore breaks up with Toyah. He sells The Rovers to [[Johnny Connor (Coronation Street)|Johnny]] ([[Richard Hawley (actor)|Richard Hawley]]) and [[Jenny Bradley|Jenny Connor]] ([[Sally Ann Matthews]]) and moves back in with Ken.\n\n==Creation==\n\n===Casting===\nRobert Heanue was the first actor to portray the character from 1965 to 1970. Chris Dormer played the role from 1970 to 1972 when the 7-year-old actor was written out of the soap due to his parents' emigration to Canada. He did not continue to act and reflected on his time as the young Peter in 2001, \"I really enjoyed the Street. I remember [[Pat Phoenix]] and [[Julie Goodyear]] kissing and tickling me because they thought I was cute. Most of the actors were nice, but some weren't. [[Violet Carson]], who played [[Ena Sharples]], was very grumpy. She didn't like children and really scared me.\" On-screen Peter and his sister Susan were written out of the soap to live with their grandparents when their mother Valerie Barlow was killed off.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+soaps'+lost+children%3b+HOW+YOUNG+STARS+COPED+WHEN+AXE+FELL+ON+FAME.-a073966802|title= The soaps' lost children; HOW YOUNG STARS COPED WHEN AXE FELL ON FAME.|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]] | date = 2001-05-02| accessdate=2010-04-09}}</ref>\n\nOne of the seven actors who has portrayed the character is [[Linus Roache]], the real-life son of [[William Roache]] who portrays Peter's father, [[Ken Barlow (Coronation Street)|Ken Barlow]] in the programme. Linus returned to the show in 2010, playing Lawrence Cunningham, another son of Ken Barlow.\n\n===Characterisation===\n\nUpon the character's return to the show in October 2008, Chris Gascoyne spoke of his character's destructive personality in an interview with ''[[Digital Spy]]'', he stated, \"He's been trying against the odds to sort his life out, but he can't. And when it doesn't work and it all goes wrong for him, he has a drink. There are hurdles in his way all the time. He's stubborn and resents people telling him what to do. He'll listen to advice, but he won't take any notice if he thinks the person giving it isn't in a place to do so. That happens a lot with Ken.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a137970/chris-gascoyne-peter-barlow-corrie.html|title=Chris Gascoyne (Peter Barlow, Corrie)|website=Digital Spy|author=Kris Green|date=16 December 2008|accessdate=2009-05-15}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n\n===Leanne Battersby===\n\nPeter returns to Weatherfield with his recently discovered son, [[Simon Barlow]] ([[Alex Bain (actor)|Alex Bain]]), and Leanne helps Peter as he struggles with fatherhood.> Leanne is still \"reeling\" after her ex-boyfriend, Dan, ends their relationship.

She didn't really have a passionate relationship with Tommy, but she can see herself having one with Peter.\" She continued: \"Tina is troubled by her feelings because she really likes Carla and she's not the sort of girl to do that to another woman. It's hard because she finds herself weakening whenever Peter is around. It gets to a point where Tina tells Peter that it might be best if she stops looking after Simon because she feels so out of control around him.\" As the story progresses, Tina begins to hope that Peter will not go through with his wedding to Carla. Keegan added: \"If he does, I'm not sure Tina will enjoy sticking around to watch the marriage unfold.

The character loses something by being here all the time and being ordinary. I'd like to do other stuff.

In July 2016, it was announced that Peter would be returning as a regular character and he returned on 17 October 2016.\n\nPeter's storylines have included a number of affairs, alcoholism and a custody battle involving his son [[Simon Barlow]] (Alex Bain). Peter became involved in a bigamy storyline when he married Rovers barmaid [[Shelley Unwin]] ([[Sally Lindsay]]) and florist [[Lucy Richards]] ([[Katy Carmichael]]). Having been discovered, Peter was left alone and fled Weatherfield. He returned briefly in 2007 when his stepsister [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]) was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of [[Charlie Stubbs (Coronation Street)|Charlie Stubbs]] ([[Bill Ward (actor)|Bill Ward]]). He returned for good in 2008 with five-year-old Simon, whom he had by Lucy; who had since died from breast cancer. Peter began a relationship with [[Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Danson]]) and they married during the [[Coronation Street Live (2010)|50th anniversary episode]]; however, they separated after Peter's affair with [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]) was discovered. Peter later went on to marry Carla, and then had an affair with much younger [[Tina McIntyre]] ([[Michelle Keegan]]). Peter was framed for Tina's murder by [[Rob Donovan]] ([[Marc Baylis]]) and upon his release from prison, his marriage to Carla broke down and he left. When he returned in 2016, it was revealed he had begun a relationship with [[Toyah Battersby]] ([[Georgia Taylor]]), which they agreed to keep secret from a pregnant Leanne, in order to not affect her pregnancy. Simon and Leanne's sister [[Eva Price]] ([[Catherine Tyldesley]]) soon discovered this, followed by Leanne, and he and Toyah subsequently purchased [[The Rovers Return]], from [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street)|Steve McDonald]] ([[Simon Gregson]]). He and Toyah soon begin family planning, with them beginning [[surrogacy]]; as Toyah had multiple failed IVF treatments in the past and was unable to conceive naturally. Their baby son was [[stillborn]], and Toyah and Eva secretly agreed to pretend that Eva and Aidan's daughter, [[Susie Price|Susie]], is Peter's daughter, as Eva does not want to be a mother, but Toyah tells Peter after Eva has a change of heart, resulting in their split. Afterwards, Peter buys 50% of the Underworld factory from [[Alya Nazir]] ([[Sair Khan]]), partnering with Carla, and supports Simon after he is the victim of bullying by former friend [[List of Coronation Street characters (2018)#Tyler Jefferies|Tyler Jefferies]] (Will Barnett), which results in Peter being shot with a [[paint gun]]. Peter also sleeps with [[Abi Franklin]] ([[Sally Carman]]) and supports Carla after the factory collapses after it is sabotaged by builder [[Gary Windass]] ([[Mikey North]]), which sees Carla blamed for the death of [[Rana Habeeb]] ([[Bhavna Limbachia]]). Carla has a mental breakdown before the couple reunite into another relationship.\n\n==Storylines==\n\n===1965\u20131986===\nPeter and his twin sister [[Susan Barlow|Susan]] were born to [[Ken Barlow|Ken]] ([[William Roache]]) and [[Valerie Barlow]] ([[Anne Reid]]). Ken and Val planned to emigrate to [[Jamaica]] with the twins as Ken had been offered a teaching post there. While Val was getting ready for a leaving party in the [[Rovers Return Inn]] for them, she was electrocuted and killed by a faulty [[hairdryer]]. Ken then sent the twins to [[Glasgow]] to live with Val's parents; he saw them only sporadically as they grew up.\n \nPeter did not attend Ken's wedding to [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre Langton]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]) in 1981 as he had joined the navy after leaving school, but he visited when Susan ([[Wendy Jane Walker]]) married [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]). As Ken refused to go to the wedding due to the feud he and Mike had, Peter made an emotional appeal, saying that he and Susan had barely seen their father and that he always assumed Ken would step up if his children needed him and he was able to help. Ken reconsiders and attends the wedding.\n\n===2000\u20132003===\nPeter returned in December 2000 after leaving the Navy and the collapse of his marriage to Jessica Midgeley, who left him for another man. He accidentally let it be known that Susan had a teenage son, [[Adam Barlow]] ([[Iain De Caestecker]]), fathered by Mike. Deirdre told [[Dev Alahan]] ([[Jimmi Harkishin]]), who then told Mike. Susan (now played by [[Joanna Foster]]), who had been visiting at the time, attempted to flee when Mike threatened legal action and she was killed in a car crash. Peter was devastated, blaming himself and Deirdre for Susan's death. He started dating barmaid, [[Shelley Unwin]] ([[Sally Lindsay]]), but when Peter's old Navy friend, [[Ciaran McCarthy]] ([[Keith Duffy]]), visited, he made a pass at Shelley, causing a temporary rift between the couple. Peter later met florist, [[Lucy Richards]] ([[Katy Carmichael]]), while buying flowers for Shelley. He was attracted to her and a brief affair occurred but Peter chose to marry Shelley.\nLucy, unknown to Peter, hired his stepsister, [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]), to work for her, covering her [[maternity leave]]. Tracy informed Peter that her employer was pregnant and Peter realised that he was the child's father. He offered to marry Lucy while still engaged to Shelley, promising her that his other relationship was over. Lucy gave birth to a son, [[Simon Barlow|Simon]] (Oscar and Jake Hartley). When she discovered that Peter was still seeing Shelley, she threw him out and banned him from seeing Simon. Peter was torn between his son and Shelley, but eventually married her, thus committing [[bigamy]]. When both women discover Peter's secret, Shelley threw him out and the two women temporarily took over his betting shop. Lucy told Peter that she and Simon would emigrate to [[Australia]] alone, threatening to expose his crime if he contested her decision. Peter resigned himself to the situation and moved back to [[Portsmouth]].\n\n===2007\u2013===\nPeter returns to [[Weatherfield]] after Ken contacts him in regards to Tracy's stormy relationship with her boyfriend, [[Charlie Stubbs (Coronation Street)|Charlie Stubbs]] ([[Bill Ward (actor)|Bill Ward]]). Tracy later kills Charlie, supposedly in self-defence, and Peter decides to stay when she is charged with murder. Peter later has a brief fling with [[Maria Connor|Maria Sutherland]] ([[Samia Ghadie]]), however, once Tracy is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, Peter returns to Portsmouth, taking Adam with him, and ending his relationship with Maria.\n\nLucy dies from [[ovarian cancer]] and Peter is given custody of five-year-old Simon (now played by [[Alex Bain (actor)|Alex Bain]]). Due to his business in Portsmouth failing, Peter brings Simon back to Weatherfield, seeking Ken and Deirdre's help but Ken suspects, correctly, that Peter plans to leave Simon with him. Peter changes his mind when he learns that Lucy had left her estate to him, providing that he used it for Simon's benefit. He buys the local bookmakers and renames it \"Barlow's Bookies\". Peter begins a relationship with [[Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Danson]]). Peter and Leanne decide to open a bar, but Ken is hesitant about the venture because of Peter's alcoholism. On the opening night of the bar, Peter falls off the wagon and gets drunk and is forced to go to [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]]. Peter and Leanne get engaged, but Peter feels threatened by the return of Leanne's ex-husband, [[Nick Tilsley]] ([[Ben Price]]), until Leanne convinces him that Nick is just a friend. Nick decides to open the bar and offers Leanne a job as bar manager. Feeling guilty for ruining her previous venture, Peter persuades her to take the job and starts mentoring Leanne's friend, [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]), when he realises that she also has a drink problem. Carla begins to lean on Peter emotionally for support and she later attempts to seduce him. Peter then tells Carla that he cannot see her any more.\n\nPeter celebrates his stag do at his and Leanne's former bar, The Joinery, owned by Nick in December 2010. The premises is destroyed by an explosion caused by a problem with the gas supply. Following the explosion, a tram derails and crashes into the street. The bar is destroyed and Peter is trapped inside. Peter is rushed to [[hospital]] with crush injuries to his legs and trauma to his lower back and chest, and suffers a [[cardiac tamponade]]. Aware that he is unlikely to survive, he marries Leanne in his hospital bed and goes into [[cardiac arrest]] moments after the ceremony has concluded. Fortunately, he survives and leaves hospital in a wheelchair.\n\nPeter supports Carla again after her mother dies, and this makes Leanne, who knows about Carla's feelings for Peter, feel insecure and causes several arguments between the two women. Carla is subsequently raped by crooked businessman [[Frank Foster (Coronation Street)|Frank Foster]] ([[Andrew Lancel]]) and Peter lends much emotional support, to the annoyance of Leanne. Peter begins drinking again and goes to Carla's flat, telling her that she was the woman he loved and that he would leave Leanne for her. He and Carla sleep together that night and an affair begins. Leanne finds out about the affair but offers to forgive him and try to work on fixing their marriage but Peter tells her that he loves Carla. Leanne leaves in a taxi with a tearful Simon running after the car, begging her to stay. Simon then starts misbehaving with Peter as he blames him and Carla for Leanne's departure. When Leanne returns, she fights Peter for custody of Simon and Leanne eventually wins a residency order, at the same time reconciling with Nick. Peter and Carla later get engaged.\n\nPeter begins an affair with Simon's nanny, [[Tina McIntyre]] ([[Michelle Keegan]]). Carla later finds out that she is pregnant and confides in [[Michelle Connor]] ([[Kym Marsh]]) that she isn't ready to be a mother. She almost has a termination but cannot go through with it. Carla informs Peter that she is pregnant, and on the same day Tina also tells Peter that she might be pregnant. Tina's pregnancy scare is later discovered to be a false alarm and Peter vows to stand by Carla and raise their child. Tina asks Peter to move away with her to a new life away from Weatherfield. Peter initially agrees, but after realising how much he loved Carla, he decides to stay in Weatherfield. Upset and angry, Tina threatens to tell Carla about their affair and viciously attacks Peter scratching him on the face. Peter leaves and decides to come clean to Carla about the affair before Tina can tell her. He tells her in the Rovers back room and Carla is devastated by his betrayal. At the same time, Carla's brother [[Rob Donovan]] ([[Marc Baylis]]) visits Tina and begs her not to tell Carla about the affair but Tina refuses and following a confrontation, falls from the balcony of the builder's yard. When she comes round and threatens Rob, he attacks her with a metal pipe. Peter is devastated when Tina is found seriously injured and hospitalised. Carla throws him out the following day, and he is questioned by the police over Tina's attack. He denies being responsible and is released on bail. Tina later dies of her injuries and Peter finds out when he comes into the pub drunk and begs Carla for another chance. She gives him a bottle of wine and tells him to drink himself to death. Carla later suffers a miscarriage and Rob swears revenge on Peter, blaming him for everything.\n\nThe Street turns on Peter in the aftermath of Tina's death, with everyone believing him to be responsible for her murder. A bracelet belonging to [[Steph Britton]] (Tisha Merry) that Rob had stolen from the flat to make it look like a burglary, is discovered in the Barlows' garden shed where Rob had accidentally dropped it. Peter is arrested after his fingerprints are discovered on the bracelet, after he had moved it into the kitchen. Peter is charged with Tina's murder and remanded in custody. In prison, Peter discovers that [[Jim McDonald (Coronation Street)|Jim McDonald]] ([[Charles Lawson]]), who is serving a sentence in the same prison for armed robbery, is running an illegal alcohol side venture; hence his nickname \"the Landlord\". Peter later finds Jim's stash in the prison kitchen, drinks it all and is hospitalised. When he regains consciousness he asks to see Carla and she comes to visit him. Thinking he is going to die, Peter tells Carla that he believes that she killed Tina and that he will take the blame for her and take her secret to the grave. Carla then realises that Peter is innocent if he genuinely believed her to be guilty. Peter recovers and goes on trial. Whilst giving evidence, Carla tells the court that she believes that Peter is innocent. Despite this, Peter is found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of fifteen years before he can apply for parole. Carla eventually discovers that Rob is the killer and reports him to the police. He is arrested and Peter is released from prison with his conviction overturned. He begs Carla for another chance but she refuses, Peter decides to leave Weatherfield and move back to Portsmouth and Simon begs him not to go but Peter convinces him that it is for the best. Peter briefly returned to attend stepmother Deirdre's funeral and briefly sees his ex-wife Carla, before leaving once again.\n\nIn October 2016, Peter arrived back on the street, surprising Ken and Tracy. However, when Ken becomes suspicious about his real intentions for returning, an almighty argument ensues between the pair, resulting in Ken suffering a severe [[stroke]]. Peter informs the doctors of the argument and worries that this may have contributed to Ken's stroke, however he is assured that the stroke occurred due to Ken's age. He is adamant for Tracy not to find out, however she does so when the nurse informs the Barlows of Ken's progress, and so Tracy orders Peter to leave Weatherfield. As he prepared to leave, Peter bumped into his long-time friend [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street)|Steve McDonald]] ([[Simon Gregson]]), who invites him to stay at [[The Rovers Return]]. In 2017, Peter buys The Rovers from Steve and his mother [[Liz McDonald|Liz]] ([[Beverley Callard]]), after Steve is ordered to sell up as part of Michelle's divorce settlement. Peter makes his new girlfriend [[Toyah Battersby]] ([[Georgia Taylor]]) the landlady, with Peter acting as pub landlord. In 2018, Peter and Toyah are delighted when they are informed that their surrogate has fallen pregnant with their baby, however Toyah later decides not to tell Peter when she learns that the surrogate has miscarried. Instead, she and Leanne's secretly pregnant half-sister [[Eva Price]] ([[Catherine Tyldesley]]) decide to pass her baby off as Peter and Toyah's, as Eva decides she does not want the baby. After the baby is born and named after Peter's deceased twin sister Susan, however, Toyah decides to reveal all to Peter, who therefore breaks up with Toyah. He sells The Rovers to [[Johnny Connor (Coronation Street)|Johnny]] ([[Richard Hawley (actor)|Richard Hawley]]) and [[Jenny Bradley|Jenny Connor]] ([[Sally Ann Matthews]]) and moves back in with Ken.\n\n==Creation==\n\n===Casting===\nRobert Heanue was the first actor to portray the character from 1965 to 1970. Chris Dormer played the role from 1970 to 1972 when the 7-year-old actor was written out of the soap due to his parents' emigration to Canada. He did not continue to act and reflected on his time as the young Peter in 2001, \"I really enjoyed the Street. I remember [[Pat Phoenix]] and [[Julie Goodyear]] kissing and tickling me because they thought I was cute. Most of the actors were nice, but some weren't. [[Violet Carson]], who played [[Ena Sharples]], was very grumpy. She didn't like children and really scared me.\" On-screen Peter and his sister Susan were written out of the soap to live with their grandparents when their mother Valerie Barlow was killed off.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+soaps'+lost+children%3b+HOW+YOUNG+STARS+COPED+WHEN+AXE+FELL+ON+FAME.-a073966802|title= The soaps' lost children; HOW YOUNG STARS COPED WHEN AXE FELL ON FAME.|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]] | date = 2001-05-02| accessdate=2010-04-09}}</ref>\n\nOne of the seven actors who has portrayed the character is [[Linus Roache]], the real-life son of [[William Roache]] who portrays Peter's father, [[Ken Barlow (Coronation Street)|Ken Barlow]] in the programme.

And when it doesn't work and it all goes wrong for him, he has a drink. There are hurdles in his way all the time. He's stubborn and resents people telling him what to do. He'll listen to advice, but he won't take any notice if he thinks the person giving it isn't in a place to do so.

It then headed southeast towards Elie, where it destroyed four houses, flipped cars, and even tossed one homeowner's [[Chrysler Fifth Avenue]] onto a neighbour's roof.<ref>Reported on page B1 in the [[Windsor Star]], [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Ontario]], June 23, 2007</ref> The tornado lingered over the same area of Elie for approximately four minutes before it cut sharply to the south and rapidly dissipated. The tornado traveled about {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} and was {{convert|300|m|yd|abbr=on}} wide at its widest during its 40-minute lifespan. The tornado repeatedly struck essentially the same area of town, destroying most of the structures and vehicles in the area. The people in Elie were prepared and took the necessary precautions during the event. A video of the tornado shows an entire two-story home swiped off its foundation and tossed {{convert|75|ft}} in the air before rotating around the tornado and then being obliterated. Also seen on the video was a three-quarters-of-a-ton GM van filled with drywall picked up and tossed hundreds of feet. At least 3 houses are seen being destroyed on the video, with many more being damaged as well as vehicles, and the mill is seen being damaged, with bins and roofs being destroyed there.\n\nAt the same time as the Elie tornado, another tornado was touching down close to nearby [[Oakville, Manitoba|Oakville]]. That tornado was rated as an F3 with winds of {{convert|295|km/h|abbr=on}} after it destroyed several outbuildings and many trees. Two tornadoes not far from each other at the same time was a rare occurrence for the people watching the events unfold that evening.\n\nThe following day, [[Environment and Climate Change Canada|Environment Canada]] sent out a storm damage survey team from the [[Prairie and Arctic Storm Prediction Centre]] to assess the damage caused by the tornado. On September 18, 2007, the tornado was upgraded to F5 on the [[Fujita scale]] from the original F4 based on video analysis of the tornado and reassessment of the damage.<ref name=\"Elie now F5\"/> This was the first tornado in Canada to be officially rated as such, making it the strongest confirmed tornado in Canadian history. It was one of only two F5/EF5 tornadoes that year ([[Tornado outbreak of May 4\u20136, 2007|the other being in]] [[Greensburg, Kansas]] on May 4, 2007), and there have only been nine confirmed since 1999. At the time, Canada had not adopted the [[Enhanced Fujita scale]].\n\n== Weather conditions prior to the tornado==\n[[File:F5 tornado funnel cloud Elie Manitoba 2007.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Funnel cloud that would produce the Elie tornado.]]\nThe [[Synoptic scale meteorology|synoptic situation]] on June 22 was conducive to a major severe weather event in southern Manitoba. A low pressure system came in from Saskatchewan through the day, and then moved over southern Manitoba throughout the evening. A warm front was positioned north of Elie for much of the day with a trailing cold front residing west of Elie near the Lake Manitoba basin southwest through southeast Saskatchewan. A lake breeze boundary was also present south of Lake Manitoba.\n\nVery warm air was situated over Southern Manitoba that day as temperatures climbed into the high 20s \u00b0C (low 80s \u00b0F). The humidity was also uncomfortably high, with dewpoints ranging from {{convert|18|\u2013|22|C}}. Strong wind shear was present, reflected in high helicity values. These conditions were favourable for [[supercell]]s, which are thunderstorms with rotating updrafts, and they developed within the warm sector located in the Red River Valley and areas farther west. The situation was exacerbated by the presence of the lake breeze boundary because the atmosphere was [[Capping inversion|capped]] through much of the day with little in the way of a trigger. This boundary provided the focus for storms to develop rapidly and become severe, given the high instability present.\n\n==Confirmed tornadoes June 22\u201323==\n{{Tornado Chart | Total=5 | F0=1 | F1=1 | F2=0 | F3=2| F4=0| F5=1}}\n\n===June 22 event===\n{{tornado table header |fulldate= Friday, June 22, 2007|pathwidth=yes}}\n{{tornado table row | state=Manitoba|pathwidth=yes}}\n{{tornado table row\n | f=5\n | location=[[Elie, Manitoba|Elie]] area\n | county=[[Central Plains Region, Manitoba|Central Plains]]\n | coord={{Coord|49.8968|-97.7927|name=Elie (June 22, F5)}}\n | touchdown=2208\n | dissipation=\n | pathlength={{convert|6|km}}\n | pathwidth={{convert|300|yd|m|abbr=on}}\n | comments=A narrow but violent tornado was spawned outside of the town of Elie and went through the town, destroying several homes and damaging the town's flour mill.
