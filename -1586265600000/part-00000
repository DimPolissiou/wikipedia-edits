He became nationally known for filing charges against [[Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|House majority leader]] [[Tom DeLay]] in September 2005 for [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiring]] to violate [[Texas]]' [[election law]] and/or to [[money laundering|launder]] money. In Texas, Earle was known for his criminal justice reform efforts which focused on crime prevention, alternative sentencing, victim advocacy, and the reintegration of former offenders into society. In 1983, Earle - an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] - prosecuted ''himself'' for an election law [[Offense (law)|violation]] after missing a [[campaign finance]] filing deadline by one day; he was fined $212.<ref name=\"CSDeLay\">{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1203/p01s04-usgn.html|title=The Texas DA pitted against the power of Tom DeLay|publisher=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=December 3, 2004|first=Kris|last=Axtman|accessdate=2009-11-04}}</ref> Earle was a fixture in Travis County politics and served in public office there for more than 30 years, joking that he was asked if he was the \"District Eternity\".<ref>https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/news/2020-04-06/former-travis-county-d-a-ronnie-earle-dies/</ref> \n\nEarle spoke extensively on his belief that the law guided public responses to crime but that it was society's collective \"ethics infrastructure\" that required support to deliver a safer, more just, and more livable community. This belief guided him, as he told the [[Austin Chronicle]] in 2008,  \"It really informs everything I've tried to do \u2013 well, not everything, but most of the things I've tried to do as district attorney, especially the most progressive and innovative things that we have done in this office. And the reason is because the law doesn't teach you how to act. ... What I have come to call the 'ethics infrastructure' teaches you how to act. And that is in that work of mommas and daddies and aunts and uncles and teachers and preachers and neighbors and cousins and friends \u2013 that's where you learn how to act, not from the law.\"<ref>https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2008-04-11/610887/</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early Life===\nEarle was born in [[Fort Worth, Texas]] and raised on a [[cattle]] [[ranching|ranch]] in [[Birdville, Texas]].<ref name=\"CSDeLay\" /> He achieved the rank of [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]], earned money working as a [[lifeguard]], played [[American football|football]], and was president of his high school student council.<ref name=\"CSDeLay\" /><ref>{{Cite news | url = https://www.salon.com/2005/11/12/earle_8/ | title = Earle's last stand | date = November 13, 2005 | first1 = Rob | last1 = Patterson | work = [[Salon (website)|Salon]] | via = www.salon.com | access-date = June 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nEarle moved to Austin when he was 19 to attend the college at the [[University of Texas]] and law school at the [[University of Texas School of Law]]. In 1967, while a law student, he went to work in the office of Texas Governor [[John Connally]].<ref>\nDistrict Eternity - Ronnie Earle on Ronnie Earle - Austin Chronicle - https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2008-04-11/610887/</ref> After graduating from law school,{{cn|date=June 2019}} he was appointed and served as a municipal judge in that city from 1969 to 1972.

He faced opponents only twice during his unprecedented tenure.<ref>Austin American-Statesman - \"Former Travis County DA Ronnie Earle has died\" - https://www.statesman.com/news/20200405/breaking-former-travis-county-da-ronnie-earle-has-died</ref>\n\nEarle was married to his second wife, Twila Hugley Earle, for nearly three decades. With his first wife, Barbara Ann Leach Earle, he had two children, [[Elisabeth Earle|Elisabeth Ashlea Earle]] and Charles Jason Earle. He also had one stepdaughter, Nikki Leigh Rowling, and three grandchildren.\n\n===Career as the District Attorney===\nThe Travis County District Attorney's office investigates and prosecutes crimes related to the operation of the Texas state government. Earle was elected as a Democrat in the city of [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. He was, and his successor now is, the only Democrat with statewide prosecutorial authority. During his tenure, Earle prosecuted a variety of elected officials from both sides of the aisle, often dismissing accusations of partisanship by pointing out that prosecutions tend to focus on officials in power. He prosecuted Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox, a Democrat; United States Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican; and - in his most high-profile case - United States House Majority Leader, Congressman Tom Delay, a Republican. Mattox was acquitted by a jury, Hutchison's case was dismissed, and DeLay was found guilty of money laundering, but his case was later overturned on appeal by the Republican-dominated Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.<ref>https://www.statesman.com/news/20200405/breaking-former-travis-county-da-ronnie-earle-has-died</ref>\n\nWhile his high-profile prosecutions of elected officials garnered the most press attention, it was Earle's work in criminal justice reform that was his primary focus. He was an early champion of reforms that, in his words, were \u201cengaging the community in its own protection.\u201d Earle's innovations focused on crime prevention, alternative sentencing, victim advocacy, and the reintegration of former offenders into society. He spoke nationally on this work, and engaged in criminal justice reform efforts until his death. \n\nIn late 2007, Earle announced that he would not seek reelection to his post. His departure precipitated a race to fill his seat. Four Democrats, all employees of his office, ran for the seat. In the [[primary election]] held on March 4, 2008, no candidate received 50 percent of the vote. A [[runoff election]] was held between the top two finishers, and [[Rosemary Lehmberg]] \u2013 whom Earle had endorsed \u2013 won handily. She faced no Republican opponent in the general election. She took office in January 2009 and is the first woman district attorney in Travis County history.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nIn 2010, Earle ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Texas, using the campaign to promote his criminal justice reform agenda.\n\n===Later Life===\nEarle retired in Austin and remained active in criminal justice reform efforts. He died in Austin, Texas on April 5, 2020 after a long illness.<ref>https://www.statesman.com/news/20200405/breaking-former-travis-county-da-ronnie-earle-has-died</ref>\n\n==Major Public Integrity Investigations Conducted by Earle==\nThrough the Travis County Public Integrity Unit, Earle prosecuted [[politician]]s, including [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]],  United States House Majority Leader [[Tom Delay]], Texas State Representative [[Mike Martin (politician)|Mike Martin]], and Texas Attorney General [[Jim Mattox]].<ref>https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2008-04-11/610888/</ref> Defendants often accused Earle of partisanship, which he dismissed by pointing out that the prosecuted those in power, and that the bulk of prosecutions during his career had been brought against fellow Democrats.\n\n===Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Yarbrough===\nIn 1978, Earle accused Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Yarbrough, a Democrat, of forgery, aggravated perjury, and failure to appear. \n\n===Travis County Commissioner Bob Honts===-\nIn 1979, he accused Travis County Commissioner Bob Honts, a Democrat, of official misconduct and bribery. Commissioner Honts pled guilty to a misdemeanor, \"misapplying county property\", in 1984. He was ordered to pay a $2,000 fine.\n\n===Texas State Senator Gene Jones===\nIn 1980, Earle accused Texas State Senator Eugene 'Gene' Jones, a Democrat from Houston, of using a state computer to prepare campaign mailings. Jones pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge of official misconduct, paid $2,000 fine and $10,000 in restitution.\n\n===Indictment of State Rep. Mike Martin===\nOn July 31, 1981 during the First Called Session of the Sixty-seventh Texas Legislature, Republican Representative [[Mike Martin (politician)|Mike Martin]], a Republican then of [[Longview, Texas|Longview]], was shot in the left arm outside his trailer in Austin with 00-buckshot. Soon after the shooting, unidentified spokespeople from Earle's office released information to the ''Austin American Statesman'' that they felt Martin was telling inconsistent stories to the police. They claimed he first said he had no idea who did it; later he said it was a [[Satanism|Satanic cult]]; in the end, he accused his political enemies. \n\nMartin responded to the leaks by saying he was asked to give police all possibilities and said he had no idea why the district attorney's office would be saying such things. Earle personally made a public announcement that Martin was cooperating with police and that no one from his office was releasing information saying otherwise to ''The Statesman''. Earle formed a grand jury to look into the shooting of Martin and invited him to attend without issuing a subpoena.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nMartin refused to appear by issuing a statement that he had already given officials all the information he knew. Gregg County District Attorney Rob Foster shortly arrested Martin on a three-year-old [[assault]] charge. The charge was immediately dismissed due to time limits and lack of evidence. Upon release, Martin appeared before reporters and accused Gregg County officials of using their offices to ruin him politically. The day after his release on the assault charge, Martin voluntarily appeared before Earle's grand jury.\n\nAt the time he didn't know that his first cousin, Charles Goff, had previously appeared before the grand jury and admitted helping Martin stage the event to advance Martin's political career. He claimed Martin offered him a state job as payment, despite Texas' strong [[nepotism]] laws forbidding the hiring of relatives. Goff had served prison time and had three outstanding felony warrants pending at the time of his testimony; however, the grand jury took his word over Martin's. After Martin's denial of Goff's accusations before the grand jury, Earle filed felony perjury charges against the freshman legislator. Martin pleaded not guilty and, a year later, worked out a [[plea bargain]] with Earle by admitting to [[misdemeanor]] perjury charges relating to the renting of a car around the time of the shooting. Martin resigned his House seat on April 22, 1982 and withdrew from the upcoming election. Martin filed several suits against Earle, Foster, and Goff for civil rights violations. A federal judge dismissed the last case in June 1985 on grounds that prosecutors enjoy [[qualified immunity]] from [[civil lawsuit|civil suits]]. Martin maintains his innocence regarding Earle's charges.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Texas State Treasurer Warren G. Harding===\nIn 1981, Texas State Treasurer Warren G. Harding, a Democrat, pled guilty to class A misdemeanor of official misconduct. He received a one year deferred adjudication, paid a $2,000 fine, and paid $2,000 in restitution.\n\n===Texas Speaker of the House Gib Lewis===\nIn 1983, the Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, Gib Lewis, a Democrat, pled guilty to a class B misdemeanor for failing to file his financial statement. He paid an $800 fine.\n\n===Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox===\nIn 1983, Earle accused then-Attorney General [[Jim Mattox]] of threatening Fulbright & Jaworski's municipal bond business unless one of their lawyers stopped trying to question his sister, Janice Mattox, about a bank loan. The loan was an issue in a lawsuit involving Mobil Oil Co. and [[Clinton Manges]], a South Texas oil man and rancher who financially supported Mattox, who was acquitted after a long trial.\n\n===San Antonio Voter Registrar Marco Gomez===\nIn 1983, San Antonio Voter Registrar Marco Gomez, a Democrat pled guilty to charges of \"securing execution of document by deception and tampering with a governmental record.\" He received 10 years probation, 90 days in the Travis County Jail, paid $49,994 in restitution, and paid a $2,000 fine.\n\n===Texas State Representative Charles Staniswallis===\nIn 1983, Texas State Representative Charles Staniswallis, A Republican, pled guilty to charges of theft and tampering with a governmental record. Staniswallis received 10 years probation, paid a $2,000 fine, and paid $8,976 in restitution.\n\n===Texas Speaker of the House Gib Lewis===\nIn 1992, the Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, Gib Lewis, a Democrat, pled guilty to two counts of filing false financial statements. He paid a $1,000 fine on each count.\n\n===United States Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison===\nIn 1994, Earle filed charges against Senator [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]], a Republican then serving as [[Texas State Treasurer]], for tampering with physical evidence, tampering with a governmental record, and official misconduct. On the first day in court, following an evidentiary hearing in which it became clear that the judge would rule much of his evidence inadmissible, Earle attempted to drop the charges in order to regroup but the judge refused to allow it, [[directed verdict|instructing the jury]] to return a \"not guilty\" verdict so the [[double jeopardy|charge could not be brought]] against her again.<ref name=\"CSDeLay\"/> \n\n===Texas State Representative Betty Denton===\nIn 1995, Texas State Representative Betty Denton, a Democrat, pled guilty to misdemeanor charges of perjury. She received six months deferred adjudication and paid a $2,000 fine.\n\n===Lane Denton===\nIn 1995, Lane Denton, a Democrat and the executive director of the Department of Public Safety Officers' Assoc\u00adi\u00ada\u00adtion was found guilty of second degree theft (a felony) and misapplication of fiduciary property. He was ordered to pay $67,201 in restitution along with a $12,000 fine. Additionally, he was sentenced to 10 years of probation, 60 days in jail, and 240 hours of community service.\n\n===Texas State Representative Gilbert Serna===\nIn 2000, Texas State Representative Gilbert Serna, a Democrat, pled guilty to multiple charges of theft by public servant. He was placed on probation for 10 years, was sentenced to 90 days in jail, and was required to pay a $3,000 fine along with restitution of more than $13,000.\n===Investigation and Indictment of Tom DeLay===\nFor over two years, Earle and eight separate grand juries investigated possible violations of Texas campaign finance law in the 2002 state legislative election. Earle denies that his pursuit of DeLay was part of a partisan \"[[fishing expedition]]\". His investigation of two political action committees that spent a combined $3.4 million on 22 Republican Texas House races focused on a [[political action committee]] founded by DeLay, (Texans for a Republican Majority PAC). During the investigation, DeLay charged that Earle was a \"runaway district attorney\" with \"a long history of being vindictive and partisan\". On September 28, 2005, a grand jury indicted DeLay for conspiring to violate Texas state election law. Texas prohibits corporate contributions in state legislative races. The indictment charged that [[Texans for a Republican Majority]], DeLay's PAC, accepted corporate contributions, [[money laundering|laundered the money]] through the [[Republican National Committee]], and directed it to favored Republican candidates in Texas. The presiding judge in the case, [[Pat Priest (judge)|Pat Priest]], a Democrat, eventually threw out the charge and the Court of Criminals Appeals upheld this decision in 2007.<ref name=\"court throws out DeLay charge\">{{cite news|url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/legislature/entries/2007/06/27/high_court_upholds_dismissal_of_indictment_against_delay.html|title=High Court Upholds Dismissal of Indictment Against DeLay|publisher=[[Austin American Statesman]]|date=June 27, 2007|first=Laylan|last=Copelin|accessdate=2008-07-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830004330/http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/legislature/entries/2007/06/27/high_court_upholds_dismissal_of_indictment_against_delay.html|archivedate=August 30, 2008}}</ref>\n\nEarle's second attempt to secure indictments against DeLay failed. That grand jury returned a \"no bill\" due to insufficient evidence. The jury member questioned stated that Earle appeared visibly angry with the \"no bill\" decision.<ref name=\"Boston2005\">{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2005/10/06/other_jury_declined_to_indict_delay?mode=PF|title=Other jury declined to indict DeLay|agency=Associated Press|date=October 6, 2005|first=Suzanne|last=Gamboa|accessdate=2006-10-19|work=The Boston Globe}}</ref>\n\nEarle eventually received an indictment against DeLay from a third Austin grand jury that had been seated for a few hours.<ref name=\"just a few hours\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/04/politics/04delay.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1mode=PF|title=DeLay is indicted again in Texas; Money Laundering is charge|last=Shenon|first=Phil|date=October 3, 2005|work=New York Times|accessdate=2008-07-02}}</ref> This indictment was on charges of conspiracy to launder money. DeLay's lawyers asserted the indictment was flawed legally, as laundered money is defined in the Texas Penal Code as money gained in the ''\"proceeds of criminal activity\"''. DeLay's defense stressed that corporate donations to political campaigns are a normal, legal business activity. Due to a House rule requiring a party leader to step down if indicted, the indictment required DeLay to resign as Majority Leader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/robertnovak/2005/10/03/criminalizing_politics/page/full|last=Novak|first=Robert|title=Criminalizing politics|work=Townhall Magazine|date=October 3, 2005|accessdate=2013-12-15}}</ref> In a counter complaint, DeLay's attorney, [[Dick DeGuerin]], filed a motion against DA Earle, charging him with [[prosecutorial misconduct]] in the DeLay indictment. DeGuerin sought court permission to depose grand jurors.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2005/10/07/delay-attorney-files-motion-against-da.html|title=DeLay's Attorney Files Motion Against DA|date=2005-10-07|work=Fox News|access-date=2018-04-04|agency=Associated Press|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nDeLay filed a motion for a change of venue from the [[Politics of Texas#Current situation|Democrat stronghold]] of [[Travis County, Texas|Travis County]] to [[Fort Bend County, Texas|Fort Bend County]], where he resides. The motion was denied by Judge Priest and a trial date for October 2010 was set. On November 24, 2010, DeLay was convicted of [[money laundering]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/11/24/jury-convicts-delay-money-laundering-trial.html|title=Tom DeLay Convicted of Money Laundering|date=2010-11-24|work=Fox News|access-date=2018-04-04|agency=Associated Press|language=en-US}}</ref> The conviction was overturned by the Republican-dominated Third Court of Appeals for the State of Texas in September 2013.

Earle's evidence rested on an alleged confession by Murray, obtained by interrogation at a children's shelter in the absence of any attorney or family member. Murray's case provoked several public protests of Earle's office and at the Texas State Capitol from her detention in 1996 until her release in 1999, when the case was reviewed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2003-12-12/naked-city/|title=Naked City: Lacresha Murray suit proceeds|last=Smith|first=Jordan|date=2003-12-12|work=The Austin Chronicle|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nMurray was again tried and convicted of intentional injury to a child, receiving a 25-year sentence. In 2001, the Texas 3rd Court of Appeals reversed and remanded her sentence after finding that her confession was illegally obtained. Furthermore, a liver tissue examination by a pathologist expert in the field showed that the injury was inflicted hours before and thus not by Murray; and clothes worn by the toddler had no blood traces that were inevitable given the injuries\u2014indicating the clothes were changed after the toddler was beaten.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2000-11-03/79252/|title=Naked City: Murray's Law|last=Smith|first=Amy|date=2000-11-03|work=The Austin Chronicle|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nFaced with the evidence Earle eventually dropped all charges against Murray. In 2002, a suit was filed against the Travis County District Attorney's Office and a host of other individuals and various agencies, which alleged the Murray family had been victimized by [[malicious prosecution]], [[defamation]], [[libel]] and [[slander]], and had suffered mental anguish. Charges of racism were also raised in the suit, suggesting that the Murray family would have been treated differently had they been white. Murray's suit was dismissed; on November 28, 2005, the [[US Supreme Court]] refused to revive the lawsuit.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n===Maurice Pierce Case===\nOn December 6, 1991, four teenage girls were murdered inside a local yogurt shop in Austin. In 1999, Earle led the \"[[Yogurt Shop Murders]]\" case against suspect Maurice Pierce, leading to a grand jury indicting him on four counts of first degree murder. Pierce was arrested, along with Robert Springsteen IV, Michael Scott, and Forrest Welborn, for the murders of four girls. Springsteen and Scott eventually confessed to the crime. Springsteen was convicted and [[death penalty|sentenced to death]]. Scott was convicted and sentenced to [[life in prison]].\n\nWelborn was never indicted for the crime. Pierce continually maintained his innocence up until his release, occurring three years after his arrest. The state could not use Springsteen's and Scott's confessions against Pierce, so, without a confession, and only circumstantial evidence to connect him to the yogurt shop, the state had to either try Pierce or release him. Earle released him and dropped all charges citing a lack of evidence.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2003-02-07/144295/|title=Pierce Freed After Three Years: \"Godspeed\"|last=Smith|first=Jordan|date=2003-02-07|work=The Austin Chronicle|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-US}}</ref> The case against Pierce remains open.

He became nationally known for filing charges against [[Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|House majority leader]] [[Tom DeLay]] in September 2005 for [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiring]] to violate [[Texas]]' [[election law]] and/or to [[money laundering|launder]] money. In Texas, Earle was known for his criminal justice reform efforts which focused on crime prevention, alternative sentencing, victim advocacy, and the reintegration of former offenders into society. In 1983, Earle - an [[Eagle Scout]] - prosecuted ''himself'' for an election law [[Offense (law)|violation]] after missing a [[campaign finance]] filing deadline by one day; he was fined $212.<ref name=\"CSDeLay\">{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1203/p01s04-usgn.html|title=The Texas DA pitted against the power of Tom DeLay|publisher=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=December 3, 2004|first=Kris|last=Axtman|accessdate=2009-11-04}}</ref> Earle was a fixture in Travis County politics and served in public office there for more than 30 years, joking that he was asked if he was the \"District Eternity\".<ref>https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/news/2020-04-06/former-travis-county-d-a-ronnie-earle-dies/</ref> \n\nEarle spoke extensively on his belief that the law guided public responses to crime but that it was society's collective \"ethics infrastructure\" that required support to deliver a safer, more just, and more livable community. This belief guided him, as he told the [[Austin Chronicle]] in 2008,  \"It really informs everything I've tried to do \u2013 well, not everything, but most of the things I've tried to do as district attorney, especially the most progressive and innovative things that we have done in this office. And the reason is because the law doesn't teach you how to act. ... What I have come to call the 'ethics infrastructure' teaches you how to act. And that is in that work of mommas and daddies and aunts and uncles and teachers and preachers and neighbors and cousins and friends \u2013 that's where you learn how to act, not from the law.\"<ref>https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2008-04-11/610887/</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early Life===\nEarle was born in [[Fort Worth, Texas]] and raised on a [[cattle]] [[ranching|ranch]] in [[Birdville, Texas]].<ref name=\"CSDeLay\" /> He achieved the rank of [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]], earned money working as a [[lifeguard]], played [[American football|football]], and was president of his high school student council.<ref name=\"CSDeLay\" /><ref>{{Cite news | url = https://www.salon.com/2005/11/12/earle_8/ | title = Earle's last stand | date = November 13, 2005 | first1 = Rob | last1 = Patterson | work = [[Salon (website)|Salon]] | via = www.salon.com | access-date = June 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nEarle moved to Austin when he was 19 to attend the college at the [[University of Texas]] and law school at the [[University of Texas School of Law]]. In 1967, while a law student, he went to work in the office of Texas Governor [[John Connally]].<ref>\nDistrict Eternity - Ronnie Earle on Ronnie Earle - Austin Chronicle - https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2008-04-11/610887/</ref> After graduating from law school,{{cn|date=June 2019}} he was appointed and served as a municipal judge in that city from 1969 to 1972.

He faced opponents only twice during his unprecedented tenure.<ref>Austin American-Statesman - \"Former Travis County DA Ronnie Earle has died\" - https://www.statesman.com/news/20200405/breaking-former-travis-county-da-ronnie-earle-has-died</ref>\n\nEarle was married to his second wife, Twila Hugley Earle, for nearly three decades. With his first wife, Barbara Ann Leach Earle, he had two children, [[Elisabeth Earle|Elisabeth Ashlea Earle]] and Charles Jason Earle. He also had one stepdaughter, Nikki Leigh Rowling, and three grandchildren.\n\n===Career as the District Attorney===\nThe Travis County District Attorney's office investigates and prosecutes crimes related to the operation of the Texas state government. Earle was elected as a Democrat in the city of [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. He was, and his successor now is, the only Democrat with statewide prosecutorial authority. During his tenure, Earle prosecuted a variety of elected officials from both sides of the aisle, often dismissing accusations of partisanship by pointing out that prosecutions tend to focus on officials in power. He prosecuted Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox, a Democrat; United States Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican; and - in his most high-profile case - United States House Majority Leader, Congressman Tom Delay, a Republican. Mattox was acquitted by a jury, Hutchison's case was dismissed, and DeLay was found guilty of money laundering, but his case was later overturned on appeal by the Republican-dominated Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.<ref>https://www.statesman.com/news/20200405/breaking-former-travis-county-da-ronnie-earle-has-died</ref>\n\nWhile his high-profile prosecutions of elected officials garnered the most press attention, it was Earle's work in criminal justice reform that was his primary focus. He was an early champion of reforms that, in his words, were \u201cengaging the community in its own protection.\u201d Earle's innovations focused on crime prevention, alternative sentencing, victim advocacy, and the reintegration of former offenders into society. He spoke nationally on this work, and engaged in criminal justice reform efforts until his death. \n\nIn late 2007, Earle announced that he would not seek reelection to his post. His departure precipitated a race to fill his seat. Four Democrats, all employees of his office, ran for the seat. In the [[primary election]] held on March 4, 2008, no candidate received 50 percent of the vote. A [[runoff election]] was held between the top two finishers, and [[Rosemary Lehmberg]] \u2013 whom Earle had endorsed \u2013 won handily. She faced no Republican opponent in the general election. She took office in January 2009 and is the first woman district attorney in Travis County history.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nIn 2010, Earle ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Texas, using the campaign to promote his criminal justice reform agenda.\n\n===Later Life===\nEarle retired in Austin and remained active in criminal justice reform efforts. He died in Austin, Texas on April 5, 2020 after a long illness.<ref>https://www.statesman.com/news/20200405/breaking-former-travis-county-da-ronnie-earle-has-died</ref>\n\n==Major Public Integrity Investigations Conducted by Earle==\nThrough the Travis County Public Integrity Unit, Earle prosecuted [[politician]]s, including [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]],  United States House Majority Leader [[Tom Delay]], Texas State Representative [[Mike Martin (politician)|Mike Martin]], and Texas Attorney General [[Jim Mattox]].<ref>https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2008-04-11/610888/</ref> Defendants often accused Earle of partisanship, which he dismissed by pointing out that the prosecuted those in power, and that the bulk of prosecutions during his career had been brought against fellow Democrats.\n\n===Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Yarbrough===\nIn 1978, Earle accused Texas Supreme Court Justice Don Yarbrough, a Democrat, of forgery, aggravated perjury, and failure to appear. \n\n===Travis County Commissioner Bob Honts===-\nIn 1979, he accused Travis County Commissioner Bob Honts, a Democrat, of official misconduct and bribery. Commissioner Honts pled guilty to a misdemeanor, \"misapplying county property\", in 1984. He was ordered to pay a $2,000 fine.\n\n===Texas State Senator Gene Jones===\nIn 1980, Earle accused Texas State Senator Eugene 'Gene' Jones, a Democrat from Houston, of using a state computer to prepare campaign mailings. Jones pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge of official misconduct, paid $2,000 fine and $10,000 in restitution.\n\n===Indictment of State Rep. Mike Martin===\nOn July 31, 1981 during the First Called Session of the Sixty-seventh Texas Legislature, Republican Representative [[Mike Martin (politician)|Mike Martin]], a Republican then of [[Longview, Texas|Longview]], was shot in the left arm outside his trailer in Austin with 00-buckshot. Soon after the shooting, unidentified spokespeople from Earle's office released information to the ''Austin American Statesman'' that they felt Martin was telling inconsistent stories to the police. They claimed he first said he had no idea who did it; later he said it was a [[Satanism|Satanic cult]]; in the end, he accused his political enemies. \n\nMartin responded to the leaks by saying he was asked to give police all possibilities and said he had no idea why the district attorney's office would be saying such things. Earle personally made a public announcement that Martin was cooperating with police and that no one from his office was releasing information saying otherwise to ''The Statesman''. Earle formed a grand jury to look into the shooting of Martin and invited him to attend without issuing a subpoena.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nMartin refused to appear by issuing a statement that he had already given officials all the information he knew. Gregg County District Attorney Rob Foster shortly arrested Martin on a three-year-old [[assault]] charge. The charge was immediately dismissed due to time limits and lack of evidence. Upon release, Martin appeared before reporters and accused Gregg County officials of using their offices to ruin him politically. The day after his release on the assault charge, Martin voluntarily appeared before Earle's grand jury.\n\nAt the time he didn't know that his first cousin, Charles Goff, had previously appeared before the grand jury and admitted helping Martin stage the event to advance Martin's political career. He claimed Martin offered him a state job as payment, despite Texas' strong [[nepotism]] laws forbidding the hiring of relatives. Goff had served prison time and had three outstanding felony warrants pending at the time of his testimony; however, the grand jury took his word over Martin's. After Martin's denial of Goff's accusations before the grand jury, Earle filed felony perjury charges against the freshman legislator. Martin pleaded not guilty and, a year later, worked out a [[plea bargain]] with Earle by admitting to [[misdemeanor]] perjury charges relating to the renting of a car around the time of the shooting. Martin resigned his House seat on April 22, 1982 and withdrew from the upcoming election. Martin filed several suits against Earle, Foster, and Goff for civil rights violations. A federal judge dismissed the last case in June 1985 on grounds that prosecutors enjoy [[qualified immunity]] from [[civil lawsuit|civil suits]]. Martin maintains his innocence regarding Earle's charges.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Texas State Treasurer Warren G. Harding===\nIn 1981, Texas State Treasurer Warren G. Harding, a Democrat, pled guilty to class A misdemeanor of official misconduct. He received a one year deferred adjudication, paid a $2,000 fine, and paid $2,000 in restitution.\n\n===Texas Speaker of the House Gib Lewis===\nIn 1983, the Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, Gib Lewis, a Democrat, pled guilty to a class B misdemeanor for failing to file his financial statement. He paid an $800 fine.\n\n===Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox===\nIn 1983, Earle accused then-Attorney General [[Jim Mattox]] of threatening Fulbright & Jaworski's municipal bond business unless one of their lawyers stopped trying to question his sister, Janice Mattox, about a bank loan. The loan was an issue in a lawsuit involving Mobil Oil Co. and [[Clinton Manges]], a South Texas oil man and rancher who financially supported Mattox, who was acquitted after a long trial.\n\n===San Antonio Voter Registrar Marco Gomez===\nIn 1983, San Antonio Voter Registrar Marco Gomez, a Democrat pled guilty to charges of \"securing execution of document by deception and tampering with a governmental record.\" He received 10 years probation, 90 days in the Travis County Jail, paid $49,994 in restitution, and paid a $2,000 fine.\n\n===Texas State Representative Charles Staniswallis===\nIn 1983, Texas State Representative Charles Staniswallis, A Republican, pled guilty to charges of theft and tampering with a governmental record. Staniswallis received 10 years probation, paid a $2,000 fine, and paid $8,976 in restitution.\n\n===Texas Speaker of the House Gib Lewis===\nIn 1992, the Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives, Gib Lewis, a Democrat, pled guilty to two counts of filing false financial statements. He paid a $1,000 fine on each count.\n\n===United States Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison===\nIn 1994, Earle filed charges against Senator [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]], a Republican then serving as [[Texas State Treasurer]], for tampering with physical evidence, tampering with a governmental record, and official misconduct. On the first day in court, following an evidentiary hearing in which it became clear that the judge would rule much of his evidence inadmissible, Earle attempted to drop the charges in order to regroup but the judge refused to allow it, [[directed verdict|instructing the jury]] to return a \"not guilty\" verdict so the [[double jeopardy|charge could not be brought]] against her again.<ref name=\"CSDeLay\"/> \n\n===Texas State Representative Betty Denton===\nIn 1995, Texas State Representative Betty Denton, a Democrat, pled guilty to misdemeanor charges of perjury. She received six months deferred adjudication and paid a $2,000 fine.\n\n===Lane Denton===\nIn 1995, Lane Denton, a Democrat and the executive director of the Department of Public Safety Officers' Assoc\u00adi\u00ada\u00adtion was found guilty of second degree theft (a felony) and misapplication of fiduciary property. He was ordered to pay $67,201 in restitution along with a $12,000 fine. Additionally, he was sentenced to 10 years of probation, 60 days in jail, and 240 hours of community service.\n\n===Texas State Representative Gilbert Serna===\nIn 2000, Texas State Representative Gilbert Serna, a Democrat, pled guilty to multiple charges of theft by public servant. He was placed on probation for 10 years, was sentenced to 90 days in jail, and was required to pay a $3,000 fine along with restitution of more than $13,000.\n===Investigation and Indictment of Tom DeLay===\nFor over two years, Earle and eight separate grand juries investigated possible violations of Texas campaign finance law in the 2002 state legislative election. Earle denies that his pursuit of DeLay was part of a partisan \"[[fishing expedition]]\". His investigation of two political action committees that spent a combined $3.4 million on 22 Republican Texas House races focused on a [[political action committee]] founded by DeLay, (Texans for a Republican Majority PAC). During the investigation, DeLay charged that Earle was a \"runaway district attorney\" with \"a long history of being vindictive and partisan\". On September 28, 2005, a grand jury indicted DeLay for conspiring to violate Texas state election law. Texas prohibits corporate contributions in state legislative races. The indictment charged that [[Texans for a Republican Majority]], DeLay's PAC, accepted corporate contributions, [[money laundering|laundered the money]] through the [[Republican National Committee]], and directed it to favored Republican candidates in Texas. The presiding judge in the case, [[Pat Priest (judge)|Pat Priest]], a Democrat, eventually threw out the charge and the Court of Criminals Appeals upheld this decision in 2007.<ref name=\"court throws out DeLay charge\">{{cite news|url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/legislature/entries/2007/06/27/high_court_upholds_dismissal_of_indictment_against_delay.html|title=High Court Upholds Dismissal of Indictment Against DeLay|publisher=[[Austin American Statesman]]|date=June 27, 2007|first=Laylan|last=Copelin|accessdate=2008-07-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830004330/http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/legislature/entries/2007/06/27/high_court_upholds_dismissal_of_indictment_against_delay.html|archivedate=August 30, 2008}}</ref>\n\nEarle's second attempt to secure indictments against DeLay failed.

DeLay's lawyers asserted the indictment was flawed legally, as laundered money is defined in the Texas Penal Code as money gained in the ''\"proceeds of criminal activity\"''. DeLay's defense stressed that corporate donations to political campaigns are a normal, legal business activity. Due to a House rule requiring a party leader to step down if indicted, the indictment required DeLay to resign as Majority Leader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/robertnovak/2005/10/03/criminalizing_politics/page/full|last=Novak|first=Robert|title=Criminalizing politics|work=Townhall Magazine|date=October 3, 2005|accessdate=2013-12-15}}</ref> In a counter complaint, DeLay's attorney, [[Dick DeGuerin]], filed a motion against DA Earle, charging him with [[prosecutorial misconduct]] in the DeLay indictment.

Earle's evidence rested on an alleged confession by Murray, obtained by interrogation at a children's shelter in the absence of any attorney or family member. Murray's case provoked several public protests of Earle's office and at the Texas State Capitol from her detention in 1996 until her release in 1999, when the case was reviewed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2003-12-12/naked-city/|title=Naked City: Lacresha Murray suit proceeds|last=Smith|first=Jordan|date=2003-12-12|work=The Austin Chronicle|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nMurray was again tried and convicted of intentional injury to a child, receiving a 25-year sentence. In 2001, the Texas 3rd Court of Appeals reversed and remanded her sentence after finding that her confession was illegally obtained. Furthermore, a liver tissue examination by a pathologist expert in the field showed that the injury was inflicted hours before and thus not by Murray; and clothes worn by the toddler had no blood traces that were inevitable given the injuries\u2014indicating the clothes were changed after the toddler was beaten.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2000-11-03/79252/|title=Naked City: Murray's Law|last=Smith|first=Amy|date=2000-11-03|work=The Austin Chronicle|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nFaced with the evidence Earle eventually dropped all charges against Murray. In 2002, a suit was filed against the Travis County District Attorney's Office and a host of other individuals and various agencies, which alleged the Murray family had been victimized by [[malicious prosecution]], [[defamation]], [[libel]] and [[slander]], and had suffered mental anguish. Charges of racism were also raised in the suit, suggesting that the Murray family would have been treated differently had they been white. Murray's suit was dismissed; on November 28, 2005, the [[US Supreme Court]] refused to revive the lawsuit.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n===Maurice Pierce Case===\nOn December 6, 1991, four teenage girls were murdered inside a local yogurt shop in Austin. In 1999, Earle led the \"[[Yogurt Shop Murders]]\" case against suspect Maurice Pierce, leading to a grand jury indicting him on four counts of first degree murder. Pierce was arrested, along with Robert Springsteen IV, Michael Scott, and Forrest Welborn, for the murders of four girls. Springsteen and Scott eventually confessed to the crime. Springsteen was convicted and [[death penalty|sentenced to death]]. Scott was convicted and sentenced to [[life in prison]].\n\nWelborn was never indicted for the crime. Pierce continually maintained his innocence up until his release, occurring three years after his arrest.

It has been amended numerous times over the years. It was originally found in [[Title 50 of the United States Code|Title 50]] of the U.S. Code (War) but is now found under Title 18, Crime. Specifically, it is {{Usc-title-chap|18|37}} ({{UnitedStatesCode|18|792}} et seq.)\n\nIt was intended to prohibit interference with [[military operation]]s or [[Military recruitment|recruitment]], to prevent insubordination in the military, and to prevent the support of United States enemies during wartime. In 1919, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] unanimously ruled through ''[[Schenck v. United States]]'' that the act did not violate the [[freedom of speech]] of those convicted under its provisions. The [[constitutionality]] of the law, its relationship to free speech, and the meaning of its language have been contested in court ever since.\n\nAmong those charged with offenses under the Act are German-American socialist congressman and newspaper editor [[Victor L. Berger]], labor leader and five-time [[Socialist Party of America]] candidate, [[Eugene V. Debs]], [[Anarchism|anarchists]] [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]], former [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society]] president [[Joseph Franklin Rutherford]], communists [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]], ''[[Pentagon Papers]]'' [[whistleblower]] [[Daniel Ellsberg]], [[United States diplomatic cables leak|Cablegate]] whistleblower [[Chelsea Manning]], [[WikiLeaks]] founder [[Julian Assange]], [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] employee [[Henry Kyle Frese]], and [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) contractor and whistleblower [[Edward Snowden]]. Rutherford's conviction was overturned on appeal.<ref>Rogerson, Alan (1969), ''Millions Now Living Will Never Die'', Constable, London, {{ISBN|0-09-455940-6}}, full text at [https://archive.org/stream/MillionsNowLivingWillNeverDieRogerson/Millions_Now_Living_Rogerson_djvu.txt]</ref> Although the most controversial sections of the Act, a set of amendments commonly called the [[Sedition Act of 1918]], were repealed on March 3, 1921, the original Espionage Act was left intact.<ref>Vaughn, Stephen L. (ed.) (2007), ''Encyclopedia of American Journalism'', Routledge, London, {{ISBN|0415969506}}, p. 155.</ref>\n\n==Enactment==\nThe Espionage Act of 1917 was passed, along with the [[Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917|Trading with the Enemy ooojfoadkjf lksd;flkjldkj, just after the United States entered World War I in April 1917. It was based on the [[Defense Secrets Act of 1911]], especially the notions of obtaining or delivering information relating to \"national defense\" to a person who was not \"entitled to have it\", itself based on an earlier British [[Official Secrets Act]]. The Espionage Act law imposed much stiffer penalties than the 1911 law, including the death penalty.<ref name=eric1/>\n\nPresident [[Woodrow Wilson]], in his December 7, 1915 [[State of the Union]] address, asked Congress for the legislation:<ref>Moynihan, ''Secrecy''. 89</ref>\n{{quote|There are citizens of the United States, I blush to admit, born under other flags but welcomed under our generous naturalization laws to the full freedom and opportunity of America, who have poured the poison of disloyalty into the very arteries of our national life; who have sought to bring the authority and good name of our Government into contempt, to destroy our industries wherever they thought it effective for their vindictive purposes to strike at them, and to debase our politics to the uses of foreign intrigue&nbsp;...\n\nI urge you to enact such laws at the earliest possible moment and feel that in doing so I am urging you to do nothing less than save the honor and self-respect of the nation. Such creatures of passion, disloyalty, and anarchy must be crushed out. They are not many, but they are infinitely malignant, and the hand of our power should close over them at once. They have formed plots to destroy property, they have entered into conspiracies against the neutrality of the Government, they have sought to pry into every confidential transaction of the Government in order to serve interests alien to our own. It is possible to deal with these things very effectually. I need not suggest the terms in which they may be dealt with.}}\n\nCongress moved slowly. Even after the U.S. broke diplomatic relations with Germany, when the Senate passed a version on February 20, 1917, the House did not vote before the then-current session of Congress ended. After the declaration of war in April 1917, both houses debated versions of the Wilson administration's drafts that included press censorship.<ref>Moynihan, ''Secrecy'', 90\u201392</ref> That provision aroused opposition, with critics charging it established a system of \"[[prior restraint]]\" and delegated unlimited power to the president.<ref>Harold Edgar and Benno C. Schmidt Jr., \"The Espionage Statutes and the Publication of Defense Information\", ''Columbia Law Review''. v. 73. no. 5, May 1973, 950\u2013951</ref> After weeks of intermittent debate, the Senate removed the censorship provision by a one-vote margin, voting 39 to 38.<ref>Moynihan, ''Secrecy'', 92\u201395</ref> Wilson still insisted it was needed: \"Authority to exercise censorship over the press....is absolutely necessary to the public safety\", but signed the Act without the censorship provisions on June 15, 1917,<ref>Moynihan, ''Secrecy'', 96</ref> after Congress passed the act on the same day.<ref>{{cite web|title=History.com: This Day in History \u2014 June 15, 1917: U.S. Congress passes Espionage Act|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/us-congress-passes-espionage-act|publisher=History.com|accessdate=29 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313041013/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/us-congress-passes-espionage-act|archive-date=2013-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAttorney General [[Thomas Watt Gregory]] supported passage of the act, but viewed it as a compromise. The President's Congressional rivals were proposing to remove responsibility for monitoring pro-German activity, whether espionage or some form of disloyalty, from the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] to the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] and creating a form of courts-martial of doubtful constitutionality.

This was punishable by death or by imprisonment for not more than 30 years or both.\n* To convey false reports or false statements with intent to interfere with the operation or success of the military or naval forces of the United States or to promote the success of its enemies when the United States is at war, to cause or attempt to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, refusal of duty, in the military or naval forces of the United States, or to willfully obstruct the recruiting or enlistment service of the United States. This was punishable by a maximum fine of $10,000 or by imprisonment for not more than 20 years or both.\n\nThe Act also gave the [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] authority to impound or to refuse to mail publications that he determined to be in violation of its prohibitions.<ref>Ann Hagedorn, ''Savage Peace: Hope and Fear in America, 1919'' (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2007), 29</ref>\n\nThe Act also forbids the transfer of any naval vessel equipped for combat to any nation engaged in a conflict in which the United States is neutral. Seemingly uncontroversial when the Act was passed, this later became a legal stumbling block for the administration of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], when he sought to provide military aid to Great Britain before the United States entered [[World War II]].<ref>Jean Edward Smith, ''FDR'' (New York: Random House, 2007), 467, 755n54</ref>\n\n===Amendments===\n{{main|Sedition Act of 1918}}\nThe law was extended on May 16, 1918, by the Sedition Act of 1918, actually a set of amendments to the Espionage Act, which prohibited many forms of speech, including \"any disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language about the form of government of the United States&nbsp;... or the flag of the United States, or the uniform of the Army or Navy\".<ref name=Kennedy80 />\n\nBecause the Sedition Act was an informal name, court cases were brought under the name of the Espionage Act, whether the charges were based on the provisions of the Espionage Act or the provisions of the amendments known informally as the Sedition Act.\n\nOn March 3, 1921, the Sedition Act amendments were repealed, but many provisions of the Espionage Act remain, codified under [[United States Code|U.S.C.]] Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 37.<ref>Cornell Law School: [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sup_01_18_10_I_20_37.html Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 37], accessed December 4, 2010</ref>\n\nIn 1933, after signals intelligence expert [[Herbert Yardley]] published a popular book about breaking Japanese codes, the Act was amended to prohibit the disclosure of foreign code or anything sent in code.<ref>Moynihan, ''Secrecy'', 97; Herbert Yardley, ''The American Black Chamber'' (Bobbs-Merrill, 1931)</ref> The Act was amended in 1940 to increase the penalties it imposed, and again in 1970.<ref>C.

Most enforcement activity occurred in the Western states where the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] was active.<ref>Kennedy, ''Over Here'', 83</ref> Finally Gregory, a few weeks before the end of the war, instructed the U.S. Attorneys not to act without his approval.\n\nA year after the Act's passage, [[Eugene V. Debs]], [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] presidential candidate in 1904, 1908, and 1912 was arrested and sentenced to 10 years in prison for making a speech that \"obstructed recruiting\".

The producer, Robert Goldstein, a Jew of German origins, was prosecuted under Title XI of the Act, and received a ten-year sentence plus a fine of $5000.

Burleson]] and those in his department played critical roles in the enforcement of the Act. He held his position because he was a Democratic party loyalist and close to both the President and the Attorney General. At a time when the Department of Justice numbered its investigators in the dozens, the Post Office had a nationwide network in place. The day after the Act became law, Burleson sent a secret memo to all postmasters ordering them to keep \"close watch on&nbsp;... matter which is calculated to interfere with the success of ... the government in conducting the war\".<ref>Christopher Cappozolla, ''Uncle Sam Wants You: World War I and the Making of the Modern American Citizen'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2008), 151\u2013152</ref> Postmasters in [[Savannah, Georgia]], and [[Tampa, Florida]], refused to mail the ''Jeffersonian'', the mouthpiece of [[Thomas E.

According to the book ''Preachers Present Arms'' by Ray H.

Although Supreme Court Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] joined the Court majority in upholding Schenck's conviction in 1919, he also introduced the theory that punishment in such cases must be limited to such political expression that constitutes a \"[[clear and present danger]]\" to the government action at issue. Holmes' opinion is the origin of the notion that speech equivalent to \"falsely [[shouting fire in a crowded theater]]\" is not protected by the First Amendment.\n\nJustice Holmes began to doubt his decision due to criticism from free speech advocates.

The concept of [[bad tendency]] was used to justify the restriction of speech. The defendant was deported. Justices Holmes and Brandeis, however, dissented, with Holmes arguing that \"nobody can suppose that the surreptitious publishing of a silly leaflet by an unknown man, without more, would present any immediate danger that its opinions would hinder the success of the government arms or have any appreciable tendency to do so.\"<ref name=fenan/><ref>William E.

Associate Justice [[Frank Murphy]] noted in 1944 in ''Hartzel v. United States'' that \"For the first time during the course of the present war, we are confronted with a prosecution under the Espionage Act of 1917.\" Hartzel, a World War I veteran, had distributed anti-war pamphlets to associations and business groups. The court's majority found that his materials, though comprising \"vicious and unreasoning attacks on one of our military allies, flagrant appeals to false and sinister racial theories, and gross libels of the President\", did not urge mutiny or any of the other specific actions detailed in the Act, and that he had targeted molders of public opinion, not members of the armed forces or potential military recruits. The court overturned his conviction in a 5\u20134 decision. The four dissenting justices declined to \"intrude on the historic function of the jury\" and would have upheld the conviction.<ref>U.S. Supreme Court Center: [http://supreme.justia.com/us/322/680/case.html ''Hartzel v.

It was part of Attorney General [[Francis Biddle]]'s attempt to close down what he called \"vermin publications\". Coughlin had been criticized for virulently anti-Semitic writings.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mails Barred to \"Social Justice\" |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&dat=19420415&id=SzsNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2530,6670133|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania |date=15 April 1942 |pages=1\u20132 |accessdate=1 January 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Stone |first=Goeffrey R. |year=2004 |title=Free Speech in World War II: When are you going to indict the seditionists? |journal=International Journal of Constitutional Law|volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=334\u2013367 |doi=10.1093/icon/2.2.334 }}</ref><ref name=\"timecom1942\">\n{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,849845,00.html |title=The Press: Coughlin Quits |date=1942-05-18 |accessdate=2011-03-13 |journal=Time}}</ref>\n\nThe same year, a [[Japanese naval codes#1942 Chicago Tribune incident|June front-page story]] by [[Stanley Johnston]] in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', headlined \"Navy Had Word of Jap Plan to Strike at Sea\", implied that the Americans had broken the Japanese codes before the [[Battle of Midway]]. The story resulted in the Japanese changing their codebooks and callsign systems. The newspaper publishers were brought before a [[grand jury]] for possible indictment, but proceedings were halted because of government reluctance to present a jury with the highly secret information necessary to prosecute the publishers, as well as concern that a trial would attract more attention to the case.<ref name=comm1/><ref>{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Michael | authorlink = Michael Smith (newspaper reporter) | title = The Emperor's Codes: Bletchley Park and the breaking of Japan's secret ciphers | publisher = Bantam Press | date = 2000 | location = London | pages = 142, 143 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0593-046412 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1945, six associates of ''[[Amerasia]]'' magazine, a journal of Far Eastern affairs, came under suspicion after publishing articles that bore similarity to [[Office of Strategic Services]] reports. The government proposed using the Espionage Act against them but later softened its approach, changing the charges to Embezzlement of Government Property (now {{UnitedStatesCodeSub|18|641}}). A grand jury cleared three of the associates, two associates paid small fines, and charges against the sixth man were dropped. Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] said the failure to aggressively prosecute the defendants was a communist conspiracy. According to Kleht and Radosh, the case helped build his later notoriety.<ref name=amerasia/>\n\n===Mid-20th century Soviet spies===\nNavy employee Hafis Salich sold Soviet agent Mihail Gorin information regarding Japanese activities in the late 1930s. ''[[Gorin v. United States]]'' (1941) was cited in many later espionage cases for its discussion of the charge of \"vagueness\", an argument made against the terminology used in certain portions of the law, such as what constitutes \"national defense\" information.\n\nLater in the 1940s, several incidents prompted the government to increase its investigations into Soviet espionage. These included the [[Venona project]] decryptions, the [[Elizabeth Bentley]] case, the [[atomic spies]] cases, the [[RDS-1|First Lightning]] Soviet nuclear test, and others. Many suspects were surveilled, but never prosecuted. These investigations were dropped, as can be seen in the [[FBI Silvermaster File]]s. There were also many successful prosecutions and convictions under the Act.\n\nIn August 1950, [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]] were indicted under Title 50, sections 32a and 34, in connection with giving nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union. [[Anatoli Yatskov|Anatoli Yakovlev]] was indicted as well. In 1951, [[Morton Sobell]] and [[David Greenglass]] were indicted. After a controversial trial in 1951, the Rosenbergs were sentenced to death. They were executed in 1953, making their two sons orphans. The boys were adopted by another family.<ref name=doug_linder/><ref name=fbirosenberg/><ref name=eyespy_rosenb/> In the late 1950s, several members of the [[Soviet espionage in the United States#Soble spy ring|Soble spy ring]], including [[Robert Soblen]], and [[Jack Soble|Jack]] and [[Myra Soble]], were prosecuted for espionage. In the mid-1960s, the act was used against James Mintkenbaugh and [[Robert Lee Johnson (spy)|Robert Lee Johnson]], who sold information to the Soviets while working for the U.S. Army in Berlin.<ref name=\"time.com1962\"/><ref name=\"time.com1965\"/>\n\n===1948 code revision===\nIn 1948, some portions of the [[United States Code]] were reorganized. Much of Title 50 (War and National Defense) was moved to [[Title 18 of the United States Code|Title 18]] (Crimes and Criminal Procedure). Thus Title 50 Chapter 4, Espionage, (Sections 31\u201339), became Title 18, 794 and following. As a result, certain older cases, such as the [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg|Rosenberg]] case, are now listed under Title 50, while newer cases are often listed under Title 18.<ref name=doug_linder/><ref name=\"uscode.house.gov\"/>\n\n===1950 McCarran Internal Security Act===\nIn 1950, during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy Period]], Congress passed the [[McCarran Internal Security Act]] over President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s veto. It modified a large body of law, including espionage law. One addition was {{USCSub2|18|793|e}}, which had almost exactly the same language as {{USCSub2|18|793|d}}. According to Edgar and Schmidt, the added section potentially removes the \"intent\" to harm or aid requirement and may make \"mere retention\" of information a crime no matter what the intent, covering even former government officials writing their memoirs. They also describe McCarran saying that this portion was intended directly to respond to the case of [[Alger Hiss]] and the \"[[Whittaker Chambers#\"Pumpkin Papers\"|Pumpkin Papers]]\".<ref name=edgsch/><ref name=ford_appeal1/><ref name=nyt_v_us1/>\n\n===Judicial review, 1960s and 1970s===\n\n====Brandenburg====\n{{Main|Brandenburg v. Ohio}}\nCourt decisions of this era changed the standard for enforcing some provisions of the Espionage Act. Though not a case involving charges under the Act, ''Brandenburg v. Ohio'' (1969) changed the \"clear and present danger\" test derived from ''Schenck'' to the \"[[imminent lawless action]]\" test, a considerably stricter test of the inflammatory nature of speech.<ref>{{ussc|name=Brandenburg v.

United States}}\nIn June 1971, [[Daniel Ellsberg]] and [[Anthony Russo (whistleblower)|Anthony Russo]] were charged with a [[felony]] under the Espionage Act of 1917, because they lacked legal authority to publish classified documents that came to be known as the ''[[Pentagon Papers]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Pentagon Papers Case|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB48/nixon.html|accessdate=2005-12-05}}</ref> The Supreme Court in ''New York Times Co. v. United States'' found that the government had not made a successful case for prior restraint of Free Speech, but a majority of the justices ruled that the government could still prosecute the ''Times'' and the ''Post'' for violating the Espionage Act in publishing the documents. Ellsberg and Russo were not acquitted of violating the Espionage Act, but were freed due to a mistrial based on irregularities in the government's case.<ref>Correll, John T. \"[http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2007/February%202007/0207pentagon.aspx The Pentagon Papers]\" ''Air Force Magazine'', February 2007.</ref>\n\nThe divided Supreme Court had denied the government's request to restrain the press. In their opinions the justices expressed varying degrees of support for the First Amendment claims of the press against the government's \"heavy burden of proof\" in establishing that the publisher \"has reason to believe\" the material published \"could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation\".{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nThe case prompted Harold Edgar and Benno C. Schmidt Jr. to write an article on espionage law in the 1973 ''Columbia Law Review''. Their article was entitled \"The Espionage Statutes and Publication of Defense Information\". Essentially they found the law to be poorly written and vague, with parts of it probably unconstitutional. Their article became widely cited in books and in future court arguments on Espionage cases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/library/|title=Secrecy and Security Library|website=fas.org}}</ref>\n\n''United States v. Dedeyan'' in 1978 was the first prosecution under {{USCSub2|18|793|f|2}} (Dedeyan 'failed to report' that information had been disclosed). The courts relied on ''[[Gorin v. United States]]'' (1941) for precedent. The ruling touched on several constitutional questions including vagueness of the law and whether the information was \"related to national defense\". The defendant received a 3-year sentence.<ref>[http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/584/36/155427/ ''U.S. v Dedeyan''] 1978</ref><ref name=roswei1/>\n\nIn 1979\u201380, Truong Dinh Hung (aka [[David Truong]]) and [[Ronald Humphrey|Ronald Louis Humphrey]] were convicted under 793(a), (c), and (e) as well as several other laws. The ruling discussed several constitutional questions regarding espionage law, \"vagueness\", the difference between [[classified information]] and \"national defense information\", wiretapping and the Fourth Amendment. It also commented on the notion of bad faith ([[scienter]]) being a requirement for conviction even under 793(e); an \"honest mistake\" was said not to be a violation.<ref name=roswei1/><ref>[http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/629/908/266362/ U.S. v.

It has been amended numerous times over the years. It was originally found in [[Title 50 of the United States Code|Title 50]] of the U.S. Code (War) but is now found under Title 18, Crime. Specifically, it is {{Usc-title-chap|18|37}} ({{UnitedStatesCode|18|792}} et seq.)\n\nIt was intended to prohibit interference with [[military operation]]s or [[Military recruitment|recruitment]], to prevent insubordination in the military, and to prevent the support of United States enemies during wartime. In 1919, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] unanimously ruled through ''[[Schenck v. United States]]'' that the act did not violate the [[freedom of speech]] of those convicted under its provisions. The [[constitutionality]] of the law, its relationship to free speech, and the meaning of its language have been contested in court ever since.\n\nAmong those charged with offenses under the Act are German-American socialist congressman and newspaper editor [[Victor L. Berger]], labor leader and five-time [[Socialist Party of America]] candidate, [[Eugene V. Debs]], [[Anarchism|anarchists]] [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]], former [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society]] president [[Joseph Franklin Rutherford]], communists [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]], ''[[Pentagon Papers]]'' [[whistleblower]] [[Daniel Ellsberg]], [[United States diplomatic cables leak|Cablegate]] whistleblower [[Chelsea Manning]], [[WikiLeaks]] founder [[Julian Assange]], [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] employee [[Henry Kyle Frese]], and [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) contractor and whistleblower [[Edward Snowden]]. Rutherford's conviction was overturned on appeal.<ref>Rogerson, Alan (1969), ''Millions Now Living Will Never Die'', Constable, London, {{ISBN|0-09-455940-6}}, full text at [https://archive.org/stream/MillionsNowLivingWillNeverDieRogerson/Millions_Now_Living_Rogerson_djvu.txt]</ref> Although the most controversial sections of the Act, a set of amendments commonly called the [[Sedition Act of 1918]], were repealed on March 3, 1921, the original Espionage Act was left intact.<ref>Vaughn, Stephen L. (ed.) (2007), ''Encyclopedia of American Journalism'', Routledge, London, {{ISBN|0415969506}}, p. 155.</ref>\n\n==Enactment==\nThe Espionage Act of 1917 was passed, along with the [[Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917|Trading with the Enemy Act]], just after the United States entered World War I in April 1917. It was based on the [[Defense Secrets Act of 1911]], especially the notions of obtaining or delivering information relating to \"national defense\" to a person who was not \"entitled to have it\", itself based on an earlier British [[Official Secrets Act]]. The Espionage Act law imposed much stiffer penalties than the 1911 law, including the death penalty.<ref name=eric1/>\n\nPresident [[Woodrow Wilson]], in his December 7, 1915 [[State of the Union]] address, asked Congress for the legislation:<ref>Moynihan, ''Secrecy''. 89</ref>\n{{quote|There are citizens of the United States, I blush to admit, born under other flags but welcomed under our generous naturalization laws to the full freedom and opportunity of America, who have poured the poison of disloyalty into the very arteries of our national life; who have sought to bring the authority and good name of our Government into contempt, to destroy our industries wherever they thought it effective for their vindictive purposes to strike at them, and to debase our politics to the uses of foreign intrigue&nbsp;...\n\nI urge you to enact such laws at the earliest possible moment and feel that in doing so I am urging you to do nothing less than save the honor and self-respect of the nation. Such creatures of passion, disloyalty, and anarchy must be crushed out. They are not many, but they are infinitely malignant, and the hand of our power should close over them at once. They have formed plots to destroy property, they have entered into conspiracies against the neutrality of the Government, they have sought to pry into every confidential transaction of the Government in order to serve interests alien to our own. It is possible to deal with these things very effectually. I need not suggest the terms in which they may be dealt with.}}\n\nCongress moved slowly. Even after the U.S. broke diplomatic relations with Germany, when the Senate passed a version on February 20, 1917, the House did not vote before the then-current session of Congress ended. After the declaration of war in April 1917, both houses debated versions of the Wilson administration's drafts that included press censorship.<ref>Moynihan, ''Secrecy'', 90\u201392</ref> That provision aroused opposition, with critics charging it established a system of \"[[prior restraint]]\" and delegated unlimited power to the president.<ref>Harold Edgar and Benno C. Schmidt Jr., \"The Espionage Statutes and the Publication of Defense Information\", ''Columbia Law Review''. v. 73. no. 5, May 1973, 950\u2013951</ref> After weeks of intermittent debate, the Senate removed the censorship provision by a one-vote margin, voting 39 to 38.<ref>Moynihan, ''Secrecy'', 92\u201395</ref> Wilson still insisted it was needed: \"Authority to exercise censorship over the press....is absolutely necessary to the public safety\", but signed the Act without the censorship provisions on June 15, 1917,<ref>Moynihan, ''Secrecy'', 96</ref> after Congress passed the act on the same day.<ref>{{cite web|title=History.com: This Day in History \u2014 June 15, 1917: U.S. Congress passes Espionage Act|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/us-congress-passes-espionage-act|publisher=History.com|accessdate=29 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313041013/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/us-congress-passes-espionage-act|archive-date=2013-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAttorney General [[Thomas Watt Gregory]] supported passage of the act, but viewed it as a compromise. The President's Congressional rivals were proposing to remove responsibility for monitoring pro-German activity, whether espionage or some form of disloyalty, from the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] to the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] and creating a form of courts-martial of doubtful constitutionality. The resulting Act was far more aggressive and restrictive than they wanted, but it silenced citizens opposed to the war.<ref name=Kennedy80>{{cite book |author=David M. Kennedy |author-link=David M.

This was punishable by death or by imprisonment for not more than 30 years or both.\n* To convey false reports or false statements with intent to interfere with the operation or success of the military or naval forces of the United States or to promote the success of its enemies when the United States is at war, to cause or attempt to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, refusal of duty, in the military or naval forces of the United States, or to willfully obstruct the recruiting or enlistment service of the United States. This was punishable by a maximum fine of $10,000 or by imprisonment for not more than 20 years or both.\n\nThe Act also gave the [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] authority to impound or to refuse to mail publications that he determined to be in violation of its prohibitions.<ref>Ann Hagedorn, ''Savage Peace: Hope and Fear in America, 1919'' (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2007), 29</ref>\n\nThe Act also forbids the transfer of any naval vessel equipped for combat to any nation engaged in a conflict in which the United States is neutral. Seemingly uncontroversial when the Act was passed, this later became a legal stumbling block for the administration of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], when he sought to provide military aid to Great Britain before the United States entered [[World War II]].<ref>Jean Edward Smith, ''FDR'' (New York: Random House, 2007), 467, 755n54</ref>\n\n===Amendments===\n{{main|Sedition Act of 1918}}\nThe law was extended on May 16, 1918, by the Sedition Act of 1918, actually a set of amendments to the Espionage Act, which prohibited many forms of speech, including \"any disloyal, profane, scurrilous, or abusive language about the form of government of the United States&nbsp;... or the flag of the United States, or the uniform of the Army or Navy\".<ref name=Kennedy80 />\n\nBecause the Sedition Act was an informal name, court cases were brought under the name of the Espionage Act, whether the charges were based on the provisions of the Espionage Act or the provisions of the amendments known informally as the Sedition Act.\n\nOn March 3, 1921, the Sedition Act amendments were repealed, but many provisions of the Espionage Act remain, codified under [[United States Code|U.S.C.]] Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 37.<ref>Cornell Law School: [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sup_01_18_10_I_20_37.html Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 37], accessed December 4, 2010</ref>\n\nIn 1933, after signals intelligence expert [[Herbert Yardley]] published a popular book about breaking Japanese codes, the Act was amended to prohibit the disclosure of foreign code or anything sent in code.<ref>Moynihan, ''Secrecy'', 97; Herbert Yardley, ''The American Black Chamber'' (Bobbs-Merrill, 1931)</ref> The Act was amended in 1940 to increase the penalties it imposed, and again in 1970.<ref>C.

Mitchell Palmer]], supported by [[J. Edgar Hoover]], then head of the Justice Department's Enemy Aliens Registration Section, prosecuted several hundred foreign-born known and suspected activists in the United States under the [[Sedition Act of 1918]]. This extended the Espionage Act to cover a broader range of offenses. After being convicted, persons including [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] were deported to the Soviet Union on a ship the press called the \"[[USAT Buford|Soviet Ark]]\".<ref name=eric1/><ref name=gmu1/><ref name=fenan/>\n\n[[File:Freedom of speech in war times.djvu|right|thumb|150px|page=6|A version of Chafee's \"Free Speech in War Times\", the work that helped change Justice Holmes' mind]]\nMany of the jailed had appealed their convictions based on the U.S. constitutional right to the freedom of speech. The Supreme Court disagreed. The Espionage Act limits on free speech were ruled constitutional in the U.S. Supreme Court case ''[[Schenck v. United States]]'' (1919).<ref>{{ussc|name=Schenck v. United States|volume=249|page=47|pin=|year=1919}}.</ref> Schenck, an anti-war Socialist, had been convicted of violating the Act when he sent anti-draft pamphlets to men eligible for the draft. Although Supreme Court Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] joined the Court majority in upholding Schenck's conviction in 1919, he also introduced the theory that punishment in such cases must be limited to such political expression that constitutes a \"[[clear and present danger]]\" to the government action at issue. Holmes' opinion is the origin of the notion that speech equivalent to \"falsely [[shouting fire in a crowded theater]]\" is not protected by the First Amendment.\n\nJustice Holmes began to doubt his decision due to criticism from free speech advocates. He also met the Harvard Law professor [[Zechariah Chafee]] and discussed his criticism of ''Schenck''.<ref name=fenan/><ref>Chafee's treatise ''Free Speech in the United States'' included a lengthy attack on the ''Schenck'' decision. Zechariah Chafee, ''Free Speech in the United States'' (New York: Harcourt, Brace; 1920)</ref>\n\nLater in 1919, in ''Abrams v. United States'', the Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a man who distributed circulars in opposition to American intervention in Russia following the [[Russian Revolution]]. The concept of [[bad tendency]] was used to justify the restriction of speech. The defendant was deported. Justices Holmes and Brandeis, however, dissented, with Holmes arguing that \"nobody can suppose that the surreptitious publishing of a silly leaflet by an unknown man, without more, would present any immediate danger that its opinions would hinder the success of the government arms or have any appreciable tendency to do so.\"<ref name=fenan/><ref>William E.

Associate Justice [[Frank Murphy]] noted in 1944 in ''Hartzel v. United States'' that \"For the first time during the course of the present war, we are confronted with a prosecution under the Espionage Act of 1917.\" Hartzel, a World War I veteran, had distributed anti-war pamphlets to associations and business groups. The court's majority found that his materials, though comprising \"vicious and unreasoning attacks on one of our military allies, flagrant appeals to false and sinister racial theories, and gross libels of the President\", did not urge mutiny or any of the other specific actions detailed in the Act, and that he had targeted molders of public opinion, not members of the armed forces or potential military recruits. The court overturned his conviction in a 5\u20134 decision. The four dissenting justices declined to \"intrude on the historic function of the jury\" and would have upheld the conviction.<ref>U.S. Supreme Court Center: [http://supreme.justia.com/us/322/680/case.html ''Hartzel v.

It was part of Attorney General [[Francis Biddle]]'s attempt to close down what he called \"vermin publications\". Coughlin had been criticized for virulently anti-Semitic writings.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mails Barred to \"Social Justice\" |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&dat=19420415&id=SzsNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2530,6670133|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania |date=15 April 1942 |pages=1\u20132 |accessdate=1 January 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Stone |first=Goeffrey R. |year=2004 |title=Free Speech in World War II: When are you going to indict the seditionists? |journal=International Journal of Constitutional Law|volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=334\u2013367 |doi=10.1093/icon/2.2.334 }}</ref><ref name=\"timecom1942\">\n{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,849845,00.html |title=The Press: Coughlin Quits |date=1942-05-18 |accessdate=2011-03-13 |journal=Time}}</ref>\n\nThe same year, a [[Japanese naval codes#1942 Chicago Tribune incident|June front-page story]] by [[Stanley Johnston]] in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', headlined \"Navy Had Word of Jap Plan to Strike at Sea\", implied that the Americans had broken the Japanese codes before the [[Battle of Midway]]. The story resulted in the Japanese changing their codebooks and callsign systems. The newspaper publishers were brought before a [[grand jury]] for possible indictment, but proceedings were halted because of government reluctance to present a jury with the highly secret information necessary to prosecute the publishers, as well as concern that a trial would attract more attention to the case.<ref name=comm1/><ref>{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Michael | authorlink = Michael Smith (newspaper reporter) | title = The Emperor's Codes: Bletchley Park and the breaking of Japan's secret ciphers | publisher = Bantam Press | date = 2000 | location = London | pages = 142, 143 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0593-046412 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1945, six associates of ''[[Amerasia]]'' magazine, a journal of Far Eastern affairs, came under suspicion after publishing articles that bore similarity to [[Office of Strategic Services]] reports. The government proposed using the Espionage Act against them but later softened its approach, changing the charges to Embezzlement of Government Property (now {{UnitedStatesCodeSub|18|641}}). A grand jury cleared three of the associates, two associates paid small fines, and charges against the sixth man were dropped. Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] said the failure to aggressively prosecute the defendants was a communist conspiracy. According to Kleht and Radosh, the case helped build his later notoriety.<ref name=amerasia/>\n\n===Mid-20th century Soviet spies===\nNavy employee Hafis Salich sold Soviet agent Mihail Gorin information regarding Japanese activities in the late 1930s. ''[[Gorin v. United States]]'' (1941) was cited in many later espionage cases for its discussion of the charge of \"vagueness\", an argument made against the terminology used in certain portions of the law, such as what constitutes \"national defense\" information.\n\nLater in the 1940s, several incidents prompted the government to increase its investigations into Soviet espionage. These included the [[Venona project]] decryptions, the [[Elizabeth Bentley]] case, the [[atomic spies]] cases, the [[RDS-1|First Lightning]] Soviet nuclear test, and others. Many suspects were surveilled, but never prosecuted. These investigations were dropped, as can be seen in the [[FBI Silvermaster File]]s. There were also many successful prosecutions and convictions under the Act.\n\nIn August 1950, [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]] were indicted under Title 50, sections 32a and 34, in connection with giving nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union. [[Anatoli Yatskov|Anatoli Yakovlev]] was indicted as well. In 1951, [[Morton Sobell]] and [[David Greenglass]] were indicted. After a controversial trial in 1951, the Rosenbergs were sentenced to death. They were executed in 1953, making their two sons orphans. The boys were adopted by another family.<ref name=doug_linder/><ref name=fbirosenberg/><ref name=eyespy_rosenb/> In the late 1950s, several members of the [[Soviet espionage in the United States#Soble spy ring|Soble spy ring]], including [[Robert Soblen]], and [[Jack Soble|Jack]] and [[Myra Soble]], were prosecuted for espionage.

Much of Title 50 (War and National Defense) was moved to [[Title 18 of the United States Code|Title 18]] (Crimes and Criminal Procedure). Thus Title 50 Chapter 4, Espionage, (Sections 31\u201339), became Title 18, 794 and following. As a result, certain older cases, such as the [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg|Rosenberg]] case, are now listed under Title 50, while newer cases are often listed under Title 18.<ref name=doug_linder/><ref name=\"uscode.house.gov\"/>\n\n===1950 McCarran Internal Security Act===\nIn 1950, during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy Period]], Congress passed the [[McCarran Internal Security Act]] over President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s veto. It modified a large body of law, including espionage law. One addition was {{USCSub2|18|793|e}}, which had almost exactly the same language as {{USCSub2|18|793|d}}. According to Edgar and Schmidt, the added section potentially removes the \"intent\" to harm or aid requirement and may make \"mere retention\" of information a crime no matter what the intent, covering even former government officials writing their memoirs. They also describe McCarran saying that this portion was intended directly to respond to the case of [[Alger Hiss]] and the \"[[Whittaker Chambers#\"Pumpkin Papers\"|Pumpkin Papers]]\".<ref name=edgsch/><ref name=ford_appeal1/><ref name=nyt_v_us1/>\n\n===Judicial review, 1960s and 1970s===\n\n====Brandenburg====\n{{Main|Brandenburg v.

United States'' found that the government had not made a successful case for prior restraint of Free Speech, but a majority of the justices ruled that the government could still prosecute the ''Times'' and the ''Post'' for violating the Espionage Act in publishing the documents. Ellsberg and Russo were not acquitted of violating the Espionage Act, but were freed due to a mistrial based on irregularities in the government's case.<ref>Correll, John T. \"[http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2007/February%202007/0207pentagon.aspx The Pentagon Papers]\" ''Air Force Magazine'', February 2007.</ref>\n\nThe divided Supreme Court had denied the government's request to restrain the press. In their opinions the justices expressed varying degrees of support for the First Amendment claims of the press against the government's \"heavy burden of proof\" in establishing that the publisher \"has reason to believe\" the material published \"could be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation\".{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nThe case prompted Harold Edgar and Benno C. Schmidt Jr. to write an article on espionage law in the 1973 ''Columbia Law Review''. Their article was entitled \"The Espionage Statutes and Publication of Defense Information\". Essentially they found the law to be poorly written and vague, with parts of it probably unconstitutional. Their article became widely cited in books and in future court arguments on Espionage cases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/library/|title=Secrecy and Security Library|website=fas.org}}</ref>\n\n''United States v. Dedeyan'' in 1978 was the first prosecution under {{USCSub2|18|793|f|2}} (Dedeyan 'failed to report' that information had been disclosed). The courts relied on ''[[Gorin v.

In what is widely regarded as the greatest victory achieved by [[Napoleon]], the ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'' of [[First French Empire|France]] defeated a larger [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian]] and [[Imperial and Royal Army during the Napoleonic Wars|Austrian]] army led by [[Alexander I of Russia|Emperor Alexander I]] and [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Francis II]]. The battle occurred near the town of Austerlitz in the [[Austrian Empire]] (modern-day [[Slavkov u Brna]] in the [[Czech Republic]]).  Austerlitz brought the [[War of the Third Coalition]] to a rapid end, with the [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]] signed by the Austrians later in the month. The battle is often cited as a tactical masterpiece, in the same league as other historic engagements like [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]] or [[Battle of Gaugamela|Gaugamela]].<ref name=\"farwell1\">Farwell p. 64. \"Austerlitz is generally regarded as one of Napoleon's tactical masterpieces and has been ranked as the equal of Arbela, Cannae, and Leuthen.\"</ref><ref name=\"dupuyref\">Dupuy p. 102</ref>\n\nAfter eliminating an Austrian army during the [[Ulm Campaign]], French forces seized [[Vienna]] in November 1805. The Austrians avoided further conflict until the arrival of the Russians bolstered Allied numbers. Napoleon sent his army north in pursuit of the Allies, but then ordered his forces to retreat so he could feign a grave weakness. Desperate to lure the Allies into battle, Napoleon gave every indication in the days preceding the engagement that the French army was in a pitiful state, even abandoning the dominant Pratzen Heights near Austerlitz. He deployed the French army below the Pratzen Heights and deliberately weakened his right flank, enticing the Allies to launch a major assault there in the hopes of rolling up the whole French line. A forced march from Vienna by [[Louis-Nicolas Davout|Marshal Davout]] and his [[III Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)|III Corps]] plugged the gap left by Napoleon just in time. Meanwhile, the heavy Allied deployment against the French right weakened the allied center on the Pratzen Heights, which was viciously attacked by the [[IV Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)|IV Corps]] of [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Marshal Soult]]. With the Allied center demolished, the French swept through both enemy flanks and sent the Allies fleeing chaotically, capturing thousands of prisoners in the process.\n \nThe Allied disaster significantly shook the faith of Emperor Francis in the [[United Kingdom|British]]-led war effort. France and Austria agreed to an armistice immediately and the Treaty of Pressburg followed shortly after, on 26 December. Pressburg took Austria out of both the war and the Coalition while reinforcing the earlier treaties of [[Treaty of Campo Formio|Campo Formio]] and of [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville|Lun\u00e9ville]] between the two powers. The treaty confirmed the Austrian loss of lands in [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italy]] and [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]] to France, and in Germany to Napoleon's German allies. It also imposed an indemnity of 40 million francs on the defeated Habsburgs and allowed the fleeing Russian troops free passage through hostile territories and back to their home soil. Critically, victory at Austerlitz permitted the creation of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], a collection of German states intended as a buffer zone between France and [[Central Europe]]. The Confederation rendered the [[Holy Roman Empire]] virtually useless, so the latter collapsed in 1806 after Francis abdicated the imperial throne, keeping [[Francis I of Austria|Francis&nbsp;I of Austria]] as his only official title. These achievements, however, did not establish a lasting peace on the continent. [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] worries about growing French influence in Central Europe sparked the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]] in 1806.taemin yun\n\n==Prologue==\n\nEurope had been in turmoil since the start of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in 1792. In 1797, after five years of war, the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] subdued the [[First Coalition]], an alliance of Austria, Prussia, Great Britain, Spain, and various Italian states. A [[Second Coalition]], led by Britain, Austria and Russia, and including the Ottoman Empire, Portugal and Naples, was formed in 1798, but by 1801, this too had been defeated, leaving [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] the only opponent of the new [[French Consulate]]. In March 1802, France and Britain agreed to end hostilities under the [[Treaty of Amiens]]. For the first time in ten years, all of Europe was at peace.\n\nBut many problems persisted between the two sides, making implementation of the treaty increasingly difficult. The British government resented having to return the Cape Colony and most of the Dutch West Indian islands to the Batavian Republic.  Napoleon was angry that British troops had not evacuated the island of [[Malta]].{{sfn | Chandler | page=304}} The tense situation only worsened when Napoleon sent an expeditionary force to crush the [[Haitian Revolution]].{{sfn | Chandler | page=320}} In May 1803, Britain declared war on France.\n\n===Third Coalition===\n\nIn December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish agreement led to the creation of the Third Coalition. British Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]] spent 1804 and 1805 in a flurry of diplomatic activity geared towards forming a new coalition against France, and by April 1805, Britain and Russia had signed an alliance.{{efn | The [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] was dominated by Russia, something Britain was not comfortable with, as it provided valuable commodities like timber, tar, and hemp, crucial supplies to the [[British Empire]]. Additionally, Britain supported the [[Ottoman Empire]] against Russian incursions towards the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Meanwhile, French territorial rearrangements in Germany occurred without Russian consultation and Napoleon's annexations in the [[Po River|Po valley]] increasingly strained relations between the two.{{sfn | Chandler | page=328}}}} Having been defeated twice in recent memory by France, and being keen on revenge, Austria joined the coalition a few months later.{{sfn | Chandler | page=331}}\n\n==Forces==\n{{See also|Order of Battle at the Austerlitz campaign}}\n\n===French Imperial army===\nBefore the formation of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled an invasion force, called the ''Arm\u00e9e d'Angleterre'' (Army of England) around six camps at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] in Northern France. He intended to use this invasion force to strike at England, and was so confident of success that he had commemorative medals struck to celebrate the conquest of the English.<ref>[http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/guide18/timeline16.html Channel4 Time Traveller series]</ref> Although they never invaded, Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for any possible military operation. Boredom among the troops occasionally set in, but Napoleon paid many visits and conducted lavish parades in order to boost morale.{{sfn | Chandler | page=323}}\n\nThe men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon would later call ''[[La Grande Arm\u00e9e]]''. At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven [[corps]], which were large field units that contained 36 to 40 [[cannon]] each and were capable of independent action until other corps could come to the rescue.{{sfn | Chandler | page= 332}} A single corps (properly situated in a strong defensive position) could survive at least a day without support, giving the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign.\n\nIn addition to these forces, Napoleon created a [[cavalry]] reserve of 22,000 organized into two [[cuirassier]] [[Division (military)|divisions]], four mounted [[dragoon]] divisions, one division of dismounted dragoons and one of light cavalry, all supported by 24 [[artillery]] pieces.{{sfn | Chandler | page= 332}} By 1805, the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' had grown to a force of 350,000 men,{{sfn | Chandler | page= 333}} who were well equipped, well trained, and led by competent officers.\n\n===Russian Imperial army===\n\nThe Russian army in 1805 had many characteristics of [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] organization. There was no permanent formation above the [[regiment]]al level, and senior officers were mostly recruited from aristocratic circles; commissions were generally given to the highest bidder, regardless of competence.  The Russian infantry was considered one of the most hardy in Europe, however, and there was fine Russian artillery, manned by trained professional soldiers, who regularly fought hard to prevent their pieces from falling into enemy hands.<ref name=\"russianarmy\">Todd Fisher & Gregory Fremont-Barnes, ''The Napoleonic Wars: The Rise and Fall of an Empire,'' p. 33</ref>\n\n===Austrian Imperial army===\n\n[[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]], brother of the Austrian Emperor, had started to reform the Austrian army in 1801 by taking away power from the [[Hofkriegsrat]], the military-political council responsible for the armed forces.<ref name=\"hofkriegsrat\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 31</ref> Charles was Austria's best field commander,{{sfn | Uffindell | page= 155}} but he was unpopular at court and lost much influence when, against his advice, Austria decided to go to war with France. [[Karl Mack]] became the new main commander in Austria's army, instituting reforms on the eve of the war that called for a regiment to be composed of four [[battalion]]s of four [[company (military unit)|companies]], rather than three battalions of six companies.<ref name=\"Fisher Fremont-Barnes 32\">Todd Fisher & Gregory Fremont-Barnes, ''The Napoleonic Wars: The Rise and Fall of an Empire.'' p. 32</ref><ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Stutterheim\n  | first = Karl\n  | others = Pine-Coffin, John (trans.)\n  | title = A Detailed Account of The Battle of Austerlitz\n  | publisher = Thomas Goddard\n  | year = 1807\n  | location = London\n  | pages = [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_KlNEAAAAIAAJ/page/n60 46]\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_KlNEAAAAIAAJ\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = }}</ref> Austrian cavalry was considered the best in Europe, and one of the best of the time anywhere.<ref name=\"Fisher Fremont-Barnes 32\"/>\n\n==Preliminary moves==\n[[File:Charles Th\u00e9venin - Reddition de la ville d'Ulm.jpg|350px|thumb|alt=Colored painting showing Napoleon receiving the surrender of General Mack, with the city of Ulm in the background. |[[Napoleon]] takes the surrender of [[Karl Mack|General Mack]] and the Austrian army at [[Battle of Ulm|Ulm]]. Painting by [[Charles Th\u00e9venin]].]]\n\nIn August 1805, Napoleon, [[Emperor of the French]] since December of the previous year, turned his sights from the [[English Channel]] to the [[Rhine River|Rhine]] to deal with the new Austrian and Russian threats. On 25 September after a feverish march in great secrecy, 200,000 French troops began to cross the Rhine on a front of {{convert|260|km|mi|abbr=on}}.{{sfn | Brooks | page= 108}}{{sfn | Uffindell | page= 15}} Mack had gathered the greater part of the Austrian army at the fortress of [[Ulm]] in Swabia (modern day southern Germany).\n\nNapoleon swung his forces southward in a wheeling movement that put the French at the Austrian rear. The [[Ulm Campaign|Ulm Maneuver]] was well-executed and on 20 October Mack and 23,000 Austrian troops surrendered at Ulm, bringing the number of Austrian prisoners of the campaign to 60,000.{{sfn | Uffindell | page= 15}} Although this spectacular victory was soured by the defeat of the Franco-Spanish fleet at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] the following day, French success on land continued as [[Vienna]] fell in November. The French gained 100,000 muskets, 500 cannons, and intact bridges across the [[Danube River|Danube]].{{sfn | Chandler | page= 407}}\n\nMeanwhile, Russian delays prevented them from saving the Austrian armies; the Russians then withdrew to the northeast, to await reinforcements and link up with surviving Austrian units. Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] appointed general [[Mikhail Kutuzov|Mikhail Illarionovich Kutuzov]] commander-in-chief of the combined Russo-Austrian force. On 9 September 1805, Kutuzov arrived at the battlefield, quickly contacting [[Francis I of Austria]] and his courtiers to discuss strategy and logistics. Under pressure from Kutuzov, the Austrians agreed to supply munitions and weapons in a timely manner. Kutuzov also spotted shortcomings in the Austrian defense plan, which he called \"very dogmatic.\" He objected to Austrian annexation of the land recently under Napoleon's control, because this would make the local people distrust the allied force.<ref name=\"lvq10\"/>\n\nThe French followed after Kutuzov, but soon found themselves in a difficult position. Prussian intentions were unknown and could be hostile, the Russian and Austrian armies had converged, and French lines of communication were extremely long, requiring strong garrisons to keep them open. Napoleon realized that to capitalize on the success at Ulm, he had to force the Allies to battle and defeat them.{{sfn | Chandler | page= 409}}\n\nOn the Russian side, Kutuzov also realized Napoleon needed to do battle; so instead of clinging to the \"suicidal\" Austrian defense plan, Kutuzov decided to retreat. He ordered [[Pyotr Bagration]] to contain the French at Vienna with 600 soldiers, and instructed Bagration to accept [[Joachim Murat|Murat's]] ceasefire proposal so that the Allied Army could have more time to retreat. It was later discovered that the proposal was false and had been used in order to launch a surprise attack on Vienna. Nonetheless, Bagration was able to hold off the French assault for a time by negotiating an armistice with Murat, thereby providing Kutuzov time to position himself with the Russian rearguard near [[Battle of Sch\u00f6ngrabern|Hollabrunn]].\n\nMurat initially refrained from an attack, believing the entire Russian army stood before him. Napoleon soon realized Murat's mistakes and ordered him to pursue quickly; but the allied army had already retreated to [[Olomouc|Olmutz]].<ref name=\"lvq10\"/> According to Kutuzov's plan, the Allies would retreat further to the [[Carpathian]] region<ref name = \"dornbrose46\">{{cite book | first=Eric Dorn | last=Brose | title=German history, 1789\u20131871: from the Holy Roman Empire to the Bismarckian Reich | page=46}}</ref> and \"at [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], I will bury the French.\"<ref name=\"lvq10\"/>\n\nNapoleon did not stay still. The French Emperor decided to set a psychological trap in order to lure the Allies out. Days before any fighting, Napoleon had been giving the impression that his army was weak and that he desired a negotiated peace.{{sfn | McLynn | page= 342}} About 53,000 French troops\u2014including Soult, Lannes and Murat's forces\u2014were assigned to take [[Slavkov u Brna|Austerlitz]] and the Olmutz road, occupying the enemy's attention. The Allied forces, numbering about 89,000, seemed far superior and would be tempted to attack the outnumbered French army. However, the Allies did not know that Bernadotte, Mortier and Davout were already within the supported distance, and could be called in by forced marches from Iglau and Vienna respectively, raising the French number to 75,000 troops.{{sfn | Chandler | page= 410}}\n\nNapoleon's lure did not stop at that. On 25 November, General [[Anne Jean Marie Ren\u00e9 Savary|Savary]] was sent to the Allied headquarters at Olmutz to deliver Napoleon's message expressing his desire to avoid a battle, while secretly examining the Allied forces' situation. As expected, the overture was seen as a sign of weakness. When Francis I offered an armistice on the 27th, Napoleon accepted enthusiastically. On the same day, Napoleon ordered Soult to abandon both Austerlitz and the Pratzen Heights and, while doing so, to create an impression of chaos during the retreat that would induce the enemy to occupy the Heights.\n\nThe next day (28 November), the French Emperor requested a personal interview with Alexander I and received a visit from the Tsar's most impetuous aide, Prince [[Peter Petrovich Dolgorukov (general, born 1777)|Peter Dolgorukov]]. The meeting was another part of the trap, as Napoleon intentionally expressed anxiety and hesitation to his opponents. Dolgorukov reported to the Tsar an additional indication of French weakness.{{sfn | Chandler | page= 410\u2013411}}\n\nThe plan was successful. Many of the Allied officers, including the Tsar's aides and the Austrian Chief of Staff [[Franz von Weyrother]], strongly supported an immediate attack and appeared to sway Tsar Alexander.{{sfn | Chandler | page= 411}} Kutuzov's plan to retreat further to the [[Carpathian]] region was rejected, and the Allied forces soon fell into Napoleon's trap.\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Bivouac on the Eve of the Battle of Austerlitz, 1st December 1805.PNG|thumb|300px|alt=Colored painting showing French troops lighting torches for Napoleon. |Napoleon with his troops on the eve of battle.

Napoleon had some 72,000 men and 157 guns for the impending battle, with about 7,000 troops under [[Louis Nicolas Davout|Davout]] still far to the south in the direction of Vienna.{{sfn | Uffindell | page= 19}}<ref name=\"nicholls910\">David Nicholls, ''Napoleon: a biographical companion'' pp. 9\u201310.</ref> The Allies had about 85,000 soldiers, seventy percent of them Russian, and 318 guns.{{sfn | Uffindell | page= 19}}\n\nAt first, Napoleon was not totally confident of victory. In a letter written to Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand]], Napoleon requested Talleyrand not tell anyone about the upcoming battle because he did not want to disturb Empress [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais|Jos\u00e9phine]]. According to Frederick C. Schneid, the French Emperor's chief worry was how he could explain to Jos\u00e9phine a French defeat.<ref name=\"schneid137\">Frederick C. Schneid, ''Napoleon's conquest of Europe: the War of the Third Coalition'', p. 137</ref>\n\n===Battlefield===\n\nThe battle took place about six miles (ten kilometers) southeast of the town of [[Brno]], between that town and Austerlitz ({{lang-cs|[[Slavkov u Brna]]}}) in what is now the Czech Republic. The northern part of the battlefield was dominated by the 700-foot (210-meter) Santon Hill and the 880-foot (270-meter) [[\u017dur\u00e1\u0148|Zuran (\u017dur\u00e1\u0148)]] Hill, both overlooking the vital [[Olomouc]]/Brno road, which was on an east/west axis. To the west of these two hills was the village of [[Bed\u0159ichovice|Bellowitz (Bed\u0159ichovice)]], and between them the Bosenitz (Roketnice) stream went south to link up with the Goldbach (\u0158\u00ed\u010dka) stream, the latter flowing by the villages of [[Kobylnice (Brno-Country District)|Kobelnitz (Kobylnice)]], [[Sokolnice|Sokolnitz (Sokolnice)]], and [[Telnice (Brno-Country District)|Telnitz (Telnice)]].\n\nThe centrepiece of the entire area was the [[Prace, Czech Republic|Pratzen (Prace)]] Heights, a gently sloping hill about 35 to 40 feet (10 to 12 meters) in height. An aide noted that Napoleon repeatedly told his marshals, \"Gentlemen, examine this ground carefully, it is going to be a battlefield; you will have a part to play upon it.\"{{sfn | Chandler | page= 412\u2013413}}\n\n===Allied plans and dispositions===\n\n[[File:Battle of Austerlitz, Situation at 1800, 1 December 1805.png|300px|thumb|right|alt=Map showing French troops concentrated to the west of the battlefield and the Allies to the east. |Allied (red) and French (blue) deployments at 1800 hours on 1 December 1805]]\nThe Allied council met on 1 December to discuss proposals for the battle. Most of the Allied strategists had two fundamental ideas in mind: making contact with the enemy and securing the southern flank that held the communication line to Vienna. Although the Tsar and his immediate entourage pushed hard for a battle, Emperor Francis of Austria was more cautious and, as mentioned, he was seconded by Kutuzov, the Commander-in-chief of the Russians and the Allied troops.{{sfn | Chandler | page= 416}} The pressure to fight from the Russian nobles and the Austrian commanders, however, was too strong, and the Allies adopted the plan of the Austrian Chief-of-Staff, [[Franz von Weyrother]].{{sfn | Chandler | page= 416}} This called for a main drive against the French right flank, which the Allies noticed was lightly guarded, and diversionary attacks against the French left. The Allies deployed most of their troops into four columns that would attack the French right. The [[Russian Imperial Guard]] was held in reserve while Russian troops under [[Pyotr Bagration|Bagration]] guarded the Allied right. The Russian Tsar rudely stripped the authority of Commander-in-chief M. I. Kutuzov and gave it to Franz von Weyrother. In the battle, Kutuzov could only command the IV Corps of the Allied army, although he was still the ''de facto'' commander because the Tsar was afraid to take over in case his favoured plan failed.<ref name=\"lvq10\"/>\n\n===French plans and dispositions===\n\n[[File:Cuirassiers 1805 Meissonier Chantilly.jpg|thumb|300px|French [[cuirassier]]s taking position]]\nNapoleon was hoping that the Allied forces would attack, and to encourage them, he deliberately weakened his right flank.<ref name=\"flank\">Richard Brooks (editor), ''Atlas of World Military History.'' p. 109</ref> On 28 November Napoleon met with his marshals at Imperial Headquarters, who informed him of their qualms about the forthcoming battle.

IV Corps' position was cloaked by dense mist during the early stage of the battle; in fact how long the mist lasted was vital to Napoleon's plan: Soult's troops would become uncovered if the mist dissipated too soon, but if it lingered too long, Napoleon would be unable to determine when the Allied troops had evacuated Pratzen Heights, preventing him from timing his attack properly.<ref name = barnes21>{{cite book |title= Napoleon Bonaparte: leadership, strategy, conflict |last= Gregory Fremont-Barnes |first= |year= 2010 |publisher= Osprey Publishing |location= Great Britain |isbn= 978-1-84603-458-9 |page= 21 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, to support his weak right flank, Napoleon ordered Davout's [[III Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)|III Corps]] to force march all the way from Vienna and join General [[Claude Legrand|Legrand's]] men, who held the extreme southern flank that would bear the heaviest part of the Allied attack. Davout's soldiers had 48 hours to march {{convert|110|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Their arrival was crucial in determining the success of the French plan. Indeed, the arrangement of Napoleon on the right flank was very risky as the French had only minimal troops garrisoning there. However, Napoleon was able to use such a risky plan because Davout\u2014the commander of III Corps\u2014was one of Napoleon's best marshals, because the right flank's position was protected by a complicated system of streams and lakes,<ref name=\"lvq10\"/> and because the French had already settled upon a secondary line of retreat through [[Brno|Brunn]].{{sfn | Chandler | page=412}} The [[French Imperial Guard|Imperial Guard]] and [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Bernadotte's]] I Corps were held in reserve while the V Corps under [[Jean Lannes|Lannes]] guarded the northern sector of the battlefield, where the new communication line was located.<ref name=\"lvq10\"/>\n\nBy 1 December 1805, the French troops had been shifted in accordance with the Allied movement southward, as Napoleon expected.<ref name = barnes19/>\n\n===Battle begins===\n\nThe battle began at about 8 a.m. with the first allied lines attacking the village of Telnitz, which was defended by the 3rd Line Regiment. This sector of the battlefield witnessed heavy fighting in this early action as several ferocious Allied charges evicted the French from the town and forced them onto the other side of the Goldbach. The first men of Davout's corps arrived at this time and threw the Allies out of Telnitz before they too were attacked by [[hussar]]s and re-abandoned the town. Additional Allied attacks out of Telnitz were checked by French artillery.<ref name=\"attacks\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 48\u201349</ref>\n\n[[File:Willewalde - Czar's Guard capture 4th line regiment's standard at Austerlitz.jpg|left|thumb|240px|Capture of a French regiment's eagle by the cavalry of the Russian guard, by [[Bogdan Willewalde]] (1884)]]\nAllied columns started pouring against the French right, but not at the desired speed, so the French were mostly successful in curbing the attacks. Actually, the Allied deployments were mistaken and poorly timed: cavalry detachments under [[Johann I Josef, Prince of Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein]] on the Allied left flank had to be placed in the right flank and in the process they ran into and slowed down part of the second column of infantry that was advancing towards the French right.<ref name=\"Fisher Fremont-Barnes 48\"/> At the time, the planners thought this slowing was disastrous, but later on it helped the Allies. Meanwhile, the leading elements of the second column were attacking the village of Sokolnitz, which was defended by the 26th Light Regiment and the ''[[Tirailleur]]s'', French [[skirmisher]]s. Initial Allied assaults proved unsuccessful and [[Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron|General Langeron]] ordered the bombardment of the village. This deadly barrage forced the French out, and at about the same time, the third column attacked the castle of Sokolnitz. The French, however, counterattacked and regained the village, only to be thrown out again. Conflict in this area ended temporarily when [[Louis Friant|Friant's]] division (part of III Corps) retook the village. Sokolnitz was perhaps the most fought over area in the battlefield and would change hands several times as the day progressed.<ref name=\"Fisher Fremont 49\">Todd Fisher & Gregory Fremont-Barnes, ''The Napoleonic Wars: The Rise and Fall of an Empire.'' p. 49</ref>\n\nWhile the allied troops attacked the French right flank, Kutuzov's IV Corp stopped at the Pratzen Heights and stayed still. Just like Napoleon, Kutuzov realized the importance of Pratzen and decided to protect the position. But the young Tsar did not, so he expelled the IV Corp from the Heights. This act quickly pushed the Allied army into her grave.<ref name=\"lvq10\"/>\n\n===\"One sharp blow and the war is over\"===\n\n[[File:Battle of Austerlitz - Situation at 0900, 2 December 1805.gif|300px|thumb|right|alt=Map with blue lines showing the French advance against the Allied center, symbolized with red lines. |The decisive attacks on the Allied center by [[Louis-Vincent-Joseph Le Blond de Saint-Hilaire|St. Hilaire]] and [[Dominique Vandamme|Vandamme]] split the Allied army in two and left the French in a golden strategic position to win the battle.]]\nAt about 8:45&nbsp;a.m., satisfied at the weakness in the enemy centre, Napoleon asked Soult how long it would take for his men to reach the Pratzen Heights, to which the Marshal replied, \"Less than twenty minutes, sire.\" About 15 minutes later, Napoleon ordered the attack, adding, \"One sharp blow and the war is over.\"{{sfn | Uffindell | page= 21}}\n\nA dense fog helped to cloud the advance of [[Louis-Vincent-Joseph Le Blond de Saint-Hilaire|St. Hilaire's]] French division, but as they went up the slope the legendary 'Sun of Austerlitz' ripped the mist apart and encouraged them forward.<ref name=\"Fisher Fremont 49\"/> Russian soldiers and commanders on top of the heights were stunned to see so many French troops coming towards them.{{sfn | Chandler | page=425}} Allied commanders moved some of the delayed detachments of the fourth column into this bitter struggle. Over an hour of fighting destroyed much of this unit. The other men from the second column, mostly inexperienced Austrians, also participated in the struggle and swung the numbers against one of the best fighting forces in the French army, eventually forcing them to withdraw down the slopes. However, gripped by desperation, St. Hilaire's men struck hard once more and bayoneted the Allies out of the heights. To the north, [[Dominique Vandamme|General Vandamme's]] division attacked an area called Star\u00e9 Vinohrady (\"Old Vineyards\") and, through talented skirmishing and deadly volleys, broke several Allied battalions.<ref name=\"sun\">Todd Fisher & Gregory Fremont-Barnes, ''The Napoleonic Wars: The Rise and Fall of an Empire.'' p. 49\u201350</ref>\n\nThe battle had firmly turned in France's favour, but it was far from over. Napoleon ordered Bernadotte's I Corps to support Vandamme's left and moved his own command center from \u017dur\u00e1\u0148 Hill to St. Anthony's Chapel on the Pratzen Heights. The difficult position of the Allies was confirmed by the decision to send in the [[Russian Imperial Guard]]; [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Constantine]], Tsar Alexander's brother, commanded the Guard and counterattacked in Vandamme's section of the field, forcing a bloody effort and the only loss of a French standard in the battle (a battalion of the 4th Line Regiment was defeated). Sensing trouble, Napoleon ordered his own heavy Guard cavalry forward. These men pulverized their Russian counterparts, but with both sides pouring in large masses of cavalry, no victory was clear.\n\nThe Russians had a numerical advantage but soon the tide swung as [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon|Drouet's]] Division, the 2nd of Bernadotte's I Corps, deployed on the flank of the action and allowed French cavalry to seek refuge behind their lines. The [[horse artillery]] of the Guard also inflicted heavy casualties on the Russian cavalry and fusiliers. The Russians broke and many died as they were pursued by the reinvigorated French cavalry for about a quarter of a mile.<ref name=\"broke\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 51</ref> The casualties of the Russians in Pratzen included Kutuzov, who was severely wounded, and his son-in-law [[Ferdinand von Tiesenhausen]] who was killed.<ref name=\"lvq10\">L\u00ea Vinh Qu\u1ed1c, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Th\u01b0, L\u00ea Ph\u1ee5ng Ho\u00e0ng, pp. 154\u2013160</ref>\n\n===Endgame===\n\n{{quote|I was... under fierce and continuous canister fire...

Napoleon now had the option to strike at one of the wings, and he chose the Allied left since other enemy sectors had already been cleared or were conducting fighting retreats.]]\nMeanwhile, the northernmost part of the battlefield was also witnessing heavy fighting. [[Johann I Josef, Prince of Liechtenstein|Prince Liechtenstein's]] heavy cavalry began to assault [[Fran\u00e7ois \u00c9tienne de Kellermann|Kellerman's]] lighter cavalry forces after eventually arriving at the correct position in the field. The fighting initially went well for the French, but Kellerman's forces took cover behind General Caffarelli's infantry division once it became clear Russian numbers were too great. Caffarelli's men halted the Russian assaults and permitted [[Joachim Murat|Murat]] to send two cuirassier divisions (one commanded by [[Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul|d'Hautpoul]] and the other one by [[\u00c9tienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty|Nansouty]]) into the fray to finish off the Russian cavalry for good. The ensuing m\u00eal\u00e9e was bitter and long, but the French ultimately prevailed. Lannes then led his V Corps against [[Pyotr Bagration|Bagration's]] men and after hard fighting managed to drive the skilled Russian commander off the field. He wanted to pursue, but Murat, who was in control of this sector in the battlefield, was against the idea.<ref name=\"Fisher Fremont-Barnes 52\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 52</ref>\n\nNapoleon's focus now shifted towards the southern end of the battlefield where the French and the Allies were still fighting over Sokolnitz and Telnitz. In an effective double-pronged assault, St. Hilaire's division and part of Davout's III Corps smashed through the enemy at Sokolnitz, which persuaded the commanders of the first two columns, Generals [[Michael von Kienmayer|Kienmayer]] and [[Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron|Langeron]], to flee as fast as they could. [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden|Buxhowden]], the commander of the Allied left and the man responsible for leading the attack, was completely drunk and fled as well. Kienmayer covered his withdrawal with the [[Andreas O'Reilly von Ballinlough|O'Reilly]] light cavalry, who managed to defeat five of six French cavalry regiments before they too had to retreat.<ref name=\"Fisher Fremont-Barnes 52\"/>\n\nGeneral panic now seized the Allied army and it abandoned the field in all possible directions. A famous episode occurred during this retreat: Russian forces that had been defeated by the French right withdrew south towards Vienna via the Satschan frozen ponds. French artillery pounded towards the men, and the ice was broken due to the bombardment. The men drowned in the cold ponds, dozens of Russian artillery pieces going down with them. Estimates of how many guns were captured differ: there may have been as few as 38 or more than 100. Sources also differ about casualties, with figures ranging between 200 and 2,000 dead. Many drowning Russians were saved by their victorious foes.{{sfn | Chandler | page=432}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Rose|first=John Holland|authorlink=John Holland Rose|title=The Life of Napoleon I|publisher=G Bell and Sons|location=London|year=1910|edition=third|volume=2|pages=38|chapter=XXIII.

The French lost around 9,000 out of an army of 66,000, or about 13% of their forces. The Allies also lost some 180 guns and about 50 standards. The great victory was met by sheer amazement and delirium in Paris, where just days earlier the nation had been teetering on the brink of financial collapse. Napoleon wrote to [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais|Josephine]], \"I have beaten the Austro-Russian army commanded by the two emperors. I am a little weary....I embrace you.\"{{sfn | Chandler | page=432-433}}Napoleon's comments in this letter led to the battle's other famous designation, \"Battle of the Three Emperors.\" However, Emperor Francis of Austria was not present at the battlefield.

Austria agreed to recognize French territory captured by the treaties of [[Treaty of Campo Formio|Campo Formio]] (1797) and [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville|Lun\u00e9ville]] (1801), cede land to Bavaria, [[History of W\u00fcrttemberg#The Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg (1806\u20131918)|Wurttemberg]], and [[History of Baden|Baden]], which were Napoleon's German allies, and pay 40 million francs in war indemnities, and [[Venice]] was given to the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]]. It was a harsh end for Austria, but certainly not a catastrophic peace. The Russian army was allowed to withdraw to home territory and the French ensconced themselves in Southern Germany. The Holy Roman Empire was effectively wiped out, 1806 being seen as its final year. Napoleon created the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], a string of German states meant to serve as a buffer between France and Prussia. Prussia saw these and other moves as an affront to its status as the main power of Central Europe and it went to war with France in 1806.\n\n==Rewards==\n\nNapoleon's words to his troops after the battle were full of praise: ''Soldats!

In what is widely regarded as the greatest victory achieved by [[Napoleon]], the ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'' of [[First French Empire|France]] defeated a larger [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian]] and [[Imperial and Royal Army during the Napoleonic Wars|Austrian]] army led by [[Alexander I of Russia|Emperor Alexander I]] and [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Francis II]]. The battle occurred near the town of Austerlitz in the [[Austrian Empire]] (modern-day [[Slavkov u Brna]] in the [[Czech Republic]]).  Austerlitz brought the [[War of the Third Coalition]] to a rapid end, with the [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]] signed by the Austrians later in the month. The battle is often cited as a tactical masterpiece, in the same league as other historic engagements like [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]] or [[Battle of Gaugamela|Gaugamela]].<ref name=\"farwell1\">Farwell p. 64. \"Austerlitz is generally regarded as one of Napoleon's tactical masterpieces and has been ranked as the equal of Arbela, Cannae, and Leuthen.\"</ref><ref name=\"dupuyref\">Dupuy p. 102</ref>\n\nAfter eliminating an Austrian army during the [[Ulm Campaign]], French forces seized [[Vienna]] in November 1805. The Austrians avoided further conflict until the arrival of the Russians bolstered Allied numbers. Napoleon sent his army north in pursuit of the Allies, but then ordered his forces to retreat so he could feign a grave weakness. Desperate to lure the Allies into battle, Napoleon gave every indication in the days preceding the engagement that the French army was in a pitiful state, even abandoning the dominant Pratzen Heights near Austerlitz. He deployed the French army below the Pratzen Heights and deliberately weakened his right flank, enticing the Allies to launch a major assault there in the hopes of rolling up the whole French line. A forced march from Vienna by [[Louis-Nicolas Davout|Marshal Davout]] and his [[III Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)|III Corps]] plugged the gap left by Napoleon just in time. Meanwhile, the heavy Allied deployment against the French right weakened the allied center on the Pratzen Heights, which was viciously attacked by the [[IV Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)|IV Corps]] of [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Marshal Soult]]. With the Allied center demolished, the French swept through both enemy flanks and sent the Allies fleeing chaotically, capturing thousands of prisoners in the process.\n \nThe Allied disaster significantly shook the faith of Emperor Francis in the [[United Kingdom|British]]-led war effort. France and Austria agreed to an armistice immediately and the Treaty of Pressburg followed shortly after, on 26 December. Pressburg took Austria out of both the war and the Coalition while reinforcing the earlier treaties of [[Treaty of Campo Formio|Campo Formio]] and of [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville|Lun\u00e9ville]] between the two powers. The treaty confirmed the Austrian loss of lands in [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italy]] and [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]] to France, and in Germany to Napoleon's German allies. It also imposed an indemnity of 40 million francs on the defeated Habsburgs and allowed the fleeing Russian troops free passage through hostile territories and back to their home soil. Critically, victory at Austerlitz permitted the creation of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], a collection of German states intended as a buffer zone between France and [[Central Europe]]. The Confederation rendered the [[Holy Roman Empire]] virtually useless, so the latter collapsed in 1806 after Francis abdicated the imperial throne, keeping [[Francis I of Austria|Francis&nbsp;I of Austria]] as his only official title. These achievements, however, did not establish a lasting peace on the continent. [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] worries about growing French influence in Central Europe sparked the [[War of the Fourth Coalition]] in 1806.\n\n==Prologue==\n\nEurope had been in turmoil since the start of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in 1792. In 1797, after five years of war, the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] subdued the [[First Coalition]], an alliance of Austria, Prussia, Great Britain, Spain, and various Italian states. A [[Second Coalition]], led by Britain, Austria and Russia, and including the Ottoman Empire, Portugal and Naples, was formed in 1798, but by 1801, this too had been defeated, leaving [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] the only opponent of the new [[French Consulate]]. In March 1802, France and Britain agreed to end hostilities under the [[Treaty of Amiens]]. For the first time in ten years, all of Europe was at peace.\n\nBut many problems persisted between the two sides, making implementation of the treaty increasingly difficult. The British government resented having to return the Cape Colony and most of the Dutch West Indian islands to the Batavian Republic.  Napoleon was angry that British troops had not evacuated the island of [[Malta]].{{sfn | Chandler | page=304}} The tense situation only worsened when Napoleon sent an expeditionary force to crush the [[Haitian Revolution]].{{sfn | Chandler | page=320}} In May 1803, Britain declared war on France.\n\n===Third Coalition===\n\nIn December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish agreement led to the creation of the Third Coalition. British Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]] spent 1804 and 1805 in a flurry of diplomatic activity geared towards forming a new coalition against France, and by April 1805, Britain and Russia had signed an alliance.{{efn | The [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] was dominated by Russia, something Britain was not comfortable with, as it provided valuable commodities like timber, tar, and hemp, crucial supplies to the [[British Empire]]. Additionally, Britain supported the [[Ottoman Empire]] against Russian incursions towards the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Meanwhile, French territorial rearrangements in Germany occurred without Russian consultation and Napoleon's annexations in the [[Po River|Po valley]] increasingly strained relations between the two.{{sfn | Chandler | page=328}}}} Having been defeated twice in recent memory by France, and being keen on revenge, Austria joined the coalition a few months later.{{sfn | Chandler | page=331}}\n\n==Forces==\n{{See also|Order of Battle at the Austerlitz campaign}}\n\n===French Imperial army===\nBefore the formation of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled an invasion force, called the ''Arm\u00e9e d'Angleterre'' (Army of England) around six camps at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]] in Northern France. He intended to use this invasion force to strike at England, and was so confident of success that he had commemorative medals struck to celebrate the conquest of the English.<ref>[http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/guide18/timeline16.html Channel4 Time Traveller series]</ref> Although they never invaded, Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for any possible military operation. Boredom among the troops occasionally set in, but Napoleon paid many visits and conducted lavish parades in order to boost morale.{{sfn | Chandler | page=323}}\n\nThe men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon would later call ''[[La Grande Arm\u00e9e]]''. At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven [[corps]], which were large field units that contained 36 to 40 [[cannon]] each and were capable of independent action until other corps could come to the rescue.{{sfn | Chandler | page= 332}} A single corps (properly situated in a strong defensive position) could survive at least a day without support, giving the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign.\n\nIn addition to these forces, Napoleon created a [[cavalry]] reserve of 22,000 organized into two [[cuirassier]] [[Division (military)|divisions]], four mounted [[dragoon]] divisions, one division of dismounted dragoons and one of light cavalry, all supported by 24 [[artillery]] pieces.{{sfn | Chandler | page= 332}} By 1805, the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' had grown to a force of 350,000 men,{{sfn | Chandler | page= 333}} who were well equipped, well trained, and led by competent officers.\n\n===Russian Imperial army===\n\nThe Russian army in 1805 had many characteristics of [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] organization. There was no permanent formation above the [[regiment]]al level, and senior officers were mostly recruited from aristocratic circles; commissions were generally given to the highest bidder, regardless of competence.  The Russian infantry was considered one of the most hardy in Europe, however, and there was fine Russian artillery, manned by trained professional soldiers, who regularly fought hard to prevent their pieces from falling into enemy hands.<ref name=\"russianarmy\">Todd Fisher & Gregory Fremont-Barnes, ''The Napoleonic Wars: The Rise and Fall of an Empire,'' p. 33</ref>\n\n===Austrian Imperial army===\n\n[[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]], brother of the Austrian Emperor, had started to reform the Austrian army in 1801 by taking away power from the [[Hofkriegsrat]], the military-political council responsible for the armed forces.<ref name=\"hofkriegsrat\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 31</ref> Charles was Austria's best field commander,{{sfn | Uffindell | page= 155}} but he was unpopular at court and lost much influence when, against his advice, Austria decided to go to war with France.

Painting by [[Charles Th\u00e9venin]].]]\n\nIn August 1805, Napoleon, [[Emperor of the French]] since December of the previous year, turned his sights from the [[English Channel]] to the [[Rhine River|Rhine]] to deal with the new Austrian and Russian threats. On 25 September after a feverish march in great secrecy, 200,000 French troops began to cross the Rhine on a front of {{convert|260|km|mi|abbr=on}}.{{sfn | Brooks | page= 108}}{{sfn | Uffindell | page= 15}} Mack had gathered the greater part of the Austrian army at the fortress of [[Ulm]] in Swabia (modern day southern Germany).\n\nNapoleon swung his forces southward in a wheeling movement that put the French at the Austrian rear. The [[Ulm Campaign|Ulm Maneuver]] was well-executed and on 20 October Mack and 23,000 Austrian troops surrendered at Ulm, bringing the number of Austrian prisoners of the campaign to 60,000.{{sfn | Uffindell | page= 15}} Although this spectacular victory was soured by the defeat of the Franco-Spanish fleet at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] the following day, French success on land continued as [[Vienna]] fell in November. The French gained 100,000 muskets, 500 cannons, and intact bridges across the [[Danube River|Danube]].{{sfn | Chandler | page= 407}}\n\nMeanwhile, Russian delays prevented them from saving the Austrian armies; the Russians then withdrew to the northeast, to await reinforcements and link up with surviving Austrian units. Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] appointed general [[Mikhail Kutuzov|Mikhail Illarionovich Kutuzov]] commander-in-chief of the combined Russo-Austrian force. On 9 September 1805, Kutuzov arrived at the battlefield, quickly contacting [[Francis I of Austria]] and his courtiers to discuss strategy and logistics. Under pressure from Kutuzov, the Austrians agreed to supply munitions and weapons in a timely manner. Kutuzov also spotted shortcomings in the Austrian defense plan, which he called \"very dogmatic.\" He objected to Austrian annexation of the land recently under Napoleon's control, because this would make the local people distrust the allied force.<ref name=\"lvq10\"/>\n\nThe French followed after Kutuzov, but soon found themselves in a difficult position. Prussian intentions were unknown and could be hostile, the Russian and Austrian armies had converged, and French lines of communication were extremely long, requiring strong garrisons to keep them open. Napoleon realized that to capitalize on the success at Ulm, he had to force the Allies to battle and defeat them.{{sfn | Chandler | page= 409}}\n\nOn the Russian side, Kutuzov also realized Napoleon needed to do battle; so instead of clinging to the \"suicidal\" Austrian defense plan, Kutuzov decided to retreat. He ordered [[Pyotr Bagration]] to contain the French at Vienna with 600 soldiers, and instructed Bagration to accept [[Joachim Murat|Murat's]] ceasefire proposal so that the Allied Army could have more time to retreat. It was later discovered that the proposal was false and had been used in order to launch a surprise attack on Vienna. Nonetheless, Bagration was able to hold off the French assault for a time by negotiating an armistice with Murat, thereby providing Kutuzov time to position himself with the Russian rearguard near [[Battle of Sch\u00f6ngrabern|Hollabrunn]].\n\nMurat initially refrained from an attack, believing the entire Russian army stood before him. Napoleon soon realized Murat's mistakes and ordered him to pursue quickly; but the allied army had already retreated to [[Olomouc|Olmutz]].<ref name=\"lvq10\"/> According to Kutuzov's plan, the Allies would retreat further to the [[Carpathian]] region<ref name = \"dornbrose46\">{{cite book | first=Eric Dorn | last=Brose | title=German history, 1789\u20131871: from the Holy Roman Empire to the Bismarckian Reich | page=46}}</ref> and \"at [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], I will bury the French.\"<ref name=\"lvq10\"/>\n\nNapoleon did not stay still. The French Emperor decided to set a psychological trap in order to lure the Allies out. Days before any fighting, Napoleon had been giving the impression that his army was weak and that he desired a negotiated peace.{{sfn | McLynn | page= 342}} About 53,000 French troops\u2014including Soult, Lannes and Murat's forces\u2014were assigned to take [[Slavkov u Brna|Austerlitz]] and the Olmutz road, occupying the enemy's attention. The Allied forces, numbering about 89,000, seemed far superior and would be tempted to attack the outnumbered French army. However, the Allies did not know that Bernadotte, Mortier and Davout were already within the supported distance, and could be called in by forced marches from Iglau and Vienna respectively, raising the French number to 75,000 troops.{{sfn | Chandler | page= 410}}\n\nNapoleon's lure did not stop at that. On 25 November, General [[Anne Jean Marie Ren\u00e9 Savary|Savary]] was sent to the Allied headquarters at Olmutz to deliver Napoleon's message expressing his desire to avoid a battle, while secretly examining the Allied forces' situation. As expected, the overture was seen as a sign of weakness. When Francis I offered an armistice on the 27th, Napoleon accepted enthusiastically. On the same day, Napoleon ordered Soult to abandon both Austerlitz and the Pratzen Heights and, while doing so, to create an impression of chaos during the retreat that would induce the enemy to occupy the Heights.\n\nThe next day (28 November), the French Emperor requested a personal interview with Alexander I and received a visit from the Tsar's most impetuous aide, Prince [[Peter Petrovich Dolgorukov (general, born 1777)|Peter Dolgorukov]]. The meeting was another part of the trap, as Napoleon intentionally expressed anxiety and hesitation to his opponents. Dolgorukov reported to the Tsar an additional indication of French weakness.{{sfn | Chandler | page= 410\u2013411}}\n\nThe plan was successful. Many of the Allied officers, including the Tsar's aides and the Austrian Chief of Staff [[Franz von Weyrother]], strongly supported an immediate attack and appeared to sway Tsar Alexander.{{sfn | Chandler | page= 411}} Kutuzov's plan to retreat further to the [[Carpathian]] region was rejected, and the Allied forces soon fell into Napoleon's trap.\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Bivouac on the Eve of the Battle of Austerlitz, 1st December 1805.PNG|thumb|300px|alt=Colored painting showing French troops lighting torches for Napoleon. |Napoleon with his troops on the eve of battle. Painting by [[Louis-Fran\u00e7ois, Baron Lejeune]]]]\nThe battle began with the French army outnumbered. Napoleon had some 72,000 men and 157 guns for the impending battle, with about 7,000 troops under [[Louis Nicolas Davout|Davout]] still far to the south in the direction of Vienna.{{sfn | Uffindell | page= 19}}<ref name=\"nicholls910\">David Nicholls, ''Napoleon: a biographical companion'' pp. 9\u201310.</ref> The Allies had about 85,000 soldiers, seventy percent of them Russian, and 318 guns.{{sfn | Uffindell | page= 19}}\n\nAt first, Napoleon was not totally confident of victory. In a letter written to Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand]], Napoleon requested Talleyrand not tell anyone about the upcoming battle because he did not want to disturb Empress [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais|Jos\u00e9phine]]. According to Frederick C. Schneid, the French Emperor's chief worry was how he could explain to Jos\u00e9phine a French defeat.<ref name=\"schneid137\">Frederick C. Schneid, ''Napoleon's conquest of Europe: the War of the Third Coalition'', p. 137</ref>\n\n===Battlefield===\n\nThe battle took place about six miles (ten kilometers) southeast of the town of [[Brno]], between that town and Austerlitz ({{lang-cs|[[Slavkov u Brna]]}}) in what is now the Czech Republic. The northern part of the battlefield was dominated by the 700-foot (210-meter) Santon Hill and the 880-foot (270-meter) [[\u017dur\u00e1\u0148|Zuran (\u017dur\u00e1\u0148)]] Hill, both overlooking the vital [[Olomouc]]/Brno road, which was on an east/west axis. To the west of these two hills was the village of [[Bed\u0159ichovice|Bellowitz (Bed\u0159ichovice)]], and between them the Bosenitz (Roketnice) stream went south to link up with the Goldbach (\u0158\u00ed\u010dka) stream, the latter flowing by the villages of [[Kobylnice (Brno-Country District)|Kobelnitz (Kobylnice)]], [[Sokolnice|Sokolnitz (Sokolnice)]], and [[Telnice (Brno-Country District)|Telnitz (Telnice)]].\n\nThe centrepiece of the entire area was the [[Prace, Czech Republic|Pratzen (Prace)]] Heights, a gently sloping hill about 35 to 40 feet (10 to 12 meters) in height. An aide noted that Napoleon repeatedly told his marshals, \"Gentlemen, examine this ground carefully, it is going to be a battlefield; you will have a part to play upon it.\"{{sfn | Chandler | page= 412\u2013413}}\n\n===Allied plans and dispositions===\n\n[[File:Battle of Austerlitz, Situation at 1800, 1 December 1805.png|300px|thumb|right|alt=Map showing French troops concentrated to the west of the battlefield and the Allies to the east. |Allied (red) and French (blue) deployments at 1800 hours on 1 December 1805]]\nThe Allied council met on 1 December to discuss proposals for the battle. Most of the Allied strategists had two fundamental ideas in mind: making contact with the enemy and securing the southern flank that held the communication line to Vienna. Although the Tsar and his immediate entourage pushed hard for a battle, Emperor Francis of Austria was more cautious and, as mentioned, he was seconded by Kutuzov, the Commander-in-chief of the Russians and the Allied troops.{{sfn | Chandler | page= 416}} The pressure to fight from the Russian nobles and the Austrian commanders, however, was too strong, and the Allies adopted the plan of the Austrian Chief-of-Staff, [[Franz von Weyrother]].{{sfn | Chandler | page= 416}} This called for a main drive against the French right flank, which the Allies noticed was lightly guarded, and diversionary attacks against the French left. The Allies deployed most of their troops into four columns that would attack the French right. The [[Russian Imperial Guard]] was held in reserve while Russian troops under [[Pyotr Bagration|Bagration]] guarded the Allied right. The Russian Tsar rudely stripped the authority of Commander-in-chief M. I. Kutuzov and gave it to Franz von Weyrother. In the battle, Kutuzov could only command the IV Corps of the Allied army, although he was still the ''de facto'' commander because the Tsar was afraid to take over in case his favoured plan failed.<ref name=\"lvq10\"/>\n\n===French plans and dispositions===\n\n[[File:Cuirassiers 1805 Meissonier Chantilly.jpg|thumb|300px|French [[cuirassier]]s taking position]]\nNapoleon was hoping that the Allied forces would attack, and to encourage them, he deliberately weakened his right flank.<ref name=\"flank\">Richard Brooks (editor), ''Atlas of World Military History.'' p. 109</ref> On 28 November Napoleon met with his marshals at Imperial Headquarters, who informed him of their qualms about the forthcoming battle.

IV Corps' position was cloaked by dense mist during the early stage of the battle; in fact how long the mist lasted was vital to Napoleon's plan: Soult's troops would become uncovered if the mist dissipated too soon, but if it lingered too long, Napoleon would be unable to determine when the Allied troops had evacuated Pratzen Heights, preventing him from timing his attack properly.<ref name = barnes21>{{cite book |title= Napoleon Bonaparte: leadership, strategy, conflict |last= Gregory Fremont-Barnes |first= |year= 2010 |publisher= Osprey Publishing |location= Great Britain |isbn= 978-1-84603-458-9 |page= 21 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, to support his weak right flank, Napoleon ordered Davout's [[III Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)|III Corps]] to force march all the way from Vienna and join General [[Claude Legrand|Legrand's]] men, who held the extreme southern flank that would bear the heaviest part of the Allied attack. Davout's soldiers had 48 hours to march {{convert|110|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Their arrival was crucial in determining the success of the French plan. Indeed, the arrangement of Napoleon on the right flank was very risky as the French had only minimal troops garrisoning there. However, Napoleon was able to use such a risky plan because Davout\u2014the commander of III Corps\u2014was one of Napoleon's best marshals, because the right flank's position was protected by a complicated system of streams and lakes,<ref name=\"lvq10\"/> and because the French had already settled upon a secondary line of retreat through [[Brno|Brunn]].{{sfn | Chandler | page=412}} The [[French Imperial Guard|Imperial Guard]] and [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Bernadotte's]] I Corps were held in reserve while the V Corps under [[Jean Lannes|Lannes]] guarded the northern sector of the battlefield, where the new communication line was located.<ref name=\"lvq10\"/>\n\nBy 1 December 1805, the French troops had been shifted in accordance with the Allied movement southward, as Napoleon expected.<ref name = barnes19/>\n\n===Battle begins===\n\nThe battle began at about 8 a.m. with the first allied lines attacking the village of Telnitz, which was defended by the 3rd Line Regiment. This sector of the battlefield witnessed heavy fighting in this early action as several ferocious Allied charges evicted the French from the town and forced them onto the other side of the Goldbach. The first men of Davout's corps arrived at this time and threw the Allies out of Telnitz before they too were attacked by [[hussar]]s and re-abandoned the town. Additional Allied attacks out of Telnitz were checked by French artillery.<ref name=\"attacks\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 48\u201349</ref>\n\n[[File:Willewalde - Czar's Guard capture 4th line regiment's standard at Austerlitz.jpg|left|thumb|240px|Capture of a French regiment's eagle by the cavalry of the Russian guard, by [[Bogdan Willewalde]] (1884)]]\nAllied columns started pouring against the French right, but not at the desired speed, so the French were mostly successful in curbing the attacks. Actually, the Allied deployments were mistaken and poorly timed: cavalry detachments under [[Johann I Josef, Prince of Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein]] on the Allied left flank had to be placed in the right flank and in the process they ran into and slowed down part of the second column of infantry that was advancing towards the French right.<ref name=\"Fisher Fremont-Barnes 48\"/> At the time, the planners thought this slowing was disastrous, but later on it helped the Allies. Meanwhile, the leading elements of the second column were attacking the village of Sokolnitz, which was defended by the 26th Light Regiment and the ''[[Tirailleur]]s'', French [[skirmisher]]s. Initial Allied assaults proved unsuccessful and [[Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron|General Langeron]] ordered the bombardment of the village. This deadly barrage forced the French out, and at about the same time, the third column attacked the castle of Sokolnitz. The French, however, counterattacked and regained the village, only to be thrown out again. Conflict in this area ended temporarily when [[Louis Friant|Friant's]] division (part of III Corps) retook the village. Sokolnitz was perhaps the most fought over area in the battlefield and would change hands several times as the day progressed.<ref name=\"Fisher Fremont 49\">Todd Fisher & Gregory Fremont-Barnes, ''The Napoleonic Wars: The Rise and Fall of an Empire.'' p. 49</ref>\n\nWhile the allied troops attacked the French right flank, Kutuzov's IV Corp stopped at the Pratzen Heights and stayed still. Just like Napoleon, Kutuzov realized the importance of Pratzen and decided to protect the position. But the young Tsar did not, so he expelled the IV Corp from the Heights. This act quickly pushed the Allied army into her grave.<ref name=\"lvq10\"/>\n\n===\"One sharp blow and the war is over\"===\n\n[[File:Battle of Austerlitz - Situation at 0900, 2 December 1805.gif|300px|thumb|right|alt=Map with blue lines showing the French advance against the Allied center, symbolized with red lines. |The decisive attacks on the Allied center by [[Louis-Vincent-Joseph Le Blond de Saint-Hilaire|St. Hilaire]] and [[Dominique Vandamme|Vandamme]] split the Allied army in two and left the French in a golden strategic position to win the battle.]]\nAt about 8:45&nbsp;a.m., satisfied at the weakness in the enemy centre, Napoleon asked Soult how long it would take for his men to reach the Pratzen Heights, to which the Marshal replied, \"Less than twenty minutes, sire.\" About 15 minutes later, Napoleon ordered the attack, adding, \"One sharp blow and the war is over.\"{{sfn | Uffindell | page= 21}}\n\nA dense fog helped to cloud the advance of [[Louis-Vincent-Joseph Le Blond de Saint-Hilaire|St. Hilaire's]] French division, but as they went up the slope the legendary 'Sun of Austerlitz' ripped the mist apart and encouraged them forward.<ref name=\"Fisher Fremont 49\"/> Russian soldiers and commanders on top of the heights were stunned to see so many French troops coming towards them.{{sfn | Chandler | page=425}} Allied commanders moved some of the delayed detachments of the fourth column into this bitter struggle. Over an hour of fighting destroyed much of this unit. The other men from the second column, mostly inexperienced Austrians, also participated in the struggle and swung the numbers against one of the best fighting forces in the French army, eventually forcing them to withdraw down the slopes. However, gripped by desperation, St. Hilaire's men struck hard once more and bayoneted the Allies out of the heights. To the north, [[Dominique Vandamme|General Vandamme's]] division attacked an area called Star\u00e9 Vinohrady (\"Old Vineyards\") and, through talented skirmishing and deadly volleys, broke several Allied battalions.<ref name=\"sun\">Todd Fisher & Gregory Fremont-Barnes, ''The Napoleonic Wars: The Rise and Fall of an Empire.'' p. 49\u201350</ref>\n\nThe battle had firmly turned in France's favour, but it was far from over. Napoleon ordered Bernadotte's I Corps to support Vandamme's left and moved his own command center from \u017dur\u00e1\u0148 Hill to St. Anthony's Chapel on the Pratzen Heights. The difficult position of the Allies was confirmed by the decision to send in the [[Russian Imperial Guard]]; [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Constantine]], Tsar Alexander's brother, commanded the Guard and counterattacked in Vandamme's section of the field, forcing a bloody effort and the only loss of a French standard in the battle (a battalion of the 4th Line Regiment was defeated). Sensing trouble, Napoleon ordered his own heavy Guard cavalry forward. These men pulverized their Russian counterparts, but with both sides pouring in large masses of cavalry, no victory was clear.\n\nThe Russians had a numerical advantage but soon the tide swung as [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon|Drouet's]] Division, the 2nd of Bernadotte's I Corps, deployed on the flank of the action and allowed French cavalry to seek refuge behind their lines. The [[horse artillery]] of the Guard also inflicted heavy casualties on the Russian cavalry and fusiliers. The Russians broke and many died as they were pursued by the reinvigorated French cavalry for about a quarter of a mile.<ref name=\"broke\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 51</ref> The casualties of the Russians in Pratzen included Kutuzov, who was severely wounded, and his son-in-law [[Ferdinand von Tiesenhausen]] who was killed.<ref name=\"lvq10\">L\u00ea Vinh Qu\u1ed1c, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb Th\u01b0, L\u00ea Ph\u1ee5ng Ho\u00e0ng, pp. 154\u2013160</ref>\n\n===Endgame===\n\n{{quote|I was... under fierce and continuous canister fire...

Napoleon now had the option to strike at one of the wings, and he chose the Allied left since other enemy sectors had already been cleared or were conducting fighting retreats.]]\nMeanwhile, the northernmost part of the battlefield was also witnessing heavy fighting. [[Johann I Josef, Prince of Liechtenstein|Prince Liechtenstein's]] heavy cavalry began to assault [[Fran\u00e7ois \u00c9tienne de Kellermann|Kellerman's]] lighter cavalry forces after eventually arriving at the correct position in the field. The fighting initially went well for the French, but Kellerman's forces took cover behind General Caffarelli's infantry division once it became clear Russian numbers were too great. Caffarelli's men halted the Russian assaults and permitted [[Joachim Murat|Murat]] to send two cuirassier divisions (one commanded by [[Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul|d'Hautpoul]] and the other one by [[\u00c9tienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty|Nansouty]]) into the fray to finish off the Russian cavalry for good. The ensuing m\u00eal\u00e9e was bitter and long, but the French ultimately prevailed. Lannes then led his V Corps against [[Pyotr Bagration|Bagration's]] men and after hard fighting managed to drive the skilled Russian commander off the field. He wanted to pursue, but Murat, who was in control of this sector in the battlefield, was against the idea.<ref name=\"Fisher Fremont-Barnes 52\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 52</ref>\n\nNapoleon's focus now shifted towards the southern end of the battlefield where the French and the Allies were still fighting over Sokolnitz and Telnitz. In an effective double-pronged assault, St. Hilaire's division and part of Davout's III Corps smashed through the enemy at Sokolnitz, which persuaded the commanders of the first two columns, Generals [[Michael von Kienmayer|Kienmayer]] and [[Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron|Langeron]], to flee as fast as they could. [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden|Buxhowden]], the commander of the Allied left and the man responsible for leading the attack, was completely drunk and fled as well. Kienmayer covered his withdrawal with the [[Andreas O'Reilly von Ballinlough|O'Reilly]] light cavalry, who managed to defeat five of six French cavalry regiments before they too had to retreat.<ref name=\"Fisher Fremont-Barnes 52\"/>\n\nGeneral panic now seized the Allied army and it abandoned the field in all possible directions. A famous episode occurred during this retreat: Russian forces that had been defeated by the French right withdrew south towards Vienna via the Satschan frozen ponds. French artillery pounded towards the men, and the ice was broken due to the bombardment. The men drowned in the cold ponds, dozens of Russian artillery pieces going down with them. Estimates of how many guns were captured differ: there may have been as few as 38 or more than 100. Sources also differ about casualties, with figures ranging between 200 and 2,000 dead. Many drowning Russians were saved by their victorious foes.{{sfn | Chandler | page=432}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Rose|first=John Holland|authorlink=John Holland Rose|title=The Life of Napoleon I|publisher=G Bell and Sons|location=London|year=1910|edition=third|volume=2|pages=38|chapter=XXIII.

The French lost around 9,000 out of an army of 66,000, or about 13% of their forces. The Allies also lost some 180 guns and about 50 standards. The great victory was met by sheer amazement and delirium in Paris, where just days earlier the nation had been teetering on the brink of financial collapse. Napoleon wrote to [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais|Josephine]], \"I have beaten the Austro-Russian army commanded by the two emperors. I am a little weary....I embrace you.\"{{sfn | Chandler | page=432-433}}Napoleon's comments in this letter led to the battle's other famous designation, \"Battle of the Three Emperors.\" However, Emperor Francis of Austria was not present at the battlefield. Tsar Alexander perhaps best summed up the harsh times for the Allies by stating, \"We are babies in the hands of a giant.\"<ref name=\"giant\">Todd Fisher & Gregory Fremont-Barnes, ''The Napoleonic Wars: The Rise and Fall of an Empire.'' p. 54</ref> After hearing the news of Austerlitz, William Pitt referred to a map of Europe, \"Roll up that map; it will not be wanted these ten years.\"<ref>Stanhope's ''Life of the Rt Hon. William Pitt'' (1862), vol. iv, p.369</ref>\n\nFrance and Austria signed a truce on 4 December and the [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]] 22 days later took the latter out of the war. Austria agreed to recognize French territory captured by the treaties of [[Treaty of Campo Formio|Campo Formio]] (1797) and [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville|Lun\u00e9ville]] (1801), cede land to Bavaria, [[History of W\u00fcrttemberg#The Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg (1806\u20131918)|Wurttemberg]], and [[History of Baden|Baden]], which were Napoleon's German allies, and pay 40 million francs in war indemnities, and [[Venice]] was given to the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]]. It was a harsh end for Austria, but certainly not a catastrophic peace. The Russian army was allowed to withdraw to home territory and the French ensconced themselves in Southern Germany. The Holy Roman Empire was effectively wiped out, 1806 being seen as its final year. Napoleon created the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], a string of German states meant to serve as a buffer between France and Prussia. Prussia saw these and other moves as an affront to its status as the main power of Central Europe and it went to war with France in 1806.\n\n==Rewards==\n\nNapoleon's words to his troops after the battle were full of praise: ''Soldats! Je suis content de vous'' ({{lang-en|Soldiers! I am pleased with you}}).<ref name=nap01>''Napoleon's Proclamation following Austerlitz''. Dated 3 December 1805. Translated by Markham, J.

The home was purchased at about a $100,000 discount from its purchase price of a year earlier and included its furnishings. The seller was Marsha Lindsey, a lobbyist who advocated on behalf of a telecommunications company. Lindsey's loss was partly offset by her employer's retirement package. Pruitt and Whitefield both lived at the home while on business in the state capital. At the time, Whitefield was a registered lobbyist for industry-aligned groups that sought legislative changes to Oklahoma's [[workers' compensation]] laws; Pruitt was the major legislative supporter of these efforts.

Looking at a recent batch of documents released through a [[Sierra Club]] [[Freedom of information|FOI]] request, the ''New York Times'' commented that it appeared that the Pruitt schedulers divided people into \"friendly\" and \"unfriendly\" camps and noted one case where a meeting was kept so secret that even the meeting hosts were confused about it. Commenting on Pruitt's claim that his unusually extensive security expenses were related to his need for security, the ''New York Times'' said, \"[The documents] show that the agency's close control of Mr. Pruitt's events is driven more by a desire to avoid tough questions from the public than by concerns about security, contradicting Mr. Pruitt's longstanding defense of his secretiveness.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/climate/epa-pruitt-emails-secrecy.html|title='Smoke and Mirrors': Emails Detail Pruitt's Drive for Secrecy at the E.P.A.|last=Lipton|first=Eric|date=May 7, 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 18, 2018|last2=Friedman|first2=Lisa|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name=transparency /><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/11/climate/pruitt-cardinal-pell-dinner.html Pruitt's Dinner With Cardinal Accused of Abuse Was Kept Off Public Schedule], ''[[The New York Times]]'', Eric Lipton & Lisa Friedman, May 11, 2018.

House Democratic committee members requested details from the EPA about his plans to open a Tulsa office, citing ethical concerns. \"Establishing a new EPA office in Tulsa may be personally convenient for you, but it seems ethically questionable, professionally unnecessary, and financially unjustified,\" they wrote in a May letter to Pruitt. EPA staff emails said Pruitt required a \"secure cabinet or safe\" as well as a secure room to receive classified information from President Donald Trump and his cabinet members. He also wanted the latitude to work from home at times. They ventured that the \"optics\" of receiving donated office space would be a public relations problem for Pruitt.

Today IFOR counts 72 branches, groups and affiliates in 48 countries on all continents. IFOR members promote [[nonviolence]], [[human rights]] and [[reconciliation (ethnic relations)|reconciliation]] through public education efforts, training programs and campaigns. The IFOR International Secretariat in [[Utrecht|Alkmaar]], [[Netherlands]] facilitates communication among IFOR members, links branches to capacity building resources, provides training in gender-sensitive [[nonviolence]] through the Women Peacemakers Program, and helps coordinate international campaigns, delegations and urgent actions. IFOR has [[ECOSOC]] status at the [[United nations|United Nations]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins in wartime ===\nThe first body to use the name \"[[Fellowship of Reconciliation]]\" was formed as a result of a pact made in August 1914 at the outbreak of the [[First World War]] by two [[Christians]], [[Henry Hodgkin]] (an English [[Quaker]]) and [[Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze]] (a German [[Lutheran]]), who were participating in a [[Christian pacifism|Christian pacifist]] conference in [[Konstanz]], southern Germany (near Switzerland).  On the platform of the railway station at [[Cologne]], they pledged to each other that, \"We are one in Christ and can never be at war\".<ref>[[Peter Brock (historian)|Peter Brock]] and Nigel Young,\n''Pacifism in the Twentieth Century''. Syracuse University Press, New York, 1999 {{ISBN|0-8156-8125-9}}\n(p. 24).</ref>\n\nTo take that pledge forward, Hodgkin organised a conference in [[Cambridge]] in 1915 and founded the \"Fellowship of Reconciliation\" (FOR England).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.for.org.uk|title=Home - Fellowship of Reconciliation|date=16 October 2013}}</ref> The German branch, Vers\u00f6hnungsbund,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.versoehnungsbund.de/en|title=International Fellowship of Reconciliation - German Branch - Internationaler Vers\u00f6hnungsbund}}</ref> was founded later. It held its first conference in 1932, but in 1933, when Hitler came to power, it dissolved. Schultze was arrested twenty-seven times during World War I and was forced to live in exile during the Nazi period. FOR Germany was officially reestablished just in 1956 with Dr Siegmund Schultze as President.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forusa.org/content/rebel-passion-eighty-five-years-fellowship-reconciliation|title=The Rebel Passion: Eighty-Five Years of the Fellowship of Reconciliation - Fellowship of Reconciliation|access-date=25 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427004108/http://forusa.org/content/rebel-passion-eighty-five-years-fellowship-reconciliation|archive-date=27 April 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nShortly after the Cambridge conference, in the autumn of 1915, Henry Hodgkin went over to America and, 11 and 12 November, the American Fellowship<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forusa.org|title=Fellowship of Reconciliation - Working for peace, justice and nonviolence since 1915}}</ref> was founded during a Conference at Garden City, Long Island. More than a thousand members enrolled in the American Fellowship before and during the war, which, for the US, begun on 6 April 1917.\nBecause of the war, it was not possible to travel to other countries and the Fellowship of Reconciliation focused its activities on trying to influence public opinion, to help victims of war and war prisoners. 600 people in England went to prison for helping more than 16.000 imprisoned during the war.  When conscription began in Britain in 1916 and in the United States many FOR members refused military service.<ref>Vera Brittain, \"The Rebel Passion: a History of Some Pioneer Peace-Makers\", George Allen and Unwin ltd, London, 1964, p.40</ref>\n\n=== After World War one: strengthening the international movement ===\n[[File:1919-IFOR-c.png|thumb|First international gathering of International Fellowship of Reconciliation at [[Bilthoven]], Netherlands, in 1919.]]\n\nAfter the end of the war, in 1919, the different Fellowships of Reconciliation raised in those years all around Europe and in the USA agreed to found the International Fellowship of Reconciliation as an umbrella organisation to which they affiliated as members.  In October 1919 Christian pacifists from 10 different countries met in the Netherlands, in the town of Bilthoven, to establish the \"Movement Towards a Christian International\" later called \"International Fellowship of Reconciliation\".<ref>{{Citation | first = John | last = Ferguson | title = The Fellowship of Reconciliation |series=History| publisher = IFOR | journal = The Cambridge Review |date=December 1984 | url = http://www.ifor.org/articles/IFOR_history_by_J._Ferguson_1984_-_REVISED.pdf |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061004074828/http://www.ifor.org/articles/IFOR_history_by_J._Ferguson_1984_-_REVISED.pdf |archivedate=4 October 2006 }}.</ref> IFOR first secretary was the Swiss pacifist [[Pierre C\u00e9r\u00e9sole]] jailed several times for his peace witness. He established the [[International Voluntary Service for Peace#From reconciliation to emergency aid .281920.29|Service Civil]] (International Voluntary Service for Peace), initially organizing work camps in areas torn apart by war, with volunteers from former enemy countries. Relief for the victims of war was carried out, and international conferences and meetings spread the work of peace to many other parts of the globe.  Immediately after Bilthoven IFOR appointed travelling secretaries such as [[John Nevin Sayre]], [[Andr\u00e9 and Magda Trocm\u00e9|Andr\u00e9 Trocm\u00e9]], [[Muriel Lester]], Henri Rose and Percy Bartlett.  They travelled carrying the Fellowship's messages around Europe, in Scandinavia, Central Europe, Poland, the Baltic States and the Balkans, giving life to several international conferences that took place between the two world wars.  The first one gathered 200 delegates from 20 nations (also India, Burma and Ukraine) in Sonntagberg in Austria.<ref>{{Citation | first = Vera | last = Brittain | title = The Rebel Passion: A Short History of Some Pioneer Peace-Makers | publisher = George-Allen & Unwin | place = London | year = 1964 | page = 48}}.</ref> Many others followed and, in such a tense historical moment, IFOR members discussed about the necessity of disarmament and of a new role of Churches, asking clergymen to make a strong stand against the idea of \"righteous wars\".  In 1932, the IFOR led a Youth Crusade across Europe in support of the Geneva World Disarmament Conference.  Protestants and Catholics from all over converged on Geneva by various routes, reaching over 50,000 people and presenting to the Conference a petition calling for total disarmament among the nations.\n\n=== Ambassadors of Reconciliation ===\nAt the end of the 1930s, given the unstable international situation, IFOR established Embassies of Reconciliation that initiated peace efforts not only in Europe but in Japan and China as well.  \"Ambassadors of Reconciliation\", such as George Lansbury, [[Muriel Lester]] and Anne Seesholtz, visited many world leaders, including [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Benito Mussolini]], [[Leon Blum]] and [[Franklin D Roosevelt]].  Muriel Lester, English social worker, served as IFOR travelling secretary throughout the world, helping to establish its work in many countries. She met [[Mahatma Gandhi]], first in London when, in 1931, he spent some time at [[Kingsley Hall]], a community center with educational, social and recreational purposes, run by her and her sister Doris, and then in India when she went with him in Bihar on his anti-untouchability tour during 1934.  When [[World War II]] broke out, travels and communications became almost impossible. In many countries IFOR members suffered persecution for publicly preaching pacifism. IFOR's members, especially in America tried by inter-church mediation to find ways of ending the war, to help conscientious objectors, and struggled against internment of Japanese Americans.<ref>{{Citation | first = Vera | last = Brittain | title = The Rebel Passion: A Short History of Some Pioneer Peace-Makers | publisher = George-Allen & Unwin | place = London | year = 1964 | page = 59}}.</ref> In France, IFOR members [[Andr\u00e9 and Magda Trocm\u00e9]], with the help of the villagers of le [[Le Chambon-sur-Lignon|Chambon sur Lignon]], saved the lives of thousands of Jews escaping the Holocaust. In Belgium, feminist Magda Yoors Peeters defends Jewish refugees and conscientious objectors.\n\n=== Supporting nonviolent movements around the world ===\nAfter the war, travelling secretaries continued their work. IFOR branches and affiliates in Latin America, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East grew consistently also thanks to the work of [[Jean Goss]] and [[Hildegard Goss-Mayr]] from Paris and Vienna, three times nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].<ref name=\"pb\">{{citation |authorlink1=Peter Brock (historian) |first1=Peter |last1=Brock |first2=Nigel |last2=Young |title=Pacifism in the Twentieth Century |publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=New York |year=1999 |isbn=0-8156-8125-9 |pages=376\u20137 }}</ref> New Zealand pacifist [[Ormond Burton]] represented the IFOR in that nation.<ref>{{citation |first=John |last=Button |title=The Radicalism Handbook: Radical Activists, Groups and Movements of the Twentieth Century |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=1995 |isbn=0-87436-838-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/radicalismhandbo0000butt/page/119 119] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/radicalismhandbo0000butt/page/119 }}</ref> From such labors arose Servicio Paz y Justicia (SERPAJ)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.serpajamericalatina.org/|title=Home Page|access-date=25 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122032206/http://www.serpajamericalatina.org/|archive-date=22 January 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> throughout Latin America.

The Nonviolent Education Program<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nv-e.org/|title=*NVE - Non Violent Education*}}</ref> aims at supporting sustainable implementation of nonviolence/nonviolent education, peace education and violence prevention in compulsory kindergarten and school education and thus consequent implementation of Children's Rights expressed in the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]].  This is done through various presentations and training programs, as well as through the creation of resource materials and contact with trainers and resource people.\n\n=== Youth empowerment ===\nThanks to the Youth Working Group, IFOR provides young people with the skills and opportunities to become active peacemakers. This is done through nonviolence and leadership training, campaigning, and through internships with IFOR branches and groups, or with the International Secretariat.\n\n=== Interfaith cooperation ===\nReligion has on occasion played a central role in fomenting conflict but can also be a source of inspiration and leadership for peace. IFOR sponsors interfaith delegations to areas of conflict and publishes material on nonviolence from different religious traditions.\n\n=== Disarmament ===\nSince our founding, IFOR has opposed war and preparations for war. IFOR members support conscientious objectors, campaign for a ban on land mines, and oppose nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction. During their annual meeting, European members from different branches of the International Fellowship of Reconciliation issued the Declaration of Prali,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifor-mir.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Read-the-Declaration-of-Prali-on-Military-Spending.pdf|title=Read the Declaration of Prali on Military Spending|format=PDF|access-date=18 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508162432/http://www.ifor-mir.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Read-the-Declaration-of-Prali-on-Military-Spending.pdf|archive-date=8 May 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> in occasion of the Global day of Action on Military Spending,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://demilitarize.org/|title=Global Campaign on Military Spending - Cut Military Spending - Fund Human Needs}}</ref> 17 April 2012.  The Peace and Constitution Committee Working Group promotes actions to raise awareness on the [[article 9 of the Japanese Constitution]] which denounces war and war-preparation activities.\n\n=== Gender justice ===\nIn 2006 IFOR adopted a Gender Policy in which IFOR recognizes that there is a continuum of violence against women that must be confronted, from family violence in the private sphere to armed conflict in the public sphere. Unequal power relations between women and men are one root of violence, conflict and militarization, where women are often severely abused. Gender justice means that women and men can equally contribute to and benefit from peace building, non-violent conflict resolution and reconciliation.

Today IFOR counts 72 branches, groups and affiliates in 48 countries on all continents. IFOR members promote [[nonviolence]], [[human rights]] and [[reconciliation (ethnic relations)|reconciliation]] through public education efforts, training programs and campaigns. The IFOR International Secretariat in [[Alkmaar]], [[Netherlands]] facilitates communication among IFOR members, links branches to capacity building resources, provides training in gender-sensitive [[nonviolence]] through the Women Peacemakers Program, and helps coordinate international campaigns, delegations and urgent actions. IFOR has [[ECOSOC]] status at the [[United nations|United Nations]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins in wartime ===\nThe first body to use the name \"[[Fellowship of Reconciliation]]\" was formed as a result of a pact made in August 1914 at the outbreak of the [[First World War]] by two [[Christians]], [[Henry Hodgkin]] (an English [[Quaker]]) and [[Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze]] (a German [[Lutheran]]), who were participating in a [[Christian pacifism|Christian pacifist]] conference in [[Konstanz]], southern Germany (near Switzerland).  On the platform of the railway station at [[Cologne]], they pledged to each other that, \"We are one in Christ and can never be at war\".<ref>[[Peter Brock (historian)|Peter Brock]] and Nigel Young,\n''Pacifism in the Twentieth Century''. Syracuse University Press, New York, 1999 {{ISBN|0-8156-8125-9}}\n(p. 24).</ref>\n\nTo take that pledge forward, Hodgkin organised a conference in [[Cambridge]] in 1915 and founded the \"Fellowship of Reconciliation\" (FOR England).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.for.org.uk|title=Home - Fellowship of Reconciliation|date=16 October 2013}}</ref> The German branch, Vers\u00f6hnungsbund,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.versoehnungsbund.de/en|title=International Fellowship of Reconciliation - German Branch - Internationaler Vers\u00f6hnungsbund}}</ref> was founded later. It held its first conference in 1932, but in 1933, when Hitler came to power, it dissolved. Schultze was arrested twenty-seven times during World War I and was forced to live in exile during the Nazi period. FOR Germany was officially reestablished just in 1956 with Dr Siegmund Schultze as President.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forusa.org/content/rebel-passion-eighty-five-years-fellowship-reconciliation|title=The Rebel Passion: Eighty-Five Years of the Fellowship of Reconciliation - Fellowship of Reconciliation|access-date=25 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427004108/http://forusa.org/content/rebel-passion-eighty-five-years-fellowship-reconciliation|archive-date=27 April 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nShortly after the Cambridge conference, in the autumn of 1915, Henry Hodgkin went over to America and, 11 and 12 November, the American Fellowship<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forusa.org|title=Fellowship of Reconciliation - Working for peace, justice and nonviolence since 1915}}</ref> was founded during a Conference at Garden City, Long Island. More than a thousand members enrolled in the American Fellowship before and during the war, which, for the US, begun on 6 April 1917.\nBecause of the war, it was not possible to travel to other countries and the Fellowship of Reconciliation focused its activities on trying to influence public opinion, to help victims of war and war prisoners. 600 people in England went to prison for helping more than 16.000 imprisoned during the war.  When conscription began in Britain in 1916 and in the United States many FOR members refused military service.<ref>Vera Brittain, \"The Rebel Passion: a History of Some Pioneer Peace-Makers\", George Allen and Unwin ltd, London, 1964, p.40</ref>\n\n=== After World War one: strengthening the international movement ===\n[[File:1919-IFOR-c.png|thumb|First international gathering of International Fellowship of Reconciliation at [[Bilthoven]], Netherlands, in 1919.]]\n\nAfter the end of the war, in 1919, the different Fellowships of Reconciliation raised in those years all around Europe and in the USA agreed to found the International Fellowship of Reconciliation as an umbrella organisation to which they affiliated as members.  In October 1919 Christian pacifists from 10 different countries met in the Netherlands, in the town of Bilthoven, to establish the \"Movement Towards a Christian International\" later called \"International Fellowship of Reconciliation\".<ref>{{Citation | first = John | last = Ferguson | title = The Fellowship of Reconciliation |series=History| publisher = IFOR | journal = The Cambridge Review |date=December 1984 | url = http://www.ifor.org/articles/IFOR_history_by_J._Ferguson_1984_-_REVISED.pdf |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061004074828/http://www.ifor.org/articles/IFOR_history_by_J._Ferguson_1984_-_REVISED.pdf |archivedate=4 October 2006 }}.</ref> IFOR first secretary was the Swiss pacifist [[Pierre C\u00e9r\u00e9sole]] jailed several times for his peace witness. He established the [[International Voluntary Service for Peace#From reconciliation to emergency aid .281920.29|Service Civil]] (International Voluntary Service for Peace), initially organizing work camps in areas torn apart by war, with volunteers from former enemy countries. Relief for the victims of war was carried out, and international conferences and meetings spread the work of peace to many other parts of the globe.  Immediately after Bilthoven IFOR appointed travelling secretaries such as [[John Nevin Sayre]], [[Andr\u00e9 and Magda Trocm\u00e9|Andr\u00e9 Trocm\u00e9]], [[Muriel Lester]], Henri Rose and Percy Bartlett.  They travelled carrying the Fellowship's messages around Europe, in Scandinavia, Central Europe, Poland, the Baltic States and the Balkans, giving life to several international conferences that took place between the two world wars.  The first one gathered 200 delegates from 20 nations (also India, Burma and Ukraine) in Sonntagberg in Austria.<ref>{{Citation | first = Vera | last = Brittain | title = The Rebel Passion: A Short History of Some Pioneer Peace-Makers | publisher = George-Allen & Unwin | place = London | year = 1964 | page = 48}}.</ref> Many others followed and, in such a tense historical moment, IFOR members discussed about the necessity of disarmament and of a new role of Churches, asking clergymen to make a strong stand against the idea of \"righteous wars\".  In 1932, the IFOR led a Youth Crusade across Europe in support of the Geneva World Disarmament Conference.  Protestants and Catholics from all over converged on Geneva by various routes, reaching over 50,000 people and presenting to the Conference a petition calling for total disarmament among the nations.\n\n=== Ambassadors of Reconciliation ===\nAt the end of the 1930s, given the unstable international situation, IFOR established Embassies of Reconciliation that initiated peace efforts not only in Europe but in Japan and China as well.  \"Ambassadors of Reconciliation\", such as George Lansbury, [[Muriel Lester]] and Anne Seesholtz, visited many world leaders, including [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Benito Mussolini]], [[Leon Blum]] and [[Franklin D Roosevelt]].  Muriel Lester, English social worker, served as IFOR travelling secretary throughout the world, helping to establish its work in many countries. She met [[Mahatma Gandhi]], first in London when, in 1931, he spent some time at [[Kingsley Hall]], a community center with educational, social and recreational purposes, run by her and her sister Doris, and then in India when she went with him in Bihar on his anti-untouchability tour during 1934.  When [[World War II]] broke out, travels and communications became almost impossible. In many countries IFOR members suffered persecution for publicly preaching pacifism. IFOR's members, especially in America tried by inter-church mediation to find ways of ending the war, to help conscientious objectors, and struggled against internment of Japanese Americans.<ref>{{Citation | first = Vera | last = Brittain | title = The Rebel Passion: A Short History of Some Pioneer Peace-Makers | publisher = George-Allen & Unwin | place = London | year = 1964 | page = 59}}.</ref> In France, IFOR members [[Andr\u00e9 and Magda Trocm\u00e9]], with the help of the villagers of le [[Le Chambon-sur-Lignon|Chambon sur Lignon]], saved the lives of thousands of Jews escaping the Holocaust. In Belgium, feminist Magda Yoors Peeters defends Jewish refugees and conscientious objectors.\n\n=== Supporting nonviolent movements around the world ===\nAfter the war, travelling secretaries continued their work.

The Nonviolent Education Program<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nv-e.org/|title=*NVE - Non Violent Education*}}</ref> aims at supporting sustainable implementation of nonviolence/nonviolent education, peace education and violence prevention in compulsory kindergarten and school education and thus consequent implementation of Children's Rights expressed in the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]].  This is done through various presentations and training programs, as well as through the creation of resource materials and contact with trainers and resource people.\n\n=== Youth empowerment ===\nThanks to the Youth Working Group, IFOR provides young people with the skills and opportunities to become active peacemakers. This is done through nonviolence and leadership training, campaigning, and through internships with IFOR branches and groups, or with the International Secretariat.\n\n=== Interfaith cooperation ===\nReligion has on occasion played a central role in fomenting conflict but can also be a source of inspiration and leadership for peace. IFOR sponsors interfaith delegations to areas of conflict and publishes material on nonviolence from different religious traditions.\n\n=== Disarmament ===\nSince our founding, IFOR has opposed war and preparations for war. IFOR members support conscientious objectors, campaign for a ban on land mines, and oppose nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction. During their annual meeting, European members from different branches of the International Fellowship of Reconciliation issued the Declaration of Prali,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifor-mir.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Read-the-Declaration-of-Prali-on-Military-Spending.pdf|title=Read the Declaration of Prali on Military Spending|format=PDF|access-date=18 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508162432/http://www.ifor-mir.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Read-the-Declaration-of-Prali-on-Military-Spending.pdf|archive-date=8 May 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> in occasion of the Global day of Action on Military Spending,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://demilitarize.org/|title=Global Campaign on Military Spending - Cut Military Spending - Fund Human Needs}}</ref> 17 April 2012.  The Peace and Constitution Committee Working Group promotes actions to raise awareness on the [[article 9 of the Japanese Constitution]] which denounces war and war-preparation activities.\n\n=== Gender justice ===\nIn 2006 IFOR adopted a Gender Policy in which IFOR recognizes that there is a continuum of violence against women that must be confronted, from family violence in the private sphere to armed conflict in the public sphere. Unequal power relations between women and men are one root of violence, conflict and militarization, where women are often severely abused. Gender justice means that women and men can equally contribute to and benefit from peace building, non-violent conflict resolution and reconciliation.  This gender policy recognizes that gender equality is an integral part of IFOR's fundamental values and is a core spiritual value. A transformation of the power relations between women and men is a prerequisite for a culture of peace and non-violence, and must be promoted throughout IFOR.

The film stars [[Kim Basinger]] as Celeste, an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial woman]] sent on a secret mission to Earth, after her home planet's gravity is mistakenly disrupted by Steven Mills ([[Dan Aykroyd]]), a widowed scientist raising his daughter Jessie ([[Alyson Hannigan]]) as a [[single father]]. \n\nThe film's screenplay was written by [[Herschel Weingrod]], [[Timothy Harris (writer)|Timothy Harris]] and Jonathan Reynolds, based on an earlier script by Jericho Stone, who originally pitched the film to [[Paramount Pictures]] as a [[drama film|drama]] which would serve as an [[allegory]] about [[child abuse]]. When Paramount optioned the story, they suggested that it would be more believable as a comedy.<ref name=lawriters>{{cite news|title= A Writer's Close Encounter|publisher= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1989-02-02/entertainment/ca-2699_1_writer-s-close-encounter|accessdate=2012-06-07}}</ref><ref name=afi/> The film was unproduced for four years until [[Weintraub Entertainment Group]] put it into production in 1988.\n\n''My Stepmother Is an Alien'' was a [[box-office bomb]], grossing $13.8 million against a $19 million budget. The film also received negative reviews from critics, with most of the responses panning the film's humor and screenplay. Although, Basinger and costar [[Jon Lovitz]] generally received favorable reviews for their comedic performances. In ''[[the New York Times]]'' review, Aykroyd was singled out for criticism in his performance as a romantic lead.\n\n==Plot==\nCeleste ([[Kim Basinger]]) is an [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] sent on a secret mission to Earth, and Steven Mills ([[Dan Aykroyd]]) is a widowed scientist who is working on different ways to send radio waves into deep space. Steven accidentally sends a radio wave out of the galaxy to Celeste's home world (Cosine N to the 8th) which causes a disruption of gravity on her planet. She is sent to investigate who could affect gravity and how it was done, believing that it was an attack. She is aided by an alien device (called Bag) resembling a tentacle with an eye, which hides in a [[It Bag|designer purse]] to aid Celeste with her encounters on Earth. Bag is able to create any object, such as [[diamond]]s and [[Designer clothing|designer dresses]] almost instantaneously. Celeste crashes a party hosted by Steven's brother Ron ([[Jon Lovitz]]), where she immediately draws attention to herself by making dated references to old TV shows and political slogans under the mistaken belief that it was current (her superiors had just collected the information, which had taken 92 years to get from Earth to her home world).\n\nCeleste's inexperience almost results in her exposing herself as alien when she struggles with simple tasks like trying to kiss for the first time and cooking. She goes home with Steven and spends the night, after Bag teaches her what [[sexual intercourse|sex]] is (which she greatly enjoys). Jessie Mills ([[Alyson Hannigan]]), Steven's 13-year-old daughter, is at first happy that her father has found someone (her mother died five years previously) but becomes suspicious when she observes Celeste eating the acid out of batteries, and pulling hard boiled eggs out of boiling hot water with her bare hands. However, she cannot convince her smitten father that something is unusual about Celeste, and when Celeste tells him that she must leave in 24 hours he impulsively [[marriage proposal|proposes]], and she accepts. Ron also has his doubts about Celeste and tries to dissuade Steven from marrying Celeste on the idea she is an [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrant]] or planning [[Industrial espionage|economic espionage]], but then admits he is jealous his brother found his dream girl whereas he will never find a girl like [[Princess St\u00e9phanie of Monaco]].\n\nCeleste encounters new experiences such as sneezing and love. When finally confronted about being an extraterrestrial by Jessie, Celeste admits her home world is without emotion. Celeste plans to depart once she discovers how Steven created the radio signal and gets him to recreate it (which she says will reverse the gravity problems on her world), but is put in a quandary by Jessie, who says it will devastate her father, for whom Celeste has now developed feelings. After Jessie argues with Steven, she runs away and is nearly hit by a car, but is saved by Celeste's powers. This reveals to Steven that Celeste is indeed an alien and that she has fallen in love with him and accepted Jessie as her own daughter.\n\nSteven eventually realizes how he was able to create the radio wave and manages to repeat it, reversing the gravity on Celeste's planet and saving it. After destroying Bag (which tried to kill them), the leaders of Celeste's home world report in and ask her to destroy the planet Earth.

The film stars [[Kim Basinger]] as Celeste, an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial woman]] sent on a secret mission to Earth, after her home planet's gravity is mistakenly disrupted by Steven Mills ([[Dan Aykroyd]]), a widowed scientist raising his daughter Jessie ([[Alyson Hannigan]]) as a [[single father]]. \n\nThe film's screenplay was written by [[Herschel Weingrod]], [[Timothy Harris (writer)|Timothy Harris]] and Jonathan Reynolds, based on an earlier script by Jericho Stone, who originally pitched the film to [[Paramount Pictures]] as a [[drama film|drama]] which would serve as an [[allegory]] about [[child abuse]]. When Paramount optioned the story, they suggested that it would be more believable as a comedy.<ref name=lawriters>{{cite news|title= A Writer's Close Encounter|publisher= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1989-02-02/entertainment/ca-2699_1_writer-s-close-encounter|accessdate=2012-06-07}}</ref><ref name=afi/> The film was unproduced for four years until [[Weintraub Entertainment Group]] put it into production in 1988.\n\n''My Stepmother Is an Alien'' was a [[box-office bomb]], grossing $13.8 million against a $19 million budget. The film also received negative reviews from critics, with most of the responses panning the film's humor and screenplay. Although, Basinger and costar [[Jon Lovitz]] generally received favorable reviews for their comedic performances. In ''[[the New York Times]]'' review, Aykroyd was singled out for criticism in his performance as a romantic lead.\n\n==Plot==\nCeleste ([[Kim Basinger]]) is an [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] sent on a secret mission to Earth, and Steven Mills ([[Dan Aykroyd]]) is a widowed scientist who is working on different ways to send radio waves into deep space. Steven accidentally sends a radio wave out of the galaxy to Celeste's home world (Cosine N to the 8th) which causes a disruption of gravity on her planet. She is sent to investigate who could affect gravity and how it was done, believing that it was an attack. She is aided by an alien device (called Bag) resembling a tentacle with an eye, which hides in a [[It Bag|designer purse]] to aid Celeste with her encounters on Earth. Bag is able to create any object, such as [[diamond]]s and [[Designer clothing|designer dresses]] almost instantaneously. Celeste crashes a party hosted by Steven's brother Ron ([[Jon Lovitz]]), where she immediately draws attention to herself by making dated references to old TV shows and political slogans under the mistaken belief that it was current (her superiors had just collected the information, which had taken 92 years to get from Earth to her home world).\n\nCeleste's inexperience almost results in her exposing herself as alien when she struggles with simple tasks like trying to kiss for the first time and cooking. She goes home with Steven and spends the night, after Bag teaches her what [[sexual intercourse|sex]] is (which she greatly enjoys). Jessie Mills ([[Alyson Hannigan]]), Steven's 13-year-old daughter, is at first happy that her father has found someone (her mother died five years previously) but becomes suspicious when she observes Celeste eating the acid out of batteries, and pulling hard boiled eggs out of boiling hot water with her bare hands. However, she cannot convince her smitten father that something is unusual about Celeste, and when Celeste tells him that she must leave in 24 hours he impulsively [[marriage proposal|proposes]], and she accepts. Ron also has his doubts about Celeste and tries to dissuade Steven from marrying Celeste on the idea she is an [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrant]] or planning [[Industrial espionage|economic espionage]], but then admits he is jealous his brother found his dream girl whereas he will never find a girl like [[Princess St\u00e9phanie of Monaco]].\n\nCeleste encounters new experiences such as sneezing and love. When finally confronted about being an extraterrestrial by Jessie, Celeste admits her home world is without emotion. Celeste plans to depart once she discovers how Steven created the radio signal and gets him to recreate it (which she says will reverse the gravity problems on her world), but is put in a quandary by Jessie, who says it will devastate her father, for whom Celeste has now developed feelings. After Jessie argues with Steven, she runs away and is nearly hit by a car, but is saved by Celeste's powers. This reveals to Steven that Celeste is indeed an alien and that she has fallen in love with him and accepted Jessie as her own daughter.\n\nSteven eventually realizes how he was able to create the radio wave and manages to repeat it, reversing the gravity on Celeste's planet and saving it. After destroying Bag (which tried to kill them), the leaders of Celeste's home world report in and ask her to destroy the planet Earth. She and Steven manage to convince them it was not an act of aggression, but an accident, and that Earth has many benefits that require further studying. They accept the explanation and demand that Celeste return to explain human culture to them, but settle for a native of Earth to serve as ambassador to their world as a token of goodwill. The ambassadorship is accepted by Ron, who departs for Celeste's world in a spaceship served by several flight attendants, all of whom look like Princess St\u00e9phanie.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Dan Aykroyd]] as Steven Mills\n* [[Kim Basinger]] as Celeste Martin\n* [[Jon Lovitz]] as Ron Mills\n* [[Alyson Hannigan]] as Jessie Mills\n* [[Joseph Maher]] as Lucas Budlong\n* [[Seth Green]] as Fred Glass\n* [[Ann Prentiss]] as Voice of The Bag\n* [[Wesley Mann]] as Grady\n* [[Tony Jay]] as Council Chief\n* [[Peter Bromilow]] as Second in Command\n* [[Harry Shearer]] as Voice of [[Carl Sagan]]\n* [[Juliette Lewis]] as Lexie, Jessie's Friend\n\n==Production==\nScreenwriter Jerico Stone developed the story under the working title ''They\u2019re Coming'' as a [[drama film|drama]], an allegory about [[child abuse]].
