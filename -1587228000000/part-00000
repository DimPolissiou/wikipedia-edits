In 1988, several employees, angry about being placed on leave as punishment for talking to the plaintiff attorney, began speaking to the [[Nevada Gaming Control Board|Gaming Control Board]] and local media about two [[Nazi]]-themed parties Engelstad had held at the Imperial Palace. The parties were held in Engelstad's so-called \"war room\", which featured a large collection of World War II Nazi memorabilia, including a portrait of Engelstad in the likeness of Hitler. A national controversy ensued. Engelstad claimed the collection was purely of historical interest, and not meant to glorify the Nazis. The Gaming Control Board recommended that Engelstad lose his gaming license and be fined $200,000 for reflecting poorly on the reputation of the Nevada gaming industry. An agreement was ultimately reached whereby Engelstad kept his license, but paid $1.5 million in penalties.<ref name=burbank />\n\nIn 1985, the parking garage was expanded to include more than 1,000 additional parking spaces,<ref name= Steffner /> becoming one of the largest parking facilities in Las Vegas.<ref name=PlansExpansion>{{cite news |last= |first= |title=Imperial Palace plans expansion; 19-story tower, new pool included |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/405045083/ |work=Los Angeles Times |date=27 September 1987 |accessdate=28 August 2018|url-access=subscription |via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> In December 1985, the foundation was laid for a 560-room hotel addition,<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |title=On the Grow |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/148250417/ |work=Reno Gazette-Journal |date=22 December 1985 |accessdate=23 August 2018|url-access=subscription |via=Newspapers.com}}</ref> which was completed in 1986 as the resort's fourth tower, bringing the room count total to 2,100.<ref name= Steffner /> The Imperial Palace became the seventh [[List of largest hotels|largest hotel in the world]], and had more than 2,200 employees.

The Gaming Control Board recommended that Engelstad lose his gaming license and be fined $200,000 for reflecting poorly on the reputation of the Nevada gaming industry.
