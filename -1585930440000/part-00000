Written and directed by [[Alan Parker]], the film stars [[Mickey Rourke]], [[Robert De Niro]], [[Lisa Bonet]] and [[Charlotte Rampling]]. Harry Angel (Rourke), a [[New York City]] private investigator, is hired to solve the disappearance of a man known as Johnny Favorite. Angel's investigation takes him to [[New Orleans]], where he becomes embroiled in a series of brutal murders.\n\nFollowing publication of the novel, Hjortsberg began developing a screenplay for a film adaptation, but found that no [[film studio]] was willing to produce his script. The project resurfaced in 1985, when producer [[Elliott Kastner]] brought the book to Parker's attention. Parker began work on a new script, and in doing so, made several changes from Hjortsberg's novel. The [[independent film]] studio [[Carolco Pictures]] produced ''Angel Heart'' with a [[production budget|budget]] of $18 million. [[Principal photography]] commenced in March 1986 and concluded in June of that year; filming took place on location in [[New York City|New York]] and New Orleans.\n\nBefore its release, ''Angel Heart'' faced censorship issues from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] for one scene of sexual content. Parker was forced to remove ten seconds of footage to avoid an [[X rating|\"X\" rating]] and secure the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|\"R\" rating]] that the film's distributor [[TriStar Pictures|Tri-Star Pictures]] wanted. An unrated version featuring the removed footage was later released on home video. ''Angel Heart'' received mixed reviews and underperformed at the North American box office, grossing $17 million during its theatrical run.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1955, Harry Angel, a [[New York City]] [[private investigator]], is contracted by a man named Louis Cyphre to track down John Liebling, a [[crooner]] known professionally as \"Johnny Favorite\" who suffered severe [[Major trauma|neurological trauma]] resulting from injuries he received in [[World War II]]. Favorite's incapacity disrupted a contract with Cyphre regarding unspecified collateral, and Cyphre believes that a private upstate hospital where Favorite was receiving radical psychiatric treatment for [[shell shock]] has falsified records. Angel goes to the hospital and discovers that the records showing Favorite's transfer were indeed falsified by a physician named Albert Fowler. After Angel breaks into his home, Fowler admits that years ago he was bribed by a man and woman, so that the two could abscond with the disfigured Favorite. Believing that Fowler is still withholding information, Angel locks him in his bedroom, forcing him to suffer withdrawals from a morphine addiction. The next morning, he finds that the doctor has apparently committed suicide.\n\nAngel tries to break his contract with Cyphre, but agrees to continue the search when Cyphre offers him a large sum of money. He soon discovers that Favorite had a wealthy fianc\u00e9e named Margaret Krusemark but had also begun a secret love affair with a woman named Evangeline Proudfoot. Angel travels to [[New Orleans]] and meets with Margaret, who divulges little information, telling him that Favorite is dead, or at least dead to her. Angel then discovers that Evangeline died several years previously, but is survived by her 17-year-old daughter, Epiphany Proudfoot, who was conceived during her mother's love affair with Favorite. When Epiphany is reluctant to speak, Angel tracks down Toots Sweet, a [[blues]] guitarist and former Favorite bandmate. After Angel uses force to try to extract details of Favorite's last-known whereabouts, Toots refers him back to Margaret. The following morning, police detectives inform Angel that Toots has been murdered. Angel returns to Margaret's home, where he finds her murdered, her heart removed with a ceremonial knife. He is later attacked by enforcers of Ethan Krusemark\u2014a powerful Louisiana patriarch and Margaret's father\u2014who tell him to leave town.\n\nAngel returns to his hotel and finds Epiphany on his doorstep. He invites her into his room, where they have aggressive sex, during which Angel has visions of blood dripping from the ceiling and splashing around the room. He later confronts Krusemark in a [[gumbo]] hut, where the latter reveals that he and Margaret were the ones who took Favorite from the hospital. He also explains that Favorite was actually a powerful magician who [[Deal with the Devil|sold his soul to Satan]] in exchange for stardom.  He got his stardom but then sought to renege on the bargain. To do so, Favorite kidnapped a young soldier from [[Times Square]] and performed a [[Satanism|Satanic ritual]] on the boy, murdering him and eating his still-beating heart in order to steal his soul. Favorite planned to assume the identity of the murdered soldier but was drafted and then injured overseas.  Suffering severe facial trauma and amnesia, Favorite was sent to the hospital for treatment.  After Krusemark and his daughter took him from the hospital they left him at [[Times Square]] on New Year's Eve 1943 (the date on the falsified hospital records). Upon hearing Krusemark's story, Angel runs into the bathroom and vomits. He returns to find Krusemark drowned in a cauldron of boiling gumbo.\n\nAngel goes to Margaret's home, where he finds a vase containing the soldier's [[dog tag]] -- stamped with the name of Harold Angel. Angel cries out as he realizes that he and Johnny Favorite are, in fact, the same person. Cyphre then appears, and Angel deduces that \"Louis Cyphre\" is a [[homophone]] for [[Lucifer]]. Cyphre reveals his identity and proclaims that he can at long last claim what is his: Favorite's immortal soul. Angel insists that he knows who he is and has never killed anyone, but as he looks at his reflection in a mirror, his repressed memories come flooding back, showing him killing Fowler, Toots, the Krusemarks, and Epiphany. \n\nA frantic Angel returns to his hotel room, where the police have found Epiphany brutally raped and murdered.  Angel's dog tags are on her body.  A police officer enters the room carrying Epiphany's young son, who Angel realizes is his grandchild. The police detective tells Angel that he will \"burn\" for what he has done to Epiphany, to which Angel replies, \"I know. In [[Hell]].\" Angel sees the child's eyes glow, just as Cyphre's had at their last meeting.  During the [[end credits]], Angel is seen standing inside an iron [[Otis Elevator Company|Otis elevator]] which is interminably descending, presumably to Hell. As the screen fades to black, Cyphre can be heard whispering, \"Harry\" and \"Johnny\", claiming his dominion over both their souls.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|content=\n* [[Mickey Rourke]] as Harry Angel\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Louis Cyphre\n* [[Lisa Bonet]] as Epiphany Proudfoot\n* [[Charlotte Rampling]] as Margaret Krusemark\n* [[Stocker Fontelieu]] as Ethan Krusemark\n* [[Brownie McGhee]] as Toots Sweet\n* [[Michael Higgins (actor)|Michael Higgins]] as Dr. Albert Fowler\n* [[Elizabeth Whitcraft]] as Connie\n* [[Charles Gordone]] as Spider Simpson\n* [[Dann Florek]] as Herman Winesap\n* [[Kathleen Wilhoite]] as Nurse\n* [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]] as Detective [[Deimos (deity)|Deimos]]\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n{{quote box|quote=\"The original attraction was the fusion of two genres\u2014the detective film and the\nsupernatural.\"|source=\u2014Alan Parker, writer and director.<ref name=\"Parker\" /><ref>{{cite video| people = Parker, Alan|title = Audio commentary for ''Angel Heart'' |medium=[[Blu-ray disc]]|publisher=[[Lionsgate]], [[StudioCanal]]|date = November 24, 2009 }}</ref>|width=35%|}}\nFollowing publication of his 1978 novel ''[[Falling Angel]]'', [[William Hjortsberg]] began work on a [[film adaptation]].

He titled his script ''Angel Heart'' as he wanted to distance his film adaptation from the source material.<ref name=\"Essay\" /> While ''Falling Angel'' is set entirely in New York City, Parker had the second half of his script take place in New Orleans, based on the novel's perpetual allusions to [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] and the occult.<ref name=\"Parker\" /> He discussed the story setting change to Hjortsberg, who approved of the decision; the author revealed to Parker that he had also thought of setting his novel in New Orleans.<ref name=\"Essay\" /> ''Angel Heart'' is set in the year 1955, whereas in the book, the events take place in 1959. He explained, \"The book is set in 1959 and I moved it to 1955 for a small but selfish reason. 1959 was on the way to the 1960s with its changing attitudes as well as environments. 1955 for me still belonged to the 1940s\u2014and, because of the historical pause button of [[World War II]], conceivably the 1930s\u2014so quite simply, setting it in this year allowed me to give an older look to the film.\"<ref name=\"Essay\" />\n\nOther script changes from the novel involved characterization and dialogue. Parker sought to make Harry Angel a character that evoked sympathy. He said, \"In the tradition of the down-at-heel gumshoe, his phlegmatic surface disguised an intelligence capable of unraveling a complicated, larger-than-life story with a degree of belief and conciseness. Also he had to be attractive to audiences while enlightening them, little by little, along the way.\"<ref name=\"Essay\" /> Parker also established Angel as being born on February 14\u2014[[Valentine's Day]]\u2014the same date as his own birthday. He explained that it was \"for no particular reason other than Valentine\u2019s Day might be easy to remember in a labyrinthine script and the heart reference seemed to have some resonance\".<ref name=\"Essay\" /> Parker also wanted to create a realistic depiction of Louis Cyphre, as opposed to the character's \"larger-than-life\" personality in the novel.<ref name=\"Essay\" /> Another script change involved the ending and the identity of the killer. While Angel is framed for the murders (presumably by Cyphre) in the novel, Parker established the character as the killer for the film's ending.<ref name=\"Parker\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Mickey Rourke Tribeca 2009 Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mickey Rourke, who stars in the film.]]\nParker originally wanted [[Robert De Niro]] to play the role of Harry Angel, but the actor expressed interest in making a [[cameo appearance]] as mysterious benefactor [[Lucifer|Louis Cyphre]]. De Niro however did not fully commit to the role until after frequent discussions with Parker. The director reflected, \"I had been courting [De Niro] to play [Cyphre] in ''Angel Heart'' for some months and we had met a few times \u2014 and he had continued to bombard me with questions examining every dot and comma of my script. I had walked him through the locations we had found, read through the screenplay sitting on the floor of a dank, disused church in Harlem and finally he said \u2018yes\u2019.\"<ref name=\"Essay\" />\n\n[[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Mickey Rourke]] were also considered for the role of Angel. Parker met with Nicholson in Los Angeles to discuss the project. Nicholson ultimately passed on the role. Parker said, \"I did my [[pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] and he was most gracious, although, to be honest, he was quite distracted at the time...my movie and the possibility of him taking part seemed to slip from his immediate area of concentration and interest.\"<ref name=\"Essay\" /> Parker then met with Rourke, who expressed a strong interest in playing Angel and secured the leading role after a meeting with Parker in New York.<ref name=\"Parker\" /><ref name=\"Essay\" />\n\nVarious actresses auditioned for the role of Epiphany Proudfoot before [[Lisa Bonet]] secured the part.

Production designer Brian Morris and the set decorating team spent two months designing the set prior to filming, hoping to recreate 1950s New York. Because of the warm weather conditions, ice trucks were used to create fake snow.<ref name=\"Essay\" /> Filming then moved to [[Alphabet City, Manhattan|Alphabet City]] in Manhattan, where several bar scenes and Angel's intimate bedroom scene with Connie (Whitcraft) were filmed.<ref name=\"Essay\" />\n\nThe ''Angel Heart'' production team then moved to Harlem to film a chase scene set during a [[procession]] before moving to Coney Island, where the cast and crew underwent severely cold weather conditions. The location was used to film a scene in which Angel questions a man Izzy (George Buck) about the whereabouts of Johnny Favorite, while Izzy's wife Bo (Judith Drake) stands waist deep in the ocean. The original actress who was cast as Bo was injured when she was knocked off her feet by a wave while delivering her first line. The actress refused to reshoot the scene, which led to her being replaced by her stand-in, Drake, who Parker found to be a better actress for the role.<ref name=\"Essay\" />\n\nProduction returned to Manhattan to film the [[opening credits]] sequence.<ref name=\"Essay\" /> Filming then moved to Harlem, New York, where a [[hospice]] was used to film a scene involving the character Spider Simpson ([[Charles Gordone]]), and many of the hospice's elderly residents acted as extras for the scene.<ref name=\"Essay\" /> On April 17, 1986, the production team moved to Staten Island to film exterior and interior scenes involving the character Dr. Fowler (Michael Higgins). Filming then moved to [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], which doubled for a scene set in a New Orleans train station. From April 28 to April 29, 1986, the ''Angel Heart'' production team returned to Harlem, where Parker filmed Rourke and De Niro's scene in a Harlem [[Mission (Christianity)|mission]]. The two actors next filmed a scene at Lanza's, an Italian restaurant located on the [[Lower East Side]].<ref name=\"Essay\" />\n\nBy May 3, 1986, production had moved to New Orleans.<ref name=\"Essay\" /> In the town of [[Thibodaux, Louisiana]], Parker and his crew discovered an entire plantation workers' village that would serve as a graveyard. He said, \"We had the good fortune to find an entire plantation workers\u2019 village almost intact and, with careful dressing, this became Epiphany's world. The graveyard was a dressed set, but much of what we filmed was already there.\"<ref name=\"Essay\" /> An unused Louisiana field was used to create a racetrack where Angel meets the wealthy patriarch Ethan Krusemark (Fontelieu).<ref name=\"Essay\" /> On May 13, the crew encountered some difficulty filming a chase scene involving Angel, as they had to deal with shying horses, trained dogs, gunshots, two hundred chickens, and a horse specially trained to fall on top of Rourke\u2019s stuntman.<ref name=\"Parker\" /><ref name=\"Essay\" />\n\nProduction then moved to Magazine Street, where production designer Brian Morris and the art department attempted to recreate 1950s New Orleans. Parker said of the set, \"As in New York, we had dressed and clad every single storefront as far as the eye could see in order to be authentic to the period, and drained everything of all primary colours for our monochromatic look.\"<ref name=\"Essay\" /> Filming then moved to [[Jackson Square (New Orleans)|Jackson Square]] where the crew filmed one of the final scenes, in which Angel runs from Margaret's home.

Parker limited the crew down to himself, cinematographer Michael Seresin, camera operator Michael Roberts and the camera assistant. To make the actors more comfortable, Parker played music during the shoot.<ref name=\"Essay\" /> Production then moved to a corner of New Orleans, which doubled for flashback sequences set in 1943 [[Times Square]], New York.

Written and directed by [[Alan Parker]], the film stars [[Mickey Rourke]], [[Robert De Niro]], [[Lisa Bonet]] and [[Charlotte Rampling]]. Harry Angel (Rourke), a [[New York City]] private investigator, is hired to solve the disappearance of a man known as Johnny Favorite. Angel's investigation takes him to [[New Orleans]], where he becomes embroiled in a series of brutal murders.\n\nFollowing publication of the novel, Hjortsberg began developing a screenplay for a film adaptation, but found that no [[film studio]] was willing to produce his script. The project resurfaced in 1985, when producer [[Elliott Kastner]] brought the book to Parker's attention. Parker began work on a new script, and in doing so, made several changes from Hjortsberg's novel. The [[independent film]] studio [[Carolco Pictures]] produced ''Angel Heart'' with a [[production budget|budget]] of $18 million. [[Principal photography]] commenced in March 1986 and concluded in June of that year; filming took place on location in [[New York City|New York]] and New Orleans.\n\nBefore its release, ''Angel Heart'' faced censorship issues from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] for one scene of sexual content. Parker was forced to remove ten seconds of footage to avoid an [[X rating|\"X\" rating]] and secure the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|\"R\" rating]] that the film's distributor [[TriStar Pictures|Tri-Star Pictures]] wanted. An unrated version featuring the removed footage was later released on home video. ''Angel Heart'' received mixed reviews and underperformed at the North American box office, grossing $17 million during its theatrical run.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1955, Harry Angel, a [[New York City]] [[private investigator]], is contracted by a man named Louis Cyphre to track down John Liebling, a [[crooner]] known professionally as \"Johnny Favorite\" who suffered severe [[Major trauma|neurological trauma]] resulting from injuries he received in [[World War II]]. Favorite's incapacity disrupted a contract with Cyphre regarding unspecified collateral, and Cyphre believes that a private upstate hospital where Favorite was receiving radical psychiatric treatment for [[shell shock]] has falsified records. Angel goes to the hospital and discovers that the records showing Favorite's transfer were indeed falsified by a physician named Albert Fowler. After Angel breaks into his home, Fowler admits that years ago he was bribed by a man and woman, so that the two could abscond with the disfigured Favorite. Believing that Fowler is still withholding information, Angel locks him in his bedroom, forcing him to suffer withdrawals from a morphine addiction. The next morning, he finds that the doctor has apparently committed suicide.\n\nAngel tries to break his contract with Cyphre, but agrees to continue the search when Cyphre offers him a large sum of money. He soon discovers that Favorite had a wealthy fianc\u00e9e named Margaret Krusemark but had also begun a secret love affair with a woman named Evangeline Proudfoot. Angel travels to [[New Orleans]] and meets with Margaret, who divulges little information, telling him that Favorite is dead, or at least dead to her. Angel then discovers that Evangeline died several years previously, but is survived by her 17-year-old daughter, Epiphany Proudfoot, who was conceived during her mother's love affair with Favorite. When Epiphany is reluctant to speak, Angel tracks down Toots Sweet, a [[blues]] guitarist and former Favorite bandmate. After Angel uses force to try to extract details of Favorite's last-known whereabouts, Toots refers him back to Margaret. The following morning, police detectives inform Angel that Toots has been murdered. Angel returns to Margaret's home, where he finds her murdered, her heart removed with a ceremonial knife. He is later attacked by enforcers of Ethan Krusemark\u2014a powerful Louisiana patriarch and Margaret's father\u2014who tell him to leave town.\n\nAngel returns to his hotel and finds Epiphany on his doorstep. He invites her into his room, where they have aggressive sex, during which Angel has visions of blood dripping from the ceiling and splashing around the room. He later confronts Krusemark in a [[gumbo]] hut, where the latter reveals that he and Margaret were the ones who took Favorite from the hospital. He also explains that Favorite was actually a powerful magician who [[Deal with the Devil|sold his soul to Satan]] in exchange for stardom.  He got his stardom but then sought to renege on the bargain. To do so, Favorite kidnapped a young soldier from [[Times Square]] and performed a [[Satanism|Satanic ritual]] on the boy, murdering him and eating his still-beating heart in order to steal his soul. Favorite planned to assume the identity of the murdered soldier but was drafted and then injured overseas.  Suffering severe facial trauma and amnesia, Favorite was sent to the hospital for treatment.  After Krusemark and his daughter took him from the hospital they left him at [[Times Square]] on New Years Eve 1943 (the date on the falsified hospital records). Upon hearing Krusemark's story, Angel runs into the bathroom and vomits. He returns to find Krusemark drowned in a cauldron of boiling gumbo.\n\nAngel goes to Margaret's home, where he finds a vase containing the soldier's [[dog tag]] -- stamped with the name of Harold Angel. Angel cries out as he realizes that he and Johnny Favorite are, in fact, the same person. Cyphre then appears, and Angel deduces that \"Louis Cyphre\" is a [[homophone]] for [[Lucifer]]. Cyphre reveals his identity and proclaims that he can at long last claim what is his: Favorite's immortal soul. Angel insists that he knows who he is and has never killed anyone, but as he looks at his reflection in a mirror, his repressed memories come flooding back, showing him killing Fowler, Toots, the Krusemarks, and Epiphany. \n\nA frantic Angel returns to his hotel room, where the police have found Epiphany brutally raped and murdered.  Angel's dog tags are on her body.  A police officer enters the room carrying Epiphany's young son, who Angel realizes is his grandchild. The police detective tells Angel that he will \"burn\" for what he has done to Epiphany, to which Angel replies, \"I know. In [[Hell]].\" Angel sees the child's eyes glow, just as Cyphre's had at their last meeting.  During the [[end credits]], Angel is seen standing inside an iron [[Otis Elevator Company|Otis elevator]] which is interminably descending, presumably to Hell. As the screen fades to black, Cyphre can be heard whispering, \"Harry\" and \"Johnny\", claiming his dominion over both their souls.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|content=\n* [[Mickey Rourke]] as Harry Angel\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Louis Cyphre\n* [[Lisa Bonet]] as Epiphany Proudfoot\n* [[Charlotte Rampling]] as Margaret Krusemark\n* [[Stocker Fontelieu]] as Ethan Krusemark\n* [[Brownie McGhee]] as Toots Sweet\n* [[Michael Higgins (actor)|Michael Higgins]] as Dr. Albert Fowler\n* [[Elizabeth Whitcraft]] as Connie\n* [[Charles Gordone]] as Spider Simpson\n* [[Dann Florek]] as Herman Winesap\n* [[Kathleen Wilhoite]] as Nurse\n* [[Pruitt Taylor Vince]] as Detective [[Deimos (deity)|Deimos]]\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n{{quote box|quote=\"The original attraction was the fusion of two genres\u2014the detective film and the\nsupernatural.\"|source=\u2014Alan Parker, writer and director.<ref name=\"Parker\" /><ref>{{cite video| people = Parker, Alan|title = Audio commentary for ''Angel Heart'' |medium=[[Blu-ray disc]]|publisher=[[Lionsgate]], [[StudioCanal]]|date = November 24, 2009 }}</ref>|width=35%|}}\nFollowing publication of his 1978 novel ''[[Falling Angel]]'', [[William Hjortsberg]] began work on a [[film adaptation]].

He titled his script ''Angel Heart'' as he wanted to distance his film adaptation from the source material.<ref name=\"Essay\" /> While ''Falling Angel'' is set entirely in New York City, Parker had the second half of his script take place in New Orleans, based on the novel's perpetual allusions to [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] and the occult.<ref name=\"Parker\" /> He discussed the story setting change to Hjortsberg, who approved of the decision; the author revealed to Parker that he had also thought of setting his novel in New Orleans.<ref name=\"Essay\" /> ''Angel Heart'' is set in the year 1955, whereas in the book, the events take place in 1959. He explained, \"The book is set in 1959 and I moved it to 1955 for a small but selfish reason. 1959 was on the way to the 1960s with its changing attitudes as well as environments. 1955 for me still belonged to the 1940s\u2014and, because of the historical pause button of [[World War II]], conceivably the 1930s\u2014so quite simply, setting it in this year allowed me to give an older look to the film.\"<ref name=\"Essay\" />\n\nOther script changes from the novel involved characterization and dialogue. Parker sought to make Harry Angel a character that evoked sympathy. He said, \"In the tradition of the down-at-heel gumshoe, his phlegmatic surface disguised an intelligence capable of unraveling a complicated, larger-than-life story with a degree of belief and conciseness. Also he had to be attractive to audiences while enlightening them, little by little, along the way.\"<ref name=\"Essay\" /> Parker also established Angel as being born on February 14\u2014[[Valentine's Day]]\u2014the same date as his own birthday. He explained that it was \"for no particular reason other than Valentine\u2019s Day might be easy to remember in a labyrinthine script and the heart reference seemed to have some resonance\".<ref name=\"Essay\" /> Parker also wanted to create a realistic depiction of Louis Cyphre, as opposed to the character's \"larger-than-life\" personality in the novel.<ref name=\"Essay\" /> Another script change involved the ending and the identity of the killer. While Angel is framed for the murders (presumably by Cyphre) in the novel, Parker established the character as the killer for the film's ending.<ref name=\"Parker\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Mickey Rourke Tribeca 2009 Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mickey Rourke, who stars in the film.]]\nParker originally wanted [[Robert De Niro]] to play the role of Harry Angel, but the actor expressed interest in making a [[cameo appearance]] as mysterious benefactor [[Lucifer|Louis Cyphre]]. De Niro however did not fully commit to the role until after frequent discussions with Parker. The director reflected, \"I had been courting [De Niro] to play [Cyphre] in ''Angel Heart'' for some months and we had met a few times \u2014 and he had continued to bombard me with questions examining every dot and comma of my script. I had walked him through the locations we had found, read through the screenplay sitting on the floor of a dank, disused church in Harlem and finally he said \u2018yes\u2019.\"<ref name=\"Essay\" />\n\n[[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Mickey Rourke]] were also considered for the role of Angel. Parker met with Nicholson in Los Angeles to discuss the project. Nicholson ultimately passed on the role. Parker said, \"I did my [[pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] and he was most gracious, although, to be honest, he was quite distracted at the time...my movie and the possibility of him taking part seemed to slip from his immediate area of concentration and interest.\"<ref name=\"Essay\" /> Parker then met with Rourke, who expressed a strong interest in playing Angel and secured the leading role after a meeting with Parker in New York.<ref name=\"Parker\" /><ref name=\"Essay\" />\n\nVarious actresses auditioned for the role of Epiphany Proudfoot before [[Lisa Bonet]] secured the part.

It is narrated by [[Diana Nyad]].\n\nThe documentary, subtitled as ''No Drinking, No Drugs, No Lesbians'' is a Woman Vision film. Director Mosbacher, a lesbian feminist activist filmmaker and psychiatrist established Woman Vision as a nonprofit organization, to promote tolerance and equal treatment of all people through the production and use of educational media,\n\n''Training Rules'' examines how women's [[collegiate sports]], caught in a web of [[homophobia|homophobic]] practices, collude in the destruction of the lives and dreams of many of its most talented athletes. It focuses on the [[women's basketball]] program at [[Pennsylvania State University]] under head coach [[Rene Portland]] and her policy of discrimination on her players based on their [[sexual orientation]] over a 27-year period as coach of the university's basketball program, particularly from the 1980s to the late 1990s.\n\n==Characters==\nAccording to testimony in the documentary, Rene Portland, who became Penn State's women's basketball coach in 1980, was open with her recruits about her distaste for [[gay]] individuals. She set the policy as \"No Drinking, No Drugs, No Lesbians,\"<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dee-mosbacher/no-drinking-no-drugs-no-l_b_219250.html Director Dee Mosbacher's article in ''The Huffington Post'': \"No Drinking, No Drugs, No Lesbians: How homophobia still rules in sports\"]</ref> letting every player know that being a lesbian or associating with lesbians would not be tolerated under any circumstance.

In February 2007, when Portland and her co-defendants appeared on the verge of losing a legal judgment, the case was settled out of court.<ref name =\"tr\">{{cite AV media | url=http://www.trainingrules.com/training-rules.html | title=Training Rules | publisher=Woman Vision Productions | date=2009 | people=Dee Mosbacher and Fawn Yacker | medium=film | location=San Francisco, California}}</ref> Portland then resigned in March 2007.\n\nLisa Faloon, who was also interviewed in the documentary, says that Portland warned players that their scholarship would be canceled and they would never play basketball again if they talked to players suspended because of their sexual orientation. Cindy Davies was another talented young basketball player struggling with her sexuality in the 1980s. When interviewed for the documentary, she said that coach Portland threatened to [[outing|out]] her to her parents and to the media, as well as to expel her from the team. Davies left Penn State quietly. In 1986, Portland's views were first quoted in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'': \"I will not have lesbians on my team\".<ref>[http://trueslant.com/jodydiperna/2009/10/27/training-rules-an-examination-of-the-no-lesbians-policy-at-penn-state/ Jody Diperna article in TrueSlant: \"Training Rules, an examination of the 'No Lesbians' policy at Penn State]</ref>\n\n[[USA Today]]\u2019s Christine Brennan attempted to encapsulate the real problem by wondering what would have happened if Portland had had a different policy: \"I will not recruit black people.

It is narrated by [[Diana Nyad]].\n\nThe documentary, subtitled as ''No Drinking, No Drugs, No Lesbians'' is a Woman Vision film. Director Mosbacher, a lesbian feminist activist filmmaker and psychiatrist established Woman Vision as a nonprofit organization, to promote tolerance and equal treatment of all people through the production and use of educational media,\n\n''Training Rules'' examines how women's [[collegiate sports]], caught in a web of [[homophobia|homophobic]] practices, collude in the destruction of the lives and dreams of many of its most talented athletes. It focuses on the [[women's basketball]] program at [[Pennsylvania State University]] under head coach [[Rene Portland]] and her policy of discrimination on her players based on their [[sexual orientation]] over a 27-year period as coach of the university's basketball program, particularly from the 1980s to the late 1990s.\n\n==Characters==\nAccording to testimony in the documentary, Rene Portland, who became Penn State's women's basketball coach in 1980, was open with her recruits about her distaste for [[gay]] individuals. She set the policy as \"No Drinking, No Drugs, No Lesbians,\"<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dee-mosbacher/no-drinking-no-drugs-no-l_b_219250.html Director Dee Mosbacher's article in ''The Huffington Post'': \"No Drinking, No Drugs, No Lesbians: How homophobia still rules in sports\"]</ref> letting every player know that being a lesbian or associating with lesbians would not be tolerated under any circumstance.

In February 2007, when Portland and her co-defendants appeared on the verge of losing a legal judgment, the case was settled out of court.<ref name =\"tr\">{{cite AV media | url=http://www.trainingrules.com/training-rules.html | title=Training Rules | publisher=Woman Vision Productions | date=2009 | people=Dee Mosbacher and Fawn Yacker | medium=film | location=San Francisco, California}}</ref> Portland then resigned in March 2007.\n\nLisa Faloon, who was also interviewed in the documentary, says that Portland warned players that their scholarship would be canceled and they would never play basketball again if they talked to players suspended because of their sexual orientation. Cindy Davies was another talented young basketball player struggling with her sexuality in the 1980s. When interviewed for the documentary, she said that coach Portland threatened to [[outing|out]] her to her parents and to the media, as well as to expel her from the team. Davies left Penn State quietly. In 1986, Portland's views were first quoted in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'': \"I will not have lesbians on my team\".<ref>[http://trueslant.com/jodydiperna/2009/10/27/training-rules-an-examination-of-the-no-lesbians-policy-at-penn-state/ Jody Diperna article in TrueSlant: \"Training Rules, an examination of the 'No Lesbians' policy at Penn State]</ref>\n\n[[USA Today]]\u2019s Christine Brennan attempted to encapsulate the real problem by wondering what would have happened if Portland had had a different policy: \"I will not recruit black people.
