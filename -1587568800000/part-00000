The two routes overlapped between Bay Street and Spadina Avenue.<ref name=TTC-Guide-1965/>\n\nWhen subway [[Line 2 Bloor\u2013Danforth]] opened in 1966, the Harbord streetcar route was abandoned, and the Dundas streetcar route was extended eastward onto Dundas Street East and then north on Broadview Avenue to terminate at [[Broadview station]].<ref name=TTC-Guide-1966/> At the west end of the line, the Dundas streetcar still operated to the Runnymede Loop passing through [[Dundas West station]] in both directions. There was still a branch to the City Hall Loop where every second eastbound Dundas streetcar used to terminate and turn back.<ref name=TT-505/>\n\nIn 1968, the section of the Dundas streetcar line between Dundas West station and the Runnymede Loop was replaced by the 40 Junction bus.<ref name=TT-505/> Now, except for the branch to the City Hall Loop, the Dundas route became the same as today's 505 Dundas route.\n\nOn January 6, 1975, the City Hall Loop was closed due to construction of the [[Eaton Centre]]. Any downtown short-turning of eastbound Dundas streetcars was around an on-street loop: south on Church Street, west on Queen Street, north on Victoria Street then west on Dundas Street.<ref name=TT-505/>\n\nOn February 18, 2018, buses replaced streetcars due to a streetcar shortage,<ref name=TTC-SrvChg-2018-02-18/> and to reassign streetcars in order to address crowding on other routes.<ref name=G&M-2018-01-11/> Streetcar service was originally expected to return on on March 29, 2020, but was delayed to complete upgrades to the overhead infrastructure for pantograph operation.<ref name=\"TTC-2019-09-30\"/><ref name=\"TTC-2020-03\"/> On April 20, 2020, [[Flexity Outlook (Toronto streetcar)|Flexity Outlook]] streetcars went into service on 505 Dundas on the same day that streetcars were withdrawn from [[511 Bathurst]] due to construction projects.<!--mentioning 511 to explain how streetcars became available for 505 during a streetcar shortage--><ref name=\"TTC-2020-04\"/>\n\n==Sites along the line (from west to east)==\n* [[Kensington Market]]\n* [[Chinatown, Toronto|Chinatown]] at Spadina Avenue\n* [[Art Gallery of Ontario]]\n* [[Yonge\u2013Dundas Square]] and [[Toronto Eaton Centre]]\n* [[East Chinatown, Toronto|East Chinatown]] at Gerrard Street\n\n==See also==\n*[[Toronto streetcar system]]\n*[[Toronto Transit Commission]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist\n|refs=\n\n<ref name=TTC-Guide-1965>{{cite web |url=https://transit.toronto.on.ca/archives/maps/guide1965.gif |title=TTC Ride Guide 1965 |publisher=[[Toronto Transportation Commission]] |accessdate=January 24, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=TTC-Guide-1966>{{cite web |url=https://transit.toronto.on.ca/archives/maps/guide196602.jpg |title=TTC Ride Guide 1966 |publisher=[[Toronto Transportation Commission]] |accessdate=January 24, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=TT-505>{{cite web |url=https://transit.toronto.on.ca/streetcar/4104.shtml |title=Route 505 - The Dundas Streetcar |publisher=Transit Toronto |first=James |last=Bow |date=September 6, 2017 |accessdate=January 24, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=TTC-SrvChg-2018-02-18>{{cite web |url=http://www.ttc.ca/Service_Advisories/Service_changes/feb505.jsp |title=505 Dundas - Temporary bus replacement - Streetcar shortage |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |date=February 18, 2018 |accessdate=February 5, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190126141904/http://www.ttc.ca/Service_Advisories/Service_changes/feb505.jsp | archivedate=January 26, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=G&M-2018-01-11>{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/king-streetcar-sees-spectacular-rise-in-ridership/article37586434/ |title=Toronto's King streetcar sees 'spectacular' rise in ridership |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |first=Oliver |last=Moore |date=January 11, 2018 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"TTC-2019-09-30\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ttc.ca/Service_Advisories/Service_changes/Sep505.jsp |title=505 Dundas - Buses replace streetcars |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |date=September 30, 2019 |accessdate=March 7, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200307181153/http://www.ttc.ca/Service_Advisories/Service_changes/Sep505.jsp | archivedate=March 7, 2020 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"TTC-2020-03\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ttc.ca/Service_Advisories/Service_changes/Mar505.jsp |title=505 Dundas - Bus operation continues \u2013 Overhead upgrades |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |accessdate=March 28, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200328190737/http://www.ttc.ca/Service_Advisories/Service_changes/Mar505.jsp | archivedate=March 28, 2020 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"TTC-2020-04\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ttc.ca/Service_Advisories/Service_changes/505-511_Service_Changes.jsp |title=505 Dundas and 511 Bathurst service changes |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |date={{date|2020-04-20|mdy}} |accessdate={{date|2020-04-21|mdy}} |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200421182056/http://www.ttc.ca/Service_Advisories/Service_changes/505-511_Service_Changes.jsp | archivedate={{date|2020-04-21|mdy}} }}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|505 Dundas}}\n{{Attached KML |display=title,inline}}\n* [http://www.transit.toronto.on.ca/streetcar/4104.shtml 505 Dundas Route] (Transit Toronto)\n* [http://www3.ttc.ca/Routes/505/Map.jsp 505 Dundas map]\n* {{cite web |url=https://transit.toronto.on.ca/streetcar/4104.shtml |title=Route 505 - The Dundas Streetcar |publisher=Transit Toronto |first=James |last=Bow}}\n\n{{TTC}}\n\n[[Category:Streetcar routes in Toronto]]\n[[Category:4 ft 10\u215e in gauge railways]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/505_Dundas"}
