Lasting 14 seasons and 431 episodes, ''Bonanza'' is NBC's longest-running western, and ranks overall as the second-longest-running western series on [[United States|U.S.]] network television (behind CBS's ''[[Gunsmoke]]''), and within the top 10 longest-running, live-action American series. The show continues to air in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]]. The show is set in the 1860s and it centers on the wealthy Cartwright family who live in the vicinity of [[Virginia City, Nevada]], bordering [[Lake Tahoe]]. The series initially starred [[Lorne Greene]], [[Pernell Roberts]], [[Dan Blocker]] and [[Michael Landon]] and later featured (at various times) [[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy Williams]], [[David Canary]], [[Mitch Vogel]] and [[Tim Matheson]].

The map is oriented with North at the top (instead of East at the top, as in the map shown on the program).]]\n\nThe show chronicles the weekly adventures of the Cartwright family, headed by the thrice-widowed patriarch Ben Cartwright ([[Lorne Greene]]). He had three sons, each by a different wife: the eldest was the urbane architect Adam Cartwright ([[Pernell Roberts]]) who built the ranch house; the second was the warm and lovable giant Eric \"Hoss\" Cartwright ([[Dan Blocker]]); and the youngest was the hotheaded and impetuous Joseph or \"Little Joe\" ([[Michael Landon]]). Via exposition ([[List of Bonanza episodes#Ep1|S01:E01 \u2013 \"Rose for Lotta\"]]) and flashback episodes, each wife was accorded a different ancestry: English ([[List of Bonanza episodes#Ep65|S02:E65 \u2013 \"Elizabeth My Love\"]]), Swedish ([[List of Bonanza episodes#Ep95|S03:E95 \u2013 \"Inger My Love\"]]), and French Creole ([[List of Bonanza episodes#Ep120|S04:E120 \u2013 \"Marie My Love\"]]) respectively. The family's cook was Chinese immigrant Hop Sing ([[Victor Sen Yung]]). Greene, Roberts, Blocker, and Landon were billed equally; the opening credits would alternate the order among the four stars.\n\nThe family lived on a thousand square-mile (2,600&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) ranch called the [[Ponderosa Ranch|Ponderosa]] on the eastern shore of [[Lake Tahoe]] in [[Nevada]] opposite [[California]] on the edge of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] range.<ref>mentioned in first scene of first episode</ref> The vast size of the Cartwrights' land was quietly revised to \"half a million acres\" (2,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) on Lorne Greene's 1964 song, \"Saga of the Ponderosa.\" The ranch name refers to the [[ponderosa pine]], common in the West. The nearest town to the Ponderosa was [[Virginia City, Nevada|Virginia City]], where the Cartwrights would go to converse with [[Sheriff]] Roy Coffee (played by veteran actor [[Ray Teal]]), or his deputy Clem Foster ([[Bing Russell]]).\n\n''Bonanza'' was considered an atypical western for its time, as the core of the storylines dealt less about the range but more with Ben and his three dissimilar sons, how they cared for one another, their neighbors, and just causes. <blockquote>\"You always saw stories about family on comedies or on an anthology, but ''Bonanza'' was the first series that was week-to-week about a family and the troubles it went through. ''Bonanza'' was a period drama that attempted to confront contemporary social issues. That was very difficult to do on television. Most shows that tried to do it failed because the sponsors didn't like it, and the networks were nervous about getting letters\", explains Stephen Battaglio, a senior editor for ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://americanprofile.com/articles/bonanza-1960s-tv-show/ | title=''Bonanza'', a 1960s TV Show Ahead of the Times | author=Paulette Cohn | magazine=American Profile | date=May 24, 2009 | accessdate=May 20, 2016}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nEpisodes ranged from high drama (\"Bushwhacked\", episode #392, 1971; \"Shanklin\", episode #409, 1972), to broad comedy (\"Hoss and the Leprechauns\", episode #146, 1964; \"Mrs. Wharton and the Lesser Breeds\", episode #318, 1969; \"Caution, Bunny Crossing\", episode #358, 1969), and addressed issues such as the environment (\"Different Pines, Same Wind\", episode #304, 1968), [[substance abuse]] (\"The Hidden Enemy\", episode #424, 1972), [[domestic violence]] (\"First Love\", episode #427, 1972), anti-war sentiment (\"The Weary Willies\", episode #364, 1970), and [[illegitimate birth]]s (\"Love Child\", episode #370, 1970; \"Rock-A-Bye Hoss\", episode #393, 1971). The series sought to illustrate the cruelty of bigotry against: Asians (\"The Fear Merchants\", episode #27, 1960; \"The Lonely Man\", episode #404, 1971), [[African-American]]s (\"Enter Thomas Bowers\", episode #164, 1964; \"The Wish\", episode #326, 1968; \"Child\", episode #305, 1969), [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] (\"The Underdog\", episode #180, 1964; \"Terror at 2:00\", episode #384, 1970), [[Jews]], (\"Look to the Stars\", episode #90, 1962); Mormons (\"The Pursued\", episodes #239\u201340, 1966), the [[disabled]] (\"Tommy\", episode #249, 1966) and \"[[dwarfism|little people]]\" (\"It's A Small World\", episode #347, 1968).\n\nOriginally, the Cartwrights tended to be depicted as put-off by outsiders. Lorne Greene objected to this, pointing out that as the area's largest timber and livestock producer, the family should be less clannish. The producers agreed with this observation and changed the Cartwrights to be more amiable.\n\n==Cast==\nThough not familiar stars in 1959, the cast quickly became favorites of the first television generation. The order of billing at the beginning of the broadcast appeared to be shuffled randomly each week, with no relation whatsoever to the current episode featured that week. The main cast of actors portraying Cartwrights is listed here in the order of their characters' ages, followed by an array of recurring supporting players:\n\n===Lorne Greene \u2013 Ben Cartwright===\n[[File:Lorne Greene in Bonanza opening credit episode Bitter Water.jpg|thumb|[[Lorne Greene]] as Ben Cartwright]]\n\nBorn in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], Canada, to Russian-[[Jew]]ish parents,<ref name=\"biobooklinda\">{{cite book|last=Bennett|first=Linda Greene|title=My Father's Voice: The Biography of Lorne Greene|publisher=iUniverse, Inc.|date=November 1, 2004|edition=Paperback|page=254|isbn=978-0-595-33283-0|url=https://www.amazon.com/My-Fathers-Voice-Biography-Greene/dp/0595332838#reader}}</ref><ref name=\"BonanzaViewers\">''Bonanza: A Viewer's Guide to a TV Legend'', by David Greenland; R&G Productions</ref> [[Lorne Greene]] was chosen to play widowed patriarch Ben Cartwright. Early in the show's history, he recalls each of his late wives in flashback episodes. A standard practice with most westerns was to introduce some romance but avoid matrimony. Few media cowboys had on-screen wives. Any time one of the Cartwrights seriously courted a woman, she died from a malady, was abruptly slain, or left with someone else.\n\nGreene appeared in all but fourteen ''Bonanza'' episodes. Greene was 44 years old at the beginning of the series while Pernell Roberts and Dan Blocker, who portrayed two of his sons, were both 31, only thirteen years younger.\n\nIn 2007, a ''TV Guide'' survey listed Ben Cartwright as television's #2 favorite dad.<ref>''TV Guide Top 50 Dad's of All Time'', by Raisley Gordon, ''TV Guide'', 2007</ref>\n\n===Pernell Roberts \u2013 Adam Cartwright===\n[[File:Pernell Roberts in Bonanza opening credits episode Bitter Water.jpg|thumb|[[Pernell Roberts]] as Adam Cartwright]]\n[[Pernell Roberts]] played eldest son Adam, an architectural engineer with a university education.

Despite the show's success, Roberts departed the series after the 1964\u201365 season (202 episodes) and returned to stage productions.\n\nAttempts to replace Adam with Little Joe's maternal half-brother Clay ([[Barry Coe]]) and Cartwright cousin Will ([[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy \"Zorro\" Williams]]), were unsuccessful.<ref name=\"BonanzaScenery\">''Bonanza: Scenery of the Ponderosa'',- Candy Canaday</ref> Creator David Dortort introduced a storyline that would keep the character of Adam in the mix, but with a lighter schedule. During season five Adam falls for a widow with a young daughter, while making Will Cartwright a central figure. Roberts decided to stay an additional season, so the scripts were quickly revised by having Adam's fianc\u00e9e and her daughter depart the series prematurely with Guy Williams' Will, with whom she'd fallen in love. It was Landon, not Roberts, who objected to the infusion of any new Cartwrights.<ref name=\"BonanzaViewers\" /><ref name=\"BonanzaScenery\" /> After Roberts did leave the following year, it was eventually mentioned that Adam had gone \"to sea\", and in the later movies he had emigrated to Australia and had a son Adam 'A.C.' Cartwright, Jr. In mid 1972, the series producers considered inviting Roberts back in the wake of Dan Blocker's death: \"One suggestion was to return Pernell Roberts, who had played another Cartwright son when ''Bonanza'' first premiered on NBC fourteen years ago.

According to producer David Dortort: \"Over the years he gave me the least amount of trouble.\"<ref name=\"BonanzaViewers\" />[[File:Bonanza Dan Blocker.jpg|left|thumb|Dan Blocker as Hoss Cartwright]]In May 1972, Blocker died suddenly from a post-operative [[pulmonary embolism]] following surgery to remove his [[gall bladder]]. The producers felt nobody else could continue the role. It was the first time a TV show's [[Television producer|producers]] chose to kill off a young major male character (though it was done twice previously with young female leads\u2014in 1956 on ''[[Make Room For Daddy]]'', and again in 1963 with ''[[The Real McCoys]]''). Not until the TV movie ''[[Bonanza: The Next Generation]]'' was it explained that Hoss had drowned attempting to save a woman's life.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nAlthough \"big and lovable\", Blocker was also tough. Several years after his death, Landon appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and related the following anecdote. During the shooting of one episode, Blocker's horse stumbled and fell, throwing Blocker and breaking his collarbone. Blocker got up and the bone was actually protruding from his skin. The crew wanted to call an ambulance but Blocker refused and stuck the bone back in place himself and resumed filming. At the end of the day he was convinced to go to the hospital where they set the broken bone and gave him strict instructions, no riding for six weeks. According to Landon, evidently Blocker's horse forgot what it was like to carry the big man during his convalescence because the first time that Blocker swung up into the saddle on his return, the horse collapsed under his weight and the cast and crew collapsed in fits of laughter.{{Citation needed|date = November 2017}}\n\n===Michael Landon \u2013 Joseph \"Little Joe\" Cartwright===\n[[File:Michael Landon in Bonanza episode Showdown (2).jpg|thumb|[[Michael Landon]] as Little Joe Cartwright]]\n\nThe role of \"Little Joe\" was given to [[Michael Landon]]. \nHe played guest roles on several TV westerns and attained the title role in ''[[I Was a Teenage Werewolf]]''. He portrayed the youngest Cartwright son, whose mother (Felicia in the pilot, and later changed to Marie) was of French Creole descent. Landon began to develop his skills in writing and directing ''Bonanza'' episodes, starting with \"The Gamble.\" Most of the episodes Landon wrote and directed were dramas, including the two-hour, \"Forever\" (1972), which was recognized by ''TV Guide'' as being one of television's best specials (November 1993).{{vague|date=February 2014}} Landon's development was a bit stormy according to David Dortort, who felt that the actor grew more difficult during the last five seasons the show ran.<ref name=BearFamily>\"Bonanza\" four CD set biography notes, Bear Family Records</ref> Landon appeared in all but fourteen ''Bonanza'' episodes for its run, a total of 416 episodes.\n\nBeginning in 1962, a foundation was being laid to include another \"son\", as Pernell Roberts was displeased with his character. In the episode \"First Born\" (1962), viewers learn of Little Joe's older, maternal half-brother Clay Stafford. The character departed in that same episode, but left an opportunity for a return if needed. This character's paternity is open to debate. In the 1963 flashback episode \"Marie, My Love\", his father was Jean De'Marigny. Then in 1964, Lorne Greene released the song \"Saga of the Ponderosa\",<ref name=BearFamily/> wherein Marie's previous husband was \"Big Joe\" Collins, who dies saving Ben's life. After Ben consoles Marie, the two bond and marry. They choose to honor \"Big Joe\" by calling their son \"Little Joe\". So, whether to Stafford, De'Marigny or Collins, Marie Cartwright was previously married. In the last of the three Bonanza TV movies, it is revealed that \"Little Joe\" had died in the Spanish\u2013American War&nbsp;\u2013 a member of the \"[[Rough Riders]]\". Little Joe had a son Benjamin 'Benj' Cartwright who was seen in all three Bonanza TV movies.\n\n===Ray Teal \u2013 Sheriff Roy Coffee===\n\nVeteran character actor [[Ray Teal]] essayed the role of '''Sheriff Roy Coffee''' on 98 episodes from 1960 to 1972.<ref name=\"imdb.com\">imdb.com</ref> He appeared in more than 250 movies and some 90 television programs during his 37-year career. His longest-running role was as Sheriff Roy Coffee. He had also played a sheriff in the [[Billy Wilder]] film ''[[Ace in the Hole (1951 film)|Ace in the Hole]]'' (1951). Teal co-starred in numerous TV westerns throughout his career: he appeared five times on ''Cheyenne'', twice on ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]'', on ''[[The Alaskans]]'', a short-lived series starring [[Roger Moore]], three times in different roles on another long-running western series, ''[[Wagon Train]]'', on NBC's ''[[Tales of Wells Fargo]]'' with [[Dale Robertson]], on the ABC western series ''Broken Arrow'', five times on the ABC western comedy ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' starring [[James Garner]] and [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]], sometimes playing a villain, on the CBS western series ''[[The Texan (TV series)|The Texan]]'' with [[Rory Calhoun]], the NBC western series ''[[The Californians (TV series)|The Californians]]'', twice on ''[[Colt .45 (TV series)|Colt .45]]'' with [[Wayde Preston]], once on ''[[Wanted: Dead or Alive (TV series)|Wanted: Dead or Alive]]'' with [[Steve McQueen]] and as \"Sheriff Clay\" for a single 1960 episode of the NBC western series ''[[Riverboat (TV series)|Riverboat]]'' with [[Darren McGavin]], and four times on a western series about the rodeo entitled ''[[Wide Country (TV series)|Wide Country]]''.\n\nTeal was a bit-part player in western films for several years before landing a substantial role in ''[[Northwest Passage (1940 film)|Northwest Passage]]'' (1940) starring [[Spencer Tracy]]. Another of his roles was as [[Little John]] in ''[[The Bandit of Sherwood Forest]]'' (1946). Notable film roles include playing one of the judges in ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' (1961) with Spencer Tracy, and an indulgent bar owner to [[Marlon Brando]]'s motorcycle gang in ''[[The Wild One]]'' (1953), which was the second of three times that Teal appeared with Brando, having done so already as a drunk in Brando's debut in ''The Men'' (1950) and later in Brando's only directorial effort, ''[[One-Eyed Jacks]]'' (1961), as a bartender.\n\nSheriff Coffee was occasionally the focus of a plot as in the episode \"No Less a Man\" (broadcast March 15, 1964). A gang of thieves has been terrorizing towns around Virginia City and the town council wants to replace Coffee, whom they consider over-the-hill, with a younger sheriff before the gang hits town, not realizing that they'd been spared earlier because the gang's leader was wary of Coffee's longevity and only acquiesced to rob the Virginia City bank after extreme pressure from other gang members. Coffee ends up showing the town that youth and a fast gun don't replace experience.\n\n===Guy Williams \u2013 Will Cartwright===\n[[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy Williams]] was slated in 1964, the year that ''Bonanza'' hit #1 in the ratings, to replace Pernell Roberts upon Roberts' departure, enabling the series to preserve the four-Cartwright format for the run of the series. His character, Ben's nephew Will Cartwright, was introduced and was the lead character in five episodes, receiving \"Starring\" billing after the four original rotating Cartwrights during his second appearance going forward, but Roberts changed his mind later and decided to stay for one more season, whereupon Williams found himself pushed out of the part; it was rumored that Michael Landon and Lorne Greene felt threatened by the studio initiating a precedent of successfully replacing one heroic [[leading man]] Cartwright with a new one, particularly in view of Williams' popularity with viewers. Williams had previously portrayed the titular character in [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' television series, and went on to play the lead in ''[[Lost in Space]]'', a [[science fiction]] television series, after the role in ''Bonanza'' ended.\n\n===David Canary \u2013 \"Candy\" Canaday===\n\nAfter graduating from the [[University of Cincinnati]], [[David Canary]] was offered a left-end position with the [[Denver Broncos]],<ref name=BonanzaViewers/> but pursued acting and singing. In 1967, he joined the cast as \"Candy\" Canaday, a plucky Army brat turned cowboy,<ref>Bonanza, \"Sense of Duty\", episode 271, September 24, 1967</ref> who became the Cartwrights' confidant, [[ranch foreman]] and timber vessel captain. Dortort was impressed by Canary's talent, but the character vanished in September 1970, after Canary had a contract dispute. He returned two seasons later after co-star Dan Blocker's death, reportedly having been approached by Landon. Canary played the character on a total of 93 episodes.<ref name=\"imdb.com\"/> Canary joined the cast in Season 9.\n\n===Victor Sen Yung \u2013 Hop Sing===\n\n[[Chinese American]] actor [[Victor Sen Yung]] played the Cartwrights' happy-go-lucky cook, whose blood pressure rose when the family came late for dinner. Cast here as the faithful domestic, the [[comedy relief]] character had little to do beyond chores. He once used martial arts to assail a towering family foe.<ref>Bonanza, \"Stage Door Johnnies\", 7/28/68</ref> Though often referenced, Hop Sing only appeared in an average of eight to nine shows each season. As a semi-regular cast member, Sen Yung was only paid per episode. After 14 years, he was widely known, but making far less than his Ponderosa peers. The Hop Sing character was central in only two episodes: \"Mark Of Guilt\" (#316) and \"The Lonely Man\" (#404).\n\n===Mitch Vogel \u2013 Jamie Hunter/Cartwright===\n\nAfter Canary's departure in mid-1970, and aware of the show's aging demographic, the writers sought a fresh outlet for Ben's fatherly advice. Fourteen-year-old [[Mitch Vogel]] was introduced as [[Jamie Hunter Cartwright|Jamie Hunter]] in  \"A Matter of Faith\" (season 12, episode 363). Vogel played the red-haired orphan of a roving rainmaker, whom Ben takes in and [[adopt]]s later in a 1971 episode, called \"A Home for Jamie.\"\n\n===Tim Matheson \u2013 Griff King===\n\nDuring the final season, in 1972\u201373, [[Tim Matheson]] portrayed Griff King, a parolee who tries to reform his life as a worker at the [[Ponderosa Ranch]] under Ben Cartwright's tutelage.\n\n===Lou Frizzell \u2013 Dusty Rhodes===\n\nFollowing Canary's departure, Frizzell's character accompanied Jamie Hunter to the Ponderosa and became the Cartwright's foreman.\n\n===Cast episode count===\n(Of 431 total episodes)\n*Lorne Greene \u2013 Ben Cartwright \u2013 417 episodes (Season 1\u201314)\n*Michael Landon \u2013 Joseph \"Little Joe\" Cartwright \u2013 416 episodes (Season 1\u201314)\n*Dan Blocker \u2013 Eric \"Hoss\" Cartwright \u2013 401 episodes (Season 1\u201313)\n*Pernell Roberts \u2013 Adam Cartwright \u2013 173 episodes (Season 1\u20136)\n*Victor Sen Yung \u2013 Hop Sing \u2013 107 episodes (Season 1\u201314)\n*Ray Teal \u2013 Sheriff Coffee \u2013 98 episodes (Season 2\u201313)\n*David Canary \u2013 \"Candy\" Canaday \u2013 93 episodes (Season 9\u201311, 14)\n*Bing Russell \u2013 Deputy Clem Foster \u2013 57 episodes (Season 4\u20135, 7\u201314)\n*Mitch Vogel \u2013 Jamie Hunter Cartwright \u2013 47 episodes (Season 12\u201314)\n*Tim Matheson \u2013 Griff King \u2013 12 episodes (Season 14)\n*Lou Frizzell \u2013 Dusty Rhodes \u2013 11 episodes (Season 11\u201313)\n*Guy Williams \u2013 Will Cartwright \u2013 5 episodes (Season 5)\n\n==Episodes==\n{{further|List of Bonanza episodes}}\n{{:List of Bonanza episodes}}\n\n==Broadcast history and ratings==\n[[File:Lorne Greene Ben Cartwright Bonanza.JPG|thumb|right|Lorne Greene as Ben]]\nInitially, ''Bonanza'' aired on Saturdays at 7:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern, opposite \"Dick Clark's Saturday Night Beech-Nut Show\" and \"John Gunther's High Road\" on ABC, and ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' on CBS. ''Bonanza''{{'}}s initial ratings were respectable, often coming in behind Mason but ahead of the ABC line-up. Ironically, executives considered canceling the show before its premiere because of its high cost. NBC kept it because ''Bonanza'' was one of the first series to be filmed and broadcast in [[Color television|color]], including scenes of picturesque Lake Tahoe, Nevada. NBC's corporate parent, [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA), used the show to spur sales of RCA-manufactured color television sets (RCA was also the primary sponsor of the series during its first two seasons).\n\nNBC moved ''Bonanza'' to Sundays at 9:00&nbsp;pm Eastern with new sponsor [[Chevrolet]] (replacing ''[[The Dinah Shore Chevy Show]]''). The new time slot caused ''Bonanza'' to soar in the ratings, and it eventually reached number one by 1964, an honor it would keep until 1967 when it was seriously challenged by the socially daring [[variety show]], ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'' on [[CBS]]. By 1970, ''Bonanza'' was the first series to appear in the Top Five list for nine consecutive seasons (a record that would stand for many years) and thus established itself as the most consistent strong-performing hit television series of the 1960s. ''Bonanza'' remained high on the [[Nielsen ratings]] until 1971, when it finally fell out of the Top Ten.\n\nDuring the summer of 1972, NBC broadcast reruns of episodes of the show from the 1967\u20131970 era on Tuesdays at 7:30&nbsp;p.m. under the title ''Ponderosa'' while also rerunning more recent episodes on Sunday evenings in the show{{'}}s normal time slot as ''Bonanza''.<ref name=\"brooks\"/> In the fall of 1972, off-network episodes were released in [[broadcast syndication]] to local stations by NBC under the ''Ponderosa'' name.  After the series was canceled in 1973, the syndicated reruns reverted to the ''Bonanza'' name.\n\n==Awards==\n*1964: Logie Award for Most Popular Overseas Show (Australia)\n*1965: Primetime [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Individual Achievements in Entertainment \u2013 Color Consultant, Edward P.

The reason for this is twofold: it made duplication of wardrobe easier for stunt doubles (Hal Burton, Bob Miles, Bill Clark, Lyle Heisler, Ray Mazy) and it cut the cost of refilming action shots (such as riding clips in-between scenes), as previously shot stock footage could be reused. Below is a survey of costumes employed:\n\n* Ben Cartwright: Sandy shirt, tawny leather vest, gray pants, cream-colored hat, occasional green scarf.\n* Adam Cartwright: Black shirt, black or midnight blue pants, black hat. Elegant city wear. Cream-colored trail coat.\n* Hoss Cartwright: White shirt, brown suede vest, brown pants, large beige flat-brimmed, ten-gallon hat.\n* Little Joe Cartwright: Beige, light gray shirt, kelly-green jacket, tan pants, beige hat. Black leather gloves from 10th season on. In season 14, he and Greene occasionally wore different shirts and slacks, as the footage of them and the late Dan Blocker together could no longer be reused.\n*Candy Canaday: Crimson shirt, black pants, black leather vest, black hat, grey/ pale purple scarf.\n\nIt was not unusual for Little Joe Cartwright and Candy Canaday to appear shirtless in various scenes involving manual labor.\n\n===Hair styles===\nIn 1968, Blocker began wearing a toupee on the series, as he was approaching age 40 and his hair loss was becoming more evident. He joined the ranks of his fellow co-stars Roberts and Greene, both of whom had begun the series with hairpieces (Greene wore his modest frontal piece in private life too, whereas Roberts preferred not wearing his, even to rehearsals/[[Blocking (stage)|blocking]]). Landon was the only original cast member who was wig-free throughout the series, as even Sen Yung wore an attached rattail- [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]].<ref>Michael Landon, \"The Tonight Show\", NBC-TV, March 10, 1983</ref>\n\n===Theme song===\n[[File:Pernell Roberts Bonanza 1959.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pernell Roberts]] as Adam Cartwright (1959)]]\n[[File:Bonanza main cast 1959.JPG|thumb|left|Original cast: Dan Blocker, Michael Landon, Lorne Greene and Pernell Roberts (1959)]]\n[[File:Bonanza cast smiling horse 1968.JPG|thumb|right|Dan Blocker (Hoss), Michael Landon (Little Joe), Lorne Greene (Ben) and one of the ''Bonanza'' horses.]]\n''Bonanza'' features a memorable [[theme music|theme song]] by [[Jay Livingston]] and [[Ray Evans]] that was orchestrated by [[David Rose (songwriter)|David Rose]] and arranged by [[Billy May]] for the television series. Members of the [[Western Writers of America]] chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.<ref name=\"Top100\">{{Cite web |title=The Top 100 Western Songs |author=Western Writers of America |year=2010 |authorlink=Western Writers of America |publisher=American Cowboy |url=http://www.americancowboy.com/culture/top-100-western-songs |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813072851/http://americancowboy.com/culture/top-100-western-songs |archivedate=August 13, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nThe ''Bonanza'' theme song famously opens with a blazing Ponderosa map and saddlebound Cartwrights. The melodic intro, emulating galloping horses, is one of the most recognized television scores. Variations of the theme were used for 12 seasons on the series. Although there were two official sets of lyrics (some country-western singers, avoiding royalties, substituted the copyright renditions with their own words), the series simply used an instrumental theme. Three of the cast members bellowed-out the original lyrics, unaccompanied, at the close of the pilot (Pernell Roberts, the sole professional singer of the quartet, abstained and untethered the horse reins). Before the pilot aired (on September 12, 1959), the song sequence, deemed too campy, was edited out of the scene and instead the Cartwrights headed back to the ranch whooping and howling. In a 1964 song, the Livingston-Evans lyrics were revised by Lorne Greene with a more familial emphasis, \"on this land we put our brand, Cartwright is the name, fortune smiled the day we filed the Ponderosa claim\" (\"Bonanza\", Bear Family Box set, Disc #2). In 1968, a slightly revamped horn and percussion-heavy arrangement of the original score introduced the series- which was used until 1970. A new theme song, called \"The Big Bonanza\" was written in 1970 by episode scorer David Rose, and was used from 1970\u20131972. Action-shot pictorials of the cast replaced the galloping trio. Finally, a faster rendition of the original music returned for the 14th and final season, along with action shots of the cast.\n\nThe theme song has been recorded by numerous artists in a diverse variety of styles. The first recorded and released version was an instrumental by [[Marty Gold]], on his 1960 album ''Swingin' West''. This was followed by the February 1960 single by [[Buddy Morrow]] and his Orchestra, which included vocals. Morrow's version also appeared on his 1960 album ''Double Impact'' which featured several other then-recent television themes. In December 1960, another vocal version was issued only in the United Kingdom by [[Johnny Gregory (bandleader)]] and his Orchestra and Chorus released on the Fontana label. All aforementioned vocal versions, including the television pilot, used lyrics written by Livingston and Evans contained in the first published sheet music for the song, though not all the lyrics were sung. A ''Bonanza'' soundtrack album released in late 1961 included a version by David Rose; Rose also had a 1960 single and included the theme on his 1961 album ''Exodus'' in a different mix. The biggest hit version is a guitar instrumental by [[Al Caiola]], which reached number 19 on Billboard in 1961. Other versions were released by [[Billy Vaughn]], [[Valjean]], [[Lorne Greene]], [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Nelson Riddle]].\n\nCountry singer [[Johnny Cash]] was first to record a full length vocal version of the theme song. He and [[Johnny Western]] discarded the original Livingston and Evans lyrics, and wrote new ones, though the revised lyrics still make direct reference to the Cartwrights and the Ponderosa. The song first saw release by September 1962 as a single. Sometime after June 1963, it was released as a track on his sixteenth album: ''[[Ring of Fire: The Best of Johnny Cash]].'' This version was later covered by [[Faron Young]] for his 1963 album ''Aims at the West''. Singer [[:de:Ralf Paulsen|Ralf Paulsen]] recorded a German-language version of the song in 1963, released in mid-June 1963 on Capitol Records in the United States. His German version (lyrics attributed to \"Nicolas\") was sung in the same style and mood in which Cash had recorded it, and was fairly close in translation.\n\n[[Carlos Malcolm]] & His Afro-Jamaican Rhythms released a [[ska]] version of the song as \"Bonanza Ska\" on [[Trojan Records]] in 1964. This version was later covered by [[Bad Manners]] (1989) and the Hurtin' Buckaroos (1997). [[Michael Richards]], as Stanley Spadowski, sang a bit of the theme song while being held hostage by Channel 8's news goons in ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' (he did not know the words to the song he was originally supposed to sing, \"[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]\"). [[Michael Feinstein]] was the last to record the song in 2002 on his ''Songs of Evans and Livingston'' tribute CD. The ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'' theme (also by Rose), was heard first in a 1971 episode of ''Bonanza''. The overture for ''[[The High Chaparral]]'' composed by Harry Sukman can be heard briefly at the start of the 1966 episode \"Four Sisters from Boston\". On January 29, 2011, Marty Stuart and the Fabulous Superlatives performed the song on episode 56 of ''The Marty Stuart Show''. The band often includes the song in their live shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.martystuart.com/mss-1-29-11.htm |title=The Marty Stuart Show \u2013 Episode 56 \u2013 January 29, 2011 |publisher=Martystuart.com |date=2011-01-29 |accessdate=2014-06-28}}</ref>\n\n===Set===\n[[File:Bonanza-Ponderosa Ranch-postcard-03 (5619566355).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ponderosa tour postcard \u2013 visitors tour the replica ranchhouse and its big living room with stone fireplace overlooking the east shore of [[Lake Tahoe]], in [[Incline Village, Nevada]] where several rebuilt ranch buildings were used as a set for outside filming]]\n\nThe opening scene for the first season was shot at [[Lake Hemet]], a reservoir in the San Jacinto Mountains, Riverside County, California, and later moved to Lake Tahoe. During the first season extra horses were rented from the Idyllwild Stables in Idyllwild, also in the San Jacinto Mountains. The first Virginia City set was used on the show until 1970 and was located on a backlot at Paramount and featured in episodes of ''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel]]'', ''[[Mannix]]'', and ''[[The Brady Bunch]]''. In the 1970 premiere episode of the 12th season entitled \"The Night Virginia City Died\", Deputy Clem Foster's pyromaniac fianc\u00e9e levels the town in a series of fires (reflecting a real 1875 fire that destroyed three-quarters of Virginia City). This allowed for a switch to the less expensive Warner studios from September 1970 through January 1973. The script was initially written for the departing David Canary's Candy, but was rewritten for actors Ray Teal (Sheriff Roy Coffee) and Bing Russell (Deputy Clem Foster), who rarely appeared together on the show.\n\nThe program's Nevada set, the [[Ponderosa Ranch]] house, was recreated in [[Incline Village, Nevada]], in 1967, and remained a tourist attraction until its sale thirty-seven years later in September 2004.\n\nIt was partially filmed in [[Wildwood Regional Park]] in [[Thousand Oaks, California]].<ref>Schad, Jerry (2009).

Fourteen ''Bonanza'' novels have been published: ''Bonanza: A Novel'' by [[Noel Loomis]] (1960); ''Bonanza: One Man With Courage'' by Thomas Thompson (1966); ''Bonanza: Killer Lion'' by Steve Frazee (1966); ''Bonanza: Treachery Trail'' by Harry Whittington (1968); ''Winter Grass'' by Dean Owen (1968); ''Ponderosa Kill'' by Dean Owen (1968); ''The Pioneer Spirit'' by Stephen Calder (1988); ''The Ponderosa Empire'' by Stephen Calder (1991); ''Bonanza: The High Steel Hazard'' by Stephen Calder (1993); ''Journey of the Horse'' by Stephen Calder (1993); ''The Money Hole'' by Stephen Calder (1993); ''The Trail to Timberline'' by Stephen Calder (1994); ''Bonanza: Felling of the Sons'' by Monette L.

There is also a collection of Bonanza stories: ''The Best of Bonanza World: A Book of Favorite Stories,'' published by CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform (2012). ''Bonanza Gold'' (2003\u20132009), a quarterly magazine, featured detailed information about the show, including interviews with guest actors and other production personnel, articles about historical events and people depicted in the series, fan club information, and [[fan fiction]].  Seasons 1\u20138 (as of 06/2015) are available on DVD, as well as several non-successive public-domain episodes (sans original theme music). The prequel series, ''The Ponderosa'', as well as the three sequel movies (see below), are all available on DVD.\n\n==Cancellation and resurgence==\n[[File:Bonanza full cast 1962.JPG|thumb|right|Front to back: Pernell Roberts, Michael Landon, Dan Blocker and Lorne Greene]]\n\nIn the fall of 1972, NBC moved ''Bonanza'' to Tuesday nights&nbsp;\u2013 where reruns from the 1967\u20131970 period had aired the previous summer under the title ''Ponderosa''<ref name=\"brooks\"/>&nbsp;\u2013 opposite the ''[[All In The Family]]'' spinoff show, ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'', a virtual death sentence for the show. The scheduling change, as well as Dan Blocker's death several months earlier, resulted in plunging ratings for the show. David Canary returned to his former role of Candy (to offset Hoss' absence), and a new character named Griff King (played by [[Tim Matheson]]) was added to lure younger viewers. Griff, in prison for nearly killing his abusive stepfather, was paroled into Ben's custody and got a job as a ranch hand. Several episodes were built around his character, one that Matheson never had a chance to fully develop before the show's abrupt cancellation in November 1972 (with last episode airing January 16, 1973). Many fans, as well as both Landon and Greene, felt that the Hoss character was essential, as he was a nurturing, empathetic soul who rounded out the all-male cast.\n\nFor 14 years, the Cartwrights were the premier western family on American television and have aired on cable networks such as [[TV Land]], INSP, Family Channel, and the [[Hallmark Channel]]. The series currently airs on [[Me-TV]], [[TV Land]], [[The Inspiration Network|INSP]], and [[Encore (TV channel)|Encore Westerns]]. [[TV Land]] airs ''Bonanza'' from only the first season to the 1969\u20131970 season. INSP first aired only selected first and second-season episodes of ''Bonanza'' and began to air the ''Bonanza'' Lost Episodes packages which contains episodes that originally aired from 1965\u20131973. Family Channel and the [[Hallmark Channel]] were two other channels that have also only aired the ''Bonanza'' Lost Episodes package. In October 2015, Me-TV additionally began airing the ''Bonanza'' Lost Episodes package.<ref>[http://www.metv.com/videos/bonanza-lost-episodes-starts-monday/ ''Bonanza'' Lost Episodes \u2013 Starts Monday] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022150005/http://www.metv.com/videos/bonanza-lost-episodes-starts-monday/ |date=October 22, 2015 }} at MeTV.com</ref> As of December 2016, Me-TV returned to airing the original episodes package.  Ever since March 2018 Me-TV has been airing the Lost Episodes, wanting to play the entire series from beginning to end.\n\n===Television movies===\n''Bonanza'' was revived for three made-for-television movies featuring the Cartwrights' children: ''[[Bonanza: The Next Generation]]'' (1988), ''[[Bonanza: The Return]]'' (1993), and ''[[Bonanza: Under Attack]]'' (1995). [[Michael Landon Jr.]], played Little Joe's son Benji while [[Gillian Greene]], Lorne Greene's daughter, played a love interest. In the second movie, airing on NBC, a one-hour retrospective was done to introduce the drama. It was hosted by both Michael Landon Jr., and [[Dirk Blocker]], who looks and sounds almost exactly like his father Dan Blocker except that Dirk Blocker is not nearly as tall. According to the magazine ''[[TV Guide]]'', producer Dortort told Blocker he was too old to play the Hoss scion, but gave him the role of an unrelated newspaper reporter. Clips of his appearance were heavily used in advertisements promoting the \"second generation\" theme, perhaps misleading audiences to believe that Blocker was playing Hoss' heir. Hoss' son Josh was born out of wedlock, as it is explained that Hoss drowned without knowing his fianc\u0117e was pregnant. Such a storyline might have been problematic in the original series. (''[[The Big Valley]]'', however, had a major character in Heath, who was presented as illegitimate. The ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' movies of the early 1990s employed a similar theme when [[Marshal Matt Dillon]] learned he had sired [[Michael Learned]]'s character's daughter in a short-lived romance. The initial story was first introduced in 1973, when depiction of fornication courted protests, so CBS insisted their hero Matt have the encounter when he had amnesia.)\n\n===Prequel===\n:''For more, see: ''[[Ponderosa (TV series)]]''{{nbsp}}''\nIn 2001, there was an attempt to revive the ''Bonanza'' concept with a prequel, ''[[Ponderosa (TV series)|Ponderosa]]''&nbsp;\u2013 not to be confused with the 1972 summer reruns under the same title<ref name=\"brooks\"/>&nbsp;\u2013 with a pilot directed by [[Simon Wincer]] and filmed in Australia. Covering the time when the Cartwrights first arrived at the Ponderosa, when Adam and Hoss were teenagers and Joe a little boy, the series lasted 20 episodes and featured less gunfire and brawling than the original. ''Bonanza'' creator [[David Dortort]] approved PAX TV (now Ion TV)'s decision to hire [[Beth Sullivan]], formerly of ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]'', which some believe gave the series more depth as well as a softer edge. The Hop Sing character is depicted not only as a cook but also a family counselor and [[Phytotherapy|herbal healer]]. The series takes place in [[Nevada Territory]] in 1849, which is actually an anachronism.  The Nevada Territory did not split from the [[Utah Territory]] until 1861, meaning that until at least the 5th season (the episode \"Enter Thomas Bowers\" establishes that year as 1857), ''Bonanza'' is also set in what in real life would have been Utah Territory.\n\n===Home media===\n[[File:Dan Blocker Bonanza 1959.jpg|thumb|right|Hoss Cartwright (Dan Blocker) with 19th century home media]]\n{{Anchor|Home video and DVD releases|DVD|Video}}\nSeveral early episodes have fallen into the public domain. These episodes have been released by several companies in different configurations, with substandard picture and sound quality, edited, and by legal necessity with the copyright-protected Evans\u2013Livingston theme song replaced with generic western music.\n\nIn 1973, NBC licensed the distribution rights to the series, along with the rest of its pre-1973 library, to [[National Telefilm Associates]], which changed its name to Republic Pictures in 1986. Republic would become part of the [[Spelling Television|Spelling Entertainment]] organization in 1994 through [[Worldvision Enterprises]]. Select episodes (\"The Best of Bonanza\") were officially released in North America in 2003 on DVD through then-Republic video licensee [[Artisan Entertainment]] (which was later purchased by [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate Home Entertainment]]). Republic (through [[CBS Television Distribution]], which holds the television side of Republic's holdings) still retains the syndication distribution rights to the series. [[CBS Home Entertainment]] (under [[Paramount Home Media Distribution]]) is the official home video rights distributor at present.\n\nStarting in September 2009, [[CBS Home Entertainment]] (distributed by [[Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount]]) has to date released the first ten seasons on DVD in Region 1. All episodes have been digitally remastered from original 35mm film elements to yield the best picture and sound quality possible with current technology. CBSHE has released each season in two-volume sets (available together and separately). Each and every set contains exclusive multiple and rare bonus features, more than any other vintage long-running television series released on DVD. Classic series collections usually have bonus features included with the first season release only, if at all.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nIn Region 2, ''AL!VE AG'' released the first seven seasons on DVD in Germany between 2008\u20132010.  These releases are now out of print as AL!VE has lost the rights.  In 2011, [[StudioCanal]] acquired the rights to the series and have begun re-releasing it on DVD, and all seasons have now been released but have not been remastered.\n\nEpisodes of the series have also been officially released as part-works on DVD in France and the United Kingdom.\n\n''Bonanza'' \"the official first season\" was released in [[Scandinavia]] during 2010. The first season is released in 4 volumes. The first two volumes were released on October 20, 2010, and the second two volumes on April 27, 2011.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Region 1 DVD releases of ''Bonanza''\n|-\n! DVD name\n!

Lasting 14 seasons and 431 episodes, ''Bonanza'' is NBC's longest-running western, and ranks overall as the second-longest-running western series on [[United States|U.S.]] network television (behind CBS's ''[[Gunsmoke]]''), and within the top 10 longest-running, live-action American series. The show continues to air in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]]. The show is set in the 1860s and it centers on the wealthy Cartwright family who live in the vicinity of [[Virginia City, Nevada]], bordering [[Lake Tahoe]]. The series initially starred [[Lorne Greene]], [[Pernell Roberts]], [[Dan Blocker]] and [[Michael Landon]] and later featured (at various times) [[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy Williams]], [[David Canary]], [[Mitch Vogel]] and [[Tim Matheson]]. The show is known for presenting pressing moral dilemmas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlinenevada.org/articles/bonanza-television-show|title=Bonanza Television Show \u2013 ONE|website=www.onlinenevada.org}}</ref>\n\nThe title \"Bonanza\" is a term used by miners in regard to a large vein or deposit of silver ore,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bonanza |title=Bonanza \u2013 Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |accessdate=March 7, 2012}}</ref> from Spanish ''bonanza'' (prosperity) and commonly refers to the 1859 revelation of the [[Comstock Lode]] of rich silver ore mines under the town of Virginia City, not far from the fictional [[Ponderosa Ranch]] that the Cartwright family operated. The show's theme song, also titled \"Bonanza\", became a hit song.

The map is oriented with North at the top (instead of East at the top, as in the map shown on the program).]]\n\nThe show chronicles the weekly adventures of the Cartwright family, headed by the thrice-widowed patriarch Ben Cartwright ([[Lorne Greene]]). He had three sons, each by a different wife: the eldest was the urbane architect Adam Cartwright ([[Pernell Roberts]]) who built the ranch house; the second was the warm and lovable giant Eric \"Hoss\" Cartwright ([[Dan Blocker]]); and the youngest was the hotheaded and impetuous Joseph or \"Little Joe\" ([[Michael Landon]]). Via exposition ([[List of Bonanza episodes#Ep1|S01:E01 \u2013 \"Rose for Lotta\"]]) and flashback episodes, each wife was accorded a different ancestry: English ([[List of Bonanza episodes#Ep65|S02:E65 \u2013 \"Elizabeth My Love\"]]), Swedish ([[List of Bonanza episodes#Ep95|S03:E95 \u2013 \"Inger My Love\"]]), and French Creole ([[List of Bonanza episodes#Ep120|S04:E120 \u2013 \"Marie My Love\"]]) respectively. The family's cook was Chinese immigrant Hop Sing ([[Victor Sen Yung]]). Greene, Roberts, Blocker, and Landon were billed equally; the opening credits would alternate the order among the four stars.\n\nThe family lived on a thousand square-mile (2,600&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) ranch called the [[Ponderosa Ranch|Ponderosa]] on the eastern shore of [[Lake Tahoe]] in [[Nevada]] opposite [[California]] on the edge of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] range.<ref>mentioned in first scene of first episode</ref> The vast size of the Cartwrights' land was quietly revised to \"half a million acres\" (2,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) on Lorne Greene's 1964 song, \"Saga of the Ponderosa.\" The ranch name refers to the [[ponderosa pine]], common in the West. The nearest town to the Ponderosa was [[Virginia City, Nevada|Virginia City]], where the Cartwrights would go to converse with [[Sheriff]] Roy Coffee (played by veteran actor [[Ray Teal]]), or his deputy Clem Foster ([[Bing Russell]]).\n\n''Bonanza'' was considered an atypical western for its time, as the core of the storylines dealt less about the range but more with Ben and his three dissimilar sons, how they cared for one another, their neighbors, and just causes. <blockquote>\"You always saw stories about family on comedies or on an anthology, but ''Bonanza'' was the first series that was week-to-week about a family and the troubles it went through. ''Bonanza'' was a period drama that attempted to confront contemporary social issues. That was very difficult to do on television. Most shows that tried to do it failed because the sponsors didn't like it, and the networks were nervous about getting letters\", explains Stephen Battaglio, a senior editor for ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://americanprofile.com/articles/bonanza-1960s-tv-show/ | title=''Bonanza'', a 1960s TV Show Ahead of the Times | author=Paulette Cohn | magazine=American Profile | date=May 24, 2009 | accessdate=May 20, 2016}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nEpisodes ranged from high drama (\"Bushwhacked\", episode #392, 1971; \"Shanklin\", episode #409, 1972), to broad comedy (\"Hoss and the Leprechauns\", episode #146, 1964; \"Mrs. Wharton and the Lesser Breeds\", episode #318, 1969; \"Caution, Bunny Crossing\", episode #358, 1969), and addressed issues such as the environment (\"Different Pines, Same Wind\", episode #304, 1968), [[substance abuse]] (\"The Hidden Enemy\", episode #424, 1972), [[domestic violence]] (\"First Love\", episode #427, 1972), anti-war sentiment (\"The Weary Willies\", episode #364, 1970), and [[illegitimate birth]]s (\"Love Child\", episode #370, 1970; \"Rock-A-Bye Hoss\", episode #393, 1971). The series sought to illustrate the cruelty of bigotry against: Asians (\"The Fear Merchants\", episode #27, 1960; \"The Lonely Man\", episode #404, 1971), [[African-American]]s (\"Enter Thomas Bowers\", episode #164, 1964; \"The Wish\", episode #326, 1968; \"Child\", episode #305, 1969), [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] (\"The Underdog\", episode #180, 1964; \"Terror at 2:00\", episode #384, 1970), [[Jews]], (\"Look to the Stars\", episode #90, 1962); Mormons (\"The Pursued\", episodes #239\u201340, 1966), the [[disabled]] (\"Tommy\", episode #249, 1966) and \"[[dwarfism|little people]]\" (\"It's A Small World\", episode #347, 1968).\n\nOriginally, the Cartwrights tended to be depicted as put-off by outsiders. Lorne Greene objected to this, pointing out that as the area's largest timber and livestock producer, the family should be less clannish. The producers agreed with this observation and changed the Cartwrights to be more amiable.\n\n==Cast==\nThough not familiar stars in 1959, the cast quickly became favorites of the first television generation. The order of billing at the beginning of the broadcast appeared to be shuffled randomly each week, with no relation whatsoever to the current episode featured that week. The main cast of actors portraying Cartwrights is listed here in the order of their characters' ages, followed by an array of recurring supporting players:\n\n===Lorne Greene \u2013 Ben Cartwright===\n[[File:Lorne Greene in Bonanza opening credit episode Bitter Water.jpg|thumb|[[Lorne Greene]] as Ben Cartwright]]\n\nBorn in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], Canada, to Russian-[[Jew]]ish parents,<ref name=\"biobooklinda\">{{cite book|last=Bennett|first=Linda Greene|title=My Father's Voice: The Biography of Lorne Greene|publisher=iUniverse, Inc.|date=November 1, 2004|edition=Paperback|page=254|isbn=978-0-595-33283-0|url=https://www.amazon.com/My-Fathers-Voice-Biography-Greene/dp/0595332838#reader}}</ref><ref name=\"BonanzaViewers\">''Bonanza: A Viewer's Guide to a TV Legend'', by David Greenland; R&G Productions</ref> [[Lorne Greene]] was chosen to play widowed patriarch Ben Cartwright. Early in the show's history, he recalls each of his late wives in flashback episodes. A standard practice with most westerns was to introduce some romance but avoid matrimony. Few media cowboys had on-screen wives. Any time one of the Cartwrights seriously courted a woman, she died from a malady, was abruptly slain, or left with someone else.\n\nGreene appeared in all but fourteen ''Bonanza'' episodes. Greene was 44 years old at the beginning of the series while Pernell Roberts and Dan Blocker, who portrayed two of his sons, were both 31, only thirteen years younger.\n\nIn 2007, a ''TV Guide'' survey listed Ben Cartwright as television's #2 favorite dad.<ref>''TV Guide Top 50 Dad's of All Time'', by Raisley Gordon, ''TV Guide'', 2007</ref>\n\n===Pernell Roberts \u2013 Adam Cartwright===\n[[File:Pernell Roberts in Bonanza opening credits episode Bitter Water.jpg|thumb|[[Pernell Roberts]] as Adam Cartwright]]\n[[Pernell Roberts]] played eldest son Adam, an architectural engineer with a university education.

Despite the show's success, Roberts departed the series after the 1964\u201365 season (202 episodes) and returned to stage productions.\n\nAttempts to replace Adam with Little Joe's maternal half-brother Clay ([[Barry Coe]]) and Cartwright cousin Will ([[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy \"Zorro\" Williams]]), were unsuccessful.<ref name=\"BonanzaScenery\">''Bonanza: Scenery of the Ponderosa'',- Candy Canaday</ref> Creator David Dortort introduced a storyline that would keep the character of Adam in the mix, but with a lighter schedule. During season five Adam falls for a widow with a young daughter, while making Will Cartwright a central figure. Roberts decided to stay an additional season, so the scripts were quickly revised by having Adam's fianc\u00e9e and her daughter depart the series prematurely with Guy Williams' Will, with whom she'd fallen in love. It was Landon, not Roberts, who objected to the infusion of any new Cartwrights.<ref name=\"BonanzaViewers\" /><ref name=\"BonanzaScenery\" /> After Roberts did leave the following year, it was eventually mentioned that Adam had gone \"to sea\", and in the later movies he had emigrated to Australia and had a son Adam 'A.C.' Cartwright, Jr. In mid 1972, the series producers considered inviting Roberts back in the wake of Dan Blocker's death: \"One suggestion was to return Pernell Roberts, who had played another Cartwright son when ''Bonanza'' first premiered on NBC fourteen years ago. We only considered that briefly, [producer Richard Collins says] Some people felt it was a logical step\u2014the oldest son returning at a time of family need\u2014but most of us didn't think it would work.'{{-\"}}<ref>Dick Kleiner, NEA, July 18, 1972{{vague|date=February 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Dan Blocker \u2013 Eric \"Hoss\" Cartwright===\n[[File:Dan Blocker in Bonanza opening credits episode Bitter Water.jpg|thumb|[[Dan Blocker]] as \"Hoss\" Cartwright]]\n\n[[Dan Blocker]] was 6-foot-4, 320-pounds<ref>Michael Landon, ''The Tonight Show'', March 19, 1982</ref> when chosen to play the gentle middle son Eric, better known as \"Hoss\".

To satisfy young Adam, Inger and Ben agree to try the nickname Hoss and \"see which one sticks.\" Inger says of \"Hoss\", \"In the mountain country, that is the name for a big, friendly man.\" According to a biography,<ref name=\"BonanzaViewers\" /> the show's crew found Blocker to be the \"least actor-ish as well as the most likeable\" cast member. According to producer David Dortort: \"Over the years he gave me the least amount of trouble.\"<ref name=\"BonanzaViewers\" />[[File:Bonanza Dan Blocker.jpg|left|thumb|Dan Blocker as Hoss Cartwright]]In May 1972, Blocker died suddenly from a post-operative [[pulmonary embolism]] following surgery to remove his [[gall bladder]]. The producers felt nobody else could continue the role. It was the first time a TV show's [[Television producer|producers]] chose to kill off a young major male character (though it was done twice previously with young female leads\u2014in 1956 on ''[[Make Room For Daddy]]'', and again in 1963 with ''[[The Real McCoys]]''). Not until the TV movie ''[[Bonanza: The Next Generation]]'' was it explained that Hoss had drowned attempting to save a woman's life.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nAlthough \"big and lovable\", Blocker was also tough. Several years after his death, Landon appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' and related the following anecdote. During the shooting of one episode, Blocker's horse stumbled and fell, throwing Blocker and breaking his collarbone. Blocker got up and the bone was actually protruding from his skin. The crew wanted to call an ambulance but Blocker refused and stuck the bone back in place himself and resumed filming. At the end of the day he was convinced to go to the hospital where they set the broken bone and gave him strict instructions, no riding for six weeks. According to Landon, evidently Blocker's horse forgot what it was like to carry the big man during his convalescence because the first time that Blocker swung up into the saddle on his return, the horse collapsed under his weight and the cast and crew collapsed in fits of laughter.{{Citation needed|date = November 2017}}\n\n===Michael Landon \u2013 Joseph \"Little Joe\" Cartwright===\n[[File:Michael Landon in Bonanza episode Showdown (2).jpg|thumb|[[Michael Landon]] as Little Joe Cartwright]]\n\nThe role of \"Little Joe\" was given to [[Michael Landon]]. \nHe played guest roles on several TV westerns and attained the title role in ''[[I Was a Teenage Werewolf]]''. He portrayed the youngest Cartwright son, whose mother (Felicia in the pilot, and later changed to Marie) was of French Creole descent. Landon began to develop his skills in writing and directing ''Bonanza'' episodes, starting with \"The Gamble.\" Most of the episodes Landon wrote and directed were dramas, including the two-hour, \"Forever\" (1972), which was recognized by ''TV Guide'' as being one of television's best specials (November 1993).{{vague|date=February 2014}} Landon's development was a bit stormy according to David Dortort, who felt that the actor grew more difficult during the last five seasons the show ran.<ref name=BearFamily>\"Bonanza\" four CD set biography notes, Bear Family Records</ref> Landon appeared in all but fourteen ''Bonanza'' episodes for its run, a total of 416 episodes.\n\nBeginning in 1962, a foundation was being laid to include another \"son\", as Pernell Roberts was displeased with his character. In the episode \"First Born\" (1962), viewers learn of Little Joe's older, maternal half-brother Clay Stafford. The character departed in that same episode, but left an opportunity for a return if needed. This character's paternity is open to debate. In the 1963 flashback episode \"Marie, My Love\", his father was Jean De'Marigny. Then in 1964, Lorne Greene released the song \"Saga of the Ponderosa\",<ref name=BearFamily/> wherein Marie's previous husband was \"Big Joe\" Collins, who dies saving Ben's life. After Ben consoles Marie, the two bond and marry. They choose to honor \"Big Joe\" by calling their son \"Little Joe\". So, whether to Stafford, De'Marigny or Collins, Marie Cartwright was previously married. In the last of the three Bonanza TV movies, it is revealed that \"Little Joe\" had died in the Spanish\u2013American War&nbsp;\u2013 a member of the \"[[Rough Riders]]\". Little Joe had a son Benjamin 'Benj' Cartwright who was seen in all three Bonanza TV movies.\n\n===Ray Teal \u2013 Sheriff Roy Coffee===\n\nVeteran character actor [[Ray Teal]] essayed the role of '''Sheriff Roy Coffee''' on 98 episodes from 1960 to 1972.<ref name=\"imdb.com\">imdb.com</ref> He appeared in more than 250 movies and some 90 television programs during his 37-year career. His longest-running role was as Sheriff Roy Coffee. He had also played a sheriff in the [[Billy Wilder]] film ''[[Ace in the Hole (1951 film)|Ace in the Hole]]'' (1951). Teal co-starred in numerous TV westerns throughout his career: he appeared five times on ''Cheyenne'', twice on ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]'', on ''[[The Alaskans]]'', a short-lived series starring [[Roger Moore]], three times in different roles on another long-running western series, ''[[Wagon Train]]'', on NBC's ''[[Tales of Wells Fargo]]'' with [[Dale Robertson]], on the ABC western series ''Broken Arrow'', five times on the ABC western comedy ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' starring [[James Garner]] and [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]], sometimes playing a villain, on the CBS western series ''[[The Texan (TV series)|The Texan]]'' with [[Rory Calhoun]], the NBC western series ''[[The Californians (TV series)|The Californians]]'', twice on ''[[Colt .45 (TV series)|Colt .45]]'' with [[Wayde Preston]], once on ''[[Wanted: Dead or Alive (TV series)|Wanted: Dead or Alive]]'' with [[Steve McQueen]] and as \"Sheriff Clay\" for a single 1960 episode of the NBC western series ''[[Riverboat (TV series)|Riverboat]]'' with [[Darren McGavin]], and four times on a western series about the rodeo entitled ''[[Wide Country (TV series)|Wide Country]]''.\n\nTeal was a bit-part player in western films for several years before landing a substantial role in ''[[Northwest Passage (1940 film)|Northwest Passage]]'' (1940) starring [[Spencer Tracy]]. Another of his roles was as [[Little John]] in ''[[The Bandit of Sherwood Forest]]'' (1946). Notable film roles include playing one of the judges in ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' (1961) with Spencer Tracy, and an indulgent bar owner to [[Marlon Brando]]'s motorcycle gang in ''[[The Wild One]]'' (1953), which was the second of three times that Teal appeared with Brando, having done so already as a drunk in Brando's debut in ''The Men'' (1950) and later in Brando's only directorial effort, ''[[One-Eyed Jacks]]'' (1961), as a bartender.\n\nSheriff Coffee was occasionally the focus of a plot as in the episode \"No Less a Man\" (broadcast March 15, 1964). A gang of thieves has been terrorizing towns around Virginia City and the town council wants to replace Coffee, whom they consider over-the-hill, with a younger sheriff before the gang hits town, not realizing that they'd been spared earlier because the gang's leader was wary of Coffee's longevity and only acquiesced to rob the Virginia City bank after extreme pressure from other gang members. Coffee ends up showing the town that youth and a fast gun don't replace experience.\n\n===Guy Williams \u2013 Will Cartwright===\n[[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy Williams]] was slated in 1964, the year that ''Bonanza'' hit #1 in the ratings, to replace Pernell Roberts upon Roberts' departure, enabling the series to preserve the four-Cartwright format for the run of the series. His character, Ben's nephew Will Cartwright, was introduced and was the lead character in five episodes, receiving \"Starring\" billing after the four original rotating Cartwrights during his second appearance going forward, but Roberts changed his mind later and decided to stay for one more season, whereupon Williams found himself pushed out of the part; it was rumored that Michael Landon and Lorne Greene felt threatened by the studio initiating a precedent of successfully replacing one heroic [[leading man]] Cartwright with a new one, particularly in view of Williams' popularity with viewers. Williams had previously portrayed the titular character in [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' television series, and went on to play the lead in ''[[Lost in Space]]'', a [[science fiction]] television series, after the role in ''Bonanza'' ended.\n\n===David Canary \u2013 \"Candy\" Canaday===\n\nAfter graduating from the [[University of Cincinnati]], [[David Canary]] was offered a left-end position with the [[Denver Broncos]],<ref name=BonanzaViewers/> but pursued acting and singing. In 1967, he joined the cast as \"Candy\" Canaday, a plucky Army brat turned cowboy,<ref>Bonanza, \"Sense of Duty\", episode 271, September 24, 1967</ref> who became the Cartwrights' confidant, [[ranch foreman]] and timber vessel captain. Dortort was impressed by Canary's talent, but the character vanished in September 1970, after Canary had a contract dispute. He returned two seasons later after co-star Dan Blocker's death, reportedly having been approached by Landon. Canary played the character on a total of 93 episodes.<ref name=\"imdb.com\"/> Canary joined the cast in Season 9.\n\n===Victor Sen Yung \u2013 Hop Sing===\n\n[[Chinese American]] actor [[Victor Sen Yung]] played the Cartwrights' happy-go-lucky cook, whose blood pressure rose when the family came late for dinner. Cast here as the faithful domestic, the [[comedy relief]] character had little to do beyond chores. He once used martial arts to assail a towering family foe.<ref>Bonanza, \"Stage Door Johnnies\", 7/28/68</ref> Though often referenced, Hop Sing only appeared in an average of eight to nine shows each season. As a semi-regular cast member, Sen Yung was only paid per episode. After 14 years, he was widely known, but making far less than his Ponderosa peers. The Hop Sing character was central in only two episodes: \"Mark Of Guilt\" (#316) and \"The Lonely Man\" (#404).\n\n===Mitch Vogel \u2013 Jamie Hunter/Cartwright===\n\nAfter Canary's departure in mid-1970, and aware of the show's aging demographic, the writers sought a fresh outlet for Ben's fatherly advice. Fourteen-year-old [[Mitch Vogel]] was introduced as [[Jamie Hunter Cartwright|Jamie Hunter]] in  \"A Matter of Faith\" (season 12, episode 363). Vogel played the red-haired orphan of a roving rainmaker, whom Ben takes in and [[adopt]]s later in a 1971 episode, called \"A Home for Jamie.\"\n\n===Tim Matheson \u2013 Griff King===\n\nDuring the final season, in 1972\u201373, [[Tim Matheson]] portrayed Griff King, a parolee who tries to reform his life as a worker at the [[Ponderosa Ranch]] under Ben Cartwright's tutelage.\n\n===Lou Frizzell \u2013 Dusty Rhodes===\n\nFollowing Canary's departure, Frizzell's character accompanied Jamie Hunter to the Ponderosa and became the Cartwright's foreman.\n\n===Cast episode count===\n(Of 431 total episodes)\n*Lorne Greene \u2013 Ben Cartwright \u2013 417 episodes (Season 1\u201314)\n*Michael Landon \u2013 Joseph \"Little Joe\" Cartwright \u2013 416 episodes (Season 1\u201314)\n*Dan Blocker \u2013 Eric \"Hoss\" Cartwright \u2013 401 episodes (Season 1\u201313)\n*Pernell Roberts \u2013 Adam Cartwright \u2013 173 episodes (Season 1\u20136)\n*Victor Sen Yung \u2013 Hop Sing \u2013 107 episodes (Season 1\u201314)\n*Ray Teal \u2013 Sheriff Coffee \u2013 98 episodes (Season 2\u201313)\n*David Canary \u2013 \"Candy\" Canaday \u2013 93 episodes (Season 9\u201311, 14)\n*Bing Russell \u2013 Deputy Clem Foster \u2013 57 episodes (Season 4\u20135, 7\u201314)\n*Mitch Vogel \u2013 Jamie Hunter Cartwright \u2013 47 episodes (Season 12\u201314)\n*Tim Matheson \u2013 Griff King \u2013 12 episodes (Season 14)\n*Lou Frizzell \u2013 Dusty Rhodes \u2013 11 episodes (Season 11\u201313)\n*Guy Williams \u2013 Will Cartwright \u2013 5 episodes (Season 5)\n\n==Episodes==\n{{further|List of Bonanza episodes}}\n{{:List of Bonanza episodes}}\n\n==Broadcast history and ratings==\n[[File:Lorne Greene Ben Cartwright Bonanza.JPG|thumb|right|Lorne Greene as Ben]]\nInitially, ''Bonanza'' aired on Saturdays at 7:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern, opposite \"Dick Clark's Saturday Night Beech-Nut Show\" and \"John Gunther's High Road\" on ABC, and ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' on CBS. ''Bonanza''{{'}}s initial ratings were respectable, often coming in behind Mason but ahead of the ABC line-up. Ironically, executives considered canceling the show before its premiere because of its high cost. NBC kept it because ''Bonanza'' was one of the first series to be filmed and broadcast in [[Color television|color]], including scenes of picturesque Lake Tahoe, Nevada. NBC's corporate parent, [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA), used the show to spur sales of RCA-manufactured color television sets (RCA was also the primary sponsor of the series during its first two seasons).\n\nNBC moved ''Bonanza'' to Sundays at 9:00&nbsp;pm Eastern with new sponsor [[Chevrolet]] (replacing ''[[The Dinah Shore Chevy Show]]''). The new time slot caused ''Bonanza'' to soar in the ratings, and it eventually reached number one by 1964, an honor it would keep until 1967 when it was seriously challenged by the socially daring [[variety show]], ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'' on [[CBS]]. By 1970, ''Bonanza'' was the first series to appear in the Top Five list for nine consecutive seasons (a record that would stand for many years) and thus established itself as the most consistent strong-performing hit television series of the 1960s. ''Bonanza'' remained high on the [[Nielsen ratings]] until 1971, when it finally fell out of the Top Ten.\n\nDuring the summer of 1972, NBC broadcast reruns of episodes of the show from the 1967\u20131970 era on Tuesdays at 7:30&nbsp;p.m. under the title ''Ponderosa'' while also rerunning more recent episodes on Sunday evenings in the show{{'}}s normal time slot as ''Bonanza''.<ref name=\"brooks\"/> In the fall of 1972, off-network episodes were released in [[broadcast syndication]] to local stations by NBC under the ''Ponderosa'' name.  After the series was canceled in 1973, the syndicated reruns reverted to the ''Bonanza'' name.\n\n==Awards==\n*1964: Logie Award for Most Popular Overseas Show (Australia)\n*1965: Primetime [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Individual Achievements in Entertainment \u2013 Color Consultant, Edward P.

The reason for this is twofold: it made duplication of wardrobe easier for stunt doubles (Hal Burton, Bob Miles, Bill Clark, Lyle Heisler, Ray Mazy) and it cut the cost of refilming action shots (such as riding clips in-between scenes), as previously shot stock footage could be reused. Below is a survey of costumes employed:\n\n* Ben Cartwright: Sandy shirt, tawny leather vest, gray pants, cream-colored hat, occasional green scarf.\n* Adam Cartwright: Black shirt, black or midnight blue pants, black hat. Elegant city wear. Cream-colored trail coat.\n* Hoss Cartwright: White shirt, brown suede vest, brown pants, large beige flat-brimmed, ten-gallon hat.\n* Little Joe Cartwright: Beige, light gray shirt, kelly-green jacket, tan pants, beige hat. Black leather gloves from 10th season on. In season 14, he and Greene occasionally wore different shirts and slacks, as the footage of them and the late Dan Blocker together could no longer be reused.\n*Candy Canaday: Crimson shirt, black pants, black leather vest, black hat, grey/ pale purple scarf.\n\nIt was not unusual for Little Joe Cartwright and Candy Canaday to appear shirtless in various scenes involving manual labor.\n\n===Hair styles===\nIn 1968, Blocker began wearing a toupee on the series, as he was approaching age 40 and his hair loss was becoming more evident. He joined the ranks of his fellow co-stars Roberts and Greene, both of whom had begun the series with hairpieces (Greene wore his modest frontal piece in private life too, whereas Roberts preferred not wearing his, even to rehearsals/[[Blocking (stage)|blocking]]). Landon was the only original cast member who was wig-free throughout the series, as even Sen Yung wore an attached rattail- [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]].<ref>Michael Landon, \"The Tonight Show\", NBC-TV, March 10, 1983</ref>\n\n===Theme song===\n[[File:Pernell Roberts Bonanza 1959.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pernell Roberts]] as Adam Cartwright (1959)]]\n[[File:Bonanza main cast 1959.JPG|thumb|left|Original cast: Dan Blocker, Michael Landon, Lorne Greene and Pernell Roberts (1959)]]\n[[File:Bonanza cast smiling horse 1968.JPG|thumb|right|Dan Blocker (Hoss), Michael Landon (Little Joe), Lorne Greene (Ben) and one of the ''Bonanza'' horses.]]\n''Bonanza'' features a memorable [[theme music|theme song]] by [[Jay Livingston]] and [[Ray Evans]] that was orchestrated by [[David Rose (songwriter)|David Rose]] and arranged by [[Billy May]] for the television series. Members of the [[Western Writers of America]] chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.<ref name=\"Top100\">{{Cite web |title=The Top 100 Western Songs |author=Western Writers of America |year=2010 |authorlink=Western Writers of America |publisher=American Cowboy |url=http://www.americancowboy.com/culture/top-100-western-songs |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813072851/http://americancowboy.com/culture/top-100-western-songs |archivedate=August 13, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nThe ''Bonanza'' theme song famously opens with a blazing Ponderosa map and saddlebound Cartwrights. The melodic intro, emulating galloping horses, is one of the most recognized television scores. Variations of the theme were used for 12 seasons on the series. Although there were two official sets of lyrics (some country-western singers, avoiding royalties, substituted the copyright renditions with their own words), the series simply used an instrumental theme. Three of the cast members bellowed-out the original lyrics, unaccompanied, at the close of the pilot (Pernell Roberts, the sole professional singer of the quartet, abstained and untethered the horse reins). Before the pilot aired (on September 12, 1959), the song sequence, deemed too campy, was edited out of the scene and instead the Cartwrights headed back to the ranch whooping and howling. In a 1964 song, the Livingston-Evans lyrics were revised by Lorne Greene with a more familial emphasis, \"on this land we put our brand, Cartwright is the name, fortune smiled the day we filed the Ponderosa claim\" (\"Bonanza\", Bear Family Box set, Disc #2). In 1968, a slightly revamped horn and percussion-heavy arrangement of the original score introduced the series- which was used until 1970. A new theme song, called \"The Big Bonanza\" was written in 1970 by episode scorer David Rose, and was used from 1970\u20131972. Action-shot pictorials of the cast replaced the galloping trio. Finally, a faster rendition of the original music returned for the 14th and final season, along with action shots of the cast.\n\nThe theme song has been recorded by numerous artists in a diverse variety of styles. The first recorded and released version was an instrumental by [[Marty Gold]], on his 1960 album ''Swingin' West''. This was followed by the February 1960 single by [[Buddy Morrow]] and his Orchestra, which included vocals. Morrow's version also appeared on his 1960 album ''Double Impact'' which featured several other then-recent television themes. In December 1960, another vocal version was issued only in the United Kingdom by [[Johnny Gregory (bandleader)]] and his Orchestra and Chorus released on the Fontana label. All aforementioned vocal versions, including the television pilot, used lyrics written by Livingston and Evans contained in the first published sheet music for the song, though not all the lyrics were sung. A ''Bonanza'' soundtrack album released in late 1961 included a version by David Rose; Rose also had a 1960 single and included the theme on his 1961 album ''Exodus'' in a different mix. The biggest hit version is a guitar instrumental by [[Al Caiola]], which reached number 19 on Billboard in 1961. Other versions were released by [[Billy Vaughn]], [[Valjean]], [[Lorne Greene]], [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Nelson Riddle]].\n\nCountry singer [[Johnny Cash]] was first to record a full length vocal version of the theme song. He and [[Johnny Western]] discarded the original Livingston and Evans lyrics, and wrote new ones, though the revised lyrics still make direct reference to the Cartwrights and the Ponderosa. The song first saw release by September 1962 as a single. Sometime after June 1963, it was released as a track on his sixteenth album: ''[[Ring of Fire: The Best of Johnny Cash]].'' This version was later covered by [[Faron Young]] for his 1963 album ''Aims at the West''. Singer [[:de:Ralf Paulsen|Ralf Paulsen]] recorded a German-language version of the song in 1963, released in mid-June 1963 on Capitol Records in the United States. His German version (lyrics attributed to \"Nicolas\") was sung in the same style and mood in which Cash had recorded it, and was fairly close in translation.\n\n[[Carlos Malcolm]] & His Afro-Jamaican Rhythms released a [[ska]] version of the song as \"Bonanza Ska\" on [[Trojan Records]] in 1964. This version was later covered by [[Bad Manners]] (1989) and the Hurtin' Buckaroos (1997). [[Michael Richards]], as Stanley Spadowski, sang a bit of the theme song while being held hostage by Channel 8's news goons in ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' (he did not know the words to the song he was originally supposed to sing, \"[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]\"). [[Michael Feinstein]] was the last to record the song in 2002 on his ''Songs of Evans and Livingston'' tribute CD. The ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'' theme (also by Rose), was heard first in a 1971 episode of ''Bonanza''. The overture for ''[[The High Chaparral]]'' composed by Harry Sukman can be heard briefly at the start of the 1966 episode \"Four Sisters from Boston\". On January 29, 2011, Marty Stuart and the Fabulous Superlatives performed the song on episode 56 of ''The Marty Stuart Show''. The band often includes the song in their live shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.martystuart.com/mss-1-29-11.htm |title=The Marty Stuart Show \u2013 Episode 56 \u2013 January 29, 2011 |publisher=Martystuart.com |date=2011-01-29 |accessdate=2014-06-28}}</ref>\n\n===Set===\n[[File:Bonanza-Ponderosa Ranch-postcard-03 (5619566355).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ponderosa tour postcard \u2013 visitors tour the replica ranchhouse and its big living room with stone fireplace overlooking the east shore of [[Lake Tahoe]], in [[Incline Village, Nevada]] where several rebuilt ranch buildings were used as a set for outside filming]]\n\nThe opening scene for the first season was shot at [[Lake Hemet]], a reservoir in the San Jacinto Mountains, Riverside County, California, and later moved to Lake Tahoe. During the first season extra horses were rented from the Idyllwild Stables in Idyllwild, also in the San Jacinto Mountains. The first Virginia City set was used on the show until 1970 and was located on a backlot at Paramount and featured in episodes of ''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel]]'', ''[[Mannix]]'', and ''[[The Brady Bunch]]''. In the 1970 premiere episode of the 12th season entitled \"The Night Virginia City Died\", Deputy Clem Foster's pyromaniac fianc\u00e9e levels the town in a series of fires (reflecting a real 1875 fire that destroyed three-quarters of Virginia City). This allowed for a switch to the less expensive Warner studios from September 1970 through January 1973. The script was initially written for the departing David Canary's Candy, but was rewritten for actors Ray Teal (Sheriff Roy Coffee) and Bing Russell (Deputy Clem Foster), who rarely appeared together on the show.\n\nThe program's Nevada set, the [[Ponderosa Ranch]] house, was recreated in [[Incline Village, Nevada]], in 1967, and remained a tourist attraction until its sale thirty-seven years later in September 2004.\n\nIt was partially filmed in [[Wildwood Regional Park]] in [[Thousand Oaks, California]].<ref>Schad, Jerry (2009).

''Bonanza Gold'' (2003\u20132009), a quarterly magazine, featured detailed information about the show, including interviews with guest actors and other production personnel, articles about historical events and people depicted in the series, fan club information, and [[fan fiction]].  Seasons 1\u20138 (as of 06/2015) are available on DVD, as well as several non-successive public-domain episodes (sans original theme music). The prequel series, ''The Ponderosa'', as well as the three sequel movies (see below), are all available on DVD.\n\n==Cancellation and resurgence==\n[[File:Bonanza full cast 1962.JPG|thumb|right|Front to back: Pernell Roberts, Michael Landon, Dan Blocker and Lorne Greene]]\n\nIn the fall of 1972, NBC moved ''Bonanza'' to Tuesday nights&nbsp;\u2013 where reruns from the 1967\u20131970 period had aired the previous summer under the title ''Ponderosa''<ref name=\"brooks\"/>&nbsp;\u2013 opposite the ''[[All In The Family]]'' spinoff show, ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'', a virtual death sentence for the show. The scheduling change, as well as Dan Blocker's death several months earlier, resulted in plunging ratings for the show. David Canary returned to his former role of Candy (to offset Hoss' absence), and a new character named Griff King (played by [[Tim Matheson]]) was added to lure younger viewers. Griff, in prison for nearly killing his abusive stepfather, was paroled into Ben's custody and got a job as a ranch hand. Several episodes were built around his character, one that Matheson never had a chance to fully develop before the show's abrupt cancellation in November 1972 (with last episode airing January 16, 1973). Many fans, as well as both Landon and Greene, felt that the Hoss character was essential, as he was a nurturing, empathetic soul who rounded out the all-male cast.\n\nFor 14 years, the Cartwrights were the premier western family on American television and have aired on cable networks such as [[TV Land]], INSP, Family Channel, and the [[Hallmark Channel]]. The series currently airs on [[Me-TV]], [[TV Land]], [[The Inspiration Network|INSP]], and [[Encore (TV channel)|Encore Westerns]]. [[TV Land]] airs ''Bonanza'' from only the first season to the 1969\u20131970 season. INSP first aired only selected first and second-season episodes of ''Bonanza'' and began to air the ''Bonanza'' Lost Episodes packages which contains episodes that originally aired from 1965\u20131973. Family Channel and the [[Hallmark Channel]] were two other channels that have also only aired the ''Bonanza'' Lost Episodes package. In October 2015, Me-TV additionally began airing the ''Bonanza'' Lost Episodes package.<ref>[http://www.metv.com/videos/bonanza-lost-episodes-starts-monday/ ''Bonanza'' Lost Episodes \u2013 Starts Monday] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022150005/http://www.metv.com/videos/bonanza-lost-episodes-starts-monday/ |date=October 22, 2015 }} at MeTV.com</ref> As of December 2016, Me-TV returned to airing the original episodes package.  Ever since March 2018 Me-TV has been airing the Lost Episodes, wanting to play the entire series from beginning to end.\n\n===Television movies===\n''Bonanza'' was revived for three made-for-television movies featuring the Cartwrights' children: ''[[Bonanza: The Next Generation]]'' (1988), ''[[Bonanza: The Return]]'' (1993), and ''[[Bonanza: Under Attack]]'' (1995). [[Michael Landon Jr.]], played Little Joe's son Benji while [[Gillian Greene]], Lorne Greene's daughter, played a love interest. In the second movie, airing on NBC, a one-hour retrospective was done to introduce the drama. It was hosted by both Michael Landon Jr., and [[Dirk Blocker]], who looks and sounds almost exactly like his father Dan Blocker except that Dirk Blocker is not nearly as tall. According to the magazine ''[[TV Guide]]'', producer Dortort told Blocker he was too old to play the Hoss scion, but gave him the role of an unrelated newspaper reporter. Clips of his appearance were heavily used in advertisements promoting the \"second generation\" theme, perhaps misleading audiences to believe that Blocker was playing Hoss' heir. Hoss' son Josh was born out of wedlock, as it is explained that Hoss drowned without knowing his fianc\u0117e was pregnant. Such a storyline might have been problematic in the original series. (''[[The Big Valley]]'', however, had a major character in Heath, who was presented as illegitimate. The ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' movies of the early 1990s employed a similar theme when [[Marshal Matt Dillon]] learned he had sired [[Michael Learned]]'s character's daughter in a short-lived romance. The initial story was first introduced in 1973, when depiction of fornication courted protests, so CBS insisted their hero Matt have the encounter when he had amnesia.)\n\n===Prequel===\n:''For more, see: ''[[Ponderosa (TV series)]]''{{nbsp}}''\nIn 2001, there was an attempt to revive the ''Bonanza'' concept with a prequel, ''[[Ponderosa (TV series)|Ponderosa]]''&nbsp;\u2013 not to be confused with the 1972 summer reruns under the same title<ref name=\"brooks\"/>&nbsp;\u2013 with a pilot directed by [[Simon Wincer]] and filmed in Australia. Covering the time when the Cartwrights first arrived at the Ponderosa, when Adam and Hoss were teenagers and Joe a little boy, the series lasted 20 episodes and featured less gunfire and brawling than the original. ''Bonanza'' creator [[David Dortort]] approved PAX TV (now Ion TV)'s decision to hire [[Beth Sullivan]], formerly of ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]'', which some believe gave the series more depth as well as a softer edge. The Hop Sing character is depicted not only as a cook but also a family counselor and [[Phytotherapy|herbal healer]]. The series takes place in [[Nevada Territory]] in 1849, which is actually an anachronism.  The Nevada Territory did not split from the [[Utah Territory]] until 1861, meaning that until at least the 5th season (the episode \"Enter Thomas Bowers\" establishes that year as 1857), ''Bonanza'' is also set in what in real life would have been Utah Territory.\n\n===Home media===\n[[File:Dan Blocker Bonanza 1959.jpg|thumb|right|Hoss Cartwright (Dan Blocker) with 19th century home media]]\n{{Anchor|Home video and DVD releases|DVD|Video}}\nSeveral early episodes have fallen into the public domain. These episodes have been released by several companies in different configurations, with substandard picture and sound quality, edited, and by legal necessity with the copyright-protected Evans\u2013Livingston theme song replaced with generic western music.\n\nIn 1973, NBC licensed the distribution rights to the series, along with the rest of its pre-1973 library, to [[National Telefilm Associates]], which changed its name to Republic Pictures in 1986. Republic would become part of the [[Spelling Television|Spelling Entertainment]] organization in 1994 through [[Worldvision Enterprises]]. Select episodes (\"The Best of Bonanza\") were officially released in North America in 2003 on DVD through then-Republic video licensee [[Artisan Entertainment]] (which was later purchased by [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate Home Entertainment]]). Republic (through [[CBS Television Distribution]], which holds the television side of Republic's holdings) still retains the syndication distribution rights to the series. [[CBS Home Entertainment]] (under [[Paramount Home Media Distribution]]) is the official home video rights distributor at present.\n\nStarting in September 2009, [[CBS Home Entertainment]] (distributed by [[Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount]]) has to date released the first ten seasons on DVD in Region 1. All episodes have been digitally remastered from original 35mm film elements to yield the best picture and sound quality possible with current technology. CBSHE has released each season in two-volume sets (available together and separately). Each and every set contains exclusive multiple and rare bonus features, more than any other vintage long-running television series released on DVD. Classic series collections usually have bonus features included with the first season release only, if at all.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nIn Region 2, ''AL!VE AG'' released the first seven seasons on DVD in Germany between 2008\u20132010.  These releases are now out of print as AL!VE has lost the rights.  In 2011, [[StudioCanal]] acquired the rights to the series and have begun re-releasing it on DVD, and all seasons have now been released but have not been remastered.\n\nEpisodes of the series have also been officially released as part-works on DVD in France and the United Kingdom.\n\n''Bonanza'' \"the official first season\" was released in [[Scandinavia]] during 2010. The first season is released in 4 volumes. The first two volumes were released on October 20, 2010, and the second two volumes on April 27, 2011.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Region 1 DVD releases of ''Bonanza''\n|-\n! DVD name\n!

Gray]], 1869</small>\n}}\n\nThe '''yellow-faced honeyeater''' (''Caligavis chrysops'') is a small to medium-sized bird in the [[honeyeater]] [[family (biology)|family]], Meliphagidae. It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude [[subalpine area]]s, and [[woodland]]s along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as ''[[Banksia]]'' and ''[[Grevillea]]'', and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.\n\nSome yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands [[bird migration|migrate]] northwards between March and May to spend the winter in southern [[Queensland]], and return in July and August to breed in southern [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They form [[Monogamy in animals|socially monogamous]] pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate [[cup nest|cup-shaped nest]]. The success rate can be low, and the pairs nest several times during the breeding season.\n\nHoneyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing, and weeds. As it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) to be of [[least concern]] for conservation. It is considered a pest in orchards in some areas.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was first [[species description|described]], and placed in the genus ''[[Typical warbler|Sylvia]]'', by ornithologist, [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]], in his 1801 work, ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae''.<ref name=latham01>{{cite book | last=Latham | first=John | author-link=John Latham (ornithologist) | year=1801 | title=Supplementum indicis ornithologici sive systematis ornithologiae | place=London | publisher=Leigh & Sotheby | language=Latin | page=liv | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33261428 }}</ref><ref name=Latham>{{cite journal | last = Schodde| first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Schodde |author2=Dickinson, Edward C. |author3=Steinheimer, Frank D. |author4=Bock, Walter J.  | title = The date of Latham's ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici'': 1801 or 1802? | journal = South Australian Ornithologist | volume = 35| issue = 8 | pages = 231\u2013235 | year = 2010| url=http://www.birdssa.asn.au/images/saopdfs/Volume35/2010V35P231.pdf }}</ref> French ornithologist [[Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot]] described it as ''Melithreptus gilvicapillus'' in 1817, and English zoologist [[George Robert Gray]] as ''Ptilotis trivirgata'' in 1869.<ref name=\"AFD\">{{cite web|url=https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/f27e5973-dc69-40d0-af23-ae1c49d6e0b3|title=Subspecies ''Caligavis chrysops chrysops'' (Latham, 1801)|author=Australian Biological Resources Study|date=13 October 2014|work=Australian Faunal Directory|publisher=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, Australian Government|accessdate=7 January 2017|location=Canberra, Australian Capital Territory}}</ref> The specific name ''chrysops'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''chrysos'' meaning 'gold' and ''prosopo'' meaning 'face', in reference to the stripe of yellow feathers.<ref name=fraser13>{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Jeannie|last2=Fraser|first2=Ian|title=Australian Bird Names: A Complete Guide|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W1TCqHVWQp0C&pg=PT199#v=onepage&q=Yellow-faced%20honeyeater%20&f=false|year=2013|publisher=Csiro Publishing|location=Collingwood, Victoria | isbn=978-0-643-10471-6|page=199}}</ref>\n\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was classified in the genera ''[[Meliphaga]]'' and then ''[[Lichenostomus]]'' until 2011.<ref name=\"AFD\"/> Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among honeyeaters in the genus using dense [[taxon]] and [[nucleotide]] sampling confirmed previous findings that ''Lichenostomus'' is not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]].<ref name =Gardener>{{cite journal| last = Gardner | first = J.L.  | last2 = Trueman |first2=J.W.H. |last3=Ebert|first3=D. |last4=Joseph |first4=L. |last5=Magrath|first5=R.D. | title = Phylogeny and evolution of the ''Meliphagoidea'', the largest radiation of Australian songbirds  | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 55 | issue =  3| pages = 1087\u20131102 | year = 2010 | issn = 1055-7903  | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005\n| pmid = 20152917}}</ref> Five species have previously been described as comprising the ''Caligavis'' subgroup, but studies using the [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] DNA identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most closely related to the [[black-throated honeyeater]] (''C. subfrenatus'') and the [[obscure honeyeater]] (''C. obscurus'') of New Guinea; they were therefore grouped into the genus ''[[Caligavis]]''.

Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line. The chin, throat and breast are a pale greyish brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish brown to olive-brown. Olive-green outer edges on the [[Flight feather|remiges]] combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is a dusky blue in adult birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, {{convert|0.8|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the subspecies. The yellow-faced honeyeater averages {{convert|15|-|17.5|cm|in}} in length, with a wingspan of {{convert|21.5|-|26|cm|in|abbr=on}} and a weight of {{convert|12.5|-|20.5|g|oz}}, with an average of {{convert|17|g|oz|abbr=on}}).{{sfn|Higgins|Christidis|Ford|2008|p=597}}{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n===Vocalizations===\nOne of the first birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and extremely varied. The male sings from a roost for up to an hour, beginning twenty or thirty minutes before dawn.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}} The song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like ''chick-up, chick-up'', from which its common name of quitchup is derived.{{sfn|Officer|1965|p=50}} Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long ''preet'' with an upward inflection. The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle.

It most commonly dwells in open forests dominated by spotted gum (''[[Corymbia maculata]]'') with [[ironbark]]s and [[stringybark]]s such as narrow-leaved ironbark (''[[Eucalyptus crebra]]'') and silver-leaved ironbark ([[Eucalyptus melanophloia|''E. melanophloia'']]), with a light shrubby [[understorey]], and less often in dry open forests and [[woodland]]s dominated by ''[[Angophora]]'', ''[[Acacia]]'', ''[[Banksia]]'', ''[[Casuarina]]'' or ''[[Callitris]]'', or in high-altitude, tall, open forests of alpine ash (''[[Eucalyptus delegatensis]]'') and woodlands dominated by snow gum (''[[Eucalyptus pauciflora|E. pauciflora]]'') or white box (''[[Eucalyptus albens|E. albens]]''). It has been recorded in coastal [[heath]] when banksias are blooming, and among flowering [[mangrove]]s. It occupies areas infested with weeds such as Scotch broom (''[[Cytisus scoparius]]'') and [[Blackberry|blackberries]], and developed areas including orchards and parks and gardens, where it feeds on cultivated fruit and flowers. It can be found in forests regenerating after [[Bushfires in Australia|fire]] or [[logging]], though it is more common in mature forests.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=725}} Where it is found in woodland, it is usually woodland near forest or with an [[understory]] of sclerophyll plants.<ref name=\"Ford and Paton 76\">{{cite journal|last1=Ford|first1=Hugh A.|last2=Paton|first2=David C.|title=Resource partitioning and competition in honeyeaters of the genus ''Meliphaga''|journal=Australian Journal of Ecology|date=1976|volume=1|issue=4|pages=281\u2013287|doi=10.1111/j.1442-9993.1976.tb01118.x}}</ref>\n\n===Range===\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater ranges across a broad arc generally along the coastline from near [[Cooktown]] in [[Far North Queensland]], southwest between a line from [[Charters Towers]] to [[Albury]] and the coast, and then west to the [[Fleurieu Peninsula]] and Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia.

It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude [[subalpine area]]s, and [[woodland]]s along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as ''[[Banksia]]'' and ''[[Grevillea]]'', and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.\n\nSome yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands [[bird migration|migrate]] northwards between March and May to spend the winter in southern [[Queensland]], and return in July and August to breed in southern [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They form [[Monogamy in animals|socially monogamous]] pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate [[cup nest|cup-shaped nest]]. The success rate can be low, and the pairs nest several times during the breeding season.\n\nHoneyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing, and weeds. As it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) to be of [[least concern]] for conservation. It is considered a pest in orchards in some areas.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was first [[species description|described]], and placed in the genus ''[[Typical warbler|Sylvia]]'', by ornithologist [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]] in his 1801 work ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae''.<ref name=latham01>{{cite book | last=Latham | first=John | author-link=John Latham (ornithologist) | year=1801 | title=Supplementum indicis ornithologici sive systematis ornithologiae | place=London | publisher=Leigh & Sotheby | language=Latin | page=liv | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33261428 }}</ref><ref name=Latham>{{cite journal | last = Schodde| first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Schodde |author2=Dickinson, Edward C. |author3=Steinheimer, Frank D. |author4=Bock, Walter J.  | title = The date of Latham's ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici'': 1801 or 1802? | journal = South Australian Ornithologist | volume = 35| issue = 8 | pages = 231\u2013235 | year = 2010| url=http://www.birdssa.asn.au/images/saopdfs/Volume35/2010V35P231.pdf }}</ref> French ornithologist [[Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot]] described it as ''Melithreptus gilvicapillus'' in 1817, and English zoologist [[George Robert Gray]] as ''Ptilotis trivirgata'' in 1869.<ref name=\"AFD\">{{cite web|url=https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/f27e5973-dc69-40d0-af23-ae1c49d6e0b3|title=Subspecies ''Caligavis chrysops chrysops'' (Latham, 1801)|author=Australian Biological Resources Study|date=13 October 2014|work=Australian Faunal Directory|publisher=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, Australian Government|accessdate=7 January 2017|location=Canberra, Australian Capital Territory}}</ref> The specific name ''chrysops'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''chrysos'' meaning 'gold' and ''prosopo'' meaning 'face', in reference to the stripe of yellow feathers.<ref name=fraser13>{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Jeannie|last2=Fraser|first2=Ian|title=Australian Bird Names: A Complete Guide|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W1TCqHVWQp0C&pg=PT199#v=onepage&q=Yellow-faced%20honeyeater%20&f=false|year=2013|publisher=Csiro Publishing|location=Collingwood, Victoria | isbn=978-0-643-10471-6|page=199}}</ref>\n\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was classified in the genera ''[[Meliphaga]]'' and then ''[[Lichenostomus]]'' until 2011.<ref name=\"AFD\"/> Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among honeyeaters in the genus using dense [[taxon]] and [[nucleotide]] sampling confirmed previous findings that ''Lichenostomus'' is not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]].<ref name =Gardener>{{cite journal| last = Gardner | first = J.L.  | last2 = Trueman |first2=J.W.H. |last3=Ebert|first3=D. |last4=Joseph |first4=L. |last5=Magrath|first5=R.D. | title = Phylogeny and evolution of the ''Meliphagoidea'', the largest radiation of Australian songbirds  | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 55 | issue =  3| pages = 1087\u20131102 | year = 2010 | issn = 1055-7903  | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005\n| pmid = 20152917}}</ref> Five species have previously been described as comprising the ''Caligavis'' subgroup, but studies using the [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] DNA identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most closely related to the [[black-throated honeyeater]] (''C. subfrenatus'') and the [[obscure honeyeater]] (''C. obscurus'') of New Guinea; they were therefore grouped into the genus ''[[Caligavis]]''.

Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line. The chin, throat and breast are a pale greyish brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish brown to olive-brown. Olive-green outer edges on the [[Flight feather|remiges]] combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is a dusky blue in adult birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, {{convert|0.8|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the subspecies. The yellow-faced honeyeater averages {{convert|15|-|17.5|cm|in}} in length, with a wingspan of {{convert|21.5|-|26|cm|in|abbr=on}} and a weight of {{convert|12.5|-|20.5|g|oz}}, with an average of {{convert|17|g|oz|abbr=on}}).{{sfn|Higgins|Christidis|Ford|2008|p=597}}{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n===Vocalizations===\nOne of the first birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and extremely varied. The male sings from a roost for up to an hour, beginning twenty or thirty minutes before dawn.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}} The song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like ''chick-up, chick-up'', from which its common name of quitchup is derived.{{sfn|Officer|1965|p=50}} Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long ''preet'' with an upward inflection. The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common calls, thought to be [[contact call]]s, are animated two-note calls variously described as ''terric, terric'', ''cr-rook, cr-rook'' or ''put-put, put-put''.{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Yellow-faced Honeyeater callistemon.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Honeyeater balancing on a bottlebrush flower|The yellow-faced honeyeater can be seen feeding on garden shrubs.]]\n\n===Habitat===\nAcross its range, the yellow-faced honeyeater is found in a range of habitats\u2014in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and often in [[Riparian zone|riparian]] woodlands.

It has been recorded in coastal [[heath]] when banksias are blooming, and among flowering [[mangrove]]s. It occupies areas infested with weeds such as Scotch broom (''[[Cytisus scoparius]]'') and [[Blackberry|blackberries]], and developed areas including orchards and parks and gardens, where it feeds on cultivated fruit and flowers.

As with Barlow's previous title, ''[[Her Story (video game)|Her Story]]'', the game uses live action [[full-motion video]] of four people (played by [[Logan Marshall-Green]], [[Alexandra Shipp]], [[Kerry Bish\u00e9]], and [[Angela Sarafyan]]) as part of video calls made between them, and the player will need to use tools provided from the game to piece together events and what statements may be lies to determine the overall mystery.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Telling lies screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|''Telling Lies'' is played out on a virtual desktop computer screen with its own operating system. The reflection of the player-character can be seen off the virtual monitor.]] \nBarlow describes ''Telling Lies'' as a \"desktop thriller\" like ''Her Story'', where the player becomes involved in a drama that is played out through stored video clips and other information presented on a virtual computer desktop.<ref name=\"dtoid e3\"/> ''Telling Lies'' provides the player with numerous video segments that in the game's narrative, cover a two-year period and which have been stored on a stolen hard-drive taken from the [[National Security Agency]]. The player has the ability to search the hundreds of video segments on keywords as to piece together timelines, events, and interactions, all to try to understand why the four central people have been the subject of electronic surveillance, as well as the nature of the player-character's role in these events; this character appears female and can be seen in a virtual reflection of the in-game computer screen to the actual player. However, these clips only provide the video and audio from one side of the conversation, requiring the player to determine which clips may match the other participants, as well as potential interactions with around 30 other people.<ref name=\"polygon\">{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/27/18283175/telling-lies-game-sam-barlow-preview-gdc-2019 | title = Her Story follow-up takes place on a stolen NSA hard drive | first=  Chelsea | last= Stark | date = 27 March 2019 | accessdate = 27 March 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref><ref name=\"dtoid e3\">{{cite web | url = https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/06/17/sam-barlow-telling-lies-interview-e3-2019/ | title = \u2018I hate repeating a trick\u2019 - the writer of Telling Lies on going back to the desktop thriller | first = Brendan | last=  Caldwell | date = 17 June 2019 | accessdate = 17 June 2019 | work = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}</ref> Players can scroll forwards and backwards within segments, highlight certain words in the video subtitles to use as search, and keep notes within an in-game memo pad.<ref name=\"dtoid e3\"/> The player only has a limited amount of time within a single playthrough to scan material from the hard-drive, and would have to restart from scratch (losing all notes and bookmarks) if they want to see more.<ref name=\"eurog review\"/> Barlow estimated that the content within ''Telling Lies'' is about four to five times longer than ''Her Story''.<ref name=\"pcgamer\">{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/see-the-first-teaser-for-telling-lies-the-new-game-from-the-creator-of-her-story/ | title = See the first teaser for Telling Lies, the next game from the creator of Her Story | first1 = Tim | last1= Clark | first2 = Jody | last2 = MacGregor | date = 27 March 2019 | accessdate = 27 March 2019 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref> There are three different endings that the player may reach through the game, depending on which character's videos they explored most frequently.<ref name=\"pcgamer multiple\">{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/telling-lies-endings-good-bad-how-to-get/ | title = Here's how you see all the endings in Telling Lies | first = Andy | last= Kelly | date = August 29, 2019 | accessdate = August 29, 2019 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref>\n\n{{clear|left}}\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|date=September 2019}}\nIn 2019, Karen Douglas, a former FBI agent, goes back to her apartment at midnight to turn on her computer and access the content of an external USB drive. She then watches the videos by searching them using keywords.\n\nDavid Smith, the main character, was an FBI agent. He and his wife, Emma, have a daughter Alba. After David went undercover, Emma\u2019s mother, Laura, moved in. During David's mission, Laura developed dementia and eventually passed away, despite medical care by an anaesthesiologist named Steven who was hired by the couple.\n\nIt is revealed that when David was Emma's then-boyfriend, he killed Paul, who was Emma\u2019s abusive ex-boyfriend. David waited outside for Paul to enter Emma\u2019s house. Then David went inside and used his pistol to shoot Paul, who was unarmed, in the lungs, and then watched him bleed to death, with Emma as an unwilling accomplice.\n\nDuring the years of 2017 and 2018, David was an undercover special agent supervised by an agent named Mike, working on a case code-named as Green Dagger. The aim of the operation was to demonstrate the intention of environmental groups to break the law and commit acts of terrorism. The main target of the operation was a group called \"Green Storm\" lead by an activity named Riordan. To infiltrate this group, David was to begin by infiltrate a smaller team called the \"Organizing Group\" led by Eric and Peter.\n\nThe Organizing group's main target was a corporation in [[Detroit, Michigan]] called Prosperen, who wished to build natural gas plants in the area. In particular the organisation was building a pipeline which the activist groups believed would pollute the water source. Mike instructed David to use the alias David Jones and infiltrate the group. They targeted Ava, who was referred to as \u201cSnow White\u201d. David approached Ava and developed a romantic relationship with her, based on their mutual love for music. David gained Ava\u2019s trust and used this to get invited to the Organizing group.\n\nThe Organizing Group was initially made up of Eric, Chris, Peter, and Simon. Simon was secretly a black flag agent providing information to the FBI, an arrangement David was unhappy with as he felt Simon was unprofessional. As David begun to ingratiate himself with the group, he discovered that Peter, one of the leaders, had previously slept with Ava while she was underage, drugged her and filmed some of what they had done. David brutally attacks Peter, receiving an official reprimand from the FBI, and incurring Ava's anger. Unashamed, he then proceeds to use a contact from his past, Harry, to acquire drugs which he plants on Peter to frame him. \n\nAs David gets increasingly edgy, he decides to out Simon as a Black Flag Spy. While these actions, and his growing closeness to Ava, alarms Mike, it also impresses Eric, and David moves forwards with the plan. He invites Riordan and the Organizing Group to discuss plans to disrupt movement on a key bridge which Prosperen needs access to proceed with the pipeline. While staying on the boat, Ava reveals that she is pregnant with David's child.\n\nDavid discusses with a new Black Flag employee who has infiltrated Green Storm their plan to try to trap Riordan into getting involved in a direct attack, namely destroying a bridge. However during the meeting the Black Flag employee doesn't follow the script, and David's speech is not well received. A frustrated David calls Mike only to discover that Mike has agreed with Black Flag to hold off on Green Storm, and just arrest the Organizing Group, including Ava. David argues strongly that the operation should continue, and that Ava should not be arrested, but Mike tells him to kill David Jones (His cover name).\n\nThe Organizing Group is then arrested, including Ava who is on a call with David when the arrest occurs. While David expresses anger to Mike, Mike notes that David had been withholding information in his reports, including Ava's pregnancy. David tries to continue meeting with the Organizing Group, but Karen Douglas, his field supervisor, bursts in an attempt to provide him cover to leave. David is furious with Karen, but after some discussion back and forth with Mike, he agrees to withdraw. Ava is heartbroken by David's sudden disappearance, and outraged by David's decision to leave her money.\n\nDuring this mission, David had been having regular conversations with a sex worker named Maxine Williams, who ran a webcam chatroom with multiple aliases. David paid her for conversation, and over time shared personal stories with Maxine including his identity as a federal special agent, and his relationship with Emma and Ava. As his life falls apart, David, believing he has a real connection with Maxine, tries to connect with her. She first bans him, and then, when he comes back with a different credit card, reveals that everything he knows about her is a lie, and that she has recorded all their conversations, and will release them if he keeps following her.\n\nDavid decides to track her down, using Harry to find her, and locates her. Maxine is prepared, and has already released the videos, and shoots David in the leg, with the police arriving shortly after.\n\nAfter being shot, David reconnects with Mike, saying that David Jones is dead. Some time passes, during which David is living alone, estranged from both his wife and his girlfriend. He tries to reconnect with both, but both reject him. David finally breaks down, and decides to commit suicide by blowing the explosives on his boat, potentially destroying the bridge as well.\n\nFinishing reviewing some of the videos, Karen uploads and leaks the video content she has watched. She destroys the hard drive of her computer, bypasses the FBI agents who are searching in the area, and walks up the stairs to the rooftop. She smokes a cigarette and enjoys the sunrise.\n\nThe mid-credits scene shows one of the three women\u2019s (Emma\u2019s, Ava\u2019s, or Maxine\u2019s) fate, depending on the videos the player has watched.<ref name=\"pcgamer multiple\"/> Both Emma and Ava move on to a new life without David and continue to raise their daughters. Maxine leaves her place in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and  decides to open a cam agency in New York. Maxine goes on to become a novelist writing crime stories with \u2018strong female leads\u2019.\n\n==Development==\nBarlow's work on ''Telling Lies'' began in January 2016 as a \"[[spiritual successor]]\" to ''Her Story'', with a narrative unrelated to the first game, though it continued to use full-motion video as its central gameplay element.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/her-story-2-is-on-the-way/ |title=Her Story 2 is on the way |last=Morrison |first=Angus |work=[[PC Gamer]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |date=25 January 2016 |accessdate=26 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6enpASSwX?url=http://www.pcgamer.com/her-story-2-is-on-the-way/ |archivedate=25 January 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/01/her-story-sequel/ |title=Heavily Redacted Tweet Teases a Her Story Sequel |last=Muncy |first=Julie |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]] |date=25 January 2016 |accessdate=26 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6eoMnRrk8?url=http://www.wired.com/2016/01/her-story-sequel/ |archivedate=25 January 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Through some had urged him to make a direct sequel to ''Her Story'' by creating another murder mystery and putting another actor in place, Barlow wanted something that was more risky, and utilising the aspects of ''Her Story'' where the player got to know more about the main character through the clips.<ref name=\"pcgamer\"/> He came to the concept of electronic surveillance as a central theme in part of being a parent himself and wanting to keep track of his own pre-teen-aged son's online activities.<ref name=\"pcgamer\"/> In reading up about surveillance methods used by the National Security Agency and [[MI5]], Barlow read up on the [[Optic Nerve (GCHQ)|Optic Nerve]] program and found that it had several similarities to ''Her Story'', including the ability to search on stored video and audio through keywords.<ref name=\"pcgamer\"/> \n\nIn July 2017, Barlow announced that the game, titled ''Telling Lies'', would feature three to four key characters. He described the game as a combination of the films ''[[The Conversation]]'' (1974) and ''[[Shame (2011 film)|Shame]]'' (2011). The game was published by [[Annapurna Interactive]] and shooting for the game had been scheduled to start in late 2017 or early 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/her-story-creator-reveals-new-game-will-be-called-telling-lies/ |title=Her Story creator reveals new game will be called Telling Lies |last=Chalk |first=Andy |work=[[PC Gamer]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |date=14 July 2017 |accessdate=14 July 2017 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6sczV6Mui?url=http://www.pcgamer.com/her-story-creator-reveals-new-game-will-be-called-telling-lies/ |archivedate=11 August 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> For filming, Barlow wanted the conversations between characters to appear natural, ideally filming both actors as they conversed but from different locations.

As with Barlow's previous title, ''[[Her Story (video game)|Her Story]]'', the game uses live action [[full-motion video]] of four people (played by [[Logan Marshall-Green]], [[Alexandra Shipp]], [[Kerry Bish\u00e9]], and [[Angela Sarafyan]]) as part of video calls made between them, and the player will need to use tools provided from the game to piece together events and what statements may be lies to determine the overall mystery.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Telling lies screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|''Telling Lies'' is played out on a virtual desktop computer screen with its own operating system. The reflection of the player-character can be seen off the virtual monitor.]] \nBarlow describes ''Telling Lies'' as a \"desktop thriller\" like ''Her Story'', where the player becomes involved in a drama that is played out through stored video clips and other information presented on a virtual computer desktop.<ref name=\"dtoid e3\"/> ''Telling Lies'' provides the player with numerous video segments that in the game's narrative, cover a two-year period and which have been stored on a stolen hard-drive taken from the [[National Security Agency]]. The player has the ability to search the hundreds of video segments on keywords as to piece together timelines, events, and interactions, all to try to understand why the four central people have been the subject of electronic surveillance, as well as the nature of the player-character's role in these events; this character appears female and can be seen in a virtual reflection of the in-game computer screen to the actual player. However, these clips only provide the video and audio from one side of the conversation, requiring the player to determine which clips may match the other participants, as well as potential interactions with around 30 other people.<ref name=\"polygon\">{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/27/18283175/telling-lies-game-sam-barlow-preview-gdc-2019 | title = Her Story follow-up takes place on a stolen NSA hard drive | first=  Chelsea | last= Stark | date = 27 March 2019 | accessdate = 27 March 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref><ref name=\"dtoid e3\">{{cite web | url = https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/06/17/sam-barlow-telling-lies-interview-e3-2019/ | title = \u2018I hate repeating a trick\u2019 - the writer of Telling Lies on going back to the desktop thriller | first = Brendan | last=  Caldwell | date = 17 June 2019 | accessdate = 17 June 2019 | work = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}</ref> Players can scroll forwards and backwards within segments, highlight certain words in the video subtitles to use as search, and keep notes within an in-game memo pad.<ref name=\"dtoid e3\"/> The player only has a limited amount of time within a single playthrough to scan material from the hard-drive, and would have to restart from scratch (losing all notes and bookmarks) if they want to see more.<ref name=\"eurog review\"/> Barlow estimated that the content within ''Telling Lies'' is about four to five times longer than ''Her Story''.<ref name=\"pcgamer\">{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/see-the-first-teaser-for-telling-lies-the-new-game-from-the-creator-of-her-story/ | title = See the first teaser for Telling Lies, the next game from the creator of Her Story | first1 = Tim | last1= Clark | first2 = Jody | last2 = MacGregor | date = 27 March 2019 | accessdate = 27 March 2019 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref> There are three different endings that the player may reach through the game, depending on which character's videos they explored most frequently.<ref name=\"pcgamer multiple\">{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/telling-lies-endings-good-bad-how-to-get/ | title = Here's how you see all the endings in Telling Lies | first = Andy | last= Kelly | date = August 29, 2019 | accessdate = August 29, 2019 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref>\n\n{{clear|left}}\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|date=September 2019}}\nIn 2019, Karen Douglas, a former FBI agent, goes back to her apartment at midnight to turn on her computer and access the content of an external USB drive. She then watches the videos by searching them using keywords.\n\nDavid Smith, the main character, was an FBI agent. He and his wife, Emma, have a daughter Alba. After David went undercover, Emma\u2019s mother, Laura, moved in. During David's mission, Laura developed dementia and eventually passed away, despite medical care by an anaesthesiologist named Steven who was hired by the couple.\n\nIt is revealed that when David was Emma's then-boyfriend, he killed Paul, who was Emma\u2019s abusive ex-boyfriend. David waited outside for Paul to enter Emma\u2019s house. Then David went inside and used his pistol to shoot Paul, who was unarmed, in the lungs, and then watched him bleed to death, with Emma as an unwilling accomplice.\n\nDuring the years of 2017 and 2018, David was an undercover special agent supervised by an agent named Mike, working on a case code-named as Green Dagger. The aim of the operation was to demonstrate the intention of environmental groups to break the law and commit acts of terrorism. The main target of the operation was a group called \"Green Storm\" lead by an activity named Riordan. To infiltrate this group, David was to begin by infiltrate a smaller team called the \"Organizing Group\" led by Eric and Peter.\n\nThe Organizing group's main target was a corporation in [[Detroit, Michigan]] called Prosperen, who wished to build natural gas plants in the area. In particular the organisation was building a pipeline which the activist groups believed would pollute the water source. Mike instructed David to use the alias David Jones and infiltrate the group. They targeted Ava, who was referred to as \u201cSnow White\u201d. David approached Ava and developed a romantic relationship with her, based on their mutual love for music. David gained Ava\u2019s trust and used this to get invited to the Organizing group.\n\nThe Organizing Group was initially made up of Eric, Chris, Peter, and Simon. Simon was secretly a black flag agent providing information to the FBI, an arrangement David was unhappy with as he felt Simon was unprofessional. As David begun to ingratiate himself with the group, he discovered that Peter, one of the leaders, had previously slept with Ava while she was underage, drugged her and filmed some of what they had done. David brutally attacks Peter, receiving an official reprimand from the FBI, and incurring Ava's anger. Unashamed, he then proceeds to use a contact from his past, Harry, to acquire drugs which he plants on Peter to frame him. \n\nAs David gets increasingly edgy, he decides to out Simon as a Black Flag Spy. While these actions, and his growing closeness to Ava, alarms Mike, it also impresses Eric, and David moves forwards with the plan. He invites Riordan and the Organizing Group to discuss plans to disrupt movement on a key bridge which Prosperen needs access to proceed with the pipeline. While staying on the boat, Ava reveals that she is pregnant with David's child.\n\nDavid discusses with a new Black Flag employee who has infiltrated Green Storm their plan to try to trap Riordan into getting involved in a direct attack, namely destroying a bridge. However during the meeting the Black Flag employee doesn't follow the script, and David's speech is not well received. A frustrated David calls Mike only to discover that Mike has agreed with Black Flag to hold off on Green Storm, and just arrest the Organizing Group, including Ava. David argues strongly that the operation should continue, and that Ava should not be arrested, but Mike tells him to kill David Jones (His cover name).\n\nThe Organizing Group is then arrested, including Ava who is on a call with David when the arrest occurs. While David expresses anger to Mike, Mike notes that David had been withholding information in his reports, including Ava's pregnancy. David tries to continue meeting with the Organizing Group, but Karen Douglas, his field supervisor, bursts in an attempt to provide him cover to leave. David is furious with Karen, but after some discussion back and forth with Mike, he agrees to withdraw. Ava is heartbroken by David's sudden disappearance, and outraged by David's decision to leave her money.\n\nDuring this mission, David had been having regular conversations with a sex worker named Maxine Williams, who ran a webcam chatroom with multiple aliases. David paid her for conversation, and over time shared personal stories with Maxine including his identity as a federal special agent, and his relationship with Emma and Ava. As his life falls apart, David, believing he has a real connection with Maxine, tries to connect with her. She first bans him, and then, when he comes back with a different credit card, reveals that everything he knows about her is a lie, and that she has recorded all their conversations, and will release them if he keeps following her.\n\nDavid decides to track her down, using Harry to find her, and locates her. Maxine is prepared, and has already released the videos, and shoots David in the leg, with the police arriving shortly after.\n\nAfter being shot, David reconnects with Mike, saying that David Jones is dead. Some time passes, during which David is living alone, estranged from both his wife and his girlfriend. He tries to reconnect with both, but both reject him. David finally breaks down, and decides to commit suicide by blowing the explosives on his boat, potentially destroying the bridge as well.\n\nFinishing reviewing some of the videos, Karen uploads and leaks the video content she has watched. She destroys the hard drive of her computer, bypasses the FBI agents who are searching in the area, and walks up the stairs to the rooftop. She smokes a cigarette and enjoys the sunrise.\n\nThe mid-credits scene shows one of the three women\u2019s (Emma\u2019s, Ava\u2019s, or Maxine\u2019s) fate, depending on the videos the player has watched.<ref name=\"pcgamer multiple\"/> Both Emma and Ava move on to a new life without David and continue to raise their daughters. Maxine leaves her place in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and  decides to open a cam agency in New York. Maxine goes on to become a novelist writing crime stories with \u2018strong female leads\u2019.\n\n==Development==\nBarlow's work on ''Telling Lies'' began in January 2016 as a \"[[spiritual successor]]\" to ''Her Story'', with a narrative unrelated to the first game, though it continued to use full-motion video as its central gameplay element.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/her-story-2-is-on-the-way/ |title=Her Story 2 is on the way |last=Morrison |first=Angus |work=[[PC Gamer]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |date=25 January 2016 |accessdate=26 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6enpASSwX?url=http://www.pcgamer.com/her-story-2-is-on-the-way/ |archivedate=25 January 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/01/her-story-sequel/ |title=Heavily Redacted Tweet Teases a Her Story Sequel |last=Muncy |first=Julie |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]] |date=25 January 2016 |accessdate=26 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6eoMnRrk8?url=http://www.wired.com/2016/01/her-story-sequel/ |archivedate=25 January 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Through some had urged him to make a direct sequel to ''Her Story'' by creating another murder mystery and putting another actor in place, Barlow wanted something that was more risky, and utilising the aspects of ''Her Story'' where the player got to know more about the main character through the clips.<ref name=\"pcgamer\"/> He came to the concept of electronic surveillance as a central theme in part of being a parent himself and wanting to keep track of his own pre-teen-aged son's online activities.<ref name=\"pcgamer\"/> In reading up about surveillance methods used by the National Security Agency and [[MI5]], Barlow read up on the [[Optic Nerve (GCHQ)|Optic Nerve]] program and found that it had several similarities to ''Her Story'', including the ability to search on stored video and audio through keywords.<ref name=\"pcgamer\"/> \n\nIn July 2017, Barlow announced that the game, titled ''Telling Lies'', would feature three to four key characters. He described the game as a combination of the films ''[[The Conversation]]'' (1974) and ''[[Shame (2011 film)|Shame]]'' (2011). The game was published by [[Annapurna Interactive]] and shooting for the game had been scheduled to start in late 2017 or early 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/her-story-creator-reveals-new-game-will-be-called-telling-lies/ |title=Her Story creator reveals new game will be called Telling Lies |last=Chalk |first=Andy |work=[[PC Gamer]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |date=14 July 2017 |accessdate=14 July 2017 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6sczV6Mui?url=http://www.pcgamer.com/her-story-creator-reveals-new-game-will-be-called-telling-lies/ |archivedate=11 August 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> For filming, Barlow wanted the conversations between characters to appear natural, ideally filming both actors as they conversed but from different locations.

It is located near the midpoint of the [[Calgary\u2013Edmonton Corridor]] and is surrounded by [[Red Deer County]]. It is Alberta's third most populous city{{cn|date=March 2020}} after [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], and before [[Lethbridge]]. The city is located in [[aspen parkland]], a region of rolling hills that is home to oil, grain, and cattle production. It is a centre for oil and agriculture distribution, and the surrounding region is a major centre for petrochemical production. With a recorded population of 100,418 in the Canada [[2016 Canadian Census|2016 census]], Red Deer became the third Alberta city to surpass 100,000 people.<ref name=2016censusABmunis/>\n\n== History ==\nPrior to European settlement, the area was a gathering place that was inhabited by Aboriginal tribes including the [[Blackfoot]], Plains [[Cree]] and [[Stoney First Nation|Stoney]]. European fur traders began passing through the area in the late eighteenth century. Into this ethnic mix, the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] peoples also emerged.\n\nA [[First Nations|native trail]] ran from [[Montana]] in the south across the [[Bow River]] near Calgary and on to [[Fort Edmonton]]. About halfway between Calgary and Edmonton, the trail crossed the [[Red Deer River]] at a wide, stony shallow used by [[First Nations]] peoples and [[American bison|bison]], [[Bison vs Buffalo|commonly known as buffalo]], since ancient times. The shallows, now known as the Old Red Deer Crossing, are about {{convert|7|km}} upstream from the present City of Red Deer.\n\nWith the establishment of [[Fort Calgary]] by the [[North-West Mounted Police]] in 1875, traffic increased along what was by then known as the [[Calgary and Edmonton Trail]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albertatrailnet.com/downloads/December2002.pdf |format=PDF |title=Calgary and Edmonton Trail |author=Alberta Trail Net |date=December 2002 |accessdate=2009-09-14 ||url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705020554/http://www.albertatrailnet.com/downloads/December2002.pdf |archivedate=July 5, 2008 }}</ref> After the arrival of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] in Calgary, traffic along the \"C & E\" trail increased substantially. A [[trading post]] and [[stopping house]] were built at the Crossing in 1882 and a permanent settlement began to develop around it.\n\nDuring the 1885 [[North-West Rebellion|Riel Rebellion]] (also known as the [[North-West Rebellion]]), the [[Canadian militia]] constructed [[Fort Normandeau]] at the Crossing. The fort was later taken over by the North-West Mounted Police who used it until 1893.\n\nWith the decimation of the bison by hunters, the Aboriginal tribes who relied on them for food, clothing and shelter were also in decline. The fertile lands around the Red Deer River were attractive to farmers and ranchers. One early settler, the Reverend Leonard Gaetz, gave a half-share of {{convert|1240|acre|km2}} he had acquired to the [[Calgary and Edmonton Railway]] to develop a bridge over the river and a townsite. As a result, the Crossing was gradually abandoned. The first train from Calgary to Edmonton passed through Red Deer in 1891.\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe [[Cree]] peoples called the river on which Red Deer stands {{transl|cr|Waskasoo Seepee}}, which translates to \"[[Elk]] River\". However, British traders translated the name as \"Red Deer River\", since they mistakenly thought elk were European [[red deer]]. Later, the settlers of the area named their community after the river.<ref name=history>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/Visitors/About+Red+Deer/History/default.htm | title=History of Red Deer | publisher=City of Red Deer | accessdate=November 15, 2013 | |url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204024702/http://www.reddeer.ca/Visitors/About+Red+Deer/History/default.htm | archivedate=December 4, 2013 | df= }}</ref> The name for the modern city in Plains Cree is a [[calque]] back from English of the mistranslated, {{transl|cr|mihkw\u00e2pisimosos}} literally \"red type of deer\" while the name of the river itself is still {{transl|cr|w\u00e2w\u00e2sk\u00easiw-s\u00eepiy}} or \"elk river\".<ref>http://www.creedictionary.com/search/?q=Red+Deer&scope=0</ref>\n\n=== Leonard Gaetz ===\n{{Main|Leonard Gaetz}}\n[[Leonard Gaetz]] acted as the local land agent for the Saskatchewan Colonization Company and purchased parts of three other sections from his employers. By 1890, the Gaetz family owned vast land holdings along the south bank of the Red Deer River around the mouth of the Waskasoo Creek. The holdings included parts of Sections 16, 17, 20 and 21. Leonard Gaetz's increasing wealth allowed his family to play a central role in the growth of Red Deer.\n\nIn 1895, Gaetz returned to the active ministry in Manitoba. Once again, this proved detrimental to his health. He retired back to Red Deer in 1901, and resided here for the remainder of his life. He was a strong promoter of the area, founding the Westerner showgrounds and annual \"Westerner Days\", akin to the Calgary Stampede. He died in Red Deer in 1907.\n\n=== 1900 to 1929 ===\nRed Deer saw a massive influx of settlers in the early 1900s.\n[[File:Michener Centre.jpg|thumbnail|Michener Centre]]\nIn 1901, when Red Deer was incorporated as a town, the population stood at 343. Through its location midway between Edmonton and Calgary and the fertile land that supported profitable mixed farming, Red Deer developed primarily as an agricultural service and distribution centre. A further boost came in 1907 when it was chosen as a major divisional point for the Canadian Pacific Railway. Two other railways, the [[Alberta Central Railway]] and the [[Canadian Northern Railway]], entered the community in 1911. Red Deer underwent a large land boom.\n\nOn March 25, 1913, Red Deer was incorporated as a city and the population had jumped to nearly 2,800.\n\n[[World War I]] brought a sharp end to the boom. Red Deer emerged as a small, quiet, but prosperous, prairie city. In 1922, the provincial institution for the care of the mentally handicapped, currently known as the Michener Centre, was established in the city. Prospects looked good for modest but sustainable growth.\n\n=== 1930 to 1945 ===\nThe [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s was a major setback for the city, though it fared better than some communities. Central Alberta was not hit by severe drought. The city was virtually debt-free and profited from its ownership of the local public utilities.\n\nGrowth returned to the city with the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Red Deer was chosen as the location of a large military training camp, the A-20 Camp which was located where Cormack Armoury, the Memorial Centre and Lindsay Thurber High School are now located. The [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] built two air bases to the south of the city at [[Penhold, Alberta|Penhold]] and [[Bowden, Alberta|Bowden]].\n\n=== Post Second World War ===\nOn January 1, 1948, the City of Red Deer amalgamated with the Village of [[North Red Deer, Alberta|North Red Deer]], located on the north bank of the Red Deer River.<ref name=Century>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/North+Red+Deer+A+Century+of+Change.htm | publisher=City of Red Deer | title=North Red Deer: A Century of Change | year=2011 | accessdate=2011-07-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928123524/http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/North+Red+Deer+A+Century+of+Change.htm | archive-date=2011-09-28 | |url-status=dead | df= }}</ref><ref name=Centennial>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/default.htm | publisher=City of Red Deer | title=2011 Village of North Red Deer Centennial Celebrations | year=2011 | accessdate=2011-07-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623224607/http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/default.htm | archive-date=2011-06-23 | |url-status=dead | df= }}</ref>\n\nBy roughly 1991, the Canadian Pacific Railway had been removed from the inner city; the track currently runs parallel to the city outskirts. The most prominent landmark of the railway remaining is the CPR bridge spanning the Red Deer River, converted to a walking trail shortly after the track removal.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe city is now a centre for [[petroleum extraction|oil]] and [[natural gas extraction]] and related industries and also for agriculture and agricultural services. It is a regional centre for administration with a courthouse and provincial building. It also has major stores in malls such as Bower Place, Southpointe Common, Parkland Mall and many other locations.\n\n== Geography ==\nRed Deer is located on the [[Red Deer River]], from which it derives its name.\n\n=== Climate ===\nRed Deer has a humid [[continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''[[Humid continental climate#Dfb/Dwb: Warm summer subtype|Dfb]]''), with somewhat of a semi-arid influence.

It is located near the midpoint of the [[Calgary\u2013Edmonton Corridor]] and is surrounded by [[Red Deer County]]. It is Alberta's third most populous city{{cn|date=March 2020}} after [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], and before [[Lethbridge]]. The city is located in [[aspen parkland]], a region of rolling hills that is home to oil, grain, and cattle production. It is a centre for oil and agriculture distribution, and the surrounding region is a major centre for petrochemical production. With a recorded population of 100,418 in the Canada [[2016 Canadian Census|2016 census]], Red Deer became the third Alberta city to surpass 100,000 people.<ref name=2016censusABmunis/>\n\n== History ==\nPrior to European settlement, the area was a gathering place that was inhabited by Aboriginal tribes including the [[Blackfoot]], Plains [[Cree]] and [[Stoney First Nation|Stoney]]. European fur traders began passing through the area in the late eighteenth century. Into this ethnic mix, the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] peoples also emerged.\n\nA [[First Nations|native trail]] ran from [[Montana]] in the south across the [[Bow River]] near Calgary and on to [[Fort Edmonton]]. About halfway between Calgary and Edmonton, the trail crossed the [[Red Deer River]] at a wide, stony shallow used by [[First Nations]] peoples and [[American bison|bison]], [[Bison vs Buffalo|commonly known as buffalo]], since ancient times. The shallows, now known as the Old Red Deer Crossing, are about {{convert|7|km}} upstream from the present City of Red Deer.\n\nWith the establishment of [[Fort Calgary]] by the [[North-West Mounted Police]] in 1875, traffic increased along what was by then known as the [[Calgary and Edmonton Trail]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albertatrailnet.com/downloads/December2002.pdf |format=PDF |title=Calgary and Edmonton Trail |author=Alberta Trail Net |date=December 2002 |accessdate=2009-09-14 ||url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705020554/http://www.albertatrailnet.com/downloads/December2002.pdf |archivedate=July 5, 2008 }}</ref> After the arrival of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] in Calgary, traffic along the \"C & E\" trail increased substantially. A [[trading post]] and [[stopping house]] were built at the Crossing in 1882 and a permanent settlement began to develop around it.\n\nDuring the 1885 [[North-West Rebellion|Riel Rebellion]] (also known as the [[North-West Rebellion]]), the [[Canadian militia]] constructed [[Fort Normandeau]] at the Crossing. The fort was later taken over by the North-West Mounted Police who used it until 1893.\n\nWith the decimation of the bison by hunters, the Aboriginal tribes who relied on them for food, clothing and shelter were also in decline. The fertile lands around the Red Deer River were attractive to farmers and ranchers. One early settler, the Reverend Leonard Gaetz, gave a half-share of {{convert|1240|acre|km2}} he had acquired to the [[Calgary and Edmonton Railway]] to develop a bridge over the river and a townsite. As a result, the Crossing was gradually abandoned. The first train from Calgary to Edmonton passed through Red Deer in 1891.\n\n=== Name origin ===\nThe [[Cree]] peoples called the river on which Red Deer stands {{transl|cr|Waskasoo Seepee}}, which translates to \"[[Elk]] River\". However, British traders translated the name as \"Red Deer River\", since they mistakenly thought elk were European [[red deer]]. Later, the settlers of the area named their community after the river.<ref name=history>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/Visitors/About+Red+Deer/History/default.htm | title=History of Red Deer | publisher=City of Red Deer | accessdate=November 15, 2013 | |url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204024702/http://www.reddeer.ca/Visitors/About+Red+Deer/History/default.htm | archivedate=December 4, 2013 | df= }}</ref> The name for the modern city in Plains Cree is a [[calque]] back from English of the mistranslated, {{transl|cr|mihkw\u00e2pisimosos}} literally \"red type of deer\" while the name of the river itself is still {{transl|cr|w\u00e2w\u00e2sk\u00easiw-s\u00eepiy}} or \"elk river\".<ref>http://www.creedictionary.com/search/?q=Red+Deer&scope=0</ref>\n\n=== Leonard Gaetz ===\n{{Main|Leonard Gaetz}}\n[[Leonard Gaetz]] acted as the local land agent for the Saskatchewan Colonization Company and purchased parts of three other sections from his employers. By 1890, the Gaetz family owned vast land holdings along the south bank of the Red Deer River around the mouth of the Waskasoo Creek. The holdings included parts of Sections 16, 17, 20 and 21. Leonard Gaetz's increasing wealth allowed his family to play a central role in the growth of Red Deer.\n\nIn 1895, Gaetz returned to the active ministry in Manitoba. Once again, this proved detrimental to his health. He retired back to Red Deer in 1901, and resided here for the remainder of his life. He was a strong promoter of the area, founding the Westerner showgrounds and annual \"Westerner Days\", akin to the Calgary Stampede. He died in Red Deer in 1907.\n\n=== 1900 to 1929 ===\nRed Deer saw a massive influx of settlers in the early 1900s.\n[[File:Michener Centre.jpg|thumbnail|Michener Centre]]\nIn 1901, when Red Deer was incorporated as a town, the population stood at 343. Through its location midway between Edmonton and Calgary and the fertile land that supported profitable mixed farming, Red Deer developed primarily as an agricultural service and distribution centre. A further boost came in 1907 when it was chosen as a major divisional point for the Canadian Pacific Railway. Two other railways, the [[Alberta Central Railway]] and the [[Canadian Northern Railway]], entered the community in 1911. Red Deer underwent a large land boom.\n\nOn March 25, 1913, Red Deer was incorporated as a city and the population had jumped to nearly 2,800.\n\n[[World War I]] brought a sharp end to the boom. Red Deer emerged as a small, quiet, but prosperous, prairie city. In 1922, the provincial institution for the care of the mentally handicapped, currently known as the Michener Centre, was established in the city. Prospects looked good for modest but sustainable growth.\n\n=== 1930 to 1945 ===\nThe [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s was a major setback for the city, though it fared better than some communities. Central Alberta was not hit by severe drought. The city was virtually debt-free and profited from its ownership of the local public utilities.\n\nGrowth returned to the city with the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Red Deer was chosen as the location of a large military training camp, the A-20 Camp which was located where Cormack Armoury, the Memorial Centre and Lindsay Thurber High School are now located. The [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] built two air bases to the south of the city at [[Penhold, Alberta|Penhold]] and [[Bowden, Alberta|Bowden]].\n\n=== Post Second World War ===\nOn January 1, 1948, the City of Red Deer amalgamated with the Village of [[North Red Deer, Alberta|North Red Deer]], located on the north bank of the Red Deer River.<ref name=Century>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/North+Red+Deer+A+Century+of+Change.htm | publisher=City of Red Deer | title=North Red Deer: A Century of Change | year=2011 | accessdate=2011-07-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928123524/http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/North+Red+Deer+A+Century+of+Change.htm | archive-date=2011-09-28 | |url-status=dead | df= }}</ref><ref name=Centennial>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/default.htm | publisher=City of Red Deer | title=2011 Village of North Red Deer Centennial Celebrations | year=2011 | accessdate=2011-07-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623224607/http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/default.htm | archive-date=2011-06-23 | |url-status=dead | df= }}</ref>\n\nBy roughly 1991, the Canadian Pacific Railway had been removed from the inner city; the track currently runs parallel to the city outskirts. The most prominent landmark of the railway remaining is the CPR bridge spanning the Red Deer River, converted to a walking trail shortly after the track removal.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe city is now a centre for [[petroleum extraction|oil]] and [[natural gas extraction]] and related industries and also for agriculture and agricultural services. It is a regional centre for administration with a courthouse and provincial building. It also has major stores in malls such as Bower Place, Southpointe Common, Parkland Mall and many other locations.\n\n== Geography ==\nRed Deer is located on the [[Red Deer River]], from which it derives its name.\n\n=== Climate ===\nRed Deer has a humid [[continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''[[Humid continental climate#Dfb/Dwb: Warm summer subtype|Dfb]]''), with somewhat of a semi-arid influence. The highest temperature ever recorded in Red Deer was {{convert|37.2|C|0}} on 8 July 1906,<ref name=\"July 1906\"/> 2 July 1924,<ref name=\"July 1924\"/> and 28 & 29 June 1937.<ref name=\"June
