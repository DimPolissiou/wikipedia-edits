He was out of the [[mare (horse)|mare]] Helsinki, who had been only an average runner, but who was a full sister to [[Street Cry]]. Shamardal's damsire was [[Machiavellian (horse)|Machiavellian]], a son of the [[leading sire in North America]], [[Mr. Prospector]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pedigreequery.com/shamardal |title=Shamardal Horse Pedigree |publisher=Pedigreequery.com |date=1 July 2005 |accessdate=1 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2002, his breeders put him up for sale at the [[Keeneland Sales]] but when the bidding failed to meet their reserve price they decided to wait until the following year to auction him again. In early 2003, the yearling began to exhibit a subtle lack of coordination and an abnormal clumsiness in his gaits. He was soon diagnosed with a Grade 3 level of [[Wobbler disease|cervical vertebral malformation syndrome]], a spinal disorder commonly referred to by horsemen as the \"wobbles\". The disease means the horse will likely never race and usually results in their having to be [[Animal euthanasia|euthanized]] because their condition can cause them to collapse without warning that could result in severe injury to a handler. Shipped to specialists at [[Ohio State University]], [[x-ray]]s and a [[myelogram]] confirmed the condition. As such, his breeder/owners filed an insurance claim and turned ownership over to the insurance company where the colt became a standard case for euthanasia.\n\nRichard Ketch, a former [[show jumping|show horse]] trainer and [[farrier]], became involved with the case as an adjuster for the insurers. As someone very familiar with the disease, he believed that there were alternative treatments that might save the colt's life. On Ketch's initiative, an agreement was reached with the insurance company to turn the colt over to him and his associate Herwig Schoen, a self-proclaimed \"energy healer\". Some call their treatment program \"voodoo medicine\", pointing out that research has shown that in about ten percent of these cases within twelve to fifteen months a horse will recover on its own. Nonetheless, under Ketch and his associates the colt made a full recovery.\n\nCertified sound by multiple professionals, Ketch sent him to the October 2003 [[Tattersalls|Tattersalls Houghton Yearling Sale]] at [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] in [[England]] where [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Sheikh Mohammed's]] [[Gainsborough Stud]] acquired the colt they would name Shamardal. However, the string of bad luck continued as he was sold for the very small price of 50,000 [[guineas]] after an [[Endoscopy|endoscopic]] test of his breathing passages had erroneously diagnosed him as having breathing problems.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moss |first=Randy |url=http://espn.go.com/horse/columns/misc/1977978.html |title=ESPN.com \u2013 Horse Racing \u2013 After a shaky start, Shamardal looks for a rosy future |publisher=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=1 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Racing career==\n\n===2004: two-year-old season===\nBecause the Maktoum family has such large worldwide racing stables, they sometimes follow the industry practice of leasing out some of their horses. Shamardal was one. Leased to businessman Abdulla Buhaleeba, the colt was prepared for racing by [[horse trainer|trainer]] [[Mark Johnston (racehorse trainer)|Mark Johnston]].\n\nShamardal first raced in 2004 at age two, winning a six-furlong maiden at [[Scotland|Scotland's]] [[Ayr Racecourse]] in which he ran away from the field and won by eight lengths. He then was entered in the 28 July [[Conditions races|Group Two]] [[Vintage Stakes]] at [[Goodwood Racecourse]] in [[Chichester]], [[England]]. He won that seven-[[furlong]] race by {{frac|2|1|2}} lengths and in the process defeated [[Wilko (horse)|Wilko]], who went on to win that autumn's [[Breeders' Cup Juvenile]] in the United States. Following the race, the lease arrangement between Gainsborough Stud and Abdulla Buhaleeba was terminated for reasons that have never been made public.\n\nRacing under the Gainsborough Stud banner, Shamardal ran into training problems that kept him out of racing until the 16 October [[Dewhurst Stakes]] at [[Newmarket Racecourse]]. In what is considered England's most important race for two-year-olds, Shamardal easily won the [[Group One]] event by {{frac|2|1|2}} lengths. Undefeated after three races, he was voted the 2004 [[Cartier Champion Two-year-old Colt|European Champion Two-Year-Old]].\n\n===2005: three-year-old season===\nCompeting at age three under the Maktoum family's [[Godolphin Racing]] banner, Shamardal was conditioned by their head trainer, [[Saeed bin Suroor]]. The colt made his 2005 debut in the [[UAE Derby]] at [[Nad Al Sheba Racecourse]] in [[Dubai]] but performed poorly in his first race on dirt. Sent to [[France]], where he was back on grass, under jockey [[Frankie Dettori]] he turned back several challenges in the straight while winning the Group One [[Poule d'Essai des Poulains]] at [[Longchamp Racecourse]]. He then captured the important [[Prix du Jockey Club]], a Group One race he won by a head over [[Hurricane Run]], who ran erratically in his run to the finish line.\n\nReturned to England for his next start at [[York Racecourse]] in June's [[St. James's Palace Stakes]], Shamardal won his third Group One race of 2005 and the fourth of his career. While in training for his next scheduled start in the [[Eclipse Stakes]], he  fractured a front [[fetlock joint]] and was retired having never lost on the turf.\n\n==Stud career==\nHe stood at [[horse breeding|stud]] at Sheikh Mohammed's [[Darley Stud|Kildangan Stud]] near [[Kildangan]], [[Ireland]]. As a stallion, he is the sire of [[Mukhadram]], [[Dan Excel]], [[Able Friend]], [[Lumiere (horse)|Lumiere]], [[Lope de Vega (horse)|Lope de Vega]], and [[Pinatubo (horse)|Pinatubo]].\n\nShamardal was euthanised at Kildangan Stud in April 2020 following health issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racingpost.com/news/latest/multiple-group-1-winner-and-top-class-stallion-shamardal-dies-aged-18/431766|title=Multiple Group 1 winner and top-class stallion Shamardal dies aged 18|first=David|last=Baxter|work=Racing Post |date=16 April 2020 |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===Major winners===\n''c = [[colt (horse)|colt]], f = [[filly]], g = [[gelding]]''\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

It was produced by [[Karan Johar]],who is known to launch star kids,Hiroo Yash Johar and Apoorva Mehta under the banner [[Dharma Productions]], and was distributed by [[Fox Star Studios]]. A sequel to the same stupid 2012 film ''[[Student of the Year]]'', it stars [[Tiger Shroff]],who is the son of [[Jackie Shroff]], [[Tara Sutaria]] and [[Ananya Panday]],both daughters of [[Salman Khan]]. The film follows Rohan Sachdev, a 30 year old college student who switches to a non-real university to rekindle his relationship with his childhood sister like friend who studies there. When Rohan is rusticated, he returns to his old college and vows to lead his new team to victory in an inter-college cup against his former college, thereby becoming Student of the Year because he is the star of the movie and gets both girl in the end.\nIt was heavily panned by critics and audience alike and it holds a rating of 7% on Rotten tomatoes.<ref>https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/student_of_the_year_2</ref>\n\n''Student of the Year 2'' was announced in November 2017. Initially, Malhotra and Shroff were to collaborate for a different film; when they found the final script unsatisfactory, they tweaked it and planned to make it a sequel. It marks the debut of both Sutaria and Panday, and pursues a plot that is unrelated to its predecessor. [[Principal photography]] for the film began in April 2018 at [[Dehradun]], and ended in September 2018. The film's soundtrack was composed by [[Vishal-Shekhar]], with lyrics written by [[Anvita Dutt Guptan]], [[Kumaar]] and Vayu, and released under the banner [[Zee Music Company]].\n\n''Student of the Year 2'' was theatrically released in India on 10 May 2019. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, with the script, unreal situation and unrealistic depiction of Indian schools thus receiving criticism; Shroff's action sequences were praised. As of 7 June 2019, it has earned {{INR|link=yes}}97.81 [[crore]] worldwide, against a budget of {{INR}}65 crore, including promotion and advertising costs.<!--Sourced in body, do not remove-->\n\n== Plot ==\n{{plot|date=December 2019}} <!--per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words--> \nRohan Sachdev is a middle class student of the Pishorilal Chamandas College in [[Mussoorie]]. His relationship with former classmate and childhood sweetheart Mridula Chawla is affected when Mridula transfers to St. Teresa's High School, a college in Dehradun for the wealthy and privileged. Rohan is unable to afford their fees and is left back, but vows to make his cut. To be together with Mridula, he applies for a scholarship under the sports quota in the college and manages to gain admission. Meanwhile, Mridula has changed her identity and rechristened herself as Mia Chawla to fit in with others at her new college. Upon meeting Rohan, she initially stays away from him because of his relatively inferior spark, but they soon begin a relationship again, after Rohan starts being recognized as a sportsman.\n\nRohan is introduced to Manav Singh Randhawa, a rich and affluent student and two-time winner of the Student of the Year Cup. The two become quick friends, but Rohan remains at loggerheads with Manav's sister Shreya Randhawa, who appears to be a spoilt brat and detests him, often playing pranks on him that cause him trouble. Manav organizes a superhero-themed birthday party for his friends where Rohan and Mia are invited, but a prank by Shreya results in Rohan's friends from Pishorilal Chamandas getting insulted and beaten, only for them to disown Rohan, who realizes that the prank was Shreya's brainchild. Friction between the two reaches an alarming height when Shreya sprays Rohan's bicycle fully pink as he had used her parking space. A private meeting in Principal Gujral's office is called for, and Shreya's father, college chief trustee Sukesh Randhawa, slaps Shreya, and walks away giving word to Rohan for a compensation for the damage. Rohan tries to convince her for a healthy friendship, but Shreya rebuffs his proposal, taking the slap to heart.\n\nThe college, meanwhile, announces a dance competition, where Rohan and Mia are set up against Manav and Shreya. Mia wishes to win the contest and attain popularity, while Shreya wants to convince Sukesh of her skills in dance and enroll in a dance school in London. Manav and Shreya win the contest after Mia falters during a step. When Rohan goes to console Mia, he instead finds her getting intimate with Manav, and realises that Manav, knowing Mia had a crush on him, had planted her to spoil Rohan's performance since he saw him as a threat to his image.\n\nRohan punches Manav, and is expelled from St. Teresa's. Before leaving the campus, Manav and his gang attack Rohan and beat him vigorously, throwing him out of the campus gate unconscious. Initially finding himself struggling to deal with what he sees as Mia's betrayal, he goes back and challenges Manav saying he, and not Manav, will be winning the Student of the Year trophy in 2019.\n\nRohan then returns back to Pishorilal Chamandas, where his old friends treat him with coldness and contempt. Shreya, who is impressed by Rohan's sincerity, convinces his friends to warm up to him, falling in love with him in the process after he helps her win a local dance competition and drops about her house to tell Sukesh that he should be proud of his daughter. Shreya reveals to Rohan that her mother's sudden demise upon her birth led Sukesh and Manav to consider her an ill omen for the house. At this point, Manav has already found out about Rohan and Shreya and tells the latter to refrain from meeting the former, misinterpreting Rohan's company with her as a sign of revenge, but she rebukes him. Rohan continues to avoid Mia despite her efforts to talk to him.\n\nHowever, a day after the local dance competition which he has helped Shreya win, Rohan finds Mia at his doorstep while hanging out with Shreya, and all three of them find out that a love triangle has taken them up when Mia reveals that she sent unattended letters to Rohan upon realizing that Manav was a cheater. Although she initially thinks Rohan and Mia would get back together, Rohan affirms his genuine love for Shreya through a warm, affectionate hug just as she is about to leave the hospital after visiting Rohan's rival Abhishek, who was left severely wounded after Manav and his friends beat him and Rohan's other classmates up. This was during a fight that broke out between the two student factions due to the comments thrown at Manav during the inauguration of the 29th Annual Inter-College Dignity Cup, an intercollegiate competition where Pishorilal has been finishing at the bottom of the chart for the past few years. Mia realizes that she has lost Rohan for good. Abhishek then makes amends and peace with Rohan, and they decide to fight back as a team when the former realizes that the latter risked himself in the fight.\n\nRohan and his teammates train hard to win the Dignity Cup, and Pishorilal Chamandas begins climbing up the score chart, getting a close second to St. Teresa's. Meanwhile, a saddened Mia hangs out with Rohan one night, when he tells her that he won't repeat a mistake he made while imagining their relationship, which was to assume her as his only goal in life. Mia leaves, dejected, but is fully satisfied and happy for Rohan and his newfound purpose in life, and she does not return to Manav. On the eve of the finale between St. Teresa's and Pishorilal Chamandas, an anxious Rohan proposes to Shreya, who accepts his love, and encourages him to fight for the right. Even though Manav and his teammates engage in foul play against Rohan's team, Rohan single-handedly takes them down after a bonus chance, gaining two extra points ahead of the rivals. All-time winner St.Teresa's loses the Dignity Cup for the first time, Rohan holding the trophy up high and became Student of the Year for the first time.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Tiger Shroff]] as Rohan Sachdev\n* [[Tara Sutaria]] as Mridula \"Mia\" Chawla\n* [[Ananya Panday]] as Shreya Randhawa\n* [[Aditya Seal]] as Manav Singh Randhawa\n* [[Samir Soni]] as Principal Avinash Gujral\n* [[Gul Panag]] as Coach Kuljeet Chaddha\n* [[Abhishek Bajaj]] as Abhishek Sharma\n* [[Manoj Pahwa]] as Coach Mahipal<ref name=\"mumbai\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.news18.com/photogallery/movies/tiger-shroff-shoots-with-ananya-pandey-tara-sutaria-for-soty-2-1781757-2.html |title=Tiger Shroff Shoots With Ananya Panday & Tara Sutaria For SOTY 2 |date=18 June 2018 |work=[[CNN-News18]] |access-date=9 May 2019}}</ref>\n* Ayesha Raza Mishra as Principal Archana Singh\n* [[Rajesh Kumar (actor)|Rajesh Kumar]] as Prem Narayan Sachdev, Rohan's uncle \n* [[Manasi Joshi Roy]] as Sushmita Sachdev, Rohan's aunt\n* [[Chetan Pandit]] as Sukesh Randhawa, Shreya and Manav's father\n* Samreen Kaur as Manorama Chawla, Mia's mother\n* [[Manjot Singh]] as Commentator Dimpy\n* [[Sahil Anand]] as Commentator Jeet Khurana\n* Daljeet Singh as Abdullah Wahab\n* Harsh Beniwal as Puggi\n* [[Alia Bhatt]] (special appearance in \"The Hook Up Song\")\n* Suryansh Kapoor as Junior Rohan\n* [[Will Smith]] (special appearance in \"The Jawaani Song\")\n* [[Farah Khan]] (special appearance as judge of \"The Jawaani Song\")\n* [[Vishal\u2013Shekhar]] (special appearance as judge of \"The Jawaani Song\")\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development and casting ===\n''Student of the Year 2'' is a sequel to the 2012 [[Karan Johar]]-directed romantic comedy-drama ''[[Student of the Year]]''.<ref name=\"khatter\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.news18.com/news/movies/student-of-the-year-2-karan-johar-quashes-reports-of-ishaan-khatter-featuring-with-tiger-shroff-in-film-1585495.html |title=Student of The Year 2: Karan Johar Quashes Reports of Ishaan Khatter Featuring With Tiger Shroff In Film |date=23 November 2017 |work=[[CNN-News18]] |access-date=8 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190430141412/https://www.news18.com/news/movies/student-of-the-year-2-karan-johar-quashes-reports-of-ishaan-khatter-featuring-with-tiger-shroff-in-film-1585495.html |archive-date=30 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Shortly after the commercial success of the first film, a sequel was announced by the producers.<ref name=\"tiger\" /> In November 2017, a press release by [[Dharma Productions]] revealed that the sequel is slated to release in 2018; it would be directed by [[Punit Malhotra]] and star [[Tiger Shroff]] in one of the leading roles.<ref name=\"tiger\" /> The film was announced four years after Malhotra's previous directorial ''[[Gori Tere Pyaar Mein]]'' (2013).<ref name=\"indiatoday.intoday.in\" /> It was to be produced in association by Johar's Dharma Productions and [[Fox Star Studios]].<ref name=\"tiger\" /> The film's announcement by the company initially conflated with that of their another production, ''[[Dhadak]]'' (2018), which roused speculation that Ishaan Khatter would star in the film.

It was produced by [[Karan Johar]], Hiroo Yash Johar and Apoorva Mehta under the banner [[Dharma Productions]], and was distributed by [[Fox Star Studios]]. A sequel to the 2012 film ''[[Student of the Year]]'', it stars [[Tiger Shroff]], [[Tara Sutaria]] and [[Ananya Panday]]. The film follows Rohan Sachdev, a college student who switches to a better university to rekindle his relationship with his childhood sweetheart who studies there. When Rohan is rusticated, he returns to his old college and vows to lead his new team to victory in an inter-college cup against his former college, thereby becoming Student of the Year.\nIt was heavily panned by critics and audience alike and it holds a rating of 7% on Rotten tomatoes.<ref>https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/student_of_the_year_2</ref>\n\n''Student of the Year 2'' was announced in November 2017. Initially, Malhotra and Shroff were to collaborate for a different film; when they found the final script unsatisfactory, they tweaked it and planned to make it a sequel. It marks the debut of both Sutaria and Panday, and pursues a plot that is unrelated to its predecessor. [[Principal photography]] for the film began in April 2018 at [[Dehradun]], and ended in September 2018. The film's soundtrack was composed by [[Vishal-Shekhar]], with lyrics written by [[Anvita Dutt Guptan]], [[Kumaar]] and Vayu, and released under the banner [[Zee Music Company]].\n\n''Student of the Year 2'' was theatrically released in India on 10 May 2019. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, with the script, unreal situation and unrealistic depiction of Indian schools thus receiving criticism; Shroff's action sequences were praised. As of 7 June 2019, it has earned {{INR|link=yes}}97.81 [[crore]] worldwide, against a budget of {{INR}}65 crore, including promotion and advertising costs.<!--Sourced in body, do not remove-->\n\n== Plot ==\n{{plot|date=December 2019}} <!--per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words--> \nRohan Sachdev is a middle class student of the Pishorilal Chamandas College in [[Mussoorie]]. His relationship with former classmate and childhood sweetheart Mridula Chawla is affected when Mridula transfers to St. Teresa's High School, a college in Dehradun for the wealthy and privileged. Rohan is unable to afford their fees and is left back, but vows to make his cut. To be together with Mridula, he applies for a scholarship under the sports quota in the college and manages to gain admission. Meanwhile, Mridula has changed her identity and rechristened herself as Mia Chawla to fit in with others at her new college. Upon meeting Rohan, she initially stays away from him because of his relatively inferior spark, but they soon begin a relationship again, after Rohan starts being recognized as a sportsman.\n\nRohan is introduced to Manav Singh Randhawa, a rich and affluent student and two-time winner of the Student of the Year Cup. The two become quick friends, but Rohan remains at loggerheads with Manav's sister Shreya Randhawa, who appears to be a spoilt brat and detests him, often playing pranks on him that cause him trouble. Manav organizes a superhero-themed birthday party for his friends where Rohan and Mia are invited, but a prank by Shreya results in Rohan's friends from Pishorilal Chamandas getting insulted and beaten, only for them to disown Rohan, who realizes that the prank was Shreya's brainchild. Friction between the two reaches an alarming height when Shreya sprays Rohan's bicycle fully pink as he had used her parking space. A private meeting in Principal Gujral's office is called for, and Shreya's father, college chief trustee Sukesh Randhawa, slaps Shreya, and walks away giving word to Rohan for a compensation for the damage. Rohan tries to convince her for a healthy friendship, but Shreya rebuffs his proposal, taking the slap to heart.\n\nThe college, meanwhile, announces a dance competition, where Rohan and Mia are set up against Manav and Shreya. Mia wishes to win the contest and attain popularity, while Shreya wants to convince Sukesh of her skills in dance and enroll in a dance school in London. Manav and Shreya win the contest after Mia falters during a step. When Rohan goes to console Mia, he instead finds her getting intimate with Manav, and realises that Manav, knowing Mia had a crush on him, had planted her to spoil Rohan's performance since he saw him as a threat to his image.\n\nRohan punches Manav, and is expelled from St. Teresa's. Before leaving the campus, Manav and his gang attack Rohan and beat him vigorously, throwing him out of the campus gate unconscious. Initially finding himself struggling to deal with what he sees as Mia's betrayal, he goes back and challenges Manav saying he, and not Manav, will be winning the Student of the Year trophy in 2019.\n\nRohan then returns back to Pishorilal Chamandas, where his old friends treat him with coldness and contempt. Shreya, who is impressed by Rohan's sincerity, convinces his friends to warm up to him, falling in love with him in the process after he helps her win a local dance competition and drops about her house to tell Sukesh that he should be proud of his daughter. Shreya reveals to Rohan that her mother's sudden demise upon her birth led Sukesh and Manav to consider her an ill omen for the house. At this point, Manav has already found out about Rohan and Shreya and tells the latter to refrain from meeting the former, misinterpreting Rohan's company with her as a sign of revenge, but she rebukes him. Rohan continues to avoid Mia despite her efforts to talk to him.\n\nHowever, a day after the local dance competition which he has helped Shreya win, Rohan finds Mia at his doorstep while hanging out with Shreya, and all three of them find out that a love triangle has taken them up when Mia reveals that she sent unattended letters to Rohan upon realizing that Manav was a cheater. Although she initially thinks Rohan and Mia would get back together, Rohan affirms his genuine love for Shreya through a warm, affectionate hug just as she is about to leave the hospital after visiting Rohan's rival Abhishek, who was left severely wounded after Manav and his friends beat him and Rohan's other classmates up. This was during a fight that broke out between the two student factions due to the comments thrown at Manav during the inauguration of the 29th Annual Inter-College Dignity Cup, an intercollegiate competition where Pishorilal has been finishing at the bottom of the chart for the past few years. Mia realizes that she has lost Rohan for good. Abhishek then makes amends and peace with Rohan, and they decide to fight back as a team when the former realizes that the latter risked himself in the fight.\n\nRohan and his teammates train hard to win the Dignity Cup, and Pishorilal Chamandas begins climbing up the score chart, getting a close second to St. Teresa's. Meanwhile, a saddened Mia hangs out with Rohan one night, when he tells her that he won't repeat a mistake he made while imagining their relationship, which was to assume her as his only goal in life. Mia leaves, dejected, but is fully satisfied and happy for Rohan and his newfound purpose in life, and she does not return to Manav. On the eve of the finale between St. Teresa's and Pishorilal Chamandas, an anxious Rohan proposes to Shreya, who accepts his love, and encourages him to fight for the right. Even though Manav and his teammates engage in foul play against Rohan's team, Rohan single-handedly takes them down after a bonus chance, gaining two extra points ahead of the rivals.

OTD expressed how the Karma Kamtsang forefathers and disciples maintained and propagated the teachings through study, teaching, and practice; thus, ripened generations of disciples through their wisdom, love, and power. OTD related that this activity of ''ripening'' disciples is the essential heart of the Kagyu history, the majesty and the true weight of the Kagyu teachings. He said that we need to continue to uphold the Lineage by preserving these fine deeds and activities. However, OTD warned, if we instead spend most of our time being biased, factional, and partisan\u2014this is extremely dangerous. If we are partisan and factional, we won't see the faults on our own side, or the qualities on the other. We won't be able to recognize what is good and what is bad. OTD said: \"For that reason, it is a situation where we absolutely must be careful. So this is why I asked His Holiness Thaye Dorje for a meeting this year.\" Furthermore, OTD emphasized that whether reconciliation goes well or not does not depend upon only the two claimants, OTD and TTD. It depends on all the followers and the whole community of the Karma Kamtsang.\n\nIn addition, OTD implored everyone to take as expansive a view as possible, to consider the long-term survival of the Karma Kagyu lineage. He said that those with a very short-term view may think that it was pointless for him to meet with TTD. Likewise, some people might think that OTD, by meeting with TTD, ended up losing\u2014that he was defeated. But he said that victory and defeat is a very short-term worldly way of speaking, and that the long-term danger is that the lineage of the Karma Kagyu will disappear without a trace.

Adarsha, for example, makes the Kangyur, Tengyur, and Tibetan masterpieces available in digital format and has been catalogued under the guidance of the Gyalwang Karmapa himself.\n\n== Nurturing Tibetan Culture, Unity, Language and Literacy ==\nFor many years Gyalwang Karmapa has emphasized the importance of preserving Tibetan culture, unity, language, and literacy; underlining the importance of sustaining written and spoken Tibetan language, because it is the very root of the Dharma in Tibet and its culture. Tibetan language is the lifeline that links Tibetans to their culture, arts, and spirituality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kagyuoffice.org/the-gyalwang-karmapa-rings-an-alarm-we-must-preserve-tibetan-language-and-culture/|title=The Gyalwang Karmapa Rings an Alarm: We Must Preserve Tibetan Language and Culture {{!}} Karmapa \u2013 The Official Website of the 17th Karmapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kagyuoffice.org/the-importance-of-harmony-among-tibetans/|title=The Importance of Harmony among Tibetans {{!}} Karmapa \u2013 The Official Website of the 17th Karmapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kagyuoffice.org/a-wide-ranging-interview-with-the-gyalwang-karmapa/|title=A Wide-Ranging Interview with the Gyalwang Karmapa {{!}} Karmapa \u2013 The Official Website of the 17th Karmapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref> Tibetan culture, he states, is the mind and life force of the Tibetan people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kagyuoffice.org/language-as-the-link-unity-as-the-future-the-gyalwang-karmapa-speaks-at-the-56th-anniversary-of-the-upper-tcv/|title=Language as the Link, Unity as the Future: The Gyalwang Karmapa Speaks at the 56th Anniversary of the Upper TCV {{!}} Karmapa \u2013 The Official Website of the 17th Karmapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n\nStressing the importance of Tibetan harmony and unity, Gyalwang Karmapa has implored all Tibetans to exercise religious tolerance, stating that all Buddhist traditions in Tibet come from one source, the Buddha, so the differences between them are not great. He has warned that it is a huge mistake to inflate small distinctions into a basis for attachment and hatred, asserting one\u2019s own tradition to be better than another\u2019s. He has said that the reason for any future decline of the Buddha\u2019s Dharma would not come from outside, but from within, from disputes between the holders of his teachings. Therefore, Gyalwang Karmapa has reiterated time and time again that the differences between lineages and factions are minor in terms of view, meditation, and conduct, and has urged everyone to keep a broader non-partisan perspective in mind.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kagyuoffice.org/tibetan-unity-and-language-are-crucial/|title=Tibetan Unity and Language Are Crucial {{!}} Karmapa \u2013 The Official Website of the 17th Karmapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n\n=== 108 Translations ===\n108 Translations was initiated in 2015 by H.H. Karmapa Orgyen Trinley Dorje. Born of a concept developed during a translators\u2019 workshop held at [http://latse.org Latse] and presided over by Gyalwang Karmapa, the aim of the 108 Translations project is to produce a needed body of reading material that can promote the reinvigoration of Tibetan language. Rather than focussing on translating a few famous works that match the interests of a small group of well-educated readers (which has been the case for translations into Tibetan up to the present), 108 Translations aims to provide a plethora of good and easily accessible reading materials for ''average'' Tibetan readers.\n\nIn his [https://dharmaebooks.org/108-translations/ Statement of Purpose], Gyalwang Karmapa expressed that we are currently inhabiting a time where there is great concern that the Tibetan language will go extinct. He has said that we have come to the point where we need to take responsibility for the survival of the Tibetan language, and we are in a situation where there is very little reading material that matches the interests of the ordinary Tibetan reader.\n\nThe main criteria for the 108 Translations is that they don't lose the meaning and feeling (or \"flavour\") of the original, the translations must be easy to understand and pronounce in Tibetan, and the selected works need to meet the interests of the readership. For example, translations of famous literary works that have a low readership are examples of unsuccessful translations. 108 Translations must not only consider how well known the works are, they must also examine how they have sold, how many other languages they have been translated into, and so forth. Works with low sales are not selected, even if they are renowned. Over time, the hope is that future translations will grow ever closer to the interests of the readership.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dharmaebooks.org/108-translations/|title=A Statement of Purpose|last=|first=|date=|website=dharmaebooks.org|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n\n108 Translations aims to nurture literacy in the Tibetan language, while giving Tibetan readers greater access to world literature. It is a project of Latse and is managed by the 108 Translations Management Team, whose combined skills and experience ensure the highest quality of translation. This project is also generously supported by [https://dharma-treasure.org Dharma Treasure] and the ebooks will be published on [https://dharmaebooks.org/ dharmaebooks.org] as well [http://latse.org/program/108-translations latse.org/program/108-translations].\n\n== Supporting the Female Buddhist Community ==\nThe Karmapa has, for many years, taken a deep interest in the welfare of the female Buddhist community, as well as being a voice that regularly encourages equal rights and opportunities for women practitioners. He has, in particular, taken the responsibility to restore full ordination for Tibetan nuns.\n\nEach year the Karmapa also hosts the [https://www.facebook.com/AryaKshema/ Arya Kshema] dharma winter gathering where nuns receive special teachings, instructions and gather to debate Buddhist philosophy so as to further increase their opportunities for a traditional education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kagyuoffice.org/portfolio-item/nuns-ordination/|title=The Female Buddhist Community {{!}} Karmapa \u2013 The Official Website of the 17th Karmapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-30}}</ref>\n\n=== 2013: Preliminary Discussions on Restoring Nuns\u2019 Ordination===\n\nOn September 14, 2013, at the International Buddhist Confederation in New Delhi, Gyalwang Karmapa participated in a discussions with the Full Nun\u2019s Ordination Working Group, joining Co-Chairs Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo, Abbess of Dongyu Gatsal Ling Nunnery in India, and Ven.

Karmapas), did not recognize Ogyen Trinley Dorje and instead proclaimed [[Trinley Thaye Dorje]] ({{bo|w=Mtha'-yas Rdo-rje}}), whom he purportedly identified a few years earlier than the recognition of Orgyen Thrinley Dorje in a dream as the true Karmapa.

OTD expressed how the Karma Kamtsang forefathers and disciples maintained and propagated the teachings through study, teaching, and practice; thus, ripened generations of disciples through their wisdom, love, and power. OTD related that this activity of ''ripening'' disciples is the essential heart of the Kagyu history, the majesty and the true weight of the Kagyu teachings. He said that we need to continue to uphold the Lineage by preserving these fine deeds and activities. However, OTD warned, if we instead spend most of our time being biased, factional, and partisan\u2014this is extremely dangerous. If we are partisan and factional, we won't see the faults on our own side, or the qualities on the other. We won't be able to recognize what is good and what is bad. OTD said: \"For that reason, it is a situation where we absolutely must be careful. So this is why I asked His Holiness Thaye Dorje for a meeting this year.\" Furthermore, OTD emphasized that whether reconciliation goes well or not does not depend upon only the two claimants, OTD and TTD. It depends on all the followers and the whole community of the Karma Kamtsang.\n\nIn addition, OTD implored everyone to take as expansive a view as possible, to consider the long-term survival of the Karma Kagyu lineage. He said that those with a very short-term view may think that it was pointless for him to meet with TTD. Likewise, some people might think that OTD, by meeting with TTD, ended up losing\u2014that he was defeated. But he said that victory and defeat is a very short-term worldly way of speaking, and that the long-term danger is that the lineage of the Karma Kagyu will disappear without a trace.

Adarsha, for example, makes the Kangyur, Tengyur, and Tibetan masterpieces available in digital format and has been catalogued under the guidance of the Gyalwang Karmapa himself.\n\n== Nurturing Tibetan Culture, Unity, Language and Literacy ==\nFor many years Gyalwang Karmapa has emphasized the importance of preserving Tibetan culture, unity, language, and literacy; underlining the importance of sustaining written and spoken Tibetan language, because it is the very root of the Dharma in Tibet and its culture. Tibetan language is the lifeline that links Tibetans to their culture, arts, and spirituality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kagyuoffice.org/the-gyalwang-karmapa-rings-an-alarm-we-must-preserve-tibetan-language-and-culture/|title=The Gyalwang Karmapa Rings an Alarm: We Must Preserve Tibetan Language and Culture {{!}} Karmapa \u2013 The Official Website of the 17th Karmapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kagyuoffice.org/the-importance-of-harmony-among-tibetans/|title=The Importance of Harmony among Tibetans {{!}} Karmapa \u2013 The Official Website of the 17th Karmapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kagyuoffice.org/a-wide-ranging-interview-with-the-gyalwang-karmapa/|title=A Wide-Ranging Interview with the Gyalwang Karmapa {{!}} Karmapa \u2013 The Official Website of the 17th Karmapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref> Tibetan culture, he states, is the mind and life force of the Tibetan people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kagyuoffice.org/language-as-the-link-unity-as-the-future-the-gyalwang-karmapa-speaks-at-the-56th-anniversary-of-the-upper-tcv/|title=Language as the Link, Unity as the Future: The Gyalwang Karmapa Speaks at the 56th Anniversary of the Upper TCV {{!}} Karmapa \u2013 The Official Website of the 17th Karmapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n\nStressing the importance of Tibetan harmony and unity, Gyalwang Karmapa has implored all Tibetans to exercise religious tolerance, stating that all Buddhist traditions in Tibet come from one source, the Buddha, so the differences between them are not great. He has warned that it is a huge mistake to inflate small distinctions into a basis for attachment and hatred, asserting one\u2019s own tradition to be better than another\u2019s. He has said that the reason for any future decline of the Buddha\u2019s Dharma would not come from outside, but from within, from disputes between the holders of his teachings. Therefore, Gyalwang Karmapa has reiterated time and time again that the differences between lineages and factions are minor in terms of view, meditation, and conduct, and has urged everyone to keep a broader non-partisan perspective in mind.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kagyuoffice.org/tibetan-unity-and-language-are-crucial/|title=Tibetan Unity and Language Are Crucial {{!}} Karmapa \u2013 The Official Website of the 17th Karmapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n\n=== 108 Translations ===\n108 Translations was initiated in 2015 by H.H. Karmapa Orgyen Trinley Dorje. Born of a concept developed during a translators\u2019 workshop held at [http://latse.org Latse] and presided over by Gyalwang Karmapa, the aim of the 108 Translations project is to produce a needed body of reading material that can promote the reinvigoration of Tibetan language. Rather than focussing on translating a few famous works that match the interests of a small group of well-educated readers (which has been the case for translations into Tibetan up to the present), 108 Translations aims to provide a plethora of good and easily accessible reading materials for ''average'' Tibetan readers.\n\nIn his [https://dharmaebooks.org/108-translations/ Statement of Purpose], Gyalwang Karmapa expressed that we are currently inhabiting a time where there is great concern that the Tibetan language will go extinct. He has said that we have come to the point where we need to take responsibility for the survival of the Tibetan language, and we are in a situation where there is very little reading material that matches the interests of the ordinary Tibetan reader.\n\nThe main criteria for the 108 Translations is that they don't lose the meaning and feeling (or \"flavour\") of the original, the translations must be easy to understand and pronounce in Tibetan, and the selected works need to meet the interests of the readership. For example, translations of famous literary works that have a low readership are examples of unsuccessful translations. 108 Translations must not only consider how well known the works are, they must also examine how they have sold, how many other languages they have been translated into, and so forth. Works with low sales are not selected, even if they are renowned. Over time, the hope is that future translations will grow ever closer to the interests of the readership.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dharmaebooks.org/108-translations/|title=A Statement of Purpose|last=|first=|date=|website=dharmaebooks.org|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n\n108 Translations aims to nurture literacy in the Tibetan language, while giving Tibetan readers greater access to world literature. It is a project of Latse and is managed by the 108 Translations Management Team, whose combined skills and experience ensure the highest quality of translation. This project is also generously supported by [https://dharma-treasure.org Dharma Treasure] and the ebooks will be published on [https://dharmaebooks.org/ dharmaebooks.org] as well [http://latse.org/program/108-translations latse.org/program/108-translations].\n\n== Supporting the Female Buddhist Community ==\nThe Karmapa has, for many years, taken a deep interest in the welfare of the female Buddhist community, as well as being a voice that regularly encourages equal rights and opportunities for women practitioners. He has, in particular, taken the responsibility to restore full ordination for Tibetan nuns.\n\nEach year the Karmapa also hosts the [https://www.facebook.com/AryaKshema/ Arya Kshema] dharma winter gathering where nuns receive special teachings, instructions and gather to debate Buddhist philosophy so as to further increase their opportunities for a traditional education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kagyuoffice.org/portfolio-item/nuns-ordination/|title=The Female Buddhist Community {{!}} Karmapa \u2013 The Official Website of the 17th Karmapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-30}}</ref>\n\n=== 2013: Preliminary Discussions on Restoring Nuns\u2019 Ordination===\n\nOn September 14, 2013, at the International Buddhist Confederation in New Delhi, Gyalwang Karmapa participated in a discussions with the Full Nun\u2019s Ordination Working Group, joining Co-Chairs Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo, Abbess of Dongyu Gatsal Ling Nunnery in India, and Ven.

Karmapas), did not recognize Ogyen Trinley Dorje and instead proclaimed [[Trinley Thaye Dorje]] ({{bo|w=Mtha'-yas Rdo-rje}}), whom he purportedly identified a few years earlier than the recognition of Orgyen Thrinley Dorje in a dream as the true Karmapa.

The Abagusii are also found in other regions of geographical Western Kenya. The Abagusii speak [[Gusii language|Ekegusii language]] which is classified together with the [[Great Lakes Bantu languages]].  Mogusii is culturally identified as their founder and patriarch. The Abagusii are however, unrelated to the [[Kisi people]] of Malawi and the [[Kissi people]] of West Africa, other than the three very distinct communities having similar sounding tribal names.\n\n[[Kisii, Kenya|Kisii town]] - known as [[Kisii, Kenya|Bosongo]] or Getembe<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ekegusiiencyclopedia.com/towns-urban-centres|title=Urban centres in Gusii|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> by the locals - is located in [[Nyanza Province]] to the southwest of Kenya and is home to the Abagusii people. However, the term Kisii refers to the town and not to the people. The name Bosongo is believed to have originated from Abasongo (to mean the Whites or the place where white people settle(d)) who lived in the town during the colonial times.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Authoritative Ekegusii-English Dictionary|last=Bosire|first=Kennedy|publisher=Ekegusii Encyclopedia Project|year=2013|isbn=|location=Nairobi|pages=}}</ref>\nAccording to the 1979 census, Kisii District had a population of 588,000. The AbaGusii increased to 2.2 million in the latest Kenya Census 2009.\n\n==Etymology of the Word Kisii==\nThe term Kisii is a Swahili name that is used by Swahili speakers to refer to the Abagusii people. The term was also popularly used during the colonial period by the British administration in reference to Abagusii as it was much easier to pronounce.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The term Kisii however has no meaning in Ekegusii language as it is a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] term.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> In the Swahili language the singular form of the word is Mkisii and the plural form is Wakisii which only make sense in the Swahili language and related coastal and Central Bantu languages of Kenya. The Swahili name for the Ekegusii language is Kikisii. The term is now popularly used in Kenya to refer to Abagusii people although that is not what they are called.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Among Abagusii the name Kisii is used to only mean [[Kisii town]] and not to the people. The original and correct name by the people for themselves is Omogusii in singular and  Abagusii in plural and the language spoken by the people is Ekegusii. The term gusii comes from Mogusii who was the founder of the community. However, the speculation that the term Gusii comes from Gwassi is incorrect as the Abagusii never lived near Gwassi hills of the modern [[Homa Bay]] county and Gwassi is a Luo-Abasuba name for one of their sub-groups.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii History |url=https://www.bluegecko.org/kenya/tribes/gusii/history.htm}}</ref> The Abagusii only lived shortly and passed through modern day [[Kisumu]] in the course of their migration and settlement in Nyanza. The terms \"Gwassi\" and \"Gusii\" don't really even sound or look alike as an ordinary ignorant person may assume. The two terms have distinct pronunciations and Etymology. The term \"Gwassi\" originates from the [[Suba language|Olosuba]] language spoken by Luo-Abasuba and is used to refer to one of their sub-groups and Gwassi hills. The term \"Gusii\" on the other hand, originates from the [[Gusii language|Ekegusii]] and specifically from the name \"Mogusii\" who was the founder of the community. The term \"Gusii\" is not used as a reference to any geographical features such as hills in Gusiiland which is commonly referred to as Gusii highlands due to presence of several hills in the region. The terms \"Kisii\" and \"Gusii\" are also not synonyms as most people tend to assume and have distinct etymology and pronunciation just like the terms \"Gwassi\" and \"Gusii\". The Ekegusii language also does not have the \"SS\" but just \"S\" in their alphabet as people tend to ignorantly assume when spelling Gusii words.\n\n==Origins of the Abagusii==\nAccording to the oral literature of Abagusii, they migrated to present day Kenya from areas further North of [[Mt. Elgon]] region of Kenya. This pre-Elgon homeland of Abagusii is referenced as Misiri and is a general area to the North of Mt. Elgon and does not state that Misiri is Egypt.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> This Misiri homeland is realistically the [[Nile Valley]] region adjacent to modern day [[Ethiopia]] due to migration through the [[Rift Valley Province|Rift Valley]] province of Kenya and settlement at the Mt. Elgon region of Kenya largely part of the Rift Valley.They migrated along a great mythical river called Riteru and passed through a desert land, Eroro. The Misiri homeland of Abagusii is unconnected to the so called popular Hamitic hypothesis by [[C.G. Seligman]] on the migration of hamites from North Africa that introduced advanced civilizations to Sub-Saharan Africa. The oral traditions similar to those of Abagusii are also found in the  [[Maragoli tribe (Luhya)|Abamaragoli]], [[Ameru]] and [[Kuria people|Abakuria]] that are most closely related to Abagusii with the Ameru and Abakuria being the closest.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> Similar oral traditions are also found in some [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] tribes some (especially Kipsigis) of who are related to Abagusii and/or migrated together with Abagusii despite being linguistically classified as Nilotic.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref>  As these Bantu speakers migrated from their semi-mythical homeland(Misiri),they first settled at the [[Mt. Elgon]] region of Kenya for several years before migrating to current homelands. From Mt. Elgon, these Bantu speakers split up into different groups with the Abagusii ending up in Nyanza Province near [[Lake Victoria]]. The [[Maragoli tribe (Luhya)|Abamaragoli]] settled in Western Kenya and the [[Ameru]] later migrated to the former upper Eastern province of Kenya where they later formed relationships with neighboring communities such as [[Borana people]] and communities in Central and lower Eastern provinces of Kenya. The other closely related [[Lacustrine Bantu]] speaking groups mostly settled in modern day [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Tanzania|Northwest Tanzania]]. In Kenya the Abagusii, are most closely related with the [[Maragoli tribe (Luhya)|Abamaragoli]], [[Kuria people|Abakuria]] and the [[Ameru]] of the former Upper Eastern Province.\n \nThe immediate neighbours of Abagusii include the [[Luhya people]], [[Luo people|Luo]], [[Kipsigis people|Kipsigis]], [[Nandi people|Nandi]] and [[Maasai people|Maasai]]. A number of clans of these neighbouring communities especially the Kipsigis have Abagusii origins.  During the pre-colonial period the Abagusii and the neighbouring communities engaged in Barter trade some of which led to the formation of modern day [[Kisumu]] city of Nyanza Province.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The Abagusii are naturally very industrious and resilient despite engaging in some minimal cattle rustling activities with their neighbours.  \n\nThe Bantu speaking community with a great many similarities with the Abagusii is the [[Meru people]] (Abameru in ekegusii) from the windward slopes of Mount Kenya, although the [[Kuria people]] (Abatende in ekegusii) share a great deal in common with the Abagusii in language and culture as well, and a history of intermarriage has led to prohibition of marriage alliances for specific clans of the Abagusii with some Kuria clans. Additionally, intermarriages between members of the same clans are prohibited.\n\n=== Abagusii origins and the Nile Valley.===\n\nThe Abagusii together with [[Luhya people]] tribes, [[Kalenjin people]], and some [[Cushitic]] speaking communities are among the earliest settlers of present day Kenya and the general [[Lake Victoria]] Basin which comprises modern day [[Rwanda]], [[Tanzania|Northwest Tanzania]], [[Uganda]] and geographical western Kenya. The actual migrations and settlement of Abagusii in Kenya during the pre-colonial period can be tracked to the Mt. Elgon region of Kenya as well as the [[Rift Valley Province|Rift Valley]]. The Mt. Elgon region of Kenya is in fact the original point of dispersal of Abagusii to other regions of Kenya where they settled during the pre-colonial period as well as their current homeland in Nyanza province of Kenya. The oral literature of Abagusii indicate that prior to settlement at the Mt. Elgon region, they migrated from areas further North of [[Mt. Elgon]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> This pre-Elgon homeland is referenced as Misiri according to the oral literature of Abagusii and does not state that Misiri is Egypt.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> In fact Egypt as a country did not exist in pre-colonial Africa and was created in the 1950s by European conquerors just like other present African countries and the naming of the modern country of [[Egypt]] was done by Europeans. Therefore the Abagusii like other Africans did not know Egypt as the name did not exist in pre-colonial Africa. In that sense, the Misiri homeland of Abagusii is not referring to Egypt which is a country that never existed in pre-colonial Africa. Although Misiri is sometimes automatically assumed to mean the modern Egypt country and the lost tribes of Israel, the Misiri homeland of Abagusii does not refer to [[Egypt]] and lost tribes of Israel. The Misiri homeland of Abagusii does not refer to a specific area to the North of Mt. Elgon, but rather a general area to the North of Mt. Elgon. This Misiri homeland to the North of Mt. Elgon is realistically the [[Nile Valley]] region adjacent to modern [[Ethiopia]] which lie to the North of Mt. Elgon. During migration and settlement in present day Kenya, the Abagusii passed through the [[Rift Valley Province|Rift Valley]] and settled at the Mt. Elgon region which is part of the Rift Valley. This justifies the location of Misiri homeland of Abagusii at the [[Nile Valley]] region adjacent to [[Ethiopia]] which all lie to the North of Mt. Elgon.  Although the [[Nile Valley]] region is generally assumed to be a homeland of the [[Nilotic]] speaking and some [[Cushitic]] speaking communities, it is also a homeland to Abagusii and some [[Lacustrine Bantu]] speaking communities. This is supported by strong cultural similarities between Abagusii (as well as some other [[Lacustrine Bantu]] speaking communities) and some cushitic speaking and Nilotic speaking communities.\n\n==Abagusii People in Pre-colonial Kenya==\nAccording to the oral literature of Abagusii, the original progenitors of Abagusii migrated to their current homeland in Nyanza from areas further North of the [[Mt. Elgon]] region of Kenya. This pre-Mt. Elgon homeland of Abagusii is referenced as Misiri according to their oral literature. This Misiri homeland is realistically the [[Nile Valley]] region adjacent to modern [[Ethiopia]] due to migration through the Rift Valley Province of Kenya. After migrating from Misiri, the Abagusii passed through the present day [[Rift Valley Province|Rift Valley]] province of Kenya and first settled at the Mt. Elgon region of present day Kenya where they stayed for several years before migrating to present day Nyanza province.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> The Mt.Elgon region of Kenya is the original point of dispersal of Abagusii to other regions of Kenya where they settled during the pre-colonial period as well as their current homeland in [[Nyanza Province]] of Kenya. In fact the actual migrations of Abagusii can be tracked to the Mt. Elgon region of Kenya as well as the Rift Valley province of Kenya. At the Mt. Elgon region of Kenya, the Abagusii came into contact with Luhya (with exception of Maragoli) tribes most of whom had migrated from [[Uganda]]  as well as [[Ogiek]] people. The Abagusii migrated together with some [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] groups and Luo as well as most other closely related tribes such as Abamaragoli, Abakuria, Ameru, Abasoga, Abatoro, and Abakiga who are very similar to Abagusii in some aspects.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> The other closely related tribes later migrated to Uganda, Rwanda and Northwest Tanzania. During their stay at Mt. Elgon region, the Abagusii  were mainly herders that kept cattle, goats, sheep, with minimal crop cultivation of finger millet, sorghum and arrow roots among other local crops. The Abagusii also practised some hunting and gathering (a practise that was borrowed from the [[Ogiek]] people of Mt. Elgon) to supplement the food they obtained from their animals and crops. The land at the Mt. Elgon area became unfavorable for their animals and crops thus forcing the Abagusii to migrate in search of good land mainly for pasture and cultivation of crops. At this time, the Abagusii migrated to Nyanza region whereas, the Abamaragoli migrated to Western Kenya and related tribes migrated to Uganda, Rwanda, and Northwest Tanzania. \n\nDuring settlement in Nyanza, the Abagusii first settled close to the shores of lake Victoria at modern day [[Kisumu]] where they practised fishing activity at lake Victoria. At lake Victoria, the Abagusii came into contact with small pockets of Bantu tribes akin to Luhya possibly from Uganda who had already settled at the shores of lake Victoria.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Most these earlier Bantu tribes were later assimilated by the Luo people who later settled in much of the shores of lake Victoria after Abagusii had migrated out of Kisumu. A good example of such Bantu tribes are the [[Suba language|Luo-Abasuba]] (not to be confused with Suba-Simbete and Suba/Suna-girango who are splinter groups from Abagusii) whose [[Suba language|Olosuba language]] is very different from [[Gusii language|Ekegusii]], [[Kuria language|Egikuria]], and [[Dholuo language]] as well as other languages spoken in Nyanza. The [[Suba language|Olosuba language]] is very similar to the [[Ganda language|Luganda language]] and some Luhya languages such as Lusamia and Lunyala. A majority of these earlier Bantu tribes at the shores of lake Victoria linguistically became extinct due language shift and assimilation mainly by the Luo people as well as Abagusii. The Luo-Abasuba are the only ones  left with their own language Olosuba still existent but spoken by few people as most of them speak Dholuo and most of them were completely assimilated by the Luo people. However, the Abagusii did not stay at this area for long and had to migrate out as the land was unfavorable for their animals and cultivation and there was frequent flooding in the area.  The abagusii then migrated to present day [[Kericho]] county where they also stayed for several years before migrating to their current homeland in Gusii highlands of Nyanza. At Kericho, the Abagusii built fortified walls with thick thorn fences and dug deep trenches around their homesteads as a defense against cattle theft and raids by the Maasai and Nandi who have always been their immediate neighbors.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref>\n\nThe Abagusii and Siria-maasai indeed lived side by side for several years in Kericho before Abagusii migrated to Gusii highlands.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> A number of clans from the Nandi and Tugen as well as other Kalenjin tribes later migrated to Kericho and this led to turmoil between them and Abagusii as well as the Siria-maasai.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> They first drove the Maasai out of Kericho before doing the same to the Abagusii who stayed at what came to be known as Kabianga. Their attempts to drive the Abagusii out of Kericho were unsuccessful as the Abagusii were more armed and had stronger warriors than the Maasai who raided them at night for that reason.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> Some of the Abagusii families/clans remained in Kericho merged with the Nandi, Tugen and other Nilotic Kalenjin clans  as well as Ogiek forming the modern day [[Kipsigis people|Kipsigis]] tribe. However, A majority of the Abagusii had to migrate out of Kericho as the area was deeply forested and unfavorable for crop cultivation and pasture for the animals.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> The Abagusii named the region where they stayed in Kericho as \"Kabianga\" which means \"to refuse\" to imply that crops and pasture for their livestock refused to grow. In fact most Abagusii cattle died and crops failed which caused famine and death of members of the community and this forced them to migrate to modern day Gusii highlands.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> At this point the Abagusii and Abakuria split into two distinct tribes with the Abakuria migrating to Migori and eventually to Northwest Tanzania where most of them reside today.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> The Abakuria  group that settled in Northwest Tanzania particularly the Mara and lake Victoria regions of Tanzania formed other tribes that populated much of Mara and lake Victoria region of Tanzania. A good example of such other closely related tribes include; Zanaki, Ngurimi, Ikoma and Haya among other related tribes in Northwest Tanzania. The other group originally part of the Abakuria group later migrated to modern Rwanda and Southern Uganda in the case of Abakiga and Abatoro who are linguistically and culturally similar to Abagusii. Indeed the oral traditions of Abakiga indicate migration from Northern Rwanda to Southern Uganda. From Kericho, the Abagusii migrated to their current homeland of Gusii highlands in Nyanza which was also originally forested just like Kericho. The Abagusii gradually cleared the forests in Gusii highlands for settlement and herding as well as crop cultivation. The forest cover on Gusii highlands has since then continued to decline as the Abagusii population became more and more dense as it is today. Some of the forests were cleared for tea plantations just like neighboring Kericho and Bomet counties of today. The Abagusii were originally organized into family units analogous to clans. The major Abagusii clans included, Abagetutu, Ababasi, Abanyaribari, Abanchari, Abagirango and others. However, during the 19 century with the introduction of maize, tea and coffee as well as other crops, the Abagusii now largely practise crop cultivation alongside keeping animals despite originally being predominantly pastoralists.\n\n==The Abagusii People today.==\nThe Abagusii are regarded as one of the most economically active communities in Kenya, with rolling tea estates, coffee, and banana groves. However, Kisii district has a very high population density. It is one of the most densely populated areas in Kenya (after the two cities of Nairobi and Mombasa), and the most densely populated rural area. It also has one of the highest fertility and population growth rates in Kenya (as evidenced by successive census and demographic surveys). In fact the fertility rate of Kisii ranks among the highest in the world, (see ''Kenyan Conundrum: A Regional Analysis of Population Growth and Primary Education (Paperback) by '''Juha I. Uitto [Author]''')''. These factors have ensured the Abagusii to be among the most geographically widespread communities in East Africa. A disproportionately large number of Abagusii have gone abroad in search of education.The Abagusii are some of the most heavily represented Kenyans in foreign (usually Indian and American) universities and a few in the United Kingdom.\nTheir lands are currently overpopulated despite their rolling fertile hills, spurring immigration to other cities in Kenya and a substantial representation in the [[United States]], especially in major hub cities like [[Houston]], [[Atlanta]], [[Jersey City]], [[Dallas]], [[Cleveland]] and [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul]]. The hard cash that flows from the diaspora has spawned significant economic prosperity in a locale lacking in politically motivated 'hand-me downs'.\n\nThe Abagusii people have as a result moved out of their two counties and can be found virtually in any part of Kenya and beyond. In [[Nairobi]], Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kisumu and many other towns in Kenya, they run most businesses. For example, the \"matatu\" business in Nairobi estates like Utawala, kawangware, Dandora, Embakasi, Kitengela, Matasia, etc. They have bought land and are residents in most of these Nairobi estates like Utawala, Ruai, Joska, Kamulu, Kitengela, Rongai, Ngong, etc. They are generally, by nature, independent and thorough in their pursuits whether in education, professional practices, or even religious belief(Islam,  Christianity or Traditional African religions); making them more visible that their absolute numbers.The Abagusii people are very diverse in terms of culture, religion and appearance(ranging from caucasoid like to negroid like features). Abagusii people are not related to the Kissi people of West Africa or to the Kisi people of Malawi\n\n==Abagusii Relationship with Nilotic and Cushitic speakers.==\n\nThe division of indigenous African peoples into; Nilotic, Bantu, Niger-Congo, Cushitic, Sudanic, West Sudanic (West Africans), Nilo-saharan, Afro-asiatic, Chadic and Khoisan linguistic groups was a purely European concept that never existed in pre-colonial Africa.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo}}</ref> These linguistic classifications began in 1900s with [[ Joseph Greenberg]] and other European scholars and conquerors pioneering the idea of dividing African into different linguistic groups.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo}}</ref> The creation of all these linguistic groups made colonization of Africa easier as Africa was divided into regions based on the created linguistic groups. For instance, Southern African was defined as [[Khoisan]] area, Eastern Africa as a [[Cushitic]] area, Central Africa (and sometimes West Africa) as a [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] area, Sahelian region and Nile valley as a Nilo-saharan area and West Africa as a West Sudanic area.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo}}</ref> After creation of all these linguistic groups, collective histories for each group were created that assumed common origin of each linguistic group. For example, the Nilotic speaking communities were assumed to be from [[South Sudan]], the Cushitic speaking communities were assumed to be from [[Ethiopia]] and the Bantu speaking communities were assumed to be from the border of [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo}}</ref> These linguistic groups were also associated with specific economic activities regardless of what they practised. For instance, the Cushitic and Nilotic speaking communities were assumed to be all herders, and the Bantu speaking communities were assumed to be all farmers. Each of these linguistic group was assumed to be all genetically homogeneous and DNA haplogroups such as E1b1a, E1b1b, BM60, A3 and A1b1 were created for each group.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wood |first1=E |title=Contrasting patterns of Y chromosome and mtDNA variation in Africa: evidence for sex-biased demographic processes.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=de Filippo |first1=C |title=Y-Chromosomal Variation in Sub-Saharan Africa: Insights Into the History of Niger-Congo Groups.

All these groups were polarized against each other depending on region and ethnic groups hence some of the conflicts and bitter relations witnessed today between different linguistic groups. Creation of these linguistic groups is one of the major contributing factor to the blanket stereotypes created against each of these linguistic groups in the modern African societies. In the context of [[Kenya]], the Abagusii relationship with the neighboring Nilotic speaking communities such as [[Maasai people]], [[Nandi people]], [[Kipsigis people]] and [[Luo people]] has always been painted as negative on social media and in public opinions of some people especially scholars and researchers. The Nilotic speaking communities have been stereotyped as hostile and warlike compared to the Abagusii people and the Bantu speaking African tribes in general. Despite these public opinions, the Abagusii indeed have had good relationships with the neighboring [[Nilotic]] speaking communities who have always been their neighbors since many years prior to colonization of Africa. Prior to colonization, the Abagusii engaged in barter trade with these communities especially the [[Luo people]] and at times worked together during cattle raids to defeat the raiders.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands.}}</ref> For instance, the Abagusii together with Luo and Maasai worked together to defeat the [[Kipsigis people|Kipsigis]] cattle raiders. \n\nThe Abagusii and Maasai also lived side by side around Kericho for many years before the Abagusii migration to their current homeland of Gusii highlands.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands.}}</ref> The co-existence between the Abagusii and the neighboring [[Nilotic]] communities was largely peaceful despite these communities and Abagusii occasionally engaging in cattle rustling activities which were sometimes violent. The cattle rustling and raiding was mainly common among the [[Maasai people]] and to a lesser extent the [[Kalenjin people]] who believed that cattle were given to them by God to control and take care of them. The Abagusii have more in common with the Nilotic speaking communities in terms of culture as well as migration and settlement patterns compared to the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] speaking communities. For instance, the Abagusii were originally predominantly herders in pre-colonial Africa and farmers to a lesser extent which is very similar to the Nilotic communities. The migration routes and settlement patterns of Abagusii in present day Kenya are very similar to those of the [[Kalenjin people]], [[Ateker people]] including [[Maasai people]] and [[Luo people]]. For instance, the original point of dispersal to other regions of Kenya was [[Mt. Elgon]] for the Abagusii, [[Kalenjin people]], [[Luo people]] and [[Ateker people]]. A number of clans of the neighboring Nilotic communities especially the Kipsigis have Abagusii origins suggesting a very close relationship between Abagusii and neighboring Nilotic speaking communities. In terms of relationship with the cushitic communities, the Abagusii don't live in close proximity with the [[Cushitic]] speaking communities that are mostly found in geographical Eastern and Northern Kenya. However, there is similarity between the Abagusii cultures and cultures of some cushitic communities particularly the East Cushitic communities such as [[Konso people]] and [[Oromo people]]. For instance, a majority of the Cushitic communities are herders which was originally dominant among Abagusii though still practised to a lesser extent. The oral literature of Abagusii indicate migration from Misiri that lie at the North of [[Mt. Elgon]] prior to settlement at the Mt. Elgon region of Kenya.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands.}}</ref> This pre-Elgon homeland of Abagusii is the [[Nile Valley]] region adjacent to modern [[Ethiopia]] thus the many similarities between Abagusii and the Nilotic and Cushitic speaking communities. The general conclusion is that the Abagusii have more in common with the Cushitic and Nilotic communities than with the Bantu speaking communities in several aspects. These similarities suggest that Abagusii share origins with some Cushitic and Nilotic communities. On the basis of the Abagusii history and migration routes, they could be more genetically related to some Nilotic and Cushitic speaking communities than they are related to the Bantu speaking communities. Indeed a majority of Abagusii share physical appearance with the some Cushitic and Nilotic speaking communities as well as with some Bantu speaking communities. For instance, an outsider will confuse a majority of Abagusii with the Cushitic speaking communities, Nilotic speakers and so being confused for the other Bantu speaking communities.\n\n==Abagusii Relationship with East Africa Bantu speakers==\n\nDuring the pre-colonial period, the Abagusii mostly had contact with the luo, Nandi, Kipsigis and maasai who have always been their immediate neighbors as well as other tribes at the [[Lake Victoria]] region of East Africa. The Abagusii Engaged in Barter Trade with some of these communities such as Luhya, Luo, Nandi, Kipsigis and maasai as well as other Lake Victoria communities depending on proximity.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> The Abagusii had very limited contact with the Bantu speaking communities and led very independent and distinct life styles from a majority of the Bantu communities of East Africa and possibly the entire continent of Africa. Indeed even the [[Gusii language|Ekegusii language]] is significantly different from most East African as well as other Bantu languages of Africa in some structural elements.This supports the view that  Abagusii were originally separate from other East African Bantu tribes as well as the Bantu language group as whole, despite being linguistically classified as Bantu since the 1900s. In the context of Kenya, the Abagusii originally never had contact with the Bantu speaking communities in former central, Eastern and coastal provinces of Kenya. This is with the exception of [[Ameru]] that migrated to the former Upper Eastern province from geographical Western Kenya. Even in terms of linguistics, the Abagusii are closest to the Bantu communities at the Lake Victoria region as compared to communities in central, Eastern and Coastal provinces of Kenya as well as a large chunk of Tanzania which also borders lake Victoria. However, in the post-colonial period with the availability of modern transportation, the Abagusii have been able to contact the Bantu speaking communities in Central, Eastern and coastal provinces of Kenya with who they originally had no contact with. The Abagusii have also been able to learn of other Bantu communities they never knew before such as those far away from the lake region of Tanzania, Uganda and other African countries through modern Education on African linguistic groups.  A majority of the tribes now labelled Bantu barely knew each other during the precolonial period as they were originally very scattered and didn't have the concept of the term Bantu as a linguistic marker denoting hundreds of diverse tribes in Central, Eastern, and Southern Africa.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bleek |first1=Wilhelm |title=\u201cOn the Languages of Western and Southern Africa;\u201d.}}</ref> In the precolonial period the term Abantu (The term Abantu is a Nguni term and has distinct versions in other Bantu languages) out of which the term Bantu was coined, was only used to mean people with no Bantu as a linguistic group in mind.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bleek |first1=Wilhelm |title=\u201cOn the Languages of Western and Southern Africa;\u201d.}}</ref> The tribes now labelled as Bantu never had a sense of unity or belonging together during the precolonial period as they were very scattered and led very distinct and independent life styles having no knowledge of each other.\n\n\n===Etymology of Bantu and Relevance to Abagusii.===\n\nThe term \"Bantu\" originates from the Nguni languages of Southern Africa from the term \"Abantu\" which means people and was coined by [[Wilhelm Bleek]] in 1850s.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bleek |first1=Wilhelm |title=\u201cOn the Languages of Western and Southern Africa;\u201d.}}</ref> The term was originally and initially used in South Africa during the apartheid rule to refer to non-Khoisan South Africans and was later used as a linguistic marker denoting hundreds or thousands of unrelated tribes in Central, Eastern and Southern Africa.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bleek |first1=Wilhelm |title=\u201cOn the Languages of Western and Southern Africa;\u201d.}}</ref> The term \"Bantu\" has no grammatical meaning in the Nguni languages out of which it was coined. The singular form of the word Abantu is Umuntu which lenders the term Bantu meaningless as it makes no grammatical sense. The term Bantu as well as the so called Bantu speakers did not exist in precolonial Africa. Prior to colonization of Africa, the term \"Abantu\" as well as its other distinct versions in other so called Bantu languages was used to simply mean people and nothing more than just that. However, beginning 1900s with classification of indigenous African peoples into; Bantu, Niger-Congo, Nilotes, Nilo-saharan, Sudanic, West Sudanic(West Africans), Cushites, Afro-Asiatic, Hamites,and Khoisan,the term Bantu started being used in reference to tribes that occupy Central, Eastern and Southern Africa.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bleek |first1=Wilhelm |title=\u201cOn the Languages of Western and Southern Africa;\u201d.}}</ref>, <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo Family.}}</ref>These thousands of tribes were assumed to be the same and having a common origin on the basis of using words similar to Abantu in reference to people. The languages spoken by these tribes were also assumed to be the same and having a common origin on the basis of possessing words similar to Abantu.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bleek |first1=Wilhelm |title=\u201cOn the Languages of Western and Southern Africa;\u201d.}}</ref> The assumption that these very diverse and unconnected tribes share a common origin on the basis of the terms similar to Abantu contributed to them being lumped up together into one collective group called Bantu. The assumption that the Bantu languages are the same is not necessarily right given that these languages have very minimal structural similarities and lack mutual intelligibility. The speakers of these languages don't understand each other and were originally unconnected to each other. In precolonial Africa, these tribes barely knew each other and were very scattered with very little to no contact with each other. These tribes also never had a sense of unity or belonging together and led very independent and distinct life styles with no prior knowledge of each other. \n\nAfter creation of the Bantu linguistic group, a collective history was coined that assumed that all these thousands of tribes originated at the border of [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]] and expanded from their to other parts of Africa where they are found.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo Family.}}</ref> The assumption that these very diverse tribes that were originally very scattered and disunited expanded together from the border of Nigeria and Cameroon is rather absurd.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo Family.}}</ref> This raises the question of when these originally unconnected tribes learnt about each other and  decided to expand together from the border of Nigeria and Cameroon where they are absent.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo Family.}}</ref> This leads to conclusion that the so called Bantu expansion never occurred and the expansion was just used to justify land dispossession from the black South Africans during apartheid as well as other Africans during the colonial period. The assumption that thousands of the so called Bantu speaking tribes expanded from the border of Nigeria and Cameroon and are genetically and linguistically homogeneous is rather absurd and inaccurate.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo Family.}}</ref> The Bantu speaking tribes are in fact the most diverse in Africa in terms of genetics, culture, appearance, origins, history and linguistics. The general assumption that belonging to the Bantu linguistic group automatically makes people genetically related is also quite absurd as these thousands of tribes lack a common origin and were randomly labelled Bantu on the basis of the simple term Abantu. Speaking a Bantu language does not necessarily mean that one cannot be related to people from other linguistic groups given that all these groups were also randomly lumped up together. For instance, the Bantu speaking tribes in Southern Africa are genetically more related to [[Khoisan]] than they are related to East African Bantu tribes and other regions. The Bantu speaking tribes in East Africa especially [[Kenya]] are also genetically more related to the [[Nilotic]] and [[Cushitic]] speaking communities than to the Central African Bantu speaking tribes that are also more related to Southern African Bantu speaking communities. Therefore the term Bantu has no genetic meaning other than just being a linguistic marker of several thousands of unrelated tribes. The over 600 Bantu languages are distinct from each other enough to be treated as distinct languages that don't belong to one collective linguistic group. In terms of importance, the term Bantu only has meaning to the Nguni languages out of which it was coined as well as other tribes with the exact spellings of the term \"Abantu\". The term is of no meaning and importance to Abagusii as it is a mere linguistic marker and not a genetic marker of several diverse African tribes.\n\n==Agriculture and biodiversity in Gusiiland.==\n\nIn the past, Gusiiland was a heavily forested area, with old indigenous broadleaf rainforest trees and other flora. It was part of the old Congo Basin forests. The only remnant of this old forest in Kenya is the Kakamega Forest, which is the westernmost tip of the Equatorial rainforest. The two ancient forest areas were linked through Nandi and Kericho, before the Nandi and Kericho areas were cleared for tea farming and settlement. Now most of the tree life in Gusiiland consists of members of 4 tree families, all of them introduced from outside the continent. The most common trees in Gusiiland are the ''Eucalyptus spp.'' family (blue gum/eucalyptus), ''Grevillea robusta'' and Black Wattle (Acacia mearnsii). All these three species are native to Australia. Finally, there is the ''Cupressus spp.'' family (cypress) native to South America. Other plant life forms are cultivated tea, bananas, maize, coffee and napier grass, with very little remaining of indigenous biodiversity.\n\nIt has been theorized that in future Gusiiland will increasingly be 'colonized' by the above few species of plants, as there is little awareness or even desire to re-plant the slow-growing and less economically valuable indigenous plant forms. This is aggravated by land shortage and reduced need for traditional herbal medicine, that has now been surpassed by modern hospitals and medical care.\n\n==Abagusii Economic Activities.==\n\n===Subsistence Agriculture and Herding.===\n\nDuring the pre-colonial period, the Abagusii cultivated finger millet, sorghum, root crops and bananas as well as other local crops.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> By 1920s with introduction of maize to Gusiiland, finger millet and sorghum were largely replaced by maize as a staple and cash crop.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Other crops cultivated by Abagusii today include cassava, potatoes, tomatoes, bananas, beans, onions, tropical fruits and peas as well as several other crops.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> By 1930s, coffee and tea had reached Gusiiland and were being cultivated as major cash crops. <ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> During the pre-colonial period as well as early colonial period, the Ox-drawn plows and iron hoes were used in the cultivation of crops.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Today the same cultivation tools are used alongside modern cultivation tools. During the pre-colonial period, the Abagusii were predominantly herders that kept cattle, goats and sheep as well as kept poultry.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Today, the Abagusii still keep livestock and poultry alongside farming.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The high population density of Abagusii has contributed to utilization of available land for agriculture to satisfy subsistence and commercial needs thus making farming a dominant activity.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> In addition to agriculture, the Abagusii also carry out business activities in major towns and cities in Kenya and abroad.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The Abagusii also participate in white collar jobs in Kenya and abroad.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Industrial Activities===\n\nDuring the pre-colonial period, Abagusii produced iron tools, weapons, decorations, wooden implements, and baskets for diverse uses.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The Abagusii also made pottery products such as pots and imported some from the neighboring Luo community.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The most respected and highly valued activity was smelting of iron ore and manufacture of iron tools.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The blacksmiths were highly respected, wealthy and influential members of Abagusii society, but did not form a special caste as the Abagusii society was not based on caste stratifications.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Smithing activities were mainly carried out by men.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Trade===\nThe form of trade carried out on pre-colonial Gusiiland was barter trade and mostly took place within homesteads as well as with neighboring communities especially the Luo people.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The major products exchanged included tools, weapons, crafts, livestock, and agricultural products.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The cattle served as a form of currency among Abagusii for the products exchanged and goats were used as a currency for lower valued products.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The barter trade between Abagusii and Luo took place at border markets and at Abagusii farms and was mainly carried out by women.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Today with advent of modern concept of trade, the Abagusii have established shopping centers, shops and markets which have connected them with other regions of Kenya beside the neighboring communities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> These markets are increasing exponentially and the Abagusii are getting more and more connected to the rest of Kenya as opposed to the pre-colonial Kenya where they only had contact with neighboring communities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Division of Labor.===\nIn the traditional Abagusii society, labor was divided between males and females. The women specific duties included cooking, crop cultivation and processing, fetching water and firewood, brewing, and cleaning while the men specific duties included herding, building houses and fences, and clearing cultivation fields, and other duties.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Men were also involved in crop cultivation but with more responsibilities than women. Herding was primarily carried out by boys and unmarried men in the grazing fields and girls and unmarried young women helped with crop cultivation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Today the division of labor between males and females has significantly changed and is now disadvantageous to women as they perform most of the duties traditionally meant for men. <ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> There is no longer equal distribution of labor between men and women as it was traditionally.\n\n==Language==\nThey speak the [[Gusii language|Ekegusii]] (also called omonwa Bwekegusii). However, some older texts refer to this community as ''Kosova''. This language and some other [[Great Lakes Bantu languages]] have some similarities in structure but not mutually intelligible. They are markedly similar to the Bakiga of south western Uganda in culture, industry and choice of terrain. The LuTooro language of Western Uganda shares a great many words with Ekegusii. For instance, \"''omoiseke''\" is the Ekegusii for 'girl' and the word in LuTooro is just the same save for a slight difference in inflection.\n\n==Culture==\nThe Abagusii play a large bass [[lyre]] called ''[[obokano]]''. They are also known by their world-famous soapstone sculptures \"chigware\" mostly concentrated in the southern parts of Kisii County around Tabaka town. Circumcision of boys at around age of 10 as a rite of passage without anesthesia is common among the Abagusii. The girls also underwent clitoridectomy as a form of circumcision at an earlier age than boys.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> This ritual takes place annually in the months of November and December followed by a period of seclusion during which the boys are led in different activities by older boys and girls are led by older girls, and is a great time of celebration indeed for families and communities at large. Family, friends and neighbors are invited days in advance by candidates to join the family. During this period of seclusion only older circumcised boys and girls are allowed to visit the secluded initiates and any other visitor could cause a taboo. Its during this period that initiates were taught their roles as young men in the community and the do's and the don'ts of a circumcised man. The initiated boys and girls were also taught the rules of same (\"Chinsoni\") and respect (\"Ogosika\").<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref>\n\nSome of the notable musicians from the Abagusii community include Nyashinski, Rajiv Okemwa Raj, Ringtone, Mwalimu Arisi O'sababu, Christopher Monyoncho, Sungusia, Riakimai '91 Jazz, Embarambamba, Bonyakoni Kirwanda junior band, Mr Ong'eng'o, Grandmaster Masese, Deepac Braxx (The Heavyweight Mc), Jiggy, Mr. Bloom, Virusi, Babu Gee, Brax Rnb, Sabby Okengo, Machoge One Jazz,among others.\n\n==Abagusii Religion, faith and beliefs==\n\nPrior to Introduction of Christianity and Islam to Africa, the Abagusii people believed in a supreme God called Engoro. This same God is also popularly called Nyasae among Abagusii. The Abagusii believe that Engoro also known as Nyasae created the Universe and was the source of all life. Death and disease was considered unnatural events brought on by witchcraft. The Abagusii also believed in medicine men and the spirits of their ancestors called \"Ebirecha\". The displeasure of ancestor spirits was evidenced by disease, death of people and livestock as well as destruction of crops.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> However, today a majority of Abagusii people practise Christianity with the Adventist protestant Christianity being the most dominant and a few practising Catholicism. A minority of Abagusii still adhere to their traditional religion and some being dual religion observing Christianity alongside their traditional religion. The practise of Islam among Abagusii is very little to absent.\n\n==Marriage==\n\nAmong the Abagusii community, traditional marriage was arranged by the parents, using intermediaries called \"chisigani\", who also acted as referees for the bride and groom to be. The parents negotiated the dowry and organised a traditional wedding. The traditional wedding ceremony involved a mentor called \"omoimari\" who could provide continuing support to the newly married couple. Currently, civil and Christian marriages are recognized among the Abagusii. It is essential to note that traditions within the Abagusii community prohibit marriages between members of the same clan. Marriage was officially established through payment of dowry in the form of cattle to the wife's family.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Payment of dowry allowed man and woman to be considered husband and wife and gave room for a traditional marriage ceremony.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Divorce is traditionally not allowed among Abagusii as marriage is considered a permanent union that is only disrupted by death.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Living Conditions===\n\nTraditionally, a typical Gusii family is polygamous with one man having more than one wife that live in the same homestead. The polygamous family was divided into two constituents namely the homestead called \"Omochie\" and the cattle camps called \"Ebisarate\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The married man and his wives and their unmarried daughters and uncircumcised boys lived in the \"Omochie\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The \"Ebisarate\" were situated in the grazing fields and were protected by male warriors against theft by cattle rustlers and raiders.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The traditional Gusii compound also had elevated granaries for storage of crop harvests such as millet and other crops.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The Abagusii traditionally built fortified walls around their homesteads and villages for protection against cattle rustling wars,and raids by neighboring communities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The Abagusii also dug trenches around their homesteads for the purposes of protection against raids. The fortified walls built around homesteads and villages as well as trenches also served as a protection against dangerous wild animals. However, the cattle camps were abolished in 1913 by the British forcing Abagusii to live in dispersed homesteads as compared to traditional homestead set up.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> A typical traditional Gusii house is mad-walled with a conical grass thatched roofs that is mainly round and sometimes rectangular in shape.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The modern houses are still mad-wall with round and rectangular shapes but the roofs have corrugated iron sheets and grass thatched.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The Abagusii also built stone-walled houses today.\n\n==Food and Nutrition==\n\nTheir staple meal is Obokima (dish of millet flour, or Sorghum flour cooked with water to a hardened dough-like consistency). It is often served with ''rinagu, chinsaga, rikuneni, enderema,emboga,omotere, risosa, egesare'' among other locally available green leaves consumed as vegetables. It can also be served with any other stew. The word for ''\"having a meal\" [ragera]'' usually connotes a meal involving ''[obokima]'' at the centre. However, by 1920s maize had been introduced to Gusiiland and had overtaken finger millet and sorghum as staple crops and cash crops which ensured that maize became the new dominant staple crop.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> As a result, maize flour is now largely used to prepare Obokima although millet and sorghum flour is still used to a lesser extent. The Obokima was also served with milk particularly sour milk from livestock.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Although frequently associated with \"ritoke\" (plural \"amatoke\", cooked and flavoured bananas), this is usually supplemental and not considered to be a proper meal, but a popular snack.\n\n==Notable Abagusii People==\n* [[David Kenani Maraga]], President of the [[Supreme Court of Kenya]].\n* [[Zachary Onyonka]], Former Education and Foreign Affairs Minister\n* [[Sam Ongeri]], Former Minister of Foreign Affairs and current Senator of Kisii County\n* [[Fred Matiang'i]],  Cabinet Secretary for the Ministry of Interior  and Coordination of National Security\n* [[Simeon Nyachae]], Former Cabinet Minister\n* [[James Ongwae]], First Governor of Kisii County\n* [[Caspal Maina Momanyi]],Assistant Education Permanent Secretary\n* [[Janet Ong'era]], Kisii County Woman Member of [[National Assembly (Kenya)|The National Assembl]]<nowiki/>y\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n1.

The Abagusii are also found in other regions of geographical Western Kenya. The Abagusii speak [[Gusii language|Ekegusii language]] which is classified together with the [[Great Lakes Bantu languages]].  Mogusii is culturally identified as their founder and patriarch. The Abagusii are however, unrelated to the [[Kisi people]] of Malawi and the [[Kissi people]] of West Africa, other than the three very distinct communities having similar sounding tribal names.\n\n[[Kisii, Kenya|Kisii town]] - known as [[Kisii, Kenya|Bosongo]] or Getembe<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ekegusiiencyclopedia.com/towns-urban-centres|title=Urban centres in Gusii|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> by the locals - is located in [[Nyanza Province]] to the southwest of Kenya and is home to the Abagusii people. However, the term Kisii refers to the town and not to the people. The name Bosongo is believed to have originated from Abasongo (to mean the Whites or the place where white people settle(d)) who lived in the town during the colonial times.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Authoritative Ekegusii-English Dictionary|last=Bosire|first=Kennedy|publisher=Ekegusii Encyclopedia Project|year=2013|isbn=|location=Nairobi|pages=}}</ref>\nAccording to the 1979 census, Kisii District had a population of 588,000. The AbaGusii increased to 2.2 million in the latest Kenya Census 2009.\n\n==Etymology of the Word Kisii==\nThe term Kisii is a Swahili name that is used by Swahili speakers to refer to the Abagusii people. The term was also popularly used during the colonial period by the British administration in reference to Abagusii as it was much easier to pronounce.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The term Kisii however has no meaning in Ekegusii language as it is a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] term.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> In the Swahili language the singular form of the word is Mkisii and the plural form is Wakisii which only make sense in the Swahili language and related coastal and Central Bantu languages of Kenya. The Swahili name for the Ekegusii language is Kikisii. The term is now popularly used in Kenya to refer to Abagusii people although that is not what they are called.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Among Abagusii the name Kisii is used to only mean [[Kisii town]] and not to the people. The original and correct name by the people for themselves is Omogusii in singular and  Abagusii in plural and the language spoken by the people is Ekegusii. The term gusii comes from Mogusii who was the founder of the community. However, the speculation that the term Gusii comes from Gwassi is incorrect as the Abagusii never lived near Gwassi hills of the modern [[Homa Bay]] county and Gwassi is a Luo-Abasuba name for one of their sub-groups.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii History |url=https://www.bluegecko.org/kenya/tribes/gusii/history.htm}}</ref> The Abagusii only lived shortly and passed through modern day [[Kisumu]] in the course of their migration and settlement in Nyanza. The terms \"Gwassi\" and \"Gusii\" don't really even sound or look alike as an ordinary ignorant person may assume. The two terms have distinct pronunciations and Etymology. The term \"Gwassi\" originates from the [[Suba language|Olosuba]] language spoken by Luo-Abasuba and is used to refer to one of their sub-groups and Gwassi hills. The term \"Gusii\" on the other hand, originates from the [[Gusii language|Ekegusii]] and specifically from the name \"Mogusii\" who was the founder of the community. The term \"Gusii\" is not used as a reference to any geographical features such as hills in Gusiiland which is commonly referred to as Gusii highlands due to presence of several hills in the region. The terms \"Kisii\" and \"Gusii\" are also not synonyms as most people tend to assume and have distinct etymology and pronunciation just like the terms \"Gwassi\" and \"Gusii\". The Ekegusii language also does not have the \"SS\" but just \"S\" in their alphabet as people tend to ignorantly assume when spelling Gusii words.\n\n==Origins of the Abagusii==\nAccording to the oral literature of Abagusii, they migrated to present day Kenya from areas further North of [[Mt. Elgon]] region of Kenya. This pre-Elgon homeland of Abagusii is referenced as Misiri and is a general area to the North of Mt. Elgon and does not state that Misiri is Egypt.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> This Misiri homeland is realistically the [[Nile Valley]] region adjacent to modern day [[Ethiopia]] due to migration through the [[Rift Valley Province|Rift Valley]] province of Kenya and settlement at the Mt. Elgon region of Kenya largely part of the Rift Valley.They migrated along a great mythical river called Riteru and passed through a desert land, Eroro. The Misiri homeland of Abagusii is unconnected to the so called popular Hamitic hypothesis by [[C.G. Seligman]] on the migration of hamites from North Africa that introduced advanced civilizations to Sub-Saharan Africa. The oral traditions similar to those of Abagusii are also found in the  [[Maragoli tribe (Luhya)|Abamaragoli]], [[Ameru]] and [[Kuria people|Abakuria]] that are most closely related to Abagusii with the Ameru and Abakuria being the closest.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> Similar oral traditions are also found in some [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] tribes some (especially Kipsigis) of who are related to Abagusii and/or migrated together with Abagusii despite being linguistically classified as Nilotic.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref>  As these Bantu speakers migrated from their semi-mythical homeland(Misiri),they first settled at the [[Mt. Elgon]] region of Kenya for several years before migrating to current homelands. From Mt. Elgon, these Bantu speakers split up into different groups with the Abagusii ending up in Nyanza Province near [[Lake Victoria]]. The [[Maragoli tribe (Luhya)|Abamaragoli]] settled in Western Kenya and the [[Ameru]] later migrated to the former upper Eastern province of Kenya where they later formed relationships with neighboring communities such as [[Borana people]] and communities in Central and lower Eastern provinces of Kenya. The other closely related [[Lacustrine Bantu]] speaking groups mostly settled in modern day [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Tanzania|Northwest Tanzania]]. In Kenya the Abagusii, are most closely related with the [[Maragoli tribe (Luhya)|Abamaragoli]], [[Kuria people|Abakuria]] and the [[Ameru]] of the former Upper Eastern Province.\n \nThe immediate neighbours of Abagusii include the [[Luhya people]], [[Luo people|Luo]], [[Kipsigis people|Kipsigis]], [[Nandi people|Nandi]] and [[Maasai people|Maasai]]. A number of clans of these neighbouring communities especially the Kipsigis have Abagusii origins.  During the pre-colonial period the Abagusii and the neighbouring communities engaged in Barter trade some of which led to the formation of modern day [[Kisumu]] city of Nyanza Province.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The Abagusii are naturally very industrious and resilient despite engaging in some minimal cattle rustling activities with their neighbours.  \n\nThe Bantu speaking community with a great many similarities with the Abagusii is the [[Meru people]] (Abameru in ekegusii) from the windward slopes of Mount Kenya, although the [[Kuria people]] (Abatende in ekegusii) share a great deal in common with the Abagusii in language and culture as well, and a history of intermarriage has led to prohibition of marriage alliances for specific clans of the Abagusii with some Kuria clans. Additionally, intermarriages between members of the same clans are prohibited.\n\n=== Abagusii origins and the Nile Valley.===\n\nThe Abagusii together with [[Luhya people]] tribes, [[Kalenjin people]], and some [[Cushitic]] speaking communities are among the earliest settlers of present day Kenya and the general [[Lake Victoria]] Basin which comprises modern day [[Rwanda]], [[Tanzania|Northwest Tanzania]], [[Uganda]] and geographical western Kenya. The actual migrations and settlement of Abagusii in Kenya during the pre-colonial period can be tracked to the Mt. Elgon region of Kenya as well as the [[Rift Valley Province|Rift Valley]]. The Mt. Elgon region of Kenya is in fact the original point of dispersal of Abagusii to other regions of Kenya where they settled during the pre-colonial period as well as their current homeland in Nyanza province of Kenya. The oral literature of Abagusii indicate that prior to settlement at the Mt. Elgon region, they migrated from areas further North of [[Mt. Elgon]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> This pre-Elgon homeland is referenced as Misiri according to the oral literature of Abagusii and does not state that Misiri is Egypt.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> In fact Egypt as a country did not exist in pre-colonial Africa and was created in the 1950s by European conquerors just like other present African countries and the naming of the modern country of [[Egypt]] was done by Europeans. Therefore the Abagusii like other Africans did not know Egypt as the name did not exist in pre-colonial Africa. In that sense, the Misiri homeland of Abagusii is not referring to Egypt which is a country that never existed in pre-colonial Africa. Although Misiri is sometimes automatically assumed to mean the modern Egypt country and the lost tribes of Israel, the Misiri homeland of Abagusii does not refer to [[Egypt]] and lost tribes of Israel. The Misiri homeland of Abagusii does not refer to a specific area to the North of Mt. Elgon, but rather a general area to the North of Mt. Elgon. This Misiri homeland to the North of Mt. Elgon is realistically the [[Nile Valley]] region adjacent to modern [[Ethiopia]] which lie to the North of Mt. Elgon. During migration and settlement in present day Kenya, the Abagusii passed through the [[Rift Valley Province|Rift Valley]] and settled at the Mt. Elgon region which is part of the Rift Valley. This justifies the location of Misiri homeland of Abagusii at the [[Nile Valley]] region adjacent to [[Ethiopia]] which all lie to the North of Mt. Elgon.  Although the [[Nile Valley]] region is generally assumed to be a homeland of the [[Nilotic]] speaking and some [[Cushitic]] speaking communities, it is also a homeland to Abagusii and some [[Lacustrine Bantu]] speaking communities. This is supported by strong cultural similarities between Abagusii (as well as some other [[Lacustrine Bantu]] speaking communities) and some cushitic speaking and Nilotic speaking communities.\n\n==Abagusii People in Pre-colonial Kenya==\nAccording to the oral literature of Abagusii, the original progenitors of Abagusii migrated to their current homeland in Nyanza from areas further North of the [[Mt. Elgon]] region of Kenya. This pre-Mt. Elgon homeland of Abagusii is referenced as Misiri according to their oral literature. This Misiri homeland is realistically the [[Nile Valley]] region adjacent to modern [[Ethiopia]] due to migration through the Rift Valley Province of Kenya. After migrating from Misiri, the Abagusii passed through the present day [[Rift Valley Province|Rift Valley]] province of Kenya and first settled at the Mt. Elgon region of present day Kenya where they stayed for several years before migrating to present day Nyanza province.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> The Mt.Elgon region of Kenya is the original point of dispersal of Abagusii to other regions of Kenya where they settled during the pre-colonial period as well as their current homeland in [[Nyanza Province]] of Kenya. In fact the actual migrations of Abagusii can be tracked to the Mt. Elgon region of Kenya as well as the Rift Valley province of Kenya. At the Mt. Elgon region of Kenya, the Abagusii came into contact with Luhya (with exception of Maragoli) tribes most of whom had migrated from [[Uganda]]  as well as [[Ogiek]] people. The Abagusii migrated together with some [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] groups and Luo as well as most other closely related tribes such as Abamaragoli, Abakuria, Ameru, Abasoga, Abatoro, and Abakiga who are very similar to Abagusii in some aspects.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> The other closely related tribes later migrated to Uganda, Rwanda and Northwest Tanzania. During their stay at Mt. Elgon region, the Abagusii  were mainly herders that kept cattle, goats, sheep, with minimal crop cultivation of finger millet, sorghum and arrow roots among other local crops. The Abagusii also practised some hunting and gathering (a practise that was borrowed from the [[Ogiek]] people of Mt. Elgon) to supplement the food they obtained from their animals and crops. The land at the Mt. Elgon area became unfavorable for their animals and crops thus forcing the Abagusii to migrate in search of good land mainly for pasture and cultivation of crops. At this time, the Abagusii migrated to Nyanza region whereas, the Abamaragoli migrated to Western Kenya and related tribes migrated to Uganda, Rwanda, and Northwest Tanzania. \n\nDuring settlement in Nyanza, the Abagusii first settled close to the shores of lake Victoria at modern day [[Kisumu]] where they practised fishing activity at lake Victoria. At lake Victoria, the Abagusii came into contact with small pockets of Bantu tribes akin to Luhya possibly from Uganda who had already settled at the shores of lake Victoria.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Most these earlier Bantu tribes were later assimilated by the Luo people who later settled in much of the shores of lake Victoria after Abagusii had migrated out of Kisumu. A good example of such Bantu tribes are the [[Suba language|Luo-Abasuba]] (not to be confused with Suba-Simbete and Suba/Suna-girango who are splinter groups from Abagusii) whose [[Suba language|Olosuba language]] is very different from [[Gusii language|Ekegusii]], [[Kuria language|Egikuria]], and [[Dholuo language]] as well as other languages spoken in Nyanza. The [[Suba language|Olosuba language]] is very similar to the [[Ganda language|Luganda language]] and some Luhya languages such as Lusamia and Lunyala. A majority of these earlier Bantu tribes at the shores of lake Victoria linguistically became extinct due language shift and assimilation mainly by the Luo people as well as Abagusii. The Luo-Abasuba are the only ones  left with their own language Olosuba still existent but spoken by few people as most of them speak Dholuo and most of them were completely assimilated by the Luo people. However, the Abagusii did not stay at this area for long and had to migrate out as the land was unfavorable for their animals and cultivation and there was frequent flooding in the area.  The abagusii then migrated to present day [[Kericho]] county where they also stayed for several years before migrating to their current homeland in Gusii highlands of Nyanza. At Kericho, the Abagusii built fortified walls with thick thorn fences and dug deep trenches around their homesteads as a defense against cattle theft and raids by the Maasai and Nandi who have always been their immediate neighbors.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref>\n\nThe Abagusii and Siria-maasai indeed lived side by side for several years in Kericho before Abagusii migrated to Gusii highlands.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> A number of clans from the Nandi and Tugen as well as other Kalenjin tribes later migrated to Kericho and this led to turmoil between them and Abagusii as well as the Siria-maasai.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> They first drove the Maasai out of Kericho before doing the same to the Abagusii who stayed at what came to be known as Kabianga. Their attempts to drive the Abagusii out of Kericho were unsuccessful as the Abagusii were more armed and had stronger warriors than the Maasai who raided them at night for that reason.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> Some of the Abagusii families/clans remained in Kericho merged with the Nandi, Tugen and other Nilotic Kalenjin clans  as well as Ogiek forming the modern day [[Kipsigis people|Kipsigis]] tribe. However, A majority of the Abagusii had to migrate out of Kericho as the area was deeply forested and unfavorable for crop cultivation and pasture for the animals.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> The Abagusii named the region where they stayed in Kericho as \"Kabianga\" which means \"to refuse\" to imply that crops and pasture for their livestock refused to grow. In fact most Abagusii cattle died and crops failed which caused famine and death of members of the community and this forced them to migrate to modern day Gusii highlands.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> At this point the Abagusii and Abakuria split into two distinct tribes with the Abakuria migrating to Migori and eventually to Northwest Tanzania where most of them reside today.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> The Abakuria  group that settled in Northwest Tanzania particularly the Mara and lake Victoria regions of Tanzania formed other tribes that populated much of Mara and lake Victoria region of Tanzania. A good example of such other closely related tribes include; Zanaki, Ngurimi, Ikoma and Haya among other related tribes in Northwest Tanzania. The other group originally part of the Abakuria group later migrated to modern Rwanda and Southern Uganda in the case of Abakiga and Abatoro who are linguistically and culturally similar to Abagusii. Indeed the oral traditions of Abakiga indicate migration from Northern Rwanda to Southern Uganda. From Kericho, the Abagusii migrated to their current homeland of Gusii highlands in Nyanza which was also originally forested just like Kericho. The Abagusii gradually cleared the forests in Gusii highlands for settlement and herding as well as crop cultivation. The forest cover on Gusii highlands has since then continued to decline as the Abagusii population became more and more dense as it is today. Some of the forests were cleared for tea plantations just like neighboring Kericho and Bomet counties of today. The Abagusii were originally organized into family units analogous to clans. The major Abagusii clans included, Abagetutu, Ababasi, Abanyaribari, Abanchari, Abagirango and others. However, during the 19 century with the introduction of maize, tea and coffee as well as other crops, the Abagusii now largely practise crop cultivation alongside keeping animals despite originally being predominantly pastoralists.\n\n==The Abagusii People today.==\nThe Abagusii are regarded as one of the most economically active communities in Kenya, with rolling tea estates, coffee, and banana groves. However, Kisii district has a very high population density. It is one of the most densely populated areas in Kenya (after the two cities of Nairobi and Mombasa), and the most densely populated rural area. It also has one of the highest fertility and population growth rates in Kenya (as evidenced by successive census and demographic surveys). In fact the fertility rate of Kisii ranks among the highest in the world, (see ''Kenyan Conundrum: A Regional Analysis of Population Growth and Primary Education (Paperback) by '''Juha I. Uitto [Author]''')''. These factors have ensured the Abagusii to be among the most geographically widespread communities in East Africa. A disproportionately large number of Abagusii have gone abroad in search of education.The Abagusii are some of the most heavily represented Kenyans in foreign (usually Indian and American) universities and a few in the United Kingdom.\nTheir lands are currently overpopulated despite their rolling fertile hills, spurring immigration to other cities in Kenya and a substantial representation in the [[United States]], especially in major hub cities like [[Houston]], [[Atlanta]], [[Jersey City]], [[Dallas]], [[Cleveland]] and [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul]]. The hard cash that flows from the diaspora has spawned significant economic prosperity in a locale lacking in politically motivated 'hand-me downs'.\n\nThe Abagusii people have as a result moved out of their two counties and can be found virtually in any part of Kenya and beyond. In [[Nairobi]], Mombasa, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kisumu and many other towns in Kenya, they run most businesses. For example, the \"matatu\" business in Nairobi estates like Utawala, kawangware, Dandora, Embakasi, Kitengela, Matasia, etc. They have bought land and are residents in most of these Nairobi estates like Utawala, Ruai, Joska, Kamulu, Kitengela, Rongai, Ngong, etc. They are generally, by nature, independent and thorough in their pursuits whether in education, professional practices, or even religious belief(Islam,  Christianity or Traditional African religions); making them more visible that their absolute numbers.The Abagusii people are very diverse in terms of culture, religion and appearance(ranging from caucasoid like to negroid like features). Abagusii people are not related to the Kissi people of West Africa or to the Kisi people of Malawi\n\n==Abagusii Relationship with Nilotic and Cushitic speakers.==\n\nThe division of indigenous African peoples into; Nilotic, Bantu, Niger-Congo, Cushitic, Sudanic, West Sudanic (West Africans), Nilo-saharan, Afro-asiatic, Chadic and Khoisan linguistic groups was a purely European concept that never existed in pre-colonial Africa.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo}}</ref> These linguistic classifications began in 1900s with [[ Joseph Greenberg]] and other European scholars and conquerors pioneering the idea of dividing African into different linguistic groups.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo}}</ref> The creation of all these linguistic groups made colonization of Africa easier as Africa was divided into regions based on the created linguistic groups. For instance, Southern African was defined as [[Khoisan]] area, Eastern Africa as a [[Cushitic]] area, Central Africa (and sometimes West Africa) as a [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] area, Sahelian region and Nile valley as a Nilo-saharan area and West Africa as a West Sudanic area.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo}}</ref> After creation of all these linguistic groups, collective histories for each group were created that assumed common origin of each linguistic group. For example, the Nilotic speaking communities were assumed to be from [[South Sudan]], the Cushitic speaking communities were assumed to be from [[Ethiopia]] and the Bantu speaking communities were assumed to be from the border of [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo}}</ref> These linguistic groups were also associated with specific economic activities regardless of what they practised. For instance, the Cushitic and Nilotic speaking communities were assumed to be all herders, and the Bantu speaking communities were assumed to be all farmers. Each of these linguistic group was assumed to be all genetically homogeneous and DNA haplogroups such as E1b1a, E1b1b, BM60, A3 and A1b1 were created for each group.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wood |first1=E |title=Contrasting patterns of Y chromosome and mtDNA variation in Africa: evidence for sex-biased demographic processes.}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=de Filippo |first1=C |title=Y-Chromosomal Variation in Sub-Saharan Africa: Insights Into the History of Niger-Congo Groups.

All these groups were polarized against each other depending on region and ethnic groups hence some of the conflicts and bitter relations witnessed today between different linguistic groups. Creation of these linguistic groups is one of the major contributing factor to the blanket stereotypes created against each of these linguistic groups in the modern African societies. In the context of [[Kenya]], the Abagusii relationship with the neighboring Nilotic speaking communities such as [[Maasai people]], [[Nandi people]], [[Kipsigis people]] and [[Luo people]] has always been painted as negative on social media and in public opinions of some people especially scholars and researchers. The Nilotic speaking communities have been stereotyped as hostile and warlike compared to the Abagusii people and the Bantu speaking African tribes in general. Despite these public opinions, the Abagusii indeed have had good relationships with the neighboring [[Nilotic]] speaking communities who have always been their neighbors since many years prior to colonization of Africa. Prior to colonization, the Abagusii engaged in barter trade with these communities especially the [[Luo people]] and at times worked together during cattle raids to defeat the raiders.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands.}}</ref> For instance, the Abagusii together with Luo and Maasai worked together to defeat the [[Kipsigis people|Kipsigis]] cattle raiders. \n\nThe Abagusii and Maasai also lived side by side around Kericho for many years before the Abagusii migration to their current homeland of Gusii highlands.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands.}}</ref> The co-existence between the Abagusii and the neighboring [[Nilotic]] communities was largely peaceful despite these communities and Abagusii occassionally engaging in cattle rustling activities which were sometimes violent. The cattle rustling and raiding was mainly common among the [[Maasai people]] and to a lesser extent the [[Kalenjin people]] who believed that cattle were given to them by God to control and take care of them. The Abagusii have more in common with the Nilotic speaking communities in terms of culture as well as migration and settlement patterns compared to the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] speaking communities. For instance, the Abagusii were originally predominantly herders in pre-colonial Africa and farmers to a lesser extent which is very similar to the Nilotic communities. The migration routes and settlement patterns of Abagusii in present day Kenya are very similar to those of the [[Kalenjin people]], [[Ateker people]] including [[Maasai people]] and [[Luo people]]. For instance, the original point of dispersal to other regions of Kenya was [[Mt. Elgon]] for the Abagusii, [[Kalenjin people]], [[Luo people]] and [[Ateker people]]. A number of clans of the neighboring Nilotic communities especially the Kipsigis have Abagusii origins suggesting a very close relationship between Abagusii and neighboring Nilotic speaking communities. In terms of relationship with the cushitic communities, the Abagusii don't live in close proximity with the [[Cushitic]] speaking communities that are mostly found in geographical Eastern and Northern Kenya. However, there is similarity between the Abagusii cultures and cultures of some cushitic communities particularly the East Cushitic communities such as [[Konso people]] and [[Oromo people]]. For instance, a majority of the Cushitic communities are herders which was originally dominant among Abagusii though still practised to a lesser extent. The oral literature of Abagusii indicate migration from Misiri that lie at the North of [[Mt. Elgon]] prior to settlement at the Mt. Elgon region of Kenya.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands.}}</ref> This pre-Elgon homeland of Abagusii is the [[Nile Valley]] region adjacent to modern [[Ethiopia]] thus the many similarities between Abagusii and the Nilotic and Cushitic speaking communities. The general conclusion is that the Abagusii have more in common with the Cushitic and Nilotic communities than with the Bantu speaking communities in several aspects. These similarities suggest that Abagusii share origins with some Cushitic and Nilotic communities. On the basis of the Abagusii history and migration routes, they could be more genetically related to some Nilotic and Cushitic speaking communities than they are related to the Bantu speaking communities. Indeed a majority of Abagusii share physical appearance with the some Cushitic and Nilotic speaking communities as well as with some Bantu speaking communities. For instance, an outsider will confuse a majority of Abagusii with the Cushitic speaking communities, Nilotic speakers and so being confused for the other Bantu speaking communities.\n\n==Abagusii Relationship with East Africa Bantu speakers==\n\nDuring the pre-colonial period, the Abagusii mostly had contact with the luo, Nandi, Kipsigis and maasai who have always been their immediate neighbors as well as other tribes at the [[Lake Victoria]] region of East Africa. The Abagusii Engaged in Barter Trade with some of these communities such as Luhya, Luo, Nandi, Kipsigis and maasai as well as other Lake Victoria communities depending on proximity.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ochieng |first1=William |title=People Of The South-Western Highlands}}</ref> The Abagusii had very limited contact with the Bantu speaking communities and led very independent and distinct life styles from a majority of the Bantu communities of East Africa and possibly the entire continent of Africa. Indeed even the [[Gusii language|Ekegusii language]] is significantly different from most East African as well as other Bantu languages of Africa in some structural elements.This supports the view that  Abagusii were originally separate from other East African Bantu tribes as well as the Bantu language group as whole, despite being linguistically classified as Bantu since the 1900s. In the context of Kenya, the Abagusii originally never had contact with the Bantu speaking communities in former central, Eastern and coastal provinces of Kenya. This is with the exception of [[Ameru]] that migrated to the former Upper Eastern province from geographical Western Kenya. Even in terms of linguistics, the Abagusii are closest to the Bantu communities at the Lake Victoria region as compared to communities in central, Eastern and Coastal provinces of Kenya as well as a large chunk of Tanzania which also borders lake Victoria. However, in the post-colonial period with the availability of modern transportation, the Abagusii have been able to contact the Bantu speaking communities in Central, Eastern and coastal provinces of Kenya with who they originally had no contact with. The Abagusii have also been able to learn of other Bantu communities they never knew before such as those far away from the lake region of Tanzania, Uganda and other African countries through modern Education on African linguistic groups.  A majority of the tribes now labelled Bantu barely knew each other during the precolonial period as they were originally very scattered and didn't have the concept of the term Bantu as a linguistic marker denoting hundreds of diverse tribes in Central, Eastern, and Southern Africa.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bleek |first1=Wilhelm |title=\u201cOn the Languages of Western and Southern Africa;\u201d.}}</ref> In the precolonial period the term Abantu (The term Abantu is a Nguni term and has distinct versions in other Bantu languages) out of which the term Bantu was coined, was only used to mean people with no Bantu as a linguistic group in mind.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bleek |first1=Wilhelm |title=\u201cOn the Languages of Western and Southern Africa;\u201d.}}</ref> The tribes now labelled as Bantu never had a sense of unity or belonging together during the precolonial period as they were very scattered and led very distinct and independent life styles having no knowledge of each other.\n\n\n===Etymology of Bantu and Relevance to Abagusii.===\n\nThe term \"Bantu\" originates from the Nguni languages of Southern Africa from the term \"Abantu\" which means people and was coined by [[Wilhelm Bleek]] in 1850s.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bleek |first1=Wilhelm |title=\u201cOn the Languages of Western and Southern Africa;\u201d.}}</ref> The term was originally and initially used in South Africa during the apartheid rule to refer to non-Khoisan South Africans and was later used as a linguistic marker denoting hundreds or thousands of unrelated tribes in Central, Eastern and Southern Africa.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bleek |first1=Wilhelm |title=\u201cOn the Languages of Western and Southern Africa;\u201d.}}</ref> The term \"Bantu\" has no grammatical meaning in the Nguni languages out of which it was coined. The singular form of the word Abantu is Umuntu which lenders the term Bantu meaningless as it makes no grammatical sense. The term Bantu as well as the so called Bantu speakers did not exist in precolonial Africa. Prior to colonization of Africa, the term \"Abantu\" as well as its other distinct versions in other so called Bantu languages was used to simply mean people and nothing more than just that. However, beginning 1900s with classification of indigenous African peoples into; Bantu, Niger-Congo, Nilotes, Nilo-saharan, Sudanic, West Sudanic(West Africans), Cushites, Afro-Asiatic, Hamites,and Khoisan,the term Bantu started being used in reference to tribes that occupy Central, Eastern and Southern Africa.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bleek |first1=Wilhelm |title=\u201cOn the Languages of Western and Southern Africa;\u201d.}}</ref>, <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo Family.}}</ref>These thousands of tribes were assumed to be the same and having a common origin on the basis of using words similar to Abantu in reference to people. The languages spoken by these tribes were also assumed to be the same and having a common origin on the basis of possessing words similar to Abantu.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bleek |first1=Wilhelm |title=\u201cOn the Languages of Western and Southern Africa;\u201d.}}</ref> The assumption that these very diverse and unconnected tribes share a common origin on the basis of the terms similar to Abantu contributed to them being lumped up together into one collective group called Bantu. The assumption that the Bantu languages are the same is not necessarily right given that these languages have very minimal structural similarities and lack mutual intelligibility. The speakers of these languages don't understand each other and were originally unconnected to each other. In precolonial Africa, these tribes barely knew each other and were very scattered with very little to no contact with each other. These tribes also never had a sense of unity or belonging together and led very independent and distinct life styles with no prior knowledge of each other. \n\nAfter creation of the Bantu linguistic group, a collective history was coined that assumed that all these thousands of tribes originated at the border of [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]] and expanded from their to other parts of Africa where they are found.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo Family.}}</ref> The assumption that these very diverse tribes that were originally very scattered and disunited expanded together from the border of Nigeria and Cameroon is rather absurd.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo Family.}}</ref> This raises the question of when these originally unconnected tribes learnt about each other and  decided to expand together from the border of Nigeria and Cameroon where they are absent.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo Family.}}</ref> This leads to conclusion that the so called Bantu expansion never occurred and the expansion was just used to justify land dispossession from the black South Africans during apartheid as well as other Africans during the colonial period. The assumption that thousands of the so called Bantu speaking tribes expanded from the border of Nigeria and Cameroon and are genetically and linguistically homogeneous is rather absurd and inaccurate.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Greenberg |first1=Joseph |title=Studies in African Linguistic Classification: I. The Niger-Congo Family.}}</ref> The Bantu speaking tribes are in fact the most diverse in Africa in terms of genetics, culture, appearance, origins, history and linguistics. The general assumption that belonging to the Bantu linguistic group automatically makes people genetically related is also quite absurd as these thousands of tribes lack a common origin and were randomly labelled Bantu on the basis of the simple term Abantu. Speaking a Bantu language does not necessarily mean that one cannot be related to people from other linguistic groups given that all these groups were also randomly lumped up together. For instance, the Bantu speaking tribes in Southern Africa are genetically more related to [[Khoisan]] than they are related to East African Bantu tribes and other regions. The Bantu speaking tribes in East Africa especially [[Kenya]] are also genetically more related to the [[Nilotic]] and [[Cushitic]] speaking communities than to the Central African Bantu speaking tribes that are also more related to Southern African Bantu speaking communities. Therefore the term Bantu has no genetic meaning other than just being a linguistic marker of several thousands of unrelated tribes. The over 600 Bantu languages are distinct from each other enough to be treated as distinct languages that don't belong to one collective linguistic group. In terms of importance, the term Bantu only has meaning to the Nguni languages out of which it was coined as well as other tribes with the exact spellings of the term \"Abantu\". The term is of no meaning and importance to Abagusii as it is a mere linguistic marker and not a genetic marker of several diverse African tribes.\n\n==Agriculture and biodiversity in Gusiiland.==\n\nIn the past, Gusiiland was a heavily forested area, with old indigenous broadleaf rainforest trees and other flora. It was part of the old Congo Basin forests. The only remnant of this old forest in Kenya is the Kakamega Forest, which is the westernmost tip of the Equatorial rainforest. The two ancient forest areas were linked through Nandi and Kericho, before the Nandi and Kericho areas were cleared for tea farming and settlement. Now most of the tree life in Gusiiland consists of members of 4 tree families, all of them introduced from outside the continent. The most common trees in Gusiiland are the ''Eucalyptus spp.'' family (blue gum/eucalyptus), ''Grevillea robusta'' and Black Wattle (Acacia mearnsii). All these three species are native to Australia. Finally, there is the ''Cupressus spp.'' family (cypress) native to South America. Other plant life forms are cultivated tea, bananas, maize, coffee and napier grass, with very little remaining of indigenous biodiversity.\n\nIt has been theorized that in future Gusiiland will increasingly be 'colonized' by the above few species of plants, as there is little awareness or even desire to re-plant the slow-growing and less economically valuable indigenous plant forms. This is aggravated by land shortage and reduced need for traditional herbal medicine, that has now been surpassed by modern hospitals and medical care.\n\n==Abagusii Economic Activities.==\n\n===Subsistence Agriculture and Herding.===\n\nDuring the pre-colonial period, the Abagusii cultivated finger millet, sorghum, root crops and bananas as well as other local crops.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> By 1920s with introduction of maize to Gusiiland, finger millet and sorghum were largely replaced by maize as a staple and cash crop.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Other crops cultivated by Abagusii today include cassava, potatoes, tomatoes, bananas, beans, onions, tropical fruits and peas as well as several other crops.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> By 1930s, coffee and tea had reached Gusiiland and were being cultivated as major cash crops. <ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> During the pre-colonial period as well as early colonial period, the Ox-drawn plows and iron hoes were used in the cultivation of crops.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Today the same cultivation tools are used alongside modern cultivation tools. During the pre-colonial period, the Abagusii were predominantly herders that kept cattle, goats and sheep as well as kept poultry.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Today, the Abagusii still keep livestock and poultry alongside farming.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The high population density of Abagusii has contributed to utilization of available land for agriculture to satisfy subsistence and commercial needs thus making farming a dominant activity.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> In addition to agriculture, the Abagusii also carry out business activities in major towns and cities in Kenya and abroad.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The Abagusii also participate in white collar jobs in Kenya and abroad.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Industrial Activities===\n\nDuring the pre-colonial period, Abagusii produced iron tools, weapons, decorations, wooden implements, and baskets for diverse uses.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The Abagusii also made pottery products such as pots and imported some from the neighboring Luo community.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The most respected and highly valued activity was smelting of iron ore and manufacture of iron tools.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The blacksmiths were highly respected, wealthy and influential members of Abagusii society, but did not form a special caste as the Abagusii society was not based on caste stratifications.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Smithing activities were mainly carried out by men.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Trade===\nThe form of trade carried out on pre-colonial Gusiiland was barter trade and mostly took place within homesteads as well as with neighboring communities especially the Luo people.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The major products exchanged included tools, weapons, crafts, livestock, and agricultural products.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The cattle served as a form of currency among Abagusii for the products exchanged and goats were used as a currency for lower valued products.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The barter trade between Abagusii and Luo took place at border markets and at Abagusii farms and was mainly carried out by women.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Today with advent of modern concept of trade, the Abagusii have established shopping centers, shops and markets which have connected them with other regions of Kenya beside the neighboring communities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> These markets are increasing exponentially and the Abagusii are getting more and more connected to the rest of Kenya as opposed to the pre-colonial Kenya where they only had contact with neighboring communities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Division of Labor.===\nIn the traditional Abagusii society, labor was divided between males and females. The women specific duties included cooking, crop cultivation and processing, fetching water and firewood, brewing, and cleaning while the men specific duties included herding, building houses and fences, and clearing cultivation fields, and other duties.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Men were also involved in crop cultivation but with more responsibilities than women. Herding was primarily carried out by boys and unmarried men in the grazing fields and girls and unmarried young women helped with crop cultivation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Today the division of labor between males and females has significantly changed and is now disadvantageous to women as they perform most of the duties traditionally meant for men. <ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> There is no longer equal distribution of labor between men and women as it was traditionally.\n\n==Language==\nThey speak the [[Gusii language|Ekegusii]] (also called omonwa Bwekegusii). However, some older texts refer to this community as ''Kosova''. This language and some other [[Great Lakes Bantu languages]] have some similarities in structure but not mutually intelligible. They are markedly similar to the Bakiga of south western Uganda in culture, industry and choice of terrain. The LuTooro language of Western Uganda shares a great many words with Ekegusii. For instance, \"''omoiseke''\" is the Ekegusii for 'girl' and the word in LuTooro is just the same save for a slight difference in inflection.\n\n==Culture==\nThe Abagusii play a large bass [[lyre]] called ''[[obokano]]''. They are also known by their world-famous soapstone sculptures \"chigware\" mostly concentrated in the southern parts of Kisii County around Tabaka town. Circumcision of boys at around age of 10 as a rite of passage without anesthesia is common among the Abagusii. The girls also underwent clitoridectomy as a form of circumcision at an earlier age than boys.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> This ritual takes place annually in the months of November and December followed by a period of seclusion during which the boys are led in different activities by older boys and girls are led by older girls, and is a great time of celebration indeed for families and communities at large. Family, friends and neighbors are invited days in advance by candidates to join the family. During this period of seclusion only older circumcised boys and girls are allowed to visit the secluded initiates and any other visitor could cause a taboo. Its during this period that initiates were taught their roles as young men in the community and the do's and the don'ts of a circumcised man. The initiated boys and girls were also taught the rules of same (\"Chinsoni\") and respect (\"Ogosika\").<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref>\n\nSome of the notable musicians from the Abagusii community include Nyashinski, Rajiv Okemwa Raj, Ringtone, Mwalimu Arisi O'sababu, Christopher Monyoncho, Sungusia, Riakimai '91 Jazz, Embarambamba, Bonyakoni Kirwanda junior band, Mr Ong'eng'o, Grandmaster Masese, Deepac Braxx (The Heavyweight Mc), Jiggy, Mr. Bloom, Virusi, Babu Gee, Brax Rnb, Sabby Okengo, Machoge One Jazz,among others.\n\n==Abagusii Religion, faith and beliefs==\n\nPrior to Introduction of Christianity and Islam to Africa, the Abagusii people believed in a supreme God called Engoro. This same God is also popularly called Nyasae among Abagusii. The Abagusii believe that Engoro also known as Nyasae created the Universe and was the source of all life. Death and disease was considered unnatural events brought on by witchcraft. The Abagusii also believed in medicine men and the spirits of their ancestors called \"Ebirecha\". The displeasure of ancestor spirits was evidenced by disease, death of people and livestock as well as destruction of crops.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> However, today a majority of Abagusii people practise Christianity with the Adventist protestant Christianity being the most dominant and a few practising Catholicism. A minority of Abagusii still adhere to their traditional religion and some being dual religion observing Christianity alongside their traditional religion. The practise of Islam among Abagusii is very little to absent.\n\n==Marriage==\n\nAmong the Abagusii community, traditional marriage was arranged by the parents, using intermediaries called \"chisigani\", who also acted as referees for the bride and groom to be. The parents negotiated the dowry and organised a traditional wedding. The traditional wedding ceremony involved a mentor called \"omoimari\" who could provide continuing support to the newly married couple. Currently, civil and Christian marriages are recognized among the Abagusii. It is essential to note that traditions within the Abagusii community prohibit marriages between members of the same clan. Marriage was officially established through payment of dowry in the form of cattle to the wife's family.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Payment of dowry allowed man and woman to be considered husband and wife and gave room for a traditional marriage ceremony.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Divorce is traditionally not allowed among Abagusii as marriage is considered a permanent union that is only disrupted by death.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref>\n\n===Living Conditions===\n\nTraditionally, a typical Gusii family is polygamous with one man having more than one wife that live in the same homestead. The polygamous family was divided into two constituents namely the homestead called \"Omochie\" and the cattle camps called \"Ebisarate\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The married man and his wives and their unmarried daughters and uncircumcised boys lived in the \"Omochie\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The \"Ebisarate\" were situated in the grazing fields and were protected by male warriors against theft by cattle rustlers and raiders.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The traditional Gusii compound also had elevated granaries for storage of crop harvests such as millet and other crops.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The Abagusii traditionally built fortified walls around their homesteads and villages for protection against cattle rustling wars,and raids by neighboring communities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The Abagusii also dug trenches around their homesteads for the purposes of protection against raids. The fortified walls built around homesteads and villages as well as trenches also served as a protection against dangerous wild animals. However, the cattle camps were abolished in 1913 by the British forcing Abagusii to live in dispersed homesteads as compared to traditional homestead set up.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> A typical traditional Gusii house is mad-walled with a conical grass thatched roofs that is mainly round and sometimes rectangular in shape.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The modern houses are still mad-wall with round and rectangular shapes but the roofs have corrugated iron sheets and grass thatched.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> The Abagusii also built stone-walled houses today.\n\n==Food and Nutrition==\n\nTheir staple meal is Obokima (dish of millet flour, or Sorghum flour cooked with water to a hardened dough-like consistency). It is often served with ''rinagu, chinsaga, rikuneni, enderema,emboga,omotere, risosa, egesare'' among other locally available green leaves consumed as vegetables. It can also be served with any other stew. The word for ''\"having a meal\" [ragera]'' usually connotes a meal involving ''[obokima]'' at the centre. However, by 1920s maize had been introduced to Gusiiland and had overtaken finger millet and sorghum as staple crops and cash crops which ensured that maize became the new dominant staple crop.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> As a result, maize flour is now largely used to prepare Obokima although millet and sorghum flour is still used to a lesser extent. The Obokima was also served with milk particularly sour milk from livestock.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gusii |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/fiske/135b/gusii.htm}}</ref> Although frequently associated with \"ritoke\" (plural \"amatoke\", cooked and flavoured bananas), this is usually supplemental and not considered to be a proper meal, but a popular snack.\n\n==Notable Abagusii People==\n* [[David Kenani Maraga]], President of the [[Supreme Court of Kenya]].\n* [[Zachary Onyonka]], Former Education and Foreign Affairs Minister\n* [[Sam Ongeri]], Former Minister of Foreign Affairs and current Senator of Kisii County\n* [[Fred Matiang'i]],  Cabinet Secretary for the Ministry of Interior  and Coordination of National Security\n* [[Simeon Nyachae]], Former Cabinet Minister\n* [[James Ongwae]], First Governor of Kisii County\n* [[Caspal Maina Momanyi]],Assistant Education Permanent Secretary\n* [[Janet Ong'era]], Kisii County Woman Member of [[National Assembly (Kenya)|The National Assembl]]<nowiki/>y\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n1.
