It was altered in 2006 to resemble the town's arms more closely, including the [[Latin]] motto ''Animo et Fide'', which loosely translated, means ''With Courage and Faith''.<ref name=\"Stockport - Explanation of the Arms of Stockport\">{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/towns/stockport3.html|title=Stockport \u2013 Explanation of the Arms of Stockport|last=Moss|first=John|date=28 April 2009|website=Manchester 2002|publisher=Papillon Graphics AD 2013 Manchester|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122022349/http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/towns/stockport3.html|archive-date=22 November 2015|accessdate=29 August 2015}}</ref> The blue shield is taken from the coat of arms of the 'de Stokeport' family, from whom Stockport derives its name.<ref name=\"Stockport - Explanation of the Arms of Stockport\" /><ref name=\"Secret Stockport\" /> The twin-towered castle above the shield is [[Stockport Castle]], which stood until 1775.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=1085399|title=Pastscape \u2013 Stockport Castle|last=|first=|date=29 August 2015|website=Pastscape|publisher=Historic Engand|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>\n\nAfter the completion by the 2015 Group takeover of the club, a new crest was adopted. It was still based on the [[Stockport]] coat of arms, though the ''Animo et Fide'' motto was removed, along with a patch of green at the base of the badge; the [[flag of Cheshire]], featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons \u2013 one at the top, with ''Animo et Fide'', and one at the bottom with ''Stockport County F.C.''. In addition, the football was again removed from the shield. The [[Stockport County Supporters' Co-operative]] used the blue on white cross symbol from the 1978 badge as the main identifier in their company logo. Stockport's kit was supplied by local manufacturer [[Umbro]] who supplied all three kits for the 2013\u201314 season, replacing [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]].

It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants.<ref name=\"Trautmann The Biography\" /> Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm|title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999|last=Efs|first=Thomas|date=23 June 2006|website=European Football Statistics|publisher=|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm|archivedate=3 January 2014|accessdate=24 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

The programme was produced by production company [[Kudos (production company)|Kudos]] and directed by Sarah O'Gorman. The programme centres itself around a \"record producer\" (of music compilation albums) Rob Black ([[Daniel Mays]]), whose girlfriend ([[Miranda Raison]]) has dumped him to marry \"[[Duncan James|Duncan from Blue]]\".

In his attempt to get one up on his new nemesis, Rob decides to find Duncan\u2019s first love, Jo, and ask her to the wedding as his \u2018plus one\u2019.  However, he finds her in a coma, under the care of her mother who is hoping to raise money for her treatment by holding a fun run. In an attempt to impress Nicola Dare (Susie Amy) - his own first love - after having insulted her transgender brother, Rob decides to participate in the fun run himself. Doubting his ability to run 20&nbsp;km, he plans to cut through the middle of the devised route. He turns up at the event with a cheque donating the greatest amount - most of which was put in from himself instead of sponsors - which earns him great popularity. However, while cutting through the middle of the route, he trips, hits his head on a log and is knocked unconscious. He wakes up with his shoes having been stolen by a tramp, and ends up getting kicked in the crotch by someone who assumes he is also homeless. A five-year-old girl catches him holding his groin in pain, and he proceeds to run to the end of the fun run, where the rest of the participants are awaiting his arrival to celebrate his generous donation. As he arrives, Duncan appears and provides a donation of \u00a317,000, making him the largest donor instead of Rob. Already frustrated, the parents of the five-year-old girl appear and accuse him of masturbating in front of a young girl, and he is chased further.\n\n*'''Episode 2:''' ''Black White and Red All Over''\nT4 is featuring the buildup to Duncan and Linsey\u2019s wedding in reality show One Love. Rob feels he needs to find an impressive girl to have on his arm if he\u2019s to show his ex just what she has missed out on.  Enter Rich - Rob's brother - and his girlfriend\u2019s sister, Abby (Sophie Winkleman); a gorgeous West End star who always has to have what she wants.  In an attempt to secure her as his plus one, Rob agrees to go to a 'bad taste' fancy dress party with Abby, dressed as a panda. Before the party, she paints his face to resemble a panda, but ends up getting the colours the wrong way round.  A car crash on the way leads to a nasty case of whiplash and Rob offending two paramedics with his facepaint. The paramedics call Linsey, who arrives at the hospital along with T4\u2019s Steve Jones, a million TV viewers and Duncan from Blue. Continuing to offend people with his accidentally racist facepaint, the episode ends with Duncan telling young children in the hospital how it's wrong to be racist and wondering why we all can't just get along.\n\n*'''Episode 3:''' ''See it in a Boys Lies''\nRich persuades Rob that he needs a model to accompany him to the wedding. Working in the music compilation industry by placing songs in a spreadsheet, he has access to beautiful models only through the means of his colleague Laura, who works in graphic design. He convinces her to set up a photoshoot with model Aimee, who becomes more and more attracted to him when Laura tells her all the celebrities he has allegedly worked with, including mentioning that Rob and Jamelia are 'practically best friends'. After the shoot, Rob fantasizes about kissing Laura on their desk and begins to see her in a different way. Aimee invites Rob and Laura to a club night, and notice Jamelia is at the same club. Aimee begs Rob to introduce them, leading to him pleading with Jamelia to go along with the story that they're friends. She goes along with it, grudgingly, and tells Aimee that he is a very talented breakdancer. Having to go along with this story to impress Aimee, he performs a dance routine and manages to impress Jamelia, Aimee and Laura. However, this is short-lived when he kicks Laura in the face and is thrown out of the club. He drives alongside her, trying to apologise, and is arrested for mistakenly trying to solicit sex with Laura whom they think is a prostitute.\n\n*'''Episode 4:''' ''The Competition Winner''\nRob decides the only way he can upstage Linsey and Duncan in their celebrity wedding magazine pictures is by taking a celebrity as his plus one. Spotting George Clooney's ex Lisa Snowdon across a crowded bar gives him an idea - however he needs a 'competition winner' to even have a chance at meeting her. His brother, Rich, offers his assistance with one of his pupils, Craig, who pretends to be disabled - for a price of money and video games - to get Rob in with Lisa. An allergic reaction to peanuts on Craig's part leads to Lisa having to leave the date early but scheduling a lunch appointment with Rob the next day. Rob tells her about Linsey and Duncan's wedding, and Lisa insists he takes her as his plus one in order to upstage the bride and groom. However, his happiness son comes crashing down, as Craig's mother finds him and accuses him of grooming her son with money and video games in front of a crowd of paparazzi.\n\n*'''Episode 5:''' ''One Love''\nAfter a catalogue of dating disasters, close shaves with the law and public disgrace in front of celebrities and models, Rob decides to give up looking for the perfect plus one to outshine Linsey and Duncan.  However, before long he meets the beautiful Astrid (a millionaire, supermodel, biochemist whose dad invented [[Toilet Duck]]), and they quickly fall for each other. On spending the night together and joining Linsey and Duncan for a double date, he decides Astrid is the perfect plus one. However, on arriving at the wedding in her Aston Martin, Astrid appears to be slightly uncomfortable. The priest asks for any objections, and Astrid pulls out a knife, stabbing Duncan in his [[testicle]]. It is revealed that she is his number one stalker, believing that she should be his bride. The wedding is ruined, and Linsey and Duncan plan to do it all again in the future. Laura hints at Rob to take her to the next wedding instead of hunting down models and celebrities, but Duncan bursts into the office in tears, claiming that Linsey ran off with Steve Jones, who was covering their wedding for T4.\n\n==External links ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090202095745/http://www.channel4.com/programmes/plus-one Plus One Homepage] Channel 4 \n\n[[Category:Channel 4 television programmes]]\n[[Category:Channel 4 sitcoms]]\n[[Category:2000s British television series]]\n[[Category:2009 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2009 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:Comedy Showcase]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2014}}\n{{Use British English|date=February 2014}}\n{{primary sources|date=June 2011}}\n{{infobox television\n | show_name = Plus One\n | image = \n | caption = \n | runtime = 30 mins\n | creator = [[Tim Allsop & Stewart Williams|Tim Allsop]]<br>[[Tim Allsop & Stewart Williams|Stewart Williams]]\n | starring = [[Daniel Mays]]<br>[[Miranda Raison]]<br>[[Nigel Harman]]<br>[[Steve John Shepherd]]<br>[[Ingrid Oliver]]<br>[[Ruth Bradley]]<br>[[Duncan James]]\n | composer = Mark Thomas\n | country = United Kingdom\n | network = [[Channel 4]]\n | director = Sarah O'Gorman\n | producer = [[Kudos (production company)|Kudos]]\n | editor = Nick Ames\n | cinematography = Ian Liggett\n | first_aired =  9 January 2009\n | last_aired = 6 February 2009\n | num_episodes = 5\n}}\n\n'''''Plus One''''' is a British sitcom written and created by [[Tim Allsop & Stewart Williams|Tim Allsop]] and [[Tim Allsop & Stewart Williams|Stewart Williams]], originally broadcast in 2007 as part of [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[Comedy Showcase]]'', before a full series of five episode was commissioned and began transmitting on 9 January 2009.

Mostly known for booting someone in the chest. After studying law, Butler turned to acting in the mid-1990s with small roles in productions such as ''[[Mrs Brown]]'' (1997), the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] film ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'' (1997), and ''[[Tale of the Mummy]]'' (1998). In 2000, he starred as [[Dracula in popular culture|Dracula]] in the horror film ''[[Dracula 2000]]'' with [[Christopher Plummer]] and [[Jonny Lee Miller]].\n\nHe subsequently played [[Attila|Attila the Hun]] in the miniseries ''[[Attila (miniseries)|Attila]]'' (2001) and then appeared in the films ''[[Reign of Fire (film)|Reign of Fire]]'' with [[Christian Bale]] (2002) and ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider \u2013 The Cradle of Life]]'' with [[Angelina Jolie]] (2003), before playing Andr\u00e9 Marek in the adaptation of [[Michael Crichton]]'s science fiction adventure ''[[Timeline (2003 film)|Timeline]]'' (2003). He then was cast as the role of [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|Erik, The Phantom]] in [[Joel Schumacher]]'s 2004 film adaptation of the musical ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (2004 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' alongside [[Emmy Rossum]]. That role earned him a [[Satellite Award]] nomination for [[Satellite Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Best Actor]].\n\nButler gained worldwide recognition for his portrayal of [[Leonidas I|King Leonidas]] in [[Zack Snyder]]'s fantasy war film ''[[300 (film)|300]]''. That role earned him nominations for an [[Empire Award for Best Actor]] and a [[Saturn Award for Best Actor]] and a win for [[MTV Movie Award for Best Fight]]. In the 2010s, he voiced the role of Stoick the Vast in the animated action-fantasy film ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'', a role he later reprised in ''[[Legend of the Boneknapper Dragon]]'' (2010), ''[[Gift of the Night Fury]]'' (2011), ''[[How to Train Your Dragon 2]]'' (2014), and ''[[How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World]]'' (2019). Also in the 2010s, he portrayed Secret Service agent Mike Banning in the action thriller trilogy ''[[Olympus Has Fallen]]'', ''[[London Has Fallen]]'', and ''[[Angel Has Fallen]]''. He played military leader [[Attius Tullius|Tullus Aufidius]] in the 2011 film ''[[Coriolanus (2011 film)|Coriolanus]]'', a modernized adaptation of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s [[Coriolanus|tragedy of the same name]].

He mostly lived in [[Venice Beach]], working at different jobs, travelling often, and, according to him, drinking heavily, at one point being arrested for alcohol-related disorderly conduct.

However, he continued to stay out late drinking and he frequently missed work because of this. One week before he qualified as a lawyer, he was fired. At the age of 25, and an unqualified lawyer, Butler moved to London to pursue his dream of becoming famous. He admitted, \"When I started out, I'm not sure I was actually in it for the right reasons. I wanted very much to be famous.\"<ref name=\"telegraph\" />\n\nUnable to win any acting roles initially, he worked in a variety of jobs including as a waiter, a telemarketer and a demonstrator of how toys work at fairs. Whilst in London, he met an old friend from his teenage days in the Scottish Youth Theatre, who was now a London casting director. At that time, he was her boyfriend and her assistant. She took him to an audition for [[Steven Berkoff]]'s play of ''[[Coriolanus]]''.<ref name=\"paisley\" /> The director said of Butler's audition, \"When he read, he had such vigour and enthusiasm\u2014so much that it made the other actors seem limp\u2014that I decided to cast him in the ensemble.\"<ref name=\"telegraph_a\" />\n\nThen aged 27, Butler had his first professional acting job. Less than a year later, he won a part in a theatre adaptation of ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]'', which he performed at the [[Edinburgh Festival]]. At age 30, Butler decided to move to Los Angeles; there he won parts in ''[[Dracula 2000]]'', ''[[Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life|Tomb Raider 2]]'', ''[[Dear Frankie]]'', and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (2004 film)|Phantom of the Opera]]''.<ref name=\"telegraph_a\" />\n\n===Acting career===\nIn [[London]], Butler held a series of odd jobs until being cast by actor and director [[Steven Berkoff]] (who later appeared alongside him in ''[[Attila (TV miniseries)|Attila]]'' (2001)) in a stage production of ''[[Coriolanus]]''. He was cast as [[Ewan McGregor]]'s character Renton in the stage adaptation of ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'', the same play that had inspired him to become an actor.<ref name=\"film\"/> His film debut was as [[Billy Connolly]]'s character's younger brother in ''[[Mrs Brown]]'' (1997).<ref>{{cite web|title=Mrs Brown|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0078lkb|publisher=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=25 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nHis film career continued with small roles, first in the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] film ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'' (1997)<ref name=\"film\">{{cite web|title=Gerard Butler Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/gerard-butler-20808745|publisher=biography.com|accessdate=25 February 2015}}</ref> and then [[Russell Mulcahy]]'s ''[[Tale of the Mummy]]'' (1998). In 2000, Butler was cast in two breakthrough roles, the first being Attila the Hun in the American TV miniseries ''[[Attila (TV miniseries)|Attila]]'' (2001).

However, he continued to stay out late drinking and he frequently missed work because of this. One week before he qualified as a lawyer, he was fired. At the age of 25, and an unqualified lawyer, Butler moved to London to pursue his dream of becoming famous. He admitted, \"When I started out, I'm not sure I was actually in it for the right reasons. I wanted very much to be famous.\"<ref name=\"telegraph\" />\n\nUnable to win any acting roles initially, he worked in a variety of jobs including as a waiter, a telemarketer and a demonstrator of how toys work at fairs. Whilst in London, he met an old friend from his teenage days in the Scottish Youth Theatre, who was now a London casting director. At that time, he was her boyfriend and her assistant. She took him to an audition for [[Steven Berkoff]]'s play of ''[[Coriolanus]]''.<ref name=\"paisley\" /> The director said of Butler's audition, \"When he read, he had such vigour and enthusiasm\u2014so much that it made the other actors seem limp\u2014that I decided to cast him in the ensemble.\"<ref name=\"telegraph_a\" />\n\nThen aged 27, Butler had his first professional acting job. Less than a year later, he won a part in a theatre adaptation of ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]'', which he performed at the [[Edinburgh Festival]]. At age 30, Butler decided to move to Los Angeles; there he won parts in ''[[Dracula 2000]]'', ''[[Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life|Tomb Raider 2]]'', ''[[Dear Frankie]]'', and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (2004 film)|Phantom of the Opera]]''.<ref name=\"telegraph_a\" />\n\n===Acting career===\nIn [[London]], Butler held a series of odd jobs until being cast by actor and director [[Steven Berkoff]] (who later appeared alongside him in ''[[Attila (TV miniseries)|Attila]]'' (2001)) in a stage production of ''[[Coriolanus]]''.

The word is sometimes rendered with the nasalised vowels as ''G\u00e3'' or ''G\u00e3g\u00e3''. Historian [[Carl Christian Reindorf]] confirmed this etymology, proposing a link between the martial qualities and migratory behaviour of the local ants and those of the Ga people. The link between the [[ethnonym]] and ants was explicitly reflected in the recognition of anthills as sacred places. Often ringed by sacred fences (''aklabatsa''), the tall red mounds dotting Accra's hinterland were seen as microcosms of human community and as nodal points between the known world and the world of the dead.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhile the Ga used the reference to the invasive species of dark-brown swarming ants to connote military prowess and their ancient conquest of [[Guang languages|Guang]] speakers residing in the Accra Plains, the Akan-speaking appropriation and translation of this metaphor had a less than generous meaning. Instead of viewing Ga speakers as a formidable military force, the Akan-speaking term \"''Nkran''\" cast Ga peoples as pests or nuisances to be controlled or exterminated.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6ZB2CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA30&dq=accra+nkran#v=onepage&q=accra%20nkran&f=false |title=Gold Coast Diasporas: Identity, Culture, and Power |last=Rucker |first=Walter C. |date=28 September 2015 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-01701-7 |location= |pages=30 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe name ''Ga'' is actually a cognate of the name ''Akan'', one of a few words in which {{IPA|[g]}} corresponds to {{IPA|[k]}} in Akan.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=erLnCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA113&dq=accra+akra#v=onepage&q=accra%20akra&f=false |title=Korle Meets the Sea: A Sociolinguistic History of Accra |last=Dakubu |first=Mary Esther Kropp |date=1 January 1997 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-506061-4 |location= |pages=113 |language=en}}</ref> ''Ga'' also gave its name to the [[Greater Accra Region#Districts|Ga districts]] surrounding Accra.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PEQgnFtkxmMC&pg=PA4&dq=accra+nkran#v=onepage&q=accra%20nkran&f=false |title=The City of Accra \u2013 A Pictorial Visit |last=Ntiamoah |first=Eric Maclean |date=1 January 2008 |publisher=AuthorHouse |isbn=978-1-4343-5860-8 |location= |pages=4 |language=en}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe spelling ''Accra'' was given to ''Nkran'' by [[Europeans]].<ref name=\":1\" /> An earlier spelling used by the [[Danish colonial empire|Danes]] was ''Akra.''<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tVJuQbQ0UgwC&pg=PA89&dq=accra+akra#v=onepage&q=accra%20akra&f=false |title=The Spiritual in the Secular: Missionaries and Knowledge about Africa |last=Harries |first=Patrick |last2=Maxwell |first2=David |date=20 July 2012 |publisher=Wm.

Nkran was later corrupted by the [[Danes]] to Akra, then to present-day Accra. ''Nkran'' in the [[Ga language]] is ''Gaga'', thus they also started calling themselves Ga. Due to their sheer numbers, the indigenous Lartehs thus relocated to the [[Akuapem Mountains|Akuapem]] ridge. The Ga are also part of the main Guan group that started the initial migration from the [[Nubian people|Nubia Empire]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.akuapem.com/gpage4.html |title=The Larteh Story |accessdate=6 July 2015 |publisher=Akuapem Organisation |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811010134/http://akuapem.com/gpage4.html |archivedate=11 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nInitially, Accra was not the most prominent trading centre; the trade hubs of the time were the ports at [[Ada, Ghana|Ada]] and [[Prampram]], along with the inland centres of [[Dodowa]] and [[Akuse]]. The Dutch built the nearby outposts of [[Ussher Fort]] while the British and the Swedes built James Fort and Christiansborg castles, respectively. By the 17th century, Portugal, France and Denmark, had constructed forts in the city.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nBritain gradually acquired the interests of all other countries beginning in 1851, when Denmark sold [[Fort Christiansborg|Christiansborg]] (which they had acquired from the Swedes) and their other forts to the British. The Netherlands was the last to sell out, in 1871. In 1873, after decades of tension between the British and [[Ashanti people|Ashantis]], the British attacked and virtually destroyed [[Kumasi]]. The British then captured Accra in 1874, and in 1877, at the end of the second [[Anglo-Asante Wars|Anglo-Asante War]], Accra replaced [[Cape Coast]] as the capital of the British [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]]. This decision was made because Accra had a drier climate relative to Cape Coast. Until this time, the settlement of Accra was confined between Ussher Fort to the east and the [[Korle Lagoon]] to the west.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.africanexecutive.com/modules/magazine/articles.php?article=994 |title=History of Accra |accessdate=22 July 2010 |publisher=The African Executive |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707101722/http://www.africanexecutive.com/modules/magazine/articles.php?article=994 |archivedate=7 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nAs the newly established Gold Coast's administrative functions were moved to Accra (1877), an influx of British colonial administrator and settlers grew around the Christiansborg (modern Osu, Ministries, Ridge, Labone, and Cantonments) began, and the city began to expand to accommodate the new residents. Victoriaborg was formed in the late 19th century as an exclusively European residential neighbourhood, located to the east of the city limits of the time. The boundaries of Accra were further stretched in 1908. This expansion entailed the creation of a native-only neighbourhood, intended to accommodate members of the native population as a means of relieving congestion problems in the overcrowded city centre. [[Adabraka]] was thus established to the north of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.macalester.edu/courses/geog261/eskidmore/history.htm |title=History of Accra |accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hauptstra\u00dfeAccra18851908 300dpi.jpg|thumb|right|A main street of central Accra sometime between 1885 and 1908]]\n\nOne of the most influential decisions in the history of the city was that of building the Accra-Kumasi railway in 1908. This was to connect Accra, the country's foremost port at that time, with Ghana's main [[cocoa bean|cocoa]]-producing regions. In 1923, the railway was completed, and by 1924, cocoa was Ghana's largest export.\n\nThe British Gold Coast heavily influenced the shape that Accra took during this period. For example, [[racial segregation]] of neighbourhoods was mandated by law until 1923, and all new buildings were required to be built out of stone or concrete. Despite these regulations, British settlers of the Gold Coast were very hesitant to invest any large amount of money into the city to maintain its infrastructure or improve public works. This did not change until the governorship of [[Gordon Guggisberg|Sir Frederick Gordon Guggisberg]] during which period the three separate settlements (Osu, La and Jamestown) merged to become modern Accra. Guggisberg's administration laid out the present grid networked neighborhoods of Tudu, Adabraka and Asylum Down.\n\nAmong the achievements of Guggisberg was the building of a bridge across the Korle Lagoon in 1923, which opened the land west of the lagoon for settlement. Guggisberg also oversaw the building of a major hospital (Korle-Bu) and secondary school (Achimota). Such improvements led to an increase in Accra's population due to the [[rural-urban migration|migration of rural dwellers]] into the city, and the immigration of increasing numbers of British businessmen and administrators.\n\n=== After World War II ===\n[[File:Jamestown lighthouse.jpg|thumb|upright|<center>[[Jamestown Lighthouse]] in [[Jamestown/Usshertown, Accra|Jamestown/Usshertown]]</center>]]\nIn the years following [[World War II]], the neighbourhoods of Ridge and Cantonments were planned as low-density developments for Europeans, while many rural migrants settled in neighbourhoods which had not yet been incorporated into Accra's municipal boundary, such as Nima and surrounding areas. Thus, the development of these neighbourhoods was unregulated by the government, creating a crowded and jumbled [[shanty-town]] landscape.\n\nAnother area of Accra that took shape at this time was the central business district (CBD). More administrative buildings were built on High Street, forming a massive judicial/administrative complex. Additionally, the expansion of the economy led to many more commercial buildings being built in the CBD.\n\nIn 1944, Accra's city planner Maxwell Fry devised a town plan, which was revised in 1958 by B.D.W. Treavallion and Alan Flood. Although the Fry/Trevallion plan was never followed through, it illustrated the British vision of how Accra should develop.\n\n==== Fry/Treavallion plan ====\nIn the Fry/Treavallion plan, a reorganisation of the CBD was called for, as well as the development of the coastal region of the city. To reorganise the CBD, the planners decided to superimpose a tight street grid north of Fort Ussher.\n\nTo the east of this newly organised CBD, the planners hoped to preserve a broad, open space for a restaurant, country club, and [[polo]] and [[cricket]] fields. Additionally, the British planners intended to build large numbers of public squares, fountains, and ornamental pools and statues throughout the city, as well as a vast Parliament Complex in the city centre. Lastly, the Fry/Treavallion plan included plans to make the coastal region an extension of the exclusive European neighbourhood of Victoriaborg, and to create a recreational preserve for the elite. However, the British Gold Coast ended before the Fry/Treavallion plan was enacted.\n\n==== Nkrumah Plan ====\nWhen [[Kwame Nkrumah]] became Ghana's first postindependence [[Prime Minister of Ghana|Prime Minister]] in 1957, he created his own plan for Accra's development.<ref>Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 5</ref> Instead of creating spaces to serve the elite, Nkrumah sought to create spaces to inspire pride and nationalism in his people and people throughout Africa.\n\nRather than creating ornamental fountains and a large Parliament complex, Nkrumah decided to build landmarks such as Independence Square, the State House, and the Organisation of African Unity building, and to refurbish Christianborg Castle. Nkrumah decided to leave the Atlantic coastal region undeveloped, so as to not detract attention from the Community Centre or Independence Square, lending both spaces symbolic significance. The Nkrumah plan did not emphasise order nearly as much as the Fry/Treavallion plan did; whereas the British plan strove to lessen crowding in the commercial district and help relieve the overcrowding of neighbourhoods bordering the CBD, the Nkrumah plan allowed for continued compression of commercial establishments into the CBD, as well as increased migration into Jamestown.\n\nThe modern city is centred on the original British, Danish, and Dutch forts and their surrounding communities: [[Jamestown, Ghana|Jamestown]] near the British [[James Fort]], [[Osu, Accra|Osu]] near the Danish fort of [[Fort Christiansborg|Christiansborg]] (now [[Osu Castle]]), and [[Jamestown/Usshertown, Accra|Ussherstown]] near the Dutch [[Ussher fort]].\n\nTourist attractions include the National Museum of Ghana, the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Archives of Ghana and Ghana's central library, the National Theatre, the Accra Centre for National Culture, and the [[Jamestown Lighthouse]].\n[[File:Black Star Square and Independence Arch, Accra, Ghana.jpg|thumb|Black star Square]]\n\nThe [[Parliament of Ghana|Parliament]], [[Supreme Court of Ghana]], [[Black Star Square]] and the [[Bank of Ghana]] are also located in Accra.\n\nThe city is also a transportation hub, home to the [[Kotoka International Airport]], and railway links to [[Tema]], [[Sekondi-Takoradi]] and [[Kumasi]].

The average annual rainfall is about 730&nbsp;mm, which falls primarily during Ghana's two rainy seasons. The chief rainy season begins in April and ends in mid-July, whilst a weaker second rainy season occurs in October. Rain usually falls in short intensive storms and causes local flooding in which drainage channels are obstructed.\n\nVery little variation in temperature occurs throughout the year. The mean monthly temperature ranges from {{convert|25.9|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} in August (the coolest) to {{convert|29.6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} in March (the hottest), with an annual average of {{convert|27.6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}. The \"cooler\" months tend to be more [[humid]] than the warmer months. As a result, during the warmer months and particularly during the windy [[harmattan]] season, the city experiences a breezy \"dry heat\" that feels less warm than the \"cooler\" but more humid rainy season.\n\nAs a coastal city, Accra is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and sea level rise, with population growth putting increasing pressure on the coastal areas.<ref>[http://cdkn.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FCFA_PolicyBrief_Accra-Maputo_WEB1.pdf Using climate information to achieve long-term development objectives in coastal Ghana and Mozambique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318210759/http://cdkn.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FCFA_PolicyBrief_Accra-Maputo_WEB1.pdf |date=18 March 2015 }}. [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]]. Retrieved 16 April 2015</ref> Drainage infrastructure is particularly at risk, which has profound implications for people's livelihoods, especially in informal settlements. Inadequate planning regulation and law enforcement, as well as perceived corruption in government processes, lack of communication across government departments and lack of concern or government co-ordination with respect to building codes are major impediments to progressing the development of Accra's drainage infrastructure, according to the [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]].<ref>[http://cdkn.org/future-climate-africa/  Future Climate for Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415220758/http://cdkn.org/future-climate-africa/ |date=15 April 2015 }}.

Relative humidity is generally high, varying from 65% in the midafternoon to 95% at night. The predominant wind direction in Accra is from the WSW to NNE sectors. Wind speeds normally range between 8 and 16&nbsp;km/h. High wind gusts occur with [[thunderstorm]]s, which generally pass in [[squalls]] along the coast.\n\nThe maximum wind speed record in Accra is 107.4&nbsp;km/h (58 knots). Strong winds associated with thunderstorm activity often cause damage to property by removing roofing material. Several areas of Accra experience microclimatic effects. Low-profile [[drainage basin]]s with a north\u2013south orientation are not as well ventilated as those oriented east\u2013west.\n\nAir is often trapped in pockets over the city, and an insulation effect can give rise to a local increase in air temperature of several degrees. This occurs most notably in the Accra Newtown sports complex areas.\n\n{{Weather box\n| location = Accra ([[Accra International Airport]]) 1961\u20131990, extremes 1936\u20131997\n| metric first = yes\n| single line = yes\n| Jan record high C = 35.8\n| Feb record high C = 37.1\n| Mar record high C = 36.2\n| Apr record high C = 35.0\n| May record high C = 34.6\n| Jun record high C = 31.5\n| Jul record high C = 32.3\n| Aug record high C = 32.8\n| Sep record high C = 33.9\n| Oct record high C = 33.6\n| Nov record high C = 38.0\n| Dec record high C = 36.0\n| year record high C = 38.0\n| Jan high C = 32.1\n| Feb high C = 32.7\n| Mar high C = 32.5\n| Apr high C = 32.2\n| May high C = 31.2\n| Jun high C = 29.3\n| Jul high C = 28.5\n| Aug high C = 28.0\n| Sep high C = 29.0\n| Oct high C = 30.5\n| Nov high C = 31.6\n| Dec high C = 31.7\n| year high C = 30.8\n| Jan mean C = 27.3\n| Feb mean C = 27.7\n| Mar mean C = 27.7\n| Apr mean C = 27.7\n| May mean C = 27.2\n| Jun mean C = 25.6\n| Jul mean C = 24.4\n| Aug mean C = 24.3\n| Sep mean C = 25.2\n| Oct mean C = 26.0\n| Nov mean C = 27.0\n| Dec mean C = 27.2\n| year mean C = 26.4\n| Jan low C = 23.4\n| Feb low C = 24.1\n| Mar low C = 24.1\n| Apr low C = 24.2\n| May low C = 23.9\n| Jun low C = 23.1\n| Jul low C = 22.5\n| Aug low C = 22.2\n| Sep low C = 22.4\n| Oct low C = 23.9\n| Nov low C = 23.5\n| Dec low C = 23.4\n| year low C = 23.4\n| Jan record low C = 15.0\n| Feb record low C = 16.7\n| Mar record low C = 18.9\n| Apr record low C = 19.4\n| May record low C = 18.6\n| Jun record low C = 17.8\n| Jul record low C = 17.8\n| Aug record low C = 17.2\n| Sep record low C = 18.3\n| Oct record low C = 19.4\n| Nov record low C = 17.8\n| Dec record low C = 16.7\n| year record low C = 15.0\n| precipitation colour = green\n| Jan precipitation mm = 10.9\n| Feb precipitation mm = 21.8\n| Mar precipitation mm = 57.1\n| Apr precipitation mm = 96.8\n| May precipitation mm = 131.2\n| Jun precipitation mm = 221.0\n| Jul precipitation mm = 66.0\n| Aug precipitation mm = 28.0\n| Sep precipitation mm = 67.8\n| Oct precipitation mm = 62.4\n| Nov precipitation mm = 27.7\n| Dec precipitation mm = 16.1\n| year precipitation mm = 806.8\n| Jan precipitation days = 1\n| Feb precipitation days = 2\n| Mar precipitation days = 5\n| Apr precipitation days = 6\n| May precipitation days = 10\n| Jun precipitation days = 15\n| Jul precipitation days = 9\n| Aug precipitation days = 7\n| Sep precipitation days = 8\n| Oct precipitation days = 7\n| Nov precipitation days = 3\n| Dec precipitation days = 2\n| year precipitation days = \n| Jan humidity = 77\n| Feb humidity = 78\n| Mar humidity = 79\n| Apr humidity = 80\n| May humidity = 81\n| Jun humidity = 85\n| Jul humidity = 84\n| Aug humidity = 83\n| Sep humidity = 81\n| Oct humidity = 82\n| Nov humidity = 80\n| Dec humidity = 80\n| year humidity = 81\n| Jan sun = 210.8\n| Feb sun = 206.2\n| Mar sun = 213.9\n| Apr sun = 219.0\n| May sun = 210.8\n| Jun sun = 141.0\n| Jul sun = 145.7\n| Aug sun = 155.0\n| Sep sun = 171.0\n| Oct sun = 226.3\n| Nov sun = 237.0\n| Dec sun = 241.8\n| year sun = \n| Jand sun = 6.8\n| Febd sun = 7.3\n| Mard sun = 6.9\n| Aprd sun = 7.3\n| Mayd sun = 6.8\n| Jund sun = 4.7\n| Juld sun = 4.7\n| Augd sun = 5.0\n| Sepd sun = 5.7\n| Octd sun = 7.3\n| Novd sun = 7.9\n| Decd sun = 7.8\n| yeard sun = 6.5\n| source 1 = [[World Meteorological Organization]] (average high, low and precipitation)<ref name=WMO>{{cite web |url=http://worldweather.wmo.int/en/city.html?cityId=921 |title=World Weather Information Service \u2013 Accra |publisher=World Meteorological Organization |accessdate=17 October 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018215614/http://worldweather.wmo.int/en/city.html?cityId=921 |archivedate=18 October 2016}}</ref>\n| source 2 = [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]] (extremes, humidity 1952\u20131967, mean temperature 1941\u20131994, and sun)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dwd.de/DWD/klima/beratung/ak/ak_654720_kt.pdf |title=Klimatafel von Accra (Int.

The area contains the \"37\" Military Hospital, [[The Flagstaff House]], several foreign [[embassy|embassies]], [[Achimota School]], Achimota Golf Park, and the [[University of Ghana]]'s Legon campus, which serves as Accra's northern boundary.\n\nGeographically, the areas north of Ring Road West and Central, east of Winneba/Graphic Road, west of Liberation Road, and the districts just north and south of the Kwame Nkrumah motorway are regarded as Northern Accra. Some areas North of Accra include, Ashongnman, Madina, Haatso, North and West Legon and others\n\n=== Accra East ===\nEastern Accra is largely residential and geographically north of Ring Road East, stretching as far north as Kwame Nkrumah Motorway; the district is bordered to the west by Liberation Road.\n\n=== Accra West ===\nWestern Accra is largely a residential and business area. Whilst geographically less expansive than the northern and eastern reaches of the city as a result of the large saltponds of Tettegu and Aplaku, it nonetheless boasts one of Accra's most important landmarks, the [[Korle Bu Teaching Hospital]].\n\nGeographically, the areas west of Ring Road West, extending as far west as the saltponds and south of Graphic Road, are considered Accra West.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ghanadistricts.com/districts/?r=1&_=3&rlv=climate |title=A repository of all districts in the republic of Ghana |publisher=Ghana Districts |accessdate=5 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711091832/http://ghanadistricts.com/districts/?r=1&_=3&rlv=climate |archivedate=11 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe period between 1960 and 1970 saw rapid industrialisation and expansion in Accra's manufacturing and commercial sectors. This contributed to high [[rural-urban migration]] to the city, and consequently a high population growth rate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ghanadistricts.com/districts/?r=1&_=3&sa=3004 |title=A repository of all districts in the republic of Ghana |publisher=Ghana Districts |accessdate=5 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711091853/http://ghanadistricts.com/districts/?r=1&_=3&sa=3004 |archivedate=11 July 2011}}</ref> The stagnation of the Ghanaian economy during the 1970s slowed the growth of Accra's population, as shown by the falling growth rate of the 1970\u20131984 intercensal years. Later, however, the decline in agriculture in rural communities in Ghana and rising industrialisation in urban regions, coupled with the late-1980s boom in the [[service sector]], once again propelled immigration to Accra. The primacy of the Accra Metropolitan Area as the Greater Accra region's administrative, educational, industrial and commercial centre continues to be the major force for its population growth, with immigration contributing to over 35% of the Accra's population growth.\n\n=== Distribution and density ===\nThe gross density of population for the Accra Metropolitan Area in 2000 was 10.03 persons per hectare, compared to 6.23 per hectare in 1970. The highest densities were recorded in the Accra Metropolitan Assembly, with an overall average of 69.3 persons per hectare. At the community level, densities exceeding 250 persons per hectare occurred mostly in the immigrant and depressed areas in the oldest parts of Accra, such as Accra New Town, Nima, Jamestown and Usshertown. In higher-income areas, densities ranged between 17.5 and 40 persons per hectare.\n\n=== Population distribution by age and gender ===\nAccra's population is a very youthful one, with 56% of the population being under 24 years of age. This predominance of young people is not expected to decline in the foreseeable future. Fifty-one percent (51%) of the population are females, and the remaining 49% males. This gives a males-to-females ratio of 1:1.04. The greater number of females is a reflection of the nationwide trend, where the estimated ratio of males to females is 1:1.03.\n\n=== Migration ===\nDecentralisation is expected to reduce the migration rates in Accra. An assessment of the extent of migration to Accra, based on present locality and gender, reveals that 45% of residents in Accra are African immigrants from countries across the African continent.\n\n=== Housing ===\nParts of Central Accra comprise a mixture of very low-density development with under-used service infrastructure on the one hand, high-density development and overstretched infrastructure services on the other. The growth of Accra has led to the neglect of some of the old settlements, whilst efforts are being made to provide the newly developing suburban areas with services and infrastructure to cater for the needs of the middle-income earners. Peripheral residential development in Accra barely has sufficient infrastructure to support it. There are also large numbers of uncompleted houses, interspersed with pockets of undeveloped land, which are often subject of litigation, due to the inability of organisations and individuals who own them to complete or develop them due to lack of funds. Housing can be grouped into three broad categories: the low-income, middle-income and high-income areas. The low-income housing areas comprise Osu, Jamestown, Adedenkpo, Chorkor, La, Teshie, Nungua, Sukura, Kwashieman, Odorkor, Bubiashie, Abeka, Nima, Maamobi and Chorkor. Altogether, these areas accommodate about 58% of Accra's total population. Most of Accra's informal businesses are located in low-income areas.\nAlmost all low-income areas are built up with little room for expansion. This is particularly so in the areas of the inner city. The middle-income areas of Accra are predominantly populated by Ghanaian citizens and business, administrative and professional families. Much of the housing in these areas has been provided by state, parastatal and private sector organisations and individuals. The middle-income areas include Dansoman Estates, North Kaneshie Estates, Asylum Down, Kanda Estates, Abelempke, Achimota, Adenta and Tesano. Usually, these areas, unlike the low-income areas, are planned developments, but are in need of infrastructure services. Building materials and general housing conditions are of better quality. The middle-income group comprises 32% of the city's population of which are Ghanaian citizens make up. The high-income areas provide housing for the remaining 10% of the population of which Ghanaian citizens also make up. They include areas like North Ridge and West Ridge, Ringway Estates, north Labone Estates, Airport Residential Area, Roman Ridge, East Legon.\nThese areas are all planned and have well developed infrastructure with spacious and landscaped ground in sharp contrast with, particularly, the low-income areas.

The word is sometimes rendered with the nasalised vowels as ''G\u00e3'' or ''G\u00e3g\u00e3''. Historian [[Carl Christian Reindorf]] confirmed this etymology, proposing a link between the martial qualities and migratory behaviour of the local ants and those of the Ga people. The link between the [[ethnonym]] and ants was explicitly reflected in the recognition of anthills as sacred places. Often ringed by sacred fences (''aklabatsa''), the tall red mounds dotting Accra's hinterland were seen as microcosms of human community and as nodal points between the known world and the world of the dead.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhile the Ga used the reference to the invasive species of dark-brown swarming ants to connote military prowess and their ancient conquest of [[Guang languages|Guang]] speakers residing in the Accra Plains, the Akan-speaking appropriation and translation of this metaphor had a less than generous meaning. Instead of viewing Ga speakers as a formidable military force, the Akan-speaking term \"''Nkran''\" cast Ga peoples as pests or nuisances to be controlled or exterminated.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6ZB2CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA30&dq=accra+nkran#v=onepage&q=accra%20nkran&f=false |title=Gold Coast Diasporas: Identity, Culture, and Power |last=Rucker |first=Walter C. |date=28 September 2015 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-01701-7 |location= |pages=30 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe name ''Ga'' is actually a cognate of the name ''Akan'', one of a few words in which {{IPA|[g]}} corresponds to {{IPA|[k]}} in Akan.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=erLnCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA113&dq=accra+akra#v=onepage&q=accra%20akra&f=false |title=Korle Meets the Sea: A Sociolinguistic History of Accra |last=Dakubu |first=Mary Esther Kropp |date=1 January 1997 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-506061-4 |location= |pages=113 |language=en}}</ref> ''Ga'' also gave its name to the [[Greater Accra Region#Districts|Ga districts]] surrounding Accra.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PEQgnFtkxmMC&pg=PA4&dq=accra+nkran#v=onepage&q=accra%20nkran&f=false |title=The City of Accra \u2013 A Pictorial Visit |last=Ntiamoah |first=Eric Maclean |date=1 January 2008 |publisher=AuthorHouse |isbn=978-1-4343-5860-8 |location= |pages=4 |language=en}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe spelling ''Accra'' was given to ''Nkran'' by [[Europeans]].<ref name=\":1\" /> An earlier spelling used by the [[Danish colonial empire|Danes]] was ''Akra.''<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tVJuQbQ0UgwC&pg=PA89&dq=accra+akra#v=onepage&q=accra%20akra&f=false |title=The Spiritual in the Secular: Missionaries and Knowledge about Africa |last=Harries |first=Patrick |last2=Maxwell |first2=David |date=20 July 2012 |publisher=Wm.

When the Guan ([[Larteh]]s) on the coast saw them on their canoes at sea, they looked like ants. Hence, the Lartehs refer to them as Nkran (ants). Nkran was later corrupted by the [[Danes]] to Akra, then to present-day Accra. ''Nkran'' in the [[Ga language]] is ''Gaga'', thus they also started calling themselves Ga. Due to their sheer numbers, the indigenous Lartehs thus relocated to the [[Akuapem Mountains|Akuapem]] ridge. The Ga are also part of the main Guan group that started the initial migration from the [[Nubian people|Nubia Empire]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.akuapem.com/gpage4.html |title=The Larteh Story |accessdate=6 July 2015 |publisher=Akuapem Organisation |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811010134/http://akuapem.com/gpage4.html |archivedate=11 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nInitially, Accra was not the most prominent trading centre; the trade hubs of the time were the ports at [[Ada, Ghana|Ada]] and [[Prampram]], along with the inland centres of [[Dodowa]] and [[Akuse]]. The Dutch built the nearby outposts of [[Ussher Fort]] while the British and the Swedes built James Fort and Christiansborg castles, respectively. By the 17th century, Portugal, France and Denmark, had constructed forts in the city.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nBritain gradually acquired the interests of all other countries beginning in 1851, when Denmark sold [[Fort Christiansborg|Christiansborg]] (which they had acquired from the Swedes) and their other forts to the British. The Netherlands was the last to sell out, in 1871. In 1873, after decades of tension between the British and [[Ashanti people|Ashantis]], the British attacked and virtually destroyed [[Kumasi]]. The British then captured Accra in 1874, and in 1877, at the end of the second [[Anglo-Asante Wars|Anglo-Asante War]], Accra replaced [[Cape Coast]] as the capital of the British [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]]. This decision was made because Accra had a drier climate relative to Cape Coast. Until this time, the settlement of Accra was confined between Ussher Fort to the east and the [[Korle Lagoon]] to the west.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.africanexecutive.com/modules/magazine/articles.php?article=994 |title=History of Accra |accessdate=22 July 2010 |publisher=The African Executive |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707101722/http://www.africanexecutive.com/modules/magazine/articles.php?article=994 |archivedate=7 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nAs the newly established Gold Coast's administrative functions were moved to Accra (1877), an influx of British colonial administrator and settlers grew around the Christiansborg (modern Osu, Ministries, Ridge, Labone, and Cantonments) began, and the city began to expand to accommodate the new residents. Victoriaborg was formed in the late 19th century as an exclusively European residential neighbourhood, located to the east of the city limits of the time. The boundaries of Accra were further stretched in 1908. This expansion entailed the creation of a native-only neighbourhood, intended to accommodate members of the native population as a means of relieving congestion problems in the overcrowded city centre. [[Adabraka]] was thus established to the north of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.macalester.edu/courses/geog261/eskidmore/history.htm |title=History of Accra |accessdate=17 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hauptstra\u00dfeAccra18851908 300dpi.jpg|thumb|right|A main street of central Accra sometime between 1885 and 1908]]\n\nOne of the most influential decisions in the history of the city was that of building the Accra-Kumasi railway in 1908. This was to connect Accra, the country's foremost port at that time, with Ghana's main [[cocoa bean|cocoa]]-producing regions. In 1923, the railway was completed, and by 1924, cocoa was Ghana's largest export.\n\nThe British Gold Coast heavily influenced the shape that Accra took during this period. For example, [[racial segregation]] of neighbourhoods was mandated by law until 1923, and all new buildings were required to be built out of stone or concrete. Despite these regulations, British settlers of the Gold Coast were very hesitant to invest any large amount of money into the city to maintain its infrastructure or improve public works. This did not change until the governorship of [[Gordon Guggisberg|Sir Frederick Gordon Guggisberg]] during which period the three separate settlements (Osu, La and Jamestown) merged to become modern Accra. Guggisberg's administration laid out the present grid networked neighborhoods of Tudu, Adabraka and Asylum Down.\n\nAmong the achievements of Guggisberg was the building of a bridge across the Korle Lagoon in 1923, which opened the land west of the lagoon for settlement. Guggisberg also oversaw the building of a major hospital (Korle-Bu) and secondary school (Achimota). Such improvements led to an increase in Accra's population due to the [[rural-urban migration|migration of rural dwellers]] into the city, and the immigration of increasing numbers of British businessmen and administrators.\n\n=== After World War II ===\n[[File:Jamestown lighthouse.jpg|thumb|upright|<center>[[Jamestown Lighthouse]] in [[Jamestown/Usshertown, Accra|Jamestown/Usshertown]]</center>]]\nIn the years following [[World War II]], the neighbourhoods of Ridge and Cantonments were planned as low-density developments for Europeans, while many rural migrants settled in neighbourhoods which had not yet been incorporated into Accra's municipal boundary, such as Nima and surrounding areas. Thus, the development of these neighbourhoods was unregulated by the government, creating a crowded and jumbled [[shanty-town]] landscape.\n\nAnother area of Accra that took shape at this time was the central business district (CBD). More administrative buildings were built on High Street, forming a massive judicial/administrative complex. Additionally, the expansion of the economy led to many more commercial buildings being built in the CBD.\n\nIn 1944, Accra's city planner Maxwell Fry devised a town plan, which was revised in 1958 by B.D.W. Treavallion and Alan Flood. Although the Fry/Trevallion plan was never followed through, it illustrated the British vision of how Accra should develop.\n\n==== Fry/Treavallion plan ====\nIn the Fry/Treavallion plan, a reorganisation of the CBD was called for, as well as the development of the coastal region of the city. To reorganise the CBD, the planners decided to superimpose a tight street grid north of Fort Ussher.\n\nTo the east of this newly organised CBD, the planners hoped to preserve a broad, open space for a restaurant, country club, and [[polo]] and [[cricket]] fields. Additionally, the British planners intended to build large numbers of public squares, fountains, and ornamental pools and statues throughout the city, as well as a vast Parliament Complex in the city centre. Lastly, the Fry/Treavallion plan included plans to make the coastal region an extension of the exclusive European neighbourhood of Victoriaborg, and to create a recreational preserve for the elite. However, the British Gold Coast ended before the Fry/Treavallion plan was enacted.\n\n==== Nkrumah Plan ====\nWhen [[Kwame Nkrumah]] became Ghana's first postindependence [[Prime Minister of Ghana|Prime Minister]] in 1957, he created his own plan for Accra's development.<ref>Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 5</ref> Instead of creating spaces to serve the elite, Nkrumah sought to create spaces to inspire pride and nationalism in his people and people throughout Africa.\n\nRather than creating ornamental fountains and a large Parliament complex, Nkrumah decided to build landmarks such as Independence Square, the State House, and the Organisation of African Unity building, and to refurbish Christianborg Castle. Nkrumah decided to leave the Atlantic coastal region undeveloped, so as to not detract attention from the Community Centre or Independence Square, lending both spaces symbolic significance. The Nkrumah plan did not emphasise order nearly as much as the Fry/Treavallion plan did; whereas the British plan strove to lessen crowding in the commercial district and help relieve the overcrowding of neighbourhoods bordering the CBD, the Nkrumah plan allowed for continued compression of commercial establishments into the CBD, as well as increased migration into Jamestown.\n\nThe modern city is centred on the original British, Danish, and Dutch forts and their surrounding communities: [[Jamestown, Ghana|Jamestown]] near the British [[James Fort]], [[Osu, Accra|Osu]] near the Danish fort of [[Fort Christiansborg|Christiansborg]] (now [[Osu Castle]]), and [[Jamestown/Usshertown, Accra|Ussherstown]] near the Dutch [[Ussher fort]].\n\nTourist attractions include the National Museum of Ghana, the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Archives of Ghana and Ghana's central library, the National Theatre, the Accra Centre for National Culture, and the [[Jamestown Lighthouse]].\n[[File:Black Star Square and Independence Arch, Accra, Ghana.jpg|thumb|Black star Square]]\n\nThe [[Parliament of Ghana|Parliament]], [[Supreme Court of Ghana]], [[Black Star Square]] and the [[Bank of Ghana]] are also located in Accra.\n\nThe city is also a transportation hub, home to the [[Kotoka International Airport]], and railway links to [[Tema]], [[Sekondi-Takoradi]] and [[Kumasi]].

The average annual rainfall is about 730&nbsp;mm, which falls primarily during Ghana's two rainy seasons. The chief rainy season begins in April and ends in mid-July, whilst a weaker second rainy season occurs in October. Rain usually falls in short intensive storms and causes local flooding in which drainage channels are obstructed.\n\nVery little variation in temperature occurs throughout the year. The mean monthly temperature ranges from {{convert|25.9|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} in August (the coolest) to {{convert|29.6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} in March (the hottest), with an annual average of {{convert|27.6|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}. The \"cooler\" months tend to be more [[humid]] than the warmer months. As a result, during the warmer months and particularly during the windy [[harmattan]] season, the city experiences a breezy \"dry heat\" that feels less warm than the \"cooler\" but more humid rainy season.\n\nAs a coastal city, Accra is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and sea level rise, with population growth putting increasing pressure on the coastal areas.<ref>[http://cdkn.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FCFA_PolicyBrief_Accra-Maputo_WEB1.pdf Using climate information to achieve long-term development objectives in coastal Ghana and Mozambique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318210759/http://cdkn.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FCFA_PolicyBrief_Accra-Maputo_WEB1.pdf |date=18 March 2015 }}. [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]]. Retrieved 16 April 2015</ref> Drainage infrastructure is particularly at risk, which has profound implications for people's livelihoods, especially in informal settlements. Inadequate planning regulation and law enforcement, as well as perceived corruption in government processes, lack of communication across government departments and lack of concern or government co-ordination with respect to building codes are major impediments to progressing the development of Accra's drainage infrastructure, according to the [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]].<ref>[http://cdkn.org/future-climate-africa/  Future Climate for Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415220758/http://cdkn.org/future-climate-africa/ |date=15 April 2015 }}.

Relative humidity is generally high, varying from 65% in the midafternoon to 95% at night. The predominant wind direction in Accra is from the WSW to NNE sectors. Wind speeds normally range between 8 and 16&nbsp;km/h. High wind gusts occur with [[thunderstorm]]s, which generally pass in [[squalls]] along the coast.\n\nThe maximum wind speed record in Accra is 107.4&nbsp;km/h (58 knots). Strong winds associated with thunderstorm activity often cause damage to property by removing roofing material. Several areas of Accra experience microclimatic effects. Low-profile [[drainage basin]]s with a north\u2013south orientation are not as well ventilated as those oriented east\u2013west.\n\nAir is often trapped in pockets over the city, and an insulation effect can give rise to a local increase in air temperature of several degrees. This occurs most notably in the Accra Newtown sports complex areas.\n\n{{Weather box\n| location = Accra ([[Accra International Airport]]) 1961\u20131990, extremes 1936\u20131997\n| metric first = yes\n| single line = yes\n| Jan record high C = 35.8\n| Feb record high C = 37.1\n| Mar record high C = 36.2\n| Apr record high C = 35.0\n| May record high C = 34.6\n| Jun record high C = 31.5\n| Jul record high C = 32.3\n| Aug record high C = 32.8\n| Sep record high C = 33.9\n| Oct record high C = 33.6\n| Nov record high C = 38.0\n| Dec record high C = 36.0\n| year record high C = 38.0\n| Jan high C = 32.1\n| Feb high C = 32.7\n| Mar high C = 32.5\n| Apr high C = 32.2\n| May high C = 31.2\n| Jun high C = 29.3\n| Jul high C = 28.5\n| Aug high C = 28.0\n| Sep high C = 29.0\n| Oct high C = 30.5\n| Nov high C = 31.6\n| Dec high C = 31.7\n| year high C = 30.8\n| Jan mean C = 27.3\n| Feb mean C = 27.7\n| Mar mean C = 27.7\n| Apr mean C = 27.7\n| May mean C = 27.2\n| Jun mean C = 25.6\n| Jul mean C = 24.4\n| Aug mean C = 24.3\n| Sep mean C = 25.2\n| Oct mean C = 26.0\n| Nov mean C = 27.0\n| Dec mean C = 27.2\n| year mean C = 26.4\n| Jan low C = 23.4\n| Feb low C = 24.1\n| Mar low C = 24.1\n| Apr low C = 24.2\n| May low C = 23.9\n| Jun low C = 23.1\n| Jul low C = 22.5\n| Aug low C = 22.2\n| Sep low C = 22.4\n| Oct low C = 23.9\n| Nov low C = 23.5\n| Dec low C = 23.4\n| year low C = 23.4\n| Jan record low C = 15.0\n| Feb record low C = 16.7\n| Mar record low C = 18.9\n| Apr record low C = 19.4\n| May record low C = 18.6\n| Jun record low C = 17.8\n| Jul record low C = 17.8\n| Aug record low C = 17.2\n| Sep record low C = 18.3\n| Oct record low C = 19.4\n| Nov record low C = 17.8\n| Dec record low C = 16.7\n| year record low C = 15.0\n| precipitation colour = green\n| Jan precipitation mm = 10.9\n| Feb precipitation mm = 21.8\n| Mar precipitation mm = 57.1\n| Apr precipitation mm = 96.8\n| May precipitation mm = 131.2\n| Jun precipitation mm = 221.0\n| Jul precipitation mm = 66.0\n| Aug precipitation mm = 28.0\n| Sep precipitation mm = 67.8\n| Oct precipitation mm = 62.4\n| Nov precipitation mm = 27.7\n| Dec precipitation mm = 16.1\n| year precipitation mm = 806.8\n| Jan precipitation days = 1\n| Feb precipitation days = 2\n| Mar precipitation days = 5\n| Apr precipitation days = 6\n| May precipitation days = 10\n| Jun precipitation days = 15\n| Jul precipitation days = 9\n| Aug precipitation days = 7\n| Sep precipitation days = 8\n| Oct precipitation days = 7\n| Nov precipitation days = 3\n| Dec precipitation days = 2\n| year precipitation days = \n| Jan humidity = 77\n| Feb humidity = 78\n| Mar humidity = 79\n| Apr humidity = 80\n| May humidity = 81\n| Jun humidity = 85\n| Jul humidity = 84\n| Aug humidity = 83\n| Sep humidity = 81\n| Oct humidity = 82\n| Nov humidity = 80\n| Dec humidity = 80\n| year humidity = 81\n| Jan sun = 210.8\n| Feb sun = 206.2\n| Mar sun = 213.9\n| Apr sun = 219.0\n| May sun = 210.8\n| Jun sun = 141.0\n| Jul sun = 145.7\n| Aug sun = 155.0\n| Sep sun = 171.0\n| Oct sun = 226.3\n| Nov sun = 237.0\n| Dec sun = 241.8\n| year sun = \n| Jand sun = 6.8\n| Febd sun = 7.3\n| Mard sun = 6.9\n| Aprd sun = 7.3\n| Mayd sun = 6.8\n| Jund sun = 4.7\n| Juld sun = 4.7\n| Augd sun = 5.0\n| Sepd sun = 5.7\n| Octd sun = 7.3\n| Novd sun = 7.9\n| Decd sun = 7.8\n| yeard sun = 6.5\n| source 1 = [[World Meteorological Organization]] (average high, low and precipitation)<ref name=WMO>{{cite web |url=http://worldweather.wmo.int/en/city.html?cityId=921 |title=World Weather Information Service \u2013 Accra |publisher=World Meteorological Organization |accessdate=17 October 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018215614/http://worldweather.wmo.int/en/city.html?cityId=921 |archivedate=18 October 2016}}</ref>\n| source 2 = [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]] (extremes, humidity 1952\u20131967, mean temperature 1941\u20131994, and sun)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dwd.de/DWD/klima/beratung/ak/ak_654720_kt.pdf |title=Klimatafel von Accra (Int.

The area contains the \"37\" Military Hospital, [[The Flagstaff House]], several foreign [[embassy|embassies]], [[Achimota School]], Achimota Golf Park, and the [[University of Ghana]]'s Legon campus, which serves as Accra's northern boundary.\n\nGeographically, the areas north of Ring Road West and Central, east of Winneba/Graphic Road, west of Liberation Road, and the districts just north and south of the Kwame Nkrumah motorway are regarded as Northern Accra.

This contributed to high [[rural-urban migration]] to the city, and consequently a high population growth rate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ghanadistricts.com/districts/?r=1&_=3&sa=3004 |title=A repository of all districts in the republic of Ghana |publisher=Ghana Districts |accessdate=5 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711091853/http://ghanadistricts.com/districts/?r=1&_=3&sa=3004 |archivedate=11 July 2011}}</ref> The stagnation of the Ghanaian economy during the 1970s slowed the growth of Accra's population, as shown by the falling growth rate of the 1970\u20131984 intercensal years. Later, however, the decline in agriculture in rural communities in Ghana and rising industrialisation in urban regions, coupled with the late-1980s boom in the [[service sector]], once again propelled immigration to Accra. The primacy of the Accra Metropolitan Area as the Greater Accra region's administrative, educational, industrial and commercial centre continues to be the major force for its population growth, with immigration contributing to over 35% of the Accra's population growth.\n\n=== Distribution and density ===\nThe gross density of population for the Accra Metropolitan Area in 2000 was 10.03 persons per hectare, compared to 6.23 per hectare in 1970. The highest densities were recorded in the Accra Metropolitan Assembly, with an overall average of 69.3 persons per hectare. At the community level, densities exceeding 250 persons per hectare occurred mostly in the immigrant and depressed areas in the oldest parts of Accra, such as Accra New Town, Nima, Jamestown and Usshertown. In higher-income areas, densities ranged between 17.5 and 40 persons per hectare.\n\n=== Population distribution by age and gender ===\nAccra's population is a very youthful one, with 56% of the population being under 24 years of age. This predominance of young people is not expected to decline in the foreseeable future. Fifty-one percent (51%) of the population are females, and the remaining 49% males. This gives a males-to-females ratio of 1:1.04. The greater number of females is a reflection of the nationwide trend, where the estimated ratio of males to females is 1:1.03.\n\n=== Migration ===\nDecentralisation is expected to reduce the migration rates in Accra. An assessment of the extent of migration to Accra, based on present locality and gender, reveals that 45% of residents in Accra are African immigrants from countries across the African continent.\n\n=== Housing ===\nParts of Central Accra comprise a mixture of very low-density development with under-used service infrastructure on the one hand, high-density development and overstretched infrastructure services on the other. The growth of Accra has led to the neglect of some of the old settlements, whilst efforts are being made to provide the newly developing suburban areas with services and infrastructure to cater for the needs of the middle-income earners. Peripheral residential development in Accra barely has sufficient infrastructure to support it. There are also large numbers of uncompleted houses, interspersed with pockets of undeveloped land, which are often subject of litigation, due to the inability of organisations and individuals who own them to complete or develop them due to lack of funds. Housing can be grouped into three broad categories: the low-income, middle-income and high-income areas. The low-income housing areas comprise Osu, Jamestown, Adedenkpo, Chorkor, La, Teshie, Nungua, Sukura, Kwashieman, Odorkor, Bubiashie, Abeka, Nima, Maamobi and Chorkor. Altogether, these areas accommodate about 58% of Accra's total population. Most of Accra's informal businesses are located in low-income areas.\nAlmost all low-income areas are built up with little room for expansion. This is particularly so in the areas of the inner city. The middle-income areas of Accra are predominantly populated by Ghanaian citizens and business, administrative and professional families. Much of the housing in these areas has been provided by state, parastatal and private sector organisations and individuals. The middle-income areas include Dansoman Estates, North Kaneshie Estates, Asylum Down, Kanda Estates, Abelempke, Achimota, Adenta and Tesano. Usually, these areas, unlike the low-income areas, are planned developments, but are in need of infrastructure services. Building materials and general housing conditions are of better quality. The middle-income group comprises 32% of the city's population of which are Ghanaian citizens make up.

It was Europe's sixth victory in the last eight contests and their fourth consecutive home win. The event was plagued by bad weather with play having to be suspended twice. Having taken a 3-point lead into the singles matches Europe faced a U.S. fightback and the conclusion of the Ryder Cup 2010 went right down to the anchor match between [[Graeme McDowell]] and [[Hunter Mahan]].

The original schedule in 2010 was:\n\n*'''Day 1''' (Friday) \u2013 4 [[Four-ball golf|four-ball]] (better ball) matches in a morning session and 4 [[Foursome (golf)|foursome]] (alternate shot) matches in an afternoon session\n*'''Day 2''' (Saturday) \u2013 4 four-ball matches in a morning session and 4 foursome matches in an afternoon session\n*'''Day 3''' (Sunday) \u2013 12 singles matches\n\nWith a total of 28 points, 14\u00bd points are required to win the Cup, and 14 points are required for the defending champion to retain the Cup.  All matches were played to a maximum of 18 holes.\n\nIt was the second time in succession that the schedule for four-ball (better ball) and foursome (alternate shot) matches on Day One and Day Two has been changed, i.e. it was scheduled to be effectively the same timetable as was used in [[2006 Ryder Cup|2006]].\n\n==Revised format==\n\nAs a result of the long suspension of play on the first day due to heavy rain, the format for the rest of the competition was changed to try to bring a conclusion to the matches on Sunday. However, further heavy rain caused a delayed start on Sunday, so that the last of the revised sessions would be played on Monday. Because of the changes, there were a number of Ryder Cup firsts. For the first time in the history of the Ryder Cup, all 24 players took part in pairing sessions at the same time in six pairings (as opposed to the usual four pairings) and in another first for the event both foursome and four-ball matches were played in the same session at the same time. It is also the first time that the competition went into a fourth day. The revised schedule consisted of four sessions as opposed to the usual five.<ref>[http://www.rydercup.com/2010/usa/news/play-order-100110.cfm Rain delay prompts change in play order] Ryder Cup, {{Nowrap|1 October}} 2010</ref>\n \n*'''Session One''' (Friday and Saturday) \u2013 4 four-ball (better ball) matches\n*'''Session Two''' (Saturday) \u2013 6 foursome (alternate shot) matches\n*'''Session Three''' (Saturday and Sunday) \u2013 2 foursome and 4 four-ball matches\n*'''Session Four''' (Monday) \u2013 12 singles matches\n\nThe total number of each type of match remained the same, 8 four-ball, 8 foursomes, and 12 singles. By captains' agreement, matches would conclude at sundown Monday if not completed before then. Any matches still in progress would be considered halved at that point.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/rydercup10/news/story?id=5637200 Ryder Cup condensed to four sessions] ESPN Golf, {{Nowrap|1 October}} 2010</ref>\n\n==Television==\nThe matches were covered live domestically on [[Sky Sports]] with daily highlights shown on the [[BBC]].\n\nAll matches were covered live in the United States, a first for a Ryder Cup in Europe.

[[Scott Van Pelt]] and [[Tom Weiskopf]] handled recaps during coverage. Most of ESPN's coverage was rained out on Friday, with a 7-hour rain delay during the middle of the day. [[Golf Channel on NBC|NBC Sports]] covered the weekend action, with [[Dan Hicks (sportscaster)|Dan Hicks]] and [[Johnny Miller]] hosting from the 18th tower, [[Gary Koch]] calling holes, and on-course reporters [[Mark Rolfing]], [[Roger Maltbie]], and [[Dottie Pepper]].

The original schedule in 2010 was:\n\n*'''Day 1''' (Friday) \u2013 4 [[Four-ball golf|four-ball]] (better ball) matches in a morning session and 4 [[Foursome (golf)|foursome]] (alternate shot) matches in an afternoon session\n*'''Day 2''' (Saturday) \u2013 4 four-ball matches in a morning session and 4 foursome matches in an afternoon session\n*'''Day 3''' (Sunday) \u2013 12 singles matches\n\nWith a total of 28 points, 14\u00bd points are required to win the Cup, and 14 points are required for the defending champion to retain the Cup.  All matches were played to a maximum of 18 holes.\n\nIt was the second time in succession that the schedule for four-ball (better ball) and foursome (alternate shot) matches on Day One and Day Two has been changed, i.e. it was scheduled to be effectively the same timetable as was used in [[2006 Ryder Cup|2006]].\n\n==Revised format==\n\nAs a result of the long suspension of play on the first day due to heavy rain, the format for the rest of the competition was changed to try to bring a conclusion to the matches on Sunday. However, further heavy rain caused a delayed start on Sunday, so that the last of the revised sessions would be played on Monday. Because of the changes, there were a number of Ryder Cup firsts. For the first time in the history of the Ryder Cup, all 24 players took part in pairing sessions at the same time in six pairings (as opposed to the usual four pairings) and in another first for the event both foursome and four-ball matches were played in the same session at the same time. It is also the first time that the competition went into a fourth day. The revised schedule consisted of four sessions as opposed to the usual five.<ref>[http://www.rydercup.com/2010/usa/news/play-order-100110.cfm Rain delay prompts change in play order] Ryder Cup, {{Nowrap|1 October}} 2010</ref>\n \n*'''Session One''' (Friday and Saturday) \u2013 4 four-ball (better ball) matches\n*'''Session Two''' (Saturday) \u2013 6 foursome (alternate shot) matches\n*'''Session Three''' (Saturday and Sunday) \u2013 2 foursome and 4 four-ball matches\n*'''Session Four''' (Monday) \u2013 12 singles matches\n\nThe total number of each type of match remained the same, 8 four-ball, 8 foursomes, and 12 singles. By captains' agreement, matches would conclude at sundown Monday if not completed before then. Any matches still in progress would be considered halved at that point.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/rydercup10/news/story?id=5637200 Ryder Cup condensed to four sessions] ESPN Golf, {{Nowrap|1 October}} 2010</ref>\n\n==Television==\nThe matches were covered live domestically on [[Sky Sports]] with daily highlights shown on the [[BBC]].\n\nAll matches were covered live in the United States, a first for a Ryder Cup in Europe.
