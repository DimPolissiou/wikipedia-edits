The series, spawned from a pilot episode entitled \"Missing Persons\" aired by [[ITV (network)|ITV]] in 1989, was co-created by writers [[David Cook (writer)|David Cook]] and [[John Griffith Bowen|John Bowen]], co-starred [[Derek Benfield]] as Hetty's patient husband Robert, and [[Dominic Monaghan]] as her assistant and lodger Geoffrey Shawcross.\n\nOther co-stars in the series include [[John Graham Davies]] as local chief of police DCI Adams; [[Suzanne Maddock]] as Janet Frazer, a feisty young auto mechanic; and [[Frank Mills (British actor)|Frank Mills]] as Robert's brother Frank. In the [[United States]], episodes have broadcast as part of [[PBS]]'s anthology series ''[[Mystery!]]''. A parody of the series, entitled ''Wetty Hainthropp Investigates'', aired on 12 March 1999 as part of the [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] telethon. It starred [[Victoria Wood]], [[Julie Walters]] and [[Duncan Preston]].\n\n==Production==\n''Hetty Wainthropp Investigates'' is based on characters from the novel ''Missing Persons'' (1986) by [[David Cook (writer)|David Cook]], who co-wrote the episodes with [[John Griffith Bowen|John Bowen]]. The incidents in Cook's novel were inspired by his own mother's experiences. Prior to the pilot going into production, Patricia Routledge read the story ''Missing Persons'' for BBC Radio 4's ''A Book At Bedtime'' in February 1987.<ref>http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/e6865cdcb690483fa9fa2c608b3f467a</ref>\n\nIn [[1989 in television|1989]] [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] broadcast a feature-length pilot, ''Missing Persons'', featuring [[Tony Melody]] as Robert Wainthropp and Garry Halliday as Geoffrey Shawcross, but ITV opted not to pursue a series. The storyline of this episode is ignored in the subsequent BBC series, with the first episode establishing Hetty as a detective in her first case and meeting Geoffrey for the first time. The characterization of Hetty was altered considerably for the series from the pilot. The 'original' Hetty was blonde and far more 'theatrical' in her manner. Additionally, the pilot character lived in considerably better circumstances than the home seen in the series.\n\nThe BBC series was filmed primarily in [[Burnley]], [[Darwen]], [[Blackburn]], [[Rossendale]], [[Bolton]] and other locations in [[Lancashire]].\n\nThe music for the series was composed by [[Nigel Hess]], the cornet solo was performed by Phillip McCann and in 1997 the title track was awarded the [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Award]] for best television theme.\n\nThe BBC series was popular with viewers, but no further episodes were commissioned after 1998. In 2008 Patricia Routledge said in an interview that the cast and crew had been told by the BBC at the end of the fourth series that a fifth series would be commissioned, but it never was.<ref>Martin, Nicole. \"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/2201067/Actress-Patricia-Routledge-attacks-BBC-for-dropping-detective-series.html Actress Patricia Routledge Attacks BBC for Dropping Detective Series]\", ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 26 June 2008. Retrieved on 27 June 2008.</ref> In 2017 [[Suzanne Maddock]] shared her memories of making ''Hetty Wainthropp Investigates'' in a 45-minute interview for \"The Bill Podcast\" and explained how she felt disappointed for the fans of the series that they did not get to see a proper conclusion to the series.<ref>https://soundcloud.com/thebillpodcast/06-suzanne-maddock</ref>\n\n==Synopsis== \nHetty Wainthropp is a retired working-class woman from [[Darwen]] in North West England, who has a knack for jumping to conclusions and solving crimes of varying bafflement which often are too minor to concern the police. Although on occasion her husband offers assistance, he more often than not tends to the home while Hetty gads about the countryside with young Geoffrey in search of resolution and justice. In many episodes Hetty seeks the help and advice of [[Detective Chief Inspector#United Kingdom|DCI]] Adams of the local [[constabulary]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patricia Routledge]] as Henrietta \"Hetty\" Wainthropp\n* [[Derek Benfield]] as Robert Wainthropp\n* [[Dominic Monaghan]] as Geoffrey Shawcross\n* [[John Graham Davies]] as DCI Adams\n* [[Suzanne Maddock]] as Janet Frazer\n* [[Frank Mills (British actor)|Frank Mills]] as Frank Wainthropp\n\n==Episodes==\n===Pilot (1989)===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainroweaders\" style=\"width: 100%; margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background: #20B2AA; color: #000000;\"| No.\n! style=\"background: #20B2AA; color: #000000;\"| Title\n! style=\"background: #20B2AA; color: #000000;\"| Directed by\n! style=\"background: #20B2AA; color: #000000;\"| Written by\n! style=\"background: #20B2AA; color: #000000;\"| Original air date\n|-\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |Title           = Missing Persons\n |DirectedBy      = Derek Bennett\n |WrittenBy       = David Cook\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1989|5|30|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = During a visit to childhood friend Edith, retired housewife Hetty Wainthropp discovers that her husband, Frank, has a son by a previous marriage.

The series, spawned from a pilot episode entitled \"Missing Persons\" aired by [[ITV (network)|ITV]] in 1989, was co-created by writers [[David Cook (writer)|David Cook]] and [[John Griffith Bowen|John Bowen]], co-starred [[Derek Benfield]] as Hetty's patient husband Robert, and [[Dominic Monaghan]] as her assistant and lodger Geoffrey Shawcross.\n\nOther co-stars in the series include [[John Graham Davies]] as local chief of police DCI Adams; [[Suzanne Maddock]] as Janet Frazer, a feisty young auto mechanic; and [[Frank Mills (British actor)|Frank Mills]] as Robert's brother Frank. In the [[United States]], episodes have broadcast as part of [[PBS]]'s anthology series ''[[Mystery!]]''. A parody of the series, entitled ''Wetty Hainthropp Investigates'', aired on 12 March 1999 as part of the [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] telethon. It starred [[Victoria Wood]], [[Julie Walters]] and [[Duncan Preston]].\n\n==Production==\n''Hetty Wainthropp Investigates'' is based on characters from the novel ''Missing Persons'' (1986) by [[David Cook (writer)|David Cook]], who co-wrote the episodes with [[John Griffith Bowen]]. The incidents in Cook's novel were inspired by his own mother's experiences. Prior to the pilot going into production, Patricia Routledge read the story ''Missing Persons'' for BBC Radio 4's ''A Book At Bedtime'' in February 1987.<ref>http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/e6865cdcb690483fa9fa2c608b3f467a</ref>\n\nIn [[1989 in television|1989]] [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] broadcast a feature-length pilot, ''Missing Persons'', featuring [[Tony Melody]] as Robert Wainthropp and Garry Halliday as Geoffrey Shawcross, but ITV opted not to pursue a series. The storyline of this episode is ignored in the subsequent BBC series, with the first episode establishing Hetty as a detective in her first case and meeting Geoffrey for the first time. The characterization of Hetty was altered considerably for the series from the pilot. The 'original' Hetty was blonde and far more 'theatrical' in her manner. Additionally, the pilot character lived in considerably better circumstances than the home seen in the series.\n\nThe BBC series was filmed primarily in [[Burnley]], [[Darwen]], [[Blackburn]], [[Rossendale]], [[Bolton]] and other locations in [[Lancashire]].\n\nThe music for the series was composed by [[Nigel Hess]], the cornet solo was performed by Phillip McCann and in 1997 the title track was awarded the [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Award]] for best television theme.\n\nThe BBC series was popular with viewers, but no further episodes were commissioned after 1998. In 2008 Patricia Routledge said in an interview that the cast and crew had been told by the BBC at the end of the fourth series that a fifth series would be commissioned, but it never was.<ref>Martin, Nicole. \"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/2201067/Actress-Patricia-Routledge-attacks-BBC-for-dropping-detective-series.html Actress Patricia Routledge Attacks BBC for Dropping Detective Series]\", ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 26 June 2008. Retrieved on 27 June 2008.</ref> In 2017 [[Suzanne Maddock]] shared her memories of making ''Hetty Wainthropp Investigates'' in a 45-minute interview for \"The Bill Podcast\" and explained how she felt disappointed for the fans of the series that they did not get to see a proper conclusion to the series.<ref>https://soundcloud.com/thebillpodcast/06-suzanne-maddock</ref>\n\n==Synopsis== \nHetty Wainthropp is a retired working-class woman from [[Darwen]] in North West England, who has a knack for jumping to conclusions and solving crimes of varying bafflement which often are too minor to concern the police. Although on occasion her husband offers assistance, he more often than not tends to the home while Hetty gads about the countryside with young Geoffrey in search of resolution and justice. In many episodes Hetty seeks the help and advice of [[Detective Chief Inspector#United Kingdom|DCI]] Adams of the local [[constabulary]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patricia Routledge]] as Henrietta \"Hetty\" Wainthropp\n* [[Derek Benfield]] as Robert Wainthropp\n* [[Dominic Monaghan]] as Geoffrey Shawcross\n* [[John Graham Davies]] as DCI Adams\n* [[Suzanne Maddock]] as Janet Frazer\n* [[Frank Mills (British actor)|Frank Mills]] as Frank Wainthropp\n\n==Episodes==\n===Pilot (1989)===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainroweaders\" style=\"width: 100%; margin-right: 0;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background: #20B2AA; color: #000000;\"| No.\n! style=\"background: #20B2AA; color: #000000;\"| Title\n! style=\"background: #20B2AA; color: #000000;\"| Directed by\n! style=\"background: #20B2AA; color: #000000;\"| Written by\n! style=\"background: #20B2AA; color: #000000;\"| Original air date\n|-\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |Title           = Missing Persons\n |DirectedBy      = Derek Bennett\n |WrittenBy       = David Cook\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1989|5|30|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary    = During a visit to childhood friend Edith, retired housewife Hetty Wainthropp discovers that her husband, Frank, has a son by a previous marriage.

At each round of voting, the venue with the fewest votes is out and there is an additional vote between the remaining venues.\n\n== Theme, vision, and goals ==\n\n===Theme===\n'''The Living Ocean and Coast:'''  ''Diversity of Resources and Sustainable Development''\n\n====Background of theme====\n*The Expo theme aimed to help shed light on humankind's knowledge and advancement of technology concerning the ocean and coast and identify ways to resolve challenges facing the ocean.<ref name=\"press view\"/> Since the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] went into effect in 1993, the ocean has emerged as an important element in resolving various problems humankind faces, including those related to resources, food, space and the environment. However, industrial activities have damaged the marine ecosystem and subsequently reduced fish stocks. As a result, the ocean faces severe crisis. A damaged marine ecosystem, global warming and natural disasters are not limited to a certain country or region, but are issues that have global implications.\n\n==== Subthemes ====\n\nThe theme, \u201cThe Living Ocean and Coast,\u201d was divided into three sub-themes: ''Development and Preservation of the Ocean and Coast'', ''New Resources Technology'', and ''Creative Marine Activities''. These sub-themes have been further developed into 6 thematic groups, namely, Climate & Environment, Marine Life, Marine Industry & Technology, Marine City and Marine Civilization, and Marine Arts, each of which are {{Update after|2012|08|12}} demonstrated in their respective sub-theme pavilions.\n\n'''Development and Preservation of the Ocean and Coast''' aimed to inspire a new level of cooperation in the international community so as to combat climate change and create a paradigm where development and preservation find a better balance. The last few decades have witnessed environmental degradation caused by use and development of natural resources by humankind. Our economies and societies must break away from their current fossil fuel-based economies to minimize damage to both people and the environment. The sub theme argued that individuals, businesses, countries and the global community must realize that marine resources are limited and should not be subject to careless use, but that they are the fundamentals for the sound development of our future society, and people and ecosystems must be considered on the same level.\n\n'''New Resources Technology''' illustrated the progress and future prospects of marine technology, a new growth driver for the advancement of humankind. Countries are becoming more competitive in marine-related industries and are developing new technologies to address issues related to resources and the changing environment. The discreet use of resources, which strikes a balance between development and preservation, is only possible if based on advanced marine science and technology. Fostering marine industries will create added value and generate new jobs to transform sluggish industries into low cost, high efficiency structures.\n\n'''Creative Maritime Activities''' aimed to demonstrate the relationship between the oceans and humankind through culture and art and promote the new ideals of the seatizen and seavilization. A mix of play and experience (edutainment) aimed to trigger the imagination and curiosity of attendees towards an unknown world and to inspire children to learn to love and appreciate the oceans. A wide collection of marine-related culture and arts, including poetry, novels, films, operas, musicals, plays and music were shown at the Yeosu Expo.\n\n== Primary content ==\n\n===Korean Pavilion===\nThe Korean Pavilion was designed to convey the theme of Expo 2012 Yeosu Korea, whilst also emphasizing Korea's vision and role.\n<br />\nThe exhibition hall was adorned with traditional Korean constructions and colors. The event organizers have also stated that a diverse selection of official events and \"event corners\",{{elucidate|date=June 2012}} representing Korean culture, will be prepared for the international occasion.\n<br />\nAn exhibition that has been highlighted in the lead-up to the event was one that will feature the most notable achievements in Korean [[shipbuilding]], marine transportation, marine products, [[marine technology]], and marine safety. These achievements are shown in two exhibition halls.<ref name=\"KP\">{{cite web|title=Korea Pavilion|url=http://eng.expo2012.kr/is/ps/unitybbs/bbs/selectBbsDetail.html?ispsBbsId=BBS026&ispsNttId=0000036206|publisher=EXPO 2012 YEOSU KOREA|accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe first exhibition hall ''Sea of Miracles'' focused on Korea's past ocean adventures.<ref name=\"KP\" /> and was divided into three acts:<ref name=\"KP\" /> ''Experiencing Korea's Seas'', ''Discovering Korea's Maritime Spirit'' and ''- Realizing Korea's Maritime Capacity''.\n\nThe second hall 2 ''Sea of Hope'' portrayed Korea's potential future role in maritime era<ref name=\"KP\" /> and included the world's largest dome screen.<ref name=\"KP\" />\n\n===International Pavilions===\n\nIt was anticipated that the International Pavilions section will occupy the exhibition space's largest physical area. This section of the Expo provided an opportunity for participating countries to plan and hold their exhibitions. Themed quarters were displayed in the International Pavilions exhibition, consisting of the \"Sea of Life\", \"Sea of Exchange\", \"Sea of Peace\", and \"Sea of Land\". There were total of four buildings (A, B, C, and D) each with several exhibition rooms for participating countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=\uad6d\uc81c\uad00 (International Pavilions)|url=http://www.expo2012.kr/is/ps/unitybbs/bbs/selectBbsDetail.html?ispsBbsId=BBS001&ispsNttId=0000028196|publisher=EXPO 2012 YEOSU KOREA|accessdate=12 October 2012|language=korean}}</ref>\n\n{|| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 0.5em 0.5em 0.5em 1em;

In the tradition of previous expos (Zaragoza Expo's \u201cWater\u201d, Lisbon Expo's \u201cSea\u201d, and \u201cFuture heritage\u201d), the organizers of Expo 2012 Yeosu Korea have expressed an intention to innovate and progress beyond the concepts of the event's history.\n\n===Aquarium, the Marine Life Pavilion===\nBased upon the notion that marine life is the source of all life, the exhibition sought to present the diversity of the earth's marine resources, as well as the viability of their continuous use and development by humankind.\nVisitors observe{{Update after|2012|08|12}} the sea as a \"treasure house\" of [[biodiversity]] and, by highlighting our mutual relationship with the sea, the importance of preserving the marine environment is emphasized. The aquarium built in Expo 2012 is so far Korea's largest aquarium.<ref name=\"Expo2012\" /> It houses more than over 34,000 marine animals of 281 species and is divided into three main areas: Marine Life, Aqua Forest, and Ocean Life.<ref name =\"Aqua\" />\n\n====Marine Life====\n*This area mostly shows marine animals that live in coastal regions.\n*Animals such as belugas, Baikal seals, penguins, otters, sea lions and elephant seals live here.<ref name =\"Aqua\" />\n\n====Aqua Forest====\n*One unexpected feature in the aquarium is the presence of artificially made Amazon Jungle.\n*Although it does not completely mimic the actual jungle, it houses over 100 species of tropical creatures.<ref name =\"Aqua\" />\n\n====Ocean Life====\n*The last area has astonishing 360 view of the aquarium water tank.<ref name =\"Aqua\" />\n*As visitors walk through the tunnel made up of transparent and durable materials, they can view the marine animals swimming above them.\n*Unlike Marine Life area, it has over 200 species of marine animals, including huge sharks, rays, sardines, sea turtles and jellyfish from different oceans of the world.<ref name =\"Aqua\" />\nOther than wondrous marine organisms, there is a 3-D movie theater that shows short animation clip as well.<ref name=\"Expo2012\" /> Although aquarium is free-of-charge, 3-D movie costs money to watch it.<ref name=\"Expo2012\" /> At one time, aquarium can only allow 1,620 people inside and takes 60 minutes on average to fully view it.<ref name =\"Aqua\">{{cite web|title=Aquarium|url=http://eng.expo2012.kr/is/ps/unitybbs/bbs/selectBbsDetail.html?ispsBbsId=BBS026&ispsNttId=0000036195|publisher=EXPO 2012 YEOSU KOREA|accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Expo Digital Gallery===\nOne structure in Expo 2012 was the Expo Digital Gallery. Located between the international pavilions<ref name=\"intermap\" /> it was a gigantic LED screen attached at the bottom of the ceiling.<ref name=\"Expo2012\">{{cite web|title=Thematic Facilities|url=http://eng.expo2012.kr/is/ps/unitybbs/bbs/selectBbsDetail.html?ispsBbsId=BBS178&ispsNttId=0000029957|publisher=EXPO 2012 YEOSU KOREA|accessdate=20 October 2012}}</ref> It is a rectangular LED screen 218 meters wide and 30 meters long. This is equivalent to 6,324 units of 60 inch TVs.<ref name=\"Expo2012\" /> When pedestrians walked under the huge screen, they were able to see various animations played within the LED screen. Visitors with smartphones were able to take a picture, add a message, and send it to the screen so that it can be displayed on the screen.<ref name=\"Expo2012\" />\n\n===Sky Tower===\nTwo cement storage towers were transformed into the tallest structure of the Expo site and its observation deck offers panoramic views of the event grounds. It includes the acoustical signet of the Expo: The Vox Maris, a pipe organ that opened and closed every single Expo-day, it was also regularly used in concert play.  Inside Sky Tower a new Korean technique produces fresh water from sea water and a panoramic cinema shows scenes of ocean life. The Sky Tower was elected as one of the top four major attractions of Yeosu Expo.[[File:Vox Maris.JPG|thumb|Vox Maris]]\n\n===Expo Town===\nThe Expo Town was originally developed as an exemplary model of an [[Environmentalism|ecologically-sound]] coastal city, for use as a testing ground for \"green\" home projects. The organizers modified this section to display ocean-themed \"timeshares\" and premium dwelling places for the future beyond the Expo.\n\n===Yeosu Declaration===\nYeosu Declaration is to demand the international response to the situation such as pollution and overfishing, that preservation for the ocean and sustainable development is threatened. It emphasized the importance of international cooperation and feasible actions for solving problems in ocean. Yeosu Declaration was {{citation needed|date=August 2012}} chosen during the Expo and supported by the international society which seeks sustainable development.\n\n===Yeosu Project===\nUnder the Yeosu Project, the government of South Korea had planned to spend around $10 million to fund educational programs in developing countries and to fund the visit of professionals from developing countries to South Korea. This training and education was planned to focus on the protection of marine ecosystems and on sustainable development.<ref>[http://eng.expo2012.kr/is/ps/unitybbs/bbs/selectBbsDetail.html?ispsBbsId=BBS001&ispsNttId=0000012050 The Yeosu Project: Summary]</ref>\n\n===Performances===\nOther than pavilions and exhibition buildings, Yeosu Expo held various indoor and outdoor performances to further entertain its visitors. Such performances involved water shows, parades, concerts involving pop stars from other countries, movies, and theatricals. For each event, the location varies and has meaningful messages to portray to the audiences. Some are performed multiple times while others are performed once. These diverse events not only allow the visitors to enjoy their time to the fullest but also allow them to realize the reasons for holding Yeosu Expo 2012.\n\n====Water shows====\n*'''The Big-O Show''': The Big-O show designed by ECA2<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inparkmagazine.com/big-o-central-feature-at-yeosu-expo-2012-designed-by-eca2-depends-on-medialon-show-control/ |title=\"Big O\" central feature at Yeosu Expo 2012 designed by ECA2 depends on Medialon show control |author=InPark Magazine}}</ref> was the main performance on water and it intended to be one of the must-watch performances in Yeosu Expo 2012. The show was not performed by people but rather by a gigantic donut-shaped machine capable of igniting explosive fires, spraying seawater, and shining lights of different colors at many directions. The machine is 120 meters wide and has 345 water nozzles.<ref name=\"Expo2012\" /> In addition, there are numerous small water fountains at the bottom that shot seawater upwards to more than 70 meters.<ref name=\"Expo2012\" /> The hollow circle in the middle of the machine is used to display the animated video. Instead of using a projector with a screen, the machine used holograms generated by the machine and water falling from top of the machine as the screen.<ref name=\"Expo2012\" />  Special effects such as the lights, water, and fire changed to match the mood of the video. The plot of the video involved a female protagonist exploring the sea.

At each round of voting, the venue with the fewest votes is out and there is an additional vote between the remaining venues.\n\n== Theme, vision, and goals ==\n\n===Theme===\n'''The Living Ocean and Coast:'''  ''Diversity of Resources and Sustainable Development''\n\n====Background of theme====\n*The Expo theme aimed to help shed light on humankind's knowledge and advancement of technology concerning the ocean and coast and identify ways to resolve challenges facing the ocean.<ref name=\"press view\"/> Since the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] went into effect in 1993, the ocean has emerged as an important element in resolving various problems humankind faces, including those related to resources, food, space and the environment. However, industrial activities have damaged the marine ecosystem and subsequently reduced fish stocks. As a result, the ocean faces severe crisis. A damaged marine ecosystem, global warming and natural disasters are not limited to a certain country or region, but are issues that have global implications.\n\n==== Subthemes ====\n\nThe theme, \u201cThe Living Ocean and Coast,\u201d was divided into three sub-themes: ''Development and Preservation of the Ocean and Coast'', ''New Resources Technology'', and ''Creative Marine Activities''. These sub-themes have been further developed into 6 thematic groups, namely, Climate & Environment, Marine Life, Marine Industry & Technology, Marine City and Marine Civilization, and Marine Arts, each of which are {{Update after|2012|08|12}} demonstrated in their respective sub-theme pavilions.\n\n'''Development and Preservation of the Ocean and Coast''' aimed to inspire a new level of cooperation in the international community so as to combat climate change and create a paradigm where development and preservation find a better balance. The last few decades have witnessed environmental degradation caused by use and development of natural resources by humankind. Our economies and societies must break away from their current fossil fuel-based economies to minimize damage to both people and the environment. The sub theme argued that individuals, businesses, countries and the global community must realize that marine resources are limited and should not be subject to careless use, but that they are the fundamentals for the sound development of our future society, and people and ecosystems must be considered on the same level.\n\n'''New Resources Technology''' illustrated the progress and future prospects of marine technology, a new growth driver for the advancement of humankind. Countries are becoming more competitive in marine-related industries and are developing new technologies to address issues related to resources and the changing environment. The discreet use of resources, which strikes a balance between development and preservation, is only possible if based on advanced marine science and technology. Fostering marine industries will create added value and generate new jobs to transform sluggish industries into low cost, high efficiency structures.\n\n'''Creative Maritime Activities''' aimed to demonstrate the relationship between the oceans and humankind through culture and art and promote the new ideals of the seatizen and seavilization. A mix of play and experience (edutainment) aimed to trigger the imagination and curiosity of attendees towards an unknown world and to inspire children to learn to love and appreciate the oceans. A wide collection of marine-related culture and arts, including poetry, novels, films, operas, musicals, plays and music were shown at the Yeosu Expo.\n\n== Primary content ==\n\n===Korean Pavilion===\nThe Korean Pavilion was designed to convey the theme of Expo 2012 Yeosu Korea, whilst also emphasizing Korea's vision and role.\n<br />\nThe exhibition hall was adorned with traditional Korean constructions and colors. The event organizers have also stated that a diverse selection of official events and \"event corners\",{{elucidate|date=June 2012}} representing Korean culture, will be prepared for the international occasion.\n<br />\nAn exhibition that has been highlighted in the lead-up to the event was one that will feature the most notable achievements in Korean [[shipbuilding]], marine transportation, marine products, [[marine technology]], and marine safety. These achievements are shown in two exhibition halls.<ref name=\"KP\">{{cite web|title=Korea Pavilion|url=http://eng.expo2012.kr/is/ps/unitybbs/bbs/selectBbsDetail.html?ispsBbsId=BBS026&ispsNttId=0000036206|publisher=EXPO 2012 YEOSU KOREA|accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe first exhibition hall ''Sea of Miracles'' focused on Korea's past ocean adventures.<ref name=\"KP\" /> and was divided into three acts:<ref name=\"KP\" /> ''Experiencing Korea's Seas'', ''Discovering Korea's Maritime Spirit'' and ''- Realizing Korea's Maritime Capacity''.\n\nThe second hall 2 ''Sea of Hope'' portrayed Korea's potential future role in maritime era<ref name=\"KP\" /> and included the world's largest dome screen.<ref name=\"KP\" />\n\n===International Pavilions===\n\nIt was anticipated that the International Pavilions section will occupy the exhibition space's largest physical area. This section of the Expo provided an opportunity for participating countries to plan and hold their exhibitions. Themed quarters were displayed in the International Pavilions exhibition, consisting of the \"Sea of Life\", \"Sea of Exchange\", \"Sea of Peace\", and \"Sea of Land\".

In the tradition of previous expos (Zaragoza Expo's \u201cWater\u201d, Lisbon Expo's \u201cSea\u201d, and \u201cFuture heritage\u201d), the organizers of Expo 2012 Yeosu Korea have expressed an intention to innovate and progress beyond the concepts of the event's history.\n\n===Aquarium, the Marine Life Pavilion===\nBased upon the notion that marine life is the source of all life, the exhibition sought to present the diversity of the earth's marine resources, as well as the viability of their continuous use and development by humankind.\nVisitors observe{{Update after|2012|08|12}} the sea as a \"treasure house\" of [[biodiversity]] and, by highlighting our mutual relationship with the sea, the importance of preserving the marine environment is emphasized. The aquarium built in Expo 2012 is so far Korea's largest aquarium.<ref name=\"Expo2012\" /> It houses more than over 34,000 marine animals of 281 species and is divided into three main areas: Marine Life, Aqua Forest, and Ocean Life.<ref name =\"Aqua\" />\n\n====Marine Life====\n*This area mostly shows marine animals that live in coastal regions.\n*Animals such as belugas, Baikal seals, penguins, otters, sea lions and elephant seals live here.<ref name =\"Aqua\" />\n\n====Aqua Forest====\n*One unexpected feature in the aquarium is the presence of artificially made Amazon Jungle.\n*Although it does not completely mimic the actual jungle, it houses over 100 species of tropical creatures.<ref name =\"Aqua\" />\n\n====Ocean Life====\n*The last area has astonishing 360 view of the aquarium water tank.<ref name =\"Aqua\" />\n*As visitors walk through the tunnel made up of transparent and durable materials, they can view the marine animals swimming above them.\n*Unlike Marine Life area, it has over 200 species of marine animals, including huge sharks, rays, sardines, sea turtles and jellyfish from different oceans of the world.<ref name =\"Aqua\" />\nOther than wondrous marine organisms, there is a 3-D movie theater that shows short animation clip as well.<ref name=\"Expo2012\" /> Although aquarium is free-of-charge, 3-D movie costs money to watch it.<ref name=\"Expo2012\" /> At one time, aquarium can only allow 1,620 people inside and takes 60 minutes on average to fully view it.<ref name =\"Aqua\">{{cite web|title=Aquarium|url=http://eng.expo2012.kr/is/ps/unitybbs/bbs/selectBbsDetail.html?ispsBbsId=BBS026&ispsNttId=0000036195|publisher=EXPO 2012 YEOSU KOREA|accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Expo Digital Gallery===\nOne structure in Expo 2012 was the Expo Digital Gallery. Located between the international pavilions<ref name=\"intermap\" /> it was a gigantic LED screen attached at the bottom of the ceiling.<ref name=\"Expo2012\">{{cite web|title=Thematic Facilities|url=http://eng.expo2012.kr/is/ps/unitybbs/bbs/selectBbsDetail.html?ispsBbsId=BBS178&ispsNttId=0000029957|publisher=EXPO 2012 YEOSU KOREA|accessdate=20 October 2012}}</ref> It is a rectangular LED screen 218 meters wide and 30 meters long. This is equivalent to 6,324 units of 60 inch TVs.<ref name=\"Expo2012\" /> When pedestrians walked under the huge screen, they were able to see various animations played within the LED screen. Visitors with smartphones were able to take a picture, add a message, and send it to the screen so that it can be displayed on the screen.<ref name=\"Expo2012\" />\n\n===Sky Tower===\nTwo cement storage towers were transformed into the tallest structure of the Expo site and its observation deck offers panoramic views of the event grounds. It includes the acoustical signet of the Expo: The Vox Maris, a pipe organ that opened and closed every single Expo-day, it was also regularly used in concert play.  Inside Sky Tower a new Korean technique produces fresh water from sea water and a panoramic cinema shows scenes of ocean life. The Sky Tower was elected as one of the top four major attractions of Yeosu Expo.[[File:Vox Maris.JPG|thumb|Vox Maris]]\n\n===Expo Town===\nThe Expo Town was originally developed as an exemplary model of an [[Environmentalism|ecologically-sound]] coastal city, for use as a testing ground for \"green\" home projects. The organizers modified this section to display ocean-themed \"timeshares\" and premium dwelling places for the future beyond the Expo.\n\n===Yeosu Declaration===\nYeosu Declaration is to demand the international response to the situation such as pollution and overfishing, that preservation for the ocean and sustainable development is threatened. It emphasized the importance of international cooperation and feasible actions for solving problems in ocean. Yeosu Declaration was {{citation needed|date=August 2012}} chosen during the Expo and supported by the international society which seeks sustainable development.\n\n===Yeosu Project===\nUnder the Yeosu Project, the government of South Korea had planned to spend around $10 million to fund educational programs in developing countries and to fund the visit of professionals from developing countries to South Korea. This training and education was planned to focus on the protection of marine ecosystems and on sustainable development.<ref>[http://eng.expo2012.kr/is/ps/unitybbs/bbs/selectBbsDetail.html?ispsBbsId=BBS001&ispsNttId=0000012050 The Yeosu Project: Summary]</ref>\n\n===Performances===\nOther than pavilions and exhibition buildings, Yeosu Expo held various indoor and outdoor performances to further entertain its visitors. Such performances involved water shows, parades, concerts involving pop stars from other countries, movies, and theatricals. For each event, the location varies and has meaningful messages to portray to the audiences. Some are performed multiple times while others are performed once. These diverse events not only allow the visitors to enjoy their time to the fullest but also allow them to realize the reasons for holding Yeosu Expo 2012.\n\n====Water shows====\n*'''The Big-O Show''': The Big-O show designed by ECA2<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inparkmagazine.com/big-o-central-feature-at-yeosu-expo-2012-designed-by-eca2-depends-on-medialon-show-control/ |title=\"Big O\" central feature at Yeosu Expo 2012 designed by ECA2 depends on Medialon show control |author=InPark Magazine}}</ref> was the main performance on water and it intended to be one of the must-watch performances in Yeosu Expo 2012. The show was not performed by people but rather by a gigantic donut-shaped machine capable of igniting explosive fires, spraying seawater, and shining lights of different colors at many directions. The machine is 120 meters wide and has 345 water nozzles.<ref name=\"Expo2012\" /> In addition, there are numerous small water fountains at the bottom that shot seawater upwards to more than 70 meters.<ref name=\"Expo2012\" /> The hollow circle in the middle of the machine is used to display the animated video. Instead of using a projector with a screen, the machine used holograms generated by the machine and water falling from top of the machine as the screen.<ref name=\"Expo2012\" />  Special effects such as the lights, water, and fire changed to match the mood of the video. The plot of the video involved a female protagonist exploring the sea.

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).
