It is situated on a peninsula in the south of New Caledonia's main island, [[Grande Terre (New Caledonia)|Grande Terre]], and is home to the majority of the island's [[Europe]]an, [[Polynesia]]n ([[Wallis and Futuna|Wallisians]], [[Wallis and Futuna|Futunians]], [[Tahiti]]ans), [[Indonesia]]n, and [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] populations, as well as many [[Melanesian]]s, [[Ni-Vanuatu]] and [[Kanak people|Kanak]]s who work in one of the [[Oceania|South Pacific]]'s most [[industrialisation|industrialised]] cities. The city lies on a protected deepwater harbour that serves as the chief port for New Caledonia.\n\nAt the September 2019 census, there were 182,341 inhabitants in the metropolitan area of Greater Noum\u00e9a ({{Lang-fr|agglom\u00e9ration du Grand Noum\u00e9a}}), 94,285 of whom lived in the city ([[communes of France|commune]]) of Noum\u00e9a proper.<ref name=pop>{{cite web|url=http://www.isee.nc/component/phocadownload/category/194-structure-de-la-population-et-evolutions?download=1329:population-legale-2014|title=Recensement de la population 2014 \u2013 Populations l\u00e9gales 2014|publisher=ISEE|accessdate=2014-11-16|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150419171546/http://www.isee.nc/component/phocadownload/category/194-structure-de-la-population-et-evolutions?download=1329:population-legale-2014|archivedate=19 April 2015}}</ref> 67.2% of the population of New Caledonia live in Greater Noum\u00e9a, which covers the communes of Noum\u00e9a, [[Le Mont-Dore (New Caledonia)|Le Mont-Dore]], [[Dumb\u00e9a]] and [[Pa\u00efta]].\n\n==History==\nThe first European to establish a settlement in the vicinity was British trader [[James Paddon]] in 1851. Anxious to assert control of the island, the French established a settlement nearby three years later in 1854, moving from [[Balade (New Caledonia)|Balade]] in the north of the island. This settlement was initially called Port-de-France and was renamed Noum\u00e9a in 1866. The area served first as a [[penal colony]], later as a centre for the exportation of the [[nickel]] and [[gold]] that was mined nearby.\n\nFrom 1904 to 1940 Noum\u00e9a was linked to [[Dumb\u00e9a]] and [[Pa\u00efta]] by the [[Noum\u00e9a-Pa\u00efta railway]], the only railway line that ever existed in New Caledonia.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Noum\u00e9a served as the headquarters of the [[United States]] military in the South Pacific. The five-sided U.S. military headquarters complex was adopted after the war as the base for a new regional intergovernmental development organisation: the South Pacific Commission, later known as the [[Secretariat of the Pacific Community]], and later still as the Pacific Community.\n\nThe city maintains much of New Caledonia's unique mix of French and old Melanesian culture. Even today the [[United States|US]] wartime military influence lingers, both with the warmth that many New Caledonian people feel towards the United States after experiencing the relative friendliness of American soldiers and also with the names of several of the quarters in Noum\u00e9a. Districts such as \"Receiving\" and \"Robinson\", or even \"Motor Pool\", strike the [[English-speaking world|anglophone]] ear strangely, until the historical context becomes clear.\n\n==Geography==\nThe [[city]] is situated on an irregular, hilly [[peninsula]] near the southeast end of [[New Caledonia]], which is in the south-west [[Pacific Ocean]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nNeighbourhoods of Noum\u00e9a include:<ref>\"[http://www.ville-noumea.nc/vivre/quartiers.asp Les quartiers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722112059/http://www.ville-noumea.nc/vivre/quartiers.asp |date=22 July 2011 }}.\" Noum\u00e9a.

Anxious to assert control of the island, the French established a settlement nearby three years later in 1854, moving from [[Balade (New Caledonia)|Balade]] in the north of the island. This settlement was initially called Port-de-France and was renamed Noum\u00e9a in 1866. The area served first as a [[penal colony]], later as a centre for the exportation of the [[nickel]] and [[gold]] that was mined nearby.\n\nFrom 1904 to 1940 Noum\u00e9a was linked to [[Dumb\u00e9a]] and [[Pa\u00efta]] by the [[Noum\u00e9a-Pa\u00efta railway]], the only railway line that ever existed in New Caledonia.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Noum\u00e9a served as the headquarters of the [[United States]] military in the South Pacific. The five-sided U.S. military headquarters complex was adopted after the war as the base for a new regional intergovernmental development organisation: the South Pacific Commission, later known as the [[Secretariat of the Pacific Community]], and later still as the Pacific Community.\n\nThe city maintains much of New Caledonia's unique mix of French and old Melanesian culture. Even today the [[United States|US]] wartime military influence lingers, both with the warmth that many New Caledonian people feel towards the United States after experiencing the relative friendliness of American soldiers and also with the names of several of the quarters in Noum\u00e9a.

Around the 16th century, the practice of going house to house in disguise (a practice called guising) to ask for food began and was often accompanied by recitation of traditional verses (a practice called mumming).

A time of spiritual unrest, when the souls of the dead, along with ghosts and evil spirits, were believed to walk the land. Church bells were run and fires lit to guide these souls on their way and deflect them from haunting honest Christian folk. Barns and homes were blessed to protect people and livestock from the effects of witches, who were believed to accompany the malignant spirits as they traveld the earth. Although a rare few continued to divine the future, cast spells, and tell ghost stories in rural communities, woe to anyone who was denounced to the church for engaging in such activities.

A variant of dunking involves kneeling on a chair, holding a fork between the teeth and trying to drive the fork into an apple. Another common game involves hanging up treacle or syrup-coated [[scone]]s by strings; these must be eaten without using hands while they remain attached to the string, an activity that inevitably leads to a sticky face. Another once-popular game involves hanging a small wooden rod from the ceiling at head height, with a lit candle on one end and an apple hanging from the other. The rod is spun round and everyone takes turns to try to catch the apple with their teeth.<ref>Danaher, Kevin. ''The Year in Ireland: Irish Calendar Customs''.

Perhaps the most common traditional Halloween costume is that of the ghost.

The baking and sharing of souls cakes was introduced around the 15th century: in some cultures, the poor would go door to door to collect them in exchange for praying for the dead (a practice called souling), often carrying lanterns made of hollowed-out turnips. Around the 16th century, the practice of going house to house in disguise (a practice called guising) to ask for food began and was often accompanied by recitation of traditional verses (a practice called mumming). Wearing costumes, another tradition, has many possible explanations, such as it was done to confuse the spirits or souls who visited the earth or who rose from local graveyards to engage in what was called a Danse Macabre, basically a large party among the dead.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Books & Culture: A Christian Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOVEAQAAIAAJ|year=1999|publisher=[[Christianity Today]]|page=12|quote=Sometimes enacted as at village pageants, the danse macabre was also performed as court masques, the courtiers dressing up as corpses from various strata of society...both the name and the observance began liturgically as All Hallows' Eve.|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423113526/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZOVEAQAAIAAJ|archivedate=23 April 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Morrow2001\"/><ref name=\"H\u00f6randner2005\">{{cite book|last=H\u00f6randner|first=Editha|title=Halloween in der Steiermark und anderswo |year=2005|publisher=LIT Verlag M\u00fcnster|isbn=978-3825888893|page=99|quote=On the other hand the postmodern phenomenon of \"antifashion\" is also to be found in some Halloween costumes.

A variant of dunking involves kneeling on a chair, holding a fork between the teeth and trying to drive the fork into an apple. Another common game involves hanging up treacle or syrup-coated [[scone]]s by strings; these must be eaten without using hands while they remain attached to the string, an activity that inevitably leads to a sticky face. Another once-popular game involves hanging a small wooden rod from the ceiling at head height, with a lit candle on one end and an apple hanging from the other. The rod is spun round and everyone takes turns to try to catch the apple with their teeth.<ref>Danaher, Kevin. ''The Year in Ireland: Irish Calendar Customs''.

A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).
