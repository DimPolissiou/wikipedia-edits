Burton, to MacDonald's mind, would not directly answer her questions and was being deliberately evasive and intractable. Her decision not to leave the chamber was in protest of Burton's refusal to answer her questions. She, along with a number of Sinn F\u00e9in colleagues, remained in the chamber for four and a half hours.

The final colour is usually a black or greyish colour.<ref name=\"YTCA\" /> P. H. Combs, writing in 1891, complained about show wins awarded to puppies, when the dog's coat does not fully come in until three or four years old, \"and the honour of winning such a prize (for a puppy) can therefore be of but little practical benefit to the owner\" since the adult dog's colour cannot be exactly predicted.<ref>The American book of the Dog, edited by G.

For shows, the coat is left long, and may be trimmed to floor length to give ease of movement and a neater appearance. Hair on the feet and the tips of ears can also be trimmed.<ref name=\"AKCstandard\" /><ref name=\"KCstandard\" /> The traditional long coat is extremely high maintenance. The coat might get knotted if not brushed daily. In order to prevent breakage, the coat may be wrapped in [[rice paper]], [[tissue paper]] or plastic, after a light oiling with a coat oil. The oil has to be washed out once a month and the wraps must be fixed periodically during the week to prevent them from sliding down and breaking the hair. Elaborate coat care dates from the earliest days of the breed. In 1878, John Walsh described similar preparations: the coat is \"well greased\" with [[coconut oil]], the dog is bathed weekly, and the dog's feet are \"carefully kept in stockings\".<ref>The Dogs of the British Islands, pg 212, by John Henry Walsh, The Filed publisher, 1878, Third Edition</ref>\n\n==Temperament==\n[[File:Henri the yorki from alabama .jpg|alt=|thumb|The Yorkshire Terrier character is described as \"conveying an important air\". According to the standard, the dog's high head carriage and confident manner should give the appearance of vigor and self-importance.]]\nThe ideal Yorkshire Terrier character or \"personality\" is described with a \"carriage very upright feisty\" and \"conveying an important air\".<ref name=\"KCstandard\" /> Though small, the Yorkshire Terrier is active, very protective, curious, and fond of attention.  Mentally sound and emotionally secure ones should normally not show the soft submissive temperament seen in [[lap dog]]s, although many exhibit this behaviour due to improper training.  Because of this, it is advised that a Yorkie would not be suitable for a home with typical young children. Instead, they make ideal companions for older families with many more reputable breeders routinely only homing to families with children older than about 10 years for the comfort of the dog, but more so for the benefit of the child.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://doglime.com/yorkshire-terrier/|title=Is Yorkshire Terrier Child-Friendly?|date=June 16, 2019|publisher=Doglime}}</ref>\n\nYorkshire Terriers are an easy dog breed to train. This results from their own nature to work without human assistance. They are naturally smart and quick to learn with many being food- and or praise-motivated.  Because they were developed as a working breed, many need a lot of both physical and mental stimulation\u2014with both long walks/runs but also indoor games and training to keep their mind busy. They are known for being yappy, but many have reported that a contented Yorkie is a quiet one\u2014that will happily curl up on your knee in the evening. But they are all individuals, with some being much more laid back than others, and the breeder should ideally be able to advise on the needs and temperaments of their particular line. Yorkies are easily adaptable to all surroundings, travel well, and make suitable pets for many homes. Due to their small size, they require limited exercise but need daily interaction with people. They thrive on attention and love.

The first set of teeth is the 28-piece [[deciduous teeth]] (often referred to as \"milk teeth\", \"baby teeth\", or \"puppy teeth\"). The second set is the 42-piece permanent or adult teeth. Sometimes the number of permanent or adult teeth may vary, which is fine as long as they do not cause bad bite. When puppies are born, they have no teeth because milk is the only food they need. The deciduous teeth will grow from the age of 3 to 8 weeks old, in the order of [[Incisor|incisors]], [[Canine tooth|canines]], and [[Premolar|premolars]]. Yorkie puppies have no [[Molar (tooth)|molar teeth]]. Yorkie puppies will start to lose their deciduous or baby teeth when the permanent or adult teeth come in. The permanent or adult grow when the Yorkie puppies are 4 to 8 months old. By around 8 months old, those teeth should fully develop. The permanent or adult teeth will grow in the order of incisors, canines, premolars, and molars. Molar teeth will develop at around 6 to 8 months old.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nye|first=Sock|title=When Do Yorkie Puppies Lose Their Teeth?|url=http://yorkiepuppies.org.uk/when-do-yorkie-puppies-lose-their-teeth.html|publisher=Sock Nye|accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nYorkies and other small dog breeds may have problems if the deciduous or baby teeth do not fall out as the permanent or adult teeth grow. This is caused by the new teeth not growing right underneath the deciduous teeth. (Usually, a puppy's body will absorb the roots of puppy teeth.) If the puppy tooth does not yield to the incoming tooth, it should be removed because it can cause a [[malocclusion]] or bad bite.<ref>{{cite web|last=Van Dalsum|first=Jeff|title=Different Stages of Puppy Dental Development|url=http://perfectpuppycare.com/different-stages-of-puppy-dental-development|publisher=Jeff Van Dalsum|accessdate=20 June 2012}}</ref>  Retained teeth can cause [[tooth decay]] because food can be easily caught in between the deciduous and permanent teeth. Sometimes the new teeth are forced to grow into an abnormal position and further cause a bad bite. The retained teeth may stay or fall weeks after the new teeth have developed. When necessary, the retained deciduous or baby teeth need to be removed surgically.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nye|first=Sock|title=Retained Deciduous or Baby Teeth|url=http://yorkiepuppies.org.uk/retained-deciduous-or-baby-teeth.html|publisher=Sock Nye|accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Yorkie's Retained Deciduous or Baby Fangs.jpg|thumb|A Yorkshire Terrier's retained deciduous or baby fangs]]\n\nLike other small breeds, Yorkies are also prone to severe dental disease. Because they have a small jaw, their teeth can become crowded and may not fall out naturally. This can cause food and plaque to build up, and bacteria can eventually develop on the surface of the teeth, leading to [[periodontal disease]]. In addition, the bacteria can spread to other parts of the body and cause heart and kidney problems. The best prevention is regular brushing of the teeth with a toothpaste formulated specifically for dogs. Human toothpaste is not recommended, because it foams more easily and may be swallowed. Professional teeth cleaning by a veterinarian may also be required to prevent the development of dental problems.<ref name=Teeth>{{cite web|title=Caring For Your Yorkshire Terrier: Common Health Problems |url =http://www.essortment.com/caring-yorkshire-terrier-common-health-problems-63025.html | accessdate =13 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Genetic defects===\nCertain [[genetic disorder]]s can be found in Yorkshire Terriers, including [[distichia]]sis, [[hydrocephalus]], [[hypoplasia of dens]], [[Legg\u2013Calv\u00e9\u2013Perthes syndrome]], [[luxating patella]], [[portosystemic shunt]], [[retinal dysplasia]], [[tracheal collapse]], and [[Bladder stone (animal)|bladder stone]]s.<ref name=KSU>{{cite web|title=Hereditary and Congenital Diseases of Purebred Dogs |publisher=Kansas State University |url=http://www.vet.ksu.edu/studentorgs/Therio/pdf/Hereditary_Congenital.pdf |accessdate=13 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221132319/http://www.vet.ksu.edu/studentorgs/Therio/pdf/Hereditary_Congenital.pdf |archivedate=21 February 2007 }}</ref>  The following are among the most common [[Congenital disorder|congenital]] [[Genetic disorder|defects]] that affect Yorkie's:\n\n* [[Distichia]]e, [[eyelash]]es arising from an abnormal spot (usually the duct of the [[meibomian gland]] at the edge of the eyelid), are often found in Yorkies.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news|last=Schultz |first=Jacque Lynn |title=The Terrier Tyke With a Big Attitude |publisher=ASPCA |year=2004 |url=http://www.petfinder.com/journalindex.cgi?path=/public/breeds/dogbreeds/1.4.28.txt&template=templateprint.html |accessdate=10 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041230234816/http://www.petfinder.com/journalindex.cgi?path=/public/breeds/dogbreeds/1.4.28.txt&template=templateprint.html |archivedate=30 December 2004 }}</ref>  Distichiae can irritate the eye and cause tearing, squinting, inflammation, [[corneal abrasion]]s or [[Corneal ulcers in animals|corneal ulcers]], and scarring.

In this condition some of the dog's blood bypasses the liver and the \"dirty\" blood goes on to poison the heart, brain, lungs and other [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] with toxins. A Yorkie with this condition might exhibit a wide variety of symptoms, such as small stature, poor appetite, weak muscle development, decreased ability to learn, inferior coordination, occasional vomiting and diarrhoea, [[Abnormality (behavior)|behavioral abnormalities]], seizures (especially after a meal) and [[blindness]], which could lead to a coma and death.

The final colour is usually a black or greyish colour.<ref name=\"YTCA\" /> P. H. Combs, writing in 1891, complained about show wins awarded to puppies, when the dog's coat does not fully come in until three or four years old, \"and the honour of winning such a prize (for a puppy) can therefore be of but little practical benefit to the owner\" since the adult dog's colour cannot be exactly predicted.<ref>The American book of the Dog, edited by G.

For shows, the coat is left long, and may be trimmed to floor length to give ease of movement and a neater appearance. Hair on the feet and the tips of ears can also be trimmed.<ref name=\"AKCstandard\" /><ref name=\"KCstandard\" /> The traditional long coat is extremely high maintenance. The coat might get knotted if not brushed daily. In order to prevent breakage, the coat may be wrapped in [[rice paper]], [[tissue paper]] or plastic, after a light oiling with a coat oil. The oil has to be washed out once a month and the wraps must be fixed periodically during the week to prevent them from sliding down and breaking the hair. Elaborate coat care dates from the earliest days of the breed. In 1878, John Walsh described similar preparations: the coat is \"well greased\" with [[coconut oil]], the dog is bathed weekly, and the dog's feet are \"carefully kept in stockings\".<ref>The Dogs of the British Islands, pg 212, by John Henry Walsh, The Filed publisher, 1878, Third Edition</ref>\n\n==Temperament==\n[[File:Henri the yorki from alabama .jpg|alt=|thumb|The Yorkshire Terrier character is described as \"conveying an important air\". According to the standard, the dog's high head carriage and confident manner should give the appearance of vigor and self-importance.]]\nThe ideal Yorkshire Terrier character or \"personality\" is described with a \"carriage very upright feisty\" and \"conveying an important air\".<ref name=\"KCstandard\" /> Though small, the Yorkshire Terrier is active, very protective, curious, and fond of attention.  Mentally sound and emotionally secure ones should normally not show the soft submissive temperament seen in [[lap dog]]s, although many exhibit this behaviour due to improper training.  Because of this, it is advised that a Yorkie would not be suitable for a home with typical young children. Instead, they make ideal companions for older families with many more reputable breeders routinely only homing to families with children older than about 10 years for the comfort of the dog, but more so for the benefit of the child.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://doglime.com/yorkshire-terrier/|title=Is Yorkshire Terrier Child-Friendly?|date=June 16, 2019|publisher=Doglime}}</ref>\n\nYorkshire Terriers are an easy dog breed to train. This results from their own nature to work without human assistance. They are naturally smart and quick to learn with many being food- and or praise-motivated.  Because they were developed as a working breed, many need a lot of both physical and mental stimulation\u2014with both long walks/runs but also indoor games and training to keep their mind busy. They are known for being yappy, but many have reported that a contented Yorkie is a quiet one\u2014that will happily curl up on your knee in the evening. But they are all individuals, with some being much more laid back than others, and the breeder should ideally be able to advise on the needs and temperaments of their particular line. Yorkies are easily adaptable to all surroundings, travel well, and make suitable pets for many homes. Due to their small size, they require limited exercise but need daily interaction with people. They thrive on attention and love. Many are more timid around other dogs and prefer to stay close to their humans for comfort.<ref name=\"Get to Know the Yorkshire Terrier\"/>\n\nYorkshire Terriers do tend to [[Bark (sound)|bark]] a lot. This makes them excellent watchdogs, as they will sound the alarm when anyone gets close. A barking problem can often be resolved with proper training and exercise.\n\nYorkshire Terriers are ranked 34th in [[Stanley Coren]]'s ''[[The Intelligence of Dogs]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Coren|first=Stanley|title=The Intelligence of Dogs |year=2006|publisher=Pocket Books|location=London, UK|isbn=978-1-4165-0287-6}}</ref>\n\n==Health==\nHealth issues often seen in the Yorkshire Terrier include [[bronchitis]], [[lymphangiectasia]], [[portosystemic shunt]], [[cataract]]s, and [[Keratoconjunctivitis sicca|keratitis sicca]].<ref name=Lane>Lane, Marion (2001).

The first set of teeth is the 28-piece [[deciduous teeth]] (often referred to as \"milk teeth\", \"baby teeth\", or \"puppy teeth\"). The second set is the 42-piece permanent or adult teeth. Sometimes the number of permanent or adult teeth may vary, which is fine as long as they do not cause bad bite. When puppies are born, they have no teeth because milk is the only food they need. The deciduous teeth will grow from the age of 3 to 8 weeks old, in the order of [[Incisor|incisors]], [[Canine tooth|canines]], and [[Premolar|premolars]]. Yorkie puppies have no [[Molar (tooth)|molar teeth]]. Yorkie puppies will start to lose their deciduous or baby teeth when the permanent or adult teeth come in. The permanent or adult grow when the Yorkie puppies are 4 to 8 months old. By around 8 months old, those teeth should fully develop. The permanent or adult teeth will grow in the order of incisors, canines, premolars, and molars. Molar teeth will develop at around 6 to 8 months old.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nye|first=Sock|title=When Do Yorkie Puppies Lose Their Teeth?|url=http://yorkiepuppies.org.uk/when-do-yorkie-puppies-lose-their-teeth.html|publisher=Sock Nye|accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nYorkies and other small dog breeds may have problems if the deciduous or baby teeth do not fall out as the permanent or adult teeth grow. This is caused by the new teeth not growing right underneath the deciduous teeth. (Usually, a puppy's body will absorb the roots of puppy teeth.) If the puppy tooth does not yield to the incoming tooth, it should be removed because it can cause a [[malocclusion]] or bad bite.<ref>{{cite web|last=Van Dalsum|first=Jeff|title=Different Stages of Puppy Dental Development|url=http://perfectpuppycare.com/different-stages-of-puppy-dental-development|publisher=Jeff Van Dalsum|accessdate=20 June 2012}}</ref>  Retained teeth can cause [[tooth decay]] because food can be easily caught in between the deciduous and permanent teeth. Sometimes the new teeth are forced to grow into an abnormal position and further cause a bad bite. The retained teeth may stay or fall weeks after the new teeth have developed. When necessary, the retained deciduous or baby teeth need to be removed surgically.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nye|first=Sock|title=Retained Deciduous or Baby Teeth|url=http://yorkiepuppies.org.uk/retained-deciduous-or-baby-teeth.html|publisher=Sock Nye|accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Yorkie's Retained Deciduous or Baby Fangs.jpg|thumb|A Yorkshire Terrier's retained deciduous or baby fangs]]\n\nLike other small breeds, Yorkies are also prone to severe dental disease. Because they have a small jaw, their teeth can become crowded and may not fall out naturally. This can cause food and plaque to build up, and bacteria can eventually develop on the surface of the teeth, leading to [[periodontal disease]]. In addition, the bacteria can spread to other parts of the body and cause heart and kidney problems. The best prevention is regular brushing of the teeth with a toothpaste formulated specifically for dogs. Human toothpaste is not recommended, because it foams more easily and may be swallowed. Professional teeth cleaning by a veterinarian may also be required to prevent the development of dental problems.<ref name=Teeth>{{cite web|title=Caring For Your Yorkshire Terrier: Common Health Problems |url =http://www.essortment.com/caring-yorkshire-terrier-common-health-problems-63025.html | accessdate =13 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Genetic defects===\nCertain [[genetic disorder]]s can be found in Yorkshire Terriers, including [[distichia]]sis, [[hydrocephalus]], [[hypoplasia of dens]], [[Legg\u2013Calv\u00e9\u2013Perthes syndrome]], [[luxating patella]], [[portosystemic shunt]], [[retinal dysplasia]], [[tracheal collapse]], and [[Bladder stone (animal)|bladder stone]]s.<ref name=KSU>{{cite web|title=Hereditary and Congenital Diseases of Purebred Dogs |publisher=Kansas State University |url=http://www.vet.ksu.edu/studentorgs/Therio/pdf/Hereditary_Congenital.pdf |accessdate=13 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221132319/http://www.vet.ksu.edu/studentorgs/Therio/pdf/Hereditary_Congenital.pdf |archivedate=21 February 2007 }}</ref>  The following are among the most common [[Congenital disorder|congenital]] [[Genetic disorder|defects]] that affect Yorkie's:\n\n* [[Distichia]]e, [[eyelash]]es arising from an abnormal spot (usually the duct of the [[meibomian gland]] at the edge of the eyelid), are often found in Yorkies.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news|last=Schultz |first=Jacque Lynn |title=The Terrier Tyke With a Big Attitude |publisher=ASPCA |year=2004 |url=http://www.petfinder.com/journalindex.cgi?path=/public/breeds/dogbreeds/1.4.28.txt&template=templateprint.html |accessdate=10 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041230234816/http://www.petfinder.com/journalindex.cgi?path=/public/breeds/dogbreeds/1.4.28.txt&template=templateprint.html |archivedate=30 December 2004 }}</ref>  Distichiae can irritate the eye and cause tearing, squinting, inflammation, [[corneal abrasion]]s or [[Corneal ulcers in animals|corneal ulcers]], and scarring.
