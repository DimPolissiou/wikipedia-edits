The king, educated by Westerners, was keen on copying the system of government of the absolute monarchs of Europe. At first he created two councils: the \"Privy Council of Siam\" ({{lang-th|\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e1b\u0e24\u0e01\u0e29\u0e32\u0e43\u0e19\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e4c}}; {{rtgs|''thi prueksa nai phra ong''}}) (49 members) and the \"Council of State\" ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e36\u0e01\u0e29\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e41\u0e1c\u0e48\u0e19\u0e14\u0e34\u0e19}}; {{rtgs|''sapha thi prueksa ratchakan phaendin''}}) (12 members, name later changed to \"Council of Ministers\" ({{lang-th|\u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32}}; {{rtgs|''ratthamontrisapha''}})). The privy council was created to deal with legislative affairs while the latter became an early version of the [[Cabinet of Thailand|cabinet]].\n\nChulalongkorn was succeeded by his son King [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI) in 1910, who at the beginning of his reign appointed a 40-member \"Privy Council of State\" ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32\u0e01\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35}}; {{rtgs|''sapha kammakan ongkhamontri''}}). The king, during his 15 years on the throne, would continue to appoint new members at [[Thai New Year]] (or 4 April). When he died in 1925 the privy council was composed of 233 members.\n\nKing [[Prajadhipok]] (Rama VII) who succeeded his brother in 1925, completely overhauled the system and created instead three councils: The \"[[Supreme Council of State of Siam]]\" ({{lang-th|\u0e2d\u0e20\u0e34\u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32}}; {{rtgs|''aphiratthamontrisapha''}}) (composed of five senior princes, equivalent to the former Council of State); The \"Council of Secretaries\" ({{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e14\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32}}; {{rtgs|''senabodisapha''}}) (former Council of Ministers); and the Privy Council of State. The role of the Privy Council was relegated to minor legislative affairs, while the Supreme Council became Prajadhipok's main body of advisors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kanchanapisek.or.th/ohmpc/history.en.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209084550/http://kanchanapisek.or.th/ohmpc/history.en.php |archivedate=2009-02-09 }}</ref>\n\nOn 24 June 1932, a group calling themselves the [[Khana Ratsadon]] (or People's Party), together with the military, [[Siamese revolution of 1932|seized power in Bangkok]]. They abolished the system of absolute monarchy, changing Siam into a parliamentary [[constitutional monarchy]] and demanding of Prajadhipok a constitution for the people of Siam. The king granted them a \"temporary\" constitution in the same month and a permanent one in December. The Khana Ratsadon, once in power, abolished the Supreme Council and the Privy Council. They replaced the Council of Secretaries with the [[People's Committee of Siam]].\n\nIt was not until fifteen years later that the 1947 constitution of Siam recreated the Privy Council under King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]], with a name change to \"Supreme Council of State\" ({{lang-th|\u0e04\u0e13\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e20\u0e34\u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35}}; {{rtgs|''khana aphiratthamontri''}}). This council existed from 1947 to 1949 and was composed of:\n[[File:Rama IX at a meeting of the Privy Council.jpg|thumb|[[King Rama IX]] at a meeting of the Privy Council in 1953]]\n* Prince [[Rangsit Prayurasakdi]], Prince of Chainat, President of the council\n* Prince [[Dhani Nivat]], Prince Bidyalabh Bridhyakon\n* Prince [[Alongkot]], Prince Adisorn Udomsak\n* Phraya Manavaratsevi (Plod Vichear na Songkhla)\n* Police General Adul Aduldejjarus\n\nTwo years later, under the 1949 Constitution of Thailand, the council was renamed the \"Privy Council of Thailand\" ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35}}; {{rtgs|''sapha ongkhamontri''}}) or ({{lang-th|\u0e04\u0e13\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35}}; {{rtgs|''khana ongkhamontri''}}). The Privy Council in its current form was created by the [[2017 Constitution of Thailand]].\n\n==Members==\nThe present constitution stipulated that the council is composed of no more than eighteen members. The members of the Privy Council or Privy Councillors are appointed and removed at the pleasure of the king alone, but appointments must be countersigned by the President of the Privy Council.<ref>[http://www.senate.go.th/eng/T-E_Senate/E_T_02.htm Constitution of Thailand] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070628200818/http://www.senate.go.th/eng/T-E_Senate/E_T_02.htm |date=2007-06-28 }}</ref>\n\nThe councillors cannot be partisan and therefore cannot be members of the [[House of Representatives of Thailand|House of Representatives]], [[Senate of Thailand]], [[Election Commission (Thailand)|Election Commission]], [[Ombudsman]], member of the [[National Human Rights Commission (Thailand)|National Human Rights Commission]], judge of the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]], judge of an Administrative Court, member of the National Counter Corruption Commission, member of the State Audit Commission, a government official holding a permanent position or receiving a permanent salary, an official of a state enterprise, other state official or holder of other position of member or official of a political party, and must not manifest loyalty to any [[List of political parties in Thailand|political party]]. Privy councillors are not prohibited from sitting on the boards of influential companies and, under Prem, some councillors are board members of [[Bangkok Bank]], [[Charoen Pokphand]], the [[Boon Rawd Brewery|Boonrawd group]], and the Charoen Siriwatanapakdi business group.<ref name=\"Diplomat-20181012\" />\n\nAfter being appointed the councilors must take the following oath in the presence of the king to assume office:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"I, (name of the declarer), do solemnly declare that I will be loyal to His Majesty the King and will faithfully perform my duties in the interests of the country and of the people. I will also uphold and observe the Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand in every respect.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nA councillor vacates office upon death, resignation, or at royal command.\n\n===President===\nThe President of the Privy Council of Thailand is the head and chief councillor of the privy council. The king retains the power to appoint and remove the president, however the President of the [[National Assembly of Thailand]] must countersign presidential appointments and removals, unlike other councillors which the king alone decides.\n\n==Functions==\n{{Politics of Thailand}}\nThe 2017 Constitution gave the privy council many roles and powers. These are mostly associated with the issues surrounding the head of state and the monarchy. A US ambassador described its duties thus, \"Statutorily they exist to offer advice to the King if he solicits it, review petitions on his behalf, act as ceremonial stand-ins for the King at various royally-sponsored ceremonies, and play a critical role in succession.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=John|first1=Eric G|title=Thailand: Circles of Influence Inside the Institution of the Monarchy in King Bhumibol's Twilight| url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09BANGKOK2967_a.html| website=Wikileaks|publisher=US Embassy|accessdate=17 October 2016|ref=09BANGKOK2967_a|location=Bangkok|page=22|date=2009-11-23}}</ref>\n\n===Regency===\n{{main|Regent of Thailand}}\nIf the king is incapacitated or for whatever reason and cannot appoint a [[regent]], the privy council will submit to the National Assembly the name of a suitable individual, who must then be approved by a vote. During the period where there is no regent the President of the Privy Council shall be the regent [[pro tempore]]. This case is also applicable if the regent is incapacitated and cannot perform his duties. When this happens the President of the Privy Council shall be replaced in his duties to the council by a president pro tempore.\n\n===Palace Law of Succession===\nIn regards to the amendment of the [[1924 Palace Law of Succession]], the king must ask the privy council to draft an amendment. After the king's approval and signature, the President of the Privy Council will notify the president of the National Assembly that will then countersign such amendment.\n\n===Vacancy on the throne===\nWhen the throne becomes vacant it is the duty of the privy council to submit to the cabinet and to the [[National Assembly of Thailand|National Assembly]] the name of the successor to the throne. During this vacancy period (before the submission) the President of the Privy Council will be the regent pro tempore.\n\n===Other functions===\nApart from these constitutionally mandated functions the privy councillors also perform other duties. For instance, they carry out other duties in the royal household and on royal projects. Several councillors are members of the Mahidol Foundation, while Dr. Chaovana Nasylvanta is the Director of the [[Crown Property Bureau]]. Councillors can, at royal command, attend official functions or carry out official duties on behalf of the king or the [[Chakri Dynasty|royal family]].\n\n== List of presidents of the Privy Council==\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!  ||Name|| Dates as President\n|-\n| 1 || Prince [[Dhani Nivat]] || 18 June 1949 \u2013 25 March 1950\n|-\n| 2 || Prince [[Rangsit Prayurasakdi]] || 25 March 1950 \u2013 7 March 1951\n|-\n| 3 || Prince [[Alongkot]] || 13 March 1951 \u2013 29 November 1951\n|-\n| \u2013 || [[Jit na Songkhla]] || 27 May 1963 \u2013 14 July 1963\n|-\n| 4 || M.L.

The king, educated by Westerners, was keen on copying the system of government of the absolute monarchs of Europe. At first he created two councils: the \"Privy Council of Siam\" ({{lang-th|\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e1b\u0e24\u0e01\u0e29\u0e32\u0e43\u0e19\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e4c}}; {{rtgs|''thi prueksa nai phra ong''}}) (49 members) and the \"Council of State\" ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e36\u0e01\u0e29\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e41\u0e1c\u0e48\u0e19\u0e14\u0e34\u0e19}}; {{rtgs|''sapha thi prueksa ratchakan phaendin''}}) (12 members, name later changed to \"Council of Ministers\" ({{lang-th|\u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32}}; {{rtgs|''ratthamontrisapha''}})). The privy council was created to deal with legislative affairs while the latter became an early version of the [[Cabinet of Thailand|cabinet]].\n\nChulalongkorn was succeeded by his son King [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI) in 1910, who at the beginning of his reign appointed a 40-member \"Privy Council of State\" ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32\u0e01\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35}}; {{rtgs|''sapha kammakan ongkhamontri''}}). The king, during his 15 years on the throne, would continue to appoint new members at [[Thai New Year]] (or 4 April). When he died in 1925 the privy council was composed of 233 members.\n\nKing [[Prajadhipok]] (Rama VII) who succeeded his brother in 1925, completely overhauled the system and created instead three councils: The \"[[Supreme Council of State of Siam]]\" ({{lang-th|\u0e2d\u0e20\u0e34\u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32}}; {{rtgs|''aphiratthamontrisapha''}}) (composed of five senior princes, equivalent to the former Council of State); The \"Council of Secretaries\" ({{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e14\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32}}; {{rtgs|''senabodisapha''}}) (former Council of Ministers); and the Privy Council of State.

They abolished the system of absolute monarchy, changing Siam into a parliamentary [[constitutional monarchy]] and demanding of Prajadhipok a constitution for the people of Siam. The king granted them a \"temporary\" constitution in the same month and a permanent one in December. The Khana Ratsadon, once in power, abolished the Supreme Council and the Privy Council. They replaced the Council of Secretaries with the [[People's Committee of Siam]].\n\nIt was not until fifteen years later that the 1947 constitution of Siam recreated the Privy Council under King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]], with a name change to \"Supreme Council of State\" ({{lang-th|\u0e04\u0e13\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e20\u0e34\u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35}}; {{rtgs|''khana aphiratthamontri''}}). This council existed from 1947 to 1949 and was composed of:\n[[File:Rama IX at a meeting of the Privy Council.jpg|thumb|[[King Rama IX]] at a meeting of the Privy Council in 1953]]\n* Prince [[Rangsit Prayurasakdi]], Prince of Chainat, President of the council\n* Prince [[Dhani Nivat]], Prince Bidyalabh Bridhyakon\n* Prince [[Alongkot]], Prince Adisorn Udomsak\n* Phraya Manavaratsevi (Plod Vichear na Songkhla)\n* Police General Adul Aduldejjarus\n\nTwo years later, under the 1949 Constitution of Thailand, the council was renamed the \"Privy Council of Thailand\" ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e20\u0e32\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35}}; {{rtgs|''sapha ongkhamontri''}}) or ({{lang-th|\u0e04\u0e13\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35}}; {{rtgs|''khana ongkhamontri''}}). The Privy Council in its current form was created by the [[2017 Constitution of Thailand]].\n\n==Members==\nThe present constitution stipulated that the council is composed of no more than eighteen members. The members of the Privy Council or Privy Councillors are appointed and removed at the pleasure of the king alone, but appointments must be countersigned by the President of the Privy Council.<ref>[http://www.senate.go.th/eng/T-E_Senate/E_T_02.htm Constitution of Thailand] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070628200818/http://www.senate.go.th/eng/T-E_Senate/E_T_02.htm |date=2007-06-28 }}</ref>\n\nThe councillors cannot be partisan and therefore cannot be members of the [[House of Representatives of Thailand|House of Representatives]], [[Senate of Thailand]], [[Election Commission (Thailand)|Election Commission]], [[Ombudsman]], member of the [[National Human Rights Commission (Thailand)|National Human Rights Commission]], judge of the [[Constitutional Court of Thailand|Constitutional Court]], judge of an Administrative Court, member of the National Counter Corruption Commission, member of the State Audit Commission, a government official holding a permanent position or receiving a permanent salary, an official of a state enterprise, other state official or holder of other position of member or official of a political party, and must not manifest loyalty to any [[List of political parties in Thailand|political party]]. Privy councillors are not prohibited from sitting on the boards of influential companies and, under Prem, some councillors are board members of [[Bangkok Bank]], [[Charoen Pokphand]], the [[Boon Rawd Brewery|Boonrawd group]], and the Charoen Siriwatanapakdi business group.<ref name=\"Diplomat-20181012\" />\n\nAfter being appointed the councilors must take the following oath in the presence of the king to assume office:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"I, (name of the declarer), do solemnly declare that I will be loyal to His Majesty the King and will faithfully perform my duties in the interests of the country and of the people. I will also uphold and observe the Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand in every respect.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nA councillor vacates office upon death, resignation, or at royal command.\n\n===President===\nThe President of the Privy Council of Thailand is the head and chief councillor of the privy council. The king retains the power to appoint and remove the president, however the President of the [[National Assembly of Thailand]] must countersign presidential appointments and removals, unlike other councillors which the king alone decides.\n\n==Functions==\n{{Politics of Thailand}}\nThe 2017 Constitution gave the privy council many roles and powers. These are mostly associated with the issues surrounding the head of state and the monarchy. A US ambassador described its duties thus, \"Statutorily they exist to offer advice to the King if he solicits it, review petitions on his behalf, act as ceremonial stand-ins for the King at various royally-sponsored ceremonies, and play a critical role in succession.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=John|first1=Eric G|title=Thailand: Circles of Influence Inside the Institution of the Monarchy in King Bhumibol's Twilight| url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09BANGKOK2967_a.html| website=Wikileaks|publisher=US Embassy|accessdate=17 October 2016|ref=09BANGKOK2967_a|location=Bangkok|page=22|date=2009-11-23}}</ref>\n\n===Regency===\n{{main|Regent of Thailand}}\nIf the king is incapacitated or for whatever reason and cannot appoint a [[regent]], the privy council will submit to the National Assembly the name of a suitable individual, who must then be approved by a vote. During the period where there is no regent the President of the Privy Council shall be the regent [[pro tempore]]. This case is also applicable if the regent is incapacitated and cannot perform his duties. When this happens the President of the Privy Council shall be replaced in his duties to the council by a president pro tempore.\n\n===Palace Law of Succession===\nIn regards to the amendment of the [[1924 Palace Law of Succession]], the king must ask the privy council to draft an amendment. After the king's approval and signature, the President of the Privy Council will notify the president of the National Assembly that will then countersign such amendment.\n\n===Vacancy on the throne===\nWhen the throne becomes vacant it is the duty of the privy council to submit to the cabinet and to the [[National Assembly of Thailand|National Assembly]] the name of the successor to the throne. During this vacancy period (before the submission) the President of the Privy Council will be the regent pro tempore.\n\n===Other functions===\nApart from these constitutionally mandated functions the privy councillors also perform other duties. For instance, they carry out other duties in the royal household and on royal projects. Several councillors are members of the Mahidol Foundation, while Dr. Chaovana Nasylvanta is the Director of the [[Crown Property Bureau]]. Councillors can, at royal command, attend official functions or carry out official duties on behalf of the king or the [[Chakri Dynasty|royal family]].\n\n== List of presidents of the Privy Council==\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!  ||Name|| Dates as President\n|-\n| 1 || Prince [[Dhani Nivat]] || 18 June 1949 \u2013 25 March 1950\n|-\n| 2 || Prince [[Rangsit Prayurasakdi]] || 25 March 1950 \u2013 7 March 1951\n|-\n| 3 || Prince [[Alongkot]] || 13 March 1951 \u2013 29 November 1951\n|-\n| \u2013 || [[Jit na Songkhla]] || 27 May 1963 \u2013 14 July 1963\n|-\n| 4 || M.L.

The album goes in a different direction from their previous work ''[[War Child (album)|War Child]]'' (1974), with the orchestration being replaced by a [[string quartet]] conducted by [[David Palmer (musician)|David Palmer]]. The band also returned to the blend of electric and acoustic pieces, in a manner closer to their early '70s albums such as ''[[Benefit (album)|Benefit]]'' (1970), ''[[Aqualung (Jethro Tull album)|Aqualung]]'' (1971) and ''[[Thick as a Brick]]'' (1972), and for the first time since their two [[concept albums]] of ''Thick as a Brick'' (1972) and ''[[A Passion Play]]'' (1973), they recorded a song of more than ten minutes, which occupies almost all of the second side of the record.<ref name=\"allmusic.com\"/><ref name=\"jethrotull.com\">{{cite web|url=http://jethrotull.com/?portfolio=minstrel-in-the-gallery |title=Jethro Tull \u2013 ''Minstrel in the Gallery'' (5 September 1975)|publisher=JethroTull.com |date=1975-09-05 |accessdate=2015-05-01}}</ref>\n\nIt would be the last album to feature bassist [[Jeffrey Hammond]], who was replaced by former [[Carmen (band)|Carmen]] bass player [[John Glascock]].\n\n==Recording==\n\nThe band recorded the album in the Maison Rouge Mobile Studio, in Monaco. They recorded \"Minstrel in the Gallery\", \"Cold Wind to Valhalla\", \"Black Satin Dancer\" and \"One White Duck/0<sup>10</sup>= Nothing at All\" on 15 May 1975, \"Baker St. Muse\" and \"Grace\" on 18 May, and finally \"Requiem\" on 7 June 1975.\n\n==Production==\nIan Anderson thought that the band was unfocused in the making of the music, leaving him with more freedom to explore the melodies and themes. ''Minstrel in the Gallery's'' lyrics and subject matter do show an introspective and cynical air, possibly the byproduct of Anderson's recent divorce from first wife [[Jennie Franks]] and the pressures of touring, coupled with the frustrations of writing for and recording the album in Monaco.<ref name=\"jethrotull.com\"/>\n\n==Musical styles and themes==\nThe album's title refers to the use of a [[minstrel's gallery]] in the [[great hall]] of [[castle]]s or [[manor house]]s. This analogy was used thematically in the opening [[spoken words]] of the title track, \"Cold Wind to Valhalla\" and \"Baker St. Muse\" and also in the song's lyrics, always in a [[First person narrative|first-person]] manner.\n\nStylistically the album is varied, exemplary of Jethro Tull's best [[hard rock]] performances, with long instrumental passages, invested with elements of British folk and archaic, pre-Elizabethan sounds.<ref name=\"allmusic.com\"/> Team Rock called ''Minstrel in the Gallery'''s musical style a \"heavy metal take on the obsessively ornamented style of ''A Passion Play''\".<ref>[http://www.teamrock.com/reviews/2015-04-17/jethro-tull-minstrel-in-the-gallery-40th-anniversary-la-grande-ed?identifier=726576696577-552f84482581f5.01551846 Jethro Tull \u2013 ''Minstrel in the Gallery'' (1975/2015 La Grande Edition) album review by Mike Barnes at TeamRock.com]</ref>\n\n==Releases==\n''Minstrel in the Gallery'' was [[remaster]]ed with five additional [[hidden track|bonus tracks]] in November 2002, including incomplete live-in-the-studio renditions of \"Minstrel in the Gallery\" and \"Cold Wind to Valhalla\", some tracks that appeared only on maxi-singles (\"Pan Dance\", \"March the Mad Scientist\") and \"Summerday Sands\" which was the B-side of the \"Minstrel in the Gallery\" single.\n\nIn 2015, commemorating the 40th anniversary of ''Minstrel in the Gallery'', it was released as a box set with two CDs and two DVDs, named ''La Grande Edition''. The box contains rare and previously unreleased tracks (such as alternate takes from \"Requiem\", \"Grace\" and \"One White Duck\") including new stereo mixes by [[Steven Wilson]] and a live presentation, from 1975 in [[Palais des Sports (Paris)|Palais des Sports]], remixed by [[Jakko Jakszyk]].

Analysing the music, it said: \"Martin Barre's attack on the guitar is as ferocious as anything in the band's history, and [[John Evan]]'s organ matches him amp for amp, while [[Barriemore Barlow]] and Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond hold things together in a furious performance. Anderson's flair for drama and melody come to the fore in \"Cold Wind to Valhalla,\" and \"Requiem\" is perhaps the loveliest acoustic number in Tull's repertoire, featuring nothing but Anderson's singing and acoustic guitar, Hammond-Hammond's bass, and a small string orchestra backing them\".<ref name=\"allmusic.com\"/>\n\n==Charts==\n''Minstrel in the Gallery'' received Gold Certification in both the United States and the UK and is the ninth best selling Jethro Tull album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tsort.info/music/bhb4n0.htm |title=Worldwide album charts of Jethro Tull albums |publisher=Tsort.info |date= |accessdate=2015-05-01}}</ref> The album peaked at No. 7 on the [[Billboard 200|Billboard album chart]], and at No. 20 in the [[UK Albums Chart]] \u2013 ''[[Songs from the Wood]]'' would sell better two years later in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/Minstrel%20In%20The%20Gallery |title=Official Charts Company of Jethro Tull \u2013 ''Minstrel in the Gallery'' (1975) |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=14 December 2011}} [Dead Link]</ref> It also charted in Norway, reaching No. 13, and Austria, where it reached also No. 7, and in Sweden where it reached the No. 50 spot.

The album goes in a different direction from their previous work ''[[War Child (album)|War Child]]'' (1974), with the orchestration being replaced by a [[string quartet]] conducted by [[David Palmer (musician)|David Palmer]]. The band also returned to the blend of electric and acoustic pieces, in a manner closer to their early '70s albums such as ''[[Benefit (album)|Benefit]]'' (1970), ''[[Aqualung (Jethro Tull album)|Aqualung]]'' (1971) and ''[[Thick as a Brick]]'' (1972), and for the first time since their two [[concept albums]] of ''Thick as a Brick'' (1972) and ''[[A Passion Play]]'' (1973), they recorded a song of more than ten minutes, which occupies almost all of the second side of the record.<ref name=\"allmusic.com\"/><ref name=\"jethrotull.com\">{{cite web|url=http://jethrotull.com/?portfolio=minstrel-in-the-gallery |title=Jethro Tull \u2013 ''Minstrel in the Gallery'' (5 September 1975)|publisher=JethroTull.com |date=1975-09-05 |accessdate=2015-05-01}}</ref>\n\nIt would be the last album to feature bassist [[Jeffrey Hammond]], who was replaced by former [[Carmen (band)|Carmen]] bass player [[John Glascock]].\n\n==Recording==\n\nThe band recorded the album in the Maison Rouge Mobile Studio, in Monaco. They recorded \"Minstrel in the Gallery\", \"Cold Wind to Valhalla\", \"Black Satin Dancer\" and \"One White Duck/0<sup>10</sup>= Nothing at All\" on 15 May 1975, \"Baker St. Muse\" and \"Grace\" on 18 May, and finally \"Requiem\" on 7 June 1975.\n\n==Production==\nIan Anderson thought that the band was unfocused in the making of the music, leaving him with more freedom to explore the melodies and themes. ''Minstrel in the Gallery's'' lyrics and subject matter do show an introspective and cynical air, possibly the byproduct of Anderson's recent divorce from first wife [[Jennie Franks]] and the pressures of touring, coupled with the frustrations of writing for and recording the album in Monaco.<ref name=\"jethrotull.com\"/>\n\n==Musical styles and themes==\nThe album's title refers to the use of a [[minstrel's gallery]] in the [[great hall]] of [[castle]]s or [[manor house]]s. This analogy was used thematically in the opening [[spoken words]] of the title track, \"Cold Wind to Valhalla\" and \"Baker St. Muse\" and also in the songs lyrics, always in a [[First person narrative|first-person]] manner.\n\nStylistically the album is varied, exemplary of Jethro Tull's best [[hard rock]] performances, with long instrumental passages, invested with elements of British folk and archaic, pre-Elizabethan sounds.<ref name=\"allmusic.com\"/> Team Rock called ''Minstrel in the Gallery'''s musical style a \"heavy metal take on the obsessively ornamented style of ''A Passion Play''\".<ref>[http://www.teamrock.com/reviews/2015-04-17/jethro-tull-minstrel-in-the-gallery-40th-anniversary-la-grande-ed?identifier=726576696577-552f84482581f5.01551846 Jethro Tull \u2013 ''Minstrel in the Gallery'' (1975/2015 La Grande Edition) album review by Mike Barnes at TeamRock.com]</ref>\n\n==Releases==\n''Minstrel in the Gallery'' was [[remaster]]ed with five additional [[hidden track|bonus tracks]] in November 2002, including incomplete live-in-the-studio renditions of \"Minstrel in the Gallery\" and \"Cold Wind to Valhalla\", some tracks that appeared only on maxi-singles (\"Pan Dance\", \"March the Mad Scientist\") and \"Summerday Sands\" which was the B-side of the \"Minstrel in the Gallery\" single.\n\nIn 2015, commemorating the 40th anniversary of ''Minstrel in the Gallery'', it was released as a box set with two CDs and two DVDs, named ''La Grande Edition''. The box contains rare and previously unreleased tracks (such as alternate takes from \"Requiem\", \"Grace\" and \"One White Duck\") including new stereo mixes by [[Steven Wilson]] and a live presentation, from 1975 in [[Palais des Sports (Paris)|Palais des Sports]], remixed by [[Jakko Jakszyk]].

Analysing the music, it said: \"Martin Barre's attack on the guitar is as ferocious as anything in the band's history, and [[John Evan]]'s organ matches him amp for amp, while [[Barriemore Barlow]] and Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond hold things together in a furious performance. Anderson's flair for drama and melody come to the fore in \"Cold Wind to Valhalla,\" and \"Requiem\" is perhaps the loveliest acoustic number in Tull's repertoire, featuring nothing but Anderson's singing and acoustic guitar, Hammond-Hammond's bass, and a small string orchestra backing them\".<ref name=\"allmusic.com\"/>\n\n==Charts==\n''Minstrel in the Gallery'' received Gold Certification in both the United States and the UK and is the ninth best selling Jethro Tull album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tsort.info/music/bhb4n0.htm |title=Worldwide album charts of Jethro Tull albums |publisher=Tsort.info |date= |accessdate=2015-05-01}}</ref> The album peaked at No. 7 on the [[Billboard 200|Billboard album chart]], and at No. 20 in the [[UK Albums Chart]] \u2013 ''[[Songs from the Wood]]'' would sell better two years later in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/Minstrel%20In%20The%20Gallery |title=Official Charts Company of Jethro Tull \u2013 ''Minstrel in the Gallery'' (1975) |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=14 December 2011}} [Dead Link]</ref> It also charted in Norway, reaching No. 13, and Austria, where it reached also No. 7, and in Sweden where it reached the No. 50 spot.

Its name is allegedly based on [[scorpion]]s that once lived there, now represented in its flag. Its Catholic parish seat has traditionally been [[Mysl\u00edv]]. Surnames of the village reaching back to the 17th century include Liska, Popule, Cihla, Ciz, and Ticha.\n\n== Genealogy and Immigration to America ==\nSo far, about 88 people born in Nehodiv have been identified as immigrating to America, sorted and profiled on [[FamilySearch]], a high ratio given a population averaging around 300. The earliest [[Immigration|immigrant]] from the village was probably Josefa Zelena (1835-1892) with her husband from Mysliv, Jan Rada, and children who settled in [[Baltimore]] in 1869. She was followed by Josef Kle\u010dka (1852-1926) who arrived in 1870. There he married Marie Hrani\u010dkov\u00e1 (1851-1913) from [[Kv\u00e1\u0161\u0148ovice]]. Josef returned multiple times to visit his mother and siblings, perhaps encouraging other villagers to follow him.\n\nOther early immigrants include V\u00e1clav Kon\u010dal (1843-1925) who brought his wife Marie V\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (1844-1906) to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] around the same year. Never having biological children, the couple adopted V\u00e1clav's brother son V\u00e1clav and Marie's sister's daughter Josefa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M93F-QVF|title=United States Census, 1900|last=Konchal|first=|date=|website=FamilySearch|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA significant number of the immigrants share a [[Genetic testing|DNA]] and blood relation via children of the couple Krystof Sramek (1700-1767) and Katerina Hithova (1705-1760) from Klikarov, Vojovice, and [[Lou\u017en\u00e1|Louzna]] in the 18th century.\n\n* Katerina Sramkova (1727-1798) is the ancestor of the Kotesovec's and the Popule's.\n*Dorota Sramkova (1730-1796) is the ancestor of the Protova's, Blazek's, and Vojtech Zeleny (specifically).\n*Ondrej Sramek (1743-) is the great grandfather of the Poustkova sisters.

Its name is allegedly based on [[scorpion]]s that once lived there, now represented in its flag. Its Catholic parish seat has traditionally been [[Mysl\u00edv]]. Surnames of the village reaching back to the 17th century include Liska, Popule, Cihla, Ciz, and Ticha.\n\n== Genealogy and Immigration to America ==\nSo far, about 88 people born in Nehodiv have been identified as immigrating to America, sorted and profiled on [[FamilySearch]], a high ratio given a population averaging around 300. The earliest [[Immigration|immigrant]] from the village was probably Josefa Zelena (1835-1892) with her husband from Mysliv, Jan Rada, and children who settled in [[Baltimore]] in 1869. She was followed by Josef Kle\u010dka (1852-1926) who arrived in 1870. There he married Marie Hrani\u010dkov\u00e1 (1851-1913) from [[Kv\u00e1\u0161\u0148ovice]]. Josef returned multiple times to visit his mother and siblings, perhaps encouraging other villagers to follow him.\n\nOther early immigrants include V\u00e1clav Kon\u010dal (1843-1925) who brought his wife Marie V\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (1844-1906) to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] around the same year. Never having biological children, the couple adopted V\u00e1clav's brother son V\u00e1clav and Marie's sister's daughter Josefa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:M93F-QVF|title=United States Census, 1900|last=Konchal|first=|date=|website=FamilySearch|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA significant number of the immigrants share a [[Genetic testing|DNA]] and blood relation via children of the couple Krystof Sramek (1700-1767) and Katerina Hithova (1705-1760) from Klikarov, Vojovice, and [[Lou\u017en\u00e1|Louzna]] in the 18th century.\n\n* Katerina Sramkova (1727-1798) is the ancestor of the Kotesovec's and the Popule's.\n*Dorota Sramkova (1730-1796) is the ancestor of the Protova's, Blazek's, and Vojtech Zeleny (specifically).\n*Ondrej Sramek (1743-) is the great grandfather of the Poustkova sisters.

Since the mid-19th century, most conductors have not played an instrument when conducting, although in earlier periods of [[classical music]] history, leading an ensemble while playing an instrument was common. In [[Baroque music]] from the 1600s to the 1750s, the group would typically be led by the [[harpsichord]]ist or first violinist (see [[concertmaster]]), an approach that in modern times has been revived by several music directors for music from this period. Conducting while playing a [[piano]] or [[synthesizer]] may also be done with [[musical theatre]] [[pit orchestra]]s. Communication is typically non-verbal during a performance (this is strictly the case in [[art music]], but in jazz big bands or large pop ensembles, there may be occasional spoken instructions, such as a \"count in\"). However, in rehearsals, frequent interruptions allow the conductor to give verbal directions as to how the music should be played or sung.\n\nConductors act as guides to the orchestras or choirs they conduct. They choose the works to be performed and study their [[sheet music|scores]], to which they may make certain adjustments (such as in tempo, articulation, phrasing, repetitions of sections), work out their interpretation, and relay their vision to the performers. They may also attend to organizational matters, such as scheduling rehearsals,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-a-conductor-2456662|title=The Conductor|author=Espie Estrella|date=6 March 2017|website=thoughtco.com|accessdate=9 March 2018}}</ref> planning a concert season, hearing [[audition]]s and selecting members, and promoting their ensemble in the media.

Conductors of [[concert band]]s, [[military band]]s, [[marching band]]s and other bands may hold the title of ''band director'', ''bandmaster'', or ''drum major''.

This has been practiced at least as far back as the [[Middle Ages]]. In the [[Christianity|Christian]] church, the person giving these symbols held a [[Staff of office|staff]] to signify his role, and it seems that as music became [[rhythm]]ically more complex, the staff was moved up and down to indicate the beat, acting as an early form of [[Baton (conducting)|baton]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn the 17th century, other devices to indicate the passing of time came into use. Rolled sheets of paper, smaller sticks and unadorned hands are all shown in pictures from this period. The large staff was responsible for the death of [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], who injured his foot with one while conducting a ''[[Te Deum]]'' for the [[Louis XIV of France|king]]'s recovery from illness. The wound became [[gangrene|gangrenous]] and Lully refused amputation, whereupon the gangrene spread to his leg and he died two months later.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[J\u00e9r\u00f4me de La Gorce]]|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/42477pg1?q=lully+gangrene&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1#firsthit|title=(1) Jean-Baptiste Lully (Lulli, Giovanni Battista) (i)|work=[[Oxford Music Online]] (New Grove)|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2007|accessdate=8 October 2008}} {{Subscription required}}</ref>\n\nIn instrumental music throughout the 18th century, a member of the ensemble usually acted as the conductor. This was sometimes the [[concertmaster]], who could use his [[bow (music)|bow]] as a baton, or a [[lute]]nist who would move the neck of his instrument in time with the beat. It was common to conduct from the [[harpsichord]] in pieces that had a [[basso continuo]] part. In opera performances, there were sometimes two conductors, with the keyboard player in charge of the singers and the principal violinist or '''leader''' was in charge of the orchestra.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nOn Fri, 30 Sep 1791 in Vienna, [[Mozart]]'s opera ''Die Zauberfl\u00f6te'' (''[[The Magic Flute]]'') premiered at the [[Theater auf der Wieden]], with Mozart himself conducting the orchestra, according to documents and publicity posters from that time.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Edge |first1=Dexter |title=The earliest published report on the premiere of Die Zauberfl\u00f6te (1 Oct 1791) |url=https://sites.google.com/site/mozartdocuments/documents/1791-10-01 |website=Mozart: New Documents |publisher=Dexter Edge and David Black |accessdate=25 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1798, [[Joseph Haydn]] conducted the premiere of ''[[The Creation (Haydn)|Creation]]'' with his hands and a baton while \"[[Joseph Weigl|Kapellmeister Weigl]] [sat] at the fortepiano.\"<ref>[[H.

While some orchestras protested the introduction of the conductor, since they were used to having a concertmaster or keyboard player act as leader, eventually the role of a conductor was established. The size of the usual orchestra expanded during this period, and the use of a baton became more common, as it was easier to see than bare hands or rolled-up paper. Among the earliest notable conductors were [[Louis Spohr]], [[Carl Maria von Weber]], [[Louis-Antoine Jullien]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn]], all of whom were also composers. Mendelssohn is claimed to have been the first conductor to utilize a wooden baton to keep time, a practice still generally in use in the 2010s. Prominent conductors who did not or do not use a baton include [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Kurt Masur]], [[James Conlon]], [[Yuri Temirkanov]],<ref>Libbey, Theodore (2006).

Pendragon. {{ISBN|9780918728470}}.</ref>\n\nThe composers [[Hector Berlioz]] and [[Richard Wagner]] attained greatness as conductors, and they wrote two of the earliest essays dedicated to the subject. Berlioz is considered the first virtuoso conductor. Wagner was largely responsible for shaping the conductor's role as one who imposes his own view of a piece onto the performance rather than one who is just responsible for ensuring entries are made at the right time and that there is a unified beat. Predecessors who focused on conducting include [[Fran\u00e7ois Habeneck]], who founded the [[Orchestre de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des concerts du Conservatoire]] in 1828, though Berlioz was later to be alarmed at Habeneck's loose standards of rehearsal. Pianist and composer [[Franz Liszt]] was also a conductor.\n\nWagner's one-time champion [[Hans von B\u00fclow]] (1830\u20131894) was particularly celebrated as a conductor, although he also maintained his initial career as a pianist, an instrument on which he was regarded as among the greatest performers (he was a prized piano student of [[Franz Liszt]], whose daughter [[Cosima Wagner|Cosima]] he married \u2013 although she was to abandon him for Wagner. Liszt was a major figure in the history of conducting, who attained remarkable performances).\n\nB\u00fclow raised the technical standards of conducting to an unprecedented level through such innovations as separate, detailed rehearsals of different sections of the orchestra (\"sectional rehearsal\"). In his posts as head of (sequentially) the [[Bavarian State Opera]], [[Meiningen Court Orchestra]], and [[Berlin Philharmonic]] he brought a level of nuance and subtlety to orchestral performance previously heard only in solo instrumental playing, and in doing so made a profound impression on young artists like [[Richard Strauss]], who at the age of 20 served as his assistant, and [[Felix Weingartner]], who came to disapprove of his interpretations but was deeply impressed by his orchestral standards. Composer [[Gustav Mahler]] was also a noted conductor.\n\n===20th century===\nTechnical standards were brought to new levels by the next generation of conductors, including [[Arthur Nikisch]] (1855\u20131922), who succeeded B\u00fclow as music director of the Berlin Philharmonic in 1895. Nikisch had previously served as head of the [[Leipzig Opera]], [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]], and [[Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra]], and was to serve as music director of the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]. Nikisch premiered important works by [[Anton Bruckner]] and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], who greatly admired his work; [[Johannes Brahms]], after hearing him conduct his [[Symphony No. 4 (Brahms)|Fourth Symphony]], said it was \"quite exemplary, it's impossible to hear it any better.\"\n\nNikisch took the London Symphony Orchestra on tour through the United States in April 1912, the first American tour by a European orchestra. He also made one of the earliest [[Sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] of a complete symphony: the [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven Fifth]] with the Berlin Philharmonic in November 1913. Nikisch was also the first conductor to have his art captured on film \u2013 alas, silently. The film confirms reports that he made particularly mesmerizing use of eye contact and expression to communicate with an orchestra; such later conductors as [[Fritz Reiner]] stated that this aspect of his technique had a strong influence on their own.\n\nConductors of the generations after Nikisch often left extensive recorded evidence of their arts. Two particularly influential and widely recorded figures are often treated, somewhat inaccurately, as interpretive antipodes. They were the Italian conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]] (1867\u20131957) and the German conductor [[Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler]] (1886\u20131954). Toscanini played in orchestras under [[Giuseppe Verdi]] and made his debut conducting ''[[Aida]]'' in 1886, filling in at the last minute for an indisposed conductor. He is to this day regarded by such authorities as [[James Levine]] as the greatest of all Verdi conductors. But Toscanini's repertory was wide, and it was in his interpretations of the German symphonists Beethoven and Brahms that he was particularly renowned and influential, favoring stricter and faster tempi than a conductor like B\u00fclow or, before him, Wagner. Still, his style shows more inflection than his reputation may suggest, and he was particularly gifted at revealing detail and getting orchestras to play in a singing manner.\n\nFurtw\u00e4ngler, whom many regard as the greatest interpreter of Wagner (although Toscanini was also admired in this composer) and Bruckner, conducted Beethoven and Brahms with a good deal of inflection of tempo \u2013 but generally in a manner that revealed the structure and direction of the music particularly clearly. He was an accomplished composer as well as performer, and a disciple of the theorist [[Heinrich Schenker]], who emphasized concern for underlying long-range harmonic tensions and [[Resolution (music)|resolutions]] in a piece, a strength of Furtw\u00e4ngler's conducting. Along with his interest in the large-scale, Furtw\u00e4ngler also shaped the details of the piece in a particularly compelling and expressive manner.\n[[File:Holland Festival dirigent Leonard Bernstein zal het met het Concertgebouworkes, Bestanddeelnr 933-3400.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leonard Bernstein]] conducting the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]] in 1985]]\n\nThe two men had very different techniques: Toscanini's was Italianate, with a long, large baton and clear beats (often not using his left hand); Furtw\u00e4ngler beat time with less apparent precision, because he wanted a more rounded sound (although it is a myth that his technique was vague; many musicians have attested that he was easy to follow in his own way). In any event, their examples illustrate a larger point about conducting technique in the first half of the 20th century: it was not standardized. Great and influential conductors of the middle 20th century like [[Leopold Stokowski]] (1882\u20131977), [[Otto Klemperer]] (1885\u20131973), [[Herbert von Karajan]] (1908\u20131989) and [[Leonard Bernstein]] (1918\u20131990) \u2013 incidentally, the first American conductor to attain greatness and international fame \u2013 had widely varied techniques.\n\nKarajan and Bernstein formed another apparent antipode in the 1960s\u201380s, Karajan as music director of the Berlin Philharmonic (1955\u201389) and Bernstein as, for part of that period, music director of the [[New York Philharmonic]] (1957\u201369), and later frequent guest conductor in Europe. Karajan's technique was highly controlled, and eventually he conducted with his eyes often closed; Bernstein's technique was demonstrative, with highly expressive facial gestures and hand and body movements. Karajan could conduct for hours without moving his feet, while Bernstein was known at times to leap into the air at a great climax. As the music director of the Berlin Philharmonic, Karajan cultivated warm, blended beauty of tone, which has sometimes been criticized as too uniformly applied; by contrast, in Bernstein's only appearance with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1979 \u2013 performing Mahler's [[Symphony No. 9 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 9]] \u2013 he tried to get the orchestra to produce an \"ugly\" tone in a certain passage in which he believed it suited the expressive meaning of the music (the first horn player refused, and finally agreed to let an understudy play instead of himself).\n\nBoth Karajan and Bernstein made extensive use of advances in media to convey their art, but in tellingly different ways. Bernstein hosted major prime-time national television series to educate and reach out to children and the public at large about classical music; Karajan made a series of films late in his life, but in them, he did not talk. Both made numerous recordings, but their attitudes toward recording differed: Karajan frequently made new studio recordings to take advantage of advances in recording technique, which fascinated him \u2013 he played a role in setting the specifications of the compact disc \u2013 but Bernstein, in his post-New York days, came to insist on (for the most part) live concert recordings, believing that music-making did not come to life in a studio without an audience.\n\nIn the last third of the 20th century, conducting technique \u2013 particularly with the right hand and the baton \u2013 became increasingly standardized. Conductors like [[Willem Mengelberg]] in Amsterdam until the end of World War II had had extensive rehearsal time to mold orchestras very precisely, and thus could have idiosyncratic techniques; modern conductors, who spend less time with any given orchestra, must get results with much less rehearsal time. A more standardized technique allows communication to be much more rapid. Nonetheless, conductors' techniques still show a great deal of variety, particularly with the use of the left hand, facial and eye expression, and body language.\n\n===21st century===\n[[File:full score.jpg|thumb|Conductor's score and batons on a lit, extra-large conductor's music stand]]\n[[Women in music#Conducting|Women conductors]] were almost unheard of in the ranks of leading orchestral conductors through most of the 19th and 20th centuries, but today, artists like {{interlanguage link|Hortense von Gelmini|de}},<ref>David Mutch: \"The gathering critical judgement of Hortense von Gelmini, Germany's only woman conductor, is that she has not only the talent but the education, energy, and persistance to make her mark in this difficult and competitive profession\" \u2013 1976 in: ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' {{Full citation needed|date=October 2017}}</ref> [[Marin Alsop]] and [[Simone Young]] are to be seen conducting leading orchestras.

Although there are many formal rules on how to conduct correctly, others are subjective, and a wide variety of different conducting styles exist depending upon the training and sophistication of the conductor. The primary responsibilities of the conductor are to unify performers, set the tempo, execute clear preparations and beats, listen critically and shape the sound of the ensemble, and to control the interpretation and pacing of the music. Communication is non-verbal during a performance, however in [[rehearsal]] frequent interruptions allow directions as to how the music should be played. During rehearsals, the conductor may stop the playing of a piece to request changes in the phrasing or request a change in the timbre of a certain section. In amateur orchestras, the rehearsals are often stopped to draw the musicians' attentions to performance errors or transposition mistakes.\n\nConducting requires an understanding of the elements of musical expression ([[tempo]], [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[Articulation (music)|articulation]]) and the ability to communicate them effectively to an ensemble. The ability to communicate nuances of [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]] and expression through gestures is also beneficial. Conducting gestures are preferably prepared beforehand by the conductor while studying the [[sheet music|score]], but may sometimes be spontaneous.\n\nA distinction is sometimes made between orchestral conducting and choral conducting. Typically, orchestral conductors use a [[baton (conducting)|baton]] more often than choral conductors. The grip of the baton varies from conductor to conductor.\n\n===Beat and tempo===\n<!--[[Ictus]] links directly here.-->\nAt the beginning of a piece of music, the conductor raises his hands (or hand if he only uses a single hand) to indicate that the piece is about to begin. This is a signal for the orchestra members to ready their instruments to be played or for the choristers to be ready and watching. The conductor then looks at the different sections of the orchestra (winds, strings, etc.) or choir to ensure that all the orchestra members are ready to play and choir members are ready. In some choral works, the conductor may signal to a pianist or organist to play a note or chord so that the choir members can determine their starting notes. Then the conductor gives one or more preparatory beats to commence the music. The preparatory beat before the orchestra or choir begins is the [[upbeat]]. The [[Beat (music)|beat]] of the music is typically indicated with the conductor's right hand, with or without a baton. The hand traces a shape in the air in every [[bar (music)|bar]] (measure) depending on the [[time signature]], indicating each beat with a change from downward to upward motion.<ref>{{Cite news|title=The Maestro's Mojo \u2013 Breaking Conductors' Down by Gesture and Body Part|first=Daniel J.|last=Wakin|date=6 April 2012|accessdate=26 April 2012|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/arts/music/breaking-conductors-down-by-gesture-and-body-part.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> The images show the most common beat patterns, as seen from the conductor's point of view.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe [[Beat (music)#Downbeat|downbeat]] indicates the first beat of the bar, and the [[upbeat]] indicates the beat before the first note of the piece and the last beat of the bar. The instant at which the beat occurs is called the ''[[Wikt:ictus|ictus]]'' (plural: ''{{lang|la|ict\u016bs}}'' or ''ictuses''), and is usually indicated by a sudden (though not necessarily large) click of the wrist or change in baton direction. In some instances, \"ictus\" is also used to refer to a horizontal plane in which all the ictuses are physically located, such as the top of a [[music stand]] where a baton is tapped at each ictus. The gesture leading up to the ictus is called the \"preparation\", and the continuous flow of steady beats is called the \"{{lang|de|takt}}\" (the German word for bar, measure and beat).\n\nIf the [[tempo]] is slow or slowing, or if the [[time signature]] is [[Metre (music)#Compound metre|compound]], a conductor will sometimes indicate \"subdivisions\" of the beats. The conductor can do this by adding a smaller movement in the same direction as the movement for the beat that it belongs to.<!---I can't find the words to make this more clear right now, but I don't think this is clear or understandable to the layman yet---not just quadruple metre--->\n\nChanges to the tempo are indicated by changing the speed of the beat. To carry out and to control a [[rallentando]] (slowing down the pace of the music), a conductor may introduce beat subdivisions.\n\nWhile some conductors use both hands to indicate the beat, with the left hand mirroring the right, formal education discourages such an approach. The second hand can be used for [[Musical cue|cueing]] the entrances of individual players or sections, and to aid indications of dynamics, phrasing, expression, and other elements.\n\nDuring an instrumental solo section (or, in an opera orchestra during a vocalist's unaccompanied solo), some conductors stop counting out all the subdivisions and simply tap the baton down once per bar, to aid performers who are counting bars of rests.\n\nThere is a difference between the \"textbook\" definition of where the ictus of a downbeat occurs and the actual [[performance practice]] in professional orchestras. With an abrupt, loud [[Dynamics (music)#Sudden changes and accented notes|sforzando]] chord, a professional orchestra will often play slightly ''after'' the striking of the ictus point of the baton stroke.\n\n===Dynamics===\n[[dynamics (music)|Dynamics]] are indicated in various ways. The dynamic may be communicated by the size of the conducting movements, larger shapes representing louder sounds. Changes in dynamic may be signalled with the hand that is not being used to indicate the beat: an upward motion (usually palm-up) indicates a [[crescendo]]; a downward motion (usually palm-down) indicates a [[Dynamics (music)|diminuendo]]. Changing the size of conducting movements frequently results in changes in the character of the music depending upon the circumstances.\n\nDynamics can be fine-tuned using various gestures: showing one's palm to the performers or leaning away from them may demonstrate a decrease in volume. To adjust the overall balance of the various instruments or voices, these signals can be combined or directed toward a particular section or performer.\n\n===Cueing===\nThe indication of entries, when a performer or section should begin playing (perhaps after a long period of rests), is called \"cueing\". A cue must forecast with certainty the exact moment of the coming ictus, so that all the players or singers affected by the cue can begin playing simultaneously. Cueing is most important for cases where a performer or section has not been playing for a lengthy time. Cueing is also helpful in the case of a [[pedal point]] with string players, when a section has been playing the pedal point for a lengthy period; a cue is important to indicate when they should change to a new note. Cueing is achieved by \"engaging\" the players before their entry (by looking at them) and executing a clear preparation gesture, often directed toward the specific players. An inhalation, which may or may not be a semi-audible \"sniff\" from the conductor, is a common element in the cueing technique of some conductors. Mere eye contact or a look in the general direction of the players may be sufficient in many instances, as when more than one section of the ensemble enters at the same time. Larger musical events may warrant the use of a larger or more emphatic cue designed to encourage emotion and energy.\n\n===Other musical elements===\n[[File:US Navy 030228-N-5576W-002 Jazz great visits Navy.jpg|thumb|A conductor, [[Gerald Wilson]], leads a jazz [[big band]]]]\nArticulation may be indicated by the character of the ictus, ranging from short and sharp for [[staccato]], to long and fluid for [[legato]]. Many conductors change the tension of the hands: strained muscles and rigid movements may correspond to marcato, while relaxed hands and soft movements may correspond to legato or espressivo. Phrasing may be indicated by wide overhead arcs or by a smooth hand motion either forwards or side-to-side. A held note is often indicated by a hand held flat with palm up. The end of a note, called a \"cutoff\" or \"release\", may be indicated by a circular motion, the closing of the palm, or the pinching of finger and thumb. A release is usually preceded by a preparation and concluded with a complete stillness.\n\nConductors<!-- would a reference improve this? Strauss said (light-heartedly) \"never look at the brass, it only encourages them\", and Karajan sometimes conducted with his eyes closed --> aim to maintain eye contact with the ensemble as much as possible, encouraging eye contact in return and increasing the dialogue between players/singers and conductor. Facial expressions may also be important to demonstrate the character of the music or to encourage the players.\n\nIn some cases, such as where there has been little rehearsal time to prepare a piece, a conductor may discreetly indicate how the bars of music will be beat immediately before the start of the movement by holding up their fingers in front of their chest (so only the performers can see). For example, in a {{music|time|4|4}} piece that the conductor will beat \"in two\" (two ictus points or beats per bar, as if it were {{music|time|2|2}}), the conductor would hold up two fingers in front of his chest.\n\nIn most cases, there is a short pause between movements of a symphony, concerto or dance suite. This brief pause gives orchestra or choir members time to turn the pages of their part and ready themselves for the start of the next movement. String players may apply rosin or wipe sweat off their hands with a handkerchief. Reed players may take this time to change to a new reed. In some cases, woodwind or brass players will use the pause to switch to a different instrument (e.g., from trumpet to cornet or from clarinet to E{{music|b}} clarinet). If the conductor wishes to immediately begin one movement after another for musical reasons, this is called [[attacca]]. The conductor will instruct the orchestra members and choristers to write the term in their parts, so that they will be ready to go immediately to the next movement.\n\n==Roles==\n[[File:US Navy 060529-N-2383B-123 The U.S. Navy band performs during Memorial Day ceremonies held in the amphitheater of Arlington National Cemetery.jpg|thumb|A military conductor leads the U.S. Navy band during Memorial Day ceremonies held at Arlington National Cemetery.]]\nThe roles of a conductor vary a great deal between different conducting positions and different ensembles. In some cases, a conductor will also be the [[musical director]] of the symphony, choosing the program for the entire season, including concerts by guest conductors, concerto soloists, pop concerts, and so on. A senior conductor may attend some or all of the [[audition]]s for new members of the orchestra, to ensure that the candidates have the playing style and tone that the conductor prefers and that candidates meet the highest performance standards. Some choral conductors are hired to prepare a choir for several weeks which will subsequently be directed by another conductor. The choral conductor is usually acknowledged for their preparatory work in the concert program.\n\nSome conductors may have a significant public relations role, giving interviews to the local news channel and appearing on television talk shows to promote the upcoming season or particular concerts. On the other hand, a conductor hired to guest conduct a single concert may only have the responsibility of rehearsing the orchestra for several pieces and conducting one or two concerts. While a handful of conductors have become well-known [[celebrity|celebrities]], such as [[Leonard Bernstein]], most are only known within the classical music scene.\n\n==Training and education==\n[[Image:David Baker (far left) leading the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra.jpg|thumb|left|[[David Baker (composer)|David Baker]], a music educator, composer and conductor, (far left) leads the [[Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra]] during the [[NEA Jazz Masters]] awards ceremony and concert in 2008.]]\nClassical choral and instrumental conducting have established comprehensive systems of instruction and training. Aspiring conductors can study at colleges, conservatories, and universities. [[Music school|Conservatories]], which are the standard musical training system in France and in Quebec (Canada) provide lessons and amateur conducting experience. Universities offer a range of conducting programs, including courses in conducting as part of bachelor's degrees, a small number of Master of Music degrees in conducting, and an even smaller number of [[Doctor of Musical Arts]] degrees in conducting.\n\nIn addition, there are a variety of other training programs such as classical summer camps and training festivals, which give students the opportunity to conduct a wide range of music. Aspiring conductors need to obtain a broad education about the history of music, including the major periods of [[classical music]] and regarding [[music theory]]. Many conductors learn to play a keyboard instrument such as the [[piano]] or the [[pipe organ]], a skill that helps them to be able to analyze symphonies and try out their interpretations before they have access to an orchestra to conduct. Many conductors get experience playing in an orchestra or singing in a choir, an experience which gives them good insights into how orchestras and choirs are conducted and rehearsed.\n\nIn 2014, orchestra conductors typically hold a master's degree in music and choir conductors in the US typically hold a bachelor's degree in music.<ref name=\"bls.gov\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/entertainment-and-sports/mobile/music-directors-and-composers.htm|title=Music Directors and Composers : Occupational Outlook Handbook : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-08-19}}</ref> Bachelor's degrees (referred to as [[B.Mus.]] or B.M) are four-year programs that include conducting lessons, amateur orchestra experience, and a sequence of courses in music history, music theory, and liberal arts courses (e.g., English literature), which give the student a more well-rounded education. Students do not usually specialize in conducting at the B.Mus. stage; instead, they usually develop general music skills such as singing, playing an orchestral instrument, performing in a choir, playing in orchestra, and playing a keyboard instrument such as the piano or the organ.\n\nAnother topic that conducting students study is the languages used in Classical music opera. Orchestral conductors are expected to be able to rehearse and lead choirs in works for orchestra and choir. As such, orchestral conductors need to know the major languages used in choral writing (including French, Italian and Latin, among others) and they must understand the correct diction of these languages in a choral singing context. The opposite is also true: a choral conductor will be expected to rehearse and lead a string orchestra or full orchestra when performing works for choir and orchestra. As such, a choral conductor needs to know how to rehearse and lead instrument sections.\n\nMaster of music degrees ([[M.mus.]]) in conducting consist of private conducting lessons, ensemble experience, coaching, and graduate courses in music history and music theory, along with one or two conducted concerts. A Master's degree in music (referred to as an [[M.Mus.]] or M.M.) is often the required minimum credential for people who wish to become a professor of conducting.\n\n[[Doctor of Musical Arts]] (referred to as D.M.A., DMA, D.Mus.A. or A.Mus.D) degrees in conducting provide an opportunity for advanced study at the highest artistic and pedagogical level, requiring usually an additional 54+ credit hours beyond a master's degree (which is about 30+ credits beyond a bachelor's degree). For this reason, admission is highly selective. Examinations in music history, music theory, ear training/dictation, and an entrance examination and conducting audition are required. Students perform a number of conducted concerts, including a combination lecture-conducted concert with an accompanying doctoral dissertation, advanced coursework. Students must typically maintain a minimum B average. A DMA in conducting is a [[terminal degree]], and as such, it qualifies the holder to teach in colleges, universities and conservatories. In addition to academic study, another part of the training pathway for many conductors is conducting amateur orchestras, such as [[youth orchestra]]s, school orchestras and community orchestras.\n\nA small number of conductors become professionals without formal training in conducting. These individuals often have achieved renown as instrumental or vocal performers, and they have often undertaken a great deal of training in their area of expertise (instrumental performance or singing). Another way that a small number of conductors become professionals without formal training in conducting is by learning on the job by conducting amateur orchestras, school orchestras, and community orchestras (or the equivalent choral ensembles).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe average salary of conductors in the US in 2014 was $48,180. A 3% growth rate is forecast for conducting jobs from 2014 to 2024, a slower than average growth rate.<ref name=\"bls.gov\"/>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Conductorless orchestra]]\n*[[List of principal conductors by orchestra]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Harold Farberman]]: ''The Art of Conducting Technique'' (Alfred Music, Nov 27, 1999)\n* [[Michael Bowles]]: ''The Art of Conducting'' (Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1959); English edition as ''The Conductor: His Artistry and Craftsmanship'' (London: G.

Since the mid-19th century, most conductors have not played an instrument when conducting, although in earlier periods of [[classical music]] history, leading an ensemble while playing an instrument was common. In [[Baroque music]] from the 1600s to the 1750s, the group would typically be led by the [[harpsichord]]ist or first violinist (see [[concertmaster]]), an approach that in modern times has been revived by several music directors for music from this period. Conducting while playing a [[piano]] or [[synthesizer]] may also be done with [[musical theatre]] [[pit orchestra]]s. Communication is typically non-verbal during a performance (this is strictly the case in [[art music]], but in jazz big bands or large pop ensembles, there may be occasional spoken instructions, such as a \"count in\"). However, in rehearsals, frequent interruptions allow the conductor to give verbal directions as to how the music should be played or sung.\n\nConductors act as guides to the orchestras or choirs they conduct. They choose the works to be performed and study their [[sheet music|scores]], to which they may make certain adjustments (such as in tempo, articulation, phrasing, repetitions of sections), work out their interpretation, and relay their vision to the performers. They may also attend to organizational matters, such as scheduling rehearsals,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-a-conductor-2456662|title=The Conductor|author=Espie Estrella|date=6 March 2017|website=thoughtco.com|accessdate=9 March 2018}}</ref> planning a concert season, hearing [[audition]]s and selecting members, and promoting their ensemble in the media.

Conductors of [[choir]]s or choruses are sometimes referred to as ''choral director,'' ''chorus master,'' or ''choirmaster,'' particularly for choirs associated with an orchestra. Conductors of [[concert band]]s, [[military band]]s, [[marching band]]s and other bands may hold the title of ''band director'', ''bandmaster'', or ''drum major''.

In the [[Christianity|Christian]] church, the person giving these symbols held a [[Staff of office|staff]] to signify his role, and it seems that as music became [[rhythm]]ically more complex, the staff was moved up and down to indicate the beat, acting as an early form of [[Baton (conducting)|baton]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn the 17th century, other devices to indicate the passing of time came into use. Rolled sheets of paper, smaller sticks and unadorned hands are all shown in pictures from this period.

This was sometimes the [[concertmaster]], who could use his [[bow (music)|bow]] as a baton, or a [[lute]]nist who would move the neck of his instrument in time with the beat. It was common to conduct from the [[harpsichord]] in pieces that had a [[basso continuo]] part. In opera performances, there were sometimes two conductors, with the keyboard player in charge of the singers and the principal violinist or '''leader''' was in charge of the orchestra.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nOn Fri, 30 Sep 1791 in Vienna, [[Mozart]]'s opera ''Die Zauberfl\u00f6te'' (''[[The Magic Flute]]'') premiered at the [[Theater auf der Wieden]], with Mozart himself conducting the orchestra, according to documents and publicity posters from that time.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Edge |first1=Dexter |title=The earliest published report on the premiere of Die Zauberfl\u00f6te (1 Oct 1791) |url=https://sites.google.com/site/mozartdocuments/documents/1791-10-01 |website=Mozart: New Documents |publisher=Dexter Edge and David Black |accessdate=25 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1798, [[Joseph Haydn]] conducted the premiere of ''[[The Creation (Haydn)|Creation]]'' with his hands and a baton while \"[[Joseph Weigl|Kapellmeister Weigl]] [sat] at the fortepiano.\"<ref>[[H.

While some orchestras protested the introduction of the conductor, since they were used to having a concertmaster or keyboard player act as leader, eventually the role of a conductor was established. The size of the usual orchestra expanded during this period, and the use of a baton became more common, as it was easier to see than bare hands or rolled-up paper. Among the earliest notable conductors were [[Louis Spohr]], [[Carl Maria von Weber]], [[Louis-Antoine Jullien]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn]], all of whom were also composers. Mendelssohn is claimed to have been the first conductor to utilize a wooden baton to keep time, a practice still generally in use in the 2010s. Prominent conductors who did not or do not use a baton include [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Kurt Masur]], [[James Conlon]], [[Yuri Temirkanov]],<ref>Libbey, Theodore (2006).

Pendragon. {{ISBN|9780918728470}}.</ref>\n\nThe composers [[Hector Berlioz]] and [[Richard Wagner]] attained greatness as conductors, and they wrote two of the earliest essays dedicated to the subject. Berlioz is considered the first virtuoso conductor. Wagner was largely responsible for shaping the conductor's role as one who imposes his own view of a piece onto the performance rather than one who is just responsible for ensuring entries are made at the right time and that there is a unified beat. Predecessors who focused on conducting include [[Fran\u00e7ois Habeneck]], who founded the [[Orchestre de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des concerts du Conservatoire]] in 1828, though Berlioz was later to be alarmed at Habeneck's loose standards of rehearsal. Pianist and composer [[Franz Liszt]] was also a conductor.\n\nWagner's one-time champion [[Hans von B\u00fclow]] (1830\u20131894) was particularly celebrated as a conductor, although he also maintained his initial career as a pianist, an instrument on which he was regarded as among the greatest performers (he was a prized piano student of [[Franz Liszt]], whose daughter [[Cosima Wagner|Cosima]] he married \u2013 although she was to abandon him for Wagner. Liszt was a major figure in the history of conducting, who attained remarkable performances).\n\nB\u00fclow raised the technical standards of conducting to an unprecedented level through such innovations as separate, detailed rehearsals of different sections of the orchestra (\"sectional rehearsal\"). In his posts as head of (sequentially) the [[Bavarian State Opera]], [[Meiningen Court Orchestra]], and [[Berlin Philharmonic]] he brought a level of nuance and subtlety to orchestral performance previously heard only in solo instrumental playing, and in doing so made a profound impression on young artists like [[Richard Strauss]], who at the age of 20 served as his assistant, and [[Felix Weingartner]], who came to disapprove of his interpretations but was deeply impressed by his orchestral standards. Composer [[Gustav Mahler]] was also a noted conductor.\n\n===20th century===\nTechnical standards were brought to new levels by the next generation of conductors, including [[Arthur Nikisch]] (1855\u20131922), who succeeded B\u00fclow as music director of the Berlin Philharmonic in 1895. Nikisch had previously served as head of the [[Leipzig Opera]], [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]], and [[Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra]], and was to serve as music director of the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]. Nikisch premiered important works by [[Anton Bruckner]] and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], who greatly admired his work; [[Johannes Brahms]], after hearing him conduct his [[Symphony No. 4 (Brahms)|Fourth Symphony]], said it was \"quite exemplary, it's impossible to hear it any better.\"\n\nNikisch took the London Symphony Orchestra on tour through the United States in April 1912, the first American tour by a European orchestra. He also made one of the earliest [[Sound recording and reproduction|recordings]] of a complete symphony: the [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven Fifth]] with the Berlin Philharmonic in November 1913. Nikisch was also the first conductor to have his art captured on film \u2013 alas, silently. The film confirms reports that he made particularly mesmerizing use of eye contact and expression to communicate with an orchestra; such later conductors as [[Fritz Reiner]] stated that this aspect of his technique had a strong influence on their own.\n\nConductors of the generations after Nikisch often left extensive recorded evidence of their arts. Two particularly influential and widely recorded figures are often treated, somewhat inaccurately, as interpretive antipodes. They were the Italian conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]] (1867\u20131957) and the German conductor [[Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler]] (1886\u20131954). Toscanini played in orchestras under [[Giuseppe Verdi]] and made his debut conducting ''[[Aida]]'' in 1886, filling in at the last minute for an indisposed conductor. He is to this day regarded by such authorities as [[James Levine]] as the greatest of all Verdi conductors. But Toscanini's repertory was wide, and it was in his interpretations of the German symphonists Beethoven and Brahms that he was particularly renowned and influential, favoring stricter and faster tempi than a conductor like B\u00fclow or, before him, Wagner. Still, his style shows more inflection than his reputation may suggest, and he was particularly gifted at revealing detail and getting orchestras to play in a singing manner.\n\nFurtw\u00e4ngler, whom many regard as the greatest interpreter of Wagner (although Toscanini was also admired in this composer) and Bruckner, conducted Beethoven and Brahms with a good deal of inflection of tempo \u2013 but generally in a manner that revealed the structure and direction of the music particularly clearly. He was an accomplished composer as well as performer, and a disciple of the theorist [[Heinrich Schenker]], who emphasized concern for underlying long-range harmonic tensions and [[Resolution (music)|resolutions]] in a piece, a strength of Furtw\u00e4ngler's conducting. Along with his interest in the large-scale, Furtw\u00e4ngler also shaped the details of the piece in a particularly compelling and expressive manner.\n[[File:Holland Festival dirigent Leonard Bernstein zal het met het Concertgebouworkes, Bestanddeelnr 933-3400.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leonard Bernstein]] conducting the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]] in 1985]]\n\nThe two men had very different techniques: Toscanini's was Italianate, with a long, large baton and clear beats (often not using his left hand); Furtw\u00e4ngler beat time with less apparent precision, because he wanted a more rounded sound (although it is a myth that his technique was vague; many musicians have attested that he was easy to follow in his own way). In any event, their examples illustrate a larger point about conducting technique in the first half of the 20th century: it was not standardized. Great and influential conductors of the middle 20th century like [[Leopold Stokowski]] (1882\u20131977), [[Otto Klemperer]] (1885\u20131973), [[Herbert von Karajan]] (1908\u20131989) and [[Leonard Bernstein]] (1918\u20131990) \u2013 incidentally, the first American conductor to attain greatness and international fame \u2013 had widely varied techniques.\n\nKarajan and Bernstein formed another apparent antipode in the 1960s\u201380s, Karajan as music director of the Berlin Philharmonic (1955\u201389) and Bernstein as, for part of that period, music director of the [[New York Philharmonic]] (1957\u201369), and later frequent guest conductor in Europe. Karajan's technique was highly controlled, and eventually he conducted with his eyes often closed; Bernstein's technique was demonstrative, with highly expressive facial gestures and hand and body movements. Karajan could conduct for hours without moving his feet, while Bernstein was known at times to leap into the air at a great climax. As the music director of the Berlin Philharmonic, Karajan cultivated warm, blended beauty of tone, which has sometimes been criticized as too uniformly applied; by contrast, in Bernstein's only appearance with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1979 \u2013 performing Mahler's [[Symphony No. 9 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 9]] \u2013 he tried to get the orchestra to produce an \"ugly\" tone in a certain passage in which he believed it suited the expressive meaning of the music (the first horn player refused, and finally agreed to let an understudy play instead of himself).\n\nBoth Karajan and Bernstein made extensive use of advances in media to convey their art, but in tellingly different ways. Bernstein hosted major prime-time national television series to educate and reach out to children and the public at large about classical music; Karajan made a series of films late in his life, but in them, he did not talk. Both made numerous recordings, but their attitudes toward recording differed: Karajan frequently made new studio recordings to take advantage of advances in recording technique, which fascinated him \u2013 he played a role in setting the specifications of the compact disc \u2013 but Bernstein, in his post-New York days, came to insist on (for the most part) live concert recordings, believing that music-making did not come to life in a studio without an audience.\n\nIn the last third of the 20th century, conducting technique \u2013 particularly with the right hand and the baton \u2013 became increasingly standardized. Conductors like [[Willem Mengelberg]] in Amsterdam until the end of World War II had had extensive rehearsal time to mold orchestras very precisely, and thus could have idiosyncratic techniques; modern conductors, who spend less time with any given orchestra, must get results with much less rehearsal time. A more standardized technique allows communication to be much more rapid. Nonetheless, conductors' techniques still show a great deal of variety, particularly with the use of the left hand, facial and eye expression, and body language.\n\n===21st century===\n[[File:full score.jpg|thumb|Conductor's score and batons on a lit, extra-large conductor's music stand]]\n[[Women in music#Conducting|Women conductors]] were almost unheard of in the ranks of leading orchestral conductors through most of the 19th and 20th centuries, but today, artists like {{interlanguage link|Hortense von Gelmini|de}},<ref>David Mutch: \"The gathering critical judgement of Hortense von Gelmini, Germany's only woman conductor, is that she has not only the talent but the education, energy, and persistance to make her mark in this difficult and competitive profession\" \u2013 1976 in: ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'' {{Full citation needed|date=October 2017}}</ref> [[Marin Alsop]] and [[Simone Young]] are to be seen conducting leading orchestras.

Although there are many formal rules on how to conduct correctly, others are subjective, and a wide variety of different conducting styles exist depending upon the training and sophistication of the conductor. The primary responsibilities of the conductor are to unify performers, set the tempo, execute clear preparations and beats, listen critically and shape the sound of the ensemble, and to control the interpretation and pacing of the music. Communication is non-verbal during a performance, however in [[rehearsal]] frequent interruptions allow directions as to how the music should be played. During rehearsals, the conductor may stop the playing of a piece to request changes in the phrasing or request a change in the timbre of a certain section. In amateur orchestras, the rehearsals are often stopped to draw the musicians' attentions to performance errors or transposition mistakes.\n\nConducting requires an understanding of the elements of musical expression ([[tempo]], [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[Articulation (music)|articulation]]) and the ability to communicate them effectively to an ensemble. The ability to communicate nuances of [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]] and expression through gestures is also beneficial. Conducting gestures are preferably prepared beforehand by the conductor while studying the [[sheet music|score]], but may sometimes be spontaneous.\n\nA distinction is sometimes made between orchestral conducting and choral conducting. Typically, orchestral conductors use a [[baton (conducting)|baton]] more often than choral conductors. The grip of the baton varies from conductor to conductor.\n\n===Beat and tempo===\n<!--[[Ictus]] links directly here.-->\nAt the beginning of a piece of music, the conductor raises his hands (or hand if he only uses a single hand) to indicate that the piece is about to begin. This is a signal for the orchestra members to ready their instruments to be played or for the choristers to be ready and watching. The conductor then looks at the different sections of the orchestra (winds, strings, etc.) or choir to ensure that all the orchestra members are ready to play and choir members are ready. In some choral works, the conductor may signal to a pianist or organist to play a note or chord so that the choir members can determine their starting notes. Then the conductor gives one or more preparatory beats to commence the music. The preparatory beat before the orchestra or choir begins is the [[upbeat]]. The [[Beat (music)|beat]] of the music is typically indicated with the conductor's right hand, with or without a baton. The hand traces a shape in the air in every [[bar (music)|bar]] (measure) depending on the [[time signature]], indicating each beat with a change from downward to upward motion.<ref>{{Cite news|title=The Maestro's Mojo \u2013 Breaking Conductors' Down by Gesture and Body Part|first=Daniel J.|last=Wakin|date=6 April 2012|accessdate=26 April 2012|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/arts/music/breaking-conductors-down-by-gesture-and-body-part.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> The images show the most common beat patterns, as seen from the conductor's point of view.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe [[Beat (music)#Downbeat|downbeat]] indicates the first beat of the bar, and the [[upbeat]] indicates the beat before the first note of the piece and the last beat of the bar. The instant at which the beat occurs is called the ''[[Wikt:ictus|ictus]]'' (plural: ''{{lang|la|ict\u016bs}}'' or ''ictuses''), and is usually indicated by a sudden (though not necessarily large) click of the wrist or change in baton direction. In some instances, \"ictus\" is also used to refer to a horizontal plane in which all the ictuses are physically located, such as the top of a [[music stand]] where a baton is tapped at each ictus. The gesture leading up to the ictus is called the \"preparation\", and the continuous flow of steady beats is called the \"{{lang|de|takt}}\" (the German word for bar, measure and beat).\n\nIf the [[tempo]] is slow or slowing, or if the [[time signature]] is [[Metre (music)#Compound metre|compound]], a conductor will sometimes indicate \"subdivisions\" of the beats. The conductor can do this by adding a smaller movement in the same direction as the movement for the beat that it belongs to.<!---I can't find the words to make this more clear right now, but I don't think this is clear or understandable to the layman yet---not just quadruple metre--->\n\nChanges to the tempo are indicated by changing the speed of the beat. To carry out and to control a [[rallentando]] (slowing down the pace of the music), a conductor may introduce beat subdivisions.\n\nWhile some conductors use both hands to indicate the beat, with the left hand mirroring the right, formal education discourages such an approach. The second hand can be used for [[Musical cue|cueing]] the entrances of individual players or sections, and to aid indications of dynamics, phrasing, expression, and other elements.\n\nDuring an instrumental solo section (or, in an opera orchestra during a vocalist's unaccompanied solo), some conductors stop counting out all the subdivisions and simply tap the baton down once per bar, to aid performers who are counting bars of rests.\n\nThere is a difference between the \"textbook\" definition of where the ictus of a downbeat occurs and the actual [[performance practice]] in professional orchestras. With an abrupt, loud [[Dynamics (music)#Sudden changes and accented notes|sforzando]] chord, a professional orchestra will often play slightly ''after'' the striking of the ictus point of the baton stroke.\n\n===Dynamics===\n[[dynamics (music)|Dynamics]] are indicated in various ways. The dynamic may be communicated by the size of the conducting movements, larger shapes representing louder sounds. Changes in dynamic may be signalled with the hand that is not being used to indicate the beat: an upward motion (usually palm-up) indicates a [[crescendo]]; a downward motion (usually palm-down) indicates a [[Dynamics (music)|diminuendo]]. Changing the size of conducting movements frequently results in changes in the character of the music depending upon the circumstances.\n\nDynamics can be fine-tuned using various gestures: showing one's palm to the performers or leaning away from them may demonstrate a decrease in volume. To adjust the overall balance of the various instruments or voices, these signals can be combined or directed toward a particular section or performer.\n\n===Cueing===\nThe indication of entries, when a performer or section should begin playing (perhaps after a long period of rests), is called \"cueing\". A cue must forecast with certainty the exact moment of the coming ictus, so that all the players or singers affected by the cue can begin playing simultaneously. Cueing is most important for cases where a performer or section has not been playing for a lengthy time. Cueing is also helpful in the case of a [[pedal point]] with string players, when a section has been playing the pedal point for a lengthy period; a cue is important to indicate when they should change to a new note. Cueing is achieved by \"engaging\" the players before their entry (by looking at them) and executing a clear preparation gesture, often directed toward the specific players. An inhalation, which may or may not be a semi-audible \"sniff\" from the conductor, is a common element in the cueing technique of some conductors. Mere eye contact or a look in the general direction of the players may be sufficient in many instances, as when more than one section of the ensemble enters at the same time. Larger musical events may warrant the use of a larger or more emphatic cue designed to encourage emotion and energy.\n\n===Other musical elements===\n[[File:US Navy 030228-N-5576W-002 Jazz great visits Navy.jpg|thumb|A conductor, [[Gerald Wilson]], leads a jazz [[big band]]]]\nArticulation may be indicated by the character of the ictus, ranging from short and sharp for [[staccato]], to long and fluid for [[legato]]. Many conductors change the tension of the hands: strained muscles and rigid movements may correspond to marcato, while relaxed hands and soft movements may correspond to legato or espressivo. Phrasing may be indicated by wide overhead arcs or by a smooth hand motion either forwards or side-to-side. A held note is often indicated by a hand held flat with palm up. The end of a note, called a \"cutoff\" or \"release\", may be indicated by a circular motion, the closing of the palm, or the pinching of finger and thumb. A release is usually preceded by a preparation and concluded with a complete stillness.\n\nConductors<!-- would a reference improve this? Strauss said (light-heartedly) \"never look at the brass, it only encourages them\", and Karajan sometimes conducted with his eyes closed --> aim to maintain eye contact with the ensemble as much as possible, encouraging eye contact in return and increasing the dialogue between players/singers and conductor. Facial expressions may also be important to demonstrate the character of the music or to encourage the players.\n\nIn some cases, such as where there has been little rehearsal time to prepare a piece, a conductor may discreetly indicate how the bars of music will be beat immediately before the start of the movement by holding up their fingers in front of their chest (so only the performers can see). For example, in a {{music|time|4|4}} piece that the conductor will beat \"in two\" (two ictus points or beats per bar, as if it were {{music|time|2|2}}), the conductor would hold up two fingers in front of his chest.\n\nIn most cases, there is a short pause between movements of a symphony, concerto or dance suite. This brief pause gives orchestra or choir members time to turn the pages of their part and ready themselves for the start of the next movement. String players may apply rosin or wipe sweat off their hands with a handkerchief. Reed players may take this time to change to a new reed. In some cases, woodwind or brass players will use the pause to switch to a different instrument (e.g., from trumpet to cornet or from clarinet to E{{music|b}} clarinet). If the conductor wishes to immediately begin one movement after another for musical reasons, this is called [[attacca]]. The conductor will instruct the orchestra members and choristers to write the term in their parts, so that they will be ready to go immediately to the next movement.\n\n==Roles==\n[[File:US Navy 060529-N-2383B-123 The U.S. Navy band performs during Memorial Day ceremonies held in the amphitheater of Arlington National Cemetery.jpg|thumb|A military conductor leads the U.S. Navy band during Memorial Day ceremonies held at Arlington National Cemetery.]]\nThe roles of a conductor vary a great deal between different conducting positions and different ensembles. In some cases, a conductor will also be the [[musical director]] of the symphony, choosing the program for the entire season, including concerts by guest conductors, concerto soloists, pop concerts, and so on. A senior conductor may attend some or all of the [[audition]]s for new members of the orchestra, to ensure that the candidates have the playing style and tone that the conductor prefers and that candidates meet the highest performance standards. Some choral conductors are hired to prepare a choir for several weeks which will subsequently be directed by another conductor. The choral conductor is usually acknowledged for their preparatory work in the concert program.\n\nSome conductors may have a significant public relations role, giving interviews to the local news channel and appearing on television talk shows to promote the upcoming season or particular concerts. On the other hand, a conductor hired to guest conduct a single concert may only have the responsibility of rehearsing the orchestra for several pieces and conducting one or two concerts. While a handful of conductors have become well-known [[celebrity|celebrities]], such as [[Leonard Bernstein]], most are only known within the classical music scene.\n\n==Training and education==\n[[Image:David Baker (far left) leading the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra.jpg|thumb|left|[[David Baker (composer)|David Baker]], a music educator, composer and conductor, (far left) leads the [[Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra]] during the [[NEA Jazz Masters]] awards ceremony and concert in 2008.]]\nClassical choral and instrumental conducting have established comprehensive systems of instruction and training. Aspiring conductors can study at colleges, conservatories, and universities. [[Music school|Conservatories]], which are the standard musical training system in France and in Quebec (Canada) provide lessons and amateur conducting experience. Universities offer a range of conducting programs, including courses in conducting as part of bachelor's degrees, a small number of Master of Music degrees in conducting, and an even smaller number of [[Doctor of Musical Arts]] degrees in conducting.\n\nIn addition, there are a variety of other training programs such as classical summer camps and training festivals, which give students the opportunity to conduct a wide range of music. Aspiring conductors need to obtain a broad education about the history of music, including the major periods of [[classical music]] and regarding [[music theory]]. Many conductors learn to play a keyboard instrument such as the [[piano]] or the [[pipe organ]], a skill that helps them to be able to analyze symphonies and try out their interpretations before they have access to an orchestra to conduct. Many conductors get experience playing in an orchestra or singing in a choir, an experience which gives them good insights into how orchestras and choirs are conducted and rehearsed.\n\nIn 2014, orchestra conductors typically hold a master's degree in music and choir conductors in the US typically hold a bachelor's degree in music.<ref name=\"bls.gov\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/entertainment-and-sports/mobile/music-directors-and-composers.htm|title=Music Directors and Composers : Occupational Outlook Handbook : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-08-19}}</ref> Bachelor's degrees (referred to as [[B.Mus.]] or B.M) are four-year programs that include conducting lessons, amateur orchestra experience, and a sequence of courses in music history, music theory, and liberal arts courses (e.g., English literature), which give the student a more well-rounded education. Students do not usually specialize in conducting at the B.Mus. stage; instead, they usually develop general music skills such as singing, playing an orchestral instrument, performing in a choir, playing in orchestra, and playing a keyboard instrument such as the piano or the organ.\n\nAnother topic that conducting students study is the languages used in Classical music opera. Orchestral conductors are expected to be able to rehearse and lead choirs in works for orchestra and choir. As such, orchestral conductors need to know the major languages used in choral writing (including French, Italian and Latin, among others) and they must understand the correct diction of these languages in a choral singing context. The opposite is also true: a choral conductor will be expected to rehearse and lead a string orchestra or full orchestra when performing works for choir and orchestra. As such, a choral conductor needs to know how to rehearse and lead instrument sections.\n\nMaster of music degrees ([[M.mus.]]) in conducting consist of private conducting lessons, ensemble experience, coaching, and graduate courses in music history and music theory, along with one or two conducted concerts. A Master's degree in music (referred to as an [[M.Mus.]] or M.M.) is often the required minimum credential for people who wish to become a professor of conducting.\n\n[[Doctor of Musical Arts]] (referred to as D.M.A., DMA, D.Mus.A. or A.Mus.D) degrees in conducting provide an opportunity for advanced study at the highest artistic and pedagogical level, requiring usually an additional 54+ credit hours beyond a master's degree (which is about 30+ credits beyond a bachelor's degree). For this reason, admission is highly selective. Examinations in music history, music theory, ear training/dictation, and an entrance examination and conducting audition are required. Students perform a number of conducted concerts, including a combination lecture-conducted concert with an accompanying doctoral dissertation, advanced coursework. Students must typically maintain a minimum B average. A DMA in conducting is a [[terminal degree]], and as such, it qualifies the holder to teach in colleges, universities and conservatories. In addition to academic study, another part of the training pathway for many conductors is conducting amateur orchestras, such as [[youth orchestra]]s, school orchestras and community orchestras.\n\nA small number of conductors become professionals without formal training in conducting. These individuals often have achieved renown as instrumental or vocal performers, and they have often undertaken a great deal of training in their area of expertise (instrumental performance or singing). Another way that a small number of conductors become professionals without formal training in conducting is by learning on the job by conducting amateur orchestras, school orchestras, and community orchestras (or the equivalent choral ensembles).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe average salary of conductors in the US in 2014 was $48,180. A 3% growth rate is forecast for conducting jobs from 2014 to 2024, a slower than average growth rate.<ref name=\"bls.gov\"/>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Conductorless orchestra]]\n*[[List of principal conductors by orchestra]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Harold Farberman]]: ''The Art of Conducting Technique'' (Alfred Music, Nov 27, 1999)\n* [[Michael Bowles]]: ''The Art of Conducting'' (Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1959); English edition as ''The Conductor: His Artistry and Craftsmanship'' (London: G.
