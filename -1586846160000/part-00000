He regards himself as the leader of the group. Not only can he transform into a bat, he has also become a dog to save Laszlo from an animal shelter. He is also a [[USA Basketball]] fan since 1992 and even wanted to become an American citizen solely to compete in the Olympics for America before the [[Macarena (song)|Macarena]] swept the country and took up all his time. He was also the king of a country called Al Quolanudar which is in Southern Iran where he was born. Al Quolanudar dissolved in 1401 when Nandor was just 139 years old.\n* [[Matt Berry]] as Laszlo Cravensworth, an [[English nobility|English nobleman]] vampire who was turned by Nadja and is now married to her. He frequently disagrees with Nandor's leadership and enjoys making music and [[Topiary|topiary sculptures]], especially of [[vulva]]s. He is able to transform himself into a bat, but must shout \"Bat!\" whenever doing so and can communicate with animals. Laszlo reveals to the other vampires in one episode that he was [[Jack the Ripper]]. He is revealed to be bisexual and has an extensive filmography of pornographic movies in which he plays vampire characters.\n* [[Natasia Demetriou]] as Nadja, a [[Romani people|Romani]] vampire, married to Laszlo. However, she is secretly seeing a human man named Jeff Suckler who is the reincarnation of her former human lover, Gregor, whom she accidentally decapitated in a previous incarnation. She has a unique ability to transform into a swarm of rats.\n* [[Harvey Guill\u00e9n]] as Guillermo, Nandor's \"patient\" [[Familiar spirit |familiar]]. He has served his master for 10 years (a decade) in order to become a vampire like the fictional vampire [[Armand (The Vampire Chronicles)|Armand]], played by [[Antonio Banderas]], who first inspired him. Nandor shows small acts of kindness for Guillermo, such as making a glitter portrait for him, and taking him flying, but otherwise excludes him, belittles him, and endlessly procrastinates about making Guillermo a vampire. He is mostly Mexican-American but 2% Dutch; so far unknown to the others, he is a descendant of [[Van Helsing]], the infamous vampire hunter.\n* [[Mark Proksch]] as Colin Robinson, an [[Psychic vampire|energy vampire]] who lives with the trio. Unlike regular vampires he shows no outward sign of vampirism, except that his pupils sometimes glow and his reflection shows a pale version of himself. He drains humans (and vampires) of their energy by boring or enraging them (then later using humor in season 2). He is also a Daywalker, which makes him free to roam day and night (making normal vampires envious). The others are continually annoyed by him, and often try to avoid associating with him, but they let him stay because his office job pays for their considerable rent.<ref name=\"PremiereTrailer\">{{cite web |last1=Petski |first1=Denise |title='What We Do in the Shadows': FX Vampire Comedy Series Unveils Trailer, Sets Premiere Date -TCA |url=https://deadline.com/2019/02/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-trailer-premiere-date-fx-vampire-comedy-series-tca-1202549095/ |website=Deadline Hollywood |accessdate=February 4, 2019 |date=February 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] as Baron Afanas, an ancient vampire from the Old Country who believes vampires should rule the world. He is also bisexual. Both Nadja and Laszlo had secret [[affair]]s with The Baron. Laszlo mentions that Afanas used to be a fun person but recently he has only come up with old fashioned ideas. A drunk Afanas mentions that he is not actually a baron, rather \"Baron\" is a nickname and it is actually spelled Barren. While drunk he says that he does not want to be who he has recently become. After a night of partying with the Staten Island vampires (while also becoming high by drinking blood from humans who were on drugs), the Baron was burned and destroyed by sunlight when Guillermo opened the front door unaware the Baron was there.\n* [[Beanie Feldstein]] as Jenna, a [[Live action role-playing game|LARPer]] and virgin whom Guillermo lured for the vampires to feast on. She was later transformed by Nadja into a vampire when she witnesses Jenna being treated poorly by her group and sympathized with her from her own struggles in her human life. During her vampire training with Nadja, she is revealed to have the unique ability to turn invisible, which fits the tendency of people to ignore her.\n* [[Jake McDorman]] as Jeff Suckler, a [[reincarnation]] of Nadja's former human lover, Gregor, a Knight who has been killed by decapitation in each of his lives. Nadja visited him in secret and eventually restored Jeff's memories of his previous lives so that he can be more like his former self, leading to him falling into insanity and being committed to a mental institution. It is later revealed to Nadja and Gregor that Laszlo had always known about Gregor and most of his subsequent reincarnations. Laszlo had been causing his deaths because Nadja would become sad whenever Gregor was reborn, a gesture that she finds touching. Nadja convinces Laszlo to let Jeff go and to allow him to live a single full life, only for him to be accidentally decapitated by a wire that Laszlo had been using to hold up one of his topiary structures.\n\n===Guests===\n* Mary Gillis as June, Nadja and Laszlo's Familiar. She appears to be an ill old woman that communicates through grunts. She eventually meets her end when the Baron sucks all her blood when he arrives on Staten Island.\n* [[Hayden Szeto]] as Jonathan, a LARPer college student that Guillermo lured for the vampires to feast on. However, Colin beat them to it by draining his energy, making the blood totally without nourishment.\n* Gloria Laino as The Baron's Familiar. She is keeping a watchful eye on the vampires of Staten Island as her master awakes. Guillermo says that she pops out of nowhere and hears \"everything\". Despite staying silent most of the time she is perfectly capable of speaking.\n* Marceline Hugot as Barbara Lazarro, the madam president of the Staten Island Council. She was going to be the vampires' way of taking over Staten Island until Laszlo left a pile of dead raccoons on her doorstep in an attempt to win her trust, resulting in her believing it was a form of terrorist threat.\n* Richie Moriarty as Doug Peterson, a Junior Councilman of the Staten Island Council. Nandor hypnotizes him to use as his \"Agent of Chaos\", in order to take over the council. But the scheme fails when Peterson goes mad, screaming and ranting in the council chambers, only to be arrested and dragged out of the council by security.\n* Veronika Slowikowska as Shanice, Jenna's college roommate who is aware of her being a vampire.\n* [[Anthony Atamanuik]] as Sean, the human next door neighbor. He frequently witnesses Laszlo doing wildly inappropriate and illegal things, but is easily hypnotized into forgetting everything. The vampires only spare him because he brings their trash cans in when they forget.\n* [[Vanessa Bayer]] as Evie Russell, Colin's co-worker. She is an advanced form of Energy Vampire \u2014 an Emotional Vampire \u2014 who feeds off of the pity generated from her outlandish stories of suffering rather than simply frustrating people for energy to drain like Colin. She and Colin date for a short time until he begins to feel the relationship is unhealthy. Her first name is a [[homophone]] of \"E.V.\"\n* [[Arj Barker]] as Arjan, the pack leader of the [[Werewolf|Staten Island Werewolf Support Group]]. He entered into the truce between his kind and the vampires (which was created in 1993).\n* Hannan Younis as Ange, an African American werewolf and part of Arjan's group. She undermines Arjan's rules (like Laszlo does to Nandor) and is openly hostile towards Nadja due to Nadja's insulting the werewolves by [[racism|assuming]] they are all [[Jacob Black|Native Americans]] (or how she puts it, \"Indians.\")\n* [[1491s|Bobby Wilson]] as Marcus, the actual [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] member of the Werewolf Pack. He is Native American, and a werewolf but, as he explains, \"Not a werewolf ''because''\" he's Native American. \"It's not an ''ethnic'' thing.\"\n* Ro Manning as Dougie, the [[Black Canadians|Caribbean-Canadian]] member of Werewolf Pack. He is proud to be from [[Saskatoon]]. \n* Justin Bigelli as Toby, the new, gigantic member of the Werewolf Pack. Unlike his brethren, he can actually transform at any phase of the moon, simply by picturing the full moon in his mind, allowing him to transform at will (only if it's nighttime).\n* [[Nick Kroll]] as Simon the Devious, a vampire who rules over the Manhattan Vampires and owns the Sassy Cat nightclub. He was a close friend to the Staten Island trio when all the vampires first arrived in America. When the Staten Island Vampires propose an alliance to conquer America, he reveals that his invitation was just a ruse to get Laszlo's fancy hat (which is cursed because it's made from witch skin). The trio are kicked out of the club, but the cursed Hat causes Simon's flaming arrow to backfire, and his club goes up in a fiery explosion. Simon winds up in a full-body cast in the hospital, and Laszlo sneaks in and retrieves his cursed hat.\n* [[Kristen Schaal]] as The Guide (also known as the \"Floating Woman\"), an envoy of the Vampiric Council who likes to float and sometimes speak in a demonic voice.\n* [[Dave Bautista]] and Alexandra Henrikson as Garrett and Vasillika the Defiler, vampires imprisoned by the Council after Garrett was framed by Laszlo for turning a baby into a vampire (which is very illegal), and Vasillika for too much defiling.\n* [[Taika Waititi]], [[Jonathan Brugh]], and [[Jemaine Clement]] reprise their roles as Viago, Deacon, and Vladislav from the original film.

One of the movies we really talked about a lot when we were conceiving the show was [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' where he went back to really doing as many effects as possible in camera and figuring out ways to do that. One of my favorite supernatural moments is completely in camera. It's where [[Beanie Feldstein]]'s character is walking along in the park and Nadja appears walking next to her. That was all just done completely the old fashioned way where Natasia was hiding behind a tree and the camera was tracking a long and at the right moment, she walked out from behind a tree. I think there's something about that old fashioned way that makes things more interesting than when you can tell it's digital and rubbery and fake looking\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-showrunner-interview/ |title=\u2018What We Do in the Shadows\u2019 Showrunner Teases Supernatural Orgies, \u2018Blade\u2019 Vampires, and More [Interview] |website=/Film |first=Fred |last=Topel |date=March 26, 2019 |accessdate=September 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAmong the cinematographers D.J.

Our take, however, was that the Staten Island vampires have let their place go. The former glory is evident but now exists in a worn, faded and distressed state. Production designer Kate Bunch and I had a lot of conversations about striking the right balance between sumptuousness and neglect.

He regards himself as the leader of the group. Not only can he transform into a bat, he has also become a dog to save Laszlo from an animal shelter. He is also a [[USA Basketball]] fan since 1992 and even wanted to become an American citizen solely to compete in the Olympics for America before the [[Macarena (song)|Macarena]] swept the country and took up all his time. He was also the king of a country called Al Quolanudar which is in Southern Iran where he was born. Al Quolanudar dissolved in 1401 when Nandor was just 139 years old.\n* [[Matt Berry]] as Laszlo Cravensworth, an [[English nobility|English nobleman]] vampire who was turned by Nadja and is now married to her. He frequently disagrees with Nandor's leadership and enjoys making music and [[Topiary|topiary sculptures]], especially of [[vulva]]s. He is able to transform himself into a bat, but must shout \"Bat!\" whenever doing so and can communicate with animals. Laszlo reveals to the other vampires in one episode that he was [[Jack the Ripper]]. He is revealed to be bisexual and has an extensive filmography of pornographic movies in which he plays vampire characters.\n* [[Natasia Demetriou]] as Nadja, a [[Romani people|Romani]] vampire, married to Laszlo. However, she is secretly seeing a human man named Jeff Suckler who is the reincarnation of her former human lover, Gregor, whom she accidentally decapitated in a previous incarnation. She has a unique ability to transform into a swarm of rats.\n* [[Harvey Guill\u00e9n]] as Guillermo, Nandor's \"patient\" [[Familiar spirit |familiar]]. He has served his master for 10 years in order to become a vampire like the fictional vampire [[Armand (The Vampire Chronicles)|Armand]], played by [[Antonio Banderas]], who first inspired him. Nandor shows small acts of kindness for Guillermo, such as making a glitter portrait for him, and taking him flying, but otherwise excludes him, belittles him, and endlessly procrastinates about making Guillermo a vampire. He is mostly Mexican-American but 2% Dutch; so far unknown to the others, he is a descendant of [[Van Helsing]], the infamous vampire hunter.\n* [[Mark Proksch]] as Colin Robinson, an [[Psychic vampire|energy vampire]] who lives with the trio. Unlike regular vampires he shows no outward sign of vampirism, except that his pupils sometimes glow and his reflection shows a pale version of himself. He drains humans (and vampires) of their energy by boring or enraging them. He is also a Daywalker, which makes him free to roam day and night (making normal vampires envious). The others are continually annoyed by him, and often try to avoid associating with him, but they let him stay because his office job pays for their considerable rent.<ref name=\"PremiereTrailer\">{{cite web |last1=Petski |first1=Denise |title='What We Do in the Shadows': FX Vampire Comedy Series Unveils Trailer, Sets Premiere Date -TCA |url=https://deadline.com/2019/02/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-trailer-premiere-date-fx-vampire-comedy-series-tca-1202549095/ |website=Deadline Hollywood |accessdate=February 4, 2019 |date=February 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] as Baron Afanas, an ancient vampire from the Old Country who believes vampires should rule the world. He is also bisexual. Both Nadja and Laszlo had secret [[affair]]s with The Baron. Laszlo mentions that Afanas used to be a fun person but recently he has only come up with old fashioned ideas. A drunk Afanas mentions that he is not actually a baron, rather \"Baron\" is a nickname and it is actually spelled Barren. While drunk he says that he does not want to be who he has recently become. After a night of partying with the Staten Island vampires (while also becoming high by drinking blood from humans who were on drugs), the Baron was burned and destroyed by sunlight when Guillermo opened the front door unaware the Baron was there.\n* [[Beanie Feldstein]] as Jenna, a [[Live action role-playing game|LARPer]] and virgin whom Guillermo lured for the vampires to feast on. She was later transformed by Nadja into a vampire when she witnesses Jenna being treated poorly by her group and sympathized with her from her own struggles in her human life. During her vampire training with Nadja, she is revealed to have the unique ability to turn invisible, which fits the tendency of people to ignore her.\n* [[Jake McDorman]] as Jeff Suckler, a [[reincarnation]] of Nadja's former human lover, Gregor, a Knight who has been killed by decapitation in each of his lives. Nadja visited him in secret and eventually restored Jeff's memories of his previous lives so that he can be more like his former self, leading to him falling into insanity and being committed to a mental institution. It is later revealed to Nadja and Gregor that Laszlo had always known about Gregor and most of his subsequent reincarnations. Laszlo had been causing his deaths because Nadja would become sad whenever Gregor was reborn, a gesture that she finds touching. Nadja convinces Laszlo to let Jeff go and to allow him to live a single full life, only for him to be accidentally decapitated by a wire that Laszlo had been using to hold up one of his topiary structures.\n\n===Guests===\n* Mary Gillis as June, Nadja and Laszlo's Familiar. She appears to be an ill old woman that communicates through grunts. She eventually meets her end when the Baron sucks all her blood when he arrives on Staten Island.\n* [[Hayden Szeto]] as Jonathan, a LARPer college student that Guillermo lured for the vampires to feast on. However, Colin beat them to it by draining his energy, making the blood totally without nourishment.\n* Gloria Laino as The Baron's Familiar. She is keeping a watchful eye on the vampires of Staten Island as her master awakes. Guillermo says that she pops out of nowhere and hears \"everything\". Despite staying silent most of the time she is perfectly capable of speaking.\n* Marceline Hugot as Barbara Lazarro, the madam president of the Staten Island Council. She was going to be the vampires' way of taking over Staten Island until Laszlo left a pile of dead raccoons on her doorstep in an attempt to win her trust, resulting in her believing it was a form of terrorist threat.\n* Richie Moriarty as Doug Peterson, a Junior Councilman of the Staten Island Council. Nandor hypnotizes him to use as his \"Agent of Chaos\", in order to take over the council. But the scheme fails when Peterson goes mad, screaming and ranting in the council chambers, only to be arrested and dragged out of the council by security.\n* Veronika Slowikowska as Shanice, Jenna's college roommate who is aware of her being a vampire.\n* [[Anthony Atamanuik]] as Sean, the human next door neighbor. He frequently witnesses Laszlo doing wildly inappropriate and illegal things, but is easily hypnotized into forgetting everything. The vampires only spare him because he brings their trash cans in when they forget.\n* [[Vanessa Bayer]] as Evie Russell, Colin's co-worker. She is an advanced form of Energy Vampire \u2014 an Emotional Vampire \u2014 who feeds off of the pity generated from her outlandish stories of suffering rather than simply frustrating people for energy to drain like Colin. She and Colin date for a short time until he begins to feel the relationship is unhealthy. Her first name is a [[homophone]] of \"E.V.\"\n* [[Arj Barker]] as Arjan, the pack leader of the [[Werewolf|Staten Island Werewolf Support Group]]. He entered into the truce between his kind and the vampires (which was created in 1993).\n* Hannan Younis as Ange, an African American werewolf and part of Arjan's group. She undermines Arjan's rules (like Laszlo does to Nandor) and is openly hostile towards Nadja due to Nadja's insulting the werewolves by [[racism|assuming]] they are all [[Jacob Black|Native Americans]] (or how she puts it, \"Indians.\")\n* [[1491s|Bobby Wilson]] as Marcus, the actual [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] member of the Werewolf Pack. He is Native American, and a werewolf but, as he explains, \"Not a werewolf ''because''\" he's Native American. \"It's not an ''ethnic'' thing.\"\n* Ro Manning as Dougie, the [[Black Canadians|Caribbean-Canadian]] member of Werewolf Pack. He is proud to be from [[Saskatoon]]. \n* Justin Bigelli as Toby, the new, gigantic member of the Werewolf Pack. Unlike his brethren, he can actually transform at any phase of the moon, simply by picturing the full moon in his mind, allowing him to transform at will (only if it's nighttime).\n* [[Nick Kroll]] as Simon the Devious, a vampire who rules over the Manhattan Vampires and owns the Sassy Cat nightclub. He was a close friend to the Staten Island trio when all the vampires first arrived in America. When the Staten Island Vampires propose an alliance to conquer America, he reveals that his invitation was just a ruse to get Laszlo's fancy hat (which is cursed because it's made from witch skin). The trio are kicked out of the club, but the cursed Hat causes Simon's flaming arrow to backfire, and his club goes up in a fiery explosion. Simon winds up in a full-body cast in the hospital, and Laszlo sneaks in and retrieves his cursed hat.\n* [[Kristen Schaal]] as The Guide (also known as the \"Floating Woman\"), an envoy of the Vampiric Council who likes to float and sometimes speak in a demonic voice.\n* [[Dave Bautista]] and Alexandra Henrikson as Garrett and Vasillika the Defiler, vampires imprisoned by the Council after Garrett was framed by Laszlo for turning a baby into a vampire (which is very illegal), and Vasillika for too much defiling.\n* [[Taika Waititi]], [[Jonathan Brugh]], and [[Jemaine Clement]] reprise their roles as Viago, Deacon, and Vladislav from the original film. Three vampires arrived from New Zealand to participate in the Vampiric Council.{{efn|name=Council|Indeed every known member of the Vampiric Council has played an on-screen vampire before.<br />\nMentioned only: [[Robert Pattinson]] as [[Edward Cullen]] in ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|The Twilight Saga]]'' (2008\u20132012), [[Kiefer Sutherland]] in ''[[The Lost Boys]]'' (1987), [[Tom Cruise]] and [[Brad Pitt]] as [[Lestat de Lioncourt]] and [[Louis de Pointe du Lac]] in ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]'' (1994).<br />\nIt is reported that Waititi denied [[Cate Blanchett]] council membership due to insufficient on-screen vampiric experience.<ref>{{cite interview| subject=Jemaine Clement| subject-link=Jemaine Clement| subject2=Taika Waititi| subject-link2=Taika Waititi| subject3=Paul Simms| subject-link3=Paul Simms| interviewer=Clark Collis| title=What We Do in the Shadows producers discuss all-star episode| url=https://ew.com/tv/2019/05/09/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-season-1-episode-7/| work=[[EW.com]]| publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]| date=2019-05-09| access-date=2019-06-10| quote=}}</ref>}}\n*[[Tilda Swinton]] as Tilda, the leader of the Vampiric Council.{{efn|name=Tilda|[[Tilda Swinton]] played a vampire lover in ''[[Only Lovers Left Alive]]'' (2013).}}\n* [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Evan the Immortal Princess of the Undead, a member of the Council who just goes by her first name.{{efn|name=Evan|[[Evan Rachel Wood]] played [[List of True Blood characters#Supporting vampire characters|Sophie-Anne Leclerq]], the Vampire Queen of Louisiana, in ''[[True Blood]]'' Seasons 2\u20134 (2009\u20132011).}}\n* [[Danny Trejo]] as Danny, a Hispanic tattooed member of the Council.

One of my favorite supernatural moments is completely in camera. It's where [[Beanie Feldstein]]'s character is walking along in the park and Nadja appears walking next to her. That was all just done completely the old fashioned way where Natasia was hiding behind a tree and the camera was tracking a long and at the right moment, she walked out from behind a tree.

She was funded by a ''[[don des vaisseaux]]'' grant by the [[Estates of Brittany]]. <ref name=Roche85 /> She was active in the European theatres of the [[Anglo-French War (1778\u20131783)|Anglo-French War]] and of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], notably taking an important role in the [[Glorious First of June]]. Later, she took part in the  [[Croisi\u00e8re du Grand Hiver]] and was broken up.<ref name=forrer21 />\n\n== Context ==\nThe [[Seven Years' War]] had left the [[French Navy]] severly depleted, and the Crown did not have funds to replace the ships lost during the conflict. In late 1761 [[\u00c9tienne Fran\u00e7ois, duc de Choiseul]] took the direction of the Navy and proposed that the great institutions of France make voluntary donations, a scheme named ''[[don des vaisseaux]]''.

He also reminded of the shortcomings of [[French ship Royal Louis (1759)|''Royal Louis'']], an unsuccessful 100-gun of the time.<ref name=binet222>Binet, p.222</ref> \n\nGroignard hoped to complete construction by 1763, but delay in complete the 1-million load and difficulties in stocking construction wood soon set the schedule back. On 28 March 1763, Groignard sent completed plans to the construction commission, which failed to forward them to Choiseul. On 6 May, Choiseul wrote directly to Groignard to enquire, and setting further requirements that the artillery be set on the three batteries (limiting armament of the castles),<ref name=forrer14>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.14</ref> and that autonomy be sufficient to feed 1,000 men for six months, with water for two.<ref name=binet223>Binet, p.223</ref> By July, construction was expected to be completed in 1765,<ref name=binet225>Binet, p.225</ref> and there were several exchanges of letters and budget estimations between various administrations and rival naval engineers, second-guessing Groignard and arguing about the furniture and spare parts needed for the ship.<ref name=binet228>Binet, p.228</ref> \n\n[[File:Three-decker Bretagne-P4130051.JPG|thumb|left|Depiction on ''Bretagne'' flying the white ensign of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]].]]\nBy 3 January 1764, the Commission was requesting revised versions of the plans as to reduce the dimensions of ''Bretagne''.<ref name=binet231>Binet, p.231</ref> On 23, Groignard submitted his new plans, along with a memorandum underlining that this version would not allow the ship to hold six month worth of food and was compromising her stability, speed and man\u0153uverability; furthermore, he warned that the lower headspace of the gundecks in the smaller project would hinder evacuation of smoke from the guns in combat conditions.<ref name=binet235>Binet, p.235</ref> On 19 February, Choiseul declined to approve the revised plans and requested a third version; Groignard quickly completed the new plans and went directly to Paris himself to submit them, short-circuiting the construction Commission of the Estates of Brittany<ref name=binet237>Binet, p.237</ref> and talking Choiseul out of the notion that the lower battery could be armed with 24-pounders instead of 36-pounders to reduce the cost.<ref name=binet238>Binet, p.238</ref><ref name=forrer14 /> On 7 May, Choiseul informed the Commission that his plans had met with approval and that the construction could begin.<ref name=binet238 />\n\nThe Commission then started procuring the raw materials needed for the construction, notably wood, fabric for the sails, iron and cables. Lacking experience in the matter, it requested advice from Roth, director of the East India Company in Lorient,<ref name=forrer14 /> who replied on 1 April with a long memorandum.<ref name=binet239>Binet, p.239</ref> Besides explaining how to assess the quality of the materials, how to transport it on land and how to store it, the memorandum observed that a number of parts would need to be obtained from outside of Bretagne, and sometimes even abroard, notably from the Netherlands.<ref name=binet240>Binet, p.240</ref> Providers would span from [[Newcastle]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Riga]].<ref name=binet240 />\n\nIn August 1764, Groignard started laying down parts in Lorient shipyard, hoping to take advantage of the summer weather and of a moment of low activity by the East India Company. However, the fluyts needed to transport construction wood were damaged and a lack of wood and nails soon slowed down the work.<ref name=binet242>Binet, p.242</ref> In December, the Estates and the Company signed an understanding that Groignard would have access to the parts and materials stocked in the Company stores, and that the Estates would replenish them within three months.<ref name=binet243>Binet, p.243</ref> On 12 December, the keel was laid down, the bow had been assembled, and the [[Frame (nautical)|frames]] were made and ready to be installed.<ref name=binet244>Binet, p.244</ref>\n\nHowever, on 12 January 1765, the Commission ordered that the construction be halted, <ref name=binet244 /> and summoned Groignard to Nantes.<ref name=binet249>Binet, p.249</ref> Realising its lack of competence, the Commission had decided to cease procuring material directly and to delegate that task to the harbour mandated for the construction, which would be either Lorient or Brest.<ref name=binet250>Binet, p.252</ref> By March, Brest had won the contract; <ref name=binet254>Binet, p.254</ref> the ship was dismantled and her parts were brought to Brest in May 1765.<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /> Groignard remained in charge of the work, <ref name=binet254 /> while the Commission was little involved from then on.<ref name=binet255>Binet, p.255</ref> \n\nOn 5 July 1765, the keel was laid down in Brest<ref name=binet256>Binet, p.256</ref> in the upper dry dock of Pontaniou.<ref name=forrer15>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.15</ref> By mid-July, the framing was completed.<ref name=binet256 /> By mid-September, the hull was [[Caulk|caulked]].<ref name=binet257>Binet, p.257</ref> In late February 1766, carpenters had completed the [[orlop deck]] and were preparing construction of the [[Gun deck|first battery]].<ref name=binet257 /> In April, the sides were completed up to the lower battery, and the decks of the lower and middle batteries were installed.<ref name=binet258>Binet, p.258</ref> On 24 May 1766, ''Bretagne'' was launched.<ref name=binet258 /><ref name=Roche85 />\n\nCompletion of the ship remained slow, <ref name=forrer15 /> and ''Bretagne'' was declared completed on 30 September 1767. <ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /><ref name=forrer15 /> ''Bretagne'' was commissioned in 1768,<ref name=binet261>Binet, p.261</ref> but in June 1770 work remained to be done to make her sea worthy, and she spent the whole year fitting out.<ref name=forrer15 /> On 30 November 1771, she was declared in need of an extensive refit.<ref name=forrer15 />\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1773, ''Bretagne'' was listed as serving in the Brest Brigade of the Ponant Division of the Navy.<ref name=binet261 /> However, her state was deteriorating, and harbour director Count de Breugnon sent her to a dry dock, where she entered on 9 August.<ref name=forrer15 /> In 1775, [[Louis Guillouet, comte d'Orvilliers|Orvilliers]], took command of the Brest squadron and, finding her timbers rotten, petitionned [[Antoine de Sartine|Sartine]] for an extensive refit;<ref name=binet261 /><ref name=forrer15 />  reconstruction started on 1 September 1776, taking  480,000 pounds, and ''Bretagne'' was launched on 7 April 1777.

On 28 March 1763, Groignard sent completed plans to the construction commission, which failed to forward them to Choiseul.

Lacking experience in the matter, it requested advice from Roth, director of the East India Company in Lorient,<ref name=forrer14 /> who replied on 1 April with a long memorandum.<ref name=binet239>Binet, p.239</ref> Besides explaining how to assess the quality of the materials, how to transport it on land and how to store it, the memorandum observed that a number of parts would need to be obtained from outside of Bretagne, and sometimes even abroard, notably from the Netherlands.<ref name=binet240>Binet, p.240</ref> Providers would span from [[Newcastle]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Riga]].<ref name=binet240 />\n\nIn August 1764, Groignard started laying down parts in Lorient shipyard, hoping to take advantage of the summer weather and of a moment of low activity by the East India Company. However, the fluyts needed to transport construction wood were damaged and a lack of wood and nails soon slowed down the work.<ref name=binet242>Binet, p.242</ref> In December, the Estates and the Company signed an understanding that Groignard would have access to the parts and materials stocked in the Company stores, and that the Estates would replenish them within three months.<ref name=binet243>Binet, p.243</ref> On 12 December, the keel was laid down, the bow had been assembled, and the [[Frame (nautical)|frames]] were made and ready to be installed.<ref name=binet244>Binet, p.244</ref>\n\nHowever, on 12 January 1765, the Commission ordered that the construction be halted, <ref name=binet244 /> and summoned Groignard to Nantes.<ref name=binet249>Binet, p.249</ref> Realising its lack of competence, the Commission had decided to cease procuring material directly and to delegate that task to the harbour mandated for the construction, which would be either Lorient or Brest.<ref name=binet250>Binet, p.252</ref> By March, Brest had won the contract; <ref name=binet254>Binet, p.254</ref> the ship was dismantled and her pieces were brought to Brest in May 1765.<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /> Groignard remained in charge of the work, <ref name=binet254 /> while the Commission was little involved from then on.<ref name=binet255>Binet, p.255</ref> \n\nOn 5 July 1765, the keel was laid down in Brest<ref name=binet256>Binet, p.256</ref> in the upper dry dock of Pontaniou.<ref name=forrer15>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.15</ref> By mid-July, the framing was completed.<ref name=binet256 /> By mid-September, the hull was [[Caulk|caulked]].<ref name=binet257>Binet, p.257</ref> In late February 1766, carpenters had completed the [[orlop deck]] and were preparing construction of the [[Gun deck|first battery]].<ref name=binet257 /> In April, the sides were completed up to the lower battery, and the decks of the lower and middle batteries were installed.<ref name=binet258>Binet, p.258</ref> On 24 May 1766, ''Bretagne'' was launched.<ref name=binet258 /><ref name=Roche85 />\n\nCompletion of the ship remained slow, <ref name=forrer15 /> and ''Bretagne'' was declared completed on 30 September 1767. <ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /><ref name=forrer15 /> ''Bretagne'' was commissioned in 1768,<ref name=binet261>Binet, p.261</ref> but in June 1770 work remained to be done to make her sea worthy, and she spent the whole year fitting out.<ref name=forrer15 /> On 30 November 1771, she was declared in need of an extensive refit.<ref name=forrer15 />\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1773, ''Bretagne'' was listed as serving in the Brest Brigade of the Ponant Division of the Navy.<ref name=binet261 /> However, her state was deteriorating, and harbour director Count de Breugnon sent her to a dry dock, where she entered on 9 August.<ref name=forrer15 /> In 1775, [[Louis Guillouet, comte d'Orvilliers|Orvilliers]], took command of the Brest squadron and, finding her timbers rotten, petitionned [[Antoine de Sartine|Sartine]] for an extensive refit;<ref name=binet261 /><ref name=forrer15 />  reconstruction started on 1 September 1776, taking  480,000 pounds, and ''Bretagne'' was launched on 7 April 1777.

Former pro cyclist [[Tom Boonen]] and fellow Belgian Pedro Bonnet signed with the team to drive in Elite 2. Braxx also expands into a three-car team with the addition of the No. 91 car into the team, with the No. 91 car fielding the new Camaro chassis instead of the Mustang chassis.<ref name=\"Braxx\"/>\n* Hendriks Motorsport (not to be confused with [[Hendrick Motorsports]] that currently competes in the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]]) supported Team [[Raceway Venray]] during the 2016 season but will now enter under their own name. The car is owned by Loris' father, former touring car racer [[Toine Hezemans]].\n* Solaris Motorsports will enter the season with [[Francesco Sini]] after racing mainly [[Group GT3|GT3]] machinery in previous years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Solaris Motorsport From GT Racing To Euro NASCAR|url=https://hometracks.nascar.com/2018/01/26/solaris-motorsport-from-gt-racing-to-euro-nascar/|website=NASCAR|accessdate=17 February 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Go Fas Racing]] will expand to NASCAR Whelen Euro Series.

The 100% [[Michelin]] subsidiary takes over from the parent company which supplied tyres for the series since its inception in 2009.\n\n====Mid-season team changes====\n* The Camaro body debuted at Franciacorta after the #91 Braxx Racing team made a switch to a Camaro body between Race 1 and Race 2 of the race weekend, with their Elite 2 driver [[Tom Boonen]] would become the first driver to use the new Camaro body in a NWES race (previously Chevrolet teams used a [[Holden Commodore (VF)|SS]] body similar to the body used in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series from 2013\u201317). As the season goes by, fellow Chevrolet teams PK Carsport, DF1 Racing, and Memphis Racing would also switched to the Camaro chassis.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n* Three Ford teams, Solaris Motorsport, The Club Motorsports, and Race Art - Blu Mot, switched manufacturers to Chevrolet after the Camaro chassis became available for use. Later on, fellow Ford team Braxx Racing's No. 90 team would also made the switch to Chevrolet Camaro chassis.\n* CAAL Motorsport and Racing Total's No. 46 team switched manufacturers mid-season, switching to Toyota and Ford respectively.\n* Belgium Driver Academy made its debut at Franciacorta, running the #7 car for Martin Doubek and Maxime Pampel, both previously driving the #5 Renauer Motorsport Ford Mustang at Valencia. The team also replaces Renauer Motorsport, who shut down its operations after the [[Circuit Ricardo Tormo|Valencia]] round.\n* After competing the first two races of the season, MRT by Nocentini withdrawn their entries for the rest of the season, although the team made a return for the Hockenheim round with Renzo Calcinati behind the wheel of the No. 47 car.\n* Pegasus Racing also withdrawn their entries for the rest of the season after their only car was written out following a heavy accident in [[Brands Hatch]].\n* After the fourth round in [[Tours Speedway|Tours]], BVR Motorsports and Hendriks Motorsport would withdrawn their Elite 1 and Elite 2 entries respectively for the rest of the season.\n* RDV Comp\u00e9tition's third entry, the No. 51 Ford Mustang driven Didier Bec and Hugo Bec, made a return for a part-time effort, competing in [[Brands Hatch]] and [[Hockenheimring|Hockenheim]]. They would also later field the No. 04 Toyota Camry for [[NASCAR Pinty's Series]] driver [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Dumoulin]] at Zolder as part of a driver exchange program that the Euro Series ran in conjunction with Pinty's Series.<ref name=\"JFDomoulin\"/>\n* [[Alex Caffi|Alex Caffi Motorsport]]'s No. 1 team would switch manufacturers to Toyota starting from Hockenheim.\n* Mishumotors, who had previously downsized from a two-car team into a single car team, would expand into a two-car team once again when the team revived the No. 70 entry starting at Hockenheim.\n\n==Schedule and results==\n\n===Elite 1===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n!colspan=2| Round\n!

Gabillon took the championship lead soon after and would lead the championship by the time the playoffs begin at Hockenheim. Problems for both Gabillon and Day at Hockenheim, however, allowed [[Lucas Lasserre]] of Mishumotors and rookie [[Loris Hezemans]] of Hendriks Motorsport to close up the gap, setting up a four-way battle for the title at Zolder. Ultimately, retirements for both Lasserre and Hezemans during the first race of the Zolder race meet effectively eliminated them from title contention, and with Gabillon unable to match Day's pace for the weekend, Alon Day was crowned champion after winning his seventh race of the season at the final race of the season. Alon Day's seven race wins set a new record for the most races won in a single Elite 1 Euro Series season, one short of [[Stienes Longin]]'s overall record of 8 wins in the [[2016 NASCAR Whelen Euro Series|2016]] Elite 2 season. Gabillon won two races (Brands Hatch 1 and Tours 1), while Lassere (Franciacorta 2), Hezemans (Hockenheim 1), and 2015 Elite 2 champion [[Gianmarco Ercoli]] (Brands Hatch 2) scored one race win each.\n\nIn the Elite 2 class, the championship was closely fought between four drivers: [[Ulysse Delsaux]] of RDV Comp\u00e9tition, defending champions Wilfried Boucenna of [[Knauf|Knauf \nRacing]], Florian Venturi of [[Go Fas Racing]], and the returning Guillaume Deflandre for Memphis Racing. Boucenna initially took the championship lead after sweeping both races at Valencia. However, problems for Boucenna at Franciacorta Race 2 allowed Deflandre to caught up to him, and further problems for Boucenna at the first race of Brands Hatch race meet allowed Deflandre to take the championship lead. Delsaux then sweeps the Tours race week to take the lead in the championship, and looks set to sweep the Hockenheim race week had a tire failure in the second race at Hockenheim didn't force him to retire from the race. This allowed Deflandre, Boucenna, and a resurgent Venturi to set up a four-way battle for the championship. A costly retirement at race 1 of Zolder ultimately took out Deflandre of the championship hunt, and while Venturi was able to score a win and a second place finish at Zolder, Delsaux had enough gap between him and Venturi to take the championship with a third place finish at the final race of the season. Delsaux also scored the most race wins of the season with three (Tours sweep and Hockenheim 1). Venturi (Brands Hatch 2 and Zolder 1), Boucenna (Valencia sweep), Deflandre (Brands Hatch 1 and Hockenheim 2), and [[PK Carsport]]'s Guillaume Dumarey (Franciacorta 2 and Zolder 2) scored two race wins, while Brazilian Felipe Rabello (Franciacorta 1) scored one race win.\n\nIn the team's championship, with both of their drivers being in the championship hunt for the entirety of the season, RDV Comp\u00e9tition's #3 team comfortably won team's title, finishing 107 points clear of Knauf Racing's #37 team. New teams Memphis Racing and Go Fas Racing scored an impressive third and fourth place finish, while Knauf Racing's #73 team completes the top five in the team's championship.\n\nIn the manufacturer's championship, [[Toyota]] claimed their first Euro Series manufacturers title, becoming the first manufacturer to successfully topple [[Chevrolet]] from the top spot. Toyota's championship hopes were helped by the decision made by Alon Day's team [[CAAL Racing]] to switch manufacturers from Chevrolet to Toyota mid-season, giving Toyota the crucial edge they need to secure the manufacturer's title.\n\nNotably, this season saw a noticeable increase in attention from the other side of the Atlantic. Both former [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]] champion [[Bobby Labonte]] and current [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]] team [[Go Fas Racing]] made their Euro Series debuts in 2018. Labonte, in his first season as a full-time driver since 2011, scored a second place finish at the second race in Tours (the only oval race meet in the schedule) and would finish 14th in the standings with 1 Top 5 and 3 Top 10 finishes. Go Fas impressed in their debut season, finishing fourth in the team's championship with their Elite 2 driver Florian Venturi being in the championship hunt for much of the season. [[NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series|Truck Series]] regular [[Jennifer Jo Cobb]] also made an appearance at Valencia, driving for Racing Total in the Elite 2 class, a decision that ultimately allowed Racing Total driver [[Justin Kunz]] to make a Truck Series start for Jo Cobb's Truck [[Jennifer Jo Cobb Racing|team]] in [[Canadian Tire Motorsport Park|Mosport]]. [[NASCAR Pinty's Series|Pinty's Series]] driver [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Dumoulin]] and [[NASCAR K&N Pro Series East|K&N East]] driver [[Dale Quarterley]] made an appearance at Zolder as part of a driver exchange program that the Euro Series ran in conjunction with Pinty's Series and K&N East. Former [[B. J. McLeod Motorsports]] driver [[Stephen Young (racing driver)|Stephen Young]] also made an appearance this season, driving for Racing Total's #10 entry at Tours in the Elite 2 class.\n\n==Standings==\n{{See|List of NASCAR points scoring systems}}\n\nPoints are awarded to drivers and team using the current point system used in [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]], [[NASCAR Xfinity Series]], and [[NASCAR Camping World Truck Series]], excluding the Stage and Race Winner bonus points.

Gabillon took the championship lead soon after and would lead the championship by the time the playoffs begin at Hockenheim. Problems for both Gabillon and Day at Hockenheim, however, allowed [[Lucas Lasserre]] of Mishumotors and rookie [[Loris Hezemans]] of Hendriks Motorsport to close up the gap, setting up a four-way battle for the title at Zolder. Ultimately, retirements for both Lasserre and Hezemans during the first race of the Zolder race meet effectively eliminated them from title contention, and with Gabillon unable to match Day's pace for the weekend, Alon Day was crowned champion after winning his seventh race of the season at the final race of the season. Alon Day's seven race wins set a new record for the most races won in a single Elite 1 Euro Series season, one short of [[Stienes Longin]]'s overall record of 8 wins in the [[2016 NASCAR Whelen Euro Series|2016]] Elite 2 season. Gabillon won two races (Brands Hatch 1 and Tours 1), while Lassere (Franciacorta 2), Hezemans (Hockenheim 1), and 2015 Elite 2 champion [[Gianmarco Ercoli]] (Brands Hatch 2) scored one race win each.\n\nIn the Elite 2 class, the championship was closely fought between four drivers: [[Ulysse Delsaux]] of RDV Comp\u00e9tition, defending champions Wilfried Boucenna of [[Knauf|Knauf \nRacing]], Florian Venturi of [[Go Fas Racing]], and the returning Guillaume Deflandre for Memphis Racing. Boucenna initially took the championship lead after sweeping both races at Valencia. However, problems for Boucenna at Franciacorta Race 2 allowed Deflandre to caught up to him, and further problems for Boucenna at the first race of Brands Hatch race meet allowed Deflandre to take the championship lead. Delsaux then sweeps the Tours race week to take the lead in the championship, and looks set to sweep the Hockenheim race week had a tire failure in the second race at Hockenheim didn't force him to retire from the race. This allowed Deflandre, Boucenna, and a resurgent Venturi to set up a four-way battle for the championship. A costly retirement at race 1 of Zolder ultimately took out Deflandre of the championship hunt, and while Venturi was able to score a win and a second place finish at Zolder, Delsaux had enough gap between him and Venturi to take the championship with a third place finish at the final race of the season. Delsaux also scored the most race wins of the season with three (Tours sweep and Hockenheim 1). Venturi (Brands Hatch 2 and Zolder 1), Boucenna (Valencia sweep), Deflandre (Brands Hatch 1 and Hockenheim 2), and [[PK Carsport]]'s Guillaume Dumarey (Franciacorta 2 and Zolder 2) scored two race wins, while Brazilian Felipe Rabello (Franciacorta 1) scored one race win.\n\nIn the team's championship, with both of their drivers being in the championship hunt for the entirety of the season, RDV Comp\u00e9tition's #3 team comfortably won team's title, finishing 107 points clear of Knauf Racing's #37 team. New teams Memphis Racing and Go Fas Racing scored an impressive third and fourth place finish, while Knauf Racing's #73 team completes the top five in the team's championship.\n\nIn the manufacturer's championship, [[Toyota]] claimed their first Euro Series manufacturers title, becoming the first manufacturer to successfully topple [[Chevrolet]] from the top spot. Toyota's championship hopes were helped by the decision made by Alon Day's team [[CAAL Racing]] to switch manufacturers from Chevrolet to Toyota mid-season, giving Toyota the crucial edge they need to secure the manufacturer's title.\n\nNotably, this season saw a noticeable increase in attention from the other side of the Atlantic. Both former [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]] champion [[Bobby Labonte]] and current [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]] team [[Go Fas Racing]] made their Euro Series debuts in 2018. Labonte, in his first season as a full-time driver since 2011, scored a second place finish at the second race in Tours (the only oval race meet in the schedule) and would finish 14th in the standings with 1 Top 5 and 3 Top 10 finishes. Go Fas impressed in their debut season, finishing fourth in the team's championship with their Elite 2 driver Florian Venturi being in the championship hunt for much of the season. [[NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series|Truck Series]] regular [[Jennifer Jo Cobb]] also made an appearance at Valencia, driving for Racing Total in the Elite 2 class, a decision that ultimately allowed Racing Total driver [[Justin Kunz]] to make a Truck Series start for Jo Cobb's Truck [[Jennifer Jo Cobb Racing|team]] in [[Canadian Tire Motorsport Park|Mosport]]. [[NASCAR Pinty's Series|Pinty's Series]] driver [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Dumoulin]] and [[NASCAR K&N Pro Series East|K&N East]] driver [[Dale Quarterley]] made an appearance at Zolder as part of a driver exchange program that the Euro Series ran in conjunction with Pinty's Series and K&N East. Former [[B. J. McLeod Motorsports]] driver [[Stephen Young (racing driver)|Stephen Young]] also made an appearance this season, driving for Racing Total's #10 entry at Tours in the Elite 2 class.\n\n==Standings==\n{{See|List of NASCAR points scoring systems}}\n\nPoints are awarded to drivers and team using the current point system used in [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]], [[NASCAR Xfinity Series]], and [[NASCAR Camping World Truck Series]], excluding the Stage and Race Winner bonus points.

Most national government offices provide services through their regional branches instead of having direct provincial or city offices. These regional offices are usually (but not always) located in the city designated as the regional center.\n\nCurrently, the Philippines is divided into 17 regions. Sixteen of these are mere administrative groupings, each provided by the [[President of the Philippines]] with a regional development council (RDC) \u2013 in the case of the [[Metro Manila|National Capital Region]], an additional [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority|metropolitan authority]] serves as the coordinating and policy-making body. Only one, the [[Bangsamoro|Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]], has an elected government to which the [[Congress of the Philippines]] has delegated certain powers and responsibilities.\n\n== History ==\nRegions first came to existence on September 24, 1972, when the provinces of the Philippines were organized into eleven regions under Presidential Decree \u2116 1 as part of the ''Integrated Reorganization Plan'' of the former [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]].\n\nSince that time, other regions have been created and some provinces have been transferred from one region to another.\n\n* June 22, 1973: [[Pangasinan]] was transferred from [[Central Luzon|Region III]] to [[Ilocos Region|Region I]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1973/pd_224_1973.html| title = Presidential Decree \u2116 224| access-date = November 5, 2016}}</ref>\n* July 7, 1975: ''Region XII'' created and minor reorganization of some [[Mindanao]] regions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1975/pd_742_1975.html|title=Presidential Decree No. 742; Restructuring the Regional Organization of Mindanao, Basilan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi|publisher=The Lawphil Project|date=July 7, 1975|access-date=June 6, 2015}}</ref>\n* July 25, 1975: ''Regions IX'' and ''XII'' declared as Autonomous Regions in Western and Central Mindanao respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1979/pd_1618_1979.html|title=Presidential Decree No. 1618; Implementing the Organization of the Sangguniang Pampook and the Lupong Tagapagpaganap ng Pook in Region IX and Region XII and for Other Purposes|publisher=The Lawphil Project|date=July 25, 1975|access-date=June 6, 2015}}</ref>\n* August 21, 1975: ''Region IX'' divided into ''Sub-Region IX-A'' and ''Sub-Region IX-B''.

Most national government offices provide services through their regional branches instead of having direct provincial or city offices. These regional offices are usually (but not always) located in the city designated as the regional center.\n\nCurrently, the Philippines is divided into 17 regions.

This [[secondary alcohol]] is a flammable, colorless liquid that is soluble in 3 parts water and completely miscible with organic solvents.  It is produced on a large scale, primarily as a precursor to the industrial solvent [[methyl ethyl ketone]].  2-Butanol is [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] and thus can be obtained as either of two [[stereoisomerism|stereoisomers]] designated as (''R'')-(\u2212)-2-butanol and (''S'')-(+)-2-butanol. It is normally encountered as a 1:1 mixture of the two stereoisomers &mdash; a [[racemic]] mixture.\n\n<center>\n{|align=\"center\"  class=\"wikitable\"\n|<center>[[File:R-butan-2-ol 2D skeletal.png|160px]]</center>||<center>[[File:S-butan-2-ol 2D skeletal.png|160px]]\n|-\n|<center>[[File:R-Butan-2-ol-3D-balls.png|160px]]</center>||<center>[[File:S-Butan-2-ol-3D-balls.png|160px]]\n|-\n|<center>(''R'')-(\u2212)-2-butanol</center>||<center>(''S'')-(+)-2-butanol</center>\n|}\n</center>\n\n==Manufacture and applications==\n2-Butanol is manufactured industrially by the [[hydration reaction|hydration]] of [[1-butene]] or [[2-butene]]:\n:[[Image:But-2-ene-hydration-2D-skeletal.png|300px]]\n[[Sulfuric acid]] is used as a [[catalyst]] for this conversion.<ref name=Ull>{{Ullmann | first1 = Heinz-Dieter | last1 = Hahn | first2 = Georg | last2 = D\u00e4mbkes | first3 = Norbert | last3 = Rupprich | title = Butanols|year=2005}}.</ref>\n\nIn the laboratory it can be prepared via [[Grignard reaction]] by reacting [[ethylmagnesium bromide]] with [[acetaldehyde]] in dried [[diethyl ether]] or [[tetrahydrofuran]].\n\nAlthough some 2-butanol is used as a solvent, it is mainly converted to [[butanone]] (methyl ethyl ketone, MEK), which is an important industrial solvent and found in many domestic cleaning agents and paint removers.

Even the [[International Programme on Chemical Safety]] lists the wrong solubility.  This widespread error originated because of Beilstein's ''Handbuch der Organischen Chemie'' (''Handbook of Organic Chemistry'').  This work cites a false solubility of 12.5&nbsp;g/100&nbsp;g water. Many other sources used this solubility, which has snowballed into a widespread error in the industrial world.

This [[secondary alcohol]] is a flammable, colorless liquid that is soluble in 3 parts water and completely miscible with organic solvents.  It is produced on a large scale, primarily as a precursor to the industrial solvent [[methyl ethyl ketone]].  2-Butanol is [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] and thus can be obtained as either of two [[stereoisomerism|stereoisomers]] designated as (''R'')-(\u2212)-2-butanol and (''S'')-(+)-2-butanol.

He was heavily relied upon for the later publications of [[Livy]] and [[Plutarch]]{{Citation needed|reason=Livy's first pentad predates Dionysius|date=April 2017}}.  He writes extensively on the myth, sometimes attributing direct quotations to its figures.  The myth spans the first 2 volumes of his ''Roman Antiquities'', beginning with Book I chapter 73 and concluding in Book II chapter 56. \n{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Romulus and Remus===\n\n====Origins and survival in the wild====\nDionysius claims that the twins were born to a [[Vestal virgins|vestal]] named [[Rea Silvia|Ilia Silvia]] (sometimes called Rea).  Her family descends from [[Aeneas]] of Troy and the daughter of [[Latinus|King Latinus]] of the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Original Latin tribes]].  [[Procas]], her grandfather had willed the throne to his son [[Numitor]] but he was later deposed by her uncle, [[Amulius]]. For fear of the threat that Numitor's heirs might pose, the king had Ilia's brother, Aegestus killed and blamed robbers.  The truth about the crime was known by some, including Numitor, who feigned ignorance.  Amulius then appointed Ilia to the [[Vestal virgins|Vestal priestesshood]], where her vow of chastity would prevent her from producing any further male rivals. Despite this, she became pregnant a few years later, claiming to have been raped.\n\nThe different accounts of the twins' conception are laid out, but Dionysius declines to choose one over the others. The sources variously relate that it was a suitor, Amulius himself (in full armor to conceal his identity), or even the god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] himself. The latter is supposed to have comforted Ilia by making her grieve, and telling her that she would bear twins whose bravery and triumphs would be unmatched.  Ilia hid her pregnancy with claims of illness so as to avoid her vestal duties.  Amulius suspected her and employed physicians and his wife to monitor her for signs of being with child. When he did discover the truth, she was placed under armed guard.  After being informed of the delivery of the twins, Amulius suspected that she had in fact given birth to triplets.  The third child had been concealed from the guards present.  Ilia was either put to death, or kept secretly in a hidden dungeon for the rest of her life.\n\nCiting [[Fabius]], [[Lucius Cincius Alimentus|Cincius]], [[Cato the Elder|Porcius Cato]], and [[Piso]], Dionysius recounts the most common tale.  The king orders the twins to be tossed into the Tiber.  When his servants arrived at the riverbank, high waters had made it impossible to reach the stream. They left the twin's basket in a pool of standing water on the site of the [[ficus Ruminalis]].  After the waters of the Tiber had carried the twins away, their basket is overturned by a rock and they are dumped into the mud. A she-wolf finds them there and [[Breastfeeding|nurses]] them in front of her lair (the ''[[Lupercal]]''). Plutarch places the [[Lupercal]] as at the foot of Palantine hill along the road to the [[Circus Maximus|Roman chariot grounds]] and was the source of a [[Spring (hydrology)|natural spring]].\n\n====Youth====\nThe twins were discovered by unnamed herdsmen, and when they arrive, the she-wolf calmly retreats into the cave.  [[Faustulus]], the man in charge of the royal [[abattoir]], happened upon the scene.  He had heard the story of Ilia's twin birth and the king's order, but never let on that he suspected the [[Child abandonment|foundlings]] were one and the same.  He persuaded the shepherds to allow him to take the boys home, and brought them to his wife, who had just delivered a [[stillbirth|stillborn]] child.  Later, quoting Fabius' account of the overthrow of Amulius, Dionysius claims that Faustulus had saved the basket in which the boys had been abandoned. {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAs they grew, the boys exhibited the graces and behavior of the royal-born. They passed their days living as herdsmen in the mountains, spending many nights in huts of reeds and sticks.<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">In his account of the conflict with Amulius, Livy claims that Faustulus, had always known that the boys had been abandoned by the order of the king and had hoped that they are of Royal blood. (Livy, ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri|History of Rome]]'' I.5)</ref>\n\nDionysius relates an alternate, \"non-fantastical\" version of Romulus and Remus' birth, survival and youth.  In this version, Numitor managed to switch the twins at birth with two other infants.  The twins were delivered by their grandfather to Faustulus to be fostered by him and his wife. Faustulus was descended from the [[Arcadia (ancient region)|first Greek]] colonists in [[Latium]]. He was the caretaker for Amulius' holdings around Palatine hill. He was persuaded to care for the twins by his brother [[Faustinus]], who tended the kings herds on nearby Aventine hill.\n\nTheir adopted mother was Faustulus' wife Laurentia, a former [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitute]].  According to Plutarch, {{Lang-la|lupa|label=none}} (Latin for \"wolf\") was a common term for members of her profession and this gave rise to the she-wolf legend. The twins receive a proper [[Education in ancient Rome|education]] in the city of [[Gabii]].\n\n====Overthrow of Amulius====\nAccording to Fabius, when the twins were 18, they became embroiled in a violent dispute with some of Numitor's herdsmen.  In retaliation, Remus was lured into an ambush and capture while Romulus was elsewhere. In [[Quintus Aelius Tubero|Aelius Tubero's]] version, the twins were taking part in the festivities of the [[Lupercalia]], requiring them to run naked through the village when Remus, defenseless as he was, was taken prisoner by Numitor's armed men.\n\nAfter rounding up the toughest herdsmen to help him free Remus, Romulus rashly set out for Alba Longa.  To avoid tragedy, Faustulus intercepted him and revealed the truth about the twins' parentage. With the discovery that Numitor was family, Romulus set his sights on Amulius, instead.  He and the rest of his village set out in small groups toward the city so that their arrival would go unnoticed by the guards.  Meanwhile, after being turned over to Numitor to determine his punishment, Remus was told of his origins by the former king and eagerly joins with him in their own effort to topple Amulius. When Romulus joined them at Numitor's home, the three of them began to plan their next move.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nBack home, Faustulus had begun to worry about how the twins' claims will be heard in Alba.  He decides to bolster them by bringing the basket in which they were abandoned to the city.  He's stopped by suspicious guards at the gates and he and the basket are seen by none-other-than the servant who had taken them to the river those many years before.  Under the questioning of the king, and after the king's insincere offers of benevolence toward his nephews, Faustulus, trying to protect Romulus and Remus, and escape the king's clutches, claimed he had been bringing the basket to the imprisoned Ilia at the twins request and that they were at the moment tending their flocks in the mountains.\n\nAmulius sent Faustulus and his men to find the boys.  He then tried to trick Numitor into coming to the palace so that the former king could be kept under guard until the situation had been dealt with.  Unfortunately for the king, the man he sent to lure Numitor into his clutches instead revealed everything that had happened at the palace.\n\nThe twins and their grandfather led their joint supporters to the palace, killed Amulius, and took control of the city.\n\nPlutarch continues the same alternate version of the twins' parentage and youth.  After the boys had returned home from their studies in Gabii, Numitor had the twins attack his own herdsmen and drive off his own cattle to contrive a complaint against his brother. To placate him, Amulius ordered not only the twins to be brought to the palace for trial, but all the others who were present, as well.  This is exactly what Numitor had hoped for.  When Romulus and Remus arrived in Alba, their grandfather revealed their true identity and he, the twins and the other herdsmen joined forces to attack Amulius, apparently killing him.\n\n====Death of Remus====\nThe now re-installed King Numitor granted Romulus and Remus control over the area around where Rome would be founded and sent some of Alba Longa's commoners and nobles along with them.  These included volunteers as well as his enemies, and other troublemakers and fifty families of the descendants of [[Aeneas|the Greeks]] who had settled in [[Old Latium|Italy]] after the [[Trojan War]]. The commoners were given provisions, weapons, slaves and livestock.\n\nWanting to use competition to better complete the many tasks ahead of them, each twin took command of half of the new group of colonists and natives.  Instead, the two groups each wanted their twin to be king.  Eventually, both Romulus and Remus began to harbor their own ambitions of being the sole ruler of the new city.  Things came to a head when a dispute broke out over the particular hill upon which Rome should be built. Romulus wanted to build on [[Palatine Hill]] for its significance to their childhood.  Remus chose [[Aventine Hill]] for its strategic advantages.  Finally, with no resolution in sight, they took the matter to Numitor.  He told each twin to stake out a spot on an appointed morning at dawn and wait for a \"[[Augury|bird omen]]\" from the gods to settle things.\n\nThey took his suggestion and the two brothers took their positions along with guard to prevent cheating.  No birds appeared to Romulus, but he tried to trick Remus by sending a message that he should come to him right away.  Ashamed, the messengers took their time, and while en route, Remus saw 6 vultures.  The messengers brought Remus back to his brother and when they arrived, Romulus was asked what type of bird he had seen (apparently owing to the ruse).  Unsure, Romulus was suddenly saved by the sudden arrival of 12 vultures.  He dismissed his brother's query and declared himself the winner.  Furious Remus refused to accept defeat.  This reignited the conflict between them.\n\nOutwardly, each twin acknowledged the other's claim to having won: Remus by seeing the vultures first, and Romulus by seeing more of them.  Privately, however, neither was willing to give in.  An armed battle broke out between their followers resulting in deaths among both.  Faustulus was so distraught over his inability to end the strife between his adopted sons that he threw himself into the middle of the fighting and was killed. Remus also fell.  Romulus was devastated at his personal losses as well as the many suffered by the twins' followers. Only after the intervention of Laurentia was he able to return to the job of founding the city.\n\nOther sources who are unnamed by Plutarch claimed that despite his anger over Romulus' conduct during the contest of the augury, Remus conceded and the construction of the city began on Palatine Hill. Out of resentment, he derided the city's newly-built walls and demonstrated their ineffectiveness by leaping over them, saying that an enemy of Romulus could do the same.  In response, [[Celer (builder)|Celer]], the job's foreman, killed him on the spot with a blow to the head and implied that Remus himself had become his brother's enemy.\n\n===Foundation of Rome by Romulus===\nBefore construction on the city began [[Romulus]] made sacrifices and received good omens, and he then ordered the populace to ritually atone for their guilt. The city's fortifications were first and then housing for the populace.  He assembled the people and gave them the choice as to what type of government they wanted.  After his address, which extolled bravery in war abroad and moderation at home, and in which Romulus denied any need to remain in power, the people decided to remain a kingdom and asked him to remain its king.  Before accepting he looked for a sign of the approval of the gods.  He prayed and witnessed an auspicious lightning bolt, after which he declared that no king shall take the throne without receiving approval from the gods.\n\n====Institutions====\nHe divided Rome into 3 [[Roman tribe|tribes]], each selected a [[Tribune]] in charge of each.  Each tribe was divided into 10 [[Curia]], and each of those into smaller units.  He divided the kingdom's land holdings between them.  Plutarch suggests that [[Classical Athens|Athenian institutions]] were the inspiration for Romulus' creation of the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patrician]] class from the wealthy and virtuous.  All other Romans formed the [[Pleb]]eian class.  The Patricians were put in charge of religious, legal, and civil institutions, while the Plebs were to be farmers, herders, and tradesmen. Each curia was responsible for providing soldiers in the event of war.\n\nTo maintain order, every pleb had the right to choose a Patrician in a system of [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patronage]] ({{Lang-la|clientela|label=none}}). All patrons (''{{Lang-la|patronus|label=none}}'') were required to protect the rights and interests of those plebs (''{{Lang-la|cliens|label=none}}'') beneath them. In return, all plebs were required to support his patron in his endeavors and assist him when needed.  It was illegal for either party to testify against one another or otherwise act against the interests of the other.  Romulus then proceeded to establish the [[Roman senate|senate]]\u2014another act that Dionysius attributes to Greek influence. He selected 300 of the strongest and fittest among the nobles to become his personal bodyguard and messengers.  The ''celeres'' were so-named either for their quickness or, according to [[Valerius Antias]], for their commander. These were the first [[Roman cavalry]] and were vital to many Roman victories.\n\nRomulus then delimited the [[Separation of power|various powers]] of the institutions he had created.  The Roman king was made the ultimate authority in all religious and legal matters.  He would personally hear the cases of \"the greatest crimes\", but after reaching a decision, his opinion would be subject to approval by the people.  He would be the commander in chief of the military in wartime.\n\nThe senate would have the power to decide any matter or issue brought to them by the king with a binding vote (attributed by Dionysius to the [[Lacedaemonians]]).  The popular assemblies had the power to elect magistrates, pass laws, and declare war at the king's discretion.\n\nRomulus passed laws meant to encourage child-rearing.  He welcomed free men of any background to settle in the new city with promises of citizenship and an offer of [[Right of asylum|protection]] from those from home who might be pursuing them.  Immigrants flocked to Rome as a result.  Rome would also benefit from their practice of sending colonists to newly conquered cities and allowing the subjugated to carry on as they had before.  More common in the Greek world was to treat those they defeated harshly. Rome grew 10 times its size during Romulus' reign.\n\nIn an extensive exploration of the various, lurid traditions of the day, Dionysius effusively praises the manner in which Romulus organized and established Rome's religious customs and practices.  He attributes to the king everything from the founding of temples to defining the sphere of individual gods; their festivals and the blessings they would each bestow.  Among the Greek and native traditions, he kept only those he deemed worthy and rejected any that were too unseemly or otherwise unfit for Roman society.\n\nAccording to [[Terentius Varro]], Romulus appointed a large number of Roman men and women to religious offices during his reign.  He also allowed the various curiae to select their own.  He adopted the Greek practice of appointing children to participate in the city's ceremonies.  He established an office of augury, which would ensure the approval of the gods during all worship undertaken. Each curia was required to sacrifice and give offerings in a way so specified.  He established budgets for religious practice in the city.[[File:Bernard van Orley - Romulus Gives Laws to the Roman People - WGA16696.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Bernard van Orley - Romulus Gives Laws to the Roman People - WGA16696]]\n====Legal system====\nAgain, Dionysius thoroughly describes the laws of other nations before contrasting the approach of Romulus and lauding his work.  The Roman law governing marriage is, according to his ''Antiquities'', an elegant yet simple improvement over that of other nations, most of which he harshly derides. By declaring that wives would share equally in the possessions and conduct of their husband, Romulus promoted virtue in the former and deterred mistreatment by the latter.  Wives could inherit upon their husband's death.  A wife's adultery was a serious crime, however, drunkenness could be a mitigating factor in determining the appropriate punishment.  Because of his laws, Dionysius claims that not a single Roman couple divorced over the following five centuries.  His laws governing parental rights, in particular, those that allow fathers to maintain power over their adult children were an improvement over those of others.\n\nUnder the laws of Romulus, native-born free Roman's were limited to two forms of employment: farming and the army. All other occupations were filled by slaves or non-Roman labor.\n\nRomulus used the trappings of his office to encourage compliance with the law. His court was imposing and filled with loyal soldiers and he was always accompanied by the [[lictor|12 lictors]] appointed to be his attendants.\n\n====Rape of the Sabine women====\n{{Further information|Battle of the Lacus Curtius}}\nAccording to [[Gnaeus Gellius]], in Romulus' fourth year in power, the recently founded city of Rome, its population having swollen with immigrants, found itself surrounded by unfriendly neighbors and short of marriageable women.  Romulus sought to solve both problems through intermarrying with the other cities in the region, but he was rebuffed.  His solution, having been approved by his grandfather, received the auspices of the gods, and the support of the senate began with the announcement of a spectacular festival and competitions to honor the god [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], and to which all of Rome's neighbors were welcome.  They came from far and wide, sometimes entire families, to attend and participate.\n\nTo the shock and horror of the guests, at the king's signal Romans began [[Bride kidnapping|abducting]] the young women in attendance. Later, the women are brought before him where he assures them that he and the other men of Rome intend to honorably marry them and that they won't be sexually exploited in any way. This eases their fears.\n\nThe cities of  [[Caenina (town)|Caenina]], [[Crustumerium]], and [[Antemnae]] petition [[Tatius]], king of the [[Sabines]] to lead a joint attack in response to the kidnappings.  Their goal was stymied by Rome's own diplomatic efforts and the other three cities eventually concluded that Tatius was delaying any action on purpose. They decided to attack Rome without the Sabines and their armies were defeated and their cities captured each in turn.\n\nThe wars that resulted from the mass abduction committed by the Romans came to a climax in an epic battle fought at the foot of the Capitoline Hill. After the Sabines had captured the Roman Citadel through guile, they occupied the most strategically important point in the city with the help, knowing or otherwise, of [[Tarpeia]]. After several skirmishes and minor engagements, the armies fought two pitched battles featuring valor and losses to both sides.\n\n[[File:The Intervention of the Sabine Women.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Intervention of the Sabine Women, by [[Jacques-Louis David]], 1799]]\nIn the course of the battle, both sides found themselves on the verge of defeat, only to turn the tide back in the nick of time. Romulus himself was injured by a rock to the head. The fighting ceased only by the coming of dusk. Afterward, the Sabine women, led by the noble [[Hersilia]], convinced the two kings to make peace.\n\nAfter a ceasefire, the nations agreed to become a single kingdom under the joint rule of Romulus and Tatius.  The city was expanded and its institutions were adjusted to accommodate the new increase in population and to demonstrate their mutual goodwill.  The joint kingship lasted for four years until the death of Tatius.  During this time they conquered the [[Camerini]] and made their city a [[Romanization (cultural)|Roman colony]].\n\n====Deaths of Tatius and Romulus====\nThe two peoples are merged under a joint throne with Rome as the capital.  The Sabines and Romans alike were then declared ''[[Quirites]]'',  from the Sabine city of [[Cures, Sabinum|Cures]].  To honor the Sabine women, when Romulus divided the city into 30 [[Curia|local councils]], he named them after the women.  He also recruited three new units of knights and called them [[Roman cavalry|Ramnenses Tatiensis]] (from the two kings' names).\n\nSome of Tatius' friends victimized some [[Laurentum|Laurentii]] and when the city sent ambassadors to demand justice, Tatius would not allow Romulus to hand the perpetrators over to them.  A group of Sabines waylayed the ambassadors as they slept on the way home.  Some escaped and when word got back to Rome, Romulus promptly turned the men responsible\u2014including one of Tatius' family members\u2014over to a new group of ambassadors.  Tatius followed the group out of the city and freed the accused men by force.  Later, while both kings were participating in a sacrifice in [[Lavinium]], Tatius was killed in retribution.\n\nThe account of [[Licinius Macer]] recounts that Tatius was killed when he went alone to try and convince the victims in Lavinium to forgive the crimes committed.  When they discovered he had not brought the men responsible with him, as the senate and Romulus had ordered, an angry mob stones him to death.\n\nAfter his rule had turned more dictatorial, Romulus met his end, whether through actions divine or earthly.  According to some reports, Romulus is swept up into heaven, where he takes his place among the gods as [[Quirinus]].  Others point to the hands of the nobility, who had grown ever more resentful of their treatment by the king.\n\n==Editions==\n* Collected Works edited by [[Friedrich Sylburg]] (1536\u20131596) (parallel Greek and Latin) (Frankfurt 1586) ([https://books.google.com/books?id=PMgaIq4TBZEC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false available at Google Books])\n*Complete edition by [[Johann Jakob Reiske]] (1774\u20131777){{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n*''Archaeologia'' by [[A.

He was heavily relied upon for the later publications of [[Livy]] and [[Plutarch]]{{Citation needed|reason=Livy's first pentad predates Dionysius|date=April 2017}}.  He writes extensively on the myth, sometimes attributing direct quotations to its figures.  The myth spans the first 2 volumes of his ''Roman Antiquities'', beginning with Book I chapter 73 and concluding in Book II chapter 56. \n{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n===Romulus and Remus===\n\n====Origins and survival in the wild====\nDionysius claims that the twins were born to a [[Vestal virgins|vestal]] named [[Rea Silvia|Ilia Silvia]] (sometimes called Rea).  Her family descends from [[Aeneas]] of Troy and the daughter of [[Latinus|King Latinus]] of the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Original Latin tribes]].  [[Procas]], her grandfather had willed the throne to his son [[Numitor]] but he was later deposed by her uncle, [[Amulius]].  For fear of the threat that Numitor's heirs might pose, the king had Ilia's brother, Aegestus killed and blamed robbers.  The truth about the crime was known by some, including Numitor, who feigned ignorance.  Amulius then appointed Ilia to the [[Vestal virgins|Vestal priestesshood]], where her vow of chastity would prevent her from producing any further male rivals.  Despite this, she became pregnant a few years later, claiming to have been raped.\n\nThe different accounts of the twins' conception are laid out, but Dionysius declines to choose one over the others.  The sources variously relate that it was a suitor, Amulius himself (in full armor to conceal his identity), or even the god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] himself.  The latter is supposed to have comforted Ilia by making her grieve, and telling her that she would bear twins whose bravery and triumphs would be unmatched.  Ilia hid her pregnancy with claims of illness so as to avoid her vestal duties.  Amulius suspected her and employed physicians and his wife to monitor her for signs of being with child.  When he did discover the truth, she was placed under armed guard.  After being informed of the delivery of the twins, Amulius suspected that she had in fact given birth to triplets.  The third child had been concealed from the guards present.  Ilia was either put to death, or kept secretly in a hidden dungeon for the rest of her life.\n\nCiting [[Fabius]], [[Lucius Cincius Alimentus|Cincius]], [[Cato the Elder|Porcius Cato]], and [[Piso]], Dionysius recounts the most common tale.  The king orders the twins to be tossed into the Tiber.  When his servants arrived at the riverbank, high waters had made it impossible to reach the stream.  They left the twin's basket in a pool of standing water on the site of the [[ficus Ruminalis]].  After the waters of the Tiber had carried the twins away, their basket is overturned by a rock and they are dumped into the mud.  A she-wolf finds them there and [[Breastfeeding|nurses]] them in front of her lair (the ''[[Lupercal]]'').  Plutarch places the [[Lupercal]] as at the foot of Palantine hill along the road to the [[Circus Maximus|Roman chariot grounds]] and was the source of a [[Spring (hydrology)|natural spring]].\n\n====Youth====\nThe twins were discovered by unnamed herdsmen, and when they arrive, the she-wolf calmly retreats into the cave.  [[Faustulus]], the man in charge of the royal [[abattoir]], happened upon the scene.  He had heard the story of Ilia's twin birth and the king's order, but never let on that he suspected the [[Child abandonment|foundlings]] were one and the same.  He persuaded the shepherds to allow him to take the boys home, and brought them to his wife, who had just delivered a [[stillbirth|stillborn]] child.  Later, quoting Fabius' account of the overthrow of Amulius, Dionysius claims that Faustulus had saved the basket in which the boys had been abandoned. {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAs they grew, the boys exhibited the graces and behavior of the royal-born.  They passed their days living as herdsmen in the mountains, spending many nights in huts of reeds and sticks.\n\norphan footnote.<ref>In his account of the conflict with Amulius, Livy claims that Faustulus, had always known that the boys had been abandoned by the order of the king and had hoped that they are of Royal blood, ''Histories'' I.5</ref>\n\nDionysius relates an alternate, \"non-fantastical\" version of Romulus and Remus' birth, survival and youth.  In this version, Numitor managed to switch the twins at birth with two other infants.  The twins were delivered by their grandfather to Faustulus to be fostered by him and his wife.  Faustulus was descended from the [[Arcadia (ancient region)|first Greek]] colonists in [[Latium]].  He was the caretaker for Amulius' holdings around Palatine hill.  He was persuaded to care for the twins by his brother [[Faustinus]], who tended the kings herds on nearby Aventine hill.\n\nTheir adopted mother was Faustulus' wife Laurentia, a former [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitute]].  According to Plutarch, ''lupa''(Latin for \"wolf\") was a common term for members of her profession and this gave rise to the she-wolf legend.  The twins receive a proper [[Education in ancient Rome|education]] in the city of [[Gabii]].\n\n====Overthrow of Amulius====\nAccording to Fabius, when the twins were 18, they became embroiled in a violent dispute with some of Numitor's herdsmen.  In retaliation, Remus was lured into an ambush and capture while Romulus was elsewhere.  In [[Quintus Aelius Tubero|Aelius Tubero's]] version, the twins were taking part in the festivities of the [[Lupercalia]], requiring them to run naked through the village when Remus, defenseless as he was, was taken prisoner by Numitor's armed men.\n\nAfter rounding up the toughest herdsmen to help him free Remus, Romulus rashly set out for Alba Longa.  To avoid tragedy, Faustulus intercepted him and revealed the truth about the twins' parentage.  With the discovery that Numitor was family, Romulus set his sights on Amulius, instead.  He and the rest of his village set out in small groups toward the city so that their arrival would go unnoticed by the guards.  Meanwhile, after being turned over to Numitor to determine his punishment, Remus was told of his origins by the former king and eagerly joins with him in their own effort to topple Amulius.  When Romulus joined them at Numitor's home, the three of them began to plan their next move.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nBack home, Faustulus had begun to worry about how the twins' claims will be heard in Alba.  He decides to bolster them by bringing the basket in which they were abandoned to the city.  He's stopped by suspicious guards at the gates and he and the basket are seen by none-other-than the servant who had taken them to the river those many years before.  Under the questioning of the king, and after the king's insincere offers of benevolence toward his nephews, Faustulus, trying to protect Romulus and Remus, and escape the king's clutches, claimed he had been bringing the basket to the imprisoned Ilia at the twins request and that they were at the moment tending their flocks in the mountains.\n\nAmulius sent Faustulus and his men to find the boys.  He then tried to trick Numitor into coming to the palace so that the former king could be kept under guard until the situation had been dealt with.  Unfortunately for the king, the man he sent to lure Numitor into his clutches instead revealed everything that had happened at the palace.\n\nThe twins and their grandfather led their joint supporters to the palace, killed Amulius, and took control of the city.\n\nPlutarch continues the same alternate version of the twins' parentage and youth.  After the boys had returned home from their studies in Gabii, Numitor had the twins attack his own herdsmen and drive off his own cattle to contrive a complaint against his brother.  To placate him, Amulius ordered not only the twins to be brought to the palace for trial, but all the others who were present, as well.  This is exactly what Numitor had hoped for.  When Romulus and Remus arrived in Alba, their grandfather revealed their true identity and he, the twins and the other herdsmen joined forces to attack Amulius, apparently killing him.\n\n====Death of Remus====\nThe now re-installed King Numitor granted Romulus and Remus control over the area around where Rome would be founded and sent some of Alba Longa's commoners and nobles along with them.  These included volunteers as well as his enemies, and other troublemakers and fifty families of the descendants of [[Aeneas|the Greeks]] who had settled in [[Old Latium|Italy]] after the [[Trojan War]]. The commoners were given provisions, weapons, slaves and livestock.\n\nWanting to use competition to better complete the many tasks ahead of them, each twin took command of half of the new group of colonists and natives.  Instead, the two groups each wanted their twin to be king.  Eventually, both Romulus and Remus began to harbor their own ambitions of being the sole ruler of the new city.  Things came to a head when a dispute broke out over the particular hill upon which Rome should be built.  Romulus wanted to build on [[Palatine Hill]] for its significance to their childhood.  Remus chose [[Aventine Hill]] for its strategic advantages.  Finally, with no resolution in sight, they took the matter to Numitor.  He told each twin to stake out a spot on an appointed morning at dawn and wait for a \"[[Augury|bird omen]]\" from the gods to settle things.\n\nThey took his suggestion and the two brothers took their positions along with guard to prevent cheating.  No birds appeared to Romulus, but he tried to trick Remus by sending a message that he should come to him right away.  Ashamed, the messengers took their time, and while en route, Remus saw 6 vultures.  The messengers brought Remus back to his brother and when they arrived, Romulus was asked what type of bird he had seen (apparently owing to the ruse).  Unsure, Romulus was suddenly saved by the sudden arrival of 12 vultures.  He dismissed his brother's query and declared himself the winner.  Furious Remus refused to accept defeat.  This reignited the conflict between them.\n\nOutwardly, each twin acknowledged the other's claim to having won: Remus by seeing the vultures first, and Romulus by seeing more of them.  Privately, however, neither was willing to give in.  An armed battle broke out between their followers resulting in deaths among both.  Faustulus was so distraught over his inability to end the strife between his adopted sons that he threw himself into the middle of the fighting and was killed.  Remus also fell.  Romulus was devastated at his personal losses as well as the many suffered by the twins' followers.  Only after the intervention of Laurentia was he able to return to the job of founding the city.\n\nOther sources who are unnamed by Plutarch claimed that despite his anger over Romulus' conduct during the contest of the augury, Remus conceded and the construction of the city began on Palatine Hill.  Out of resentment, he derided the city's newly-built walls and demonstrated their ineffectiveness by leaping over them, saying that an enemy of Romulus could do the same.  In response, [[Celer (builder)|Celer]], the job's foreman, killed him on the spot with a blow to the head and implied that Remus himself had become his brother's enemy.\n\n===Foundation of Rome by Romulus===\nBefore construction on the city began [[Romulus]] made sacrifices and received good omens, and he then ordered the populace to ritually atone for their guilt. The city's fortifications were first and then housing for the populace.  He assembled the people and gave them the choice as to what type of government they wanted.  After his address, which extolled bravery in war abroad and moderation at home, and in which Romulus denied any need to remain in power, the people decided to remain a kingdom and asked him to remain its king.  Before accepting he looked for a sign of the approval of the gods.  He prayed and witnessed an auspicious lightning bolt, after which he declared that no king shall take the throne without receiving approval from the gods.\n\n====Institutions====\nHe divided Rome into 3 [[Roman tribe|tribes]], each selected a [[Tribune]] in charge of each.  Each tribe was divided into 10 [[Curia]], and each of those into smaller units.  He divided the kingdom's land holdings between them.  Plutarch suggests that [[Classical Athens|Athenian institutions]] were the inspiration for Romulus' creation of the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patrician]] class from the wealthy and virtuous.  All other Romans formed the [[Pleb]]eian class.  The Patricians were put in charge of religious, legal, and civil institutions, while the Plebs were to be farmers, herders, and tradesmen.  Each curia was responsible for providing soldiers in the event of war.\n\nTo maintain order, every pleb had the right to choose a Patrician in a system of [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patronage]] (''clientela'').  All patrons (''patronus'') were required to protect the rights and interests of those plebs (''cliens'') beneath them.  In return, all plebs were required to support his patron in his endeavors and assist him when needed.  It was illegal for either party to testify against one another or otherwise act against the interests of the other.  Romulus then proceeded to establish the [[Roman senate|senate]]\u2014another act that Dionysius attributes to Greek influence.  He selected 300 of the strongest and fittest among the nobles to become his personal bodyguard and messengers.  The ''celeres'' were so-named either for their quickness or, according to [[Valerius Antias]], for their commander.  These were the first [[Roman cavalry]] and were vital to many Roman victories.\n\nRomulus then delimited the [[Separation of power|various powers]] of the institutions he had created.  The Roman king was made the ultimate authority in all religious and legal matters.  He would personally hear the cases of \"the greatest crimes\", but after reaching a decision, his opinion would be subject to approval by the people.  He would be the commander in chief of the military in wartime.\n\nThe senate would have the power to decide any matter or issue brought to them by the king with a binding vote (attributed by Dionysius to the [[Lacedaemonians]]).  The popular assemblies had the power to elect magistrates, pass laws, and declare war at the king's discretion.\n\nRomulus passed laws meant to encourage child-rearing.  He welcomed free men of any background to settle in the new city with promises of citizenship and an offer of [[Right of asylum|protection]] from those from home who might be pursuing them.  Immigrants flocked to Rome as a result.  Rome would also benefit from their practice of sending colonists to newly conquered cities and allowing the subjugated to carry on as they had before.  More common in the Greek world was to treat those they defeated harshly.  Rome grew 10 times its size during Romulus' reign.\n\nIn an extensive exploration of the various, lurid traditions of the day, Dionysius effusively praises the manner in which Romulus organized and established Rome's religious customs and practices.  He attributes to the king everything from the founding of temples to defining the sphere of individual gods; their festivals and the blessings they would each bestow.  Among the Greek and native traditions, he kept only those he deemed worthy and rejected any that were too unseemly or otherwise unfit for Roman society.\n\nAccording to [[Terentius Varro]], Romulus appointed a large number of Roman men and women to religious offices during his reign.  He also allowed the various curiae to select their own.  He adopted the Greek practice of appointing children to participate in the city's ceremonies.  He established an office of augury, which would ensure the approval of the gods during all worship undertaken.  Each curia was required to sacrifice and give offerings in a way so specified.  He established budgets for religious practice in the city.\n\n====Legal system====\n[[File:Bernard van Orley - Romulus Gives Laws to the Roman People - WGA16696.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Bernard van Orley - Romulus Gives Laws to the Roman People - WGA16696]]\nAgain, Dionysius thoroughly describes the laws of other nations before contrasting the approach of Romulus and lauding his work.  The Roman law governing marriage is, according to his ''Antiquities'', an elegant yet simple improvement over that of other nations, most of which he harshly derides.  By declaring that wives would share equally in the possessions and conduct of their husband, Romulus promoted virtue in the former and deterred mistreatment by the latter.  Wives could inherit upon their husband's death.  A wife's adultery was a serious crime, however, drunkenness could be a mitigating factor in determining the appropriate punishment.  Because of his laws, Dionysius claims that not a single Roman couple divorced over the following five centuries.  His laws governing parental rights, in particular, those that allow fathers to maintain power over their adult children were an improvement over those of others.\n\nUnder the laws of Romulus, native-born free Roman's were limited to two forms of employment: farming and the army.  All other occupations were filled by slaves or non-Roman labor.\n\nRomulus used the trappings of his office to encourage compliance with the law.  His court was imposing and filled with loyal soldiers and he was always accompanied by the [[lictor|12 lictors]] appointed to be his attendants.\n\n====Rape of the Sabine women====\n{{Further information|Battle of the Lacus Curtius}}\nAccording to [[Gnaeus Gellius]], in Romulus' fourth year in power, the recently founded city of Rome, its population having swollen with immigrants, found itself surrounded by unfriendly neighbors and short of marriageable women.  Romulus sought to solve both problems through intermarrying with the other cities in the region, but he was rebuffed.  His solution, having been approved by his grandfather, received the auspices of the gods, and the support of the senate began with the announcement of a spectacular festival and competitions to honor the god [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], and to which all of Rome's neighbors were welcome.  They came from far and wide, sometimes entire families, to attend and participate.\n\nTo the shock and horror of the guests, at the king's signal Romans began [[Bride kidnapping|abducting]] the young women in attendance. Later, the women are brought before him where he assures them that he and the other men of Rome intend to honorably marry them and that they won't be sexually exploited in any way. This eases their fears.\n\nThe cities of  [[Caenina (town)|Caenina]], [[Crustumerium]], and [[Antemnae]] petition [[Tatius]], king of the [[Sabines]] to lead a joint attack in response to the kidnappings.  Their goal was stymied by Rome's own diplomatic efforts and the other three cities eventually concluded that Tatius was delaying any action on purpose. They decided to attack Rome without the Sabines and their armies were defeated and their cities captured each in turn.\n\nThe wars that resulted from the mass abduction committed by the Romans came to a climax in an epic battle fought at the foot of the Capitoline Hill. After the Sabines had captured the Roman Citadel through guile, they occupied the most strategically important point in the city with the help, knowing or otherwise, of [[Tarpeia]]. After several skirmishes and minor engagements, the armies fought two pitched battles featuring valor and losses to both sides.\n\n[[File:The Intervention of the Sabine Women.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Intervention of the Sabine Women, by [[Jacques-Louis David]], 1799]]\nIn the course of the battle, both sides found themselves on the verge of defeat, only to turn the tide back in the nick of time. Romulus himself was injured by a rock to the head. The fighting ceased only by the coming of dusk. Afterward, the Sabine women, led by the noble [[Hersilia]], convinced the two kings to make peace.\n\nAfter a ceasefire, the nations agreed to become a single kingdom under the joint rule of Romulus and Tatius.  The city was expanded and its institutions were adjusted to accommodate the new increase in population and to demonstrate their mutual goodwill.  The joint kingship lasted for four years until the death of Tatius.  During this time they conquered the [[Camerini]] and made their city a [[Romanization (cultural)|Roman colony]].\n\n====Deaths of Tatius and Romulus====\nThe two peoples are merged under a joint throne with Rome as the capital.  The Sabines and Romans alike were then declared ''[[Quirites]]'',  from the Sabine city of [[Cures, Sabinum|Cures]].  To honor the Sabine women, when Romulus divided the city into 30 [[Curia|local councils]], he named them after the women.  He also recruited three new units of knights and called them [[Roman cavalry|Ramnenses Tatiensis]] (from the two kings' names).\n\nSome of Tatius' friends victimized some [[Laurentum|Laurentii]] and when the city sent ambassadors to demand justice, Tatius would not allow Romulus to hand the perpetrators over to them.  A group of Sabines waylayed the ambassadors as they slept on the way home.  Some escaped and when word got back to Rome, Romulus promptly turned the men responsible\u2014including one of Tatius' family members\u2014over to a new group of ambassadors.  Tatius followed the group out of the city and freed the accused men by force.  Later, while both kings were participating in a sacrifice in [[Lavinium]], Tatius was killed in retribution.\n\nThe account of [[Licinius Macer]] recounts that Tatius was killed when he went alone to try and convince the victims in Lavinium to forgive the crimes committed.  When they discovered he had not brought the men responsible with him, as the senate and Romulus had ordered, an angry mob stones him to death.\n\nAfter his rule had turned more dictatorial, Romulus met his end, whether through actions divine or earthly.  According to some reports, Romulus is swept up into heaven, where he takes his place among the gods as [[Quirinus]].  Others point to the hands of the nobility, who had grown ever more resentful of their treatment by the king.\n\n==Editions==\n* Collected Works edited by [[Friedrich Sylburg]] (1536\u20131596) (parallel Greek and Latin) (Frankfurt 1586) ([https://books.google.com/books?id=PMgaIq4TBZEC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false available at Google Books])\n*Complete edition by [[Johann Jakob Reiske]] (1774\u20131777){{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n*''Archaeologia'' by [[A.

As of 2016, the Tejas Mark 1 was in production for the Indian Air Force (IAF) and the naval version was undergoing flight tests for Indian Navy (IN).
