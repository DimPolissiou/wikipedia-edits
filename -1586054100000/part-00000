Ciardi]] and their co-authors in 2001.<ref name=pti2001 />\n\nTheory predicts that, owing to Altair's rapid rotation, its [[surface gravity]] and [[effective temperature]] should be lower at the equator, making the equator less luminous than the poles. This phenomenon, known as [[gravity darkening]] or the [[von Zeipel effect]], was confirmed for Altair by measurements made by the [[Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer]] in 2001, and analyzed by Ohishi et al. (2004) and Peterson et al. (2006).<ref name=peterson06 /><ref>Asymmetric Surface Brightness Distribution of Altair Observed with the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer, Naoko Ohishi, Tyler E.

{"title_page": "Time management", "text_new": "'''[[\n* ]]'''{{short description|the process of planning and exercising conscious control of time spent on specific activities}}\n'''Time management''' is the process of [[planning]] and exercising [[conscious]] control of time spent on specific activities, especially to increase [[effectiveness]], [[efficiency]], and [[productivity]]. It involves a juggling act of various demands upon a person relating to [[Employment|work]], [[Interpersonal relationship|social life]], [[family]], [[hobby|hobbies]], personal interests and commitments with the finiteness of time. Using time effectively gives the person \"[[choice]]\" on spending/managing activities at their own time and expediency.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stella Cottrell|title=The Study Skills Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jjQdBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA122|year=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-28926-1|pages=123+}}</ref> Time management may be aided by a range of skills, tools, and techniques used to [[management|manage]] time when accomplishing specific tasks, projects, and goals complying with a due date. Initially, time management referred to just business or work activities, but eventually the term broadened to include personal activities as well. A time management system is a designed combination of processes, tools, techniques, and methods. Time management is usually a necessity in any [[project development]] as it determines the project completion time and scope. It is also important to understand that both technical and structural differences in time management exist due to variations in cultural concepts of time.\n\nThe major themes arising from the literature on time management include the following:\n* Creating an environment conducive to effectiveness\n* Setting of priorities\n* The related process of reduction of time spent on non-priorities\n* Implementation of goals\n\n==Related concepts==\n\nTime management is related to different concepts such as:\n* [[Project management]]: Time management can be considered to be a project management subset and is more commonly known as [[project planning]] and [[Schedule (project management)|project scheduling]]. Time management has also been identified as one of the core functions identified in project management.<ref>{{cite book |last=Project Management Institute |year=2004 |title=A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK Guide) |isbn=1-930699-45-X |url=https://archive.org/details/guidetoprojectma00proj |url-status=dead |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n* [[Attention management]] relates to the management of [[cognition|cognitive]] resources, and in particular the time that humans allocate their mind (and organize the minds of their employees) to conduct some activities.\n\nOrganizational time management is the science of identifying, valuing and reducing time cost wastage within organizations. It identifies, reports and financially values sustainable time, wasted time and effective time within an organization and develops the business case to convert wasted time into productive time through the funding of products, services, projects or initiatives at a positive return on investment.\n\n== Cultural views of time management ==\nDifferences in the way a culture views time can affect the way their time is managed. For example, a ''linear time'' view is a way of conceiving time as flowing from one moment to the next in a linear fashion. This linear perception of time is predominant in America along with most Northern European countries such as, Germany, Switzerland, and England.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/how-different-cultures-understand-time-2014-5|title=How Different Cultures Understand Time|last=Communications|first=Richard Lewis, Richard Lewis|website=Business Insider|access-date=2018-12-04}}</ref> People in these cultures tend to place a large value on productive time management, and tend to avoid decisions or actions that would result in wasted time.<ref name=\":0\" /> This linear view of time correlates to these cultures being more \u201cmonochronic\u201d, or preferring to do only one thing at a time. Generally speaking, this cultural view leads to a better focus on accomplishing a singular task and hence, more productive time management.\n\nAnother cultural time view is ''multi-active time'' view. In multi-active cultures, most people feel that the more activities or tasks being done at once the happier they are.<ref name=\":0\" /> Multi-active cultures are \u201cpolychronic\u201d or prefer to do multiple tasks at once. This multi-active time view is prominent in most Southern European countries such as Spain, Portugal, and Italy.<ref name=\":0\" /> In these cultures, the people often tend to spend time on things they deem to be more important such as placing a high importance on finishing social conversations.<ref name=\":0\" /> In business environments, they often pay little attention to how long meetings last, rather, the focus is on having high quality meetings. In general, the cultural focus tends to be on synergy and creativity over efficiency.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2016/05/different-cultures-see-deadlines-differently|title=Different Cultures See Deadlines Differently|last=Pant|first=Bhaskar|date=2016-05-23|website=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-12-04}}</ref>\n\nA final cultural time view is a ''cyclical time'' view. In cyclical cultures, time is considered neither linear nor event related. Because days, months, years, seasons, and events happen in regular repetitive occurrences, time is viewed as cyclical. In this view, time is not seen as wasted because it will always come back later, hence, there is an unlimited amount of it.<ref name=\":0\" /> This cyclical time view is prevalent throughout most countries in Asia including Japan, China, and Tibet. It is more important in cultures with cyclical concepts of time to complete tasks correctly, therefore, most people will spend more time thinking about decisions and the impact they will have before acting on their plans.<ref name=\":1\" /> Most people in cyclical cultures tend to understand that other cultures have different perspectives of time and are cognizant of this when acting on a global stage.\n\n==Creating an effective environment==\nSome{{which|date=July 2013}} time-management literature stresses tasks related to the creation of an environment conducive to \"real\" effectiveness. These strategies include principles such as:\n* \"get organized\" - the [[triage]] of paperwork and of tasks\n* \"protecting one's time\" by insulation, isolation and delegation\n* \"achievement through goal-management and through goal-focus\" - [[motivation]]al emphasis\n* \"recovering from bad time-[[habit]]s\" - [[Recovery model|recovery]] from underlying psychological problems, e.g. [[procrastination]]\n\nIn addition, the timing of tackling tasks is important as tasks requiring high levels of concentration and mental energy are often done in the beginning of the day when a person is more refreshed.  Literature{{which|date=July 2013}} also focuses on overcoming chronic psychological issues such as [[procrastination]].\n\nExcessive and chronic inability to manage time effectively may result from [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) or [[attention deficit disorder]] (ADD).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/index.shtml|title=NIMH \u00bb Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder|website=www.nimh.nih.gov|access-date=2018-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229084207/https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/index.shtml|archive-date=2016-12-29|url-status=live}}</ref> Diagnostic criteria include a sense of underachievement, difficulty getting organized, trouble getting started, trouble managing many simultaneous projects, and trouble with follow-through.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1                 = Hallowell\n| first1                = Edward M.\n| authorlink1           = Edward Hallowell (psychiatrist)\n| last2                 = Ratey\n| first2                = John J.\n| authorlink2           = John Ratey\n| title                 =  Driven To Distraction: Recognizing and Coping with Attention Deficit Disorder from Childhood Through Adulthood\n| url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=VVhASraP67IC\n| accessdate            = 2013-07-30\n| year                  = 1994\n| publisher             = Touchstone\n| isbn                  =  9780684801285\n| quote                 =\n}}\n</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2013}} Some authors{{which|date=July 2013}} focus on the [[prefrontal cortex]] which is the most recently evolved part of the brain. It controls the functions of attention span, impulse control, organization, learning from experience and self-monitoring, among others. Some authors{{howmany|date=July 2013}} argue that changing the way the prefrontal cortex works is possible and offer a solution.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/changeyourbrainc00amen_0|title=Change your brain, change your life : the breakthrough program for conquering anxiety, depression, obsessiveness, anger, and impulsiveness|last=Amen, Daniel G.|date=1998|publisher=Times Books|isbn=0-8129-2997-7|edition=1st|location=New York|oclc=38752969|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n==Setting priorities and goals==\n\nTime management strategies are often associated with the recommendation to set personal goals. The literature stresses themes such as:\n* \"Work in [[:wikt:priority|Priority]] Order\" \u2013 [[Goal setting|set goals]] and prioritize\n* \"Set gravitational goals\" \u2013 that attract actions automatically{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nThese goals are recorded and may be broken down into a [[project management|project]], an [[action plan]], or a simple task list. For individual tasks or for goals, an importance rating may be established, deadlines may be set, and priorities assigned. This process results in a plan with a task list or a schedule or calendar of activities. Authors may recommend a daily, weekly, monthly or other planning periods associated with different scope of planning or review. This is done in various ways, as follows.\n\n===ABCD analysis===\nA technique that has been used in [[business management]] for a long time is the categorization of large data into groups. These groups are often marked A, B, and C\u2014hence the name. Activities are ranked by these general criteria:\n* '''A''' \u2013 Tasks that are perceived as being urgent and important,\n* '''B''' \u2013 Tasks that are important but not urgent,\n* '''C''' \u2013 Tasks that are unimportant but urgent,\n* '''D''' \u2013 Tasks that are unimportant and not urgent.\nEach group is then rank-ordered by priority. To further refine the prioritization, some individuals choose to then force-rank all \"B\" items as either \"A\" or \"C\". ABC analysis can incorporate more than three groups.<ref name=Lakein>{{Cite book\n| publisher = P.H.

This principle is used to sort tasks into two parts. According to this form of [[Pareto analysis]] it is recommended that tasks that fall into the first category be assigned a higher priority.{{Clarify|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe [[Pareto principle|80-20-rule]] can also be applied to increase productivity: it is assumed that 80% of the productivity can be achieved by doing 20% of the tasks.

Note, however, that Eisenhower seems to say that things are never both important and urgent, or neither: So he has two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important.\n\n=== POSEC method ===\n\nPOSEC is an acronym for \"Prioritize by Organizing, Streamlining, Economizing and Contributing\". The method dictates a template which emphasizes an average individual's immediate sense of emotional and monetary security.

It is an [[inventory]] tool which serves as an alternative or supplement to [[memory]].\n\nTask lists are used in self-management,<!--needs disambiguation before creating a link to this term, as the current article for self-management is out of context for this article--> [[management|business management]], [[project management]], and [[software development]]. It may involve more than one list.\n\nWhen one of the items on a task list is accomplished, the task is [[checkmark|checked]] or [[cross]]ed off. The traditional method is to write these on a piece of paper with a [[pen]] or [[pencil]], usually on a note pad or clip-board. Task lists can also have the form of paper or software [[checklist]]s.\n\nWriter Julie Morgenstern suggests \"do's and don'ts\" of time management that include:\n* Map out everything that is important, by making a task list.\n* Create \"an oasis of time\" for one to control.\n* Say \"No\".\n* Set priorities.\n* Don't drop everything.\n* Don't think a critical task will get done in one's [[spare time]].<ref name=Morgenstern>{{Cite book\n| edition = 2nd\n| publisher = Henry Holt/Owl Books\n| isbn = 0-8050-7590-9\n| pages = 285\n| last = Morgenstern\n| first = Julie\n| title = Time Management from the Inside Out: The Foolproof System for Taking Control of Your Schedule\u2014and Your Life\n| location = New York\n| year = 2004\n}}</ref>\n\nNumerous digital equivalents are now available, including [[personal information management]] (PIM) applications and most [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]]. There are also several web-based task list applications, many of which are free.\n\n=== Task list organization ===\n\nTask lists are often diarised and tiered. The simplest tiered system includes a general to-do list (or task-holding file) to record all the tasks the person needs to accomplish, and a daily to-do list which is created each day by transferring tasks from the general to-do list. An alternative is to create a \"not-to-do list\", to avoid unnecessary tasks.<ref name=Morgenstern />\n\nTask lists are often prioritized:\n* A daily list of things to do, numbered in the order of their importance, and done in that order one at a time until daily time allows, is attributed to consultant [[Ivy Lee]] (1877\u20131934) as the most profitable advice received by [[Charles M.

In his system \"A\" items were the most important (\"A-1\" the most important within that group), \"B\" next most important, \"C\" least important.<ref name=Lakein />\n* A particular method of applying the ''ABC method''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dyslexia-college.com/schedule.html|title=Time Scheduling and Time Management for dyslexic students|work=Dyslexia at College|accessdate=October 31, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051026082426/http://www.dyslexia-college.com/schedule.html|archive-date=2005-10-26|url-status=live}} \u2014 ABC lists and tips for [[dyslexia|dyslexic]] students on how to manage to-do lists</ref> assigns \"A\" to tasks to be done within a [[day]], \"B\" a [[week]], and \"C\" a [[month]].\n* To prioritize a daily task list, one either records the tasks in the order of highest [[:wikt:priority|priority]], or assigns them a [[number]] after they are listed (\"1\" for highest priority, \"2\" for second highest priority, etc.) which indicates in which order to execute the tasks. The latter method is generally faster, allowing the tasks to be recorded more quickly.<ref name=Morgenstern />\n* Another way of prioritizing compulsory tasks (group A) is to put the most unpleasant one first. When it's done, the rest of the list feels easier. Groups B and C can benefit from the same idea, but instead of doing the first task (which is the most unpleasant) right away, it gives motivation to do other tasks from the list to avoid the first one.\n* A completely different approach which argues ''against'' prioritising altogether was put forward by British author [[Mark Forster (author)|Mark Forster]] in his book \"Do It Tomorrow and Other Secrets of Time Management\". This is based on the idea of operating \"closed\" to-do lists, instead of the traditional \"open\" to-do list. He argues that the traditional never-ending to-do lists virtually guarantees that some of your work will be left undone. This approach advocates getting all your work done, every day, and if you are unable to achieve it helps you diagnose where you are going wrong and what needs to change.<ref>{{Cite book\n| publisher = Hodder & Stoughton Religious\n| isbn = 0-340-90912-9\n| pages = [https://archive.org/details/doittomorrowothe0000fors/page/224 224]\n| last = Forster\n| first = Mark\n| authorlink = Mark Forster (author)\n| title = Do It Tomorrow and Other Secrets of Time Management\n| date = 2006-07-20\n| url = https://archive.org/details/doittomorrowothe0000fors/page/224\n}}</ref>\n\nVarious writers have stressed potential difficulties with to-do lists such as the following:\n* Management of the list can take over from implementing it. This could be caused by [[procrastination]] by prolonging the planning activity. This is akin to [[analysis paralysis]]. As with any activity, there's a point of diminishing returns.\n* To remain flexible, a task system must allow for disaster. A company must be ready for a disaster. Even if it is a small disaster, if no one made time for this situation, it can [[Metastasis|metastasize]], potentially causing damage to the company.<ref>Horton, Thomas. New York ''The CEO Paradox (1992)''</ref>\n* To avoid getting stuck in a wasteful pattern, the task system should also include regular (monthly, semi-annual, and annual) planning and system-evaluation sessions, to weed out inefficiencies and ensure the user is headed in the direction he or she truly desires.<ref>\"Tyranny of the Urgent\" essay by Charles Hummel 1967</ref>\n* If some time is not regularly spent on achieving long-range goals, the individual may get stuck in a perpetual holding pattern on short-term plans, like staying at a particular job much longer than originally planned.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.adaptrm.com/blog/time-management/| title=86 Experts Reveal Their Best Time Management Tips| accessdate=March 3, 2017| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303123713/https://www.adaptrm.com/blog/time-management/| archivedate=March 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Software applications ===\n\nMany companies use [[time tracking software]] to track an employee's working time, billable hours etc., e.g. [[law practice management software]].\n\nMany software products for time management support multiple users. They allow the person to give tasks to other users and use the software for communication.\n\nTask list applications may be thought of as lightweight [[personal information manager]] or [[project management software]].\n\nModern task list [[software application|applications]] may have built-in task hierarchy (tasks are composed of subtasks which again may contain subtasks),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.codeproject.com/tools/ToDoList2.asp|title=ToDoList 5.9.2 - A simple but effective way to keep on top of your tasks - The Code Project - Free Tools|work=ToDoList 5.9.2|accessdate=October 3, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122052326/http://www.codeproject.com/tools/ToDoList2.asp|archivedate=November 22, 2008}} \u2014 Features, code, and description for ToDoList 5.3.9, a project-based time management application</ref> may support multiple methods of filtering and ordering the list of tasks, and may allow one to associate arbitrarily long notes for each task.\n\nIn contrast to the concept of allowing the person to use multiple filtering methods, at least one software product additionally contains a mode where the software will attempt to dynamically determine the best tasks for any given moment.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://tech.gaeatimes.com/index.php/archive/top-10-time-management-software-for-windows/| publisher=Gaea News Network| last=Partho| date=18 February 2009| title=Top 10 Time Management Software for Windows| accessdate=October 9, 2016| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112000920/http://tech.gaeatimes.com/index.php/archive/top-10-time-management-software-for-windows/| archive-date=2017-01-12| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Time management systems===\n\nTime management systems often include a [[time clock]] or web-based application used to track an employee's work hours. Time management systems give employers insights into their workforce, allowing them to see, plan and manage employees' time. Doing so allows employers to control labor costs and increase productivity. A time management system automates processes, which eliminates paper work and tedious tasks.\n\n===GTD (Getting Things Done)===\n[[Getting Things Done]] was created by [[David Allen (author)|David Allen]]. The basic idea behind this method is to finish all the small tasks immediately and a big task is to be divided into smaller tasks to start completing now. The reasoning behind this is to avoid the [[information overload]] or \"brain freeze\" which is likely to occur when there are hundreds of tasks. The thrust of GTD is to encourage the user to get their tasks and ideas out and on paper and organized as quickly as possible so they're easy to manage and see.\n\n===Pomodoro===\nFrancesco Cirillo's \"[[Pomodoro Technique]]\" was originally conceived in the late 1980s and gradually refined until it was later defined in 1992. The technique is the namesake of a pomodoro (Italian for tomato) shaped kitchen timer initially used by Cirillo during his time at university. The \"Pomodoro\" is described as the fundamental metric of time within the technique and is traditionally defined as being 30 minutes long, consisting of 25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of break time. Cirillo also recommends a longer break of 15 to 30 minutes after every four Pomodoros. Through experimentation involving various work groups and mentoring activities, Cirillo determined the \"ideal Pomodoro\" to be 20\u201335 minutes long.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cirillo|first1=Francesco|title=The Pomodoro Technique|date=November 14, 2009|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1445219943}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}\n\n''''''==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Action item]]\n* [[African time]]\n* [[Attention management]]\n* [[Calendaring software]]\n* [[Chronemics]]\n* [[Flow (psychology)]]\n* [[Gantt chart]]\n* [[Goal [[]]]]\n* [[Interruption science]]\n* [[Maestro concept]]\n* [[Opportunity cost]]\n* [[Order (virtue)|Order]]\n* [[Polychronicity]]\n* [[Precommitment]]\n* [[Procrastination]]\n* [[Professional organizing]]\n* [[Prospective memory]]\n* [[Punctuality]]\n* [[Self-help]]\n* [[Time and attendance]]\n* [[Time perception]]\n* [[Time to completion]]\n* [[Time value of money]]\n* [[Work activity management]]\n* [[Workforce management]]\n* [[Workforce modeling]]\n{{div col end}}\n<!-- please keep entries in alphabetical order -->\n\n'''Book''':\n* [[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People]]\n\n'''Systems''':\n* [[Getting Things Done]]\n* [[Pomodoro Technique]]\n\n'''Psychology/neuroscience'''\n* [[Habit]]\n* [[Self-control]]\n* [[Impulsivity]]\n* [[Inhibitory control]]\n\n'''Psychiatry'''\n* [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Library resources box}}\n* {{Cite book\n| publisher = Viking\n| isbn = 978-0-670-88906-8\n| last = Allen\n| first = David\n| title = Getting things done: the Art of Stress-Free Productivity\n| location = New York\n| year = 2001\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n| publisher = Penguin Group\n| isbn = 978-1-58542-552-5\n| last = Fiore\n| first = Neil A\n| title = The Now Habit: A Strategic Program for Overcoming Procrastination and Enjoying Guilt- Free Play\n| location = New York\n| year = 2006\n| url = https://archive.org/details/nowhabitstrategi00fior_0\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n| publisher = Cranendonck Coaching\n| isbn = 978-90-79397-03-7\n| last = Le Blanc\n| first = Raymond\n| title = Achieving Objectives Made Easy!

It is also important to understand that both technical and structural differences in time management exist due to variations in cultural concepts of time.\n\nThe major themes arising from the literature on time management include the following:\n* Creating an environment conducive to effectiveness\n* Setting of priorities\n* The related process of reduction of time spent on non-priorities\n* Implementation of goals\n\n==Related concepts==\n\nTime management is related to different concepts such as:\n* [[Project management]]: Time management can be considered to be a project management subset and is more commonly known as [[project planning]] and [[Schedule (project management)|project scheduling]]. Time management has also been identified as one of the core functions identified in project management.<ref>{{cite book |last=Project Management Institute |year=2004 |title=A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK Guide) |isbn=1-930699-45-X |url=https://archive.org/details/guidetoprojectma00proj |url-status=dead |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n* [[Attention management]] relates to the management of [[cognition|cognitive]] resources, and in particular the time that humans allocate their mind (and organize the minds of their employees) to conduct some activities.\n\nOrganizational time management is the science of identifying, valuing and reducing time cost wastage within organizations. It identifies, reports and financially values sustainable time, wasted time and effective time within an organization and develops the business case to convert wasted time into productive time through the funding of products, services, projects or initiatives at a positive return on investment.\n\n== Cultural views of time management ==\nDifferences in the way a culture views time can affect the way their time is managed. For example, a ''linear time'' view is a way of conceiving time as flowing from one moment to the next in a linear fashion. This linear perception of time is predominant in America along with most Northern European countries such as, Germany, Switzerland, and England.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/how-different-cultures-understand-time-2014-5|title=How Different Cultures Understand Time|last=Communications|first=Richard Lewis, Richard Lewis|website=Business Insider|access-date=2018-12-04}}</ref> People in these cultures tend to place a large value on productive time management, and tend to avoid decisions or actions that would result in wasted time.<ref name=\":0\" /> This linear view of time correlates to these cultures being more \u201cmonochronic\u201d, or preferring to do only one thing at a time. Generally speaking, this cultural view leads to a better focus on accomplishing a singular task and hence, more productive time management.\n\nAnother cultural time view is ''multi-active time'' view. In multi-active cultures, most people feel that the more activities or tasks being done at once the happier they are.<ref name=\":0\" /> Multi-active cultures are \u201cpolychronic\u201d or prefer to do multiple tasks at once. This multi-active time view is prominent in most Southern European countries such as Spain, Portugal, and Italy.<ref name=\":0\" /> In these cultures, the people often tend to spend time on things they deem to be more important such as placing a high importance on finishing social conversations.<ref name=\":0\" /> In business environments, they often pay little attention to how long meetings last, rather, the focus is on having high quality meetings. In general, the cultural focus tends to be on synergy and creativity over efficiency.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2016/05/different-cultures-see-deadlines-differently|title=Different Cultures See Deadlines Differently|last=Pant|first=Bhaskar|date=2016-05-23|website=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-12-04}}</ref>\n\nA final cultural time view is a ''cyclical time'' view. In cyclical cultures, time is considered neither linear nor event related. Because days, months, years, seasons, and events happen in regular repetitive occurrences, time is viewed as cyclical. In this view, time is not seen as wasted because it will always come back later, hence, there is an unlimited amount of it.<ref name=\":0\" /> This cyclical time view is prevalent throughout most countries in Asia including Japan, China, and Tibet. It is more important in cultures with cyclical concepts of time to complete tasks correctly, therefore, most people will spend more time thinking about decisions and the impact they will have before acting on their plans.<ref name=\":1\" /> Most people in cyclical cultures tend to understand that other cultures have different perspectives of time and are cognizant of this when acting on a global stage.\n\n==Creating an effective environment==\nSome{{which|date=July 2013}} time-management literature stresses tasks related to the creation of an environment conducive to \"real\" effectiveness. These strategies include principles such as:\n* \"get organized\" - the [[triage]] of paperwork and of tasks\n* \"protecting one's time\" by insulation, isolation and delegation\n* \"achievement through goal-management and through goal-focus\" - [[motivation]]al emphasis\n* \"recovering from bad time-[[habit]]s\" - [[Recovery model|recovery]] from underlying psychological problems, e.g. [[procrastination]]\n\nIn addition, the timing of tackling tasks is important as tasks requiring high levels of concentration and mental energy are often done in the beginning of the day when a person is more refreshed.  Literature{{which|date=July 2013}} also focuses on overcoming chronic psychological issues such as [[procrastination]].\n\nExcessive and chronic inability to manage time effectively may result from [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) or [[attention deficit disorder]] (ADD).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/index.shtml|title=NIMH \u00bb Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder|website=www.nimh.nih.gov|access-date=2018-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229084207/https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/index.shtml|archive-date=2016-12-29|url-status=live}}</ref> Diagnostic criteria include a sense of underachievement, difficulty getting organized, trouble getting started, trouble managing many simultaneous projects, and trouble with follow-through.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1                 = Hallowell\n| first1                = Edward M.\n| authorlink1           = Edward Hallowell (psychiatrist)\n| last2                 = Ratey\n| first2                = John J.\n| authorlink2           = John Ratey\n| title                 =  Driven To Distraction: Recognizing and Coping with Attention Deficit Disorder from Childhood Through Adulthood\n| url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=VVhASraP67IC\n| accessdate            = 2013-07-30\n| year                  = 1994\n| publisher             = Touchstone\n| isbn                  =  9780684801285\n| quote                 =\n}}\n</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2013}} Some authors{{which|date=July 2013}} focus on the [[prefrontal cortex]] which is the most recently evolved part of the brain. It controls the functions of attention span, impulse control, organization, learning from experience and self-monitoring, among others. Some authors{{howmany|date=July 2013}} argue that changing the way the prefrontal cortex works is possible and offer a solution.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/changeyourbrainc00amen_0|title=Change your brain, change your life : the breakthrough program for conquering anxiety, depression, obsessiveness, anger, and impulsiveness|last=Amen, Daniel G.|date=1998|publisher=Times Books|isbn=0-8129-2997-7|edition=1st|location=New York|oclc=38752969|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n==Setting priorities and goals==\n\nTime management strategies are often associated with the recommendation to set personal goals. The literature stresses themes such as:\n* \"Work in [[:wikt:priority|Priority]] Order\" \u2013 [[Goal setting|set goals]] and prioritize\n* \"Set gravitational goals\" \u2013 that attract actions automatically{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nThese goals are recorded and may be broken down into a [[project management|project]], an [[action plan]], or a simple task list. For individual tasks or for goals, an importance rating may be established, deadlines may be set, and priorities assigned. This process results in a plan with a task list or a schedule or calendar of activities. Authors may recommend a daily, weekly, monthly or other planning periods associated with different scope of planning or review. This is done in various ways, as follows.\n\n===ABCD analysis===\nA technique that has been used in [[business management]] for a long time is the categorization of large data into groups. These groups are often marked A, B, and C\u2014hence the name. Activities are ranked by these general criteria:\n* '''A''' \u2013 Tasks that are perceived as being urgent and important,\n* '''B''' \u2013 Tasks that are important but not urgent,\n* '''C''' \u2013 Tasks that are unimportant but urgent,\n* '''D''' \u2013 Tasks that are unimportant and not urgent.\nEach group is then rank-ordered by priority. To further refine the prioritization, some individuals choose to then force-rank all \"B\" items as either \"A\" or \"C\". ABC analysis can incorporate more than three groups.<ref name=Lakein>{{Cite book\n| publisher = P.H.

This principle is used to sort tasks into two parts. According to this form of [[Pareto analysis]] it is recommended that tasks that fall into the first category be assigned a higher priority.{{Clarify|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe [[Pareto principle|80-20-rule]] can also be applied to increase productivity: it is assumed that 80% of the productivity can be achieved by doing 20% of the tasks.

Eisenhower]]. Note, however, that Eisenhower seems to say that things are never both important and urgent, or neither: So he has two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important.\n\n=== POSEC method ===\n\nPOSEC is an acronym for \"Prioritize by Organizing, Streamlining, Economizing and Contributing\". The method dictates a template which emphasizes an average individual's immediate sense of emotional and monetary security. It suggests that by attending to one's personal responsibilities first, an individual is better positioned to shoulder collective responsibilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.time-management-abilities.com/posec-method.html|title=The POSEC Method Of Time Management|website=Time-Management-Abilities.com|access-date=2019-08-29}}</ref>\n\nInherent in the acronym is a hierarchy of self-realization, which mirrors [[Abraham Maslow]]'s [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|hierarchy of needs]]:\n# '''P'''rioritize \u2013 Your time and define your life by goals.\n# '''O'''rganize \u2013 Things you have to accomplish regularly to be successful (family and finances).\n# '''S'''treamline \u2013 Things you may not like to do, but must do (work and chores).\n# '''E'''conomize \u2013 Things you should do or may even like to do, but they're not pressingly urgent (pastimes and socializing).\n# '''C'''ontribute \u2013 By paying attention to the few remaining things that make a difference (social obligations).\n\n==Elimination of non-priorities==\n\nTime management also covers how to eliminate tasks that do not provide value to the individual or organization.\n\nAccording to Sandberg,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB109460145618411891|title=To-Do Lists Can Take More Time Than Doing, But That Isn't the Point|first=Jared|last=Sandberg|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=2004-09-08|access-date=2018-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426213818/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB109460145618411891|archive-date=2018-04-26|url-status=live}} \u2014 a report on to-do lists and the people who make them and use them</ref> task lists \"aren't the key to productivity [that] they're cracked up to be\".

It is an [[inventory]] tool which serves as an alternative or supplement to [[memory]].\n\nTask lists are used in self-management,<!--needs disambiguation before creating a link to this term, as the current article for self-management is out of context for this article--> [[management|business management]], [[project management]], and [[software development]].

The traditional method is to write these on a piece of paper with a [[pen]] or [[pencil]], usually on a note pad or clip-board. Task lists can also have the form of paper or software [[checklist]]s.\n\nWriter Julie Morgenstern suggests \"do's and don'ts\" of time management that include:\n* Map out everything that is important, by making a task list.\n* Create \"an oasis of time\" for one to control.\n* Say \"No\".\n* Set priorities.\n* Don't drop everything.\n* Don't think a critical task will get done in one's [[spare time]].<ref name=Morgenstern>{{Cite book\n| edition = 2nd\n| publisher = Henry Holt/Owl Books\n| isbn = 0-8050-7590-9\n| pages = 285\n| last = Morgenstern\n| first = Julie\n| title = Time Management from the Inside Out: The Foolproof System for Taking Control of Your Schedule\u2014and Your Life\n| location = New York\n| year = 2004\n}}</ref>\n\nNumerous digital equivalents are now available, including [[personal information management]] (PIM) applications and most [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]]. There are also several web-based task list applications, many of which are free.\n\n=== Task list organization ===\n\nTask lists are often diarised and tiered. The simplest tiered system includes a general to-do list (or task-holding file) to record all the tasks the person needs to accomplish, and a daily to-do list which is created each day by transferring tasks from the general to-do list. An alternative is to create a \"not-to-do list\", to avoid unnecessary tasks.<ref name=Morgenstern />\n\nTask lists are often prioritized:\n* A daily list of things to do, numbered in the order of their importance, and done in that order one at a time until daily time allows, is attributed to consultant [[Ivy Lee]] (1877\u20131934) as the most profitable advice received by [[Charles M.

In his system \"A\" items were the most important (\"A-1\" the most important within that group), \"B\" next most important, \"C\" least important.<ref name=Lakein />\n* A particular method of applying the ''ABC method''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dyslexia-college.com/schedule.html|title=Time Scheduling and Time Management for dyslexic students|work=Dyslexia at College|accessdate=October 31, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051026082426/http://www.dyslexia-college.com/schedule.html|archive-date=2005-10-26|url-status=live}} \u2014 ABC lists and tips for [[dyslexia|dyslexic]] students on how to manage to-do lists</ref> assigns \"A\" to tasks to be done within a [[day]], \"B\" a [[week]], and \"C\" a [[month]].\n* To prioritize a daily task list, one either records the tasks in the order of highest [[:wikt:priority|priority]], or assigns them a [[number]] after they are listed (\"1\" for highest priority, \"2\" for second highest priority, etc.) which indicates in which order to execute the tasks. The latter method is generally faster, allowing the tasks to be recorded more quickly.<ref name=Morgenstern />\n* Another way of prioritizing compulsory tasks (group A) is to put the most unpleasant one first. When it's done, the rest of the list feels easier. Groups B and C can benefit from the same idea, but instead of doing the first task (which is the most unpleasant) right away, it gives motivation to do other tasks from the list to avoid the first one.\n* A completely different approach which argues ''against'' prioritising altogether was put forward by British author [[Mark Forster (author)|Mark Forster]] in his book \"Do It Tomorrow and Other Secrets of Time Management\". This is based on the idea of operating \"closed\" to-do lists, instead of the traditional \"open\" to-do list. He argues that the traditional never-ending to-do lists virtually guarantees that some of your work will be left undone. This approach advocates getting all your work done, every day, and if you are unable to achieve it helps you diagnose where you are going wrong and what needs to change.<ref>{{Cite book\n| publisher = Hodder & Stoughton Religious\n| isbn = 0-340-90912-9\n| pages = [https://archive.org/details/doittomorrowothe0000fors/page/224 224]\n| last = Forster\n| first = Mark\n| authorlink = Mark Forster (author)\n| title = Do It Tomorrow and Other Secrets of Time Management\n| date = 2006-07-20\n| url = https://archive.org/details/doittomorrowothe0000fors/page/224\n}}</ref>\n\nVarious writers have stressed potential difficulties with to-do lists such as the following:\n* Management of the list can take over from implementing it. This could be caused by [[procrastination]] by prolonging the planning activity. This is akin to [[analysis paralysis]]. As with any activity, there's a point of diminishing returns.\n* To remain flexible, a task system must allow for disaster. A company must be ready for a disaster. Even if it is a small disaster, if no one made time for this situation, it can [[Metastasis|metastasize]], potentially causing damage to the company.<ref>Horton, Thomas. New York ''The CEO Paradox (1992)''</ref>\n* To avoid getting stuck in a wasteful pattern, the task system should also include regular (monthly, semi-annual, and annual) planning and system-evaluation sessions, to weed out inefficiencies and ensure the user is headed in the direction he or she truly desires.<ref>\"Tyranny of the Urgent\" essay by Charles Hummel 1967</ref>\n* If some time is not regularly spent on achieving long-range goals, the individual may get stuck in a perpetual holding pattern on short-term plans, like staying at a particular job much longer than originally planned.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.adaptrm.com/blog/time-management/| title=86 Experts Reveal Their Best Time Management Tips| accessdate=March 3, 2017| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303123713/https://www.adaptrm.com/blog/time-management/| archivedate=March 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Software applications ===\n\nMany companies use [[time tracking software]] to track an employee's working time, billable hours etc., e.g. [[law practice management software]].\n\nMany software products for time management support multiple users. They allow the person to give tasks to other users and use the software for communication.\n\nTask list applications may be thought of as lightweight [[personal information manager]] or [[project management software]].\n\nModern task list [[software application|applications]] may have built-in task hierarchy (tasks are composed of subtasks which again may contain subtasks),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.codeproject.com/tools/ToDoList2.asp|title=ToDoList 5.9.2 - A simple but effective way to keep on top of your tasks - The Code Project - Free Tools|work=ToDoList 5.9.2|accessdate=October 3, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122052326/http://www.codeproject.com/tools/ToDoList2.asp|archivedate=November 22, 2008}} \u2014 Features, code, and description for ToDoList 5.3.9, a project-based time management application</ref> may support multiple methods of filtering and ordering the list of tasks, and may allow one to associate arbitrarily long notes for each task.\n\nIn contrast to the concept of allowing the person to use multiple filtering methods, at least one software product additionally contains a mode where the software will attempt to dynamically determine the best tasks for any given moment.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://tech.gaeatimes.com/index.php/archive/top-10-time-management-software-for-windows/| publisher=Gaea News Network| last=Partho| date=18 February 2009| title=Top 10 Time Management Software for Windows| accessdate=October 9, 2016| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112000920/http://tech.gaeatimes.com/index.php/archive/top-10-time-management-software-for-windows/| archive-date=2017-01-12| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Time management systems===\n\nTime management systems often include a [[time clock]] or web-based application used to track an employee's work hours. Time management systems give employers insights into their workforce, allowing them to see, plan and manage employees' time. Doing so allows employers to control labor costs and increase productivity. A time management system automates processes, which eliminates paper work and tedious tasks.\n\n===GTD (Getting Things Done)===\n[[Getting Things Done]] was created by [[David Allen (author)|David Allen]]. The basic idea behind this method is to finish all the small tasks immediately and a big task is to be divided into smaller tasks to start completing now. The reasoning behind this is to avoid the [[information overload]] or \"brain freeze\" which is likely to occur when there are hundreds of tasks. The thrust of GTD is to encourage the user to get their tasks and ideas out and on paper and organized as quickly as possible so they're easy to manage and see.\n\n===Pomodoro===\nFrancesco Cirillo's \"[[Pomodoro Technique]]\" was originally conceived in the late 1980s and gradually refined until it was later defined in 1992. The technique is the namesake of a pomodoro (Italian for tomato) shaped kitchen timer initially used by Cirillo during his time at university. The \"Pomodoro\" is described as the fundamental metric of time within the technique and is traditionally defined as being 30 minutes long, consisting of 25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of break time. Cirillo also recommends a longer break of 15 to 30 minutes after every four Pomodoros. Through experimentation involving various work groups and mentoring activities, Cirillo determined the \"ideal Pomodoro\" to be 20\u201335 minutes long.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cirillo|first1=Francesco|title=The Pomodoro Technique|date=November 14, 2009|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1445219943}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Action item]]\n* [[African time]]\n* [[Attention management]]\n* [[Calendaring software]]\n* [[Chronemics]]\n* [[Flow (psychology)]]\n* [[Gantt chart]]\n* [[Goal setting]]\n* [[Interruption science]]\n* [[Maestro concept]]\n* [[Opportunity cost]]\n* [[Order (virtue)|Order]]\n* [[Polychronicity]]\n* [[Precommitment]]\n* [[Procrastination]]\n* [[Professional organizing]]\n* [[Prospective memory]]\n* [[Punctuality]]\n* [[Self-help]]\n* [[Time and attendance]]\n* [[Time perception]]\n* [[Time to completion]]\n* [[Time value of money]]\n* [[Work activity management]]\n* [[Workforce management]]\n* [[Workforce modeling]]\n{{div col end}}\n<!-- please keep entries in alphabetical order -->\n\n'''Book''':\n* [[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People]]\n\n'''Systems''':\n* [[Getting Things Done]]\n* [[Pomodoro Technique]]\n\n'''Psychology/neuroscience'''\n* [[Habit]]\n* [[Self-control]]\n* [[Impulsivity]]\n* [[Inhibitory control]]\n\n'''Psychiatry'''\n* [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Library resources box}}\n* {{Cite book\n| publisher = Viking\n| isbn = 978-0-670-88906-8\n| last = Allen\n| first = David\n| title = Getting things done: the Art of Stress-Free Productivity\n| location = New York\n| year = 2001\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n| publisher = Penguin Group\n| isbn = 978-1-58542-552-5\n| last = Fiore\n| first = Neil A\n| title = The Now Habit: A Strategic Program for Overcoming Procrastination and Enjoying Guilt- Free Play\n| location = New York\n| year = 2006\n| url = https://archive.org/details/nowhabitstrategi00fior_0\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n| publisher = Cranendonck Coaching\n| isbn = 978-90-79397-03-7\n| last = Le Blanc\n| first = Raymond\n| title = Achieving Objectives Made Easy!
