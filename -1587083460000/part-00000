Geckos are well known to people who live in warm regions of the world, where several species make their home inside human habitations.

Unlike most lizards, geckos are usually nocturnal.\n\nThe largest species, the [[kawekaweau]], is only known from a single, stuffed specimen found in the basement of a museum in Marseille, France. This gecko was 60&nbsp;cm (24&nbsp;in) long and it was likely [[endemic]] to [[New Zealand]], where it lived in native forests. It was probably wiped out along with much of the native fauna of these islands in the late 19th century, when new [[invasive species]] such as [[rat]]s and [[stoat]]s were introduced to the country during European colonization.

Geckos are well known to people who live in warm regions of the world, where several species make their home inside human habitations. These (for example the [[hemidactylus|house gecko]]) become part of the indoor menagerie and are often welcomed, as they feed on insects, including moths and [[mosquito]]es. Unlike most lizards, geckos are usually nocturnal.\n\nThe largest species, the [[kawekaweau]], is only known from a single, stuffed specimen found in the basement of a museum in Marseille, France. This gecko was 60&nbsp;cm (24&nbsp;in) long and it was likely [[endemic]] to [[New Zealand]], where it lived in native forests. It was probably wiped out along with much of the native fauna of these islands in the late 19th century, when new [[invasive species]] such as [[rat]]s and [[stoat]]s were introduced to the country during European colonization. The smallest gecko, the [[Sphaerodactylus ariasae|Jaragua sphaero]], is a mere 1.6&nbsp;cm long and was discovered in 2001 on a small island off the coast of the Dominican Republic.<ref name=Piper>{{cite book |last=Piper |first=Ross |title=Extraordinary Animals: an Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals |url=https://archive.org/details/extraordinaryani0000pipe |url-access=registration |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn. |isbn=978-0313339226 |page=[https://archive.org/details/extraordinaryani0000pipe/page/143 143]}}</ref>\n\n==Common traits==\n[[File:Gecko in amber.jpg|thumb|[[Oligocene]]-era gecko trapped in [[amber]]]]\nLike other reptiles, geckos are [[ectotherm]]ic,<ref name=\"nzetc.victoria.ac.nz\">{{cite web|last=Girons|first= Hubert|title= Thermoregulation in Reptiles with Special Reference to the Tuatara and Its Ecophysiology Tuatara: Volume 24, Issue 2, August 1980.

In Cambodia, Ruiz met and befriended King [[Satha I|Satha]] of [[Lovek]] and Veloso of [[Portugal]]. When Lovek was invaded by [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]], Satha was overthrown by his son and other nobles who allowed Ayutthaya to take control, forcing Ruiz to flee to the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[colony]] of the [[Philippines]], the place where he began his adventure in [[Southeast Asia]]. Eventually Ruiz returned with Veloso, who had fled to the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colony of [[Melaka]], to Lovek. When they arrived they learned Satha had fled to [[Lan Xang]], an empire centered in modern-day Laos and consisting of [[Isan]], [[Stung Treng]], and small areas of [[Southern China]] and [[Vietnam]]. Ruiz and Veloso decided to journey to Laos and bring back Satha to restore his reign over Lovek.\n\nRuiz and Veloso arrived in [[Vientiane]], Lan Xang's administrative capital, in the summer of 1596. They were met with a procession showing off the city's immense wealth consisting of [[Asian Elephant]]s, [[gold]], [[Gemstone|jewel]]s, [[silk]], exotic [[snake]]s, bouquets of tropical flowers, chanting monks, [[Buddhist]] treasures and [[relic]]s, [[music of Laos|music]], and beautiful women. Ruiz and Veloso were also received with a great feast. But while they were in Vientiane they learned Satha had died from an illness he caught on his way from Cambodia to Laos. Saddened and angered by the news, Ruiz and Veloso returned to Lovek and started a rebellion to put one of Satha's political allies on the throne and free Cambodia from Ayatthaya. They managed to drive out Ayutthaya forces from parts of Cambodia and create a new state but led the new Cambodian state into a brief period of chaos. Eventually Ruiz returned to the [[Philippines]]. It is not known whether he died there, Spain, or somewhere else.\n\nIn July 1593 king Satha I sent an embassy to Manila asking for Spanish military help to defend Cambodia. The embassy consisted of Portuguese Diogo Veloso, who had been living in his court since 1583, and Spanish Gregorio de Vargas Machuca. Satha I kept Spanish Blas Ruiz de Hernan Gonzalez as captain of his bodyguard. Veloso came back in February 1594, alone and without help. After Ayutthaya's attack on Cambodia, Veloso, Blas Ruiz and de Vargas Machuca found themselves in Manila. They continued to ask for help, and at last, Spanish Manila agreed to send 3 ships with 120 Spanish and Mexican soldiers, some Japanese and Filipino auxiliaries and some friars, under the commander Suarez Gallinato. The ship with Blas Ruiz was the only one that reached Cambodia. The one with Veloso was wrecked off the Mekong delta and Gallinato's ship was forced to go to Malacca due to the weather. Veloso rejoined Blas Ruiz at Phnom Penh in March 1596. They were both killed at Phnom Penh in July 1599 during a fight between Christians (Spanish and Filipinos) and Muslim Malay mercenaries of Barom Reacha II, who was Satha's son. Satha had died in October 1597 after contracting disease after he fled to Lan Xang.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lovek]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Miguel de Jaque de los Rios Manzanedo ''Viaje de las Indias Orientales y Occidentales (A\u00f1o 1606)'' REF.: LVI-5\n*JOAQUIN MA\u00d1ES POSTIGO, ''LA QUIMERA DE UN REINO''.

The story follows [[Mario]]'s quest to save [[Princess Peach|Princess Toadstool]] and Dinosaur Land from the series antagonist [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] and his minions, the [[Koopalings]]. The [[gameplay]] is similar to that of earlier ''[[Super Mario]]'' games: Players control Mario or his brother [[Luigi]] through a series of [[Level (gaming)|levels]] in which the goal is to reach the [[flagpole]] at the end. ''Super Mario World'' introduced [[Yoshi]], a dinosaur who can eat enemies and gain abilities by eating the shells of [[Koopa Troopa]]s.\n\n[[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development]] developed the game, led by director [[Takashi Tezuka]] and producer and series creator [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]. It is the first ''Mario'' game for the SNES and was designed to make the most of the console's technical features. The development team had more freedom compared to the series installments for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES). Yoshi was conceptualised during the development of the NES games but was not used until ''Super Mario World'' due to [[Computer hardware|hardware]] limitations.\n\n''Super Mario World'' is often considered one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. It sold over 20 million copies worldwide, making it the [[best-selling SNES game]]. It also led to an [[Super Mario World (TV series)|animated television series of the same name]] and a prequel, ''[[Yoshi's Island]]'', released in August and October 1995. It has been rereleased on multiple occasions: It was part of the 1994 compilation ''[[Super Mario All-Stars + Super Mario World]]'' for the SNES and was rereleased for the [[Game Boy Advance]] as ''Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2'' in 2001, on the [[Virtual Console]] for the [[Wii]], [[Wii U]], and [[New Nintendo 3DS]] consoles, and as part of the [[Super NES Classic Edition]]. It was also released on the [[Nintendo Switch]] through [[Nintendo Switch Online]] using the Super Nintendo Entertainment System app. It is also a course style in ''[[Super Mario Maker]]'', and ''[[Super Mario Maker 2]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Supermarioworld.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mario]] riding [[Yoshi]] during the game's second [[Level (gaming)|level]].

The interface displayed around the corners shows the number of lives the player has, the Dragon Coins collected, the player's stored power-up, the level's remaining time, the player's number of coins, and the total score of the player.]]\n''Super Mario World'' is a [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game]] in which the player controls [[Mario]] or Luigi, the protagonists of the game. The game has similar [[gameplay]] to earlier games in the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series\u2014''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', and ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''\u2014but introduces new elements. As well as running and jumping, the player can also fly or float with the aid of certain power-ups and can execute the new spin jump move.<ref name=\"allgame\"/> The game has 96 [[Level (gaming)|levels]] in total.{{sfn|Dale|2014|p=101}}{{sfn|Harris|1991|p=18}}<ref name=\"SMW\">{{Cite video game |title=Super Mario World |developer=[[Nintendo EAD]] |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |date=21 November 1990 |platform=[[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] |language=English}}</ref><ref name=\"manual\">{{cite book |title=Super Mario World Instruction Booklet |url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/clvs/manuals/common/pdf/CLV-P-SAAAE.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615195341/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/clvs/manuals/common/pdf/CLV-P-SAAAE.pdf |publisher=[[Nintendo of America]] |date=31 August 1991 |archivedate=15 June 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe player navigates through the game via two game screens: an [[overworld]] map and a side-scrolling playfield. The overworld map displays an overhead representation of the current world and has several paths leading from the world's entrance to a castle. Paths connect to action panels, fortresses, ghost houses and other map icons, and allow players to take different routes to reach the world's goal. Moving the on-screen character to an action panel or fortress allows access to that level's playfield. The majority of the game takes place in these linear levels, populated with obstacles and enemies, which involves the player traversing the stage by running, jumping, and dodging or defeating enemies.<ref name=jeux/> The player is given a number of lives, which are lost if Mario comes into contact with an enemy, falls into a bottomless pit, gets crushed, or runs out of time.{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=11}} The game ends when the player runs out of lives, although the player can continue from the most recent save point (a successfully completed castle, fortress or haunted house) by selecting \"[[Glossary of video game terms#C|Continue]]\".{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=7}} Each world features a final stage with a [[Boss (gaming)|boss]] to defeat; each of the seven worlds features fortresses controlled by one of the [[Koopalings]],{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=19}} and the player also battles [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] in his castle in the seventh and final world.{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=20}} ''Super Mario World'' includes a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] option that allows two players to play the game by alternating turns at navigating the overworld map and accessing stage levels; the first player controls Mario, while the second controls his brother, [[Luigi]].{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=9}}<ref name=\"SMW\" /><ref name=\"manual\" />\n\nIn addition to the [[power-up]]s from previous games, such as the [[Super Mushroom]] and [[Fire Flower]], new power-ups that provide new gameplay options are also introduced. The new power-up in the game is the Cape Feather, which gives Mario a cape and the ability to fly, glide in the air, and use the cape as a sail.{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=15-16}} The game also introduces the ability to \"store\" an extra power-up in a box at the top centre of the screen. For example, if the player obtains a Fire Flower or a Cape Feather, then a Super Mushroom will appear in the box. If Mario gets hit by an enemy, the stored item in the box will automatically drop. Alternatively, the player can manually release the stored item at any time.{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=7}}<ref name=\"SMW\" /><ref name=\"manual\" />\n\nThe game introduces [[Yoshi]], a dinosaur companion Mario can ride who is able to eat most enemies.{{sfn|Nutter|2006|p=119}} If Yoshi attempts to eat a [[Koopa Troopa|Koopa]] or its shell, he can spit it and fire it at enemies. If the player fails to spit the shell out within a certain amount of time, Yoshi will swallow it, rendering it useless. When holding any Koopa shell in its mouth, Yoshi gains the ability that corresponds to its colour: a blue shell enables Yoshi to fly, a yellow shell causes Yoshi to emit dust clouds that kill nearby enemies, and a red shell allows Yoshi to produce three fireballs. Flashing Koopa shells produce all three abilities, while green shells produce none. The default Yoshi is green, but the game also has hidden blue, yellow, and red Yoshis; the player can obtain each coloured Yoshi by finding its egg in hidden areas and feeding it five enemies, causing the baby Yoshi to mature.{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=18}}<ref name=\"SMW\" /><ref name=\"manual\" />\n\nAlthough the main objective is to navigate through seven worlds to reach the end of the game, the player can beat the game much faster by using secret Star Road routes. To access a hidden world, the player needs to find key scattered throughout the game's levels.<ref name=usgamer/> When a key is found, it must be brought to a keyhole to unlock either a new level or a Star Road.{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=21}} Exploring these secret stages can lead to other stages, such as Special World. Completion of Special World permanently changes some of the enemies' [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] and alters the overworld map's colour scheme.{{sfn|Dale|2014|p=101}}<ref name=\"SMW\" /><ref name=\"manual\" />\n\n==Plot==\nAfter saving the [[Mushroom Kingdom]] in ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', brothers [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]] decide to go on vacation to a place called Dinosaur Land, a prehistoric-themed world swarming with dinosaurs and other enemies. While resting on the beach, [[Princess Peach|Princess Toadstool]] is captured by Bowser. When Mario and Luigi wake up, they try to find her and, after hours of searching, come across a giant egg in the forest. It suddenly hatches and out of it comes a young dinosaur like creature named Yoshi, who tells them that his yoshi friends have also been imprisoned in eggs by evil Koopalings. Mario and Luigi soon realise that it must be the evil [[Bowser (character)|King Bowser Koopa]] and his [[Koopalings]]. Mario, Luigi and Yoshi set out to save Toadstool and Yoshi's dinosaur friends, traversing through Dinosaur Land for Bowser and his Koopalings. To aid him, Yoshi gives Mario a cape as they begin their journey. Mario and Luigi continue to follow Bowser, defeating the Koopalings in the process, and save Yoshi's dinosaur friends. They eventually arrive at Bowser's castle, where they fight him in a final battle. They send Bowser flying into the sky and save Toadstool, restoring peace to Dinosaur Land.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Takashi Tezuka, Shigeru Miyamoto and K\u014dji Kond\u014d (cropped 3).jpg|thumb|right|250px|''From left'': Director [[Takashi Tezuka]], producer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], and composer [[Koji Kondo]], pictured in 2015|alt=An image of the three integral staff who worked on the game.

[[Shigefumi Hino]] took the role of graphics designer. [[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development|Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development]] handled development with a team of ten people including three main programmers and a character designer, most of whom had worked on ''[[Super Mario Bros.|Super Mario Bros]]''. In a retrospective interview, the core team said that Miyamoto wielded the most authority during development.{{sfn|Kawasaki|1991|p=28}}\n\n''Super Mario World'' was the first ''Mario'' game series developed for the then-upcoming [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES). As such, the team anticipated some difficulty in working with new and more advanced hardware. According to Tezuka, the software tools were not yet fully developed, and the team had to \"go along with starting something new\".{{sfn|Kawasaki|1991|p=29}} Miyamoto acknowledged the team no longer had restrictions on certain [[game mechanics|mechanics]] such as scrolling and the number of colours they could implement. As a hardware experiment, the team ported ''Super Mario 3'' to the SNES and it felt like the same game to them, despite the improved colours and sprites. After that, Miyamoto realised the team's goal would be to use the new hardware to create something \"totally new\".{{sfn|Kawasaki|1991|p=29-30}}\n\nMiyamoto said he had wanted Mario to have a dinosaur companion ever since ''Super Mario Bros.'', but Nintendo engineers could not add such a character into the game due to the limitations of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES).<ref name=\"history\"/>{{sfn|Kawasaki|1991|p=31}} The inspiration for Yoshi can be traced back even further; Miyamoto designed a green dragon for the 1984 game ''[[Devil World]]'' which shared many similarities with Yoshi.{{sfn|Nutter|2006|p=118}} During the development of ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', Miyamoto had a number of sketches around his desk, including an image of Mario riding a horse.{{sfn|''Nintendo Power'' staff|1991|p=32}} As development of ''Super Mario World'' progressed, the team opted to set the game in a \"dinosaur land\", so Tezuka asked designer Shigefumi Hino to draw a reptile-like creature based on Miyamoto's sketches.<ref name=\"yoshi\">{{cite web |last1=Corrigan |first1=Hope |title=Super Mario World: Mario Was Originally Punching Yoshi in The Head |url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2017/09/28/super-mario-world-mario-was-originally-punching-yoshi-in-the-head |website=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |accessdate=12 October 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930194553/http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/28/super-mario-world-mario-was-originally-punching-yoshi-in-the-head |archivedate=30 September 2017 |date=28 September 2017}}</ref> Hino originally produced a design that Tezuka deemed too reptilian, and \"didn't really fit into the Mario world\", so he encouraged the designer to create a \"cuter\" character.<ref name=yoshi/> Tezuka speculated that Miyamoto's love of horse riding, as well as [[Country music|country and western]] themes, influenced Yoshi's creation.{{sfn|East|2012|p=52}}\n\nReflecting on how he had created different melodies for ''Super Mario Bros 3.'', composer [[Koji Kondo]] decided to reuse the same themes for ''Super Mario World'', albeit in a [[Arrangement|rearranged]] form. By doing this, he assumed that players would be able to recognise the same melodies, while exposing them to new variations of music as they progressed through the game. As ''Super Mario World'' was the first game developed for the SNES, Kondo felt \"overjoyed\" at being able to compose music by using eight sounds at once.

The [[gameplay]] is similar to that of earlier ''[[Super Mario]]'' games: Players control Mario or his brother [[Luigi]] through a series of [[Level (gaming)|levels]] in which the goal is to reach the [[flagpole]] at the end. ''Super Mario World'' introduced [[Yoshi]], a dinosaur who can eat enemies and gain abilities by eating the shells of [[Koopa Troopa]]s.\n\n[[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development]] developed the game, led by director [[Takashi Tezuka]] and producer and series creator [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]. It is the first ''Mario'' game for the SNES and was designed to make the most of the console's technical features. The development team had more freedom compared to the series installments for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES). Yoshi was conceptualised during the development of the NES games but was not used until ''Super Mario World'' due to [[Computer hardware|hardware]] limitations.\n\n''Super Mario World'' is often considered one of the [[greatest video games of all time]]. It sold over 20 million copies worldwide, making it the [[best-selling SNES game]]. It also led to an [[Super Mario World (TV series)|animated television series of the same name]] and a prequel, ''[[Yoshi's Island]]'', released in August and October 1995. It has been rereleased on multiple occasions: It was part of the 1994 compilation ''[[Super Mario All-Stars + Super Mario World]]'' for the SNES and was rereleased for the [[Game Boy Advance]] as ''Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2'' in 2001, on the [[Virtual Console]] for the [[Wii]], [[Wii U]], and [[New Nintendo 3DS]] consoles, and as part of the [[Super NES Classic Edition]]. It was also released on the [[Nintendo Switch]] through [[Nintendo Switch Online]] using the Super Nintendo Entertainment System app. It is also a course style in ''[[Super Mario Maker]]'', and ''[[Super Mario Maker 2]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Supermarioworld.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mario]] riding [[Yoshi]] during the game's second [[Level (gaming)|level]].

The game has similar [[gameplay]] to earlier games in the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series\u2014''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'', and ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''\u2014but introduces new elements. As well as running and jumping, the player can also fly or float with the aid of certain power-ups and can execute the new spin jump move.<ref name=\"allgame\"/> The game has 96 [[Level (gaming)|levels]] in total.{{sfn|Dale|2014|p=101}}{{sfn|Harris|1991|p=18}}<ref name=\"SMW\">{{Cite video game |title=Super Mario World |developer=[[Nintendo EAD]] |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |date=21 November 1990 |platform=[[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] |language=English}}</ref><ref name=\"manual\">{{cite book |title=Super Mario World Instruction Booklet |url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/clvs/manuals/common/pdf/CLV-P-SAAAE.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615195341/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/clvs/manuals/common/pdf/CLV-P-SAAAE.pdf |publisher=[[Nintendo of America]] |date=31 August 1991 |archivedate=15 June 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe player navigates through the game via two game screens: an [[overworld]] map and a side-scrolling playfield. The overworld map displays an overhead representation of the current world and has several paths leading from the world's entrance to a castle. Paths connect to action panels, fortresses, ghost houses and other map icons, and allow players to take different routes to reach the world's goal. Moving the on-screen character to an action panel or fortress allows access to that level's playfield. The majority of the game takes place in these linear levels, populated with obstacles and enemies, which involves the player traversing the stage by running, jumping, and dodging or defeating enemies.<ref name=jeux/> The player is given a number of lives, which are lost if Mario comes into contact with an enemy, falls into a bottomless pit, gets crushed, or runs out of time.{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=11}} The game ends when the player runs out of lives, although the player can continue from the most recent save point (a successfully completed castle, fortress or haunted house) by selecting \"[[Glossary of video game terms#C|Continue]]\".{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=7}} Each world features a final stage with a [[Boss (gaming)|boss]] to defeat; each of the seven worlds features fortresses controlled by one of the [[Koopalings]],{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=19}} and the player also battles [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] in his castle in the seventh and final world.{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=20}} ''Super Mario World'' includes a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] option that allows two players to play the game by alternating turns at navigating the overworld map and accessing stage levels; the first player controls Mario, while the second controls his brother, [[Luigi]].{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=9}}<ref name=\"SMW\" /><ref name=\"manual\" />\n\nIn addition to the [[power-up]]s from previous games, such as the [[Super Mushroom]] and [[Fire Flower]], new power-ups that provide new gameplay options are also introduced. The new power-up in the game is the Cape Feather, which gives Mario a cape and the ability to fly, glide in the air, and use the cape as a sail.{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=15-16}} The game also introduces the ability to \"store\" an extra power-up in a box at the top centre of the screen. For example, if the player obtains a Fire Flower or a Cape Feather, then a Super Mushroom will appear in the box. If Mario gets hit by an enemy, the stored item in the box will automatically drop. Alternatively, the player can manually release the stored item at any time.{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=7}}<ref name=\"SMW\" /><ref name=\"manual\" />\n\nThe game introduces [[Yoshi]], a dinosaur companion Mario can ride who is able to eat most enemies.{{sfn|Nutter|2006|p=119}} If Yoshi attempts to eat a [[Koopa Troopa|Koopa]] or its shell, he can spit it and fire it at enemies. If the player fails to spit the shell out within a certain amount of time, Yoshi will swallow it, rendering it useless. When holding any Koopa shell in its mouth, Yoshi gains the ability that corresponds to its colour: a blue shell enables Yoshi to fly, a yellow shell causes Yoshi to emit dust clouds that kill nearby enemies, and a red shell allows Yoshi to produce three fireballs. Flashing Koopa shells produce all three abilities, while green shells produce none. The default Yoshi is green, but the game also has hidden blue, yellow, and red Yoshis; the player can obtain each coloured Yoshi by finding its egg in hidden areas and feeding it five enemies, causing the baby Yoshi to mature.{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=18}}<ref name=\"SMW\" /><ref name=\"manual\" />\n\nAlthough the main objective is to navigate through seven worlds to reach the end of the game, the player can beat the game much faster by using secret Star Road routes. To access a hidden world, the player needs to find key scattered throughout the game's levels.<ref name=usgamer/> When a key is found, it must be brought to a keyhole to unlock either a new level or a Star Road.{{sfn|Nintendo|1991|p=21}} Exploring these secret stages can lead to other stages, such as Special World. Completion of Special World permanently changes some of the enemies' [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] and alters the overworld map's colour scheme.{{sfn|Dale|2014|p=101}}<ref name=\"SMW\" /><ref name=\"manual\" />\n\n==Plot==\nAfter saving the [[Mushroom Kingdom]] in ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', brothers [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]] decide to go on vacation to a place called Dinosaur Land, a prehistoric-themed world swarming with dinosaurs and other enemies. While resting on the beach, [[Princess Peach|Princess Toadstool]] is captured by Bowser. When Mario and Luigi wake up, they try to find her and, after hours of searching, come across a giant egg in the forest. It suddenly hatches and out of it comes a young dinosaur named Yoshi, who tells them that his dinosaur friends have also been imprisoned in eggs by evil Koopalings. Mario and Luigi soon realise that it must be the evil [[Bowser (character)|King Bowser Koopa]] and his [[Koopalings]]. Mario, Luigi and Yoshi set out to save Toadstool and Yoshi's dinosaur friends, traversing through Dinosaur Land for Bowser and his Koopalings. To aid him, Yoshi gives Mario a cape as they begin their journey. Mario and Luigi continue to follow Bowser, defeating the Koopalings in the process, and save Yoshi's dinosaur friends. They eventually arrive at Bowser's castle, where they fight him in a final battle. They send Bowser flying into the sky and save Toadstool, restoring peace to Dinosaur Land.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Takashi Tezuka, Shigeru Miyamoto and K\u014dji Kond\u014d (cropped 3).jpg|thumb|right|250px|''From left'': Director [[Takashi Tezuka]], producer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], and composer [[Koji Kondo]], pictured in 2015|alt=An image of the three integral staff who worked on the game. From left to right is director Takashi Tezuka, producer Shigeru Miyamoto, and composer [[Koji Kondo]].]]\nThe game was directed by [[Takashi Tezuka]], while [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], the creator of both ''Super Mario'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', served as producer. [[Shigefumi Hino]] took the role of graphics designer. [[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development|Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development]] handled development with a team of ten people including three main programmers and a character designer, most of whom had worked on ''[[Super Mario Bros.|Super Mario Bros]]''. In a retrospective interview, the core team said that Miyamoto wielded the most authority during development.{{sfn|Kawasaki|1991|p=28}}\n\n''Super Mario World'' was the first ''Mario'' game series developed for the then-upcoming [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES). As such, the team anticipated some difficulty in working with new and more advanced hardware. According to Tezuka, the software tools were not yet fully developed, and the team had to \"go along with starting something new\".{{sfn|Kawasaki|1991|p=29}} Miyamoto acknowledged the team no longer had restrictions on certain [[game mechanics|mechanics]] such as scrolling and the number of colours they could implement. As a hardware experiment, the team ported ''Super Mario 3'' to the SNES and it felt like the same game to them, despite the improved colours and sprites. After that, Miyamoto realised the team's goal would be to use the new hardware to create something \"totally new\".{{sfn|Kawasaki|1991|p=29-30}}\n\nMiyamoto said he had wanted Mario to have a dinosaur companion ever since ''Super Mario Bros.'', but Nintendo engineers could not add such a character into the game due to the limitations of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES).<ref name=\"history\"/>{{sfn|Kawasaki|1991|p=31}} The inspiration for Yoshi can be traced back even further; Miyamoto designed a green dragon for the 1984 game ''[[Devil World]]'' which shared many similarities with Yoshi.{{sfn|Nutter|2006|p=118}} During the development of ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', Miyamoto had a number of sketches around his desk, including an image of Mario riding a horse.{{sfn|''Nintendo Power'' staff|1991|p=32}} As development of ''Super Mario World'' progressed, the team opted to set the game in a \"dinosaur land\", so Tezuka asked designer Shigefumi Hino to draw a reptile-like creature based on Miyamoto's sketches.<ref name=\"yoshi\">{{cite web |last1=Corrigan |first1=Hope |title=Super Mario World: Mario Was Originally Punching Yoshi in The Head |url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2017/09/28/super-mario-world-mario-was-originally-punching-yoshi-in-the-head |website=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |accessdate=12 October 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930194553/http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/28/super-mario-world-mario-was-originally-punching-yoshi-in-the-head |archivedate=30 September 2017 |date=28 September 2017}}</ref> Hino originally produced a design that Tezuka deemed too reptilian, and \"didn't really fit into the Mario world\", so he encouraged the designer to create a \"cuter\" character.<ref name=yoshi/> Tezuka speculated that Miyamoto's love of horse riding, as well as [[Country music|country and western]] themes, influenced Yoshi's creation.{{sfn|East|2012|p=52}}\n\nReflecting on how he had created different melodies for ''Super Mario Bros 3.'', composer [[Koji Kondo]] decided to reuse the same themes for ''Super Mario World'', albeit in a [[Arrangement|rearranged]] form. By doing this, he assumed that players would be able to recognise the same melodies, while exposing them to new variations of music as they progressed through the game. As ''Super Mario World'' was the first game developed for the SNES, Kondo felt \"overjoyed\" at being able to compose music by using eight sounds at once. To express the technological novelty of the new console, he used several different instruments, often implementing them all one after the other in the game's title song.<ref name=\"kondo5\">{{cite web |title=Iwata Asks: Music Commentary by Koji Kondo (2) |url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Super-Mario-All-Stars/Vol-1-Super-Mario-History-Soundtrack-CD/5-Music-Commentary-by-Koji-Kondo-2-/5-Music-Commentary-by-Koji-Kondo-2--220040.html |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |accessdate=12 October 2017 |page=5}}</ref> As development progressed, Kondo grew concerned over how people would react to his unusual combinations of instruments as he noted the use of more traditional [[square wave]]s and [[triangle wave]]s had \"gained acceptance\" with consumers. For the game's sound effects, Kondo decided to use a variety of musical instruments as opposed to square waves to emphasise the game used traditional technology with a hybrid of new materials.<ref name=kondo5/> It took Kondo around a year and a half to write all the music for the game.{{sfn|Kawasaki|1991|p=36}}\n\n''Super Mario World'' was produced during the [[Glossary of video game terms#C|console wars]]\u2014a result of the rivalry between Nintendo's SNES and [[Sega]]'s two-year-old [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]] system\u2014which led to fierce competition between the two companies.<ref name=history/>{{sfn|Kent|2001|p=431}} Sega's mascot, [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], was seen by many as a faster and \"cooler\" alternative to Mario.

He showed that contact of supersaturated solutions with crystals of an [[Isomorphism (crystallography)|isomorphous]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] causes the substance to precipitate from solution. He further showed that many [[anhydrous]] salts can be dissolved to create a supersaturated solution. These investigations were carried out from 1866 to 1869. \n\nIn 1874 Lecoq de Boisbaudran found that certain crystal faces dissolve more rapidly than other crystal faces. Specifically, he found that [[octahedral]] faces are less readily soluble than cubic faces in the case of [[ammonium alum]] crystals.<ref name=\"Ramsay\"/>\n\nLecoq de Boisbaudran made major contributions to the then-new science of spectroscopy, which relates to the interaction of light and matter.

In this way, he obtained [[phosphorescent]] bands in the spectra providing further insight into the spectral characteristics of various chemical elements. Using this apparatus, he discovered the [[lanthanide]]s [[samarium]] (1880), [[dysprosium]] (1886) and [[europium]] (1890).

Beginning in 1874, Lecoq de Boisbaudran investigated a sample of 52&nbsp;kg of the mineral ore [[sphalerite]] obtained from the Pierrefitte mine in the [[Pyrenees]]. From it, he extracted several milligrams of gallium chloride. Using spectroscopic methods, he observed what appeared to be two previously unreported lines in the sample's spectrum, at wavelengths of 4170 and 4031 [[angstroms]].<ref name=\"Ramsay\"/><ref name=\"Weeks\"/>\n\n[[File:Spectre electrique du Chlorure de Gallium.jpeg|thumb|right|Spectre electrique du Chlorure de Gallium, 1877]]\nHe continued his experiments using several hundred kilograms of a crude zinc ore from and in the same year isolated more than one gram of a near-pure metal by electrolysis of a solution of the metal in its form as a hydroxide compound, dissolved in [[potassium hydroxide]] solution. Later he prepared 75&nbsp;grams of gallium using more than 4 tonnes of the crude ore. He confirmed its spectral characteristics, consisting of two spectral lines in the [[violet (color)|violet]] portion of the spectrum of the mineral sphalerite. In this way, he ruled out the possibility that the spectral characteristics were an accident of the extraction process, rather than being an indication of a new element.<ref name=\"Bois\">{{cite journal |title= Caract\u00e8res chimiques et spectroscopiques d'un nouveau m\u00e9tal, le gallium, d\u00e9couvert dans une blende de la mine de Pierrefitte, vall\u00e9e d'Argel\u00e8s (Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es) |first=Paul \u00c9mile  |last= Lecoq de Boisbaudran |pages=493\u2013495 |journal= Comptes Rendus Hebdomadaires des S\u00e9ances de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences |volume= 81 |url= |date= 1875 }}</ref><ref name=\"Weeks\"/>\n\nHe named his discovery \"gallia\", from the [[Latin]] ''Gallia'' meaning [[Gaul]], in honor of his native land of France.

As such, de Boisbaudran is an example of an [[autodidact]]. With the support of his family, he assembled a modest [[chemical laboratory]] on the second floor of their home on the Rue de Lusignan.

He showed that contact of supersaturated solutions with crystals of an [[Isomorphism (crystallography)|isomorphous]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] causes the substance to precipitate from solution. He further showed that many [[anhydrous]] salts can be dissolved to create a supersaturated solution. These investigations were carried out from 1866 to 1869. \n\nIn 1874 Lecoq de Boisbaudran found that certain crystal faces dissolve more rapidly than other crystal faces. Specifically, he found that [[octahedral]] faces are less readily soluble than cubic faces in the case of [[ammonium alum]] crystals.<ref name=\"Ramsay\"/>\n\nLecoq de Boisbaudran made major contributions to the then-new science of spectroscopy, which relates to the interaction of light and matter.

In this way, he obtained [[phosphorescent]] bands in the spectra providing further insight into the spectral characteristics of various chemical elements.

From it, he extracted several milligrams of gallium chloride. Using spectroscopic methods, he observed what appeared to be two previously unreported lines in the sample's spectrum, at wavelengths of 4170 and 4031 [[angstroms]].<ref name=\"Ramsay\"/><ref name=\"Weeks\"/>\n\n[[File:Spectre electrique du Chlorure de Gallium.jpeg|thumb|right|Spectre electrique du Chlorure de Gallium, 1877]]\nHe continued his experiments using several hundred kilograms of a crude zinc ore from and in the same year isolated more than one gram of a near-pure metal by electrolysis of a solution of the metal in its form as a hydroxide compound, dissolved in [[potassium hydroxide]] solution. Later he prepared 75&nbsp;grams of gallium using more than 4 tonnes of the crude ore. He confirmed its spectral characteristics, consisting of two spectral lines in the [[violet (color)|violet]] portion of the spectrum of the mineral sphalerite. In this way, he ruled out the possibility that the spectral characteristics were an accident of the extraction process, rather than being an indication of a new element.<ref name=\"Bois\">{{cite journal |title= Caract\u00e8res chimiques et spectroscopiques d'un nouveau m\u00e9tal, le gallium, d\u00e9couvert dans une blende de la mine de Pierrefitte, vall\u00e9e d'Argel\u00e8s (Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es) |first=Paul \u00c9mile  |last= Lecoq de Boisbaudran |pages=493\u2013495 |journal= Comptes Rendus Hebdomadaires des S\u00e9ances de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences |volume= 81 |url= |date= 1875 }}</ref><ref name=\"Weeks\"/>\n\nHe named his discovery \"gallia\", from the [[Latin]] ''Gallia'' meaning [[Gaul]], in honor of his native land of France.
