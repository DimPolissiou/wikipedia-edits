Twelve world champions are crowned every year.\n\nThe first predecessor of the youth championship was the Cadet Championship. It started off unofficially in 1974 in France for players under 18. The 1975 and 1976 editions were also for U18. The 1976 featured very young players such as [[Garry Kasparov]] and [[Julian Hodgson]] (12+) but also players slightly older than 18, but younger than 19 such as [[Louis Roos]]. It was recognized in 1977 by FIDE as the World Championship for [[Cadet]]s for players under 17. In 1981 the age limit was reduced to under 16, applicable at the start of the year the championship is played in. It was also the year in which the first girls' championship for U16 was played.\n\nIn 1979, [[International Year of the Child]], the first edition of the World Infant Cup was played for under 14. This cup had four editions, 1979, 1980, 1981 and 1984. In 1985 the U14 event was included in the first edition of the World Youth Chess Festival for Peace. Subsequently, the age categories U10, U12 and U18 were introduced. In 1987 the festival included the sections U10, U12, U14 and U18, while the U16 was held separately. In 1988, U16 was incorporated, but U18 was held separately. It was not until 1989 that the festival included all five age categories. Later, the U16 and U18 were sometimes played at separately from the U10, U12 and U14, as was the case in 1990, 1991, 1995 and 1997. In 1997 the name of tournament was changed to the World Youth Chess Championships. The under 8 category was first introduced in 2006.\n\nSince 2015, the event has been split into \"World Cadets Chess Championship\" (categories U8, U10 and U12) and \"World Youth Chess Championship\" (categories U14, U16 and U18). In 2015 both events were held in the same venue under the name of \"World Youth and Cadets Chess Championships\".\n\n==Under-18 winners==\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! Year !! Location !!

A total of fifty-one 'cadets' represented forty-nine different countries. France fielded three players, two by right and a third when immigration officials mysteriously refused entry to the Pakistan entrant. The winner, [[Valery Salov]], displayed the usual Soviet formula of good preparation and technique, with strategically planned draws against his nearest rivals, Alon Greenfeld and Joel Benjamin. Greenfeld might have tied first, but lost his crucial last round game with Benjamin, despite having the white pieces. Some of the players and their seconds were unhappy about the conditions, particularly the dormitory-style accommodation and food quality. Many also felt that the Brazilian, Gilberto Milos, was unfairly treated when his twice adjourned game was concluded on the free day without prior warning. He was awoken at 9.10&nbsp;am and told that his clock had been started. Understandably upset, he played and lost, his follow-up protest falling on deaf ears.

Living conditions were quite stretched as the organisers were not expecting the players to be accompanied by more than 200 adults. Regrettably, there was a shortage of competent decision-making organisers, but a friendly, good humoured atmosphere prevailed and the problems were resolved amicably. A variety of tie-breaking systems were used to separate the final places. In the case of the Boys Under-10 category, the resulting split was particularly harsh on the Brazilian Rafael Leit\u00e3o, who was deprived of a gold medal on the basis of 'strength of first round opponent'. Antoaneta Stefanova, the winner of the girls Under-10 event, was already being talked about as a future women's world champion. IM Bob Wade attended the event and felt that the most successful countries were those that prepared their competitors best in terms of 'basic' rather than 'opening' training. Among the lesser medals were; Alex Sherzer (silver, U-18), Christopher Lutz (bronze, U-18), Matthew Sadler (silver, U-16), Vladimir Kramnik (silver, U-14), Peter Leko (bronze, U-10).

With federation officials and parental entourages, this number swelled to more than 300. It was the first time that the USA had hosted a chess event of this size and importance and the accommodation and conditions received high praise from the competitors. Judit Polg\u00e1r celebrated victory on her fourteenth birthday (23 July), by taking the gold medal in the Boys U-14 event. This was the second occasion on which she had successfully competed in the Boys category. Her father, Laszlo Polgar, pointed out that Judit's last three 'world' competitions, including the Thessaloniki Olympiad, had resulted in a score of +26 =9 -0. Vasily Emelin of the USSR and Gabriel Schwartzman of Romania finished in silver and bronze medal places. Russia's Diana Darchia won the corresponding Girls' U-14 event from the USSR's Inna Gaponenko and Hungarian Monika Grabics. In the Boys U-12, Boris Avrukh outdistanced second placed John Viloria and third placed Peter Leko. Corina Peptan was triumphant in the Girls U-12, ahead of Monika Bobrowska and Nikoletta Lakos.

There were initially some problems with overcrowding, but these were quickly sorted out by the organisers. There was a commentary room where those who had finished their games could benefit from the expert opinion of Grandmaster Helmut Pfleger. TV screens were displayed throughout the venue to cover the positions on the top boards. Peter Leko of Hungary, the world's youngest IM at the time, played in the U-14 event and was expected to win with an enormous [[Elo rating]] advantage over his closest rival.. However, his opponents had not read the script and he finished a disappointing fourth. There was a shock too in the Girls' U-14 section, when the Romanian Corina Peptan, top seed and national champion at 14, only managed to secure the silver medal. In contrast, the U-18 events went according to expectation with Sakaev (in the Boys/Open) and Kadimova (in the Girls) totally dominant. There was a good showing from the English contingent; by comparison other western European nations failed miserably. McShane won the Boys/Open U-10 event, despite being the youngest competitor at 8.

Unfortunately the tournament got off to a bad start, before even a game had been played. The organisers had implemented an arduous registration process, designed to catch late registrants and penalise them or their federation with a $100 U.S. late entry fee. It appeared to be a cynical attempt at earning the organising committee a tidy sum. There were a number of protests; some paid up and others refused. Before things turned too nasty, Florencio Campomanes stepped in and ordered a reduction in the fee, which helped patch things up. However, the French were so upset that they decided to boycott the opening celebrations. Attending the closing ceremony was former World Champion Anatoly Karpov, the guest of honour replacing Campomanes on his departure. The contest contained a few surprises; Malakhov edged out Peter Leko in the Boys U-14 and a similar fate awaited the rapidly improving Vallejo Pons in the Boys U-12.

Bearing in mind his past disappointments, it is worth noting that other high-profile players missed gold medals at this event, including 2 future World Champions. In retrospect, this underlines the strength of the event. Among those taking home silver medals, were Alexandra Kosteniuk (U-10 Girls), \u00c9tienne Bacrot (U-12 Boys) and Rustam Kasimdzhanov (U-16 Boys).

Twelve world champions are crowned every year.\n\nThe first predecessor of the youth championship was the Cadet Championship. It started off unofficially in 1974 in France for players under 18. The 1975 and 1976 editions were also for U18. The 1976 featured very young players such as [[Garry Kasparov]] and [[Julian Hodgson]] (12+) but also players slightly older than 18, but younger than 19 such as [[Louis Roos]]. It was recognized in 1977 by FIDE as the World Championship for [[Cadet]]s for players under 17. In 1981 the age limit was reduced to under 16, applicable at the start of the year the championship is played in. It was also the year in which the first girls' championship for U16 was played.\n\nIn 1979, [[International Year of the Child]], the first edition of the World Infant Cup was played for under 14. This cup had four editions, 1979, 1980, 1981 and 1984. In 1985 the U14 event was included in the first edition of the World Youth Chess Festival for Peace. Subsequently, the age categories U10, U12 and U18 were introduced. In 1987 the festival included the sections U10, U12, U14 and U18, while the U16 was held separately. In 1988, U16 was incorporated, but U18 was held separately. It was not until 1989 that the festival included all five age categories. Later, the U16 and U18 were sometimes played at separately from the U10, U12 and U14, as was the case in 1990, 1991, 1995 and 1997. In 1997 the name of tournament was changed to the World Youth Chess Championships. The under 8 category was first introduced in 2006.\n\nSince 2015, the event has been split into \"World Cadets Chess Championship\" (categories U8, U10 and U12) and \"World Youth Chess Championship\" (categories U14, U16 and U18). In 2015 both events were held in the same venue under the name of \"World Youth and Cadets Chess Championships\".\n\n==Under-18 winners==\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! Year !! Location !!

Third place was taken by Ivan Morovic and further down the field were future grandmasters [[Gilberto Milos]], [[Joel Benjamin]], [[Jan Ehlvest]], [[Alon Greenfeld]] and J\u00f3hann Hjartarson.\n\n:Boys U-17 \u2013 1.

October p. 368\n\n'''1980 \u2013 Le Havre''', France \u2013 (? \u2013 ?) \u2013 The World Cadet Championship (for players under 17 on 1 September 1980) was played alongside the familiar Le Havre Open chess tournament. A total of fifty-one 'cadets' represented forty-nine different countries. France fielded three players, two by right and a third when immigration officials mysteriously refused entry to the Pakistan entrant. The winner, [[Valery Salov]], displayed the usual Soviet formula of good preparation and technique, with strategically planned draws against his nearest rivals, Alon Greenfeld and Joel Benjamin. Greenfeld might have tied first, but lost his crucial last round game with Benjamin, despite having the white pieces. Some of the players and their seconds were unhappy about the conditions, particularly the dormitory-style accommodation and food quality. Many also felt that the Brazilian, Gilberto Milos, was unfairly treated when his twice adjourned game was concluded on the free day without prior warning. He was awoken at 9.10&nbsp;am and told that his clock had been started. Understandably upset, he played and lost, his follow-up protest falling on deaf ears. The list of entries also contained future grandmasters [[Suat Atal\u0131k]] and [[Dibyendu Barua]], among others. Final result;\n \n:Boys U-17 \u2013 1. ''Valery Salov'' (USSR) 2.

Aug\u2013Sept p. 237\n\n'''1989 \u2013 Aguadilla''', Puerto Rico \u2013 (28 July \u2013 9 August) \u2013 There were 54 countries and 281 juniors participating. Living conditions were quite stretched as the organisers were not expecting the players to be accompanied by more than 200 adults. Regrettably, there was a shortage of competent decision-making organisers, but a friendly, good humoured atmosphere prevailed and the problems were resolved amicably. A variety of tie-breaking systems were used to separate the final places. In the case of the Boys Under-10 category, the resulting split was particularly harsh on the Brazilian Rafael Leit\u00e3o, who was deprived of a gold medal on the basis of 'strength of first round opponent'. Antoaneta Stefanova, the winner of the girls Under-10 event, was already being talked about as a future women's world champion. IM Bob Wade attended the event and felt that the most successful countries were those that prepared their competitors best in terms of 'basic' rather than 'opening' training. Among the lesser medals were; Alex Sherzer (silver, U-18), Christopher Lutz (bronze, U-18), Matthew Sadler (silver, U-16), Vladimir Kramnik (silver, U-14), Peter Leko (bronze, U-10). In the girls events, Tea Lanchava took silver in the U-16 and Corina Peptan, bronze in the U-12. The gold medals went to;\n\n:Boys U-10 \u2013 ''Irwin Irnandi'' (INA); Boys U-12 \u2013 ''Marcin Kaminsky'' (POL); Boys U-14 \u2013 ''Veselin Topalov'' (BUL); Boys U-16 \u2013 ''Sergei Tiviakov'' (USSR); Boys U-18 \u2013 ''Vladimir Akopian'' (USSR).\n\n:Girls U-10 \u2013 ''Antoaneta Stefanova'' (BUL); Girls U-12 \u2013 ''Diana Darchia'' (USSR); Girls U-14 \u2013 ''[[Anna Gershnik|Anna Segal]]'' (USSR); Girls U-16 \u2013 ''Krystina Dabrowska'' (POL); Girls U-18 \u2013 ''Katrin Aladyova'' (BUL).\n\n: --- [[CHESS magazine]] Vol 54.

With federation officials and parental entourages, this number swelled to more than 300. It was the first time that the USA had hosted a chess event of this size and importance and the accommodation and conditions received high praise from the competitors. Judit Polg\u00e1r celebrated victory on her fourteenth birthday (23 July), by taking the gold medal in the Boys U-14 event. This was the second occasion on which she had successfully competed in the Boys category. Her father, Laszlo Polgar, pointed out that Judit's last three 'world' competitions, including the Thessaloniki Olympiad, had resulted in a score of +26 =9 -0. Vasily Emelin of the USSR and Gabriel Schwartzman of Romania finished in silver and bronze medal places. Russia's Diana Darchia won the corresponding Girls' U-14 event from the USSR's Inna Gaponenko and Hungarian Monika Grabics. In the Boys U-12, Boris Avrukh outdistanced second placed John Viloria and third placed Peter Leko. Corina Peptan was triumphant in the Girls U-12, ahead of Monika Bobrowska and Nikoletta Lakos. In the Boys U-10, Nawrose Nur won by a good margin from the Romanian Alin Berescu and Adrien Leroy of France. Ecuador's Evelyn Moncayo took gold in the Girls U-10, while Claudia Bilciu of Romania and Jovanka Houska of England took silver and bronze, respectively. ''New In Chess'' Best Game awards were chaired by [[Arnold Denker]] and won by Judit Polg\u00e1r, Yvonne Krawiec, [[Tal Shaked]], Corina Peptan, [[Francisco Vallejo Pons]] and Claudia Bilciu. Polgar made it a clean sweep by winning an Under-14 Blitz tournament from Vasily Emelin and Ronan Har-Zvi of Israel.\n\n:Boys U-10 \u2013 ''Nawrose Nur'' (USA); Boys U-12 \u2013 ''Boris Avrukh'' (URS); Boys U-14 \u2013 ''Judit Polg\u00e1r'' (HUN).\n\n:Girls U-10 \u2013 ''Evelyn Moncayo'' (ECU); Girls U-12 \u2013 ''Corina Peptan'' (ROM); Girls U-14 \u2013 ''Diana Darchia'' (URS).\n\n: --- [[CHESS magazine]] Vol 55.

There were initially some problems with overcrowding, but these were quickly sorted out by the organisers. There was a commentary room where those who had finished their games could benefit from the expert opinion of Grandmaster Helmut Pfleger. TV screens were displayed throughout the venue to cover the positions on the top boards. Peter Leko of Hungary, the world's youngest IM at the time, played in the U-14 event and was expected to win with an enormous [[Elo rating]] advantage over his closest rival.. However, his opponents had not read the script and he finished a disappointing fourth. There was a shock too in the Girls' U-14 section, when the Romanian Corina Peptan, top seed and national champion at 14, only managed to secure the silver medal. In contrast, the U-18 events went according to expectation with Sakaev (in the Boys/Open) and Kadimova (in the Girls) totally dominant. There was a good showing from the English contingent; by comparison other western European nations failed miserably. McShane won the Boys/Open U-10 event, despite being the youngest competitor at 8. Ruth Sheldon took silver in the U-12 Girls and Harriet Hunt a bronze in the U-14 Girls, even though she was heavily outrated. Gold medal winners were as follows:\n\n:Boys U-10 \u2013 ''Luke McShane'' (ENG); Boys U-12 \u2013 ''Georgi Bakhtadze'' (GEO); Boys U-14 \u2013 ''Yuri Tihonov'' (BLR); Boys U-16 \u2013 ''Ronen Har-Zvi'' (ISR); Boys U-18 \u2013 ''Konstantin Sakaev'' (RUS).\n\n:Girls U-10 \u2013 ''Parvana Ismajlova'' (AZE); Girls U-12 \u2013 ''Iweta Radziewicz'' (POL); Girls U-14 \u2013 ''Elina Danielian'' (ARM); Girls U-16 \u2013 ''Almira Skripchenko'' (MDA); Girls U-18 \u2013 ''Ilaha Kadimova'' (AZE).\n\n: --- [[CHESS magazine]] Vol 57.

Unfortunately the tournament got off to a bad start, before even a game had been played. The organisers had implemented an arduous registration process, designed to catch late registrants and penalise them or their federation with a $100 U.S. late entry fee. It appeared to be a cynical attempt at earning the organising committee a tidy sum. There were a number of protests; some paid up and others refused. Before things turned too nasty, Florencio Campomanes stepped in and ordered a reduction in the fee, which helped patch things up. However, the French were so upset that they decided to boycott the opening celebrations. Attending the closing ceremony was former World Champion Anatoly Karpov, the guest of honour replacing Campomanes on his departure. The contest contained a few surprises; Malakhov edged out Peter Leko in the Boys U-14 and a similar fate awaited the rapidly improving Vallejo Pons in the Boys U-12. Winners of the various age categories were as follows:\n\n:Boys U-10 \u2013 ''\u00c9tienne Bacrot'' (FRA); Boys U-12 \u2013 ''Evgeny Shaposhnikov'' (RUS); Boys U-14 \u2013 ''Volodia Malakhov'' (RUS); Boys U-16 \u2013 ''Dao Thien Hai'' (VIE); Boys U-18 \u2013 ''Zolt\u00e1n Alm\u00e1si'' (HUN).\n\n:Girls U-10 \u2013 ''Ana Matnadze'' (GEO); Girls U-12 \u2013 ''Evzhenia Chasovnikova'' (RUS); Girls U-14 \u2013 ''Ruth Sheldon'' (ENG); Girls U-16 \u2013 ''Elina Danielian'' (ARM); Girls U-18 \u2013 ''Ilaha Kadimova'' (AZE).\n\n: --- [[CHESS magazine]] Vol 58.

Bearing in mind his past disappointments, it is worth noting that other high-profile players missed gold medals at this event, including 2 future World Champions. In retrospect, this underlines the strength of the event. Among those taking home silver medals, were Alexandra Kosteniuk (U-10 Girls), \u00c9tienne Bacrot (U-12 Boys) and Rustam Kasimdzhanov (U-16 Boys). There was an impressive showing from the Ukrainian Girls Squad, taking 3 of the 5 gold medals on offer.

Russia's bright prospect Alexander Grischuk, already an International Master with a near Grandmaster rating, was (at 15 years) participating in the U-18 category. England turned up with a strong looking squad and performed even above their own expectations, landing two gold medals. Russia's Kosintseva sisters did enough to suggest they might become a powerful force in Ladies chess for years to come; Nadezhda took gold in the U-14 and Tatiana took silver in the U-12.

In both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] he played a key role in combined Dutch-British intelligence operations.\n\n==Early career==\nHe was born in 1883 in the naval town of [[Den Helder]] as the eight child of Laurens van 't Sant and N\u00e9line Fran\u00e7ois. His father was a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] in the Calvinist [[Dutch Reformed Church]]. His youth was mostly spend in the city of [[Utrecht]]. In 1906 he became a clerk within the [[Rotterdam]] Municipal Police Corps, a starters function for future police officers. He impressed his superiors so much that after an unusual short period of six months he was promoted inspector trainee. He served in Rotterdam's roughest neighbourhood, Rodezand, where sailors from all over the world would meet prostitutes. In 1910 he was promoted to inspector 3rd class and head of the River Police unit. On 27 August 1914 he married the Swedish [[soprano]] Kerstin (Greta) Margaretha Jonsson, after he had met her at a Wagner performance in Rotterdam during an international tour. In June 1915 the couple had a daughter.\n\n==World War I==\nAt the beginning of [[World War I]] Van 't Sant was tasked with controlling foreign [[secret agent]]s operating in [[Rotterdam]]. He also became an officer in the Dutch military intelligence and security service [[Dutch Military Intelligence and Security Service|GSIII]]. Because of its location and Dutch [[Country neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] the international port city become the war's largest spy centre. At an early stage Van 't Sant met [[Richard B. Tinsley|Richard Tinsley]], a maritime agent turned station chief of the British secret service now known as the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] or MI6. Between him and Tinsley a co-operation developed where the Rotterdam police would tolerate British intelligence operations directed against [[Germany]] in return for sharing the gathered intelligence. Van 't Sant attempted to establish a similar arrangement with the German secret services operating in Rotterdam, but no arrangement could be reached as the German services did not trust him.\n\nThanks to his ability to control foreign secret services and his dealings with Tinsley, at the age of 33 Inspector Van 't Sant was promoted to [[commissioner|head-commissioner]] (Chief of Police) of the city of Utrecht in November 1916. In 1918 the Germans approached him to establish contacts with the British government to begin the peace negotiations which brought the war to an end. Van 't Sant was awarded [[Order of the British Empire|Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]] by [[King George V]] in January 1920, a rare honour for non-British citizens.{{sfn|Ruis|2016|p= }}\n\n==Prince Henry==\nIn October 1920 Van 't Sant became head-commissioner of [[The Hague]], a more prestigious post than Utrecht, as it involved regular contacts with the Royal House and key government figures. Queen Wilhelmina employed Van 't Sant as her odd-job man. One of his main tasks would be to keep Prince-consort [[Prince Henry, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Henry, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], out of trouble. Next to his only legitimate daughter [[Princess Juliana of the Netherlands]], the future queen, Prince Henry had fathered several illegitimate children for which Van 't Sant had to make regular payments. Henry's philandering life style also involved regular visits to prostitutes. With knowledge of the queen, Van 't Sant invited prostitutes to his private home in The Hague in order to better control them and assess their health, before Prince Henry would enter through the back door and spend some time with them in Van 't Sant's guest room.{{sfn|Arlman & Mulder|1983|pp=57-58}}\n\nIn the 1930s Van 't Sant would become entangled in the 'Elisabeth le Roi Affair'. This affair was centred around a possible mistress of Prince Henry named Elisabeth le Roi, very likely a [[pseudonym]]. Van 't Sant pretended that her illegitimate child was fathered by the recently deceased [[Jonkheer]] Carel van Vredenburch, a former high ranking, rich and upper class Dutch diplomat. Van 't Sant convinced Vredenburch's heirs that the child was Vredenburch's and in order to avoid public embarrassment he had to pay the woman [[hush money]] and make her and her child disappear. But soon Vredenburch's family started to suspect Van 't Sant was swindling them as part of an ordinary blackmail scheme. An unofficial investigation and informal tribunal by three selected members of the ruling class followed. The tribunal acquitted Van 't Sant, but did reproach him for unprofessional behaviour. In January 1935 he resigned voluntarily as head-commissioner of police.{{sfn|Zee|2015|p=126}}\n\nQueen Wilhelmina intermittently employed Van 't Sant as her private secretary. When the story of the secret tribunal broke via the [[National socialism|National Socialist]] newspaper ''[[Volk en Vaderland]]'', public outcry forced the authorities to an official criminal investigation. It lasted until 1938 when Van 't Sant was again acquitted, due to lack of evidence. In 1956 Van 't Sant admitted in an interview with historian [[Loe de Jong]] that he had scammed the Vredenburch family and had made up the story in order to spare the Royals another scandal. Still, some people did not accept his explanation. Especially the Dutch writer and journalist [[A. den Doolaard]] would remain his adversary, publishing in as late as 1980 a pamphlet against Van 't Sant.\n\n==World War II==\nWhen the Germans invaded the Netherlands on Friday 10 May 1940 the Queen and the Royal Family were in danger of capture by the Nazis. On Sunday 12 May the Queen, accompanied by Van 't Sant, travelled to [[Hook of Holland]] and at 23.00 in the evening left the Netherlands on board of the British destroyer [[HMS Codrington]].{{sfn|Zee|2015|p=161}} Van 't Sant had to leave his wife and daughter behind. His house in The Hague was confiscated by the [[Sicherheitsdienst Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS|''Sicherheitsdienst'']] (SD), the security service of the SS, who used it as an office and its cellar as a torture chamber. In the exiled government based in London, Van 't Sant served as the private secretary of the queen and was the head of the [[Dutch Military Intelligence and Security Service|Centrale Inlichtingendienst (Dutch Central Intelligence Service)]] (CID) with the rank of major-general. The CID was an intelligence service for gathering information, supporting the resistance and committing sabotage in the German occupied Netherlands.\n\nVan 't Sant and the CID cooperated closely with the foreign intelligence division of [[MI6]], known as [[MI9|British Military Intelligence Section 9]]. Young volunteers were sent as secret agents into the Netherlands. They were trained by MI6, before being dropped by air or boat in the Netherlands. Due to bad training, insufficient preparation and betrayal many of these were arrested and executed by the Germans. Van 't Sant was not involved with the sending of Dutch agents into Holland by the [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]], which was being double played by the SD and [[Abwehr]] in the so-called [[Englandspiel]].\n[[File:Fran\u00e7oisvantSant.jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois van 't Sant on Pall Mall near St. James's Palace, London, 1946.]]\n\nGiven his aggregation of several functions, some people felt Van 't Sant was getting too powerful. In August 1941 he was forced to resign as head of the CID, though he remained active as an advisor to the Queen and director of Police. Many who escaped from the Netherlands were interrogated by him to establish their trustworthiness, out of fear of German infiltrators. Amongst these refugees were resistance heroes such as [[Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema]] and [[Peter Tazelaar]]. Many influential exiles, as well as resistance figures in the Netherlands, conspired against Van 't Sant as they did not trust him and considered him a [[Rasputin, Grigory Yefimovich|Rasputin]] figure. Unjustified rumours had it he was a German spy. In 1944 the queen fired him as her private secretary under pressure of prime minister [[Pieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy|Gerbrandy]] who was backed by [[Winston Churchill]].\n\nAfter the Netherlands was liberated Van 't Sant was re-united with his wife. They lived together in [[Torquay]], England, until her death in June 1950 from a stroke.\n\n==Later years==\nIn 1952 Van 't Sant returned to the Netherlands to live in Rotterdam, to be closer to his daughter. Once back, he soon became a confidant again of the Royal Family. As such he got involved in the so-called '[[Greet Hofmans]] Affair'. Greet Hofmans was a female faith healer, hand layer and pacifist, who gained a lot of influence on [[Queen Juliana]]. Although Prince-consort [[Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld|Bernhard, Prince of Lippe-Biesterfeld]], had introduced Hofmans in 1948 to the queen in order to cure their youngest daughter, [[Princess Christina of the Netherlands|Princess Christina]], he soon distrusted her and tried to send her away. When this failed he leaked to the German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], who published an article on 13 June 1956 which brought the affair in the open. It resulted in a pitched battle between the Queen and her husband, who was supported by his oldest daughter, the future [[Queen Beatrix]]. The affair led to a severe crisis in the Royal marriage. A commission was created to investigate the affair and Van 't Sant acted as an important witness, as he was trusted by both parties. In the end the queen was forced to expel Hofmans from her court.\n\nIn the morning of 3 June 1966 Fran\u00e7ois van 't Sant died in his sleep at the age of 83 in Rotterdam.\n\n==Portrayal in popular culture==\nIn 1977 Dutch film director [[Paul Verhoeven]] directed ''Soldaat van Oranje'' which was internationally distributed as ''[[Soldier of Orange]]''. The film is loosely based on the memoirs of Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema (see above), who is portrayed by [[Rutger Hauer]]. Van 't Sant appears as 'Van der Zanden'. His person also plays a major role in the television series ''Wilhelmina'' (NCRV, 2001). A Van 't Sant character appeared in the musical version of ''[[Soldier of Orange (musical)|Soldaat van Oranje]]'', which premi\u00e8red in the Netherlands in 2010. The production was very successful, and toured the world in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-ca-cm-soldier-orange-theater-20161225-story.html|last=Bradner|first=Liesl |title='Soldier of Orange': It's the 'Hamilton' of the Netherlands, and it's immersive theater to an extreme|date=22 December 2016|accessdate=9 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Arlman, Hugo & Gerard Mulder ''Van de prins geen kwaad'' (From the prince do not know evil) Amsterdam: Sijthoff, 1983. {{in lang|nl}}\n* Doolaard, A. den ''Londen en de zaak Van 't Sant'' (London and the Van 't Sant' case) Amsterdam: Querido, 1980. {{in lang|nl}}\n* Jong, Loe de ''Het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden in de Tweede Wereldoorlog'' (The Kingdom of the Netherlands in World War II) The Hague: SDU, 1969-1994 {{in lang|nl}}\n* Ruis, Edwin ''Spynest.

Young volunteers were sent as secret agents into the Netherlands. They were trained by MI6, before being dropped by air or boat in the Netherlands. Due to bad training, insufficient preparation and betrayal many of these were arrested and executed by the Germans. Given his aggregation of several functions, some people felt Van 't Sant was getting too powerful within the Dutch government in exile. In August 1941 he was forced to resign as head of the CID. But he remained active as an advisor to the Queen and director of Police. Many Dutchmen whom escaped from the Netherlands to England, were first interrogated by him to establish their trustworthiness, out of fear for German infiltrators. Amongst these refugees were famous resistance heroes as [[Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema]] and [[Peter Tazelaar]]. Van 't Sant was not involved with the sending of Dutch agents into Holland by the [[Special Operations Executive|SOE]], which was being double played by the SD and [[Abwehr]] in the so-called [[Englandspiel]].\n[[File:Fran\u00e7oisvantSant.jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois van 't Sant on Pall Mall near St. James's Palace, London, 1946.]]\n\nDuring World War II many influential members of the exiled Dutch, as well as resistance figures in the Netherlands, conspired against Van 't Sant, as they did not trust him and considered him a [[Rasputin, Grigory Yefimovich|Rasputin]] type of figure. Unjustified rumours had it he was a German spy. In 1944 the queen fired him as her private secretary under pressure of prime minister [[Pieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy|Gerbrandy]] who was backed by [[Winston Churchill]].\n\nAfter the Netherlands was liberated Van 't Sant was re-united with his wife. They lived together in [[Torquay]], England, until her death in June 1950 from a stroke.\n\n==Later years==\nIn 1952 Van 't Sant returned to the Netherlands to live in Rotterdam, to be closer to his daughter. Once back, he soon became a confidant again of the Royal Family. As such he got involved in the so-called '[[Greet Hofmans]] Affair'. Greet Hofmans was a female faith healer, hand layer and pacifist, who gained a lot of influence on [[Queen Juliana]]. Although Prince-consort [[Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld|Bernhard, Prince of Lippe-Biesterfeld]], had introduced Hofmans in 1948 to the queen in order to cure their youngest daughter, [[Princess Christina of the Netherlands|Princess Christina]], he soon distrusted her and tried to send her away. When this failed he leaked to the German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], who published an article on 13 June 1956 which brought the affair in the open. It resulted in a pitched battle between the Queen and her husband, who was supported by his oldest daughter, the future [[Queen Beatrix]]. The affair led to a severe crisis in the Royal marriage. A commission was created to investigate the affair and Van 't Sant acted as an important witness, as he was trusted by both parties. In the end the queen was forced to expel Hofmans from her court.\n\nIn the morning of 3 June 1966 Fran\u00e7ois van 't Sant died in his sleep at the age of 83 in Rotterdam.\n\n==Portrayal in popular culture==\nIn 1977 Dutch film director [[Paul Verhoeven]] directed ''Soldaat van Oranje'' which was internationally distributed as ''[[Soldier of Orange]]''. The film is loosely based on the memoirs of Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema (see above), who is portrayed by [[Rutger Hauer]]. Van 't Sant appears as 'Van der Zanden'. His person also plays a major role in the television series ''Wilhelmina'' (NCRV, 2001). A Van 't Sant character appeared in the musical version of ''[[Soldier of Orange (musical)|Soldaat van Oranje]]'', which premi\u00e8red in the Netherlands in 2010. The production was very successful, and toured the world in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-ca-cm-soldier-orange-theater-20161225-story.html|last=Bradner|first=Liesl |title='Soldier of Orange': It's the 'Hamilton' of the Netherlands, and it's immersive theater to an extreme|date=22 December 2016|accessdate=9 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Arlman, Hugo & Gerard Mulder ''Van de prins geen kwaad'' (From the prince do not know evil) Amsterdam: Sijthoff, 1983. {{in lang|nl}}\n* Doolaard, A. den ''Londen en de zaak Van 't Sant'' (London and the Van 't Sant' case) Amsterdam: Querido, 1980. {{in lang|nl}}\n* Jong, Loe de ''Het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden in de Tweede Wereldoorlog'' (The Kingdom of the Netherlands in World War II) The Hague: SDU, 1969-1994 {{in lang|nl}}\n* Ruis, Edwin ''Spynest.
