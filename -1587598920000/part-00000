It was undertaken in support of Osbourne's second album ''[[Diary of a Madman (album)|Diary of a Madman]]'' and covered Europe, North America, and Asia. This was Rhoads's last tour as he died in a plane crash at a small airport in [[Leesburg, Florida]], on March 19, 1982, during the first leg of the tour. The band took a two-week break after his death. Ozzy and [[Sharon Osbourne]] restarted the tour with ex-[[Gillan (band)|Gillan]] guitarist [[Bernie Torm\u00e9]], who only performed a couple of shows before being replaced by future [[Night Ranger]] guitarist, [[Brad Gillis]].\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Background===\nAfter the ''[[Blizzard of Ozz Tour]],'' the band took a one-month break before going to [[Europe]] to start the tour supporting the upcoming album, ''[[Diary of a Madman (album)|Diary of a Madman]],'' scheduled for worldwide release on November 7, 1981. Osbourne, Rhoads, [[Rudy Sarzo]], [[Tommy Aldridge]], and Lindsay Bridgwater reconvened at [[Shepperton Studios]] in England, where they would spend the next two weeks rehearsing.\n\n===European leg===\nOn November 4, 1981, the band arrived in [[Hamburg]], Germany to start the tour, opening up for [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]] in Europe. The band's first show was at [[Ernst-Merck-Halle]] in front of a sold-out crowd. On November 7, ''Diary of a Madman'' was released worldwide and \"[[Flying High Again]]\", \"[[Over the Mountain]]\", \"[[You Can't Kill Rock and Roll]]\" and \"Diary of a Madman\" were released as singles. On November 13, after the band's performance at Upper Swabia Hall in Ravensburg, Sharon called off the rest of the European leg because of Osbourne's mental health issues resulting from his marriage to Thelma Osbourne having fallen apart. Sharon took Osbourne back to England and checked him into a mental health clinic while the rest of the band went on excursions through Germany and France before returning to England.\n\nOn November 22, the rest of the band reconvened at Shepperton Studios to begin pre-production rehearsals for the United Kingdom dates while Osbourne was in hospital. The band rehearsed songs from ''Blizzard of Ozz'', and the three Black Sabbath songs they had already been performing, \"Over the Mountain,\" \"Flying High Again\" and \"Believer\" from ''Diary of a Madman.'' On November 29, with opening act Girl, the band performed at [[Colston Hall]] in [[Bristol]]. On December 2, the band performed its last show of the leg at the [[Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool|Royal Court Theatre]] in [[Liverpool]]. The rest of the European leg was canceled because of Osbourne's depression.\n\n===North American leg (December 1981\u2013March 19, 1982)===\nAfter returning to Los Angeles on December 5, the band took a break for a couple of weeks and then began pre-production rehearsals. Lindsay Bridgwater departed at this time and [[Don Airey]], former keyboardist of [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]] was hired. In December, ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' taped some video footage of the band's rehearsals for a segment on the new show. On December 30, the band performed at the [[Cow Palace]] in [[Daly City, California]]. Rhoads received the Best New Talent Award from ''[[Guitar Player]].''<ref>http://liveforlivemusic.com/features/celebrating-the-life-of-randy-rhoads-on-the-anniversary-of-his-death/</ref> The band returned to Los Angeles for their last show at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]]. English [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[UFO (band)|UFO]] and [[Starfighters (band)|Starfighters]] were added to the bill as the opening bands. On January 7, the band played at [[Tingley Coliseum]] in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]]. The local news filmed the first part of the show where the band performed \"Over the Mountain\" and \"Mr. Crowley\".\n\nOn January 20, at the [[Community Choice Credit Union Convention Center|Des Moines Veterans Memorial Auditorium]] a fan threw a dead bat, (stolen from the science department of Lincoln, a local high school), onto the stage. Osbourne, believing it to be a toy, took the bat, held out its wings and bit it on a wing then threw it back into the audience. This resulted in him being checked into Des Moines General Hospital to receive rabies shots after the show. On January 24 at [[Allstate Arena|Rosemont Horizon]] in [[Rosemont, Illinois]], Osbourne lifted Rhoads up by his right leg during \"Mr. Crowley\". A professional photographer captured the moment and the image was used as the cover art for the live album, ''[[Tribute (Ozzy Osbourne album)|Tribute]].'' As the band played \"Over the Mountain\" at the [[State Farm Center|Assembly Hall]] on their January 26 show, Osbourne collapsed during the middle of the song, and was pulled off stage by Sharon Osbourne and the rest of stage crew, while the band finished instrumentally. He was rushed to the hospital and the remainder of the show was cancelled. Osbourne was given two days to rest and heal from his illness caused by the rabies shots. The band went on to Chicago.\n\nBefore the band's performance at [[Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)|Civic Arena]] on February 2, Rhoads did a guitar seminar at the Music City Record Store in [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania]]. On February 11, after playing at the [[Market Square Arena]] in [[Indianapolis]], tensions between Osbourne and Rhoads grew as Rhoads did not want to play on a live record consisting of Black Sabbath songs as he felt it would be a major step backward in his career. The record company forced Ozzy and Sharon  to release the album.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The band performed at [[Fair Park Coliseum (Beaumont, Texas)|Fair Park Coliseum]] in [[Beaumont, Texas]] on February 16, where the soundcheck rehearsal that took place earlier that day was captured on video. On February 19, Sharon hid all of Ozzy's clothes so that he could not go out and drink anymore. Ozzy put on Sharon's nightgown, got drunk, urinated on [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|The Alamo]] and was arrested. He was released hours before the show after Sharon warned the police that the concert promoters were worried that not releasing Osbourne from jail would result in the cancellation of that evening's performance and possibly incite a riot. After Osbourne was released, the band performed at the [[Hemisfair Arena|San Antonio Convention Center Arena]]. Osbourne became \"Public Enemy #1\" in Texas and received death threats from parents, religious groups and political activists. On February 20, before that evening's performance at [[Reunion Arena]], Rhoads agreed to play on the live album, one more studio album, and to tour with Osbourne. He would then leave to attend the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] to obtain his master's degree in classical guitar. The band performed in front of a sold-out crowd at [[Knoxville Civic Auditorium and Coliseum|Knoxville Civic Coliseum]] on March 18.\n\nThe band were on the tour bus, which was supposed to be heading to [[Orlando, Florida]], for the ''[[Rock Super Bowl]]'' at the [[Orlando Citrus Bowl Stadium|Tangerine Bowl]] on March 20, but a mechanical problem forced it into a depot called Flying Baron Estates, outside [[Leesburg, Florida]] for repairs. Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne, Rudy Sarzo, and Tommy Aldridge were all asleep while Randy Roads, Don Airey, tour manager Jake Duncan, Rhoads's hairdresser Rachel Youngblood, bus driver Andrew Aycock and his wife Wanda, and the rest of the crew were awake. On the property, there was an airstrip and a hangar full of small airplanes. Aycock, who claimed to be an experienced pilot, took a [[Beechcraft Bonanza|Beechcraft Bonanza F35]] plane out of the hangar and offered to take people up in the air. During one of the flights with Aycock, Rhoads, and Youngblood, the left wing struck the bus causing the plane to crash, instantly killing all three. <ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=duLYBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT29&dq=%22Diary+of+a+Madman+Tour%22#v=onepage&q=%22Diary%20of%20a%20Madman%20Tour%22&f=false |title = Master of the Moon: Ronnie James Dio|isbn = 9781312293878|last1 = Presents|first1 = Wikipedia}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/?id=8F65gkvsOy8C&pg=PA123&dq=%22Diary+of+a+Madman+Tour%22#v=onepage&q=%22Diary%20of%20a%20Madman%20Tour%22&f=false | title=Black Sabbath}}</ref> Once the investigation was over on March 21, the band returned to Los Angeles, where they spent the next two weeks trying to recuperate from the tragedy while attempting to find another guitarist.\n\n===North American leg (1982)===\nThe band, and especially Osbourne, was in a severe state of depression. Ozzy's drug and alcohol addiction and mental state had worsened. On the day of Rhoads's death, Osbourne had said that it was over and that he never wanted to play again. Sharon got Ozzy back on his feet to finish the tour for his fans. Osbourne had said: \"You Can't Kill Rock 'N' Roll,\" when he was interviewed on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' a week after Rhoads's death. Rudy Sarzo called his younger brother, future-[[Hurricane (American band)|Hurricane]] lead-guitarist, [[Robert Sarzo|Robert]] and asked him to audition and play the material the same way as Randy; he was hired. Another guitarist showed up to audition, former-[[Gillan (band)|Gillan]] guitarist, [[Bernie Torm\u00e9]]. He had been hired and given an advance by Sharon's father, [[Don Arden]], and even though his audition did not go smoothly because he was unfamiliar with the material, and his playing style and feel was different from Rhoads, Torm\u00e9 ended up getting the job instead of Sarzo.\n\nOn March 28, the band flew to [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]] for three days of rehearsals to restart the tour. On April 1, the band restarted the tour at [[Stabler Arena]] in Bethlehem. UFO was back as an opening act in Bethlehem, and [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]] was added during the following five-show stint at Philadelphia's Spectrum. After the Philadelphia shows with Torm\u00e9, who was eager to start his solo career, Sharon found future-[[Night Ranger]] guitarist, [[Brad Gillis]]. He did not feel ready to play onstage yet as he needed some time to learn the setlist. Torm\u00e9 did several more shows with the band until Gillis was ready. On April 13, he played with the band for the first time at [[Floyd L. Maines Veterans Memorial Arena|Broome County Veterans Memorial Arena]] in [[Binghamton, New York]]. The band finished the tour with Gillis and Torm\u00e9 left to start his solo career.\n\nAfter the band's performance at [[Glens Falls Civic Center|Glens Falls Civic Arena]] in New York on May 10, Sharon put the tour on hold again as Osbourne's depression, mental illness, and drug and alcohol addiction had grown worse. The rest of the tour's shows were postponed. The band restarted the tour on May 19 at [[Cape Cod Coliseum]] in [[South Yarmouth, Massachusetts]] with Magnum as the opening band for the East Coast and Midwest shows, and the Canadian band, Santers, opening for the Canadian dates. Axe was the opening band for the West Coast shows. On June 19, the band performed its first laser show at [[Oracle Arena|Oakland Arena]] in California. The band performed at [[Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre (Irvine, California)|Irvine Meadows]] on June 25, where the live pro-video footage was used for ''Speak of the Devil Live,'' which was broadcast on MTV on Halloween.\n\nOn July 4, Ozzy and Sharon got married. From July 9 to 15, the band performed several shows in Japan. Later on August 6, the day before the band's show at the ''Rock N Roll Super Bowl (1982)'' at [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|The Cotton Bowl]] in [[Dallas]] where [[Le Roux (band)|Le Roux]] was opening and the supporting acts were [[Loverboy]] and [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], Osbourne's depression had grown even worse, and not wanting to do more shows, he [[head shaving|shaved his head]] completely. This did not stop Sharon from forcing him to get on stage wearing a wig. Osbourne ripped the wig off his head and threw it into the audience.\n\n==Personnel==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;European line-up\n* Ozzy Osbourne \u2014 vocals\n* Randy Rhoads \u2014 guitar\n* Rudy

metal]] vocalist [[Ozzy Osbourne]]. It was undertaken in support of Osbourne's second album ''[[Diary of a Madman (album)|Diary of a Madman]]'' and covered Europe, North America, and Asia. This was Rhoads's last tour as he died in a plane crash at a small airport in [[Leesburg, Florida]], on March 19, 1982, during the first leg of the tour. The band took a two-week break after his death. Ozzy and [[Sharon Osbourne]] restarted the tour with ex-[[Gillan (band)|Gillan]] guitarist [[Bernie Torm\u00e9]], who only performed a couple of shows before being replaced by future [[Night Ranger]] guitarist, [[Brad Gillis]].\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Background===\nAfter the ''[[Blizzard of Ozz Tour]],'' the band took a one-month break before going to [[Europe]] to start the tour supporting the upcoming album, ''[[Diary of a Madman (album)|Diary of a Madman]],'' scheduled for worldwide release on November 7, 1981. Osbourne, Rhoads, [[Rudy Sarzo]], [[Tommy Aldridge]], and Lindsay Bridgwater reconvened at [[Shepperton Studios]] in England where they would spend the next two weeks rehearsing.\n\n===European leg===\nOn November 4, 1981, the band arrived in [[Hamburg]], Germany to start the tour, opening up for [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]] in Europe. The band's first show was at [[Ernst-Merck-Halle]] in front of a sold-out crowd. On November 7, ''Diary of a Madman'' was released worldwide and \"[[Flying High Again]]\", \"[[Over the Mountain]]\", \"[[You Can't Kill Rock and Roll]]\" and \"Diary of a Madman\" were released as singles. On November 13, after the band's performance at Upper Swabia Hall in Ravensburg, Sharon called off the rest of the European leg because of Osbourne's mental health issues resulting from his marriage to Thelma Osbourne having fallen apart. Sharon took Osbourne back to England and checked him into a mental health clinic while the rest of the band went on excursions through Germany and France before returning to England.\n\nOn November 22, the rest of the band reconvened at Shepperton Studios to begin pre-production rehearsals for the United Kingdom dates while Osbourne was in hospital. The band rehearsed songs from ''Blizzard of Ozz'', and the three Black Sabbath songs they had already been performing, \"Over the Mountain,\" \"Flying High Again\" and \"Believer\" from ''Diary of a Madman.'' On November 29, with opening act Girl, the band performed at [[Colston Hall]] in [[Bristol]]. On December 2, the band performed its last show of the leg at the [[Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool|Royal Court Theatre]] in [[Liverpool]]. The rest of the European leg was canceled because of Osbourne's depression.\n\n===North American leg (December 1981\u2013March 19, 1982)===\nAfter returning to Los Angeles on December 5, the band took a break for a couple of weeks and then began pre-production rehearsals. Lindsay Bridgwater departed at this time and [[Don Airey]], former keyboardist of [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]] was hired. In December, ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' taped some video footage of the band's rehearsals for a segment on the new show. On December 30, the band performed at the [[Cow Palace]] in [[Daly City, California]]. Rhoads received the Best New Talent Award from ''[[Guitar Player]].''<ref>http://liveforlivemusic.com/features/celebrating-the-life-of-randy-rhoads-on-the-anniversary-of-his-death/</ref> The band returned to Los Angeles for their last show at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]]. English [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[UFO (band)|UFO]] and [[Starfighters (band)|Starfighters]] were added to the bill as the opening bands. On January 7, the band played at [[Tingley Coliseum]] in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]]. The local news filmed the first part of the show where the band performed \"Over the Mountain\" and \"Mr. Crowley\".\n\nOn January 20, at the [[Community Choice Credit Union Convention Center|Des Moines Veterans Memorial Auditorium]] a fan threw a dead bat, (stolen from the science department of Lincoln, a local high school), onto the stage. Osbourne, believing it to be a toy, took the bat, held out its wings and bit it on a wing then threw it back into the audience. This resulted in him being checked into Des Moines General Hospital to receive rabies shots after the show. On January 24 at [[Allstate Arena|Rosemont Horizon]] in [[Rosemont, Illinois]], Osbourne lifted Rhoads up by his right leg during \"Mr. Crowley\". A professional photographer captured the moment and the image was used as the cover art for the live album, ''[[Tribute (Ozzy Osbourne album)|Tribute]].'' As the band played \"Over the Mountain\" at the [[State Farm Center|Assembly Hall]] on their January 26 show, Osbourne collapsed during the middle of the song, and was pulled off stage by Sharon Osbourne and the rest of stage crew, while the band finished instrumentally. He was rushed to the hospital and the remainder of the show was cancelled. Osbourne was given two days to rest and heal from his illness caused by the rabies shots. The band went on to Chicago.\n\nBefore the band's performance at [[Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)|Civic Arena]] on February 2, Rhoads did a guitar seminar at the Music City Record Store in [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania]]. On February 11, after playing at the [[Market Square Arena]] in [[Indianapolis]], tensions between Osbourne and Rhoads grew as Rhoads did not want to play on a live record consisting of Black Sabbath songs as he felt it would be a major step backward in his career. The record company forced Ozzy and Sharon  to release the album.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The band performed at [[Fair Park Coliseum (Beaumont, Texas)|Fair Park Coliseum]] in [[Beaumont, Texas]] on February 16, where the soundcheck rehearsal that took place earlier that day was captured on video. On February 19, Sharon hid all of Ozzy's clothes so that he could not go out and drink anymore. Ozzy put on Sharon's nightgown, got drunk, urinated on [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|The Alamo]] and was arrested. He was released hours before the show after Sharon warned the police that the concert promoters were worried that not releasing Osbourne from jail would result in the cancellation of that evening's performance and possibly incite a riot. After Osbourne was released, the band performed at the [[Hemisfair Arena|San Antonio Convention Center Arena]]. Osbourne became \"Public Enemy #1\" in Texas and received death threats from parents, religious groups and political activists. On February 20, before that evening's performance at [[Reunion Arena]], Rhoads agreed to play on the live album, one more studio album, and to tour with Osbourne. He would then leave to attend the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] to obtain his master's degree in classical guitar. The band performed in front of a sold-out crowd at [[Knoxville Civic Auditorium and Coliseum|Knoxville Civic Coliseum]] on March 18.\n\nThe band were on the tour bus, which was supposed to be heading to [[Orlando, Florida]] for the ''[[Rock Super Bowl]]'' at the [[Orlando Citrus Bowl Stadium|Tangerine Bowl]] on March 20, but a mechanical problem forced it into a depot called Flying Baron Estates, outside [[Leesburg, Florida]] for repairs. Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne, Rudy Sarzo, and Tommy Aldridge were all asleep while Randy Roads, Don Airey, tour manager Jake Duncan, Rhoads's hairdresser Rachel Youngblood, bus driver Andrew Aycock and his wife Wanda, and the rest of the crew were awake. On the property, there was an airstrip and a hangar full of small airplanes. Aycock, who claimed to be an experienced pilot, took a [[Beechcraft Bonanza|Beechcraft Bonanza F35]] plane out of the hangar and offered to take people up in the air. During one of the flights with Aycock, Rhoads, and Youngblood, the left wing struck the bus causing the plane to crash, instantly killing all three. <ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=duLYBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT29&dq=%22Diary+of+a+Madman+Tour%22#v=onepage&q=%22Diary%20of%20a%20Madman%20Tour%22&f=false |title = Master of the Moon: Ronnie James Dio|isbn = 9781312293878|last1 = Presents|first1 = Wikipedia}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/?id=8F65gkvsOy8C&pg=PA123&dq=%22Diary+of+a+Madman+Tour%22#v=onepage&q=%22Diary%20of%20a%20Madman%20Tour%22&f=false | title=Black Sabbath}}</ref> Once the investigation was over on March 21, the band returned to Los Angeles where they spent the next two weeks trying to recuperate from the tragedy while attempting to find another guitarist.\n\n===North American leg (1982)===\nThe band, and especially Osbourne, was in a severe state of depression. Ozzy's drug and alcohol addiction and mental state had worsened. On the day of Rhoads's death, Osbourne had said that it was over and that he never wanted to play again. Sharon got Ozzy back on his feet to finish the tour for his fans. Osbourne had said: \"You Can't Kill Rock 'N' Roll,\" when he was interviewed on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' a week after Rhoads's death. Rudy Sarzo called his younger brother, future-[[Hurricane (American band)|Hurricane]] lead-guitarist, [[Robert Sarzo|Robert]] and asked him to audition and play the material the same way as Randy; he was hired. Another guitarist showed up to audition, former-[[Gillan (band)|Gillan]] guitarist, [[Bernie Torm\u00e9]]. He had been hired and given an advance by Sharon's father, [[Don Arden]], and even though his audition did not go smoothly because he was unfamiliar with the material, and his playing style and feel was different from Rhoads, Torm\u00e9 ended up getting the job instead of Sarzo.\n\nOn March 28, the band flew to [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]] for three days of rehearsals to restart the tour. On April 1, the band restarted the tour at [[Stabler Arena]] in Bethlehem. UFO was back as an opening act in Bethlehem, and [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]] was added during the following five-show stint at Philadelphia's Spectrum. After the Philadelphia shows with Torm\u00e9, who was eager to start his solo career, Sharon found future-[[Night Ranger]] guitarist, [[Brad Gillis]]. He did not feel ready to play onstage yet as he needed some time to learn the setlist. Torm\u00e9 did several more shows with the band until Gillis was ready. On April 13, he played with the band for the first time at [[Floyd L. Maines Veterans Memorial Arena|Broome County Veterans Memorial Arena]] in [[Binghamton, New York]]. The band finished the tour with Gillis and Torm\u00e9 left to start his solo career.\n\nAfter the band's performance at [[Glens Falls Civic Center|Glens Falls Civic Arena]] in New York on May 10, Sharon put the tour on hold again as Osbourne's depression, mental illness, and drug and alcohol addiction had grown worse. The rest of the tour's shows were postponed. The band restarted the tour on May 19 at [[Cape Cod Coliseum]] in [[South Yarmouth, Massachusetts]] with Magnum as the opening band for the East Coast and Midwest shows, and the Canadian band, Santers, opening for the Canadian dates. Axe was the opening band for the West Coast shows. On June 19, the band performed its first laser show at [[Oracle Arena|Oakland Arena]] in California. The band performed at [[Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre (Irvine, California)|Irvine Meadows]] on June 25, where the live pro-video footage was used for ''Speak of the Devil Live,'' which was broadcast on MTV on Halloween.\n\nOn July 4, Ozzy and Sharon got married. From July 9 to 15, the band performed several shows in Japan. Later on August 6, the day before the band's show at the ''Rock N Roll Super Bowl (1982)'' at [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|The Cotton Bowl]] in [[Dallas]] where [[Le Roux (band)|Le Roux]] was opening and the supporting acts were [[Loverboy]] and [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], Osbourne's depression had grown even worse, and not wanting to do more shows, he [[head shaving|shaved his head]] completely. This did not stop Sharon from forcing him to get on stage wearing a wig. Osbourne ripped the wig off his head and threw it into the audience.\n\n==Personnel==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;European line-up\n* Ozzy Osbourne \u2014 vocals\n* Randy Rhoads \u2014 guitar\n* Rudy

Its use greatly increased during [[World War II]]. Since the early 1940s, millions of American workers have been exposed to asbestos dust. Initially, the risks associated with asbestos exposure were not publicly known. However, an increased risk of developing mesothelioma was later found among naval personnel (e.g., Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard), shipyard workers, people who work in asbestos mines and mills, producers of asbestos products, workers in the heating and construction industries, and other tradespeople. Today, the official position of the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) and the U.S. EPA is that protections and \"permissible exposure limits\" required by U.S. regulations, while adequate to prevent most asbestos-related non-malignant disease, are ''not'' adequate to prevent or protect against asbestos-related cancers such as mesothelioma.<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/81-103/pdfs/81-103.pdf NIOSH Working Group Paper from the Centers for Disease Control, 1980] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170618094802/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/81-103/pdfs/81-103.pdf |date=2017-06-18 }}</ref> Likewise, the British Government's [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) states formally that any threshold for exposure to asbestos must be at a very low level and it is widely agreed that if any such threshold does exist at all, then it cannot currently be quantified.

Deposition of asbestos fibers in the [[parenchyma]] of the lung may result in the penetration of the [[visceral pleura]] from where the fiber can then be carried to the pleural surface, thus leading to the development of malignant mesothelial plaques. The processes leading to the development of [[peritoneal mesothelioma]] remain unresolved, although it has been proposed that asbestos fibers from the lung are transported to the abdomen and associated organs via the [[lymphatic system]]. Additionally, asbestos fibers may be deposited in the gut after ingestion of sputum contaminated with asbestos fibers.{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}\n\nPleural contamination with asbestos or other mineral fibers has been shown to cause cancer.

They remain suspended in the air where they can be inhaled, and may penetrate more easily and deeper into the lungs. \"We probably will find out a lot more about the health aspects of asbestos from [the World Trade Center attack], unfortunately,\" said Dr. Alan Fein, chief of pulmonary and critical-care medicine at North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prwatch.org/files/pdfs/prwatch/prwv8n4.pdf |title=The Junkman's Answer to Terrorism: Use More Asbestos |publisher=Center for Media and Democracy: Prwatch.org |accessdate=2010-08-20 |date=2001 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016132405/http://prwatch.org/files/pdfs/prwatch/prwv8n4.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-16 }}</ref>\n\nMesothelioma development in rats has been demonstrated following intra-pleural inoculation of phosphorylated chrysotile fibers. It has been suggested that in humans, transport of fibers to the pleura is critical to the pathogenesis of mesothelioma. This is supported by the observed recruitment of significant numbers of [[macrophage]]s and other cells of the [[immune system]] to localized lesions of accumulated asbestos fibers in the pleural and peritoneal cavities of rats. These lesions continued to attract and accumulate macrophages as the disease progressed, and cellular changes within the lesion culminated in a morphologically malignant tumor.{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}\n\nExperimental evidence suggests that asbestos acts as a complete carcinogen with the development of mesothelioma occurring in sequential stages of initiation and promotion. The molecular mechanisms underlying the malignant transformation of normal mesothelial cells by asbestos fibers remain unclear despite the demonstration of its oncogenic capabilities (see next-but-one paragraph). However, complete in vitro transformation of normal human mesothelial cells to a malignant [[phenotype]] following exposure to asbestos fibers has not yet been achieved. In general, asbestos fibers are thought to act through direct physical interactions with the cells of the mesothelium in conjunction with indirect effects following interaction with inflammatory cells such as macrophages.{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}\n\n===Intracellular===\nAnalysis of the interactions between asbestos fibers and [[DNA]] has shown that phagocytosed fibers are able to make contact with [[chromosome]]s, often adhering to the [[chromatin]] fibers or becoming entangled within the chromosome. This contact between the asbestos fiber and the chromosomes or structural proteins of the spindle apparatus can induce complex abnormalities. The most common abnormality is [[monosomy]] of chromosome 22. Other frequent abnormalities include structural rearrangement of 1p, 3p, 9p and 6q chromosome arms.{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}\n\nCommon gene abnormalities in mesothelioma cell lines include deletion of the [[tumor suppressor gene]]s:{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}\n* [[Neurofibromatosis]] type 2 at 22q12\n* [[p16 (gene)|P16<sup>INK4A</sup>]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chiosea|first1=S|last2=Krasinskas|first2=A|last3=Cagle|first3=PT|last4=Mitchell|first4=KA|last5=Zander|first5=DS|last6=Dacic|first6=S|title=Diagnostic importance of 9p21 homozygous deletion in malignant mesotheliomas|journal=Modern Pathology |date=June 2008|volume=21|issue=6|pages=742\u20137|pmid=18327208|doi=10.1038/modpathol.2008.45|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n* [[p14arf|P14<sup>ARF</sup>]]\n\nAsbestos has also been shown to mediate the entry of foreign DNA into target cells.

Following asbestos phagocytosis, macrophages generate increased amounts of hydroxyl [[radical (chemistry)|radicals]], which are normal by-products of cellular anaerobic metabolism. However, these free radicals are also known [[clastogenic]] (chromosome-breaking) \nand membrane-active agents thought to promote asbestos carcinogenicity.

For example, chrysotile fibres have been shown to depress the in vitro proliferation of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes, suppress natural killer cell lysis and significantly reduce [[lymphokine-activated killer cell]] viability and recovery. Furthermore, genetic alterations in asbestos-activated macrophages may result in the release of potent mesothelial cell mitogens such as [[platelet-derived growth factor]] (PDGF) and [[transforming growth factor]]-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) which in turn, may induce the chronic stimulation and proliferation of mesothelial cells after injury by asbestos fibres.{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:MesotheliomaCXR.png|thumb|CXR demonstrating a mesothelioma]]\n[[Image:Tumor Mesothelioma2 legend.jpg|thumb|CT scan of a patient with mesothelioma, [[Coronal plane|coronal section]] (the section follows the plane that divides the body in a front and a back half).

Diagnosis begins with a review of the patient's medical history. A history of exposure to asbestos may increase clinical suspicion for mesothelioma. A physical examination is performed, followed by [[chest X-ray]] and often [[spirometry|lung function tests]]. The X-ray may reveal pleural thickening commonly seen after asbestos exposure and increases suspicion of mesothelioma.<ref name=\"Diffuse\"/> A [[computed tomography|CT]] (or CAT) scan or an [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging|MRI]] is usually performed. If a large amount of fluid is present, abnormal cells may be detected by [[cytopathology]] if this fluid is [[Needle aspiration biopsy|aspirated]] with a syringe.<ref name=Sar2012 /> For pleural fluid, this is done by [[thoracentesis]] or tube thoracostomy ([[chest tube]]); for ascites, with [[paracentesis]] or ascitic drain; and for [[Pericardium|pericardial]] effusion with [[pericardiocentesis]]. While absence of malignant cells on cytology does not completely exclude mesothelioma, it makes it much more unlikely, especially if an alternative diagnosis can be made (e.g., [[tuberculosis]], [[heart failure]]).{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}} However, with primary pericardial mesothelioma, pericardial fluid may not contain malignant cells and a tissue biopsy is more useful in diagnosis.<ref name=Sar2012 /> Using conventional cytology  diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma is difficult, but [[immunohistochemistry]] has greatly enhanced the accuracy of cytology.{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}\n\n===Biopsy===\nGenerally, a [[biopsy]] is needed to confirm a diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. A doctor removes a sample of tissue for examination under a microscope by a [[histopathology|pathologist]]. A biopsy may be done in different ways, depending on where the abnormal area is located. If the cancer is in the chest, the doctor may perform a [[thoracoscopy]]. In this procedure, the doctor makes a small cut through the chest wall and puts a thin, lighted tube called a thoracoscope into the chest between two ribs. Thoracoscopy allows the doctor to look inside the chest and obtain tissue samples. Alternatively, the chest surgeon might directly open the chest ([[thoracotomy]]). If the cancer is in the abdomen, the doctor may perform a [[laparoscopy]]. To obtain tissue for examination, the doctor makes a small incision in the abdomen and inserts a special instrument into the abdominal cavity. If these procedures do not yield enough tissue, an [[open surgery|open surgical procedure]] may be necessary.{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}\n\n===Immunochemistry===\nImmunohistochemical studies play an important role for the pathologist in differentiating malignant mesothelioma from neoplastic mimics, such as breast or lung cancer that has metastasized to the pleura. There are numerous tests and panels available, but no single test is perfect for distinguishing mesothelioma from carcinoma or even benign versus malignant. The positive markers indicate that mesothelioma is present; if other markers are positive it may indicate another type of cancer, such as breast or lung adenocarcinoma.

Vitamin supplementation was given to most patients in the trial and pemetrexed related side effects were significantly less in patients receiving pemetrexed when they also received daily oral folate 500mcg and intramuscular vitamin B<sub>12</sub> 1000mcg every 9 weeks compared with patients receiving pemetrexed without vitamin supplementation. The objective response rate increased from 20% in the cisplatin group to 46% in the combination pemetrexed group. Some side effects such as nausea and vomiting, [[stomatitis]], and diarrhoea were more common in the combination pemetrexed group but only affected a minority of patients and overall the combination of pemetrexed and cisplatin was well tolerated when patients received vitamin supplementation; both [[quality of life]] and [[lung function tests]] improved in the combination pemetrexed group. In February 2004, the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved pemetrexed for treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma.

Its use greatly increased during [[World War II]]. Since the early 1940s, millions of American workers have been exposed to asbestos dust. Initially, the risks associated with asbestos exposure were not publicly known. However, an increased risk of developing mesothelioma was later found among naval personnel (e.g., Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard), shipyard workers, people who work in asbestos mines and mills, producers of asbestos products, workers in the heating and construction industries, and other tradespeople. Today, the official position of the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) and the U.S. EPA is that protections and \"permissible exposure limits\" required by U.S. regulations, while adequate to prevent most asbestos-related non-malignant disease, are ''not'' adequate to prevent or protect against asbestos-related cancers such as mesothelioma.<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/81-103/pdfs/81-103.pdf NIOSH Working Group Paper from the Centers for Disease Control, 1980] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170618094802/https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/81-103/pdfs/81-103.pdf |date=2017-06-18 }}</ref> Likewise, the British Government's [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) states formally that any threshold for exposure to asbestos must be at a very low level and it is widely agreed that if any such threshold does exist at all, then it cannot currently be quantified.

The processes leading to the development of [[peritoneal mesothelioma]] remain unresolved, although it has been proposed that asbestos fibers from the lung are transported to the abdomen and associated organs via the [[lymphatic system]]. Additionally, asbestos fibers may be deposited in the gut after ingestion of sputum contaminated with asbestos fibers.{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}\n\nPleural contamination with asbestos or other mineral fibers has been shown to cause cancer.

It has been suggested that in humans, transport of fibers to the pleura is critical to the pathogenesis of mesothelioma. This is supported by the observed recruitment of significant numbers of [[macrophage]]s and other cells of the [[immune system]] to localized lesions of accumulated asbestos fibers in the pleural and peritoneal cavities of rats. These lesions continued to attract and accumulate macrophages as the disease progressed, and cellular changes within the lesion culminated in a morphologically malignant tumor.{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}\n\nExperimental evidence suggests that asbestos acts as a complete carcinogen with the development of mesothelioma occurring in sequential stages of initiation and promotion. The molecular mechanisms underlying the malignant transformation of normal mesothelial cells by asbestos fibers remain unclear despite the demonstration of its oncogenic capabilities (see next-but-one paragraph). However, complete in vitro transformation of normal human mesothelial cells to a malignant [[phenotype]] following exposure to asbestos fibers has not yet been achieved. In general, asbestos fibers are thought to act through direct physical interactions with the cells of the mesothelium in conjunction with indirect effects following interaction with inflammatory cells such as macrophages.{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}\n\n===Intracellular===\nAnalysis of the interactions between asbestos fibers and [[DNA]] has shown that phagocytosed fibers are able to make contact with [[chromosome]]s, often adhering to the [[chromatin]] fibers or becoming entangled within the chromosome. This contact between the asbestos fiber and the chromosomes or structural proteins of the spindle apparatus can induce complex abnormalities. The most common abnormality is [[monosomy]] of chromosome 22. Other frequent abnormalities include structural rearrangement of 1p, 3p, 9p and 6q chromosome arms.{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}\n\nCommon gene abnormalities in mesothelioma cell lines include deletion of the [[tumor suppressor gene]]s:{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}\n* [[Neurofibromatosis]] type 2 at 22q12\n* [[p16 (gene)|P16<sup>INK4A</sup>]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chiosea|first1=S|last2=Krasinskas|first2=A|last3=Cagle|first3=PT|last4=Mitchell|first4=KA|last5=Zander|first5=DS|last6=Dacic|first6=S|title=Diagnostic importance of 9p21 homozygous deletion in malignant mesotheliomas|journal=Modern Pathology |date=June 2008|volume=21|issue=6|pages=742\u20137|pmid=18327208|doi=10.1038/modpathol.2008.45|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n* [[p14arf|P14<sup>ARF</sup>]]\n\nAsbestos has also been shown to mediate the entry of foreign DNA into target cells.

Following asbestos phagocytosis, macrophages generate increased amounts of hydroxyl [[radical (chemistry)|radicals]], which are normal by-products of cellular anaerobic metabolism. However, these free radicals are also known [[clastogenic]] (chromosome-breaking) \nand membrane-active agents thought to promote asbestos carcinogenicity. These oxidants can participate in the oncogenic process by directly and indirectly interacting with DNA, modifying membrane-associated cellular events, including oncogene activation and perturbation of cellular antioxidant defences.{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}\n\nAsbestos also may possess [[immunosuppressant|immunosuppressive]] properties. For example, chrysotile fibres have been shown to depress the in vitro proliferation of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes, suppress natural killer cell lysis and significantly reduce [[lymphokine-activated killer cell]] viability and recovery. Furthermore, genetic alterations in asbestos-activated macrophages may result in the release of potent mesothelial cell mitogens such as [[platelet-derived growth factor]] (PDGF) and [[transforming growth factor]]-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) which in turn, may induce the chronic stimulation and proliferation of mesothelial cells after injury by asbestos fibres.{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:MesotheliomaCXR.png|thumb|CXR demonstrating a mesothelioma]]\n[[Image:Tumor Mesothelioma2 legend.jpg|thumb|CT scan of a patient with mesothelioma, [[Coronal plane|coronal section]] (the section follows the plane that divides the body in a front and a back half).

Diagnosis begins with a review of the patient's medical history. A history of exposure to asbestos may increase clinical suspicion for mesothelioma. A physical examination is performed, followed by [[chest X-ray]] and often [[spirometry|lung function tests]]. The X-ray may reveal pleural thickening commonly seen after asbestos exposure and increases suspicion of mesothelioma.<ref name=\"Diffuse\"/> A [[computed tomography|CT]] (or CAT) scan or an [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging|MRI]] is usually performed. If a large amount of fluid is present, abnormal cells may be detected by [[cytopathology]] if this fluid is [[Needle aspiration biopsy|aspirated]] with a syringe.<ref name=Sar2012 /> For pleural fluid, this is done by [[thoracentesis]] or tube thoracostomy ([[chest tube]]); for ascites, with [[paracentesis]] or ascitic drain; and for [[Pericardium|pericardial]] effusion with [[pericardiocentesis]]. While absence of malignant cells on cytology does not completely exclude mesothelioma, it makes it much more unlikely, especially if an alternative diagnosis can be made (e.g., [[tuberculosis]], [[heart failure]]).{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}} However, with primary pericardial mesothelioma, pericardial fluid may not contain malignant cells and a tissue biopsy is more useful in diagnosis.<ref name=Sar2012 /> Using conventional cytology  diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma is difficult, but [[immunohistochemistry]] has greatly enhanced the accuracy of cytology.{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}\n\n===Biopsy===\nGenerally, a [[biopsy]] is needed to confirm a diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. A doctor removes a sample of tissue for examination under a microscope by a [[histopathology|pathologist]]. A biopsy may be done in different ways, depending on where the abnormal area is located. If the cancer is in the chest, the doctor may perform a [[thoracoscopy]]. In this procedure, the doctor makes a small cut through the chest wall and puts a thin, lighted tube called a thoracoscope into the chest between two ribs. Thoracoscopy allows the doctor to look inside the chest and obtain tissue samples. Alternatively, the chest surgeon might directly open the chest ([[thoracotomy]]). If the cancer is in the abdomen, the doctor may perform a [[laparoscopy]]. To obtain tissue for examination, the doctor makes a small incision in the abdomen and inserts a special instrument into the abdominal cavity. If these procedures do not yield enough tissue, an [[open surgery|open surgical procedure]] may be necessary.{{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}\n\n===Immunochemistry===\nImmunohistochemical studies play an important role for the pathologist in differentiating malignant mesothelioma from neoplastic mimics, such as breast or lung cancer that has metastasized to the pleura. There are numerous tests and panels available, but no single test is perfect for distinguishing mesothelioma from carcinoma or even benign versus malignant. The positive markers indicate that mesothelioma is present; if other markers are positive it may indicate another type of cancer, such as breast or lung adenocarcinoma. Calretinin is a particularly important marker in distinguishing mesothelioma from metastatic breast or lung cancer.<ref name=Pan2015 />\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|+'''Typical [[immunohistochemistry]] results'''\n|-\n|style=\"width:300px\"|'''Positive'''\n|style=\"width:300px\"|'''Negative'''\n|-\n|EMA ([[epithelial membrane antigen]]) in a membranous distribution\n|CEA ([[carcinoembryonic antigen]])<ref name=Pan2015 />\n|-\n|[[WT1]] ([[Wilms' tumour]] 1)<ref name=Pan2015 />\n|[[B72.3]]\n|-\n|[[Calretinin]]<ref name=Pan2015 />\n|[[MOC-3 1]]\n|-\n|[[Mesothelin-1|Mesothelin]]<ref name=Pan2015 />\n|[[CD15]]\n|-\n|[[Keratin 5|Cytokeratin 5]]<ref name=Pan2015 />\n|[[Ber-EP4]]\n|-\n|HBME-1 ([[human mesothelial cell 1]])\n|TTF-1 ([[thyroid transcription factor-1]])<ref name=Pan2015 />\n|-\n|[[Podoplanin]] (PDPN)<ref name=Pan2015 />\n|[[Claudin-4]]<ref name=Pan2015 />\n|-\n|[[Osteopontin]]<ref name=Pan2015 />\n|[[Epithelial cell adhesion molecule]] (EpCAM)<ref name=Pan2015 />\n|-\n|\n|[[Estrogen receptor alpha]]<ref name=Pan2015 />\n|-\n|\n|[[Mammaglobin]]<ref name=Pan2015 />\n|}\n\n===Subtypes===\nThere are three main histological subtypes of malignant mesothelioma: epithelioid, sarcomatous, and biphasic.

On March 30, Coffey went to the FBI's St. Paul field office to file a report, including information about the couple's new Hudson sedan parked in the garage behind the apartments. The building was placed under surveillance by two agents, Rufus Coulter and Rusty Nalls, that night, but they saw nothing unusual, mainly because the blinds were drawn.<ref>USA vs May, Frechette, et al., testimony from Coffey and Nalls</ref>\n\nThe next morning at approximately 10:15, Nalls circled around the block looking for the Hudson, but observed nothing. He parked, first on Lincoln Avenue (the north side of the apartments), then on the west side of Lexington Avenue, at the northwest corner of Lexington and Lincoln, and remained in his car while watching Coulter and St. Paul Police detective Henry Cummings, pull up, park, and enter the building.<ref>Dillinger File 62-29777, Nalls report</ref> Ten minutes later, by Nalls's estimate, Van Meter parked a green Ford coupe on the north side of the apartment building.<ref>USA vs. May/Frechette, et al.

She said she was not dressed and to come back. Coulter told her they would wait. After waiting two to three minutes, Coulter went to the basement apartment of the caretakers, Louis and Margaret Meidlinger, and asked to use the phone to call the bureau. He quickly returned to Cummings, and the two of them waited for Frechette to open the door. Van Meter then appeared in the hall and asked Coulter if his name was Johnson. Coulter said it was not, and as Van Meter passed on to the landing of the third floor, Coulter asked him for a name. Van Meter replied, \"I am a soap salesman.\" Asked where his samples were, Van Meter said they were in his car. Coulter asked if he had any credentials. Van Meter said \"no\", and continued down the stairs. Coulter waited 10 to 20 seconds, then followed Van Meter. As Coulter got to the lobby on the ground floor, Van Meter opened fire on him.<ref>USA vs. May/Frechette, Coulter's testimony, pp. 178\u201379</ref> Coulter hastily fled outside, chased by Van Meter. Van Meter ran back into the front entrance.\n\nRecognizing Van Meter, Nalls pointed out the Ford to Coulter and told him to disable it. Coulter shot out the rear left tire. While Coulter stayed with Van Meter's Ford, Nalls went to the corner drugstore and called the local police, then the bureau's St. Paul office, but could not get through because both lines were busy.<ref>Dillinger File, 62-29777, Nalls report</ref><ref>USA vs. May/Frechette, Nalls' testimony, p. 90</ref> Van Meter, meanwhile, escaped by hopping on a passing coal truck.<ref>Girardin/Helmer, p. 134</ref>\n\nFrechette, in her harboring trial testimony, said that she told Dillinger that the police had showed up after speaking to Cummings. Upon hearing Van Meter firing at Coulter, Dillinger opened fire through the door with a Thompson submachine gun, sending Cummings scrambling for cover. Dillinger then stepped out and fired another burst at Cummings. Cummings shot back with a revolver, but quickly ran out of ammunition. He hit Dillinger in the left calf with one of his five shots. He then hastily retreated down the stairs to the front entrance.<ref>USA vs. May/Frechette, et al., Cummings' testimony, pp. 97\u201398</ref> Once Cummings retreated, Dillinger and Frechette hurried down the stairs, exited through the back door and drove away in the Hudson.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe couple drove to Green's apartment in Minneapolis. Green called his associate Dr. Clayton E. May at his office at 712 Masonic Temple in downtown Minneapolis (still extant). With Green, his wife Beth, and Frechette following in Green's car, the doctor drove Dillinger to an apartment belonging to Augusta Salt, who had been providing nursing services and a bed for May's illicit patients for several years, patients he could not risk seeing at his regular office. May treated Dillinger's wound with antiseptics. Green visited Dillinger on Monday, April 2, just hours before Green would be mortally wounded by the FBI in St. Paul. Dillinger convalesced at Dr. May's for five days, until Wednesday, April 4. Dr. May was promised $500 for his services, but received nothing.<ref>Cromie and Pinkston, \"Dillinger: A Short and Violent Life, p. 189</ref><ref>USA vs. May/Frechette, Clayton May's testimony, pp. 473\u201387, 501</ref>\n\n==Return to Mooresville==\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2017}}\nAfter leaving Minneapolis, Dillinger and Billie traveled to Mooresville to visit Dillinger's father. Friday, April 6 was spent contacting family members, particularly his half-brother Hubert Dillinger. On April 6, Hubert and Dillinger left Mooresville at about 8:00&nbsp;p.m. and proceeded to Leipsic, Ohio (approximately 210 miles away), to see Joseph and Lena Pierpont, Harry's parents. The Pierponts were not home, so the two headed back to Mooresville around midnight.<ref name=\"FBI Dillinger File 62-29777\">FBI Dillinger File 62-29777</ref>\n\nOn April 7 at approximately 3:30&nbsp;a.m., they rammed a car driven by Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Manning near [[Noblesville, Indiana]], after Hubert fell asleep behind the wheel. They crashed through a farm fence and about 200 feet into the woods. Both men made it back to the Mooresville farm. Swarms of police showed up at the accident scene within hours. Found in the car were maps, a machine gun magazine, a length of rope, and a bullwhip. According to Hubert, his brother planned to pay a visit with the bullwhip to his former one-armed \"shyster\" lawyer at Crown Point, Joseph Ryan, who had run off with his retainer after being replaced by [[Louis Piquett]]. At about 10:30&nbsp;a.m. on April 7, Billie, Hubert and Hubert's wife purchased a black four-door Ford V8, registering it in the name of Mrs. Fred Penfield (Billie Frechette). At 2:30&nbsp;p.m., Billie and Hubert picked up the V8 and returned to Mooresville.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nOn Sunday, April 8, the Dillingers enjoyed a family picnic while the FBI had the farm under surveillance nearby.<ref name=\"FBI Dillinger File 62-29777\"/> <!--Present at the farm this day along with Dillinger and Billie:\n*John W.

Billie drove the new Ford V8, with two of Dillinger's nieces, Mary Hancock in the front seat and Alberta Hancock in the back. Dillinger was on the floor of the car. He was later seen, but not recognized, by Donegan and Geraghty. Eventually, Norman, driving the V8, proceeded with Dillinger and Billie to Chicago, where they separated from Norman.<ref name=\"FBI Dillinger File 62-29777\"/>\n\nThe following afternoon, Monday, April 9, Dillinger had an appointment at a tavern at 416 North State Street. Sensing trouble, Billie went in first. She was promptly arrested by agents, but refused to reveal Dillinger's whereabouts. Dillinger was waiting in his car outside the tavern and then drove off unnoticed.<ref>Cromie and Pinkston, p. 196</ref> The two would never see each other again.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nDillinger reportedly became despondent after Billie was arrested. The other gang members tried to talk him out of rescuing her, but Van Meter encouraged him by saying that he knew where they could find [[bulletproof vest]]s. That Friday morning, late at night, Dillinger and Van Meter took a hostage, [[Warsaw, Indiana]] police officer Judd Pittenger. They marched Pittenger at gunpoint into the police station, where they stole several more guns and bulletproof vests. After separating, Dillinger picked up Hamilton, who was recovering from the Mason City robbery. The two then traveled to the [[Upper Peninsula]] of [[Michigan]], where they visited Hamilton's sister Anna Steve.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n== Escape at Little Bohemia ==\nThe FBI received a call Sunday morning, April 22 that John Dillinger and several of his confederates were hiding out at a small vacation lodge called [[Little Bohemia Lodge|Little Bohemia]] near present-day [[Manitowish Waters, Wisconsin]].\n\nSpecial Agent in Charge Purvis and FBI agents approached the lodge when three men exited the building and began to drive off. Agents yelled for the car to stop, but the men had been drinking and didn't hear the agents. Agents opened up fire on the car and the driver was killed.\n\nDillinger and some of the gang were upstairs in the lodge and began shooting out the windows. While the FBI agents ducked for cover, Dillinger and his men got out the back of the lodge toward the lake and were able to get out of the area very quietly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/video-repository/newss-lessons-at-little-bohemia/view|title=Lessons at Little Bohemia|website=Federal Bureau of Investigation|language=en-us|access-date=2019-03-23}}</ref>\n\n== Hiding in Chicago ==\nBy July 1934, Dillinger had dropped completely out of sight, and the federal agents had no solid leads to follow. He had, in fact, drifted into Chicago where he went under the alias of Jimmy Lawrence, a petty criminal from Wisconsin who bore a close resemblance to Dillinger. Working as a clerk, Dillinger found that, in a large metropolis like Chicago, he was able to lead an anonymous existence for a while. What he did not realize was that the center of the federal agents' dragnet happened to be Chicago. When the authorities found Dillinger's blood-spattered getaway car on a Chicago side street, they were positive that he was in the city.<ref name=\"fbi\" />\n\nDillinger had always been a fan of the [[Chicago Cubs]], and instead of lying low like many criminals on the run, he attended Cubs games at [[Wrigley Field]] during June and July.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.justonebadcentury.com/chicago_cubs_celebrity_fans_15.asp |title=Chicago Cubs History and News \u2013 Welcome to Just One Bad Century |publisher=Justonebadcentury.com |date=1934-07-22 |accessdate=2012-05-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320062028/http://www.justonebadcentury.com/chicago_cubs_celebrity_fans_15.asp |archivedate=2012-03-20 }}</ref>\nHe is known to have been at Wrigley on Friday, June 8, only to watch his beloved Cubs lose to Cincinnati 4\u20133.

At the end of April, Piquett paid a visit to his old friend Dr. Wilhelm Loeser. Loeser had practiced in Chicago for 27 years before being convicted under the ''Harrison Narcotic Act'' in 1931. He was sentenced to three years at Leavenworth, but was paroled early on December 7, 1932, with Piquett's help.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} He later testified that he performed facial surgery on himself and obliterated the fingerprint impressions on the tips of his fingers by the application of a [[caustic soda]] preparation. Piquett said Dillinger would have to pay $5,000 for the plastic surgery: $4,400 split between Piquett, Loeser and O'Leary, and $600 to Dr. Harold Cassidy, who would administer the anaesthetic. The procedure would take place at the home of Piquett's longtime friend, 67-year-old James Probasco, at the end of May.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nOn May 28, Loeser was picked up at his home at 7:30&nbsp;p.m. by O'Leary and Cassidy. The three of them then drove to Probasco's place. Dillinger chose to have a general anaesthetic. Loeser later testified:\n\n<blockquote>I asked him what work he wanted done. He wanted two warts (moles) removed on the right lower forehead between the eyes and one at the left angle, outer angle of the left eye; wanted a depression of the nose filled in; a scar; a large one to the left of the median line of the upper lip excised, wanted his dimples removed and wanted the angle of the mouth drawn up. He didn't say anything about the fingers that day to me.<ref>Piquett vs USA, Loeser's testimony, pp. 154\u201355</ref></blockquote>\n\nCassidy administered an overdose of [[diethyl ether|ether]], which caused Dillinger to suffocate. He began to turn blue and stopped breathing. Loeser pulled Dillinger's tongue out of his mouth with a pair of forceps, and at the same time forcing both elbows into his ribs. Dillinger gasped and resumed breathing. The procedure continued with only a local anaesthetic. Loeser removed several moles on Dillinger's forehead, made an incision in his nose and an incision in his chin and tied back both cheeks.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nLoeser met with Piquett again on Saturday, June 2, with Piquett saying that more work was needed on Dillinger and that Van Meter now wanted the same work done to him. Also, both now wanted work done on their fingertips. The price for the fingerprint procedure would be $500 per hand or $100 a finger. Loeser used a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acid\u2014commonly known as [[aqua regia]].<ref>Piquett vs USA, Loeser's testimony</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nLoeser met O'Leary the following night at Clark and Wright at 8:30, and they once again drove to Probasco's. Present this evening were Dillinger, Van Meter, Probasco, Piquett, Cassidy, and Peggy Doyle, Probasco's girlfriend. Loeser testified that he worked for only about 30 minutes before O'Leary and Piquett had left.\n\nLoeser testified:\n\n<blockquote>Cassidy and I worked on Dillinger and Van Meter simultaneously on June 3. While the work was being done, Dillinger and Van Meter changed off. The work that could be done while the patient was sitting up, that patient was in the sitting-room. The work that had to be done while the man was lying down, that patient was on the couch in the bedroom. They were changed back and forth according to the work to be done. The hands were sterilized, made aseptic with antiseptics, thoroughly washed with soap and water and used sterile gauze afterwards to keep them clean. Next, cutting instrument, knife was used to expose the lower skin ... in other words, take off the epidermis and expose the derma, then alternately the acid and the alkaloid was applied as was necessary to produce the desired results.<ref>Piquett vs USA, Loeser's testimony, pp. 152\u201362</ref></blockquote>\n\nMinor work was done two nights later, Tuesday, June 5. Loeser made some small corrections first on Van Meter, then Dillinger. Loeser stated:\n\n<blockquote>A man came in before I left, who I found out later was Baby Face Nelson. He came in with a drum of machine gun bullets under his arm, threw them on the bed or the couch in the bedroom, and started to talk to Van Meter. The two then motioned for Dillinger to come over and the three went back into the kitchen.</blockquote>\n\nPeggy Doyle later told agents:\n\n<blockquote>Dillinger and Van Meter resided at Probasco's home until the last week of June 1934; that on some occasions they would be away for a day or two, sometimes leaving separately, and on other occasions together; that at this time Van Meter usually parked his car in the rear of Probasco's residence outside the back fence; that she gathered that Dillinger was keeping company with a young woman who lived on the north side of Chicago, inasmuch as he would state upon leaving Probasco's home that he was going in the direction of Diversey Boulevard; that Van Meter apparently was not acquainted with Dillinger's friend, and she heard him warning Dillinger to be careful about striking up acquaintances with girls he knew nothing about; that Dillinger and Van Meter usually kept a machine gun in an open case under the piano in the parlor; that they also kept a shotgun under the parlor table.<ref>FBI Dillinger File 62-29777, Peggy Doyle statement</ref></blockquote>\n\nO'Leary stated that Dillinger expressed dissatisfaction with the facial work that Loeser had performed on him. O'Leary said that, on another occasion, \"that Probasco told him, 'the son of a bitch has gone out for one of his walks'; that he did not know when he would return; that Probasco raved about the craziness of Dillinger, stating that he was always going for walks and was likely to cause the authorities to locate the place where he was staying; that Probasco stated frankly on this occasion that he was afraid to have the man around.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nAgents arrested Loeser at 1127 South Harvey, Oak Park, Illinois, on Tuesday, July 24. O'Leary returned from a family fishing trip on July 24, the day of Loeser's arrest, and had read in the newspapers that the Department of Justice was looking for two doctors and another man in connection with some plastic work that was done on Dillinger. O'Leary left Chicago immediately, but returned two weeks later, learned that Loeser and others had been arrested, phoned Piquett, who assured him everything was all right, then left again. He returned from St. Louis on August 25 and was promptly taken into custody.<ref>Helmer/Mattix, \"The Complete Public Enemy Almanac\"</ref>\n\nOn Friday, July 27, Jimmy Probasco jumped or \"accidentally\" fell to his death from the 19th floor of the Bankers' Building in Chicago while in custody.

On March 30, Coffey went to the FBI's St. Paul field office to file a report, including information about the couple's new Hudson sedan parked in the garage behind the apartments. The building was placed under surveillance by two agents, Rufus Coulter and Rusty Nalls, that night, but they saw nothing unusual, mainly because the blinds were drawn.<ref>USA vs May, Frechette, et al., testimony from Coffey and Nalls</ref>\n\nThe next morning at approximately 10:15, Nalls circled around the block looking for the Hudson, but observed nothing. He parked, first on Lincoln Avenue (the north side of the apartments), then on the west side of Lexington Avenue, at the northwest corner of Lexington and Lincoln, and remained in his car while watching Coulter and St. Paul Police detective Henry Cummings, pull up, park, and enter the building.<ref>Dillinger File 62-29777, Nalls report</ref> Ten minutes later, by Nalls's estimate, Van Meter parked a green Ford coupe on the north side of the apartment building.<ref>USA vs. May/Frechette, et al.

She said she was not dressed and to come back. Coulter told her they would wait. After waiting two to three minutes, Coulter went to the basement apartment of the caretakers, Louis and Margaret Meidlinger, and asked to use the phone to call the bureau. He quickly returned to Cummings, and the two of them waited for Frechette to open the door. Van Meter then appeared in the hall and asked Coulter if his name was Johnson. Coulter said it was not, and as Van Meter passed on to the landing of the third floor, Coulter asked him for a name. Van Meter replied, \"I am a soap salesman.\" Asked where his samples were, Van Meter said they were in his car. Coulter asked if he had any credentials.

Upon hearing Van Meter firing at Coulter, Dillinger opened fire through the door with a Thompson submachine gun, sending Cummings scrambling for cover. Dillinger then stepped out and fired another burst at Cummings. Cummings shot back with a revolver, but quickly ran out of ammunition. He hit Dillinger in the left calf with one of his five shots.

They crashed through a farm fence and about 200 feet into the woods. Both men made it back to the Mooresville farm. Swarms of police showed up at the accident scene within hours. Found in the car were maps, a machine gun magazine, a length of rope, and a bullwhip. According to Hubert, his brother planned to pay a visit with the bullwhip to his former one-armed \"shyster\" lawyer at Crown Point, Joseph Ryan, who had run off with his retainer after being replaced by [[Louis Piquett]]. At about 10:30&nbsp;a.m. on April 7, Billie, Hubert and Hubert's wife purchased a black four-door Ford V8, registering it in the name of Mrs. Fred Penfield (Billie Frechette).

The other gang members tried to talk him out of rescuing her, but Van Meter encouraged him by saying that he knew where they could find [[bulletproof vest]]s. That Friday morning, late at night, Dillinger and Van Meter took a hostage, [[Warsaw, Indiana]] police officer Judd Pittenger. They marched Pittenger at gunpoint into the police station, where they stole several more guns and bulletproof vests.

At the end of April, Piquett paid a visit to his old friend Dr. Wilhelm Loeser. Loeser had practiced in Chicago for 27 years before being convicted under the ''Harrison Narcotic Act'' in 1931. He was sentenced to three years at Leavenworth, but was paroled early on December 7, 1932, with Piquett's help.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} He later testified that he performed facial surgery on himself and obliterated the fingerprint impressions on the tips of his fingers by the application of a [[caustic soda]] preparation. Piquett said Dillinger would have to pay $5,000 for the plastic surgery: $4,400 split between Piquett, Loeser and O'Leary, and $600 to Dr. Harold Cassidy, who would administer the anaesthetic. The procedure would take place at the home of Piquett's longtime friend, 67-year-old James Probasco, at the end of May.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nOn May 28, Loeser was picked up at his home at 7:30&nbsp;p.m. by O'Leary and Cassidy. The three of them then drove to Probasco's place. Dillinger chose to have a general anaesthetic. Loeser later testified:\n\n<blockquote>I asked him what work he wanted done. He wanted two warts (moles) removed on the right lower forehead between the eyes and one at the left angle, outer angle of the left eye; wanted a depression of the nose filled in; a scar; a large one to the left of the median line of the upper lip excised, wanted his dimples removed and wanted the angle of the mouth drawn up. He didn't say anything about the fingers that day to me.<ref>Piquett vs USA, Loeser's testimony, pp. 154\u201355</ref></blockquote>\n\nCassidy administered an overdose of [[diethyl ether|ether]], which caused Dillinger to suffocate. He began to turn blue and stopped breathing. Loeser pulled Dillinger's tongue out of his mouth with a pair of forceps, and at the same time forcing both elbows into his ribs. Dillinger gasped and resumed breathing. The procedure continued with only a local anaesthetic. Loeser removed several moles on Dillinger's forehead, made an incision in his nose and an incision in his chin and tied back both cheeks.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nLoeser met with Piquett again on Saturday, June 2, with Piquett saying that more work was needed on Dillinger and that Van Meter now wanted the same work done to him. Also, both now wanted work done on their fingertips. The price for the fingerprint procedure would be $500 per hand or $100 a finger. Loeser used a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acid\u2014commonly known as [[aqua regia]].<ref>Piquett vs USA, Loeser's testimony</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nLoeser met O'Leary the following night at Clark and Wright at 8:30, and they once again drove to Probasco's. Present this evening were Dillinger, Van Meter, Probasco, Piquett, Cassidy, and Peggy Doyle, Probasco's girlfriend. Loeser testified that he worked for only about 30 minutes before O'Leary and Piquett had left.\n\nLoeser testified:\n\n<blockquote>Cassidy and I worked on Dillinger and Van Meter simultaneously on June 3. While the work was being done, Dillinger and Van Meter changed off. The work that could be done while the patient was sitting up, that patient was in the sitting-room. The work that had to be done while the man was lying down, that patient was on the couch in the bedroom. They were changed back and forth according to the work to be done. The hands were sterilized, made aseptic with antiseptics, thoroughly washed with soap and water and used sterile gauze afterwards to keep them clean. Next, cutting instrument, knife was used to expose the lower skin ... in other words, take off the epidermis and expose the derma, then alternately the acid and the alkaloid was applied as was necessary to produce the desired results.<ref>Piquett vs USA, Loeser's testimony, pp. 152\u201362</ref></blockquote>\n\nMinor work was done two nights later, Tuesday, June 5. Loeser made some small corrections first on Van Meter, then Dillinger. Loeser stated:\n\n<blockquote>A man came in before I left, who I found out later was Baby Face Nelson.
