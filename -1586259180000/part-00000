Due to the weekly occurrence of this practice, the TTD reared nine of these civets in the Sri Venkateswara dairy farms to easily collect the secretions.

However, growing congestion and the shift of business to new developments outside the city have led to its gradual decline, until the market was torn down and rebuilt in 2017 during the term of Mayor [[Joseph Estrada]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Quinta Market from the Puente Colgante.jpg|left|thumb|250px|A postcard of Quinta Market in 1911, showing the rear of the market facing the [[Pasig River]] from the [[Puente Colgante (Manila)|Puente Colgante]]]]\nQuinta Market was built by the Spanish colonial government in 1851, the same year as the [[Divisoria|Divisoria Market]] in [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]]. Built with money bequeathed to the city government of Manila by businessman and philanthropist [[Francisco Carriedo]] in the 18th century,<ref name=\"salt\" /> its establishment coincided with the growth of industry and trade in the city and the establishment of new public markets to complement existing venues for trade both in the city center and its suburbs.<ref name=\"colgante\" /> At the time, Quiapo was an attractive location for riverside villas along the [[Pasig River]], and this was immortalized in the market's name, which translates to \"country villa\" in Spanish.<ref name=\"riverside\" />\n\nAlso believed to be named after its surrounding countryside, the market originally sold vegetables grown in the farms around Quiapo.{{sfn|Ira|Medina|Ricio|1983|p=81}} The next year, the market was connected to Arroceros in [[Ermita, Manila|Ermita]], where Manila's rice market was located, with the construction of the [[Puente Colgante (Manila)|Puente Colgante]], later replaced by the modern-day [[Quezon Bridge]].<ref name=\"colgante\" /> At the time of its construction, Quinta Market was the most spacious public market in Manila, catering to the wealthy families living in Quiapo at the time,<ref name=\"wealthy\" /> and thanks to its large port area it was also called the city's best market.{{sfn|Camagay|1992|p=95-96}}\n\nThe original market however was shoddily built, and it was heavily damaged by earthquake in 1863, although commercial activity continued despite the destruction.{{sfn|Ram\u00edrez Mart\u00edn|2006|p=45}} The market was rebuilt in 1878 according to plans by F\u00e9lix Rojas,<ref name=\"colgante\" /> the Philippines' first architect. Rojas also prepared plans for the reconstruction of several other structures destroyed in the earthquake, including the [[Santo Domingo Church]] in Intramuros.<ref name=\"santodomingo\" /> Subsequent plans for the market were drawn up on January 18, 1889 by a successor of Rojas, Juan Jos\u00e9 de las Herv\u00e1s.\n\nOn December 8, 1900, at the onset of the [[History of the Philippines (1898\u20131935)|American colonization of the Philippines]], new plans for the market were drawn up by Lieutenant [[Lytle Brown]] of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]], who at the time was detailed as the city engineer of Manila. He oversaw the construction of a new, steel market building,<ref name=\"army\" /> constructed at a cost of [[United States dollar|$]]67,821.29 (around $2.03 million in 2017 dollars), and Quinta Market reopened to the public on October 21, 1901.<ref name=\"espasyo\" /> During this time, the market was a popular wholesale market which was especially busy on Fridays, serving residents of all social classes,<ref name=\"muhon\" /> and certain items like [[beef]] were more available here than at other markets in the city.{{sfn|Doeppers|2016|p=199}} The market's importance was evident in the revenues it was generating for the city government: in 1908, the Quinta and Divisoria markets generated a combined 80 percent of the city's market fee collections.{{sfn|Doeppers|2016|p=229}}\n\nAlthough Quinta Market was known for the wide variety of foodstuffs and other items sold under its roof and in the surrounding area,<ref name=\"lonelyplanet\" /> over the years it had been steadily overshadowed by the opening of new [[department store]]s and other retail concepts opening in [[Makati]] and [[Quezon City]], as well as by the growing congestion in Quiapo caused by overdevelopment.<ref name=\"muhon\" /> By the 2000s, not only did it become just a regular retail market,<ref name=\"muhon\" /> it had also earned a reputation for being damp and filthy, surrounded by stagnant dirty water and ambulant fish vendors selling their wares on the street, to the inconvenience of marketgoers.<ref name=\"quiapo\" /> In 2008, the market was renovated and the area cleaned up in anticipation of a last-minute visit by President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]].<ref name=\"arroyo\" />\n\nDespite improvements to the structure over the years, the market itself was still generally considered to be dilapidated, which prompted the city government of Manila to build an entirely new market.<ref name=\"malaya\" />\n\n===Construction of the Quinta Market and Fishport===\n[[File:WTMP Pangkat B-21-1.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Quinta Market in 2011. In 2015, Manila Mayor [[Joseph Estrada]] had the old market buildings demolished to make way for the new Quinta Market and Fishport.]]\n\nIn 2014, the [[Manila City Council]] passed Ordinance No. 8346, allowing for the city government of Manila to enter into [[joint venture]] agreements with private companies and paving the way for the demolition and rehabilitation of several of the city's public markets. Quinta Market was named as the first market to be demolished and rebuilt under the ordinance.<ref name=\"notraisingfees\" />\n\nThe next year, Mayor [[Joseph Estrada]] announced the construction of a new Quinta Market, to be built at no cost to the city as part of a joint venture with Marketlife Management and Leasing Corporation, which submitted an unsolicited proposal on September 15, 2014.<ref name=\"mb\" /> The agreement between the city government and Marketlife was signed on July 16, 2015,<ref name=\"signing\" /> although the agreement was allegedly approved on October 20, 2014.<ref name=\"mb\" /> Vendors inside the market sued the city government in an attempt to stop the demolition and the joint venture, concerned that they would either be evicted or subjected to higher fees under the scheme,<ref name=\"vendors\" /> as well as concerns that the market was effectively going to be privatized.<ref name=\"demolition\" /> Congressman Amado Bagatsing, who represents the [[Legislative districts of Manila#Fifth District|fifth district of Manila]] and an opponent of the joint venture program, also sided with the vendors, claiming that due process was not followed since Estrada signed the joint venture agreement before the project underwent a public consultation process.<ref name=\"signing\" /> The Manila Regional Trial Court however ruled against the vendors on July 25, 2015, ruling that the city had the right to develop the property \"as an attribute of [its] ownership\".<ref name=\"willnotstop\" />\n\nDemolition of the old Quinta Market took place two days later on July 27, 2015 at 8:00 am [[Philippine Standard Time|PST]],<ref name=\"startdemolition\" /> although over 500 vendors attempted to physically stop the demolition. Estrada later confronted the vendors, chastising those who refused to yield.<ref name=\"demolition\" /> He also reassured vendors that the market was not being privatized,<ref name=\"confrontation\" /> and he promised as well to issue \"[[Title (property)|certificates of tenure]]\" to some 270 affected vendors, which would serve as a guarantee that they would have a place in the new market without being subjected to fee increases.<ref name=\"vendors\" /> However, the following month some vendors filed graft charges against Estrada with the [[Ombudsman of the Philippines|Office of the Ombudsman]], claiming that he awarded the contract to Marketlife without undergoing a bidding process.<ref name=\"graft\" /> In its defense, Marketlife said that while they only have [[Philippine peso|\u20b1]]3.2 million in registered capital with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]]&nbsp;\u2013 the minimum required by law&nbsp;\u2013 they have up to \u20b1200 million allocated for the market's construction from a combination of paid-up capital and bank financing.<ref name=\"defense\" /> They also said that the proposal they submitted underwent due process, claiming that they had consulted vendors when instructed to do so and that the city government took its time in approving its proposal, despite submitting their proposal two months before the company was incorporated.<ref name=\"defense\" />\n\nDuring the new market's construction, vendors were housed in orange steel boxes located around the market site, which would allow them to continue selling while construction was ongoing,<ref name=\"demolition\" /> which was estimated to take around 6\u201310 months.<ref name=\"confrontation\" /> The new market's foundation was finished in November 2015,<ref name=\"mb\" /> and by April 2016, the columns and flooring had been installed in addition to a portion of the new building's roof.<ref name=\"reopening\" /> However, the number of street vendors reportedly grew, out of concerns of high rents, while other vendors in the market have been unable to return.<ref name=\"hataw\" />\n\nOn April 19, 2017, Estrada's 80th birthday, the \u20b1150 million Quinta Market and Fishport was inaugurated and reopened to the public&nbsp;\u2013 the fifth market to be renovated under the city's market renovation program.<ref name=\"inauguration\" /> Some 250 vendors reopened their stalls with the market's reopening.<ref name=\"renovated\" />\n\n==Structure and management==\n[[File:0621jfQuinta Market Ahlan Wassahlan Muslim Town Welcome Arch Quiapo Manilafvf 26.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A fish vendor at the new Quinta Market and Fishport]]\n\nThe Quinta Market and Fishport is a two-storey structure, fulfilling Estrada's vision of a \"modern, convenient and mall-like public market\". Replacing the previous market building built in neoclassical style,<ref name=\"dailygrind\" /> the ground floor houses the market itself,<ref name=\"look\" /> which has a capacity of 360 stalls,<ref name=\"vendors\" /> while a 100-slot [[parking garage]] occupies the second floor.<ref name=\"renovated\" /> Among the new amenities built into the new building are separate sections for dry and wet goods, air-conditioned [[Public toilet|restrooms]] equipped with [[bidet shower]]s and stainless steel fixtures,<ref name=\"toilet\" /> a [[food court]], a [[closed-circuit television]] system and free public [[Wi-Fi]].<ref name=\"look\" /> The building also has provisions for enclosed standalone establishments, with the Quinta Market branch of [[Jollibee]] opening on December 4, 2017.<ref name=\"jollibee\" />\n\nOn December 8, 2017, the city government opened the market's new vegetable section, selling vegetables brought straight from farms in [[Benguet]]. Inaugurated by Estrada along with Benguet governor Crecenscio Pacalso,<ref name=\"tribune\" /> the section ultimately aims to bring down the cost of vegetables sold in the city.<ref name=\"vegetables\" />\n\nIncorporated into the structure's rear is a fish port, which would allow the market to directly receive fresh seafood from [[Navotas]] and produce from other parts of the country,<ref name=\"produce\" /> as well as a ferry terminal. Constructed with the assistance of the [[Philippine Ports Authority]], the ferry terminal's construction is expected to help decongest [[Quezon Boulevard]] and surrounding roads with the impending revival of the [[Pasig River Ferry Service]].<ref name=\"malaya\" />\n\nAlthough Quinta Market is owned by the City of Manila, it is run by Marketlife under the terms of their joint venture agreement. In exchange for running the market for 25 years, the market's revenues are split between the two, with Marketlife keeping 80 percent of revenues and the remaining 20 percent remitted to the city government.<ref name=\"defense\" /> Revenues are primarily generated through stall rental fees, with the original rental fee being \u20b115\u201330 per square meter per day. On September 4, 2017, despite promising not to do so,<ref name=\"notraisingfees\" /> the city government increased rental fees to between \u20b130 and \u20b180 per square meter depending on stall size.<ref name=\"feestostay\" /> The increases in rental fees were criticized by vendors as being too high, although the city defended the increases by justifying that the increases were modest compared to what Marketlife actually wanted,<ref name=\"feestostay\" /> with the company asking for rental rates as much as 300 percent higher, or as high as \u20b167.25 per square meter.<ref name=\"300percent\" />\n\n==Vendors and stalls==\n[[File:WTMP Team Waka Waka B-21.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Informal street vendors in front of the old Quinta Market in 2011. In 2017, hundreds of these vendors were cleared from the market by the Manila city government.]]\nQuinta Market is currently home to 279 registered vendors, all of whom were also registered vendors at the old market at the time it was torn down.<ref name=\"bandila\" /> Their interests are represented by the Quinta Public Market Development Cooperative (QPMDC),<ref name=\"journal\" /> also known as the Quinta Stallholders Association.<ref name=\"stallholders\" />\n\nScandal arose in August 2017 when an organization called the United Vendors Alliance (UVA) alleged that a business [[mafia]] was monopolizing trade at the market, protected by officials in the city government.<ref name=\"vendorprotest\" /> According to the allegations, 26 families reportedly owned 146 stalls which were turned over to other vendors after paying the syndicate additional fees,<ref name=\"mb-mafia\" /> despite the city's Market Code mandating that a family can only own one stall at a time.<ref name=\"mafia\" /> They also alleged that the 26 families were not even resident in the City of Manila, and that their arrangement prevented other vendors from getting places in the market,<ref name=\"vendorprotest\" /> thus forcing them to sell on the street.<ref name=\"mb-mafia\" /> A member of the [[Manila City Council]] named by the UVA as a protector of the mafia strongly denied the allegations,<ref name=\"councilor\" /> while the QPDMC denied that there even was a mafia operating in the market to begin with, going so far as claiming that the UVA's president wasn't even a registered vendor there.<ref name=\"stallholders\" /> Estrada, for his part, promised to investigate the matter.<ref name=\"mb-mafia\" />\n\nInformal vendors often congregate around Quinta Market, with vendors occupying as much as half of Carlos Palanca Street,<ref name=\"chanco\" /> in the process causing heavy traffic.<ref name=\"eagle-opinion\" /> In September 2017, the Manila city government undertook a series of cleanup operations that led to the departure of hundreds of informal vendors from the market's perimeter.<ref name=\"cleanup\" />\n\n===Notable establishments and patrons===\n[[File:Pastora Special Palabok.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Pastora Special Palabok, identified by the ''[[Manila Bulletin]]'' in 2014 as having the best ''pancit palabok'' in Manila.]]\nAs a commercial hub, Quinta Market is strongly connected with Filipino cuisine and the Manila food culture. In its heyday, the market was seen as a pleasant place to dine at,<ref name=\"eating\" /> and shoppers would patronize the many ''carinderias'' (food stalls) inside, known for their ''[[pancit]]'', ''[[menudo (stew)|menudo]]'', ''[[puto]]'' and ''[[dinuguan]]''.<ref name=\"heyday\" /> The market is also known for its ''[[halo-halo]]'',<ref name=\"eating\" /> and it is believed that the dessert was invented here as an innovation on the Japanese ''[[mitsumame]]'' in the 1920s or 1930s.<ref name=\"zialcita\" /> Some of the ''carinderias'' have become notable in their own right: in 2014, the ''[[Manila Bulletin]]'' identified Pastora Special Palabok as having the best ''[[pancit#Luglug and Palabok|pancit palabok]]'' in Manila,<ref name=\"palabok\" /> while Edna's Eatery, known for its ''nilagang baka'', was featured on the [[GMA Network]] morning show ''[[Unang Hirit]]''.<ref name=\"unanghirit\" />\n\nQuinta Market has also been linked to the origins of a number of Philippine culinary and cultural personalities. R. Lapid's, the Philippines' largest ''[[chicharr\u00f3n|chicharon]]'' chain, first started selling their signature product at the family meat stall of the chain's founder inside the market,<ref name=\"chicharon\" /> while the father of radio host Ruel \"Ahwel\" Paz was also a vendor at the market in the 1980s.<ref name=\"father\" /> Restaurateur [[Engracia Cruz-Reyes]], founder of Filipino restaurant The Aristocrat, regularly visited the market, as did her daughter Teresita, who became known for the [[Mama Sita's Holding Company|Mama Sita's]] line of food products.<ref name=\"aristocrat\" /> Other regular visitors to the market included restaurateurs Anastacio de Alba, former cook of the [[Casino Espa\u00f1ol de Manila]] and founder of Spanish restaurants Alba and El Espa\u00f1ol,<ref name=\"alba\" /> and Nenuca Benitez, founder of the Filipino-Spanish restaurant Mario's in [[Baguio]].<ref name=\"marios\" />\n\nThe area around Quinta Market is likewise home to several stores and stalls selling everything from furniture to clothing. Beside the market is the shopping area known as \"''Ilalim ng Tulay''\" (\"under the bridge\"), so called because of its location underneath the Quezon Bridge. Known for its very cheap prices,<ref name=\"cheaper\" /> the stores here sell mostly wood products, furniture and Philippine [[handicraft]]s sourced from all over the country,<ref name=\"angelwings\" /> as well as souvenirs for tourists.<ref name=\"lonelyplanet\" /> College students who purchase items from this area often call the place \"''Ils de Tuls''\" or \"''Ile de Toule''\", [[francization|francisizing]] the name to make their purchases sound more sophisticated,<ref name=\"ilsdetuls\" /> although the name has since become mainstream among those who frequent the area.<ref name=\"realliving\" /> Facing the market along Carlos Palanca Street meanwhile are stores selling costumes and props.<ref name=\"angelwings\" />\n\n==References and bibliography==\n===References===\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"salt\">{{cite journal | author=Salt, Alexander E.W. | title=Francisco de Carriedo y Peredo | work=Philippine Journal of Science | volume=VIII | pages=165\u2013214 | year=1913 | url=http://bhl-china.org/bhldatas/pdfs/p/philippinejourna81913phi.pdf | issn=0031-7683 | access-date=February 3, 2018 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204004943/http://bhl-china.org/bhldatas/pdfs/p/philippinejourna81913phi.pdf | archivedate=February 4, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"riverside\">{{cite book | author=Andrade Jr., Pio | author2=Zialcita, Fernando N. | editor=Zialcita, Fernando N. | title=Quiapo: Heart of Manila | chapter=The Future of a Unique Configuration | page=329 | year=2006 | place=Manila | publisher=Quiapo Printing | isbn=978-971-93673-0-7 | quote=The district's former attractiveness as a location for riverside villas is memorialized by the name of its riverside market, ''\"Quinta\"'', meaning \"country villa\".}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"colgante\">{{cite web | title=Markets and factories | url=http://www.aenet.org/manila-expo/page22.htm | work=Discovering Philippines \u2013 Spanish Archives | accessdate=January 26, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041121225608/http://www.aenet.org/manila-expo/page22.htm | archive-date=November 21, 2004 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"wealthy\">{{cite conference | author=Brillantes-Silvestre, Ma.

called the '''Quinta Market and Fishport''' since 2017, is a ''[[palengke]]'' ([[public market]]) on Carlos Palanca (formerly Echague) Street in [[Quiapo, Manila|Quiapo]], [[Manila]], in the [[Philippines]], along the banks of the [[Pasig River]].\n\nEstablished in the 19th century during the [[History of the Philippines (1521\u20131898)|Spanish colonial period]], Quinta Market was the central market of the City of Manila, originally catering to the wealthy families that lived in Quiapo at the time. By the early 20th century, the market had become one of the city's most important markets, generating significant revenues while also catering to residents of all social classes. However, growing congestion and the shift of business to new developments outside the city have led to its gradual decline, until the market was torn down and rebuilt in 2017 during the term of Mayor [[Joseph Estrada]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Quinta Market from the Puente Colgante.jpg|left|thumb|250px|A postcard of Quinta Market in 1911, showing the rear of the market facing the [[Pasig River]] from the [[Puente Colgante (Manila)|Puente Colgante]]]]\nQuinta Market was built by the Spanish colonial government in 1851, the same year as the [[Divisoria|Divisoria Market]] in [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]]. Built with money bequeathed to the city government of Manila by businessman and philanthropist [[Francisco Carriedo]] in the 18th century,<ref name=\"salt\" /> its establishment coincided with the growth of industry and trade in the city and the establishment of new public markets to complement existing venues for trade both in the city center and its suburbs.<ref name=\"colgante\" /> At the time, Quiapo was an attractive location for riverside villas along the [[Pasig River]], and this was immortalized in the market's name, which translates to \"country villa\" in Spanish.<ref name=\"riverside\" />\n\nAlso believed to be named after its surrounding countryside, the market originally sold vegetables grown in the farms around Quiapo.{{sfn|Ira|Medina|Ricio|1983|p=81}} The next year, the market was connected to Arroceros in [[Ermita, Manila|Ermita]], where Manila's rice market was located, with the construction of the [[Puente Colgante (Manila)|Puente Colgante]], later replaced by the modern-day [[Quezon Bridge]].<ref name=\"colgante\" /> At the time of its construction, Quinta Market was the most spacious public market in Manila, catering to the wealthy families living in Quiapo at the time,<ref name=\"wealthy\" /> and thanks to its large port area it was also called the city's best market.{{sfn|Camagay|1992|p=95-96}}\n\nThe original market however was shoddily built, and it was heavily damaged by earthquake in 1863, although commercial activity continued despite the destruction.{{sfn|Ram\u00edrez Mart\u00edn|2006|p=45}} The market was rebuilt in 1878 according to plans by F\u00e9lix Rojas,<ref name=\"colgante\" /> the Philippines' first architect. Rojas also prepared plans for the reconstruction of several other structures destroyed in the earthquake, including the [[Santo Domingo Church]] in Intramuros.<ref name=\"santodomingo\" /> Subsequent plans for the market were drawn up on January 18, 1889 by a successor of Rojas, Juan Jos\u00e9 de las Herv\u00e1s.\n\nOn December 8, 1900, at the onset of the [[History of the Philippines (1898\u20131935)|American colonization of the Philippines]], new plans for the market were drawn up by Lieutenant [[Lytle Brown]] of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]], who at the time was detailed as the city engineer of Manila. He oversaw the construction of a new, steel market building,<ref name=\"army\" /> constructed at a cost of [[United States dollar|$]]67,821.29 (around $2.03 million in 2017 dollars), and Quinta Market reopened to the public on October 21, 1901.<ref name=\"espasyo\" /> During this time, the market was a popular wholesale market which was especially busy on Fridays, serving residents of all social classes,<ref name=\"muhon\" /> and certain items like [[beef]] were more available here than at other markets in the city.{{sfn|Doeppers|2016|p=199}} The market's importance was evident in the revenues it was generating for the city government: in 1908, the Quinta and Divisoria markets generated a combined 80 percent of the city's market fee collections.{{sfn|Doeppers|2016|p=229}}\n\nAlthough Quinta Market was known for the wide variety of foodstuffs and other items sold under its roof and in the surrounding area,<ref name=\"lonelyplanet\" /> over the years it had been steadily overshadowed by the opening of new [[department store]]s and other retail concepts opening in [[Makati]] and [[Quezon City]], as well as by the growing congestion in Quiapo caused by overdevelopment.<ref name=\"muhon\" /> By the 2000s, not only did it become just a regular retail market,<ref name=\"muhon\" /> it had also earned a reputation for being damp and filthy, surrounded by stagnant dirty water and ambulant fish vendors selling their wares on the street, to the inconvenience of marketgoers.<ref name=\"quiapo\" /> In 2008, the market was renovated and the area cleaned up in anticipation of a last-minute visit by President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]].<ref name=\"arroyo\" />\n\nDespite improvements to the structure over the years, the market itself was still generally considered to be dilapidated, which prompted the city government of Manila to build an entirely new market.<ref name=\"malaya\" />\n\n===Construction of the Quinta Market and Fishport===\n[[File:WTMP Pangkat B-21-1.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Quinta Market in 2011. In 2015, Manila Mayor [[Joseph Estrada]] had the old market buildings demolished to make way for the new Quinta Market and Fishport.]]\n\nIn 2014, the [[Manila City Council]] passed Ordinance No. 8346, allowing for the city government of Manila to enter into [[joint venture]] agreements with private companies and paving the way for the demolition and rehabilitation of several of the city's public markets. Quinta Market was named as the first market to be demolished and rebuilt under the ordinance.<ref name=\"notraisingfees\" />\n\nThe next year, Mayor [[Joseph Estrada]] announced the construction of a new Quinta Market, to be built at no cost to the city as part of a joint venture with Marketlife Management and Leasing Corporation, which submitted an unsolicited proposal on September 15, 2014.<ref name=\"mb\" /> The agreement between the city government and Marketlife was signed on July 16, 2015,<ref name=\"signing\" /> although the agreement was allegedly approved on October 20, 2014.<ref name=\"mb\" /> Vendors inside the market sued the city government in an attempt to stop the demolition and the joint venture, concerned that they would either be evicted or subjected to higher fees under the scheme,<ref name=\"vendors\" /> as well as concerns that the market was effectively going to be privatized.<ref name=\"demolition\" /> Congressman Amado Bagatsing, who represents the [[Legislative districts of Manila#Fifth District|fifth district of Manila]] and an opponent of the joint venture program, also sided with the vendors, claiming that due process was not followed since Estrada signed the joint venture agreement before the project underwent a public consultation process.<ref name=\"signing\" /> The Manila Regional Trial Court however ruled against the vendors on July 25, 2015, ruling that the city had the right to develop the property \"as an attribute of [its] ownership\".<ref name=\"willnotstop\" />\n\nDemolition of the old Quinta Market took place two days later on July 27, 2015 at 8:00 am [[Philippine Standard Time|PST]],<ref name=\"startdemolition\" /> although over 500 vendors attempted to physically stop the demolition. Estrada later confronted the vendors, chastising those who refused to yield.<ref name=\"demolition\" /> He also reassured vendors that the market was not being privatized,<ref name=\"confrontation\" /> and he promised as well to issue \"[[Title (property)|certificates of tenure]]\" to some 270 affected vendors, which would serve as a guarantee that they would have a place in the new market without being subjected to fee increases.<ref name=\"vendors\" /> However, the following month some vendors filed graft charges against Estrada with the [[Ombudsman of the Philippines|Office of the Ombudsman]], claiming that he awarded the contract to Marketlife without undergoing a bidding process.<ref name=\"graft\" /> In its defense, Marketlife said that while they only have [[Philippine peso|\u20b1]]3.2 million in registered capital with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]]&nbsp;\u2013 the minimum required by law&nbsp;\u2013 they have up to \u20b1200 million allocated for the market's construction from a combination of paid-up capital and bank financing.<ref name=\"defense\" /> They also said that the proposal they submitted underwent due process, claiming that they had consulted vendors when instructed to do so and that the city government took its time in approving its proposal, despite submitting their proposal two months before the company was incorporated.<ref name=\"defense\" />\n\nDuring the new market's construction, vendors were housed in orange steel boxes located around the market site, which would allow them to continue selling while construction was ongoing,<ref name=\"demolition\" /> which was estimated to take around 6\u201310 months.<ref name=\"confrontation\" /> The new market's foundation was finished in November 2015,<ref name=\"mb\" /> and by April 2016, the columns and flooring had been installed in addition to a portion of the new building's roof.<ref name=\"reopening\" /> However, the number of street vendors reportedly grew, out of concerns of high rents, while other vendors in the market have been unable to return.<ref name=\"hataw\" />\n\nOn April 19, 2017, Estrada's 80th birthday, the \u20b1150 million Quinta Market and Fishport was inaugurated and reopened to the public&nbsp;\u2013 the fifth market to be renovated under the city's market renovation program.<ref name=\"inauguration\" /> Some 250 vendors reopened their stalls with the market's reopening.<ref name=\"renovated\" />\n\n==Structure and management==\n[[File:0621jfQuinta Market Ahlan Wassahlan Muslim Town Welcome Arch Quiapo Manilafvf 26.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A fish vendor at the new Quinta Market and Fishport]]\n\nThe Quinta Market and Fishport is a two-storey structure, fulfilling Estrada's vision of a \"modern, convenient and mall-like public market\". Replacing the previous market building built in neoclassical style,<ref name=\"dailygrind\" /> the ground floor houses the market itself,<ref name=\"look\" /> which has a capacity of 360 stalls,<ref name=\"vendors\" /> while a 100-slot [[parking garage]] occupies the second floor.<ref name=\"renovated\" /> Among the new amenities built into the new building are separate sections for dry and wet goods, air-conditioned [[Public toilet|restrooms]] equipped with [[bidet shower]]s and stainless steel fixtures,<ref name=\"toilet\" /> a [[food court]], a [[closed-circuit television]] system and free public [[Wi-Fi]].<ref name=\"look\" /> The building also has provisions for enclosed standalone establishments, with the Quinta Market branch of [[Jollibee]] opening on December 4, 2017.<ref name=\"jollibee\" />\n\nOn December 8, 2017, the city government opened the market's new vegetable section, selling vegetables brought straight from farms in [[Benguet]]. Inaugurated by Estrada along with Benguet governor Crecenscio Pacalso,<ref name=\"tribune\" /> the section ultimately aims to bring down the cost of vegetables sold in the city.<ref name=\"vegetables\" />\n\nIncorporated into the structure's rear is a fish port, which would allow the market to directly receive fresh seafood from [[Navotas]] and produce from other parts of the country,<ref name=\"produce\" /> as well as a ferry terminal. Constructed with the assistance of the [[Philippine Ports Authority]], the ferry terminal's construction is expected to help decongest [[Quezon Boulevard]] and surrounding roads with the impending revival of the [[Pasig River Ferry Service]].<ref name=\"malaya\" />\n\nAlthough Quinta Market is owned by the City of Manila, it is run by Marketlife under the terms of their joint venture agreement. In exchange for running the market for 25 years, the market's revenues are split between the two, with Marketlife keeping 80 percent of revenues and the remaining 20 percent remitted to the city government.<ref name=\"defense\" /> Revenues are primarily generated through stall rental fees, with the original rental fee being \u20b115\u201330 per square meter per day. On September 4, 2017, despite promising not to do so,<ref name=\"notraisingfees\" /> the city government increased rental fees to between \u20b130 and \u20b180 per square meter depending on stall size.<ref name=\"feestostay\" /> The increases in rental fees were criticized by vendors as being too high, although the city defended the increases by justifying that the increases were modest compared to what Marketlife actually wanted,<ref name=\"feestostay\" /> with the company asking for rental rates as much as 300 percent higher, or as high as \u20b167.25 per square meter.<ref name=\"300percent\" />\n\n==Vendors and stalls==\n[[File:WTMP Team Waka Waka B-21.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Informal street vendors in front of the old Quinta Market in 2011. In 2017, hundreds of these vendors were cleared from the market by the Manila city government.]]\nQuinta Market is currently home to 279 registered vendors, all of whom were also registered vendors at the old market at the time it was torn down.<ref name=\"bandila\" /> Their interests are represented by the Quinta Public Market Development Cooperative (QPMDC),<ref name=\"journal\" /> also known as the Quinta Stallholders Association.<ref name=\"stallholders\" />\n\nScandal arose in August 2017 when an organization called the United Vendors Alliance (UVA) alleged that a business [[mafia]] was monopolizing trade at the market, protected by officials in the city government.<ref name=\"vendorprotest\" /> According to the allegations, 26 families reportedly owned 146 stalls which were turned over to other vendors after paying the syndicate additional fees,<ref name=\"mb-mafia\" /> despite the city's Market Code mandating that a family can only own one stall at a time.<ref name=\"mafia\" /> They also alleged that the 26 families were not even resident in the City of Manila, and that their arrangement prevented other vendors from getting places in the market,<ref name=\"vendorprotest\" /> thus forcing them to sell on the street.<ref name=\"mb-mafia\" /> A member of the [[Manila City Council]] named by the UVA as a protector of the mafia strongly denied the allegations,<ref name=\"councilor\" /> while the QPDMC denied that there even was a mafia operating in the market to begin with, going so far as claiming that the UVA's president wasn't even a registered vendor there.<ref name=\"stallholders\" /> Estrada, for his part, promised to investigate the matter.<ref name=\"mb-mafia\" />\n\nInformal vendors often congregate around Quinta Market, with vendors occupying as much as half of Carlos Palanca Street,<ref name=\"chanco\" /> in the process causing heavy traffic.<ref name=\"eagle-opinion\" /> In September 2017, the Manila city government undertook a series of cleanup operations that led to the departure of hundreds of informal vendors from the market's perimeter.<ref name=\"cleanup\" />\n\n===Notable establishments and patrons===\n[[File:Pastora Special Palabok.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Pastora Special Palabok, identified by the ''[[Manila Bulletin]]'' in 2014 as having the best ''pancit palabok'' in Manila.]]\nAs a commercial hub, Quinta Market is strongly connected with Filipino cuisine and the Manila food culture. In its heyday, the market was seen as a pleasant place to dine at,<ref name=\"eating\" /> and shoppers would patronize the many ''carinderias'' (food stalls) inside, known for their ''[[pancit]]'', ''[[menudo (stew)|menudo]]'', ''[[puto]]'' and ''[[dinuguan]]''.<ref name=\"heyday\" /> The market is also known for its ''[[halo-halo]]'',<ref name=\"eating\" /> and it is believed that the dessert was invented here as an innovation on the Japanese ''[[mitsumame]]'' in the 1920s or 1930s.<ref name=\"zialcita\" /> Some of the ''carinderias'' have become notable in their own right: in 2014, the ''[[Manila Bulletin]]'' identified Pastora Special Palabok as having the best ''[[pancit#Luglug and Palabok|pancit palabok]]'' in Manila,<ref name=\"palabok\" /> while Edna's Eatery, known for its ''nilagang baka'', was featured on the [[GMA Network]] morning show ''[[Unang Hirit]]''.<ref name=\"unanghirit\" />\n\nQuinta Market has also been linked to the origins of a number of Philippine culinary and cultural personalities. R. Lapid's, the Philippines' largest ''[[chicharr\u00f3n|chicharon]]'' chain, first started selling their signature product at the family meat stall of the chain's founder inside the market,<ref name=\"chicharon\" /> while the father of radio host Ruel \"Ahwel\" Paz was also a vendor at the market in the 1980s.<ref name=\"father\" /> Restaurateur [[Engracia Cruz-Reyes]], founder of Filipino restaurant The Aristocrat, regularly visited the market, as did her daughter Teresita, who became known for the [[Mama Sita's Holding Company|Mama Sita's]] line of food products.<ref name=\"aristocrat\" /> Other regular visitors to the market included restaurateurs Anastacio de Alba, former cook of the [[Casino Espa\u00f1ol de Manila]] and founder of Spanish restaurants Alba and El Espa\u00f1ol,<ref name=\"alba\" /> and Nenuca Benitez, founder of the Filipino-Spanish restaurant Mario's in [[Baguio]].<ref name=\"marios\" />\n\nThe area around Quinta Market is likewise home to several stores and stalls selling everything from furniture to clothing. Beside the market is the shopping area known as \"''Ilalim ng Tulay''\" (\"under the bridge\"), so called because of its location underneath the Quezon Bridge. Known for its very cheap prices,<ref name=\"cheaper\" /> the stores here sell mostly wood products, furniture and Philippine [[handicraft]]s sourced from all over the country,<ref name=\"angelwings\" /> as well as souvenirs for tourists.<ref name=\"lonelyplanet\" /> College students who purchase items from this area often call the place \"''Ils de Tuls''\" or \"''Ile de Toule''\", [[francization|francisizing]] the name to make their purchases sound more sophisticated,<ref name=\"ilsdetuls\" /> although the name has since become mainstream among those who frequent the area.<ref name=\"realliving\" /> Facing the market along Carlos Palanca Street meanwhile are stores selling costumes and props.<ref name=\"angelwings\" />\n\n==References and bibliography==\n===References===\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"salt\">{{cite journal | author=Salt, Alexander E.W. | title=Francisco de Carriedo y Peredo | work=Philippine Journal of Science | volume=VIII | pages=165\u2013214 | year=1913 | url=http://bhl-china.org/bhldatas/pdfs/p/philippinejourna81913phi.pdf | issn=0031-7683 | access-date=February 3, 2018 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204004943/http://bhl-china.org/bhldatas/pdfs/p/philippinejourna81913phi.pdf | archivedate=February 4, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"riverside\">{{cite book | author=Andrade Jr., Pio | author2=Zialcita, Fernando N. | editor=Zialcita, Fernando N. | title=Quiapo: Heart of Manila | chapter=The Future of a Unique Configuration | page=329 | year=2006 | place=Manila | publisher=Quiapo Printing | isbn=978-971-93673-0-7 | quote=The district's former attractiveness as a location for riverside villas is memorialized by the name of its riverside market, ''\"Quinta\"'', meaning \"country villa\".}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"colgante\">{{cite web | title=Markets and factories | url=http://www.aenet.org/manila-expo/page22.htm | work=Discovering Philippines \u2013 Spanish Archives | accessdate=January 26, 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041121225608/http://www.aenet.org/manila-expo/page22.htm | archive-date=November 21, 2004 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"wealthy\">{{cite conference | author=Brillantes-Silvestre, Ma.
