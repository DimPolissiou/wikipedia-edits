It was closed after roughly a decade of operation. After abortive discussions with [[Sarah Lawrence College]] to relocate the women's college to Princeton and merge it with the University in 1967, the administration decided to admit women and turned to the issue of transforming the school's operations and facilities into a female-friendly campus. The administration had barely finished these plans in April 1969 when the admissions office began mailing out its acceptance letters. Its five-year coeducation plan provided $7.8 million for the development of new facilities that would eventually house and educate 650 women students at Princeton by 1974. Ultimately, 148 women, consisting of 100 freshmen and transfer students of other years, entered Princeton on September 6, 1969 amidst much media attention. Princeton enrolled its first female graduate student, Sabra Follett Meservey, as a PhD candidate in [[Turkish history]] in 1961.

Like most of Princeton's Gothic buildings, they predate the residential college system and were fashioned into colleges from individual dormitories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hres.princeton.edu/undergraduate-housing/explore/rockefeller-college|title= Rockefeller College|website=hres.princeton.edu|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hres.princeton.edu/undergraduate-housing/explore/mathey-college|title= Mathey College|website=hres.princeton.edu|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n\nWilson and Butler, located south of the center of the campus, were built in the 1960s. Wilson served as an early experiment in the establishment of the residential college system. Butler, like Rockefeller and Mathey, consisted of a collection of ordinary dorms (called the \"New New Quad\") before the addition of a dining hall made it a residential college. Widely disliked for their edgy modernist design, including \"waffle ceilings,\" the dormitories on the Butler Quad were demolished in 2007. Butler is now reopened as a four-year residential college, housing both [[Upperclassman|under- and upperclassmen]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hres.princeton.edu/undergraduate-housing/explore/butler-college|title= Butler College|website=hres.princeton.edu|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n\nForbes is located on the site of the historic Princeton Inn, a gracious hotel overlooking the Princeton golf course. The Princeton Inn, originally constructed in 1924, played regular host to important symposia and gatherings of renowned scholars from both the university and the nearby [[Institute for Advanced Study]] for many years.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Cite book|title = A Princeton Companion|last = Leitch|first = Alexander|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 1978|isbn = 9780691046549|location = Princeton, New Jersey|chapter = West, Andrew Fleming|oclc = 4193433|chapter-url = http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/west_andrew.html}}</ref> Forbes currently houses nearly 500 undergraduates in its residential halls.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hres.princeton.edu/undergraduate-housing/explore/forbes-college|title= Forbes College|website=hres.princeton.edu|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, Princeton broke ground for a sixth college named [[Whitman College, Princeton University|Whitman College]] after its principal sponsor, [[Meg Whitman]], who graduated from Princeton in 1977. The new dormitories were constructed in the [[Collegiate Gothic]] architectural style and were designed by architect [[Demetri Porphyrios]]. Construction finished in 2007, and Whitman College was inaugurated as Princeton's sixth residential college that same year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whitmancollege.princeton.edu/about|title=About {{!}} Whitman College|website=whitmancollege.princeton.edu|access-date=2020-01-12}}</ref>\n\nThe precursor of the present college system in America was originally proposed by university president Woodrow Wilson in the early 20th century. For over 800 years, however, the collegiate system had already existed in Britain at Cambridge and Oxford Universities. Wilson's model was much closer to Yale's present system, which features four-year colleges. Lacking the support of the [[Trustees of Princeton University|trustees]], the plan languished until 1968. That year, Wilson College was established to cap a series of alternatives to the eating clubs. Fierce debates raged before the present residential college system emerged. The plan was first attempted at Yale, but the administration was initially uninterested; an exasperated alum, [[Edward Harkness]], finally paid to have the college system implemented at Harvard in the 1920s, leading to the oft-quoted aphorism that the college system is a Princeton idea that was executed at Harvard with funding from Yale.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Benjamin |last=Sacks |title=Harvard's \"Constructed Utopia\" and the Culture of Deception: The Expansion toward the Charles River, 1902-1932 |journal = The New England Quarterly|volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=286\u2013317 | date= June 2011 |doi=10.1162/TNEQ_a_00090 }}</ref>\n\nPrinceton has one graduate residential college, known simply as the Graduate College, located beyond Forbes College at the outskirts of campus. The far-flung location of the GC was the spoil of a squabble between Woodrow Wilson and then-Graduate School Dean [[Andrew Fleming West]]. Wilson preferred a central location for the College; West wanted the graduate students as far as possible from the campus. Ultimately, West prevailed.<ref name = \"autogenerated1\" /> The Graduate College is composed of a large [[Collegiate Gothic]] section crowned by [[Cleveland Tower]], a local landmark that also houses a world-class [[carillon]].

A.B. candidates must also fulfill a three or four semester foreign language requirement and distribution requirements (which include, for example, classes in ethics, literature and the arts, and historical analysis) with a total of 31 classes. B.S.E. candidates follow a parallel track with an emphasis on a rigorous science and math curriculum, a computer science requirement, and at least two semesters of independent research including an optional senior thesis. All B.S.E. students must complete at least 36 classes. A.B. candidates typically have more freedom in course selection than B.S.E. candidates because of the fewer number of required classes. Nonetheless, in the spirit of a [[liberal arts]] education, both enjoy a comparatively high degree of latitude in creating a self-structured curriculum.\n\nUndergraduates agree to adhere to an academic integrity policy called the Honor Code, established in 1893.

The actual dormitories are comparable, but only residential colleges have dining halls. Nonetheless, any undergraduate may purchase a meal plan and eat in a residential college dining hall. Recently, upperclassmen have been given the option of remaining in their college for all four years. Juniors and seniors also have the option of living off-campus, but high rent in the Princeton area encourages almost all students to live in university housing. Undergraduate social life revolves around the residential colleges and a number of coeducational [[Eating club (Princeton University)|eating clubs]], which students may choose to join in the spring of their sophomore year. Eating clubs, which are not officially affiliated with the university, serve as dining halls and communal spaces for their members and also host social events throughout the academic year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Eating Clubs |url=https://admission.princeton.edu/campus-life/dining-options/eating-clubs |website=Princeton University Undergraduate Admission |publisher=Princeton University |accessdate=14 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nPrinceton's six residential colleges host a variety of social events and activities, guest speakers, and trips. The residential colleges also sponsor trips to New York for undergraduates to see ballets, operas, Broadway shows, sports events, and other activities.\nThe eating clubs, located on Prospect Avenue, are co-ed organizations for upperclassmen. Most upperclassmen eat their meals at one of the eleven eating clubs.

This decline prompted ''[[The Daily Princetonian]]'' to write a series of articles on the decline and its reasons. Caroline C.

In 1887, the university actually maintained and staffed a [[sister college]], [[Evelyn College for Women]], in the town of Princeton on Evelyn and Nassau streets. It was closed after roughly a decade of operation. After abortive discussions with [[Sarah Lawrence College]] to relocate the women's college to Princeton and merge it with the University in 1967, the administration decided to admit women and turned to the issue of transforming the school's operations and facilities into a female-friendly campus. The administration had barely finished these plans in April 1969 when the admissions office began mailing out its acceptance letters. Its five-year coeducation plan provided $7.8 million for the development of new facilities that would eventually house and educate 650 women students at Princeton by 1974. Ultimately, 148 women, consisting of 100 freshmen and transfer students of other years, entered Princeton on September 6, 1969 amidst much media attention. Princeton enrolled its first female graduate student, Sabra Follett Meservey, as a PhD candidate in [[Turkish history]] in 1961.

Two colleges, [[Wilson College, Princeton University|Wilson College]] and [[Forbes College, Princeton University|Forbes College]] (formerly Princeton Inn College), date to the 1970s; three others, [[Rockefeller College|Rockefeller]], [[Mathey College|Mathey]], and [[Butler College|Butler]] Colleges, were created in 1983 following the Committee on Undergraduate Residential Life (CURL) report, which suggested the institution of residential colleges as a solution to an allegedly fragmented campus social life. The construction of [[Whitman College, Princeton University|Whitman College]], the university's sixth residential college, was completed in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |title=About |url=https://whitmancollege.princeton.edu/about |website=Whitman College |publisher=Princeton University Office of the Dean of the College |accessdate=14 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nRockefeller and Mathey are located in the northwest corner of the campus; Princeton brochures often feature their Collegiate Gothic architecture. Like most of Princeton's Gothic buildings, they predate the residential college system and were fashioned into colleges from individual dormitories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hres.princeton.edu/undergraduate-housing/explore/rockefeller-college|title= Rockefeller College|website=hres.princeton.edu|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hres.princeton.edu/undergraduate-housing/explore/mathey-college|title= Mathey College|website=hres.princeton.edu|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n\nWilson and Butler, located south of the center of the campus, were built in the 1960s. Wilson served as an early experiment in the establishment of the residential college system. Butler, like Rockefeller and Mathey, consisted of a collection of ordinary dorms (called the \"New New Quad\") before the addition of a dining hall made it a residential college. Widely disliked for their edgy modernist design, including \"waffle ceilings,\" the dormitories on the Butler Quad were demolished in 2007. Butler is now reopened as a four-year residential college, housing both [[Upperclassman|under- and upperclassmen]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hres.princeton.edu/undergraduate-housing/explore/butler-college|title= Butler College|website=hres.princeton.edu|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n\nForbes is located on the site of the historic Princeton Inn, a gracious hotel overlooking the Princeton golf course.

The new dormitories were constructed in the [[Collegiate Gothic]] architectural style and were designed by architect [[Demetri Porphyrios]]. Construction finished in 2007, and Whitman College was inaugurated as Princeton's sixth residential college that same year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whitmancollege.princeton.edu/about|title=About {{!}} Whitman College|website=whitmancollege.princeton.edu|access-date=2020-01-12}}</ref>\n\nThe precursor of the present college system in America was originally proposed by university president Woodrow Wilson in the early 20th century. For over 800 years, however, the collegiate system had already existed in Britain at Cambridge and Oxford Universities. Wilson's model was much closer to Yale's present system, which features four-year colleges. Lacking the support of the [[Trustees of Princeton University|trustees]], the plan languished until 1968. That year, Wilson College was established to cap a series of alternatives to the eating clubs. Fierce debates raged before the present residential college system emerged. The plan was first attempted at Yale, but the administration was initially uninterested; an exasperated alum, [[Edward Harkness]], finally paid to have the college system implemented at Harvard in the 1920s, leading to the oft-quoted aphorism that the college system is a Princeton idea that was executed at Harvard with funding from Yale.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Benjamin |last=Sacks |title=Harvard's \"Constructed Utopia\" and the Culture of Deception: The Expansion toward the Charles River, 1902-1932 |journal = The New England Quarterly|volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=286\u2013317 | date= June 2011 |doi=10.1162/TNEQ_a_00090 }}</ref>\n\nPrinceton has one graduate residential college, known simply as the Graduate College, located beyond Forbes College at the outskirts of campus.

Ultimately, West prevailed.<ref name = \"autogenerated1\" /> The Graduate College is composed of a large [[Collegiate Gothic]] section crowned by [[Cleveland Tower]], a local landmark that also houses a world-class [[carillon]].

A.B. candidates must also fulfill a three or four semester foreign language requirement and distribution requirements (which include, for example, classes in ethics, literature and the arts, and historical analysis) with a total of 31 classes. B.S.E. candidates follow a parallel track with an emphasis on a rigorous science and math curriculum, a computer science requirement, and at least two semesters of independent research including an optional senior thesis. All B.S.E. students must complete at least 36 classes. A.B. candidates typically have more freedom in course selection than B.S.E. candidates because of the fewer number of required classes. Nonetheless, in the spirit of a [[liberal arts]] education, both enjoy a comparatively high degree of latitude in creating a self-structured curriculum.\n\nUndergraduates agree to adhere to an academic integrity policy called the Honor Code, established in 1893. Under the Honor Code, faculty do not proctor examinations; instead, the students proctor one another and must report any suspected violation to an Honor Committee made up of undergraduates. The Committee investigates reported violations and holds a hearing if it is warranted. An acquittal at such a hearing results in the destruction of all records of the hearing; a conviction results in the student's suspension or expulsion.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.princeton.edu/honor/about_us/|title = About Us|publisher = Princeton University|accessdate = October 19, 2015|at = Role of Honor Committee|website = Honor Committee|date = May 19, 2015}}</ref> The signed pledge required by the Honor Code is so integral to students' academic experience that the [[Princeton Triangle Club]] performs a song about it each fall.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.princeton.edu/studentguide/academics_101/honor_code/|title = Honor Code|publisher = Princeton University|accessdate = June 1, 2011 |website = The Student Guide to Princeton|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100615074938/http://www.princeton.edu/studentguide/academics_101/honor_code/|archivedate = June 15, 2010}} </ref><ref>{{Cite AV media|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vNf_W6wE68|title = Honor Code|type = YouTube video|year = 2008|others = music and lyrics by Peter Mills|access-date = October 23, 2015}}</ref> Out-of-class exercises fall under the jurisdiction of the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.princeton.edu/odus/standards/discipline/|title = Committee on Discipline|publisher = Princeton University|accessdate = October 23, 2015|website = ODUS: Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students|date = August 25, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151103152504/http://www.princeton.edu/odus/standards/discipline/|archive-date = November 3, 2015|url-status = dead|df = mdy-all}}</ref> Undergraduates are expected to sign a pledge on their written work affirming that they have not [[Plagiarism|plagiarized]] the work.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.princeton.edu/pr/pub/integrity/pages/sources/|title = Acknowledging Your Sources|publisher = Princeton University|accessdate = October 23, 2015|date = August 2011|website = Academic Integrity}}</ref>\n\n====Admissions and financial aid====\n{| style=\"float:right; font-size:85%; margin:10px\" \"text-align:center; font-size:85%; margin:auto;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ ''Fall first-year statistics''\n|-\n! &nbsp;\n!2017<ref name = C2021>{{cite web |title=Common Data Set 2017-2018 |url=https://registrar.princeton.edu/sites/g/files/toruqf136/files/2019-02/common_cds_2017-2018.pdf |website=Princeton University |accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref>!! 2016<ref>{{cite web |title=Common Data Set 2016-2017 |url=https://registrar.princeton.edu/sites/g/files/toruqf136/files/2019-02/CDS_2016-2017.pdf |website=Princeton University |accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref> !! 2015<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://registrar.princeton.edu/university_enrollment_sta/CDS2015-16.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 31, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220224736/https://registrar.princeton.edu/university_enrollment_sta/CDS2015-16.pdf |archive-date=December 20, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>!! 2014<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://registrar.princeton.edu/university_enrollment_sta/common_cds2014.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 31, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310212829/https://registrar.princeton.edu/university_enrollment_sta/common_cds2014.pdf |archive-date=March 10, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>!! 2013<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://registrar.princeton.edu/university_enrollment_sta/common_cds2013.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 31, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220224758/https://registrar.princeton.edu/university_enrollment_sta/common_cds2013.pdf |archive-date=December 20, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

He left the program for the film industry, starring in films such as ''[[Taxi (2004 film)|Taxi]]'' (2004) and ''[[Fever Pitch (2005 film)|Fever Pitch]]'' (2005).\n\nFollowing his film career, Fallon returned to television as the host of ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' on NBC studios in 2009, where he became well known for his emphasis on music and video games. He moved from that program to become the sixth permanent host of the long-running ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' in 2014. In addition to his television work, Fallon has released two comedy albums and five books.\n\n==Early life==\nJames Thomas Fallon was born on September 19, 1974, in the [[Bay Ridge, Brooklyn|Bay Ridge]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn, New York]], the son of Gloria (''n\u00e9e'' Feeley; 1949\u20132017) and James W.

Thomas Fallon''' (born September 19, 1974) is an American comedian, actor, television host, writer, and producer. He is known for his work in television as a [[cast member]] on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and as the host of [[late-night talk show]] ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]'' and before that ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]''. He grew up with an interest in comedy and music, moving to [[Los Angeles]] at 21 to pursue opportunities in [[stand-up comedy]].\n\nHe was commissioned to join [[NBC]]'s ''Saturday Night Live'' as a cast member in 1998, fulfilling a lifelong dream. Fallon remained on ''SNL'' for six years between 1998 and 2004, co-hosting the program's ''[[Weekend Update]]'' segment and becoming a celebrity in the process. He left the program for the film industry, starring in films such as ''[[Taxi (2004 film)|Taxi]]'' (2004) and ''[[Fever Pitch (2005 film)|Fever Pitch]]'' (2005).\n\nFollowing his film career, Fallon returned to television as the host of ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' on NBC studios in 2009, where he became well known for his emphasis on music and video games. He moved from that program to become the sixth permanent host of the long-running ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' in 2014.

For example, in one scenario, the first-generation computer program found able to broadly match the effectiveness of an AI researcher is able to rewrite its algorithms and double its speed or capabilities in six months. The second-generation program is expected to take three calendar months to perform a similar chunk of work, on average; in practice, doubling its own capabilities may take longer if it experiences a mini-\"AI winter\", or may be quicker if it undergoes a miniature \"AI Spring\" where ideas from the previous generation are especially easy to mutate into the next generation. In this scenario the time for each generation continues to shrink, and the system undergoes an unprecedentedly large number of generations of improvement in a short time interval, jumping from subhuman performance in many areas to superhuman performance in all relevant areas.<ref name=\"aima\"/><ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\"/> More broadly, examples like arithmetic and [[Go (game)|Go]] show that progress from human-level AI to superhuman ability is sometimes extremely rapid.<ref name=skeptic/>\n\n==History==\nOne of the earliest authors to express serious concern that highly advanced machines might pose existential risks to humanity was the novelist [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], who wrote the following in his 1863 essay ''[[Darwin among the Machines]]'':<ref>Breuer, Hans-Peter. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/436868 'Samuel Butler's \"the Book of the Machines\" and the Argument from Design.'] Modern Philology, Vol. 72, No. 4 (May 1975), pp. 365\u2013383</ref> \n{{quote|The upshot is simply a question of time, but that the time will come when the machines will hold the real supremacy over the world and its inhabitants is what no person of a truly philosophic mind can for a moment question.}}\nIn 1951, computer scientist [[Alan Turing]] wrote an article titled ''Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory'', in which he proposed that artificial general intelligences would likely \"take control\" of the world as they became more intelligent than human beings:\n{{quote|Let us now assume, for the sake of argument, that [intelligent] machines are a genuine possibility, and look at the consequences of constructing them... There would be no question of the machines dying, and they would be able to converse with each other to sharpen their wits. At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control, in the way that is mentioned in Samuel Butler\u2019s \u201cErewhon\u201d.<ref name=\"oxfordjournals\">A M Turing, ''[http://philmat.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/3/256.full.pdf Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory]'', 1951, reprinted ''Philosophia Mathematica'' (1996) 4(3): 256\u2013260 {{doi|10.1093/philmat/4.3.256}}</ref>}}\n\nFinally, in 1965, [[I. J. Good]] originated the concept now known as an \"intelligence explosion\"; he also stated that the risks were underappreciated:<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hilliard |first1=Mark |title=The AI apocalypse: will the human race soon be terminated? |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/innovation/the-ai-apocalypse-will-the-human-race-soon-be-terminated-1.3019220 |accessdate=15 March 2020 |work=The Irish Times |date=2017 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an 'intelligence explosion', and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control.

Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean \"minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model\" or \"maximize the number of reward clicks\"; however, they do not know how to write a utility function for \"maximize human flourishing\", nor is it currently clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists. Furthermore, a utility function that expresses some values but not others will tend to trample over the values not reflected by the utility function.<ref>Yudkowsky, E. (2011, August).

If a machine is created and given the sole purpose to enumerate the decimals of <math> \\pi</math>, then no moral and ethical rules will stop it from achieving its programmed goal by any means necessary. The machine may utilize all physical and informational resources it can to find every decimal of pi that can be found.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies|last = Bostrom|first = Nick|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0-19-967811-2|location = Oxford, United Kingdom|pages = 116}}</ref> Bostrom warns against anthropomorphism: a human will set out to accomplish his projects in a manner that humans consider \"reasonable\", while an artificial intelligence may hold no regard for its existence or for the welfare of humans around it, and may instead only care about the completion of the task.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.nickbostrom.com/superintelligentwill.pdf|title = Superintelligent Will|date = 2012|accessdate = 2015-10-29|website = Nick Bostrom|publisher = Nick Bostrom|last = Bostrom|first = Nick}}</ref>\n\nWhile the orthogonality thesis follows logically from even the weakest sort of philosophical \"[[is-ought distinction]]\", Stuart Armstrong argues that even if there somehow exist moral facts that are provable by any \"rational\" agent, the orthogonality thesis still holds: it would still be possible to create a non-philosophical \"optimizing machine\" capable of making decisions to strive towards some narrow goal, but that has no incentive to discover any \"moral facts\" that would get in the way of goal completion.<ref name=armstrong/>\n\nOne argument for the orthogonality thesis is that some AI designs appear to have orthogonality built into them; in such a design, changing a fundamentally friendly AI into a fundamentally unfriendly AI can be as simple as prepending a {{nowrap|minus (\"-\") sign}} onto its utility function. A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences if the orthogonality thesis were false. If the orthogonality thesis is false, there exists some simple but \"unethical\" goal G such that there cannot exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G. This means if a human society were highly motivated (perhaps at gunpoint) to design an efficient real-world algorithm with goal G, and were given a million years to do so along with huge amounts of resources, training and knowledge about AI, it must fail; that there cannot exist any pattern of [[reinforcement learning]] that would train a highly efficient real-world intelligence to follow the goal G; and that there cannot exist any evolutionary or environmental pressures that would evolve highly efficient real-world intelligences following goal G.<ref name=armstrong>Armstrong, Stuart. \"General purpose intelligence: arguing the orthogonality thesis.\" Analysis and Metaphysics 12 (2013).</ref>\n\nSome dissenters, like [[Michael Chorost]] (writing in [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]), argue instead that \"by the time (the AI) is in a position to imagine tiling the Earth with solar panels, it'll know that it would be morally wrong to do so.\" Chorost argues that \"a (dangerous) A.I. will need to desire certain states and dislike others... Today's software lacks that ability\u2014and computer scientists have not a clue how to get it there. Without wanting, there's no impetus to do anything.

Outside of the artificial intelligence field, \"intelligence\" is often used in a normatively thick manner that connotes moral wisdom or acceptance of agreeable forms of moral reasoning. At an extreme, if morality is part of the definition of intelligence, then by definition a superintelligent machine would behave morally. However, in the field of artificial intelligence research, while \"intelligence\" has many overlapping definitions, none of them make reference to morality. Instead, almost all current \"artificial intelligence\" research focuses on creating algorithms that \"optimize\", in an empirical way, the achievement of an arbitrary goal.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" />\n\nTo avoid anthropomorphism or the baggage of the word \"intelligence\", an advanced artificial intelligence can be thought of as an impersonal \"optimizing process\" that strictly takes whatever actions are judged most likely to accomplish its (possibly complicated and implicit) goals.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /> Another way of conceptualizing an advanced artificial intelligence is to imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximization of its goal function; this choice is then outputted, regardless of any extraneous ethical concerns.<ref>Waser, Mark. \"Rational Universal Benevolence: Simpler, Safer, and Wiser Than 'Friendly AI'.\" Artificial General Intelligence.

This is fictitious [[anthropomorphism]]: in reality, while an artificial intelligence could perhaps be deliberately programmed with human emotions, or could develop something similar to an emotion as a means to an ultimate goal ''if'' it is useful to do so, it would not spontaneously develop human emotions for no purpose whatsoever, as portrayed in fiction.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" />\n\nScholars sometimes claim that others' predictions about an AI's behavior are illogical anthropomorphism.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" /> An example that might initially be considered anthropomorphism, but is in fact a logical statement about AI behavior, would be the [[Dario Floreano]] experiments where certain robots spontaneously evolved a crude capacity for \"deception\", and tricked other robots into eating \"poison\" and dying: here a trait, \"deception\", ordinarily associated with people rather than with machines, spontaneously evolves in a type of [[convergent evolution]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Real-Life Decepticons: Robots Learn to Cheat|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/08/real-life-decepticons-robots-learn-to-cheat/|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=18 August 2009}}</ref> According to Paul R. Cohen and [[Edward Feigenbaum]], in order to differentiate between anthropomorphization and logical prediction of AI behavior, \"the trick is to know enough about how humans and computers think to say ''exactly'' what they have in common, and, when we lack this knowledge, to use the comparison to ''suggest'' theories of human thinking or computer thinking.\"<ref>Cohen, Paul R., and Edward A.

The second-generation program is expected to take three calendar months to perform a similar chunk of work, on average; in practice, doubling its own capabilities may take longer if it experiences a mini-\"AI winter\", or may be quicker if it undergoes a miniature \"AI Spring\" where ideas from the previous generation are especially easy to mutate into the next generation. In this scenario the time for each generation continues to shrink, and the system undergoes an unprecedentedly large number of generations of improvement in a short time interval, jumping from subhuman performance in many areas to superhuman performance in all relevant areas.<ref name=\"aima\"/><ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\"/> More broadly, examples like arithmetic and [[Go (game)|Go]] show that progress from human-level AI to superhuman ability is sometimes extremely rapid.<ref name=skeptic/>\n\n==History==\nOne of the earliest authors to express serious concern that highly advanced machines might pose existential risks to humanity was the novelist [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], who wrote the following in his 1863 essay ''[[Darwin among the Machines]]'':<ref>Breuer, Hans-Peter.

Once in charge, the superintelligence will have little incentive to allow humans to run around free and consume resources that the superintelligence could instead use for building itself additional protective systems \"just to be on the safe side\" or for building additional computers to help it calculate how to best accomplish its goals.<ref name=\"aima\"/><ref name=\"vanity\" /><ref name=omohundro/>\n\nThus, the argument concludes, it is likely that someday an intelligence explosion will catch humanity unprepared, and that such an unprepared-for intelligence explosion may result in human extinction or a comparable fate.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /><!-- preface -->\n\n=== Possible scenarios ===\n{{further|Artificial intelligence in fiction}}\n\nSome scholars have proposed [[scenario planning|hypothetical scenarios]] intended to concretely illustrate some of their concerns.\n\nFor example, Bostrom in ''Superintelligence'' expresses concern that even if the timeline for superintelligence turns out to be predictable, researchers might not take sufficient safety precautions, in part because: {{cquote|It could be the case that when dumb, smarter is safe; yet when smart, smarter is more dangerous}} Bostrom suggests a scenario where, over decades, AI becomes more powerful. Widespread deployment is initially marred by occasional accidents \u2014 a driverless bus swerves into the oncoming lane, or a military drone fires into an innocent crowd. Many activists call for tighter oversight and regulation, and some even predict impending catastrophe. But as development continues, the activists are proven wrong. As automotive AI becomes smarter, it suffers fewer accidents; as military robots achieve more precise targeting, they cause less collateral damage. Based on the data, scholars infer a broad lesson \u2014 the smarter the AI, the safer it is: {{cquote|It is a lesson based on science, data, and statistics, not armchair philosophizing.

For safety, the team keeps the AI [[AI box|in a box]] where it is mostly unable to communicate with the outside world, and tasks it to flood the market through shell companies, first with [[Amazon Turk]] tasks and then with producing animated films and TV shows. While the public is aware that the lifelike animation is computer-generated, the team keeps secret that the high-quality direction and voice-acting are also mostly computer-generated, apart from a few third-world contractors unknowingly employed as decoys; the team's low overhead and high output effectively make it the world's largest media empire. Faced with a cloud computing bottleneck, the team also tasks the AI with designing (among other engineering tasks) a more efficient datacenter and other custom hardware, which they mainly keep for themselves to avoid competition. Other shell companies make blockbuster biotech drugs and other inventions, investing profits back into the AI. The team next tasks the AI with [[astroturfing]] an army of pseudonymous citizen journalists and commentators, in order to gain political influence to use \"for the greater good\" to prevent wars.

The utility function is a mathematical algorithm resulting in a single objectively-defined answer, not an English statement. Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean \"minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model\" or \"maximize the number of reward clicks\"; however, they do not know how to write a utility function for \"maximize human flourishing\", nor is it currently clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists. Furthermore, a utility function that expresses some values but not others will tend to trample over the values not reflected by the utility function.<ref>Yudkowsky, E. (2011, August). Complex value systems in friendly AI. In International Conference on Artificial General Intelligence (pp. 388-393). Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg.</ref> AI researcher [[Stuart J.

Here, quality refers to the expected outcome [[utility]] of actions taken, where the utility function is, presumably, specified by the human designer.

However, Nick Bostrom's \"orthogonality thesis\" argues against this, and instead states that, with some technical caveats, more or less any level of \"intelligence\" or \"optimization power\" can be combined with more or less any ultimate goal. If a machine is created and given the sole purpose to enumerate the decimals of <math> \\pi</math>, then no moral and ethical rules will stop it from achieving its programmed goal by any means necessary.

A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences if the orthogonality thesis were false. If the orthogonality thesis is false, there exists some simple but \"unethical\" goal G such that there cannot exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G. This means if a human society were highly motivated (perhaps at gunpoint) to design an efficient real-world algorithm with goal G, and were given a million years to do so along with huge amounts of resources, training and knowledge about AI, it must fail; that there cannot exist any pattern of [[reinforcement learning]] that would train a highly efficient real-world intelligence to follow the goal G; and that there cannot exist any evolutionary or environmental pressures that would evolve highly efficient real-world intelligences following goal G.<ref name=armstrong>Armstrong, Stuart. \"General purpose intelligence: arguing the orthogonality thesis.\" Analysis and Metaphysics 12 (2013).</ref>\n\nSome dissenters, like [[Michael Chorost]] (writing in [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]), argue instead that \"by the time (the AI) is in a position to imagine tiling the Earth with solar panels, it'll know that it would be morally wrong to do so.\" Chorost argues that \"a (dangerous) A.I. will need to desire certain states and dislike others...

Outside of the artificial intelligence field, \"intelligence\" is often used in a normatively thick manner that connotes moral wisdom or acceptance of agreeable forms of moral reasoning. At an extreme, if morality is part of the definition of intelligence, then by definition a superintelligent machine would behave morally. However, in the field of artificial intelligence research, while \"intelligence\" has many overlapping definitions, none of them make reference to morality. Instead, almost all current \"artificial intelligence\" research focuses on creating algorithms that \"optimize\", in an empirical way, the achievement of an arbitrary goal.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" />\n\nTo avoid anthropomorphism or the baggage of the word \"intelligence\", an advanced artificial intelligence can be thought of as an impersonal \"optimizing process\" that strictly takes whatever actions are judged most likely to accomplish its (possibly complicated and implicit) goals.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /> Another way of conceptualizing an advanced artificial intelligence is to imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximization of its goal function; this choice is then outputted, regardless of any extraneous ethical concerns.<ref>Waser, Mark. \"Rational Universal Benevolence: Simpler, Safer, and Wiser Than 'Friendly AI'.\" Artificial General Intelligence.

It takes forever. That, in the past, has been bad but not something which represented a fundamental risk to the existence of civilisation.\" Musk states the first step would be for the government to gain \"insight\" into the actual status of current research, warning that \"Once there is awareness, people will be extremely afraid... As they should be.\" In response, politicians express skepticism about the wisdom of regulating a technology that's still in development.<ref>{{cite news|title=Elon Musk Warns Governors: Artificial Intelligence Poses 'Existential Risk'|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/17/537686649/elon-musk-warns-governors-artificial-intelligence-poses-existential-risk|accessdate=27 November 2017|work=NPR.org|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Gibbs|first1=Samuel|title=Elon Musk: regulate AI to combat 'existential threat' before it's too late|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/17/elon-musk-regulation-ai-combat-existential-threat-tesla-spacex-ceo|accessdate=27 November 2017|work=The Guardian|date=17 July 2017}}</ref><ref name=cnbc>{{cite news|last1=Kharpal|first1=Arjun|title=A.I. is in its 'infancy' and it's too early to regulate it, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich says|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/07/ai-infancy-and-too-early-to-regulate-intel-ceo-brian-krzanich-says.html|accessdate=27 November 2017|work=CNBC|date=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nResponding both to Musk and to February 2017 proposals by European Union lawmakers to regulate AI and robotics, Intel CEO [[Brian Krzanich]] argues that artificial intelligence is in its infancy and that it is too early to regulate the technology.<ref name=cnbc/> Instead of trying to regulate the technology itself, some scholars suggest to rather develop common norms including requirements for the testing and transparency of algorithms, possibly in combination with some form of warranty.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2018.08.004|title=Siri, Siri, in my hand: Who's the fairest in the land?
