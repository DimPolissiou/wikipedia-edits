Lee]] against [[Major General (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[George G. Meade]]'s [[Union Army|Union]] positions on July 3, 1863, the last day of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in the state of [[Pennsylvania]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Its futility was predicted by the charge's commander, [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[James Longstreet]], and it was arguably an avoidable mistake from which the [[Confederate States of America|Southern]] war effort never fully recovered militarily or psychologically. The farthest point reached by the attack has been referred to as the [[high-water mark of the Confederacy]].\n\nThe charge is named after Maj. Gen. [[George Pickett]], one of three Confederate generals who led the assault under Longstreet.\n\nPickett's Charge was part of Lee's \"general plan\"<ref>War of the Rebellion: Official Records (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1889), Volume 27, Series I, Part 2, p. 320</ref> to take Cemetery Hill and the network of roads it commanded. His military secretary, [[Armistead Lindsay Long]], described Lee's thinking:\n<blockquote>There was&nbsp;... a weak point&nbsp;... where [Cemetery Ridge], sloping westward, formed the depression through which the Emmitsburg road passes. Perceiving that by forcing the Federal lines at that point and turning toward Cemetery Hill [Hays' Division] would be taken in flank and the remainder would be neutralized.&nbsp;... Lee determined to attack at that point, and the execution was assigned to Longstreet.<ref>A. L. Long. ''Memoirs of Robert E. Lee: His Military and Personal History''. (London: Sampson, Low, Marston, Seale and Rivington, 1886), pp. 287\u2013288.</ref></blockquote> \nOn the night of July 2, Meade correctly predicted to General Gibbon, after a [[council of war]], that Lee would attack the center of his lines the following morning.\n\nThe infantry assault was preceded by a massive artillery bombardment that was meant to soften up the Union defense and silence its artillery, but was largely ineffective. Approximately 12,500 men in nine infantry brigades advanced over open fields for three-quarters of a mile under heavy Union artillery and rifle fire. Although some Confederates were able to breach the low stone wall that shielded many of the Union defenders, they could not maintain their hold and were repelled with over 50% casualties, a decisive defeat that ended the three-day battle and Lee's campaign into [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>Pfanz, pp. 44\u201352.</ref>\n\nYears later, when asked why his charge at Gettysburg failed, Pickett reportedly replied, \"I've always thought the [[Yankee]]s had something to do with it.\"<ref>Boritt, p. 19.</ref><ref name=\"Savas\">{{cite book|last1=Savas|first1=Theodore P.|last2=Woodbury|first2=David A.|title=The Campaign For Atlanta & Sherman's March to the Sea, Volume 1|date=2013|publisher=Savas Publishing|isbn=9781940669052|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WGhpAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT91&dq=%22I%27ve+always+thought+the+Yankees+had+something+to+do+with+it.%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjVmL6l6oHVAhVMaT4KHfmUCBoQ6AEIQTAF#v=onepage&q=%22I%27ve%20always%20thought%20the%20Yankees%20had%20something%20to%20do%20with%20it.%22&f=false|accessdate=11 July 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n===Military situation===\n{{Main|Gettysburg Campaign|Battle of Gettysburg|Battle of Gettysburg, First Day|Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day}}\n{{further|Gettysburg Battlefield}}\n\n==Opposing forces==\n===Union===\n{{further|Gettysburg Union order of battle}}\n\n===Confederate===\n{{further|Gettysburg Confederate order of battle}}\n\n==Plans and command structures==\nPickett's Charge was planned for three Confederate [[division (military)|division]]s, commanded by [[Major General (CSA)|Maj. Gen.]] [[George Pickett]], [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brig. Gen.]] [[J. Johnston Pettigrew]], and Maj. Gen. [[Isaac R. Trimble]], consisting of troops from [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[James Longstreet]]'s First Corps and Lt. Gen. [[A. P. Hill]]'s Third Corps. Pettigrew commanded brigades from Maj. Gen. [[Henry Heth]]'s old division, under [[Colonel|Col.]] [[Birkett D. Fry]] (Archer's Brigade), Col. [[James K. Marshall]] (Pettigrew's Brigade), Brig. Gen. [[Joseph R. Davis]], and Col. [[John M. Brockenbrough]]. Trimble, commanding Maj. Gen. [[William Dorsey Pender|Dorsey Pender]]'s division, had the brigades of Brig. Gens. [[Alfred M. Scales]] (temporarily commanded by Col. [[William Lee J. Lowrance]]) and [[James Henry Lane (Confederate general)|James H. Lane]]. Two brigades from Maj. Gen. [[Richard H. Anderson]]'s division (Hill's Corps) were to support the attack on the right flank: Brig. Gen. [[Cadmus M. Wilcox]] and Col. [[David Lang (colonel)|David Lang]] ([[Edward A. Perry|Perry's]] brigade).<ref name=E544>Eicher, pp. 544\u2013546.</ref>\n\nThe target of the Confederate assault was the center of the Union [[Army of the Potomac]]'s [[II Corps (Union Army)|II Corps]], commanded by Maj. Gen. [[Winfield S. Hancock]]. Directly in the center was the division of Brig. Gen. [[John Gibbon]] with the brigades of Brig. Gen. [[William Harrow]], Col. [[Norman J. Hall]], and Brig. Gen. [[Alexander S. Webb]]. (On the night of July 2, Meade correctly predicted to Gibbon at a [[council of war]] that Lee would try an attack on Gibbon's sector the following morning.)<ref>Sears, p. 345.</ref> To the north of this position were brigades from the division of Brig. Gen. [[Alexander Hays]], and to the south was Maj. Gen. [[Abner Doubleday]]'s division of the [[I Corps (Union Army)|I Corps]], including the [[2nd Vermont Brigade]] of Brig. Gen. [[George J. Stannard]] and the [[121st Pennsylvania Regiment|121st Pennsylvania]] under the command of Col. [[Chapman Biddle]]. Meade's headquarters were just behind the II Corps line, in the small house owned by the widow Lydia Leister.<ref name=\"E544\" />\n\nThe specific objective of the assault has been the source of historical controversy. Traditionally, the \"[[copse]] of trees\" on Cemetery Ridge has been cited as the visual landmark for the attacking force. Historical treatments such as the 1993 film [[Gettysburg (1993 film)|''Gettysburg'']] continue to popularize this view, which originated in the work of [[Gettysburg Battlefield]] historian [[John B. Bachelder]] in the 1880s. However, recent scholarship, including published works by some [[Gettysburg National Military Park]] historians, has suggested that Lee's goal was actually Ziegler's Grove on Cemetery Hill, a more prominent and highly visible grouping of trees about 300 yards (274&nbsp;m) north of the copse. The much-debated theory suggests that Lee's general plan for the second-day attacks (the seizure of Cemetery Hill) had not changed on the third day, and the attacks on July 3 were also aimed at securing the hill and the network of roads it commanded. The copse of trees, currently a prominent landmark, was under ten feet (3&nbsp;m) high in 1863, only visible to a portion of the attacking columns from certain parts of the battlefield.<ref>Harman, pp. 63\u201383.</ref>\n\nFrom the beginning of the planning, things went awry for the Confederates. While Pickett's division had not been used yet at Gettysburg, A. P. Hill's health became an issue and he did not participate in selecting which of his troops were to be used for the charge. Some of Hill's corps had fought lightly on July 1 and not at all on July 2. However, troops that ''had'' done heavy fighting on July 1 ended up making the charge.<ref>Coddington, pp. 461, 489.</ref>\n\nAlthough the assault is known to popular history as ''Pickett's Charge'', overall command was given to James Longstreet, and Pickett was one of his divisional commanders. Lee did tell Longstreet that Pickett's fresh division should lead the assault, so the name is appropriate, although some recent historians have used the name ''Pickett\u2013Pettigrew\u2013Trimble Assault'' (or, less frequently, ''Longstreet's Assault'') to more fairly distribute the credit (or blame). With Hill sidelined, Pettigrew's and Trimble's divisions were delegated to Longstreet's authority as well. Thus, Pickett's name has been lent to a charge in which he commanded 3 out of the 11 brigades while under the supervision of his corps commander throughout. Pickett's men were almost exclusively from [[Virginia]], with the other divisions consisting of troops from [[North Carolina]], [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], and [[Tennessee]]. The supporting troops under Wilcox and Lang were from Alabama and [[Florida]].<ref>Eicher, p. 544. Examples of \"Pickett\u2013Pettigrew\u2013Trimble\" citations are Sears, p. 359, Hall, p. 185, Gottfried, Map Set 26, and ''Encyclopedia Virginia'', s.v. \"[http://encyclopediavirginia.org/Numbers_at_Pickett_s_Charge Numbers at Pickett's Charge]\", accessed May 3, 2011. Dixon, p. 79, refers to the \"Picket\u2013Pettigrew Assault\".</ref>\n\nIn conjunction with the infantry assault, Lee planned a cavalry action in the Union rear. Maj. Gen. [[J. E. B. Stuart]] led his cavalry division to the east, prepared to exploit Lee's hoped-for breakthrough by attacking the Union rear and disrupting its line of communications (and retreat) along the Baltimore Pike.<ref>Sears, p. 391.</ref>\n\nDespite Lee's hope for an early start, it took all morning to arrange the infantry assault force. Neither Lee's nor Longstreet's headquarters sent orders to Pickett to have his division on the battlefield by daylight. Historian Jeffrey D. Wert blames this oversight on Longstreet, describing it either as a misunderstanding of Lee's verbal order or a mistake.<ref>Wert, pp. 98\u201399.</ref> Some of the many criticisms of Longstreet's Gettysburg performance by the postbellum [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]] authors cite this failure as evidence that Longstreet deliberately undermined Lee's plan for the battle.<ref>Gallagher, p. 141.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, on the far right end of the Union line, a seven-hour battle raged for the control of [[Culp's Hill]]. Lee's intent was to synchronize his offensive across the battlefield, keeping Meade from concentrating his numerically superior force, but the assaults were poorly coordinated and Maj. Gen. [[Edward Johnson (general)|Edward \"Allegheny\" Johnson's]] attacks against Culp's Hill petered out just as Longstreet's cannonade began.<ref>Coddington, pp. 454\u2013455.</ref>\n\n==Artillery barrage==\n[[File:Pickett's Charge defence.png|thumb|Cannons representing Hancock's defenses, stormed by Pickett's Charge]]\n\nThe infantry charge was preceded by what Lee hoped would be a powerful and well-concentrated cannonade of the Union center, destroying the Union artillery batteries that could defeat the assault and demoralizing the Union infantry. But a combination of inept artillery leadership and defective equipment doomed the barrage from the beginning. Longstreet's corps artillery chief, Col. [[Edward Porter Alexander]], had effective command of the field; Lee's artillery chief, Brig. Gen. [[William N. Pendleton]], played little role other than to obstruct the effective placement of artillery from the other two corps. Despite Alexander's efforts, then, there was insufficient concentration of Confederate fire on the objective.<ref>Sears, pp. 377\u201380; Wert, p. 127; Coddington, p. 485.</ref>\n\nThe July 3 bombardment was likely the largest of the war,<ref>Symonds, p. 214: \"It may well have been the loudest man-made sound on the North American continent until the detonation of the first [[atomic bomb]] at [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]].</ref> with hundreds of cannons from both sides firing along the lines for one to two hours,<ref name=times>Coddington, p. 502, indicates the bombardment stopped at 3 p.m. Hess, p. 162, writes that the bombardment was essentially over by 2 p.m. Wert, p. 182, states that  accounts from participants of the bombardment duration vary from 45 minutes to two hours or more, but the \"most reliable\" are one hour, because the Confederates did not have sufficient ammunition to fire longer than that. Sears, p. 415, states the bombardment ended at 2:30 p.m.</ref> starting around 1 p.m. Confederate guns numbered between 150 and 170<ref>Estimates of the guns deployed vary. Coddington, p. 493: \"over 150\"; Eicher, p. 543: 159; Trudeau, p. 452: 164; Symonds, p. 215: \"more than 160\"; Clark, p. 128, \"about 170\"; Pfanz, p. 45: \"170 (we cannot know the exact number).\" All agree that approximately 80 guns available in the Army of Northern Virginia were ''not'' used during the bombardment.</ref> and fired from a line over two miles (3&nbsp;km) long, starting in the south at the Peach Orchard and running roughly parallel to the Emmitsburg Road. Confederate Brig. Gen. [[Evander M. Law]] wrote, \"The cannonade in the center&nbsp;... presented one of the most magnificent battle-scenes witnessed during the war. Looking up the valley towards Gettysburg, the hills on either side were capped with crowns of flame and smoke, as 300 guns, about equally divided between the two ridges, vomited their iron hail upon each other.\"<ref>Eicher, p. 543.</ref>\n\nDespite its ferocity, the fire was mostly ineffectual. Confederate shells often overshot the infantry front lines\u2014in some cases because of inferior shell fuses that delayed detonation\u2014and the smoke covering the battlefield concealed that fact from the gunners. Union artillery chief Brig. Gen. [[Henry Jackson Hunt|Henry J. Hunt]] had only about 80 guns available to conduct counter-battery fire; the geographic features of the Union line had limited areas for effective gun emplacement. He also ordered that firing cease to conserve ammunition, but to fool Alexander, Hunt ordered his cannons to cease fire slowly to create the illusion that they were being destroyed one by one. By the time all of Hunt's cannons ceased fire, and still blinded by the smoke from battle, Alexander fell for Hunt's deception and believed that many of the Union batteries had been destroyed. Hunt had to resist the strong arguments of Hancock, who demanded Union fire to lift the spirits of the infantrymen pinned down by Alexander's bombardment. Even Meade was affected by the artillery\u2014the Leister house was a victim of frequent overshots, and he had to evacuate with his staff to Powers Hill.<ref>Sears, pp. 397\u2013400; Wert, pp. 175, 184; Coddington, p. 497; Hess, pp. 180\u201381; Clark, p. 135.</ref>\n\n[[File:The photographic history of the Civil War - thousands of scenes photographed 1861-65, with text by many special authorities (1911) (14576199329).jpg|thumb|\"A gun and gunners that repulsed Pickett's Charge\" (from ''The Photographic History of the Civil War''). This was [[Andrew Cowan (soldier)|Andrew Cowan]]'s 1st New York Artillery Battery.]]\nThe day was hot, 87&nbsp;\u00b0F (31&nbsp;\u00b0C) by one account,<ref>Sears, p. 383. The temperature was recorded at 2 p.m. by Professor Michael Jacobs of [[Gettysburg College]].</ref> and humid, and the Confederates suffered under the hot sun and from the Union counter-battery fire as they awaited the order to advance. When Union cannoneers overshot their targets, they often hit the massed infantry waiting in the woods of [[Seminary Ridge]] or in the shallow depressions just behind Alexander's guns, causing significant casualties before the charge began.<ref>Hess, p. 151.</ref>\n\nLongstreet had opposed the charge from the beginning, convinced the charge would fail (which ultimately proved true), and had his own plan that he would have preferred for a strategic movement around the Union left flank. In his memoirs, he recalled telling Lee:\n\n{{Quote|General, I have been a soldier all my life. I have been with soldiers engaged in fights by couples, by squads, companies, regiments, divisions, and armies, and should know, as well as any one, what soldiers can do. It is my opinion that no fifteen thousand men ever arrayed for battle can take that position.<ref>Wert, p. 283.</ref>}}\n\nLongstreet wanted to avoid personally ordering the charge by attempting to pass the mantle onto young Colonel Alexander, telling him that he should inform Pickett at the optimum time to begin the advance, based on his assessment that the Union artillery had been effectively silenced. Although he had insufficient information to accomplish this, Alexander eventually notified Pickett that he was running dangerously short of ammunition, sending the message \"If you are coming at all, come at once, or I cannot give you proper support, but the enemy's fire has not slackened at all. At least eighteen guns are still firing from the cemetery itself.\" Pickett asked Longstreet, \"General, shall I advance?\" Longstreet recalled in his memoirs, \"The effort to speak the order failed, and I could only indicate it by an affirmative bow.\"<ref>Longstreet, p. 392; Coddington, pp. 500\u2013502; Hess pp. 160\u201361.</ref>\n\nLongstreet made one final attempt to call off the assault. After his encounter with Pickett, he discussed the artillery situation with Alexander, and was informed that Alexander did not have full confidence that all the enemy's guns were silenced and that the Confederate ammunition was almost exhausted. Longstreet ordered Alexander to stop Pickett, but the young colonel explained that replenishing his ammunition from the trains in the rear would take over an hour, and this delay would nullify any advantage the previous barrage had given them. The infantry assault went forward without the Confederate artillery close support that had been originally planned.<ref>Hess, pp. 161\u201362.</ref>\n\n==Infantry assault==\n[[File:High Water Mark - Cemetery Ridge, Gettysburg Battlefield.jpg|thumb|left|Cemetery Ridge, looking south along the ridge with Little Round Top and Big Round Top in the distance.

Clark, p. 131: 12,000; Sauers, p. 835: 10,500 to 15,000; Eicher, p. 544: 10,500 to 13,000; Sears, p. 392: \"13,000 or so\"; Pfanz, p. 44: \"about 12,000\"; Coddington, p. 462: 13,500; Hess, p. 335: 11,830.</ref> Although the attack is popularly called a \"charge\", the men marched deliberately in line, to speed up and then charge only when they were within a few hundred yards of the enemy. The line consisted of Pettigrew and Trimble on the left, and Pickett to the right. The nine brigades of men stretched over a mile-long (1,600&nbsp;m) front. The Confederates encountered heavy artillery fire while advancing nearly three quarters of a mile across open fields to reach the Union line and were slowed by fences in their path. Initially sloping down, the terrain changed to a gentle upward incline approximately midway between the lines. These obstacles played a large role in the increasing number of casualties the advancing Confederates faced. The ground between Seminary Ridge and Cemetery Ridge is slightly undulating, and the advancing troops periodically disappeared from the view of the Union cannoneers. As the three Confederate divisions advanced, awaiting Union soldiers began shouting \"Fredericksburg! Fredericksburg! Fredericksburg!\" in reference to the disastrous Union advance on the Confederate line during the 1862 [[Battle of Fredericksburg]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} Fire from Lt. Col. [[Freeman McGilvery]]'s concealed artillery positions north of [[Little Round Top]] raked the Confederate right flank, while the artillery fire from Cemetery Hill hit the left. Shell and solid shot in the beginning turned to [[canister shot|canister]] and [[Rifled musket|musket]] fire as the Confederates came within 400&nbsp;yards of the Union line. The mile-long front shrank to less than half a mile (800&nbsp;m) as the men filled in gaps that appeared throughout the line and followed the natural tendency to move away from the flanking fire.<ref>Hess, p. 171; Clark, p. 137; Sears, pp. 424\u201326.</ref>\n\nOn the left flank of the attack, Brockenbrough's brigade was devastated by artillery fire from Cemetery Hill. They were also subjected to a surprise musket fusillade from the [[8th Ohio Infantry]] regiment. The 160 Ohioans, firing from a single line, so surprised Brockenbrough's Virginians\u2014already demoralized by their losses to artillery fire\u2014that they panicked and fled back to Seminary Ridge, crashing through Trimble's division and causing many of his men to bolt as well. The Ohioans followed up with a successful flanking attack on Davis's brigade of Mississippians and North Carolinians, which was now the left flank of Pettigrew's division. The survivors were subjected to increasing artillery fire from Cemetery Hill. More than 1,600 rounds were fired at Pettigrew's men during the assault. This portion of the assault never advanced much farther than the sturdy fence at the Emmitsburg Road. By this time, the Confederates were close enough to be fired on by artillery canister and Alexander Hays' division unleashed very effective musketry fire from behind 260 yards of stone wall, with every rifleman of the division lined up as many as four deep, exchanging places in line as they fired and then fell back to reload.<ref>Sears, pp. 422\u201325, 429\u201331; Hess, pp. 188\u201390.</ref>\n\n{{Quote box\n|align  = right\n|width  = 35%\n|quote  = They were at once enveloped in a dense cloud of smoke and dust.

Franklin Sawyer, 8th Ohio<ref>Sears, p. 422.</ref>\n}}\n\nTrimble's division of two brigades followed Pettigrew's, but made poor progress. Confusing orders from Trimble caused Lane to send only three and a half of his North Carolina regiments forward. Renewed fire from the 8th Ohio and the onslaught of Hays' riflemen prevented most of these men from getting past the Emmitsburg Road. Scales's North Carolina brigade, led by Col. William L. J. Lowrance, started with a heavier disadvantage\u2014they had lost almost two-thirds of their men on July 1. They were also driven back and Lowrance was wounded. The Union defenders also took casualties, but Hays encouraged his men by riding back and forth just behind the battle line, shouting \"Hurrah! Boys, we're giving them hell!\". Two horses were shot out from under him. Historian Stephen W. Sears calls Hays' performance \"inspiring\".<ref>Sears, pp. 434\u201335.</ref>\n\nOn the right flank, Pickett's Virginians crossed the Emmitsburg road and wheeled partially to their left to face northeast. They marched in two lines, led by the brigades of Brig. Gen. [[James L. Kemper]] on the right and Brig. Gen. [[Richard B. Garnett]] on the left; Brig. Gen. [[Lewis A. Armistead]]'s brigade followed closely behind. As the division wheeled to the left, its right flank was exposed to McGilvery's guns and the front of Doubleday's Union division on Cemetery Ridge. Stannard's Vermont Brigade marched forward, faced north, and delivered withering fire into the rear of Kemper's brigade. At about this time, Hancock, who had been prominent in displaying himself on horseback to his men during the Confederate artillery bombardment, was wounded by a bullet striking the pommel of his saddle, entering his inner right thigh along with wood fragments and a large bent nail. He refused evacuation to the rear until the battle was settled.<ref>Clark, pp. 139\u201343; Pfanz, p.51; Sears, pp. 436\u201339.</ref>\n\n[[File:Field of Pickett's Charge 101215.jpg|thumb|left|Field of Pickett's Charge, viewed from north of The Angle, looking west]]\n\nAs Pickett's men advanced, they withstood the defensive fire of first Stannard's brigade, then Harrow's, and then Hall's, before approaching a minor salient in the Union center, a low stone wall taking an 80-yard right-angle turn known afterward as \"The Angle\". It was defended by Brig. Gen. [[Alexander S. Webb]]'s [[Philadelphia Brigade]]. Webb placed the two remaining guns of (the severely wounded) Lt. [[Alonzo Cushing]]'s [[4th U.S. Artillery, Battery A|Battery A, 4th U.S. Artillery]], at the front of his line at the stone fence, with the [[69th Pennsylvania Infantry|69th]] and [[71st Pennsylvania Infantry|71st Pennsylvania]] regiments of his brigade to defend the fence and the guns. The two guns and 940 men could not match the massive firepower that Hays' division, to their right, had been able to unleash.<ref>Sears, pp. 436\u201343;.</ref>\n\nTwo gaps opened up in the Union line: the commander of the 71st Pennsylvania ordered his men to retreat when the Confederates came too close to the Angle; south of the copse of trees, the men of the 59th New York (Hall's brigade) inexplicably bolted for the rear. In the latter case, this left Captain Andrew Cowan and his 1st New York Independent Artillery Battery to face the oncoming infantry. Assisted personally by artillery chief Henry Hunt, Cowan ordered five guns to fire [[canister shot|double canister]] simultaneously. The entire Confederate line to his front disappeared. The gap vacated by most of the 71st Pennsylvania, however, was more serious, leaving only a handful of the 71st, 268 men of the 69th Pennsylvania, and Cushing's two 3-inch rifled guns to receive the 2,500 to 3,000 men of Garnett's and Armistead's brigades as they began to cross the stone fence. The Irishmen of the 69th Pennsylvania resisted fiercely in a [[melee]] of rifle fire, bayonets, and fists. Webb, mortified that the 71st had retreated, attempted to bring the [[72nd Pennsylvania Infantry|72nd Pennsylvania]] (a [[Zouave]] regiment) forward, but for some reason they did not obey the order, so he had to bring other regiments in to help fill the gap. During the fight, Lt. Cushing was killed as he shouted to his men, three bullets striking him, the third in his mouth. The Confederates seized his two guns and turned them to face the Union troops, but they had no ammunition to fire. As more Union reinforcements arrived and charged into the breach, the position became untenable and the Confederates began to slip away individually, with no senior officers remaining to call a formal retreat.<ref>Sears, pp. 444\u201354, \"the 59th suddenly and unaccountably bolted\"; Trudeau, p. 506; Hess, pp. 245, 271\u201376; Wert, pp. 212\u201313.</ref>\n\n[[File:Armistead's last stand.png|thumb|The monument on the [[Gettysburg Battlefield]] marking the approximate place where Armistead was fatally wounded.

The supporting attack by Wilcox and Lang on Pickett's right was never a factor; they did not approach the Union line until after Pickett was defeated, and their advance was quickly broken up by McGilvery's guns and by the Vermont Brigade.<ref>Eicher, pp. 547\u201348; Sears, pp. 451\u201354.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nWhile the Union lost about 1,500 killed and wounded, the Confederate casualty rate was over 50%. Pickett's division suffered 2,655 casualties (498 killed, 643 wounded, 833 wounded and captured, and 681 captured, unwounded). Pettigrew's losses are estimated to be about 2,700 (470 killed, 1,893 wounded, 337 captured). Trimble's two brigades lost 885 (155 killed, 650 wounded, and 80 captured). Wilcox's [[brigade]] reported losses of 200, Lang's about 400. Thus, total losses during the attack were 6,555, of which at least 1,123 Confederates were killed on the battlefield, 4,019 were wounded, and a good number of the injured were also captured. Confederate prisoner totals are difficult to estimate from their reports; Union reports indicated that 3,750 men were captured.<ref>Hess, pp. 333\u201335; Sears, p. 467.</ref>\n\nThe casualties were also high among the commanders of the charge. Trimble and Pettigrew were the most senior casualties of the day; Trimble lost a leg, and Pettigrew received a minor wound to the hand (only to die from a bullet to the abdomen suffered in a minor skirmish during the retreat to Virginia).<ref>Sears, p. 467; Eicher, pp. 548\u201349.</ref> In Pickett's division, 26 of the 40 field grade officers (majors, lieutenant colonels, and colonels) were casualties\u2014twelve killed or mortally wounded, nine wounded, four wounded and captured, and one captured.<ref>Wert, pp. 291\u201392.</ref> All of his brigade commanders fell: Kemper was wounded seriously, captured by Union soldiers, rescued, and then captured again during the retreat to Virginia; Garnett and Armistead were killed. Garnett had a previous leg injury and rode his horse during the charge, despite knowing that conspicuously riding a horse into heavy enemy fire would mean almost certain death. Armistead, known for leading his brigade with his cap on the tip of his sword, made the farthest progress through the Union lines. He was mortally wounded, falling near \"The Angle\" at what is now called the [[High Water Mark of the Confederacy]] and died two days later in a Union hospital. Ironically, the Union troops that fatally wounded Armistead were under the command of his old friend, [[Winfield S. Hancock]], who was himself severely wounded in the battle. Per his dying wishes, Longstreet delivered Armistead's Bible and other personal effects to Hancock's wife, Almira.<ref>[http://www.granitebrigade.com/brigadeministy Armistead Hancock story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711122515/http://www.granitebrigade.com/brigadeministy |date=2011-07-11 }}, Brigade Ministry: Examples of personal ministry among the troops, accessed January 5, 2009.</ref> Of the 15 regimental commanders in Pickett's division, the [[Virginia Military Institute]] produced 11 and all were casualties\u2014six killed, five wounded.<ref>Hess, p. 335.</ref>\n\nStuart's cavalry action in indirect support of the infantry assault was unsuccessful. He was met and stopped by Union cavalry under the command of Brig. Gen. [[David McM. Gregg]] about three miles (5&nbsp;km) to the east, in [[Battle of Gettysburg, Third Day cavalry battles#East Cavalry Field|East Cavalry Field]].<ref>Pfanz, pp. 52\u201353.</ref>\n\nAs soldiers straggled back to the Confederate lines along Seminary Ridge, Lee feared a Union counteroffensive and tried to rally his center, telling returning soldiers and Wilcox that the failure was \"all my fault\". Pickett was inconsolable for the rest of the day and never forgave Lee for ordering the charge. When Lee told Pickett to rally his division for the defense, Pickett allegedly replied, \"General, I have no division.\"<ref>Hess, p. 326; Sears, p. 458; Wert, pp. 251\u201352, disputes prevalent accounts that Lee and Pickett met personally after the battle.</ref>\n\nThe Union counteroffensive never came; the Army of the Potomac was exhausted and nearly as damaged at the end of the three days as the Army of Northern Virginia. Meade was content to hold the field. On July 4, the armies observed an informal truce and collected their dead and wounded. Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] accepted the surrender of the [[Battle of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] garrison along the [[Mississippi River]], splitting the Confederacy in two. These two Union victories are generally considered the [[Turning Point of the American Civil War|turning point]] of the Civil War.<ref>Pfanz, p. 53.</ref>\n\nHistory may never know the true story of Lee's intentions at Gettysburg. He never published memoirs, and his after-action report from the battle was cursory. Most of the senior commanders of the charge were casualties and did not write reports. Pickett's report was apparently so bitter that Lee ordered him to destroy it, and no copy has been found.<ref>Wert, p. 297.</ref>\n\nThe controversy over Lee's plans and his officers' implementation of them have led historians to question whether the charge could have succeeded if done differently. One study used a [[Lanchester's laws|Lanchester model]] to examine several alternative scenarios and their outcomes. The results suggest that Lee could have captured a foothold on Cemetery Ridge if he had committed several more infantry brigades to the charge; but this likely would have left him with insufficient reserves to hold or exploit the position.<ref>Armstrong MJ, Sodergren SE. 2015, Refighting Pickett\u2019s Charge: mathematical modeling of the Civil War battlefield, Social Science Quarterly.</ref>\n\nVirginian newspapers praised Pickett's Virginia division as making the most progress during the charge, and the papers used Pickett's comparative success as a means of criticizing the actions of the other states' troops during the charge. It was this publicity that played a significant factor in selecting the name Pickett's Charge. Pickett's military career was never the same after the charge, and he was displeased about having his name attached to the repulsed charge. In particular North Carolinians have long taken exception to the characterizations and point to the poor performance of Brockenbrough's Virginians in the advance as a major causative factor of failure.<ref>Desjardins, p. 47; Sears, p. 359.</ref> Some historians have questioned the primacy of Pickett's role in the battle. W. R. Bond wrote in 1888, \"No body of troops during the last war made as much reputation on so little fighting.\"<ref>Bond, W.R. ''Pickett or Pettigrew? An Historical Essay''. Scotland Neck: W.W. Hall, 1888.</ref>\n\nAdditional controversy developed after the battle about Pickett's personal location during the charge. The fact that fifteen of his officers and all three of his brigadier generals were casualties while Pickett managed to escape unharmed led many to question his proximity to the fighting and, by implication, his personal courage. The 1993 film [[Gettysburg (1993 film)|''Gettysburg'']] depicts him observing on horseback from the Codori Farm at the Emmitsburg Road, but there is no historical evidence to confirm this. It was established doctrine in the Civil War that commanders of divisions and above would \"lead from the rear\", while brigade and more junior officers were expected to lead from the front, and while this was often violated, there was nothing for Pickett to be ashamed of if he coordinated his forces from behind.<ref>Sears, pp. 426, 455; Coddington, pp. 504\u2013505.</ref>\n\nPickett's Charge became one of the iconic symbols of the literary and cultural movement known as the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]]. [[William Faulkner]], the quintessential Southern novelist, summed up the picture in Southern memory of this gallant but futile episode:<ref>Quoted in Desjardins, pp. 124\u201325.</ref>\n\n{{Quotation\n|For every Southern boy fourteen years old, not once but whenever he wants it, there is the instant when it's still not yet two o'clock on that July afternoon in 1863, the brigades are in position behind the rail fence, the guns are laid and ready in the woods and the furled flags are already loosened to break out and Pickett himself with his long oiled ringlets and his hat in one hand probably and his sword in the other looking up the hill waiting for Longstreet to give the word and it's all in the balance, it hasn't happened yet, it hasn't even begun yet, it not only hasn't begun yet but there is still time for it not to begin against that position and those circumstances which made more men than Garnett and Kemper and Armistead and Wilcox look grave yet it's going to begin, we all know that, we have come too far with too much at stake and that moment doesn't need even a fourteen-year-old boy to think This time. Maybe this time with all this much to lose than all this much to gain: Pennsylvania, Maryland, the world, the golden dome of Washington itself to crown with desperate and unbelievable victory the desperate gamble, the cast made two years ago.\n|William Faulkner|''[[Intruder in the Dust]]''}}\n\n==The battlefield today==\n[[File:High Water Mark from Gettysburg.PNG|thumb|A small portion of the Gettysburg Cyclorama]]\nThe site of Pickett's Charge is one of the best-maintained portions of the [[Gettysburg Battlefield]]. Despite millions of annual visitors to Gettysburg National Military Park, very few have walked in the footsteps of Pickett's division. The [[National Park Service]] maintains a neat, mowed path alongside a fence that leads from the Virginia Monument on West Confederate Avenue (Seminary Ridge) due east to the Emmitsburg Road in the direction of the Copse of Trees. Pickett's division, however, started considerably south of that point, near the Spangler farm, and wheeled to the north after crossing the road. In fact, the Park Service pathway stands ''between'' the two main thrusts of Longstreet's assault\u2014Trimble's division advanced north of the current path, while Pickett's division moved from farther south.<ref>Harman, pp. 77, 116; Sears, map, p. 427.</ref>\n\nA [[cyclorama]] painting by the French artist [[Paul Philippoteaux]] entitled ''The Battle of Gettysburg'', also known as the [[Gettysburg Cyclorama]], depicts Pickett's Charge from the vantage point of the Union defenders on Cemetery Ridge. Completed and first exhibited in 1883, it is one of the last surviving cycloramas in the United States. It was restored and relocated to the new National Park Service Visitor Center in September 2008.<ref>{{cite web |last=Heiser |first=John |title=The Gettysburg Cyclorama |work=[[Gettysburg National Military Park]] |publisher=National Park Service |year=2005 |url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/gett/gettcyclo.htm|accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Gabor Boritt|Boritt, Gabor S.]], ed.

Lee]] against [[Major General (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[George G. Meade]]'s [[Union Army|Union]] positions on July 3, 1863, the last day of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in the state of [[Pennsylvania]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Its futility was predicted by the charge's commander, [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[James Longstreet]], and it was arguably an avoidable mistake from which the [[Confederate States of America|Southern]] war effort never fully recovered militarily or psychologically. The farthest point reached by the attack has been referred to as the [[high-water mark of the Confederacy]].\n\nThe charge is named after Maj. Gen. [[George Pickett]], one of three Confederate generals who led the assault under Longstreet.\n\nPickett's Charge was part of Lee's \"general plan\"<ref>War of the Rebellion: Official Records (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1889), Volume 27, Series I, Part 2, p. 320</ref> to take Cemetery Hill and the network of roads it commanded. His military secretary, [[Armistead Lindsay Long]], described Lee's thinking:\n<blockquote>There was&nbsp;... a weak point&nbsp;... where [Cemetery Ridge], sloping westward, formed the depression through which the Emmitsburg road passes. Perceiving that by forcing the Federal lines at that point and turning toward Cemetery Hill [Hays' Division] would be taken in flank and the remainder would be neutralized.&nbsp;... Lee determined to attack at that point, and the execution was assigned to Longstreet.<ref>A. L. Long. ''Memoirs of Robert E. Lee: His Military and Personal History''. (London: Sampson, Low, Marston, Seale and Rivington, 1886), pp. 287\u2013288.</ref></blockquote> \nOn the night of July 2, Meade correctly predicted to General Gibbon, after a [[council of war]], that Lee would attack the center of his lines the following morning.\n\nThe infantry assault was preceded by a massive artillery bombardment that was meant to soften up the Union defense and silence its artillery, but was largely ineffective. Approximately 12,500 men in nine infantry brigades advanced over open fields for three-quarters of a mile under heavy Union artillery and rifle fire. Although some Confederates were able to breach the low stone wall that shielded many of the Union defenders, they could not maintain their hold and were repelled with over 50% casualties, a decisive defeat that ended the three-day battle and Lee's campaign into [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>Pfanz, pp. 44\u201352.</ref>\n\nYears later, when asked why his charge at Gettysburg failed, Pickett reportedly replied, \"I've always thought the [[Yankee]]s had something to do with it.\"<ref>Boritt, p. 19.</ref><ref name=\"Savas\">{{cite book|last1=Savas|first1=Theodore P.|last2=Woodbury|first2=David A.|title=The Campaign For Atlanta & Sherman's March to the Sea, Volume 1|date=2013|publisher=Savas Publishing|isbn=9781940669052|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WGhpAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT91&dq=%22I%27ve+always+thought+the+Yankees+had+something+to+do+with+it.%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjVmL6l6oHVAhVMaT4KHfmUCBoQ6AEIQTAF#v=onepage&q=%22I%27ve%20always%20thought%20the%20Yankees%20had%20something%20to%20do%20with%20it.%22&f=false|accessdate=11 July 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n===Military situation===\n{{Main|Gettysburg Campaign|Battle of Gettysburg|Battle of Gettysburg, First Day|Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day}}\n{{further|Gettysburg Battlefield}}\n\n==Opposing forces==\n===Union===\n{{further|Gettysburg Union order of battle}}\n\n===Confederate===\n{{further|Gettysburg Confederate order of battle}}\n\n==Plans and command structures==\nPickett's Charge was planned for three Confederate [[division (military)|division]]s, commanded by [[Major General (CSA)|Maj. Gen.]] [[George Pickett]], [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brig. Gen.]] [[J. Johnston Pettigrew]], and Maj. Gen. [[Isaac R. Trimble]], consisting of troops from [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[James Longstreet]]'s First Corps and Lt. Gen. [[A. P. Hill]]'s Third Corps. Pettigrew commanded brigades from Maj. Gen. [[Henry Heth]]'s old division, under [[Colonel|Col.]] [[Birkett D. Fry]] (Archer's Brigade), Col. [[James K. Marshall]] (Pettigrew's Brigade), Brig. Gen. [[Joseph R. Davis]], and Col. [[John M. Brockenbrough]]. Trimble, commanding Maj. Gen. [[William Dorsey Pender|Dorsey Pender]]'s division, had the brigades of Brig. Gens. [[Alfred M. Scales]] (temporarily commanded by Col. [[William Lee J. Lowrance]]) and [[James Henry Lane (Confederate general)|James H. Lane]]. Two brigades from Maj. Gen. [[Richard H. Anderson]]'s division (Hill's Corps) were to support the attack on the right flank: Brig. Gen. [[Cadmus M. Wilcox]] and Col. [[David Lang (colonel)|David Lang]] ([[Edward A. Perry|Perry's]] brigade).<ref name=E544>Eicher, pp. 544\u2013546.</ref>\n\nThe target of the Confederate assault was the center of the Union [[Army of the Potomac]]'s [[II Corps (Union Army)|II Corps]], commanded by Maj. Gen. [[Winfield S. Hancock]]. Directly in the center was the division of Brig. Gen. [[John Gibbon]] with the brigades of Brig. Gen. [[William Harrow]], Col. [[Norman J. Hall]], and Brig. Gen. [[Alexander S. Webb]]. (On the night of July 2, Meade correctly predicted to Gibbon at a [[council of war]] that Lee would try an attack on Gibbon's sector the following morning.)<ref>Sears, p. 345.</ref> To the north of this position were brigades from the division of Brig. Gen. [[Alexander Hays]], and to the south was Maj. Gen. [[Abner Doubleday]]'s division of the [[I Corps (Union Army)|I Corps]], including the [[2nd Vermont Brigade]] of Brig. Gen. [[George J. Stannard]] and the [[121st Pennsylvania Regiment|121st Pennsylvania]] under the command of Col. [[Chapman Biddle]]. Meade's headquarters were just behind the II Corps line, in the small house owned by the widow Lydia Leister.<ref name=\"E544\" />\n\nThe specific objective of the assault has been the source of historical controversy. Traditionally, the \"[[copse]] of trees\" on Cemetery Ridge has been cited as the visual landmark for the attacking force. Historical treatments such as the 1993 film [[Gettysburg (1993 film)|''Gettysburg'']] continue to popularize this view, which originated in the work of [[Gettysburg Battlefield]] historian [[John B. Bachelder]] in the 1880s. However, recent scholarship, including published works by some [[Gettysburg National Military Park]] historians, has suggested that Lee's goal was actually Ziegler's Grove on Cemetery Hill, a more prominent and highly visible grouping of trees about 300 yards (274&nbsp;m) north of the copse. The much-debated theory suggests that Lee's general plan for the second-day attacks (the seizure of Cemetery Hill) had not changed on the third day, and the attacks on July 3 were also aimed at securing the hill and the network of roads it commanded. The copse of trees, currently a prominent landmark, was under ten feet (3&nbsp;m) high in 1863, only visible to a portion of the attacking columns from certain parts of the battlefield.<ref>Harman, pp. 63\u201383.</ref>\n\nFrom the beginning of the planning, things went awry for the Confederates. While Pickett's division had not been used yet at Gettysburg, A. P. Hill's health became an issue and he did not participate in selecting which of his troops were to be used for the charge. Some of Hill's corps had fought lightly on July 1 and not at all on July 2. However, troops that ''had'' done heavy fighting on July 1 ended up making the charge.<ref>Coddington, pp. 461, 489.</ref>\n\nAlthough the assault is known to popular history as ''Pickett's Charge'', overall command was given to James Longstreet, and Pickett was one of his divisional commanders. Lee did tell Longstreet that Pickett's fresh division should lead the assault, so the name is appropriate, although some recent historians have used the name ''Pickett\u2013Pettigrew\u2013Trimble Assault'' (or, less frequently, ''Longstreet's Assault'') to more fairly distribute the credit (or blame). With Hill sidelined, Pettigrew's and Trimble's divisions were delegated to Longstreet's authority as well. Thus, Pickett's name has been lent to a charge in which he commanded 3 out of the 11 brigades while under the supervision of his corps commander throughout. Pickett's men were almost exclusively from [[Virginia]], with the other divisions consisting of troops from [[North Carolina]], [[Mississippi]], [[Alabama]], and [[Tennessee]]. The supporting troops under Wilcox and Lang were from Alabama and [[Florida]].<ref>Eicher, p. 544. Examples of \"Pickett\u2013Pettigrew\u2013Trimble\" citations are Sears, p. 359, Hall, p. 185, Gottfried, Map Set 26, and ''Encyclopedia Virginia'', s.v. \"[http://encyclopediavirginia.org/Numbers_at_Pickett_s_Charge Numbers at Pickett's Charge]\", accessed May 3, 2011. Dixon, p. 79, refers to the \"Picket\u2013Pettigrew Assault\".</ref>\n\nIn conjunction with the infantry assault, Lee planned a cavalry action in the Union rear. Maj. Gen. [[J. E. B. Stuart]] led his cavalry division to the east, prepared to exploit Lee's hoped-for breakthrough by attacking the Union rear and disrupting its line of communications (and retreat) along the Baltimore Pike.<ref>Sears, p. 391.</ref>\n\nDespite Lee's hope for an early start, it took all morning to arrange the infantry assault force. Neither Lee's nor Longstreet's headquarters sent orders to Pickett to have his division on the battlefield by daylight. Historian Jeffrey D. Wert blames this oversight on Longstreet, describing it either as a misunderstanding of Lee's verbal order or a mistake.<ref>Wert, pp. 98\u201399.</ref> Some of the many criticisms of Longstreet's Gettysburg performance by the postbellum [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]] authors cite this failure as evidence that Longstreet deliberately undermined Lee's plan for the battle.<ref>Gallagher, p. 141.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, on the far right end of the Union line, a seven-hour battle raged for the control of [[Culp's Hill]]. Lee's intent was to synchronize his offensive across the battlefield, keeping Meade from concentrating his numerically superior force, but the assaults were poorly coordinated and Maj. Gen. [[Edward Johnson (general)|Edward \"Allegheny\" Johnson's]] attacks against Culp's Hill petered out just as Longstreet's cannonade began.<ref>Coddington, pp. 454\u2013455.</ref>\n\n==Artillery barrage==\n[[File:Pickett's Charge defence.png|thumb|Cannons representing Hancock's defenses, stormed by Pickett's Charge]]\n\nThe infantry charge was preceded by what Lee hoped would be a powerful and well-concentrated cannonade of the Union center, destroying the Union artillery batteries that could defeat the assault and demoralizing the Union infantry. But a combination of inept artillery leadership and defective equipment doomed the barrage from the beginning. Longstreet's corps artillery chief, Col. [[Edward Porter Alexander]], had effective command of the field; Lee's artillery chief, Brig. Gen. [[William N. Pendleton]], played little role other than to obstruct the effective placement of artillery from the other two corps. Despite Alexander's efforts, then, there was insufficient concentration of Confederate fire on the objective.<ref>Sears, pp. 377\u201380; Wert, p. 127; Coddington, p. 485.</ref>\n\nThe July 3 bombardment was likely the largest of the war,<ref>Symonds, p. 214: \"It may well have been the loudest man-made sound on the North American continent until the detonation of the first [[atomic bomb]] at [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]].</ref> with hundreds of cannons from both sides firing along the lines for one to two hours,<ref name=times>Coddington, p. 502, indicates the bombardment stopped at 3 p.m. Hess, p. 162, writes that the bombardment was essentially over by 2 p.m. Wert, p. 182, states that  accounts from participants of the bombardment duration vary from 45 minutes to two hours or more, but the \"most reliable\" are one hour, because the Confederates did not have sufficient ammunition to fire longer than that. Sears, p. 415, states the bombardment ended at 2:30 p.m.</ref> starting around 1 p.m. Confederate guns numbered between 150 and 170<ref>Estimates of the guns deployed vary. Coddington, p. 493: \"over 150\"; Eicher, p. 543: 159; Trudeau, p. 452: 164; Symonds, p. 215: \"more than 160\"; Clark, p. 128, \"about 170\"; Pfanz, p. 45: \"170 (we cannot know the exact number).\" All agree that approximately 80 guns available in the Army of Northern Virginia were ''not'' used during the bombardment.</ref> and fired from a line over two miles (3&nbsp;km) long, starting in the south at the Peach Orchard and running roughly parallel to the Emmitsburg Road. Confederate Brig. Gen. [[Evander M. Law]] wrote, \"The cannonade in the center&nbsp;... presented one of the most magnificent battle-scenes witnessed during the war. Looking up the valley towards Gettysburg, the hills on either side were capped with crowns of flame and smoke, as 300 guns, about equally divided between the two ridges, vomited their iron hail upon each other.\"<ref>Eicher, p. 543.</ref>\n\nDespite its ferocity, the fire was mostly ineffectual. Confederate shells often overshot the infantry front lines\u2014in some cases because of inferior shell fuses that delayed detonation\u2014and the smoke covering the battlefield concealed that fact from the gunners. Union artillery chief Brig. Gen. [[Henry Jackson Hunt|Henry J. Hunt]] had only about 80 guns available to conduct counter-battery fire; the geographic features of the Union line had limited areas for effective gun emplacement. He also ordered that firing cease to conserve ammunition, but to fool Alexander, Hunt ordered his cannons to cease fire slowly to create the illusion that they were being destroyed one by one. By the time all of Hunt's cannons ceased fire, and still blinded by the smoke from battle, Alexander fell for Hunt's deception and believed that many of the Union batteries had been destroyed. Hunt had to resist the strong arguments of Hancock, who demanded Union fire to lift the spirits of the infantrymen pinned down by Alexander's bombardment. Even Meade was affected by the artillery\u2014the Leister house was a victim of frequent overshots, and he had to evacuate with his staff to Powers Hill.<ref>Sears, pp. 397\u2013400; Wert, pp. 175, 184; Coddington, p. 497; Hess, pp. 180\u201381; Clark, p. 135.</ref>\n\n[[File:The photographic history of the Civil War - thousands of scenes photographed 1861-65, with text by many special authorities (1911) (14576199329).jpg|thumb|\"A gun and gunners that repulsed Pickett's Charge\" (from ''The Photographic History of the Civil War'').

The temperature was recorded at 2 p.m. by Professor Michael Jacobs of [[Gettysburg College]].</ref> and humid, and the Confederates suffered under the hot sun and from the Union counter-battery fire as they awaited the order to advance. When Union cannoneers overshot their targets, they often hit the massed infantry waiting in the woods of [[Seminary Ridge]] or in the shallow depressions just behind Alexander's guns, causing significant casualties before the charge began.<ref>Hess, p. 151.</ref>\n\nLongstreet had opposed the charge from the beginning, convinced the charge would fail (which ultimately proved true), and had his own plan that he would have preferred for a strategic movement around the Union left flank. In his memoirs, he recalled telling Lee:\n\n{{Quote|General, I have been a soldier all my life. I have been with soldiers engaged in fights by couples, by squads, companies, regiments, divisions, and armies, and should know, as well as any one, what soldiers can do. It is my opinion that no fifteen thousand men ever arrayed for battle can take that position.<ref>Wert, p. 283.</ref>}}\n\nLongstreet wanted to avoid personally ordering the charge by attempting to pass the mantle onto young Colonel Alexander, telling him that he should inform Pickett at the optimum time to begin the advance, based on his assessment that the Union artillery had been effectively silenced. Although he had insufficient information to accomplish this, Alexander eventually notified Pickett that he was running dangerously short of ammunition, sending the message \"If you are coming at all, come at once, or I cannot give you proper support, but the enemy's fire has not slackened at all. At least eighteen guns are still firing from the cemetery itself.\" Pickett asked Longstreet, \"General, shall I advance?\" Longstreet recalled in his memoirs, \"The effort to speak the order failed, and I could only indicate it by an affirmative bow.\"<ref>Longstreet, p. 392; Coddington, pp. 500\u2013502; Hess pp. 160\u201361.</ref>\n\nLongstreet made one final attempt to call off the assault. After his encounter with Pickett, he discussed the artillery situation with Alexander, and was informed that Alexander did not have full confidence that all the enemy's guns were silenced and that the Confederate ammunition was almost exhausted. Longstreet ordered Alexander to stop Pickett, but the young colonel explained that replenishing his ammunition from the trains in the rear would take over an hour, and this delay would nullify any advantage the previous barrage had given them. The infantry assault went forward without the Confederate artillery close support that had been originally planned.<ref>Hess, pp. 161\u201362.</ref>\n\n==Infantry assault==\n[[File:High Water Mark - Cemetery Ridge, Gettysburg Battlefield.jpg|thumb|left|Cemetery Ridge, looking south along the ridge with Little Round Top and Big Round Top in the distance. The monument in the foreground is the 72nd Pennsylvania Infantry Monument.]]\n[[File:Copse of trees Gettysburg 101215.jpg|thumb|left|Copse of trees and \"high-water mark of the Confederacy\" on the Gettysburg Battlefield; looking north]]\nThe entire force that stepped off toward the Union positions at about 2 p.m.<ref name=times/> consisted of about 12,500 men.<ref>Estimates vary substantially. Clark, p. 131: 12,000; Sauers, p. 835: 10,500 to 15,000; Eicher, p. 544: 10,500 to 13,000; Sears, p. 392: \"13,000 or so\"; Pfanz, p. 44: \"about 12,000\"; Coddington, p. 462: 13,500; Hess, p. 335: 11,830.</ref> Although the attack is popularly called a \"charge\", the men marched deliberately in line, to speed up and then charge only when they were within a few hundred yards of the enemy. The line consisted of Pettigrew and Trimble on the left, and Pickett to the right. The nine brigades of men stretched over a mile-long (1,600&nbsp;m) front. The Confederates encountered heavy artillery fire while advancing nearly three quarters of a mile across open fields to reach the Union line and were slowed by fences in their path. Initially sloping down, the terrain changed to a gentle upward incline approximately midway between the lines. These obstacles played a large role in the increasing number of casualties the advancing Confederates faced. The ground between Seminary Ridge and Cemetery Ridge is slightly undulating, and the advancing troops periodically disappeared from the view of the Union cannoneers. As the three Confederate divisions advanced, awaiting Union soldiers began shouting \"Fredericksburg! Fredericksburg! Fredericksburg!\" in reference to the disastrous Union advance on the Confederate line during the 1862 [[Battle of Fredericksburg]]. Fire from Lt. Col. [[Freeman McGilvery]]'s concealed artillery positions north of [[Little Round Top]] raked the Confederate right flank, while the artillery fire from Cemetery Hill hit the left. Shell and solid shot in the beginning turned to [[canister shot|canister]] and [[Rifled musket|musket]] fire as the Confederates came within 400&nbsp;yards of the Union line. The mile-long front shrank to less than half a mile (800&nbsp;m) as the men filled in gaps that appeared throughout the line and followed the natural tendency to move away from the flanking fire.<ref>Hess, p. 171; Clark, p. 137; Sears, pp. 424\u201326.</ref>\n\nOn the left flank of the attack, Brockenbrough's brigade was devastated by artillery fire from Cemetery Hill. They were also subjected to a surprise musket fusillade from the [[8th Ohio Infantry]] regiment. The 160 Ohioans, firing from a single line, so surprised Brockenbrough's Virginians\u2014already demoralized by their losses to artillery fire\u2014that they panicked and fled back to Seminary Ridge, crashing through Trimble's division and causing many of his men to bolt as well. The Ohioans followed up with a successful flanking attack on Davis's brigade of Mississippians and North Carolinians, which was now the left flank of Pettigrew's division. The survivors were subjected to increasing artillery fire from Cemetery Hill. More than 1,600 rounds were fired at Pettigrew's men during the assault. This portion of the assault never advanced much farther than the sturdy fence at the Emmitsburg Road. By this time, the Confederates were close enough to be fired on by artillery canister and Alexander Hays' division unleashed very effective musketry fire from behind 260 yards of stone wall, with every rifleman of the division lined up as many as four deep, exchanging places in line as they fired and then fell back to reload.<ref>Sears, pp. 422\u201325, 429\u201331; Hess, pp. 188\u201390.</ref>\n\n{{Quote box\n|align  = right\n|width  = 35%\n|quote  = They were at once enveloped in a dense cloud of smoke and dust.

Franklin Sawyer, 8th Ohio<ref>Sears, p. 422.</ref>\n}}\n\nTrimble's division of two brigades followed Pettigrew's, but made poor progress. Confusing orders from Trimble caused Lane to send only three and a half of his North Carolina regiments forward. Renewed fire from the 8th Ohio and the onslaught of Hays' riflemen prevented most of these men from getting past the Emmitsburg Road. Scales's North Carolina brigade, led by Col. William L. J. Lowrance, started with a heavier disadvantage\u2014they had lost almost two-thirds of their men on July 1. They were also driven back and Lowrance was wounded. The Union defenders also took casualties, but Hays encouraged his men by riding back and forth just behind the battle line, shouting \"Hurrah! Boys, we're giving them hell!\". Two horses were shot out from under him. Historian Stephen W. Sears calls Hays' performance \"inspiring\".<ref>Sears, pp. 434\u201335.</ref>\n\nOn the right flank, Pickett's Virginians crossed the Emmitsburg road and wheeled partially to their left to face northeast. They marched in two lines, led by the brigades of Brig. Gen. [[James L. Kemper]] on the right and Brig. Gen. [[Richard B. Garnett]] on the left; Brig. Gen. [[Lewis A. Armistead]]'s brigade followed closely behind. As the division wheeled to the left, its right flank was exposed to McGilvery's guns and the front of Doubleday's Union division on Cemetery Ridge. Stannard's Vermont Brigade marched forward, faced north, and delivered withering fire into the rear of Kemper's brigade. At about this time, Hancock, who had been prominent in displaying himself on horseback to his men during the Confederate artillery bombardment, was wounded by a bullet striking the pommel of his saddle, entering his inner right thigh along with wood fragments and a large bent nail. He refused evacuation to the rear until the battle was settled.<ref>Clark, pp. 139\u201343; Pfanz, p.51; Sears, pp. 436\u201339.</ref>\n\n[[File:Field of Pickett's Charge 101215.jpg|thumb|left|Field of Pickett's Charge, viewed from north of The Angle, looking west]]\n\nAs Pickett's men advanced, they withstood the defensive fire of first Stannard's brigade, then Harrow's, and then Hall's, before approaching a minor salient in the Union center, a low stone wall taking an 80-yard right-angle turn known afterward as \"The Angle\". It was defended by Brig. Gen. [[Alexander S. Webb]]'s [[Philadelphia Brigade]]. Webb placed the two remaining guns of (the severely wounded) Lt. [[Alonzo Cushing]]'s [[4th U.S. Artillery, Battery A|Battery A, 4th U.S. Artillery]], at the front of his line at the stone fence, with the [[69th Pennsylvania Infantry|69th]] and [[71st Pennsylvania Infantry|71st Pennsylvania]] regiments of his brigade to defend the fence and the guns. The two guns and 940 men could not match the massive firepower that Hays' division, to their right, had been able to unleash.<ref>Sears, pp. 436\u201343;.</ref>\n\nTwo gaps opened up in the Union line: the commander of the 71st Pennsylvania ordered his men to retreat when the Confederates came too close to the Angle; south of the copse of trees, the men of the 59th New York (Hall's brigade) inexplicably bolted for the rear. In the latter case, this left Captain Andrew Cowan and his 1st New York Independent Artillery Battery to face the oncoming infantry. Assisted personally by artillery chief Henry Hunt, Cowan ordered five guns to fire [[canister shot|double canister]] simultaneously. The entire Confederate line to his front disappeared. The gap vacated by most of the 71st Pennsylvania, however, was more serious, leaving only a handful of the 71st, 268 men of the 69th Pennsylvania, and Cushing's two 3-inch rifled guns to receive the 2,500 to 3,000 men of Garnett's and Armistead's brigades as they began to cross the stone fence. The Irishmen of the 69th Pennsylvania resisted fiercely in a [[melee]] of rifle fire, bayonets, and fists. Webb, mortified that the 71st had retreated, attempted to bring the [[72nd Pennsylvania Infantry|72nd Pennsylvania]] (a [[Zouave]] regiment) forward, but for some reason they did not obey the order, so he had to bring other regiments in to help fill the gap. During the fight, Lt. Cushing was killed as he shouted to his men, three bullets striking him, the third in his mouth. The Confederates seized his two guns and turned them to face the Union troops, but they had no ammunition to fire. As more Union reinforcements arrived and charged into the breach, the position became untenable and the Confederates began to slip away individually, with no senior officers remaining to call a formal retreat.<ref>Sears, pp. 444\u201354, \"the 59th suddenly and unaccountably bolted\"; Trudeau, p. 506; Hess, pp. 245, 271\u201376; Wert, pp. 212\u201313.</ref>\n\n[[File:Armistead's last stand.png|thumb|The monument on the [[Gettysburg Battlefield]] marking the approximate place where Armistead was fatally wounded. The wall behind the monument marks the Union lines.]]\n\nThe infantry assault lasted less than an hour. The supporting attack by Wilcox and Lang on Pickett's right was never a factor; they did not approach the Union line until after Pickett was defeated, and their advance was quickly broken up by McGilvery's guns and by the Vermont Brigade.<ref>Eicher, pp. 547\u201348; Sears, pp. 451\u201354.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nWhile the Union lost about 1,500 killed and wounded, the Confederate casualty rate was over 50%. Pickett's division suffered 2,655 casualties (498 killed, 643 wounded, 833 wounded and captured, and 681 captured, unwounded). Pettigrew's losses are estimated to be about 2,700 (470 killed, 1,893 wounded, 337 captured). Trimble's two brigades lost 885 (155 killed, 650 wounded, and 80 captured). Wilcox's [[brigade]] reported losses of 200, Lang's about 400. Thus, total losses during the attack were 6,555, of which at least 1,123 Confederates were killed on the battlefield, 4,019 were wounded, and a good number of the injured were also captured. Confederate prisoner totals are difficult to estimate from their reports; Union reports indicated that 3,750 men were captured.<ref>Hess, pp. 333\u201335; Sears, p. 467.</ref>\n\nThe casualties were also high among the commanders of the charge. Trimble and Pettigrew were the most senior casualties of the day; Trimble lost a leg, and Pettigrew received a minor wound to the hand (only to die from a bullet to the abdomen suffered in a minor skirmish during the retreat to Virginia).<ref>Sears, p. 467; Eicher, pp. 548\u201349.</ref> In Pickett's division, 26 of the 40 field grade officers (majors, lieutenant colonels, and colonels) were casualties\u2014twelve killed or mortally wounded, nine wounded, four wounded and captured, and one captured.<ref>Wert, pp. 291\u201392.</ref> All of his brigade commanders fell: Kemper was wounded seriously, captured by Union soldiers, rescued, and then captured again during the retreat to Virginia; Garnett and Armistead were killed. Garnett had a previous leg injury and rode his horse during the charge, despite knowing that conspicuously riding a horse into heavy enemy fire would mean almost certain death. Armistead, known for leading his brigade with his cap on the tip of his sword, made the farthest progress through the Union lines. He was mortally wounded, falling near \"The Angle\" at what is now called the [[High Water Mark of the Confederacy]] and died two days later in a Union hospital. Ironically, the Union troops that fatally wounded Armistead were under the command of his old friend, [[Winfield S. Hancock]], who was himself severely wounded in the battle. Per his dying wishes, Longstreet delivered Armistead's Bible and other personal effects to Hancock's wife, Almira.<ref>[http://www.granitebrigade.com/brigadeministy Armistead Hancock story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711122515/http://www.granitebrigade.com/brigadeministy |date=2011-07-11 }}, Brigade Ministry: Examples of personal ministry among the troops, accessed January 5, 2009.</ref> Of the 15 regimental commanders in Pickett's division, the [[Virginia Military Institute]] produced 11 and all were casualties\u2014six killed, five wounded.<ref>Hess, p. 335.</ref>\n\nStuart's cavalry action in indirect support of the infantry assault was unsuccessful. He was met and stopped by Union cavalry under the command of Brig. Gen. [[David McM. Gregg]] about three miles (5&nbsp;km) to the east, in [[Battle of Gettysburg, Third Day cavalry battles#East Cavalry Field|East Cavalry Field]].<ref>Pfanz, pp. 52\u201353.</ref>\n\nAs soldiers straggled back to the Confederate lines along Seminary Ridge, Lee feared a Union counteroffensive and tried to rally his center, telling returning soldiers and Wilcox that the failure was \"all my fault\". Pickett was inconsolable for the rest of the day and never forgave Lee for ordering the charge. When Lee told Pickett to rally his division for the defense, Pickett allegedly replied, \"General, I have no division.\"<ref>Hess, p. 326; Sears, p. 458; Wert, pp. 251\u201352, disputes prevalent accounts that Lee and Pickett met personally after the battle.</ref>\n\nThe Union counteroffensive never came; the Army of the Potomac was exhausted and nearly as damaged at the end of the three days as the Army of Northern Virginia. Meade was content to hold the field. On July 4, the armies observed an informal truce and collected their dead and wounded. Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] accepted the surrender of the [[Battle of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] garrison along the [[Mississippi River]], splitting the Confederacy in two. These two Union victories are generally considered the [[Turning Point of the American Civil War|turning point]] of the Civil War.<ref>Pfanz, p. 53.</ref>\n\nHistory may never know the true story of Lee's intentions at Gettysburg. He never published memoirs, and his after-action report from the battle was cursory. Most of the senior commanders of the charge were casualties and did not write reports. Pickett's report was apparently so bitter that Lee ordered him to destroy it, and no copy has been found.<ref>Wert, p. 297.</ref>\n\nThe controversy over Lee's plans and his officers' implementation of them have led historians to question whether the charge could have succeeded if done differently. One study used a [[Lanchester's laws|Lanchester model]] to examine several alternative scenarios and their outcomes. The results suggest that Lee could have captured a foothold on Cemetery Ridge if he had committed several more infantry brigades to the charge; but this likely would have left him with insufficient reserves to hold or exploit the position.<ref>Armstrong MJ, Sodergren SE. 2015, Refighting Pickett\u2019s Charge: mathematical modeling of the Civil War battlefield, Social Science Quarterly.</ref>\n\nVirginian newspapers praised Pickett's Virginia division as making the most progress during the charge, and the papers used Pickett's comparative success as a means of criticizing the actions of the other states' troops during the charge. It was this publicity that played a significant factor in selecting the name Pickett's Charge. Pickett's military career was never the same after the charge, and he was displeased about having his name attached to the repulsed charge. In particular North Carolinians have long taken exception to the characterizations and point to the poor performance of Brockenbrough's Virginians in the advance as a major causative factor of failure.<ref>Desjardins, p. 47; Sears, p. 359.</ref> Some historians have questioned the primacy of Pickett's role in the battle. W. R. Bond wrote in 1888, \"No body of troops during the last war made as much reputation on so little fighting.\"<ref>Bond, W.R. ''Pickett or Pettigrew? An Historical Essay''. Scotland Neck: W.W. Hall, 1888.</ref>\n\nAdditional controversy developed after the battle about Pickett's personal location during the charge. The fact that fifteen of his officers and all three of his brigadier generals were casualties while Pickett managed to escape unharmed led many to question his proximity to the fighting and, by implication, his personal courage. The 1993 film [[Gettysburg (1993 film)|''Gettysburg'']] depicts him observing on horseback from the Codori Farm at the Emmitsburg Road, but there is no historical evidence to confirm this. It was established doctrine in the Civil War that commanders of divisions and above would \"lead from the rear\", while brigade and more junior officers were expected to lead from the front, and while this was often violated, there was nothing for Pickett to be ashamed of if he coordinated his forces from behind.<ref>Sears, pp. 426, 455; Coddington, pp. 504\u2013505.</ref>\n\nPickett's Charge became one of the iconic symbols of the literary and cultural movement known as the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]]. [[William Faulkner]], the quintessential Southern novelist, summed up the picture in Southern memory of this gallant but futile episode:<ref>Quoted in Desjardins, pp. 124\u201325.</ref>\n\n{{Quotation\n|For every Southern boy fourteen years old, not once but whenever he wants it, there is the instant when it's still not yet two o'clock on that July afternoon in 1863, the brigades are in position behind the rail fence, the guns are laid and ready in the woods and the furled flags are already loosened to break out and Pickett himself with his long oiled ringlets and his hat in one hand probably and his sword in the other looking up the hill waiting for Longstreet to give the word and it's all in the balance, it hasn't happened yet, it hasn't even begun yet, it not only hasn't begun yet but there is still time for it not to begin against that position and those circumstances which made more men than Garnett and Kemper and Armistead and Wilcox look grave yet it's going to begin, we all know that, we have come too far with too much at stake and that moment doesn't need even a fourteen-year-old boy to think This time.

Despite millions of annual visitors to Gettysburg National Military Park, very few have walked in the footsteps of Pickett's division. The [[National Park Service]] maintains a neat, mowed path alongside a fence that leads from the Virginia Monument on West Confederate Avenue (Seminary Ridge) due east to the Emmitsburg Road in the direction of the Copse of Trees. Pickett's division, however, started considerably south of that point, near the Spangler farm, and wheeled to the north after crossing the road. In fact, the Park Service pathway stands ''between'' the two main thrusts of Longstreet's assault\u2014Trimble's division advanced north of the current path, while Pickett's division moved from farther south.<ref>Harman, pp. 77, 116; Sears, map, p. 427.</ref>\n\nA [[cyclorama]] painting by the French artist [[Paul Philippoteaux]] entitled ''The Battle of Gettysburg'', also known as the [[Gettysburg Cyclorama]], depicts Pickett's Charge from the vantage point of the Union defenders on Cemetery Ridge.

The company is a unit of the [[Canal+ Group]], owned by [[Vivendi]].\n\n==Background==\nThe company was founded in 1988 by [[Pierre Lescure]] as a spin-off of the [[Canal+]] pay-TV network. The original function was to focus on French and [[Europe]]an productions, but later made strategic deals with American production companies. StudioCanal's most notable productions from its early years include ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', ''[[Cliffhanger (film)|Cliffhanger]]'', ''[[Under Siege]]'', ''[[Free Willy]]'', and the original ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' movie. In those days, it was known as either Le Studio Canal+ or simply Canal+.\n\nOther films the company financed include ''[[U-571 (film)|U-571]]'', ''[[Bully (2001 film)|Bully]]'', and ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary (film)|Bridget Jones's Diary]]''. StudioCanal also funded the last third of [[David Lynch]]'s film ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|166924|Mulholland Drive}}</ref> StudioCanal also financed French-language films, such as ''[[Brotherhood of the Wolf]]'' (which became the second-highest-grossing [[French-language]] film in the [[United States]] in the last two decades) and ''[[Intimate Strangers (2004 film)|Intimate Strangers]]'' (which is being remade by Hollywood-based [[Paramount Pictures]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117967389.html?categoryid=2607&cs=1|publisher=Variety|first=Matthew|last=Ross|title=Kelly Fremon|date=June 21, 2007}}</ref>). The biggest box office hits for StudioCanal have been ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' which grossed US$519 million, ''Basic Instinct'' which grossed US$352 million and ''[[The Tourist (2010 film)|The Tourist]]'' which grossed US$278 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=terminator2.htm|title=Terminator 2: Judgment Day|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=basicinstinct.htm|title=Basic Instinct|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=tourist.htm|title=The Tourist|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Film library==\nStudioCanal acquired film libraries from studios that either became defunct or had merged with it over the years; as a result, the company's library is one of the largest in the world, with over 6,000 titles.\n\nStudioCanal owns the libraries of the following companies:\n* [[Carolco Pictures]],<ref name=carolco1>{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|title=The rise and fall of Carolco|date=March 11, 2014|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/carolco/233689/the-rise-and-fall-of-carolco|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref><ref name=carolco2>{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|title=Exclusive: CEO Alex Bafer Tells Us About The Return of Carolco|date=January 26, 2015|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/carolco/243077/exclusive-ceo-alex-bafer-tells-us-about-the-return-of-carolco|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> including:\n**The Vista Organization\n**Seven Arts (joint venture with [[New Line Cinema]])\n*Paravision International, including:\n** Parafrance Films\n** [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]],<ref name=carolco1/><ref name=carolco2/><ref name=deg>{{cite web|last=Hammer|first=Joshua|title=Total Free Fall|date=March 8, 1992|work=[[Newsweek]]|url=http://www.newsweek.com/total-free-fall-195938|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> including:\n*** [[Embassy Pictures]]<ref name=carolco1/><ref name=carolco2/><ref name=deg/><ref>{{cite web|last=Friendly|first=David T.|title=De Laurentiis Rejoins The Ranks--at Embassy|date=November 16, 1985|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1985-11-16/entertainment/ca-2810_1_major-studios|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref>\n* Lumiere Pictures and Television<ref>{{cite web|last=Hopewell|first=John|title=Lumiere rocks to French classics|date=October 20, 2012|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/lumiere-rocks-to-french-classics-1118061036/|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> (currently owned as a result of parent company [[Canal+ Group]]'s acquisition of cinema operator [[UGC (cinema operator)|UGC]] who acquired those companies, via [[The Cannon Group, Inc.|Cannon Films]]), including:\n** [[EMI Films]],<ref name=ealing/><ref>\"A.B.

The company is a unit of the [[Canal+ Group]], owned by [[Vivendi]].\n\n==Background==\nThe company was founded in 1988 by [[Pierre Lescure]] as a spin-off of the [[Canal+]] pay-TV network. The original function was to focus on French and [[Europe]]an productions, but later made strategic deals with American production companies. StudioCanal's most notable productions from its early years include ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', ''[[Cliffhanger (film)|Cliffhanger]]'', ''[[Under Siege]]'', ''[[Free Willy]]'', and the original ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' movie. In those days, it was known as either Le Studio Canal+ or simply Canal+.\n\nOther films the company financed include ''[[U-571 (film)|U-571]]'', ''[[Bully (2001 film)|Bully]]'', and ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary (film)|Bridget Jones's Diary]]''. StudioCanal also funded the last third of [[David Lynch]]'s film ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|166924|Mulholland Drive}}</ref> StudioCanal also financed French-language films, such as ''[[Brotherhood of the Wolf]]'' (which became the second-highest-grossing [[French-language]] film in the [[United States]] in the last two decades) and ''[[Intimate Strangers (2004 film)|Intimate Strangers]]'' (which is being remade by Hollywood-based [[Paramount Pictures]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117967389.html?categoryid=2607&cs=1|publisher=Variety|first=Matthew|last=Ross|title=Kelly Fremon|date=June 21, 2007}}</ref>). The biggest box office hits for StudioCanal have been ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' which grossed US$519 million, ''Basic Instinct'' which grossed US$352 million and ''[[The Tourist (2010 film)|The Tourist]]'' which grossed US$278 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=terminator2.htm|title=Terminator 2: Judgment Day|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=basicinstinct.htm|title=Basic Instinct|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=tourist.htm|title=The Tourist|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Film library==\nStudioCanal acquired film libraries from studios that either became defunct or had merged with it over the years; as a result, the company's library is one of the largest in the world, with over 6,000 titles.\n\nStudioCanal owns the libraries of the following companies:\n* [[Carolco Pictures]],<ref name=carolco1>{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|title=The rise and fall of Carolco|date=March 11, 2014|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/carolco/233689/the-rise-and-fall-of-carolco|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref><ref name=carolco2>{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|title=Exclusive: CEO Alex Bafer Tells Us About The Return of Carolco|date=January 26, 2015|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/carolco/243077/exclusive-ceo-alex-bafer-tells-us-about-the-return-of-carolco|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> including:\n**The Vista Organization\n**Seven Arts (joint venture with [[New Line Cinema]])\n*Paravision International, including:\n** Parafrance Films\n** [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]],<ref name=carolco1/><ref name=carolco2/><ref name=deg>{{cite web|last=Hammer|first=Joshua|title=Total Free Fall|date=March 8, 1992|work=[[Newsweek]]|url=http://www.newsweek.com/total-free-fall-195938|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> including:\n*** [[Embassy Pictures]]<ref name=carolco1/><ref name=carolco2/><ref name=deg/><ref>{{cite web|last=Friendly|first=David T.|title=De Laurentiis Rejoins The Ranks--at Embassy|date=November 16, 1985|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1985-11-16/entertainment/ca-2810_1_major-studios|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref>\n* Lumiere Pictures and Television<ref>{{cite web|last=Hopewell|first=John|title=Lumiere rocks to French classics|date=October 20, 2012|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/lumiere-rocks-to-french-classics-1118061036/|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> (currently owned as a result of parent company [[Canal+ Group]]'s acquisition of cinema operator [[UGC (cinema operator)|UGC]] who acquired those companies, via [[The Cannon Group, Inc.|Cannon Films]]), including:\n** [[EMI Films]],<ref name=ealing/><ref>\"A.B.

By late May, the Imperial army was at [[Oberkirch_(Baden)|Oberkirch]], preparing to take the bridge at [[Kehl]] and re-establish contact with Strasburg. The next two months were spent in a series of marches and counter-marches, with Turenne seeking to remain in close contact with the Imperialists. Local geography restricted them to a relatively narrow corridor between the left bank of the [[Rhine]] and the [[Black Forest]], other factors being a dependence on waterways for moving supplies, the need to obtain forage for cavalry and transport, while persistent rain in the first half of June made movement almost impossible.<ref name=\"De P\u00e9rini, p. 151-152\">De P\u00e9rini, p. 151-152.</ref>  \n\nA number of skirmishes and encounters took place in July as each commander attempted to outwit the other, the Marquis de Vaubrun being wounded in one of these on 24 July. On 25 July, Montecuccoli stopped between [[Gro\u00dfweier]] and [[Sasbach_(Ortenau)|Sasbach]], as he waited for his subordinate [[Aeneas de Caprara]] to rejoin him from [[Offenburg]]. On the morning of 27th, Turenne arrived at [[Battle_of_Salzbach|Salzbach]], looking for an opportunity to attack; he was checking the position of his artillery in the afternoon, when he was killed by a cannonball.<ref>Lynn, 1999, 141.</ref> \n\n==The Battle==\n[[Image:Blondel - Guy Aldonce de Durfort de Lorges (1630-1702) - MV 1042.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Guy Aldonce de Durfort de Lorges]]; Turenne's nephew, who disputed command with Vaubrun]]\nThe news of Turenne's death was initially concealed from the troops, but it soon became common knowledge. Turenne had no direct subordinate but two 'Lieutenant-Generals,' his nephew, the Comte [[Guy_Aldonce_de_Durfort_de_Lorges|de Lorges]] and the Marquis de Vaubrun, who rotated the position on a daily basis. According to another officer, the [[Antoine_de_Pas_de_Feuqui\u00e8res|Marquis de Feuqui\u00e8res]], de Lorges and de Vaubrun now spent the next three days arguing who should assume command, at one point drawing swords on each other in the middle of the camp.<ref>{{cite book |last1=De P\u00e9rini |first1=Hard\u00ff |title=Batailles fran\u00e7aises |date=1896 |publisher=Ernest Flammarion, Paris|page=161 |url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k750505/f162.item.r=Altenheim |accessdate=20 October 2018}}</ref> \n\nThe French baggage train was stationed in the nearby village of [[Willst\u00e4tt]]; hoping to capture it and re-establish direct communication with Strasburg, a force of Imperial dragoons and cavalry unsuccessfully attacked on 29 July. De Lorge and de Vaubrun finally compromised by agreeing to rotate command daily and on 31 July, the French army moved towards the bridge over the Rhine at [[Altenheim]], a small town now part of the municipality of [[Neuried]] in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]. As they did so, Montecuccoli followed up, once more threatening to take Willst\u00e4tt and the French supplies.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Almon |first1=John |title=A new military dictionary: or, the field of war.

They decided to first destroy the stores, then cross, but the delay left the army divided when night came on 31st, with Vaubrun's vanguard on the French side of the Rhine and the rest under de Lorges yet to cross.<ref name=\"Almon 1760, p. 4\">Almon 1760, p. 4.</ref> \nTo reach the Rhine, de Lorges' troops had to first cross a smaller tributary called the [[Schutter_(Kinzig)|Schutter]]. As they began doing so on 1 August, Montecuccoli attacked, while simultaneously cutting off their retreat by taking the bridge at Altenheim. Vaubrun had been wounded in the leg on 24 July and was tied onto his horse; he counter-attacked with 16 squadrons of cavalry and eight battalions of infantry and was killed in the action, but the Imperialists were driven out of Altenheim. The French rearguard was composed of the ''Brigade de Champagne,'' which included the British regiments; it repulsed a series of assaults and fighting ended around evening, with both sides withdrawing.<ref name=\"Almon 1760, p. 4\">Almon 1760, p. 4.</ref> \n[[File:Louis, Grand Cond\u00e9.PNG|thumb|right|150px|[[Louis,_Grand_Cond\u00e9|le Grand Cond\u00e9]], who replaced Turenne a few days after Altenheim]]\nDe Feuqui\u00e8res, part of the ''Brigade de Champagne,'' described this action in his 'Memoirs' as one of the 'most glorious in the history of France.' The brigade lost 10 captains and 25 lieutenants killed, French casualties being around 3,000 to the Imperialists 4,500.<ref name=\"De P\u00e9rini, p. 161\">De P\u00e9rini, p. 161.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe French withdrew to [[S\u00e9lestat]] and the [[Louis,_Grand_Cond\u00e9|Prince of Cond\u00e9]] assumed command; he was a capable general, responsible for victory at [[Battle_of_Seneffe|Seneffe]] in 1674 but in poor health and this would be his last campaign. On 11 August, a French force of 15,000 sent to relieve [[Trier]] was defeated at [[Battle_of_Konzer_Br\u00fccke|Konzer Br\u00fccke]] and Trier surrendered in September. Unwilling to risk losing the only remaining French army in the Rhineland and estimating Imperial strength at over 30,000, Cond\u00e9 took up position at the fortified town of [[Ch\u00e2tenois, Bas-Rhin|Ch\u00e2tenois]]. Montecuccoli attempted to lure him out, but with French cavalry raiding his supply lines and winter coming on, he abandoned the attempt, In the first week of November, his army recrossed the Rhine and went into winter quarters.<ref name=\"De P\u00e9rini, p. 168-171\">De P\u00e9rini, p. 168-171.</ref>        \n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Almon, John; ''A new military dictionary: or, the field of war.
