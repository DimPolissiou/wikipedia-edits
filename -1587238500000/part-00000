It is based upon the [[fairy tale]] ''[[Cinderella]]'', particularly the French version ''Cendrillon, ou la Petite Pantoufle de Verre'', by [[Charles Perrault]]. The story concerns a young woman forced into a life of servitude by her cruel stepmother and self-centered stepsisters, who dreams of a better life. With the help of her [[Fairy Godmother]], Cinderella is transformed into a Princess and finds her Prince.\n\n''Cinderella'' is the only Rodgers and Hammerstein musical written for television. It was originally broadcast live on [[CBS]] on March 31, 1957 as a vehicle for [[Julie Andrews]], who played the title role. The broadcast was viewed by more than 100 million people. It was subsequently remade for television twice, in 1965 and 1997. The 1965 version starred [[Lesley Ann Warren]] and [[Stuart Damon]]. The 1997 version starred [[Brandy Norwood]] in the title role, with [[Whitney Houston]] as the fairy godmother. Both remakes add songs from other Richard Rodgers musicals.\n\nThe musical has been adapted for the stage in a number of versions, including a London [[West End theatre|West End]] [[pantomime]] adaptation, a [[New York City Opera]] production that follows the original television version closely, and various touring productions. A [[Cinderella (2013 Broadway production)|2013 adaptation]] on Broadway starred [[Laura Osnes]] and [[Santino Fontana]], with a new book by [[Douglas Carter Beane]].\n\n==History==\nIn the 1950s, television adaptations of musicals were fairly common. Broadcast versions of ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'', ''[[Wonderful Town]]'', ''[[Anything Goes]]'' and ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'' were all seen during the decade.<ref name=HischakPBS>Hischak, Thomas.

It was a hit, and the network looked for more family-oriented musical projects. [[Richard Rodgers]] had previously supplied the [[Emmy Award]]-winning score for ''[[Victory at Sea]]'', a documentary series about [[World War II]]. NBC approached [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] and asked them to write an original musical expressly for television (rather than merely adapting an existing one to the television special format), then a novel idea. The team decided to adapt the fairy tale ''Cinderella'' and, new to television, they sought the advice of an industry insider, [[Richard Lewine]]. Lewine was then the Vice President in charge of color television at [[CBS]]. He told Rodgers and Hammerstein that CBS was also seeking a musical project and had already signed [[Julie Andrews]], who was then starring in ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' on Broadway. Rodgers recalled, in his autobiography: \"What sold us immediately was the chance to work with Julie.\"<ref name=\"R&H Theatricals\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rnh.com/show/22/Cinderella#shows-history|title=Show History|work=Cinderella|publisher=R&H Theatricals|accessdate=2009-01-29}}</ref> Rodgers and Hammerstein signed with CBS.\n\nRodgers and Hammerstein retained ownership of the show and had control over casting, direction, set and costumes, while CBS controlled the technical aspects of the broadcast and had an option for a second broadcast. CBS announced the production on September 5, 1956. In adapting the famous fairy tale, \"Rodgers and Hammerstein stayed faithful to the original [[Charles Perrault]]\" version.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/shows/cinderella/index.html \"Rodgers & Hammerstein's ''Cinderella''\"], PBS Great Performances, 2004, accessed December 25, 2012</ref>  [[Oscar Hammerstein II|Hammerstein]] was interviewed by the ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' about the adaptation: \"We want the kids who see it to recognize the story they know. Children can be very critical on that score. But, of course, their parents will be watching too, so we have tried to humanize the characters without altering the familiar plot structure.\"<ref name=\"R&H Theatricals\"/> The musical had to fit into the 90-minute program with six commercial breaks, so it was divided into six short acts. In an interview with ''[[Time Magazine]]'', Hammerstein said that \"It took me seven months to write the book and lyrics for ''Cinderella''\".<ref name=\"R&H Theatricals\"/>\n\nRehearsals started on February 21, 1957. Emmy Award-winning director [[Ralph Nelson]] and choreographer Jonathan Lucas, who had choreographed for ''[[The Milton Berle Show]]'', were both experienced with musical material on television. Rodgers' friend, [[Robert Russell Bennett]], provided the orchestrations. [[Alfredo Antonini]], a veteran with CBS, conducted. In early March, the company moved to CBS Television Color Studio 72,<ref>Studio 72 was in the former RKO (aka Keith's) 81st Street Theatre at 2248 Broadway.

The orchestra played in a small room with special equipment to overcome the suppressed acoustics. CBS invested in a massive marketing campaign, as did the sponsors.<ref name=\"R&H Theatricals\"/>  [[Ed Sullivan]] also promoted the show, which would be seen in his usual Sunday night time slot, with an appearance by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II on the previous Sunday.<ref name=HischakPBS/> It was broadcast live on March 31, 1957.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act I===\nIn the village square, the Town Crier proclaims: \"The Prince Is Giving a Ball\" to celebrate Prince Christopher's 21st birthday. The ladies of the kingdom are thrilled at the prospect of meeting him. Cinderella, whose father has died, takes care of the home of her ill-tempered and selfish stepmother and stepsisters. She carries all of their shopping parcels for them, and when they return home, all three order Cinderella about. Left alone in her corner near the fire, she dreams of living an exotic life as a princess or anything other than a servant (\"In My Own Little Corner\"). Meanwhile, the King and Queen get ready for the big celebration (\"Royal Dressing Room Scene\") and the servants discuss the planning for the feast (\"Your Majesties\"). They hope that their son will find a suitable bride, but the Prince is a bit apprehensive about meeting all the eager women of the kingdom. The Queen is touched by overhearing the King's discussion with his son and tells him she loves him (\"Boys and Girls Like You and Me\" [sometimes omitted, not sung in any of the telecasts]).\n\nAs Cinderella's stepsisters get ready for the Ball, hoping that they will catch the Prince's eye, they laugh at Cinderella's dreams. After they leave Cinderella imagines having gone with them (\"In My Own Little Corner\" (reprise)). Cinderella's Fairy Godmother appears and is moved by Cinderella's wish to go to the Ball. She transforms Cinderella into a beautifully gowned young lady and her little mouse friends and a pumpkin into a glittering carriage with footmen (\"Impossible; It's Possible\"); Cinderella leaves for the Ball.\n\n===Act II===\nCinderella arrives at the palace at 11:30; before she enters, her Godmother warns her not to stay past midnight. The Prince is bored by the attention of all the young ladies with whom he has had to dance, including the stepsisters. Cinderella's grand entrance immediately attracts everyone's attention and intrigues the Prince. They dance together and instantly fall in love (\"Ten Minutes Ago\"). Seeing the Prince with a beauty whom they do not recognize, the stepsisters ask why he wouldn't prefer a \"usual\" girl like them (\"Stepsisters' Lament\"). As the Prince and Cinderella dance he declares his love for her (\"Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful?\"). As they kiss, the clock strikes midnight and Cinderella flees before the magic wears off, but in her haste she drops the glass slipper.\n\n===Act III===\nThe next morning, Cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters reminisce about the Ball and find that Cinderella is very intuitive about what it must have been like going to the Ball (\"When You're Driving Through the Moonlight\") and dancing with the Prince (\"A Lovely Night\"). Meanwhile, the Prince is searching for the woman with whom he danced and who fled so quickly from the Ball. One of the royal guards tries the slipper on all the women of the kingdom (\"The Search\"). At Cinderella's house, the slipper will not fit any of the ladies. Cinderella's stepmother tries to steer the guard away from Cinderella, but she is not home; she is hiding in the Palace garden. The guard returns to the palace garden and informs the Prince that he has not found the missing girl. The guard then sees Cinderella hiding and places her under arrest. Prodded by the Fairy Godmother, he tries the slipper on Cinderella. It fits, and the Prince is called back to the garden where he recognizes his beloved (\"Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful?\" (reprise)). Cinderella and the Prince marry.\n\n==Musical numbers==\nThe original version contains the following songs:<ref name=\"Great Performances\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/shows/cinderella/songlist.html|title=Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"Cinderella\"|last=Hischak|first=Thomas|work=Musical Selections|publisher=PBS (Public Broadcasting Service)|accessdate=2009-01-30}}</ref>\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n; Act I\n* \"Overture\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"The Prince Is Giving a Ball\" \u2013 Town Crier and Chorus\n* \"Cinderella March\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"In My Own Little Corner\" \u2013 Cinderella\n* \"The Prince Is Giving a Ball\" (reprise) \u2013 Chorus\n* \"Your Majesties\" (Royal Dressing Room Scene) \u2013 King, Queen, Chef and Steward\n* \"In My Own Little Corner\" (reprise) \u2013 Cinderella\n* \"Impossible; It's Possible\" \u2013 Cinderella and Fairy Godmother\n{{col-break}}\n\n; Act II\n* \"Gavotte\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"Ten Minutes Ago\" \u2013 Prince and Cinderella\n* \"Stepsisters' Lament\" \u2013 Stepsisters\n* \"Waltz for a Ball\" \u2013 Chorus\n* \"Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful?\" \u2013 Prince and Cinderella\n* \"Never in a Thousand Years\" <small>(eventually omitted from the production)</small>\n{{col-break}}\n\n; Act III\n* \"When You're Driving Through the Moonlight\" \u2013 Cinderella, Stepmother and Stepsisters\n* \"A Lovely Night\" \u2013 Cinderella, Stepmother and Stepsisters\n* \"The Search\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful?\" (Reprise) \u2013 Prince\n* \"Wedding\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful?\" (Reprise) \u2013 Chorus\n{{col-end}}\n\nIn some productions, additional numbers added include \"Loneliness of Evening\" (cut from ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' and introduced in the 1965 broadcast), a song for the prince; and \"Boys and Girls like You and Me\" (cut from ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' and subsequently other shows), for the queen and king (in the Royal Dressing Room Scene), which appears in the show's published vocal score.<ref>Rendell, Bob.

The 1957 premiere had been broadcast before videotape was available, so only one performance could be shown. CBS mounted a new production in 1965, with Richard Rodgers as Executive Producer and written by Joseph Schrank. The new script hewed closer to the traditional tale, although nearly all of the original songs were retained and sung in their original settings. A new sequence opens the story: the Prince stops at Cinderella's house with his retinue for a drink of water after returning from his travels. Cinderella, home alone, and not knowing who the handsome traveler is until a page utters the words \"Your Highness\", kindly gives the Prince water from the well. After the Prince leaves, he sings \"Loneliness of Evening\", which had been composed for ''South Pacific'' in 1949 but not used in that musical.<ref name=recreates>\"Richard Rodgers recreates a ''Cinderella'' to be remembered\", ''San Mateo Times'', February 19, 1966, \"TV Week\" section, p. 54.</ref> Cinderella sings \"In My Own Little Corner\" before there is any mention of the prince giving a ball.

At the ball, embarrassed by questions about her family and background, Cinderella escapes to the garden in tears, where the Fairy Godmother appears for moral support. After her stepmother returns from the ball and is particularly cruel, Cinderella packs her belongings to run away from home. Her Fairy Godmother advises her to share her feelings with the Prince. After trying the slipper on all the other maidens, the Prince and Lionel overtake Cinderella on her journey to freedom. Meeting her gaze, the Prince recognizes her and places the slipper on her foot. At their wedding, the Fairy Godmother blesses the couple.\n\n==Stage productions==\n\n===1958 to 2008===\nThe musical was first performed on stage at the [[London Coliseum]] in 1958 in holiday [[pantomime]] adaptation that also used songs from ''[[Me & Juliet]]''.

''Variety'' estimated that 24.2 million households were tuned into the show, with an average of 4.43 viewers each.

He judged the songs \"not top-drawer Rodgers and Hammerstein\" and \"reminiscent and derivative of some of their earlier successes\" but praised four of them and said: \"In television, where original music is virtually nonexistent, these add up to quite a treat ... some current [Broadway] musicals cannot boast as much melodically.\"<ref>Gould, Jack. \"''Cinderella''\", ''The New York Times'', April 7, 1957</ref>\n\nThe 1965 version was broadcast repeatedly.

It is based upon the [[fairy tale]] ''[[Cinderella]]'', particularly the French version ''Cendrillon, ou la Petite Pantoufle de Verre'', by [[Charles Perrault]]. The story concerns a young woman forced into a life of servitude by her cruel stepmother and self-centered stepsisters, who dreams of a better life. With the help of her [[Fairy Godmother]], Cinderella is transformed into a Princess and finds her Prince.\n\n''Cinderella'' is the only Rodgers and Hammerstein musical written for television. It was originally broadcast live on [[CBS]] on March 31, 1957 as a vehicle for [[Julie Andrews]], who played the title role. The broadcast was viewed by more than 100 million people. It was subsequently remade for television twice, in 1965 and 1997. The 1965 version starred [[Lesley Ann Warren]] and [[Stuart Damon]]. The 1997 version starred [[Brandy Norwood]] in the title role, with [[Whitney Houston]] as the fairy godmother. Both remakes add songs from other Richard Rodgers musicals.\n\nThe musical has been adapted for the stage in a number of versions, including a London [[West End theatre|West End]] [[pantomime]] adaptation, a [[New York City Opera]] production that follows the original television version closely, and various touring productions. A [[Cinderella (2013 Broadway production)|2013 adaptation]] on Broadway starred [[Laura Osnes]] and [[Santino Fontana]], with a new book by [[Douglas Carter Beane]].\n\n==History==\nIn the 1950s, television adaptations of musicals were fairly common. Broadcast versions of ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'', ''[[Wonderful Town]]'', ''[[Anything Goes]]'' and ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'' were all seen during the decade.<ref name=HischakPBS>Hischak, Thomas.

It was a hit, and the network looked for more family-oriented musical projects. [[Richard Rodgers]] had previously supplied the [[Emmy Award]]-winning score for ''[[Victory at Sea]]'', a documentary series about [[World War II]]. NBC approached [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] and asked them to write an original musical expressly for television (rather than merely adapting an existing one to the television special format), then a novel idea. The team decided to adapt the fairy tale ''Cinderella'' and, new to television, they sought the advice of an industry insider, [[Richard Lewine]]. Lewine was then the Vice President in charge of color television at [[CBS]]. He told Rodgers and Hammerstein that CBS was also seeking a musical project and had already signed [[Julie Andrews]], who was then starring in ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' on Broadway. Rodgers recalled, in his autobiography: \"What sold us immediately was the chance to work with Julie.\"<ref name=\"R&H Theatricals\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rnh.com/show/22/Cinderella#shows-history|title=Show History|work=Cinderella|publisher=R&H Theatricals|accessdate=2009-01-29}}</ref> Rodgers and Hammerstein signed with CBS.\n\nRodgers and Hammerstein retained ownership of the show and had control over casting, direction, set and costumes, while CBS controlled the technical aspects of the broadcast and had an option for a second broadcast. CBS announced the production on September 5, 1956. In adapting the famous fairy tale, \"Rodgers and Hammerstein stayed faithful to the original [[Charles Perrault]]\" version.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/shows/cinderella/index.html \"Rodgers & Hammerstein's ''Cinderella''\"], PBS Great Performances, 2004, accessed December 25, 2012</ref>  [[Oscar Hammerstein II|Hammerstein]] was interviewed by the ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|Saturday Review]]'' about the adaptation: \"We want the kids who see it to recognize the story they know. Children can be very critical on that score. But, of course, their parents will be watching too, so we have tried to humanize the characters without altering the familiar plot structure.\"<ref name=\"R&H Theatricals\"/> The musical had to fit into the 90-minute program with six commercial breaks, so it was divided into six short acts. In an interview with ''[[Time Magazine]]'', Hammerstein said that \"It took me seven months to write the book and lyrics for ''Cinderella''\".<ref name=\"R&H Theatricals\"/>\n\nRehearsals started on February 21, 1957. Emmy Award-winning director [[Ralph Nelson]] and choreographer Jonathan Lucas, who had choreographed for ''[[The Milton Berle Show]]'', were both experienced with musical material on television. Rodgers' friend, [[Robert Russell Bennett]], provided the orchestrations. [[Alfredo Antonini]], a veteran with CBS, conducted. In early March, the company moved to CBS Television Color Studio 72,<ref>Studio 72 was in the former RKO (aka Keith's) 81st Street Theatre at 2248 Broadway.

The orchestra played in a small room with special equipment to overcome the suppressed acoustics. CBS invested in a massive marketing campaign, as did the sponsors.<ref name=\"R&H Theatricals\"/>  [[Ed Sullivan]] also promoted the show, which would be seen in his usual Sunday night time slot, with an appearance by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II on the previous Sunday.<ref name=HischakPBS/> It was broadcast live on March 31, 1957.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act I===\nIn the village square, the Town Crier proclaims: \"The Prince Is Giving a Ball\" to celebrate Prince Christopher's 21st birthday. The ladies of the kingdom are thrilled at the prospect of meeting him. Cinderella, whose father has died, takes care of the home of her ill-tempered and selfish stepmother and stepsisters. She carries all of their shopping parcels for them, and when they return home, all three order Cinderella about. Left alone in her corner near the fire, she dreams of living an exotic life as a princess or anything other than a servant (\"In My Own Little Corner\"). Meanwhile, the King and Queen get ready for the big celebration (\"Royal Dressing Room Scene\") and the servants discuss the planning for the feast (\"Your Majesties\"). They hope that their son will find a suitable bride, but the Prince is a bit apprehensive about meeting all the eager women of the kingdom. The Queen is touched by overhearing the King's discussion with his son and tells him she loves him (\"Boys and Girls Like You and Me\" [sometimes omitted, not sung in any of the telecasts]).\n\nAs Cinderella's stepsisters get ready for the Ball, hoping that they will catch the Prince's eye, they laugh at Cinderella's dreams. After they leave Cinderella imagines having gone with them (\"In My Own Little Corner\" (reprise)). Cinderella's Fairy Godmother appears and is moved by Cinderella's wish to go to the Ball. She transforms Cinderella into a beautifully gowned young lady and her little mouse friends and a pumpkin into a glittering carriage with footmen (\"Impossible; It's Possible\"); Cinderella leaves for the Ball.\n\n===Act II===\nCinderella arrives at the palace at 11:30; before she enters, her Godmother warns her not to stay past midnight. The Prince is bored by the attention of all the young ladies with whom he has had to dance, including the stepsisters. Cinderella's grand entrance immediately attracts everyone's attention and intrigues the Prince. They dance together and instantly fall in love (\"Ten Minutes Ago\"). Seeing the Prince with a beauty whom they do not recognize, the stepsisters ask why he wouldn't prefer a \"usual\" girl like them (\"Stepsisters' Lament\"). As the Prince and Cinderella dance he declares his love for her (\"Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful?\"). As they kiss, the clock strikes midnight and Cinderella flees before the magic wears off, but in her haste she drops the glass slipper.\n\n===Act III===\nThe next morning, Cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters reminisce about the Ball and find that Cinderella is very intuitive about what it must have been like going to the Ball (\"When You're Driving Through the Moonlight\") and dancing with the Prince (\"A Lovely Night\"). Meanwhile, the Prince is searching for the woman with whom he danced and who fled so quickly from the Ball. One of the royal guards tries the slipper on all the women of the kingdom (\"The Search\"). At Cinderella's house, the slipper will not fit any of the ladies. Cinderella's stepmother tries to steer the guard away from Cinderella, but she is not home; she is hiding in the Palace garden. The guard returns to the palace garden and informs the Prince that he has not found the missing girl. The guard then sees Cinderella hiding and places her under arrest. Prodded by the Fairy Godmother, he tries the slipper on Cinderella. It fits, and the Prince is called back to the garden where he recognizes his beloved (\"Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful?\" (reprise)). Cinderella and the Prince marry.\n\n==Musical numbers==\nThe original version contains the following songs:<ref name=\"Great Performances\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/shows/cinderella/songlist.html|title=Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"Cinderella\"|last=Hischak|first=Thomas|work=Musical Selections|publisher=PBS (Public Broadcasting Service)|accessdate=2009-01-30}}</ref>\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n; Act I\n* \"Overture\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"The Prince Is Giving a Ball\" \u2013 Town Crier and Chorus\n* \"Cinderella March\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"In My Own Little Corner\" \u2013 Cinderella\n* \"The Prince Is Giving a Ball\" (reprise) \u2013 Chorus\n* \"Your Majesties\" (Royal Dressing Room Scene) \u2013 King, Queen, Chef and Steward\n* \"In My Own Little Corner\" (reprise) \u2013 Cinderella\n* \"Impossible; It's Possible\" \u2013 Cinderella and Fairy Godmother\n{{col-break}}\n\n; Act II\n* \"Gavotte\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"Ten Minutes Ago\" \u2013 Prince and Cinderella\n* \"Stepsisters' Lament\" \u2013 Stepsisters\n* \"Waltz for a Ball\" \u2013 Chorus\n* \"Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful?\" \u2013 Prince and Cinderella\n* \"Never in a Thousand Years\" <small>(eventually omitted from the production)</small>\n{{col-break}}\n\n; Act III\n* \"When You're Driving Through the Moonlight\" \u2013 Cinderella, Stepmother and Stepsisters\n* \"A Lovely Night\" \u2013 Cinderella, Stepmother and Stepsisters\n* \"The Search\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful?\" (Reprise) \u2013 Prince\n* \"Wedding\" \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful?\" (Reprise) \u2013 Chorus\n{{col-end}}\n\nIn some productions, additional numbers added include \"Loneliness of Evening\" (cut from ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' and introduced in the 1965 broadcast), a song for the prince; and \"Boys and Girls like You and Me\" (cut from ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' and subsequently other shows), for the queen and king (in the Royal Dressing Room Scene), which appears in the show's published vocal score.<ref>Rendell, Bob.

The 1957 premiere had been broadcast before videotape was available, so only one performance could be shown. CBS mounted a new production in 1965, with Richard Rodgers as Executive Producer and written by Joseph Schrank. The new script hewed closer to the traditional tale, although nearly all of the original songs were retained and sung in their original settings. A new sequence opens the story: the Prince stops at Cinderella's house with his retinue for a drink of water after returning from his travels. Cinderella, home alone, and not knowing who the handsome traveler is until a page utters the words \"Your Highness\", kindly gives the Prince water from the well. After the Prince leaves, he sings \"Loneliness of Evening\", which had been composed for ''South Pacific'' in 1949 but not used in that musical.<ref name=recreates>\"Richard Rodgers recreates a ''Cinderella'' to be remembered\", ''San Mateo Times'', February 19, 1966, \"TV Week\" section, p. 54.</ref> Cinderella sings \"In My Own Little Corner\" before there is any mention of the prince giving a ball.

Disguised as a peasant, the Prince (feeling isolated in the castle) wanders in the marketplace (worrying his herald, Lionel), meets Cinderella, and they find each other charming. At the ball, embarrassed by questions about her family and background, Cinderella escapes to the garden in tears, where the Fairy Godmother appears for moral support. After her stepmother returns from the ball and is particularly cruel, Cinderella packs her belongings to run away from home. Her Fairy Godmother advises her to share her feelings with the Prince.

''Variety'' estimated that 24.2 million households were tuned into the show, with an average of 4.43 viewers each.

He judged the songs \"not top-drawer Rodgers and Hammerstein\" and \"reminiscent and derivative of some of their earlier successes\" but praised four of them and said: \"In television, where original music is virtually nonexistent, these add up to quite a treat ... some current [Broadway] musicals cannot boast as much melodically.\"<ref>Gould, Jack. \"''Cinderella''\", ''The New York Times'', April 7, 1957</ref>\n\nThe 1965 version was broadcast repeatedly.

Possible catastrophic risks from nature include [[supervolcano|super-volcanism]], [[impact event]]s, and energetic astronomical events such as [[gamma-ray burst]]s, [[cosmic ray]]s, [[solar flare]]s, and [[supernova]]e. These dangers are characterized as relatively small and relatively well understood, though [[pandemic]]s may be exceptions as a result of being more common, and of dovetailing with technological trends.<ref name=\"atlantic\">{{cite news |author=Ross Andersen |date=6 March 2012 |title=We're Underestimating the Risk of Human Extinction |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/were-underestimating-the-risk-of-human-extinction/253821/ |newspaper=The Atlantic |location= |publisher= |accessdate=29 March 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"aeon\"/>\n\nSynthetic pandemics via weaponized [[biological agent]]s are given more attention by FHI. Technological outcomes the Institute is particularly interested in include [[global warming|anthropogenic climate change]], [[nuclear warfare]] and [[nuclear terrorism]], [[molecular nanotechnology]], and [[artificial general intelligence]]. In expecting the largest risks to stem from future technologies, and from advanced artificial intelligence in particular, FHI agrees with other existential risk reduction organizations, such as the [[Centre for the Study of Existential Risk]] and the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Kate Whitehead |date=16 March 2014 |title=Cambridge University study centre focuses on risks that could annihilate mankind |url=http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/technology/article/1449541/cambridge-university-study-centre-focuses-risks-could |newspaper=South China Morning Post |location= |publisher= |accessdate=29 March 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Jenny Hollander |date=September 2012 |title=Oxford Future of Humanity Institute knows what will make us extinct |url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/4682-oxford-future-of-humanity-institute-knows-what-will-make-us-extinct |newspaper=Bustle |location= |publisher= |accessdate=31 March 2014 }}</ref> FHI researchers have also studied the impact of technological progress on social and institutional risks, such as [[totalitarianism]], [[Technological unemployment|automation-driven unemployment]], and information hazards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/information-hazards.pdf |title=Information Hazards: A Typology of Potential Harms from Knowledge |author=Nick Bostrom |date= |website=Future of Humanity Institute |publisher= |accessdate=31 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Anthropic reasoning ==\n{{main article|Anthropic principle}}\nFHI devotes much of its attention to exotic threats that have been little explored by other organizations, and to methodological considerations that inform existential risk reduction and forecasting. The Institute has particularly emphasized [[anthropic principle|anthropic reasoning]] in its research, as an under-explored area with general epistemological implications.\n\nAnthropic arguments FHI has studied include the [[doomsday argument]], which claims that humanity is likely to go extinct soon because it is unlikely that one is observing a point in human history that is extremely early. Instead, present-day humans are likely to be near the middle of the distribution of humans that will ever live.<ref name=\"atlantic\"/> Bostrom has also popularized the [[simulation argument]].\n\nA recurring theme in FHI's research is the [[Fermi paradox]], the surprising absence of observable alien civilizations. Robin Hanson has argued that there must be a \"[[Great Filter]]\" preventing space colonization to account for the paradox. That filter may lie in the past, if intelligence is much more rare than current biology would predict; or it may lie in the future, if existential risks are even larger than is currently recognized.\n\n== Human enhancement and rationality ==\nClosely linked to FHI's work on risk assessment, astronomical waste, and the dangers of future technologies is its work on the promise and risks of human enhancement. The modifications in question may be biological, digital, or sociological, and an emphasis is placed on the most radical hypothesized changes, rather than on the likeliest short-term innovations. FHI's [[bioethics]] research focuses on the potential consequences of [[gene therapy]], [[life extension]], [[brain implant]]s and [[brain\u2013computer interface]]s, and [[mind uploading]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/brain-emulation-roadmap-report.pdf |title=Whole Brain Emulation: A Roadmap |author=Anders Sandberg and Nick Bostrom |date= |website=Future of Humanity Institute |publisher= |accessdate=31 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nFHI's focus has been on methods for assessing and enhancing human intelligence and rationality, as a way of shaping the speed and direction of technological and social progress.

In a 2002 paper, Bostrom defined an \"existential risk\" as one \"where an adverse outcome would either annihilate Earth-originating intelligent life or permanently and drastically curtail its potential\".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nick Bostrom |date=March 2002 |title=Existential Risks: Analyzing Human Extinction Scenarios and Related Hazards |url=http://www.jetpress.org/volume9/risks.html |journal=Journal of Evolution and Technology |publisher= |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=308\u2013314 |doi= |accessdate=31 March 2014}}</ref> This includes scenarios where humanity is not directly harmed, but it fails to [[space colonization|colonize space]] and make use of the observable universe's available resources in humanly valuable projects, as discussed in Bostrom's 2003 paper, \"Astronomical Waste: The [[opportunity cost|Opportunity Cost]] of Delayed Technological Development\".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nick Bostrom |date=November 2003 |title=Astronomical Waste: The Opportunity Cost of Delayed Technological Development |url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html |journal=Utilitas |publisher= |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=308\u2013314 |doi= 10.1017/s0953820800004076|accessdate=31 March 2014|citeseerx=10.1.1.429.2849 }}</ref>\n\nBostrom and Milan \u0106irkovi\u0107's 2008 book ''Global Catastrophic Risks'' collects essays on a variety of such risks, both natural and anthropogenic. Possible catastrophic risks from nature include [[supervolcano|super-volcanism]], [[impact event]]s, and energetic astronomical events such as [[gamma-ray burst]]s, [[cosmic ray]]s, [[solar flare]]s, and [[supernova]]e. These dangers are characterized as relatively small and relatively well understood, though [[pandemic]]s may be exceptions as a result of being more common, and of dovetailing with technological trends.<ref name=\"atlantic\">{{cite news |author=Ross Andersen |date=6 March 2012 |title=We're Underestimating the Risk of Human Extinction |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/were-underestimating-the-risk-of-human-extinction/253821/ |newspaper=The Atlantic |location= |publisher= |accessdate=29 March 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"aeon\"/>\n\nSynthetic pandemics via weaponized [[biological agent]]s are given more attention by FHI. Technological outcomes the Institute is particularly interested in include [[global warming|anthropogenic climate change]], [[nuclear warfare]] and [[nuclear terrorism]], [[molecular nanotechnology]], and [[artificial general intelligence]]. In expecting the largest risks to stem from future technologies, and from advanced artificial intelligence in particular, FHI agrees with other existential risk reduction organizations, such as the [[Centre for the Study of Existential Risk]] and the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Kate Whitehead |date=16 March 2014 |title=Cambridge University study centre focuses on risks that could annihilate mankind |url=http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/technology/article/1449541/cambridge-university-study-centre-focuses-risks-could |newspaper=South China Morning Post |location= |publisher= |accessdate=29 March 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Jenny Hollander |date=September 2012 |title=Oxford Future of Humanity Institute knows what will make us extinct |url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/4682-oxford-future-of-humanity-institute-knows-what-will-make-us-extinct |newspaper=Bustle |location= |publisher= |accessdate=31 March 2014 }}</ref> FHI researchers have also studied the impact of technological progress on social and institutional risks, such as [[totalitarianism]], [[Technological unemployment|automation-driven unemployment]], and information hazards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/information-hazards.pdf |title=Information Hazards: A Typology of Potential Harms from Knowledge |author=Nick Bostrom |date= |website=Future of Humanity Institute |publisher= |accessdate=31 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Anthropic reasoning ==\n{{main article|Anthropic principle}}\nFHI devotes much of its attention to exotic threats that have been little explored by other organizations, and to methodological considerations that inform existential risk reduction and forecasting. The Institute has particularly emphasized [[anthropic principle|anthropic reasoning]] in its research, as an under-explored area with general epistemological implications.\n\nAnthropic arguments FHI has studied include the [[doomsday argument]], which claims that humanity is likely to go extinct soon because it is unlikely that one is observing a point in human history that is extremely early. Instead, present-day humans are likely to be near the middle of the distribution of humans that will ever live.<ref name=\"atlantic\"/> Bostrom has also popularized the [[simulation argument]].\n\nA recurring theme in FHI's research is the [[Fermi paradox]], the surprising absence of observable alien civilizations. Robin Hanson has argued that there must be a \"[[Great Filter]]\" preventing space colonization to account for the paradox. That filter may lie in the past, if intelligence is much more rare than current biology would predict; or it may lie in the future, if existential risks are even larger than is currently recognized.\n\n== Human enhancement and rationality ==\nClosely linked to FHI's work on risk assessment, astronomical waste, and the dangers of future technologies is its work on the promise and risks of human enhancement. The modifications in question may be biological, digital, or sociological, and an emphasis is placed on the most radical hypothesized changes, rather than on the likeliest short-term innovations. FHI's [[bioethics]] research focuses on the potential consequences of [[gene therapy]], [[life extension]], [[brain implant]]s and [[brain\u2013computer interface]]s, and [[mind uploading]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/brain-emulation-roadmap-report.pdf |title=Whole Brain Emulation: A Roadmap |author=Anders Sandberg and Nick Bostrom |date= |website=Future of Humanity Institute |publisher= |accessdate=31 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nFHI's focus has been on methods for assessing and enhancing human intelligence and rationality, as a way of shaping the speed and direction of technological and social progress. FHI's work on human irrationality, as exemplified in [[heuristics in judgment and decision-making|cognitive heuristics]] and [[cognitive bias|biases]], includes an ongoing collaboration with [[Amlin]] to study the [[systemic risk]] arising from biases in modeling.<ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Amlin and Oxford University launch major research project into the Systemic Risk of Modelling |url=http://www.amlin.com/media/press-releases/2014/11-2-2014.aspx |location= |publisher=Amlin |agency= |date=11 February 2014 |accessdate=2014-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Amlin and Oxford University to collaborate on modelling risk study |url=http://www.cirmagazine.com/cir/Amlin-and-Oxford-University-to-collaborate-on-modelling-risk-study.php |newspaper= |location= |work=Continuity, Insurance & Risk Magazine |date=11 February 2014 |accessdate=31 March 2014 }}</ref>\n\n== Selected publications ==\n* [https://www.amazon.com/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/0199678111 ''Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies''] {{ISBN|0-415-93858-9}}\n* [https://www.amazon.com/Global-Catastrophic-Risks-Nick-Bostrom/dp/0199606501/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1325524767&sr=1-1 Nick Bostrom and Milan Cirkovic: ''Global Catastrophic Risks''] {{ISBN|978-0-19-857050-9}}\n* [http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/brain-emulation-roadmap-report.pdf Nick Bostrom and Anders Sandberg: ''Brain Emulation Roadmap'']\n* [https://www.amazon.com/Human-Enhancement-Julian-Savulescu/dp/0199299722/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1233825563&sr=8-6 Nick Bostrom and Julian Savulescu: ''Human Enhancement''] {{ISBN|0-19-929972-2}}\n* [https://www.amazon.com/Anthropic-Bias-Observation-Selection-Philosophy/dp/0415883946/ ''Anthropic Bias: Observation Selection Effects in Science and Philosophy''] {{ISBN|0-415-93858-9}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Future of Life Institute]]\n* [[Global catastrophic risks]]\n* [[Human enhancement]]\n* [[Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence]]\n* [[Nick Bostrom]]\n* [[Anders Sandberg]]\n* [[K.
