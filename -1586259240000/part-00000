While it was often held that Mascagni, like [[Ruggiero Leoncavallo]], was a \"one-opera man\" who could never repeat his first success, ''[[L'amico Fritz]]'' and ''[[Iris (opera)|Iris]]'' have remained in the repertoire in Europe (especially Italy) since their premieres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2010/Mar10/Mascagni_Fritz_4778358.htm|title=Mascagni L'amico Fritz DG 4778358 [CF]: Classical Music Reviews \u2013 March 2010  MusicWeb-International|first=MusicWeb|last=International|date=|website=www.musicweb-international.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nMascagni wrote fifteen operas, an [[operetta]], several orchestral and vocal works, and also songs and piano music. He enjoyed immense success during his lifetime, both as a composer and [[Conductor (music)|conductor]] of his own and other people's music. He created a variety of styles in his operas: a Sicilian passion and warmth of ''Cavalleria'', the exotic flavor of ''Iris'', the idylls of ''L'amico Fritz'' and ''Lodoletta'',  the Gallic [[chiaroscuro]] of ''Isabeau'', the steely, Veristic power of ''Il piccolo Marat'' and the over-ripe post-romanticism of the lush ''Parisina.''\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and education===\nMascagni was born on December 7, 1863 in [[Livorno]], [[Tuscany]], the second son of Domenico and Emilia Mascagni. His father owned and operated a bakery. [[Giovanni Targioni-Tozzetti]] (\"Nanni\") was born the same year in the same city and became Mascagni's lifelong friend and collaborator.\n\nIn 1876, at the age of 13, Mascagni began musical studies with [[Alfredo Soffredini]], who founded the ''Instituto Musicale di Livorno'' (later called ''Istituto Cherubini''). Soffredini had just completed his musical studies in [[Milan]]. Also a native of Livorno, Soffredini was a composer, teacher and musical critic. Mascagni started composing rapidly: between 1879 and 1880, he wrote several works: ''Sinfonia in do minore'', ''Prima sinfonia in fa maggiore'', ''Elegia'', ''Kyrie'', ''Gloria'' and ''Ave Maria''.\n\n===Musical career: 1880\u201389===\nThe premiere of Mascagni's first cantata, ''In Filanda'', took place at the Istituto Cherubini on 9 February 1881. Performed at a musical contest in Milan, the cantata won the first prize. In the same year Mascagni met the musicians [[Arrigo Boito]] and [[Amilcare Ponchielli]] in Milan.\n\nIn 1882, he composed his ''Cantata alla gioia'' from a text by [[Friedrich Schiller]], followed by ''La stella di Garibaldi'' for voice and piano, and ''La tua stella''. On 6 May Mascagni left Livorno for Milan.  He passed the admission examination of the [[Milan Conservatory]] on 12 October. In Milan, Mascagni met the noted composer [[Giacomo Puccini]].\n\nOn 9 January 1883, Mascagni's sister, Maria, died. The cantata ''In Filanda'' became ''Pinotta'', and was proposed for the musical contest of the Conservatorio, but as his registration was late, it was not accepted.\n\nIn 1884, he composed ''Ballata'' for [[tenor]] and [[piano]]; ''M'ama non m'ama'', [[scherzo]] for [[soprano]] and piano; ''Messagio d'amore'', and ''Alla luna''.\n\nIn 1885, Mascagni composed ''Il Re a Napoli in Cremona'', a romance for tenor and [[orchestra]], on a text by [[Andrea Maffei]].  He left Milan without completing his studies. That year, he began touring as a conductor in the operetta companies of Vittorio Forl\u00ec, Alfonso and Ciro Scognamiglio, and, in [[Genoa]], the company of Luigi Arnaldo Vassallo.\n\nMascagni met the impresario [[Luigi Maresca]] in 1886 and started working with him. That December, Mascagni arrived in [[Cerignola]] with Maresca's company. He was accompanied by Argenide Marcellina Carbognani (Lina), his future wife. Helped by the mayor Giuseppe Cannone, Mascagni soon left the company of Maresca, though not without problems.\n\nHe was appointed as the master of music and singing of the new philharmonia of Cerignola. His reputation grew. He also gave piano lessons. In February 1888, he began work on the ''Messa di Gloria.'' In July, Casa Sonzogno announced in the ''Teatro Illustrato'' its second competition for a one-act opera. The following year, Mascagni completed his composition of ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' on 27 May and sent the manuscript to Milan.\n\n==Marriage and family==\nMascagni married Lina Carbognani on 3 February 1889. The next day their first son, Domenico Mascagni (\"Mim\u00ec\"), was born. Their son Dino was born on 3 January 1891. A daughter, Emi, was born in 1892.\n\n===1890\u201399===\n[[File:PietroMascagni1.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.7|Mascagni in c. 1890]]\nOn 21 February 1890, Mascagni was summoned to Rome to present his opera. The premi\u00e8re of ''Cavalleria rusticana'', winner of the Sonzogno contest, was held 17 May at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome. It had outstanding success, and the opera was soon performed in both the north and south of Italy: [[Florence]], [[Turin]], [[Bologna]], [[Palermo]], [[Milan]], [[Genoa]], [[Naples]], [[Venice]] and [[Trieste]].\n\nIn December, [[Gustav Mahler]] conducted the opera in [[Budapest]]. Soon thereafter, the cities of [[Munich]], [[Hamburg]], [[St. Petersburg]], [[Dresden]] and [[Buenos Aires]] welcomed the opera. In March 1891, it was sung in [[Vienna]]. At age 26, Mascagni had become internationally famous.\n\nMascagni premiered his ''[[L'amico Fritz]]'', his second most successful opera, on 31 October 1891 at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome. ''[[I Rantzau]]'' was premiered on 10 November at the Teatro La Pergola, in Florence, under his personal direction.\n\nThe composer next completed ''[[Silvano]] '' (1894). On 16 February 1895 he premiered  ''[[Guglielmo Ratcliff]]'' at the Teatro alla Scala of Milan. On 15 March ''Silvano'' was premiered at the same theatre. That year, Mascagni accepted the directorship of the [[Conservatorio Statale di Musica \"Gioachino Rossini\"|Liceo Rossini]] in [[Pesaro]] and moved his family there.\n\nOn 2 March 1896, Mascagni conducted the premi\u00e8re of ''[[Zanetto]]'' at the Liceo. He continued his composing and directing. On 29 June 1898 in [[Recanati]], Mascagni conducted the premi\u00e8re of a symphonic poem, ''[[A Giacomo Leopardi]]''. Mascagni began a collaboration with [[Luigi Illica]], a librettist. Their first work, ''[[Iris (opera)|Iris]],'' was premiered on 22 November at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome.\n\nMascagni's father died in May 1899.\n\n===1900\u201309===\n[[File:Amica.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.7|''Amica ''poster, 1905]]\nIn 1900, Mascagni toured Moscow and [[St. Petersburg]] and, on 17 January 1901, ''[[Le maschere]] ''was premiered in six Italian theaters.  [[Giuseppe Verdi]] died on 27 January and the following month Mascagni commemorated Verdi's passing. That same year, he conducted Verdi's ''[[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]]'' in Vienna.\n\nMascagni composed the [[incidental music]] for [[Hall Caine]]'s play, ''The Eternal City'' in August 1902; the premi\u00e8re of the play with Mascagni's music took place in London on 2 October.\n\nIn 1902 and 1903, he toured in Canada and in the United States, (in particular [[Montreal]], New York City, [[Philadelphia]], [[Boston]] and San Francisco), where he conducted many of his and other composers' works. The tour was mostly a fiasco, except for the visit to San Francisco where Mascagni was extremely well received.\n\nIn 1903, Mascagni left Pesaro after problems with the authorities. He became director of the ''Scuola Musicale Romana'', in Rome. In the same year he signed a contract with the French editor [[Paul de Choudens]].\n\n[[Amica (opera)|''Amica'']], based on a poem by Choudens with French libretto by [[Paul Collin]],<ref name = \"Flury\">{{cite book | last=Flury | first=Roger | coauthors= | title=Pietro Mascagni - A Bio-Bibliography | location=London | publisher=Greenwood Press | year=2001 | isbn=0-313-29662-6}}</ref> was premiered on 16 March 1905, in Monte-Carlo. That year, he had disputes with [[Ruggiero Leoncavallo]] and [[Giacomo Puccini]]. He also had the Livornese premi\u00e8re of ''Le maschere''.\n\nMascagni was director of the Costanzi for the season beginning in August 1909.\n\n===1910\u201319===\n[[File:Pietro Mascagni Vanity Fair 17 April 1912.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.7|Mascagni caricatured in [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]], 1912]]\nOn 4 April 1910, Mascagni began a relationship with Anna Lolli. In October he was reconciled with Puccini.\n\nMascagni ceased his activity as director of the Scuola Musicale Romana in 1911. That May he left for [[Buenos Aires]], beginning a seven-month tour in South America. The premi\u00e8re of ''[[Isabeau]]'' took place in Buenos Aires on 2 June.\n\nThe Italian premi\u00e8re of ''Isabeau'' was held simultaneously at La Scala in Milan (conductor [[Tullio Serafin]]) and at [[La Fenice]] in [[Venice]] (conductor Mascagni) in 1912. On 28 March, he began to work on ''[[Parisina (Mascagni)|Parisina]]'' in Bellevue, near Paris, sometimes with his daughter Emi, his mistress Anna Lolli, and the librettist [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]].\n\n''Parisina'' was premiered in Milan on 15 December of that year. Almost all the important Italian composers of the time were present, among them Puccini, [[Umberto Giordano]] and [[Riccardo Zandonai]]. The new work was premiered in Livorno and Rome in 1914. On 28 July occurred the events that shortly led to World War I: Puccini and Mascagni were against the involvement of Italy in this war, in which Mascagni's son Dino was later made a prisoner.\n\nIn 1915 Mascagni wrote music for Nino Oxilia's movie ''[[Rapsodia Satanica]]''; the custom was for silent films to be accompanied live in a theater by organ, piano, or an orchestra, often using a prepared score (sometimes with original music) with cues for the conductor or musician. Mascagni had a quarrel regarding the rights of Louise de la Ram\u00e9e's ''Two Little Wooden Shoes ''(''I due Zoccoletti''), that inspired both Puccini and Mascagni. The subject was retained by Mascagni for ''[[Lodoletta]]''. The latter opera was premiered on 30 April 1917 in Rome.  The Livornese premi\u00e8re of the opera was on 28 July with [[Beniamino Gigli]] as Flammen.\n\n''[[S\u00ec (operetta)|S\u00ec]]'', Mascagni's operetta, which he had been manoeuvred into writing by the impresario [[Carlo Lombardo]], was premiered on 13 December in Rome.\n\n===1920\u201339===\nIn 1920 Mascagni composed ''[[Il piccolo Marat]]'', which was premiered in Rome on 2 May 1921, following by a premiere in [[Buenos Aires]] in September. The composer returned to South America for a tour beginning in May 1922.\n\nIn 1923, he composed ''[[Visione Lirica]]''. He moved to the [http://grandhotelplaza.com/ Grand Hotel Plaza] in Rome in 1927, a place he would not leave until his death.\n\nIn 1930, Mascagni conducted ''[[La boh\u00e8me]]'' in [[Torre del Lago]], as a homage to [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]], who had died in 1924. In 1931, ''Le maschere'' was performed at [[La Scala]].\n\n''[[Pinotta]]'' was premiered in [[Sanremo|San Remo]] on 23 March 1932.  He joined the PNF ([[Fascist]] party), following the example of many contemporary musicians, including [[Umberto Giordano|Giordano]].\n\n''[[Nerone (Mascagni)|Nerone]]'' was premi\u00e8red in Milan on 16 January 1935, followed by the premi\u00e8re in Livorno on 24 August.\n\nIn June 1936, Mascagni's son Dino died in [[Somalia]].\n\n===Last years===\n[[File:Roma - Lapide a Pietro Mascagni.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1|Plaque dedicated to Mascagni in the Albergo del Sole, [[Piazza della Rotonda]], Rome]]\nIn 1940, celebrations for the fiftieth anniversary of his most popular opera, ''Cavalleria rusticana'', took place all over Italy, often with Mascagni conducting. The opera was recorded for ''La Voce del padrone'' (\"His Master's Voice\") at La Scala under the direction of Mascagni, who recorded a special spoken introduction. EMI later reissued the recording on LP and CD.\n\nIn 1942, after an audience with [[Pope Pius XII]], newspapers quoted Mascagni, a [[Roman Catholic]], as saying that his [[tuberculosis]]-stricken niece was cured after receiving a rosary and silver medal blessed by the pope.<ref>''Miracles and visions may make Pius XII a Saint'', [[United Press International]], UPI, 9 October 1958,</ref>\n\nIn April 1943, Mascagni appeared for the last time at La Scala to conduct ''L'amico Fritz''. By that time he had to conduct sitting on a chair. The last season of Mascagni at the [[Teatro dell'Opera di Roma|Rome Opera]] (''Cavalleria rusticana'' and ''L'amico Fritz'') was 1944\u201345.\n\nMascagni died on 2 August 1945 in his apartment at the Grand Hotel Plaza in Rome. The funeral ceremony was on 4 August.  The Italian authorities were not present. In 1951, his body was transferred from Rome to Livorno, where Mascagni finally received an official homage. On 7 December 1963, the centenary of Mascagni's birth, a plaque was erected in Rome on the Albergo del Sole where Mascagni stayed during the premiere of ''Cavalleria rusticana''.\n\n==Selected works==\n\n===Operas===\n* ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' (17 May 1890 Teatro Costanzi, Rome) \n* ''[[L'amico Fritz]]'' (31 October 1891 Teatro Costanzi, Rome)\n* ''[[I Rantzau]]'' (10 November 1892 Teatro La Pergola, Florence)\n* ''[[Guglielmo Ratcliff]]'' (16 February 1895 Teatro alla Scala, Milan), composed between 1885 and the early 1890s \n* ''[[Silvano]]'' (25 March 1895 Teatro alla Scala, Milan)\n* ''[[Zanetto]]'' (2 March 1896 Liceo Musicale, Pesaro) \n* ''[[Iris (opera)|Iris]]'' (22 November 1898 Teatro Costanzi, Rome) \n* ''[[Le maschere]]'' (17 January 1901 Teatro Carlo Felice, Genoa \u2013 Teatro Regio, Turin \u2013 Teatro alla Scala, Milan \u2013 Teatro La Fenice, Venice \u2013 Teatro Filarmonico, Verona \u2013 Teatro Costanzi, Rome)\n* ''[[Amica (opera)|Amica]]'' (16 March 1905, Monte Carlo, in French)\n* ''[[Isabeau]]'' (2 June 1911 [[Teatro Coliseo]], [[Buenos Aires]])\n* ''[[Parisina (Mascagni)|Parisina]]'' (15 December 1913 Teatro alla Scala, Milan) \n* ''[[Lodoletta]]'' (30 April 1917 Teatro Costanzi, Rome) \n* ''[[Il piccolo Marat]]'' (2 May 1921 Teatro Costanzi, Rome)\n* ''[[Pinotta]]'' (23 March 1932 Casin\u00f2, San Remo), adapted from the [[cantata]] ''In filanda'' (1881)\n* ''[[Nerone (Mascagni)|Nerone]]'' (16 January 1935 Teatro alla Scala, Milan), with music written between the 1890s and the 1930s\n\n===Operetta===\n* ''[[S\u00ec (operetta)|S\u00ec]]'' (13 December 1919 [[Teatro Quirino]], Rome)\n\n===Sacred music===\n* ''Messa di Gloria in F major'' for soloists, chorus and orchestra (1888)\n\n===Orchestral music===\n* ''A Giacomo Leopardi'', [[cantata]] for voice ([[soprano]]) and orchestra (19 June 1898, Teatro Persiani, Recanati)\n* ''Il re a Napoli'', [[romanza]] for [[tenor]] and orchestra (18 March 1885 Teatro Municipale, Cremona)\n\n=== Projects contemplated ===\nDuring his long career, Mascagni contemplated writing many operas.

The cantata ''In Filanda'' became ''Pinotta'', and was proposed for the musical contest of the Conservatorio, but as his registration was late, it was not accepted.\n\nIn 1884, he composed ''Ballata'' for [[tenor]] and [[piano]]; ''M'ama non m'ama'', [[scherzo]] for [[soprano]] and piano; ''Messagio d'amore'', and ''Alla luna''.\n\nIn 1885, Mascagni composed ''Il Re a Napoli in Cremona'', a romance for tenor and [[orchestra]], on a text by [[Andrea Maffei]].  He left Milan without completing his studies. That year, he began touring as a conductor in the operetta companies of Vittorio Forl\u00ec, Alfonso and Ciro Scognamiglio, and, in [[Genoa]], the company of Luigi Arnaldo Vassallo.\n\nMascagni met the impresario [[Luigi Maresca]] in 1886 and started working with him. That December, Mascagni arrived in [[Cerignola]] with Maresca's company. He was accompanied by Argenide Marcellina Carbognani (Lina), his future wife. Helped by the mayor Giuseppe Cannone, Mascagni soon left the company of Maresca, though not without problems.\n\nHe was appointed as the master of music and singing of the new philharmonia of Cerignola. His reputation grew. He also gave piano lessons. In February 1888, he began work on the ''Messa di Gloria.'' In July, Casa Sonzogno announced in the ''Teatro Illustrato'' its second competition for a one-act opera. The following year, Mascagni completed his composition of ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' on 27 May and sent the manuscript to Milan.\n\n==Marriage and family==\nMascagni married Lina Carbognani on 3 February 1889. The next day their first son, Domenico Mascagni (\"Mim\u00ec\"), was born. Their son Dino was born on 3 January 1891. A daughter, Emi, was born in 1892.\n\n===1890\u201399===\n[[File:PietroMascagni1.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.7|Mascagni in c. 1890]]\nOn 21 February 1890, Mascagni was summoned to Rome to present his opera. The premi\u00e8re of ''Cavalleria rusticana'', winner of the Sonzogno contest, was held 17 May at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome. It had outstanding success, and the opera was soon performed in both the north and south of Italy: [[Florence]], [[Turin]], [[Bologna]], [[Palermo]], [[Milan]], [[Genoa]], [[Naples]], [[Venice]] and [[Trieste]].\n\nIn December, [[Gustav Mahler]] conducted the opera in [[Budapest]]. Soon thereafter, the cities of [[Munich]], [[Hamburg]], [[St. Petersburg]], [[Dresden]] and [[Buenos Aires]] welcomed the opera. In March 1891, it was sung in [[Vienna]]. At age 26, Mascagni had become internationally famous.\n\nMascagni premiered his ''[[L'amico Fritz]]'', his second most successful opera, on 31 October 1891 at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome. ''[[I Rantzau]]'' was premiered on 10 November at the Teatro La Pergola, in Florence, under his personal direction.\n\nThe composer next completed ''[[Silvano]] '' (1894). On 16 February 1895 he premiered  ''[[Guglielmo Ratcliff]]'' at the Teatro alla Scala of Milan. On 15 March ''Silvano'' was premiered at the same theatre. That year, Mascagni accepted the directorship of the [[Conservatorio Statale di Musica \"Gioachino Rossini\"|Liceo Rossini]] in [[Pesaro]] and moved his family there.\n\nOn 2 March 1896, Mascagni conducted the premi\u00e8re of ''[[Zanetto]]'' at the Liceo. He continued his composing and directing. On 29 June 1898 in [[Recanati]], Mascagni conducted the premi\u00e8re of a symphonic poem, ''[[A Giacomo Leopardi]]''. Mascagni began a collaboration with [[Luigi Illica]], a librettist. Their first work, ''[[Iris (opera)|Iris]],'' was premiered on 22 November at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome.\n\nMascagni's father died in May 1899.\n\n===1900\u201309===\n[[File:Amica.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.7|''Amica ''poster, 1905]]\nIn 1900, Mascagni toured Moscow and [[St. Petersburg]] and, on 17 January 1901, ''[[Le maschere]] ''was premiered in six Italian theaters.  [[Giuseppe Verdi]] died on 27 January and the following month Mascagni commemorated Verdi's passing. That same year, he conducted Verdi's ''[[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]]'' in Vienna.\n\nMascagni composed the [[incidental music]] for [[Hall Caine]]'s play, ''The Eternal City'' in August 1902; the premi\u00e8re of the play with Mascagni's music took place in London on 2 October.\n\nIn 1902 and 1903, he toured in Canada and in the United States, (in particular [[Montreal]], New York City, [[Philadelphia]], [[Boston]] and San Francisco), where he conducted many of his and other composers' works. The tour was mostly a fiasco, except for the visit to San Francisco where Mascagni was extremely well received.\n\nIn 1903, Mascagni left Pesaro after problems with the authorities. He became director of the ''Scuola Musicale Romana'', in Rome. In the same year he signed a contract with the French editor [[Paul de Choudens]].\n\n[[Amica (opera)|''Amica'']], based on a poem by Choudens with French libretto by [[Paul Collin]],<ref name = \"Flury\">{{cite book | last=Flury | first=Roger | coauthors= | title=Pietro Mascagni - A Bio-Bibliography | location=London | publisher=Greenwood Press | year=2001 | isbn=0-313-29662-6}}</ref> was premiered on 16 March 1905, in Monte-Carlo. That year, he had disputes with [[Ruggiero Leoncavallo]] and [[Giacomo Puccini]]. He also had the Livornese premi\u00e8re of ''Le maschere''.\n\nMascagni was director of the Costanzi for the season beginning in August 1909.\n\n===1910\u201319===\n[[File:Pietro Mascagni Vanity Fair 17 April 1912.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.7|Mascagni caricatured in [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]], 1912]]\nOn 4 April 1910, Mascagni began a relationship with Anna Lolli. In October he was reconciled with Puccini.\n\nMascagni ceased his activity as director of the Scuola Musicale Romana in 1911. That May he left for [[Buenos Aires]], beginning a seven-month tour in South America. The premi\u00e8re of ''[[Isabeau]]'' took place in Buenos Aires on 2 June.\n\nThe Italian premi\u00e8re of ''Isabeau'' was held simultaneously at La Scala in Milan (conductor [[Tullio Serafin]]) and at [[La Fenice]] in [[Venice]] (conductor Mascagni) in 1912. On 28 March, he began to work on ''[[Parisina (Mascagni)|Parisina]]'' in Bellevue, near Paris, sometimes with his daughter Emi, his mistress Anna Lolli, and the librettist [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]].\n\n''Parisina'' was premiered in Milan on 15 December of that year. Almost all the important Italian composers of the time were present, among them Puccini, [[Umberto Giordano]] and [[Riccardo Zandonai]]. The new work was premiered in Livorno and Rome in 1914. On 28 July occurred the events that shortly led to World War I: Puccini and Mascagni were against the involvement of Italy in this war, in which Mascagni's son Dino was later made a prisoner.\n\nIn 1915 Mascagni wrote music for Nino Oxilia's movie ''[[Rapsodia Satanica]]''; the custom was for silent films to be accompanied live in a theater by organ, piano, or an orchestra, often using a prepared score (sometimes with original music) with cues for the conductor or musician. Mascagni had a quarrel regarding the rights of Louise de la Ram\u00e9e's ''Two Little Wooden Shoes ''(''I due Zoccoletti''), that inspired both Puccini and Mascagni. The subject was retained by Mascagni for ''[[Lodoletta]]''. The latter opera was premiered on 30 April 1917 in Rome.  The Livornese premi\u00e8re of the opera was on 28 July with [[Beniamino Gigli]] as Flammen.\n\n''[[S\u00ec (operetta)|S\u00ec]]'', Mascagni's operetta, which he had been manoeuvred into writing by the impresario [[Carlo Lombardo]], was premiered on 13 December in Rome.\n\n===1920\u201339===\nIn 1920 Mascagni composed ''[[Il piccolo Marat]]'', which was premiered in Rome on 2 May 1921, following by a premiere in [[Buenos Aires]] in September. The composer returned to South America for a tour beginning in May 1922.\n\nIn 1923, he composed ''[[Visione Lirica]]''. He moved to the [http://grandhotelplaza.com/ Grand Hotel Plaza] in Rome in 1927, a place he would not leave until his death.\n\nIn 1930, Mascagni conducted ''[[La boh\u00e8me]]'' in [[Torre del Lago]], as a homage to [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]], who had died in 1924. In 1931, ''Le maschere'' was performed at [[La Scala]].\n\n''[[Pinotta]]'' was premiered in [[Sanremo|San Remo]] on 23 March 1932.  He joined the PNF ([[Fascist]] party), following the example of many contemporary musicians, including [[Umberto Giordano|Giordano]].\n\n''[[Nerone (Mascagni)|Nerone]]'' was premi\u00e8red in Milan on 16 January 1935, followed by the premi\u00e8re in Livorno on 24 August.\n\nIn June 1936, Mascagni's son Dino died in [[Somalia]].\n\n===Last years===\n[[File:Roma - Lapide a Pietro Mascagni.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1|Plaque dedicated to Mascagni in the Albergo del Sole, [[Piazza della Rotonda]], Rome]]\nIn 1940, celebrations for the fiftieth anniversary of his most popular opera, ''Cavalleria rusticana'', took place all over Italy, often with Mascagni conducting. The opera was recorded for ''La Voce del padrone'' (\"His Master's Voice\") at La Scala under the direction of Mascagni, who recorded a special spoken introduction. EMI later reissued the recording on LP and CD.\n\nIn 1942, after an audience with [[Pope Pius XII]], newspapers quoted Mascagni, a [[Roman Catholic]], as saying that his [[tuberculosis]]-stricken niece was cured after receiving a rosary and silver medal blessed by the pope.<ref>''Miracles and visions may make Pius XII a Saint'', [[United Press International]], UPI, 9 October 1958,</ref>\n\nIn April 1943, Mascagni appeared for the last time at La Scala to conduct ''L'amico Fritz''. By that time he had to conduct sitting on a chair. The last season of Mascagni at the [[Teatro dell'Opera di Roma|Rome Opera]] (''Cavalleria rusticana'' and ''L'amico Fritz'') was 1944\u201345.\n\nMascagni died on 2 August 1945 in his apartment at the Grand Hotel Plaza in Rome. The funeral ceremony was on 4 August.  The Italian authorities were not present. In 1951, his body was transferred from Rome to Livorno, where Mascagni finally received an official homage. On 7 December 1963, the centenary of Mascagni's birth, a plaque was erected in Rome on the Albergo del Sole where Mascagni stayed during the premiere of ''Cavalleria rusticana''.\n\n==Selected works==\n\n===Operas===\n* ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' (17 May 1890 Teatro Costanzi, Rome) \n* ''[[L'amico Fritz]]'' (31 October 1891 Teatro Costanzi, Rome)\n* ''[[I Rantzau]]'' (10 November 1892 Teatro La Pergola, Florence)\n* ''[[Guglielmo Ratcliff]]'' (16 February 1895 Teatro alla Scala, Milan), composed between 1885 and the early 1890s \n* ''[[Silvano]]'' (25 March 1895 Teatro alla Scala, Milan)\n* ''[[Zanetto]]'' (2 March 1896 Liceo Musicale, Pesaro) \n* ''[[Iris (opera)|Iris]]'' (22 November 1898 Teatro Costanzi, Rome) \n* ''[[Le maschere]]'' (17 January 1901 Teatro Carlo Felice, Genoa \u2013 Teatro Regio, Turin \u2013 Teatro alla Scala, Milan \u2013 Teatro La Fenice, Venice \u2013 Teatro Filarmonico, Verona \u2013 Teatro Costanzi, Rome)\n* ''[[Amica (opera)|Amica]]'' (16 March 1905, Monte Carlo, in French)\n* ''[[Isabeau]]'' (2 June 1911 [[Teatro Coliseo]], [[Buenos Aires]])\n* ''[[Parisina (Mascagni)|Parisina]]'' (15 December 1913 Teatro alla Scala, Milan) \n* ''[[Lodoletta]]'' (30 April 1917 Teatro Costanzi, Rome) \n* ''[[Il piccolo Marat]]'' (2 May 1921 Teatro Costanzi, Rome)\n* ''[[Pinotta]]'' (23 March 1932 Casin\u00f2, San Remo), adapted from the [[cantata]] ''In filanda'' (1881)\n* ''[[Nerone (Mascagni)|Nerone]]'' (16 January 1935 Teatro alla Scala, Milan), with music written between the 1890s and the 1930s\n\n===Operetta===\n* ''[[S\u00ec (operetta)|S\u00ec]]'' (13 December 1919 [[Teatro Quirino]], Rome)\n\n===Sacred music===\n* ''Messa di Gloria in F major'' for soloists, chorus and orchestra (1888)\n\n===Orchestral music===\n* ''A Giacomo Leopardi'', [[cantata]] for voice ([[soprano]]) and orchestra (19 June 1898, Teatro Persiani, Recanati)\n* ''Il re a Napoli'', [[romanza]] for [[tenor]] and orchestra (18 March 1885 Teatro Municipale, Cremona)\n\n=== Projects contemplated ===\nDuring his long career, Mascagni contemplated writing many operas.

The original section between Auckland and Westfield via Newmarket later ceased to be part of the NIMT: Auckland to Newmarket became the [[Auckland-Newmarket Line]], and Newmarket to Westfield became part of the [[North Auckland Line]] (NAL) which runs between Whangarei and Westfield.\n\nIn the late 1930s, bridges replaced [[level crossing]]s at Ohinewai, [[Taupiri]] and [[Ng\u0101ruaw\u0101hia#Hopuhopu|Hopuhopu]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19380127.2.167|title=Level Crossings|date=1938|work=New Zealand Herald|access-date=15 October 2017|pages=15}}</ref>\n[[File:Wellington Motorway.jpg|thumb|In the 1930s, the Wellington end was deviated from Wellington to Tawa Flat by the [[Tawa Flat deviation]], including two long tunnels. The deviation is the centre two tracks, with the [[Wairarapa Line]]'s Ngauranga station in the background, alongside [[New Zealand State Highway 1|State Highway 1]].]]\nThe double track [[Tawa Flat deviation]] opened to goods trains on 22 July 1935 and to passenger trains on 19 June 1937, bypassing the original single track WMR line between Wellington and [[Tawa, New Zealand|Tawa]]. With a pair of tunnels under the Wellington hills, the deviation alleviated issues with more and heavier freight traffic on the steep and twisting original route where long sections at 1 in 60 gradient required banker engines. The Wellington to Johnsonville section of the original line was retained as the [[Johnsonville Line]] and the Johnsonville to Tawa section closed.\n\nThe sections from Plimmerton to South Junction, north of Pukerua Bay and Muri, and North Junction to Paekakariki were duplicated in 1940. From 24 July 1940 electrification at 1500 V DC of the southern section of the NIMT from Wellington to Paekakariki was completed.  The [[Tawa Flat deviation]] has a long tunnel (Tawa No 2)  not suitable for steam operation because of excessive smoke (although steam trains were temporarily operated in the new deviation from 1935). A Centralised Train Control (CTC) system was installed in 1940, so that new signal boxes were not required and five stations between Tawa and Pukerua Bay no longer had to be continually staffed for Tablet operation; see [[Kapiti Line#Duplication|Kapiti Line]]. Electrification eliminated the need to relieve the steep (1 in 57) gradients from Plimmerton to the Pukerua Bay summit by a deviation to the east and allowed more frequent suburban passenger trains (and allowed suburban electric multiple units to run on this section from September 1949).\n[[File:Electric Locomotives Near Paekakariki.jpg|thumb|[[New Zealand EW class locomotive|EW]]1805 hauling [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC]] 4611 near Paekakariki on the electrified Wellington section.

Duplication from Tawa to Porirua opened on 15 December 1957, from Porirua to Paremata on 7 November 1960, and Paremata to Plimmerton on 16 October 1961. The section between [[Porirua]] and [[Plimmerton]] was straightened in conjunction with the duplication by reclaiming land along the eastern shore of Porirua Harbour.\n\nBetween 1964 and 1966 a deviation away from the centre of Palmerston North via the [[Milson deviation]] on the edge of the city.\n\nIn 1967 the floors of the tunnels on the WMR section between Paekakariki and Pukerua Bay were lowered to enable the [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|DA class]] locomotives to travel all the way to Wellington.\n\nBetween 1973 and 1981 the major [[Mangaweka deviation]] in the central section between [[Mangaweka]] and Utiku was built, with three viaducts, all over 70m tall, crossing the Rangitikei and Kawhatau rivers.\n\nThe central section from Te Rapa near Hamilton to Palmerston North was electrified at 25 kV AC between 1984 and 1988 as part of the [[Think Big]] government energy programme. Some tunnels were opened out or bypassed by deviations while in others clearances were increased, and curves eased. The section between [[Ohakune]] and Horopito was realigned with three viaducts replaced to handle higher loads and speeds.

Wellington's urban network is electrified at ([[1500 V DC railway electrification|1500 V DC]]); as formerly used in other sections of the New Zealand  network. In Wellington the operating voltage has been increased to 1700 V DC since the full introduction of the [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|Matangi EMU]], to increase the power available.  \n \nElectrification of the NIMT was mooted by electrical engineer [[Evan Parry]] in the first volume of the ''New Zealand Journal of Science and Technology'' in November 1918. In light of a national coal shortage following [[World War I]], Parry argued that the network was under great strain due to ever-increasing volumes of freight, and the use of steam traction was partly to blame. Parry also noted that there was great potential for cheap hydro-electricity generation in the central North Island to power electrification.\n\nThe first part of the NIMT to be electrified was the [[Wellington]]\u2013[[Paekakariki railway station|Paekakariki]] section via the [[Tawa Flat deviation]] that was completed on 24 July 1940. This was largely to prevent smoke nuisance in the 4.3&nbsp;km No. 2 tunnel, and to provide for banking on the Paekakariki to Pukerua Bay section. Electric traction in this section is now used only by [[Transdev Wellington]] for Metlink suburban passenger services on the [[Kapiti Line]], and was extended to [[Paraparaumu railway station|Paraparaumu]] on 7 May 1983 and [[Waikanae railway station|Waikanae]] on 20 February 2011. Funded by the [[Greater Wellington Regional Council]], the extension to Waikanae coincided with the delivery of new [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|FP class Matangi]] [[electric multiple unit]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/index.php?page=wellington-projects|title=KiwiRail \u2013 Wellington Projects|date=22 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722185555/http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/index.php?page=wellington-projects|archivedate=22 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the Second World War railway services suffered due to skill and coal shortages. Skilled staff sought employment opportunities elsewhere in the economy. From 1948 to 1951 the General Manager of the Railways Department, Francis William Aickin, advocated electrification of the entire line, despite protests from his engineering staff. Aickin had previously been Staff Superintendent and Chief Legal Advisor to the Department, and considered using diesel locomotives for trains on the NIMT to be too expensive. He turned his attention to electrification, mainly because he saw that it could relieve the coal situation and prevent high expenditure on imported fuels.\n\nHe commissioned a study into electrification, which concluded that a low-frequency AC system could be cheaper than 1500 V DC, the system in use in Wellington. Aickin sent a technical mission of four senior officers overseas in March 1949 and travelled overseas himself to negotiate a tentative contract with a British construction company. The Chief Mechanical Engineer and Chief Accountant specified and costed the system and Aickin was able to complete a substantial report justifying the NIMT electrification and submit it to the Government.\n\nOfficers from [[New Zealand Treasury]] and the [[New Zealand Ministry of Works|Ministry of Works]] and two experts from [[Sweden]] (Thelander and Edenius) commented on the proposal and in December 1950 the Government granted approval in principle and agreed to appoint Thelander as a consultant. However, Aickin fell out with the then National Government and retired as General Manager in July 1951. With the change in regime, the electrification proposal disappeared.\n\nA key assumption of Aickin's report was that traffic on the NIMT would grow by 50% from 1948 to 1961. Since a diesel-electric locomotive was in fact a travelling power station, the savings through electrification compared to diesel could be regarded as the difference between the cost of buying bulk electrical energy generated substantially from New Zealand resources and the cost of generating electricity in a small plant using imported diesel fuel.\n\nHowever, the Royal Commission on Railways created following Aickin's tenure rejected the report's findings. Aickin's successor, H.C. Lusty, revised the tentative contract with [[English Electric]] to specify [[NZR DF class (1954)|DF]] diesel-electric locomotives. They were later found to be unreliable, and only ten were supplied. 42 [[New Zealand DG and DH class locomotive|DG]] locomotives were supplied instead for secondary lines. For main lines including the NIMT, [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|D<sup>A</sup> class]] diesel-electric locomotives were ordered from General Motors.\n\nThe {{convert|411|km|mi|abbr=on}} section between [[Palmerston North]] and [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] was electrified at 25 kV 50&nbsp;Hz [[alternating current|AC]], opened on 24 June 1988<ref name=\"nzro_winter_1988\">{{cite journal|journal=New Zealand Railway Observer|title=North Island Main Trunk Electrified|date=Autumn 1988|publisher=[[New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society]]|issn=0028-8624|volume=45| issue =  1|number=|page=49|author=Tom McGavin}}</ref> as one of the [[Robert Muldoon|Muldoon]] [[Third National Government of New Zealand|National Government's]] \"[[Think Big]]\" energy development projects. An overall cost in excess of $100 million had been projected, with some 40% being for the locomotives, but the final cost was about $250 million. The economics of the project was greatly undermined by the fall of the price of oil in the 1980s and the deregulation of land transport, which removed the long-distance monopoly NZR held when the cost-benefit report was written.\n[[File:EF30163+Overlander NearWaiouru 22March2003 JChristianson.jpg|thumb|[[New Zealand EF class locomotive|EF]]30163 hauling The [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] on the [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV AC]] [[Railway electrification system|electrified]] section in 2003.]]\nThe electrification of the section, which had its genesis in a study group set up in June 1974 to report on measures to be taken to cope with increasing rail traffic volumes, received approval in 1980. This led to a technical study carried out with assistance from the Japanese [[Railway Technical Research Institute]]. The report stated that track capacity would be increased by electrification because such traction is faster and able to move more freight at once. The report stated, for example, that whereas a diesel locomotive could haul 720-tonne trains at {{convert|27|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} up the [[Raurimu Spiral]], an electric locomotive could haul 1100/1200-tonne trains at {{convert|45|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, cutting 3\u20135 hours off journey times. Less fuel would be needed and employing regenerative braking in electric locomotives lowers the fuel consumption further.\n\nElectrification's advantages were reflected in the economic evaluation in the report, which showed a rate of return of 18%. Sensitivity analysis showed that this high rate of return gave the project robustness against lower traffic volumes than expected (the return remained positive even if traffic fell), against significant increases in construction cost, and against lower than expected rises in the diesel fuel price.\n\nPart of the project included replacing the copper wire communications system with a new [[fiber optic|fibre optic]] communications cable (due to interference caused by AC power with the DC copper wire system) between Wellington and Auckland. In 1994 New Zealand Rail Limited sold the cable to [[Clear Communications]] for telephone traffic, leasing part of it back for signalling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canterbury.cyberplace.org.nz/community/CAFCA/cafca94/sept94.html|title=September 1994&nbsp;decisions|publisher=[[Campaign Against Foreign Control of Aotearoa]]}}</ref>\n\nProposals to [[Auckland railway electrification|electrify the Auckland suburban rail network]] dated back to the 1960s,{{sfn|Churchman|1991|p=30}} they mainly coincided with proposals to electrify the NIMT in its entirety.

In 1932 the [[4-8-4]] [[NZR K class (1932)|K class]] was introduced, and later improved in 1939 with the [[NZR Ka class|K<sup>A</sup>]].\n\nThe introduction of the English Electric [[NZR DF class (1954)|D<sup>F</sup> class]] in 1954 began the end of the steam era, and in 1955 with the introduction of the [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|D<sup>A</sup>]] major withdrawals of steam locomotives began. 1972 saw the introduction of [[New Zealand DX class locomotive|D<sup>X</sup>]] locomotives and the [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]] railcars: the latter remained in service between Auckland and Wellington until 1991.\n\nWith electrification and the introduction of the [[New Zealand EF class locomotive|EF class]] electric locomotives in the late 1980s, the DX class was mainly reassigned to other areas of the network, including hauling coal on the [[Midland Line, New Zealand|Midland Line]] in the [[South Island]]. Since then services between Te Rapa and Palmerston North have been worked mainly by the electrics, although some services are still diesel operated, such as those originating from or terminating on other lines, or originating from within the central section, like the paper pulp freight trains from Karioi.\n\nAs of May 2016, regular rolling stock on the NIMT include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#f9f9f9;\"\n!

The daily \"Express\" left earlier in the evening, followed by the \"Limited\", which had fewer stops for passengers.\n\nBetween 1963 and 1968 daytime trains were called the [[Scenic Daylight]]. In 1968, an [[NZR RM class|RM class]] [[NZR RM class (88 seater)|88-seater]] [[railcar]] was refurbished and repainted in a distinctive blue scheme that led to it being nicknamed the Blue Streak. It initially operated an unsuccessful service between [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and Auckland in early 1968, and was transferred to the Auckland-Wellington run on 23 September 1968.\n[[File:Tolldc4093.jpg|thumb|A [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC]] hauls the now replaced [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] long-distance passenger train between Auckland and Wellington.]]\nIn 1971 [[New Zealand Railways Department|NZR]] introduced the [[Silver Star (NZR train)|Silver Star]], a luxury sleeper train. The service was not economically viable, and was withdrawn in 1979. Much more successful was the [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]], a daytime [[railcar]] service, introduced in 1972 to replace the \"Blue Streak\". This service was withdrawn in 1991 and replaced by [[Overlander (train)|The Overlander]].\n\nIn conjunction with the introduction of the carriage train Overlander service, the Silver Fern railcars were redeployed to start new services between Tauranga and Auckland \u2013 [[Kaimai Express]], and Auckland and Rotorua \u2013 [[Geyserland Express]], in 1991. In 2000 a new commuter service called the [[Waikato Connection]] was introduced between Hamilton and Auckland and ran in conjunction with the services to Tauranga and Rotorua until all three services were cancelled in 2001.\n\nOn 25 July 2006 Toll announced that the Overlander would cease at the end of September 2006, but on 28 September 2006 the train's continuation on a limited timetable was announced.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=10403445| title=Overlander to continue running| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] | date=28 September 2006| accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref> It ran daily during the summer months and thrice-weekly for the balance of the year.\n\nIn 2012 KiwiRail announced the Overlander would be replaced by the [[Northern Explorer]], with new [[New Zealand AK class carriage|AK class carriages]] to provide a premium tourist train on a quicker timetable with fewer stops. It commenced on Monday 25 June 2012, and consists of one train running from Auckland to Wellington on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and Wellington to Auckland on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays. It has fewer stops than the Overlander, stopping only at Papakura, Hamilton, [[Otorohanga]], National Park, Ohakune, Palmerston North and Paraparaumu.\n\nThe [[Capital Connection (train)|Capital Connection]] commuter train operates between [[Palmerston North]] and Wellington.\n\nBoth KiwiRail and private enthusiast operators such as the Railway Enthusiasts Society, Mainline Steam and Steam Inc operate charter trains.\n\n===Auckland suburban===\n[[File:Britomart Outside Facade.jpg|thumb|The northern terminus of the NIMT, [[Britomart Transport Centre]].]]\n{{main|Public transport in Auckland|Auckland railway electrification}}\nSuburban trains run on the NIMT at regular intervals as follows:\n\n[[Eastern Line, Auckland|Eastern Line]] (Manukau to Britomart via Glen Innes) trains run on the NIMT between Puhinui and Britomart.\n\n[[Southern Line, Auckland|Southern Line]] (Papakura to Britomart via Otahuhu and Newmarket) trains run on the NIMT from Papakura to [[Westfield Junction]]. They then run on the [[North Auckland Line]] to Newmarket, and the [[Newmarket Line]] to the vicinity of [[Quay Park]], where they rejoin the NIMT only for the short section (about 500 metres) into Britomart. A diesel train shuttle service runs on the NIMT between Pukekohe and Papakura.\n\n[[Onehunga Line]] and [[Western Line, Auckland|Western Line]] trains use the NIMT only for the short section (about 500 metres) from the vicinity of Quay Park into Britomart.\n\n===Wellington suburban===\n[[File:Wellington Railway Station by night.

With a pair of tunnels under the Wellington hills, the deviation alleviated issues with more and heavier freight traffic on the steep and twisting original route where long sections at 1 in 60 gradient required banker engines. The Wellington to Johnsonville section of the original line was retained as the [[Johnsonville Line]] and the Johnsonville to Tawa section closed.\n\nThe sections from Plimmerton to South Junction, north of Pukerua Bay and Muri, and North Junction to Paekakariki were duplicated in 1940. From 24 July 1940 electrification at 1500 V DC of the southern section of the NIMT from Wellington to Paekakariki was completed.  The [[Tawa Flat deviation]] has a long tunnel (Tawa No 2)  not suitable for steam operation because of excessive smoke (although steam trains were temporarily operated in the new deviation from 1935). A Centralised Train Control (CTC) system was installed in 1940, so that new signal boxes were not required and five stations between Tawa and Pukerua Bay no longer had to be continually staffed for Tablet operation; see [[Kapiti Line#Duplication|Kapiti Line]]. Electrification eliminated the need to relieve the steep (1 in 57) gradients from Plimmerton to the Pukerua Bay summit by a deviation to the east and allowed more frequent suburban passenger trains (and allowed suburban electric multiple units to run on this section from September 1949).\n[[File:Electric Locomotives Near Paekakariki.jpg|thumb|[[New Zealand EW class locomotive|EW]]1805 hauling [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC]] 4611 near Paekakariki on the electrified Wellington section.

Some tunnels were opened out or bypassed by deviations while in others clearances were increased, and curves eased. The section between [[Ohakune]] and Horopito was realigned with three viaducts replaced to handle higher loads and speeds. The most notable bridge replaced was the curved metal viaduct at Hapuawhenua by a modern concrete structure, though the original has been restored as a tourist attraction.\n\nIn 2009\u201310, the 1.5&nbsp;km section of line between Wellington Junction and Distant Junction was rebuilt from double track to triple track, to ease peak-time congestion.\n\nIn February 2011 duplication between Paekakariki and Waikanae was completed as part of the upgrade and expansion of the Wellington suburban network; see [[Kapiti Line]] for more information.\n\nIn 2012\u201313 four bridges near Rangiriri between Auckland and Hamilton were replaced.

Wellington's urban network is electrified at ([[1500 V DC railway electrification|1500 V DC]]); as formerly used in other sections of the New Zealand  network. In Wellington the operating voltage has been increased to 1700 V DC since the full introduction of the [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|Matangi EMU]], to increase the power available.  \n \nElectrification of the NIMT was mooted by electrical engineer [[Evan Parry]] in the first volume of the ''New Zealand Journal of Science and Technology'' in November 1918. In light of a national coal shortage following [[World War I]], Parry argued that the network was under great strain due to ever-increasing volumes of freight, and the use of steam traction was partly to blame. Parry also noted that there was great potential for cheap hydro-electricity generation in the central North Island to power electrification.\n\nThe first part of the NIMT to be electrified was the [[Wellington]]\u2013[[Paekakariki railway station|Paekakariki]] section via the [[Tawa Flat deviation]] that was completed on 24 July 1940. This was largely to prevent smoke nuisance in the 4.3&nbsp;km No. 2 tunnel, and to provide for banking on the Paekakariki to Pukerua Bay section. Electric traction in this section is now used only by [[Transdev Wellington]] for Metlink suburban passenger services on the [[Kapiti Line]], and was extended to [[Paraparaumu railway station|Paraparaumu]] on 7 May 1983 and [[Waikanae railway station|Waikanae]] on 20 February 2011. Funded by the [[Greater Wellington Regional Council]], the extension to Waikanae coincided with the delivery of new [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|FP class Matangi]] [[electric multiple unit]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/index.php?page=wellington-projects|title=KiwiRail \u2013 Wellington Projects|date=22 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722185555/http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/index.php?page=wellington-projects|archivedate=22 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the Second World War railway services suffered due to skill and coal shortages. Skilled staff sought employment opportunities elsewhere in the economy. From 1948 to 1951 the General Manager of the Railways Department, Francis William Aickin, advocated electrification of the entire line, despite protests from his engineering staff. Aickin had previously been Staff Superintendent and Chief Legal Advisor to the Department, and considered using diesel locomotives for trains on the NIMT to be too expensive. He turned his attention to electrification, mainly because he saw that it could relieve the coal situation and prevent high expenditure on imported fuels.\n\nHe commissioned a study into electrification, which concluded that a low-frequency AC system could be cheaper than 1500 V DC, the system in use in Wellington. Aickin sent a technical mission of four senior officers overseas in March 1949 and travelled overseas himself to negotiate a tentative contract with a British construction company. The Chief Mechanical Engineer and Chief Accountant specified and costed the system and Aickin was able to complete a substantial report justifying the NIMT electrification and submit it to the Government.\n\nOfficers from [[New Zealand Treasury]] and the [[New Zealand Ministry of Works|Ministry of Works]] and two experts from [[Sweden]] (Thelander and Edenius) commented on the proposal and in December 1950 the Government granted approval in principle and agreed to appoint Thelander as a consultant. However, Aickin fell out with the then National Government and retired as General Manager in July 1951. With the change in regime, the electrification proposal disappeared.\n\nA key assumption of Aickin's report was that traffic on the NIMT would grow by 50% from 1948 to 1961. Since a diesel-electric locomotive was in fact a travelling power station, the savings through electrification compared to diesel could be regarded as the difference between the cost of buying bulk electrical energy generated substantially from New Zealand resources and the cost of generating electricity in a small plant using imported diesel fuel.\n\nHowever, the Royal Commission on Railways created following Aickin's tenure rejected the report's findings. Aickin's successor, H.C. Lusty, revised the tentative contract with [[English Electric]] to specify [[NZR DF class (1954)|DF]] diesel-electric locomotives. They were later found to be unreliable, and only ten were supplied. 42 [[New Zealand DG and DH class locomotive|DG]] locomotives were supplied instead for secondary lines. For main lines including the NIMT, [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|D<sup>A</sup> class]] diesel-electric locomotives were ordered from General Motors.\n\nThe {{convert|411|km|mi|abbr=on}} section between [[Palmerston North]] and [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] was electrified at 25 kV 50&nbsp;Hz [[alternating current|AC]], opened on 24 June 1988<ref name=\"nzro_winter_1988\">{{cite journal|journal=New Zealand Railway Observer|title=North Island Main Trunk Electrified|date=Autumn 1988|publisher=[[New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society]]|issn=0028-8624|volume=45| issue =  1|number=|page=49|author=Tom McGavin}}</ref> as one of the [[Robert Muldoon|Muldoon]] [[Third National Government of New Zealand|National Government's]] \"[[Think Big]]\" energy development projects. An overall cost in excess of $100 million had been projected, with some 40% being for the locomotives, but the final cost was about $250 million. The economics of the project was greatly undermined by the fall of the price of oil in the 1980s and the deregulation of land transport, which removed the long-distance monopoly NZR held when the cost-benefit report was written.\n[[File:EF30163+Overlander NearWaiouru 22March2003 JChristianson.jpg|thumb|[[New Zealand EF class locomotive|EF]]30163 hauling The [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] on the [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV AC]] [[Railway electrification system|electrified]] section in 2003.]]\nThe electrification of the section, which had its genesis in a study group set up in June 1974 to report on measures to be taken to cope with increasing rail traffic volumes, received approval in 1980. This led to a technical study carried out with assistance from the Japanese [[Railway Technical Research Institute]]. The report stated that track capacity would be increased by electrification because such traction is faster and able to move more freight at once. The report stated, for example, that whereas a diesel locomotive could haul 720-tonne trains at {{convert|27|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} up the [[Raurimu Spiral]], an electric locomotive could haul 1100/1200-tonne trains at {{convert|45|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, cutting 3\u20135 hours off journey times. Less fuel would be needed and employing regenerative braking in electric locomotives lowers the fuel consumption further.\n\nElectrification's advantages were reflected in the economic evaluation in the report, which showed a rate of return of 18%. Sensitivity analysis showed that this high rate of return gave the project robustness against lower traffic volumes than expected (the return remained positive even if traffic fell), against significant increases in construction cost, and against lower than expected rises in the diesel fuel price.\n\nPart of the project included replacing the copper wire communications system with a new [[fiber optic|fibre optic]] communications cable (due to interference caused by AC power with the DC copper wire system) between Wellington and Auckland. In 1994 New Zealand Rail Limited sold the cable to [[Clear Communications]] for telephone traffic, leasing part of it back for signalling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canterbury.cyberplace.org.nz/community/CAFCA/cafca94/sept94.html|title=September 1994&nbsp;decisions|publisher=[[Campaign Against Foreign Control of Aotearoa]]}}</ref>\n\nProposals to [[Auckland railway electrification|electrify the Auckland suburban rail network]] dated back to the 1960s,{{sfn|Churchman|1991|p=30}} they mainly coincided with proposals to electrify the NIMT in its entirety.

In 1932 the [[4-8-4]] [[NZR K class (1932)|K class]] was introduced, and later improved in 1939 with the [[NZR Ka class|K<sup>A</sup>]].\n\nThe introduction of the English Electric [[NZR DF class (1954)|D<sup>F</sup> class]] in 1954 began the end of the steam era, and in 1955 with the introduction of the [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|D<sup>A</sup>]] major withdrawals of steam locomotives began. 1972 saw the introduction of [[New Zealand DX class locomotive|D<sup>X</sup>]] locomotives and the [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]] railcars: the latter remained in service between Auckland and Wellington until 1991.\n\nWith electrification and the introduction of the [[New Zealand EF class locomotive|EF class]] electric locomotives in the late 1980s, the DX class was mainly reassigned to other areas of the network, including hauling coal on the [[Midland Line, New Zealand|Midland Line]] in the [[South Island]]. Since then services between Te Rapa and Palmerston North have been worked mainly by the electrics, although some services are still diesel operated, such as those originating from or terminating on other lines, or originating from within the central section, like the paper pulp freight trains from Karioi.\n\nAs of May 2016, regular rolling stock on the NIMT include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#f9f9f9;\"\n!

The daily \"Express\" left earlier in the evening, followed by the \"Limited\", which had fewer stops for passengers.\n\nBetween 1963 and 1968 daytime trains were called the [[Scenic Daylight]]. In 1968, an [[NZR RM class|RM class]] [[NZR RM class (88 seater)|88-seater]] [[railcar]] was refurbished and repainted in a distinctive blue scheme that led to it being nicknamed the Blue Streak. It initially operated an unsuccessful service between [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and Auckland in early 1968, and was transferred to the Auckland-Wellington run on 23 September 1968.\n[[File:Tolldc4093.jpg|thumb|A [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC]] hauls the now replaced [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] long-distance passenger train between Auckland and Wellington.]]\nIn 1971 [[New Zealand Railways Department|NZR]] introduced the [[Silver Star (NZR train)|Silver Star]], a luxury sleeper train. The service was not economically viable, and was withdrawn in 1979. Much more successful was the [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]], a daytime [[railcar]] service, introduced in 1972 to replace the \"Blue Streak\". This service was withdrawn in 1991 and replaced by [[Overlander (train)|The Overlander]].\n\nIn conjunction with the introduction of the carriage train Overlander service, the Silver Fern railcars were redeployed to start new services between Tauranga and Auckland \u2013 [[Kaimai Express]], and Auckland and Rotorua \u2013 [[Geyserland Express]], in 1991. In 2000 a new commuter service called the [[Waikato Connection]] was introduced between Hamilton and Auckland and ran in conjunction with the services to Tauranga and Rotorua until all three services were cancelled in 2001.\n\nOn 25 July 2006 Toll announced that the Overlander would cease at the end of September 2006, but on 28 September 2006 the train's continuation on a limited timetable was announced.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=10403445| title=Overlander to continue running| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] | date=28 September 2006| accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref> It ran daily during the summer months and thrice-weekly for the balance of the year.\n\nIn 2012 KiwiRail announced the Overlander would be replaced by the [[Northern Explorer]], with new [[New Zealand AK class carriage|AK class carriages]] to provide a premium tourist train on a quicker timetable with fewer stops. It commenced on Monday 25 June 2012, and consists of one train running from Auckland to Wellington on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and Wellington to Auckland on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays. It has fewer stops than the Overlander, stopping only at Papakura, Hamilton, [[Otorohanga]], National Park, Ohakune, Palmerston North and Paraparaumu.\n\nThe [[Capital Connection (train)|Capital Connection]] commuter train operates between [[Palmerston North]] and Wellington.\n\nBoth KiwiRail and private enthusiast operators such as the Railway Enthusiasts Society, Mainline Steam and Steam Inc operate charter trains.\n\n===Auckland suburban===\n[[File:Britomart Outside Facade.jpg|thumb|The northern terminus of the NIMT, [[Britomart Transport Centre]].]]\n{{main|Public transport in Auckland|Auckland railway electrification}}\nSuburban trains run on the NIMT at regular intervals as follows:\n\n[[Eastern Line, Auckland|Eastern Line]] (Manukau to Britomart via Glen Innes) trains run on the NIMT between Puhinui and Britomart.\n\n[[Southern Line, Auckland|Southern Line]] (Papakura to Britomart via Otahuhu and Newmarket) trains run on the NIMT from Papakura to [[Westfield Junction]]. They then run on the [[North Auckland Line]] to Newmarket, and the [[Newmarket Line]] to the vicinity of [[Quay Park]], where they rejoin the NIMT only for the short section (about 500 metres) into Britomart. A diesel train shuttle service runs on the NIMT between Pukekohe and Papakura.\n\n[[Onehunga Line]] and [[Western Line, Auckland|Western Line]] trains use the NIMT only for the short section (about 500 metres) from the vicinity of Quay Park into Britomart.\n\n===Wellington suburban===\n[[File:Wellington Railway Station by night.

The episodes \"Study Muffin\" and \"L is for Love\" revealed that Luna is bisexual as she is shown to be attracted to Lincoln's male tutor Hugh, and a female classmate named Sam Sharp.{{efn|Hugh only appears in one episode as a [[puppy love]] crush, Sam has appeared more regularly and is shown to be Luna's primary love interest.}} Luna's siblings are aware that Sam is female, and are supportive of Luna's crush on her.

In the episode \"Middle Men\", it is revealed that Lynn developed a brash personality when she started middle school as she was bullied throughout her first day. Lynn is shown to have made at least one friend named Margo Roberts{{efn|Margo Roberts is voiced by Lara Jill Miller in S2E2A-S3E10B and by [[Brec Bassinger]] in S323B-present}}, who is a teammate on some of her sports teams.\n\n===Lucy Loud===\n'''Lucy Loud''' (voiced by Jessica DiCicco<ref name=\"BusinessWire\" />) is the 8-year-old seventh child of the Loud family and Lynn Jr's roommate.

At school, Lucy is a part of the Morticians' Club with students who have similar traits as her. Lucy has a bust of the vampire Edwin who is from her favorite book and TV series ''The Vampires of Melancholia''. While she pledges to be with Edwin in the afterlife, her crush has Rusty Spokes' brother Rocky in \"Back in Black\".\n\n===Lana Loud===\n'''Lana Loud''' (voiced by [[Grey Griffin]]<ref name=\"BusinessWire\" />) is the 6-year-old eighth child of the Loud family, and is also named after one of Savino's five sisters.<ref name=\"Toonzone\" /> Lana is the identical twin sister of her roommate Lola, and was born two minutes before her as shown in the episode \"Ties That Bind.\"<ref name=\"Twitter\">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/TheLoudWriters/status/732669952470065153|title=LoudHouseWriters!|work=Twitter|date=May 17, 2016|accessdate=May 18, 2016}}</ref> She wears mostly a red baseball cap, white sneakers, a murky green t-shirt and dark blue overalls.

Underneath her selfish and mean-spirited demeanor, she is shown to be forgiving and affectionate to others and self-admits to being a \"crazy pants\" sometimes.

Lisa enjoys solving complex equations, math problems, and performing elaborate experiments where she often uses her unaware siblings and Clyde as test subjects. She wears glasses, an olive green turtleneck sweater, dark pink pants, and brown loafers. Lisa often uses formal and detailed terms to refer to basic things before saying it in [[Plain English|layman's terms]]. She often tends to be quite reckless and unethical with her experiments, but is a good-hearted girl down to her core. A running gag is that some of Lisa's beakers filled with compound mixtures tend to explode, which provokes many alterations in her body such as occasional mutations. She is also a fan of [[west coast rap]] music and is very good at [[breakdancing]]. Despite her intellect, Lisa greatly struggles with simple things such as [[Handicraft|arts and crafts]] due to having stubby fingers and forming friendships with others. Some of Lisa's inventions consist of but are not limited to an assortment of robots, Gloweos (cookies infused with the bioluminescent DNA of the [[Aequorea victoria]] that make the consumer glow in the dark for a short time), a Urine Detector liquid that removes urine from bodies of water, Gravity Shoes that enable her to walk on the ceiling, a chocolate fountain that started out as a nuclear fusion device, a compatibility machine used to match up two people, robotic kangaroo legs to go with Lisa and Lily's shared kangaroo costume, lie-detecting cameras that worked too well, and a chemical analysis machine.

Lily shares a room with Lisa and sometimes her gibberish can be translated by some of her siblings. Around the end of \"Washed Up,\" Lily is the only one who sees Lake Eddy's residential cryptid Plessy which Lincoln and Lucy were wanting to find. In \"Any Given Sundae,\" Lily tries her first ice cream and enjoys it despite some setbacks.\n\n===Lynn Loud Sr.===\n'''Lynn Loud Sr.''' (voiced by [[Brian Stepanek]]<ref name=\"ComicMix\">{{cite web |last1=Whitten |first1=Emily |title=Emily S.

Showrunner Michael Rubiner said that \"with 10 girls in the family\", the crew felt natural \"to explore one of them being LGBTQ\".<ref>https://ew.com/tv/2018/08/22/steven-universe-voltron-kids-cartoons-lgbtq-characters/</ref> As of the episode \u201cRacing Hearts\u201d, Luna and Sam are officially dating.\n\n===Luan Loud===\n'''Luan Loud''' (voiced by [[Cristina Pucelli]]<ref name=\"BusinessWire\" />) is the 14-year-old fourth child of the Loud family, the roommate of Luna, and is named after one of Savino's five sisters.<ref name=\"Toonzone\" /> She is depicted as the comedian of the house, with most of her dialogue consisting of bad puns that annoy her siblings. Luan wears a white sleevless shirt, a yellow skirt, yellow socks, brown shoes, and 3 pink flowers. Every [[April Fools' Day]], she becomes a sadistic prank-obsessed maniac which leaves her family and Clyde in complete fear of the holiday. While she pulls mostly successful pranks, the tables are turned sometimes to effect her as seen in the episodes \"Fool's Paradise\" and \"Fool Me Twice.\" Luan also has other talents which include being an expert birthday [[clown]], juggler, [[Magic (illusion)|magician]], [[mime artist]], and [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquist]] where she owns a dummy named Mr. Coconuts. It is often shown that Luan gets jealous of her other siblings at times, an example being the episode \"Funny Business\" where Lincoln begins to overshadow her as a birthday clown. Luan has a developing relationship with a fellow classmate named Benny{{efn|Benny is voiced by Jessica DiCicco in S2E12B and [[Sean Giambrone]] in S3E25A-present}} as shown in the episode \"Stage Plight\" where they kiss in Mrs. Bernardo's production of ''[[Romeo & Juliet]]''.\n\n===Lynn Loud Jr.===\n'''Lynn Loud Jr.''' (voiced by [[Jessica DiCicco]]<ref name=\"BusinessWire\" />) is the 13-year-old athletic fifth child of the Loud family, who is also named after one of Savino's five sisters (Lynn).{{efn|In the series Lynn Loud Jr. is named after her father.}}<ref name=\"Toonzone\" /> She tends to start competitions among her siblings and plays a large number of different sports. Lynn is very superstitious as she doesn't want anything to ruin her winning streaks and makes various assumptions to each superstition. She wears a red and white jersey, red-and-white track shorts, black cleats, and white high-knee socks. Unlike Lori, Lynn is not insecure when she farts. She does not hesitate to burp out loud or to try things such as a [[Flatulence humor#Practical jokes|dutch oven]] on Lincoln. In the episode \"Middle Men\", it is revealed that Lynn developed a brash personality when she started middle school as she was bullied throughout her first day. Lynn is shown to have made at least one friend named Margo Roberts{{efn|Margo Roberts is voiced by Lara Jill Miller in S2E2A-S3E10B and by [[Brec Bassinger]] in S323B-present}}, who is a teammate on some of her sports teams.\n\n===Lucy Loud===\n'''Lucy Loud''' (voiced by Jessica DiCicco<ref name=\"BusinessWire\" />) is the 8-year-old seventh child of the Loud family and Lynn Jr's roommate.

Lucy has pale white skin and long black hair with bangs that cover her eyes and looks identical to the Loud children's great-grandmother Harriet. Lucy seems to appear out of nowhere at times which often frightens her siblings when she pops up near them. She is also a [[Cartomancy|fortune-teller]], whose predictions turn out to happen in a very literal manner. At school, Lucy is a part of the Morticians' Club with students who have similar traits as her. Lucy has a bust of the vampire Edwin who is from her favorite book and TV series ''The Vampires of Melancholia''. While she pledges to be with Edwin in the afterlife, her crush has Rusty Spokes' brother Rocky in \"Back in Black\".\n\n===Lana Loud===\n'''Lana Loud''' (voiced by [[Grey Griffin]]<ref name=\"BusinessWire\" />) is the 6-year-old eighth child of the Loud family, and is also named after one of Savino's five sisters.<ref name=\"Toonzone\" /> Lana is the identical twin sister of her roommate Lola, and was born two minutes before her as shown in the episode \"Ties That Bind.\"<ref name=\"Twitter\">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/TheLoudWriters/status/732669952470065153|title=LoudHouseWriters!|work=Twitter|date=May 17, 2016|accessdate=May 18, 2016}}</ref> She wears mostly a red baseball cap, white sneakers, a murky green t-shirt and dark blue overalls.

She is mostly seen wearing a long pink gown, sash, a white pearl necklace, long pink gloves, white earrings, pink high heels, and a tiara. Lola is constantly entered in [[child beauty pageant]]s. Lola is shown to constantly tattletale out loud on her siblings (mostly Lincoln) when they confess quietly to what they did. Underneath her selfish and mean-spirited demeanor, she is shown to be forgiving and affectionate to others and self-admits to being a \"crazy pants\" sometimes. There is a running gag that shows Lola's strength exaggerated in a comedic way when she gets angry, such as single-handedly subduing her older sister Lori. Both she and Lana use a pink jeep as their mode of transportation around Royal Woods.\n\n===Lisa Loud===\n'''Lisa Loud''' (voiced by [[Lara Jill Miller]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mcall.com/entertainment/tv-watchers/mc-coopersburg-native-artist-on-new-nick-show-20160406-story.html|title=Southern Lehigh grad is artist on new animated Nick show|date=April 6, 2016|accessdate=April 21, 2016}}</ref>) is the 4-year-old 10th child of the Loud family, and is also named after one of Savino's five sisters.<ref name=\"Toonzone\" /> Lisa is a [[child prodigy]] and [[Intellectual giftedness|gifted child]] who has a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]], but is currently in kindergarten by her own choice.

She wears glasses, an olive green turtleneck sweater, dark pink pants, and brown loafers. Lisa often uses formal and detailed terms to refer to basic things before saying it in [[Plain English|layman's terms]]. She often tends to be quite reckless and unethical with her experiments, but is a good-hearted girl down to her core. A running gag is that some of Lisa's beakers filled with compound mixtures tend to explode, which provokes many alterations in her body such as occasional mutations. She is also a fan of [[west coast rap]] music and is very good at [[breakdancing]]. Despite her intellect, Lisa greatly struggles with simple things such as [[Handicraft|arts and crafts]] due to having stubby fingers and forming friendships with others. Some of Lisa's inventions consist of but are not limited to an assortment of robots, Gloweos (cookies infused with the bioluminescent DNA of the [[Aequorea victoria]] that make the consumer glow in the dark for a short time), a Urine Detector liquid that removes urine from bodies of water, Gravity Shoes that enable her to walk on the ceiling, a chocolate fountain that started out as a nuclear fusion device, a compatibility machine used to match up two people, robotic kangaroo legs to go with Lisa and Lily's shared kangaroo costume, lie-detecting cameras that worked too well, and a chemical analysis machine.

She has a habit of losing her diaper causing her to go [[Nudity|naked]] and also causing her fellow siblings to put her diaper back on. The only phrase Lily generally says aside from gibberish is \"poo-poo\", generally coupled with her diaper flying across the screen or needing a diaper change. Lily shares a room with Lisa and sometimes her gibberish can be translated by some of her siblings. Around the end of \"Washed Up,\" Lily is the only one who sees Lake Eddy's residential cryptid Plessy which Lincoln and Lucy were wanting to find. In \"Any Given Sundae,\" Lily tries her first ice cream and enjoys it despite some setbacks.\n\n===Lynn Loud Sr.===\n'''Lynn Loud Sr.''' (voiced by [[Brian Stepanek]]<ref name=\"ComicMix\">{{cite web |last1=Whitten |first1=Emily |title=Emily S.

Ramos]], then Chief of the [[Philippine Constabulary]] to join him but the latter demurred due to a previous engagement in [[Zamboanga City]].<ref name=\"cal\"/>\n\nWhen the General and his troops arrived at the market aboard two army trucks, the place was deserted. Sali was not there to meet Bautista, so the General and his men sat down at a table to await his arrival. At that point gunfire broke out and Bautista and his men were mowed down. The bodies were later found to have sustained hack wounds.<ref>{{cite news | last = Tulfo  | first = Ramon  | title = Military caught unprepared in Sulu  | publisher = [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] | date = 12 February 2005 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2479&dat=20050212&id=P1c1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=hyUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1637,19156249&hl=en | accessdate = 12 May 2016}}</ref> All of the Army soldiers died, except for a sergeant, the group's [[radioman]], who survived by [[Apparent death|playing dead]].<ref name=\"cal\"/>\n\nAlthough some reports indicate that Usman Sali died during subsequent government operations,<ref>{{cite news | last = Mathews  | first = Jay  | title = Killing Goes On Year After Cease-Fire in Philippine Civil War | publisher = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 12 December 1977 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1977/12/12/killing-goes-on-year-after-cease-fire-in-philippine-civil-war/d26a6fec-aa18-4e02-9f87-4bd5f9511c5a/ | accessdate = 14 May 2016}}</ref> others state that he escaped to [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]] after the incident.<ref>{{cite news | last = Malinao  | first = Alito L.  | title = Get new peace talk brokers | publisher = [[The Manila Times]] | date = 26 August 2008 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2518&dat=20080826&id=vU1aAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KSgMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1632,18406995&hl=en | accessdate = 14 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Memorials==\nThen President [[Ferdinand E.
