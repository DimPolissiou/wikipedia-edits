Born in [[Triesen]], Burgmeier was a burgeoning footballer and keen [[skiing|skier]], until he gave up the latter sport at 16 following a serious injury. Having been a youth player for [[FC Triesen|Triesen]], he started his professional career with Vaduz. Burgmeier won several [[Liechtenstein Football Cup|Liechtensteiner Cups]] with Vaduz, who were promoted to the Swiss Challenge League in 2001, and played in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]. After two unsuccessful attempts to win [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the [[Swiss Super League]], Burgmeier left for [[FC Aarau|Aarau]] in 2005. He spent only one season with Aarau before a move to the previous season's runners-up [[FC Basel|Basel]] in 2006. His two seasons with Basel were broken up by a [[Loan (sports)|loan]] spell with [[FC Thun|Thun]], before he moved to England with [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]] in August 2008, where he played for one year.\n\nBurgmeier won 112&nbsp;[[Cap (sport)|caps]] and scored nine goals for his [[Liechtenstein national football team|country]].

Born in [[Triesen]], Burgmeier was a burgeoning footballer and keen [[skiing|skier]], until he gave up the latter sport at 16 following a serious injury. Having been a youth player for [[FC Triesen|Triesen]], he started his professional career with Vaduz. Burgmeier won several [[Liechtenstein Football Cup|Liechtensteiner Cups]] with Vaduz, who were promoted to the Swiss Challenge League in 2001, and played in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]. After two unsuccessful attempts to win [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the [[Swiss Super League]], Burgmeier left for [[FC Aarau|Aarau]] in 2005.

During Devils home games the DEC was often referred to as the \"Devils Den\" by local TV commentators.
