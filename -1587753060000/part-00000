However, in the middle of their meal, Roman makes his appearance and Yusei accepts his challenge, with Akiza going to assist. Martha takes everyone to hiding, but Taka and his friends decide to go after Yusei to help fight.

Then, the Crimson Dragon envelops the Majestic Star Dragon, infusing it with the power of the Crimson Dragon, and dives into the King of the Netherworld. Yusei then sees a vision where he and the Goodwin brothers are inside the King of the Netherworld, and he sees all of the Dark Signers lying unconscious, floating in mid-air. The moment before the King of the Netherworld is destroyed, Rex Goodwin tells Yusei that he was successful in reaching him, and tells him to take care of the other Dark Signers, as they will be sent back to Earth. The Goodwin brothers decide to sacrifice themselves, so that the other Dark Signers can be revived. The King of the Netherworld explodes, the Altar of the Dragon Star (Rex Goodwin's dueling platform) is dissolved, and the Geoglyph duel tracks disappear, which causes Jack and Crow to fall.

Akiza refuses to fight back and almost falls on a shard of glass, but is saved by Sayer, who whispers something in Akiza's ear that causes her to reawaken her dormant physic powers and summons Black Rose Dragon, which shatters all the mirrors, destroying the illusion, which reveals Misty's real location.\n| LineColor       = 3251AE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's (season 2)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 61\n| Title           = Truth and Consequences, Part 2 / At the End of the Truth\n| TranslitTitle   = Shinjitsu no Hate ni\n| NativeTitle     = \u771f\u5b9f\u306e\u679c\u3066\u306b\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| WrittenBy       = Tadashi Hayakawa\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|6|3}}<ref name=\"jp-52-64\"/>\n| AltDate         = March 15, 2010\n| ShortSummary    = With Akiza's dormant physic abilities fully awakened, Misty activates her geoglyph. Trudge manages to free Yusei and Mina and Yusei goes to join Luna and Leo. Learning about Akiza's current state, Yusei goes to face Sayer, who reveals he is controlling her mind and was responsible for Toby's death. Misty summons out her Earthbound Immortal Ccarayhua. Sayer talks about the experiments he performed on Toby seeing that he did not have ultimate psychic powers sent him to an unknown location that not even he knows about. However, Yusei revealed he had activated an intercom on his duel disk, letting Misty know what Sayer had told him. Angered, Misty gets Ccarayhua to eat him, freeing Akiza from her trance. Misty apologizes to Akiza, but the Earthbound Immortal forces her to continue dueling. Akiza defeats her, setting her free, which results in her being sent to the netherworld. The New Domino City residents return, but a Dark Signer mark, the mark of the Condor appears in the sky.\n| LineColor       = 3251AE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's (season 2)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 62\n| Title           = Signs of Doom, Part 1 / Last Battle!

The Crimson Dragon appears and sends everyone to the front of a temple (the Altar of the Dragon Star), where they find Goodwin, who reveals himself to be a Dark Signer. Then, he transfers Roman's mark of the Dragon Head from a canister to his left arm, destroying the metallic arm that was covering it at the same time. He challenges Yusei, Jack and Crow to a Turbo Duel in the air. Goodwin reveals that he lost the duel with Roman prior to his battle with Yusei on purpose, and became a Dark Signer in order to end the pointless cycle. He summons out both a Synchro monster; Sun Dragon Inti, and its Dark Synchro counterpart; Moon Dragon Quilla. He also reveals he was the Legendary turbo duelist who constructed and flew across the Daedalus Bridge. Crow manages to destroy Sun Dragon Inti, whose special ability then causes Crow to take damage equal to Blackwing Elfin the Raven's attack points, and due to Sun Dragon Inti's temporary destruction, Moon Dragon Quilla then resurrects from Goodwin's graveyard. Then, Goodwin uses his Mark of the Dragon Head to steal all of the Signers' marks, and then he gains the Seal of the Crimson Dragon himself.\n| LineColor       = 3251AE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1               = Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's (season 2)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 63\n| Title           = Signs of Doom, Part 2 / The Strongest Earthbound Immortal!

Then, the King of the Netherworld spouts forth several beasts that attempt to attack the players. However, they are saved by Black Rose Dragon and Ancient Fairy Dragon. Crow sacrifices himself by playing a trap card in order to protect Yusei from Wiraqocha Rasca's special ability, and falls unconscious. Goodwin coaxes Jack into attacking him, but after he gives in and loses some life points, Goodwin's statement of becoming a dark signer causes Jack to remember what Carly taught him and decides not to do things his old fashioned way anymore.

Yusei's life points get reduced to 1 too, before he summons his Stardust Dragon and takes advantage of the traps Crow and Jack placed beforehand. As Yusei tries to reach Goodwin, which he successfully does, he regains the Signers' marks from him. Furthermore, Yusei gains Roman's mark of the Dragon Head, and the mark of the Tail that Yusei used to have transfers over to Crow. Yusei then takes the marks of the other 4 Signers, and gains the Seal of the Crimson Dragon. Then, he summons the Majestic Star Dragon and destroys Earthbound Immortal Wiraqocha Rasca, which defeats Goodwin. Then, the Crimson Dragon envelops the Majestic Star Dragon, infusing it with the power of the Crimson Dragon, and dives into the King of the Netherworld. Yusei then sees a vision where he and the Goodwin brothers are inside the King of the Netherworld, and he sees all of the Dark Signers lying unconscious, floating in mid-air. The moment before the King of the Netherworld is destroyed, Rex Goodwin tells Yusei that he was successful in reaching him, and tells him to take care of the other Dark Signers, as they will be sent back to Earth. The Goodwin brothers decide to sacrifice themselves, so that the other Dark Signers can be revived. The King of the Netherworld explodes, the Altar of the Dragon Star (Rex Goodwin's dueling platform) is dissolved, and the Geoglyph duel tracks disappear, which causes Jack and Crow to fall. However, the Crimson Dragon catches both of them, and repairs all of the damage done by the King of the Netherworld. Peace returns, and the Daedalus Bridge is finally finished, uniting both Satellite and New Domino City.\n| LineColor       = 3251AE\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Yu-Gi-Oh!}}\n\n[[Category:2008 Japanese television seasons]]\n[[Category:2009 Japanese television seasons]]\n[[Category:Yu-Gi-Oh! seasons|5D's (season 2)]]\n", "name_user": "Favre1fan93", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!_5D%27s_(season_2)"}
