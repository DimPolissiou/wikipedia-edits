His suggestion was consistent with reports in 1922 and 1923 of rare instances in which patients developed \"post-vaccinal encephalomyelitis\" subsequent to receiving the [[rabies]] [[vaccine]] that constituted of brain tissue carrying the virus.

His suggestion was consistent with reports in 1922 and 1923 of rare instances in which patients developed \"post-vaccinal encephalomyelitis\" subsequent to receiving the [[rabies]] [[vaccine]] that constituted of brain tissue carrying the virus. The pathological examination of those who had succumbed to the disease, revealed inflammatory cells and demyelination as opposed to the vascular lesions predicted by Bastian.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://myelitis.org/resources/the-history-of-tm-the-origins-of-the-name-and-the-identification-of-the-disease/|title=The History of TM: The Origins of the Name and the Identification of the Disease | first = Douglas | last = Kerr | name-list-format = vanc |work=The Transverse Myelitis Association|access-date=2018-07-22|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nFord's theory of an [[Allergy|allergic response]] being at the root of the disease was later shown to be only partially correct, as some infectious agents such as mycoplasma, [[measles]] and [[rubella]]<ref>{{cite journal |last=Morris |first=Milton H. |last2=Robbins|first2=Abner | name-list-format = vanc |date=1943-09-01 |title=Acute infectious myelitis following rubella|url=http://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(43)80017-2/fulltext |journal=The Journal of Pediatrics |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=365\u2013367 |doi=10.1016/S0022-3476(43)80017-2 }}</ref> were isolated from the spinal fluid of some infected patients, suggesting that direct infection could contribute to the manifestation of acute myelitis in certain cases.\n\nIn 1948, Dr. Suchett-Kaye described a patient with rapidly progressing impairment of lower extremity motor function that developed as a complication of pneumonia.

The law states that a player is in an '''offside position''' if any of their body parts, except the hands and arms, are in the opponents' half of the [[association football pitch|pitch]], and closer to the opponents' [[goal line (association football)|goal line]] than both the ball and the second-last opponent (the last opponent is usually, but not necessarily, the goalkeeper).<ref name=\"laws2017-law11\">{{cite web|url=http://theifab.com/laws/offside-2018/chapters/offside-position-2018 |work=Laws of the game of Association Football |publisher=[[International Football Association Board]] |location=[[Zurich]] |accessdate= 2019-04-23 |title=Law 11 - Offside}}</ref>\n\nBeing in an offside position is not an offence in itself, but a player so positioned when the ball is played by a teammate can be judged guilty of an '''offside offence''' if they become \"involved in active play\", \"interfere with an opponent\", or \"gain an advantage\" by being in that position.\n\n==Significance==\nOffside is judged at the moment the ball is last touched by the most recent teammate to touch the ball. Being in an offside position is not an offence in itself. A player who was in an offside position at the moment the ball was last touched or played by a teammate must then become '''involved in active play''', in the opinion of the referee, in order for an offence to occur. When the '''offside offence''' occurs, the referee stops play, and awards an [[indirect free kick]] to the defending team from the place where the offending player became involved in active play.<ref name=\"laws2017-law11\"/>\n\nThe offside offence is neither a foul nor misconduct as it does not belong to [[Fouls and misconduct (association football)|Law 12]]. Like fouls, however, any play (such as the [[Scoring in association football|scoring of a goal]]) that occurs after an offence has taken place, but before the referee is able to stop the play, is nullified.<ref name=\"laws2017-law10\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theifab.com/backend/library/doc/laws-of-the-game-201718-english-single-page |work=Laws of the Game 2017-18 |date=2017-05-22 |publisher=[[International Football Association Board]] |location=[[Zurich]] |accessdate= 2017-09-28 |title=Law 10 - Determining the Outcome of a Match |pages=87\u201390 }}</ref> The only time an offence related to offside is cautionable is if a defender deliberately leaves the field in order to deceive their opponents regarding a player's offside position, or if a forward, having left the field, returns and gains an advantage. In neither of these cases is the player being penalised for being offside; they are being cautioned for acts of unsporting behaviour.<ref name=\"laws2017-law11\"/>\n\nAn attacker who is able to receive the ball behind the opposition defenders is often in a good position to score. The offside rule limits attackers' ability to do this, requiring that they be onside when the ball is played forward. Though restricted, well-timed passes and fast running allow an attacker to move into such a situation ''after'' the ball is kicked forward without committing the offence. Officiating decisions regarding offside, which can often be a matter of only centimeters or inches, can be critical in games, as they may determine whether a promising attack can continue, or even if a [[scoring in association football|goal]] is allowed to stand.\n\nOne of the main duties of the [[Assistant referee (association football)|assistant referee]]s is to assist the referee in adjudicating offside<ref name=\"laws2017-law6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theifab.com/backend/library/doc/laws-of-the-game-201718-english-single-page |work=Laws of the Game 2017-18 |date=2017-05-22 |publisher=[[International Football Association Board]] |location=[[Zurich]] |accessdate= 2017-09-28 |title=Law 6 - The Other Match Officials |pages=69\u201374 }}</ref> \u2014 their position on the sidelines giving a more useful view sideways across the pitch.

It is also not an offence if the ball was last deliberately played by an opponent (except for a deliberate save). In this context, according to the [[IFAB]], \"A \u2018save\u2019 is when a player stops, or attempts to stop, a ball which is going into or very close to the goal with any part of the body except the hands/arms (unless the goalkeeper within the penalty area).\"<ref name=\"laws2017-law11\"/>\n\nAn offside offence may occur if a player receives the ball directly from either a [[direct free kick]], [[indirect free kick]], or [[dropped-ball]].\n\nSince offside is judged at the time the ball is touched or played by a teammate, not when the player receives the ball, it is possible for a player to receive the ball significantly past the second-to-last opponent, or even the last opponent, without committing an offence.\n\nDetermining whether a player is \"involved in active play\" can be complex.

In response to these requests, [[IFAB]] circular 3 was issued in 2015 to provide additional guidance on the criteria for interfering with an opponent. This additional guidance is now included in the main body of the law, and forms the last 3 conditions under the heading \"Interfering with an opponent\" as shown above. The circular also contained additional guidance on the meaning of a save, in the context of a ball that has \"been deliberately saved by any opponent.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theifab.com/backend/library/doc/circular_3_LoG_additional_guidance_on_law_11_EN |title=IFAB Circular 3 | publisher = [[The International Football Association Board]] | location=Zurich | date=15 July 2015 |accessdate=30 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Offside sanction ===\nThe sanction for an offside offence is an [[indirect free kick]] for the opponent at the place where the offence occurred, even if it is in the player\u2019s own half of the field of play.<ref name=\"laws2017-law11\"/>\n\n=== Officiating ===\n[[File:Assistant referee 15abr2007.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An assistant referee signals that the offside offence was in the middle of the pitch; on the far side the flag would be pointed up at 45 degrees, for near the assistant referee it would be pointed down.]]\nIn enforcing this rule, the [[referee (association football)|referee]] depends greatly on an [[Assistant referee (association football)|assistant referee]], who generally keeps in line with the second-to-last opponent, the ball, or the halfway line, whichever is closer to the goal line of their relevant end.<ref name=\"laws2017-PGMO\"/>{{rp|176}} An assistant referee signals for an offside offence by first raising their flag to a vertical position and then, if the referee stops play, by partly lowering their flag to an angle that signifies the location of the offence:<ref name=\"laws2017-PGMO\"/>{{rp|192}}\n* Flag pointed at a 45-degree angle downwards: offence has occurred in the third of the pitch nearest to the assistant referee;<ref name=\"laws2017-law6\"/>{{rp|73}}\n* Flag parallel to the ground: offence has occurred in the middle third of the pitch;<ref name=\"laws2017-law6\"/>{{rp|73}}\n* Flag pointed at a 45-degree angle upwards: offence has occurred in the third of the pitch furthest from the assistant referee.<ref name=\"laws2017-law6\"/>{{rp|73}}\n\nThe assistant referees' task with regard to offside can be difficult, as they need to keep up with attacks and counter-attacks, consider which players are in an offside position when the ball is played, and then determine whether and when the offside-positioned players become involved in active play. The risk of false judgement is further increased by the [[foreshortening]] effect, which occurs when the distance between the attacking player and the assistant referee is significantly different from the distance to the defending player, and the assistant referee is not directly in line with the defender. The difficulty of offside officiating is often underestimated by spectators. Trying to judge if a player is level with an opponent at the moment the ball is kicked is not easy: if an attacker and a defender are running in opposite directions, they can be two metres apart in less than a second. \n\nSome researchers believe that offside officiating errors are \"optically inevitable\".<ref>{{citation|title=Errors in judging 'offside' in football|doi=10.1038/35003639 |pmid=10716430 | volume=404 | issue=6773|year=2000|last1=Oudejans|first1=Ra\u00f4ul R.

A ruleset dating from 1856 found in the library of [[Shrewsbury School]] is probably closely modelled on the Cambridge Rules and is thought to be the oldest set still in existence. Rule No. 9 required more than three defensive players to be ahead of an attacker who plays the ball. The rule states:<ref name=Carosi/>\n\n{{quote|If the ball has passed a player and has come from the direction of his own goal, he may not touch it till the other side have kicked it, unless there are more than three of the other side before him.

Sheffield got rid of the \"kick-throughs\" by amending their laws so that one member of the defending side was required between a forward player and the opponents' goal.\n\nThe compromise rule that was written into the Laws of the Game in 1866, and eventually adopted universally, was to adopt a form of the Cambridge rule, but with \"at least three\" rather than \"more than three\" opponents.<ref name=Carosi/><ref name=\"4Drules\">{{cite web | url=http://www.4dfoot.com/2013/04/25/150-years-of-association-football-how-the-rules-have-changed/ | title=150 years of Association Football ~ How the Rules have changed | accessdate=2013-04-25 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612145505/http://www.4dfoot.com/2013/04/25/150-years-of-association-football-how-the-rules-have-changed/ | archivedate=12 June 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1924, the concept of passive offside was introduced.<ref name=Carosi>{{cite web|url=http://www.kenaston.org/download/KenAstonRefereeSociety/offside_history-JulianCarosi.pdf|first=Julian | last=Carosi |year=2006|title=The History of Offside|accessdate=12 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe rule changed to \"two opponents\" in 1925 and led to an immediate increase in goal-scoring. 4,700 goals were scored in 1,848 [[1924\u201325 Football League|Football League games in 1924\u201325]].

Just before an attacking player is played a through ball, the last defender(s) move up field, isolating the attacker into an offside position. The execution requires careful timing by the defence and is considered a risk, since running up field against the direction of attack may leave the goal exposed. Now that changes to the interpretations of \"interfering with play, interfering with an opponent and gaining an advantage\" mean a player is not guilty of an offside offence unless they become directly and clearly involved in active play, players not involved in active play cannot be \"caught offside\", making the tactic riskier.

Being in an offside position is not an offence in itself. A player who was in an offside position at the moment the ball was last touched or played by a teammate must then become '''involved in active play''', in the opinion of the referee, in order for an offence to occur. When the '''offside offence''' occurs, the referee stops play, and awards an [[indirect free kick]] to the defending team from the place where the offending player became involved in active play.<ref name=\"laws2017-law11\"/>\n\nThe offside offence is neither a foul nor misconduct as it does not belong to [[Fouls and misconduct (association football)|Law 12]]. Like fouls, however, any play (such as the [[Scoring in association football|scoring of a goal]]) that occurs after an offence has taken place, but before the referee is able to stop the play, is nullified.<ref name=\"laws2017-law10\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theifab.com/backend/library/doc/laws-of-the-game-201718-english-single-page |work=Laws of the Game 2017-18 |date=2017-05-22 |publisher=[[International Football Association Board]] |location=[[Zurich]] |accessdate= 2017-09-28 |title=Law 10 - Determining the Outcome of a Match |pages=87\u201390 }}</ref> The only time an offence related to offside is cautionable is if a defender deliberately leaves the field in order to deceive their opponents regarding a player's offside position, or if a forward, having left the field, returns and gains an advantage. In neither of these cases is the player being penalised for being offside; they are being cautioned for acts of unsporting behaviour.<ref name=\"laws2017-law11\"/>\n\nAn attacker who is able to receive the ball behind the opposition defenders is often in a good position to score. The offside rule limits attackers' ability to do this, requiring that they be onside when the ball is played forward. Though restricted, well-timed passes and fast running allow an attacker to move into such a situation ''after'' the ball is kicked forward without committing the offence. Officiating decisions regarding offside, which can often be a matter of only centimeters or inches, can be critical in games, as they may determine whether a promising attack can continue, or even if a [[scoring in association football|goal]] is allowed to stand.\n\nOne of the main duties of the [[Assistant referee (association football)|assistant referee]]s is to assist the referee in adjudicating offside<ref name=\"laws2017-law6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theifab.com/backend/library/doc/laws-of-the-game-201718-english-single-page |work=Laws of the Game 2017-18 |date=2017-05-22 |publisher=[[International Football Association Board]] |location=[[Zurich]] |accessdate= 2017-09-28 |title=Law 6 - The Other Match Officials |pages=69\u201374 }}</ref> \u2014 their position on the sidelines giving a more useful view sideways across the pitch.

It is also not an offence if the ball was last deliberately played by an opponent (except for a deliberate save). In this context, according to the [[IFAB]], \"A \u2018save\u2019 is when a player stops, or attempts to stop, a ball which is going into or very close to the goal with any part of the body except the hands/arms (unless the goalkeeper within the penalty area).\"<ref name=\"laws2017-law11\"/>\n\nAn offside offence may occur if a player receives the ball directly from either a [[direct free kick]], [[indirect free kick]], or [[dropped-ball]].\n\nSince offside is judged at the time the ball is touched or played by a teammate, not when the player receives the ball, it is possible for a player to receive the ball significantly past the second-to-last opponent, or even the last opponent, without committing an offence.\n\nDetermining whether a player is \"involved in active play\" can be complex.

In response to these requests, [[IFAB]] circular 3 was issued in 2015 to provide additional guidance on the criteria for interfering with an opponent. This additional guidance is now included in the main body of the law, and forms the last 3 conditions under the heading \"Interfering with an opponent\" as shown above. The circular also contained additional guidance on the meaning of a save, in the context of a ball that has \"been deliberately saved by any opponent.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theifab.com/backend/library/doc/circular_3_LoG_additional_guidance_on_law_11_EN |title=IFAB Circular 3 | publisher = [[The International Football Association Board]] | location=Zurich | date=15 July 2015 |accessdate=30 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Offside sanction ===\nThe sanction for an offside offence is an [[indirect free kick]] for the opponent at the place where the offence occurred, even if it is in the player\u2019s own half of the field of play.<ref name=\"laws2017-law11\"/>\n\n=== Officiating ===\n[[File:Assistant referee 15abr2007.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An assistant referee signals that the offside offence was in the middle of the pitch; on the far side the flag would be pointed up at 45 degrees, for near the assistant referee it would be pointed down.]]\nIn enforcing this rule, the [[referee (association football)|referee]] depends greatly on an [[Assistant referee (association football)|assistant referee]], who generally keeps in line with the second-to-last opponent, the ball, or the halfway line, whichever is closer to the goal line of their relevant end.<ref name=\"laws2017-PGMO\"/>{{rp|176}} An assistant referee signals for an offside offence by first raising their flag to a vertical position and then, if the referee stops play, by partly lowering their flag to an angle that signifies the location of the offence:<ref name=\"laws2017-PGMO\"/>{{rp|192}}\n* Flag pointed at a 45-degree angle downwards: offence has occurred in the third of the pitch nearest to the assistant referee;<ref name=\"laws2017-law6\"/>{{rp|73}}\n* Flag parallel to the ground: offence has occurred in the middle third of the pitch;<ref name=\"laws2017-law6\"/>{{rp|73}}\n* Flag pointed at a 45-degree angle upwards: offence has occurred in the third of the pitch furthest from the assistant referee.<ref name=\"laws2017-law6\"/>{{rp|73}}\n\nThe assistant referees' task with regard to offside can be difficult, as they need to keep up with attacks and counter-attacks, consider which players are in an offside position when the ball is played, and then determine whether and when the offside-positioned players become involved in active play. The risk of false judgement is further increased by the [[foreshortening]] effect, which occurs when the distance between the attacking player and the assistant referee is significantly different from the distance to the defending player, and the assistant referee is not directly in line with the defender. The difficulty of offside officiating is often underestimated by spectators. Trying to judge if a player is level with an opponent at the moment the ball is kicked is not easy: if an attacker and a defender are running in opposite directions, they can be two metres apart in less than a second. \n\nSome researchers believe that offside officiating errors are \"optically inevitable\".<ref>{{citation|title=Errors in judging 'offside' in football|doi=10.1038/35003639 |pmid=10716430 | volume=404 | issue=6773|year=2000|last1=Oudejans|first1=Ra\u00f4ul R.

A ruleset dating from 1856 found in the library of [[Shrewsbury School]] is probably closely modelled on the Cambridge Rules and is thought to be the oldest set still in existence. Rule No. 9 required more than three defensive players to be ahead of an attacker who plays the ball. The rule states:<ref name=Carosi/>\n\n{{quote|If the ball has passed a player and has come from the direction of his own goal, he may not touch it till the other side have kicked it, unless there are more than three of the other side before him.

Just before an attacking player is played a through ball, the last defender(s) move up field, isolating the attacker into an offside position. The execution requires careful timing by the defence and is considered a risk, since running up field against the direction of attack may leave the goal exposed. Now that changes to the interpretations of \"interfering with play, interfering with an opponent and gaining an advantage\" mean a player is not guilty of an offside offence unless they become directly and clearly involved in active play, players not involved in active play cannot be \"caught offside\", making the tactic riskier. An attacker, upon realizing they are in an offside position, may simply choose to avoid interfering with play until the ball is played by someone else first.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Offside (association football)}}\n*[http://www.theifab.com/backend/library/doc/laws-of-the-game-201718-english-single-page Laws of the Game 2017-18] &mdash; Law 11 - Offside is on pages 93\u201395.

If a ship proved to be a valuable prize efforts would sometimes be made to capture the vessel while inflicting the least amount of damage as was practically possible. Both military and merchant ships were captured, often renamed, and then used in the service of the capturing country's navy, or in many cases sold to private individuals who would break them up for salvage, or use them as merchant vessels, [[whaling]] ships, [[slave ships]], or the like. As an incentive to search far and wide for enemy ships, the proceeds of the sale of the vessels and their cargoes were divided up as [[prize money]] among the officers and crew of capturing crew members with the distribution governed by regulations the captor vessel's government had established.

If a ship proved to be a valuable prize efforts would sometimes be made to capture the vessel while inflicting the least amount of damage as was practically possible. Both military and merchant ships were captured, often renamed, and then used in the service of the capturing country's navy, or in many cases sold to private individuals who would break them up for salvage, or use them as merchant vessels, [[whaling]] ships, [[slave ships]], or the like. As an incentive to search far and wide for enemy ships, the proceeds of the sale of the vessels and their cargoes were divided up as [[prize money]] among the officers and crew of capturing crew members with the distribution governed by regulations the captor vessel's government had established. Throughout the 1800s war prize laws were established to help opposing countries settle claims amicably.<ref>[[#Roosevelt|Roosevelt, 1883]] pp.''xxxvi'', 165, 350, etc</ref><ref>[[#Yonge|Yonge, 1863]] pp.239, 269, 288, 295, etc</ref> Private ships were also authorized by various countries at war through a [[Letter of marque]], legally allowing a ship and commander to engage and capture vessels belonging to enemy countries.<ref>[[#Eastman|Eastman, 2004]] pp.1\u20137</ref> In these cases contracts between the owners of the vessels on the one hand, and the captains and the crews on the other, established the distribution of the proceeds from captures.\n{{TOC left|limit=2}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Legend==\n* Dates of capture are listed chronologically and appear in bold''' {{#tag:ref|1800 is usually considered part of the 18th century; ships captured that year which are listed here have histories and surrounding histories that extend into the 19th century and are included in this list for continuity and context.|group=\"Note\"}}\n* Names of commanders are those in command when ships were captured.\n*  The symbol '{{KIA}} ' following a commander's name denotes he was killed in action.\n* Name of ship and flag of country listed are those in use at time of ship's capture and will sometimes link to a page with name and flag used after capture.\n*This list does not include ships captured by pirates.\n\n== 1800\u20131809 ==\n\n=== Quasi-War ===\n\nThe [[Quasi-War]] was an undeclared war fought mostly at sea between the [[United States]] and [[French Republic]] from 1798 to 1800.
