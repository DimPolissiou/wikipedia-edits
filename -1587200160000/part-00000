He stated in his 1st century BC work ''[[De architectura]]'' (I.1.5) that the female figures of the [[Erechtheion]] represented the punishment of the women of [[Caryae]], a town near [[Sparta]] in [[Laconia]], who were condemned to slavery after betraying [[Athens]] by siding with [[Persia]] in the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. However, Vitruvius' explanation is doubtful; well before the Persian Wars, female figures were used as decorative supports in Greece<ref>Hersey, George, ''The Lost Meaning of Classical Architecture'', MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1998 p. 69</ref> and the ancient Near East.

The Erectheion caryatids, in a shrine dedicated to an archaic king of Athens, may therefore represent priestesses of Artemis in Caryae, a place named for the \"nut-tree sisterhood\" &ndash; apparently in [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] times, like other plural feminine [[toponym]]s, such as Hyrai or Athens itself.\n\nThe later male counterpart of the caryatid is referred to as a [[telamon]] (plural ''telamones'') or [[Atlas (architecture)|atlas]] (plural ''atlantes'') &ndash; the name refers to the legend of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], who bore the sphere of the heavens on his shoulders.

Influenza viruses that are normally found in swine are known as swine influenza viruses (SIVs). \nThe known SIV strains include influenza C and the subtypes of influenza A known as H1N1, [[H1N2]], [[H3N1]], [[H3N2]] and [[H2N3]]. Pigs can also become infected with the H4N6 and H9N2 subtypes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}\n\nSwine influenza virus is common throughout pig populations worldwide. Transmission of the virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always lead to human influenza, often resulting only in the production of antibodies in the blood. If transmission does cause human influenza, it is called [[Zoonosis|zoonotic swine flu]] or a variant virus. People with regular exposure to pigs are at increased risk of swine flu infection. The meat of an infected animal poses no risk of infection when properly cooked.\n\nPigs experimentally infected with the strain of swine flu that caused the [[2009 flu pandemic|human pandemic of 2009\u201310]] showed clinical signs of flu within four days, and the virus spread to other uninfected pigs housed with the infected ones.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090709201847.htm |title=Humans May Give Swine Flu To Pigs In New Twist To Pandemic |website=Sciencedaily.com |date=10 July 2009 |accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Notable incidents==\n\n=== 1918\u20131919 Spanish flu===\n{{Main|1918 flu pandemic}}\nThe [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish flu]], also known as ''la grippe,'' ''La Gripe Espa\u00f1ola'', or ''La Pesadilla'', was an unusually severe and deadly [[Strain (biology)|strain]] of [[avian influenza]], a [[virus|viral]] [[infection|infectious]] [[disease]], that killed some 17<ref name=Spreeuwenberg>{{cite journal |last1=P.

Influenza viruses that are normally found in swine are known as swine influenza viruses (SIVs). \nThe known SIV strains include influenza C and the subtypes of influenza A known as H1N1, [[H1N2]], [[H3N1]], [[H3N2]] and [[H2N3]]. Pigs can also become infected with the H4N6 and H9N2 subtypes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}\n\nSwine influenza virus is common throughout pig populations worldwide. Transmission of the virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always lead to human influenza, often resulting only in the production of antibodies in the blood. If transmission does cause human influenza, it is called [[Zoonosis|zoonotic swine flu]] or a variant virus. People with regular exposure to pigs are at increased risk of swine flu infection. The meat of an infected animal poses no risk of infection when properly cooked.\n\nPigs experimentally infected with the strain of swine flu that caused the [[2009 flu pandemic|human pandemic of 2009\u201310]] showed clinical signs of flu within four days, and the virus spread to other uninfected pigs housed with the infected ones.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090709201847.htm |title=Humans May Give Swine Flu To Pigs In New Twist To Pandemic |website=Sciencedaily.com |date=10 July 2009 |accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Notable incidents==\n\n=== 1918\u20131919 Spanish flu===\n{{Main|1918 flu pandemic}}\nThe [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish flu]], also known as ''la grippe,'' ''La Gripe Espa\u00f1ola'', or ''La Pesadilla'', was an unusually severe and deadly [[Strain (biology)|strain]] of [[avian influenza]], a [[virus|viral]] [[infection|infectious]] [[disease]], that killed some 17<ref name=Spreeuwenberg>{{cite journal |last1=P.

The team with the most runs wins in many versions of the game, and always draws at worst (see [[Result (cricket)|result]]), except for some results decided by the [[Duckworth\u2013Lewis\u2013Stern method|DLS method]]. One run (known as a \"[[Single (cricket)|single]]\") is scored when a [[Batting (cricket)|batsman]] (known as the \"striker\") has hit the [[cricket ball|ball]] with the bat, or with a gloved hand holding the bat, and directed it away from the [[fielding (cricket)|fielders]] so that both the striker and the non-striker are able to run the length of the [[Cricket pitch|pitch]] (22 yards), crossing each other and arriving safely at the other end of the pitch, before the fielders can retrieve the ball and hit the wicket.\n\nDepending on how long it takes the fielding team to recover the ball, the batsmen may run more than once. Each completed run increments the scores of both the team and the striker. A batsman may also score 4 or 6 runs by striking the ball to the [[Boundary (cricket)|boundary]]. The team's total score in the [[innings]] is the aggregate of all its batsmen's individual scores plus any [[extra (cricket)|extras]].

For a long time, until well into the 18th century, the scorers sat on the field and increments to the score were known as \"notches\" because they would notch the scores on a stick, with a deeper knick at 20. The same method was used by shepherds when counting sheep. In the earliest known Laws of cricket, dated 1744, one of the rules states:<ref>Ashley-Cooper, p. 22.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"If in running a Notch, the Wicket is struck down by a Throw, before his Foot, Hand, or Bat is over the Popping-Crease, or a Stump hit by the Ball, though the Bail was down, it's out\".</blockquote>\n\nIn the 1774 version, the equivalent rule states:<ref>Haygarth, pp. 16\u201317.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"Or if in running a notch, the wicket is struck down by a throw, or with the ball in hand, before his foot, hand, or bat is grounded over the popping-crease; but if the bail is off, a stump must be struck out of the ground by the ball\".</blockquote>\n\nThese are the earliest known references to running as the means of scoring. The change of terminology from \"notch\" to \"run\" was gradual and both terms were in use in 1800. The result of a match played in Sussex on 3 August 1800 was a win \"by 25 notches\"<ref>McCann, p. 197.</ref> while another match in Sussex on 9 August 1800 was won \"by an innings and 38 runs\".<ref>McCann, p. 198.</ref>\n\n==Records==\nFor team and individual run-scoring records, see [[List of Test cricket records]], [[List of One Day International cricket records]], [[List of Twenty20 International records]], and [[List of first-class cricket records]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last=Ashley-Cooper |first=F.

The team with the most runs wins in many versions of the game, and always draws at worst (see [[Result (cricket)|result]]), except for some results decided by the [[Duckworth\u2013Lewis\u2013Stern method|DLS method]]. One run (known as a \"[[Single (cricket)|single]]\") is scored when a [[Batting (cricket)|batsman]] (known as the \"striker\") has hit the [[cricket ball|ball]] with the bat, or with a gloved hand holding the bat, and directed it away from the [[fielding (cricket)|fielders]] so that both the striker and the non-striker are able to run the length of the [[Cricket pitch|pitch]] (22 yards), crossing each other and arriving safely at the other end of the pitch, before the fielders can retrieve the ball and hit the wicket.\n\nDepending on how long it takes the fielding team to recover the ball, the batsmen may run more than once. Each completed run increments the scores of both the team and the striker. A batsman may also score 4 or 6 runs by striking the ball to the [[Boundary (cricket)|boundary]]. The team's total score in the [[innings]] is the aggregate of all its batsmen's individual scores plus any [[extra (cricket)|extras]]. To complete a run, both batsmen must make their [[Ground (cricket)|ground]], with some part of their person or bat touching the ground behind the [[crease (cricket)|popping crease]] at the other end of the pitch.

It has mostly smooth bark, juvenile leaves that are whitish and waxy on the lower surface, glossy green, lance-shaped adult leaves, [[wikt:glaucous#Adjective|glaucous]], ribbed flower buds arranged singly or in groups of three or seven in leaf [[wikt:axil|axil]]s, white flowers and woody fruit. There are four subspecies, each with a different distribution, occurring in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania.[[File:Eucalyptus globulus subsp. bicostata buds.jpg|thumb|225px|flower buds of subsp. ''bicostata'']][[File:Eucalyptus globulus subsp. bicostata fruit.jpg|thumb|225px|fruit of subsp. ''bicostata'']]\n\n==Description==\n''Eucalyptus globulus'' is a tree that typically grows to a height of {{cvt|45|m}} but may sometimes only be a stunted shrub, or alternatively under ideal conditions can grow as tall as {{cvt|90-100|m}}, and forms a [[lignotuber]]. The bark is usually smooth, white to cream-coloured but there are sometimes slabs of persistent, unshed bark at the base. Young plants, often several metres tall, and [[coppice]] regrowth have stems that are more or less square in cross-section with a prominent wing on each corner. Juvenile leaves are mostly arranged in opposite pairs, [[Sessility (botany)|sessile]], [[wikt:glaucous#Adjective|glaucous]] elliptic to egg-shaped, up to {{cvt|150|mm}} long and {{cvt|105|mm}} wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same glossy to dark green on both sides, lance-shaped or curved, {{cvt|150-300|mm}} long and {{cvt|17-30|mm}} wide on a [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] {{cvt|1.5-6|mm}} long. The flower buds are arranged singly or in groups of three or seven in leaf axils, sometimes sessile or on a short thick [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncle]]. The individual buds are also usually sessile, sometimes on a [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]] up to {{cvt|5|mm}} long. Mature buds are top-shaped to conical, glaucous or green, with a flattened hemispherical, warty [[Operculum (botany)|operculum]] with a central knob. Flowering time varies with subspecies and distribution but the flowers are always white. The fruit is a woody conical or hemispherical [[Capsule (botany)|capsule]] with the valves close to rim level.<ref name=\"RBGV\">{{cite web |last1=Brooker |first1=M.

It has mostly smooth bark, juvenile leaves that are whitish and waxy on the lower surface, glossy green, lance-shaped adult leaves, [[wikt:glaucous#Adjective|glaucous]], ribbed flower buds arranged singly or in groups of three or seven in leaf [[wikt:axil|axil]]s, white flowers and woody fruit. There are four subspecies, each with a different distibution, occurring in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania.[[File:Eucalyptus globulus subsp. bicostata buds.jpg|thumb|225px|flower buds of subsp. ''bicostata'']][[File:Eucalyptus globulus subsp. bicostata fruit.jpg|thumb|225px|fruit of subsp. ''bicostata'']]\n\n==Description==\n''Eucalyptus globulus'' is a tree that typically grows to a height of {{cvt|45|m}} but may sometimes only be a stunted shrub, or alternatively under ideal conditions can grow as tall as {{cvt|90-100|m}}, and forms a [[lignotuber]]. The bark is usually smooth, white to cream-coloured but there are sometimes slabs of persistent, unshed bark at the base. Young plants, often several metres tall, and [[coppice]] regrowth have stems that are more or less square in cross-section with a prominent wing on each corner. Juvenile leaves are mostly arranged in opposite pairs, [[Sessility (botany)|sessile]], [[wikt:glaucous#Adjective|glaucous]] elliptic to egg-shaped, up to {{cvt|150|mm}} long and {{cvt|105|mm}} wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same glossy to dark green on both sides, lance-shaped or curved, {{cvt|150-300|mm}} long and {{cvt|17-30|mm}} wide on a [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] {{cvt|1.5-6|mm}} long. The flower buds are arranged singly or in groups of three or seven in leaf axils, sometimes sessile or on a short thick [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncle]]. The individual buds are also usually sessile, sometimes on a [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]] up to {{cvt|5|mm}} long. Mature buds are top-shaped to conical, glaucous or green, with a flattened hemispherical, warty [[Operculum (botany)|operculum]] with a central knob. Flowering time varies with subspecies and distribution but the flowers are always white. The fruit is a woody conical or hemispherical [[Capsule (botany)|capsule]] with the valves close to rim level.<ref name=\"RBGV\">{{cite web |last1=Brooker |first1=M.

Based on [[Jack London]]'s novel ''[[White Fang]]'', it tells the story of the friendship between a young [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]] gold prospector and a [[wolfdog]].  White Fang is portrayed by a [[wolfdog]], [[Jed (wolfdog)|Jed]], who also appeared in such films as ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' (1982) and ''[[The Journey of Natty Gann]]'' (1985).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1058600/|title=Jed|website=IMDb|access-date=2018-01-16}}</ref>  A sequel to the film, ''[[White Fang 2: Myth of the White Wolf]]'', was released in 1994.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1896, during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], a young explorer named Jack Conroy arrives in Alaska from San Francisco to look for his deceased father's mining claim. Conroy meets two mushers named Clarence \"Skunker\" Thurston and Alex Larson, Conroy's father's buddy, who reluctantly agree to guide Jack to his father's claim in the Yukon. While on their journey, they are stalked by a large pack of wolves. One night, while resting at a campfire, a female wolf named Kiche manages to lure one of the sled dogs (Digger) away from the group, and another wolf appears and chases the dog into the woods. Skunker uses his ammunition to wound Kiche and gives chase to save his dog, but is killed and devoured by the rest of the pack. Later that night the wolves return but are scared off by Jack and Alex using burning branches. The following morning the wolves attack the two men, but they are saved when another sled team arrives with one of the men mortally shooting a male wolf. The injured wolf hobbles back to her den, and her cub remains by her side until she dies. The pup is left to fend for himself. Jack and Alex reach a town where they plan to stay for the winter. A band of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], meanwhile, find the pup, and the chief, realizing he is half dog and half wolf from the color of his teeth, names him White Fang.\n\nAs spring comes, Jack and Alex resume their quest, but stop off at the Native Americans' settlement. The chief explains that White Fang has been raised to obey, not to be friendly, but Jack seeks to change that. Jack's chance comes when he is chased and cornered by a grizzly bear. White Fang intervenes, saving Jack's life. Jack and Alex later leave the settlement. Not long after, White Fang is unfairly traded to a brutal dogfighter named Beauty Smith (who previously stole Jack's money); he blackmails the Native American for the wolfdog, saying that ownership of a wild animal is considered illegal. Smith and his gang train White Fang to be vicious in order to enter him into illegal dogfights. White Fang eventually meets his match in a brutal fight against a bulldog, but Jack happens upon the fight and intervenes in the nick of time. Having earlier reached his father's claim and begun the work of digging for gold, Jack returns with White Fang to the cabin where he seeks to transform White Fang's vicious and territorial nature.\n\nJack's attempts to tame White Fang eventually succeed; both wolfdog and man develop a close and trusting bond. Alex helps Jack mine for gold and they strike it rich with the help of White Fang. One morning, Jack travels to the town to claim proper ownership to the gold when Luke notices White Fang with him. Seeking retaliation and planning to steal the gold, Smith and his men attack the cabin site. White Fang attacks Tinker, who accidentally discharges his gun, wounding Luke. White Fang subdues Smith until he's ordered by Jack to back down. Jack and Alex take Smith and his men prisoner and force them at gunpoint to haul gold ore into town. poopoo\n\nAlex and his wife, Belinda, offer to take Jack back to San Francisco, but he lets Jack know that city life is no place for a wolf; he must let White Fang run free in the wild. Though White Fang cannot understand why Jack is trying to leave him, Jack's efforts by using a stick (which White Fang hated/feared when he was under Smith) finally succeed in scaring the wolfdog off. Later, just as he's boarding the ship back to San Francisco, Jack realizes that his rightful place is in the Yukon and he decides to stay behind alone and live off the land; Alex congratulates him by saying that it is what Jack's father would have wanted. After a short time, White Fang returns to the cabin site where he and Jack are happily reunited.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movieguide.org/reviews/White-Fang.html |title=WHITE FANG &#124; Movieguide &#124; The Family Guide to Movie Reviews |publisher=Movieguide |date=1991-01-18 |accessdate=2013-12-30}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as Jack Conroy, a young man trying to fulfill his father's dying wish to find gold in the treacherous Yukon Valley\n* [[Jed (wolfdog)|Jed the Wolfdog]] as White Fang, an Arctic wolf-Siberian Husky hybrid who starts his life in the wild and becomes more of a dog after he goes to the Indian camp\n* [[Klaus Maria Brandauer]] as Alex Larson, an experienced but gruff miner who knew Jack's father\n* [[Seymour Cassel]] as Clarence 'Skunker' Thurston, Alex's companion\n* [[Susan Hogan (actor)|Susan Hogan]] as Belinda Casey, Alex's lover\n* [[James Remar]] as Beauty Smith, a villainous dogfighter who buys up White Fang to fight dogs\n* Pius Savage as Grey Beaver, a Native American chief who is White Fang's first master\n* [[Bill Moseley]] as Luke, Beauty Smith's colleague\n* Clint Youngreen as Tinker, Beauty Smith's colleague\n* Suzanne Kent as Heather, Belinda's best friend\n* Michael Davis Lally as Sykes, Beauty Smith's archrival\n* Aaron Hotch as Mit-sah, Grey Beaver's son\n* Diane E.

The mystery of the biblical story is that God also laments. Some Christians like to think of God as above all that, knowing everything, in charge of everything, calm and unaffected by the troubles in his world. That's not the picture we get in the Bible. God was grieved to his heart, Genesis declares, over the violent wickedness of his human creatures. He was devastated when his own bride, the people of Israel, turned away from him. And when God came back to his people in person\u2014the story of Jesus is meaningless unless that's what it's about\u2014he wept at the tomb of his friend. St. Paul speaks of the Holy Spirit \"groaning\" within us, as we ourselves groan within the pain of the whole creation. The ancient doctrine of the Trinity teaches us to recognize the One God in the tears of Jesus and the anguish of the Spirit. It is no part of the Christian vocation, then, to be able to explain what's happening and why. In fact, it is part of the Christian vocation not to be able to explain\u2014and to lament instead. As the Spirit laments within us, so we become, even in our self-isolation, small shrines where the presence and healing love of God can dwell. And out of that there can emerge new possibilities, new acts of kindness, new scientific understanding, new hope. New wisdom for our leaders? Now there's a thought. \u2014[[N.T.

T.

The mystery of the biblical story is that God also laments. Some Christians like to think of God as above all that, knowing everything, in charge of everything, calm and unaffected by the troubles in his world. That's not the picture we get in the Bible. God was grieved to his heart, Genesis declares, over the violent wickedness of his human creatures. He was devastated when his own bride, the people of Israel, turned away from him. And when God came back to his people in person\u2014the story of Jesus is meaningless unless that's what it's about\u2014he wept at the tomb of his friend. St. Paul speaks of the Holy Spirit \"groaning\" within us, as we ourselves groan within the pain of the whole creation. The ancient doctrine of the Trinity teaches us to recognize the One God in the tears of Jesus and the anguish of the Spirit. It is no part of the Christian vocation, then, to be able to explain what's happening and why. In fact, it is part of the Christian vocation not to be able to explain\u2014and to lament instead. As the Spirit laments within us, so we become, even in our self-isolation, small shrines where the presence and healing love of God can dwell. And out of that there can emerge new possibilities, new acts of kindness, new scientific understanding, new hope. New wisdom for our leaders? Now there's a thought. \u2014[[N.T.

He was published regularly in science fiction \"[[pulp magazine|pulp]]\" magazines.\n\n==Life and work==\nVincent was born in [[Buffalo, New York]] in 1893. He attended a technical high school, then enrolled in [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]]. Vincent left RPI without completing his freshman year, in order to marry.<ref name=amz38>\"Meet the Authors\", ''Amazing Stories'', December 1938, p.144</ref> He married Ruth Hoff, and they had two children, a son and a daughter. Vincent worked as a mechanical engineer for [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]], specializing in the installation and testing of large electrical apparatus. Later he was employed as a sales engineer, becoming the manager of a local steam division.<ref name=amz38 /><ref name=Bleiler>{{cite book|author1=Bleiler, Everett Franklin |author2=Bleiler, Richard |title=Science-fiction: The Gernsback Years : a Complete Coverage of the Genre Magazines ... from 1926 Through 1936|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PbMdeizaCNcC&pg=PR22 |year=1998 |publisher=Kent State University Press |isbn=978-0-87338-604-3 |page=451}}</ref>\n\nVincent\u2019s writing career began after he began reading [[Hugo Gernsback]]\u2019s pioneering science fiction magazine ''[[Amazing Stories]]''. Vincent\u2019s first published story, \u201cThe Golden Girl of Munan\u201d, appeared in the June 1928 issue of the magazine. During the next fourteen years, Vincent published more than seventy science fiction stories. Although most of his work appeared in the early science fiction magazines, he published twice in the general fiction pulp magazine ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]''.\n\nAlthough he ceased publishing during the early 1940s, Vincent remained involved with science fiction. After relocating to [[Los Angeles]], Vincent joined the [[Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society]] and the Count Dracula Society, as well as attending local science fiction conventions. Vincent resumed writing late in life, publishing the novel ''The Doomsday Planet'' in 1966 and the story \u201cInvader\u201d in the September 1967 issue of ''[[If (magazine)|If]]''.<ref name=Bleiler/>\n\nVincent died in Los Angeles on May 5, 1968 of emphysema and pneumonia complications.\n\n==Works by Harl Vincent==\n[[File:Alex Schomburg - Harl Vincent - Marvel Science Stories for April-May 1939 - Illustration for Newscast.jpg|Illustration to ''Newscast'' in the April\u2013May 1939 issue of ''[[Marvel Science Stories]]''.

In recognition of his public service, he was appointed [[CBE]] by the Queen in the New Year Honours List 2009.<ref name=\"BBC_CBE\">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cambridgeshire/7805364.stm|title=Social Campaigner appointed CBE|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\n== A Post-Capitalist and Post-Socialist Approach to Public Policy ==\n\nSchluter\u2019s approach to public policy was first articulated at book length in ''The R Factor''(1993), co-authored with the writer, David Lee. \n\nThe central argument of the book is that social, economic and political problems in society arise from a lack of prioritization of relationships \u2013 not only personal, but organisational, national and international. All legislation, government and corporate policies and organisational structures impact on the way people relate, but this impact is generally not considered by those making policy decisions. \n\nImprovement in the quality of relationships is not only necessary but also possible \u2013 and if we can enable relational restoration to happen, the quality of life globally can be significantly enhanced. The overall approach can be considered as a critique of Capitalism as well as Socialism, or perhaps even as an alternative framework for public policy. It is sometimes called \u2018Relationism\u2019 or, more commonly, Relational Thinking.\n\n''The R Factor'' was received by many people as a call to action. Even though Schluter has co-authored other books and reports since then (e.g. ''The Jubilee Manifesto'', ''The Relational Manager, Transforming Capitalism from Within, The Relational Lens,'' and ''Confederal Europe''), few publications by any author in the last few decades have had its range of impact on individuals, on families, on organisations, and on structures.\n\n==Relational Thinking==\n\n\u2018\u2019\u2019Relational Thinking\u2019\u2019\u2019 is\n\n* A social philosophy, a broad-based inclusive framework of thinking, explored and developed by Dr Michael Schluter\n* A framework based on the relational values of the Judaeo-Christian tradition as its origins lie in reflection on the biblical social vision.\n* A framework which promotes the idea that all areas of public and private life can and should be seen not just through the financial and economic lenses but through the lens of relationships because it is through strong and resilient relationships that development and cohesion of organisations and communities, and personal well-being and health, are realised.\n* A body of thought that answers important questions about the goals of national life, the purpose of institutions, and lifestyle issues, and the way in which these purposes and goals can be best achieved.\n\nSome Key features of Relational Thinking:\n\n* All public policies and decisions by organisations should be assessed for their contribution to the relational health of those directly involved and of the wider community.\n* A fresh understanding of the way relationships work, called Relational Proximity which explores the effects of communication, time, information, power and purpose on the way inter-personal and inter-organisational relationships are formed and assessed.\n* A new and distinctive understanding of the goals and ethos, the institutional structure and work practices of:\no The education sector o The health sector o The criminal justice sector o The business sector\n* A new and distinctive understanding of the goals and purposes of national development and how it should be measured/assessed, and in particular a fresh understanding of the meaning of development in the context of hi- and low-income countries.\n* A radical critique of the structure of the public limited company and proposals for their re-engineering.\n\nSome initatives putting Relational Thinking into practice:\n\nSchluter has founded two organizations which research relationships, Relationships Foundation and Relational Research.

All legislation, government and corporate policies and organisational structures impact on the way people relate, but this impact is generally not considered by those making policy decisions. \n\nImprovement in the quality of relationships is not only necessary but also possible \u2013 and if we can enable relational restoration to happen, the quality of life globally can be significantly enhanced. The overall approach can be considered as a critique of Capitalism as well as Socialism, or perhaps even as an alternative framework for public policy. It is sometimes called \u2018Relationism\u2019 or, more commonly, Relational Thinking.\n\n''The R Factor'' was received by many people as a call to action. Even though Schluter has co-authored other books and reports since then (e.g. ''The Jubilee Manifesto'', ''The Relational Manager, Transforming Capitalism from Within, The Relational Lens,'' and ''Confederal Europe''), few publications by any author in the last few decades have had its range of impact on individuals, on families, on organisations, and on structures.\n\n==Relational Thinking==\n\n\u2018\u2019\u2019Relational Thinking\u2019\u2019\u2019 is\n\n* A social philosophy, a broad-based inclusive framework of thinking, explored and developed by Dr Michael Schluter\n* A framework based on the relational values of the Judaeo-Christian tradition as its origins lie in reflection on the biblical social vision.\n* A framework which promotes the idea that all areas of public and private life can and should be seen not just through the financial and economic lenses but through the lens of relationships because it is through strong and resilient relationships that development and cohesion of organisations and communities, and personal well-being and health, are realised.\n* A body of thought that answers important questions about the goals of national life, the purpose of institutions, and lifestyle issues, and the way in which these purposes and goals can be best achieved.\n\nSome Key features of Relational Thinking:\n\n* All public policies and decisions by organisations should be assessed for their contribution to the relational health of those directly involved and of the wider community.\n* A fresh understanding of the way relationships work, called Relational Proximity which explores the effects of communication, time, information, power and purpose on the way inter-personal and inter-organisational relationships are formed and assessed.\n* A new and distinctive understanding of the goals and ethos, the institutional structure and work practices of:\no The education sector o The health sector o The criminal justice sector o The business sector\n* A new and distinctive understanding of the goals and purposes of national development and how it should be measured/assessed, and in particular a fresh understanding of the meaning of development in the context of hi- and low-income countries.\n* A radical critique of the structure of the public limited company and proposals for their re-engineering.\n\nSome initatives putting Relational Thinking into practice:\n\nSchluter has founded two organizations which research relationships, Relationships Foundation and Relational Research. A number of practical and more specific initiatives based on the relational approach have developed out of his work. These include Credit Action to help tackle the effects of consumer debt, which subsequently became part of the Money Charity; Allia which tackles unemployment and funding of social enterprise through encouraging the use of capital to achieve social outcomes; and Relational Schools which seeks to reform the culture and values in schools. Another initiative has been the Marriage Foundation, which promotes long-term committed relationship through the institution of marriage. \u00a0 \n\n''The R Factor'' sets out the five essential dimensions of any and every relationship (personal, organisational or international). Those dimensions are collectively referred to as the Relational Proximity Framework. Schluter recognised that measurement of quality of relationships was crucial if relational assessment was to be used in public decision making. In an organisational context, any relationship measurement must be two-sided, because, to state the obvious, no relationship is one-sided. The measurement process and tools are referred to as \u201crelational analytics\u201d.
