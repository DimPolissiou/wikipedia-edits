Senku sets up a basecamp and begins to study the petrified humans. Senku learns his revival was made possible with [[nitric acid]], reviving his friend Taiju Oki, their classmate Yuzuriha Ogawa, and a martial artist named Tsukasa Shishio to rebuild their civilization. Tsukasa opposes Senku's idea of forming a new scientific civilization and instead desires a new order to the world base on power. Nearly killing Senku, Tsukasa leaves and begins his own faction of the stone world.\n\n\nSenku then discovers a tribe of people already living on the planet and sees this as an opportunity to create his kingdom of science. The town is originally hesitant, but eventually learn the benefits of science to their survival. Over time, Senku becomes more trusted by the town, eventually being taught of their past to discover that the village was started by Senku's father figure as well as 5 other astronauts who happened to be in space at the time of petrification. Together with his new villager friends, Senku engages a Stone War with Tsukasa's clan. After Senku's Kingdom of Science wins, they end up facing a new enemy in a tribe known as the Petrification Kingdom, who possess the device used to petrify the world 3,700 years ago.\n\n==Media==\n===Manga===\n{{See also|List of Dr. Stone chapters}}\nWritten by [[Riichiro Inagaki]] and illustrated by [[Boichi]], ''Dr. Stone'' was launched in the 14th issue of [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' on March 6, 2017.<ref name=shonenjumpmag>{{cite web |title=Shonen Jump Magazine to Launch 6 New Series By Kuroko's Basketball, Beelzebub, More Authors |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-01-26/shonen-jump-magazine-to-launch-6-new-series-by-kuroko-basketball-beelzebub-more-authors/.111485 |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=June 1, 2018}}</ref> It was one from a number of story proposals Inagaki brought to his editor, who chose it because he had no idea how it would develop.

Senku sets up a basecamp and begins to study the petrified humans. Senku learns his revival was made possible with [[nitric acid]], reviving his friend Taiju Oki, their classmate Yuzuriha Ogawa, and a martial artist named Tsukasa Shishio to rebuild their civilization. Tsukasa opposes Senku's idea of forming a new scientific civilization and instead desires a new order to the world base on power. Nearly killing Senku, Tsukasa leaves and begins his own faction of the stone world.\n\n\nSenku then discovers a tribe of people already living on the planet and sees this as an opportunity to create his kingdom of science. The town is originally hesitant, but eventually learn the benefits of science to their survival. Over time, Senku becomes more trusted by the town, eventually being taught of their past to discover that the village was started by Senku's father figure as well as 5 other astronauts who happened to be in space at the time of petrification. Together with his new villager friends, Senku engages a Stone War with Tsukasa's clan. After Senku's Kingdom of Science wins, they end up facing a new enemy in a tribe known as the Petrification Kingdom, who possess the device used to petrify the world 3,700 years ago.\n\n==Media==\n===Manga===\n{{See also|List of Dr. Stone chapters}}\nWritten by [[Riichiro Inagaki]] and illustrated by [[Boichi]], ''Dr. Stone'' was launched in the 14th issue of [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' on March 6, 2017.<ref name=shonenjumpmag>{{cite web |title=Shonen Jump Magazine to Launch 6 New Series By Kuroko's Basketball, Beelzebub, More Authors |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-01-26/shonen-jump-magazine-to-launch-6-new-series-by-kuroko-basketball-beelzebub-more-authors/.111485 |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=June 1, 2018}}</ref> It was one from a number of story proposals Inagaki brought to his editor, who chose it because he had no idea how it would develop.

Obama, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[Illinois]], took office following a decisive victory over [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[John McCain]] in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]]. Four years later, in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 election]], he defeated Republican [[Mitt Romney]] to win re-election. He was the [[List of United States Presidential firsts#Barack Obama|first]] [[African American]] president, the first [[multiracial]] president, the first non-white president, and the first president to have been born in [[Hawaii]]. Obama was succeeded by Republican [[Donald Trump]], who won the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]].\n\nObama's first-term actions addressed the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|global financial crisis]] and included a [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|major stimulus package]], a partial extension of the [[Bush tax cuts]], legislation to [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|reform health care]], a major [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|financial regulation reform bill]], and the end of a major US [[Iraq War|military presence]] in [[Iraq]]. Obama also appointed [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] Justices [[Elena Kagan]] and [[Sonia Sotomayor]], the latter of whom became the first [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic American]] on the Supreme Court. Democrats controlled both houses of Congress until Republicans won a majority in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in the [[2010 United States elections|2010 elections]]. Following the elections, Obama and Congressional Republicans engaged in a protracted stand-off over government spending levels and the [[United States debt ceiling|debt ceiling]]. The Obama administration's policy against terrorism downplayed Bush's counterinsurgency model, expanding air strikes and making extensive use of special forces and encouraging greater reliance on host-government militaries. The Obama administration orchestrated the [[Death of Osama bin Laden#Operation Neptune Spear|military operation]] that resulted in the [[death of Osama bin Laden]] in 2011.\n\nIn his second term, Obama took steps to combat [[climate change]], signing a major [[Paris Agreement|international climate agreement]] and an [[executive order]] to limit [[greenhouse gas|carbon emissions]]. Obama also presided over the implementation of the [[Affordable Care Act]] and other legislation passed in his first term, and he negotiated rapprochements with Iran and Cuba. The number of American soldiers in Afghanistan fell dramatically during Obama's second term, though U.S. soldiers remained in Afghanistan throughout Obama's presidency and [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|continue to as of 2019]]. Republicans took control of the Senate after the [[2014 United States elections|2014 elections]], and Obama continued to grapple with Congressional Republicans over government spending, immigration, judicial nominations, and other issues.\n\n==Major acts and legislation==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n'''Economic policy actions'''\n* Responding to the [[Great Recession]]\n** [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]]\n** [[Effects of the 2008\u201310 automotive industry crisis on the United States|Automotive industry bailout]]\n* [[Wall Street]] reform\n** [[Credit CARD Act of 2009]]\n** [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]]\n* Taxation and spending\n** [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]]\n** [[Budget Control Act of 2011]]\n** [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]]\n** [[2016 United States federal budget#Budget agreement|Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015]]\n* 2013 [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2013|debt ceiling crisis]] and [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013|government shutdown]]\n** [[Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014]]\n** [[Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013]]\n'''Other domestic policy actions\n* [[Health care reform in the United States|Healthcare reform]]\n** [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]\n** [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010]]\n* [[Education in the United States|Education]]\n** [[Race to the Top]] competitive grant program\n** [[Every Student Succeeds Act]]\n* [[Climate change]]\n** [[Clean Power Plan]]\n* [[Immigration policy]]\n** [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]]\n** [[Deferred Action for Parents of Americans]] ([[United States v.

The response was to cut education budgets.  Obama's $800 billion stimulus package included $100 billion for public schools, which every state used to protect its educational budget.  However, in terms of sponsoring innovation, Obama and his Education Secretary [[Arne Duncan]] pursued K-12 education reform through the [[Race to the Top]] grant program.  With over $15 billion of grants at stake, 34 states quickly revised their education laws according to the proposals of advanced educational reformers. In the competition points were awarded for allowing charter schools to multiply, for compensating teachers on a merit basis including student test scores, and for adopting higher educational standards. There were incentives for states to establish college and career-ready standards, which in practice meant adopting the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]] that had been developed on a bipartisan basis by the [[National Governors Association]], and the [[Council of Chief State School Officers]]. The criteria were not mandatory, they were incentives to improve opportunities to get a grant. Most states revised their laws accordingly,  even though they realized it was unlikely they would when a highly competitive new grant.  Race to the Top had strong bipartisan support, with centrist elements from both parties.  It was opposed by the left wing of the Democratic Party, and by the right wing of the Republican Party, and criticized for centralizing too much power in Washington.  Complaints also came from middle-class families, who were annoyed at the increasing emphasis on teaching to the test, rather than encouraging teachers to show creativity and stimulating students' imagination.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jonathan |last=Zimmerman |chapter=Education in the Age of Obama: The Paradox of Consensus |editor=Zelizer |title=The Presidency of Barack Obama |pages=111\u2013126 |jstor=j.ctvc777dh.12 |year=2018 |isbn=9780691160283 |publisher=Princeton University Press }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0895904811425911 |title=Stimulating Reform |journal=Educational Policy |volume=26 |pages=136\u2013159 |year=2012 |last1=McGuinn |first1=Patrick }}</ref>\n\nObama also advocated for universal [[pre-kindergarten]] programs,<ref name=ebadger2>{{cite news|last1=Badger|first1=Emily|title=Why conservatives should get behind Obama's push for universal Pre-K|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/02/02/why-conservatives-should-get-behind-obamas-push-for-universal-pre-k/|accessdate=November 16, 2015|work=The Washington Post|date=February 2, 2015}}</ref> and two free years of community college for everyone.<ref name=jhdavis>{{cite news|last1=Hirschfield Davis|first1=Julie|title=Obama Will Seek to Raise Taxes on Wealthy to Finance Cuts for Middle Class|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/us/president-obama-will-seek-to-reduce-taxes-for-middle-class.html|accessdate=November 17, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=January 17, 2015}}</ref> Through her [[Let's Move]] program and advocacy of healthier school lunches, First Lady [[Michelle Obama]] focused attention on [[childhood obesity]], which was three times higher in 2008 than it had been in 1974.<ref name=kliptak2>{{cite news|last1=Liptak|first1=Kevin|title=Michelle Obama's Let's Move turns 5; Is it working?|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/06/politics/michelle-obamas-lets-move-turns-5-is-it-working/|accessdate=December 19, 2015|publisher=CNN|date=April 6, 2015}}</ref> In December 2015, Obama signed the [[Every Student Succeeds Act]], a bipartisan bill that reauthorized federally mandated testing but shrank the federal government's role in education, especially with regard to troubled schools.<ref name=ESSA>{{cite news|last1=Hirschfield Davis|first1=Julie|title=President Obama Signs Into Law a Rewrite of No Child Left Behind|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/11/us/politics/president-obama-signs-into-law-a-rewrite-of-no-child-left-behind.html|accessdate=December 11, 2015|work=The New York Times|date=December 10, 2015}}</ref> The law also ended the use of waivers by the Education Secretary.<ref name=ESSA/> In post-secondary education, Obama signed the [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010]], which ended the role of private banks in lending out federally insured [[student loan]]s,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/30/the-last-piece-in-place/ | work=The New York Times | title=The Last Piece in Place | first=David M. | last=Herszenhorn | date=March 30, 2010 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref> created a new income-based loan repayment plan known as [[Pay as You Earn (PAYE) - Federal Student Loan Relief Program|Pay as You Earn]], and increased the amount of [[Pell Grant]] awards given each year.<ref name=\"CBSNews\">{{cite news|last=Madison|first=Lucy |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20126172-503544/who-will-benefit-from-obamas-student-loan-plan/|title=Who will benefit from Obama's student loan plan? |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=October 26, 2011 |accessdate=May 14, 2012}}</ref> He also instituted new regulations on [[for-profit college]]s, including a \"gainful employment\" rule that restricted federal funding from colleges that failed to adequately prepare graduates for careers.<ref name=agrasgreen>{{cite news|last1=Grasgreen|first1=Allie|title=Obama pushes for-profit colleges to the brink|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/barack-obama-pushes-for-profit-colleges-to-the-brink-119613|accessdate=January 11, 2016|publisher=Politico|date=July 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Immigration===\n{{see also|Immigration to the United States}}\nFrom the beginning of his presidency, Obama supported comprehensive immigration reform, including a pathway to citizenship for many immigrants illegally residing in the United States.<ref name=thompson1>{{cite news|last1=Thompson|first1=Cheryl|title=Obama Says Immigration Reform Is a Priority, but Won't Happen Soon|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/10/AR2009081001797.html|accessdate=November 14, 2015|work=The Washington Post|date=August 11, 2009}}</ref> However, Congress did not pass a comprehensive immigration bill during Obama's tenure, and Obama turned to executive actions.

Obama, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[Illinois]], took office following a decisive victory over [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[John McCain]] in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]]. Four years later, in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012 election]], he defeated Republican [[Mitt Romney]] to win re-election. He was the [[List of United States Presidential firsts#Barack Obama|first]] [[African American]] president, the first [[multiracial]] president, the first non-white president, and the first president to have been born in [[Hawaii]]. Obama was succeeded by Republican [[Donald Trump]], who won the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]].\n\nObama's first-term actions addressed the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|global financial crisis]] and included a [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|major stimulus package]], a partial extension of the [[Bush tax cuts]], legislation to [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|reform health care]], a major [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|financial regulation reform bill]], and the end of a major US [[Iraq War|military presence]] in [[Iraq]]. Obama also appointed [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] Justices [[Elena Kagan]] and [[Sonia Sotomayor]], the latter of whom became the first [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic American]] on the Supreme Court. Democrats controlled both houses of Congress until Republicans won a majority in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in the [[2010 United States elections|2010 elections]]. Following the elections, Obama and Congressional Republicans engaged in a protracted stand-off over government spending levels and the [[United States debt ceiling|debt ceiling]]. The Obama administration's policy against terrorism downplayed Bush's counterinsurgency model, expanding air strikes and making extensive use of special forces and encouraging greater reliance on host-government militaries. The Obama administration orchestrated the [[Death of Osama bin Laden#Operation Neptune Spear|military operation]] that resulted in the [[death of Osama bin Laden]] in 2011.\n\nIn his second term, Obama took steps to combat [[climate change]], signing a major [[Paris Agreement|international climate agreement]] and an [[executive order]] to limit [[greenhouse gas|carbon emissions]]. Obama also presided over the implementation of the [[Affordable Care Act]] and other legislation passed in his first term, and he negotiated rapprochements with Iran and Cuba. The number of American soldiers in Afghanistan fell dramatically during Obama's second term, though U.S. soldiers remained in Afghanistan throughout Obama's presidency and [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|continue to as of 2019]]. Republicans took control of the Senate after the [[2014 United States elections|2014 elections]], and Obama continued to grapple with Congressional Republicans over government spending, immigration, judicial nominations, and other issues.\n\n==Major acts and legislation==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n'''Economic policy actions'''\n* Responding to the [[Great Recession]]\n** [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]]\n** [[Effects of the 2008\u201310 automotive industry crisis on the United States|Automotive industry bailout]]\n* [[Wall Street]] reform\n** [[Credit CARD Act of 2009]]\n** [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]]\n* Taxation and spending\n** [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]]\n** [[Budget Control Act of 2011]]\n** [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]]\n** [[2016 United States federal budget#Budget agreement|Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015]]\n* 2013 [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2013|debt ceiling crisis]] and [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013|government shutdown]]\n** [[Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014]]\n** [[Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013]]\n'''Other domestic policy actions\n* [[Health care reform in the United States|Healthcare reform]]\n** [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]\n** [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010]]\n* [[Education in the United States|Education]]\n** [[Race to the Top]] competitive grant program\n** [[Every Student Succeeds Act]]\n* [[Climate change]]\n** [[Clean Power Plan]]\n* [[Immigration policy]]\n** [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]]\n** [[Deferred Action for Parents of Americans]] ([[United States v.

The response was to cut education budgets.  Obama's $800 billion stimulus package included $100 billion for public schools, which every state used to protect its educational budget.  However, in terms of sponsoring innovation, Obama and his Education Secretary [[Arne Duncan]] pursued K-12 education reform through the [[Race to the Top]] grant program.  With over $15 billion of grants at stake, 34 states quickly revised their education laws according to the proposals of advanced educational reformers. In the competition points were awarded for allowing charter schools to multiply, for compensating teachers on a merit basis including student test scores, and for adopting higher educational standards. There were incentives for states to establish college and career-ready standards, which in practice meant adopting the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]] that had been developed on a bipartisan basis by the [[National Governors Association]], and the [[Council of Chief State School Officers]]. The criteria were not mandatory, they were incentives to improve opportunities to get a grant. Most states revised their laws accordingly,  even though they realized it was unlikely they would when a highly competitive new grant.  Race to the Top had strong bipartisan support, with centrist elements from both parties.

The village is on the top of a hill surrounded by mountains, a lake, and brushland. Ameno contains numerous ancient homes and castles belonging to noble families from Turin and Milan who vacationed in Ameno during the summer. In its territory, the municipality has the [[Santuario della Madonna della Bocciola]]. Every June, the village hosts a [[Blues]] festival in Ameno.<ref>[http://www.amenoblues.it Ameno Blues Festival]</ref>\n\n== History ==\nBetween 1915 and 1938, archaeological research conducted in the town of Lortallo revealed one of the most important necropolises of the early [[Iron Age]] (known as Ameno F). The whole of the necropolises has tombs dating back from the 9th to the 5th century BC. These findings are related to [[Golasecca culture]], a culture common to various Celtic tribal groups who lived in the early Iron Age in western [[Lombardy]], [[Novara]] and [[Canton of Ticino]]. The territory of Ameno has also returned other interesting artifacts of the ancient population of [[Cusio, Lombardy|Cusio]], ranging from the [[Middle bronze age|Middle Bronze Age]] (XVI - XIV century BC) to the [[Imperial Roman]] period. The importance of the site of Ameno in prehistoric and protohistoric times is because of the fertile and healthy plateau that offers land suitable for crops and grazing. The area allowed the control of an passage, strategically placed between the lake and [[Agogna Valley]].  The lake was an easy link with Ossola and the Alpine passes; the Agogna valley was an active terrestrial itinerary from the most ancient prehistory, probably more suitable for the transhumance of the herds of animals from the Novara plain to the mountains rather than for the exchange of goods, which preferred instead the Ticino waterway.  In Roman times, the road was strengthened with the construction of a road from Novara to Ossola, as evidenced by the numerous Roman findings that punctuate the most probable route.  Finally, we cannot forget the paths that could easily lead from Cusio to Verbano, which in prehistoric times was the most important commercial route between the Adriatic and the Alps with Ticino and the Po.\n\n=== Bronze Age Findings ===\nIn 1992, while a fence was being installed around the cemetery of Ameno in Borgo del Magnanoa, a significant quantity of ceramic material from the Bronze Age was found by Walter Baronchelli. The materials are now kept by the Municipality of Ameno.  A subsequent excavation test carried out in 1994 highlighted ceramic objects that were for domestic use coming from a nearby settlement, dating back to the Middle Bronze Age.\n\n=== The sepulchers of Lortallo ===\nAt the foot of the ridge on which the town of Lortallo stands (467 meters above sea level) there is a small valley that separates it from the Garulo farmhouse and from Monte Mesma (576 m [[Metres above sea level|above sea level]]).  It is accessible from the north and going up from the Rio Membra, a small tributary of the Agogna.  To the south the valley narrows and runs out at the foot of the Mesma.  In this place in 1915, when the modern road to Bolzano Novarese was built, the first tomb of the necropolis was discovered.  Since then and for more than thirty years [[Pietro Barocelli]], one of the fathers of Italian paleontology, and the engineer [[Giulio Decio]], honorary Inspector of the Superintendency, have conducted systematic research campaigns that led to the discovery of numerous burials attributable above all to the early Iron Age .\n\nThe archaeological areas of Lortallo, were indicated by burial ground, followed with letters of the alphabet:\n\n* Ameno A burial ground, in Lortallino (tombs 1-2 and 139-143)\n* Ameno B burial ground, in Lortallo (tombs nos. 3-46)\n* Ameno C burial ground, in the locality of Lortallo, villa Broglio (findings from the Roman rooster era)\n* Sepulcreto Ameno D, in the locality of Lortallo, Decio factory (various fragments and objects from the Roman age)\n* Ameno E burial ground, in Mesma (tombs nos. 47 and 48-63)\n* Ameno F burial ground in Mesma (tombs nos. 64-126 and 127-138)\n\nThe tombs, were used by the Culture of Golasecca to bury their dead. The dead were indirectly incinerated, with the deposition of the bones of the deceased, personal objects (bronze and iron fibulae, bronze pendants and bracelets) and the ashes of the funeral put within a ceramic urn. In the most ancient phases this was laid, sometimes covered by a bowl used as a lid, in a simple hole in the ground or in a small box made with thin stone slabs. In the more recent phases, the funerary equipment is enriched with the deposition of accessory vases inside stone cysts made with large slabs.  There are also wells lined with pebbles to form a small vault.  Stone structures built above and around the tombs have also been identified, serving as markers for the tombs themselves.  As remains of offerings, some wells dug near the tombs and the numerous ceramic fragments found in the surrounding terrain must be interpreted.  The acidity of the soil, which does not allow the conservation of organic remains, destroyed the traces of offers of vegetable and animal food to the deceased.  Inside the cinerary urns, charred hazelnuts were sometimes preserved, which had been laid on the funeral pyre together with the deceased.  In many cases the presence of ceramic glasses with the function of beverage containers offered to the deceased was observed inside the cineraries.  Studies conducted on contemporary necropolises have made it possible to establish whether it is beer or wine.\n\n==== Ameno A ====\nOn 22 July 1915 , in Lortallino, during the excavation works of the road from Bolzano Novarese to Ameno, two burials were identified.  The research conducted by the Superintendency to verify whether it was isolated tombs or a necropolis was initially unsuccessful, but it was understood that other burials must have been present in the area.  In the summer of 1936, following the accidental discovery of a new tomb (A 140), the honorary Inspector of Monuments for the Riviera di San Giulio , engineer Giulio Decio, conducted new excavations, identifying three other burials (A 141-143) .  The materials identified can be dated from Golasecca IC to II A (690-550 BC).\n\n==== Ameno B ====\nIn 1916, two burials were accidentally discovered in Lortallino.  The systematic excavations conducted under the direction of Barocelli in 1917 and 1920 allowed the discovery of 42 other well-shaped burials defended by lithic slabs, surrounded and covered by structures, paved and dry stone walls.  In Ameno B, burials with over-roofs represent a high percentage of the depositions and cannot be connected to kits of particular importance, but have an interesting analogy with those of the necropolises of Minusio , Solduno and Mesocco in the Canton of Ticino , where the relationship between their shape and the sex of the deceased, with the use of circular paving for male and rectangular burials for female ones.  The Ameno B necropolis was used by Golasecca IC at II AB (690-525 BC).\n\n==== Ameno C ====\nIn 1899, in Lortallo, while building a factory, various objects from the Roman age were unearthed in mixed soil of coals. In September 1919, further work carried out there found light clay fragments from Roman ruins.\n\n==== Ameno D ====\nIn 1923, in Villa Broglio park, Roman clay fragments were accidentally found alongside a cremation tomb containing a corroded medium bronze imperial coin, from the [[Augustan Age]].  In 1926, the remains of a wall built by the Romans were discovered neargy.\n\n==== Ameno E ====\nThe first tomb (E 47) was identified on 10 June 1915 on the western slopes of Mount Mesma. It was found during the excavation for the extension of the country road destined to become the road from [[Bolzano Novarese]] to Ameno.  Barocelli, who went to the place for investigations, noticed the traces of tampering with other tombs, of which \"a very large quantity of clay fragments, mixed with burnt bones and very few traces of bronze objects\" was found.  New essays conducted by Pietro Barocelli and Decio in 1922-1923 north of the road in Mesma allowed the identification of other burials (E 48-63), with abundant ceramic equipment and with some stone superstructures.  The area seemed disturbed by Roman interventions (tiles and bricks interspersed with heaps of stones were found), while the necropolis seemed to run out on the edge of an ancient peat bog.  The tombs are framed mainly in the Golasecca IC phase (690 - 600 BC)\n\n==== Ameno F ====\nThe first excavations in the area of the burial ground F, a short distance from Ameno E, were carried out at the beginning of 1928. In that year, in need of building stones, the Decio had excavations carried out in a field at the foot of Mesma, where the remains of a stone wall emerged, finding some tombs from the early Iron and Rooster Roman age.  The excavations continued on several occasions until 1936 bringing to light numerous burials (F 64-138).  The necropolis \"F\" of Ameno, the oldest among those identified in Ameno, is one of the most important for the study of the beginnings of the Iron Age in the context of the Culture of Golasecca.  Characteristics of this necropolis are the biconical or biconical ovoid cinerary urns with decoration made of a false string and pairs of small handles on the maximum expansion and the ovoid urns with decoration in metopal squares with geometric or figured motifs.  The latter, rare in the Golasecchian culture which prefers geometric decoration, are stylized quadrupedal figures, generally interpreted as equine.  The \"ponies\" of Ameno, chronologically limited to the ninth century BC, are perhaps to be related to the coeval spread of horse riding in northern Italy and the consequent decline of the oldest tradition of chariot fighting.  It does not seem accidental that this figurative motif is widespread mainly in the area between Ameno and Castelletto Ticino , a territory which still today offers ideal characteristics for the breeding of horses.  The necropolis F was used for several centuries.  Although the most frequented phase is Golasecca I A1 (c. 935 - 800 BC), there are in fact more recent isolated tombs up to G.

During excavation works, around hundred meters south of the burial ground F, numerous fragments of clay belonging to Iron Age tombs were unearthed. Two intact burials with relatively well-preserved ceramic could be recovered. Olles, vases and bowls high foot datable to Golasecca II.  No further excavations were carried out in the area.

The research led to the identification, in various points, of fragments of protohistoric domestic pottery in a secondary position, bronze fibulae and remains of clay fictile from the Roman period.  These discoveries led the Decio to hypothesize the presence of a built-up area on the well-stocked summit of Mount Mesma , from which the surrounding area is easily dominated.  An indirect confirmation of the strategic value of the place, centuries later, is given by the construction in the Middle Ages of a castle, probably in 1200 , by the Municipality of Novara .  The present Franciscan monastery was later built on the ruins of this.  The necropolises discovered in Lortallo were located along the main access road to the town, according to a use widely attested in the early Iron Age .  The village on Mesma was the most important, but probably not the only inhabited center.  According to the use of the golasecchiano world, smaller nuclei, linked to the main by clanic constraints, had to rise on the surrounding hills.  Coeval ceramic remains were in fact recovered in Lortallo and on the Buccione hill.\n\n=== The Roman age ===\nThe Roman period is less documented in Ameno than the Iron Age is.  At Lortallo and on the Mesma, there are lots of tourists, but since what they've found relating to the period are isolated and accidentally found, it is not currently possible to reconstruct the general picture of the settlement.  The findings made on the rest of the territory have unfortunately gone missing, like the Roman vase found at about one meter deep in 1931 , inside the park of the Villa Calabi, in Vacciago.  In 1693 , as the historian Lazzaro Agostino Cotta writes, Giovanni Battista Bertochino had found some imperial Roman coins of the III and IV century in a fund of his in the \"castle\" locality.\n\n== Monuments and Places of Interest ==\n[[File:Ameno parrocchiale.jpg|thumb|Parish Church of Santa Maria Assunta in Ameno]]\nThe Parish Church of the Assumption is clearly visible even from afar thanks to its spire bell tower.  With three naves , it was built in the first half of the fourteenth century on the site of an ancient church that tradition claims was founded by San Giulio .  The bell tower was built in 1505 with large granite stones, in late Romanesque and Renaissance style .  In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the town experienced a very remarkable artistic-religious flowering with the construction and restoration of sixteen churches in baroque forms , each with valuable frescoes and furnishings.  Notable examples are found in the Cusian architecture of the time: the facade of the Church of San Giovanni Battista , that of San Rocco in the capital and San Giovanni Battista in Cassano.\n\nIn the hamlet of Vacciago it is worth noting the valuable architecture of the Casa Calderara, with its triple Renaissance loggia .  It is the seat of the \"Calderara Foundation\" a gallery of contemporary art , a foundation created by the painter Antonio Calderara ( Abbiategrasso 1903 - Vacciago di Ameno 1978) who at his death wanted to make his home and his collection of paintings available to the public. and that of other avant-garde artists with whom he had friendship and artistic collaboration.\n\nOther notable Renaissance examples are the 16th century Church of Sant'Antonio, and the spectacular Oratory of Sant'Anna, located in the locality of Vacciaghetto, as well as the Sanctuary of the Madonna della Bocciola .  The sanctuary recalls the apparition of the Virgin, on a hawthorn bush to a silent shepherdess, Giulia Manfredi, who in 1564 prayed devoutly at the rustic chapel.  The girl began to speak, but only for a few days, because according to the testimonies she soon died in church at the foot of the pulpit .  A religious festival is celebrated annually on the first Sunday of September and always attracts a large number of people.  We find in the hamlet of Lortallo, a small baroque oratory dedicated to San Grato which houses the ''altarpiece'' of Giovan Battista Discepoli with the ''Madonna and Child and Saints Grato and San Bernardo di Mentone'' .  Near the seventeenth-century Oratory of San Grato there is a tower dating back to the thirteenth century .  A second tower is located inside a private house.\n\nOn Monte Mesma there is the Franciscan Convent, built in 1619 on a castle's ruins. The castle was built in 1200 by the municipality of [[Novara]], but was destroyed in 1358 by men from Lortallo and Ameno, angered by the municipality's abuses against them. The convent consists of a church flanked by two fine baroque cloisters with gray stone roofs.  Inside there is an ancient and remarkable large Oira serpentine marble stove which still serves to heat, during the winter, the meditations and prayers of the friars who live in the Franciscan convent .  Here, on New Year's Eve, a peace vigil has been taking place for years that attracts young people from all over the province.\n\n== Culture ==\nIn the town of Vacciago there is a collection of contemporary art that the artist, Antonio Calderara left as a showcase of the avant-garde artistic trends from around 1920 to 1978, the year when he died.

The village is on the top of a hill surrounded by mountains, a lake, and brushland. Ameno contains numerous ancient homes and castles belonging to noble families from Turin and Milan who vacationed in Ameno during the summer. In its territory, the municipality has the [[Santuario della Madonna della Bocciola]]. Every June, the village hosts a [[Blues]] festival in Ameno.<ref>[http://www.amenoblues.it Ameno Blues Festival]</ref>\n\n== History ==\nArchaeological research conducted in the town of Lortallo between 1915 and 1938 revealed one of the most important necropolises of the early [[Iron Age]] (known as Ameno F). The whole of the necropolises has tombs dating back from the 9th to the 5th century BC. These findings are related to [[Golasecca culture]], a culture common to various Celtic tribal groups who lived in the early Iron Age in western [[Lombardy]], [[Novara]] and [[Canton of Ticino]]. The territory of Ameno has also returned other interesting artifacts of the ancient population of [[Cusio, Lombardy|Cusio]], ranging from the [[Middle bronze age|Middle Bronze Age]] (XVI - XIV century BC) to the [[Imperial Roman]] period. The importance of the site of Ameno in prehistoric and protohistoric times is because of the fertile and healthy plateau that offers land suitable for crops and grazing. The area allowed the control of an passage, strategically placed between the lake and [[Agogna Valley]].  The lake was an easy link with Ossola and the Alpine passes; the Agogna valley was an active terrestrial itinerary from the most ancient prehistory, probably more suitable for the transhumance of the herds of animals from the Novara plain to the mountains rather than for the exchange of goods, which preferred instead the Ticino waterway.  In Roman times, the road was strengthened with the construction of a road from Novara to Ossola, as evidenced by the numerous Roman findings that punctuate the most probable route.  Finally, we cannot forget the paths that could easily lead from Cusio to Verbano, which in prehistoric times was the most important commercial route between the Adriatic and the Alps with Ticino and the Po.\n\n=== Bronze Age Findings ===\nIn 1992, while a fence was being installed around the cemetery of Ameno in Borgo del Magnanoa, a significant quantity of ceramic material from the Bronze Age was found by Walter Baronchelli. The materials are now kept by the Municipality of Ameno.  A subsequent excavation test carried out in 1994 highlighted ceramic objects that were for domestic use coming from a nearby settlement, dating back to the Middle Bronze Age.\n\n=== The sepulchers of Lortallo ===\nAt the foot of the ridge on which the town of Lortallo stands (467 meters above sea level) there is a small valley that separates it from the Garulo farmhouse and from Monte Mesma (576 m [[Metres above sea level|above sea level]]).  It is accessible from the north and going up from the Rio Membra, a small tributary of the Agogna.  To the south the valley narrows and runs out at the foot of the Mesma.  In this place in 1915, when the modern road to Bolzano Novarese was built, the first tomb of the necropolis was discovered.  Since then and for more than thirty years [[Pietro Barocelli]], one of the fathers of Italian paleontology, and the engineer [[Giulio Decio]], honorary Inspector of the Superintendency, have conducted systematic research campaigns that led to the discovery of numerous burials attributable above all to the early Iron Age .\n\nThe archaeological areas of Lortallo, were indicated by burial ground, followed with letters of the alphabet:\n\n* Ameno A burial ground, in Lortallino (tombs 1-2 and 139-143)\n* Ameno B burial ground, in Lortallo (tombs nos. 3-46)\n* Ameno C burial ground, in the locality of Lortallo, villa Broglio (findings from the Roman rooster era)\n* Sepulcreto Ameno D, in the locality of Lortallo, Decio factory (various fragments and objects from the Roman age)\n* Ameno E burial ground, in Mesma (tombs nos. 47 and 48-63)\n* Ameno F burial ground in Mesma (tombs nos. 64-126 and 127-138)\n\nThe tombs, were used by the Culture of Golasecca to bury their dead. The dead were indirectly incinerated, with the deposition of the bones of the deceased, personal objects (bronze and iron fibulae, bronze pendants and bracelets) and the ashes of the funeral put within a ceramic urn. In the most ancient phases this was laid, sometimes covered by a bowl used as a lid, in a simple hole in the ground or in a small box made with thin stone slabs. In the more recent phases, the funerary equipment is enriched with the deposition of accessory vases inside stone cysts made with large slabs.  There are also wells lined with pebbles to form a small vault.  Stone structures built above and around the tombs have also been identified, serving as markers for the tombs themselves.  As remains of offerings, some wells dug near the tombs and the numerous ceramic fragments found in the surrounding terrain must be interpreted.  The acidity of the soil, which does not allow the conservation of organic remains, destroyed the traces of offers of vegetable and animal food to the deceased.  Inside the cinerary urns, charred hazelnuts were sometimes preserved, which had been laid on the funeral pyre together with the deceased.  In many cases the presence of ceramic glasses with the function of beverage containers offered to the deceased was observed inside the cineraries.  Studies conducted on contemporary necropolises have made it possible to establish whether it is beer or wine.\n\n==== Ameno A ====\nOn 22 July 1915 , in Lortallino, during the excavation works of the road from Bolzano Novarese to Ameno, two burials were identified.  The research conducted by the Superintendency to verify whether it was isolated tombs or a necropolis was initially unsuccessful, but it was understood that other burials must have been present in the area.  In the summer of 1936, following the accidental discovery of a new tomb (A 140), the honorary Inspector of Monuments for the Riviera di San Giulio , engineer Giulio Decio, conducted new excavations, identifying three other burials (A 141-143) .  The materials identified can be dated from Golasecca IC to II A (690-550 BC).\n\n==== Ameno B ====\nIn 1916, two burials were accidentally discovered in Lortallino.  The systematic excavations conducted under the direction of Barocelli in 1917 and 1920 allowed the discovery of 42 other well-shaped burials defended by lithic slabs, surrounded and covered by structures, paved and dry stone walls.  In Ameno B, burials with over-roofs represent a high percentage of the depositions and cannot be connected to kits of particular importance, but have an interesting analogy with those of the necropolises of Minusio , Solduno and Mesocco in the Canton of Ticino , where the relationship between their shape and the sex of the deceased, with the use of circular paving for male and rectangular burials for female ones.  The Ameno B necropolis was used by Golasecca IC at II AB (690-525 BC).\n\n==== Ameno C ====\nIn 1899, in Lortallo, while building a factory, various objects from the Roman age were unearthed in mixed soil of coals. In September 1919, further work carried out there found light clay fragments from Roman ruins.\n\n==== Ameno D ====\nIn 1923, in Villa Broglio park, Roman clay fragments were accidentally found alongside a cremation tomb containing a corroded medium bronze imperial coin, from the [[Augustan Age]].  In 1926, the remains of a wall built by the Romans were discovered neargy.\n\n==== Ameno E ====\nThe first tomb (E 47) was identified on 10 June 1915 on the western slopes of Mount Mesma. It was found during the excavation for the extension of the country road destined to become the road from [[Bolzano Novarese]] to Ameno.  Barocelli, who went to the place for investigations, noticed the traces of tampering with other tombs, of which \"a very large quantity of clay fragments, mixed with burnt bones and very few traces of bronze objects\" was found.  New essays conducted by Pietro Barocelli and Decio in 1922-1923 north of the road in Mesma allowed the identification of other burials (E 48-63), with abundant ceramic equipment and with some stone superstructures.  The area seemed disturbed by Roman interventions (tiles and bricks interspersed with heaps of stones were found), while the necropolis seemed to run out on the edge of an ancient peat bog.  The tombs are framed mainly in the Golasecca IC phase (690 - 600 BC)\n\n==== Ameno F ====\nThe first excavations in the area of the burial ground F, a short distance from Ameno E, were carried out at the beginning of 1928. In that year, in need of building stones, the Decio had excavations carried out in a field at the foot of Mesma, where the remains of a stone wall emerged, finding some tombs from the early Iron and Rooster Roman age.  The excavations continued on several occasions until 1936 bringing to light numerous burials (F 64-138).  The necropolis \"F\" of Ameno, the oldest among those identified in Ameno, is one of the most important for the study of the beginnings of the Iron Age in the context of the Culture of Golasecca.  Characteristics of this necropolis are the biconical or biconical ovoid cinerary urns with decoration made of a false string and pairs of small handles on the maximum expansion and the ovoid urns with decoration in metopal squares with geometric or figured motifs.  The latter, rare in the Golasecchian culture which prefers geometric decoration, are stylized quadrupedal figures, generally interpreted as equine.  The \"ponies\" of Ameno, chronologically limited to the ninth century BC, are perhaps to be related to the coeval spread of horse riding in northern Italy and the consequent decline of the oldest tradition of chariot fighting.  It does not seem accidental that this figurative motif is widespread mainly in the area between Ameno and Castelletto Ticino , a territory which still today offers ideal characteristics for the breeding of horses.  The necropolis F was used for several centuries.  Although the most frequented phase is Golasecca I A1 (c. 935 - 800 BC), there are in fact more recent isolated tombs up to G. II B (525-480 BC) and the Roman rooster era.\n\n==== Ameno G ====\nA new necropolis was discovered accidentally, again by Walter Baronchelli, in 1976.  During excavation works, around hundred meters south of the burial ground F, numerous fragments of clay belonging to Iron Age tombs were unearthed. Two intact burials with relatively well-preserved ceramic could be recovered. Olles, vases and bowls high foot datable to Golasecca II.  No further excavations were carried out in the area.  The finds were delivered to the municipality and then deposited by the Archaeological Superintendence in the Museum of Antiquities of Turin.\n\n=== Mount Mesma ===\n[[File:Ameno ConventoMonteMesma.jpg|thumb|Photo of Franciscan convent on Monte Mesma]]\nThe Franciscan convent on Monte Mesma\n\nParallel to the research in the necropolis areas, Giulio Decio also conducted excavation tests on the slopes of Mount Mesma, under the Franciscan monastery where brick fragments from the Roman era had been found.  The research led to the identification, in various points, of fragments of protohistoric domestic pottery in a secondary position, bronze fibulae and remains of clay fictile from the Roman period.  These discoveries led the Decio to hypothesize the presence of a built-up area on the well-stocked summit of Mount Mesma , from which the surrounding area is easily dominated.  An indirect confirmation of the strategic value of the place, centuries later, is given by the construction in the Middle Ages of a castle, probably in 1200 , by the Municipality of Novara .  The present Franciscan monastery was later built on the ruins of this.  The necropolises discovered in Lortallo were located along the main access road to the town, according to a use widely attested in the early Iron Age .
