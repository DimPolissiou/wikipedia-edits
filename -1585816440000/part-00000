Helium is composed of [[Two-electron atom|two electrons]] bound by the [[electromagnetic force]] to a nucleus containing two protons along with either one or two neutrons, depending on the [[Isotopes of helium|isotope]], held together by the [[strong force]]. Unlike for [[hydrogen]], a closed-form solution to the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] for the helium atom has not been found. However, various approximations, such as the [[Hartree\u2013Fock method]], can be used to estimate the [[ground state]] energy and [[wavefunction]] of the atom.\n\n==Introduction==\n[[Image:Helium-term-scheme.svg |thumb|400px|right| Schematic termscheme for Para- and Orthohelium with one electron in ground state 1s and one excited electron.]]\nThe quantum mechanical description of the helium atom is of special interest, because it is the simplest multi-electron system and can be used to understand the concept of [[quantum entanglement]]. The [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of helium, considered as a three-body system of two electrons and a nucleus and after separating out the centre-of-mass motion, can be written as\n\n:<math> H(\\vec{r}_1,\\, \\vec{r}_2) = \\sum_{i=1,2}\\Bigg(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\mu} \\nabla^2_{r_i} -\\frac{Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r_i}\\Bigg) - \\frac{\\hbar^2}{M} \\nabla_{r_1} \\cdot \\nabla_{r_2} + \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r_{12}} </math>\n\nwhere <math> \\mu = \\frac{mM}{m+M}</math> is the reduced mass of an electron with respect to the nucleus, <math> \\vec{r}_1 </math> and <math> \\vec{r}_2 </math> are the electron-nucleus distance vectors and <math> r_{12} = |\\vec{r_1} - \\vec{r_2}| </math>. The nuclear charge, <math> Z </math> is 2 for helium. In the approximation of an infinitely heavy nucleus, <math> M = \\infty </math> we have <math> \\mu = m </math> and the mass polarization term <math display=\"inline\"> \\frac{\\hbar^2}{M} \\nabla_{r_1} \\cdot \\nabla_{r_2} </math> disappears. In [[atomic units]] the Hamiltonian simplifies to\n\n:<math> H(\\vec{r}_1,\\, \\vec{r}_2) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2_{r_1} - \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2_{r_2} - \\frac{Z}{r_1} - \\frac{Z}{r_2} + \\frac{1}{r_{12}}. </math>\n\nIt is important to note, that it operates not in normal space, but in a 6-dimensional ''configuration space <math>(\\vec{r}_1,\\, \\vec{r}_2)</math>''. In this approximation ([[Pauli equation|Pauli approximation]]) the wave function is a second order [[spinor]] with 4 components <math> \\psi_{ij}(\\vec{r}_1,\\, \\vec{r}_2)</math>, where the indices <math> i,j = \\,\\uparrow,\\downarrow </math> describe the spin projection of both electrons (''z''-direction up or down) in some coordinate system.<ref>P. Rennert, H. Schmiedel, C. Wei\u00dfmantel. \"Kleine Enzyklop\u00e4die Physik\", VEB Bibliographisches Institut Leipzig, 1988, 192-194.</ref> It has to obey the usual normalization condition <math> \\sum_{ij}\\int d\\vec{r}_1 d\\vec{r}_2|\\psi_{ij}|^2 = 1</math>. This general spinor can be written as 2x2 matrix <math> \\boldsymbol \\psi = \\begin{pmatrix}\\psi_{\\uparrow\\uparrow} & \\psi_{\\uparrow\\downarrow} \\\\ \\psi_{\\downarrow\\uparrow} & \\psi_{\\downarrow\\downarrow} \\end{pmatrix}</math> and consequently also as linear combination of any given basis of four orthogonal (in the vector-space of 2x2 matrices) constant matrices <math> \\boldsymbol \\sigma^i_k </math> with scalar function coefficients\n<math> \\phi^k_i (\\vec{r}_1,\\, \\vec{r}_2) </math> as <math> \\boldsymbol \\psi = \\sum_{ik}\\phi^k_i (\\vec{r}_1,\\, \\vec{r}_2) \\boldsymbol \\sigma^i_k </math>. A convenient basis consists of one anti-symmetric matrix (with total spin <math> S = 0</math>, corresponding to a '''singlet state''')<blockquote><math> \\boldsymbol \\sigma^0_0 = \\frac 1{\\sqrt 2} \\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} =  \\frac 1{\\sqrt 2}(\\uparrow\\downarrow - \\downarrow\\uparrow) </math> </blockquote>and three symmetric matrices (with total spin <math> S = 1</math>, corresponding to a '''triplet state''') <blockquote><math> \\boldsymbol \\sigma^1_0 = \\frac 1{\\sqrt 2} \\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} =   \\frac 1{\\sqrt 2}(\\uparrow\\downarrow + \\downarrow\\uparrow)\\; ;</math> <math> \\boldsymbol \\sigma^1_1 = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\;\\uparrow\\uparrow\\; ;</math> <math> \\boldsymbol \\sigma^1_{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix}0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\;\\downarrow\\downarrow \\; .</math></blockquote>It is easy to show, that the singlet state is invariant under all rotations (a scalar entity), while the triplet can be mapped to an ordinary space vector <math>(\\sigma_x,\\sigma_y,\\sigma_z) </math>,\nwith the three components<blockquote><math> \\sigma_x = \\frac 1{\\sqrt 2} \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} </math>, <math> \\sigma_y = \\frac i{\\sqrt 2} \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}</math> and <math> \\sigma_z = \\frac 1{\\sqrt 2} \\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} </math>.</blockquote>Since all spin interaction terms between the four components of <math> \\boldsymbol \\psi </math> in the above (scalar) Hamiltonian are neglected (e.g. an external magnetic field, or [[Relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]], like [[angular momentum coupling]]), the four [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]]s can be solved independently.<ref>\nL.D. Landau, E.M. Lifschitz. \"Lehrbuch der Theoretischen Physik\", Bd. III (Quantenmechanik), Akademie-Verlag, Berlin 1971, Kap. IX, pp. 218</ref>\n\nThe spin here only comes into play through the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which for fermions (like electrons) requires antisymmetry under ''simultaneous exchange of spin and coordinates''\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol \\psi_{ij} (\\vec{r}_1,\\, \\vec{r}_2) = - \\boldsymbol \\psi_{ji} (\\vec{r}_2,\\, \\vec{r}_1)</math>.\n\n'''Parahelium''' is then the singlet state <math> \\boldsymbol \\psi = \\phi_0 (\\vec{r}_1,\\, \\vec{r}_2) \\boldsymbol \\sigma^0_0</math> with a ''symmetric ''function <math>\\phi_0 (\\vec{r}_1,\\, \\vec{r}_2) = \\phi_0 (\\vec{r}_2,\\, \\vec{r}_1)</math> \nand '''orthohelium''' is the triplet state <math> \\boldsymbol \\psi_m = \\phi_1 (\\vec{r}_1,\\, \\vec{r}_2)\\boldsymbol \\sigma^1_m,\\; m =-1,0,1 </math> with an ''antisymmetric ''function <math>\\phi_1(\\vec{r}_1,\\, \\vec{r}_2) = -\\phi_1 (\\vec{r}_2,\\, \\vec{r}_1)</math>. \nIf the electron-electron interaction term is ignored, both spatial functions <math>\\phi_x,\\; x = 0,1 </math> can be written as linear combination of two arbitrary (orthogonal and normalized) \none-electron eigenfunctions <math> \\varphi_a, \\varphi_b</math>: <blockquote><math>\\phi_x =  \\frac 1 {\\sqrt 2}(\\varphi_a(\\vec{r}_1) \\varphi_b(\\vec{r}_2) \\pm \\varphi_a(\\vec{r}_2) \\varphi_b(\\vec{r}_1)) </math> </blockquote>or for the special cases\nof <math> \\varphi_a = \\varphi_b</math> (both electrons have identical quantum numbers, parahelium only): <math>\\phi_0 =  \\varphi_a(\\vec{r}_1) \\varphi_a(\\vec{r}_2) </math>.\nThe total energy (as eigenvalue of <math> H </math>) is then for all cases <math> E = E_a + E_b </math> (independent of the symmetry).\n\nThis explains the absence of the <math>1^3 S_1</math> state (with <math> \\varphi_a = \\varphi_b = \\varphi_{1s} </math>) for orthohelium, where \nconsequently <math>2^3S_1</math> (with <math> \\varphi_a =  \\varphi_{1s}, \\varphi_b = \\varphi_{2s} </math>) is the metastable ground state.\n(A state with the quantum numbers: principal quantum number <math>n</math>, total spin <math>S</math>, angular quantum number <math>L</math> and total angular momentum \n<math>J = |L-S| \\dots L+S</math> is denoted by <math>n^{2S+1}L_J</math>.)\n\nIf the electron-electron interaction term <math> \\frac 1{r_{12}} </math> is included, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is non separable. \nHowever, also if is neglected, all states described above (even with two identical quantum numbers, like <math> 1^1S_0</math> with <math>\\boldsymbol\\psi= \\varphi_{1s}(\\vec{r}_1)\\varphi_{1s}(\\vec{r}_2) \\boldsymbol \\sigma^0_0 </math>)\ncannot be written as a product of one-electron wave functions:\n<math> \\psi_{ik}(\\vec{r}_1,\\, \\vec{r}_2) \\neq \\chi_i (\\vec{r}_1)\\xi_k(\\vec{r}_2) </math> \u2014 the wave function is [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]].\nOne cannot say, particle 1 is in '''state 1''' and the other in '''state 2''', and measurements cannot be made on one particle without affecting the other.\n\nNevertheless, quite good theoretical descriptions of helium can be obtained within the Hartree\u2013Fock and Thomas\u2013Fermi approximations (see below).\n\n==Hartree\u2013Fock method==\nThe Hartree\u2013Fock method is used for a variety of atomic systems. However it is just an approximation, and there are more accurate and efficient methods used today to solve atomic systems. The \"[[many-body problem]]\" for helium and other few electron systems can be solved quite accurately. For example, the [[ground state]] of helium is known to fifteen digits. In Hartree\u2013Fock theory, the electrons are assumed to move in a potential created by the nucleus and the other electrons. The [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] for helium with two electrons can be written as a sum of the Hamiltonians for each electron:\n\n<math> H = \\sum_{i=1}^2 h(i) = H_0 + H^{\\prime}</math>\n\nwhere the zero-order unperturbed Hamiltonian is\n\n<math> H_0 = -\\frac{1}{2} \\nabla_{r_1}^2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\nabla_{r_2}^2 - \\frac{Z}{r_1} - \\frac{Z}{r_2} </math>\n\nwhile the perturbation term:\n\n<math> H' = \\frac{1}{r_{12}} </math>\n\nis the electron-electron interaction. H<sub>0</sub> is just the sum of the two hydrogenic Hamiltonians:\n\n<math> H_0 = \\hat{h}_1 + \\hat{h}_2 </math>\n\nwhere\n\n<math> \\hat{h}_i = -\\frac{1}{2} \\nabla_{r_i}^2 - \\frac{Z}{r_i}, i=1,2 </math>\n\nE<sub>n<sub>i</sub></sub>, the energy eigenvalues and <math>\\psi_{n_i,l_i,m_i}(\\vec{r}_i) </math>, the corresponding eigenfunctions of the hydrogenic Hamiltonian will denote the normalized energy [[eigenvalue]]s and the normalized eigenfunctions. So:\n\n<math> \\hat{h}_i \\psi_{n_i,l_i,m_i}(\\vec{r_i}) = E_{n_i} \\psi_{n_i,l_i,m_i}(\\vec{r_i}) </math>\n\nwhere\n\n<math> E_{n_i} = - \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{Z^2}{n_i^2}   \\text{ in a.u.} </math>\n\nNeglecting the electron-electron repulsion term, the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] for the spatial part of the two-electron wave function will reduce to the 'zero-order' equation\n\n<math> H_0\\psi^{(0)}(\\vec{r}_1, \\vec{r}_2) = E^{(0)} \\psi^{(0)}(\\vec{r}_1, \\vec{r}_2) </math>\n\nThis equation is separable and the eigenfunctions can be written in the form of single products of hydrogenic wave functions:\n\n<math> \\psi^{(0)}(\\vec{r}_1, \\vec{r}_2) = \\psi_{n_1,l_1,m_1}(\\vec{r}_1) \\psi_{n_2,l_2,m_2}(\\vec{r}_2)  </math>\n\nThe corresponding energies are (in [[atomic units]], hereafter a.u.):\n\n<math> E^{(0)}_{n_1,n_2} = E_{n_1} + E_{n_2} = - \\frac{Z^2}{2} \\Bigg[\\frac{1}{n_1^2} + \\frac{1}{n_2^2} \\Bigg] </math>\n\nNote that the wave function\n\n<math> \\psi^{(0)}(\\vec{r}_2, \\vec{r}_1) = \\psi_{n_2,l_2,m_2}(\\vec{r}_1) \\psi_{n_1,l_1,m_1}(\\vec{r}_2) </math>\n\nAn exchange of electron labels corresponds to the same energy <math> E^{(0)}_{n_1,n_2} </math>. This particular case of [[Degeneracy (quantum mechanics)|degeneracy]] with respect to exchange of electron labels is called [[exchange degeneracy]]. The exact spatial wave functions of two-electron atoms must either be symmetric or [[Even and odd functions|antisymmetric]] with respect to the interchange of the coordinates <math> \\vec{r}_1 </math> and <math> \\vec{r}_2 </math> of the two electrons. The proper wave function then must be composed of the symmetric (+) and antisymmetric(-) linear combinations:\n\n<math> \\psi^{(0)}_\\pm(\\vec{r}_1, \\vec{r}_2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} [\\psi_{n_1,l_1,m_1}(\\vec{r}_1) \\psi_{n_2,l_2,m_2}(\\vec{r}_2) \\pm \\psi_{n_2,l_2,m_2}(\\vec{r}_1) \\psi_{n_1,l_1,m_1}(\\vec{r}_2)] </math>\n\nThis comes from [[Slater determinants]].\n\nThe factor <math> \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} </math> normalizes <math> \\psi^{(0)}_\\pm </math>. In order to get this wave function into a single product of one-particle wave functions, we use the fact that this is in the ground state. So <math> n_1=n_2=1,\\, l_1=l_2=0,\\, m_1=m_2=0 </math>. So the <math> \\psi^{(0)}_{-}</math> will vanish, in agreement with the original formulation of the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], in which two electrons cannot be in the same state. Therefore, the wave function for helium can be written as\n\n<math> \\psi^{(0)}_0(\\vec{r}_1, \\vec{r}_2) = \\psi_1(\\vec{r_1}) \\psi_1(\\vec{r_2}) = \\frac{Z^3}{\\pi} e^{-Z(r_1 + r_2)} </math>\n\nWhere <math> \\psi_1 </math> and <math> \\psi_2 </math> use the wave functions for the hydrogen Hamiltonian. {{efn|1=For n = 1, l = 0 and m = 0, the [[Particle in a spherically symmetric potential|wavefunction in a spherically symmetric potential]] for a hydrogen electron is <math>\\psi_(r) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\left(\\frac{Z}{a_0}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\ e^{-{\\textstyle \\frac{Zr}{a_0}}}\\; </math>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/hydwf.html|title=Hydrogen Wavefunctions|website = Hyperphysics|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201162948/http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/hydwf.html|archivedate=1 February 2014}}</ref> In [[atomic units]], the [[Bohr radius]] <math>{a_0}</math> equals 1, and the wavefunction becomes <math>\\psi_(r) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} Z^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\ e^{-{\\textstyle Zr}}\\; </math>.}} For helium, Z = 2 from\n\n<math> E^{(0)}_0 = E^{(0)}_{n_1=1,\\, n_2=1} = -Z^2 \\text{ a.u.} </math>\n\nwhere E<math>^{(0)}_0</math> = &minus;4 a.u. which is approximately &minus;108.8 eV, which corresponds to an ionization potential V<math>_P^{(0)}</math> = 2 a.u.

(&cong; 24.6 eV).\n\nThe energy that we obtained is too low because the repulsion term between the electrons was ignored, whose effect is to raise the energy levels. As Z gets bigger, our approach should yield better results, since the electron-electron repulsion term will get smaller.\n\nSo far a very crude independent-particle approximation has been used, in which the electron-electron repulsion term is completely omitted. Splitting the Hamiltonian showed below will improve the results:\n\n<math> H = \\bar{H_0} + \\bar{H'} </math>\n\nwhere\n\n<math> \\bar{H_0} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\nabla^2_{r_1} + V(r_1) - \\frac{1}{2} \\nabla^2_{r_2} + V(r_2) </math>\n\nand\n\n<math> \\bar{H'} = \\frac{1}{r_{12}} - \\frac{Z}{r_1} -V(r_1) - \\frac{Z}{r_2} - V(r_2) </math>\n\nV(r) is a central potential which is chosen so that the effect of the perturbation <math> \\bar{H'} </math> is small. The net effect of each electron on the motion of the other one is to screen somewhat the charge of the nucleus, so a simple guess for V(r) is\n\n<math> V(r) = -\\frac{Z-S}{r} = - \\frac{Z_e}{r} </math>\n\nwhere S is a screening constant and the quantity Z<sub>e</sub> is the effective charge. The potential is a Coulomb interaction, so the corresponding individual electron energies are given (in a.u.) by\n\n<math> E_0 = -(Z-S)^2 = - Z_e^2 </math>\n\nand the corresponding wave function is given by\n\n<math> \\psi_0(r_1\\,  r_2) = \\frac{Z_e^3}{\\pi} e^{-Z_e(r_1 + r_2)} </math>\n\nIf Z<sub>e</sub> was 1.70, that would make the expression above for the ground state energy agree with the experimental value E<sub>0</sub> = &minus;2.903 a.u. of the ground state energy of helium. Since Z = 2 in this case, the screening constant is S = 0.30. For the ground state of helium, for the average shielding approximation, the screening effect of each electron on the other one is equivalent to about <math> \\frac{1}{3} </math> of the electronic charge.<ref>B.H. Bransden and C.J. Joachain's ''Physics of Atoms and Molecules'' 2nd edition Pearson Education, Inc</ref>\n\n==Thomas\u2013Fermi method==\n{{expert needed|Physics|section|date=July 2009}}\nNot long after Schr\u00f6dinger developed the wave equation, the [[Thomas\u2013Fermi model]] was developed. Density functional theory is used to describe the particle density <math>\\rho(\\vec{r}),\\, r\\, \\epsilon\\, \\reals^3</math>, and the ground state energy E(N), where N is the number of electrons in the atom. If there are a large number of electrons, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation runs into problems, because it gets very difficult to solve, even in the atom's ground states. This is where density functional theory comes in. Thomas\u2013Fermi theory gives very good intuition of what is happening in the ground states of atoms and molecules with N electrons.\n\nThe energy functional for an atom with N electrons is given by:\n\n<math>\\xi = \\frac{3}{5}   \\gamma \\int_{\\reals^3} \\rho^{5/3}(\\vec{r}) d^3\\vec{r}\\, + \\int_{\\reals^3} V(\\vec{r}) \\rho(\\vec{r}) d^3\\vec{r}\\, + \\frac{e^2}{2} \\int_{\\reals^3} \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r})\\rho(\\vec{r'})}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|}\\, d^3\\vec{r}d^3\\vec{r'} </math>\n\nWhere\n\n<math>\\gamma = (3\\pi^2)^{2/3} \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} </math>\n\nThe electron density needs to be greater than or equal to 0, <math>\\int_{\\reals^3} \\rho = N</math>, and <math>\\rho \\rightarrow \\xi </math> is convex.\n\nIn the energy functional, each term holds a certain meaning. The first term describes the minimum quantum-mechanical kinetic energy required to create the electron density <math>\\rho(\\vec{x})</math> for an N number of electrons. The next term is the attractive interaction of the electrons with the nuclei through the Coulomb potential <math> V(\\vec{r}) </math>. The final term is the electron-electron repulsion potential energy.<ref>http://www.physics.nyu.edu/LarrySpruch/Lieb.pdf</ref>\n\nSo the Hamiltonian for a system of many electrons can be written:\n\n<math>H = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\Bigg[-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla_i^2 + V(\\vec{r_i})\\Bigg] + \\int \\frac{e^2\\rho(\\vec{r'})}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'</math>\n\nFor helium, N = 2, so the Hamiltonian is given by:\n\n<math> H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} (\\nabla_1^2 + \\nabla_2^2) + V(\\vec{r_1}, \\, \\vec{r_2}) + \\int \\frac{e^2 \\rho(\\vec{r'})} {|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'  </math>\n\nWhere\n\n<math> \\int \\frac{e^2 \\rho(\\vec{r'})} {|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r' = \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r}_1 - \\vec{r}_2|},\\, \\text{ and }\\,  V(\\vec{r_1}, \\, \\vec{r_2}) = \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\Bigg[\\frac{2}{r_1} + \\frac{2}{r_2} \\Bigg] </math>\n\nyielding\n\n<math> H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} (\\nabla_1^2 + \\nabla_2^2) + \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\Bigg[\\frac{2}{r_1} + \\frac{2}{r_2} - \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r}_1 - \\vec{r}_2|}\\Bigg] </math>\n\nFrom the Hartree\u2013Fock method, it is known that ignoring the electron-electron repulsion term, the energy is 8E<sub>1</sub> = &minus;109 eV.\n\n==The variational method==\nTo obtain a more accurate energy the [[variational principle]] can be applied to the electron-electron potential V<sub>ee </sub>using the wave function\n\n<math> \\psi_0(\\vec{r}_1,\\, \\vec{r}_2) = \\frac{8}{\\pi a^3} e^{-2(r_1+r_2)/a} </math>:\n\n<math> \\langle H \\rangle = 8E_1 + \\langle V_{ee} \\rangle = 8E_1 + \\Bigg(\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\Bigg) \\Bigg(\\frac{8}{\\pi a^3}\\Bigg)^2 \\int \\frac{e^{-4(r_1 + r_2)/a}} {|\\vec{r}_1 - \\vec{r}_2|}\\, d^3\\vec{r}_1 \\, d^3\\vec{r}_2 </math>\n\nAfter integrating this, the result is:\n\n<math> \\langle H \\rangle = 8E_1 + \\frac{5}{4a} \\Bigg(\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\Bigg) = 8E_1 - \\frac{5}{2}E_1 = -109 + 34 = -75 \\text{ eV} </math>\n\nThis is closer to the experimental value, but if a better trial wave function is used, an even more accurate answer could be obtained. An ideal wave function would be one that doesn't ignore the influence of the other electron. In other words, each electron represents a cloud of negative charge which somewhat shields the nucleus so that the other electron actually sees an effective nuclear charge Z that is less than 2. A wave function of this type is given by:\n\n<math> \\psi(\\vec{r}_1, \\vec{r}_2) = \\frac{Z^3}{\\pi a^3} e^{-Z(r_1+r_2)/a} </math>\n\nTreating Z as a variational parameter to minimize H. The Hamiltonian using the wave function above is given by:\n\n<math> \\langle H \\rangle = 2Z^2E_1 + 2(Z-2) \\Bigg(\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\Bigg) \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{r} \\right\\rangle + \\left\\langle V_{ee} \\right\\rangle </math>\n\nAfter calculating the expectation value of <math> \\frac{1}{r} </math> and V<sub>ee</sub> the expectation value of the Hamiltonian becomes:\n\n<math> \\langle H \\rangle = \\left[-2Z^2 + \\frac{27}{4}Z\\right]E_1 </math>\n\nThe minimum value of Z needs to be calculated, so taking a derivative with respect to Z and setting the equation to 0 will give the minimum value of Z:\n\n<math> \\frac{d}{dZ} \\left(\\left[-2Z^2 + \\frac{27}{4}Z\\right] E_1\\right) = 0 </math>\n\n<math> Z = \\frac{27}{16} \\sim 1.69 </math>\n\nThis shows that the other electron somewhat shields the nucleus reducing the effective charge from 2 to 1.69.

Helium is composed of [[Two-electron atom|two electrons]] bound by the [[electromagnetic force]] to a nucleus containing two protons along with either one or two neutrons, depending on the [[Isotopes of helium|isotope]], held together by the [[strong force]]. Unlike for [[hydrogen]], a closed-form solution to the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] for the helium atom has not been found. However, various approximations, such as the [[Hartree\u2013Fock method]], can be used to estimate the [[ground state]] energy and [[wavefunction]] of the atom.\n\n==Introduction==\n[[Image:Helium-term-scheme.svg |thumb|400px|right| Schematic termscheme for Para- and Orthohelium with one electron in ground state 1s and one excited electron.]]\nThe quantum mechanical description of the helium atom is of special interest, because it is the simplest multi-electron system and can be used to understand the concept of [[quantum entanglement]]. The [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of helium, considered as a three-body system of two electrons and a nucleus and after separating out the centre-of-mass motion, can be written as\n\n:<math> H(\\vec{r}_1,\\, \\vec{r}_2) = \\sum_{i=1,2}\\Bigg(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2\\mu} \\nabla^2_{r_i} -\\frac{Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r_i}\\Bigg) - \\frac{\\hbar^2}{M} \\nabla_{r_1} \\cdot \\nabla_{r_2} + \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r_{12}} </math>\n\nwhere <math> \\mu = \\frac{mM}{m+M}</math> is the reduced mass of an electron with respect to the nucleus, <math> \\vec{r}_1 </math> and <math> \\vec{r}_2 </math> are the electron-nucleus distance vectors and <math> r_{12} = |\\vec{r_1} - \\vec{r_2}| </math>. The nuclear charge, <math> Z </math> is 2 for helium. In the approximation of an infinitely heavy nucleus, <math> M = \\infty </math> we have <math> \\mu = m </math> and the mass polarization term <math display=\"inline\"> \\frac{\\hbar^2}{M} \\nabla_{r_1} \\cdot \\nabla_{r_2} </math> disappears. In [[atomic units]] the Hamiltonian simplifies to\n\n:<math> H(\\vec{r}_1,\\, \\vec{r}_2) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2_{r_1} - \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2_{r_2} - \\frac{Z}{r_1} - \\frac{Z}{r_2} + \\frac{1}{r_{12}}. </math>\n\nIt is important to note, that it operates not in normal space, but in a 6-dimensional ''configuration space <math>(\\vec{r}_1,\\, \\vec{r}_2)</math>''. In this approximation ([[Pauli equation|Pauli approximation]]) the wave function is a second order [[spinor]] with 4 components <math> \\psi_{ij}(\\vec{r}_1,\\, \\vec{r}_2)</math>, where the indices <math> i,j = \\,\\uparrow,\\downarrow </math> describe the spin projection of both electrons (''z''-direction up or down) in some coordinate system.<ref>P. Rennert, H. Schmiedel, C. Wei\u00dfmantel. \"Kleine Enzyklop\u00e4die Physik\", VEB Bibliographisches Institut Leipzig, 1988, 192-194.</ref> It has to obey the usual normalization condition <math> \\sum_{ij}\\int d\\vec{r}_1 d\\vec{r}_2|\\psi_{ij}|^2 = 1</math>. This general spinor can be written as 2x2 matrix <math> \\boldsymbol \\psi = \\begin{pmatrix}\\psi_{\\uparrow\\uparrow} & \\psi_{\\uparrow\\downarrow} \\\\ \\psi_{\\downarrow\\uparrow} & \\psi_{\\downarrow\\downarrow} \\end{pmatrix}</math> and consequently also as linear combination of any given basis of four orthogonal (in the vector-space of 2x2 matrices) constant matrices <math> \\boldsymbol \\sigma^i_k </math> with scalar function coefficients\n<math> \\phi^k_i (\\vec{r}_1,\\, \\vec{r}_2) </math> as <math> \\boldsymbol \\psi = \\sum_{ik}\\phi^k_i (\\vec{r}_1,\\, \\vec{r}_2) \\boldsymbol \\sigma^i_k </math>. A convenient basis consists of one anti-symmetric matrix (with total spin <math> S = 0</math>, corresponding to a '''singlet state''')<blockquote><math> \\boldsymbol \\sigma^0_0 = \\frac 1{\\sqrt 2} \\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} =  \\frac 1{\\sqrt 2}(\\uparrow\\downarrow - \\downarrow\\uparrow) </math> </blockquote>and three symmetric matrices (with total spin <math> S = 1</math>, corresponding to a '''triplet state''') <blockquote><math> \\boldsymbol \\sigma^1_0 = \\frac 1{\\sqrt 2} \\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} =   \\frac 1{\\sqrt 2}(\\uparrow\\downarrow + \\downarrow\\uparrow)\\; ;</math> <math> \\boldsymbol \\sigma^1_1 = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\;\\uparrow\\uparrow\\; ;</math> <math> \\boldsymbol \\sigma^1_{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix}0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\;\\downarrow\\downarrow \\; .</math></blockquote>It is easy to show, that the singlet state is invariant under all rotations (a scalar entity), while the triplet can be mapped to an ordinary space vector <math>(\\sigma_x,\\sigma_y,\\sigma_z) </math>,\nwith the three components<blockquote><math> \\sigma_x = \\frac 1{\\sqrt 2} \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} </math>, <math> \\sigma_y = \\frac i{\\sqrt 2} \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}</math> and <math> \\sigma_z = \\frac 1{\\sqrt 2} \\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} </math>.</blockquote>Since all spin interaction terms between the four components of <math> \\boldsymbol \\psi </math> in the above (scalar) Hamiltonian are neglected (e.g. an external magnetic field, or [[Relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]], like [[angular momentum coupling]]), the four [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]]s can be solved independently.<ref>\nL.D. Landau, E.M. Lifschitz. \"Lehrbuch der Theoretischen Physik\", Bd. III (Quantenmechanik), Akademie-Verlag, Berlin 1971, Kap. IX, pp. 218</ref>\n\nThe spin here only comes into play through the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which for fermions (like electrons) requires antisymmetry under ''simultaneous exchange of spin and coordinates''\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol \\psi_{ij} (\\vec{r}_1,\\, \\vec{r}_2) = - \\boldsymbol \\psi_{ji} (\\vec{r}_2,\\, \\vec{r}_1)</math>.\n\n'''Parahelium''' is then the singlet state <math> \\boldsymbol \\psi = \\phi_0 (\\vec{r}_1,\\, \\vec{r}_2) \\boldsymbol \\sigma^0_0</math> with a ''symmetric ''function <math>\\phi_0 (\\vec{r}_1,\\, \\vec{r}_2) = \\phi_0 (\\vec{r}_2,\\, \\vec{r}_1)</math> \nand '''orthohelium''' is the triplet state <math> \\boldsymbol \\psi_m = \\phi_1 (\\vec{r}_1,\\, \\vec{r}_2)\\boldsymbol \\sigma^1_m,\\; m =-1,0,1 </math> with an ''antisymmetric ''function <math>\\phi_1(\\vec{r}_1,\\, \\vec{r}_2) = -\\phi_1 (\\vec{r}_2,\\, \\vec{r}_1)</math>. \nIf the electron-electron interaction term is ignored, both spatial functions <math>\\phi_x,\\; x = 0,1 </math> can be written as linear combination of two arbitrary (orthogonal and normalized) \none-electron eigenfunctions <math> \\varphi_a, \\varphi_b</math>: <blockquote><math>\\phi_x =  \\frac 1 {\\sqrt 2}(\\varphi_a(\\vec{r}_1) \\varphi_b(\\vec{r}_2) \\pm \\varphi_a(\\vec{r}_2) \\varphi_b(\\vec{r}_1)) </math> </blockquote>or for the special cases\nof <math> \\varphi_a = \\varphi_b</math> (both electrons have identical quantum numbers, parahelium only): <math>\\phi_0 =  \\varphi_a(\\vec{r}_1) \\varphi_a(\\vec{r}_2) </math>.\nThe total energy (as eigenvalue of <math> H </math>) is then for all cases <math> E = E_a + E_b </math> (independent of the symmetry).\n\nThis explains the absence of the <math>1^3 S_1</math> state (with <math> \\varphi_a = \\varphi_b = \\varphi_{1s} </math>) for orthohelium, where \nconsequently <math>2^3S_1</math> (with <math> \\varphi_a =  \\varphi_{1s}, \\varphi_b = \\varphi_{2s} </math>) is the metastable ground state.\n(A state with the quantum numbers: principal quantum number <math>n</math>, total spin <math>S</math>, angular quantum number <math>L</math> and total angular momentum \n<math>J = |L-S| \\dots L+S</math> is denoted by <math>n^{2S+1}L_J</math>.)\n\nIf the electron-electron interaction term <math> \\frac 1{r_{12}} </math> is included, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is non separable. \nHowever, also if is neglected, all states described above (even with two identical quantum numbers, like <math> 1^1S_0</math> with <math>\\boldsymbol\\psi= \\varphi_{1s}(\\vec{r}_1)\\varphi_{1s}(\\vec{r}_2) \\boldsymbol \\sigma^0_0 </math>)\ncannot be written as a product of one-electron wave functions:\n<math> \\psi_{ik}(\\vec{r}_1,\\, \\vec{r}_2) \\neq \\chi_i (\\vec{r}_1)\\xi_k(\\vec{r}_2) </math> \u2014 the wave function is [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]].\nOne cannot say, particle 1 is in '''state 1''' and the other in '''state 2''', and measurements cannot be made on one particle without affecting the other.\n\nNevertheless, quite good theoretical descriptions of helium can be obtained within the Hartree\u2013Fock and Thomas\u2013Fermi approximations (see below).\n\n==Hartree\u2013Fock method==\nThe Hartree\u2013Fock method is used for a variety of atomic systems. However it is just an approximation, and there are more accurate and efficient methods used today to solve atomic systems. The \"[[many-body problem]]\" for helium and other few electron systems can be solved quite accurately. For example, the [[ground state]] of helium is known to fifteen digits. In Hartree\u2013Fock theory, the electrons are assumed to move in a potential created by the nucleus and the other electrons. The [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] for helium with two electrons can be written as a sum of the Hamiltonians for each electron:\n\n<math> H = \\sum_{i=1}^2 h(i) = H_0 + H^{\\prime}</math>\n\nwhere the zero-order unperturbed Hamiltonian is\n\n<math> H_0 = -\\frac{1}{2} \\nabla_{r_1}^2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\nabla_{r_2}^2 - \\frac{Z}{r_1} - \\frac{Z}{r_2} </math>\n\nwhile the perturbation term:\n\n<math> H' = \\frac{1}{r_{12}} </math>\n\nis the electron-electron interaction. H<sub>0</sub> is just the sum of the two hydrogenic Hamiltonians:\n\n<math> H_0 = \\hat{h}_1 + \\hat{h}_2 </math>\n\nwhere\n\n<math> \\hat{h}_i = -\\frac{1}{2} \\nabla_{r_i}^2 - \\frac{Z}{r_i}, i=1,2 </math>\n\nE<sub>n<sub>i</sub></sub>, the energy eigenvalues and <math>\\psi_{n_i,l_i,m_i}(\\vec{r}_i) </math>, the corresponding eigenfunctions of the hydrogenic Hamiltonian will denote the normalized energy [[eigenvalue]]s and the normalized eigenfunctions. So:\n\n<math> \\hat{h}_i \\psi_{n_i,l_i,m_i}(\\vec{r_i}) = E_{n_i} \\psi_{n_i,l_i,m_i}(\\vec{r_i}) </math>\n\nwhere\n\n<math> E_{n_i} = - \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{Z^2}{n_i^2}   \\text{ in a.u.} </math>\n\nNeglecting the electron-electron repulsion term, the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] for the spatial part of the two-electron wave function will reduce to the 'zero-order' equation\n\n<math> H_0\\psi^{(0)}(\\vec{r}_1, \\vec{r}_2) = E^{(0)} \\psi^{(0)}(\\vec{r}_1, \\vec{r}_2) </math>\n\nThis equation is separable and the eigenfunctions can be written in the form of single products of hydrogenic wave functions:\n\n<math> \\psi^{(0)}(\\vec{r}_1, \\vec{r}_2) = \\psi_{n_1,l_1,m_1}(\\vec{r}_1) \\psi_{n_2,l_2,m_2}(\\vec{r}_2)  </math>\n\nThe corresponding energies are (in [[atomic units]], hereafter a.u.):\n\n<math> E^{(0)}_{n_1,n_2} = E_{n_1} + E_{n_2} = - \\frac{Z^2}{2} \\Bigg[\\frac{1}{n_1^2} + \\frac{1}{n_2^2} \\Bigg] </math>\n\nNote that the wave function\n\n<math> \\psi^{(0)}(\\vec{r}_2, \\vec{r}_1) = \\psi_{n_2,l_2,m_2}(\\vec{r}_1) \\psi_{n_1,l_1,m_1}(\\vec{r}_2) </math>\n\nAn exchange of electron labels corresponds to the same energy <math> E^{(0)}_{n_1,n_2} </math>. This particular case of [[Degeneracy (quantum mechanics)|degeneracy]] with respect to exchange of electron labels is called [[exchange degeneracy]]. The exact spatial wave functions of two-electron atoms must either be symmetric or [[Even and odd functions|antisymmetric]] with respect to the interchange of the coordinates <math> \\vec{r}_1 </math> and <math> \\vec{r}_2 </math> of the two electrons. The proper wave function then must be composed of the symmetric (+) and antisymmetric(-) linear combinations:\n\n<math> \\psi^{(0)}_\\pm(\\vec{r}_1, \\vec{r}_2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} [\\psi_{n_1,l_1,m_1}(\\vec{r}_1) \\psi_{n_2,l_2,m_2}(\\vec{r}_2) \\pm \\psi_{n_2,l_2,m_2}(\\vec{r}_1) \\psi_{n_1,l_1,m_1}(\\vec{r}_2)] </math>\n\nThis comes from [[Slater determinants]].\n\nThe factor <math> \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} </math> normalizes <math> \\psi^{(0)}_\\pm </math>. In order to get this wave function into a single product of one-particle wave functions, we use the fact that this is in the ground state. So <math> n_1=n_2=1,\\, l_1=l_2=0,\\, m_1=m_2=0 </math>. So the <math> \\psi^{(0)}_{-}</math> will vanish, in agreement with the original formulation of the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], in which two electrons cannot be in the same state. Therefore, the wave function for helium can be written as\n\n<math> \\psi^{(0)}_0(\\vec{r}_1, \\vec{r}_2) = \\psi_1(\\vec{r_1}) \\psi_1(\\vec{r_2}) = \\frac{Z^3}{\\pi} e^{-Z(r_1 + r_2)} </math>\n\nWhere <math> \\psi_1 </math> and <math> \\psi_2 </math> use the wave functions for the hydrogen Hamiltonian. {{efn|1=For n = 1, l = 0 and m = 0, the [[Particle in a spherically symmetric potential|wavefunction in a spherically symmetric potential]] for a hydrogen electron is <math>\\psi_(r) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\left(\\frac{Z}{a_0}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\ e^{-{\\textstyle \\frac{Zr}{a_0}}}\\; </math>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/hydwf.html|title=Hydrogen Wavefunctions|website = Hyperphysics|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201162948/http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/hydwf.html|archivedate=1 February 2014}}</ref> In [[atomic units]], the [[Bohr radius]] <math>{a_0}</math> equals 1, and the wavefunction becomes <math>\\psi_(r) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} Z^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\ e^{-{\\textstyle Zr}}\\; </math>.}} For helium, Z = 2 from\n\n<math> E^{(0)}_0 = E^{(0)}_{n_1=1,\\, n_2=1} = -Z^2 \\text{ a.u.} </math>\n\nwhere E<math>^{(0)}_0</math> = &minus;4 a.u. which is approximately &minus;108.8 eV, which corresponds to an ionization potential V<math>_P^{(0)}</math> = 2 a.u.

(&cong; 24.6 eV).\n\nThe energy that we obtained is too low because the repulsion term between the electrons was ignored, whose effect is to raise the energy levels. As Z gets bigger, our approach should yield better results, since the electron-electron repulsion term will get smaller.\n\nSo far a very crude independent-particle approximation has been used, in which the electron-electron repulsion term is completely omitted. Splitting the Hamiltonian showed below will improve the results:\n\n<math> H = \\bar{H_0} + \\bar{H'} </math>\n\nwhere\n\n<math> \\bar{H_0} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\nabla^2_{r_1} + V(r_1) - \\frac{1}{2} \\nabla^2_{r_2} + V(r_2) </math>\n\nand\n\n<math> \\bar{H'} = \\frac{1}{r_{12}} - \\frac{Z}{r_1} -V(r_1) - \\frac{Z}{r_2} - V(r_2) </math>\n\nV(r) is a central potential which is chosen so that the effect of the perturbation <math> \\bar{H'} </math> is small. The net effect of each electron on the motion of the other one is to screen somewhat the charge of the nucleus, so a simple guess for V(r) is\n\n<math> V(r) = -\\frac{Z-S}{r} = - \\frac{Z_e}{r} </math>\n\nwhere S is a screening constant and the quantity Z<sub>e</sub> is the effective charge. The potential is a Coulomb interaction, so the corresponding individual electron energies are given (in a.u.) by\n\n<math> E_0 = -(Z-S)^2 = - Z_e^2 </math>\n\nand the corresponding wave function is given by\n\n<math> \\psi_0(r_1\\,  r_2) = \\frac{Z_e^3}{\\pi} e^{-Z_e(r_1 + r_2)} </math>\n\nIf Z<sub>e</sub> was 1.70, that would make the expression above for the ground state energy agree with the experimental value E<sub>0</sub> = &minus;2.903 a.u. of the ground state energy of helium. Since Z = 2 in this case, the screening constant is S = 0.30. For the ground state of helium, for the average shielding approximation, the screening effect of each electron on the other one is equivalent to about <math> \\frac{1}{3} </math> of the electronic charge.<ref>B.H. Bransden and C.J. Joachain's ''Physics of Atoms and Molecules'' 2nd edition Pearson Education, Inc</ref>\n\n==Thomas\u2013Fermi method==\n{{expert needed|Physics|section|date=July 2009}}\nNot long after Schr\u00f6dinger developed the wave equation, the [[Thomas\u2013Fermi model]] was developed. Density functional theory is used to describe the particle density <math>\\rho(\\vec{r}),\\, r\\, \\epsilon\\, \\reals^3</math>, and the ground state energy E(N), where N is the number of electrons in the atom. If there are a large number of electrons, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation runs into problems, because it gets very difficult to solve, even in the atom's ground states. This is where density functional theory comes in. Thomas\u2013Fermi theory gives very good intuition of what is happening in the ground states of atoms and molecules with N electrons.\n\nThe energy functional for an atom with N electrons is given by:\n\n<math>\\xi = \\frac{3}{5}   \\gamma \\int_{\\reals^3} \\rho^{5/3}(\\vec{r}) d^3\\vec{r}\\, + \\int_{\\reals^3} V(\\vec{r}) \\rho(\\vec{r}) d^3\\vec{r}\\, + \\frac{e^2}{2} \\int_{\\reals^3} \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r})\\rho(\\vec{r'})}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|}\\, d^3\\vec{r}d^3\\vec{r'} </math>\n\nWhere\n\n<math>\\gamma = (3\\pi^2)^{2/3} \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} </math>\n\nThe electron density needs to be greater than or equal to 0, <math>\\int_{\\reals^3} \\rho = N</math>, and <math>\\rho \\rightarrow \\xi </math> is convex.\n\nIn the energy functional, each term holds a certain meaning. The first term describes the minimum quantum-mechanical kinetic energy required to create the electron density <math>\\rho(\\vec{x})</math> for an N number of electrons. The next term is the attractive interaction of the electrons with the nuclei through the Coulomb potential <math> V(\\vec{r}) </math>. The final term is the electron-electron repulsion potential energy.<ref>http://www.physics.nyu.edu/LarrySpruch/Lieb.pdf</ref>\n\nSo the Hamiltonian for a system of many electrons can be written:\n\n<math>H = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\Bigg[-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla_i^2 + V(\\vec{r_i})\\Bigg] + \\int \\frac{e^2\\rho(\\vec{r'})}{|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'</math>\n\nFor helium, N = 2, so the Hamiltonian is given by:\n\n<math> H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} (\\nabla_1^2 + \\nabla_2^2) + V(\\vec{r_1}, \\, \\vec{r_2}) + \\int \\frac{e^2 \\rho(\\vec{r'})} {|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r'  </math>\n\nWhere\n\n<math> \\int \\frac{e^2 \\rho(\\vec{r'})} {|\\vec{r} - \\vec{r'}|} d^3r' = \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r}_1 - \\vec{r}_2|},\\, \\text{ and }\\,  V(\\vec{r_1}, \\, \\vec{r_2}) = \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\Bigg[\\frac{2}{r_1} + \\frac{2}{r_2} \\Bigg] </math>\n\nyielding\n\n<math> H = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} (\\nabla_1^2 + \\nabla_2^2) + \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\Bigg[\\frac{2}{r_1} + \\frac{2}{r_2} - \\frac{1}{|\\vec{r}_1 - \\vec{r}_2|}\\Bigg] </math>\n\nFrom the Hartree\u2013Fock method, it is known that ignoring the electron-electron repulsion term, the energy is 8E<sub>1</sub> = &minus;109 eV.\n\n==The variational method==\nTo obtain a more accurate energy the [[variational principle]] can be applied to the electron-electron potential V<sub>ee </sub>using the wave function\n\n<math> \\psi_0(\\vec{r}_1,\\, \\vec{r}_2) = \\frac{8}{\\pi a^3} e^{-2(r_1+r_2)/a} </math>:\n\n<math> \\langle H \\rangle = 8E_1 + \\langle V_{ee} \\rangle = 8E_1 + \\Bigg(\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\Bigg) \\Bigg(\\frac{8}{\\pi a^3}\\Bigg)^2 \\int \\frac{e^{-4(r_1 + r_2)/a}} {|\\vec{r}_1 - \\vec{r}_2|}\\, d^3\\vec{r}_1 \\, d^3\\vec{r}_2 </math>\n\nAfter integrating this, the result is:\n\n<math> \\langle H \\rangle = 8E_1 + \\frac{5}{4a} \\Bigg(\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\Bigg) = 8E_1 - \\frac{5}{2}E_1 = -109 + 34 = -75 \\text{ eV} </math>\n\nThis is closer to the experimental value, but if a better trial wave function is used, an even more accurate answer could be obtained. An ideal wave function would be one that doesn't ignore the influence of the other electron. In other words, each electron represents a cloud of negative charge which somewhat shields the nucleus so that the other electron actually sees an effective nuclear charge Z that is less than 2. A wave function of this type is given by:\n\n<math> \\psi(\\vec{r}_1, \\vec{r}_2) = \\frac{Z^3}{\\pi a^3} e^{-Z(r_1+r_2)/a} </math>\n\nTreating Z as a variational parameter to minimize H. The Hamiltonian using the wave function above is given by:\n\n<math> \\langle H \\rangle = 2Z^2E_1 + 2(Z-2) \\Bigg(\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\Bigg) \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{r} \\right\\rangle + \\left\\langle V_{ee} \\right\\rangle </math>\n\nAfter calculating the expectation value of <math> \\frac{1}{r} </math> and V<sub>ee</sub> the expectation value of the Hamiltonian becomes:\n\n<math> \\langle H \\rangle = \\left[-2Z^2 + \\frac{27}{4}Z\\right]E_1 </math>\n\nThe minimum value of Z needs to be calculated, so taking a derivative with respect to Z and setting the equation to 0 will give the minimum value of Z:\n\n<math> \\frac{d}{dZ} \\left(\\left[-2Z^2 + \\frac{27}{4}Z\\right] E_1\\right) = 0 </math>\n\n<math> Z = \\frac{27}{16} \\sim 1.69 </math>\n\nThis shows that the other electron somewhat shields the nucleus reducing the effective charge from 2 to 1.69. So we obtain the most accurate result yet:\n\n<math> \\frac{1}{2} \\Bigg(\\frac{3}{2}\\Bigg)^6 E_1 = -77.5 \\text{ eV} </math>\n\nWhere again, '''E<sub>1</sub>''' represents the ionization energy of hydrogen.\n\nBy using more complicated/accurate wave functions, the ground state energy of helium has been calculated closer and closer to the experimental value &minus;78.95 eV.<ref>David I.

At Wimbledon, Tomic was fined $15,000 (\u00a311,500) after his first round exit against [[Mischa Zverev]].

In the fifth rubber he picked up another victory over Lee Hsin-han.\n\nTomic was called back into the team in July 2011 for the tie against [[China Davis Cup team|China]]. Following a shock loss in the first match, Tomic drew Australia level in the second rubber of the tie against [[Zhang Ze]]. Tomic's reverse singles match was cancelled due to Australia winning the tie 3\u20131. In September 2011 at the [[2011 Davis Cup#World Group Play-offs|Davis Cup World Group Playoffs]] Tomic pulled off the biggest scalp of his Davis Cup career by defeating world number 19 [[Stanislas Wawrinka]] in four sets. In the reverse rubber, Tomic faced his childhood hero [[Roger Federer]], losing in four sets.\n\nPrior to the commencement of the [[2012 ATP World Tour|2012 ATP season]], Tomic and [[Lleyton Hewitt]] both committed to the Davis Cup team for all ties in a bid to re-enter the world group. In the second rubber of the first zonal tie against [[China Davis Cup team|China]], Tomic was victorious against [[Wu Di (tennis)|Wu Di]]. In the second zonal tie of 2012, he recorded two straight sets victories in a 5\u20130 rout of [[South Korea Davis Cup team|South Korea]]. In the [[2012 Davis Cup]] World Group Playoffs, Tomic was victorious in his first rubber against [[Cedrik-Marcel Stebe]] in four sets but fell to [[Florian Mayer]] in straight sets which would see Australia lose to [[Germany Davis Cup team|Germany]] 3\u20132 overall.\n\nFollowing poor off court behaviour in late 2012, Tomic was suspended from playing for Australia in the first round of the 2013 Davis Cup competition. After serving a one tie ban, Tomic returned to the Australian Davis Cup team in their 2013 zonal semifinal against [[Uzbekistan Davis Cup team|Uzbekistan]] and later that year was instrumental in Australia's return to the World Group after an away playoff victory over [[Poland Davis Cup team|Poland]]. Injuries prevented Tomic from competing in the Davis Cup competition in 2014 but he returned for Australia's first round of the [[2015 Davis Cup]] against the [[Czech Republic Davis Cup team|Czech Republic]]. Despite facing the two-time defending champions away, Tomic secured two crucial singles victories and led Australia to a 3\u20132 victory over the Czech Republic. It was the first time Australia had reached the second round of the Davis Cup world group since 2006. Tomic was then once again suspended from the Australian Davis Cup team for an outburst during a Wimbledon press conference. Tomic returned to the team once again in the 2015 semifinal against [[Great Britain Davis Cup team|Great Britain]] and scored a crucial four set victory over [[Dan Evans (tennis)|Dan Evans]] in the second rubber. Tomic played for Australia at the 2016 Davis Cup where they faced the United States. He won his first match against [[Jack Sock]] in four sets. However, he lost the reverse singles to [[John Isner]] which meant Australia lost in the first round.\n\n===Olympics (0\u20131)===\n\nTomic represented [[Australia at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Australia]] in his maiden Olympics at [[2012 Summer Olympics|London 2012]].

Scully is best known for his 67 seasons calling games for [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], beginning in [[1950 Brooklyn Dodgers season|1950]] (when the franchise was located in [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn]]) and ending in [[2016 Los Angeles Dodgers season|2016]]. His run constitutes the longest tenure of any broadcaster with a single team in professional sports history, and he is second only to [[Tommy Lasorda]] (by two years) in terms of number of years associated with the Dodgers organization in any capacity. He retired at age 88 in 2016, ending his record-breaking run as their [[Sports commentator|play-by-play]] announcer.\n\nIn his final season behind the microphone, Scully announced most Dodger home games (and selected road games) on [[SportsNet LA]] television and [[KLAC]] radio. He is known for his dulcet voice, lyrically descriptive style, and signature introduction to Dodger games: ''\"It's time for Dodger baseball! Hi, everybody, and a very pleasant good (afternoon/evening) to you, wherever you may be.\"'' He is considered by many to be the greatest baseball broadcaster of all time, according to fan rankings, [[Bleacher Report]] and [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/mlb/gallery/best-announcers-in-baseball-050510|title=A look at baseball's best announcers|first1=foxsports|last1=Oct 20|first2=2016 at 5:00p|last2=ET|website=FOX Sports}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to calling Dodgers baseball, Scully called various national baseball, football, and golf contests for [[CBS Sports]] from 1975 to 1982, and was [[NBC Sports]]' lead baseball play-by-play announcer from 1983 to 1989.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in the [[The Bronx|Bronx]], Scully grew up in the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] section of [[Manhattan]].<ref name=NYTimes>Sandomir, Richard.

He received only one response, from [[CBS Radio News|CBS Radio]] affiliate [[WTOP-FM|WTOP]] in Washington, D.C., which made him a fill-in.\n\nScully was then recruited by [[Red Barber]], the sports director of the CBS Radio Network, for its [[college football]] coverage. Scully impressed his boss with his coverage of a November 1949 [[Maryland Terrapins|University of Maryland]] versus [[Boston University Terriers|Boston University]] football game from frigid [[Fenway Park]] in Boston, despite having to do so from the stadium roof. Expecting an enclosed press box, Scully had left his coat and gloves at his hotel, but never mentioned his discomfort on the air.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jul/27/sports/sp-crowe27|title=The day Vin Scully came in from the cold|last=Crowe|first=Jerry|work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 27, 2009}}</ref> Barber mentored Scully and told him that if he wanted to be a successful sports announcer he should never be a \"homer\" (openly showing a rooting interest for the team that employs you), never listen to other announcers, and keep his opinions to himself.\n\n===Dodgers (1950\u20132016)===\n\n====Brooklyn (1950\u20131957)====\nIn 1950, Scully joined [[Red Barber]] and [[Connie Desmond]] in the [[1950 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Brooklyn Dodgers]]' radio and television booths. When Barber got into a salary dispute with [[World Series]] sponsor [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]] in 1953, Scully took Barber's spot for the [[1953 World Series |1953 World Series]]. At the age of 25, Scully became the youngest person to broadcast a World Series game (a record that stands to this day). Barber left the Dodgers after the [[1953 | 1953 Brooklyn Dodgers Season]] season to work for the [[New York Yankees]]. Scully eventually became the Dodgers' principal announcer. Scully announced Dodgers games in Brooklyn until 1957, after which the club moved to Los Angeles. During that time, Dodgers broadcasts were heard over [[WEPN (AM)|WMGM radio (1050)]] on the AM dial, as well as [[WWOR-TV|WOR-TV (channel 9)]] both in New York.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mrpopculture.com/1957 | title= Mr. Pop 1957 Year In Review }}</ref>\n\n====Los Angeles (1958\u20132016)====\nBeginning with the [[1958 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1958 season]], Scully accompanied the Dodgers to their new location and quickly became popular in [[Southern California]]. During the Dodgers' first four seasons in Los Angeles, inexperienced baseball fans had difficulty following the action in the very large [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], and it soon became common for them to bring [[transistor radio]]s to the games to hear Scully and partner [[Jerry Doggett]] describe the action.  This practice continued even after the team moved to the much smaller [[Dodger Stadium]] for the [[1962 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1962 baseball season]]. Radio and television engineers often had difficulty compensating for the sound of Scully's play-by-play reverberating through the stands at Dodgers home games.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/04/606816/the-transistor-kid |title=The Transistor Kid | last=Creamer | first=Robert |work=Sports Illustrated | date=May 4, 1964 | accessdate=April 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 1964, the [[1964 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] offered Scully the job to replace the recently fired [[Mel Allen]] as their lead play-by-play announcer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://keitholbermann.mlblogs.com/archives/2009/05/vin_scully_voice_of_the_yankee.html |title=Vin Scully, Voice Of The Yankees |last=Olbermann |first=Keith |publisher=MLBlogs Network |date=May 18, 2009}}</ref> Scully declined the offer and chose to remain with the Dodgers.

When Gowdy inherited the announcing reins, Scully was so upset that he refused to say another word.\n\nUnlike the modern style in which multiple sportscasters have an on-air conversation (usually with one functioning as [[Sports commentator|play-by-play announcer]] and another as [[color commentator]]), Scully and his broadcast partners Jerry Doggett (1956\u20131987) and [[Ross Porter (sportscaster)|Ross Porter]] (1977\u20132004) called games solo with Scully working the entire game except for the 3rd and 7th innings. When Doggett retired after the [[1987 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1987 season]], he was replaced by Hall-of-Fame Dodgers pitcher [[Don Drysdale]], who previously broadcast games for the [[California Angels]]. Drysdale died in his hotel room following a heart attack before a game against the [[1993 Montreal Expos season|Montreal Expos]] in [[1993 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1993]], resulting in a very difficult broadcast for Scully and Porter, who were told of the death but could not mention it on-air until Drysdale's family had been notified and the official announcement of the death made.<ref name=\"Dodgers' Death Brings out the Best\">{{cite news | title = Dodgers' Death Brings Out the Best| url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5DF1031F934A35754C0A965958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1|work=New York Times | accessdate =February 26, 2009 | first=Claire | last=Smith | date=July 7, 1993}}</ref> Scully announced the news of his death by saying, \"Never have I been asked to make an announcement that hurts me as much as this one.

From [[1975 NFL season|1975]] to [[1981 NFL season|1982]], Scully announced [[NFL on CBS|National Football League]] telecasts for [[CBS Sports]], teaming with several different [[color analyst]]s including [[Sonny Jurgensen]], [[Paul Hornung]], [[Alex Hawkins]], [[George Allen (American football coach)|George Allen]], [[Jim Brown]], [[John Madden]], and [[Hank Stram]]. One of his most famous NFL calls was that of [[Dwight Clark]]'s touchdown [[The Catch (American football)|catch]] in the [[1981\u201382 NFL playoffs#NFC: San Francisco 49ers 28, Dallas Cowboys 27|NFC Championship Game]] on January 10, 1982 (which Scully called with Stram as his final NFL telecast for CBS), that put the [[1981 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] into [[Super Bowl XVI]].\n\n{{quote|[[Joe Montana|Montana]] ... looking, looking, throwing in the endzone ...

Scully's network commitments led to his working a reduced schedule with the Dodgers, who hired [[Ross Porter (sportscaster)|Ross Porter]] to help pick up the slack.\n\nIn [[1977 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1977]], Scully began his first of two stints calling baseball for [[Major League Baseball on CBS Radio|CBS Radio]], broadcasting the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] through [[1982 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1982]] (usually paired with [[Brent Musburger]]) and the [[World Series]] from [[1979 World Series|1979]] to [[1982 World Series|1982]] (alongside [[Sparky Anderson]]).\n\n====Departure from CBS====\nScully decided to leave CBS in favor of a job calling [[Major League Baseball on NBC|baseball games for NBC]] (beginning in 1983) following a dispute over assignment prominence (according to CBS Sports producer Terry O'Neil, in the book ''The Game Behind the Game''<ref>{{cite book |last=O'Neil|first=Terry|date=1989|title=The Game Behind the Game: High Pressure, High Stakes in Sports Television|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yg-DAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Game+Behind+the+Game+Terry+O%27Neil&q=Vin+Scully|location= |publisher=Harper and Row|page=110|isbn= 9780060160197|access-date= }}</ref>). CBS decided going into the [[1981 NFL season]] that [[John Madden]], whom CBS had hired in [[1979 NFL season|1979]] and who had called games alongside [[Frank Glieber]] and [[Gary Bender]] his first two years, was going to be the star [[color commentator]] of their NFL television coverage. But they had trouble figuring out who was going to be his play-by-play partner, since Scully was in a battle with CBS' lead play-by-play announcer [[Pat Summerall]] for the position. At the time Scully was the number two announcer for CBS, a position he had held since [[1975 NFL season|1975]], and was calling games alongside the former [[Kansas City Chiefs]] head coach [[Hank Stram]], who had been promoted from CBS' number three broadcast team alongside [[Curt Gowdy]].\n\nTo resolve the situation, both Scully and Summerall were paired with Madden<ref name=\"NYTimes2016\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/sports/baseball/vin-scully-nfl-pat-summerall-john-madden.html?_r=0|title=The Day Vin Scully Didn't Land That N.F.L.

While Summerall was away calling the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open tennis tournament]] for CBS as he did every September, Scully called the first four weeks of the season alongside Madden. After that Scully went on to cover the [[1981 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]] and [[1981 World Series|World Series]] for CBS Radio, as he had done for the past few Octobers, and Summerall returned to the broadcast booth to work with Madden. Scully then teamed with Stram for the remainder of the NFL season.\n\nAfter the eighth week of the NFL season, CBS Sports decided that Summerall meshed more with Madden than Scully did and it named him to be the announcer who would call [[Super Bowl XVI]] for CBS on January 24, 1982, at the [[Pontiac Silverdome]].<ref name=\"NYTimes2016\"/> An angry Scully, who felt that his intelligence had been insulted by the move,<ref name=\"NYTimes2016\"/> was assigned as a consolation prize that year's [[1981\u201382 NFL playoffs#NFC: San Francisco 49ers 28, Dallas Cowboys 27|NFC Championship Game]], which he called alongside Stram. Summerall took Stram's place alongside [[Jack Buck]] to call the game over [[NFL on Westwood One Sports|CBS Radio]].\n\n===NBC (1983\u20131989)===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:NBC SportsJoeandVin.jpg|right|thumb|[[Joe Garagiola Sr.|Joe Garagiola]] and Vin Scully (right) as depicted on the cover of the [[souvenir program]] for the [[1983 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]].]] -->\nOutside of [[Southern California]], Vin Scully is remembered as [[NBC Sports|NBC]] television's lead baseball broadcaster from 1983 to 1989. Besides calling the [[Major League Baseball Game of the Week|Saturday ''Game of the Week'']] for NBC, Scully called three World Series ([[1984 World Series|1984]], [[1986 World Series|1986]], and [[1988 World Series|1988]]), four [[National League Championship Series]] ([[1983 National League Championship Series|1983]], [[1985 National League Championship Series|1985]], [[1987 National League Championship Series|1987]], and [[1989 National League Championship Series|1989]]), and four [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Games]] ([[1983 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1983]], [[1985 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1985]], [[1987 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1987]], and [[1989 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1989]]). Scully also reworked his Dodgers schedule during this period, broadcasting home games on the radio, and road games for the Dodgers television network, with Fridays and Saturdays off so he could work for NBC. During his stint at NBC, Scully provided the call for one of baseball's most memorable plays when [[Bill Buckner]] made a tenth-inning [[Error (baseball)|error]] in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series against the [[New York Mets]]:\n\n{{quote|Little roller up along first.

Meanwhile, the [[1989 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Dodgers]] were playing a series in [[Astrodome|Houston]], where Scully flew to be on hand to call the Sunday game of the series. However, the Saturday night game between the teams was going into extra innings when Scully arrived in town, so he went to the Astrodome instead of his hotel. He picked up the play-by-play, helping to relieve the other Dodger announcers, who were doing both television and radio, and broadcast the final 13 innings (after already calling 10 innings in St. Louis), as the game went 22 innings. He broadcast 23 innings in one day in two different cities.\n\n[[Laryngitis]] prevented Scully from calling Game 2 of the [[1989 National League Championship Series]] between the [[1989 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] and [[1983 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]]. [[Bob Costas]], who was working the [[1989 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]] between [[1989 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland]] and [[1989 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto]] with [[Tony Kubek]] for NBC, was flown from Toronto to Chicago to fill in that evening (an off day for the ALCS). The final Major League Baseball game that Scully called for NBC was Game 5 of the 1989 NLCS on October 9. There, the Giants led by first baseman [[Will Clark]] clinched their first National League pennant since [[1962 San Francisco Giants season|1962]].\n\nAfter the [[1989 in baseball|1989 season]], NBC (along with [[Major League Baseball on ABC|ABC]], with whom NBC had shared baseball coverage since 1976), lost the [[Major League Baseball television contracts|television rights]] to cover Major League Baseball to [[Major League Baseball on CBS#1990\u20131993 version|CBS]]. For the first time since 1946, NBC would not televise baseball. In the aftermath, Scully said of NBC losing baseball, \"It's a passing of a great American tradition. It is sad. I really and truly feel that. It will leave a vast window, to use a [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] word,<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date=September 29, 1989|title=Baseball on NBC: Thanks for the Memories|url=http://newsok.com/article/2282484|work=Oklahoman|location= |access-date= }}</ref> where people will not get Major League Baseball and I think that's a tragedy. ...

Scully also returned to being the national radio announcer for the [[World Series]], since CBS Radio gave him the position that [[Jack Buck]] had vacated in order to become the primary announcer of CBS-TV coverage of Major League Baseball.

In 1999, Scully was the master of ceremonies for [[MasterCard]]'s ''[[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]]'' before the start of Game 2 of the [[1999 World Series|World Series]].\n\nThe Dodgers management announced in February 2006 that it had extended Scully's contract through the [[2008 Los Angeles Dodgers season|2008 baseball season]] for about $3 million per year. For health reasons, beginning around [[2005 Los Angeles Dodgers season|2005]], Scully no longer called most non-playoff games played east of [[Chase Field|Phoenix]].

Scully is best known for his 67 seasons calling games for [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], beginning in [[1950 Brooklyn Dodgers season|1950]] (when the franchise was located in [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn]]) and ending in [[2016 Los Angeles Dodgers season|2016]]. His run constitutes the longest tenure of any broadcaster with a single team in professional sports history, and he is second only to [[Tommy Lasorda]] (by two years) in terms of number of years associated with the Dodgers organization in any capacity. He retired at age 88 in 2016, ending his record-breaking run as their [[Sports commentator|play-by-play]] announcer.\n\nIn his final season behind the microphone, Scully announced most Dodger home games (and selected road games) on [[SportsNet LA]] television and [[KLAC]] radio. He is known for his dulcet voice, lyrically descriptive style, and signature introduction to Dodger games: ''\"It's time for Dodger baseball! Hi, everybody, and a very pleasant good (afternoon/evening) to you, wherever you may be.\"'' He is considered by many to be the greatest baseball broadcaster of all time, according to fan rankings, [[Bleacher Report]] and [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/mlb/gallery/best-announcers-in-baseball-050510|title=A look at baseball's best announcers|first1=foxsports|last1=Oct 20|first2=2016 at 5:00p|last2=ET|website=FOX Sports}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to calling Dodgers baseball, Scully called various national baseball, football, and golf contests for [[CBS Sports]] from 1975 to 1982, and was [[NBC Sports]]' lead baseball play-by-play announcer from 1983 to 1989.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in the [[The Bronx|Bronx]], Scully grew up in the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] section of [[Manhattan]].<ref name=NYTimes>Sandomir, Richard.

Scully impressed his boss with his coverage of a November 1949 [[Maryland Terrapins|University of Maryland]] versus [[Boston University Terriers|Boston University]] football game from frigid [[Fenway Park]] in Boston, despite having to do so from the stadium roof. Expecting an enclosed press box, Scully had left his coat and gloves at his hotel, but never mentioned his discomfort on the air.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jul/27/sports/sp-crowe27|title=The day Vin Scully came in from the cold|last=Crowe|first=Jerry|work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 27, 2009}}</ref> Barber mentored Scully and told him that if he wanted to be a successful sports announcer he should never be a \"homer\" (openly showing a rooting interest for the team that employs you), never listen to other announcers, and keep his opinions to himself.\n\n===Dodgers (1950\u20132016)===\n\n====Brooklyn (1950\u20131957)====\nIn 1950, Scully joined [[Red Barber]] and [[Connie Desmond]] in the [[1950 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Brooklyn Dodgers]]' radio and television booths. When Barber got into a salary dispute with [[World Series]] sponsor [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]] in 1953, Scully took Barber's spot for the [[1953 World Series |1953 World Series]]. At the age of 25, Scully became the youngest person to broadcast a World Series game (a record that stands to this day). Barber left the Dodgers after the [[1953 | 1953 Brooklyn Dodgers Season]] season to work for the [[New York Yankees]]. Scully eventually became the Dodgers' principal announcer. Scully announced Dodgers games in Brooklyn until 1957, after which the club moved to Los Angeles. During that time, Dodgers broadcasts were heard over [[WEPN (AM)|WMGM radio (1050)]] on the AM dial, as well as [[WWOR-TV|WOR-TV (channel 9)]] both in New York.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mrpopculture.com/1957 | title= Mr. Pop 1957 Year In Review }}</ref>\n\n====Los Angeles (1958\u20132016)====\nBeginning with the [[1958 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1958 season]], Scully accompanied the Dodgers to their new location and quickly became popular in [[Southern California]]. During the Dodgers' first four seasons in Los Angeles, inexperienced baseball fans had difficulty following the action in the very large [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], and it soon became common for them to bring [[transistor radio]]s to the games to hear Scully and partner [[Jerry Doggett]] describe the action.  This practice continued even after the team moved to the much smaller [[Dodger Stadium]] for the [[1962 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1962 baseball season]]. Radio and television engineers often had difficulty compensating for the sound of Scully's play-by-play reverberating through the stands at Dodgers home games.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.si.com/vault/1964/05/04/606816/the-transistor-kid |title=The Transistor Kid | last=Creamer | first=Robert |work=Sports Illustrated | date=May 4, 1964 | accessdate=April 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 1964, the [[1964 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] offered Scully the job to replace the recently fired [[Mel Allen]] as their lead play-by-play announcer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://keitholbermann.mlblogs.com/archives/2009/05/vin_scully_voice_of_the_yankee.html |title=Vin Scully, Voice Of The Yankees |last=Olbermann |first=Keith |publisher=MLBlogs Network |date=May 18, 2009}}</ref> Scully declined the offer and chose to remain with the Dodgers.

Typically, the [[Gillette Company]], the [[Commissioner of Baseball]] and [[NBC]] television would choose the announcers, who would represent each of the teams that were in the World Series for the respective year. For the [[1966 World Series]], [[Curt Gowdy]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timesunion.com/sports/article/Slim-pickings-to-rank-all-the-World-Series-4924542.php|title=Slim pickings to rank all the World Series analysts|last1=Dougherty|first1=Pete|date=October 24, 2013|website=timesunion.com|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> called half of each game before ceding the microphone to Vin Scully in [[1966 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles]], and [[Chuck Thompson]] in [[1966 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore]]. Scully was not satisfied with the arrangement<ref>{{cite web |url=http://awfulannouncing.com/2016/the-year-vin-scully-was-unhappy-about-his-reduced-role-on-network-television-coverage-of-the-world-series.html|title=THE YEAR VIN SCULLY WAS UNHAPPY ABOUT HIS REDUCED ROLE ON NETWORK TELEVISION COVERAGE OF THE WORLD SERIES|last1=Halberstam|first1=David J.|date=October 24, 2016|website=Awful Announcing|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> as he said \"What about the road? My fans won't be able to hear me.\" In Game 1 of the 1966 World Series, Scully called the first 4\u00bd innings. When Gowdy inherited the announcing reins, Scully was so upset that he refused to say another word.\n\nUnlike the modern style in which multiple sportscasters have an on-air conversation (usually with one functioning as [[Sports commentator|play-by-play announcer]] and another as [[color commentator]]), Scully and his broadcast partners Jerry Doggett (1956\u20131987) and [[Ross Porter (sportscaster)|Ross Porter]] (1977\u20132004) called games solo with Scully working the entire game except for the 3rd and 7th innings. When Doggett retired after the [[1987 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1987 season]], he was replaced by Hall-of-Fame Dodgers pitcher [[Don Drysdale]], who previously broadcast games for the [[California Angels]]. Drysdale died in his hotel room following a heart attack before a game against the [[1993 Montreal Expos season|Montreal Expos]] in [[1993 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1993]], resulting in a very difficult broadcast for Scully and Porter, who were told of the death but could not mention it on-air until Drysdale's family had been notified and the official announcement of the death made.<ref name=\"Dodgers' Death Brings out the Best\">{{cite news | title = Dodgers' Death Brings Out the Best| url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5DF1031F934A35754C0A965958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1|work=New York Times | accessdate =February 26, 2009 | first=Claire | last=Smith | date=July 7, 1993}}</ref> Scully announced the news of his death by saying, \"Never have I been asked to make an announcement that hurts me as much as this one.

From [[1975 NFL season|1975]] to [[1981 NFL season|1982]], Scully announced [[NFL on CBS|National Football League]] telecasts for [[CBS Sports]], teaming with several different [[color analyst]]s including [[Sonny Jurgensen]], [[Paul Hornung]], [[Alex Hawkins]], [[George Allen (American football coach)|George Allen]], [[Jim Brown]], [[John Madden]], and [[Hank Stram]]. One of his most famous NFL calls was that of [[Dwight Clark]]'s touchdown [[The Catch (American football)|catch]] in the [[1981\u201382 NFL playoffs#NFC: San Francisco 49ers 28, Dallas Cowboys 27|NFC Championship Game]] on January 10, 1982 (which Scully called with Stram as his final NFL telecast for CBS), that put the [[1981 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] into [[Super Bowl XVI]].\n\n{{quote|[[Joe Montana|Montana]] ... looking, looking, throwing in the endzone ... Clark caught it! Dwight Clark! ... It's a madhouse at [[Candlestick Park|Candlestick]]!}}\n\nScully also contributed to the network's [[Tennis on CBS|tennis]] and [[PGA Tour on CBS|PGA Tour golf]] coverage in the late 1970s and early 1980s, usually working the golf events with [[Pat Summerall]], [[Ken Venturi]], and Ben Wright.

Scully's network commitments led to his working a reduced schedule with the Dodgers, who hired [[Ross Porter (sportscaster)|Ross Porter]] to help pick up the slack.\n\nIn [[1977 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1977]], Scully began his first of two stints calling baseball for [[Major League Baseball on CBS Radio|CBS Radio]], broadcasting the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] through [[1982 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1982]] (usually paired with [[Brent Musburger]]) and the [[World Series]] from [[1979 World Series|1979]] to [[1982 World Series|1982]] (alongside [[Sparky Anderson]]).\n\n====Departure from CBS====\nScully decided to leave CBS in favor of a job calling [[Major League Baseball on NBC|baseball games for NBC]] (beginning in 1983) following a dispute over assignment prominence (according to CBS Sports producer Terry O'Neil, in the book ''The Game Behind the Game''<ref>{{cite book |last=O'Neil|first=Terry|date=1989|title=The Game Behind the Game: High Pressure, High Stakes in Sports Television|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yg-DAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Game+Behind+the+Game+Terry+O%27Neil&q=Vin+Scully|location= |publisher=Harper and Row|page=110|isbn= 9780060160197|access-date= }}</ref>). CBS decided going into the [[1981 NFL season]] that [[John Madden]], whom CBS had hired in [[1979 NFL season|1979]] and who had called games alongside [[Frank Glieber]] and [[Gary Bender]] his first two years, was going to be the star [[color commentator]] of their NFL television coverage. But they had trouble figuring out who was going to be his play-by-play partner, since Scully was in a battle with CBS' lead play-by-play announcer [[Pat Summerall]] for the position. At the time Scully was the number two announcer for CBS, a position he had held since [[1975 NFL season|1975]], and was calling games alongside the former [[Kansas City Chiefs]] head coach [[Hank Stram]], who had been promoted from CBS' number three broadcast team alongside [[Curt Gowdy]].\n\nTo resolve the situation, both Scully and Summerall were paired with Madden<ref name=\"NYTimes2016\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/sports/baseball/vin-scully-nfl-pat-summerall-john-madden.html?_r=0|title=The Day Vin Scully Didn't Land That N.F.L.

While Summerall was away calling the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open tennis tournament]] for CBS as he did every September, Scully called the first four weeks of the season alongside Madden. After that Scully went on to cover the [[1981 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]] and [[1981 World Series|World Series]] for CBS Radio, as he had done for the past few Octobers, and Summerall returned to the broadcast booth to work with Madden. Scully then teamed with Stram for the remainder of the NFL season.\n\nAfter the eighth week of the NFL season, CBS Sports decided that Summerall meshed more with Madden than Scully did and it named him to be the announcer who would call [[Super Bowl XVI]] for CBS on January 24, 1982, at the [[Pontiac Silverdome]].<ref name=\"NYTimes2016\"/> An angry Scully, who felt that his intelligence had been insulted by the move,<ref name=\"NYTimes2016\"/> was assigned as a consolation prize that year's [[1981\u201382 NFL playoffs#NFC: San Francisco 49ers 28, Dallas Cowboys 27|NFC Championship Game]], which he called alongside Stram. Summerall took Stram's place alongside [[Jack Buck]] to call the game over [[NFL on Westwood One Sports|CBS Radio]].\n\n===NBC (1983\u20131989)===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:NBC SportsJoeandVin.jpg|right|thumb|[[Joe Garagiola Sr.|Joe Garagiola]] and Vin Scully (right) as depicted on the cover of the [[souvenir program]] for the [[1983 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]].]] -->\nOutside of [[Southern California]], Vin Scully is remembered as [[NBC Sports|NBC]] television's lead baseball broadcaster from 1983 to 1989. Besides calling the [[Major League Baseball Game of the Week|Saturday ''Game of the Week'']] for NBC, Scully called three World Series ([[1984 World Series|1984]], [[1986 World Series|1986]], and [[1988 World Series|1988]]), four [[National League Championship Series]] ([[1983 National League Championship Series|1983]], [[1985 National League Championship Series|1985]], [[1987 National League Championship Series|1987]], and [[1989 National League Championship Series|1989]]), and four [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Games]] ([[1983 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1983]], [[1985 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1985]], [[1987 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1987]], and [[1989 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1989]]). Scully also reworked his Dodgers schedule during this period, broadcasting home games on the radio, and road games for the Dodgers television network, with Fridays and Saturdays off so he could work for NBC. During his stint at NBC, Scully provided the call for one of baseball's most memorable plays when [[Bill Buckner]] made a tenth-inning [[Error (baseball)|error]] in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series against the [[New York Mets]]:\n\n{{quote|Little roller up along first.

Meanwhile, the [[1989 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Dodgers]] were playing a series in [[Astrodome|Houston]], where Scully flew to be on hand to call the Sunday game of the series. However, the Saturday night game between the teams was going into extra innings when Scully arrived in town, so he went to the Astrodome instead of his hotel. He picked up the play-by-play, helping to relieve the other Dodger announcers, who were doing both television and radio, and broadcast the final 13 innings (after already calling 10 innings in St. Louis), as the game went 22 innings. He broadcast 23 innings in one day in two different cities.\n\n[[Laryngitis]] prevented Scully from calling Game 2 of the [[1989 National League Championship Series]] between the [[1989 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] and [[1983 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]]. [[Bob Costas]], who was working the [[1989 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]] between [[1989 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland]] and [[1989 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto]] with [[Tony Kubek]] for NBC, was flown from Toronto to Chicago to fill in that evening (an off day for the ALCS). The final Major League Baseball game that Scully called for NBC was Game 5 of the 1989 NLCS on October 9. There, the Giants led by first baseman [[Will Clark]] clinched their first National League pennant since [[1962 San Francisco Giants season|1962]].\n\nAfter the [[1989 in baseball|1989 season]], NBC (along with [[Major League Baseball on ABC|ABC]], with whom NBC had shared baseball coverage since 1976), lost the [[Major League Baseball television contracts|television rights]] to cover Major League Baseball to [[Major League Baseball on CBS#1990\u20131993 version|CBS]]. For the first time since 1946, NBC would not televise baseball. In the aftermath, Scully said of NBC losing baseball, \"It's a passing of a great American tradition. It is sad. I really and truly feel that. It will leave a vast window, to use a [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] word,<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date=September 29, 1989|title=Baseball on NBC: Thanks for the Memories|url=http://newsok.com/article/2282484|work=Oklahoman|location= |access-date= }}</ref> where people will not get Major League Baseball and I think that's a tragedy. ...

Scully also returned to being the national radio announcer for the [[World Series]], since CBS Radio gave him the position that [[Jack Buck]] had vacated in order to become the primary announcer of CBS-TV coverage of Major League Baseball.

He also called the [[Senior Skins Game]] for ABC from [[1992 PGA Tour|1992]] to [[2000 PGA Tour|2000]], as well as various golf events for [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] during this period. In 1999, Scully was the master of ceremonies for [[MasterCard]]'s ''[[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]]'' before the start of Game 2 of the [[1999 World Series|World Series]].\n\nThe Dodgers management announced in February 2006 that it had extended Scully's contract through the [[2008 Los Angeles Dodgers season|2008 baseball season]] for about $3 million per year. For health reasons, beginning around [[2005 Los Angeles Dodgers season|2005]], Scully no longer called most non-playoff games played east of [[Chase Field|Phoenix]]. Exceptions to this rule were the [[2007 Major League Baseball season|2007 opening series]] in [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Milwaukee]], a series against the [[2007 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] in [[2007 Los Angeles Dodgers season|2007]], a series against the [[2010 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] in [[2010 Los Angeles Dodgers season|2010]], and the series in Australia against the Diamondbacks that opened the [[2014 Los Angeles Dodgers season|2014 baseball season]]. He was also not normally scheduled to announce Dodgers games (on either radio or TV) that were televised by [[ESPN Major League Baseball|ESPN]] on ''[[Sunday Night Baseball]]'' or by [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]] on the Saturday ''[[Major League Baseball Game of the Week|Game of the Week]]''.\n\nAs of his final season in 2016, Scully called approximately 100 games per season (all home games and select road games in San Francisco, San Diego, and Anaheim)<ref name=\"Vin Scully trims '12 travel schedule\">{{cite news |last=Jackson |first=Tony |title=Vin Scully trims '12 travel schedule |newspaper=ESPNLosAngeles.com |date= March 18, 2012 |url=http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/mlb/story/_/id/7701588/vin-scully-legendary-los-angeles-dodgers-broadcaster-further-trims-12-travel-schedule |accessdate=June 4, 2012}}</ref> for both [[flagship]] radio station [[KLAC (AM)|KLAC]] and television outlet [[SportsNet LA]].

Scully returned to the announcers' booth on April 15, 2012, which was the 65th anniversary of [[Jackie Robinson]]'s breaking of the color barrier in baseball. It was just the second time in 35 years the legendary sports broadcaster had missed a [[Dodger Stadium]] home opener: The first time was when he was busy broadcasting the [[1977 Masters Tournament|Masters golf tournament]] for CBS in [[1977 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1977]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/10/scully-misses-dodgers-opener-with-illness/ | newspaper=The New York Times | first=Lynn | last=Zinser | title=Scully Misses Dodgers Opener With Illness | date=April 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Retirement ===\nOn January 31, 2016, Scully announced that he planned to retire from broadcasting after the conclusion of the [[2016 Los Angeles Dodgers season|2016 season]]; his final game was the team's October 2 finale at [[2016 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco]]. Scully left open the possibility of calling postseason games (but not the [[2016 World Series|World Series]]) if the Dodgers were to advance; in September, however, Scully stated that he would retire after the end of the regular season and not call postseason games because he did not want to \"say goodbye 12 different times.\" Scully was assigned a total of six road games for the 2016 season: the opening game in San Diego, two games in Anaheim, and the entirety of the three-game regular-season closing series in San Francisco.<ref name=\"espn-lastseason\">{{cite web|title=Vin Scully talks schedule for last year behind microphone|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/14684886/vin-scully-says-los-angeles-dodgers-trip-san-francisco-final-regular-season-call|website=ESPN.com|accessdate=1 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nScully was honored by the Dodgers during their September 23 home game against the Rockies, which featured a pre-game ceremony that paid tribute to his career.

The protagonist asks Hermonthis' hand in marriage, which is refused, as he is only 27 and Hermonthis is over 30 centuries, and deserves someone who is equally durable.
