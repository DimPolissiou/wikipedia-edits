He was born in Ugep in 1916 and died in 1995. He was educated at the famous Hope Waddell Training Institute, Calabar. Dr Arikpo was a distinguished Academic. He bagged a First Class Degree in Chemistry in the University of London. He strayed into anthropology and bagged a Doctorate Degree in the University College, London; He later studied Law and was called to the English Bar in 1956. He authored many books including the classic: the development of Modern Nigeria (1967). He was reputed to be the First West African to bag a Doctor of Philosophy Degree in Anthropology.\n\nDr. Okoi Arikpo was President of the West African Student's Union in the United Kingdom in the early 1940s. This organization was the rally point for students from West Africa who were studying in the Great Britain. WASU was lobbying members of the British Parliament to draw their attention to the political problems facing African Colonies and their leaders back home in different African Countries. The organization was the pivot for galvanization for support of some left thinking people to the plight of the colonial territories. WASU was the fulcrum of social and political activities of Students and people of West African Origin in the United Kingdom. Some of its activities include lobbying members of the British Parliament to draw their attention to the political problems facing African Colonies and their leaders.\n\nDr. Okoi Arikpo was the first Minister for Lands & Survey in the Nigerian Government that was formed after the Macpherson Constitution came into force. Okoi Arikpo was one of the four Legislators elected into the Eastern Regional House of Assembly who were chosen to represent the Eastern Region in the Central House of Legislature in Lagos that was promulgated after the coming into force of the Macpherson Constitution. Okoi Arikpo was also a cabinet Minister in the 1957 Government formed by Sir Abubukar TafawaBalewa.\n\nOkoi Arikpo was an Activist. He was at the vanguard of the campaign to draw the attention of the Colonial Government to the plight of the minority people of the Eastern and Northern Region. He resigned from the NCNC in protest at the treatment meted out to the then Leader of Government Business in the Eastern Nigerian Government, late Professor Eyo Ita, who was pressured by the leadership of the NCNC to step down in order for Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe to assume the position he was occupying after he had lost out in the power struggle in the Western Nigeria where members of this Party in the Western Region had succumbed to pressure mounted on them not to allow Dr. Azikiwe, an Igbo become leader of Government Business after his Party won the Western Regional election.\n\nThereafter Dr. Okoi Arikpo teamed with other minority rights activists to form the United Nigeria Independence Party which later allied with the Action Group as the opposition in the Eastern Region. He was in the forefront of the fight for autonomy of the ethnic minorities in the East for a creation of the Calabar/Ogoja/ Rivers State. He was the Secretary-General of the COR State and Honourable Justice Udo Udoma was the President.\n\nOkoi Arikpo was among the people from the minority ethnic groups who drafted and articulated the position of the minority groups in the country before the Willink Commission was set up by the departing British colonizers to examine the fears of minorities of the Niger Delta. The Willink Commission called attention to the grave dangers in the Niger Delta. \n\nOkoi Arikpo was the first Executive Secretary of the National Universities Commission. Okoi Arikpo was the longest serving Minister for Foreign Affairs (External Affairs) 1967 - 1975. He was the person who was sent to all the Western Capitals and the United States of America to make a strong case why Nigeria should not be allowed to be Balkanized during the heady days of the Civil War. This was after the secessionist Regime had launched a vehement and vociferous propaganda in Western Capital and the United States of a deliberate policy of genocide being waged against the Igbo people of Nigeria which always turned the scale against Nigeria. Okoi Arikpo, a cerebral intellectual of no mean standing, employed his formidable intellectualism and savvy to turn the tide against the Biafra Regime.\n\nIn the Africa continent, Okoi Arikpo's effort to ensure that Biafra does not win more recognition after the dramatic recognition accorded it by France, Cote de Voire, Tanzania and Gabon was commendable. A commentator noted thus\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the OAU Council of Ministers meeting in Kinshasa began on September 4 and lasted till September 11, 1967. The Council meeting normally prepares the agenda for the Heads of State meeting. Okoi Arikpo, Gowon's External Affairs minister had a short but firm mandate for the preparatory meeting: \u2018Under no circumstances allow the Nigerian crisis to appear on the agenda for the OAU Summit.\u2019 To back up his mandate, Arikpo would cite Article II (2) of the OAU Charter, which states that member states should not interfere in the internal affairs of other members unless invited to do so. He also insisted that Nigeria was not keen to invite the mediation of a third party. Gowon also mandated Arikpo to stage a walk-out from the Summit should the matter, by any means, appear on the agenda or be mentioned during the Summit\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe pivotal role that the Ministry of External Affairs was able to play in the foreign policy decision-making system was also due to the sort of leadership that the Commissioner for External Affairs was able to provide. Dr. Okoi Arikpo, who was the Commissioner, was a respected politician and an able administrator. His steady and competent leadership earned respect and support of the career diplomats who dominated the Ministry of External affairs. Arikpo\u2019s ability to work effectively with the career diplomats was also enhanced by his cautious and moderate foreign policy approach shared by the career diplomats. The effective and competent manner in which Arikpo and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that he headed managed Nigeria\u2019s international relations during the Civil War period and the immediate Post- War period showed that Gowon\u2019s Government was correct in allowing the Ministry to have clear primacy in the foreign decision making system. During the Civil War, the Ministry was able to help Nigeria to develop new vital relationships with East European (Military weapons from the Soviet Union and other East European countries) were very important in helping the Nigeria Military extinguish the succession of Biafra) while still maintaining adequate relationships with the traditional friendly countries of the West\u2019\u2019.\n\n==References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=eaAgAQAAIAAJ&q=%22Okoi+Arikpo%22&dq=%22Okoi+Arikpo%22&source=bl&ots=cpYBC2bWsl&sig=61zcgaYKTZXB_2ZKk0Y_iFCVffg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=8TZZUJviGKPu0gGXuYDICw&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBTgU Reference to the \"late Dr. Okoi Arikpo\"]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{succession box | before = [[Yakubu Gowon]] | title = [[Foreign Minister of Nigeria]] | years = 1967 &ndash; 1975 | after = [[Joseph Nanven Garba]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n{{Foreign Ministers of Nigeria}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Okoi, Arikpo}}\n[[Category:1916 births]]\n[[Category:Year of death missing]]\n[[Category:Foreign ministers of Nigeria]]\n\n\n{{Nigeria-politician-stub}}\n", "text_old": "[[File:Okoi Arikpo (1969).jpg|thumb|Okoi Arikpo (1969)]]\n'''Dr. Okoi Arikpo''' (September 20, 1916 \u2013 1995)<ref>[http://www.calitown.com/itm-may-be-named-after-okoi-arikpo/ 'ITM May Be Named After Okoi Arikpo' Website Calitown.com, Dec. 2013]</ref><ref>[http://okoiobono-obla.blogspot.nl/2012/03/re-petition-against-deliberate-omission.html Okoi Obono-Obla  Blogspot, March 2012]</ref> served as [[foreign minister]] of [[Nigeria]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Powered by DMflex WebGen --- www.dmflex.com |url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/the-foreign-affairs-managers/77575/ |title=The Foreign Affairs Managers, Articles |publisher=Thisday Live |date=2010-10-02 |accessdate=2012-09-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617184953/http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/the-foreign-affairs-managers/77575/ |archivedate=2012-06-17 }}</ref>\n\n==Early Life And Political Career==\nDr. Okoi Arikpo was a Chemist, Anthropologist, Lawyer, Politician and Diplomat.

'''Empress''', the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife ([[empress consort]]), mother ([[empress dowager]]), or a woman who rules in her own right ([[empress regnant]]). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher [[honour]] and [[royal and noble ranks|rank]] than [[king]]s. In [[Europe]], the title of Emperor has been used since the [[Middle Ages]], considered in those times equal or almost equal in dignity to that of [[Pope]] due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of the Catholic part of [[Western Europe]]. The [[Emperor of Japan]] is the only currently [[List of current sovereign monarchs|reigning monarch]] whose title is translated into English as \"Emperor\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Uyama |first=Takuei |date=23 October 2019 |title=\u5929\u7687\u306f\u306a\u305c\u300c\u738b\uff08\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\uff09\u300d\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u300c\u7687\u5e1d\uff08\u30a8\u30f3\u30da\u30e9\u30fc\uff09\u300d\u306a\u306e\u304b |trans-title=The Title of the Monarch of Japan: not the \"King\" but the \"Emperor\" |url=https://gendai.ismedia.jp/articles/-/67945?page=2 |language=Japanese |work= |location= |access-date=23 October 2019}}</ref> \n\nBoth emperors and kings are [[monarch]]s, but emperor and empress are considered the higher monarchical titles. Inasmuch as there is a strict definition of emperor, it is that an emperor has no relations implying the superiority of any other ruler and typically rules over more than one nation. Therefore a king might be obliged to pay [[tribute]] to another ruler,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-art-history/south-east-se-asia/china-art/a/forbidden-city|title=The Forbidden City|last=Peng|first=Dr. Ying-chen|date=|website=Khan Academy|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> or be restrained in his actions in some unequal fashion, but an emperor should in theory be completely free of such restraints. However, monarchs heading empires have not always used the title in all contexts\u2014the British sovereign did not assume the title Empress of the [[British Empire]] even during the [[British Raj|incorporation of India]], though she was declared [[Empress of India]].\n\nIn [[Western Europe]], the title of Emperor was used exclusively by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], whose imperial authority was derived from the concept of {{lang|la|[[translatio imperii]]}}, i.e. they claimed succession to the authority of the [[Western Roman Emperor]]s, thus linking themselves to Roman institutions and traditions as part of state ideology. Although initially ruling much of Central Europe and northern Italy, by the 19th century the Emperor exercised little power beyond the German-speaking states.\n\nAlthough technically an elective title, by the late 16th century the imperial title had in practice come to be inherited by the [[Habsburg]] [[Archdukes of Austria]] and following the [[Thirty Years' War]] their control over the states (outside the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], i.e. [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] and various territories outside the empire) had become nearly non-existent. However, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was crowned [[Emperor of the French]] in 1804 and was shortly followed by [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor]], who declared himself [[Emperor of Austria]] in the same year. The position of Holy Roman Emperor nonetheless continued until [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] abdicated that position in 1806. In [[Eastern Europe]], the monarchs of [[Russia]] also used {{lang|la|translatio imperii}} to wield imperial authority as successors to the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. Their status was officially recognised by the Holy Roman Emperor in 1514, although not officially used by the Russian monarchs until 1547. However, the Russian emperors are better known by their Russian-language title of [[Tsar]] even after [[Peter the Great]] adopted the title of [[Emperor of All Russia]] in 1721.\n\nHistorians have liberally used emperor and empire anachronistically and out of its Roman and European context to describe any large state from the past or the present. Such pre-Roman titles as [[Great King]] or [[King of Kings]], used by the Kings of Persia and others, are often considered as the equivalent. Sometimes this reference has even extended to non-monarchically ruled states and their spheres of influence such as the [[Athenian Empire]] of the late 5th century BC, the [[Angevin Empire]] of the [[Plantagenets]] and the [[Soviet Empire|Soviet]] and [[American imperialism|American]] \"empires\" of the [[Cold War]] era. However, such \"empires\" did not need to be headed by an \"emperor\". Empire became identified instead with vast territorial holdings rather than the title of its ruler by the mid-18th century.\n\nFor purposes of protocol, emperors were once given [[Order of precedence|precedence]] over kings in international diplomatic relations, but currently precedence amongst [[heads of state]] who are sovereigns\u2014whether they be kings, queens, emperors, empresses, princes, princesses and to a lesser degree presidents\u2014is determined by the duration of time that each one has been continuously in office. Outside the European context, emperor was the translation given to holders of titles who were accorded the same precedence as European emperors in diplomatic terms. In reciprocity, these rulers might accredit equal titles in their native languages to their European peers. Through centuries of international convention, this has become the dominant rule to identifying an emperor in the modern era.\n\n==Roman tradition==\n\nIn the [[ancient Rome|Roman]] tradition a large variety in the meaning and importance of the imperial form of monarchy developed: in ''intention'' it was always the highest office, but it could as well fall down to a redundant title for nobility that had never been near to the \"Empire\" they were supposed to be reigning. Also the ''name'' of the position split in several branches of Western tradition, see below.\n\nThe importance and meaning of [[coronation]] ceremonies and [[regalia]] also varied within the tradition: for instance [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s could only be crowned emperor by the [[Pope]], which meant the coronation ceremony usually took place in Rome, often several years after these emperors had ascended to the throne (as \"king\") in their home country. The first [[Latin Empire of Constantinople|Latin Emperors of Constantinople]] on the other hand had to be present in the newly conquered capital of their empire, because that was the only place where they could be granted to become emperor.\n\nEarly [[Roman Emperor]]s avoided any type of ceremony or regalia different from what was already usual for republican offices in the [[Roman Republic]]: the most intrusive change had been changing the color of their robe to purple. Later new symbols of worldly and/or spiritual power, like the [[Globus cruciger|orb]], became an essential part of the imperial accessories.\n\nRules for indicating successors also varied: there was a tendency towards ''male'' ''inheritance'' of the supreme office, but as well election by noblemen, as ruling empresses are known (for empires not too strictly under [[salic law]]). Ruling monarchs could additionally steer the succession by adoption, as often occurred in the two first centuries of Imperial Rome. Of course, intrigue, murder and military force could also mingle in for appointing successors; the Roman imperial tradition made no exception to other monarchical traditions in this respect. Probably the epoch best known for this part of the imperial tradition is [[Roman Emperor (Crisis of the Third Century)|Rome's third century]] rule.\n\n==Roman Empire and Byzantine emperors==\n\n===Classical Antiquity===\n{{Main|Roman emperor|Imperator}}\n[[File:Rimini083.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A statue of the dictator [[Julius Caesar]].]]\n\nWhen [[Roman Republic|Republican Rome]] turned into a ''de facto'' [[monarchy]] in the second half of the 1st century BC, at first there was no name for the title of the new type of monarch.  Ancient Romans abhorred the name [[King of Rome|Rex (\"king\")]], and it was critical to the political order to maintain the forms and pretenses of republican rule.  [[Julius Caesar]] had been [[Roman dictator|Dictator]], an acknowledged and traditional office in Republican Rome.  Caesar was not the first to hold it, but following his assassination the term was abhorred in Rome{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}.\n\n[[File:Statue-Augustus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Augustus]], the first emperor of the Roman Empire.]]\n[[Augustus]], considered the first [[Roman emperor]], established his hegemony by collecting on himself offices, titles, and honours of Republican Rome that had traditionally been distributed to different people, concentrating what had been distributed power in one man.  One of these offices was ''[[princeps senatus]]'', (\"first man of the Senate\") and became changed into Augustus' chief honorific, ''[[Princeps|princeps civitatis]]'' (\"first citizen\") from which the modern English word and title [[prince]] is descended.  The first period of the [[Roman Empire]], from 27 BC \u2013 AD 284, is called the ''[[principate]]'' for this reason.  However, it was the informal descriptive of ''[[Imperator]]'' (\"commander\") that became the title increasingly favored by his successors.  Previously bestowed on high officials and military commanders who had ''[[imperium]]'', Augustus reserved it exclusively to himself as the ultimate holder of all ''imperium''.  (''Imperium'' is Latin for the authority to command, one of a various types of authority delineated in Roman political thought.)\n\nBeginning with Augustus, ''Imperator'' appeared in the title of all Roman monarchs through the extinction of the Empire in 1453.  After the reign of Augustus' immediate successor [[Tiberius]], being proclaimed ''imperator'' was transformed into the act of accession to the [[head of state]]. Other honorifics used by the Roman Emperors have also come to be synonyms for Emperor:\n\n*'''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]''' (as, for example, in [[Suetonius]]' ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Twelve Caesars]]''). This tradition continued in many languages: in German it became \"[[Kaiser]]\"; in certain [[Slavic languages]] it became \"[[Tsar]]\"; in Hungarian it became \"[[Cs\u00e1sz\u00e1r]]\", and several more variants. The name derived from [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[cognomen]] \"Caesar\": this cognomen was adopted by all Roman emperors, exclusively by the ruling monarch after the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] had died out. In this tradition Julius Caesar is sometimes described as the first Caesar/emperor (following Suetonius). This is one of the most enduring titles, Caesar and its transliterations appeared in every year from the time of [[Caesar Augustus]] to Tsar [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Symeon II of Bulgaria]]'s removal from the throne in 1946.\n*'''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]''' was the [[honorific]] first bestowed on Emperor Augustus: after him all Roman emperors added it to their name. Although it had a high symbolical value, something like \"elevated\" or \"sublime\", it was generally not used to indicate the office of ''Emperor'' itself. Exceptions include the title of the ''[[Augustan History]]'', a semi-historical collection of Emperors' biographies of the 2nd and 3rd century. Augustus had (by his last will) granted the feminine form of this honorific ([[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]) to his wife. Since there was no \"title\" of Empress(-consort) whatsoever, women of the reigning dynasty sought to be granted this honorific, as the highest attainable goal. Few were however granted the title, and certainly not as a rule all wives of reigning Emperors.\n*'''[[Imperator]]''' (as, for example, in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''). In the [[Roman Republic]] Imperator meant \"(military) commander\". In the late Republic, as in the early years of the new monarchy, ''Imperator'' was a title granted to Roman generals by their troops and the [[Roman Senate]] after a great victory, roughly comparable to [[field marshal]] (head or commander of the entire army). For example, in AD 15 [[Germanicus]] was proclaimed ''Imperator'' during the reign of his adoptive father [[Tiberius]]. Soon thereafter \"Imperator\" became however a title reserved exclusively for the ruling monarch. This led to \"Emperor\" in English and, among other examples, \"Empereur\" in French and \"Mbreti\" in Albanian. The Latin feminine form [[Imperatrix]] only developed after \"Imperator\" had taken on the connotation of \"Emperor\".\n*'''[[Autokrator]]''' (\u0391\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03c1) or '''[[basileus#Romans and Byzantines|Basileus]]''' (\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2): although the Greeks used equivalents of \"Caesar\" (\u039a\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1, ''Kaisar'') and \"Augustus\" (in two forms: transliterated as {{lang|grc|\u0391\u1f54\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2}}, ''Augoustos'' or translated as {{lang|grc|\u03a3\u03b5\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2}}, ''[[Sebastos]]'') these were rather used as part of the name of the Emperor than as an indication of the office. Instead of developing a new name for the new type of monarchy, they used {{lang|grc|\u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03c1}} (''autokrat\u014dr'', only partly overlapping with the modern understanding of \"[[Autocracy|autocrat]]\") or {{lang|grc|\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2}} (''[[basileus]]'', until then the usual name for \"[[Monarch|sovereign]]\"). ''Autokrat\u014dr'' was essentially used as a translation of the Latin ''Imperator'' in Greek-speaking part of the Roman Empire, but also here there is only partial overlap between the meaning of the original Greek and Latin concepts. For the Greeks ''Autokrat\u014dr'' was not a military title, and was closer to the Latin ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]'' concept (\"the one with unlimited power\"), before it came to mean Emperor. ''Basileus'' appears not to have been used exclusively in the meaning of \"emperor\" (and specifically, the Roman/Byzantine emperor) before the 7th century, although it was a standard informal designation of the Emperor in the Greek-speaking East.\n\nAfter the turbulent [[Year of the four emperors]] in 69, the [[Flavian Dynasty]] reigned for three decades. The succeeding [[Nervan-Antonian Dynasty]], ruling for most of the 2nd century, stabilised the Empire. This epoch became known as the era of the ''[[Nerva\u2013Antonine dynasty#Five Good Emperors|Five Good Emperors]]'', and was followed by the short-lived [[Severan Dynasty]].\n\nDuring the [[Crisis of the 3rd century]], [[Barracks Emperor]]s succeeded one another at short intervals. Three short lived secessionist attempts had their own emperors: the [[Gallic Empire]], the [[Britannic Empire]], and the [[Palmyrene Empire]] though the latter used ''rex'' more regularly.\n\nThe [[Principate]] (27 BC \u2013 284 AD) period was succeeded by what is known as the [[Dominate]] (284 AD \u2013 527 AD), during which Emperor [[Diocletian]] tried to put the Empire on a more formal footing.  Diocletian sought to address the challenges of the Empire's now vast geography and the instability caused by the informality of succession by the creation of co-emperors and junior emperors.  At one point, there were as many as five sharers of the ''imperium'' (see: [[Tetrarchy]]).  In 325 AD [[Constantine I]] defeated his rivals and restored single emperor rule, but following his death the empire was divided among his sons. For a time the concept was of one empire ruled by multiple emperors with varying territory under their control, however following the death of [[Theodosius I]] the rule was divided between his two sons and increasingly became separate entities.  The areas administered from Rome are referred to by historians the [[Western Roman Empire]] and those under the immediate authority of Constantinople called the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] or (after the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] in 636 AD) the [[Byzantine Empire|Later Roman or Byzantine Empire]].  The subdivisions and co-emperor system were formally abolished by [[Zeno (emperor)|Emperor Zeno]] in 480 AD following the death of [[Julius Nepos]] last Western Emperor and the ascension of [[Odoacer]] as the ''de facto'' King of Italy in 476 AD.\n\n===Byzantine period===\n{{Main|Byzantine Emperor}}\n\n====Before the 4th Crusade====\n[[File:Sanvitale03.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Under [[Justinian I]], reigning in the 6th century, parts of Italy were for a few decades (re)conquered from the [[Ostrogoths]]: thus, this famous [[mosaic]], featuring the Byzantine emperor in the center, can be admired at [[Ravenna]].]]\n\nHistorians generally refer to the continuing Roman Empire in the east as the [[Byzantine Empire]] after [[Byzantium]], the original name of the town that [[Constantine I]] would elevate to the Imperial capital as [[New Rome]] in AD 330. (The city is more commonly called [[Constantinople]] and is today named [[Istanbul]]). Although the empire was again subdivided and a co-emperor sent to Italy at the end of the fourth century, the office became unitary again only 95 years later at the request of the [[Roman Senate]] and following the death of [[Julius Nepos]], last Western Emperor. This change was a recognition of the reality that little remained of Imperial authority in the areas that had been the Western Empire, with even Rome and Italy itself now ruled by the essentially autonomous [[Odoacer]].\n\nThese Later Roman \"Byzantine\" Emperors completed the transition from the idea of the Emperor as a semi-republican official to the Emperor as an [[absolute monarch]]. Of particular note was the translation of the Latin ''Imperator'' into the Greek ''[[Basileus]]'', after Emperor [[Heraclius]] changed the official language of the empire from Latin to Greek in AD 620. Basileus, a title which had long been used for [[Alexander the Great]] was already in common usage as the Greek word for the Roman emperor, but its definition and sense was \"King\" in Greek, essentially equivalent with the Latin ''Rex''. Byzantine period emperors also used the Greek word \"autokrator\", meaning \"one who rules himself\", or \"monarch\", which was traditionally used by Greek writers to translate the Latin ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]''. Essentially, the Greek language did not incorporate the nuances of the Ancient Roman concepts that distinguished ''imperium'' from other forms of political power.\n\nIn general usage, the Byzantine imperial title evolved from simply \"emperor\" (''basileus''), to \"emperor of the Romans\" (''basileus t\u014dn R\u014dmai\u014dn'') in the 9th century, to \"emperor and autocrat of the Romans\" (''basileus kai autokrat\u014dr t\u014dn R\u014dmai\u014dn'') in the 10th.<ref>[[George Alexandrovi\u010d Ostrogorsky|George Ostrogorsky]], \"Avtokrator i samodr\u017eac\", ''Glas Srpske kraljevske akadamije'' CLXIV, Drugi razdred 84 (1935), 95\u2013187</ref> In fact, none of these (and other) additional epithets and titles had ever been completely discarded.\n\nOne important distinction between the post Constantine I (reigned AD 306\u2013337) emperors and their pagan predecessors was [[cesaropapism]], the assertion that the Emperor (or other head of state) is also the head of the Church. Although this principle was held by all emperors after Constantine, it met with increasing resistance and ultimately rejection by bishops in the west after the effective end of Imperial power there. This concept became a key element of the meaning of \"emperor\" in the Byzantine and Orthodox east, but went out of favor in the west with the rise of [[Roman Catholicism]].\n\nThe Byzantine Empire also produced three women who effectively governed the state: the Empress [[Irene (empress)|Irene]] and the Empresses [[Zoe Porphyrogenita|Zoe]] and [[Theodora (11th century)|Theodora]].\n\n====Latin emperors====\nIn 1204 Constantinople fell to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] and the [[Franks]] in the [[Fourth Crusade]].  Following the tragedy of the horrific [[Siege of Constantinople|sacking]] of the city, the conquerors declared a new \"Empire of Romania\", known to historians as the [[Latin Empire of Constantinople]], installing [[Baldwin IX]], [[Count of Flanders]], as Emperor. However, Byzantine resistance to the new empire meant that it was in constant struggle to establish itself.  Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos succeeded in recapturing Constantinople in 1261.  The [[Principality of Achaea]], a vassal state the empire had created in [[Morea]] (Greece) intermittently continued to recognize the authority of the crusader emperors for another half century.  Pretenders to the title continued among the European nobility until circa 1383.\n\n====After the 4th Crusade====\nWith Constantinople occupied, claimants to the imperial succession styled themselves as emperor in the chief centers of resistance:  The [[Laskaris|Laskarid]] dynasty in the [[Empire of Nicaea]], the [[Komnenos|Komnenid]] dynasty in the [[Empire of Trebizond]] and the [[Doukas|Doukid]] dynasty in the [[Despotate of Epirus]].  In 1248, Epirus recognized the Nicaean Emperors, who subsequently recaptured Constantinople in 1261.  The Trapezuntine emperor formally submitted in Constantinople in 1281,<ref>Nicol, Donald MacGillivray, ''The Last Centuries of Byzantium'', second edition (Cambridge: University Press, 1993), p. 74</ref> but frequently flouted convention by styling themselves emperor back in Trebizond thereafter.\n\n== Ottoman Empire ==\n[[File:Suleiman Agostino.JPG|thumb|190px|[[Agostino Veneziano]]'s [[engraving]] of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] emperor Suleiman the Magnificent wearing his [[S\u00fcleyman the Magnificent's Venetian Helmet|Venetian Helmet]].{{NoteTag|Agostino never saw the Sultan, but probably did see and sketch the helmet in Venice.}} Note the four tiers on the helmet, symbolizing his imperial power, and excelling the three-tiered [[papal tiara]].<ref>The Metropolitan Museum of Art. 1968. \"Turquerie\" ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', New Series 26 (5): 229.</ref> This tiara was made for 115,000 [[ducats]] and offered to Suleiman by the French ambassador [[Antonio Rincon]] in 1532.<ref>Garnier, p.&nbsp;52.</ref> This was a most atypical piece of headgear for a Turkish sultan, which he probably never normally wore, but which he placed beside him when receiving visitors, especially ambassadors.

These included:{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} [[Sultan]], [[Khan (title)|Khan]], Sovereign of the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Imperial House of Osman]], [[Sultan of Sultans]], [[Khan of Khans]], [[Amir al-Mu'minin|Commander of the Faithful]] and [[Caliph|Successor of the Prophet of the Lord of the Universe]], Protector of the Holy Cities of [[Mecca]], [[Medina]] and [[Jerusalem]], Emperor of The Three Cities of [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], [[Edirne|Adrianopole]] and [[Bursa]] as well as many other cities and countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nobility of the World Volume VIII- Turkey|url=http://www.almanachdegotha.org/id244.html|website=Almanch De Saxe Gotha|accessdate=10 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Ottoman capture of Constantinople in 1453, the Ottoman sultans began to style themselves '''Kaysar-i Rum''' (Emperor of the Romans) as they asserted themselves to be the heirs to the Roman Empire by right of conquest. The title was of such importance to them that it led them to eliminate the various Byzantine successor states \u2014 and therefore rival claimants \u2014 over the next eight years. Though the term \"emperor\" was rarely used by Westerners of the Ottoman sultan, it was generally accepted by Westerners that he had imperial status.\n\n==Holy Roman Empire==\n{{Main|Holy Roman Emperor}}\nThe ''Emperor'' of the Romans' title was a reflection of the ''[[translatio imperii]]'' (''transfer of rule'') principle that regarded the Holy Roman Emperors as the inheritors of the title of Emperor of the [[Western Roman Empire]], despite the continued existence of the [[Byzantine Empire|Roman Empire]] in the east, hence the [[problem of two emperors]].\n\nFrom the time of [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto the Great]] onward, much of the former [[Carolingian]] kingdom of [[Eastern Francia]] became the Holy Roman Empire. The  [[prince-elector]]s elected one of their peers as [[King of the Romans]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|King of Italy]] before being crowned by the [[Pope]]. The Emperor could also pursue the election of his heir (usually a son) as King, who would then succeed him after his death. This junior King then bore the title of Roman King (King of the Romans). Although technically already ruling, after the election he would be crowned as emperor by the Pope. The last emperor to be crowned by the pope was [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]; all emperors after him were technically ''emperors-elect'', but were universally referred to as ''Emperor''.\n\n==Austrian Empire==\n{{Main|Emperor of Austria}}\nThe first Austrian Emperor was the last Holy Roman Emperor Francis II. In the face of aggressions by [[Napoleon]], Francis feared for the future of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. He wished to maintain his and his family's Imperial status in the event that the Holy Roman Empire should be dissolved, as it indeed was in 1806 when an Austrian-led army suffered a humiliating defeat at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]]. After which, the victorious Napoleon proceeded to dismantle the old ''Reich'' by severing a good portion from the empire and turning it into a separate [[Confederation of the Rhine]].  With the size of his imperial realm significantly reduced, Francis II, ''Holy Roman Emperor'' became Francis I, ''Emperor of Austria''. The new imperial title may have sounded less prestigious than the old one, but Francis' [[dynasty]] continued to rule from Austria and a Habsburg monarch was still an emperor (''Kaiser''), and not just merely a king (''K\u00f6nig''), in name.\n\nThe title lasted just a little over one century until 1918, but it was never clear what territory constituted the \"[[Austrian Empire|Empire of Austria]]\".  When Francis took the title in 1804, the Habsburg lands as a whole were dubbed the ''Kaisertum \u00d6sterreich''.  ''Kaisertum'' might literally be translated as \"emperordom\" (on analogy with \"kingdom\") or \"emperor-ship\"; the term denotes specifically \"the territory ruled by an emperor\", and is thus somewhat more general than [[Reich]], which in 1804 carried connotations of universal rule.  Austria proper (as opposed to the complex of Habsburg lands as a whole) had been an Archduchy since the 15th century, and most of the other territories of the Empire had their own institutions and territorial history, although there were some attempts at centralization, especially during the reign of Marie Therese and her son Joseph II and then finalized in the early 19th century.  When Hungary was given self-government in 1867, the non-Hungarian portions were called the Empire of Austria and were officially known as the \"Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Council]] (''Reichsrat'')\".  The title of Emperor of Austria and the associated Empire were both abolished at the end of the First World War in 1918, when [[German Austria]] became a [[republic]] and the other kingdoms and lands represented in the Imperial Council established their independence or adhesion to other states.\n\n==Emperors of Europe==\n[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]'s close cultural and political interaction with its Balkan neighbors [[Bulgaria]] and [[Serbia]], and with Russia (Kievan Rus', then Muscovy) led to the adoption of Byzantine imperial traditions in all of these countries.\n\n===Bulgaria===\nIn 913, [[Simeon I of Bulgaria]] was crowned Emperor ([[Tsar]]) by the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] and Imperial regent [[Nicholas Mystikos]] outside the Byzantine capital. In its final simplified form, the title read \"Emperor and Autocrat of all Bulgarians and Romans\" (''Tsar i samodarzhets na vsichki balgari i gartsi'' in the modern vernacular). The Roman component in the Bulgarian imperial title indicated both rulership over Greek speakers and the derivation of the imperial tradition from the Romans, however this component was never recognised by the Byzantine court.\n\nByzantine recognition of Simeon's imperial title was revoked by the succeeding Byzantine government. The decade 914\u2013924 was spent in destructive warfare between Byzantium and Bulgaria over this and other matters of conflict. The Bulgarian monarch, who had further irritated his Byzantine counterpart by claiming the title \"Emperor of the Romans\" (''basileus t\u014dn R\u014dmai\u014dn''), was eventually recognized, as \"Emperor of the Bulgarians\" (''basileus t\u014dn Boulgar\u014dn'') by the Byzantine Emperor [[Romanus I|Romanos I Lakapenos]] in 924. Byzantine recognition of the imperial dignity of the Bulgarian monarch and the patriarchal dignity of the [[Patriarch of All Bulgaria|Bulgarian patriarch]] was again confirmed at the conclusion of permanent peace and a Bulgarian-Byzantine dynastic marriage in 927. In the meantime, the Bulgarian imperial title may have been also confirmed by the [[pope]].  The Bulgarian imperial title \"tsar\" was adopted by all Bulgarian monarchs up to the fall of Bulgaria under Ottoman rule. 14th-century Bulgarian literary compositions clearly denote the Bulgarian capital ([[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]]) as a successor of Rome and [[Constantinople]], in effect, the \"Third Rome\".\n\nAfter Bulgaria obtained full independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1908, its monarch, who was previously styled ''Knyaz'', [prince], took the traditional title of ''Tsar'' [king] and was recognized internationally as such.{{by whom|date=November 2016}}\n\n===France===\nThe kings of the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'' and the [[July Monarchy]] used the title ''Empereur de France'' in diplomatic correspondence and treaties with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] emperor from at least 1673 onwards. The Ottomans insisted on this elevated style while refusing to recognize the Holy Roman Emperors or the Russian tsars because of their rival claims of the [[translatio imperii|Roman crown]]. In short, it was an indirect insult by the Ottomans to the HRE and the Russians. The French kings also used it for [[Morocco]] (1682) and [[Persia]] (1715).\n\n====First French Empire====\n{{See also|First French Empire}}\n[[File:Jacques-Louis David - The Coronation of Napoleon (1805-1807).jpg|thumb|300px|One of the most famous Imperial coronation ceremonies was that of Napoleon, crowning himself Emperor in the presence of [[Pope Pius VII]] (who had blessed the [[regalia]]), at the [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris]].<br>The painting by [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] commemorating the event is equally famous: the gothic cathedral restyled ''[[Empire (style)|style Empire]]'', supervised by the [[Letizia Ramolino|mother of the Emperor]] on the balcony (a fictional addition, while she had not been present at the ceremony), the pope positioned near the altar, Napoleon proceeds to crown his then wife, [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais]] as Empress.]]\n[[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]], who was already First Consul of the French Republic (''Premier Consul de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise'') for life, declared himself '''[[Emperor of the French]]''' (''Empereur des Fran\u00e7ais'') on 18 May 1804, thus creating the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] (''Empire Fran\u00e7ais'').\n\nNapoleon relinquished the title of Emperor of the French on 6 April and again on 11 April 1814.\nNapoleon's infant son, [[Napoleon II of France|Napoleon II]], was recognized by the Council of Peers, as Emperor from the moment of his father's abdication, and therefore reigned (as opposed to ruled) as Emperor for fifteen days, 22 June to 7 July 1815.\n\n====Elba====\nSince 3 May 1814, the Sovereign Principality of [[Elba]] was created a miniature non-hereditary Monarchy under the exiled French Emperor Napoleon I. Napoleon I was allowed, by the treaty of Fontainebleau (27 April), to enjoy, for life, the imperial title. The islands were ''not'' restyled an empire.\n\nOn 26 February 1815, Napoleon abandoned Elba for France, reviving the French Empire for a [[Hundred Days]]; the Allies declared an end to Napoleon's sovereignty over Elba on 25 March 1815, and on 31 March 1815 Elba was ceded to the restored [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] by the Congress of Vienna. After his final defeat, Napoleon was treated as a general by the British authorities during his second exile to Atlantic Isle of [[St. Helena]]. His title was a matter of dispute with the governor of St Helena, who insisted on addressing him as \"General Bonaparte\", despite the \"historical reality that he had been an emperor\" and therefore retained the title.<ref>''Napoleon'', Vincent Cronin, p419, HarperCollins, 1994.</ref><ref>''Napoleon'', Frank McLynn, p644, Pimlico 1998</ref><ref>''Le M\u00e9morial de Sainte H\u00e9l\u00e8ne'', Emmanuel De Las Cases, Tome III, page101, published by Jean De Bonnot, Libraire \u00e0 l'enseigne du canon, 1969</ref>\n\n====Second French Empire====\n{{See also|Second French Empire}}\nNapoleon I's nephew, [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]], resurrected the title of emperor on 2 December 1852, after establishing the [[Second French Empire]] in a presidential [[coup]], subsequently approved by a plebiscite. His reign was marked by large scale public works, the development of social policy, and the extension of France's influence throughout the world. During his reign, he also set about creating the [[Second Mexican Empire]] (headed by his choice of [[Maximilian I of Mexico]], a member of the [[House of Habsburg]]), to regain France's hold in the Americas and to achieve greatness for the 'Latin' race.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S1O6HwzwQs4C&pg=PA88 |title=Race and nation in modern Latin America |first1=Nancy P. |last1=Appelbaum |first2=Anne S. |last2=Macpherson |first3=Karin Alejandra |last3=Rosemblatt |publisher=UNC Press Books |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-8078-5441-9 |page=88}}</ref> Napoleon III was deposed on 4 September 1870, after France's defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]].

It was associated with the [[List of Leonese monarchs|Leonese monarchy]] perhaps as far back as [[Alfonso the Great]] (''r.'' 866\u2013910). The last two kings of its [[Astur-Leonese dynasty]] were called emperors in a contemporary source.\n\nKing [[Sancho III of Navarre]] conquered Leon in 1034 and began using it. His son, [[Ferdinand I of Castile]] also took the title in 1039. Ferdinand's son, [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile]] took the title in 1077. It then passed to his son-in-law, [[Alfonso I of Aragon]] in 1109. His stepson and Alfonso VI's grandson, [[Alfonso VII of Castile|Alfonso VII]] was the only one who actually had an imperial coronation in 1135.\n\nThe title was not exactly hereditary but self-proclaimed by those who had, wholly or partially, united the Christian northern part of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], often at the expense of killing rival siblings. The popes and Holy Roman emperors protested at the usage of the imperial title as a usurpation of leadership in western Christendom. After Alfonso VII's death in 1157, the title was abandoned, and the kings who used it are not commonly mentioned as having been \"emperors\", in Spanish or other historiography.\n\nAfter the fall of the Byzantine Empire, the legitimate heir to the throne, [[Andreas Palaiologos]], willed away his claim to [[Ferdinand and Isabella]] in 1503.\n\n====Portugal====\n[[File:Jean-Baptiste Debret - Retrato de Dom Jo\u00e3o VI (MNBA).jpg|thumb|[[John VI of Portugal|John VI]], [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King of Portugal and the Algarves]], [[Emperor of Brazil]].]]\nAfter the independence and proclamation of the [[Empire of Brazil]] from the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|Kingdom of Portugal]] by [[Pedro I of Brazil|Prince Pedro]], who became Emperor, in 1822, his father, King [[John VI of Portugal]] briefly held the honorific style of Titular [[Emperor of Brazil]] and the treatment of ''His Imperial and Royal Majesty'' under the 1825 [[Treaty of Rio de Janeiro (1825)|Treaty of Rio de Janeiro]], by which Portugal recognized the independence of Brazil. The style of Titular Emperor was a life title, and became extinct upon the holder's demise. John VI held the imperial title for a few months only, from the ratification of the Treaty in November 1825 until his death in March 1826. During those months, however, as John's imperial title was purely honorific while his son, Pedro I, remained the sole monarch of the Brazilian Empire.\n\n===Great Britain===\n{{Main|British Emperor}}\nIn the late 3rd century, by the end of the epoch of the ''barracks emperors'' in Rome, there were two [[Carausian Revolt|Britannic Emperors]], reigning for about a decade. After the [[end of Roman rule in Britain]], the Imperator [[Cunedda]] forged the [[Kingdom of Gwynedd]] in northern Wales, but all his successors were titled kings and princes.\n\n====England====\nThere was no consistent title for the king of England before 1066, and monarchs chose to style themselves as they pleased. Imperial titles were used inconsistently, beginning with [[Athelstan]] in 930 and ended with the [[Norman conquest of England]]. [[Empress Matilda]] (1102\u20131167) is the only English monarch commonly referred to as \"emperor\" or \"empress\", but she acquired her title through her marriage to [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\nDuring the rule of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] the [[Statute in Restraint of Appeals]] declared that 'this realm of England is an Empire...governed by one Supreme Head and King having the dignity and royal estate of the [[imperial Crown]] of the same'. This was in the context of the divorce of [[Catherine of Aragon]] and the [[English Reformation]], to emphasize that England had never accepted the quasi-imperial claims of the papacy.  Hence England and, by extension its modern successor state, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], is according to English law an Empire ruled by a King endowed with the imperial dignity. However, this has not led to the creation of the ''title'' of Emperor in England, nor in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], nor in the United Kingdom.\n\n====United Kingdom====\n[[File:George V of the united Kingdom.jpg|thumb|right|[[George V]], [[King of the United Kingdom]] and the [[British Dominions]], [[Emperor of India]].]]\nIn 1801, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] rejected the title of Emperor when offered. The only period when British monarchs held the title of ''Emperor'' in a dynastic succession started when the title [[Emperor of India|Empress of India]] was created for [[Queen Victoria]]. The government led by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]], conferred the additional title upon her by an Act of Parliament, reputedly to assuage the monarch's irritation at being, as a mere Queen, notionally inferior to her own daughter ([[Victoria, Princess Royal|Princess Victoria]], who was the wife of the [[Frederick III, German Emperor|reigning German Emperor]]); the Indian Imperial designation was also formally justified as the expression of Britain succeeding the former [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]] as [[suzerain]] over hundreds of [[princely state]]s. The [[Indian Independence Act 1947]] provided for the abolition of the use of the title \"[[Emperor of India]]\" by the [[British monarch]], but this was not executed by [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] until a [[royal proclamation]] on 22 June 1948. Despite this, George VI continued as king of India until 1950 and as king of Pakistan until his death in 1952.\n\nThe last Empress of India was George VI's wife, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]].\n\n===German Empire===\n{{Main|German Empire}}\n[[File:Kohner - Kaiser Wilhelm II.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], [[German Emperor]] and the [[King of Prussia]].]]\nUnder the guise of idealism giving way to realism, German nationalism rapidly shifted from its liberal and democratic character in 1848 to [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] prime minister [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s authoritarian ''[[Realpolitik]]''. Bismarck wanted to unify the rival German states to achieve his aim of a conservative, Prussian-dominated Germany. Three wars led to military successes and helped to convince German people to do this: the [[Second war of Schleswig]] against Denmark in 1864, the [[Austro-Prussian War]] against [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] in 1866, and the [[Franco-Prussian War]] against the [[Second French Empire]] in 1870\u201371. During the [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|Siege of Paris]] in 1871, the [[North German Confederation]], supported by its allies from [[southern Germany]], formed the [[German Empire]] with the proclamation of the Prussian king [[Wilhelm I of Germany|Wilhelm I]] as German Emperor in the Hall of Mirrors at the [[Palace of Versailles]], to the humiliation of the French, who ceased to resist only days later.\n\nAfter his death he was succeeded by his son [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick III]] who was only emperor for 99 days. In the same year his son [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] became the third emperor within a year. He was the last German emperor. After the empire's defeat in World War I the empire, called in German ''Reich'', had a president as head of state instead of an emperor. The use of the word ''Reich'' was abandoned after the Second World War.\n\n===Russia===\n[[File:Profile portrait of Catherine II by Fedor Rokotov (1763, Tretyakov gallery).jpg|thumb|Empress of Russia [[Catherine the Great]]]]\nIn 1472, the niece of the last Byzantine emperor, [[Sophia Paleologue|Sophia Palaiologina]], married [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]], grand prince of Moscow, who began championing the idea of Russia being the successor to the Byzantine Empire. This idea was represented more emphatically in the composition the monk Filofej addressed to their son [[Vasili III of Russia|Vasili III]]. After ending Muscovy's dependence on its [[Mongol]] overlords in 1480, Ivan III began the usage of the titles [[Tsar]] and Autocrat (''samoderzhets''). His insistence on recognition as such by the emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] since 1489 resulted in the granting of this recognition in 1514 by Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] to Vasili III. His son [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV]] emphatically crowned himself [[Tsar of Russia]] on 16 January 1547. The word \"Tsar\" derives from Latin Caesar, but this title was used in Russia as equivalent to \"King\"; the error occurred when medieval Russian clerics referred to the biblical Jewish kings with the same title that was used to designate Roman and Byzantine rulers \u2014 \"Caesar\".\n\nOn 31 October 1721, [[Peter the Great|Peter I]] was proclaimed Emperor by the Senate. The title used was Latin \"''Imperator''\", which is a westernizing form equivalent to the traditional Slavic title \"''Tsar''\". He based his claim partially upon a letter discovered in 1717 written in 1514 from Maximilian I to Vasili III, in which the Holy Roman Emperor used the term in referring to Vasili.\n\nA formal address to the ruling Russian monarch adopted thereafter was 'Your Imperial Majesty'. The crown prince was addressed as 'Your Imperial Highness'.\n\nThe title has not been used in Russia since the abdication of Emperor [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] on 15 March 1917.\n\n[[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] produced four reigning Empresses, all in the eighteenth century.\n\n===Serbia===\n{{main|Emperor of Serbia}}\nIn 1345, the Serbian King [[Stefan Dusan|Stefan Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an]] proclaimed himself Emperor ([[Tsar]]) and was crowned as such at [[Skopje]] on [[Easter]] 1346 by the newly created [[Serbian Patriarch]], and by the Patriarch of Bulgaria and the autocephalous Archbishop of Ohrid. His imperial title was recognized by Bulgaria and various other neighbors and trading partners but not by the Byzantine Empire. In its final simplified form, the Serbian imperial title read \"Emperor of Serbs and Greeks\" (''\u0446\u0430\u0440 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0430 \u0438 \u0413\u0440\u043a\u0430'' in modern Serbian). It was only employed by Stefan Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an and his son Stefan Uro\u0161 V in Serbia (until his death in 1371), after which it became extinct. A half-brother of Du\u0161an, [[Simeon Uro\u0161]], and then his son [[Jovan Uro\u0161]], claimed the same title, until the latter's abdication in 1373, while ruling as dynasts in [[Thessaly]]. The \"Greek\" component in the Serbian imperial title indicates both rulership over Greeks and the derivation of the imperial tradition from the Romans.\n\n==Emperors in the Americas==\n\n===Pre-Columbian traditions===\nThe Aztec and Inca traditions are unrelated to one another. Both were conquered under the reign of King [[Charles I of Spain]] who was simultaneously emperor-elect of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] during the fall of the Aztecs and fully emperor during the fall of the Incas. Incidentally by being king of Spain, he was also Roman (Byzantine) emperor in pretence through [[Andreas Palaiologos]]. The translations of their titles were provided by the Spanish.\n\n====Aztec Empire====\nThe only [[pre-Columbian]] North American rulers to be commonly called emperors were the ''[[Hueyi Tlatoani]]'' of the [[Aztec Empire]] (1375\u20131521). It was an [[elected monarchy]] chosen by the elite. In the Aztec Empire, there were three emperors: Those of [[Tenochtitlan]], [[Tlacopan]] and [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]]. The Emperors of Tenochtitlan and Texcoco were nominally equals, each receiving two-fifths of tribute from the vassal kingdoms, whereas the Emperor of Tlacopan was a junior member and only received one-fifth of the tribute, due to the fact that Tlacopan was a newcomer to the alliance. Despite the nominal equality, Tenochtitlan eventually assumed a [[de facto]] dominant role in the Empire, to the point that even the Emperors of Tlacopan and Texcoco would acknowledge Tenochtitlan's effective supremacy. Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] slew Emperor [[Cuauht\u00e9moc]] and installed puppet rulers who became vassals for Spain.\n\n====Inca Empire====\nThe only pre-Columbian South American rulers to be commonly called emperors were the ''[[Sapa Inca]]'' of the [[Inca Empire]] (1438\u20131533). Spanish conquistador [[Francisco Pizarro]], conquered the Inca for Spain, killed Emperor [[Atahualpa]], and installed puppets as well. Atahualpa may actually be considered a usurper as he had achieved power by [[Inca Civil War|killing his half-brother]] and he did not perform the required coronation with the imperial crown ''[[mascaipacha]]'' by the ''Huillaq Uma'' (high priest).\n\n===Post-Columbian Americas===\n\n====Brazil====\n[[File:Pedro Am\u00e9rico - D. Pedro II na abertura da Assembl\u00e9ia Geral.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], [[List of monarchs of Brazil|Emperor of Brazil]] in [[regalia]] at the opening of the General Assembly (oil painting by [[Pedro Am\u00e9rico]]).]]\nWhen [[Napoleon|Napoleon I]] ordered the invasion of Portugal in 1807 because it refused to join the [[Continental System]], the Portuguese [[House of Braganza|Braganzas]] moved their capital to [[Rio de Janeiro]] to avoid the fate of the [[Spanish Bourbons]] (Napoleon I arrested them and made his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] king). When the French general [[Jean-Andoche Junot]] arrived in [[Lisbon]], the Portuguese fleet had already left with all the local elite.\n\nIn 1808, under a British naval escort, the fleet arrived in Brazil. Later, in 1815, the Portuguese Prince Regent (since 1816 [[John VI of Portugal|King Jo\u00e3o VI]]) proclaimed the ''[[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]]'', as a union of three kingdoms, lifting Brazil from its colonial status.\n\nAfter the fall of Napoleon I and the [[liberal Wars|Liberal revolution]] in Portugal, the Portuguese royal family returned to Europe (1821). Prince Pedro of Braganza (King Jo\u00e3o's older son) stayed in South America acting as regent of the local kingdom, but, two years later in 1822, he proclaimed himself [[Peter I of Brazil|Pedro I]], first [[Emperor of Brazil]]. He did, however, recognize his father, Jo\u00e3o VI, as ''Titular Emperor of Brazil'' \u2014a purely honorific title\u2014until Jo\u00e3o VI's death in 1826.\n\nThe empire came to an end in 1889, with the overthrow of [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Pedro II]] (Pedro I's son and successor), when the Brazilian republic was proclaimed.\n\n====Haiti====\n[[Haiti]] was declared an empire by its ruler, [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], who made himself Jacques I, on 20 May 1805. He was assassinated the next year. Haiti again became an empire from 1849 to 1859 under [[Faustin Soulouque]].\n\n====Mexico====\n[[File:X-Large Portrait of Maximiliano.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Maximilian I of Mexico]], by [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]]]]\n\nIn Mexico, the [[First Mexican Empire]] was the first of two empires created. After the [[Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire|declaration of independence]] on 15 September 1821, it was the intention of the Mexican parliament to establish a commonwealth whereby the [[King]] of Spain, [[Fernando VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]], would also be [[Emperor of Mexico]], but in which both countries were to be governed by separate laws and with their own legislative offices. Should the king refuse the position, the law provided for a member of the [[House of Bourbon]] to accede to the Mexican throne.\n\nFerdinand VII, however, did not recognize the independence and said that Spain would not allow any other European prince to take the throne of Mexico. By request of Parliament, the president of the regency [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] was proclaimed emperor of Mexico on 12 July 1822 as [[Agust\u00edn I]]. Agust\u00edn de Iturbide was the general who helped secure Mexican independence from Spanish rule, but was overthrown by the [[Plan of Casa Mata]].\n\nIn 1863, the invading French, under [[Napoleon III]] (see above), in alliance with Mexican conservatives and [[Mexican nobility|nobility]], helped create the [[Second Mexican Empire]], and invited Archduke Maximilian, of the [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]], younger brother of the Austrian Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef I]], to become emperor [[Maximilian of Mexico|Maximilian I of Mexico]]. The childless Maximilian and his consort [[Charlotte of Belgium|Empress Carlota of Mexico]], daughter of [[Leopold I of Belgium]], adopted Agust\u00edn's grandsons Agustin and Salvador as his heirs to bolster his claim to the throne of Mexico. Maximilian and Carlota made [[Chapultepec Castle]] their home, which has been the only palace in North America to house sovereigns. After the withdrawal of French protection in 1867, Maximilian was captured and executed by the liberal forces of [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]].\n\nThis empire led to French influence in the Mexican culture and also [[French Mexican|immigration from France]], Belgium, and Switzerland to Mexico.\n\n==Persia (Iran)==\n{{further|Shah|King of Kings}}\n\nIn [[Iran|Persia]], from the time of [[Darius the Great]], Persian rulers used the title \"[[King of Kings]]\" (''[[Shah]]anshah'' in Persian) since they had dominion over peoples from the borders of India to the borders of Greece and Egypt. [[Alexander]] probably crowned himself ''shahanshah'' after conquering Persia{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, bringing the phrase ''basileus ton basileon'' to Greek. It is also known that [[Tigranes the Great]], king of Armenia, was named as the king of kings when he made his empire after defeating the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]]. Georgian title \"mephet'mephe\" has the same meaning.\n\nThe last ''shahanshah'' ([[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]]) was ousted in 1979 following the [[Iranian Revolution]]. ''Shahanshah'' is usually translated as ''king of kings'' or simply ''king'' for ancient rulers of the [[Achaemenid]], [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]], and [[Sassanid]] dynasties, and often shortened to ''shah'' for rulers since the [[Safavid]] dynasty in the 16th century.  Iranian rulers were typically regarded in the West as emperors.\n\n==Indian subcontinent==\n{{main|Chakravartin|Chhatrapati}}\n{{redirect|Samraat|the 1982 film|Samraat (film)}}\nThe Sanskrit word for emperor is ''Samr\u0101j'' or ''Samraat'' or ''Chakravartin''. This word has been used as an epithet of various Vedic deities, like Varuna, and has been attested in the [[Rigveda|Rig-Veda]], possibly the oldest compiled book among the Indo-Europeans. ''Chakravarti'' refers to the king of kings. A ''Chakravarti'' is not only a sovereign ruler but also has feudatories.\n\nTypically, in the later Vedic age, a Hindu high king (''[[Maharaja]]'') was only called ''Samraa\u1e6d'' after performing the Vedic ''[[Rajasuya]]'' sacrifice, enabling him by religious tradition to claim superiority over the other kings and princes. Another word for emperor is ''s\u0101rvabhaum\u0101''. The title of ''Samraa\u1e6d'' has been used by many rulers of the Indian subcontinent as claimed by the Hindu mythologies. In proper history, most historians call [[Chandragupta Maurya]] the first ''samraa\u1e6d'' (emperor) of the Indian subcontinent, because of the huge empire he ruled. The most famous emperor was his grandson [[Ashoka the Great]]. Other dynasties that are considered imperial by historians are the [[Kushan Empire|Kushanas]], [[Gupta Empire|Guptas]], [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara]], [[Kakatiya Empire|Kakatiya]], [[Hoysala Empire|Hoysala]] and the [[Chola Dynasty|Cholas]].\n\n[[Rudhramadevi]] (1259\u20131289) was one of the most prominent rulers of the [[Kakatiya dynasty]] on the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] Plateau, being one of the few ruling queens (empress) in Indian history.\n\nAfter India was invaded by the Mongol Khans and Turkic Muslims, the rulers of their major states on the subcontinent were titled ''[[Sultan|Sult\u0101n]]'' or ''[[Padishah|Badshah]]'' or ''[[Shah]]anshah''. In this manner, the only empress-regnant ever to have actually sat on the throne of Delhi was [[Razia Sultana|Razia Sultan]].  The [[Mughal Emperor]]s were the only Indian rulers for whom the term was consistently used by Western contemporaries. The emperors of the [[Maratha Empire]] were called ''[[Chhatrapati]]''. From 1877 to 1947 the [[monarch of the United Kingdom]] adopted the additional title of [[Emperor of India|Emperor/Empress of India]] (''Kaisar-i-Hind'').\n\n==Africa==\n\n===Ethiopia===\n{{More citations needed|date=February 2012}}\n{{Main|Emperor of Ethiopia}}\n[[File:Haile Selassie (1969).jpg|thumb|[[Haile Selassie]], [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] from 1930 to 1974.]]\nFrom 1270 the [[Solomonic dynasty]] of [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]] used the title {{transl|am|N\u0259gus\u00e4 N\u00e4g\u00e4st}}, literally \"King of Kings\". The use of the ''king of kings'' style began a millennium earlier in this region, however, with the title being used by the Kings of [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksum]], beginning with [[Sembrouthes]] in the 3rd century.\n\nAnother title used by this dynasty was {{transl|am|Itegue Zetopia}}. {{transl|am|Itegue}} translates as Empress, and was used by the only reigning Empress, [[Zauditu of Ethiopia|Zauditu]], along with the official title {{transl|am|Negiste Negest}} (\"Queen of Kings\").\n\nIn 1936, the Italian king [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]] claimed the title of [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] after Ethiopia was occupied by Italy during the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]]. After the defeat of the Italians by the British and the Ethiopians in 1941, [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]] was restored to the throne but Victor Emmanuel did not relinquish his claim to the title until 1943.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vadala|first=Alexander Attilio|date=2011-01-01|title=Elite Distinction and Regime Change: The Ethiopian Case|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/156913311x590664|journal=Comparative Sociology|volume=10|issue=4|pages=636\u2013653|doi=10.1163/156913311X590664|issn=1569-1330}}</ref>\n\n===Central African Empire===\n{{Main|Emperor of Central Africa}}\nIn 1976, President [[Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa]] of the [[Central African Republic]], proclaimed the country to be an autocratic [[Central African Empire]], and made himself Emperor as Bokassa I.

The claims of other East Asian monarchies to the title may have been accepted for diplomatic purposes, but it was not necessarily used in more general contexts.\n\n===China===\n{{Main|Emperor of China}}\n[[File:Qin Shi Huang BW.png|thumb|upright|Qin Shi Huang]]\n\nThe [[East Asian]] tradition is different from the Roman tradition, having arisen separately. What links them together is the use of the Chinese logographs \u7687 (''hu\u00e1ng'') and \u5e1d (''d\u00ec'') which together or individually are imperial. Because of the cultural influence of China, China's neighbors adopted these titles or had their native titles conform in ''[[hanzi]]''. Anyone who spoke to the emperor was to address the emperor as b\u00ecxi\u00e0 (\u965b\u4e0b, lit. the \"Bottom of the Steps\"), corresponding to \"[[Imperial Majesty (style)|Imperial Majesty]]\"; sh\u00e8ngsh\u00e0ng (\u8056\u4e0a, lit. Holy Highness); or w\u00e0nsu\u00ec (\u842c\u6b72, lit. \"You, of Ten Thousand Years\").\n\nIn 221 BC, [[Qin Shi Huang|Ying Zheng]], who was [[Chinese sovereign|king]] of [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] at the time, proclaimed himself ''[[Shi Huangdi]]'' (\u59cb\u7687\u5e1d), which translates as \"first emperor\". ''Huangdi'' is composed of ''huang'' (\"august one\", \u7687) and ''di'' (\"sage-king\", \u5e1d), and referred to legendary/mythological [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors|sage-emperors]] living several millennia earlier, of which three were ''huang'' and five were ''di''. Thus Zheng became [[Qin Shi Huang]], abolishing the system where the ''huang''/''di'' titles were reserved to dead and/or mythological rulers. Since then, the title \"king\" became a lower ranked title, and later divided into two grades. Although not as popular, the title \u738b ''wang'' (king or prince) was still used by many monarchs and dynasties in China up to the [[Taiping Rebellion|Taipings]] in the 19th century. \u738b is pronounced ''v\u01b0\u01a1ng'' in Vietnamese, ''\u014d'' in Japanese, and ''wang'' in Korean.\n\nThe imperial title continued in China until the [[Qing Dynasty]] was overthrown in 1912. The title was briefly revived from 12 December 1915 to 22 March 1916 by President [[Yuan Shikai]] and again in early July 1917 when General [[Zhang Xun (Qing loyalist)|Zhang Xun]] attempted to restore last Qing emperor [[Puyi]] to the throne. Puyi retained the title and attributes of a foreign emperor, as a personal status, until 1924. After the Japanese occupied [[Manchuria]] in 1931, they proclaimed it to be the Empire of [[Manchukuo]], and Puyi became emperor of Manchukuo. This empire ceased to exist when it was occupied by the Soviet [[Red Army]] in 1945.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Manchukuo|title=Manchukuo {{!}} puppet state created by Japan in China [1932]|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-06-02}}</ref>\n\nIn general, an emperor would have one empress (''Huanghou'', \u7687\u540e) at one time, although posthumous entitlement to empress for a [[concubines|concubine]] was not uncommon. The earliest known usage of ''huanghou'' was in the [[Han Dynasty]]. The emperor would generally select the empress from his [[concubine]]s. In subsequent dynasties, when the distinction between wife and concubine became more accentuated, the [[crown prince]] would have chosen an empress-designate before his reign. [[Early Imperial China|Imperial China]] produced only one reigning empress, [[Wu Zetian]], and she used the same Chinese title as an emperor (''Huangdi'', \u7687\u5e1d). Wu Zetian then reigned for about 15 years (690\u2013705 AD).\n\n===Japan===\n{{Main|Emperor of Japan}}\n[[File:Emperor Showa.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emperor Hirohito]] (\u88d5\u4ec1), or the [[Sh\u014dwa Emperor]] (\u662d\u548c\u5929\u7687), the last Japanese Emperor having ruled with prerogative powers, combined with assumption of divinity (photographed 1926).]]\n\nThe earliest Emperor recorded in [[Kojiki]] and [[Nihon Shoki]] is [[Emperor Jimmu]], who is said to be a descendant of [[Amaterasu]]'s grandson Ninigi who descended from Heaven ([[Tenson k\u014drin]]). If one believes what is written in [[Nihon Shoki]], the Emperors have an unbroken direct male lineage that goes back more than 2,600 years.\n\nIn ancient Japan, the earliest titles for the sovereign were either \u30e4\u30de\u30c8\u5927\u738b/\u5927\u541b (''yamato \u014dkimi'', Grand King of Yamato), \u502d\u738b/\u502d\u56fd\u738b (''wa\u014d''/''wakoku\u014d'', King of Wa, used externally), or \u6cbb\u5929\u4e0b\u5927\u738b (''amenoshita shiroshimesu \u014dkimi'', Grand King who rules all under heaven, used internally). As early as the 7th century, the word \u5929\u7687 (which can be read either as ''sumera no mikoto'', divine order, or as ''tenn\u014d'', Heavenly Emperor, the latter being derived from a Tang Chinese term referring to the Pole star around which all other stars revolve) began to be used. The earliest use of this term is found on a wooden slat, or ''[[mokkan]]'', unearthed in Asuka-mura, Nara Prefecture in 1998. The slat dated back to the reign of [[Emperor Tenmu]] and [[Empress Jit\u014d]]. The reading 'Tenn\u014d' has become the standard title for the Japanese sovereign up to the present age. The term \u5e1d (''mikado'', Emperor) is also found in literary sources.\n\nJapanese monarchs were given their official title by the Chinese emperor. The new Japanese monarch after coming into power would send a representative to China and receive the anointment. They would receive their official title on several golden plates of several meters tall. Since the Japanese monarchs changed their title to \u5929\u7687 (Heavenly Emperor) in 607, the Chinese emperor refused to anoint the Japanese king, thus, ending relations with Japan for the next few hundred years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/02/15/national/history/once-upon-a-time-china-anointed-a-king-of-japan/#.U2exSPldVRY|title=Once upon a time, China anointed a 'King of Japan' - The Japan Times|work=The Japan Times}}</ref> In the Japanese language, the word ''tenn\u014d'' is restricted to Japan's own monarch; ''k\u014dtei'' (\u7687\u5e1d) is used for foreign emperors. Historically, [[Daij\u014d-tenn\u014d|retired emperors]] often kept power over a child-emperor as de facto regent. For a long time, a ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' (formally the imperial [[Military dictatorship|military dictator]], but made hereditary) or an [[Sessh\u014d and Kampaku|imperial regent]] wielded actual political power. In fact, through much of Japanese history, the emperor has been little more than a figurehead. The [[Meiji Restoration]] restored practical abilities and the political system under [[Emperor Meiji]].<ref name=\"China p.79\">Henry Kissinger On China. 2011 p.79</ref> The last shogun [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] resigned in 1868.\n\nAfter World War II, all claims of divinity were dropped (see [[Ningen-sengen]]). The Diet acquired all prerogative powers of the Crown, reverting the latter to a ceremonial role.<ref>Although the [[Emperor of Japan]] is classified as constitutional monarch among political scientists, the current constitution of Japan defines him only as 'a symbol of the nation' and no subsequent legislation states his status as the [[head of state]] or equates the Crown synonymously with any government establishment.</ref> By the end of the 20th century, Japan was the only country with an emperor on the throne.\n\nAs of the early 21st century, Japan's succession law prohibits a female from ascending the throne. With the birth of a [[Aiko, Princess Toshi|daughter]] as the first child of the then-Crown Prince [[Naruhito]], Japan [[Naruhito#Marriage and family|considered abandoning that rule]]. However, shortly after the announcement that [[Kiko, Princess Akishino|Princess Kiko]] was pregnant with her third child, the proposal to alter the [[Imperial Household Law]] was suspended by then-Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]].

The second and third in line of succession are [[Fumihito, Prince Akishino]] and [[Prince Hisahito]]. Historically, Japan has had eight reigning empresses who used the genderless title ''Tenn\u014d'', rather than the female consort title ''k\u014dg\u014d'' (\u7687\u540e) or ''ch\u016bg\u016b'' (\u4e2d\u5bae). There is ongoing discussion of the [[Japanese Imperial succession controversy]].\n<!--\nEmperor's highest wife is called Kogo, and the female emperor is not called Kogo but Tenno as her male counterparts. The female emperor should be called (\u5929\u7687 Ten-no) but Empress is usual in Western parlances. However, how should female emperor's husband be called? It has not been provided in Japan yet, because no female emperor was married when reigning: only single women (widows, unmarrieds) have been female emperors in history, or a wife or widow of an emperor or Crown Prince was made female Tenno (i. e., she was already Kogo or something like it).\n-->\nAlthough current Japanese law prohibits female succession, all Japanese emperors claim to trace their lineage to ''[[Amaterasu]]'', the Sun Goddess of the [[Shinto|Shint\u014d]] [[religion]]. <!-- Shinto religion does not recognize a \"supreme\" kami, rather, kami and humans alike are viewed equally.--> Thus, the Emperor is thought to be the highest authority of the Shinto religion, and one of his duties is to perform Shinto rituals for the people of Japan.\n\n===Korea===\n{{Main|Emperor of Korea}}\n\n[[File:Gojong of the Korean Empire 01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emperor Gojong]] of the [[Korean Empire]]]]\n\nSome rulers of [[Goguryeo]] (37 BC\u2013AD 668) used the title of ''[[Taewang]]'' ({{Korean|\ud0dc\uc655|\u592a\u738b|labels=no}}), literally translated as \"Greatest King\".

However, after the death of Ng\u00f4 Quy\u1ec1n, the country immersed in a civil war known as [[12 Warlords Rebellion|Chaos of the 12 Lords]] that lasted for over 20 years. In the end, [[\u0110inh B\u1ed9 L\u0129nh]] unified the country after defeating all the warlords and became the first ruler of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t to use the title ''Ho\u00e0ng \u0110\u1ebf'' (\u7687\u5e1d, ''Emperor'') in 968.

Before him, [[L\u00fd B\u00ed]] and [[Mai Th\u00fac Loan]] also claimed this title. However, their rules were very short lived.\n\nThe Vietnamese emperors also gave this title to their ancestors who were lords or influence figures in the previous dynasty like the Chinese emperors. This practice is one of many indications of the idea \"Vietnam's equality with China\" which remained intact up to the twentieth century.<ref>{{citation|author=Tuyet Nhung Tran, Anthony J. S.

To avoid unnecessary armed conflicts, the Vietnamese rulers accepted this in diplomatic relation and use the title Emperor only domestically. However, Vietnamese rulers never accepted the vassalage relationship with China and always refused to come to Chinese courts to pay homage to Chinese rulers (a sign of vassalage acceptance). China waged a number of wars against Vietnam throughout history, and after each failure, settled for the tributary relationship. The Yuan dynasty under [[Kublai Khan]] waged three wars against Vietnam to force it into a vassalage relationship but after successive failures, [[Kublai Khan]]'s successor, [[Tem\u00fcr Khan]], finally settled for a tributary relationship with Vietnam. Vietnam sent tributary missions to China once in three years (with some periods of disruptions) until the 19th century, [[Sino-French War]] France replaced China in control of northern Vietnam.\n\nThe emperors of the last dynasty of Vietnam continued to hold this title until the French conquered Vietnam. The emperor, however, was then a puppet figure only and could easily be disposed of by the French for more pro-France figure. Japan took Vietnam from France and the [[Axis powers|Axis]]-occupied Vietnam was declared an [[Empire of Vietnam|empire]] by the Japanese in March 1945. The line of emperors came to an end with [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]], who was deposed after the war, although he later served as head of state of [[South Vietnam]] from 1949-55.\n\n==Oceania==\nThe lone holders of the imperial title in [[Oceania]] were the heads of the semi-mythical [[Tu\u02bbi Tonga Empire]].\n\n==Fictional uses==\nThere have been many fictional emperors in movies and books.

'''Empress''', the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife ([[empress consort]]), mother ([[empress dowager]]), or a woman who rules in her own right ([[empress regnant]]). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher [[honour]] and [[royal and noble ranks|rank]] than [[king]]s. In [[Europe]], the title of Emperor has been used since the [[Middle Ages]], considered in those times equal or almost equal in dignity to that of [[Pope]] due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of the Catholic part of [[Western Europe]]. The [[Emperor of Japan]] is the only currently [[List of current sovereign monarchs|reigning monarch]] whose title is translated into English as \"Emperor\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Uyama |first=Takuei |date=October 23, 2019 |title=\u5929\u7687\u306f\u306a\u305c\u300c\u738b\uff08\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\uff09\u300d\u3067\u306f\u306a\u304f\u300c\u7687\u5e1d\uff08\u30a8\u30f3\u30da\u30e9\u30fc\uff09\u300d\u306a\u306e\u304b |trans-title=The Title of the Monarch of Japan: not the \u201cKing\u201d but the \u201cEmperor\u201d |url=https://gendai.ismedia.jp/articles/-/67945?page=2 |language=Japanese |work= |location= |access-date=October 23, 2019}}</ref> \n\nBoth emperors and kings are [[monarch]]s, but emperor and empress are considered the higher monarchical titles. Inasmuch as there is a strict definition of emperor, it is that an emperor has no relations implying the superiority of any other ruler and typically rules over more than one nation. Therefore a king might be obliged to pay [[tribute]] to another ruler,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-art-history/south-east-se-asia/china-art/a/forbidden-city|title=The Forbidden City|last=Peng|first=Dr. Ying-chen|date=|website=Khan Academy|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> or be restrained in his actions in some unequal fashion, but an emperor should in theory be completely free of such restraints. However, monarchs heading empires have not always used the title in all contexts\u2014the British sovereign did not assume the title Empress of the [[British Empire]] even during the [[British Raj|incorporation of India]], though she was declared [[Empress of India]].\n\nIn [[Western Europe]], the title of Emperor was used exclusively by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], whose imperial authority was derived from the concept of {{lang|la|[[translatio imperii]]}}, i.e. they claimed succession to the authority of the [[Western Roman Emperor]]s, thus linking themselves to Roman institutions and traditions as part of state ideology. Although initially ruling much of Central Europe and northern Italy, by the 19th century the Emperor exercised little power beyond the German-speaking states.\n\nAlthough technically an elective title, by the late 16th century the imperial title had in practice come to be inherited by the [[Habsburg]] [[Archdukes of Austria]] and following the [[Thirty Years' War]] their control over the states (outside the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], i.e. [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] and various territories outside the empire) had become nearly non-existent. However, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was crowned [[Emperor of the French]] in 1804 and was shortly followed by [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor]], who declared himself [[Emperor of Austria]] in the same year. The position of Holy Roman Emperor nonetheless continued until [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] abdicated that position in 1806. In [[Eastern Europe]], the monarchs of [[Russia]] also used {{lang|la|translatio imperii}} to wield imperial authority as successors to the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. Their status was officially recognised by the Holy Roman Emperor in 1514, although not officially used by the Russian monarchs until 1547. However, the Russian emperors are better known by their Russian-language title of [[Tsar]] even after [[Peter the Great]] adopted the title of [[Emperor of All Russia]] in 1721.\n\nHistorians have liberally used emperor and empire anachronistically and out of its Roman and European context to describe any large state from the past or the present. Such pre-Roman titles as [[Great King]] or [[King of Kings]], used by the Kings of Persia and others, are often considered as the equivalent. Sometimes this reference has even extended to non-monarchically ruled states and their spheres of influence such as the [[Athenian Empire]] of the late 5th century BC, the [[Angevin Empire]] of the [[Plantagenets]] and the [[Soviet Empire|Soviet]] and [[American imperialism|American]] \"empires\" of the [[Cold War]] era. However, such \"empires\" did not need to be headed by an \"emperor\". Empire became identified instead with vast territorial holdings rather than the title of its ruler by the mid-18th century.\n\nFor purposes of protocol, emperors were once given [[Order of precedence|precedence]] over kings in international diplomatic relations, but currently precedence amongst [[heads of state]] who are sovereigns\u2014whether they be kings, queens, emperors, empresses, princes, princesses and to a lesser degree presidents\u2014is determined by the duration of time that each one has been continuously in office. Outside the European context, emperor was the translation given to holders of titles who were accorded the same precedence as European emperors in diplomatic terms. In reciprocity, these rulers might accredit equal titles in their native languages to their European peers. Through centuries of international convention, this has become the dominant rule to identifying an emperor in the modern era.\n\n==Roman tradition==\n\nIn the [[ancient Rome|Roman]] tradition a large variety in the meaning and importance of the imperial form of monarchy developed: in ''intention'' it was always the highest office, but it could as well fall down to a redundant title for nobility that had never been near to the \"Empire\" they were supposed to be reigning. Also the ''name'' of the position split in several branches of Western tradition, see below.\n\nThe importance and meaning of [[coronation]] ceremonies and [[regalia]] also varied within the tradition: for instance [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s could only be crowned emperor by the [[Pope]], which meant the coronation ceremony usually took place in Rome, often several years after these emperors had ascended to the throne (as \"king\") in their home country. The first [[Latin Empire of Constantinople|Latin Emperors of Constantinople]] on the other hand had to be present in the newly conquered capital of their empire, because that was the only place where they could be granted to become emperor.\n\nEarly [[Roman Emperor]]s avoided any type of ceremony or regalia different from what was already usual for republican offices in the [[Roman Republic]]: the most intrusive change had been changing the color of their robe to purple. Later new symbols of worldly and/or spiritual power, like the [[Globus cruciger|orb]], became an essential part of the imperial accessories.\n\nRules for indicating successors also varied: there was a tendency towards ''male'' ''inheritance'' of the supreme office, but as well election by noblemen, as ruling empresses are known (for empires not too strictly under [[salic law]]). Ruling monarchs could additionally steer the succession by adoption, as often occurred in the two first centuries of Imperial Rome. Of course, intrigue, murder and military force could also mingle in for appointing successors; the Roman imperial tradition made no exception to other monarchical traditions in this respect. Probably the epoch best known for this part of the imperial tradition is [[Roman Emperor (Crisis of the Third Century)|Rome's third century]] rule.\n\n==Roman Empire and Byzantine emperors==\n\n===Classical Antiquity===\n{{Main|Roman emperor|Imperator}}\n[[File:Rimini083.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A statue of the dictator [[Julius Caesar]].]]\n\nWhen [[Roman Republic|Republican Rome]] turned into a ''de facto'' [[monarchy]] in the second half of the 1st century BC, at first there was no name for the title of the new type of monarch.  Ancient Romans abhorred the name [[King of Rome|Rex (\"king\")]], and it was critical to the political order to maintain the forms and pretenses of republican rule.  [[Julius Caesar]] had been [[Roman dictator|Dictator]], an acknowledged and traditional office in Republican Rome.  Caesar was not the first to hold it, but following his assassination the term was abhorred in Rome{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}.\n\n[[File:Statue-Augustus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Augustus]], the first emperor of the Roman Empire.]]\n[[Augustus]], considered the first [[Roman emperor]], established his hegemony by collecting on himself offices, titles, and honours of Republican Rome that had traditionally been distributed to different people, concentrating what had been distributed power in one man.  One of these offices was ''[[princeps senatus]]'', (\"first man of the Senate\") and became changed into Augustus' chief honorific, ''[[Princeps|princeps civitatis]]'' (\"first citizen\") from which the modern English word and title [[prince]] is descended.  The first period of the [[Roman Empire]], from 27 BC \u2013 AD 284, is called the ''[[principate]]'' for this reason.  However, it was the informal descriptive of ''[[Imperator]]'' (\"commander\") that became the title increasingly favored by his successors.  Previously bestowed on high officials and military commanders who had ''[[imperium]]'', Augustus reserved it exclusively to himself as the ultimate holder of all ''imperium''.  (''Imperium'' is Latin for the authority to command, one of a various types of authority delineated in Roman political thought.)\n\nBeginning with Augustus, ''Imperator'' appeared in the title of all Roman monarchs through the extinction of the Empire in 1453.  After the reign of Augustus' immediate successor [[Tiberius]], being proclaimed ''imperator'' was transformed into the act of accession to the [[head of state]]. Other honorifics used by the Roman Emperors have also come to be synonyms for Emperor:\n\n*'''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]''' (as, for example, in [[Suetonius]]' ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Twelve Caesars]]''). This tradition continued in many languages: in German it became \"[[Kaiser]]\"; in certain [[Slavic languages]] it became \"[[Tsar]]\"; in Hungarian it became \"[[Cs\u00e1sz\u00e1r]]\", and several more variants. The name derived from [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[cognomen]] \"Caesar\": this cognomen was adopted by all Roman emperors, exclusively by the ruling monarch after the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] had died out. In this tradition Julius Caesar is sometimes described as the first Caesar/emperor (following Suetonius). This is one of the most enduring titles, Caesar and its transliterations appeared in every year from the time of [[Caesar Augustus]] to Tsar [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Symeon II of Bulgaria]]'s removal from the throne in 1946.\n*'''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]''' was the [[honorific]] first bestowed on Emperor Augustus: after him all Roman emperors added it to their name. Although it had a high symbolical value, something like \"elevated\" or \"sublime\", it was generally not used to indicate the office of ''Emperor'' itself. Exceptions include the title of the ''[[Augustan History]]'', a semi-historical collection of Emperors' biographies of the 2nd and 3rd century. Augustus had (by his last will) granted the feminine form of this honorific ([[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]) to his wife. Since there was no \"title\" of Empress(-consort) whatsoever, women of the reigning dynasty sought to be granted this honorific, as the highest attainable goal. Few were however granted the title, and certainly not as a rule all wives of reigning Emperors.\n*'''[[Imperator]]''' (as, for example, in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''). In the [[Roman Republic]] Imperator meant \"(military) commander\". In the late Republic, as in the early years of the new monarchy, ''Imperator'' was a title granted to Roman generals by their troops and the [[Roman Senate]] after a great victory, roughly comparable to [[field marshal]] (head or commander of the entire army). For example, in AD 15 [[Germanicus]] was proclaimed ''Imperator'' during the reign of his adoptive father [[Tiberius]]. Soon thereafter \"Imperator\" became however a title reserved exclusively for the ruling monarch. This led to \"Emperor\" in English and, among other examples, \"Empereur\" in French and \"Mbreti\" in Albanian. The Latin feminine form [[Imperatrix]] only developed after \"Imperator\" had taken on the connotation of \"Emperor\".\n*'''[[Autokrator]]''' (\u0391\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03c1) or '''[[basileus#Romans and Byzantines|Basileus]]''' (\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2): although the Greeks used equivalents of \"Caesar\" (\u039a\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1, ''Kaisar'') and \"Augustus\" (in two forms: transliterated as {{lang|grc|\u0391\u1f54\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2}}, ''Augoustos'' or translated as {{lang|grc|\u03a3\u03b5\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2}}, ''[[Sebastos]]'') these were rather used as part of the name of the Emperor than as an indication of the office. Instead of developing a new name for the new type of monarchy, they used {{lang|grc|\u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03c1}} (''autokrat\u014dr'', only partly overlapping with the modern understanding of \"[[Autocracy|autocrat]]\") or {{lang|grc|\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2}} (''[[basileus]]'', until then the usual name for \"[[Monarch|sovereign]]\"). ''Autokrat\u014dr'' was essentially used as a translation of the Latin ''Imperator'' in Greek-speaking part of the Roman Empire, but also here there is only partial overlap between the meaning of the original Greek and Latin concepts. For the Greeks ''Autokrat\u014dr'' was not a military title, and was closer to the Latin ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]'' concept (\"the one with unlimited power\"), before it came to mean Emperor. ''Basileus'' appears not to have been used exclusively in the meaning of \"emperor\" (and specifically, the Roman/Byzantine emperor) before the 7th century, although it was a standard informal designation of the Emperor in the Greek-speaking East.\n\nAfter the turbulent [[Year of the four emperors]] in 69, the [[Flavian Dynasty]] reigned for three decades. The succeeding [[Nervan-Antonian Dynasty]], ruling for most of the 2nd century, stabilised the Empire. This epoch became known as the era of the ''[[Nerva\u2013Antonine dynasty#Five Good Emperors|Five Good Emperors]]'', and was followed by the short-lived [[Severan Dynasty]].\n\nDuring the [[Crisis of the 3rd century]], [[Barracks Emperor]]s succeeded one another at short intervals. Three short lived secessionist attempts had their own emperors: the [[Gallic Empire]], the [[Britannic Empire]], and the [[Palmyrene Empire]] though the latter used ''rex'' more regularly.\n\nThe [[Principate]] (27 BC \u2013 284 AD) period was succeeded by what is known as the [[Dominate]] (284 AD \u2013 527 AD), during which Emperor [[Diocletian]] tried to put the Empire on a more formal footing.  Diocletian sought to address the challenges of the Empire's now vast geography and the instability caused by the informality of succession by the creation of co-emperors and junior emperors.  At one point, there were as many as five sharers of the ''imperium'' (see: [[Tetrarchy]]).  In 325 AD [[Constantine I]] defeated his rivals and restored single emperor rule, but following his death the empire was divided among his sons. For a time the concept was of one empire ruled by multiple emperors with varying territory under their control, however following the death of [[Theodosius I]] the rule was divided between his two sons and increasingly became separate entities.  The areas administered from Rome are referred to by historians the [[Western Roman Empire]] and those under the immediate authority of Constantinople called the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] or (after the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] in 636 AD) the [[Byzantine Empire|Later Roman or Byzantine Empire]].  The subdivisions and co-emperor system were formally abolished by [[Zeno (emperor)|Emperor Zeno]] in 480 AD following the death of [[Julius Nepos]] last Western Emperor and the ascension of [[Odoacer]] as the ''de facto'' King of Italy in 476 AD.\n\n===Byzantine period===\n{{Main|Byzantine Emperor}}\n\n====Before the 4th Crusade====\n[[File:Sanvitale03.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Under [[Justinian I]], reigning in the 6th century, parts of Italy were for a few decades (re)conquered from the [[Ostrogoths]]: thus, this famous [[mosaic]], featuring the Byzantine emperor in the center, can be admired at [[Ravenna]].]]\n\nHistorians generally refer to the continuing Roman Empire in the east as the [[Byzantine Empire]] after [[Byzantium]], the original name of the town that [[Constantine I]] would elevate to the Imperial capital as [[New Rome]] in AD 330. (The city is more commonly called [[Constantinople]] and is today named [[Istanbul]]). Although the empire was again subdivided and a co-emperor sent to Italy at the end of the fourth century, the office became unitary again only 95 years later at the request of the [[Roman Senate]] and following the death of [[Julius Nepos]], last Western Emperor. This change was a recognition of the reality that little remained of Imperial authority in the areas that had been the Western Empire, with even Rome and Italy itself now ruled by the essentially autonomous [[Odoacer]].\n\nThese Later Roman \"Byzantine\" Emperors completed the transition from the idea of the Emperor as a semi-republican official to the Emperor as an [[absolute monarch]]. Of particular note was the translation of the Latin ''Imperator'' into the Greek ''[[Basileus]]'', after Emperor [[Heraclius]] changed the official language of the empire from Latin to Greek in AD 620. Basileus, a title which had long been used for [[Alexander the Great]] was already in common usage as the Greek word for the Roman emperor, but its definition and sense was \"King\" in Greek, essentially equivalent with the Latin ''Rex''. Byzantine period emperors also used the Greek word \"autokrator\", meaning \"one who rules himself\", or \"monarch\", which was traditionally used by Greek writers to translate the Latin ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]''. Essentially, the Greek language did not incorporate the nuances of the Ancient Roman concepts that distinguished ''imperium'' from other forms of political power.\n\nIn general usage, the Byzantine imperial title evolved from simply \"emperor\" (''basileus''), to \"emperor of the Romans\" (''basileus t\u014dn R\u014dmai\u014dn'') in the 9th century, to \"emperor and autocrat of the Romans\" (''basileus kai autokrat\u014dr t\u014dn R\u014dmai\u014dn'') in the 10th.<ref>[[George Alexandrovi\u010d Ostrogorsky|George Ostrogorsky]], \"Avtokrator i samodr\u017eac\", ''Glas Srpske kraljevske akadamije'' CLXIV, Drugi razdred 84 (1935), 95\u2013187</ref> In fact, none of these (and other) additional epithets and titles had ever been completely discarded.\n\nOne important distinction between the post Constantine I (reigned AD 306\u2013337) emperors and their pagan predecessors was [[cesaropapism]], the assertion that the Emperor (or other head of state) is also the head of the Church. Although this principle was held by all emperors after Constantine, it met with increasing resistance and ultimately rejection by bishops in the west after the effective end of Imperial power there. This concept became a key element of the meaning of \"emperor\" in the Byzantine and Orthodox east, but went out of favor in the west with the rise of [[Roman Catholicism]].\n\nThe Byzantine Empire also produced three women who effectively governed the state: the Empress [[Irene (empress)|Irene]] and the Empresses [[Zoe Porphyrogenita|Zoe]] and [[Theodora (11th century)|Theodora]].\n\n====Latin emperors====\nIn 1204 Constantinople fell to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] and the [[Franks]] in the [[Fourth Crusade]].  Following the tragedy of the horrific [[Siege of Constantinople|sacking]] of the city, the conquerors declared a new \"Empire of Romania\", known to historians as the [[Latin Empire of Constantinople]], installing [[Baldwin IX]], [[Count of Flanders]], as Emperor. However, Byzantine resistance to the new empire meant that it was in constant struggle to establish itself.  Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos succeeded in recapturing Constantinople in 1261.  The [[Principality of Achaea]], a vassal state the empire had created in [[Morea]] (Greece) intermittently continued to recognize the authority of the crusader emperors for another half century.  Pretenders to the title continued among the European nobility until circa 1383.\n\n====After the 4th Crusade====\nWith Constantinople occupied, claimants to the imperial succession styled themselves as emperor in the chief centers of resistance:  The [[Laskaris|Laskarid]] dynasty in the [[Empire of Nicaea]], the [[Komnenos|Komnenid]] dynasty in the [[Empire of Trebizond]] and the [[Doukas|Doukid]] dynasty in the [[Despotate of Epirus]].  In 1248, Epirus recognized the Nicaean Emperors, who subsequently recaptured Constantinople in 1261.  The Trapezuntine emperor formally submitted in Constantinople in 1281,<ref>Nicol, Donald MacGillivray, ''The Last Centuries of Byzantium'', second edition (Cambridge: University Press, 1993), p. 74</ref> but frequently flouted convention by styling themselves emperor back in Trebizond thereafter.\n\n== Ottoman Empire ==\n[[File:Suleiman Agostino.JPG|thumb|190px|[[Agostino Veneziano]]'s [[engraving]] of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] emperor Suleiman the Magnificent wearing his [[S\u00fcleyman the Magnificent's Venetian Helmet|Venetian Helmet]].{{NoteTag|Agostino never saw the Sultan, but probably did see and sketch the helmet in Venice.}} Note the four tiers on the helmet, symbolizing his imperial power, and excelling the three-tiered [[papal tiara]].<ref>The Metropolitan Museum of Art. 1968. \"Turquerie\" ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', New Series 26 (5): 229.</ref> This tiara was made for 115,000 [[ducats]] and offered to Suleiman by the French ambassador [[Antonio Rincon]] in 1532.<ref>Garnier, p.&nbsp;52.</ref> This was a most atypical piece of headgear for a Turkish sultan, which he probably never normally wore, but which he placed beside him when receiving visitors, especially ambassadors.

These included:{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} [[Sultan]], [[Khan (title)|Khan]], Sovereign of the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Imperial House of Osman]], [[Sultan of Sultans]], [[Khan of Khans]], [[Amir al-Mu'minin|Commander of the Faithful]] and [[Caliph|Successor of the Prophet of the Lord of the Universe]], Protector of the Holy Cities of [[Mecca]], [[Medina]] and [[Jerusalem]], Emperor of The Three Cities of [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], [[Edirne|Adrianopole]] and [[Bursa]] as well as many other cities and countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nobility of the World Volume VIII- Turkey|url=http://www.almanachdegotha.org/id244.html|website=Almanch De Saxe Gotha|accessdate=10 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Ottoman capture of Constantinople in 1453, the Ottoman sultans began to style themselves '''Kaysar-i Rum''' (Emperor of the Romans) as they asserted themselves to be the heirs to the Roman Empire by right of conquest. The title was of such importance to them that it led them to eliminate the various Byzantine successor states \u2014 and therefore rival claimants \u2014 over the next eight years. Though the term \"emperor\" was rarely used by Westerners of the Ottoman sultan, it was generally accepted by Westerners that he had imperial status.\n\n==Holy Roman Empire==\n{{Main|Holy Roman Emperor}}\nThe ''Emperor'' of the Romans' title was a reflection of the ''[[translatio imperii]]'' (''transfer of rule'') principle that regarded the Holy Roman Emperors as the inheritors of the title of Emperor of the [[Western Roman Empire]], despite the continued existence of the [[Byzantine Empire|Roman Empire]] in the east, hence the [[problem of two emperors]].\n\nFrom the time of [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto the Great]] onward, much of the former [[Carolingian]] kingdom of [[Eastern Francia]] became the Holy Roman Empire. The  [[prince-elector]]s elected one of their peers as [[King of the Romans]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|King of Italy]] before being crowned by the [[Pope]]. The Emperor could also pursue the election of his heir (usually a son) as King, who would then succeed him after his death. This junior King then bore the title of Roman King (King of the Romans). Although technically already ruling, after the election he would be crowned as emperor by the Pope. The last emperor to be crowned by the pope was [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]; all emperors after him were technically ''emperors-elect'', but were universally referred to as ''Emperor''.\n\n==Austrian Empire==\n{{Main|Emperor of Austria}}\nThe first Austrian Emperor was the last Holy Roman Emperor Francis II. In the face of aggressions by [[Napoleon]], Francis feared for the future of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. He wished to maintain his and his family's Imperial status in the event that the Holy Roman Empire should be dissolved, as it indeed was in 1806 when an Austrian-led army suffered a humiliating defeat at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]]. After which, the victorious Napoleon proceeded to dismantle the old ''Reich'' by severing a good portion from the empire and turning it into a separate [[Confederation of the Rhine]].  With the size of his imperial realm significantly reduced, Francis II, ''Holy Roman Emperor'' became Francis I, ''Emperor of Austria''. The new imperial title may have sounded less prestigious than the old one, but Francis' [[dynasty]] continued to rule from Austria and a Habsburg monarch was still an emperor (''Kaiser''), and not just merely a king (''K\u00f6nig''), in name.\n\nThe title lasted just a little over one century until 1918, but it was never clear what territory constituted the \"[[Austrian Empire|Empire of Austria]]\".  When Francis took the title in 1804, the Habsburg lands as a whole were dubbed the ''Kaisertum \u00d6sterreich''.  ''Kaisertum'' might literally be translated as \"emperordom\" (on analogy with \"kingdom\") or \"emperor-ship\"; the term denotes specifically \"the territory ruled by an emperor\", and is thus somewhat more general than [[Reich]], which in 1804 carried connotations of universal rule.  Austria proper (as opposed to the complex of Habsburg lands as a whole) had been an Archduchy since the 15th century, and most of the other territories of the Empire had their own institutions and territorial history, although there were some attempts at centralization, especially during the reign of Marie Therese and her son Joseph II and then finalized in the early 19th century.  When Hungary was given self-government in 1867, the non-Hungarian portions were called the Empire of Austria and were officially known as the \"Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Council]] (''Reichsrat'')\".  The title of Emperor of Austria and the associated Empire were both abolished at the end of the First World War in 1918, when [[German Austria]] became a [[republic]] and the other kingdoms and lands represented in the Imperial Council established their independence or adhesion to other states.\n\n==Emperors of Europe==\n[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]'s close cultural and political interaction with its Balkan neighbors [[Bulgaria]] and [[Serbia]], and with Russia (Kievan Rus', then Muscovy) led to the adoption of Byzantine imperial traditions in all of these countries.\n\n===Bulgaria===\nIn 913, [[Simeon I of Bulgaria]] was crowned Emperor ([[Tsar]]) by the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] and Imperial regent [[Nicholas Mystikos]] outside the Byzantine capital. In its final simplified form, the title read \"Emperor and Autocrat of all Bulgarians and Romans\" (''Tsar i samodarzhets na vsichki balgari i gartsi'' in the modern vernacular). The Roman component in the Bulgarian imperial title indicated both rulership over Greek speakers and the derivation of the imperial tradition from the Romans, however this component was never recognised by the Byzantine court.\n\nByzantine recognition of Simeon's imperial title was revoked by the succeeding Byzantine government. The decade 914\u2013924 was spent in destructive warfare between Byzantium and Bulgaria over this and other matters of conflict. The Bulgarian monarch, who had further irritated his Byzantine counterpart by claiming the title \"Emperor of the Romans\" (''basileus t\u014dn R\u014dmai\u014dn''), was eventually recognized, as \"Emperor of the Bulgarians\" (''basileus t\u014dn Boulgar\u014dn'') by the Byzantine Emperor [[Romanus I|Romanos I Lakapenos]] in 924. Byzantine recognition of the imperial dignity of the Bulgarian monarch and the patriarchal dignity of the [[Patriarch of All Bulgaria|Bulgarian patriarch]] was again confirmed at the conclusion of permanent peace and a Bulgarian-Byzantine dynastic marriage in 927. In the meantime, the Bulgarian imperial title may have been also confirmed by the [[pope]].  The Bulgarian imperial title \"tsar\" was adopted by all Bulgarian monarchs up to the fall of Bulgaria under Ottoman rule. 14th-century Bulgarian literary compositions clearly denote the Bulgarian capital ([[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]]) as a successor of Rome and [[Constantinople]], in effect, the \"Third Rome\".\n\nAfter Bulgaria obtained full independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1908, its monarch, who was previously styled ''Knyaz'', [prince], took the traditional title of ''Tsar'' [king] and was recognized internationally as such.{{by whom|date=November 2016}}\n\n===France===\nThe kings of the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'' and the [[July Monarchy]] used the title ''Empereur de France'' in diplomatic correspondence and treaties with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] emperor from at least 1673 onwards. The Ottomans insisted on this elevated style while refusing to recognize the Holy Roman Emperors or the Russian tsars because of their rival claims of the [[translatio imperii|Roman crown]]. In short, it was an indirect insult by the Ottomans to the HRE and the Russians. The French kings also used it for [[Morocco]] (1682) and [[Persia]] (1715).\n\n====First French Empire====\n{{See also|First French Empire}}\n[[File:Jacques-Louis David - The Coronation of Napoleon (1805-1807).jpg|thumb|300px|One of the most famous Imperial coronation ceremonies was that of Napoleon, crowning himself Emperor in the presence of [[Pope Pius VII]] (who had blessed the [[regalia]]), at the [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris]].<br>The painting by [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] commemorating the event is equally famous: the gothic cathedral restyled ''[[Empire (style)|style Empire]]'', supervised by the [[Letizia Ramolino|mother of the Emperor]] on the balcony (a fictional addition, while she had not been present at the ceremony), the pope positioned near the altar, Napoleon proceeds to crown his then wife, [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais]] as Empress.]]\n[[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]], who was already First Consul of the French Republic (''Premier Consul de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise'') for life, declared himself '''[[Emperor of the French]]''' (''Empereur des Fran\u00e7ais'') on 18 May 1804, thus creating the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] (''Empire Fran\u00e7ais'').\n\nNapoleon relinquished the title of Emperor of the French on 6 April and again on 11 April 1814.\nNapoleon's infant son, [[Napoleon II of France|Napoleon II]], was recognized by the Council of Peers, as Emperor from the moment of his father's abdication, and therefore reigned (as opposed to ruled) as Emperor for fifteen days, 22 June to 7 July 1815.\n\n====Elba====\nSince 3 May 1814, the Sovereign Principality of [[Elba]] was created a miniature non-hereditary Monarchy under the exiled French Emperor Napoleon I. Napoleon I was allowed, by the treaty of Fontainebleau (27 April), to enjoy, for life, the imperial title. The islands were ''not'' restyled an empire.\n\nOn 26 February 1815, Napoleon abandoned Elba for France, reviving the French Empire for a [[Hundred Days]]; the Allies declared an end to Napoleon's sovereignty over Elba on 25 March 1815, and on 31 March 1815 Elba was ceded to the restored [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] by the Congress of Vienna. After his final defeat, Napoleon was treated as a general by the British authorities during his second exile to Atlantic Isle of [[St. Helena]]. His title was a matter of dispute with the governor of St Helena, who insisted on addressing him as \"General Bonaparte\", despite the \"historical reality that he had been an emperor\" and therefore retained the title.<ref>''Napoleon'', Vincent Cronin, p419, HarperCollins, 1994.</ref><ref>''Napoleon'', Frank McLynn, p644, Pimlico 1998</ref><ref>''Le M\u00e9morial de Sainte H\u00e9l\u00e8ne'', Emmanuel De Las Cases, Tome III, page101, published by Jean De Bonnot, Libraire \u00e0 l'enseigne du canon, 1969</ref>\n\n====Second French Empire====\n{{See also|Second French Empire}}\nNapoleon I's nephew, [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]], resurrected the title of emperor on 2 December 1852, after establishing the [[Second French Empire]] in a presidential [[coup]], subsequently approved by a plebiscite. His reign was marked by large scale public works, the development of social policy, and the extension of France's influence throughout the world. During his reign, he also set about creating the [[Second Mexican Empire]] (headed by his choice of [[Maximilian I of Mexico]], a member of the [[House of Habsburg]]), to regain France's hold in the Americas and to achieve greatness for the 'Latin' race.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S1O6HwzwQs4C&pg=PA88 |title=Race and nation in modern Latin America |first1=Nancy P. |last1=Appelbaum |first2=Anne S. |last2=Macpherson |first3=Karin Alejandra |last3=Rosemblatt |publisher=UNC Press Books |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-8078-5441-9 |page=88}}</ref> Napoleon III was deposed on 4 September 1870, after France's defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]].

It was associated with the [[List of Leonese monarchs|Leonese monarchy]] perhaps as far back as [[Alfonso the Great]] (''r.'' 866\u2013910). The last two kings of its [[Astur-Leonese dynasty]] were called emperors in a contemporary source.\n\nKing [[Sancho III of Navarre]] conquered Leon in 1034 and began using it. His son, [[Ferdinand I of Castile]] also took the title in 1039. Ferdinand's son, [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile]] took the title in 1077. It then passed to his son-in-law, [[Alfonso I of Aragon]] in 1109. His stepson and Alfonso VI's grandson, [[Alfonso VII of Castile|Alfonso VII]] was the only one who actually had an imperial coronation in 1135.\n\nThe title was not exactly hereditary but self-proclaimed by those who had, wholly or partially, united the Christian northern part of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], often at the expense of killing rival siblings. The popes and Holy Roman emperors protested at the usage of the imperial title as a usurpation of leadership in western Christendom. After Alfonso VII's death in 1157, the title was abandoned, and the kings who used it are not commonly mentioned as having been \"emperors\", in Spanish or other historiography.\n\nAfter the fall of the Byzantine Empire, the legitimate heir to the throne, [[Andreas Palaiologos]], willed away his claim to [[Ferdinand and Isabella]] in 1503.\n\n====Portugal====\n[[File:Jean-Baptiste Debret - Retrato de Dom Jo\u00e3o VI (MNBA).jpg|thumb|[[John VI of Portugal|John VI]], [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King of Portugal and the Algarves]], [[Emperor of Brazil]].]]\nAfter the independence and proclamation of the [[Empire of Brazil]] from the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|Kingdom of Portugal]] by [[Pedro I of Brazil|Prince Pedro]], who became Emperor, in 1822, his father, King [[John VI of Portugal]] briefly held the honorific style of Titular [[Emperor of Brazil]] and the treatment of ''His Imperial and Royal Majesty'' under the 1825 [[Treaty of Rio de Janeiro (1825)|Treaty of Rio de Janeiro]], by which Portugal recognized the independence of Brazil. The style of Titular Emperor was a life title, and became extinct upon the holder's demise. John VI held the imperial title for a few months only, from the ratification of the Treaty in November 1825 until his death in March 1826. During those months, however, as John's imperial title was purely honorific while his son, Pedro I, remained the sole monarch of the Brazilian Empire.\n\n===Great Britain===\n{{Main|British Emperor}}\nIn the late 3rd century, by the end of the epoch of the ''barracks emperors'' in Rome, there were two [[Carausian Revolt|Britannic Emperors]], reigning for about a decade. After the [[end of Roman rule in Britain]], the Imperator [[Cunedda]] forged the [[Kingdom of Gwynedd]] in northern Wales, but all his successors were titled kings and princes.\n\n====England====\nThere was no consistent title for the king of England before 1066, and monarchs chose to style themselves as they pleased. Imperial titles were used inconsistently, beginning with [[Athelstan]] in 930 and ended with the [[Norman conquest of England]]. [[Empress Matilda]] (1102\u20131167) is the only English monarch commonly referred to as \"emperor\" or \"empress\", but she acquired her title through her marriage to [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\nDuring the rule of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] the [[Statute in Restraint of Appeals]] declared that 'this realm of England is an Empire...governed by one Supreme Head and King having the dignity and royal estate of the [[imperial Crown]] of the same'. This was in the context of the divorce of [[Catherine of Aragon]] and the [[English Reformation]], to emphasize that England had never accepted the quasi-imperial claims of the papacy.  Hence England and, by extension its modern successor state, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], is according to English law an Empire ruled by a King endowed with the imperial dignity. However, this has not led to the creation of the ''title'' of Emperor in England, nor in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], nor in the United Kingdom.\n\n====United Kingdom====\n[[File:George V of the united Kingdom.jpg|thumb|right|[[George V]], [[King of the United Kingdom]] and the [[British Dominions]], [[Emperor of India]].]]\nIn 1801, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] rejected the title of Emperor when offered. The only period when British monarchs held the title of ''Emperor'' in a dynastic succession started when the title [[Emperor of India|Empress of India]] was created for [[Queen Victoria]]. The government led by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]], conferred the additional title upon her by an Act of Parliament, reputedly to assuage the monarch's irritation at being, as a mere Queen, notionally inferior to her own daughter ([[Victoria, Princess Royal|Princess Victoria]], who was the wife of the [[Frederick III, German Emperor|reigning German Emperor]]); the Indian Imperial designation was also formally justified as the expression of Britain succeeding the former [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]] as [[suzerain]] over hundreds of [[princely state]]s. The [[Indian Independence Act 1947]] provided for the abolition of the use of the title \"[[Emperor of India]]\" by the [[British monarch]], but this was not executed by [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] until a [[royal proclamation]] on 22 June 1948. Despite this, George VI continued as king of India until 1950 and as king of Pakistan until his death in 1952.\n\nThe last Empress of India was George VI's wife, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]].\n\n===German Empire===\n{{Main|German Empire}}\n[[File:Kohner - Kaiser Wilhelm II.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], [[German Emperor]] and the [[King of Prussia]].]]\nUnder the guise of idealism giving way to realism, German nationalism rapidly shifted from its liberal and democratic character in 1848 to [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] prime minister [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s authoritarian ''[[Realpolitik]]''. Bismarck wanted to unify the rival German states to achieve his aim of a conservative, Prussian-dominated Germany. Three wars led to military successes and helped to convince German people to do this: the [[Second war of Schleswig]] against Denmark in 1864, the [[Austro-Prussian War]] against [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] in 1866, and the [[Franco-Prussian War]] against the [[Second French Empire]] in 1870\u201371. During the [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|Siege of Paris]] in 1871, the [[North German Confederation]], supported by its allies from [[southern Germany]], formed the [[German Empire]] with the proclamation of the Prussian king [[Wilhelm I of Germany|Wilhelm I]] as German Emperor in the Hall of Mirrors at the [[Palace of Versailles]], to the humiliation of the French, who ceased to resist only days later.\n\nAfter his death he was succeeded by his son [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick III]] who was only emperor for 99 days. In the same year his son [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] became the third emperor within a year. He was the last German emperor. After the empire's defeat in World War I the empire, called in German ''Reich'', had a president as head of state instead of an emperor. The use of the word ''Reich'' was abandoned after the Second World War.\n\n===Russia===\n[[File:Profile portrait of Catherine II by Fedor Rokotov (1763, Tretyakov gallery).jpg|thumb|Empress of Russia [[Catherine the Great]]]]\nIn 1472, the niece of the last Byzantine emperor, [[Sophia Paleologue|Sophia Palaiologina]], married [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]], grand prince of Moscow, who began championing the idea of Russia being the successor to the Byzantine Empire. This idea was represented more emphatically in the composition the monk Filofej addressed to their son [[Vasili III of Russia|Vasili III]]. After ending Muscovy's dependence on its [[Mongol]] overlords in 1480, Ivan III began the usage of the titles [[Tsar]] and Autocrat (''samoderzhets''). His insistence on recognition as such by the emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] since 1489 resulted in the granting of this recognition in 1514 by Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] to Vasili III. His son [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV]] emphatically crowned himself [[Tsar of Russia]] on 16 January 1547. The word \"Tsar\" derives from Latin Caesar, but this title was used in Russia as equivalent to \"King\"; the error occurred when medieval Russian clerics referred to the biblical Jewish kings with the same title that was used to designate Roman and Byzantine rulers \u2014 \"Caesar\".\n\nOn 31 October 1721, [[Peter the Great|Peter I]] was proclaimed Emperor by the Senate. The title used was Latin \"''Imperator''\", which is a westernizing form equivalent to the traditional Slavic title \"''Tsar''\". He based his claim partially upon a letter discovered in 1717 written in 1514 from Maximilian I to Vasili III, in which the Holy Roman Emperor used the term in referring to Vasili.\n\nA formal address to the ruling Russian monarch adopted thereafter was 'Your Imperial Majesty'. The crown prince was addressed as 'Your Imperial Highness'.\n\nThe title has not been used in Russia since the abdication of Emperor [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] on 15 March 1917.\n\n[[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] produced four reigning Empresses, all in the eighteenth century.\n\n===Serbia===\n{{main|Emperor of Serbia}}\nIn 1345, the Serbian King [[Stefan Dusan|Stefan Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an]] proclaimed himself Emperor ([[Tsar]]) and was crowned as such at [[Skopje]] on [[Easter]] 1346 by the newly created [[Serbian Patriarch]], and by the Patriarch of Bulgaria and the autocephalous Archbishop of Ohrid. His imperial title was recognized by Bulgaria and various other neighbors and trading partners but not by the Byzantine Empire. In its final simplified form, the Serbian imperial title read \"Emperor of Serbs and Greeks\" (''\u0446\u0430\u0440 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0430 \u0438 \u0413\u0440\u043a\u0430'' in modern Serbian). It was only employed by Stefan Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an and his son Stefan Uro\u0161 V in Serbia (until his death in 1371), after which it became extinct. A half-brother of Du\u0161an, [[Simeon Uro\u0161]], and then his son [[Jovan Uro\u0161]], claimed the same title, until the latter's abdication in 1373, while ruling as dynasts in [[Thessaly]]. The \"Greek\" component in the Serbian imperial title indicates both rulership over Greeks and the derivation of the imperial tradition from the Romans.\n\n==Emperors in the Americas==\n\n===Pre-Columbian traditions===\nThe Aztec and Inca traditions are unrelated to one another. Both were conquered under the reign of King [[Charles I of Spain]] who was simultaneously emperor-elect of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] during the fall of the Aztecs and fully emperor during the fall of the Incas. Incidentally by being king of Spain, he was also Roman (Byzantine) emperor in pretence through [[Andreas Palaiologos]]. The translations of their titles were provided by the Spanish.\n\n====Aztec Empire====\nThe only [[pre-Columbian]] North American rulers to be commonly called emperors were the ''[[Hueyi Tlatoani]]'' of the [[Aztec Empire]] (1375\u20131521). It was an [[elected monarchy]] chosen by the elite. In the Aztec Empire, there were three emperors: Those of [[Tenochtitlan]], [[Tlacopan]] and [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]]. The Emperors of Tenochtitlan and Texcoco were nominally equals, each receiving two-fifths of tribute from the vassal kingdoms, whereas the Emperor of Tlacopan was a junior member and only received one-fifth of the tribute, due to the fact that Tlacopan was a newcomer to the alliance. Despite the nominal equality, Tenochtitlan eventually assumed a [[de facto]] dominant role in the Empire, to the point that even the Emperors of Tlacopan and Texcoco would acknowledge Tenochtitlan's effective supremacy. Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] slew Emperor [[Cuauht\u00e9moc]] and installed puppet rulers who became vassals for Spain.\n\n====Inca Empire====\nThe only pre-Columbian South American rulers to be commonly called emperors were the ''[[Sapa Inca]]'' of the [[Inca Empire]] (1438\u20131533). Spanish conquistador [[Francisco Pizarro]], conquered the Inca for Spain, killed Emperor [[Atahualpa]], and installed puppets as well. Atahualpa may actually be considered a usurper as he had achieved power by [[Inca Civil War|killing his half-brother]] and he did not perform the required coronation with the imperial crown ''[[mascaipacha]]'' by the ''Huillaq Uma'' (high priest).\n\n===Post-Columbian Americas===\n\n====Brazil====\n[[File:Pedro Am\u00e9rico - D. Pedro II na abertura da Assembl\u00e9ia Geral.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], [[List of monarchs of Brazil|Emperor of Brazil]] in [[regalia]] at the opening of the General Assembly (oil painting by [[Pedro Am\u00e9rico]]).]]\nWhen [[Napoleon|Napoleon I]] ordered the invasion of Portugal in 1807 because it refused to join the [[Continental System]], the Portuguese [[House of Braganza|Braganzas]] moved their capital to [[Rio de Janeiro]] to avoid the fate of the [[Spanish Bourbons]] (Napoleon I arrested them and made his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] king). When the French general [[Jean-Andoche Junot]] arrived in [[Lisbon]], the Portuguese fleet had already left with all the local elite.\n\nIn 1808, under a British naval escort, the fleet arrived in Brazil. Later, in 1815, the Portuguese Prince Regent (since 1816 [[John VI of Portugal|King Jo\u00e3o VI]]) proclaimed the ''[[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]]'', as a union of three kingdoms, lifting Brazil from its colonial status.\n\nAfter the fall of Napoleon I and the [[liberal Wars|Liberal revolution]] in Portugal, the Portuguese royal family returned to Europe (1821). Prince Pedro of Braganza (King Jo\u00e3o's older son) stayed in South America acting as regent of the local kingdom, but, two years later in 1822, he proclaimed himself [[Peter I of Brazil|Pedro I]], first [[Emperor of Brazil]]. He did, however, recognize his father, Jo\u00e3o VI, as ''Titular Emperor of Brazil'' \u2014a purely honorific title\u2014until Jo\u00e3o VI's death in 1826.\n\nThe empire came to an end in 1889, with the overthrow of [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Pedro II]] (Pedro I's son and successor), when the Brazilian republic was proclaimed.\n\n====Haiti====\n[[Haiti]] was declared an empire by its ruler, [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], who made himself Jacques I, on 20 May 1805. He was assassinated the next year. Haiti again became an empire from 1849 to 1859 under [[Faustin Soulouque]].\n\n====Mexico====\n[[File:X-Large Portrait of Maximiliano.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Maximilian I of Mexico]], by [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]]]]\n\nIn Mexico, the [[First Mexican Empire]] was the first of two empires created. After the [[Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire|declaration of independence]] on September 15, 1821, it was the intention of the Mexican parliament to establish a commonwealth whereby the [[King]] of Spain, [[Fernando VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]], would also be [[Emperor of Mexico]], but in which both countries were to be governed by separate laws and with their own legislative offices. Should the king refuse the position, the law provided for a member of the [[House of Bourbon]] to accede to the Mexican throne.\n\nFerdinand VII, however, did not recognize the independence and said that Spain would not allow any other European prince to take the throne of Mexico. By request of Parliament, the president of the regency [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] was proclaimed emperor of Mexico on 12 July 1822 as [[Agust\u00edn I]]. Agust\u00edn de Iturbide was the general who helped secure Mexican independence from Spanish rule, but was overthrown by the [[Plan of Casa Mata]].\n\nIn 1863, the invading French, under [[Napoleon III]] (see above), in alliance with Mexican conservatives and [[Mexican nobility|nobility]], helped create the [[Second Mexican Empire]], and invited Archduke Maximilian, of the [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]], younger brother of the Austrian Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef I]], to become emperor [[Maximilian of Mexico|Maximilian I of Mexico]]. The childless Maximilian and his consort [[Charlotte of Belgium|Empress Carlota of Mexico]], daughter of [[Leopold I of Belgium]], adopted Agust\u00edn's grandsons Agustin and Salvador as his heirs to bolster his claim to the throne of Mexico. Maximilian and Carlota made [[Chapultepec Castle]] their home, which has been the only palace in North America to house sovereigns. After the withdrawal of French protection in 1867, Maximilian was captured and executed by the liberal forces of [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]].\n\nThis empire led to French influence in the Mexican culture and also [[French Mexican|immigration from France]], Belgium, and Switzerland to Mexico.\n\n==Persia (Iran)==\n{{further|Shah|King of Kings}}\n\nIn [[Iran|Persia]], from the time of [[Darius the Great]], Persian rulers used the title \"[[King of Kings]]\" (''[[Shah]]anshah'' in Persian) since they had dominion over peoples from the borders of India to the borders of Greece and Egypt. [[Alexander]] probably crowned himself ''shahanshah'' after conquering Persia{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, bringing the phrase ''basileus ton basileon'' to Greek. It is also known that [[Tigranes the Great]], king of Armenia, was named as the king of kings when he made his empire after defeating the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]]. Georgian title \"mephet'mephe\" has the same meaning.\n\nThe last ''shahanshah'' ([[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]]) was ousted in 1979 following the [[Iranian Revolution]]. ''Shahanshah'' is usually translated as ''king of kings'' or simply ''king'' for ancient rulers of the [[Achaemenid]], [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]], and [[Sassanid]] dynasties, and often shortened to ''shah'' for rulers since the [[Safavid]] dynasty in the 16th century.  Iranian rulers were typically regarded in the West as emperors.\n\n==Indian subcontinent==\n{{main|Chakravartin|Chhatrapati}}\n{{redirect|Samraat|the 1982 film|Samraat (film)}}\nThe Sanskrit word for emperor is ''Samr\u0101j'' or ''Samraat'' or ''Chakravartin''. This word has been used as an epithet of various Vedic deities, like Varuna, and has been attested in the [[Rigveda|Rig-Veda]], possibly the oldest compiled book among the Indo-Europeans. ''Chakravarti'' refers to the king of kings. A ''Chakravarti'' is not only a sovereign ruler but also has feudatories.\n\nTypically, in the later Vedic age, a Hindu high king (''[[Maharaja]]'') was only called ''Samraa\u1e6d'' after performing the Vedic ''[[Rajasuya]]'' sacrifice, enabling him by religious tradition to claim superiority over the other kings and princes. Another word for emperor is ''s\u0101rvabhaum\u0101''. The title of ''Samraa\u1e6d'' has been used by many rulers of the Indian subcontinent as claimed by the Hindu mythologies. In proper history, most historians call [[Chandragupta Maurya]] the first ''samraa\u1e6d'' (emperor) of the Indian subcontinent, because of the huge empire he ruled. The most famous emperor was his grandson [[Ashoka the Great]]. Other dynasties that are considered imperial by historians are the [[Kushan Empire|Kushanas]], [[Gupta Empire|Guptas]], [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara]], [[Kakatiya Empire|Kakatiya]], [[Hoysala Empire|Hoysala]] and the [[Chola Dynasty|Cholas]].\n\n[[Rudhramadevi]] (1259\u20131289) was one of the most prominent rulers of the [[Kakatiya dynasty]] on the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] Plateau, being one of the few ruling queens (empress) in Indian history.\n\nAfter India was invaded by the Mongol Khans and Turkic Muslims, the rulers of their major states on the subcontinent were titled ''[[Sultan|Sult\u0101n]]'' or ''[[Padishah|Badshah]]'' or ''[[Shah]]anshah''. In this manner, the only empress-regnant ever to have actually sat on the throne of Delhi was [[Razia Sultana|Razia Sultan]].  The [[Mughal Emperor]]s were the only Indian rulers for whom the term was consistently used by Western contemporaries. The emperors of the [[Maratha Empire]] were called ''[[Chhatrapati]]''. From 1877 to 1947 the [[monarch of the United Kingdom]] adopted the additional title of [[Emperor of India|Emperor/Empress of India]] (''Kaisar-i-Hind'').\n\n==Africa==\n\n===Ethiopia===\n{{More citations needed|date=February 2012}}\n{{Main|Emperor of Ethiopia}}\n[[File:Haile Selassie (1969).jpg|thumb|[[Haile Selassie]], [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] from 1930 to 1974.]]\nFrom 1270 the [[Solomonic dynasty]] of [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]] used the title {{transl|am|N\u0259gus\u00e4 N\u00e4g\u00e4st}}, literally \"King of Kings\". The use of the ''king of kings'' style began a millennium earlier in this region, however, with the title being used by the Kings of [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksum]], beginning with [[Sembrouthes]] in the 3rd century.\n\nAnother title used by this dynasty was {{transl|am|Itegue Zetopia}}. {{transl|am|Itegue}} translates as Empress, and was used by the only reigning Empress, [[Zauditu of Ethiopia|Zauditu]], along with the official title {{transl|am|Negiste Negest}} (\"Queen of Kings\").\n\nIn 1936, the Italian king [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]] claimed the title of [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] after Ethiopia was occupied by Italy during the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]]. After the defeat of the Italians by the British and the Ethiopians in 1941, [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]] was restored to the throne but Victor Emmanuel did not relinquish his claim to the title until 1943.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vadala|first=Alexander Attilio|date=2011-01-01|title=Elite Distinction and Regime Change: The Ethiopian Case|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/156913311x590664|journal=Comparative Sociology|volume=10|issue=4|pages=636\u2013653|doi=10.1163/156913311X590664|issn=1569-1330}}</ref>\n\n===Central African Empire===\n{{Main|Emperor of Central Africa}}\nIn 1976, President [[Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa]] of the [[Central African Republic]], proclaimed the country to be an autocratic [[Central African Empire]], and made himself Emperor as Bokassa I.

The claims of other East Asian monarchies to the title may have been accepted for diplomatic purposes, but it was not necessarily used in more general contexts.\n\n===China===\n{{Main|Emperor of China}}\n[[File:Qin Shi Huang BW.png|thumb|upright|Qin Shi Huang]]\n\nThe [[East Asian]] tradition is different from the Roman tradition, having arisen separately. What links them together is the use of the Chinese logographs \u7687 (''hu\u00e1ng'') and \u5e1d (''d\u00ec'') which together or individually are imperial. Because of the cultural influence of China, China's neighbors adopted these titles or had their native titles conform in ''[[hanzi]]''. Anyone who spoke to the emperor was to address the emperor as b\u00ecxi\u00e0 (\u965b\u4e0b, lit. the \"Bottom of the Steps\"), corresponding to \"[[Imperial Majesty (style)|Imperial Majesty]]\"; sh\u00e8ngsh\u00e0ng (\u8056\u4e0a, lit. Holy Highness); or w\u00e0nsu\u00ec (\u842c\u6b72, lit. \"You, of Ten Thousand Years\").\n\nIn 221 BC, [[Qin Shi Huang|Ying Zheng]], who was [[Chinese sovereign|king]] of [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] at the time, proclaimed himself ''[[Shi Huangdi]]'' (\u59cb\u7687\u5e1d), which translates as \"first emperor\". ''Huangdi'' is composed of ''huang'' (\"august one\", \u7687) and ''di'' (\"sage-king\", \u5e1d), and referred to legendary/mythological [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors|sage-emperors]] living several millennia earlier, of which three were ''huang'' and five were ''di''. Thus Zheng became [[Qin Shi Huang]], abolishing the system where the ''huang''/''di'' titles were reserved to dead and/or mythological rulers. Since then, the title \"king\" became a lower ranked title, and later divided into two grades. Although not as popular, the title \u738b ''wang'' (king or prince) was still used by many monarchs and dynasties in China up to the [[Taiping Rebellion|Taipings]] in the 19th century. \u738b is pronounced ''v\u01b0\u01a1ng'' in Vietnamese, ''\u014d'' in Japanese, and ''wang'' in Korean.\n\nThe imperial title continued in China until the [[Qing Dynasty]] was overthrown in 1912. The title was briefly revived from 12 December 1915 to 22 March 1916 by President [[Yuan Shikai]] and again in early July 1917 when General [[Zhang Xun (Qing loyalist)|Zhang Xun]] attempted to restore last Qing emperor [[Puyi]] to the throne. Puyi retained the title and attributes of a foreign emperor, as a personal status, until 1924. After the Japanese occupied [[Manchuria]] in 1931, they proclaimed it to be the Empire of [[Manchukuo]], and Puyi became emperor of Manchukuo. This empire ceased to exist when it was occupied by the Soviet [[Red Army]] in 1945.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Manchukuo|title=Manchukuo {{!}} puppet state created by Japan in China [1932]|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-06-02}}</ref>\n\nIn general, an emperor would have one empress (''Huanghou'', \u7687\u540e) at one time, although posthumous entitlement to empress for a [[concubines|concubine]] was not uncommon. The earliest known usage of ''huanghou'' was in the [[Han Dynasty]]. The emperor would generally select the empress from his [[concubine]]s. In subsequent dynasties, when the distinction between wife and concubine became more accentuated, the [[crown prince]] would have chosen an empress-designate before his reign. [[Early Imperial China|Imperial China]] produced only one reigning empress, [[Wu Zetian]], and she used the same Chinese title as an emperor (''Huangdi'', \u7687\u5e1d). Wu Zetian then reigned for about 15 years (690\u2013705 AD).\n\n===Japan===\n{{Main|Emperor of Japan}}\n[[File:Emperor Showa.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emperor Hirohito]] (\u88d5\u4ec1), or the [[Sh\u014dwa Emperor]] (\u662d\u548c\u5929\u7687), the last Japanese Emperor having ruled with prerogative powers, combined with assumption of divinity (photographed 1926).]]\n\nThe earliest Emperor recorded in [[Kojiki]] and [[Nihon Shoki]] is [[Emperor Jimmu]], who is said to be a descendant of [[Amaterasu]]'s grandson Ninigi who descended from Heaven ([[Tenson k\u014drin]]). If one believes what is written in [[Nihon Shoki]], the Emperors have an unbroken direct male lineage that goes back more than 2,600 years.\n\nIn ancient Japan, the earliest titles for the sovereign were either \u30e4\u30de\u30c8\u5927\u738b/\u5927\u541b (''yamato \u014dkimi'', Grand King of Yamato), \u502d\u738b/\u502d\u56fd\u738b (''wa\u014d''/''wakoku\u014d'', King of Wa, used externally), or \u6cbb\u5929\u4e0b\u5927\u738b (''amenoshita shiroshimesu \u014dkimi'', Grand King who rules all under heaven, used internally). As early as the 7th century, the word \u5929\u7687 (which can be read either as ''sumera no mikoto'', divine order, or as ''tenn\u014d'', Heavenly Emperor, the latter being derived from a Tang Chinese term referring to the Pole star around which all other stars revolve) began to be used. The earliest use of this term is found on a wooden slat, or ''[[mokkan]]'', unearthed in Asuka-mura, Nara Prefecture in 1998. The slat dated back to the reign of [[Emperor Tenmu]] and [[Empress Jit\u014d]]. The reading 'Tenn\u014d' has become the standard title for the Japanese sovereign up to the present age. The term \u5e1d (''mikado'', Emperor) is also found in literary sources.\n\nJapanese monarchs were given their official title by the Chinese emperor. The new Japanese monarch after coming into power would send a representative to China and receive the anointment. They would receive their official title on several golden plates of several meters tall. Since the Japanese monarchs changed their title to \u5929\u7687 (Heavenly Emperor) in 607, the Chinese emperor refused to anoint the Japanese king, thus, ending relations with Japan for the next few hundred years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/02/15/national/history/once-upon-a-time-china-anointed-a-king-of-japan/#.U2exSPldVRY|title=Once upon a time, China anointed a 'King of Japan' - The Japan Times|work=The Japan Times}}</ref> In the Japanese language, the word ''tenn\u014d'' is restricted to Japan's own monarch; ''k\u014dtei'' (\u7687\u5e1d) is used for foreign emperors. Historically, [[Daij\u014d-tenn\u014d|retired emperors]] often kept power over a child-emperor as de facto regent. For a long time, a ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' (formally the imperial [[Military dictatorship|military dictator]], but made hereditary) or an [[Sessh\u014d and Kampaku|imperial regent]] wielded actual political power. In fact, through much of Japanese history, the emperor has been little more than a figurehead. The [[Meiji Restoration]] restored practical abilities and the political system under [[Emperor Meiji]].<ref name=\"China p.79\">Henry Kissinger On China. 2011 p.79</ref> The last shogun [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu]] resigned in 1868.\n\nAfter World War II, all claims of divinity were dropped (see [[Ningen-sengen]]). The Diet acquired all prerogative powers of the Crown, reverting the latter to a ceremonial role.<ref>Although the [[Emperor of Japan]] is classified as constitutional monarch among political scientists, the current constitution of Japan defines him only as 'a symbol of the nation' and no subsequent legislation states his status as the [[head of state]] or equates the Crown synonymously with any government establishment.</ref> By the end of the 20th century, Japan was the only country with an emperor on the throne.\n\nAs of the early 21st century, Japan's succession law prohibits a female from ascending the throne. With the birth of a [[Aiko, Princess Toshi|daughter]] as the first child of the then-Crown Prince [[Naruhito]], Japan [[Naruhito#Marriage and family|considered abandoning that rule]]. However, shortly after the announcement that [[Kiko, Princess Akishino|Princess Kiko]] was pregnant with her third child, the proposal to alter the [[Imperial Household Law]] was suspended by then-Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]]. On 3 January 2007, as the child turned out to be a [[Prince Hisahito of Akishino|son]], Prime Minister [[Shinz\u014d Abe]] announced that he would drop the proposal.<ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070103/ap_on_re_as/japan_imperial_succession Japan Imperial Succession]</ref><!-- Keep this section updated in line with the page for Emperor of Japan -->\n\nEmperor [[Naruhito]] is the 126th monarch according to Japan's [[List of Emperors of Japan|traditional order of succession]]. The second and third in line of succession are [[Fumihito, Prince Akishino]] and [[Prince Hisahito]]. Historically, Japan has had eight reigning empresses who used the genderless title ''Tenn\u014d'', rather than the female consort title ''k\u014dg\u014d'' (\u7687\u540e) or ''ch\u016bg\u016b'' (\u4e2d\u5bae). There is ongoing discussion of the [[Japanese Imperial succession controversy]].\n<!--\nEmperor's highest wife is called Kogo, and the female emperor is not called Kogo but Tenno as her male counterparts. The female emperor should be called (\u5929\u7687 Ten-no) but Empress is usual in Western parlances. However, how should female emperor's husband be called? It has not been provided in Japan yet, because no female emperor was married when reigning: only single women (widows, unmarrieds) have been female emperors in history, or a wife or widow of an emperor or Crown Prince was made female Tenno (i. e., she was already Kogo or something like it).\n-->\nAlthough current Japanese law prohibits female succession, all Japanese emperors claim to trace their lineage to ''[[Amaterasu]]'', the Sun Goddess of the [[Shinto|Shint\u014d]] [[religion]]. <!-- Shinto religion does not recognize a \"supreme\" kami, rather, kami and humans alike are viewed equally.--> Thus, the Emperor is thought to be the highest authority of the Shinto religion, and one of his duties is to perform Shinto rituals for the people of Japan.\n\n===Korea===\n{{Main|Emperor of Korea}}\n\n[[File:Gojong of the Korean Empire 01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emperor Gojong]] of the [[Korean Empire]]]]\n\nSome rulers of [[Goguryeo]] (37 BC\u2013AD 668) used the title of ''[[Taewang]]'' ({{Korean|\ud0dc\uc655|\u592a\u738b|labels=no}}), literally translated as \"Greatest King\". The title of ''Taewang'' was also used by some rulers of [[Silla]] (57 BC\u2013AD 935), including [[Beopheung of Silla|Beopheung]] and [[Jinheung of Silla|Jinheung]].\n\nThe rulers of [[Balhae]] (698\u2013926) internally called themselves ''Seongwang'' ({{Korean|\uc131\uc655|\u8056\u738b |labels=no }}; lit. \"Holy King\").<ref>[[s:\u65b0\u5510\u66f8/\u5377219|New Book of Tang, vol. 209]]</ref>\n\nThe rulers of [[Goryeo]] (918\u20131392) used the titles of emperor and ''[[Son of Heaven]] of the East of the Ocean'' ({{Korean|\ud574\ub3d9\ucc9c\uc790|\u6d77\u6771\u5929\u5b50|labels=no}}).

He declared the [[Korean era name|era name]] of \"Gwangmu\" ({{Korean|\uad11\ubb34|\u5149\u6b66|labels=no}}), meaning \"Bright and Martial\". The Korean Empire lasted until 1910, when it was annexed by the [[Empire of Japan]].\n\n=== Mongolia ===\nThe title [[Khagan]] ([[Khan (title)|khan]] of khans or grand khan) was held by [[Genghis Khan]], founder of the [[Mongol Empire]] in 1206; he also formally took the Chinese title [[Emperor of China|''huangdi'']], as \"Genghis Emperor\" ({{zh |c = \u6210\u5409\u601d\u7687\u5e1d |p = Ch\u00e9ngj\u00eds\u012b Hu\u00e1ngd\u00ec |labels = no }} ). Only the Khagans from Genghis Khan to the fall of the [[Yuan dynasty]] in 1368 are normally referred to as Emperors in English.\n\n===Vietnam===\n[[File:B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i au pouvoir.jpg|thumb|upright|[[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]], the last Emperor of Vietnam]]\nNg\u00f4 Quy\u1ec1n, the first ruler of [[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]] as an independent state, used the title ''V\u01b0\u01a1ng'' (\u738b, ''King''). However, after the death of Ng\u00f4 Quy\u1ec1n, the country immersed in a civil war known as [[12 Warlords Rebellion|Chaos of the 12 Lords]] that lasted for over 20 years. In the end, [[\u0110inh B\u1ed9 L\u0129nh]] unified the country after defeating all the warlords and became the first ruler of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t to use the title ''Ho\u00e0ng \u0110\u1ebf'' (\u7687\u5e1d, ''Emperor'') in 968. Succeeding rulers in Vietnam then continued to use this Emperor title until 1806 when this title was stopped being used for a century.\n\n\u0110inh B\u1ed9 L\u0129nh wasn't the first to claim the title of ''\u0110\u1ebf'' (\u5e1d, ''Emperor''). Before him, [[L\u00fd B\u00ed]] and [[Mai Th\u00fac Loan]] also claimed this title. However, their rules were very short lived.\n\nThe Vietnamese emperors also gave this title to their ancestors who were lords or influence figures in the previous dynasty like the Chinese emperors. This practice is one of many indications of the idea \"Vietnam's equality with China\" which remained intact up to the twentieth century.<ref>{{citation|author=Tuyet Nhung Tran, Anthony J. S. Reid|title=Vi\u1ec7t Nam Borderless Histories|year=2006|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, Wisconsin|isbn=978-0-299-21770-9|ref=harv|page=67}}</ref>\n\nIn 1802 the newly established Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty requested canonization from Chinese [[Jiaqing Emperor]] and received the title ''Qu\u1ed1c V\u01b0\u01a1ng'' (\u570b\u738b, ''King of a State)'' and the name of the country as ''An Nam'' (\u5b89\u5357) instead ''\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t'' (\u5927\u8d8a). To avoid unnecessary armed conflicts, the Vietnamese rulers accepted this in diplomatic relation and use the title Emperor only domestically. However, Vietnamese rulers never accepted the vassalage relationship with China and always refused to come to Chinese courts to pay homage to Chinese rulers (a sign of vassalage acceptance). China waged a number of wars against Vietnam throughout history, and after each failure, settled for the tributary relationship. The Yuan dynasty under [[Kublai Khan]] waged three wars against Vietnam to force it into a vassalage relationship but after successive failures, [[Kublai Khan]]'s successor, [[Tem\u00fcr Khan]], finally settled for a tributary relationship with Vietnam. Vietnam sent tributary missions to China once in three years (with some periods of disruptions) until the 19th century, [[Sino-French War]] France replaced China in control of northern Vietnam.\n\nThe emperors of the last dynasty of Vietnam continued to hold this title until the French conquered Vietnam. The emperor, however, was then a puppet figure only and could easily be disposed of by the French for more pro-France figure. Japan took Vietnam from France and the [[Axis powers|Axis]]-occupied Vietnam was declared an [[Empire of Vietnam|empire]] by the Japanese in March 1945. The line of emperors came to an end with [[B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i]], who was deposed after the war, although he later served as head of state of [[South Vietnam]] from 1949-55.\n\n==Oceania==\nThe lone holders of the imperial title in [[Oceania]] were the heads of the semi-mythical [[Tu\u02bbi Tonga Empire]].\n\n==Fictional uses==\nThere have been many fictional emperors in movies and books.

When there are runners safely on base, there are \"runners aboard\".\n\n===ace===\n:The best [[starting pitcher]] on the team, who is usually first on a pitching rotation.\n\n===advance a runner===\n:To move a runner ahead safely to another base, often the conscious strategy of a team that plays [[Glossary of baseball (S)#small ball|small ball]]. If a batter does make an out, his [[Glossary of baseball (P)#plate appearance|plate appearance]] will have been less negative if he still got a runner into [[Glossary of baseball (S)#scoring position|scoring position]]; in certain situations, batters even ''deliberately'' [[Glossary of baseball (S)#sacrifice bunt|sacrifice]] themselves.\n\n===ahead in the count===\n:*A term that signifies whether the batter or pitcher possesses the advantage in an at-bat. If a pitcher has thrown more strikes than balls to a batter in an at-bat, the pitcher is ahead in the count; conversely, if the pitcher has thrown more balls than strikes, the batter is ahead.\n:*If the pitcher is ahead in the count, the batter is in increasing danger of striking out. If the batter is ahead, the pitcher is in increasing danger of walking him.\n\n===aim the ball===\n:Sometimes when a pitcher tries a bit too carefully to control the location of a pitch, he is said to \"aim the ball\" instead of throwing it. This is a different meaning of \"aim\" from the situation in which a pitcher aims a pitch at a batter in an effort to hit him.\n\n===airmail===\n:Slang for a fielder's errant throw that sails high over the player to whom he intended to throw the ball. For example, if the third baseman were to throw the ball over the first baseman's head and into the stands, he is said to have \"airmailed\" the throw. \"But Chandler airmailed her throw to third into the dugout{{nbsp}}...\"\n\n===alabaster blast===\n:Coined by Pittsburgh Pirates announcer Bob Prince, a [[Glossary of baseball (B)#Baltimore Chop|Baltimore Chop]] would bounce higher than normal due to the extraordinarily hard dirt at Forbes Field.\n\n===alley===\n:Also \"gap\" or \"power alley\", the space between the leftfielder and the centerfielder, or the rightfielder and centerfielder. If a batter hits the ball \"up the alley\" with enough force, he has a stronger chance of advancing beyond first base and being credited with an extra-base hit. Typically, this is an appropriate term for describing a line drive or ground ball; fly balls that hit the wall are not normally described this way.\n\n===American League (AL)===\n{{Main|American League}}\n:The junior of the two existing [[Major League Baseball|Major Leagues]].\n\n===American League Championship Series (ALCS)===\n{{Main|American League Championship Series}}\n:The season's final best-of-seven playoff series which determines the American League team that will advance to the [[World Series]]. The ALCS\u2013like its analog, the [[National League Championship Series|NLCS]]\u2013came into being in 1969. The ALCS winner takes the American League [[pennant (sports)|pennant]] and the title of American League Champion for that season. The winners of the [[American League Division Series]] have met in the ALCS since 1995.\n\n===American League Division Series (ALDS)===\n{{Main|American League Division Series}}\n:The first round of the league playoffs. The winners of the three divisions and the winner of the Wild Card Game are paired off in two best-of-five series, the winners of which advance to the ALCS.\n\n===Annie Oakley===\n:A free ticket to attendance at  ballgame or to first base (a \"free pass\" or \"base on balls\").\n\n===appeal play===\n{{Main|appeal play}}\n:A play in which the defense has an opportunity to gain a favorable ruling from an umpire by addressing a mistake by the offense or seeking the input of another umpire.

At the commencement of the [[Revolutionary War (United States)|Revolutionary War]] in 1776, he was a \"gentleman cadet\" in Captain John Allen Thomas' \"Independent\" Company, of St. Mary's county and is mentioned in a letter from Captain Thomas to the [[Committees of safety (American Revolution)|Council of Safety]], dated March 8, 1776, as \"deserving notice.\" Carbery was appointed second lieutenant in [[Hartley's Additional Continental Regiment|Colonel Hartley's regiment of Continental Troops]], January 24, 1777. He was promoted to first lieutenant on or about September 19, 1777, and captain on November 30, 1778. (The regiment was designated as the [[11th Pennsylvania Regiment|11th Pennsylvania]] on January 13, 1779). He was wounded on August 13, 1779, and retired January 17, 1781. He was a captain in Major Henry Gaither's battalion of the \"Levies of 1791,\" and he served under [[Arthur St. Clair|General St. Clair]] against the [[Miami people|Miami Indians]] in November, 1791. Carbery became captain of infantry, U.S. Army, on March 16, 1792, and was assigned to the [[Legion of the United States|4th sub-legion]] September 4, 1792. He resigned February 10, 1794.\n\nHenry Carbery was appointed adjutant general of the Maryland State Militia October 6, 1794, and served under Governors Stone, Henry, Ogle, Mercer, [[Robert Bowie]] (1803) and Wright. He was made colonel of the 36th U.S. Infantry, March 22, 1813, and resigned March 4, 1815. He died at his residence, near Georgetown, D.C. on May 26, 1822, at 66 years old.\n\nThe following tribute to Maryland's first adjutant general, both as a soldier and as a man, was written by Hon. [[James Brice]], of Annapolis, (president of the Governor's Council and acting governor upon the death of Governor Plater in 1792), in a communication to His Excellency, [[George Washington]] and is a copy of the original document: \n\n<blockquote>Maryland Annapolis February 18th, 1792. In Council. Sir: Presuming that the defence of the frontiers will require an augmented force, and that Military promotions will of course take place, we beg leave to address you in favor of Mr. Henry Carbery, who served in the late expedition against the Indians as Senior Captain in the Battalion of levies from this State, and has returned with the reputation of having exhibited an exemplary conduct as well in the unfortunate action as during the Campaign in general. These testimonies joined to the knowledge we have of his respectable deportment in private life, have impressed us with the desire of procuring him the further notice of your Excellency. We believe him to be among those men who by a prediction for the Military life are led to a closer study of the duties of that profession than officers of his rank in general impose on themselves. We beg leave Sir, to add, that during the former war he occasionally commanded a party of Cavalry against the Indians, and seems confident of acquitting himself well if he should be honored with a Command of that kind in the proposed arrangements. With the highest respect we have the honor to be your excellency's Most Obedt. Hble. Servt. (Signed) James Brice His Excellency, the President of the United States.</blockquote>\n\n=== Samuel Turbutt Wright (1807\u20131810) ===\nSamuel T.

Wright was appointed adjutant general of the Maryland State Militia 18 July 1807, and was authorized by Governor Robert Wright, in July, 1807, to detach 5,863 men from the militia, as Maryland's quota of 100,000 men ordered by the President to be ready to take the field at a moment's notice, on account of the critical status of foreign relations at that time. He served under Governors Wright and Edward Lloyd.

Sir: Presuming that the defence of the frontiers will require an augmented force, and that Military promotions will of course take place, we beg leave to address you in favor of Mr. Henry Carbery, who served in the late expedition against the Indians as Senior Captain in the Battalion of levies from this State, and has returned with the reputation of having exhibited an exemplary conduct as well in the unfortunate action as during the Campaign in general. These testimonies joined to the knowledge we have of his respectable deportment in private life, have impressed us with the desire of procuring him the further notice of your Excellency. We believe him to be among those men who by a prediction for the Military life are led to a closer study of the duties of that profession than officers of his rank in general impose on themselves. We beg leave Sir, to add, that during the former war he occasionally commanded a party of Cavalry against the Indians, and seems confident of acquitting himself well if he should be honored with a Command of that kind in the proposed arrangements. With the highest respect we have the honor to be your excellency's Most Obedt. Hble. Servt.
