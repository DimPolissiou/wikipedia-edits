The Main Boreholes show eustatic changes on the marine conditions, with a retreat of the sea level, leading to the appearance of vegetation and abundant pollen on the uppermost parts of the formation. The regressive phase of sea level is represented by the [[Komorowo Beds]] and\nUpper Slawecin Beds along with the Drzewica Formation. As the level of the sea recovered on the Toarcian, mostly of the setting turn out to be a bathial marine bottom.<ref>Feldman-Olszewska, A. (1997).

Labour's vision, the IFS said, \"is of a state not so dissimilar to those seen in many other successful Western European economies\" and presumed that the manifesto should be seen as \"a long-term prospectus for change rather than a realistic deliverable plan for a five-year parliament\".<ref name=\"IFSTK\" /> They said the Liberal Democrat manifesto is not as radical as the Labour manifesto but was a \"decisive move away from the policies of the past decade\".<ref name=\"IFSFinTimes\" /><ref name=\"IFSTimes\" /><ref name=\"IFS1\" /><ref name=\"IFS2\" />\n\nThe Conservative manifesto was criticised for a commitment not to raise rates of income tax, [[National Insurance|NICs]] or [[Value-added tax|VAT]] as this put a significant constraint on reactions to events that might affect government finances. One such event could be the \"die in a ditch\" promise to terminate the Brexit transition period by the end of 2020, which risked harming the economy.<ref name=\"IFSTK\" /> The IFS also stated that it is \"highly likely\" spending under a Conservative government would be higher than in that party's manifesto, partly due to a number of uncosted commitments.<ref name=\"IFSGuard\" /><ref name=\"IFSFinTimes\" /><ref name=\"IFSTimes\" /><ref name=\"IFS1\" /><ref name=\"IFS2\" /> Outside of commitments to the NHS, the proposals would leave public service spending 14% lower in 2023\u20132024 than it was in 2010\u20132011, which the IFS described as \"no more austerity perhaps, but an awful lot of it baked in\".<ref name=\"IFSStand\">{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/tax-rises-coming-whoever-wins-the-election-leading-economists-warn-a4299121.html |title=Tax rises coming whoever wins the election, leading economists warn |date=27 November 2019 |newspaper=Evening Standard |access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe IFS stated it had \"serious doubt\" that tax rises proposed would raise the amount Labour suggested, and said that they would need to introduce more broad based tax increases. They assess that the public sector does not have the capacity to increase investment spending as Labour would want. The IFS assesses the claim that tax rises will only hit the top 5% of earners, as \"certainly progressive\", but \"clearly not true\", with those under that threshold impacted by changes to the marriage allowance, taxes on dividends or capital gains, and lower wages/higher prices that might be passed on from corporation tax changes. Some of Labour's proposals are described as \"huge and complex undertakings\", where significant care is required in implementation. The IFS is particularly critical of the policy to compensate the so-called \"WASPI women\", announced after the manifesto, which is a \u00a358bn promise to women who are \"relatively well off on average\" and will result in public finances going off target. They said that Labour's manifesto would not increase UK public spending as a share of national income above Germany.<ref name=\"IFSGuard\" /><ref name=\"IFSFinTimes\" /><ref name=\"IFSTimes\" /><ref name=\"IFS1\" /><ref name=\"IFS2\" /> They found that Labour's plan to spend and invest would boost economic growth, but the impact of tax rises, government regulation, nationalisations and the inclusive ownership fund could reduce growth, meaning the overall impact of Labour's plan on growth is uncertain.<ref name=\"IFSTK\" /><ref name=\"IFS1\" />\n\nThe IFS described the Liberal Democrats' plans as a \"radical\" tax and spend package, and said that the proposals would require lower borrowing than Conservative or Labour plans. The report said they were the only party whose proposals would put debt \"on a decisively downward path\", praising their plan to put 1p on income tax to go to the NHS as \"simple, progressive and would raise a secure level of revenue\".

One such event could be the \"die in a ditch\" promise to terminate the Brexit transition period by the end of 2020, which risked harming the economy.<ref name=\"IFSTK\" /> The IFS also stated that it is \"highly likely\" spending under a Conservative government would be higher than in that party's manifesto, partly due to a number of uncosted commitments.<ref name=\"IFSGuard\" /><ref name=\"IFSFinTimes\" /><ref name=\"IFSTimes\" /><ref name=\"IFS1\" /><ref name=\"IFS2\" /> Outside of commitments to the NHS, the proposals would leave public service spending 14% lower in 2023\u20132024 than it was in 2010\u20132011, which the IFS described as \"no more austerity perhaps, but an awful lot of it baked in\".<ref name=\"IFSStand\">{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/tax-rises-coming-whoever-wins-the-election-leading-economists-warn-a4299121.html |title=Tax rises coming whoever wins the election, leading economists warn |date=27 November 2019 |newspaper=Evening Standard |access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe IFS stated it had \"serious doubt\" that tax rises proposed would raise the amount Labour suggested, and said that they would need to introduce more broad based tax increases. They assess that the public sector does not have the capacity to increase investment spending as Labour would want. The IFS assesses the claim that tax rises will only hit the top 5% of earners, as \"certainly progressive\", but \"clearly not true\", with those under that threshold impacted by changes to the marriage allowance, taxes on dividends or capital gains, and lower wages/higher prices that might be passed on from corporation tax changes. Some of Labour's proposals are described as \"huge and complex undertakings\", where significant care is required in implementation. The IFS is particularly critical of the policy to compensate the so-called \"WASPI women\", announced after the manifesto, which is a \u00a358bn promise to women who are \"relatively well off on average\" and will result in public finances going off target. They said that Labour's manifesto would not increase UK public spending as a share of national income above Germany.<ref name=\"IFSGuard\" /><ref name=\"IFSFinTimes\" /><ref name=\"IFSTimes\" /><ref name=\"IFS1\" /><ref name=\"IFS2\" /> They found that Labour's plan to spend and invest would boost economic growth, but the impact of tax rises, government regulation, nationalisations and the inclusive ownership fund could reduce growth, meaning the overall impact of Labour's plan on growth is uncertain.<ref name=\"IFSTK\" /><ref name=\"IFS1\" />\n\nThe IFS described the Liberal Democrats' plans as a \"radical\" tax and spend package, and said that the proposals would require lower borrowing than Conservative or Labour plans. The report said they were the only party whose proposals would put debt \"on a decisively downward path\", praising their plan to put 1p on income tax to go to the NHS as \"simple, progressive and would raise a secure level of revenue\". The IFS also said plans to \"virtually quintuple\" current spending levels on universal free childcare amounted to \"creating a whole new leg of the universal welfare state\".<ref name=\"IFSStand2\">{{Cite newspaper|title=IFS key verdicts on the party spending plans|date=28 November 2019|newspaper=Evening Standard|page=5|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"IFS1\" />\n\nThe IFS said that the SNP's manifesto was not costed. Their proposals on spending increases and tax cuts would mean the UK government would have to borrow to cover day-to-day spending. They conclude that the SNP's plans for Scottish independence would likely require increased austerity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/columnists/why-snp-election-manifesto-is-overshadowed-by-austerity-of-independent-scotland-ifs-1-5056102|title=Why SNP election manifesto is overshadowed by austerity of independent Scotland \u2013 IFS|website=www.scotsman.com}}</ref>\n\n==== Other issues ====\nThe Conservative Party proposed increasing spending on the NHS, although not as much of an increase as Labour and Liberal Democrat proposals.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50521323|title=Your Questions: Are there record numbers of doctors and nurses? |date=24 November 2019 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref> They also proposed increased funding for childcare and on the environment.

A typical entry lists information in the following sequence:\n* Name, age, country of citizenship at birth, subsequent country of citizenship (if applicable), reason for notability, cause of death (if known), and reference.\n<!--* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines below when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Please include a reference to a reliable source. If a Wikipedia article for the deceased does not yet exist, please reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, please consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the deceased \"notable\". If you report the death of a subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, please consider starting one, provided that the deceased is notable. Please include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid overlinking.

The fort has existed at least since the 10th century, and the inscriptions and monuments found within what is now the fort campus indicate that it may have existed as early as the beginning of the 6th century. The fort has been controlled by a number of different rulers in its history.\n\nThe present-day fort consists of a defensive structure and two main palaces, [[Gujari]] Mahal and Man Mandir, built by [[Man Singh Tomar]] (reigned 1486\u20131516 CE).

He was cured of leprosy, when a sage named Gwalipa offered him the water from a sacred pond, which now lies within the fort. The grateful king constructed a fort, and named it after the sage. The sage bestowed the title Pal (\"protector\") upon the king, and told him that the fort would remain in his family's possession, as long as they bear this title. 83 descendants of Suraj Sen Pal controlled the fort, but the 84th, named Tej Karan, lost it.{{sfn|Paul E.

The [[Teli ka Mandir]], now located within the fort, was built by the [[Gurjara-Pratihara]]s in the 9th century.{{sfn|Paul E. Schellinger|Robert M.

The [[Kachchhapaghata dynasty|Kachchhapaghatas]] controlled the fort at this time, most probably as feudatories of the [[Chandela]]s.{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|p=59}} From 11th century onwards, the Muslim dynasties attacked the fort several times. In 1022 CE, [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] besieged the fort for four days. According to ''Tabaqat-i-Akbari'', he lifted the siege in return for a tribute of 35 elephants.{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|pp=80-82}} The [[Ghurid]] general [[Qutb al-Din Aibak]], who later became a ruler of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], captured the fort in 1196 after a long siege. The Delhi Sultanate lost the fort for a short period before it was recaptured by [[Iltumish]] in 1232 CE.{{sfn|Paul E. Schellinger|Robert M. Salkin|1994|p=312}}\n\nIn 1398, the fort came under the control of the [[Tomaras of Gwalior|Tomars]]. The most distinguished of the Tomar rulers was [[Man Singh Tomar|Maan Singh]], who commissioned several monuments within the fort.{{sfn|Paul E. Schellinger|Robert M. Salkin|1994|p=312}} The Delhi Sultan [[Sikander Lodi]] tried to capture the fort in 1505 but was unsuccessful. Another attack, by his son [[Ibrahim Lodi]] in 1516, resulted in Maan Singh's death.

The fort has existed at least since the 10th century, and the inscriptions and monuments found within what is now the fort campus indicate that it may have existed as early as the beginning of the 6th century. The fort has been controlled by a number of different rulers in its history.\n\nThe present-day fort consists of a defensive structure and two main palaces, [[Gujari]] Mahal and Man Mandir, built by [[Man Singh Tomar]] (reigned 1486\u20131516 CE). The Gujari Mahal palace was built for Queen Mrignayani. It is now an archaeological museum.

He was cured of leprosy, when a sage named Gwalipa offered him the water from a sacred pond, which now lies within the fort. The grateful king constructed a fort, and named it after the sage. The sage bestowed the title Pal (\"protector\") upon the king, and told him that the fort would remain in his family's possession, as long as they bear this title. 83 descendants of Suraj Sen Pal controlled the fort, but the 84th, named Tej Karan, lost it.{{sfn|Paul E.

The [[Teli ka Mandir]], now located within the fort, was built by the [[Gurjara-Pratihara]]s in the 9th century.{{sfn|Paul E. Schellinger|Robert M. Salkin|1994|p=312}}\n\nThe fort definitely existed by the 10th century, when it is first mentioned in the historical records. The [[Kachchhapaghata dynasty|Kachchhapaghatas]] controlled the fort at this time, most probably as feudatories of the [[Chandela]]s.{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|p=59}} From 11th century onwards, the Muslim dynasties attacked the fort several times. In 1022 CE, [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] besieged the fort for four days. According to ''Tabaqat-i-Akbari'', he lifted the siege in return for a tribute of 35 elephants.{{sfn|Sisirkumar Mitra|1977|pp=80-82}} The [[Ghurid]] general [[Qutb al-Din Aibak]], who later became a ruler of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], captured the fort in 1196 after a long siege. The Delhi Sultanate lost the fort for a short period before it was recaptured by [[Iltumish]] in 1232 CE.{{sfn|Paul E. Schellinger|Robert M. Salkin|1994|p=312}}\n\nIn 1398, the fort came under the control of the [[Tomaras of Gwalior|Tomars]]. The most distinguished of the Tomar rulers was [[Man Singh Tomar|Maan Singh]], who commissioned several monuments within the fort.{{sfn|Paul E. Schellinger|Robert M. Salkin|1994|p=312}} The Delhi Sultan [[Sikander Lodi]] tried to capture the fort in 1505 but was unsuccessful. Another attack, by his son [[Ibrahim Lodi]] in 1516, resulted in Maan Singh's death. The Tomars ultimately surrendered the fort to the Delhi Sultanate after a year-long siege.{{sfn|Paul E. Schellinger|Robert M.

The Mughals lost the fort to [[Sher Shah Suri]] in 1542. Afterwards, the fort was used by [[Hemu]], the Hindu general and, later, the Hindu ruler of Delhi, as his base for his many campaigns, but Babur's grandson [[Akbar]] recaptured it in 1558.{{sfn|Paul E.

By 1886, the British were in complete control of India, and the fort no longer had any strategic importance to them. Therefore, they handed over the fort to the Scindia family.
