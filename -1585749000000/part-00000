Although Bizzarrini is usually credited as the designer of the 250 GTO, he and most other Ferrari engineers were fired in 1962 due to [[History of Ferrari#1961 - The great walkout|a dispute with Enzo Ferrari]] . Further development of the 250 GTO was overseen by new engineer [[Mauro Forghieri]], who worked with [[Scaglietti]] to continue development of the body.<ref name=\"Pourret1987\">{{Citation|title=Ferrari 250 GT Competition Cars|last1=Pourret|first1=Jess G.|year=1987|publisher=Haynes|isbn=0-85429-556-9}}</ref> The design of the car was a collaborative effort and cannot be ascribed to a single person.\n\nThe mechanical aspects of 250 GTO were relatively conservative at the time of its introduction, using engine and chassis components that were proven in earlier competition cars. The chassis of the car was based on that of the [[Ferrari 250#250 GT SWB|250 GT SWB]], with minor differences in frame structure and geometry to reduce weight, stiffen and lower the chassis. The car was built around a hand-welded oval tube frame, incorporating [[Control arm|A-arm front suspension]], rear [[Beam axle#Live axle vs Dead axle|live-axle]] with [[Watt's linkage#Automobile suspension|Watt's linkage]], [[disc brake]]s, and [[Borrani]] wire wheels. The engine was the race-proven Tipo 168/62 Comp. {{cvt|2953|cc|L|1|order=flip}} [[V12 engine|V12]] as used in the [[Ferrari TR#250 Testa Rossa|250 Testa Rossa]] Le Mans winner. An all-alloy design utilizing a [[dry sump]] and six 38DCN [[Weber carburetors]], it produced approximately {{convert|300|PS|bhp kW|0|abbr=on}} at 7500 rpm and {{convert|30|kgm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} at 5500 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]]. The gearbox was a new 5-speed unit with [[Porsche]]-type [[synchromesh]].<ref name=\"Pourret1987\" />\n\n[[Bizzarrini]] focused his design effort on the car's aerodynamics in an attempt to improve top speed and stability. The body design was informed by wind tunnel testing at [[Pisa University]] as well as road and track testing with several prototypes. The resulting all-aluminium bodywork had a long, low nose, small radiator inlet, and distinctive air intakes on the nose with removable covers. Early testing resulted in the addition of a rear [[Spoiler (car)|spoiler]]. The underside of the car was covered by a belly pan and had an additional spoiler underneath formed by the fuel tank cover. The aerodynamic design of the 250 GTO was a major technical innovation compared to previous Ferrari GT cars, and in line with contemporary developments by manufacturers such as [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]]. The bodies were constructed by [[Scaglietti]], with the exception of early prototypes with bodies constructed in-house by Ferrari or by [[Pininfarina]] (in the case of s/n 2643 GT). Cars were produced in many colours, with the most famous being the bright red \"Rosso Cina\".<ref name=\"Pourret1987\" />\n[[File:Ferrari 250 GTO ser. no. 3647GT interior.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of 250 GTO (chassis 3647GT)|alt=Looking through open driver's window of a right-hand-drive car, showing brown steering wheel with three metal spokes, gear lever and dashboard]]\nThe [[Minimalism|minimalist]] interior of a 250 GTO reflects the car's racing intentions.

It was built to competition specification, which included a reinforced chassis, a competition gearbox and a ''Tipo 168/61'' 3.0 L engine tuned to 300 bhp, equipped with dry sump lubrication and six Weber 38 DCN carburetors. Pininfarina constructed a new lightweight aluminum alloy body for this prototype, which resembled that of the [[Ferrari America#400 Superamerica|400 Super America]] coupe. 2643 GT was entered by Scuderia Ferrari in the [[1961 24 Hours of Le Mans|1961 24 hours of Le Mans]], driven by [[Fernand Tavano]] and [[Giancarlo Baghetti]]. It finished 8th overall. During the course of the race, Ferrari engineers gathered information about the performance of the car which was used to modify and improve it, including the addition of a rear spoiler. During the Le Mans race, 2643 GT suffered from high-speed instability, possibly due to the front end design.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\"Pourret1987\" /> Following Le Mans, 2643 GT returned to the factory, where it was used for more testing. The prototype raced again at the [[1962 Daytona 3 Hours|1962 Daytona Continental 3 hours]], where it placed 4th overall and 1st in the GT class driven by [[Stirling Moss]].<ref name=\":10\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://drive-my.com/en/test-drive/item/2180-the-green-ferrari-250-gto-test.html|title=The green Ferrari 250 GTO - track test|last=Doherty|first=Paul|date=14 April 2015|website=Drive|language=en-gb|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Subsequently, it was sold to [[North American Racing Team|N.A.R.T.]] and a succession of private owners.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.barchetta.cc/english/All.Ferraris/Detail/2643GT.250GT.htm|title=250 GT SWB Prototype Sperimentale s/n 2643GT|website=www.barchetta.cc|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n\nThe second prototype was constructed from a 1960 250 GT SWB, chassis 2053 GT.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\"Pourret1987\" /><ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.barchetta.cc/english/All.Ferraris/Detail/2053GT.250GT.htm|title=250 GT s/n 2053GT|website=www.barchetta.cc|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Alternatively, some sources have claimed that a 250 GT Boano (0523GT) or a 1959 250 GT SWB (1791GT) was used as the donor car.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.autoweek.com/car-life/a1902341/exactly-how-many-ferrari-250-gtos-were-built/|title=Exactly how many Ferrari 250 GTOs were built?|last=Severson|first=Aaron|date=31 July 2014|website=Autoweek|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ferrari.com/english/gt_sport cars/classiche/all_models/Pages/articles_250_gto.aspx|title=Focus on: 250 GTO (1962)|last=|first=|date=|website=ferrari.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116014343/https://www.ferrari.com/english/gt_sport%20cars/classiche/all_models/Pages/articles_250_gto.aspx|archive-date=2012-11-16|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> This prototype was created entirely by the Ferrari factory's racing department under the oversight of Giotto Bizzarrini, including the bodywork. The original chassis was extensively modified, including relocation of the engine mounts lower and further back in the frame. A competition-specification engine was fitted, including six Weber 38 DCN carburetors. The bodywork seen on the second prototype in period photos was rough, unfinished aluminum. The body's ungainly appearance lead the Ferrari team to nickname it \"Il Mostro\" (the Monster) and the press to call it \"The Anteater.\" Hammer marks, weld beads and bolted or riveted panels could be seen throughout, evidence of the continual modifications performed during factory testing in 1961. Although the body was crudely formed, it displayed features that would be seen in the production 250 GTO, including the overall profile of a low hood and high rear, triple front air intakes, engine bay cooling slots in the front fenders and plexiglass-covered headlights. The interior was hastily constructed and even more minimal than in the production 250 GTO, with scattered instrumentation and a bare aluminum dashboard.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\"Pourret1987\" />\n\nThe second prototype was tested at [[Autodromo Nazionale di Monza|Monza]] in September 1961 by Stirling Moss. Results were promising, as the prototype was able to lap the circuit faster than a 250 GT SWB. However, the high speed stability issues seen during testing of the first prototype remained. Shortly after this test, construction of the first production 250 GTOs began in late 1961 with chassis 3223 GT and 3387 GT. <ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\"Pourret1987\" />\n\nAs 2053 GT was no longer needed for testing, the experimental body was scrapped and the chassis given a 250 GT SWB style body. In this form it was sold to [[Jacques Swaters]]. It crashed during the [[6 Hours of N\u00fcrburgring|1962 N\u00fcrburgring 1000 km]] and was then rebodied by [[Carrozzeria Sports Cars]].

Three new cars were produced to the 1964 specification, and four earlier 250 GTOs were retrofitted to it by the factory.<ref name=\"Pourret1987\" />  This redesign was intended to maintain the GTO's competitiveness for one more year, as the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] decided to not approve the [[Ferrari 250 LM|250 LM]] for GT-class racing during the 1964 season. The Ferrari engineers incorporated many of the 250LM's aerodynamic features into the 1964 GTO. This resulted in a visual similarity between the two models, even though the GTO does not share the 250LM's [[Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|mid engine rear wheel drive]] layout. The factory also made minor modifications to the engine, gearbox, chassis, suspension and interior. Despite these changes, the overall performance improvement was slight. The GTO '64 still saw some racing success with factory and privateer teams, including an overall win at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] in 1964 by [[Phil Hill]] and [[Pedro Rodr\u00edguez (racing driver)|Pedro Rodriguez]] driving for [[North American Racing Team|NART]]. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mallepelle|first=Paolo|date=1983|title=The 64 GTO|url=|journal=Cavallino|volume=16|pages=22\u201328|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/MO18/Monterey/lots/r0117-1962-ferrari-250-gto-by-scaglietti/695912|title=RM Sotheby's - 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO by Scaglietti {{!}} Monterey 2018|date=2018-08-26|work=RM Sotheby's|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/results/Daytona-1964-02-16.html|title=Daytona 2000 Kilometres 1964 - Race Results - Racing Sports Cars|website=www.racingsportscars.com|access-date=2018-08-31}}</ref>\n\nThree 330 GTO specials were made using the 250 GTO chassis and body fitted with [[Ferrari America#400 Superamerica|400 Superamerica]] 4.0L motors.

These homologation papers were issued in 1960, but extensions were applied for and accepted multiple times between 1961 to 1964, allowing Ferrari to add modifications not covered under the original specification, including changes to the engine, transmission, and suspension.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book|title=Ferrari 250 GTO|last=Bluemel, Keith.|date=1998|publisher=Bay View Books Ltd|others=Pourret, Jess G.|isbn=1-901432-15-7|location=Bideford, Devon|oclc=41014319}}</ref> Additionally, since more than 100 bodies had been built according to the earlier 250 GT SWB specification, FIA regulations allowed a new body to be designed, leading to the development of the new 250 GTO body style.<ref name=\"Pourret1987\" /> This method of homologation was not unique to Ferrari, as similar methods were used to homologate the [[Aston Martin DB4 GT Zagato]] and the [[Jaguar E-Type#Lightweight E-Type (1963\u201364, 2014\u2013present)|Jaguar E-Type Lightweight]].<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nThe 250 GTO's racing debut was at the 1962 [[12 Hours of Sebring]], driven by American [[Phil Hill]] (the Formula One World Driving Champion at the time) and Belgian [[Olivier Gendebien]]. Although originally annoyed that they were driving a GT-class car instead of one of the full-race [[Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa|250 Testa Rossas]] competing in the prototype class, the experienced pair impressed themselves (and everyone else) by finishing second overall behind the Testa Rossa of [[Joakim Bonnier|Bonnier]] and [[Ludovico Scarfiotti|Scarfiotti]]. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/racing/ferrari-gto-history|title=Phil Hill on the Iconic Ferrari 250 GTO|last=Hill|first=Phil|date=2017-04-20|website=Road & Track|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>\n\nFerrari would go on to win the over 2000cc class of the FIA's [[International Championship for GT Manufacturers]] in 1962, 1963, and 1964,<ref>{{citation | first = Denis | last = Jenkinson | title = The Automobile Year Book of Sports Car Racing, 1982 | date = 1982 | page = 222 }}</ref> the 250 GTO being raced in each of those years. 250 GTOs also won the 1963 and 1964 [[Tour de France Automobile]], marking Ferrari's nine year dominance of that race.\n\nThe 250 GTO was one of the last front-engined cars to remain competitive at the top level of sports car racing. Before the advent of vintage racing, the 250 GTO, like other racing cars of the period, passed into obsolescence. Some were used in regional races, while others were used as road cars.\n\n== Collectibility ==\nWhile the GTO is now arguably the most valuable collector car in the world, it was merely a no-frills used race car in the late 1960s and very early 1970s. Many of the vehicles were offered at or acquired for four-figure (USD) sums. In contrast, restored [[Duesenberg Model J]]\u2019s often traded in the vicinity of $50,000 around 1970.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nFrom the late 1970s to the late 1980s, [[classic car]] values rose rapidly and the 250 GTO became the most valuable Ferrari model, touted as the [[Ferrari]] that most completely embodies the characteristics of the manufacturer. Prices fell substantially during the car market crash of the early 90s, resulting in lows of $2,700,000 in September 1994 and $2,500,000 in May 1996. Prices began to climb again in the late 90s and have continued to rise through the present day. 250 GTOs have repeatedly broken records for most expensive car ever sold at auction or private sale.<ref name=\"Hemmings-20180605\" /><ref name=\"bloomberg.com\" /><ref name=\"bloomberg.com-2\" /><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.automobilemag.com/news/1962-ferrari-250-gto-brings-48400000-monterey-set-new-record/|title=1962 Ferrari 250 GTO Brings $48,400,000 in Monterey to Set New Record {{!}} Automobile Magazine|date=2018-08-27|work=Automobile Magazine|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bonhams.com/press_release/17205/|title=Bonhams : Ferrari 250 Gto Achieves $38,115,000 (\u00a322,843,633)A New World Auction Record At Bonhams Quail Lodge Sale|website=www.bonhams.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-08-28}}</ref> The current record for world's most expensive car was set in June 2018 when a 1963 250 GTO (chassis 4153GT) was sold to David MacNeil in a private sale for $70 million.<ref name=\"Hemmings-20180605\" /> On August 25, 2018, RM Sotheby's sold [[Greg Whitten]]'s 250 GTO 3413GT at their Monterey auction.<ref name=\":2\" /> The final price inclusive of buyer's fee was $48,405,000, representing a new record for most expensive car ever sold at auction.

The chassis of the car was based on that of the [[Ferrari 250#250 GT SWB|250 GT SWB]], with minor differences in frame structure and geometry to reduce weight, stiffen and lower the chassis. The car was built around a hand-welded oval tube frame, incorporating [[Control arm|A-arm front suspension]], rear [[Beam axle#Live axle vs Dead axle|live-axle]] with [[Watt's linkage#Automobile suspension|Watt's linkage]], [[disc brake]]s, and [[Borrani]] wire wheels. The engine was the race-proven Tipo 168/62 Comp. {{cvt|2953|cc|L|1|order=flip}} [[V12 engine|V12]] as used in the [[Ferrari TR#250 Testa Rossa|250 Testa Rossa]] Le Mans winner.

The gearbox was a new 5-speed unit with [[Porsche]]-type [[synchromesh]].<ref name=\"Pourret1987\" />\n\n[[Bizzarrini]] focused his design effort on the car's aerodynamics in an attempt to improve top speed and stability. The body design was informed by wind tunnel testing at [[Pisa University]] as well as road and track testing with several prototypes. The resulting all-aluminium bodywork had a long, low nose, small radiator inlet, and distinctive air intakes on the nose with removable covers. Early testing resulted in the addition of a rear [[Spoiler (car)|spoiler]]. The underside of the car was covered by a belly pan and had an additional spoiler underneath formed by the fuel tank cover. The aerodynamic design of the 250 GTO was a major technical innovation compared to previous Ferrari GT cars, and in line with contemporary developments by manufacturers such as [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]]. The bodies were constructed by [[Scaglietti]], with the exception of early prototypes with bodies constructed in-house by Ferrari or by [[Pininfarina]] (in the case of s/n 2643 GT).

It was built to competition specification, which included a reinforced chassis, a competition gearbox and a ''Tipo 168/61'' 3.0 L engine tuned to 300 bhp, equipped with dry sump lubrication and six Weber 38 DCN carburetors. Pininfarina constructed a new lightweight aluminum alloy body for this prototype, which resembled that of the [[Ferrari America#400 Superamerica|400 Super America]] coupe. 2643 GT was entered by Scuderia Ferrari in the [[1961 24 Hours of Le Mans|1961 24 hours of Le Mans]], driven by [[Fernand Tavano]] and [[Giancarlo Baghetti]]. It finished 8th overall. During the course of the race, Ferrari engineers gathered information about the performance of the car which was used to modify and improve it, including the addition of a rear spoiler. During the Le Mans race, 2643 GT suffered from high-speed instability, possibly due to the front end design.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\"Pourret1987\" /> Following Le Mans, 2643 GT returned to the factory, where it was used for more testing.

The original chassis was extensively modified, including relocation of the engine mounts lower and further back in the frame. A competition-specification engine was fitted, including six Weber 38 DCN carburetors. The bodywork seen on the second prototype in period photos was rough, unfinished aluminum. The body's ungainly appearance lead the Ferrari team to nickname it \"Il Mostro\" (the Monster) and the press to call it \"The Anteater.\" Hammer marks, weld beads and bolted or riveted panels could be seen throughout, evidence of the continual modifications performed during factory testing in 1961. Although the body was crudely formed, it displayed features that would be seen in the production 250 GTO, including the overall profile of a low hood and high rear, triple front air intakes, engine bay cooling slots in the the front fenders and plexiglass-covered headlights. The interior was hastily constructed and even more minimal than in the production 250 GTO, with scattered instrumentation and a bare aluminum dashboard.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\"Pourret1987\" />\n\nThe second prototype was tested at [[Autodromo Nazionale di Monza|Monza]] in September 1961 by Stirling Moss. Results were promising, as the prototype was able to lap the circuit faster than a 250 GT SWB. However, the high speed stability issues seen during testing of the first prototype remained. Shortly after this test, construction of the first production 250 GTOs began in late 1961 with chassis 3223 GT and 3387 GT. <ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\"Pourret1987\" />\n\nAs 2053 GT was no longer needed for testing, the experimental body was scrapped and the chassis given a 250 GT SWB style body. In this form it was sold to [[Jacques Swaters]]. It crashed during the [[6 Hours of N\u00fcrburgring|1962 N\u00fcrburgring 1000 km]] and was then rebodied by [[Carrozzeria Sports Cars]].

Three new cars were produced to the 1964 specification, and four earlier 250 GTOs were retrofitted to it by the factory.<ref name=\"Pourret1987\" />  This redesign was intended to maintain the GTO's competitiveness for one more year, as the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] decided to not approve the [[Ferrari 250 LM|250 LM]] for GT-class racing during the 1964 season. The Ferrari engineers incorporated many of the 250LM's aerodynamic features into the 1964 GTO. This resulted in a visual similarity between the two models, even though the GTO does not share the 250LM's [[Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|mid engine rear wheel drive]] layout. The factory also made minor modifications to the engine, gearbox, chassis, suspension and interior. Despite these changes, the overall performance improvement was slight. The GTO '64 still saw some racing success with factory and privateer teams, including an overall win at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] in 1964 by [[Phil Hill]] and [[Pedro Rodr\u00edguez (racing driver)|Pedro Rodriguez]] driving for [[North American Racing Team|NART]]. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mallepelle|first=Paolo|date=1983|title=The 64 GTO|url=|journal=Cavallino|volume=16|pages=22\u201328|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://rmsothebys.com/en/auctions/MO18/Monterey/lots/r0117-1962-ferrari-250-gto-by-scaglietti/695912|title=RM Sotheby's - 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO by Scaglietti {{!}} Monterey 2018|date=2018-08-26|work=RM Sotheby's|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.racingsportscars.com/results/Daytona-1964-02-16.html|title=Daytona 2000 Kilometres 1964 - Race Results - Racing Sports Cars|website=www.racingsportscars.com|access-date=2018-08-31}}</ref>\n\nThree 330 GTO specials were made using the 250 GTO chassis and body fitted with [[Ferrari America#400 Superamerica|400 Superamerica]] 4.0L motors.

E. M. Archer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Work==\nFairbairn's works include: ''Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality'' (1952) and ''From Instinct to Self: Selected Papers of W. R. D. Fairbairn'' (1994). There is also a biography by  [[John Derg Sutherland]], ''Fairbairn\u2019s Journey into the Interior'' (1989), a study of his work by James Grotstein and R. B. Rinsley, ''Fairbairn and the Origins of Object Relations'' (1994), an edited study by Neil J. Skolnik and David E. Scharff, ''Fairbairn Then and Now'' (1998), a text by David Celani which is an application of Fairbairn's model  to domestic violence, ''The Illusion of Love:Why The Battered Woman Returns to Her Abuser'' (1994) , and a second text by Celani on the application of  Fairbairn's model to the treatment of severe personality disorders,  ''Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting'', (2010).\n\n===Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality (1952)===\n\n''Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality'' (1952) is a collection of papers previously published in different psychoanalytic journals. The book is divided into three parts, the first being mostly theoretical, the second one clinical, and the third one concerning more general problems. The first four articles contain most of Fairbairn's innovative concepts.  Fairbairn's work was a direct challenge to Freud's model of psychoanalysis, including his theory of psychological development, the functions and dynamics of personality, the origins of psychopathology, and the treatment of disordered individuals. In short, his goal was to replace Freudian metapsychology with his own model as noted by Greenberg and Mitchell: <blockquote>In a series of dense and fertile papers written during the  early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref>.</blockquote>'''Freud's psychoanalytic model''' is a drive/structure  model  in that it  proposes that  human beings are born with innate, biological drives (sex and aggression) that are contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating)  comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society there is immediate conflict. A new structure has to emerge from the Id to insure that the drives continue to be expressed in a way permitted by society. Thus the unconscious Id, which is Freud's metaphor for the package of the (assumed)  biological  drives, is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of the ego. This second structure has the task of mediating  between the primitive Id and society. Later on  in development (via the Oedipal Conflict) the child internalizes the values of his parents and these internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures: The Id, Ego and Super Ego, mature, and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make the morally correct choices.         \n\n'''Fairbairn's model''' is a relational/structure model in that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, and not from the pressure exerted by the Id (which does not exist in Fairbairn's metapsychology). The human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. Internal ego structures can be understood to be '''packages of memories''' that coalesce and form internal representations of the '''parents''', of the '''child''' himself, and of the child's relationship to them. Fairbairn's structural theory develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's under developed central ego to remember.  Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy his necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In primitive families where punishment is frequent, the child can be overwhelmed by parental aggression and faces the loss of his sense of self, as described by Bromberg in the following quote.     <blockquote>Psychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. ..At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     \n\n     </blockquote>Over time, these dissociated events, including those where the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process). Thus the human psyche is structured over time based on split off traumas that are unavailable to the individual's central ego. This is a very different structural model when compared to Freud's. In Fairbairn's model the  unconscious is ''developed'' (not inherited) from parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.\n\n=== Schizoid Factors in the Personality  (1940) ===\nFairbairn's first paper introduced his observation that many of his patient's appeared to be \"schizoid\" a condition that he defined as being a direct result of having splits in their ego structure. He noted that these patients had three observable characteristics.<blockquote>These are\n {{Ordered list}}(1) an attitude of omnipotence, \n\n(2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, \n\n(3) a preoccupation with inner reality....{{/Ordered list}}\n\nSo as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality, or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn,1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref>      </blockquote>He noted that the schizoid condition was due to split off (dissociated) interpersonal experiences which were unknown to the conscious \"central ego\".  The schizoid style of relating (or rather, non-relating) to others originated from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love during his developmental years. The schizoid was raised by a mother who was unable to relate to her child with tender, loving  emotions,  and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdrew into his inner world which is safer, but ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out in bold and uncompromising manner as the following quote illustrates:<blockquote>Regressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation  giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a Bad Object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that...he tends to retain his love inside of himself. (C) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious, (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18)<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>Thus Fairbairn saw that the lack of love in a young child's life was traumatic, and also caused splits in his ego. Typically, Fairbairn waited until later in his writing to inform the reader how and why certain material was deleted from the child's memory by dissociation, as the first four papers exposed his thought processes as he worked on and developed his full theory.\n\n=== A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941) ===\nFairbairn gradually formed his model in these first four papers. He  challenged Freud drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless,it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress,the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, this shift in focus was to great for the analytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model  was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian, there were no other options, and Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From his point on, his model was seen as an interesting intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become more powerful than Libido Theory.\nFairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentation (separation) from the parent because of he development of a mature, reality based central ego in the child.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and (b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" />\n<br /></blockquote>\nThus, the developmental process requires that the individual no longer sees himself as part of his mother, but rather as an independent, fully functioning person.The problem lies in the reality that many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily,as Fairbairn noted in one of his most famous quotes.<blockquote>\nThe greatest need of of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person,and to have his love accepted is the greatest trauma that a child can experience (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\n</blockquote>\nFairbairn's language is a bit overwrought, but in essence he says that the dependent child cannot mature with being sure that his parents love and support him, which gives him enough courage to let them go and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, or nearby,  trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Innovative concepts==\n\n===The object-seeking libido===\nOne of the most important contributions of Fairbairn to the psychoanalytic paradigm is proposing an alternative viewpoint regarding the libido. Whereas [[Freud]] assumed that the [[libido]] is pleasure seeking, Fairbairn thought of the libido as object seeking.<ref>{{cite book | authorlink=Peter Fuller|last=Fuller|first=Peter | title=Introduction to \"Psychoanalysis and after\" | publisher=Chatto | year=1985|isbn=0-7011-2971-9|page=18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fairbairn|first=W. Ronald D.|date=1946|title=Object-relationships and dynamic structure|url=https://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=ijp.027.0030a|journal=The International Journal of Psycho-Analysis|volume=27|issue=1\u20132|pages=30\u201337|issn=0020-7578|pmid=20276932|via=}}</ref> That is, he thought that the libido is not primarily aimed at pleasure, but at making relationships with objects external to the self. The first connections a child makes are with his parents. Through diverse forms of contact between the child and his parents, a bond between them is formed. When the bond is formed, the child becomes strongly attached to his parents. This early relationship shapes the emotional life of the child in such a strong way that it determines the emotional experiences that the child will have later on in life, because the early libidinal objects become the prototypes for all later experience of connection with others.\n\n===Internal object relations===\nFairbairn states that the [[object relations]] a child has very early on in life become the child's prototypes for all later experiences regarding connections with others. The internal [[object relations|object relation]] describes a relation which exists in the person's mind. In the normal situation, healthy parenting results in a child with an outward orientation towards real people, who can give real contact and exchange. When the needs of the child are not met by the parents (e.g. [[dependency need]]s and the need for affirmative interactions) a pathological turning away from external reality takes place. Instead of actual exchange with others, fantasised, private presences are established, the so-called internal objects.

This allows the child to continue loving a parent that he sees as completely supportive. Once dissociated, these memories of the child in relationship to the parent become internal ego structures over time.

In addition to the memories of the rejecting parent (The Rejecting Object in Fairbairn's model) the child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions. Fairbairn called the ego structure that develops from the dissociated memories of  the child's  self  as he reacted to the parent's rejection of him and his legitimate needs, the Antilibidinal Ego. These memories of the self as fearful, defeated, shamed and humiliated cannot be tolerated consciously.

The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on.The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable.

In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity  to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that he creates a \"good\" parent  for himself. That is, without a loving parent the child's bond and attachment to his parent would be broken, and he would experience a sense of complete abandonment. The child avoids this crisis by creating of a second vision of the parent, one that is based on idealization and fantasy which (mis) perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This second vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that he has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents. These rare supportive interactions are enhanced by fantasy and become a second unconscious view of the parent as loving and supportive. This potentially loving fantasy-based parent (which becomes an ego structure) was called the Exciting Object by Fairbairn, and the child's self  that relates to it was called the Libidinal Ego (or Self).  The attachment between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object is intense as they struggle to convince each other of their claims against the other. Similarly. the attachment between the intensely needy Libidinal Ego and the Exciting Object is equally powerful. The combination of the attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets- the Antilibidinal Ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the Rejecting Object in an attempt to reform it,  while the Libidinal Ego seeks ways to find out how to please the Exciting Object which promises it love which is  always out of reach. \n\nThese two unconscious pairs (The Antilibidinal Ego that relates to the Rejecting Object, and the Libidinal Ego that relates only to the Exciting Object) are unknown to each other and to the Central Ego. Splitting allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the Exciting Object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole Object. Thus, the individual  never develops \"object constancy\" which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved and the individual functions at an earlier stage of development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects as if they were two different people. When the individual is frustrated they see the object as \"all bad\" and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  Libidinal Ego structure they see the object as \"all good\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage and minutes later says \"I love you Mommy\". There is no memory of the other ego state. Equally importantly, powerful, emotional filled memories are dissociated which impoverishes, and weakens the Central Ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history.<ref>{{Cite book|url=isbn 978-0-231-14907-5|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-3-11-053768-0|location=|pages=|oclc=1007218368}}</ref>\n\n'''Fairbairn's Structural Model'''\n\nEmotional deprivation and the resulting fear of abandonment leads to splitting of the ego and the split ego eventuates into Fairbairn's s Structural Theory. As just described, the psyche is split into three pairs of selves that relate to three separate objects. The three pairs of structures relate only to each other and are unaware of the other two pairs. In effect, this structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however it never develops beyond this steady state. As described, the Central Ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego varies from child to child according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced during their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in reality summate in both the conscious central ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's central ego through  daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with new adults and children and is able to develop  new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with other who see aspects of himself that his parent's have not discovered. \n\nIn  less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance  is scarce or absent, the child's Central Ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his central ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. At the same time,  his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his Central Ego is losing sight the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  The ratio of conscious to unconscious structures shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the antilibidinal ego and the rejecting object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the libidinal ego seeking the key to the love that it assumes (incorrectly) is stored in their parent. This powerful unconscious influences the weakened central ego and is the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51\u201371}}</ref> When any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his Rejecting Object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior  and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This happens when the unconscious structures are powerful and the Central Ego is weakened and has poor contact with external objects.<br />\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.columbia.edu/~rr322/FAIRBAIRN.html Structural Model]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fairbairn, Ronald}}\n[[Category:1889 births]]\n[[Category:1964 deaths]]\n[[Category:British psychoanalysts]]\n[[Category:Scottish psychologists]]\n[[Category:Scottish psychiatrists]]\n[[Category:People educated at Merchiston Castle School]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:People from Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:Scottish soldiers]]\n[[Category:British Army personnel of World War I]]\n[[Category:Analysands of Sigmund Freud]]\n[[Category:Object relations theorists]]\n[[Category:History of mental health in the United Kingdom]]\n", "text_old": "<ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=The Illusion Of Love: Why The Battered Woman Returns To Her Abuser|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0231100373|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>{{EngvarB|date=August 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}\n{{psychoanalysis}}\n[[File:The Red House, Cluny Gardens.jpg|thumb|Fairbairn's birthplace - The Red House, Cluny Gardens]]\n[[File:Ronald Fairbairn's grave, Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|235px|Ronald Fairbairn's grave, Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh]]\n'''William Ronald Dodds Fairbairn''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|f|\u025b\u0259r|b|\u025b\u0259r|n}}) [[FRSE]] (11 August 1889 \u2013 31 December 1964) was a Scottish psychiatrist, psychoanalyst and a central figure in the development of the [[object relations theory]] of psychoanalysis.\n\n==Life==\nRonald Fairbairn was born at the Red House, Cluny Gardens,<ref>Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1889-90</ref> in [[Morningside, Edinburgh]] in 1889, the only child of Cecilia Leefe and Thomas Fairbairn, a chartered surveyor, and President of the Edinburgh Architectural Association.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite ODNB|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/40312|title=Fairbairn, (William) Ronald Dodds (1889\u20131964), psychiatrist and psychoanalyst|last=|first=|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/40312}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783\u20132002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0-902-198-84-X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}</ref> He was educated at [[Merchiston Castle School]] and at the [[University of Edinburgh]] where he studied for three years in [[divinity]] and [[Hellenic Greek]] studies, graduating MA in 1911.\n\nIn the [[First World War]] he joined the [[Royal Engineers]] and served under [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]] in the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Palestinian campaign]], and then the [[Royal Garrison Artillery]].\n\nOn his return to home he began medical training, probably inspired by his war experience.

The book is divided into three parts, the first being mostly theoretical, the second one clinical, and the third one concerning more general problems. The first four articles contain most of Fairbairn's innovative concepts.  Fairbairn's work was a direct challenge to Freud's model of psychoanalysis, including his theory of psychological development, the functions and dynamics of personality, the origins of psychopathology, and the treatment of disordered individuals. In short, his goal was to replace Freudian metapsychology with his own model as noted by Greenberg and Mitchell: <blockquote>In a series of dense and fertile papers written during the  early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref>.</blockquote>'''Freud's psychoanalytic model''' is a drive/structure  model  in that it  proposes that  human beings are born with innate, biological drives (sex and aggression) that are contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating)  comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society there is immediate conflict. A new structure has to emerge from the Id to insure that the drives continue to be expressed in a way permitted by society. Thus the unconscious Id, which is Freud's metaphor for the package of the (assumed)  biological  drives, is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of the ego. This second structure has the task of mediating  between the primitive Id and society. Later on  in development (via the Oedipal Conflict) the child internalizes the values of his parents and these internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures: The Id, Ego and Super Ego, mature, and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make the morally correct choices.         \n\n'''Fairbairn's model''' is a relational/structure model in that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, and not from the pressure exerted by the Id (which does not exist in Fairbairn's metapsychology). The human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. Internal ego structures can be understood to be '''packages of memories''' that coalesce and form internal representations of the '''parents''', of the '''child''' himself, and of the child's relationship to them. Fairbairn's structural theory develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's under developed central ego to remember.  Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy his necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In primitive families where punishment is frequent, the child can be overwhelmed by parental aggression and faces the loss of his sense of self, as described by Bromberg in the following quote.     <blockquote>Psychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. ..At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     \n\n     </blockquote>Over time, these dissociated events, including those where the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process). Thus the human psyche is structured over time based on split off traumas that are unavailable to the individual's central ego. This is a very different structural model when compared to Freud's. In Fairbairn's model the  unconscious is ''developed'' (not inherited) from parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.\n\n=== Schizoid Factors in the Personality  (1940) ===\nFairbairn's first paper introduced his observation that many of his patient's appeared to be \"schizoid\" a condition that he defined as being a direct result of having splits in their ego structure. He noted that these patients had three observable characteristics.<blockquote>These are\n {{Ordered list}}(1) an attitude of omnipotence, \n(2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, \n\n(3) a preoccupation with inner reality....{{/Ordered list}}\n\nSo as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality, or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn,1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref>      </blockquote>He noted that the schizoid condition was due to split off (dissociated) interpersonal experiences which were unknown to the conscious \"central ego\".  The schizoid style of relating (or rather, non-relating) to others originated from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love during his developmental years. The schizoid was raised by a mother who was unable to relate to her child with tender, loving  emotions,  and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdrew into his inner world which is safer, but ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out in bold and uncompromising manner as the following quote illustrates:<blockquote>Regressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation  giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a Bad Object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that...he tends to retain his love inside of himself. (C) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious, (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18)<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>Thus Fairbairn saw that the lack of love in a young child's life was traumatic, and also caused splits in his ego. Typically, Fairbairn waited until later in his writing to inform the reader how and why certain material was deleted from the child's memory by dissociation, as the first four papers exposed his thought processes as he worked on and developed his full theory.\n\n=== A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941) ===\nFairbairn gradually formed his model in these first four papers. He  challenged Freud drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless,it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress,the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, this shift in focus was to great for the analytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model  was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian, there were no other options, and Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From his point on, his model was seen as an interesting intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become more powerful than Libido Theory.\nFairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentation (separation) from the parent because of he development of a mature, reality based central ego in the child.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and (b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" />\n<br /></blockquote>\nThus, the developmental process requires that the individual no longer sees himself as part of his mother, but rather as an independent, fully functioning person.The problem lies in the reality that many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily,as Fairbairn noted in one of his most famous quotes.<blockquote>\nThe greatest need of of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person,and to have his love accepted is the greatest trauma that a child can experience (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\n</blockquote>\nFairbairn's language is a bit overwrought, but in essence he says that the dependent child cannot mature with being sure that his parents love and support him, which gives him enough courage to let them go and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, or nearby,  trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Innovative concepts==\n\n===The object-seeking libido===\nOne of the most important contributions of Fairbairn to the psychoanalytic paradigm is proposing an alternative viewpoint regarding the libido. Whereas [[Freud]] assumed that the [[libido]] is pleasure seeking, Fairbairn thought of the libido as object seeking.<ref>{{cite book | authorlink=Peter Fuller|last=Fuller|first=Peter | title=Introduction to \"Psychoanalysis and after\" | publisher=Chatto | year=1985|isbn=0-7011-2971-9|page=18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fairbairn|first=W.

The first connections a child makes are with his parents. Through diverse forms of contact between the child and his parents, a bond between them is formed. When the bond is formed, the child becomes strongly attached to his parents. This early relationship shapes the emotional life of the child in such a strong way that it determines the emotional experiences that the child will have later on in life, because the early libidinal objects become the prototypes for all later experience of connection with others.\n\n===Internal object relations===\nFairbairn states that the [[object relations]] a child has very early on in life become the child's prototypes for all later experiences regarding connections with others. The internal [[object relations|object relation]] describes a relation which exists in the person's mind. In the normal situation, healthy parenting results in a child with an outward orientation towards real people, who can give real contact and exchange. When the needs of the child are not met by the parents (e.g. [[dependency need]]s and the need for affirmative interactions) a pathological turning away from external reality takes place. Instead of actual exchange with others, fantasised, private presences are established, the so-called internal objects. To these internal objects the child relates in fantasised connections, the internal object relations.\n\n===The splitting of the ego===\n{{Main|Splitting (psychology)}}\nFairbairn recognized that  children are  totally and absolutely dependent on their parents. Because of this dependency they cannot tolerate \"knowing\" that their parents are indifferent, abandoning, and perhaps even abusive. They solve the problem of \"knowing\" about their parents' rejection of them by dissociating memories of interactions that were intolerable to accept. The defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn had worked in an orphanage associated with the University of Edinburgh <ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's journey into the interior|last=Sutherland, John Derg, 1905- ...|date=1999|publisher=Free Association Books|isbn=1-85343-059-5|oclc=470458410}}</ref>as one of his part-time appointments and his experiences with children separated from their families alerted him to the reality that the child's extreme dependency on their parents makes any abandonment a major trauma. The powerful defense called dissociation was needed to erase the event from their consciousness. The memory of the rejecting parent, along with the  memory of the child's response to that parent, are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the child to continue loving a parent that he sees as completely supportive. Once dissociated, these memories of the child in relationship to the parent become internal ego structures over time. In families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent must be dissociated for if the child were to \"see\" this reality it would destroy his dependency relationship on the parent and he would face an abandonment crisis. In addition to the memories of the rejecting parent (The Rejecting Object in Fairbairn's model) the child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions. Fairbairn called the ego structure that develops from the dissociated memories of  the child's  self  as he reacted to the parent's rejection of him and his legitimate needs, the Antilibidinal Ego. These memories of the self as fearful, defeated, shamed and humiliated cannot be tolerated consciously. The antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the internalized rejecting object that are held in the inner world continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden (2018); \n\n\" Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on.The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either.\"<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|chapter=Why read Fairbairn? *|date=2018-03-08|pages=131\u2013146|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8|doi=10.4324/9780429474538-12|title=Fairbairn and the Object Relations Tradition}}</ref>  \n\nWithin the child's inner world (his unconscious) the Antilibidinal Ego relates only to the \"Rejecting Object\", and this pair of self and object structures are unknown to the conscious Central Ego that is in contact with the acceptable aspects of the parent (the Ideal Object) and with external reality.  In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity  to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that he creates a \"good\" parent  for himself. That is, without a loving parent the child's bond and attachment to his parent would be broken, and he would experience a sense of complete abandonment. The child avoids this crisis by creating of a second vision of the parent, one that is based on idealization and fantasy which (mis) perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This second vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that he has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents. These rare supportive interactions are enhanced by fantasy and become a second unconscious view of the parent as loving and supportive. This potentially loving fantasy-based parent (which becomes an ego structure) was called the Exciting Object by Fairbairn, and the child's self  that relates to it was called the Libidinal Ego (or Self).  The attachment between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object is intense as they struggle to convince each other of their claims against the other. Similarly. the attachment between the intensely needy Libidinal Ego and the Exciting Object is equally powerful. The combination of the attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets- the Antilibidinal Ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the Rejecting Object in an attempt to reform it,  while the Libidinal Ego seeks ways to find out how to please the Exciting Object which promises it love which is  always out of reach. \n\nThese two unconscious pairs (The Antilibidinal Ego that relates to the Rejecting Object, and the Libidinal Ego that relates only to the Exciting Object) are unknown to each other and to the Central Ego. Splitting allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the Exciting Object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole Object. Thus, the individual  never develops \"object constancy\" which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved and the individual functions at an earlier stage of development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects as if they were two different people. When the individual is frustrated they see the object as \"all bad\" and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  Libidinal Ego structure they see the object as \"all good\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage and minutes later says \"I love you Mommy\". There is no memory of the other ego state. Equally importantly, powerful, emotional filled memories are dissociated which impoverishes, and weakens the Central Ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history.<ref>{{Cite book|url=isbn 978-0-231-14907-5|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-3-11-053768-0|location=|pages=|oclc=1007218368}}</ref>\n\n'''Fairbairn's Structural Model'''\n\nEmotional deprivation and the resulting fear of abandonment leads to splitting of the ego and the split ego eventuates into Fairbairn's s Structural Theory. As just described, the psyche is split into three pairs of selves that relate to three separate objects. The three pairs of structures relate only to each other and are unaware of the other two pairs. In effect, this structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however it never develops beyond this steady state. As described, the Central Ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego varies from child to child according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced during their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in reality summate in both the conscious central ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's central ego through  daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with new adults and children and is able to develop  new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with other who see aspects of himself that his parent's have not discovered. \n\nIn  less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance  is scarce or absent, the child's Central Ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his central ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. At the same time,  his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his Central Ego is losing sight the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  The ratio of conscious to unconscious structures shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the antilibidinal ego and the rejecting object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the libidinal ego seeking the key to the love that it assumes (incorrectly) is stored in their parent. This powerful unconscious influences the weakened central ego and is the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51\u201371}}</ref> When any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his Rejecting Object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior  and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This happens when the unconscious structures are powerful and the Central Ego is weakened and has poor contact with external objects.<br />\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.columbia.edu/~rr322/FAIRBAIRN.html Structural Model]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fairbairn, Ronald}}\n[[Category:1889 births]]\n[[Category:1964 deaths]]\n[[Category:British psychoanalysts]]\n[[Category:Scottish psychologists]]\n[[Category:Scottish psychiatrists]]\n[[Category:People educated at Merchiston Castle School]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:People from Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:Scottish soldiers]]\n[[Category:British Army personnel of World War I]]\n[[Category:Analysands of Sigmund Freud]]\n[[Category:Object relations theorists]]\n[[Category:History of mental health in the United Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "Markewilliams", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSchizoid Factors in the Personality  (1940)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fairbairn"}

However, after the massacre, the Crown Prince survived for a short while in a coma.\n\nAlthough the prince never regained consciousness before dying, Crown Prince Dipendra was the monarch under the law of Nepali royal succession. Two days later after his death, the late King's surviving brother [[Gyanendra]] was proclaimed as a king.\n\n===2002\u20132007: Suspension of parliament and Loktantra Andolan===\n{{Main|2006 democracy movement in Nepal}}\nOn 1 February 2002 [[Gyanendra of Nepal|King Gyanendra]] suspended the Parliament, appointed a government led by himself, and enforced [[martial law]]. The King argued that civil politicians were unfit to handle the Maoist insurgency. Telephone lines were cut and several high-profile political leaders were detained. Other opposition leaders fled to India and regrouped there. A broad coalition called the Seven Party Alliance (SPA) was formed in opposition to the royal takeover, encompassing the seven parliamentary parties who held about 90% of the seats in the old, dissolved parliament.\n\nThe UN-[[OHCHR]], in response to events in Nepal, set up a monitoring program in 2005 to assess and observe the human rights situation there<ref>[http://www.ohchr.org/english/countries/np/summary.htm Nepal Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717103319/http://www.ohchr.org/english/countries/np/summary.htm |date=17 July 2007 }}, OHCHR.</ref>\n\nOn 22 November 2005, the [[Seven Party Alliance]] (SPA) of parliamentary parties and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) agreed on a historic and unprecedented 12-point memorandum of understanding (MOU) for peace and democracy. Nepali people from various walks of life and the international community regarded the MOU as an appropriate political response to the crisis that was developing in Nepal. Against the backdrop of the historical sufferings of the Nepali people and the enormous human cost of the last ten years of violent conflict, the MOU, which proposes a peaceful transition through an elected constituent assembly, created an acceptable formula for a united movement for democracy. As per the 12-point MOU, the SPA called for a protest movement, and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) supported it. This led to a countrywide uprising called the [[Loktantra Andolan]] that started in April 2006. All political forces including civil society and professional organisations actively galvanised the people. This resulted in massive and spontaneous demonstrations and rallies held across Nepal against King Gyanendra's autocratic rule.\n\nOn 21 April 2006, King Gyanendra declared that \"power would be returned to the people\". This had little effect on the people, who continued to occupy the streets of Kathmandu and other towns, openly defying the daytime curfew. Finally, King Gyanendra announced the reinstatement of the House of Representatives, thereby conceding one of the major demands of the SPA, at midnight on 24 April 2006. Following this action, the coalition of political forces decided to call off the protests.\n\nAt least 14 died during the 19 days of protests.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/04/23/nepal.protests/]</ref>\n\nOn 19 May 2006, the parliament assumed total legislative power and gave executive power to the Government of Nepal (previously known as His Majesty's Government). Names of many institutions (including the army) were stripped of the \"royal\" adjective and the Raj Parishad (a council of the King's advisers) was abolished, with his duties assigned to the Parliament itself. The activities of the King became subject to parliamentary scrutiny and the King's properties were subjected to taxation. Moreover, Nepal was declared a secular state abrogating the previous status of a Hindu Kingdom. However, most of the changes have, as yet, not been implemented.  On 19 July 2006, the prime minister, [[Girija Prasad Koirala|G. P. Koirala]], sent a letter to the United Nations announcing the intention of the Nepali government to hold elections to a constituent assembly by April 2007.\n\n===December 2007 to May 2008: Abolition of the monarchy===\nOn 23 December 2007, an agreement was made for the monarchy to be abolished and the country to become a federal [[republic]] with the Prime Minister becoming [[head of state]].<ref name=\"Time 20071224\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1698161,00.html |title=Nepal to Abolish Monarchy |first=Binaj |last=Gurubacharya |magazine=Time |date=24 December 2007 |accessdate=26 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225150425/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0%2C8599%2C1698161%2C00.html |archivedate=25 December 2007  }}</ref> The Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) became the largest party amidst a general atmosphere of fear and intimidation from all sides.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11057207&amp;fsrc=nwl|newspaper=The Economist|title=The Maoists triumph | date=17 April 2008}}</ref> A federal republic was established in May 2008, with only four members of the 601-seat Constituent Assembly voting against the change,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7424302.stm Nepal votes to abolish monarchy] BBC News, 28 May 2008</ref> which ended 240 years of royal rule in Nepal.

But the [[President (government title)|President]] [[Ram Baran Yadav]], as the supreme head of\nmilitary power in the country, revoked this decision and gave the army chief additional time in office.

However, after the massacre, the Crown Prince survived for a short while in a coma.\n\nAlthough the prince never regained consciousness before dying, Crown Prince Dipendra was the monarch under the law of Nepali royal succession. Two days later after his death, the late King's surviving brother [[Gyanendra]] was proclaimed as a king.\n\n===2002\u20132007: Suspension of parliament and Loktantra Andolan===\n{{Main|2006 democracy movement in Nepal}}\nOn 1 February 2002 [[Gyanendra of Nepal|King Gyanendra]] suspended the Parliament, appointed a government led by himself, and enforced [[martial law]]. The King argued that civil politicians were unfit to handle the Maoist insurgency. Telephone lines were cut and several high-profile political leaders were detained. Other opposition leaders fled to India and regrouped there. A broad coalition called the Seven Party Alliance (SPA) was formed in opposition to the royal takeover, encompassing the seven parliamentary parties who held about 90% of the seats in the old, dissolved parliament.\n\nThe UN-[[OHCHR]], in response to events in Nepal, set up a monitoring program in 2005 to assess and observe the human rights situation there<ref>[http://www.ohchr.org/english/countries/np/summary.htm Nepal Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717103319/http://www.ohchr.org/english/countries/np/summary.htm |date=17 July 2007 }}, OHCHR.</ref>\n\nOn 22 November 2005, the [[Seven Party Alliance]] (SPA) of parliamentary parties and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) agreed on a historic and unprecedented 12-point memorandum of understanding (MOU) for peace and democracy. Nepali people from various walks of life and the international community regarded the MOU as an appropriate political response to the crisis that was developing in Nepal. Against the backdrop of the historical sufferings of the Nepali people and the enormous human cost of the last ten years of violent conflict, the MOU, which proposes a peaceful transition through an elected constituent assembly, created an acceptable formula for a united movement for democracy. As per the 12-point MOU, the SPA called for a protest movement, and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) supported it. This led to a countrywide uprising called the [[Loktantra Andolan]] that started in April 2006. All political forces including civil society and professional organisations actively galvanised the people. This resulted in massive and spontaneous demonstrations and rallies held across Nepal against King Gyanendra's autocratic rule.\n\nOn 21 April 2006, King Gyanendra declared that \"power would be returned to the people\". This had little effect on the people, who continued to occupy the streets of Kathmandu and other towns, openly defying the daytime curfew. Finally, King Gyanendra announced the reinstatement of the House of Representatives, thereby conceding one of the major demands of the SPA, at midnight on 24 April 2006. Following this action, the coalition of political forces decided to call off the protests.\n\nAt least 14 died during the 19 days of protests.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/04/23/nepal.protests/]</ref>\n\nOn 19 May 2006, the parliament assumed total legislative power and gave executive power to the Government of Nepal (previously known as His Majesty's Government). Names of many institutions (including the army) were stripped of the \"royal\" adjective and the Raj Parishad (a council of the King's advisers) was abolished, with his duties assigned to the Parliament itself. The activities of the King became subject to parliamentary scrutiny and the King's properties were subjected to taxation. Moreover, Nepal was declared a secular state abrogating the previous status of a Hindu Kingdom. However, most of the changes have, as yet, not been implemented.  On 19 July 2006, the prime minister, [[Girija Prasad Koirala|G. P.

There have been several types os research locally, ranging from the predominant study of the geology and sedimentology on the formation and associated layers, along with the geochemical, climatic, and ecosistemic research to set the different changes that have been documented along the formation. Paleogeography, paleontology, palynology, iectonics, and several other kinds of works have been done along the Formation. The most studied section has been the German, with the other being found as part of the Posidonia on late 1960-80s works, and most of them not covered yet.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 1800s ===\n[[File:Friedrich August von Quenstedt.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Friedrich August von Quenstedt a German Mineralogist that studied the jurassic strata along Germany, including the Black Shales of the Posidonia Shale.]]\nThe first related studies with the Posidonia Shale Strata where done on the Early 1800.

Although the east margin of the formation has yield strata with an age of 179.7 m.a, showing the presence of the depositional environment on Middle Toarcian times.<ref name=\"Acken2019\"/>\n\n== Oil ==\n[[File:Mistelgau Fossiliengrube 29.04.10.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Former clay pit in Mistelgau]]\n\nRecent studies have shown that the petroleum generation potential of the PS is high in all studied regions due to the high TOC and Hydrogen Index.

This suggests the presence of a general deposition of organic matter, driven by several global events and changes present on the surface. This caused changes on the bottom of the seas, with abundant deposition of organic matter. It\u00b4s related to a change in carbon-isotope excursion in marine and terrestrial life, and was probably a perturbator of the carbon cycle.<ref>Brumsack, H. J. (1991).

There have been several types os research locally, ranging from the predominant study of the geology and sedimentology on the formation and associated layers, along with the geochemical, climatic, and ecosistemic research to set the different changes that have been documented along the formation. Paleogeography, paleontology, palynology, iectonics, and several other kinds of works have been done along the Formation. The most studied section has been the German, with the other being found as part of the Posidonia on late 1960-80s works, and most of them not covered yet.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 1800s ===\n[[File:Friedrich August von Quenstedt.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Friedrich August von Quenstedt a German Mineralogist that studied the jurassic strata along Germany, including the Black Shales of the Posidonia Shale.]]\nThe first related studies with the Posidonia Shale Strata where done on the Early 1800. At the first the Formation Wasn\u00b4t identifed as a separated unit. The first fossils where recovered on several Collections, some since the Modern Age, present on localities like the Banz Abbey. Among the oldest examples of fossils found on the formation is included the crocodrylomorph [[Steneosaurus]] on 1824, but being identified as a Gharial.<ref>Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, E. (1825).

There have been several types os research locally, ranging from the predominant study of the geology and sedimentology on the formation and associated layers, along with the geochemical, climatic, and ecosistemic research to set the different changes that have been documented along the formation. Paleogeography, paleontology, palynology, iectonics, and several other kinds of works have been done along the Formation. The most studied section has been the German, with the other being found as part of the Posidonia on late 1960-80s works, and most of them not covered yet.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 1800s ===\n[[File:Friedrich August von Quenstedt.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Friedrich August von Quenstedt a German Mineralogist that studied the jurassic strata along Germany, including the Black Shales of the Posidonia Shale.]]\nThe first related studies with the Posidonia Shale Strata where done on the Early 1800. At the first the Formation Wasn\u00b4t identifed as a separated unit. The first fossils where recovered on several Collections, some since the Modern Age, present on localities like the Banz Abbey.
