Players are privately quizzed on how well they have deduced the mystery; the player with the lowest score becomes the next victim of the murderer, eliminating them from the game.\n\n==Format==\nThe series follows 13 guests, one of whom is secretly the \"killer\" posing as a contestant in the game, living in a [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] [[mansion]] named Rue Manor.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://xfinity.comcast.net/blogs/tv/2013/06/22/five-things-to-know-about-abcs-new-murder-mystery-whodunnit/ | title = Five Things to Know About ABC\u2019s New Murder Mystery \u2018Whodunnit?\u2019 | accessdate = July 8, 2013 | last = Cohn | first = Paulette | date = June 22, 2013 | publisher = Comcast }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfEh7zfkYp0 | title = 2571 Wallingford Drive, Beverly Hills, CA 90210 | publisher = Youtube | date = May 17, 2013 | accessdate = July 30, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://la.curbed.com/archives/2013/01/bev_crest_mansion_with_ponzi_scheme_ties_asking_375mm.php | title = Bev Crest Mansion With Ponzi Scheme Ties Asking $37.5MM | accessdate = August 10, 2013 | last = Kudler | first = Adrian Glick | date = January 10, 2013 | publisher = Curbed LA}}</ref> They are guided by the [[butler]], Giles (Gildart Jackson) who also acts as the show's host. Within the show's fiction, the guests, along with Giles and two maids, are trapped by the killer within the house grounds until they determine who the killer is. An early episode shows that Giles is wearing an [[ankle monitor]] that forbids him from leaving. In many ways, Giles acts as a puppet for the killer; the killer sends messages to Giles, who reads them to the surviving guests.\n\nEach episode, at least one guest is \"murdered\" (through staged events by production) by the killer, either while the victim is alone or through pre-arranged circumstances while the remaining guests are congregated as to avoid revealing their identity. After the shock of the event, Giles offers the remaining guests an opportunity to search one of three areas (usually the crime scene, the last known whereabouts, or the morgue containing the victim's body) to discover clues about how the murder was carried out. Guests are free to select which area to search, though they are allowed access to only one area with a limited amount of time, and are confined to the bounds set by production, sometimes marked off with [[police tape]]. Guests then participate in a riddle challenge that leads them in a competitive search through the mansion. The guest who is able to complete the challenge receives an additional clue that may greatly help in solving how the murder was committed.\n\nGuests are given limited opportunities to congregate, where they can share, withhold, or lie about whatever information they find from their investigations and riddle challenges; at all other times, guests are isolated from each other. In the first season, this led to the ad hoc formation of two informal teams that tried to assure information was withheld from the other team, in an attempt to assure their own team's advancement to the next round. Though the murders and riddle challenges are presented as having been masterminded by the killer, in reality the guest playing the killer is as unaware of upcoming deaths and challenges as the other guests, and is not given any information from production about the larger social game.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web | url = http://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/archives/whodunnit/2013_Jul_14_zuiker-interview | title = Whodunnit: all your questions answered | accessdate = July 15, 2013 | last = Dehnart | first = Andy | date = July 14, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nLater, guests are individually taken to the mansion library where, in monologue, they describe to the unseen killer how they believe the murder took place and make an accusation as to who the killer is. However, each elimination is actually based on the guests' performance on an unaired written quiz (similar to ''[[The Mole (U.S. TV series)|The Mole]]'') that objectively assesses the accuracy of their theories.<ref name=\":0\" /> The quiz consists of 12-15 short answer questions about the investigation sites and the riddle challenge; ties are broken based on the time taken to complete the quiz.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://robhasawebsite.com/whodunnit-episode-6-recap-geno-walker-interview/ |title=Talking Whodunnit with the Latest Victim of \u2018The Killer\u2019 |last1=Cesternino |first1=Rob |last2=Walker |first2=Geno |date=July 29, 2013 |website=Rob Has a Website |publisher=(around 48:30 on the podcast) |accessdate=July 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring dinner, Giles presents a message from the killer. The message states which guest had the most correct theory and is subsequently spared from being the killer's next victim. The message then fully explains how the murder was completed. After this, Giles hands an envelope to each remaining guest. Those receiving cards with the word \"Spared\" performed well enough to advance to the next episode. The lowest-scoring guest, along with at least one other low-scoring guest will receive a card with the word \"Scared.\" As noted above, the guest playing the killer is as unaware of how the murders are committed as the rest of the guests are, and so may also receive a \"Scared\" card as well; however, the killer cannot be eliminated.<ref name=\"pennlivebehindscenes\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pennlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2013/07/whodunnit_behind-the-scenes_se.html | title = 'Whodunnit?' behind-the-scenes secrets revealed | accessdate = July 10, 2013 | last = Zelko | first = Abbey | date = July 9, 2013 }}</ref> The lowest-scoring guest is then eliminated from the competition by being \"murdered by the killer\", in turn setting up the murder to be solved in the next episode.\n\nIn the finale, the final three guests (the killer and the two remaining players) compete in a multi-part riddle and memory challenge based on elements from all of the previous murders. The first player to complete this challenge is directed to a final room to confront the killer, while the last player is sent elsewhere and subsequently eliminated.

After a brief meet-and-greet, the guests split up to explore the house, but race back when they hear a shattering of glass. They find Sheri \"dead\" by a broken fish tank in the house's foyer with exposed wires from a nearby lamp electrifying her body.\n\n'''Investigation''': The investigation covers three areas, with the following clues identified by various guests:\n* The crime scene (the foyer): The scene reveals the broken fish tank, a severed lamp wire, and a large blood stain underneath where Sheri's head lay.\n* The morgue: The only apparent wounds on Sheri's body are shards of glass in her forehead, and a large pellet pulled from the back of her neck.\n* The last known whereabouts (Sheri's room): The door to Sheri's room shows signs of forced entry. The shower in Sheri's bathroom is still running. A few letters are seen written into the fogged portion of the bathroom mirror, leading the investigators to use a nearby steamer to reveal a message by fogging the entire mirror: \"Meet me at the fish tank, I have vital info for you.\"\n\n'''Riddle challenge''': The guests are each given a key that has imprinted on it \"13:17\" and the image of two crowns. This turns out to refer to the [[Bible|biblical]] verse [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] 13:17, which starts: \"Open the east window.\" The guests find one of the panes of glass missing at the eastern window of the main room, along with a three-digit number engraved in the window frame. This turns out to be the code to a combination lock on a garden storage bin outside, visible straight ahead from the window. Opening it reveals a crowbar and a slingshot. Ronnie is the first to find this clue, though several guests are with him at the time.\n\n'''Solution''': The killer severed the wire on the lamp by the fish tank and removed a pane of glass from the main room. The killer then used a crowbar to break into Sheri's room while she was showering and wrote the message on the mirror in the bathroom, and then waited outside for her arrival.  Sheri saw the message upon leaving the shower and headed downstairs.  Once Sheri reached the fish tank and turned her back, the killer fired a pellet through the open window into the back of Sheri's neck. Sheri was killed on impact, falling forward into the tank, damaging the glass, and then falling back onto the rug. The crack on the tank shortly gave way, but allowed the killer time to hide the tools in the garden bin. The water from the tank splashed over Sheri's body and the nearby carpet, and the spliced lamp cord electrified the area.\n\n'''Best Theory''': Sasha\n\n'''Scared''': Don and Dontae\n\n| LineColor       = 00A2CF\n}}{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| Title           = Fire Starter\n| RTitle = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/whodunnit-2013/episode-2-season-1/fire-starter/544574|title=''Whodunnit?''

During the night, the fire alarm goes off, and all the guests, except Dontae, gather outside. As they wait, Dontae comes running out of the house, engulfed in flames, and jumps into the pool. Despite the flames being doused, Dontae is found \"dead.\"\n\n'''Killed''': Dontae\n\n'''Investigation''': The investigation covers three areas, with the following clues identified by various guests:\n* The crime scene (the pool): With the body removed, the guests find loose scraps from Dontae's pajamas and socks, finding that neither matches with what the other guests were given to wear. They also find a medallion inscribed with a seal of [[Agatha of Sicily|St. Agatha]] at the bottom of the pool.\n* The morgue: Dontae's chest has the largest burnt area, meaning that it was likely the point of ignition; his right hand and arm are also severely burned. The morgue's investigators also discover that Dontae's pajamas are different from the other guests'.\n* The last known whereabouts (Dontae's room): The door has a large spread of soot from the door handle, and the nearby lampshade is partially burned, but no other parts of the room seem affected. An empty case by Dontae's bed includes a note suggesting there was a gift for Dontae from St. Agatha, the patron saint of fire, to help protect him.  A [[shag (fabric)|shaggy rug]] leads from the bed to the door.\n\n'''Riddle challenge''': Each guest is given a white flag with the house [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] on it and is told to look for \"fire in liquid form.\" This clue leads to a bottle of [[benzene]] that, when sprayed on the flag, reveals a pink strip across the house crest. This guides them to a door upstairs that has a similar pink stripe running through the house crest on it; the door also has a rug in front of it. Kam reaches the door, receiving a brief [[electric shock]] when he attempts to open it; this shock ignites the pink stripe on the door. Cris and Ulysses are with him at that time.\n\n'''Solution''': The killer provided Dontae with different pajamas that had been sprayed with odorless [[benzene]] and special socks that were more prone to generating static electricity. In addition, the killer left behind a pendant of [[St. Agatha]] with a note that read, \"Patron saint, protector from fire. Sleep well.\" When Dontae retired for the night, he put on the clothes and pendant and went to sleep. The killer then set off the fire alarm at 4:38 in the morning. Like the other guests, Dontae got up but ran across the shag carpet in his special socks, generating [[static electricity]]. As he reached the doorknob, there was a spark of static discharge that ignited the benzene-soaked clothes, setting Dontae ablaze and eventually killing him. Dontae died from his burns, but not before he was able to jump into the pool.\n\n'''Best Theory''': Ulysses\n\n'''Scared''': Adrianna and Dana\n\n| LineColor       = 00A2CF\n}}{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| Title           = Kaboom\n| RTitle = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/whodunnit-2013/episode-3-season-1/kaboom/544574|title=''Whodunnit?''

As she tries to drive off, the golf cart explodes, sending Adrianna flying into a nearby tree to her death; the commotion wakes the other guests.\n\n'''Killed''': Adrianna\n\n'''Investigation''': The investigation covers three areas, with the following clues identified by various guests:\n* The crime scene (near the gates): Among the wreckage, the investigators find that the golf cart seat had been sliced open underneath, as if to plant something inside. A large tree branch had purposely been placed on the paved path, which apparently forced the cart onto the nearby grass. The investigators also discover a nearby post with a broken video camera mounted on it.\n* The last known whereabouts (the breakfast nook): The TV in the breakfast nook is still on. As the guests investigate, they see the television signal interrupted with surveillance footage of Adrianna; this is followed by the message, \"Drive off the property if you want to live.\" Several doors are marked with footprints, and almost every set of doors have been locked from the opposite side with cable ties securing them in place. Only one door leading outside is otherwise open.\n* The morgue (at the body's location, up in a tree): Adrianna's hand is holding onto a remote control, and while most of her body is burned, the most burn marks appear to be by her feet and legs.\n\n'''Riddle challenge''': The guests are given a golf ball with the words \"13 steps\" printed on it. This points to a golf cart parked outside down a stairway with 13 steps; the cart holds various remote gate openers with a clue leading to video tapes stored in an outside trash bin. Though the tapes have no useful video, the inside cover of each tape has a final clue that directs the guests to the attic. Ronnie alone is first to the attic, where he finds another monitor and a television remote with a \"bomb\" button on it. When he follows instructions on the monitor to press this button, the monitor shows Ronnie the footage of the golf cart exploding.\n\n'''Solution''': The killer had planted a bomb in the golf cart and set the branch in the path. The killer then left a DVD in the disc drive of the television in the breakfast nook. As Adrianna watched television, the killer remotely started the DVD, instructing her to drive off the premises in order to stay alive. Adrianna tried to leave the room, but the killer had used zip-ties to secure all the doors except the one leading outside. She reached the golf cart and sped off, and as she approached the gates, she was forced to drive off the path to avoid the tree branch. Adrianna tried to use the remote control to open the gates, but instead this activated the camera near the scene. The killer, already holed up in the attic with video surveillance equipment, used this as a signal to remotely trigger the bomb on the cart, killing Adrianna and sending her body flying into a tree.\n\n'''Best Theory''': Lindsey\n\n'''Scared''': Dana and Don\n\n| LineColor       = 00A2CF\n}}{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 4\n| Title           = Mountain Lyin\n| RTitle = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/whodunnit-2013/episode-4-season-1/mountain-lyin/544574|title=''Whodunnit?''

At breakfast, the guests are happy to see Dana return, but are shocked to see Don arrive safely as well; for the first time, no one has been killed overnight. Steak and eggs are served to the guests, but Scared guests Dana and Don receive raw steak. While Dana shares a cooked steak with Ulysses, Don goes to the kitchen alone to cook his raw steak, despite protests from the other guests. As Don is cooking his steak, a secret panel opens and a [[cougar]] leaps out and attacks Don, the sounds terrifying the other guests. Giles subdues the cougar with a tranquilizer dart before the guests are allowed to investigate. <!-- Please keep the name of the animal as \"cougar\". Please do not change it to \"mountain lion\" or \"puma\". If you believe that it is necessary to change the name, please join the discussion on the talk page. -->\n\n'''Killed''': Don\n\n'''Investigation''': The investigation covers three areas, with the following clues identified by various guests:\n* The crime scene (the kitchen): A pressure pad had been placed in front of the cooking stove where Don went to cook his steak.  When stepped on, the pressure pad opens a secret panel behind him, revealing where the cougar had been hiding.  In addition, the stove's heating coil had been rigged.\n* The suspect (the cougar; in place of the last known whereabouts): A tag around the cougar's neck indicates that it had been deliberately brought here.  The cougar has the steak in its mouth and some blood on its paws.\n* The morgue: While there were gashes noted in his leg and neck, there was a surprisingly small amount of blood on his body.  Don's skin is noted to be blotchy in an odd pink color.  A small amount of white powder is found on the front of his shirt.\n\n'''Riddle challenge''': The guests are given a magnifying glass and a clue on a small slip of paper, which leads them to the morgue where a [[periodic table]] is posted on the wall. The riddle points out the letters 'C' and 'N', the [[atomic symbol]]s for [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]]. Using a magnifying glass to read small print written underneath those two elements (which, not coincidentally, are found in [[cyanide]], CN<sup>\u2212</sup>) leads them upstairs to a closet with a clue written on a table cloth. This instructs the contestants to get their hunger for knowledge fed, as well as giving them a safe combination. A savvy Geno headed straight for the library, where he headed for the safe. Inside, was a blueprint that described how the stove was rigged.\n\n'''Solution''': After receiving an un-cooked steak for breakfast, Don went to the kitchen to cook it. When he stepped on the pressure pad that had been placed in front of the stove, a secret panel behind him opened, releasing the cougar. Not noticing the cougar behind him, Don turned on the stove. As the killer had rigged the kitchen stove to release cyanide, once Don turned it on, he inhaled a lethal amount of cyanide resulting in a quick death. Don fell to the ground, and the hungry cougar jumped on him and scratched him. The cougar then went to retrieve the uncooked steak on the stove, just before Giles tranquilized it.\n\n'''Best Theory''': Dana\n\n'''Scared''': Kam and Ulysses\n\n| LineColor       = 00A2CF\n}}{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 5\n| Title           = Bum Ba Dee Da\n| RTitle = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/whodunnit/544574|title=''Whodunnit?''

The killer has left a prerecorded message of the guests speaking, their words stitched together to create a message instructing them to meet at the stables the next morning. Giles leads the guests on a horseback ride through Rue Woods that surround the manor. As they progress forward, the horses are suddenly startled by a flock of birds. While the other guests control their horses, Ulysses and his horse are seen drifting from the group.  Some of the other guests call out to him, but it's too late as he slumps over, and both he and his horse take a tumble.\n\n'''Killed''': Ulysses\n\n'''Investigation''': Much of the episode takes place in Rue Woods instead of the mansion. The investigation covers three areas, with the following clues identified by various guests:\n* The crime scene (the trail): A [[Lampropeltis elapsoides|scarlet kingsnake]] is found in the horse's left saddle bag. Also, a tripwire was found to have released the birds from a cage.\n* The last known whereabouts (the horse stable): All the horses' nameplates are names from [[Greek mythology]], except for one named Oleander, whose window has [[Nerium|oleander flowers]] growing through it. Hidden in a nearby spittoon is some oleander crushed with a mortar and pestle. Also, there is a hammer and a box of \"ten finishing nails\"; an unaired clue shows only eight nails in the box.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/shows/whodunnit/clue-tracker?id=a2be1fb5-fe3c-43fb-9938-0dc2dfc5911b| title=Week 5 Clues, Bum Ba Dee Da - 19| accessdate = July 29, 2013 | publisher=ABC}}</ref>\n* The morgue (an outdoor makeshift one): A nearby sign displays poisonous and non-poisonous flora and fauna in the Rue Woods, including the poisonous oleander and the non-poisonous scarlet kingsnake. Ulysses has two small puncture wounds on his right calf. All of his clothes are hanging on a nearby clothesline, and his jeans reveal matching punctures. Later, it was revealed that there were wooden splinters where the jeans were punctured; this was missed by the guests.\n\n'''Riddle challenge''': The guests are told to find the right path by \"looking to the sky.\" The guests then race up a trail to a three-way fork, each path marked by a colored arrow. The path marked by the blue arrow (representing the color of sky) leads to a table with individual puzzles for each of the guests that, when solved, gives them a path to follow through the woods. The path leads to a shack filled with snakes. Those that arrive at the shack are allowed two minutes alone to find the murder weapon inside and solve the challenge. If their time runs out, they have to go to the back of the line and the next guest to have arrived has their turn. Cris alone finds the murder weapon: a small floorboard with two nails sticking out of it.\n\n'''Solution''': The killer first set up the bird cage and tripwire along the trail.  Back at the stable, the killer hammered two nails into a floorboard, in a pattern similar to what a [[snakebite]] would look like. The nails were laced with poisonous ground [[oleander]]. While riding along the path, one of the guest's horses set off the tripwire, which released the birds, startling the horses. In the ensuing commotion, the killer secretly struck Ulysses in the right leg with the floorboard, lethally poisoning him. Ulysses lost control of his horse, and both he and his horse fell. The killer later hid the floorboard and placed the non-poisonous kingsnake in Ulysses' horse's left saddle bag as a [[red herring]].\n\n'''Best Theory''': Cris\n\n'''Scared''': Dana, Geno, and Sasha\n\n| LineColor       = 00A2CF\n}}{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 6\n| Title           = All the World's a Stage\n| RTitle = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/whodunnit/544574|title=''Whodunnit?''

The next morning, the guests are in their rooms when they begin to hear [[pipe organ|organ]] music play. Geno, one of the three Scared guests, runs downstairs and finds Sasha posed at the piano, as if playing, and Dana posed standing near her, leaning on the piano with a martini glass by her side. Both are dead.\n\n'''Killed''': Dana and Sasha\n\n'''Investigation''': There was no crime scene to investigate, though it was noted that the foyer, where the victims were found, was very chilly. Instead, teams searched two last known whereabouts (each of the two victims' rooms).  Because the two rooms were adjacent to each other, each team had their own time to search the individual room and the shared hallway leading out from it. The investigation covers three areas, with the following clues identified by various guests:\n* Sasha's last known whereabouts (Sasha's room): There are large shoe prints and cart tracks on the floor; it's noted that the cart tracks leading into the room are lighter than the tracks leading out of the room. On the bed, a washcloth with a lipstick mark is found.\n* Dana's last known whereabouts (Dana's room): The door is locked, and a metal device is found sticking out from underneath the door. The team uses the contraption to open the locked door from the outside. Large shoe prints and cart tracks are seen on the floor. A set of footprints leads out from the bed to the door.\n**Shared hallway (both of the teams above had access to this area): The two adjacent rooms open out to a carpet rug, which shows both large shoe prints as well as cart tracks leading in and out of both rooms.  Footprints are also seen leading out of Dana's room. Further down the hallway, blood drops on the wooden floor lead to a hidden elevator.\n* The morgue: Both women have one wrist slashed open. They each have bits of cloth fiber in their nostrils as well. Each of their pajamas are found beside them; while Sasha's are clean, Dana's have a bloodstain dripping down the back of the left pant leg. This leads to the discovery of superficial cut wounds on Dana's left back.\n\n'''Riddle challenge''': The guests find [[effigy|effigies]] of themselves sitting in the seats of the movie theater. The first clue is presented in the form of a silent film, which leads them to find a second clue on the keys of the piano where Sasha and Dana were found. The clue contains a scalpel and another riddle that points them back to the movie theater. Using the scalpel, a final clue is found by cutting into the back of the effigy. This leads to the morgue, where a hidden room is found behind a cabinet. The scalpel is used to break into the sealed room, which turns out to be a second makeshift morgue, the objective of the riddle challenge. Cris is the first to find this. The hidden room contains two autopsy tables with a large amount of blood near their drains, a three-wheeled cart, a second washcloth with a lipstick mark on it (similar to the one found in Sasha's room), a bottle of [[chloroform]], a hunting knife, and a rack of clothes is also seen. Large size 13 sneakers with paper stuffed into the soles, so that someone with smaller feet can wear them, is also found.\n\n'''Solution''': The killer, wearing the large sneakers, used the door-opening contraption to break into Sasha's room and entered with the cart. After knocking Sasha out using the chloroform-soaked rag, the killer loaded her body into the cart and left the room. Next door, the killer re-used the contraption to open Dana's room, leaving the device behind. Waking Dana up at knifepoint, the killer coerced her out of bed and down the hall, jabbing the knife to her back and leaving a small blood trail. The killer forced Dana to roll the cart with Sasha to the elevator and to the makeshift morgue. After Dana tearfully placed Sasha on the autopsy table, the killer then knocked her out with another chloroform-soaked rag and put her on the other autopsy table. The killer slashed each of their wrists, killing them by [[exsanguination|letting all their blood drain out]]. After dressing them, the killer then posed them at the piano once [[rigor mortis]] had begun to set in, and turned up the air conditioning in order to keep them in place.\n\n'''Best Theory''': Kam\n\n'''Scared''': Geno and Ronnie\n| LineColor       = 00A2CF\n}}{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 7\n| Title           = Party Crasher\n| RTitle = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/whodunnit/tv-listings/544574|title=''Whodunnit?''

The guests return to their rooms to change into Hawaiian attire, and then head to the foyer, where they find it has been transformed into a luau. Giles joins in on the fun, handing his jacket off to Geno before doing the [[limbo (dance)|limbo]]. When Geno proposes a toast, the lights suddenly go off and a crash is heard. Returning with flashlights, the guests find Geno dead, crushed underneath a chandelier.\n\n'''Killed''': Geno\n\n'''Investigation''': Prior to the guests splitting up, an irritated Giles asks about the whereabouts of his cell phone, which has gone missing. The investigation covers three areas, with the following clues identified by various guests:\n* The crime scene (the foyer): The chandelier was found to have been lowered, as its cord extends from the ceiling to the floor. It's noted that the smeared blood on the floor appears to have originated from underneath Geno, rather than forming an outline around him if the chandelier had killed him. The Rue Manor crest on the dance floor is highlighted in green paint. A dual-pronged [[time switch|timer]] is found plugged into a nearby electrical socket with a scorch mark surrounding it, appearing to have caused a [[short circuit]].  Apparently, hidden behind nearby curtains was a lever that controlled the chandelier; this was missed by the guests.\n* The last known whereabouts (Geno's room): On Geno's bed, there is a lei made of [[Aleurites moluccanus|kukui]] nutshells covered in green paint. The lei is fitted with keyrings, serving as a homemade [[garrote]]. There is also a notepad with the remnant of a page that had been torn off. What had been written is still imprinted, and lightly shading with a pencil reveals the message, \"Steal Giles' cell phone and you will be 'spared.'\" A twisted bobby pin is also lying on the floor; this was missed.\n* The morgue: There are shards from the chandelier embedded in Geno's head, neck, and back. A gunshot slug is extracted from his abdomen. While the guests go through Geno's clothes, a cell phone suddenly begins to ring in Geno's pants pocket. The guests answer and are startled to hear Giles, who tells them that they must have his missing phone, and asks that they leave it where they found it.\n\n'''Riddle challenge''': The guests are blindfolded and taken to a room in the manor; when allowed to remove their blindfolds, they realize the room is pitch black. Fumbling around in the dark, they eventually find [[night vision device|night vision]] monoculars, which allows them to both read a note on the wall and find an exit tunnel to crawl through. This leads them to portable ultraviolet light wands and a clue that sends them to the morgue, where another clue with kukui nutshell leis are found. Disassembling the leis into individual nutshells and using the ultraviolet light reveals letters written on them, which when rearranged form the phrase \"Hear No Evil.\" This is a clue to the [[three wise monkeys]] statues in the library. The \"hear no evil\" monkey statue provides one final clue that points back to the foyer, where Kam alone finds a drawer containing a gun with a [[suppressor|silencer]], as well as night vision goggles.\n\nBefore the guests prepare to state their cases, the killer offers one additional clue: \"How exactly did Geno crash my party? Work this answer into your case study; your life depends on it.\"\n\n'''Solution''': In the foyer, the killer had used green [[luminous paint|fluorescent paint]] to highlight the Rue Manor crest on the dance floor. A timer was also placed in the socket and was set to short circuit the lights at midnight during the luau. A special kukui nutshell lei was designed for Geno, painted with an invisible fluorescent paint; the killer used the bobby pin to break into Geno's room to both leave the lei on his bed and also to write the note to steal Giles's phone. \"Plan A\" was for Geno to wear the lei to the luau; once the lights went out, the killer would strangle Geno.\n\nInstead, Geno took the note, left the lei behind, and headed to the luau. As instructed, while Giles did the limbo, Geno pocketed Giles' phone (according to the killer, this \"dishonesty\" gave more reason for the subsequent murder). Moving onto \"Plan B,\" after the lights went out, the killer put on the night vision goggles, and used the silenced gun to fire a [[contact shot]] into Geno's stomach, lethally wounding him. Then as planned, the killer dragged Geno to the illuminated crest on the dance floor. This served as a target for the chandelier, which the killer then dropped using the lever hidden behind the curtains. Finally, the killer hid the night vision goggles and gun in a nearby drawer.\n\n'''Best Theory''': Lindsey\n\n'''Scared''': Melina and Ronnie\n| LineColor       = 00A2CF\n}}{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 8\n| Title           = Frost Nixin\n| RTitle = <ref>{{cite web|url=http://tv.msn.com/tv/series-episodes/whodunnit/|title=''Whodunnit?''

Giles informs the guests that the killer has decided to have a spa day, with each guest receiving a different service: Melina, a facial; Kam, a royal massage; Lindsey, a mani-pedi; Cris, a yoga session; and Ronnie, a dip in the hot tub. While everyone else is inside enjoying their treatments, Ronnie is relaxing in the hot tub. Suddenly, an explosion blasts Ronnie out of the hot tub and into the adjacent pool. The remaining guests quickly run outside to find the pool covered in fog, and are there just in time to see Ronnie surface, dead.\n\n'''Killed''': Ronnie\n\n'''Investigation''': Giles announces that there are four areas to investigate. The guests are given ice picks to dig into a frozen block of ice containing a box with a key; Kam is the first to finish and earns the right to visit the new \"mystery area.\" He is also allowed 3 minutes at any of the other areas and chooses the crime scene. The remaining three guests must each choose a different area, but as they could not come to a decision, the killer had provided Giles cards to randomly assign these areas. The following clues are identified by various guests:\n* The crime scene (the pool): There are chunks of ice floating in both the pool and nearby hot tub, which is only half full. On the ledge by the hot tub is a cup of tea that has apparently been frozen into ice. An unaired clue shows an envelope in the pocket of Ronnie's robe, which had been left beside the pool.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/shows/whodunnit/clue-tracker#?id=8deb36d8-5b8b-4919-80eb-b6bfabf64de9|title=Week 8 Clues Image 6 |publisher=ABC |accessdate=August 13, 2013}}</ref>\n* The last known whereabouts (the library): Among the outgoing mail on the desk is a letter Ronnie wrote to Giles revealing who he thought the killer was, but the names in the letter have all been crossed out. Nearby is a tea set with sugar, cream, rice milk, and an unlabeled white powder resembling powdered cream. The teacup is also noted to be missing, with a stirring spoon on a nearby plate. There was also a hidden camera located on the belly of the \"see no evil\" monkey statue as well as a book about deadly poisons left pulled out on the bookshelf; these clues were missed.\n* The morgue: Ronnie's body is frozen, yet also has burn marks. There is foam still frothing at Ronnie's mouth. Using a nearby thermometer, he is found to be running a [[human body temperature|temperature of 105 degrees Fahrenheit]].\n* The mystery area (the attic): Much like in Adrianna's murder, this is simply a small room with a TV displaying security footage. The first scene is in the library, where Ronnie pours himself a cup of tea before sitting down to write a letter. This switches to a second scene at the hot tub, where Ronnie is relaxing before he appears to have fallen asleep. A final scene catches him being blasted out of the hot tub.\n\n'''Riddle challenge''': Giles starts the riddle off with a science experiment - he drops a canister into a contraption that then blasts ping pong balls everywhere. The guests each find a ping pong ball that says \"Kitchen\" and head there for the next clue. There are barrels of [[castor bean]]s for each of the guests, with a clue telling them to dig to find a small cylinder hidden inside. Opening this reveals a word search, and the guests are only allowed to visit areas they find hidden in the puzzle. One of the phrases is \"pool equipment,\" and going to the area where pool equipment is stored, Kam is the first to find an orange tank of [[liquid nitrogen]] hooked up to the hot tub water supply, with a timer on it.\n\n'''Solution''': The killer had noticed that Ronnie liked to add powdered cream to his tea. Seeing through the hidden camera that Ronnie had gone to the library to write a letter to Giles, the killer sent a maid to deliver a tea set, including powdered cream spiked with [[ricin]], a poison that can be extracted from the castor bean. After Ronnie left, the killer found the letter and scratched out all the names on it. Ronnie brought his poisoned tea with him to the hot tub, and when he turned on the jets, he unknowingly started the timer on the liquid nitrogen tank that the killer had previously hooked up to the hot tub water supply. The heated water from the hot tub magnified the effects of the ricin, heating Ronnie's body to a [[hyperthermia|lethal temperature]]. Once the timer went off, the liquid nitrogen entered the hot tub and reacted violently, blasting Ronnie's body into the pool and burning his skin, while at the same time instantly freezing the hot tub water, leaving chunks of ice floating alongside him.\n\n'''Best Theory''': Kam\n\n'''Scared''': Lindsey and Melina\n| LineColor       = 00A2CF\n}}{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 9\n| Title           = Golden Cuffs\n| RTitle = <ref>{{cite web|url=http://tv.msn.com/tv/series-episodes/whodunnit/|title=''Whodunnit?''

The guests celebrate and open presents containing [[champagne stemware|champagne flutes]]. They toast to finally making it out of Rue Manor, when suddenly, the driver makes a sharp U-turn and takes them back to the manor. They hurry in to discover a large TV has been placed in the foyer. When it turns on, the guests are shocked to see Giles tied up and surrounded by guns; he informs them that he has been kidnapped. Giles has been hidden away somewhere in the manor and pleads for the guests to find him quickly, for his life is on the line. He also warns them that failure to solve the upcoming crime will result in them all meeting a similar fate. Thick white smoke begins to pour into the foyer, and in the confusion, the other guests gradually realize that Melina has disappeared.\n\n'''Riddle challenge''': Speaking on the TV screen through voice masking software, the killer relays a riddle to the surviving guests, challenging them to find Melina. The riddle asks the guests to recall the code used to open the storage bin in Sheri's death; there are several clues to this combination in the lounge. After figuring out the code, Kam notices a locked door behind partially opened curtains in the foyer and uses the code to solve the riddle. The wall revolves, opening up a room full of artifacts from all of the previous murders. At the far end of the room, they find Melina strangled to death with the rigged kukui necklace from Geno's murder (the original \"Plan A\"). Kam receives a puzzle piece, giving him an advantage in the final challenge.\n\n'''Killed''': Melina\n\n'''Final challenge''': The killer presents the final three guests with a multi-part riddle challenge, in which they have to solve riddles related to the previous murders with the help of the \"reanimated bodies\" of the previous guests. Depending on their answer, guests receive one of two [[jigsaw puzzle|jigsaw puzzle pieces]] to fit into each of their own large question mark-shaped boards in the foyer. Puzzle pieces received from riddles answered correctly would light up under a [[black light]], while riddles answered incorrectly would result in puzzle pieces that would remain dark under the black light. Guests then return to the incorrectly answered riddles and try again. Briefly, the riddles are:\n* '''Skill''': Sheri's riddle requires guests to use a slingshot to strike one of two aquariums, one containing a picture of Sheri facing forward and the other, backward. Picking the aquarium with the picture showing which direction Sheri faced when the killer struck her resulted in a correct puzzle piece. While all three guests identified the correct fish tank, each of them required multiple attempts to break it.\n* '''Memory''': Dontae's riddle simply asks guests to pick the correct saint on the necklace he received the night of his death, [[Agatha of Sicily|St. Agatha]] or St. Elmo.  Kam's advantage in this final challenge was that he could skip this riddle.\n* '''Tactile''': Adrianna's riddle instructs guests to rebuild the bomb that was used as a prop in the riddle challenge for her murder, and then to cut the wire whose color corresponded to the color of the letters of the message that she received in the breakfast nook.\n* '''Logic''': Don's riddle prompts guests to put in order the steps to get Kona, the cougar, into its hiding place. Kam is noted to have missed this several times.\n* '''Excavation''': Ulysses' riddle asks guests to find the [[Lampropeltis elapsoides|scarlet kingsnake]] in the nearby bush and to drop it in the wooden basket.\n* '''Perception''': Sasha and Dana's riddle in the theater shows guests two images with several minor differences; guests have to correctly identify how many differences there are to receive the correct puzzle piece. Both Lindsey and Cris missed this on their first try.\n* '''Sensory Deprivation''': Geno's riddle has guests enter a pitch black room with a chest, which contains four items - night vision goggles, a gun, a kukui necklace, and a lei. Bringing the item that was not a part of Geno's murder nets a correct puzzle piece. Cris is seen to have initially incorrectly picked a gun.\n* '''Evidence''': Ronnie's riddle tells guests to find a castor bean among the many different beans in a hot tub.\n* '''Instinct''': Guests run to the attic to \"find the killer\" - and find Giles, untangled from his ropes. He claims the killer put him up to this, and asks guests to find his contract downstairs, read the fine print, and tell him whether or not he is the killer. Kam got this wrong at first.\n\nKam is the first to finish the challenge, and Cris finishes shortly thereafter; both receive a riddle that directs them to a room upstairs to find the killer. Lindsey, the last to finish, is instead directed to the room where they earlier had found Melina.\n\n'''The Killer Unmasked''': Upstairs, Kam and Cris find themselves in a room filled with photographs of the murders along with video monitors showing live surveillance footage around Rue Manor. They begin to search frantically for what they believe is the final riddle that will reveal who the killer is, when all of a sudden, the monitor switches to a camera showing Lindsey entering the room from the foyer. Lindsey steps in and is distracted by the revolving door spinning behind her, not noticing the suit of armor poised to fire in front of her. Having set the trap off, Lindsey receives an arrow to her throat as her \"prize\" for being runner-up.\n\n'''Killed''': Lindsey\n\nStunned, Kam suddenly realizes that Cris is the killer, who menacingly gives one final rhyme: \"I won't be played by your foolish game. The killer could be you...or me just the same. Enough of the riddles, the ruckus, the rhymes. I committed those murders, eleven straight times. It is true, I am the real sinner. Congratulations, Kam, you are the winner.\"\n\n'''The Killer''': Cris\n\nGiles enters the room and gives Kam golden handcuffs to arrest Cris, who willingly is taken away by the police (incidentally played by the two executive producers, Zuiker and Abrego), her sadistic game over.  Giles awards Kam his prize and walks him out. On his way out of the mansion, Kam is greeted by the previously eliminated guests, who have been allowed to [[breaking character|break character]] as they see him off, most congratulating him on his victory. Giles offers to drive him wherever he wishes to go, to which Kam answers \"Home\".\n\n'''Winner''': Kam\n\nIn a post-show interview, it was revealed that the guests did not actually perform the final challenge simultaneously, as it would've been unfair if one guest was forced to wait while another guest was completing a station. Instead, each guest was timed individually, and in the end, Kam finished 44 seconds faster than Lindsey.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnET6oEFveU |title=AfterBuzz TV AfterShow  |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=August 30, 2013}}</ref>\n| LineColor       = 00A2CF\n}}\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\n''Whodunnit?'' received generally mixed reviews from critics.\n\nThe series received 43 out of 100 at [[Metacritic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/whodunnit|title=Whodunnit?: Season 1|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=June 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s Brian Lowry thought that the show was \"especially brain-numbing\", as the mysteries weren't suspenseful or intriguing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/reviews/whodunnit-1200496640/|title=Review: \"Whodunnit?\"|last=Lowry|first=Brian|work=Variety|publisher=Variety Media, LLC|date=June 17, 2013|accessdate=June 26, 2013}}</ref> Mary McNamara of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said that it was \"not terribly exciting\" and that the premiere episode \"didn't leave enough time for at-home deduction or competitive theories.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-whodunnit-review,0,1117011.story | title=Review: 'Whodunnit?' reality TV 'murder' mystery off to slow start | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=June 21, 2013 | accessdate=2013-06-22}}</ref> Allison Keene of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' thought that the series generally ended up \"either painful or unintentionally funny\".

Within the show's fiction, the guests, along with Giles and two maids, are trapped by the killer within the house grounds until they determine who the killer is. An early episode shows that Giles is wearing an [[ankle monitor]] that forbids him from leaving. In many ways, Giles acts as a puppet for the killer; the killer sends messages to Giles, who reads them to the surviving guests.\n\nEach episode, at least one guest is \"murdered\" (through staged events by production) by the killer, either while the victim is alone or through pre-arranged circumstances while the remaining guests are congregated as to avoid revealing their identity. After the shock of the event, Giles offers the remaining guests an opportunity to search one of three areas (usually the crime scene, the last known whereabouts, or the morgue containing the victim's body) to discover clues about how the murder was carried out. Guests are free to select which area to search, though they are allowed access to only one area with a limited amount of time, and are confined to the bounds set by production, sometimes marked off with [[police tape]]. Guests then participate in a riddle challenge that leads them in a competitive search through the mansion. The guest who is able to complete the challenge receives an additional clue that may greatly help in solving how the murder was committed.\n\nGuests are given limited opportunities to congregate, where they can share, withhold, or lie about whatever information they find from their investigations and riddle challenges; at all other times, guests are isolated from each other. In the first season, this led to the ad hoc formation of two informal teams that tried to assure information was withheld from the other team, in an attempt to assure their own team's advancement to the next round. Though the murders and riddle challenges are presented as having been masterminded by the killer, in reality the guest playing the killer is as unaware of upcoming deaths and challenges as the other guests, and is not given any information from production about the larger social game.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web | url = http://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/archives/whodunnit/2013_Jul_14_zuiker-interview | title = Whodunnit: all your questions answered | accessdate = July 15, 2013 | last = Dehnart | first = Andy | date = July 14, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nLater, guests are individually taken to the mansion library where, in monologue, they describe to the unseen killer how they believe the murder took place and make an accusation as to who the killer is. However, each elimination is actually based on the guests' performance on an unaired written quiz (similar to ''[[The Mole (U.S. TV series)|The Mole]]'') that objectively assesses the accuracy of their theories.<ref name=\":0\" /> The quiz consists of 12-15 short answer questions about the investigation sites and the riddle challenge; ties are broken based on the time taken to complete the quiz.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://robhasawebsite.com/whodunnit-episode-6-recap-geno-walker-interview/ |title=Talking Whodunnit with the Latest Victim of \u2018The Killer\u2019 |last1=Cesternino |first1=Rob |last2=Walker |first2=Geno |date=July 29, 2013 |website=Rob Has a Website |publisher=(around 48:30 on the podcast) |accessdate=July 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring dinner, Giles presents a message from the killer. The message states which guest had the most correct theory and is subsequently spared from being the killer's next victim. The message then fully explains how the murder was completed. After this, Giles hands an envelope to each remaining guest. Those receiving cards with the word \"Spared\" performed well enough to advance to the next episode. The lowest-scoring guest, along with at least one other low-scoring guest will receive a card with the word \"Scared.\" As noted above, the guest playing the killer is as unaware of how the murders are committed as the rest of the guests are, and so may also receive a \"Scared\" card as well; however, the killer cannot be eliminated.<ref name=\"pennlivebehindscenes\">{{cite web | url = http://www.pennlive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2013/07/whodunnit_behind-the-scenes_se.html | title = 'Whodunnit?' behind-the-scenes secrets revealed | accessdate = July 10, 2013 | last = Zelko | first = Abbey | date = July 9, 2013 }}</ref> The lowest-scoring guest is then eliminated from the competition by being \"murdered by the killer\", in turn setting up the murder to be solved in the next episode.\n\nIn the finale, the final three guests (the killer and the two remaining players) compete in a multi-part riddle and memory challenge based on elements from all of the previous murders. The first player to complete this challenge is directed to a final room to confront the killer, while the last player is sent elsewhere and subsequently eliminated. The killer confesses his or her identity to the last guest and congratulates them for winning the game.

After a brief meet-and-greet, the guests split up to explore the house, but race back when they hear a shattering of glass. They find Sheri \"dead\" by a broken fish tank in the house's foyer with exposed wires from a nearby lamp electrifying her body.\n\n'''Investigation''': The investigation covers three areas, with the following clues identified by various guests:\n* The crime scene (the foyer): The scene reveals the broken fish tank, a severed lamp wire, and a large blood stain underneath where Sheri's head lay.\n* The morgue: The only apparent wounds on Sheri's body are shards of glass in her forehead, and a large pellet pulled from the back of her neck.\n* The last known whereabouts (Sheri's room): The door to Sheri's room shows signs of forced entry. The shower in Sheri's bathroom is still running. A few letters are seen written into the fogged portion of the bathroom mirror, leading the investigators to use a nearby steamer to reveal a message by fogging the entire mirror: \"Meet me at the fish tank, I have vital info for you.\"\n\n'''Riddle challenge''': The guests are each given a key that has imprinted on it \"13:17\" and the image of two crowns. This turns out to refer to the [[Bible|biblical]] verse [[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] 13:17, which starts: \"Open the east window.\" The guests find one of the panes of glass missing at the eastern window of the main room, along with a three-digit number engraved in the window frame. This turns out to be the code to a combination lock on a garden storage bin outside, visible straight ahead from the window. Opening it reveals a crowbar and a slingshot. Ronnie is the first to find this clue, though several guests are with him at the time.\n\n'''Solution''': The killer severed the wire on the lamp by the fish tank and removed a pane of glass from the main room. The killer then used a crowbar to break into Sheri's room while she was showering and wrote the message on the mirror in the bathroom, and then waited outside for her arrival.  Sheri saw the message upon leaving the shower and headed downstairs.  Once Sheri reached the fish tank and turned her back, the killer fired a pellet through the open window into the back of Sheri's neck. Sheri was killed on impact, falling forward into the tank, damaging the glass, and then falling back onto the rug. The crack on the tank shortly gave way, but allowed the killer time to hide the tools in the garden bin. The water from the tank splashed over Sheri's body and the nearby carpet, and the spliced lamp cord electrified the area.\n\n'''Best Theory''': Sasha\n\n'''Scared''': Don and Dontae\n\n| LineColor       = 00A2CF\n}}{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| Title           = Fire Starter\n| RTitle = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/whodunnit-2013/episode-2-season-1/fire-starter/544574|title=''Whodunnit?''

During the night, the fire alarm goes off, and all the guests, except Dontae, gather outside. As they wait, Dontae comes running out of the house, engulfed in flames, and jumps into the pool. Despite the flames being doused, Dontae is found \"dead.\"\n\n'''Killed''': Dontae\n\n'''Investigation''': The investigation covers three areas, with the following clues identified by various guests:\n* The crime scene (the pool): With the body removed, the guests find loose scraps from Dontae's pajamas and socks, finding that neither matches with what the other guests were given to wear. They also find a medallion inscribed with a seal of [[Agatha of Sicily|St. Agatha]] at the bottom of the pool.\n* The morgue: Dontae's chest has the largest burnt area, meaning that it was likely the point of ignition; his right hand and arm are also severely burned. The morgue's investigators also discover that Dontae's pajamas are different from the other guests'.\n* The last known whereabouts (Dontae's room): The door has a large spread of soot from the door handle, and the nearby lampshade is partially burned, but no other parts of the room seem affected. An empty case by Dontae's bed includes a note suggesting there was a gift for Dontae from St. Agatha, the patron saint of fire, to help protect him.  A [[shag (fabric)|shaggy rug]] leads from the bed to the door.\n\n'''Riddle challenge''': Each guest is given a white flag with the house [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] on it and is told to look for \"fire in liquid form.\" This clue leads to a bottle of [[benzene]] that, when sprayed on the flag, reveals a pink strip across the house crest. This guides them to a door upstairs that has a similar pink stripe running through the house crest on it; the door also has a rug in front of it. Kam reaches the door, receiving a brief [[electric shock]] when he attempts to open it; this shock ignites the pink stripe on the door. Cris and Ulysses are with him at that time.\n\n'''Solution''': The killer provided Dontae with different pajamas that had been sprayed with odorless [[benzene]] and special socks that were more prone to generating static electricity. In addition, the killer left behind a pendant of [[St. Agatha]] with a note that read, \"Patron saint, protector from fire. Sleep well.\" When Dontae retired for the night, he put on the clothes and pendant and went to sleep. The killer then set off the fire alarm at 4:38 in the morning. Like the other guests, Dontae got up but ran across the shag carpet in his special socks, generating [[static electricity]]. As he reached the doorknob, there was a spark of static discharge that ignited the benzene-soaked clothes, setting Dontae ablaze and eventually killing him. Dontae died from his burns, but not before he was able to jump into the pool.\n\n'''Best Theory''': Ulysses\n\n'''Scared''': Adrianna and Dana\n\n| LineColor       = 00A2CF\n}}{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| Title           = Kaboom\n| RTitle = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/whodunnit-2013/episode-3-season-1/kaboom/544574|title=''Whodunnit?''

As she tries to drive off, the golf cart explodes, sending Adrianna flying into a nearby tree to her death; the commotion wakes the other guests.\n\n'''Killed''': Adrianna\n\n'''Investigation''': The investigation covers three areas, with the following clues identified by various guests:\n* The crime scene (near the gates): Among the wreckage, the investigators find that the golf cart seat had been sliced open underneath, as if to plant something inside. A large tree branch had purposely been placed on the paved path, which apparently forced the cart onto the nearby grass. The investigators also discover a nearby post with a broken video camera mounted on it.\n* The last known whereabouts (the breakfast nook): The TV in the breakfast nook is still on. As the guests investigate, they see the television signal interrupted with surveillance footage of Adrianna; this is followed by the message, \"Drive off the property if you want to live.\" Several doors are marked with footprints, and almost every set of doors have been locked from the opposite side with cable ties securing them in place. Only one door leading outside is otherwise open.\n* The morgue (at the body's location, up in a tree): Adrianna's hand is holding onto a remote control, and while most of her body is burned, the most burn marks appear to be by her feet and legs.\n\n'''Riddle challenge''': The guests are given a golf ball with the words \"13 steps\" printed on it. This points to a golf cart parked outside down a stairway with 13 steps; the cart holds various remote gate openers with a clue leading to video tapes stored in an outside trash bin. Though the tapes have no useful video, the inside cover of each tape has a final clue that directs the guests to the attic. Ronnie alone is first to the attic, where he finds another monitor and a television remote with a \"bomb\" button on it. When he follows instructions on the monitor to press this button, the monitor shows Ronnie the footage of the golf cart exploding.\n\n'''Solution''': The killer had planted a bomb in the golf cart and set the branch in the path. The killer then left a DVD in the disc drive of the television in the breakfast nook. As Adrianna watched television, the killer remotely started the DVD, instructing her to drive off the premises in order to stay alive. Adrianna tried to leave the room, but the killer had used zip-ties to secure all the doors except the one leading outside. She reached the golf cart and sped off, and as she approached the gates, she was forced to drive off the path to avoid the tree branch. Adrianna tried to use the remote control to open the gates, but instead this activated the camera near the scene. The killer, already holed up in the attic with video surveillance equipment, used this as a signal to remotely trigger the bomb on the cart, killing Adrianna and sending her body flying into a tree.\n\n'''Best Theory''': Lindsey\n\n'''Scared''': Dana and Don\n\n| LineColor       = 00A2CF\n}}{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 4\n| Title           = Mountain Lyin\n| RTitle = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/whodunnit-2013/episode-4-season-1/mountain-lyin/544574|title=''Whodunnit?''

At breakfast, the guests are happy to see Dana return, but are shocked to see Don arrive safely as well; for the first time, no one has been killed overnight. Steak and eggs are served to the guests, but Scared guests Dana and Don receive raw steak. While Dana shares a cooked steak with Ulysses, Don goes to the kitchen alone to cook his raw steak, despite protests from the other guests. As Don is cooking his steak, a secret panel opens and a [[cougar]] leaps out and attacks Don, the sounds terrifying the other guests. Giles subdues the cougar with a tranquilizer dart before the guests are allowed to investigate. <!-- Please keep the name of the animal as \"cougar\". Please do not change it to \"mountain lion\" or \"puma\". If you believe that it is necessary to change the name, please join the discussion on the talk page. -->\n\n'''Killed''': Don\n\n'''Investigation''': The investigation covers three areas, with the following clues identified by various guests:\n* The crime scene (the kitchen): A pressure pad had been placed in front of the cooking stove where Don went to cook his steak.  When stepped on, the pressure pad opens a secret panel behind him, revealing where the cougar had been hiding.  In addition, the stove's heating coil had been rigged.\n* The suspect (the cougar; in place of the last known whereabouts): A tag around the cougar's neck indicates that it had been deliberately brought here.  The cougar has the steak in its mouth and some blood on its paws.\n* The morgue: While there were gashes noted in his leg and neck, there was a surprisingly small amount of blood on his body.  Don's skin is noted to be blotchy in an odd pink color.  A small amount of white powder is found on the front of his shirt.\n\n'''Riddle challenge''': The guests are given a magnifying glass and a clue on a small slip of paper, which leads them to the morgue where a [[periodic table]] is posted on the wall. The riddle points out the letters 'C' and 'N', the [[atomic symbol]]s for [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]]. Using a magnifying glass to read small print written underneath those two elements (which, not coincidentally, are found in [[cyanide]], CN<sup>\u2212</sup>) leads them upstairs to a closet with a clue written on a table cloth. This instructs the contestants to get their hunger for knowledge fed, as well as giving them a safe combination. A savvy Geno headed straight for the library, where he headed for the safe. Inside, was a blueprint that described how the stove was rigged.\n\n'''Solution''': After receiving an un-cooked steak for breakfast, Don went to the kitchen to cook it. When he stepped on the pressure pad that had been placed in front of the stove, a secret panel behind him opened, releasing the cougar. Not noticing the cougar behind him, Don turned on the stove. As the killer had rigged the kitchen stove to release cyanide, once Don turned it on, he inhaled a lethal amount of cyanide resulting in a quick death. Don fell to the ground, and the hungry cougar jumped on him and scratched him. The cougar then went to retrieve the uncooked steak on the stove, just before Giles tranquilized it.\n\n'''Best Theory''': Dana\n\n'''Scared''': Kam and Ulysses\n\n| LineColor       = 00A2CF\n}}{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 5\n| Title           = Bum Ba Dee Da\n| RTitle = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/whodunnit/544574|title=''Whodunnit?''

The killer has left a prerecorded message of the guests speaking, their words stitched together to create a message instructing them to meet at the stables the next morning. Giles leads the guests on a horseback ride through Rue Woods that surround the manor. As they progress forward, the horses are suddenly startled by a flock of birds. While the other guests control their horses, Ulysses and his horse are seen drifting from the group.  Some of the other guests call out to him, but it's too late as he slumps over, and both he and his horse take a tumble.\n\n'''Killed''': Ulysses\n\n'''Investigation''': Much of the episode takes place in Rue Woods instead of the mansion. The investigation covers three areas, with the following clues identified by various guests:\n* The crime scene (the trail): A [[Lampropeltis elapsoides|scarlet kingsnake]] is found in the horse's left saddle bag. Also, a tripwire was found to have released the birds from a cage.\n* The last known whereabouts (the horse stable): All the horses' nameplates are names from [[Greek mythology]], except for one named Oleander, whose window has [[Nerium|oleander flowers]] growing through it. Hidden in a nearby spittoon is some oleander crushed with a mortar and pestle. Also, there is a hammer and a box of \"ten finishing nails\"; an unaired clue shows only eight nails in the box.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/shows/whodunnit/clue-tracker?id=a2be1fb5-fe3c-43fb-9938-0dc2dfc5911b| title=Week 5 Clues, Bum Ba Dee Da - 19| accessdate = July 29, 2013 | publisher=ABC}}</ref>\n* The morgue (an outdoor makeshift one): A nearby sign displays poisonous and non-poisonous flora and fauna in the Rue Woods, including the poisonous oleander and the non-poisonous scarlet kingsnake. Ulysses has two small puncture wounds on his right calf. All of his clothes are hanging on a nearby clothesline, and his jeans reveal matching punctures. Later, it was revealed that there were wooden splinters where the jeans were punctured; this was missed by the guests.\n\n'''Riddle challenge''': The guests are told to find the right path by \"looking to the sky.\" The guests then race up a trail to a three-way fork, each path marked by a colored arrow. The path marked by the blue arrow (representing the color of sky) leads to a table with individual puzzles for each of the guests that, when solved, gives them a path to follow through the woods. The path leads to a shack filled with snakes. Those that arrive at the shack are allowed two minutes alone to find the murder weapon inside and solve the challenge. If their time runs out, they have to go to the back of the line and the next guest to have arrived has their turn. Cris alone finds the murder weapon: a small floorboard with two nails sticking out of it.\n\n'''Solution''': The killer first set up the bird cage and tripwire along the trail.  Back at the stable, the killer hammered two nails into a floorboard, in a pattern similar to what a [[snakebite]] would look like. The nails were laced with poisonous ground [[oleander]]. While riding along the path, one of the guest's horses set off the tripwire, which released the birds, startling the horses. In the ensuing commotion, the killer secretly struck Ulysses in the right leg with the floorboard, lethally poisoning him. Ulysses lost control of his horse, and both he and his horse fell. The killer later hid the floorboard and placed the non-poisonous kingsnake in Ulysses' horse's left saddle bag as a [[red herring]].\n\n'''Best Theory''': Cris\n\n'''Scared''': Dana, Geno, and Sasha\n\n| LineColor       = 00A2CF\n}}{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 6\n| Title           = All the World's a Stage\n| RTitle = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/whodunnit/544574|title=''Whodunnit?''

The next morning, the guests are in their rooms when they begin to hear [[pipe organ|organ]] music play. Geno, one of the three Scared guests, runs downstairs and finds Sasha posed at the piano, as if playing, and Dana posed standing near her, leaning on the piano with a martini glass by her side. Both are dead.\n\n'''Killed''': Dana and Sasha\n\n'''Investigation''': There was no crime scene to investigate, though it was noted that the foyer, where the victims were found, was very chilly. Instead, teams searched two last known whereabouts (each of the two victims' rooms).  Because the two rooms were adjacent to each other, each team had their own time to search the individual room and the shared hallway leading out from it. The investigation covers three areas, with the following clues identified by various guests:\n* Sasha's last known whereabouts (Sasha's room): There are large shoe prints and cart tracks on the floor; it's noted that the cart tracks leading into the room are lighter than the tracks leading out of the room. On the bed, a washcloth with a lipstick mark is found.\n* Dana's last known whereabouts (Dana's room): The door is locked, and a metal device is found sticking out from underneath the door. The team uses the contraption to open the locked door from the outside. Large shoe prints and cart tracks are seen on the floor. A set of footprints leads out from the bed to the door.\n**Shared hallway (both of the teams above had access to this area): The two adjacent rooms open out to a carpet rug, which shows both large shoe prints as well as cart tracks leading in and out of both rooms.  Footprints are also seen leading out of Dana's room. Further down the hallway, blood drops on the wooden floor lead to a hidden elevator.\n* The morgue: Both women have one wrist slashed open. They each have bits of cloth fiber in their nostrils as well. Each of their pajamas are found beside them; while Sasha's are clean, Dana's have a bloodstain dripping down the back of the left pant leg. This leads to the discovery of superficial cut wounds on Dana's left back.\n\n'''Riddle challenge''': The guests find [[effigy|effigies]] of themselves sitting in the seats of the movie theater. The first clue is presented in the form of a silent film, which leads them to find a second clue on the keys of the piano where Sasha and Dana were found. The clue contains a scalpel and another riddle that points them back to the movie theater. Using the scalpel, a final clue is found by cutting into the back of the effigy. This leads to the morgue, where a hidden room is found behind a cabinet. The scalpel is used to break into the sealed room, which turns out to be a second makeshift morgue, the objective of the riddle challenge. Cris is the first to find this. The hidden room contains two autopsy tables with a large amount of blood near their drains, a three-wheeled cart, a second washcloth with a lipstick mark on it (similar to the one found in Sasha's room), a bottle of [[chloroform]], a hunting knife, and a rack of clothes is also seen. Large size 13 sneakers with paper stuffed into the soles, so that someone with smaller feet can wear them, is also found.\n\n'''Solution''': The killer, wearing the large sneakers, used the door-opening contraption to break into Sasha's room and entered with the cart. After knocking Sasha out using the chloroform-soaked rag, the killer loaded her body into the cart and left the room. Next door, the killer re-used the contraption to open Dana's room, leaving the device behind. Waking Dana up at knifepoint, the killer coerced her out of bed and down the hall, jabbing the knife to her back and leaving a small blood trail. The killer forced Dana to roll the cart with Sasha to the elevator and to the makeshift morgue. After Dana tearfully placed Sasha on the autopsy table, the killer then knocked her out with another chloroform-soaked rag and put her on the other autopsy table. The killer slashed each of their wrists, killing them by [[exsanguination|letting all their blood drain out]]. After dressing them, the killer then posed them at the piano once [[rigor mortis]] had begun to set in, and turned up the air conditioning in order to keep them in place.\n\n'''Best Theory''': Kam\n\n'''Scared''': Geno and Ronnie\n| LineColor       = 00A2CF\n}}{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 7\n| Title           = Party Crasher\n| RTitle = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/whodunnit/tv-listings/544574|title=''Whodunnit?''

The guests return to their rooms to change into Hawaiian attire, and then head to the foyer, where they find it has been transformed into a luau. Giles joins in on the fun, handing his jacket off to Geno before doing the [[limbo (dance)|limbo]]. When Geno proposes a toast, the lights suddenly go off and a crash is heard. Returning with flashlights, the guests find Geno dead, crushed underneath a chandelier.\n\n'''Killed''': Geno\n\n'''Investigation''': Prior to the guests splitting up, an irritated Giles asks about the whereabouts of his cell phone, which has gone missing. The investigation covers three areas, with the following clues identified by various guests:\n* The crime scene (the foyer): The chandelier was found to have been lowered, as its cord extends from the ceiling to the floor. It's noted that the smeared blood on the floor appears to have originated from underneath Geno, rather than forming an outline around him if the chandelier had killed him. The Rue Manor crest on the dance floor is highlighted in green paint. A dual-pronged [[time switch|timer]] is found plugged into a nearby electrical socket with a scorch mark surrounding it, appearing to have caused a [[short circuit]].  Apparently, hidden behind nearby curtains was a lever that controlled the chandelier; this was missed by the guests.\n* The last known whereabouts (Geno's room): On Geno's bed, there is a lei made of [[Aleurites moluccanus|kukui]] nutshells covered in green paint. The lei is fitted with keyrings, serving as a homemade [[garrote]]. There is also a notepad with the remnant of a page that had been torn off. What had been written is still imprinted, and lightly shading with a pencil reveals the message, \"Steal Giles' cell phone and you will be 'spared.'\" A twisted bobby pin is also lying on the floor; this was missed.\n* The morgue: There are shards from the chandelier embedded in Geno's head, neck, and back. A gunshot slug is extracted from his abdomen. While the guests go through Geno's clothes, a cell phone suddenly begins to ring in Geno's pants pocket. The guests answer and are startled to hear Giles, who tells them that they must have his missing phone, and asks that they leave it where they found it.\n\n'''Riddle challenge''': The guests are blindfolded and taken to a room in the manor; when allowed to remove their blindfolds, they realize the room is pitch black. Fumbling around in the dark, they eventually find [[night vision device|night vision]] monoculars, which allows them to both read a note on the wall and find an exit tunnel to crawl through. This leads them to portable ultraviolet light wands and a clue that sends them to the morgue, where another clue with kukui nutshell leis are found. Disassembling the leis into individual nutshells and using the ultraviolet light reveals letters written on them, which when rearranged form the phrase \"Hear No Evil.\" This is a clue to the [[three wise monkeys]] statues in the library. The \"hear no evil\" monkey statue provides one final clue that points back to the foyer, where Kam alone finds a drawer containing a gun with a [[suppressor|silencer]], as well as night vision goggles.\n\nBefore the guests prepare to state their cases, the killer offers one additional clue: \"How exactly did Geno crash my party? Work this answer into your case study; your life depends on it.\"\n\n'''Solution''': In the foyer, the killer had used green [[luminous paint|fluorescent paint]] to highlight the Rue Manor crest on the dance floor. A timer was also placed in the socket and was set to short circuit the lights at midnight during the luau. A special kukui nutshell lei was designed for Geno, painted with an invisible fluorescent paint; the killer used the bobby pin to break into Geno's room to both leave the lei on his bed and also to write the note to steal Giles's phone. \"Plan A\" was for Geno to wear the lei to the luau; once the lights went out, the killer would strangle Geno.\n\nInstead, Geno took the note, left the lei behind, and headed to the luau. As instructed, while Giles did the limbo, Geno pocketed Giles' phone (according to the killer, this \"dishonesty\" gave more reason for the subsequent murder). Moving onto \"Plan B,\" after the lights went out, the killer put on the night vision goggles, and used the silenced gun to fire a [[contact shot]] into Geno's stomach, lethally wounding him. Then as planned, the killer dragged Geno to the illuminated crest on the dance floor. This served as a target for the chandelier, which the killer then dropped using the lever hidden behind the curtains. Finally, the killer hid the night vision goggles and gun in a nearby drawer.\n\n'''Best Theory''': Lindsey\n\n'''Scared''': Melina and Ronnie\n| LineColor       = 00A2CF\n}}{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 8\n| Title           = Frost Nixin\n| RTitle = <ref>{{cite web|url=http://tv.msn.com/tv/series-episodes/whodunnit/|title=''Whodunnit?''

Giles informs the guests that the killer has decided to have a spa day, with each guest receiving a different service: Melina, a facial; Kam, a royal massage; Lindsey, a mani-pedi; Cris, a yoga session; and Ronnie, a dip in the hot tub. While everyone else is inside enjoying their treatments, Ronnie is relaxing in the hot tub. Suddenly, an explosion blasts Ronnie out of the hot tub and into the adjacent pool. The remaining guests quickly run outside to find the pool covered in fog, and are there just in time to see Ronnie surface, dead.\n\n'''Killed''': Ronnie\n\n'''Investigation''': Giles announces that there are four areas to investigate. The guests are given ice picks to dig into a frozen block of ice containing a box with a key; Kam is the first to finish and earns the right to visit the new \"mystery area.\" He is also allowed 3 minutes at any of the other areas and chooses the crime scene. The remaining three guests must each choose a different area, but as they could not come to a decision, the killer had provided Giles cards to randomly assign these areas. The following clues are identified by various guests:\n* The crime scene (the pool): There are chunks of ice floating in both the pool and nearby hot tub, which is only half full. On the ledge by the hot tub is a cup of tea that has apparently been frozen into ice. An unaired clue shows an envelope in the pocket of Ronnie's robe, which had been left beside the pool.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/shows/whodunnit/clue-tracker#?id=8deb36d8-5b8b-4919-80eb-b6bfabf64de9|title=Week 8 Clues Image 6 |publisher=ABC |accessdate=August 13, 2013}}</ref>\n* The last known whereabouts (the library): Among the outgoing mail on the desk is a letter Ronnie wrote to Giles revealing who he thought the killer was, but the names in the letter have all been crossed out. Nearby is a tea set with sugar, cream, rice milk, and an unlabeled white powder resembling powdered cream. The teacup is also noted to be missing, with a stirring spoon on a nearby plate. There was also a hidden camera located on the belly of the \"see no evil\" monkey statue as well as a book about deadly poisons left pulled out on the bookshelf; these clues were missed.\n* The morgue: Ronnie's body is frozen, yet also has burn marks. There is foam still frothing at Ronnie's mouth. Using a nearby thermometer, he is found to be running a [[human body temperature|temperature of 105 degrees Fahrenheit]].\n* The mystery area (the attic): Much like in Adrianna's murder, this is simply a small room with a TV displaying security footage. The first scene is in the library, where Ronnie pours himself a cup of tea before sitting down to write a letter. This switches to a second scene at the hot tub, where Ronnie is relaxing before he appears to have fallen asleep. A final scene catches him being blasted out of the hot tub.\n\n'''Riddle challenge''': Giles starts the riddle off with a science experiment - he drops a canister into a contraption that then blasts ping pong balls everywhere. The guests each find a ping pong ball that says \"Kitchen\" and head there for the next clue. There are barrels of [[castor bean]]s for each of the guests, with a clue telling them to dig to find a small cylinder hidden inside. Opening this reveals a word search, and the guests are only allowed to visit areas they find hidden in the puzzle. One of the phrases is \"pool equipment,\" and going to the area where pool equipment is stored, Kam is the first to find an orange tank of [[liquid nitrogen]] hooked up to the hot tub water supply, with a timer on it.\n\n'''Solution''': The killer had noticed that Ronnie liked to add powdered cream to his tea. Seeing through the hidden camera that Ronnie had gone to the library to write a letter to Giles, the killer sent a maid to deliver a tea set, including powdered cream spiked with [[ricin]], a poison that can be extracted from the castor bean. After Ronnie left, the killer found the letter and scratched out all the names on it. Ronnie brought his poisoned tea with him to the hot tub, and when he turned on the jets, he unknowingly started the timer on the liquid nitrogen tank that the killer had previously hooked up to the hot tub water supply. The heated water from the hot tub magnified the effects of the ricin, heating Ronnie's body to a [[hyperthermia|lethal temperature]]. Once the timer went off, the liquid nitrogen entered the hot tub and reacted violently, blasting Ronnie's body into the pool and burning his skin, while at the same time instantly freezing the hot tub water, leaving chunks of ice floating alongside him.\n\n'''Best Theory''': Kam\n\n'''Scared''': Lindsey and Melina\n| LineColor       = 00A2CF\n}}{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 9\n| Title           = Golden Cuffs\n| RTitle = <ref>{{cite web|url=http://tv.msn.com/tv/series-episodes/whodunnit/|title=''Whodunnit?''

The guests celebrate and open presents containing [[champagne stemware|champagne flutes]]. They toast to finally making it out of Rue Manor, when suddenly, the driver makes a sharp U-turn and takes them back to the manor. They hurry in to discover a large TV has been placed in the foyer. When it turns on, the guests are shocked to see Giles tied up and surrounded by guns; he informs them that he has been kidnapped. Giles has been hidden away somewhere in the manor and pleads for the guests to find him quickly, for his life is on the line. He also warns them that failure to solve the upcoming crime will result in them all meeting a similar fate. Thick white smoke begins to pour into the foyer, and in the confusion, the other guests gradually realize that Melina has disappeared.\n\n'''Riddle challenge''': Speaking on the TV screen through voice masking software, the killer relays a riddle to the surviving guests, challenging them to find Melina. The riddle asks the guests to recall the code used to open the storage bin in Sheri's death; there are several clues to this combination in the lounge. After figuring out the code, Kam notices a locked door behind partially opened curtains in the foyer and uses the code to solve the riddle. The wall revolves, opening up a room full of artifacts from all of the previous murders. At the far end of the room, they find Melina strangled to death with the rigged kukui necklace from Geno's murder (the original \"Plan A\"). Kam receives a puzzle piece, giving him an advantage in the final challenge.\n\n'''Killed''': Melina\n\n'''Final challenge''': The killer presents the final three guests with a multi-part riddle challenge, in which they have to solve riddles related to the previous murders with the help of the \"reanimated bodies\" of the previous guests. Depending on their answer, guests receive one of two [[jigsaw puzzle|jigsaw puzzle pieces]] to fit into each of their own large question mark-shaped boards in the foyer. Puzzle pieces received from riddles answered correctly would light up under a [[black light]], while riddles answered incorrectly would result in puzzle pieces that would remain dark under the black light. Guests then return to the incorrectly answered riddles and try again. Briefly, the riddles are:\n* '''Skill''': Sheri's riddle requires guests to use a slingshot to strike one of two aquariums, one containing a picture of Sheri facing forward and the other, backward. Picking the aquarium with the picture showing which direction Sheri faced when the killer struck her resulted in a correct puzzle piece. While all three guests identified the correct fish tank, each of them required multiple attempts to break it.\n* '''Memory''': Dontae's riddle simply asks guests to pick the correct saint on the necklace he received the night of his death, [[Agatha of Sicily|St. Agatha]] or St. Elmo.  Kam's advantage in this final challenge was that he could skip this riddle.\n* '''Tactile''': Adrianna's riddle instructs guests to rebuild the bomb that was used as a prop in the riddle challenge for her murder, and then to cut the wire whose color corresponded to the color of the letters of the message that she received in the breakfast nook.\n* '''Logic''': Don's riddle prompts guests to put in order the steps to get Kona, the cougar, into its hiding place. Kam is noted to have missed this several times.\n* '''Excavation''': Ulysses' riddle asks guests to find the [[Lampropeltis elapsoides|scarlet kingsnake]] in the nearby bush and to drop it in the wooden basket.\n* '''Perception''': Sasha and Dana's riddle in the theater shows guests two images with several minor differences; guests have to correctly identify how many differences there are to receive the correct puzzle piece. Both Lindsey and Cris missed this on their first try.\n* '''Sensory Deprivation''': Geno's riddle has guests enter a pitch black room with a chest, which contains four items - night vision goggles, a gun, a kukui necklace, and a lei. Bringing the item that was not a part of Geno's murder nets a correct puzzle piece. Cris is seen to have initially incorrectly picked a gun.\n* '''Evidence''': Ronnie's riddle tells guests to find a castor bean among the many different beans in a hot tub.\n* '''Instinct''': Guests run to the attic to \"find the killer\" - and find Giles, untangled from his ropes. He claims the killer put him up to this, and asks guests to find his contract downstairs, read the fine print, and tell him whether or not he is the killer. Kam got this wrong at first.\n\nKam is the first to finish the challenge, and Cris finishes shortly thereafter; both receive a riddle that directs them to a room upstairs to find the killer. Lindsey, the last to finish, is instead directed to the room where they earlier had found Melina.\n\n'''The Killer Unmasked''': Upstairs, Kam and Cris find themselves in a room filled with photographs of the murders along with video monitors showing live surveillance footage around Rue Manor. They begin to search frantically for what they believe is the final riddle that will reveal who the killer is, when all of a sudden, the monitor switches to a camera showing Lindsey entering the room from the foyer. Lindsey steps in and is distracted by the revolving door spinning behind her, not noticing the suit of armor poised to fire in front of her. Having set the trap off, Lindsey receives an arrow to her throat as her \"prize\" for being runner-up.\n\n'''Killed''': Lindsey\n\nStunned, Kam suddenly realizes that Cris is the killer, who menacingly gives one final rhyme: \"I won't be played by your foolish game. The killer could be you...or me just the same. Enough of the riddles, the ruckus, the rhymes. I committed those murders, eleven straight times. It is true, I am the real sinner. Congratulations, Kam, you are the winner.\"\n\n'''The Killer''': Cris\n\nGiles enters the room and gives Kam golden handcuffs to arrest Cris, who willingly is taken away by the police (incidentally played by the two executive producers, Zuiker and Abrego), her sadistic game over.  Giles awards Kam his prize and walks him out. On his way out of the mansion, Kam is greeted by the previously eliminated guests, who have been allowed to [[breaking character|break character]] as they see him off, most congratulating him on his victory. Giles offers to drive him wherever he wishes to go, to which Kam answers \"Home\".\n\n'''Winner''': Kam\n\nIn a post-show interview, it was revealed that the guests did not actually perform the final challenge simultaneously, as it would've been unfair if one guest was forced to wait while another guest was completing a station. Instead, each guest was timed individually, and in the end, Kam finished 44 seconds faster than Lindsey.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnET6oEFveU |title=AfterBuzz TV AfterShow  |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=August 30, 2013}}</ref>\n| LineColor       = 00A2CF\n}}\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\n''Whodunnit?'' received generally mixed reviews from critics.\n\nThe series received 43 out of 100 at [[Metacritic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/whodunnit|title=Whodunnit?: Season 1|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=June 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\n''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s Brian Lowry thought that the show was \"especially brain-numbing\", as the mysteries weren't suspenseful or intriguing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/reviews/whodunnit-1200496640/|title=Review: \"Whodunnit?\"|last=Lowry|first=Brian|work=Variety|publisher=Variety Media, LLC|date=June 17, 2013|accessdate=June 26, 2013}}</ref> Mary McNamara of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said that it was \"not terribly exciting\" and that the premiere episode \"didn't leave enough time for at-home deduction or competitive theories.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-whodunnit-review,0,1117011.story | title=Review: 'Whodunnit?' reality TV 'murder' mystery off to slow start | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=June 21, 2013 | accessdate=2013-06-22}}</ref> Allison Keene of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' thought that the series generally ended up \"either painful or unintentionally funny\".

In this episode, David ([[Joshua Dallas|Josh Dallas]]) finds his love for Mary Margaret ([[Ginnifer Goodwin]]) growing stronger and finally agrees to end his loveless marriage with Kathryn ([[Anastasia Griffith]]) by telling her about his secret relationship, and [[Emma Swan]] ([[Jennifer Morrison]]) becomes more intrigued with The Stranger ([[Eion Bailey]]), while Prince James (Dallas) is asked by Abigail (Griffith) to recover something precious that was lost to her.\n\nIt was written by [[David H. Goodman]] and was directed by [[Dean White (director)|Dean White]].\n\n==Plot==\n===Opening sequence===\nA golden, lifeless statue of a man under a gazebo is shown in the forest.\n\n===In the characters' past===\nIn the Enchanted Forest, King George's ([[Alan Dale]]) men hunt for Prince James ([[Joshua Dallas|Josh Dallas]]) who has fled his wedding to Princess Abigail ([[Anastasia Griffith]]). James narrowly escapes, with Abigail's help. When he asks why she would do this, Abigail tells James she does not want this arranged marriage any more than he does. She takes him to a monument containing a life-sized, golden statue of Frederick, the man she loves. During an ambush, he had tried to protect her father, [[King Midas]], but had accidentally touched him and been transformed to gold by Midas' curse. Abigail explains that there is a lake with waters reported to have enough magic to restore Frederick, but no man has come back from that lake alive. James agrees to risk it because if he succeeds, Abigail's suffering will end, but if he fails, his own suffering will end.\n\nAbigail takes James to the lake and shows him a shrine where others have left offerings to appease the creature within. She offers to accompany him, but James tells her he will go on alone since he does not want any life in his hands but his own. He commands the beast to show itself and is answered by a beautiful [[Siren (mythology)|siren]] (or, more probably, a [[rusalka]]). Even though James knows the deceptive nature of the siren, she transforms into the image of Snow White ([[Ginnifer Goodwin]]) and attempts to seduce him. It takes all his will to refuse the temptress so she tries to drown him by force. James manages to cut himself free and pick up a dagger to kill the Siren. He returns to Abigail victorious and the water restores Frederick ([[Greyston Holt]]) to life. The reunited lovers are overjoyed and grateful. James is inspired to carry on his quest to find his love, Snow White. He meets Red Riding Hood ([[Meghan Ory]]), who informs him that Snow White left to look for him and tell him she loves him. James realizes King George forced Snow White to tell him she doesn't love him. With the King's men closing in on James, he pulls Red Riding Hood up on his horse and the two escape.\n\n===In Storybrooke===\nIn the present day, Kathryn (Griffith) tells David (Dallas) she has been accepted at a law school in Boston. She figures they could use a fresh start, but David only replies that he needs to take a walk, leaving out the fact that he is taking this walk with Mary Margaret (Goodwin). He tells Mary Margaret that he chooses her over his wife and is not going to leave Storybrooke. Mary Margaret insists he must tell Kathryn the truth and let her go to Boston alone. David attempts to do this but instead makes up an excuse about not reconnecting as he breaks up with Kathryn. She is devastated, but remains unaware that there is another woman involved.\n\nLater on, Kathryn stops by Regina's ([[Lana Parrilla]]) home, where she tells the Mayor about David leaving her. Regina shows photographic evidence to Kathryn about David and Mary Margaret's affair. Meanwhile, David lies to Mary Margaret he told Kathryn about them. Soon after, Kathryn visits and slaps Mary Margaret in the middle of the school hallway and tells the confused teacher that David lied to them both. Later, Mary Margaret notices people are avoiding her and whispering behind her back, including Granny ([[Beverly Elliot]]) who tells her she should be ashamed of herself, revealing that the news of her affair had spread around the town. She asks David why he never told Kathryn the truth, to which he replies that he didn't want anyone to get hurt. She tells him that they do not have love but something destructive that must stop, so she breaks up with him.\n\nThe Stranger ([[Eion Bailey]]) tells [[Emma Swan]] ([[Jennifer Morrison]]) his name is August Wayne Booth. He tells her to meet him outside of Granny's after work. In the meantime, August is [[Conservation and restoration of books, manuscripts, documents and ephemera|restoring]] Henry's book, handling the pages in a darkroom, applying a chemical, hanging them up to dry, then assembling the book anew. At the end of the day, August and Emma meet and he takes her to an old well for a drink of water. August explains to a confused Emma that the well is supposed to have restorative qualities and will restore what was lost. Hours later, as Emma starts brushing leaves off her car, she finds the red metal box that holds Henry's ([[Jared S. Gilmore]]) book, while August secretly watches her.\n\nElsewhere, Kathryn goes to see Regina again, this time to apologize for what she said. Kathryn admits that she was never in love with David, and that she is moving to Boston alone. Kathryn adds that she wrote letters to both David and Mary Margaret telling them to be together, as they looked happy in the pictures. Insistent on preventing this act of forgiveness from becoming known, Regina steals the letter addressed to David and burns it. Later, Emma returns the book to Henry, who believes that its discovery is a sign that things will change for the better. Kathryn sets off in her car for Boston, however, as per Henry's warning about people trying to leave the town, her car winds up in a ditch.

In this episode, David ([[Joshua Dallas|Josh Dallas]]) finds his love for Mary Margaret ([[Ginnifer Goodwin]]) growing stronger and finally agrees to end his loveless marriage with Kathryn ([[Anastasia Griffith]]) by telling her about his secret relationship, and [[Emma Swan]] ([[Jennifer Morrison]]) becomes more intrigued with The Stranger ([[Eion Bailey]]), while Prince James (Dallas) is asked by Abigail (Griffith) to recover something precious that was lost to her.\n\nIt was written by [[David H. Goodman]] and was directed by [[Dean White (director)|Dean White]].\n\n==Plot==\n===Opening sequence===\nA golden, lifeless statue of a man under a gazebo is shown in the forest.\n\n===In the characters' past===\nIn the Enchanted Forest, King George's ([[Alan Dale]]) men hunt for Prince James ([[Joshua Dallas|Josh Dallas]]) who has fled his wedding to Princess Abigail ([[Anastasia Griffith]]). James narrowly escapes, with Abigail's help. When he asks why she would do this, Abigail tells James she does not want this arranged marriage any more than he does. She takes him to a monument containing a life-sized, golden statue of Frederick, the man she loves. During an ambush, he had tried to protect her father, [[King Midas]], but had accidentally touched him and been transformed to gold by Midas' curse. Abigail explains that there is a lake with waters reported to have enough magic to restore Frederick, but no man has come back from that lake alive. James agrees to risk it because if he succeeds, Abigail's suffering will end, but if he fails, his own suffering will end.\n\nAbigail takes James to the lake and shows him a shrine where others have left offerings to appease the creature within. She offers to accompany him, but James tells her he will go on alone since he does not want any life in his hands but his own. He commands the beast to show itself and is answered by a beautiful [[Siren (mythology)|siren]] (or, more probably, a [[rusalka]]). Even though James knows the deceptive nature of the siren, she transforms into the image of Snow White ([[Ginnifer Goodwin]]) and attempts to seduce him. It takes all his will to refuse the temptress so she tries to drown him by force. James manages to cut himself free and pick up a dagger to kill the Siren. He returns to Abigail victorious and the water restores Frederick ([[Greyston Holt]]) to life. The reunited lovers are overjoyed and grateful. James is inspired to carry on his quest to find his love, Snow White. He meets Red Riding Hood ([[Meghan Ory]]), who informs him that Snow White left to look for him and tell him she loves him. James realizes King George forced Snow White to tell him she doesn't love him. With the King's men closing in on James, he pulls Red Riding Hood up on his horse and the two escape.\n\n===In Storybrooke===\nIn the present day, Kathryn (Griffith) tells David (Dallas) she has been accepted at a law school in Boston. She figures they could use a fresh start, but David only replies that he needs to take a walk, leaving out the fact that he is taking this walk with Mary Margaret (Goodwin). He tells Mary Margaret that he chooses her over his wife and is not going to leave Storybrooke. Mary Margaret insists he must tell Kathryn the truth and let her go to Boston alone. David attempts to do this but instead makes up an excuse about not reconnecting as he breaks up with Kathryn. She is devastated, but remains unaware that there is another woman involved.\n\nLater on, Kathryn stops by Regina's ([[Lana Parrilla]]) home, where she tells the Mayor about David leaving her. Regina shows photographic evidence to Kathryn about David and Mary Margaret's affair. Meanwhile, David lies to Mary Margaret he told Kathryn about them. Soon after, Kathryn visits and slaps Mary Margaret in the middle of the school hallway and tells the confused teacher that David lied to them both. Later, Mary Margaret notices people are avoiding her and whispering behind her back, including Granny ([[Beverly Elliot]]) who tells her she should be ashamed of herself, revealing that the news of her affair had spread around the town. She asks David why he never told Kathryn the truth, to which he replies that he didn't want anyone to get hurt. She tells him that they do not have love but something destructive that must stop, so she breaks up with him.\n\nThe Stranger ([[Eion Bailey]]) tells [[Emma Swan]] ([[Jennifer Morrison]]) his name is August Wayne Booth. He tells her to meet him outside of Granny's after work. In the meantime, August is [[Conservation and restoration of books, manuscripts, documents and ephemera|restoring]] Henry's book, handling the pages in a darkroom, applying a chemical, hanging them up to dry, then assembling the book anew. At the end of the day, August and Emma meet and he takes her to an old well for a drink of water. August explains to a confused Emma that the well is supposed to have restorative qualities and will restore what was lost. Hours later, as Emma starts brushing leaves off her car, she finds the red metal box that holds Henry's ([[Jared S. Gilmore]]) book, while August secretly watches her.\n\nElsewhere, Kathryn goes to see Regina again, this time to apologize for what she said. Kathryn admits that she was never in love with David, and that she is moving to Boston alone. Kathryn adds that she wrote letters to both David and Mary Margaret telling them to be together, as they looked happy in the pictures. Insistent on preventing this act of forgiveness from becoming known, Regina steals the letter addressed to David and burns it. Later, Emma returns the book to Henry, who believes that its discovery is a sign that things will change for the better. Kathryn sets off in her car for Boston, however, as per Henry's warning about people trying to leave the town, her car winds up in a ditch. It is discovered by the school gym teacher (who was Frederick (Holt) in the Enchanted Forest), however, Kathryn is not in the crashed car; she is missing.\n\n==Production==\n\"What Happened to Frederick\" was written by co-executive producer [[David H.

Disney wanted to produce a television program to finance the development of the Disneyland amusement park. After being turned down by both [[CBS]] and [[NBC]], Disney eventually signed a deal with ABC (which had merged with [[United Paramount Theaters]] in 1953) on March 29, 1954. The show contained teasers for Walt's park, as well as episodes representing life in one of the park's main sections: [[Adventureland (Disney)|Adventureland]], [[Tomorrowland]], [[Fantasyland]], and [[Frontierland]], with the opening titles used from its inception until the show's move to NBC in 1961, showing the entrance to Disneyland itself, as well as the four aforementioned lands, one of which was then identified as the main feature of that evening's program.\n\nConsequently, \"Davy Crockett\" and other pioneers of the Old West, and American history in general, appeared in \"Frontier Land\". Similarly, ''20,000 Leagues Under the Sea'' might be the focus of an evening spent in \"Adventure Land\", although a documentary on the film could also be possibly presented as a topic for such episodes, including clips from the actual film. Topics for \"Fantasy Land\" would include either actual cartoons, and animated films, or documentaries on \"The Making of ...\" (such as behind-the-scenes presentation of [[Peggy Lee]] singing the duet of the wicked Siamese cats in ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'', or the barbershop quartet of lost dogs in the municipal Dog Pound); excerpts from a ''[[True-Life Adventures|True-Life Adventure]]'' documentary may also be included (for example, one on the life and works of [[beaver]]s and their dam-building) or those using [[Stroboscopic effect|stroboscopic]] stop-action photography (such as investigating what really happened when a rain-drop fell in a puddle, as part of a \"Fantasy Land\" episode), explaining the techniques of cartoon animation. The multiplane camera used to create the three-dimensional effects of ''[[Bambi]]'' was also as a topic for a \"Fantasy Land\"-set telecast. In one episode, four different artists were given the task of drawing the same tree, with each artist using his own preferred ways of drawing and imagining a tree;{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} this led to cartoon examples of differently animated trees, as in some of the early ''[[Silly Symphonies]]'' shorts, and later full-length animated films. \"Tomorrow Land\" was an opportunity for the Disney studio staff to present cutting-edge science and technology, and to predict possible futures, such as futuristic automobiles and highways. This format remained basically unchanged through the 1980s, though new material was scarce in later years. Other episodes were segments from Disney films such as ''[[Seal Island (film)|Seal Island]]'' and ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', or cartoons of [[Donald Duck]] and other Disney standbys.\n\nThe program spawned the [[Davy Crockett]] craze of 1955 with the airing of a three-episode series (not shown over the course of consecutive weeks) about the historical American frontiersman, starring [[Fess Parker]] in the title role. Millions of dollars of merchandise relating to the title character were sold, and the theme song, \"[[The Ballad of Davy Crockett]]\", became a hit record that year. Three historically based hour-long programs aired during late 1954/early 1955, and were followed up by two dramatized installments the following year. The TV episodes were later edited into two theatrical films.\n\nOn July 17, 1955, the opening of Disneyland was covered on a live television special, ''Dateline: Disneyland'',<ref name=\"epguides.com\"/> which is not technically considered to be part of the series. It was hosted by [[Art Linkletter]], with whom Walt Disney had worked out a deal prior to the opening to allow Linkletter to lease a shop on Main Street in return for the broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiecEZdR0aI|title=Extinct Attractions: Disney Legend Art Linkletter with David Oneal part 1|first=|last=David Oneal|date=February 11, 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> Art Linkletter was assisted by [[Bob Cummings]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], and the program featured various other guests, including various appearances of Walt himself as he dedicated the various lands of Disneyland.<ref name=\"Cotter\">{{cite book|title=The Wonderful World of Disney Television|author=Bill Cotter|publisher=[[Hachette Books|Hyperion Books]]|year=1997|location=New York|page = 17|isbn=0-7868-6359-5}}</ref>\n\n===''Walt Disney Presents'' (1958\u20131961)===\nIn 1958, the series was retitled ''Walt Disney Presents''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=Tim |last2=Marsh |first2=Earle |title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present |date=2007 |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York|isbn=9780345497734|page=1482 |edition=9th |url=https://books.google.com/?id=w8KztFy6QYwC&pg=PA1482&dq=%22walt+disney+presents%22+brooks+marsh#v=onepage&q=%22walt%20disney%20presents%22%20brooks%20marsh&f=false |accessdate=2017-11-12}}</ref> and moved to a Friday-night timeslot; by 1960, ABC had switched it to Sunday nights, where it remained for 21 years. During this iteration, ''The Peter Tchaikovsky Story,'' an episode made to promote Walt's latest animated feature, ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'', was one of the first stereo [[simulcast]]s on TV; in this case it was 3 channel stereo. FM radio stations across the country carried the left channel at the same time as ABC broadcast the TV show in mono, which served as a center channel, and AM radio stations broadcast the right channel. In the second half of the show, a lengthy clip of ''Sleeping Beauty'' was shown, with its 6 channels (70mm version) mixed down into 3 for the broadcast. Walt apparently wanted people to see ''Sleeping Beauty'' in 70&nbsp;mm, so, in the introduction, he explained the difference between 35&nbsp;mm and 70&nbsp;mm and held up a card with both sizes on it.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Peter Tchaikovsky Story (Television)|url=https://d23.com/a-to-z/peter-tchaikovsky-story-the-television/|website=[[D23 (Disney)|D23]]|publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]]|accessdate=December 22, 2016}}</ref> In addition to episodes devoted to the latest additions at Disneyland, many episodes during this period were Westerns such as \"[[Texas John Slaughter (TV series)|Texas John Slaughter]]\" and \"[[Elfego Baca#Walt Disney television series|Elfego Baca]]\", while others talked about the [[NASA|United States' burgeoning efforts to explore outer space]] and others, such as \"[[Moochie of the Little League]]\", were set in the then-present day. Some episodes even mixed live-action and animation, showing Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, and Jiminy Cricket talking with Walt himself, while one 1959 episode turned the spotlight on Chip 'n' Dale, combining their theatrical cartoons with mixed media wrap-around footage.\n\n===''Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color'' (1961\u20131969)===\nAlthough the basic format remained the same, the series moved to [[NBC]] on September 24, 1961, to take advantage of that network's ability to broadcast programming in [[color television|color]].<ref name=\"epguides.com\"/> In addition, Walt Disney's relationship with ABC had soured as the network resisted selling its stake in the theme park before doing so in 1960.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chronology of Disneyland Theme Park (1960\u20131965)|url=http://kpolsson.com/disland/dl1960.htm|website=Kpolsson.com|date=February 1, 1956|accessdate=October 15, 2013}}</ref> In a display of foresight, Disney had filmed many of the earlier shows in color, allowing them to easily be repeated on NBC; since all but three of Disney's feature-length films were also made in color (the three [[black-and-white]] exceptions were ''[[The Shaggy Dog (1959 film)|The Shaggy Dog]]'', ''[[The Absent-Minded Professor]]'', and ''[[Son of Flubber]]'', all family comedies starring [[Fred MacMurray]]), they could now also be telecast in that format.\n\nTo emphasize the new feature, the series was retitled ''Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color'' when NBC began airing it,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Story of Color Television|url=http://161.58.97.168/200111/11114c01.html|website=161.58.9.168|accessdate=October 15, 2013}}</ref> retaining that moniker until 1969, by which time the [[Big Three television networks|big three networks]] were all broadcasting in color. The first NBC episode even dealt with the principles of color, as explained by a new character named [[Ludwig Von Drake]] (voiced by [[Paul Frees]]), a bumbling professor with a thick German accent, who was the uncle of [[Donald Duck]]. Von Drake was the first Disney character created specifically for television.\n\n[[Image:Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color'' title sequence]]\nWalt Disney died on December 15, 1966, 12 years after the anthology series premiered.

After that, the studio decided that Walt's persona as host was such a key part of the show's appeal to viewers that the host segment was dropped.\n\n===''The Wonderful World of Disney'' (1969\u20131979)===\nThe series was retitled ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' in September 1969, as the previous title was no longer needed due to the aforementioned developments in color broadcasting. It continued to gain solid ratings, often ranking in the top 20, until the mid-1970s.\n\nIn 1976, Disney showed its hit 1961 film ''[[The Parent Trap (1961 film)|The Parent Trap]]'' on television for the first time, as a 2\u00bd-hour special. This marked a major step in broadcasting for the studio, which had never shown one of its more popular films on television in a time slot longer than an hour (although it had shown ''[[Now You See Him, Now You Don't]]'' and ''[[Napoleon and Samantha]]'' in a two-hour format in 1975).<ref name=\"billcotter.com\">{{cite web|title=Appendix B \u2013 The Anthology Series|url=http://www.billcotter.com/tvbook/appendix-b.htm|website=BillCotter.com|accessdate=October 15, 2013}}</ref> Walt Disney Productions also began running some of its multiepisode television programs, such as 1962's ''Sammy The Way-Out Seal'', as televised feature films on the anthology series. A slightly edited version of the 1954 Disney film ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' made its television debut as a two-hour special on NBC in October 1976.<ref name=\"billcotter.com\"/> Several other Disney films, some of them not especially successful (such as ''[[Superdad]]'', which was an outright flop in its initial theatrical release) were also aired on the program in the form of two-hour broadcasts that year. However, the multiepisode format for feature films had not been discontinued; as late as 1981, films such as ''[[Pollyanna (1960 film)|Pollyanna]]'' were still being shown on the Disney program in several installments running a week apart.<ref name=\"billcotter.com\"/>\n\nDuring the early 1970s, the show began to increasingly concentrate less on animated cartoons and dramatic or comedy films, and began to place an emphasis on nature-oriented programs (such as the ''[[True-Life Adventures]]'').<ref name=\"billcotter.com\"/>\n\nThe show's continued ratings success in the post-Walt era came to an end during the 1975\u201376 season. At this time, Walt Disney Productions was facing a decline in fortunes due to falling box-office revenues, while NBC as a whole was also slipping in the ratings. The anthology series became even more dependent on airings of live-action theatrical features, its ''True-Life Adventures'', reruns of older episodes, and cartoon compilations. Nothing from the [[Disney animated features canon]] aired, with the exceptions of ''Alice in Wonderland'' and ''[[Dumbo]]'', as part of a long-standing policy placed on the program by Disney. Additionally, in 1975, when CBS regained the broadcast rights to the 1939 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', it was scheduled opposite ''Disney'', as it had been between 1960 and 1968. At that time, telecasts of that film were highly rated annual events, which largely attracted the same family audience as the Disney series. From 1968 to 1975, when NBC held the television rights to ''Oz'' (which it had acquired from CBS in 1967), it usually pre-empted ''Disney'' to show it. However, the show's stiffest weekly competition came from CBS's newsmagazine ''[[60 Minutes (American television series)|60 Minutes]]''.\n\nIn 1975, an amendment to the [[Prime Time Access Rule]] gave the Sunday 7:00&nbsp;pm [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] slot back to the networks, allowing NBC to move ''Disney'' back by a half-hour. It also allowed CBS to schedule ''60 Minutes'' at 7:00&nbsp;pm Eastern Time starting on December 7; prior to this, ''60 Minutes'' had aired at 6:00&nbsp;pm Eastern and did not begin its seasons until after the [[National Football League]] season ended. ''Disney'' fell out of the top 30, while ''60 Minutes'' had its ratings rise significantly.\n\n===''Disney's Wonderful World'' (1979\u20131981)===\nIn September 1979, the studio agreed to then-NBC president [[Fred Silverman]]'s request for changes to the program. The show shortened its title to ''Disney's Wonderful World'', and updated the opening sequence with a computer-generated logo and [[disco]]-styled theme song, but largely kept the same format. The problems for the show continued. As a result of the ratings strength of ''60 Minutes'', compounded by low ratings, increasingly less original material, and frequent pre-emptions (primarily due to sporting events such as [[NFL on NBC|NFL game telecasts]]),<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cotter|first1=Bill|title=Appendix B: The Anthology Series Schedules|url=http://www.billcotter.com/tvbook/appendix-b.pdf|website=billcotter.com|accessdate=22 December 2016}}</ref> NBC cancelled ''Disney'' in 1981.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Vernon|title=Scott's World: Networks Load Guns|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/05/08/Scotts-World-Networks-Load-Guns/3235358142400/|newspaper=[[United Press International]]|publisher=[[News World Communications]]|accessdate=22 December 2016|date=8 May 1981}}</ref> One factor that was beyond the control of either Disney or NBC was a 94-day strike by the [[Screen Actors' Guild]] that cut the number of shows for the 1980\u20131981 season,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Townsend|first1=Ed|title=Actors strike could delay fall TV season|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1980/0724/072454.html|website=csmonitor.com|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=22 December 2016|date=24 July 1980}}</ref> but the damage was done nonetheless.\n\n===''Walt Disney'' (1981\u20131983)===\nFollowing NBC's announcement that it would drop the anthology series, CBS picked up the program and began airing it on Saturdays at 8:00 pm Eastern Time, in September 1981. Despite a more elaborate credit sequence and another title change, to simply ''Walt Disney'', the series' format remained unchanged. During the 1981\u20131982 season, the series had a full season's worth of material again, but little of it was new. Among the little that actually was new were a handful of pilots based on ''[[Pollyanna (1960 film)|Pollyanna]]'', ''[[Escape to Witch Mountain]]'', and ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang]]'', but only the last of the three pilots was sold and became the half-hour sitcom ''[[Gun Shy (TV series)|Gun Shy]]'' the following season, one of the studio's first entries in that genre.\n\nThe 1982\u20131983 season had enough material to fill the time slot, but almost all of it was pre-existing material, the lone exception being the celebrity-laden opening ceremony of [[Epcot]] on October 23. It also did not help matters that NBC slotted the family-friendly sitcoms ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'' and ''[[Silver Spoons]]'' at 8:00 pm and 8:30 pm up against it to draw children away from CBS. After moving to Tuesday at the beginning of 1983, it went on hiatus on February 15 while the aforementioned ''Gun Shy'' took up the second half of its time slot. When it came back for summer reruns on May 3, it was still on Tuesday at 8:00 pm; its final network broadcast was on September 24, bringing an uninterrupted 29-year run on all three networks to a close.\n\nThe end of the show coincided with the launch of the studio's [[cable television]] network, the [[Disney Channel]]. While ratings were a factor, the final decision to end the show came from Walt Disney Productions' then-CEO [[Card Walker]], who felt that having both the show and the new channel active would result in cannibalization of viewership.<ref name=\"DisneyWar\">{{cite book|title=Disneywar|author=[[James B.

Although he was not a performer, after filming a test video with his wife Jane and a member of his executive team (which required multiple takes), studio management believed he could do the hosting job. Eisner hired Michael Kay, a director of political commercials for then-[[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] [[Bill Bradley]], to help him improve his on-camera performance.<ref name=\"The Keys to the Kingdom\"/>\n\n''The Disney Sunday Movie'' initially aired as ABC's lead-off program on Sundays, running from 7:00 to 9:00&nbsp;pm Eastern Time.<ref name=lat/> By this point, the format was similar to a movie-of-the-week. Gary Barton, a Disney senior vice president, was in charge of the program. ''Help Wanted: Kids'' was the first episode's film. Other first revival year films were, ''Young Again'', ''The Richest Cat in the World'', ''I-Man'' (starring Scott Bakula),<ref>{{cite book|title=The Best TV Shows That Never Were|last=Goldberg|first=Lee|year=2015}}</ref> and ''My Town''. Sometimes the slot would feature special instead of dramatic material like \"Disney Goes to the Oscars\" featuring the studio's Academy Award winners, and \"The Greatest Moments in Disney Animation\".<ref name=lat/> A handful of [[List of Disney Channel original films|Disney Channel original films]] made their network television debuts during these iteration as well,<ref name=bcm>{{cite journal|title=Stoddard  charts  ABC's long  road  ahead|journal=Broadcasting Magazine|date=June 30, 1986|pages=38\u201339|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1986/BC-1986-06-30.pdf}}</ref> but the program did not present any film made by Disney's [[Touchstone Pictures|Touchstone subsidiary]] as such films were not considered appropriate for children. However, ''[[Splash, Too]]'', a sequel to [[Splash (film)|the 1984 film]], aired on the series over two weeks in May 1988. The series had increased Disney park attendance and ABC's Sunday night ratings for the evening by an average 27% for the rest of the season. Disney, wanting to make it a regular viewing habit, gave ABC additional films from its library, including  ''[[Old Yeller]]'', ''The Apple Dumpling Gang'', and ''[[Candleshoe]]'' for the normal rerun mid-year period. ''The Last Electric Knight'' series movie produced a spin-off, originally to be called ''[[Sidekicks (TV series)|Karate Kid]]'' for ABC's 1987 season.<ref name=bcm/>\n\nDespite improving ABC's numbers, the program's ratings were never strong as the established ''60 Minutes'' and scripted mystery series ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' on [[CBS]], both of which Disney was competing with for viewers, remained the leading primetime programs on Sunday nights. In 1987, ABC reduced ''The Disney Sunday Movie'' from two hours to one. The move did not help drive ratings, and the network decided not to renew its contract with Disney or pick up a fourth season of the second iteration of the anthology series.\n\n''The Disney Sunday Movie'' was also being run on the [[Disney Channel]], also hosted by Eisner.<ref name=\"drn\" />\n\n===''The Magical World of Disney'' (1988\u20131990)===\nIn the spring of 1988, NBC decided to renew its association with the company after it cut ties to the anthology series seven years earlier; the network brought the series, now named ''The Magical World of Disney'', to serve as the lead-in of its Sunday lineup in September 1988. As the program had done during its last season as ''The Disney Sunday Movie'', ''The Magical World of Disney'' ran for one hour, airing at 7:00&nbsp;pm Eastern Time; Michael Eisner also returned as its presenter. \nDuring this period, the show attempted to reintroduce the rotating format the show started out with in 1954.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Ron|title=Nbc Moves Ahead With `Back To Basics` Lineup|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-03-22/features/8803020752_1_disney-hour-nbc-entertainment-brandon-tartikoff|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|accessdate=22 December 2016|date=22 March 1988}}</ref> It also introduced new versions of Walt-era movies and TV shows such as ''[[The Absent-Minded Professor#Remakes|The Absent-Minded Professor]]'', a reboot of ''[[Davy Crockett (miniseries)|Davy Crockett]]'', and the musical ''[[Polly (1989 film)|Polly]]'', which was based on the book ''[[Pollyanna]]'' by [[Eleanor H. Porter]] and the [[Pollyanna (1960 film)|Walt Disney's 1960 film adaptation of it]]. \nIn the 1989\u20131990 season, during which the company was negotiating with [[Jim Henson]] to buy [[The Muppets]], they aired two Muppet specials; one of them was ''[[The Muppets at Walt Disney World]]'', which turned out to be Henson's last Muppet special. He died May 16, 1990, 10 days after the special aired, and the company only acquired The Muppets more than a decade later.\n\nAfter two seasons experiencing the same lackluster ratings as it had accrued during the end of its initial NBC run and its subsequent runs on CBS and ABC, Disney elected to end the broadcast television run of ''The Magical World of Disney'' and began airing the anthology on the Disney Channel \u2013 in the same time slot it had been airing for the past decade \u2013 starting in September 1990, expanding back to a two-hour format. Since the Disney Channel operated as a [[pay television|premium channel]] at the time, films presented on the series were presented without commercial interruption. ''The Magical World of Disney'' originally aired on the cable channel as a weekly Sunday-only program for its first 5\u00bd years; but in September 1996, as part of the first phase of a programming revamp that culminated in its formal conversion into a commercial-free basic cable channel in April 1997, the Disney Channel expanded the ''Magical World'' brand to encompass its Monday through Saturday primetime film block, maintaining its 7:00&nbsp;pm Eastern time slot.\n\n===''The Wonderful World of Disney'' (1991\u2013present)===\n''The Wonderful World of Disney'' returned in 1991 as an umbrella title for Disney specials airing on major networks (CBS airings used the historical title ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' for the first few years, while other networks broadcast the show with another title, ''A Disney Special'').\n \t\nIn 1997, with Disney acquiring ABC the previous year, ABC gave the series a regular slot in the schedule.<ref name=\"drn\" /> Disney CEO Eisner formed [[Disney Telefilms]] by 1995 to supply original films to the series<ref name=bc>{{cite news|last1=Romano|first1=Allison|title=Game Boy |url= http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/game-boy/102439 |accessdate=December 30, 2015|work=Broadcasting & Cable |publisher= NewBay Media, LLC |date=March 14, 2004}}</ref><ref name=vty>{{cite news|last1=Littleton|first1=Cynthia|title=Disney Telefilms ups exex|url=https://variety.com/1998/biz/news/disney-telefilms-ups-exex-1117468572/|accessdate=December 30, 2015|work=Variety|date=March 9, 1998}}</ref> and program together with ABC.<ref name=\"drn\" /> It led the network's Sunday night lineup at the 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern time slot,<ref name=vty0>{{cite news|title=Disney Sets ABC Pix|url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/disney-sets-abc-pix-1117342089/|accessdate=December 30, 2015|work=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=May 1, 1997}}</ref> resulting in the displacement of Sunday mainstay ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'', which had occupied the slot since 1992.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} On September 28, 1997, the all-new ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' premiered with the network television premiere of ''[[Toy Story]]''. On October 5, 1997, Disney Telefilms' first production, ''[[Toothless (film)|Toothless]]'', debuted on the series. In addition to the planned 16 original Disney telemovies, ABC and Disney added a few direct-to-video movies and films from other sources.<ref name=\"drn\" />\n\nIn 2001, a Spanish-language version of the program premiered on [[Telemundo]] (which, incidentally, was acquired by the English version's former home, [[NBC]], that same year 2001-2010) as ''El Maravilloso Mundo de Disney'', with more of a focus on Disney theatrical films than the English broadcasts at the time for Spanish version's former [[Disney Channel (Latin America)]].\n\nIn September 2003, ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' moved to Saturdays at 8:00 pm Eastern, with the previous Sunday time slot being ceded to ''AFV'' (which moved back to Sundays that season) and drama series in the 8:00&nbsp;pm hour. Rare exceptions to the program's format occurred during this time; for example, a ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV miniseries)|Little House on the Prairie]]'' miniseries ran for several weeks in 2004 under the ''Wonderful World of Disney'' banner. For most of its second run on ABC, the program aired throughout the television season, with the exception of the 2005\u201306 season (when it aired during the midseason only), and in 2007 and 2008 (when it was relegated to the summer months), with a broader array of films occupying the network's Saturday primetime slot at other times, when [[ESPN on ABC|sports programming]] did not air. The series ended as a regular program in 2008.\n\nAt this point, the series began to shift focus toward Disney theatrical films, relying less on original television films; however, the series aired two Disney Channel Original Movies (2002's ''[[Cadet Kelly]]'' and 2008's ''[[Camp Rock]]'', currently the only Disney Channel television films to have aired on non-Disney Channel-branded network domestically) during its ABC run. The second ABC revival also included some family-oriented films produced by studios other than Disney under the ''Wonderful World'' banner, such as ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' from [[20th Century Fox]] ([[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|which is presently owned by Disney]]) and the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' film series and ''[[Space Jam]]'' from [[Warner Bros.]], as well as television films such as ''[[Princess of Thieves]]'' from [[Granada Productions]] and the 2001 remake of ''[[Brian's Song (2001)|Brian's Song]]'' from [[Columbia TriStar Television]] (now known as [[Sony Pictures Television]]).\n\nIn December 2015, ABC's ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' officially returned to its anthology format with a showing of ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' for the first time on ABC since 2002, hosted by Dick Van Dyke. Van Dyke took viewers on a tour through the Disney Archives, as they explored props and costumes from the production of ''Mary Poppins'' and discussed the film\u2019s history and context within the Disney legacy.<ref>[http://www.insidethemagic.net/2015/12/dick-van-dyke-to-host-mary-poppins-on-the-wonderful-world-of-disney/ Dick Van Dyke to host \u201cMary Poppins\u201d on \u201cThe Wonderful World of Disney\u201d] Inside the Magic, Retrieved December 12, 2015</ref> It was then shown on February 21, 2016, with the special ''[[The Wonderful World of Disney: Disneyland 60|Disneyland 60]]'', which honored Disneyland's 60th anniversary;<ref>[http://wbay.com/2016/01/07/abc-special-celebrates-disneyland-turning-60/ ABC special celebrates Disneyland turning 60] [[WBAY]], Retrieved January 28, 2016</ref> on November 24, 2016, for their Magical Holiday Celebration, filmed at Walt Disney World;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.disneyabcpress.com/abc/shows/the-wonderful-world-of-disney-magical-holiday-celebration/|title=The Wonderful World of Disney: Magical Holiday Celebration {{!}} ABC Press|website=www.disneyabcpress.com|access-date=2016-12-12}}</ref> and on December 11, 2016, for the network television premiere of ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/disneys-frozen-film-makes-network-premiere-december-11|title=Disney\u2019s Frozen Film Makes Network Premiere December 11 {{!}} Playbill|newspaper=[[Playbill]]|publisher=TotalTheater|access-date=2016-12-12}}</ref> On August 5, 2019, it was announced that ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' would present ''[[The Little Mermaid Live!]]'' on November 5 of that year with [[Auli'i Cravalho]], [[Queen Latifah]] and [[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]] starring as Ariel, Ursula and Sebastian, respectively.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bentley|first=Jean|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/little-mermaid-live-starring-aulii-cravalho-set-at-abc-1229130|title=Little Mermaid' Live Starring Auli'i Cravalho Set at ABC|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=August 5, 2019|access-date=August 6, 2019}}</ref> The cast also included [[John Stamos]] as Chef Louis and [[Graham Phillips (actor)|Graham Phillips]] as Prince Eric.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Petski |first1=Denise |title=John Stamos & Graham Phillips Join \u2018The Little Mermaid Live!\u2019 On ABC |url=https://deadline.com/2019/09/john-stamos-reprise-chef-louis-role-the-little-mermaid-live-abc-graham-phillips-cast-1202744462/ |accessdate=September 26, 2019 |work=Deadline Hollywood |date=September 25, 2019 |language=en}}</ref> The special featured music from both the film and the Tony Award-nominated Broadway stage version and was performed in front of a live audience with giant projection surface.<ref>{{cite news |last1=White |first1=Peter |title=\u2018Little Mermaid\u2019 Live Musical: Auli\u2019i Cravalho, Shaggy & Hamish Hamilton Go Under The Sea To Describe ABC\u2019s \"Interesting Hybrid\" \u2013 TCA |url=https://deadline.com/2019/08/little-mermaid-interesting-hybrid-abc-1202662158/ |accessdate=August 6, 2019 |work=Deadline Hollywood |date=August 5, 2019 |language=en}}</ref> The title was used again on November 28, 2019, for a two hour music special, ''The Wonderful World of Disney: Magical Holiday Celebration'', hosted by [[Emma Bunton]] and [[Matthew Morrison]].<ref>[https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2019/11/the-wonderful-world-of-disney-magical-holiday-celebration-airs-thanksgiving-night-on-abc/ \u201c \u2018The Wonderful World of Disney: Magical Holiday Celebration\u2019 Airs Thanksgiving Night on ABC\u201d] from Disney Parks (November 11, 2019)</ref>\n\n==''Magical World of Toons''==\n\"''The Magical World of Toons''\" was the daily prime time programming block featuring character's key series episodes coinciding with the launch of its channel, [[Toon Disney]], on April 18, 1998.<ref name=awm>{{cite news|title=Toon Disney Launch.|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue3.2/3.2pages/3.2television.html|accessdate=26 February 2014|newspaper=Animation World Network|date=May 1998}}</ref> \"Magical World\" continued at least until 2003.<ref name=tfl>{{cite news|title=Disney's Pepper Ann Takes Her Quest for Coolness to Toon Disney Beginning September 2001;

The original opening titles were restored to the episodes in 1997. Reruns of the anthology series were discontinued when the channel purged all vintage material with the removal of its Vault Disney late-night block on September 8, 2002.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vhat Vood Vault Do?|url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_hill/archive/2002/09/06/261.aspx|author=Jim Hill|website=Jim Hill Media|date=September 6, 2002|accessdate=October 15, 2013}}</ref> However, a few select episodes are available on VHS or DVD (some of which are exclusive to the [[Disney Movie Club]]), with the possibility of additional future releases.\n\nRecently, live-action Disney films from the 1950s to the 1980s have aired on [[Turner Classic Movies]], without commercial interruption, and presented uncut and with [[letterbox]]ing on the network's [[Standard-definition television|standard-definition]] feed.\n\nAll of the episodes and existing material used on the series up to 1996 are listed in the Bill Cotter book ''The Wonderful World of Disney Television'', which was released in 1997 by [[Hachette Books#Hyperion Books|Hyperion Books]] (which was owned by the Walt Disney Company at the book's publication).<ref name=\"Cotter\"/>\n\n==Programming==\nOriginally hosted by Walt Disney himself, the original format of the Disney anthology series consisted of a balance of theatrical [[animated cartoon]]s, live-action features, and other informational material (some original, some pre-existing) from the studio's library. For many years, the show also featured edited one-hour versions of such then-recent Disney films as ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', and in other cases, telecasts of complete Disney films that were split into two or more one-hour episodes.<ref name=\"epguides.com\">{{cite web|title=Walt Disney Presents (a Titles & Air Dates Guide)|url=http://epguides.com/WaltDisneyPresents/|website=[[Epguides]]|date=August 5, 2012|accessdate=October 15, 2013}}</ref> Later original programs consisted of dramatizations of other historical figures and legends along the lines of the [[Davy Crockett]] mini-series. These included [[Daniel Boone (1960 TV series)|a miniseries based on Daniel Boone]] (not the Fess Parker characterization), [[Texas John Slaughter (TV series)|Texas John Slaughter]], [[Elfego Baca]], [[Francis Marion]] (the \"[[The Swamp Fox (TV series)|Swamp Fox]]\") and 1977's ''Kit Carson and the Mountain Man'' (with [[Christopher Connelly (actor)|Christopher Connelly]] as [[Kit Carson]], [[Robert Reed]] as [[John C. Fremont]], and [[Gregg Palmer]] as mountain man [[Jim Bridger]]).\n\nOccasionally, a more educational segment would be featured (such as ''[[The Story of the Animated Drawing]]''), including nature and animal programs similar to the ''True-Life Adventures'' that were released in theaters, as well as various dramatic installments which were either structured as single-part, two-part, and sometimes, multipart editions. Much of the original informational excerpts were to create awareness of Disneyland. In spite of essentially serving as advertisements for the park, entertainment value was emphasized, as well to make the shows palatable. Some of the program's informational content was formatted to promote upcoming feature film releases by the studio (such as ''20,000 Leagues Under the Sea'' and ''[[Darby O'Gill and the Little People]]''), with some programs focusing on the art and technology of animation itself.\n\n==Theme music==\n* From 1954 to 1961, the series used the song \"[[When You Wish Upon a Star]]\" as its theme. The recording was taken directly from the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''.\n* From 1961 to 1969, an original song was used, \"The Wonderful World of Color\", written by [[Richard M. Sherman]] and [[Robert B. Sherman]]. This song helped to emphasize the use of color with its lyrics.\n* From 1969 to 1979 (''The Wonderful World of Disney''), orchestral medleys of various Disney songs from movies and theme parks as theme songs.\n* From 1979 to 1980 (''Disney's Wonderful World''), a [[disco]]-styled theme was written to emphasize the new visual changes, even though the format remained the same. [[John Debney]] composed the melody and [[John Klawitter]] wrote the lyrics.\n** From 1980 to 1981, the series discarded the Debney/Klawitter theme and went back to an earlier orchestral medley theme, while keeping the 1979 credits motif and title.\n* From 1981 to 1983 (''Walt Disney''), a short disco arrangement of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\", arranged by [[Frank Gari]], served as theme against some elaborate, then-state-of-the-art computer graphics. [[CBC Television]] in Canada also used this title sequence and theme music for their own versions of the show. The sequence was also used as the opening sequence on international [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Walt Disney Home Video]] releases until 1987.\n* From 1986 to 1988, a synthesized, [[pop-rock]] arrangement of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" with some clapping was the theme. This was used again for the 1989\u201390 season of ''The Magical World of Disney'' and the 1991\u201396 run on The [[Disney Channel]].\n* In 1988, an orchestral medley of \"[[A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes]]\" and \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" was used. This was switched back to the 1987 theme in 1989.\n* From 1991 to 1997, an orchestral medley of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" and \"[[Part of Your World]]\" (the latter from Disney's then recent hit ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'') was used for network airings of the show (known as ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' on CBS and ''A Disney Special'' on other networks) as well as ''[[The 100 Lives of Black Jack Savage]]'', a collaboration with [[Stephen J. Cannell Productions]]. This theme was also used internationally.\n* From 1997 to 2002, an orchestral medley of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" and \"A Whole New World\" (the latter used in the movie ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'') were used; also used occasionally was the Louis Armstrong hit \"[[What a Wonderful World]]\". This theme is still used today internationally.\n* From 2002 to 2007, a newer orchestral arrangement of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" with a wordless choir was used for ABC airings in the United States.\n* From 2007 to 2008, another orchestral arrangement of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" (in actuality, the theme from the current [[Walt Disney Pictures]] logo, composed by [[Mark Mancina]]) and a brand-new opening title sequence (depicting a montage of the company's work) are used for ABC airings in the United States.\n* From 2012 on, \"Heaven\u2019s Triumph\", composed by Robert Etoll via Q-Factory, is used along with a brand-new opening title sequence (updated to include ''[[Star Wars]]'' and [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel]] properties).\n\n==International broadcasts==\n\n=== Argentina ===\n\n==== The Telefe era ====\n''El mundo de Disney'' (The World of Disney) aired for the first time on the [[Over the air television|OTA]] network [[Telefe]] in 1990, hosted by Leonardo Greco.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1771672-leonardo-greco-amo-este-pais-aunque-hay-que-arreglarle-algunas-cosas|title=Leonardo Greco: \"Amo este pa\u00eds, aunque hay que arreglarle algunas cosas\"|publisher=}}</ref> He remained as the sole presenter of the show, lasting until 1995, when the series concluded. The programme started airing at 8:00pm nightly from the second half of 1990 until December 1992. By 1993, it was moved to weekday afternoons at 5:00pm. When it was coming to an end, around 1994, shifted to Sunday afternoons, and aired a long marathon of movies and cartoons. According to Greco, this programme was possible because of a distributor who acquired the material, and was allowed to be shown without following a strict format, because the company wanted to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://delosnoventas.blogspot.com.ar/2009/10/entrevista-con-leonardo-greco-la-cara.html|title=Entrevista con Leonardo Greco, la cara de Disney en la Argentina de los 90|first=|last=Noventosos|date=October 9, 2009|publisher=}}</ref>\nTelefe wanted a comeback, and appointed chef and host Maru Botana (then network talent) to present ''Planeta Disney'' (Disney Planet) on Sunday evenings, at 8:00pm, beginning November 21, 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/654303-planeta-disney-en-la-orbita-de-telefe|title=\"Planeta Disney\" en la \u00f3rbita de Telef\u00e9|publisher=}}</ref> Starting on July 9, 2005,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2005/07/09/espectaculos/c-00203.htm|title=Vuelven Pluto y compa\u00f1\u00eda|publisher=}}</ref> Botana was replaced with two personalities employed by Disney, Carolina Ibarra and Dani Martins.

The only clear difference was that only movies starring human actors, like ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' or ''[[The Island at the Top of the World]]'', could be broadcast, and not the cartoons. This experiment lasted until early 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://logos.foroslatinos.tv/t1350-programacion-de-tv-domingo-3-de-diciembre-de-1995?highlight=1995|title=1995 \u2013 Programaci\u00f3n de TV \u2013 domingo 3 de diciembre de 1995|publisher=}}</ref>\nBy 2007, the network took off from Telefe the exclusive rights to show all the Disney franchise movies and programs, and began to air its movies on Sunday evenings at 7:00pm, without a host. This also allowed Canal 13 to detain rights for other shows not related with Disney, but with the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network, like ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' or ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', and to produce a localised version of the high-grossing film ''[[High School Musical: El Desaf\u00edo|High School Musical]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/espectaculos/8-6093-2007-04-20.html|title=P\u00e1gina/12 :: espectaculos|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Australia ===\nAfter more than 30 years of the Seven Network, in 2019, it now broadcast on the [[Nine Network]] and on [[9Go!]].\n\n=== Brazil ===\nThe ABC run of the program under ''The Magical World of Disney'' title originally aired in that country under the title ''Cine Disney'' on the Brazilian-portuguese version of [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televis\u00e3o]] (SBT) in partnership with [[The Walt Disney Company]].

The show was broadcast weekly on one of the [[Big Three television networks]] until 1990, a 36-year span with only a two-year hiatus in 1984-85. The series was broadcast on Sunday for 25 of those years. From 1991 until 1997, the series aired infrequently.\n\nThe program resumed a regular schedule in 1997 on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] fall schedule, coinciding with Disney's recent purchase of the network. From 1997 until 2008, the program aired regularly on ABC. Since then, ABC has continued the series as an occasional special presentation from 2008 onward, the most recent being a holiday music special in November 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rotoscopers.com/2015/12/02/dick-van-dyke-hosts-wonderful-world-of-disney-return-to-abc/|title=Wonderful World of Disney Returns to ABC - Rotoscopers|website=www.rotoscopers.com}}</ref>\n \nThe show has had only two hosts, [[Walt Disney]] and former Disney Chairman [[Michael Eisner]].<ref name=\"drn\">{{cite news |last=Pierce |first=Scott |date=September 28, 1997 |title=ABC revives weekly Disney series |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/585719/ABC-revives-weekly-Disney-series.html | work=Deseret News |location= |access-date=March 14, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe show is the [[List of longest-running U.S. primetime television series|second-longest-running primetime program]] on American television, behind its rival film anthology series, the ''[[Hallmark Hall of Fame]]'', which is still on the air as of 2019.\n\n==Titles==\n\n*''Walt Disney's Disneyland'' (1954\u20131958; [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]<ref name=\"eotv\">{{cite web|last1=Griffin|first1=Sean|title=Walt Disney Programs|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/waltdisneyp.htm|website=Encyclopedia of Television|publisher=[[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]|accessdate=March 17, 2017}}</ref>)\n*''Walt Disney Presents'' (1958\u20131961; ABC<ref name=\"eotv\"/>)\n*''Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color'' (1961\u20131969; [[NBC]]<ref name=\"eotv\"/>)\n*''The Wonderful World of Disney'' (first era; 1969\u20131979; NBC<ref name=\"eotv\"/>)\n*''Disney's Wonderful World'' (1979\u20131981; NBC<ref name=\"eotv\"/>)\n*''[[#Walt Disney (1981\u20131983)|Walt Disney]]'' (1981\u20131983; [[CBS]]<ref name=\"eotv\"/>)\n*''[[#The Disney Sunday Movie (1986\u20131988)|The Disney Sunday Movie]]'' (1986\u20131988; ABC;<ref name=\"drn\"/><ref name=\"eotv\"/>)\n*''[[#The Magical World of Disney (1988-1990)|The Magical World of Disney]]'' (1988\u20131990; NBC<ref name=\"eotv\"/>)\n*''[[#The Wonderful World of Disney|The Wonderful World of Disney]]'' (1991-1997; [[CBS]]) (third era; 1997\u20132008, 2014\u2013present; ABC<ref name=\"drn\"/>)\n\n==History==\nThe anthology series was an outgrowth of Walt Disney looking for funding for [[Disneyland]] with his brother [[Roy O.

Disney wanted to produce a television program to finance the development of the Disneyland amusement park. After being turned down by both [[CBS]] and [[NBC]], Disney eventually signed a deal with ABC (which had merged with [[United Paramount Theaters]] in 1953) on March 29, 1954. The show contained teasers for Walt's park, as well as episodes representing life in one of the park's main sections: [[Adventureland (Disney)|Adventureland]], [[Tomorrowland]], [[Fantasyland]], and [[Frontierland]], with the opening titles used from its inception until the show's move to NBC in 1961, showing the entrance to Disneyland itself, as well as the four aforementioned lands, one of which was then identified as the main feature of that evening's program.\n\nConsequently, \"Davy Crockett\" and other pioneers of the Old West, and American history in general, appeared in \"Frontier Land\". Similarly, ''20,000 Leagues Under the Sea'' might be the focus of an evening spent in \"Adventure Land\", although a documentary on the film could also be possibly presented as a topic for such episodes, including clips from the actual film. Topics for \"Fantasy Land\" would include either actual cartoons, and animated films, or documentaries on \"The Making of ...\" (such as behind-the-scenes presentation of [[Peggy Lee]] singing the duet of the wicked Siamese cats in ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'', or the barbershop quartet of lost dogs in the municipal Dog Pound); excerpts from a ''[[True-Life Adventures|True-Life Adventure]]'' documentary may also be included (for example, one on the life and works of [[beaver]]s and their dam-building) or those using [[Stroboscopic effect|stroboscopic]] stop-action photography (such as investigating what really happened when a rain-drop fell in a puddle, as part of a \"Fantasy Land\" episode), explaining the techniques of cartoon animation. The multiplane camera used to create the three-dimensional effects of ''[[Bambi]]'' was also as a topic for a \"Fantasy Land\"-set telecast. In one episode, four different artists were given the task of drawing the same tree, with each artist using his own preferred ways of drawing and imagining a tree;{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} this led to cartoon examples of differently animated trees, as in some of the early ''[[Silly Symphonies]]'' shorts, and later full-length animated films. \"Tomorrow Land\" was an opportunity for the Disney studio staff to present cutting-edge science and technology, and to predict possible futures, such as futuristic automobiles and highways. This format remained basically unchanged through the 1980s, though new material was scarce in later years. Other episodes were segments from Disney films such as ''[[Seal Island (film)|Seal Island]]'' and ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', or cartoons of [[Donald Duck]] and other Disney standbys.\n\nThe program spawned the [[Davy Crockett]] craze of 1955 with the airing of a three-episode series (not shown over the course of consecutive weeks) about the historical American frontiersman, starring [[Fess Parker]] in the title role. Millions of dollars of merchandise relating to the title character were sold, and the theme song, \"[[The Ballad of Davy Crockett]]\", became a hit record that year. Three historically based hour-long programs aired during late 1954/early 1955, and were followed up by two dramatized installments the following year. The TV episodes were later edited into two theatrical films.\n\nOn July 17, 1955, the opening of Disneyland was covered on a live television special, ''Dateline: Disneyland'',<ref name=\"epguides.com\"/> which is not technically considered to be part of the series. It was hosted by [[Art Linkletter]], with whom Walt Disney had worked out a deal prior to the opening to allow Linkletter to lease a shop on Main Street in return for the broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiecEZdR0aI|title=Extinct Attractions: Disney Legend Art Linkletter with David Oneal part 1|first=|last=David Oneal|date=February 11, 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> Art Linkletter was assisted by [[Bob Cummings]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], and the program featured various other guests, including various appearances of Walt himself as he dedicated the various lands of Disneyland.<ref name=\"Cotter\">{{cite book|title=The Wonderful World of Disney Television|author=Bill Cotter|publisher=[[Hachette Books|Hyperion Books]]|year=1997|location=New York|page = 17|isbn=0-7868-6359-5}}</ref>\n\n===''Walt Disney Presents'' (1958\u20131961)===\nIn 1958, the series was retitled ''Walt Disney Presents''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=Tim |last2=Marsh |first2=Earle |title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present |date=2007 |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=New York|isbn=9780345497734|page=1482 |edition=9th |url=https://books.google.com/?id=w8KztFy6QYwC&pg=PA1482&dq=%22walt+disney+presents%22+brooks+marsh#v=onepage&q=%22walt%20disney%20presents%22%20brooks%20marsh&f=false |accessdate=2017-11-12}}</ref> and moved to a Friday-night timeslot; by 1960, ABC had switched it to Sunday nights, where it remained for 21 years. During this iteration, ''The Peter Tchaikovsky Story,'' an episode made to promote Walt's latest animated feature, ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'', was one of the first stereo [[simulcast]]s on TV; in this case it was 3 channel stereo. FM radio stations across the country carried the left channel at the same time as ABC broadcast the TV show in mono, which served as a center channel, and AM radio stations broadcast the right channel. In the second half of the show, a lengthy clip of ''Sleeping Beauty'' was shown, with its 6 channels (70mm version) mixed down into 3 for the broadcast. Walt apparently wanted people to see ''Sleeping Beauty'' in 70&nbsp;mm, so, in the introduction, he explained the difference between 35&nbsp;mm and 70&nbsp;mm and held up a card with both sizes on it.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Peter Tchaikovsky Story (Television)|url=https://d23.com/a-to-z/peter-tchaikovsky-story-the-television/|website=[[D23 (Disney)|D23]]|publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]]|accessdate=December 22, 2016}}</ref> In addition to episodes devoted to the latest additions at Disneyland, many episodes during this period were Westerns such as \"[[Texas John Slaughter (TV series)|Texas John Slaughter]]\" and \"[[Elfego Baca#Walt Disney television series|Elfego Baca]]\", while others talked about the [[NASA|United States' burgeoning efforts to explore outer space]] and others, such as \"[[Moochie of the Little League]]\", were set in the then-present day. Some episodes even mixed live-action and animation, showing Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, and Jiminy Cricket talking with Walt himself, while one 1959 episode turned the spotlight on Chip 'n' Dale, combining their theatrical cartoons with mixed media wrap-around footage.\n\n===''Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color'' (1961\u20131969)===\nAlthough the basic format remained the same, the series moved to [[NBC]] on September 24, 1961, to take advantage of that network's ability to broadcast programming in [[color television|color]].<ref name=\"epguides.com\"/> In addition, Walt Disney's relationship with ABC had soured as the network resisted selling its stake in the theme park before doing so in 1960.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chronology of Disneyland Theme Park (1960\u20131965)|url=http://kpolsson.com/disland/dl1960.htm|website=Kpolsson.com|date=February 1, 1956|accessdate=October 15, 2013}}</ref> In a display of foresight, Disney had filmed many of the earlier shows in color, allowing them to easily be repeated on NBC; since all but three of Disney's feature-length films were also made in color (the three [[black-and-white]] exceptions were ''[[The Shaggy Dog (1959 film)|The Shaggy Dog]]'', ''[[The Absent-Minded Professor]]'', and ''[[Son of Flubber]]'', all family comedies starring [[Fred MacMurray]]), they could now also be telecast in that format.\n\nTo emphasize the new feature, the series was retitled ''Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color'' when NBC began airing it,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Story of Color Television|url=http://161.58.97.168/200111/11114c01.html|website=161.58.9.168|accessdate=October 15, 2013}}</ref> retaining that moniker until 1969, by which time the [[Big Three television networks|big three networks]] were all broadcasting in color. The first NBC episode even dealt with the principles of color, as explained by a new character named [[Ludwig Von Drake]] (voiced by [[Paul Frees]]), a bumbling professor with a thick German accent, who was the uncle of [[Donald Duck]]. Von Drake was the first Disney character created specifically for television.\n\n[[Image:Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color'' title sequence]]\nWalt Disney died on December 15, 1966, 12 years after the anthology series premiered.

After that, the studio decided that Walt's persona as host was such a key part of the show's appeal to viewers that the host segment was dropped.\n\n===''The Wonderful World of Disney'' (1969\u20131979)===\nThe series was retitled ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' in September 1969, as the previous title was no longer needed due to the aforementioned developments in color broadcasting. It continued to gain solid ratings, often ranking in the top 20, until the mid-1970s.\n\nIn 1976, Disney showed its hit 1961 film ''[[The Parent Trap (1961 film)|The Parent Trap]]'' on television for the first time, as a 2\u00bd-hour special. This marked a major step in broadcasting for the studio, which had never shown one of its more popular films on television in a time slot longer than an hour (although it had shown ''[[Now You See Him, Now You Don't]]'' and ''[[Napoleon and Samantha]]'' in a two-hour format in 1975).<ref name=\"billcotter.com\">{{cite web|title=Appendix B \u2013 The Anthology Series|url=http://www.billcotter.com/tvbook/appendix-b.htm|website=BillCotter.com|accessdate=October 15, 2013}}</ref> Walt Disney Productions also began running some of its multiepisode television programs, such as 1962's ''Sammy The Way-Out Seal'', as televised feature films on the anthology series. A slightly edited version of the 1954 Disney film ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' made its television debut as a two-hour special on NBC in October 1976.<ref name=\"billcotter.com\"/> Several other Disney films, some of them not especially successful (such as ''[[Superdad]]'', which was an outright flop in its initial theatrical release) were also aired on the program in the form of two-hour broadcasts that year. However, the multiepisode format for feature films had not been discontinued; as late as 1981, films such as ''[[Pollyanna (1960 film)|Pollyanna]]'' were still being shown on the Disney program in several installments running a week apart.<ref name=\"billcotter.com\"/>\n\nDuring the early 1970s, the show began to increasingly concentrate less on animated cartoons and dramatic or comedy films, and began to place an emphasis on nature-oriented programs (such as the ''[[True-Life Adventures]]'').<ref name=\"billcotter.com\"/>\n\nThe show's continued ratings success in the post-Walt era came to an end during the 1975\u201376 season. At this time, Walt Disney Productions was facing a decline in fortunes due to falling box-office revenues, while NBC as a whole was also slipping in the ratings. The anthology series became even more dependent on airings of live-action theatrical features, its ''True-Life Adventures'', reruns of older episodes, and cartoon compilations. Nothing from the [[Disney animated features canon]] aired, with the exceptions of ''Alice in Wonderland'' and ''[[Dumbo]]'', as part of a long-standing policy placed on the program by Disney. Additionally, in 1975, when CBS regained the broadcast rights to the 1939 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', it was scheduled opposite ''Disney'', as it had been between 1960 and 1968. At that time, telecasts of that film were highly rated annual events, which largely attracted the same family audience as the Disney series. From 1968 to 1975, when NBC held the television rights to ''Oz'' (which it had acquired from CBS in 1967), it usually pre-empted ''Disney'' to show it. However, the show's stiffest weekly competition came from CBS's newsmagazine ''[[60 Minutes (American television series)|60 Minutes]]''.\n\nIn 1975, an amendment to the [[Prime Time Access Rule]] gave the Sunday 7:00&nbsp;pm [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] slot back to the networks, allowing NBC to move ''Disney'' back by a half-hour. It also allowed CBS to schedule ''60 Minutes'' at 7:00&nbsp;pm Eastern Time starting on December 7; prior to this, ''60 Minutes'' had aired at 6:00&nbsp;pm Eastern and did not begin its seasons until after the [[National Football League]] season ended. ''Disney'' fell out of the top 30, while ''60 Minutes'' had its ratings rise significantly.\n\n===''Disney's Wonderful World'' (1979\u20131981)===\nIn September 1979, the studio agreed to then-NBC president [[Fred Silverman]]'s request for changes to the program. The show shortened its title to ''Disney's Wonderful World'', and updated the opening sequence with a computer-generated logo and [[disco]]-styled theme song, but largely kept the same format. The problems for the show continued. As a result of the ratings strength of ''60 Minutes'', compounded by low ratings, increasingly less original material, and frequent pre-emptions (primarily due to sporting events such as [[NFL on NBC|NFL game telecasts]]),<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cotter|first1=Bill|title=Appendix B: The Anthology Series Schedules|url=http://www.billcotter.com/tvbook/appendix-b.pdf|website=billcotter.com|accessdate=22 December 2016}}</ref> NBC cancelled ''Disney'' in 1981.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Vernon|title=Scott's World: Networks Load Guns|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/05/08/Scotts-World-Networks-Load-Guns/3235358142400/|newspaper=[[United Press International]]|publisher=[[News World Communications]]|accessdate=22 December 2016|date=8 May 1981}}</ref> One factor that was beyond the control of either Disney or NBC was a 94-day strike by the [[Screen Actors' Guild]] that cut the number of shows for the 1980\u20131981 season,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Townsend|first1=Ed|title=Actors strike could delay fall TV season|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1980/0724/072454.html|website=csmonitor.com|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=22 December 2016|date=24 July 1980}}</ref> but the damage was done nonetheless.\n\n===''Walt Disney'' (1981\u20131983)===\nFollowing NBC's announcement that it would drop the anthology series, CBS picked up the program and began airing it on Saturdays at 8:00 pm Eastern Time, in September 1981. Despite a more elaborate credit sequence and another title change, to simply ''Walt Disney'', the series' format remained unchanged. During the 1981\u20131982 season, the series had a full season's worth of material again, but little of it was new. Among the little that actually was new were a handful of pilots based on ''[[Pollyanna (1960 film)|Pollyanna]]'', ''[[Escape to Witch Mountain]]'', and ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang]]'', but only the last of the three pilots was sold and became the half-hour sitcom ''[[Gun Shy (TV series)|Gun Shy]]'' the following season, one of the studio's first entries in that genre.\n\nThe 1982\u20131983 season had enough material to fill the time slot, but almost all of it was pre-existing material, the lone exception being the celebrity-laden opening ceremony of [[Epcot]] on October 23. It also did not help matters that NBC slotted the family-friendly sitcoms ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'' and ''[[Silver Spoons]]'' at 8:00 pm and 8:30 pm up against it to draw children away from CBS. After moving to Tuesday at the beginning of 1983, it went on hiatus on February 15 while the aforementioned ''Gun Shy'' took up the second half of its time slot. When it came back for summer reruns on May 3, it was still on Tuesday at 8:00 pm; its final network broadcast was on September 24, bringing an uninterrupted 29-year run on all three networks to a close.\n\nThe end of the show coincided with the launch of the studio's [[cable television]] network, the [[Disney Channel]]. While ratings were a factor, the final decision to end the show came from Walt Disney Productions' then-CEO [[Card Walker]], who felt that having both the show and the new channel active would result in cannibalization of viewership.<ref name=\"DisneyWar\">{{cite book|title=Disneywar|author=[[James B.

Although he was not a performer, after filming a test video with his wife Jane and a member of his executive team (which required multiple takes), studio management believed he could do the hosting job. Eisner hired Michael Kay, a director of political commercials for then-[[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] [[Bill Bradley]], to help him improve his on-camera performance.<ref name=\"The Keys to the Kingdom\"/>\n\n''The Disney Sunday Movie'' initially aired as ABC's lead-off program on Sundays, running from 7:00 to 9:00&nbsp;pm Eastern Time.<ref name=lat/> By this point, the format was similar to a movie-of-the-week. Gary Barton, a Disney senior vice president, was in charge of the program. ''Help Wanted: Kids'' was the first episode's film. Other first revival year films were, ''Young Again'', ''The Richest Cat in the World'', ''I-Man'' (starring Scott Bakula),<ref>{{cite book|title=The Best TV Shows That Never Were|last=Goldberg|first=Lee|year=2015}}</ref> and ''My Town''. Sometimes the slot would feature special instead of dramatic material like \"Disney Goes to the Oscars\" featuring the studio's Academy Award winners, and \"The Greatest Moments in Disney Animation\".<ref name=lat/> A handful of [[List of Disney Channel original films|Disney Channel original films]] made their network television debuts during these iteration as well,<ref name=bcm>{{cite journal|title=Stoddard  charts  ABC's long  road  ahead|journal=Broadcasting Magazine|date=June 30, 1986|pages=38\u201339|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1986/BC-1986-06-30.pdf}}</ref> but the program did not present any film made by Disney's [[Touchstone Pictures|Touchstone subsidiary]] as such films were not considered appropriate for children. However, ''[[Splash, Too]]'', a sequel to [[Splash (film)|the 1984 film]], aired on the series over two weeks in May 1988. The series had increased Disney park attendance and ABC's Sunday night ratings for the evening by an average 27% for the rest of the season. Disney, wanting to make it a regular viewing habit, gave ABC additional films from its library, including  ''[[Old Yeller]]'', ''The Apple Dumpling Gang'', and ''[[Candleshoe]]'' for the normal rerun mid-year period. ''The Last Electric Knight'' series movie produced a spin-off, originally to be called ''[[Sidekicks (TV series)|Karate Kid]]'' for ABC's 1987 season.<ref name=bcm/>\n\nDespite improving ABC's numbers, the program's ratings were never strong as the established ''60 Minutes'' and scripted mystery series ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' on [[CBS]], both of which Disney was competing with for viewers, remained the leading primetime programs on Sunday nights. In 1987, ABC reduced ''The Disney Sunday Movie'' from two hours to one. The move did not help drive ratings, and the network decided not to renew its contract with Disney or pick up a fourth season of the second iteration of the anthology series.\n\n''The Disney Sunday Movie'' was also being run on the [[Disney Channel]], also hosted by Eisner.<ref name=\"drn\" />\n\n===''The Magical World of Disney'' (1988\u20131990)===\nIn the spring of 1988, NBC decided to renew its association with the company after it cut ties to the anthology series seven years earlier; the network brought the series, now named ''The Magical World of Disney'', to serve as the lead-in of its Sunday lineup in September 1988. As the program had done during its last season as ''The Disney Sunday Movie'', ''The Magical World of Disney'' ran for one hour, airing at 7:00&nbsp;pm Eastern Time; Michael Eisner also returned as its presenter. \nDuring this period, the show attempted to reintroduce the rotating format the show started out with in 1954.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Ron|title=Nbc Moves Ahead With `Back To Basics` Lineup|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-03-22/features/8803020752_1_disney-hour-nbc-entertainment-brandon-tartikoff|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|accessdate=22 December 2016|date=22 March 1988}}</ref> It also introduced new versions of Walt-era movies and TV shows such as ''[[The Absent-Minded Professor#Remakes|The Absent-Minded Professor]]'', a reboot of ''[[Davy Crockett (miniseries)|Davy Crockett]]'', and the musical ''[[Polly (1989 film)|Polly]]'', which was based on the book ''[[Pollyanna]]'' by [[Eleanor H. Porter]] and the [[Pollyanna (1960 film)|Walt Disney's 1960 film adaptation of it]]. \nIn the 1989\u20131990 season, during which the company was negotiating with [[Jim Henson]] to buy [[The Muppets]], they aired two Muppet specials; one of them was ''[[The Muppets at Walt Disney World]]'', which turned out to be Henson's last Muppet special. He died May 16, 1990, 10 days after the special aired, and the company only acquired The Muppets more than a decade later.\n\nAfter two seasons experiencing the same lackluster ratings as it had accrued during the end of its initial NBC run and its subsequent runs on CBS and ABC, Disney elected to end the broadcast television run of ''The Magical World of Disney'' and began airing the anthology on the Disney Channel \u2013 in the same time slot it had been airing for the past decade \u2013 starting in September 1990, expanding back to a two-hour format. Since the Disney Channel operated as a [[pay television|premium channel]] at the time, films presented on the series were presented without commercial interruption. ''The Magical World of Disney'' originally aired on the cable channel as a weekly Sunday-only program for its first 5\u00bd years; but in September 1996, as part of the first phase of a programming revamp that culminated in its formal conversion into a commercial-free basic cable channel in April 1997, the Disney Channel expanded the ''Magical World'' brand to encompass its Monday through Saturday primetime film block, maintaining its 7:00&nbsp;pm Eastern time slot.\n\n===''The Wonderful World of Disney'' (1991\u2013present)===\n''The Wonderful World of Disney'' returned in 1991 as an umbrella title for Disney specials airing on major networks (CBS airings used the historical title ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' for the first few years, while other networks broadcast the show with another title, ''A Disney Special'').\n \t\nIn 1997, with Disney acquiring ABC the previous year, ABC gave the series a regular slot in the schedule.<ref name=\"drn\" /> Disney CEO Eisner formed [[Disney Telefilms]] by 1995 to supply original films to the series<ref name=bc>{{cite news|last1=Romano|first1=Allison|title=Game Boy |url= http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/game-boy/102439 |accessdate=December 30, 2015|work=Broadcasting & Cable |publisher= NewBay Media, LLC |date=March 14, 2004}}</ref><ref name=vty>{{cite news|last1=Littleton|first1=Cynthia|title=Disney Telefilms ups exex|url=https://variety.com/1998/biz/news/disney-telefilms-ups-exex-1117468572/|accessdate=December 30, 2015|work=Variety|date=March 9, 1998}}</ref> and program together with ABC.<ref name=\"drn\" /> It led the network's Sunday night lineup at the 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern time slot,<ref name=vty0>{{cite news|title=Disney Sets ABC Pix|url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/disney-sets-abc-pix-1117342089/|accessdate=December 30, 2015|work=Variety|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=May 1, 1997}}</ref> resulting in the displacement of Sunday mainstay ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'', which had occupied the slot since 1992.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} On September 28, 1997, the all-new ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' premiered with the network television premiere of ''[[Toy Story]]''. On October 5, 1997, Disney Telefilms' first production, ''[[Toothless (film)|Toothless]]'', debuted on the series. In addition to the planned 16 original Disney telemovies, ABC and Disney added a few direct-to-video movies and films from other sources.<ref name=\"drn\" />\n\nIn 2001, a Spanish-language version of the program premiered on [[Telemundo]] (which, incidentally, was acquired by the English version's former home, [[NBC]], that same year 2001-2010) as ''El Maravilloso Mundo de Disney'', with more of a focus on Disney theatrical films than the English broadcasts at the time for Spanish version's former [[Disney Channel (Latin America)]].\n\nIn September 2003, ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' moved to Saturdays at 8:00 pm Eastern, with the previous Sunday time slot being ceded to ''AFV'' (which moved back to Sundays that season) and drama series in the 8:00&nbsp;pm hour. Rare exceptions to the program's format occurred during this time; for example, a ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV miniseries)|Little House on the Prairie]]'' miniseries ran for several weeks in 2004 under the ''Wonderful World of Disney'' banner. For most of its second run on ABC, the program aired throughout the television season, with the exception of the 2005\u201306 season (when it aired during the midseason only), and in 2007 and 2008 (when it was relegated to the summer months), with a broader array of films occupying the network's Saturday primetime slot at other times, when [[ESPN on ABC|sports programming]] did not air. The series ended as a regular program in 2008.\n\nAt this point, the series began to shift focus toward Disney theatrical films, relying less on original television films; however, the series aired two Disney Channel Original Movies (2002's ''[[Cadet Kelly]]'' and 2008's ''[[Camp Rock]]'', currently the only Disney Channel television films to have aired on non-Disney Channel-branded network domestically) during its ABC run. The second ABC revival also included some family-oriented films produced by studios other than Disney under the ''Wonderful World'' banner, such as ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' from [[20th Century Fox]] ([[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|which is presently owned by Disney]]) and the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' film series and ''[[Space Jam]]'' from [[Warner Bros.]], as well as television films such as ''[[Princess of Thieves]]'' from [[Granada Productions]] and the 2001 remake of ''[[Brian's Song (2001)|Brian's Song]]'' from [[Columbia TriStar Television]] (now known as [[Sony Pictures Television]]).\n\nIn December 2015, ABC's ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' officially returned to its anthology format with a showing of ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' for the first time on ABC since 2002, hosted by Dick Van Dyke.

Reruns of the anthology series were discontinued when the channel purged all vintage material with the removal of its Vault Disney late-night block on September 8, 2002.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vhat Vood Vault Do?|url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_hill/archive/2002/09/06/261.aspx|author=Jim Hill|website=Jim Hill Media|date=September 6, 2002|accessdate=October 15, 2013}}</ref> However, a few select episodes are available on VHS or DVD (some of which are exclusive to the [[Disney Movie Club]]), with the possibility of additional future releases.\n\nRecently, live-action Disney films from the 1950s to the 1980s have aired on [[Turner Classic Movies]], without commercial interruption, and presented uncut and with [[letterbox]]ing on the network's [[Standard-definition television|standard-definition]] feed.\n\nAll of the episodes and existing material used on the series up to 1996 are listed in the Bill Cotter book ''The Wonderful World of Disney Television'', which was released in 1997 by [[Hyperion Books]] (which was owned by the Walt Disney Company at the book's publication).<ref name=\"Cotter\"/>\n\n==Programming==\nOriginally hosted by Walt Disney himself, the original format of the Disney anthology series consisted of a balance of theatrical [[animated cartoon]]s, live-action features, and other informational material (some original, some pre-existing) from the studio's library. For many years, the show also featured edited one-hour versions of such then-recent Disney films as ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', and in other cases, telecasts of complete Disney films that were split into two or more one-hour episodes.<ref name=\"epguides.com\">{{cite web|title=Walt Disney Presents (a Titles & Air Dates Guide)|url=http://epguides.com/WaltDisneyPresents/|website=[[Epguides]]|date=August 5, 2012|accessdate=October 15, 2013}}</ref> Later original programs consisted of dramatizations of other historical figures and legends along the lines of the [[Davy Crockett]] mini-series. These included [[Daniel Boone (1960 TV series)|a miniseries based on Daniel Boone]] (not the Fess Parker characterization), [[Texas John Slaughter (TV series)|Texas John Slaughter]], [[Elfego Baca]], [[Francis Marion]] (the \"[[The Swamp Fox (TV series)|Swamp Fox]]\") and 1977's ''Kit Carson and the Mountain Man'' (with [[Christopher Connelly (actor)|Christopher Connelly]] as [[Kit Carson]], [[Robert Reed]] as [[John C. Fremont]], and [[Gregg Palmer]] as mountain man [[Jim Bridger]]).\n\nOccasionally, a more educational segment would be featured (such as ''[[The Story of the Animated Drawing]]''), including nature and animal programs similar to the ''True-Life Adventures'' that were released in theaters, as well as various dramatic installments which were either structured as single-part, two-part, and sometimes, multipart editions. Much of the original informational excerpts were to create awareness of Disneyland. In spite of essentially serving as advertisements for the park, entertainment value was emphasized, as well to make the shows palatable. Some of the program's informational content was formatted to promote upcoming feature film releases by the studio (such as ''20,000 Leagues Under the Sea'' and ''[[Darby O'Gill and the Little People]]''), with some programs focusing on the art and technology of animation itself.\n\n==Theme music==\n* From 1954 to 1961, the series used the song \"[[When You Wish Upon a Star]]\" as its theme. The recording was taken directly from the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''.\n* From 1961 to 1969, an original song was used, \"The Wonderful World of Color\", written by [[Richard M. Sherman]] and [[Robert B. Sherman]]. This song helped to emphasize the use of color with its lyrics.\n* From 1969 to 1979 (''The Wonderful World of Disney''), orchestral medleys of various Disney songs from movies and theme parks as theme songs.\n* From 1979 to 1980 (''Disney's Wonderful World''), a [[disco]]-styled theme was written to emphasize the new visual changes, even though the format remained the same. [[John Debney]] composed the melody and [[John Klawitter]] wrote the lyrics.\n** From 1980 to 1981, the series discarded the Debney/Klawitter theme and went back to an earlier orchestral medley theme, while keeping the 1979 credits motif and title.\n* From 1981 to 1983 (''Walt Disney''), a short disco arrangement of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\", arranged by [[Frank Gari]], served as theme against some elaborate, then-state-of-the-art computer graphics. [[CBC Television]] in Canada also used this title sequence and theme music for their own versions of the show. The sequence was also used as the opening sequence on international [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Walt Disney Home Video]] releases until 1987.\n* From 1986 to 1988, a synthesized, [[pop-rock]] arrangement of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" with some clapping was the theme. This was used again for the 1989\u201390 season of ''The Magical World of Disney'' and the 1991\u201396 run on The [[Disney Channel]].\n* In 1988, an orchestral medley of \"[[A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes]]\" and \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" was used. This was switched back to the 1987 theme in 1989.\n* From 1991 to 1997, an orchestral medley of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" and \"[[Part of Your World]]\" (the latter from Disney's then recent hit ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'') was used for network airings of the show (known as ''The Wonderful World of Disney'' on CBS and ''A Disney Special'' on other networks) as well as ''[[The 100 Lives of Black Jack Savage]]'', a collaboration with [[Stephen J. Cannell Productions]]. This theme was also used internationally.\n* From 1997 to 2002, an orchestral medley of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" and \"A Whole New World\" (the latter used in the movie ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'') were used; also used occasionally was the Louis Armstrong hit \"[[What a Wonderful World]]\". This theme is still used today internationally.\n* From 2002 to 2007, a newer orchestral arrangement of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" with a wordless choir was used for ABC airings in the United States.\n* From 2007 to 2008, another orchestral arrangement of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" (in actuality, the theme from the current [[Walt Disney Pictures]] logo, composed by [[Mark Mancina]]) and a brand-new opening title sequence (depicting a montage of the company's work) are used for ABC airings in the United States.\n* From 2012 on, \"Heaven\u2019s Triumph\", composed by Robert Etoll via Q-Factory, is used along with a brand-new opening title sequence (updated to include ''[[Star Wars]]'' and [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel]] properties).\n\n==International broadcasts==\n\n=== Argentina ===\n\n==== The Telefe era ====\n''El mundo de Disney'' (The World of Disney) aired for the first time on the [[Over the air television|OTA]] network [[Telefe]] in 1990, hosted by Leonardo Greco.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1771672-leonardo-greco-amo-este-pais-aunque-hay-que-arreglarle-algunas-cosas|title=Leonardo Greco: \"Amo este pa\u00eds, aunque hay que arreglarle algunas cosas\"|publisher=}}</ref> He remained as the sole presenter of the show, lasting until 1995, when the series concluded. The programme started airing at 8:00pm nightly from the second half of 1990 until December 1992. By 1993, it was moved to weekday afternoons at 5:00pm. When it was coming to an end, around 1994, shifted to Sunday afternoons, and aired a long marathon of movies and cartoons. According to Greco, this programme was possible because of a distributor who acquired the material, and was allowed to be shown without following a strict format, because the company wanted to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://delosnoventas.blogspot.com.ar/2009/10/entrevista-con-leonardo-greco-la-cara.html|title=Entrevista con Leonardo Greco, la cara de Disney en la Argentina de los 90|first=|last=Noventosos|date=October 9, 2009|publisher=}}</ref>\nTelefe wanted a comeback, and appointed chef and host Maru Botana (then network talent) to present ''Planeta Disney'' (Disney Planet) on Sunday evenings, at 8:00pm, beginning November 21, 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/654303-planeta-disney-en-la-orbita-de-telefe|title=\"Planeta Disney\" en la \u00f3rbita de Telef\u00e9|publisher=}}</ref> Starting on July 9, 2005,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2005/07/09/espectaculos/c-00203.htm|title=Vuelven Pluto y compa\u00f1\u00eda|publisher=}}</ref> Botana was replaced with two personalities employed by Disney, Carolina Ibarra and Dani Martins.

The only clear difference was that only movies starring human actors, like ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' or ''[[The Island at the Top of the World]]'', could be broadcast, and not the cartoons. This experiment lasted until early 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://logos.foroslatinos.tv/t1350-programacion-de-tv-domingo-3-de-diciembre-de-1995?highlight=1995|title=1995 \u2013 Programaci\u00f3n de TV \u2013 domingo 3 de diciembre de 1995|publisher=}}</ref>\nBy 2007, the network took off from Telefe the exclusive rights to show all the Disney franchise movies and programs, and began to air its movies on Sunday evenings at 7:00pm, without a host. This also allowed Canal 13 to detain rights for other shows not related with Disney, but with the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network, like ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' or ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', and to produce a localised version of the high-grossing film ''[[High School Musical: El Desaf\u00edo|High School Musical]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/suplementos/espectaculos/8-6093-2007-04-20.html|title=P\u00e1gina/12 :: espectaculos|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Australia ===\nAfter more than 30 years of the Seven Network, in 2019, it now broadcast on the [[Nine Network]] and on [[9Go!]].\n\n=== Brazil ===\nThe ABC run of the program under ''The Magical World of Disney'' title originally aired in that country under the title ''Cine Disney'' on the Brazilian-portuguese version of [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televis\u00e3o]] (SBT) in partnership with [[The Walt Disney Company]].

Yates]], who as [[Governor of New York]] signed the act establishing the county.\n\nYates County is included in the [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], NY [[Rochester, New York Metropolitan Area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\nWhen counties were established in New York State in 1683, the present Yates County was part of [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]]. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of New York State as well as all of the present State of [[Vermont]] and, in theory, extending westward to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766 by the creation of [[Cumberland County, New York|Cumberland County]], and again on March 16, 1770 by the creation of [[Gloucester County, New York|Gloucester County]], both containing territory now in Vermont.\n\nOn March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One of the other pieces, [[Tryon County, New York|Tryon County]], contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County was approximately five miles west of the present city of [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], and the county included the western part of the [[Adirondack Mountains]] and the area west of the West Branch of the [[Delaware River]]. The area then designated as Tryon County now includes 37 counties of New York State. The county was named for [[William Tryon]], colonial governor of New York.\n\nIn the years prior to 1776, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County fled to [[Canada]]. In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the [[American Revolutionary War]], the name of Tryon County was changed to honor the general, [[Richard Montgomery]], who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of [[Quebec]], replacing the name of the hated British governor.\n\nOn January 27, 1789, {{convert|10480|sqmi|km2|-1}} of Montgomery County was split off to create [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]], including the lands of the present [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany]], [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus]], [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua]], [[Erie County, New York|Erie]], [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee]], [[Livingston County, New York|Livingston]], [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe]], [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara]], [[Orleans County, New York|Orleans]], [[Steuben County, New York|Steuben]], [[Wyoming County, New York|Wyoming]], and Yates counties, and part of [[Schuyler County, New York|Schuyler]] and [[Wayne County, New York|Wayne]] counties.\n\nOn March 18, 1796, {{convert|1800|sqmi|km2|-2}} of Ontario County was partitioned to form Steuben County.\n\nOn April 3, 1801, Ontario County exchanged land with [[Cayuga County, New York|Cayuga County]], and lost {{convert|190|sqmi|km2|-1}} as a result.\n\nOn March 30, 1802, Ontario County lost {{convert|6540|sqmi|km2|-1}} of land through the partition of Genesee County, including the present Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, [[Erie County, New York|Erie]], Niagara, Orleans and Wyoming counties and parts of Livingston and Monroe counties.\n\nIn 1821, Ontario County was reduced in size by combining portions of Genesee and Ontario counties to create Livingston and Monroe counties.\n\nOn February 5, 1823, Yates County was formed from {{convert|310|sqmi|km2}} of Ontario County, including the area that included [[Vine Valley, New York|Vine Valley]], [[Middlesex, New York|Middlesex]], [[Penn Yan, New York|Penn Yan]], and [[Dresden, Yates County, New York|Dresden, New York]].<ref>'''New York. ''Laws of New York.''1823, 46th Session, Chapter 30, Section 1; Page 21'''</ref>\n\nOn January 1, 1826, {{convert|60|sqmi|km2}} of Steuben County was partitioned and added to Yates, which included [[Starkey, New York|Starkey]], [[Dundee, New York|Dundee]], and [[Lakemont, New York]].<ref>'''New York. ''Laws of New York.''1824, 47th Session, Chapter 171; Page 182'''</ref>\n\nOn April 15, 1828, {{convert|10|sqmi|km2}} was partitioned from Yates, and passed to Seneca and Tompkins counties, mostly in the forest.<ref>'''New York.

Yates]], who as [[Governor of New York]] signed the act establishing the county.\n\nYates County is included in the [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], NY [[Rochester, New York Metropolitan Area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\nWhen counties were established in New York State in 1683, the present Yates County was part of [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]]. This was an enormous county, including the northern part of New York State as well as all of the present State of [[Vermont]] and, in theory, extending westward to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766 by the creation of [[Cumberland County, New York|Cumberland County]], and again on March 16, 1770 by the creation of [[Gloucester County, New York|Gloucester County]], both containing territory now in Vermont.\n\nOn March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One of the other pieces, [[Tryon County, New York|Tryon County]], contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County was approximately five miles west of the present city of [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], and the county included the western part of the [[Adirondack Mountains]] and the area west of the West Branch of the [[Delaware River]]. The area then designated as Tryon County now includes 37 counties of New York State. The county was named for [[William Tryon]], colonial governor of New York.\n\nIn the years prior to 1776, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County fled to [[Canada]]. In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the [[American Revolutionary War]], the name of Tryon County was changed to honor the general, [[Richard Montgomery]], who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of [[Quebec]], replacing the name of the hated British governor.\n\nOn January 27, 1789, {{convert|10480|sqmi|km2|-1}} of Montgomery County was split off to create [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]], including the lands of the present [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany]], [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus]], [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua]], [[Erie County, New York|Erie]], [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee]], [[Livingston County, New York|Livingston]], [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe]], [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara]], [[Orleans County, New York|Orleans]], [[Steuben County, New York|Steuben]], [[Wyoming County, New York|Wyoming]], and Yates counties, and part of [[Schuyler County, New York|Schuyler]] and [[Wayne County, New York|Wayne]] counties.\n\nOn March 18, 1796, {{convert|1800|sqmi|km2|-2}} of Ontario County was partitioned to form Steuben County.\n\nOn April 3, 1801, Ontario County exchanged land with [[Cayuga County, New York|Cayuga County]], and lost {{convert|190|sqmi|km2|-1}} as a result.\n\nOn March 30, 1802, Ontario County lost {{convert|6540|sqmi|km2|-1}} of land through the partition of Genesee County, including the present Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, [[Erie County, New York|Erie]], Niagara, Orleans and Wyoming counties and parts of Livingston and Monroe counties.\n\nIn 1821, Ontario County was reduced in size by combining portions of Genesee and Ontario counties to create Livingston and Monroe counties.\n\nOn February 5, 1823, Yates County was formed from {{convert|310|sqmi|km2}} of Ontario County, including the area that included [[Vine Valley, New York|Vine Valley]], [[Middlesex, New York|Middlesex]], [[Penn Yan, New York|Penn Yan]], and [[Dresden, Yates County, New York|Dresden, New York]].<ref>'''New York. ''Laws of New York.''1823, 46th Session, Chapter 30, Section 1; Page 21'''</ref>\n\nOn January 1, 1826, {{convert|60|sqmi|km2}} of Steuben County was partitioned and added to Yates, which included [[Starkey, New York|Starkey]], [[Dundee, New York|Dundee]], and [[Lakemont, New York]].<ref>'''New York. ''Laws of New York.''1824, 47th Session, Chapter 171; Page 182'''</ref>\n\nOn April 15, 1828, {{convert|10|sqmi|km2}} was partitioned from Yates, and passed to Seneca and Tompkins counties, mostly in the forest.<ref>'''New York. ''Revised Statutes of the State of New York, Passed during the years 1827 and 1828; 3 Volumes; [[Albany, New York]].''1829; Volume 3;Pages 14-15'''</ref>\n\nOn March 17, 1860, Ontario County was authorized to gain land from Yates, but it was never put into effect.<ref>'''New York.

For this purpose, [[magic in fiction|magical powers]] over the five [[classical element]]s have been given to them. The new guardians are Will, Irma, Taranee, Cornelia, and Hay Lin, whose initials form the title acronym \"W.I.T.C.H.\".\n\nIn 2004, series creators Alessandro Barbucci and Barbara Canepa unsuccessfully sued Disney for the initial rights to ''W.I.T.C.H.'' after issues with management at the publishing company.<ref name=\"antonio\"/> As a result, Canepa founded her own comics company.<ref name=\"pw\"/>\n\n==Background and production==\nUpon seeing the success of ''[[PKNA|PKNA - Paperinik New Adventures]]'' with young male audiences, some of the same writers began thinking of a concept that would work for young female audiences. Elisabetta Gnone, Alessandro Barbucci and Barbara Canepa came up with the original concepts and designs. Gnone co-wrote the first issue of the series with Francesco Artibani.\n\nGnone and Artibani originally created a concept that would last nine issues, but upon seeing the impressive sales numbers, a further three issues were ordered, rounding out the 12-issue first saga.\n\nIn 2004, tensions arose between the ''W.I.T.C.H.'' artists and Disney's publishing (Buena Vista). Series creators Alessandro Barbucci and Barbara Canepa unsuccessfully sued Disney for the initial rights to ''W.I.T.C.H.'', and Francesco Artibani was a witness in support of the two artists in court. After the lawsuit failed, Artibani and other artists decided to end their working relationships with Disney due to the \"difficult management and company.\"<ref name=\"antonio\">https://antoniogenna.com/2013/03/25/disney-in-edicola-14-speciale-la-chiusura-di-w-i-t-c-h-con-interviste-a-francesco-artibani-e-teresa-radice/</ref> Around the same time, Disney filed an unsuccessful copyright infringement lawsuit against Rainbow SpA, the studio behind ''Winx Club'' (a series cited as the main competition for ''W.I.T.C.H.''). In its April 2004 suit, the corporation claimed the ''Winx Club'' concept copied that of ''W.I.T.C.H.''; all of their claims were rejected in August,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docplayer.it/docview/26/7619504/#file=/storage/26/7619504/7619504.pdf|title=I segni distintivi nella giurisprudenza|publisher=[[University of Macerata]]|date=2008|last=Gradozzi|first=Francesco|language=it}}</ref> and Rainbow SpA won the case against Disney as they provided proof that the ''Winx Club'' production began before the ''W.I.T.C.H.'' comic was available.<ref>{{cite interview|url=https://www.comicus.it/mainmenu-interviste/item/46207-intervista-a-francesco-artibani|last=Artibani|first=Francesco|title=Intervista a Francesco Artibani|work=Comicus|date=9 April 2006|language=it}}</ref>\n\nAfter breaking off with Buena Vista and in the middle of her trial against them, Barbara Canepa created her own comic book company, Sky Doll. She described it as a way to become \"more sincere and uncensored\" with her comics. Sky Doll was unable to secure the rights to ''W.I.T.C.H.'' from Disney so instead focused on original projects.<ref name=\"pw\">https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/14783-french-publisher-soleil-finds-success-at-marvel.html</ref> Canepa stated that she intends to keep all the rights to her comics; she said, \"After my experience with Disney, it's important for me to protect myself.\"<ref name=\"pw\"/>\n\n==Comics==\n=== Part I: The Twelve Portals ===\nThe first saga introduced a world called Metamoor, ruled by a tyrannical ruler named [[Phobos (W.I.T.C.H.)|Prince Phobos]]. Years ago, Prince Phobos caused the disappearances of his parents and took over the capital city, Meridian. To prevent his spreading tyranny, the Oracle lowered a veil over the planet, separating Metamoor from the rest of the worlds under Kandrakar's protection. However, twelve portals opened between Meridian and Earth, creating a series of passageways for the desperate refugees and monsters of Meridian to infiltrate Earth. The portals also weaken the veil and in order to prevent this, generations of Guardians were sent to protect it from collapsing. In the present day, five girls are chosen to become the new Guardians: Will Vandom, the Guardian of Energy and the Keeper of the Heart, making her the leader; Irma Lair, the new Guardian of Water; Taranee Cook, the Guardian of Fire; Cornelia Hale, the Guardian of Earth; and Hay Lin, the Guardian of Air. Together, they must prevent the collapse of the veil and promote justice throughout the universe under the guidance of the Oracle of Kandrakar.\n\nThe first saga also introduced [[Elyon Brown]], a childhood friend of Cornelia. The Guardians' first mission was to close the twelve portals, but as they found out for themselves, Elyon had betrayed them. It is revealed that Elyon is Prince Phobos's younger sister who had disappeared from Meridian more than a decade ago. After Prince Phobos's right-hand man, Lord Cedric, revealed Elyon of her true alien heritage, he manipulated her into thinking that the Guardians were her enemies. The Guardians had to find a way to defeat Prince Phobos and bring Elyon back home. In Meridian, however, there is a rebellion taking place led by [[Caleb (W.I.T.C.H.)|Caleb]], whom Cornelia had seen in her dreams for years. They sought to overthrow Prince Phobos and put Elyon on the throne, as she is the legitimate ruler. The Guardians later worked together with the rebels and eventually, Elyon realized her mistake for trusting Lord Cedric. Prince Phobos had planned to absorb his sister's powers for himself during her coronation, but with the Guardians' help Elyon escaped and later battled against him for the crown. The final battle was successful, but not without some losses. Prince Phobos transformed Caleb back into a crystal flower, his most primitive form as a Murmurer. This devastated Cornelia greatly to the point where it would haunt her in the next series. As Elyon is crowned Queen and the Light of Meridian, the world of Metamoor is finally liberated. The Oracle lifted the veil off of Metamoor and light shines on the world once again. Both Prince Phobos and Cedric are imprisoned in the Tower of Mist.\n\n{{Graphic novel list/header\n|Language=Italian\n|SecondLanguage=English\n| WithTitle       = yes\n|Width=99%\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n| VolumeNumber    = 1\n| OriginalRelDate = April 2001\n| OriginalISBN    = \n| LicensedRelDate = July 2002\n| LicensedISBN    =\n| ChapterList     =\n* 1.

When the Oracle realized how the immense power of the Heart was corrupting Nerissa, he took it away from her and gave it to [[C.H.Y.K.N.|Cassidy]], the former Guardian of Water. Obsessed with her lost power and blinded by jealousy, Nerissa tricked Cassidy and killed her. As punishment, Nerissa was stripped of her magic and sentenced to sleep, alone and friendless, in Mount Thanos for an eternity, only until all [[Classical elements in popular culture|five elements]]-[[Water (classical element)|Water]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], Earth, [[Air (classical element)|Air]] and [[Aether (classical element)|Pure/Absolute Energy]]- united into one single being. \n\nWhen Cornelia accidentally, and unknowingly, absorbed all five elements into herself, the seal on Nerissa's tomb broke, setting her free. When Caleb is kidnapped, the Guardians must face Nerissa along with her four Knights of Vengeance. While successful in their rescue mission, they end up losing Luba who sacrificed herself to save them. Hoping to steal the Heart she craved for so long, Nerissa later attacked the girls through their dreams in order to weaken them but failed. She was later successful in stealing the Heart back by tricking Will into giving it to her. \n\nWith the very symbol and essence of Kandrakar itself now entirely corrupted by Nerissa's hatred and vengeance, the former Guardian leader and her Knights of Vengeance attacked the sacred Temple of Kandrakar itself. Will later acquired the Star of Cassidy, a copy of the mystical Heart from the spirit/ghost of Cassidy, the late and original Guardian of [[Water (classical element)|Water]]. With it, Will and her fellow Guardians faced Nerissa in Kandrakar. In the final battle, Nerissa was ultimately destroyed by the combined strength of the second generation of Guardians. Despite their victory, Cornelia is deeply heartbroken when Caleb left her due to their complicated relationship.\n\n{{Graphic novel list/header\n|Language=Italian\n|SecondLanguage=English\n| WithTitle       = yes\n|Width=99%\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n| VolumeNumber    = 2\n| OriginalRelDate = April 2002\n| OriginalISBN    = \n| LicensedRelDate = July 2003\n| LicensedISBN    =\n| ChapterList     =\n* 13.

Will's father, Thomas Vandom, returns into her life after years of absence, and his intentions are anything but loving and trustful. Later, [[Taranee Cook|Taranee]] went on strike because she felt that the Oracle is using them to carry out his missions and sentences. A new character, Orube, joins the remaining Guardians on their new mission to defeat a new enemy; [[List of W.I.T.C.H. characters#Part III villains|Ari]], the powerful lord of Arkhanta and they must prevent him from rising and destroying the Oracle. Ari's son, Maqi, suffered from a strange disorder since birth and the Oracle had refused to help Ari cure his son. Angered and blinded by rage, Ari captured a [[banshee]], named Yua, and tried to use her wish-granting power to oppose the Oracle and Kandrakar (but it could not be done). The longer Yua was held prisoner and serving as Ari's slave, the more powerful Ari becomes, and soon, he would have enough power to overthrow the Oracle. \n\nTaranee later rejoined the quintet and together, they were able to defeat Ari and set Yua free. Liberated, Yua kidnapped Maqi because she wanted Ari to suffer for holding her imprisoned for many years against her will. Ari and the Guardians followed her into the swamp where she and her banshee sisters live and fought them to bring Maqi back. However, Maqi was nearly killed during the confusion of the battle. He was later saved and cured when the Guardians and Orube offered their magical, elemental gifts from the nymph Xin Jing herself to him.\n\nAlthough their missions on the world Arkhanta was successful, the girls have a whole bunch of new problems on Earth that needs their attention: Interpol discovers the secret of the five Guardians' and wants to capture them and use their astounding abilities as Guardians of Kandrakar for their dark intentions. As if that was not enough, the girls' [[Astral Drop]]s decide to rebel after months of being taken advantage of by the Guardians. The Astral Drops started to cause numerous problems between the Guardians' families, teachers, and individual boyfriends' and eventually they ran away to another city. The Guardians later recaptured the Astral Drops and decided to liberate them from slavery by sending to another city entirely.\n\n{{Graphic novel list/header\n|Language=Italian\n|SecondLanguage=English\n| WithTitle       = yes\n|Width=99%\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n| VolumeNumber    = 3\n| OriginalRelDate = April 2003\n| OriginalISBN    = \n| LicensedRelDate = July 2004\n| LicensedISBN    =\n| ChapterList     =\n* 25.

The Guardians are called in to recall his recent unsatisfactory deeds and he was later found guilty by Endarno and was banished back into his home world, [[Basil\u00edade]]. Back home in [[Heatherfield]], [[Will Vandom|Will]] confronted Orube and [[List of W.I.T.C.H. characters#Boys|Matt]], while Principal Knickerbocker goes to drastic measures to raise the girls' grades at [[Sheffield]]. In Kandrakar, the Council has elected Endarno the new Oracle. After Endarno has been chosen, he makes the life of the Guardians difficult by trying to prove to the Congregation that they are too young and immature. He also convinced the Congregation that [[Elyon Brown|Elyon]], the queen and the Light of Meridian, is dangerous and unfit to rule over Metamoor. Many times he tried to get the Guardians to arrest their old friend and bring him the Crown of Light. But W.I.T.C.H. managed to hide Elyon from Endarno by smuggling her back to Earth and had Orube protect her. Moreover, Endarno is someone else than he appears to be...an old enemy coming back for revenge and an even bigger thirst for more power. \nElyon and [[Yan Lin]] discovered that \"Endarno\" is actually the consciousness and evil will of Prince Phobos, who has been using the physical self of the true Endarno, in his new quest for power and revenge.\n\nQueen Elyon then wields her vital life energy to Yan Lin, who then gives it to Will to hide within the Heart of Kandrakar for safeguarding. The Guardians were able locate the old Oracle, now called Himerish, upon the discovery of his old identity before leaving for Kandrakar, with the help of Orube. Together, they tried to free Elyon from her prison and put a stop to Cedric and Phobos before Endarno (Phobos) is formally instated as the Oracle. In the end, Himerish was able to locate the real Endarno and he, in turn, revealed to the Council that the Endarno that they knew was, in actuality, the malicious Prince Phobos' mind and spirit in his body. Elyon returned to power on her world of Meridian, Cedric was back in the Tower of Mist, and Prince Phobos, rather than being locked up in prison again, threw himself into the endless void of Kandrakar. \n\n{{Graphic novel list/header\n|Language=Italian\n|SecondLanguage=English\n| WithTitle       = yes\n|Width=99%\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n| VolumeNumber    = 4\n| OriginalRelDate = April 2004\n| OriginalISBN    = \n| LicensedRelDate = July 2005\n| LicensedISBN    =\n| ChapterList     =\n* 37.

Each Guardian has discovered new and much stronger abilities, yet their elemental abilities are going out of control. Even the Triumvirate of Kandrakar does not have full understanding about it. At the same time, Cedric is disposed of his magical strength and power and gets a second chance from the Oracle. He returns to \"Ye Olde Book Shop\" to live a decent life, under supervision from the Guardians. Nevertheless, he searches for a useful resource to regain his powers in hopes of getting revenge on the Guardians. He finds his luck in the Book of Elements, written by Jonathan Ludmoore (which the Guardians later found out). About a century before, Jonathan Ludmoore was an [[alchemist]] who came from Metamoor and it was Prince Phobos who had sent him to Heatherfield in order to open the Twelve Portals. After completing his mission, Ludmoore discovered that the city is a place where all five elements\u2014[[Water (classical element)|Water]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Air (classical element)|Air]], [[Quintessence (classical element)|Quintessence]]\u2014met and stayed. He experimented on the elements but it trapped Ludmoore in his own book and released all five elemental stones throughout the city.\n\nAfter Matt was swallowed by the Book of Elements (thanks to Cedric), the Guardians must cooperate with Cedric in order to save Matt. The book gives them riddles as clues and the Guardians must used these riddles to look for the scattered elemental stones. Endarno warned the Guardians that in order to capture these stones, they must face the Elemental Guards that stand and protect them. One by one, the girls were able to find the stones, and back in the bookstore, Cedric and Orube slowly fell deeply in love. However, the Guardians, Cedric, and Orube were sucked into the world of the book when Will refuses to surrender the Heart of Kandrakar. Cedric was later killed by Ludmoore and dissolved into ink when he tried to protect Orube from Ludmoore's deadly gaze. The Guardians later found Matt and managed to defeat Ludmoore once and for all (with Matt's help). While Orube mourns for Cedric's death Will's mother, Susan Vandom, married her history teacher, Dean Collins. Orube left and a magical portal in the shape of the Heart of Kandrakar later appeared in the basement of the \"Ye Olde Book Shop\".\n\n{{Graphic novel list/header\n|Language=Italian\n|SecondLanguage=English\n| WithTitle       = yes\n|Width=99%\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n| VolumeNumber    = 5\n| OriginalRelDate = April 2005\n| OriginalISBN    = \n| LicensedRelDate = July 2006\n| LicensedISBN    =\n| ChapterList     =\n* 49.

Karl tells Hay Lin about the Ragorlang, a monster that absorbs the thoughts, the voices, and the sounds of its victims. Coincidentally, a few students at Eric's school are getting inactive as if they had lost their youthful strength. The same evening, Hay Lin gets attacked by a Ragorlang and was saved just in time by the other Guardians. Soon they discover who's behind the new threat: Tecla Ibsen. She wanted to be young and beautiful again and used her magical ability to conjure up and control the Ragorlangs, ordering them to steal the youthful strength of the teenagers by absorbing their thoughts and voices. The Guardians managed to defeat her and her Ragorlang. Unfortunately, Tecla returns, but as a frail, older woman, who can't summon a fully grown Ragorlang. Tecla brainwashed a magical girl named Erin, making her believe that the Guardians are the Ragorlangs and that it was their fault that her brother, Kader, went missing. At first, Erin uses her magic to make the girls hate each other while posing as an exchange student. The Guardians eventually helped her find her brother despite their hate for her.\n\nThis saga also introduced a strange [[optometrist]], named Folkner, who stationed himself in Sheffield to monitor the students' health. The Guardians found out that he's a Ragorlang hunter who wishes to hunt down Tecla Ibsen. She later regain full power due to leaked magics from Kandrakar and attacked the Guardians with a new pact of Ragorlangs. Despite being able to use the Shadow Heart against the Guardians, she was defeated when the last of her Ragorlangs was absorbed into a box created by Folkner. Obsessed with the dark power, Folkner unleashed the powers and became a supreme Ragorlang himself. He was later killed by the Guardians and was sucked into his own Ragorlang box at the end of the saga, and Karl and Tecla were both accepted into the Congregation of Kandrakar after admitting their mistakes.\n\n{{Graphic novel list/header\n|Language=Italian\n|SecondLanguage=English\n| WithTitle       = yes\n|Width=99%\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n| VolumeNumber    = 6\n| OriginalRelDate = July 2006\n| OriginalISBN    =\n| LicensedRelDate = October 2007\n| LicensedISBN    =\n| ChapterList     =\n* 64.

She was once Queen Meter of Spring and made flowers bloom beneath her feet. But when she became corrupted, she transformed into \"the Dark Mother\" and attacked Kandrakar with a vengeance. She was ultimately defeated by the combined strength of the elemental Queens of [[Water (classical element)|Water]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]] and [[Air (classical element)|Air]] and was cast into the dark void where she continued to wait patiently in chains until she could be released. In silence, Dark Mother sent a seed and planted it deep within kandrakar, where it would serve as her infiltrator against the Fortress of Light.\n\nThe five Guardians of Kandrakar each receive further developed and considerably stronger Guardian powers over the five elements upon undergoing a vision-quest to unlock the very roots of their abilities as well as their highest potential. Wilhelmina \"Will\" Vamdom's own boyfriend, Matthew \"Matt\" Olsen, now serves as their new trainer and mentor after being recruited by the Oracle to prepare them for their upcoming battle against Dark Mother. One by one, the Guardians found the root of their elements and obtained full control over their new and much stronger abilities. Meanwhile, Dark Mother escaped (thanks to Will) and set off to take over Kandrakar. Thanks to her tree, which she had planted beforehand, Dark Mother enslaved the minds of Kandrakar, except for Yan Lin. The Guardians later faced her in one last battle and Dark Mother was sealed in a stone tomb. Oracle Himerish relinquished his place to the original Guardian of [[Air (classical element)|Air]], Yan Lin, who [[Omniscience|foresaw]] the incoming threat and departed without even saying goodbye.\n\n{{Graphic novel list/header\n|Language=Italian\n|SecondLanguage=English\n| WithTitle       = yes\n|Width=99%\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n| VolumeNumber    = 7\n| OriginalRelDate = June 2007\n| OriginalISBN    =\n| LicensedRelDate = September 2008\n| LicensedISBN    =\n| ChapterList     =\n* 75.

Van, a special on-the-road-school which houses five magical laboratories connected to each Guardians' elements, personalities, and skills. Kandor, a member of the Congregation is sent to be their new bus driver and care-taker. Meanwhile, a new enemy is watching their every move: Foreman Takeda the CEO and scientist of Takeshita Inc. Takeda vowed to destroy all magic because he believed that it is responsible for his daughter's illness. Mariko, his eldest daughter, discovered the Fast World and her mind now trapped there. Takeda enlisted the help of Liam, a mysterious boy that Mariko met in the Fast World and they fell in love, to spy on the Guardians and ordered him to kidnap Will's little brother. Using Liam and William as bait, Takeda lured the Guardians into his lair and used his cold technologies to trap the Guardians into the 'Fast World forever'. However, his plan was thwarted by his youngest daughter, Shinobu, who saw her father's cruelty and had him frozen by his own robotic minions.\n\nWhile looking for Liam and William in the Fast World, the Guardians encounter the malicious ruler Arkaam, the White Queen, who wished to rule all of the Fast World under her tyranny and possessed a deep desire to kill the Black Queen. It is revealed that the identity of the Black Queen is Mariko's conscious and Shinobu's sister. In the confusing of their escape, Liam was killed by the White Queen after she stabbed him with her sword. Although successful in bringing William back, Will and her friends are horrified that the White Queen and her army had followed them to their world. In their last battle, invading White Queen and her army were dissipated by the Guardians' powerful sound frequency.

At the same time, they must face several new enemies who wanted to destroy them. Many of these villains included the Runics, a group of five evil wizards who control the dark powers of the elements; and Nihila, the Queen of Darkness who desire to weave and control everyone's destinies with her magical Loom. The series also introduced new missions where the Guardians must assist the beings of the natural worlds; from listening to the voice of the Earth to helping Mareeve, the Saarineen, avoid marrying the King of the Sharks, Orristurr.

The Aurameres grant the same powers to each of their guardians; for instance, powers held by Irma would also have been possessed by Cassidy.\n\nWhen the Guardians transform, they change form and grow wings. The wings don't allow them to fly, except after they get the New Powers.\n\n[[Teleportation in fiction|Teleportation]] (renamed to '''Teletransportation''' in the [[W.I.T.C.H.

In the Fortress, the wisest of thousands of other planets and worlds are gathered to discuss the state of the worlds which are of their concern. They simply observe and do not interfere. The fifth and last Guardian is rightful Keeper of the mystical Heart of Candracar, an ancient and immensely powerful crystal orbicular pendant which gives the girls' their ability to transform into their taller, stronger and more elaborate Guardian costumes. Hay Lin's paternal grandmother lives here with the Oracle when she \"dies\" unexpectedly on Earth.\n\n=== Metamoor ===\nMetamoor is a world ruled by the Escanor, who originates from Earth. For a long time Metamoor, and its capital Meridian, was isolated from the rest of the universe because it was ruled by the evil prince Phobos. With help of the Guardians and the Meridian people the rightful heiress to the throne, Elyon, could reign again. Elyon is the last of the Escanor.\n\n=== Arkhanta ===\nArkhanta is an Earth-like world ruled by Ari. Ari accused the Oracle for not wanting to cure his son. Even the banshee Yua was unable to help him. With trickery, Ari could keep Yua in his scarlet citadel forever. Despite all this, Ari brought prosperity to his people. Knowing they had received everything thanks to the powers of Yua, the people are both happy and disturbed. Fortunately, after the Guardians released Yua and healed Ari's son Maqui, any threat of Yua's anger was over. On his turn Ari ended his hostility against Kandrakar.\n\n===Basil\u00edade===\nBasiliade is the home world of the Oracle (Himerish), Endarno, and Orube.

For this purpose, [[magic in fiction|magical powers]] over the five [[classical element]]s have been given to them. The new guardians are Will, Irma, Taranee, Cornelia, and Hay Lin, whose initials form the title acronym \"W.I.T.C.H.\".\n\nIn 2004, series creators Alessandro Barbucci and Barbara Canepa unsuccessfully sued Disney for the initial rights to ''W.I.T.C.H.'' after issues with management at the publishing company.<ref name=\"antonio\"/> As a result, Canepa founded her own comics company.<ref name=\"pw\"/>\n\n==Background and production==\nUpon seeing the success of ''[[PKNA|PKNA - Paperinik New Adventures]]'' with young male audiences, some of the same writers began thinking of a concept that would work for young female audiences. Elisabetta Gnone, Alessandro Barbucci and Barbara Canepa came up with the original concepts and designs. Gnone co-wrote the first issue of the series with Francesco Artibani.\n\nGnone and Artibani originally created a concept that would last nine issues, but upon seeing the impressive sales numbers, a further three issues were ordered, rounding out the 12-issue first saga.\n\nIn 2004, tensions arose between the ''W.I.T.C.H.'' artists and Disney's publishing (Buena Vista). Series creators Alessandro Barbucci and Barbara Canepa unsuccessfully sued Disney for the initial rights to ''W.I.T.C.H.'', and Francesco Artibani was a witness in support of the two artists in court. After the lawsuit failed, Artibani and other artists decided to end their working relationships with Disney due to the \"difficult management and company.\"<ref name=\"antonio\">https://antoniogenna.com/2013/03/25/disney-in-edicola-14-speciale-la-chiusura-di-w-i-t-c-h-con-interviste-a-francesco-artibani-e-teresa-radice/</ref> Around the same time, Disney filed an unsuccessful copyright infringement lawsuit against Rainbow SpA, the studio behind ''Winx Club'' (a series cited as the main competition for ''W.I.T.C.H.''). In its April 2004 suit, the corporation claimed the ''Winx Club'' concept copied that of ''W.I.T.C.H.''; all of their claims were rejected in August,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docplayer.it/docview/26/7619504/#file=/storage/26/7619504/7619504.pdf|title=I segni distintivi nella giurisprudenza|publisher=[[University of Macerata]]|date=2008|last=Gradozzi|first=Francesco|language=it}}</ref> and Rainbow SpA won the case against Disney as they provided proof that the ''Winx Club'' production began before the ''W.I.T.C.H.'' comic was available.<ref>{{cite interview|url=https://www.comicus.it/mainmenu-interviste/item/46207-intervista-a-francesco-artibani|last=Artibani|first=Francesco|title=Intervista a Francesco Artibani|work=Comicus|date=9 April 2006|language=it}}</ref>\n\nAfter breaking off with Buena Vista and in the middle of her trial against them, Barbara Canepa created her own comic book company, Sky Doll. She described it as a way to become \"more sincere and uncensored\" with her comics. Sky Doll was unable to secure the rights to ''W.I.T.C.H.'' from Disney so instead focused on original projects.<ref name=\"pw\">https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/14783-french-publisher-soleil-finds-success-at-marvel.html</ref> Canepa stated that she intends to keep all the rights to her comics; she said, \"After my experience with Disney, it's important for me to protect myself.\"<ref name=\"pw\"/>\n\n==Comics==\n=== Part I: The Twelve Portals ===\nThe first saga introduced a world called Metamoor, ruled by a tyrannical ruler named [[Phobos (W.I.T.C.H.)|Prince Phobos]]. Years ago, Prince Phobos caused the disappearances of his parents and took over the capital city, Meridian. To prevent his spreading tyranny, the Oracle lowered a veil over the planet, separating Metamoor from the rest of the worlds under Kandrakar's protection. However, twelve portals opened between Meridian and Earth, creating a series of passageways for the desperate refugees and monsters of Meridian to infiltrate Earth. The portals also weaken the veil and in order to prevent this, generations of Guardians were sent to protect it from collapsing. In the present day, five girls are chosen to become the new Guardians: Will Vandom, the Guardian of Energy and the Keeper of the Heart, making her the leader; Irma Lair, the new Guardian of Water; Taranee Cook, the Guardian of Fire; Cornelia Hale, the Guardian of Earth; and Hay Lin, the Guardian of Air. Together, they must prevent the collapse of the veil and promote justice throughout the universe under the guidance of the Oracle of Kandrakar.\n\nThe first saga also introduced [[Elyon Brown]], a childhood friend of Cornelia. The Guardians' first mission was to close the twelve portals, but as they found out for themselves, Elyon had betrayed them. It is revealed that Elyon is Prince Phobos's younger sister who had disappeared from Meridian more than a decade ago. After Prince Phobos's right-hand man, Lord Cedric, revealed Elyon of her true alien heritage, he manipulated her into thinking that the Guardians were her enemies. The Guardians had to find a way to defeat Prince Phobos and bring Elyon back home. In Meridian, however, there is a rebellion taking place led by [[Caleb (W.I.T.C.H.)|Caleb]], whom Cornelia had seen in her dreams for years. They sought to overthrow Prince Phobos and put Elyon on the throne, as she is the legitimate ruler. The Guardians later worked together with the rebels and eventually, Elyon realized her mistake for trusting Lord Cedric. Prince Phobos had planned to absorb his sister's powers for himself during her coronation, but with the Guardians' help Elyon escaped and later battled against him for the crown. The final battle was successful, but not without some losses. Prince Phobos transformed Caleb back into a crystal flower, his most primitive form as a Murmurer. This devastated Cornelia greatly to the point where it would haunt her in the next series. As Elyon is crowned Queen and the Light of Meridian, the world of Metamoor is finally liberated. The Oracle lifted the veil off of Metamoor and light shines on the world once again. Both Prince Phobos and Cedric are imprisoned in the Tower of Mist.\n\n{{Graphic novel list/header\n|Language=Italian\n|SecondLanguage=English\n| WithTitle       = yes\n|Width=99%\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n| VolumeNumber    = 1\n| OriginalRelDate = April 2001\n| OriginalISBN    = \n| LicensedRelDate = July 2002\n| LicensedISBN    =\n| ChapterList     =\n* 1.

When the Oracle realized how the immense power of the Heart was corrupting Nerissa, he took it away from her and gave it to [[C.H.Y.K.N.|Cassidy]], the former Guardian of Water. Obsessed with her lost power and blinded by jealousy, Nerissa tricked Cassidy and killed her. As punishment, Nerissa was stripped of her magic and sentenced to sleep, alone and friendless, in Mount Thanos for an eternity, only until all [[Classical elements in popular culture|five elements]]-[[Water (classical element)|Water]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], Earth, [[Air (classical element)|Air]] and [[Aether (classical element)|Pure/Absolute Energy]]- united into one single being. \n\nWhen Cornelia accidentally, and unknowingly, absorbed all five elements into herself, the seal on Nerissa's tomb broke, setting her free. When Caleb is kidnapped, the Guardians must face Nerissa along with her four Knights of Vengeance. While successful in their rescue mission, they end up losing Luba who sacrificed herself to save them. Hoping to steal the Heart she craved for so long, Nerissa later attacked the girls through their dreams in order to weaken them but failed. She was later successful in stealing the Heart back by tricking Will into giving it to her. \n\nWith the very symbol and essence of Kandrakar itself now entirely corrupted by Nerissa's hatred and vengeance, the former Guardian leader and her Knights of Vengeance attacked the sacred Temple of Kandrakar itself. Will later acquired the Star of Cassidy, a copy of the mystical Heart from the spirit/ghost of Cassidy, the late and original Guardian of [[Water (classical element)|Water]]. With it, Will and her fellow Guardians faced Nerissa in Kandrakar. In the final battle, Nerissa was ultimately destroyed by the combined strength of the second generation of Guardians. Despite their victory, Cornelia is deeply heartbroken when Caleb left her due to their complicated relationship.\n\n{{Graphic novel list/header\n|Language=Italian\n|SecondLanguage=English\n| WithTitle       = yes\n|Width=99%\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n| VolumeNumber    = 2\n| OriginalRelDate = April 2002\n| OriginalISBN    = \n| LicensedRelDate = July 2003\n| LicensedISBN    =\n| ChapterList     =\n* 13.

Will's father, Thomas Vandom, returns into her life after years of absence, and his intentions are anything but loving and trustful. Later, [[Taranee Cook|Taranee]] went on strike because she felt that the Oracle is using them to carry out his missions and sentences. A new character, Orube, joins the remaining Guardians on their new mission to defeat a new enemy; [[List of W.I.T.C.H. characters#Part III villains|Ari]], the powerful lord of Arkhanta and they must prevent him from rising and destroying the Oracle. Ari's son, Maqi, suffered from a strange disorder since birth and the Oracle had refused to help Ari cure his son. Angered and blinded by rage, Ari captured a [[banshee]], named Yua, and tried to use her wish-granting power to oppose the Oracle and Kandrakar (but it could not be done). The longer Yua was held prisoner and serving as Ari's slave, the more powerful Ari becomes, and soon, he would have enough power to overthrow the Oracle. \n\nTaranee later rejoined the quintet and together, they were able to defeat Ari and set Yua free. Liberated, Yua kidnapped Maqi because she wanted Ari to suffer for holding her imprisoned for many years against her will. Ari and the Guardians followed her into the swamp where she and her banshee sisters live and fought them to bring Maqi back. However, Maqi was nearly killed during the confusion of the battle. He was later saved and cured when the Guardians and Orube offered their magical, elemental gifts from the nymph Xin Jing herself to him.\n\nAlthough their missions on the world Arkhanta was successful, the girls have a whole bunch of new problems on Earth that needs their attention: Interpol discovers the secret of the five Guardians' and wants to capture them and use their astounding abilities as Guardians of Kandrakar for their dark intentions. As if that was not enough, the girls' [[Astral Drop]]s decide to rebel after months of being taken advantage of by the Guardians. The Astral Drops started to cause numerous problems between the Guardians' families, teachers, and individual boyfriends' and eventually they ran away to another city. The Guardians later recaptured the Astral Drops and decided to liberate them from slavery by sending to another city entirely.\n\n{{Graphic novel list/header\n|Language=Italian\n|SecondLanguage=English\n| WithTitle       = yes\n|Width=99%\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n| VolumeNumber    = 3\n| OriginalRelDate = April 2003\n| OriginalISBN    = \n| LicensedRelDate = July 2004\n| LicensedISBN    =\n| ChapterList     =\n* 25.

The Guardians are called in to recall his recent unsatisfactory deeds and he was later found guilty by Endarno and was banished back into his home world, [[Basil\u00edade]]. Back home in [[Heatherfield]], [[Will Vandom|Will]] confronted Orube and [[List of W.I.T.C.H. characters#Boys|Matt]], while Principal Knickerbocker goes to drastic measures to raise the girls' grades at [[Sheffield]]. In Kandrakar, the Council has elected Endarno the new Oracle. After Endarno has been chosen, he makes the life of the Guardians difficult by trying to prove to the Congregation that they are too young and immature. He also convinced the Congregation that [[Elyon Brown|Elyon]], the queen and the Light of Meridian, is dangerous and unfit to rule over Metamoor. Many times he tried to get the Guardians to arrest their old friend and bring him the Crown of Light. But W.I.T.C.H. managed to hide Elyon from Endarno by smuggling her back to Earth and had Orube protect her. Moreover, Endarno is someone else than he appears to be...an old enemy coming back for revenge and an even bigger thirst for more power. \nElyon and [[Yan Lin]] discovered that \"Endarno\" is actually the consciousness and evil will of Prince Phobos, who has been using the physical self of the true Endarno, in his new quest for power and revenge.\n\nQueen Elyon then wields her vital life energy to Yan Lin, who then gives it to Will to hide within the Heart of Kandrakar for safeguarding. The Guardians were able locate the old Oracle, now called Himerish, upon the discovery of his old identity before leaving for Kandrakar, with the help of Orube. Together, they tried to free Elyon from her prison and put a stop to Cedric and Phobos before Endarno (Phobos) is formally instated as the Oracle. In the end, Himerish was able to locate the real Endarno and he, in turn, revealed to the Council that the Endarno that they knew was, in actuality, the malicious Prince Phobos' mind and spirit in his body. Elyon returned to power on her world of Meridian, Cedric was back in the Tower of Mist, and Prince Phobos, rather than being locked up in prison again, threw himself into the endless void of Kandrakar. \n\n{{Graphic novel list/header\n|Language=Italian\n|SecondLanguage=English\n| WithTitle       = yes\n|Width=99%\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n| VolumeNumber    = 4\n| OriginalRelDate = April 2004\n| OriginalISBN    = \n| LicensedRelDate = July 2005\n| LicensedISBN    =\n| ChapterList     =\n* 37.

Each Guardian has discovered new and much stronger abilities, yet their elemental abilities are going out of control. Even the Triumvirate of Kandrakar does not have full understanding about it. At the same time, Cedric is disposed of his magical strength and power and gets a second chance from the Oracle. He returns to \"Ye Olde Book Shop\" to live a decent life, under supervision from the Guardians. Nevertheless, he searches for a useful resource to regain his powers in hopes of getting revenge on the Guardians. He finds his luck in the Book of Elements, written by Jonathan Ludmoore (which the Guardians later found out). About a century before, Jonathan Ludmoore was an [[alchemist]] who came from Metamoor and it was Prince Phobos who had sent him to Heatherfield in order to open the Twelve Portals. After completing his mission, Ludmoore discovered that the city is a place where all five elements\u2014[[Water (classical element)|Water]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Air (classical element)|Air]], [[Quintessence (classical element)|Quintessence]]\u2014met and stayed. He experimented on the elements but it trapped Ludmoore in his own book and released all five elemental stones throughout the city.\n\nAfter Matt was swallowed by the Book of Elements (thanks to Cedric), the Guardians must cooperate with Cedric in order to save Matt. The book gives them riddles as clues and the Guardians must used these riddles to look for the scattered elemental stones. Endarno warned the Guardians that in order to capture these stones, they must face the Elemental Guards that stand and protect them. One by one, the girls were able to find the stones, and back in the bookstore, Cedric and Orube slowly fell deeply in love. However, the Guardians, Cedric, and Orube were sucked into the world of the book when Will refuses to surrender the Heart of Kandrakar. Cedric was later killed by Ludmoore and dissolved into ink when he tried to protect Orube from Ludmoore's deadly gaze. The Guardians later found Matt and managed to defeat Ludmoore once and for all (with Matt's help). While Orube mourns for Cedric's death Will's mother, Susan Vandom, married her history teacher, Dean Collins. Orube left and a magical portal in the shape of the Heart of Kandrakar later appeared in the basement of the \"Ye Olde Book Shop\".\n\n{{Graphic novel list/header\n|Language=Italian\n|SecondLanguage=English\n| WithTitle       = yes\n|Width=99%\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n| VolumeNumber    = 5\n| OriginalRelDate = April 2005\n| OriginalISBN    = \n| LicensedRelDate = July 2006\n| LicensedISBN    =\n| ChapterList     =\n* 49.

Karl tells Hay Lin about the Ragorlang, a monster that absorbs the thoughts, the voices, and the sounds of its victims. Coincidentally, a few students at Eric's school are getting inactive as if they had lost their youthful strength. The same evening, Hay Lin gets attacked by a Ragorlang and was saved just in time by the other Guardians. Soon they discover who's behind the new threat: Tecla Ibsen. She wanted to be young and beautiful again and used her magical ability to conjure up and control the Ragorlangs, ordering them to steal the youthful strength of the teenagers by absorbing their thoughts and voices. The Guardians managed to defeat her and her Ragorlang. Unfortunately, Tecla returns, but as a frail, older woman, who can't summon a fully grown Ragorlang. Tecla brainwashed a magical girl named Erin, making her believe that the Guardians are the Ragorlangs and that it was their fault that her brother, Kader, went missing. At first, Erin uses her magic to make the girls hate each other while posing as an exchange student. The Guardians eventually helped her find her brother despite their hate for her.\n\nThis saga also introduced a strange [[optometrist]], named Folkner, who stationed himself in Sheffield to monitor the students' health. The Guardians found out that he's a Ragorlang hunter who wishes to hunt down Tecla Ibsen. She later regain full power due to leaked magics from Kandrakar and attacked the Guardians with a new pact of Ragorlangs. Despite being able to use the Shadow Heart against the Guardians, she was defeated when the last of her Ragorlangs was absorbed into a box created by Folkner. Obsessed with the dark power, Folkner unleashed the powers and became a supreme Ragorlang himself. He was later killed by the Guardians and was sucked into his own Ragorlang box at the end of the saga, and Karl and Tecla were both accepted into the Congregation of Kandrakar after admitting their mistakes.\n\n{{Graphic novel list/header\n|Language=Italian\n|SecondLanguage=English\n| WithTitle       = yes\n|Width=99%\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n| VolumeNumber    = 6\n| OriginalRelDate = July 2006\n| OriginalISBN    =\n| LicensedRelDate = October 2007\n| LicensedISBN    =\n| ChapterList     =\n* 64.

She was once Queen Meter of Spring and made flowers bloom beneath her feet. But when she became corrupted, she transformed into \"the Dark Mother\" and attacked Kandrakar with a vengeance. She was ultimately defeated by the combined strength of the elemental Queens of [[Water (classical element)|Water]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]] and [[Air (classical element)|Air]] and was cast into the dark void where she continued to wait patiently in chains until she could be released. In silence, Dark Mother sent a seed and planted it deep within kandrakar, where it would serve as her infiltrator against the Fortress of Light.\n\nThe five Guardians of Kandrakar each receive further developed and considerably stronger Guardian powers over the five elements upon undergoing a vision-quest to unlock the very roots of their abilities as well as their highest potential. Wilhelmina \"Will\" Vamdom's own boyfriend, Matthew \"Matt\" Olsen, now serves as their new trainer and mentor after being recruited by the Oracle to prepare them for their upcoming battle against Dark Mother. One by one, the Guardians found the root of their elements and obtained full control over their new and much stronger abilities. Meanwhile, Dark Mother escaped (thanks to Will) and set off to take over Kandrakar. Thanks to her tree, which she had planted beforehand, Dark Mother enslaved the minds of Kandrakar, except for Yan Lin. The Guardians later faced her in one last battle and Dark Mother was sealed in a stone tomb. Oracle Himerish relinquished his place to the original Guardian of [[Air (classical element)|Air]], Yan Lin, who [[Omniscience|foresaw]] the incoming threat and departed without even saying goodbye.\n\n{{Graphic novel list/header\n|Language=Italian\n|SecondLanguage=English\n| WithTitle       = yes\n|Width=99%\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n| VolumeNumber    = 7\n| OriginalRelDate = June 2007\n| OriginalISBN    =\n| LicensedRelDate = September 2008\n| LicensedISBN    =\n| ChapterList     =\n* 75.

Oracle Yan Lin assisted them by giving them new weapons to help greatly strengthen and magnify their powers and abilities as well as the key to the W.I.T.C.H. Van, a special on-the-road-school which houses five magical laboratories connected to each Guardians' elements, personalities, and skills. Kandor, a member of the Congregation is sent to be their new bus driver and care-taker. Meanwhile, a new enemy is watching their every move: Foreman Takeda the CEO and scientist of Takeshita Inc. Takeda vowed to destroy all magic because he believed that it is responsible for his daughter's illness. Mariko, his eldest daughter, discovered the Fast World and her mind now trapped there. Takeda enlisted the help of Liam, a mysterious boy that Mariko met in the Fast World and they fell in love, to spy on the Guardians and ordered him to kidnap Will's little brother. Using Liam and William as bait, Takeda lured the Guardians into his lair and used his cold technologies to trap the Guardians into the 'Fast World forever'. However, his plan was thwarted by his youngest daughter, Shinobu, who saw her father's cruelty and had him frozen by his own robotic minions.\n\nWhile looking for Liam and William in the Fast World, the Guardians encounter the malicious ruler Arkaam, the White Queen, who wished to rule all of the Fast World under her tyranny and possessed a deep desire to kill the Black Queen. It is revealed that the identity of the Black Queen is Mariko's conscious and Shinobu's sister. In the confusing of their escape, Liam was killed by the White Queen after she stabbed him with her sword. Although successful in bringing William back, Will and her friends are horrified that the White Queen and her army had followed them to their world. In their last battle, invading White Queen and her army were dissipated by the Guardians' powerful sound frequency. After hearing Mariko's accusation and Shinobu's forgiveness, Takeda forgot his vendetta and rejoined his family.\n\n* Beginning from issue #97 onward, most W.I.T.C.H. comic issue is its own story.\n\n{{Graphic novel list/header\n|Language=Italian\n|SecondLanguage=English\n| WithTitle       = yes\n|Width=99%\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n| VolumeNumber    = 8\n| OriginalRelDate = June 2008\n| OriginalISBN    =\n| LicensedRelDate = September 2009\n| LicensedISBN    =\n| ChapterList     =\n* 87.

The Guardians now face their daily problems from families, friends, and school. The stories ranged from facing their first day of returning to Sheffield Institute to finding out more about both of their parents' pasts and abilities. At the same time, they must face several new enemies who wanted to destroy them. Many of these villains included the Runics, a group of five evil wizards who control the dark powers of the elements; and Nihila, the Queen of Darkness who desire to weave and control everyone's destinies with her magical Loom. The series also introduced new missions where the Guardians must assist the beings of the natural worlds; from listening to the voice of the Earth to helping Mareeve, the Saarineen, avoid marrying the King of the Sharks, Orristurr. Later on, the stories ranged from Dean's parents returning to Hay Lin and her family celebrating Chinese New Year.\n\n{{Graphic novel list/header\n|Language=Italian\n|SecondLanguage=English\n| WithTitle       = yes\n|Width=99%\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n| VolumeNumber    = 9\n| OriginalRelDate = July 2009\n| OriginalISBN    = \n| LicensedRelDate = October 2010\n| LicensedISBN    =\n| ChapterList     =\n* 100. 100% Witch\n* 101.

The Aurameres grant the same powers to each of their guardians; for instance, powers held by Irma would also have been possessed by Cassidy.\n\nWhen the Guardians transform, they change form and grow wings. The wings don't allow them to fly, except after they get the New Powers.\n\n[[Teleportation in fiction|Teleportation]] (renamed to '''Teletransportation''' in the [[W.I.T.C.H. (TV series)|animated show's second season]]) can be performed from one spot to another on Earth as well as teletransporting from world to world via long-distance.\n* Irma and Cassidy control and manipulate the element of [[Water (classical element)|Water]]\n* Taranee and Halinor control and manipulate the element of [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]]\n* Cornelia and Kadma control and manipulate the element of [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]]\n* Hay Lin and Yan Lin control and manipulate the element of [[Air (classical element)|Air]]\n* Will and Nerissa control and manipulate the element of Energy (replaced by [[Quintessence (classical element)|Aether/Quintessence]] in TV show)\n\n== Setting ==\n\n=== Heatherfield ===\nLocated on Earth, this city is the home of the five Guardians.\n\n===Kandrakar===\nA sacred, ethereal, spiritual world in the very center of the entire universe itself, where time and space do not exist. In the Fortress, the wisest of thousands of other planets and worlds are gathered to discuss the state of the worlds which are of their concern. They simply observe and do not interfere. The fifth and last Guardian is rightful Keeper of the mystical Heart of Candracar, an ancient and immensely powerful crystal orbicular pendant which gives the girls' their ability to transform into their taller, stronger and more elaborate Guardian costumes. Hay Lin's paternal grandmother lives here with the Oracle when she \"dies\" unexpectedly on Earth.\n\n=== Metamoor ===\nMetamoor is a world ruled by the Escanor, who originates from Earth. For a long time Metamoor, and its capital Meridian, was isolated from the rest of the universe because it was ruled by the evil prince Phobos. With help of the Guardians and the Meridian people the rightful heiress to the throne, Elyon, could reign again. Elyon is the last of the Escanor.\n\n=== Arkhanta ===\nArkhanta is an Earth-like world ruled by Ari. Ari accused the Oracle for not wanting to cure his son. Even the banshee Yua was unable to help him. With trickery, Ari could keep Yua in his scarlet citadel forever. Despite all this, Ari brought prosperity to his people. Knowing they had received everything thanks to the powers of Yua, the people are both happy and disturbed. Fortunately, after the Guardians released Yua and healed Ari's son Maqui, any threat of Yua's anger was over. On his turn Ari ended his hostility against Kandrakar.\n\n===Basil\u00edade===\nBasiliade is the home world of the Oracle (Himerish), Endarno, and Orube. It makes up part of a binary solar system.\n\n==Other printed media==\nAfter the success of the 2001 release of the W.I.T.C.H. comic magazines, [[Disney Publishing Worldwide]] expanded the W.I.T.C.H. franchise to magazines, video and mobile games and a website.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Disney Publishing Worldwide|url=https://enterpriseportal.disney.com/gopublish/sitemedia/dcp/Home/Our%20Businesses/us_lob_dpw_fact_sheet_021009.pdf|publisher=Disney Publishing Worldwide|accessdate=16 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Chapter books===\nThe ''W.I.T.C.H.'' book series consists of twenty-six books, all adapted from the comic series by either Elizabeth Lenhard or Alice Alfonsi, but have entirely different titles than those of the graphic novel series.
