Sir William Stanhope''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KB}} (1702\u201372), of [[Eythrope]], [[Buckinghamshire]], was an English landowner and opposition Whig politician,  who sat in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] for 35 years between 1727 and 1768. Afflicted with deafness and ill-health, he travelled frequently and was often absent from Parliament.\n\n==Early life==\nStanhope was the second son of [[Philip Stanhope, 3rd Earl of Chesterfield]] and his wife [[Elizabeth Stanhope, Countess of Chesterfield (d. 1708)|Lady Elizabeth Savile]], daughter of the [[George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax|Marquess of Halifax]].  He was the brother of [[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Philip Dormer, Lord Stanhope]] Hon. Charles Stanhope, and Hon. John Stanhope. He married Susanna Rudge, daughter of John Rudge of Wheatfield, Oxfordshire on 27 April 1721. On this marriage, his father settled upon him the Buckinghamshire estates of the Dormer family, worth \u00a38,000 a year. He was appointed [[Order of the Bath|Knight Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1725.\n\n==Career==\nStanhope  stood for parliament at a by-election at [[Hertford (UK Parliament constituency)|Hertford]] on 23 January 1727, but was unsuccessful. Three days later on 26 January 1727 he was returned unopposed as [[Member of Parliament]] (MP)  for  a government seat at [[Lostwithiel (UK Parliament constituency)|Lostwithiel]].  At the [[1727 British general election]] he was returned as MP for [[Buckinghamshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Buckinghamshire]] and [[Aylesbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Aylesbury]], and chose to sit for Buckinghamshire.  There is no record of any votes by him before 1732. Then, like his brothers, he was a member of the Whig Opposition and he voted regularly against the Administration. He was returned again as MP for Buckinghamshire in a contest at the  [[1734 British general election]],  He attended  the court of [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]]. As  the Prince's mistress, Lady Archibald Hamilton, had filled the court with her relations,  Stanhope one day addressed all the people he did not know there as Mr or Mrs  Hamilton, whereupon he was given to understand that his presence there was not \u2018quite agreeable\u2019. Stanhope's first wife Susanna died on 7 October 1740 and he did not stand at the [[1741 British general election]].<ref name=HOP>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1715-1754/member/stanhope-hon-sir-william-1702-72|title=STANHOPE,  Hon.

In 1748 he attacked the Grenvilles  over a bill  to transfer the summer assizes from Aylesbury to Buckingham.

He married Anne Hussey Delaval, daughter of [[Francis Blake Delaval (1692\u20131752)|Francis Blake Delaval]] as his third wife on 6 October 1759.  Chesterfield wrote that  by God\u2019s good providence he found out a young woman of a retired disposition, and who had been bred up prudently under an old grandmother in the country; she hated and dreaded a London life, and chose to amuse herself at home with her books, her drawing, and her music. Stanhope was returned  unopposed again at the [[1761 British general election]]. He left England again for Italy shortly afterwards but the marriage did not survive the journey. Horace Walpole wrote to Mann \u2018We sent you Sir William Stanhope and my Lady, a fond couple; you have returned them to us very different. When they came to Blackheath, he made her a low bow and said, \u2018Madam, I hope I shall never see your face again.\u2019 She replied, \u2018Sir, I will take all the care that you never shall.\u2019 A separation was mediated by Lord Chesterfield. Stanhope  was  almost completely deaf by this time and was increasingly absent from Parliament. He voted against Government over Wilkes on 15 November 1763, and over general warrants on 18 February 1764.  He then went abroad again and was at Naples in May 1765, on friendly terms with Wilkes..

He was voted \"best British crossword setter\" in a poll of crossword setters conducted by ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' in 1991 and in the same year was chosen as \"the crossword compilers' crossword compiler\" in ''The Observer Magazine'' \"Experts' Expert\" feature.<ref name=crowther>Jonathan Crowther (2006) ''A-Z of Crosswords'' pp. 44\u201346, Collins {{ISBN|978-0-00-722923-9}}, {{ISBN|0-00-722923-2}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nHe was born in Liverpool on 24 September 1942, the son of a doctor, and grew up in Kirkby Lonsdale in the [[Lake District]].  He was educated at [[Rugby School]] before going on to read classics and classical philology at [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]].  From there, in 1964, he joined [[Oxford University Press]] and he worked for them, in [[India]], London, and [[Oxford]], until his retirement in early 2000. His final position was as a lexicographer writing dictionaries for foreign students of English. Married with two sons, he lives in Oxford.<ref>[http://www.crossword.org.uk/azed.htm The Crossword Centre]</ref>\n\nEncouraged by his father, Jonathan enjoyed solving crosswords from an early age.<ref name=crowther/> He caught the [[Derrick Somerset Macnutt|Ximenes]] bug while still at Rugby and \"just lived for Sundays\" thereafter.<ref name=timeshift>Jonathan Crowther in ''Timeshift: \"How to solve a cryptic crossword\"'', BBC4 Nov 2008</ref>  His first puzzles to be published were in the university weekly, [[Varsity (Cambridge)|''Varsity'']], under the pseudonym Gong and after leaving university he started submitting to ''[[The Listener (magazine)#Crossword|The Listener]]''. They published sixteen Gong puzzles between June 1965 and February 1972.<ref>[http://www.listenercrossword.com/HTML/Puzzles.html Listener website: List of  puzzles]</ref> He continued to be a Ximenes competitor until Ximenes' death in 1971.<ref name=crowther/>\n\nAppointed as Ximenes' successor, he cast around for a new pseudonym.  His two predecessors had taken theirs from Spanish [http://libro.uca.edu/lea1/append2.htm inquisitors-general] but none of the names remaining seemed suitably impressive.<ref name=timeshift/> However, reversing the last name of one, [[Diego Deza|Diego de Deza]], gives ([[Z#Name and pronunciation|to British ears at least]]) the first and last letters of the alphabet. Letter manipulation and word reversal are integral parts of a cryptic crossword: thus Azed was born.  Azed No. 1 appeared in ''The Observer'' in March 1972 and monthly [[Azed#The competition|clue-writing competitions]] \u00e0 la Ximenes resumed.  These still continue and in the monthly [[Azed#The slip|\"slip\"]], he gives details of each competition and discusses points of technique and more general interest relating to his puzzles. He relishes the dialogue the competitions generate and many regular solvers have become his friends.<ref name=crowther/> Among the technical comments can sometimes be found glimpses into his private life \u2013 he is very interested in cricket and less so in football \u2026 he took part in a performance of [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn's]] ''[[Nelson Mass]]'' at [[Radley College]] \u2026 one of his sons is a rock musician.<ref>[http://www.andlit.org.uk/azed/buildslip_param.php?comp_no=1737 Azed Slip No 1737]</ref><ref>[http://www.andlit.org.uk/azed/buildslip_param.php?comp_no=1741 Azed Slip No 1741]</ref><ref>[http://www.andlit.org.uk/azed/buildslip_param.php?comp_no=1700 Azed Slip No 1700]</ref> Interesting in their own right, these snippets are seized on by the more cunning competitors as ways to make their clues more appealing to the judge and so increase their chances of success.\n\n==Tastes and Technique==\nProudly Ximenean in his crossword philosophy, he favours puzzles whose setters have similar ideas (Dimitry, [[Don Manley|Duck]] and Phi, for example). Though he may not always approve of some accompanying clues, he praises the ingenuity of construction of the specialised thematic crosswords in the ''Times Listener'' series, the ''Crossword Club'' magazine, and ''1 Across''.<ref name=crowther/> He himself is responsible for a number of the  \"special\" formats which have appeared regularly in the Azed series.  These include ''Cherchez la Femme'',<ref>[http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2008/06/19/1882june22.pdf ''Cherchez La Femme'']</ref> ''Eightsome Reels'',<ref>[http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2006/05/19/azed_1773.pdf ''Eightsome Reels'']</ref>  ''Give and Take'',<ref>[http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Observer/documents/2007/08/31/azed1840.pdf  ''Give and Take'']</ref>   ''Overlaps'',<ref>[http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Observer/documents/2007/07/20/1834_july22.pdf ''Overlaps'']</ref> and ''Spoonerisms''.<ref>[http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2008/02/01/Azed03022008.pdf''Spoonerisms'']</ref> Ideas such for specials may strike him anywhere but [[Thames]]-side walks with his dog have been specially productive.<ref name=crowther/>\n\nHis methods of crossword composition are traditional.  Many setters use computer programs to fill in one of the standardised grids imposed on them by their newspapers but Azed does not.   ''The Observer'' has always allowed him freedom in construction and he strives to make interesting and varied diagrams.<ref>[http://www.andlit.org.uk/azed/buildslip_param.php?comp_no=1698 Azed Slip No 1698]</ref> The grid comes first, drawn in pencil in an exercise book with squared paper.  Then the bars at the end of each word are inked in for clarity.  Then he chooses his words.  ''[[Chambers Dictionary|The Chambers Dictionary]]'' is consulted, together with ''Chambers WORDS'' and ''Chambers BACKWORDS'' to find combinations that will fit into the grid. Finally, the clues are composed in the order that the words appear in the grid, starting with the first Across clue.  He deliberately avoids tackling the most interesting-looking words first.  He feels that to do that leaves a morass of drab-looking words at the end, quite likely receiving lifeless clues to match. When cluing, ''Chambers Thesaurus'' is a standard aid, assisted by a wide variety of reference books (many now out of print) which he has accumulated over the years.

He was voted \"best British crossword setter\" in a poll of crossword setters conducted by ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' in 1991 and in the same year was chosen as \"the crossword compilers' crossword compiler\" in ''The Observer Magazine'' \"Experts' Expert\" feature.<ref name=crowther>Jonathan Crowther (2006) ''A-Z of Crosswords'' pp. 44\u201346, Collins {{ISBN|978-0-00-722923-9}}, {{ISBN|0-00-722923-2}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nHe was born in Liverpool on 24 September 1942, the son of a doctor, and grew up in Kirkby Lonsdale in the [[Lake District]].  He was educated at [[Rugby School]] before going on to read classics and classical philology at [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]].  From there, in 1964, he joined [[Oxford University Press]] and he worked for them, in [[India]], London, and [[Oxford]], until his retirement in early 2000. His final position was as a lexicographer writing dictionaries for foreign students of English. Married with two sons, he lives in Oxford.<ref>[http://www.crossword.org.uk/azed.htm The Crossword Centre]</ref>\n\nEncouraged by his father, Jonathan enjoyed solving crosswords from an early age.<ref name=crowther/> He caught the [[Derrick Somerset Macnutt|Ximenes]] bug while still at Rugby and \"just lived for Sundays\" thereafter.<ref name=timeshift>Jonathan Crowther in ''Timeshift: \"How to solve a cryptic crossword\"'', BBC4 Nov 2008</ref>  His first puzzles to be published were in the university weekly, [[Varsity (Cambridge)|''Varsity'']], under the pseudonym Gong and after leaving university he started submitting to ''[[The Listener (magazine)#Crossword|The Listener]]''. They published sixteen Gong puzzles between June 1965 and February 1972.<ref>[http://www.listenercrossword.com/HTML/Puzzles.html Listener website: List of  puzzles]</ref> He continued to be a Ximenes competitor until Ximenes' death in 1971.<ref name=crowther/>\n\nAppointed as Ximenes' successor, he cast around for a new pseudonym.  His two predecessors had taken theirs from Spanish [http://libro.uca.edu/lea1/append2.htm inquisitors-general] but none of the names remaining seemed suitably impressive.<ref name=timeshift/> However, reversing the last name of one, [[Diego Deza|Diego de Deza]], gives ([[Z#Name and pronunciation|to British ears at least]]) the first and last letters of the alphabet. Letter manipulation and word reversal are integral parts of a cryptic crossword: thus Azed was born.  Azed No. 1 appeared in ''The Observer'' in March 1972 and monthly [[Azed#The competition|clue-writing competitions]] \u00e0 la Ximenes resumed.  These still continue and in the monthly [[Azed#The slip|\"slip\"]], he gives details of each competition and discusses points of technique and more general interest relating to his puzzles. He relishes the dialogue the competitions generate and many regular solvers have become his friends.<ref name=crowther/> Among the technical comments can sometimes be found glimpses into his private life \u2013 he is very interested in cricket and less so in football \u2026 he took part in a performance of [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn's]] ''[[Nelson Mass]]'' at [[Radley College]] \u2026 one of his sons is a rock musician.<ref>[http://www.andlit.org.uk/azed/buildslip_param.php?comp_no=1737 Azed Slip No 1737]</ref><ref>[http://www.andlit.org.uk/azed/buildslip_param.php?comp_no=1741 Azed Slip No 1741]</ref><ref>[http://www.andlit.org.uk/azed/buildslip_param.php?comp_no=1700 Azed Slip No 1700]</ref> Interesting in their own right, these snippets are seized on by the more cunning competitors as ways to make their clues more appealing to the judge and so increase their chances of success.\n\n==Tastes and Technique==\nProudly Ximenean in his crossword philosophy, he favours puzzles whose setters have similar ideas (Dimitry, [[Don Manley|Duck]] and Phi, for example). Though he may not always approve of some accompanying clues, he praises the ingenuity of construction of the specialised thematic crosswords in the ''Times Listener'' series, the ''Crossword Club'' magazine, and ''1 Across''.<ref name=crowther/> He himself is responsible for a number of the  \"special\" formats which have appeared regularly in the Azed series.  These include ''Cherchez la Femme'',<ref>[http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2008/06/19/1882june22.pdf ''Cherchez La Femme'']</ref> ''Eightsome Reels'',<ref>[http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2006/05/19/azed_1773.pdf ''Eightsome Reels'']</ref>  ''Give and Take'',<ref>[http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Observer/documents/2007/08/31/azed1840.pdf  ''Give and Take'']</ref>   ''Overlaps'',<ref>[http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Observer/documents/2007/07/20/1834_july22.pdf ''Overlaps'']</ref> and ''Spoonerisms''.<ref>[http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2008/02/01/Azed03022008.pdf''Spoonerisms'']</ref> Ideas such for specials may strike him anywhere but [[Thames]]-side walks with his dog have been specially productive.<ref name=crowther/>\n\nHis methods of crossword composition are traditional.  Many setters use computer programs to fill in one of the standardised grids imposed on them by their newspapers but Azed does not.   ''The Observer'' has always allowed him freedom in construction and he strives to make interesting and varied diagrams.<ref>[http://www.andlit.org.uk/azed/buildslip_param.php?comp_no=1698 Azed Slip No 1698]</ref> The grid comes first, drawn in pencil in an exercise book with squared paper.  Then the bars at the end of each word are inked in for clarity.  Then he chooses his words.  ''[[Chambers Dictionary|The Chambers Dictionary]]'' is consulted, together with ''Chambers WORDS'' and ''Chambers BACKWORDS'' to find combinations that will fit into the grid. Finally, the clues are composed in the order that the words appear in the grid, starting with the first Across clue.  He deliberately avoids tackling the most interesting-looking words first.  He feels that to do that leaves a morass of drab-looking words at the end, quite likely receiving lifeless clues to match. When cluing, ''Chambers Thesaurus'' is a standard aid, assisted by a wide variety of reference books (many now out of print) which he has accumulated over the years.  Composing a plain crossword takes him four to five hours, spread across a week.  His specials can take considerably longer.<ref name =timeshift/><ref>Various Azed slips naming reference books</ref>\n\nHe also sets occasional puzzles under the pseudonym [[Ozymandias]] \u2013 \"Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!\".\n\nHe believes that \"the whole business about the setting and solving of crosswords is that it is a battle of minds \u2013 a tussle of wits between the setter and the solver.  The solver should win but not without a bit of a struggle\"<ref name =timeshift/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n''Azed Book of Crosswords'', Latimer (1975), SBN 901 539 39 2, reissued as ''The World's Most Difficult Crosswords'' by Pantheon (1976 )\n\n''Elementary Crosswords for Learners of English as a Foreign Language'', OUP Japan (1980), {{ISBN|0-19-581750-8}}\n\n''Intermediate Crosswords for Learners of English as a Foreign Language'', OUP Japan (1980), {{ISBN|0-19-581751-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-581751-5}}\n\n''Advanced Crosswords for Learners of English as a Foreign Language'', OUP Japan (1981), {{ISBN|0-19-581752-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-581752-2}}\n\n''Introductory crosswords for Learners of English as a Foreign Language'', Oxford University Press (1983), ASIN: B0007B5BTM\n\n''Lost for Words'', as Ozymandias, with cartoons by Jon, Angus and Robertson (1988), {{ISBN|0-207-16002-3}}\n\n''Best of Azed Crosswords'', Chambers (1989), {{ISBN|0-550-19030-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-550-19030-7}}\n\n''Observer Azed Crosswords'', Chambers (1991), {{ISBN|0-550-19032-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-550-19032-1}}\n\n''Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English'', Co-editor, various editions (OUP Oxford)\n\n''Making the most of dictionaries in the classroom: A guide for teachers of English'' (Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, Oxford Wordpower Dictionary) (ELT) co-authored with Sally Wehmeier, Oxford University Press (1994), {{ISBN|0-19-470221-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-470221-8}}\n\n''Indian and British English'': A Handbook of Usage and Pronunciation, Co-author, Oxford University Press; 2nd Ed edition (2004), {{ISBN|0-19-566656-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-566656-4}}\n\n''Chambers Book of Azed Crosswords'', Chambers Harrap (2005) {{ISBN|0-550-10192-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-550-10192-1}}\n\n''The Best Of Azed'', Guardian Books (2005), {{ISBN|1-84354-253-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-84354-253-7}}\n\n''Oxford Guide to British and American Culture'', OUP Oxford; Rev Ed edition (2005), {{ISBN|0-19-431129-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-431129-8}}\n \n''The Art of the Crossword Setter'' \u2013 essay in ''Chambers Crossword Dictionary'' (2nd edition, Chambers 2006), ''Chambers Concise Crossword Dictionary'' (2nd edition, Chambers 2005), and ''Chambers Crossword Companion'' (Chambers 2007)\n\n''A to Z of Crosswords'', Collins (2006) {{ISBN|0-00-722923-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-00-722923-9}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Jonathan Crowther}}\n* [http://www.andlit.org.uk/ &Lit \u2013 The Azed Slip Archive]\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/crossword/ Guardian crosswords]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Crowther, Jonathan}}\n[[Category:Crossword compilers]]\n[[Category:People from Kirkby Lonsdale]]\n[[Category:Writers from Liverpool]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:English male writers]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Crowther"}

His father was a well-known trumpet player who had played with the [[Metropolitan Opera]].<ref>\"Musician Archie Bleyer, Fired By Godfrey.\" Los Angeles Times, March 22, 1989, p. 20</ref>  The younger Bleyer began playing the piano when he was only seven years old. In 1927 he attended [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]], intending to become an [[electrical engineer]], but as a sophomore switched to a music major. Without graduating, he left to become an arranger.<ref>Andy Rooney, \"Bleyer Was Musician's Musician.\"  Marietta (GA) Journal, March 29, 1989, p 6</ref> In the early 1930s, Bleyer wrote a number of songs that were recorded; all 'hot' novelty numbers, including \"Mouthful O'Jam\", \"Business In F\" and \"Business In Q\".\n\nIn 1934, he began to lead his own band at [[Earl Carroll Theatre|Earl Carroll]]'s club in [[Hollywood, California]]. Bleyer's orchestra recorded for [[Vocalion Records]] in 1934 and in 1935 moved to the [[American Record Corporation|ARC]] group of labels (Melotone, Perfect, Romeo, Oriole).  One of the vocalists who worked with this orchestra was [[Johnny Mercer]], who later became known as a songwriter and co-founder of [[Capitol Records]].\n\nIn 1945, Bleyer began a collaboration on the CBS radio network as the orchestra conductor for the popular ''[[Gordon MacRae]] Show''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://otrrpedia.net/getprogram1.php?item=2485 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-03-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309071138/http://otrrpedia.net/getprogram1.php?item=2485 |archive-date=2017-03-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Included among the instrumentalist who appeared with his orchestra was\n[[John Serry Sr.]], who emerged in later years as a leading orchestral accordionist.\n\n==The Godfrey years==\nHe became [[Arthur Godfrey]]'s musical director in 1946, remaining in this role until 1953.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otrr.org/FILES/Magz_pdf/Radio%20TV%20Mirror/RTV_Mirror_53_06.pdf|title=The Arthur Godfrey I Know|author=Bleyer, Archie|date=June 1953|publisher=Radio-TV Mirror|accessdate=18 November 2010}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Many close to Godfrey considered Bleyer's creativity and understanding of music to be pivotal to the success of Godfrey's radio and TV programs. And while Godfrey was known to be short-fused and controlling, he often deferred to Bleyer's judgment in the areas of presentation and production.\n\nBleyer founded [[Cadence Records]] in 1952. The label's first artist was [[Julius La Rosa]], a member of the Godfrey cast along with vocalists [[Janette Davis]], [[Frank Parker (singer)|Frank Parker]], [[Marion Marlowe]] and the integrated vocal group [[The Mariners (vocal group)|The Mariners]]. At the time, La Rosa was the show's most popular cast member. Along with several instrumental hit singles of his own, Bleyer signed many other artists who had performed on Godfrey's programs including [[The Chordettes]], one of whose members, Janet Ertel, became his wife in 1954.<ref>\"Archie Bleyer to Wed Singer.\" New York Times, November 9, 1954, p. 23</ref>\n\nIn the fall of 1953, Godfrey dismissed La Rosa on the air and later claimed the young singer \"lacked humility\",<ref name=\"Dunning\">{{cite book |url= https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn |url-access= registration |quote= 46 Arthur Godfrey Time saying LaRosa had been guilty of a lack of humility The company had just made a recording for Don McNeill relationship with Chor dette Janet Ertel. |last=Dunning |first=John |authorlink=John Dunning (detective fiction author) |title=On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio |section=Arthur Godfrey Time |date=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-19-507678-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn/page/46 46]|edition=Revised |accessdate=2019-09-07}}</ref> which heavily damaged Godfrey's popularity. La Rosa had a hired a personal manager, going against an unofficial Godfrey policy. That same day, Godfrey fired Bleyer, apparently offended when Bleyer recorded spoken recitations by Chicago radio personality [[Don McNeill (performer)|Don McNeill]], host of ''[[Don McNeill's Breakfast Club]]''.<ref name=\"Dunning\" /> This long-running Godfrey-like show was based in Chicago and broadcast nationally, but its popularity was mainly in the Midwest and tailored to that audience. Always insecure, Godfrey felt McNeill, whose show had once been a competitor, was still in competition though Godfrey was the dominant personality of his generation. Godfrey later claimed when he confronted Bleyer and threatened to fire him from at least one of the three shows Godfrey hosted, the conductor shrugged and told him to do what he had to do.''\n\nRadio historian [[John Dunning (detective fiction author)|John Dunning]] has suggested, in ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio'', that Bleyer's relationship with Janet Ertel was also a factor in Godfrey's decision to fire him;<ref name=\"Dunning\" /> Godfrey tried to enforce a no-dating policy among his cast and fired several who dated each other. After leaving the show, Bleyer never made a public comment about his days with Godfrey. The public furor that surrounded LaRosa's firing and, to a lesser extent, Bleyer's, began the slow unraveling of Godfrey's seemingly unstoppable dominance of radio and TV as Bleyer's career was just beginning to blossom. The loss of Bleyer's expertise in staging and production matters, where he served as an informal mentor to Godfrey despite their age differences, was detrimental to Godfrey's programs.\n\n==Cadence Records==\nWhile LaRosa was unable to sustain his early successes, later Cadence artists included [[Andy Williams]] and the label's biggest act of all, [[The Everly Brothers]] whose hits such as \"[[Bye Bye Love (The Everly Brothers song)|Bye Bye Love]]\" and \"[[Wake Up Little Susie]]\" were produced by Bleyer in Nashville with country studio musicians led by [[Chet Atkins]]. Bleyer circa 1963 was also the step father-in-law of Phil Everly. He had his own instrumental recording hits on the Cadence label as well. [[Don Shirley]] appeared on the label in 1955 with \"Tonal Expressions\".

While he clearly, and correctly, viewed the Everlys as a commercially appealing, clean-cut act whose country-influenced harmonies could reach a vast following, he was not so tolerant of pioneer garage-rock guitarist [[Link Wray]].  In 1957, Bleyer reluctantly agreed to release his no-frills, roaring instrumental \"[[Rumble (instrumental)|Rumble]]\" on Cadence in part due to his daughter's fascination with the song. Wray had a contract with Cadence, but in 1958 after he submitted a newly recorded album of similarly raw material recorded in Nashville, Bleyer was  convinced the instrumental music was morally and musically inappropriate and shelved the album and canceled Wray's contract. The material wouldn't see the light of day for decades until it was acquired by the British Rollercoaster label.\n\nCadence had a short-lived jazz subsidiary, [[Candid Records|Candid]], which lasted for about a year from 1960 (it was reactivated under new owners several decades later).\n\nCadence had another major hit in 1962 with comic [[Vaughn Meader]]'s album ''[[The First Family (album)|The First Family]]'', which featured Meader's comedic sketches and his peerless impersonations of President [[John F.

Other Cadence hits included 14 chart hits by [[Johnny Tillotson]], ten by [[The Chordettes]], four by [[Lenny Welch]], and two by [[Don Shirley]]. In 1964, Bleyer, who was unable to accept the changing pop music market at the dawn of the [[British Invasion]] era, sold the Cadence label and all its recordings (except for certain material which he kept to himself, like the Link Wray album). The buyer was Cadence artist Andy Williams, who formed [[Barnaby Records]] to manage the Cadence catalog.\n\nBleyer moved with his wife Janet to her hometown of [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin]], where he died in 1989 of the effects of [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref>'Archie Bleyer, 79, Music Director, Dies,' '''New York Times,''' March 21, 1989</ref>\n\nBleyer was a [[Freemasonry#North America|freemason]], and a member of St. Cecile Lodge No. 568, New York City.\n\n==Selected records==\n*\"Amber\", first instrumental (1954)<ref>Billboard - Feb 6, 1954 p 37 I'm surprised that Archie Bleyer cut his first instrumental release and had the one side, \u25a1 'Amber,\" run over three minutes \u2014 that is sure death.

His father was a well-known trumpet player who had played with the [[Metropolitan Opera]].<ref>\"Musician Archie Bleyer, Fired By Godfrey.\" Los Angeles Times, March 22, 1989, p. 20</ref>  The younger Bleyer began playing the piano when he was only seven years old. In 1927 he attended [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]], intending to become an [[electrical engineer]], but as a sophomore switched to a music major. Without graduating, he left to become an arranger.<ref>Andy Rooney, \"Bleyer Was Musician's Musician.\"  Marietta (GA) Journal, March 29, 1989, p 6</ref> In the early 1930s, Bleyer wrote a number of songs that were recorded; all 'hot' novelty numbers, including \"Mouthful O'Jam\", \"Business In F\" and \"Business In Q\".\n\nIn 1934, he began to lead his own band at [[Earl Carroll Theatre|Earl Carroll]]'s club in [[Hollywood, California]]. Bleyer's orchestra recorded for [[Vocalion Records]] in 1934 and in 1935 moved to the [[American Record Corporation|ARC]] group of labels (Melotone, Perfect, Romeo, Oriole).  One of the vocalists who worked with this orchestra was [[Johnny Mercer]], who later became known as a songwriter and co-founder of [[Capitol Records]].\n\nIn 1945 Bleyer began a collaboration on the CBS radio network as the orchestra conductor for the popular ''[[Gordon MacRae]] Show''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://otrrpedia.net/getprogram1.php?item=2485 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-03-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309071138/http://otrrpedia.net/getprogram1.php?item=2485 |archive-date=2017-03-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Included among the instrumentalist who appeared with his orchestra was\n[[John Serry Sr.]], who emerged in later years as a leading orchestral accordionist.\n\n==The Godfrey years==\nHe became [[Arthur Godfrey]]'s musical director in 1946, remaining in this role until 1953.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otrr.org/FILES/Magz_pdf/Radio%20TV%20Mirror/RTV_Mirror_53_06.pdf|title=The Arthur Godfrey I Know|author=Bleyer, Archie|date=June 1953|publisher=Radio-TV Mirror|accessdate=18 November 2010}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Many close to Godfrey considered Bleyer's creativity and understanding of music to be pivotal to the success of Godfrey's radio and TV programs. And while Godfrey was known to be short-fused and controlling, he often deferred to Bleyer's judgment in the areas of presentation and production.\n\nBleyer founded [[Cadence Records]] in 1952. The label's first artist was [[Julius La Rosa]], a member of the Godfrey cast along with vocalists [[Janette Davis]], [[Frank Parker (singer)|Frank Parker]], [[Marion Marlowe]] and the integrated vocal group [[The Mariners (vocal group)|The Mariners]]. At the time, La Rosa was the show's most popular cast member. Along with several instrumental hit singles of his own, Bleyer signed many other artists who had performed on Godfrey's programs including [[The Chordettes]], one of whose members, Janet Ertel, became his wife in 1954.<ref>\"Archie Bleyer to Wed Singer.\" New York Times, November 9, 1954, p. 23</ref>\n\nIn the fall of 1953, Godfrey dismissed La Rosa on the air and later claimed the young singer \"lacked humility\",<ref name=\"Dunning\">{{cite book |url= https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn |url-access= registration |quote= 46 Arthur Godfrey Time saying LaRosa had been guilty of a lack of humility The company had just made a recording for Don McNeill relationship with Chor dette Janet Ertel. |last=Dunning |first=John |authorlink=John Dunning (detective fiction author) |title=On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio |section=Arthur Godfrey Time |date=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-19-507678-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn/page/46 46]|edition=Revised |accessdate=2019-09-07}}</ref> which heavily damaged Godfrey's popularity. La Rosa had a hired a personal manager, going against an unofficial Godfrey policy. That same day, Godfrey fired Bleyer, apparently offended when Bleyer recorded spoken recitations by Chicago radio personality [[Don McNeill (performer)|Don McNeill]], host of ''[[Don McNeill's Breakfast Club]]''.<ref name=\"Dunning\" /> This long-running Godfrey-like show was based in Chicago and broadcast nationally, but its popularity was mainly in the Midwest and tailored to that audience. Always insecure, Godfrey felt McNeill, whose show had once been a competitor, was still in competition though Godfrey was the dominant personality of his generation. Godfrey later claimed when he confronted Bleyer and threatened to fire him from at least one of the three shows Godfrey hosted, the conductor shrugged and told him to do what he had to do.''\n\nRadio historian [[John Dunning (detective fiction author)|John Dunning]] has suggested, in ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio'', that Bleyer's relationship with Janet Ertel was also a factor in Godfrey's decision to fire him;<ref name=\"Dunning\" /> Godfrey tried to enforce a no-dating policy among his cast and fired several who dated each other. After leaving the show, Bleyer never made a public comment about his days with Godfrey. The public furor that surrounded LaRosa's firing and, to a lesser extent, Bleyer's, began the slow unraveling of Godfrey's seemingly unstoppable dominance of radio and TV as Bleyer's career was just beginning to blossom. The loss of Bleyer's expertise in staging and production matters, where he served as an informal mentor to Godfrey despite their age differences, was detrimental to Godfrey's programs.\n\n==Cadence Records==\nWhile LaRosa was unable to sustain his early successes, later Cadence artists included [[Andy Williams]] and the label's biggest act of all, [[The Everly Brothers]] whose hits such as \"[[Bye Bye Love (The Everly Brothers song)|Bye Bye Love]]\" and \"[[Wake Up Little Susie]]\" were produced by Bleyer in Nashville with country studio musicians led by [[Chet Atkins]]. Bleyer circa 1963 was also the step father-in-law of Phil Everly. He had his own instrumental recording hits on the Cadence label as well. [[Don Shirley]] appeared on the label in 1955 with \"Tonal Expressions\". It became a Top 15 album in the spring of that year, reportedly selling more than 20,000 copies, a respectable debut for a jazz artist. It was the only chart album Shirley was to enjoy, but his sales remained steady enough that he was with the label until it closed in 1964, recording more than a dozen long-play releases.<ref>[[Don Shirley Discography]]</ref>\n\nBleyer also had his limits to his tolerance for rock and roll. While he clearly, and correctly, viewed the Everlys as a commercially appealing, clean-cut act whose country-influenced harmonies could reach a vast following, he was not so tolerant of pioneer garage-rock guitarist [[Link Wray]].  In 1957, Bleyer reluctantly agreed to release his no-frills, roaring instrumental \"[[Rumble (instrumental)|Rumble]]\" on Cadence in part due to his daughter's fascination with the song. Wray had a contract with Cadence, but in 1958 after he submitted a newly recorded album of similarly raw material recorded in Nashville, Bleyer was  convinced the instrumental music was morally and musically inappropriate and shelved the album and canceled Wray's contract.

The [[Servite rosary]], for instance, has seven sections in memory of the Seven Sorrows of the BVM, each consisting of the Lord's Prayer and seven Hail Marys; it apparently dates from the 17th cent. and was approved by the General Chapter of Servites in 1646.|last1= Cross|first1= Frank Leslie|accessdate= 29 April 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Casanowicz1919\">{{cite book |last= Casanowicz |first= Immanuel Moses |title= Ecclesiastical Art in the United States National Museum |url= https://archive.org/details/descriptivecatal00casa_0 |accessdate= 29 April 2014 |year= 1919 |publisher= U.S. Government Printing Office |pages= [https://archive.org/details/descriptivecatal00casa_0/page/632 632] |quote= ''Rosary''.-Made of glass and composition beads.

When referring to the prayer, the word is usually capitalized (\"the Rosary\", as is customary for other names of prayers, such as \"the [[Lord's Prayer]]\", and \"the [[Hail Mary]]\"); when referring to the beads, it is written with a lower-case initial letter (\"a rosary bead\"). \n\nThe prayers that compose the Rosary are arranged in sets of ten Hail Marys, called decades. Each decade is preceded by one Lord's Prayer (\"Our Father\") and traditionally followed by only one [[Glory Be]], but now{{when?|date=March 2020}} commonly following that, per request of [[Our Lady of Fatima]], the Fatima Prayer (\"O my Jesus\"). During recitation of each set, thought is given to one of the [[#Mysteries of the Rosary| Mysteries of the Rosary]], which recall events in the lives of [[Jesus]] and of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus |Mary]]. Five decades are recited per rosary. Other prayers are sometimes added{{by whom?|date=March 2020}} before or after each decade. Rosary [[prayer beads| beads]] are an aid towards saying these prayers in the proper sequence. \n\n[[Pope Pius V]] (in office 1566-1572) established a standard 15 Mysteries of the Rosary, based on long-standing custom. This groups the mysteries in three sets: the Joyful Mysteries, the Sorrowful Mysteries, and the Glorious Mysteries. During 2002 [[Pope John Paul II]] said that it is fitting that a new set of five be added, termed the Luminous Mysteries, bringing the total number of mysteries to 20. The Glorious mysteries are said on Sunday and Wednesday, the Joyful on Monday and Saturday, the Sorrowful on Tuesday and Friday, and the Luminous on Thursday. Usually five decades are recited in a session.\n\nOver more than four centuries, several popes have promoted the Rosary as part of the [[veneration of Mary in the Catholic Church]],<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20020513_vers-direttorio_en.html Directory on Popular Piety and the Liturgy, 197] The Rosary, or Psalter of the Blessed Virgin Mary, is one of the most excellent prayers to the Mother of God\n*[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c4a1.htm#1674 Popular Piety] Besides sacramental liturgy and sacramentals, catechesis must take into account the forms of piety and popular devotions among the faithful.

Such imagery continues to be used to depict the mysteries of the rosary. Catholic saints have stressed the importance of meditation and contemplation. Scriptural meditations concerning the rosary are based on the Christian tradition of [[Lectio Divina]], (literally ''divine reading'') as a way of using the [[Gospel]] to start a conversation between the person and Christ.

Others add a praying of the pious [[Eucharistic]] prayer \"O Sacrament Most Holy, O Sacrament Divine, All praise and all thanksgiving be every moment Thine\" at the end of each decade in honor of Jesus in the [[Blessed Sacrament]].

By not having to keep track of the count mentally, the mind is free to meditate on the mysteries. A five-decade rosary contains five groups of ten beads (a decade), with additional large beads before each decade.<ref>Garry Wills, ''The Rosary'', Viking Press 2005, {{ISBN|0-670-03449-5}} page 13</ref> The Hail Mary is said on the ten beads within a decade, while the Lord's Prayer is said on the large bead before each decade. A new mystery meditation commences at each of the large beads. Some rosaries, particularly those used by [[religious orders]], contain fifteen decades, corresponding to the traditional fifteen mysteries of the rosary. Both five- and fifteen-decade rosaries are attached to a shorter strand, which starts with a [[crucifix]], followed by one large bead, three small beads, and one large bead, before connecting to the rest of the rosary.{{sfn|Ball|2003|pp=485-487}} A five-decade rosary consists of a \"total\" of 59 beads.<ref>Richard Poe, [http://www.chanttherosary.com/appendices/rosary-parts/ \"Parts of the Rosary\"], ''TheChantRosary.com'', 2-4-2018</ref>\n\nAlthough counting the prayers on a string of beads is customary, the prayers of the Rosary do not require a set of beads, but can be said using any type of counting device, by counting on the fingers or by counting without any device at all.{{sfn|Ball|2003|pp=485-487}}\n\n===Single-decade rosaries=== <!--This section is linked from the redirect \"Rosary ring\". If changed, please update accordingly. -->\nSingle-decade rosaries can also be used: the devotee counts the same ring of ten beads repeatedly for every decade. During religious conflict in 16th- and 17th-century Ireland severe [[Penal Laws (Ireland)#Ascendancy rule 1691\u20131778|legal penalties]] were prescribed against practising Catholics. Small, easily hidden rosaries were thus used to avoid identification and became known as [[Irish penal rosary|Irish penal rosaries]].{{sfn|Ball|2003|pp=485-487}} Sometimes rather than a cross, other symbols of specific meanings were used, such as a hammer to signify the [[Nail (relic)|nails of the cross]], cords to represent the [[Flagellation of Christ|scourging]], a chalice to recall the Last Supper, or a crowing [[rooster]] signifying the [[denial of Peter]].\n\n===Materials and distribution===\n[[File:StMichaelRosary.jpg|thumb|A [[Chaplet of Saint Michael|Saint Michael Chaplet]].]]\nThe beads can be made from any materials, including wood, bone, glass, crushed flowers, semi-precious stones such as agate, jet, amber, or jasper, or precious materials including [[Coral (precious)#Coral as a gemstone|coral]], crystal, silver, and gold. Beads may be made to include enclosed sacred relics or drops of [[holy water]]. Rosaries are sometimes made from the seeds of the \"[[Abrus precatorius|rosary pea]]\" or \"[[Adenanthera pavonina|bead tree]].\" Today, the vast majority of rosary beads are made of glass, plastic or wood. It is common for beads to be made of material with some special significance, such as jet from the shrine of [[St. James the Greater|St. James]] at [[Santiago de Compostela]], or olive seeds from the [[Garden of Gethsemane]]. In rare cases beads are made of expensive materials, from [[gold]] and [[silver]] to [[mother of pearl]] and [[Swarovski]] black diamond designs. Early rosaries were strung on thread, often silk, but modern ones are more often made as a series of chain-linked beads. Catholic missionaries in Africa have reported that rosaries made of [[Bark (botany)|tree bark]] have been used there for praying due to the lack of conventional rosaries. [[Our Lady's Rosary Makers]] produce some 7 million rosaries annually that are distributed to those considered to be in economic and spiritual need.<ref>[http://www.olrm.org/ \"Our Lady's Rosary Makers\", Access date: 15 May 2008.]</ref> \n\nMost rosaries used in the world today have simple and inexpensive plastic or wooden beads connected by cords or strings. The major cost is labor for assembly. A large number of inexpensive rosary beads are manufactured in Asia, especially in China. Italy has a strong manufacturing presence in medium- and high-cost rosaries.\n\nRosaries are often made for sale; hundreds of millions have also been made and distributed free of charge by Catholic [[apostolates|lay and religious apostolates]] worldwide. There are a number of rosary-making clubs around the world that make and distribute rosaries to missions, hospitals, prisons, etc. free of charge. To comply with safety precautions in prisons, special rosaries are donated using string that easily breaks.\n\n===Wearing the rosary===\nThe Apostolate of Holy Motherhood writes that the Virgin Mary encourages the faithful to wear the rosary and scapular because \"it will help them to love [[Jesus]] more\" and serve as a \"protection from [[Satan]].\"<ref name=\"Shamon2003\">{{cite book |last=Shamon |first=Albert Joseph Mary |title=Our Lady Teaches about Sacramentals and Blessed Objects |date=1 June 2003 |publisher=CMJ Publishers and Distributors |isbn=9781891280122 |page=31 |quote=To Mariamante, Our Lady said: \"The Scapular of Mount Carmel is a sign of my protection.

The Scapular and the Rosary are the greatest of these and will afford you the most protection. I want all my children to wear one. It will help them to love Jesus more. This is a simple means by which God helps His children. Wear it always.\" (''The Apostolate of Holy Motherhood'', pp. 10-11.)}}</ref> In addition, [[Saint Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort]] encouraged Christians to wear the rosary, stating that doing so \"eased him considerably.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Saint Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort |first= |title=The Secret of the Rosary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wMvAAAAYAAJ&q=St.+Louis+De+Montfort+rosary+wear+neck&dq=St.+Louis+De+Montfort+rosary+wear+neck&hl=en&sa=X&ei=R6eYUKWIE4ry9gTq5ICgDw&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA |accessdate=6 November 2012 |year=1965 |publisher=Montfort Publications |isbn=0895550563 |page=67}}</ref> Many religious orders wear the rosary as part of their habit.

It would not be respectful to wear it merely as jewelry. This latter point is something to bear in mind in the case of wearing a rosary around the neck. In the first place, while not unknown, it is not common Catholic practice. ...While a Catholic may wear a rosary around the neck for a good purpose, he or she should consider if the practice will be positively understood in the cultural context in which the person moves. If any misunderstanding is likely, then it would be better to avoid the practice. ...Similar reasoning is observed in dealing with rosary bracelets and rings, although in this case there is far less danger of confusion as to meaning. They are never mere jewelry but are worn as a sign of faith.<ref>[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/wearing-the-rosary-as-a-necklace McNamara, Edward. \"Wearing the Rosary as a Necklace\", Zenit, 14 June 2011]</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Ringrosary.JPG|thumb|Single-decade ring rosary.]]\nA rosary ring is a ring worn around the finger with 10 indentations and a cross on the surface, representing one decade of a rosary. These and other kinds of religious rings were especially popular during the 15th and the 16th centuries.<ref>[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O121196/ring-unknown/ \"Collections: Ring\", Victoria and Albert Museum]</ref> These rosary rings have been given to some Catholic nuns at the time of their solemn profession.{{sfn|Ball|2003|p=483}} A finger rosary is similar to a ring, but is somewhat larger. Rosaries like these are used by either rotating or just holding them between a finger and thumb while praying. A hand rosary is a decade in a complete loop, with one bead separated from ten other beads, this is meant to be carried while walking or running, so as not to entangle the larger type. \n\nIn addition to a string of beads, single-decade rosaries are made in other physical forms. A ring rosary, also known as a \"[[Basque ring rosary|Basque rosary]],\" is a finger ring with eleven knobs on it, ten round ones and one crucifix.\n\nA rosary bracelet is one with ten beads and often a cross or medal. Another form is the rosary card. A rosary card is either one with a \"handle\" that moves like a [[slide rule]] to count the decade, or it has a whole rosary with bumps similar to [[Braille]] and ancient counting systems. Some households that cannot afford Christian artwork or a [[crucifix]] hang up a rosary.<ref name=Kinmonth>{{cite book |author=Claudia Kinmonth |title=Irish Rural Interiors in Art |year=2006 |url=https://archive.org/details/irishruralinteri00kinm |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/irishruralinteri00kinm/page/n82 67] |quote=Such icons were displayed in homes which sometimes seemed to possess few other material things: in some of the poorest houses, where people could not afford religious pictures, prints, or even a crucifix, a rosary could be hung up in their place. |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |accessdate=2011-06-28}}</ref> In addition, many Christians hang rosaries from the [[rear-view mirror]] of their automobiles as a sign of their faith and for protection as they drive.<ref name=\"Garbowski2014\">{{cite book |last=Garbowski |first=Christopher |title=Religious Life in Poland: History, Diversity and Modern Issues |date=27 January 2014 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786475896 |page=222 |quote=If folk religion is demonstrated by drivers with rosaries hanging from rearview mirrors or St. Christopher figures on the dashboard, still common enough in Poland, the fish sticker on the car is a more conscious symbol of a witnessing Christian -significantly, unlike the former, it is on the outside of the car for everyone to see.

The second phase which immediately follows it consists of five decades each day for twenty-seven days in thanksgiving, and is prayed whether or not the petition has been granted.

Some forms of the Catholic rosary are intended as reparation ''including the sins of others''. An example is the [[Rosary of the Holy Wounds]] first introduced at the beginning of the 20th century by the Venerable Sister [[Marie Martha Chambon]], a Catholic nun of the ''Monastery of the Visitation Order'' in [[Chamb\u00e9ry]], France.{{sfn|Ball|2003|pp=121, 245}} This rosary is somewhat similar in structure to the [[Chaplet of Divine Mercy]] introduced by Saint [[Faustina Kowalska]] said on the usual rosary beads and intended as an [[Act of Reparation to Jesus Christ]] for the sins of the world. These prayers often use rosary beads, but their words and format do not correspond to the Mysteries. Both Kowalska and Chambon attributed these prayers to [[Visions of Jesus and Mary|visions of Jesus]].<ref>Michael Freze, 1993, ''Voices, Visions, and Apparitions'', OSV Publishing {{ISBN|0-87973-454-X}}</ref>\n\n==Recordings of the Rosary==\nRecordings of the Rosary prayers are sometimes used by devotees to help with aspects of prayer such as pacing, memorization, and by providing inspirational meditations.

When referring to the prayer, the word is usually capitalized (\"the Rosary\", as is customary for other names of prayers, such as \"the [[Lord's Prayer]]\", and \"the [[Hail Mary]]\"); when referring to the beads, it is written with a lower-case initial letter (\"a rosary bead\"). \n\nThe prayers that compose the Rosary are arranged in sets of ten Hail Marys, called decades. Each decade is preceded by one Lord's Prayer (\"Our Father\") and traditionally followed by only one [[Glory Be]], but now{{when?|date=March 2020}} commonly following that, per request of [[Our Lady of Fatima]], the Fatima Prayer (\"O my Jesus\"). During recitation of each set, thought is given to one of the [[#Mysteries of the Rosary| Mysteries of the Rosary]], which recall events in the lives of [[Jesus]] and of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus |Mary]]. Five decades are recited per rosary. Other prayers are sometimes added{{by whom?|date=March 2020}} before or after each decade. Rosary [[prayer beads| beads]] are an aid towards saying these prayers in the proper sequence. \n\n[[Pope Pius V]] (in office 1566-1572) established a standard 15 Mysteries of the Rosary, based on long-standing custom. This groups the mysteries in three sets: the Joyful Mysteries, the Sorrowful Mysteries, and the Glorious Mysteries. During 2002 [[Pope John Paul II]] said that it is fitting that a new set of five be added, termed the Luminous Mysteries, bringing the total number of mysteries to 20. The Glorious mysteries are said on Sunday and Wednesday, the Joyful on Monday and Saturday, the Sorrowful on Tuesday and Friday, and the Luminous on Thursday. Usually five decades are recited in a session.\n\nOver more than four centuries, several popes have promoted the Rosary as part of the [[veneration of Mary in the Catholic Church]],<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20020513_vers-direttorio_en.html Directory on Popular Piety and the Liturgy, 197] The Rosary, or Psalter of the Blessed Virgin Mary, is one of the most excellent prayers to the Mother of God\n*[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c4a1.htm#1674 Popular Piety] Besides sacramental liturgy and sacramentals, catechesis must take into account the forms of piety and popular devotions among the faithful.

By not having to keep track of the count mentally, the mind is free to meditate on the mysteries. A five-decade rosary contains five groups of ten beads (a decade), with additional large beads before each decade.<ref>Garry Wills, ''The Rosary'', Viking Press 2005, {{ISBN|0-670-03449-5}} page 13</ref> The Hail Mary is said on the ten beads within a decade, while the Lord's Prayer is said on the large bead before each decade. A new mystery meditation commences at each of the large beads. Some rosaries, particularly those used by [[religious orders]], contain fifteen decades, corresponding to the traditional fifteen mysteries of the rosary. Both five- and fifteen-decade rosaries are attached to a shorter strand, which starts with a [[crucifix]], followed by one large bead, three small beads, and one large bead, before connecting to the rest of the rosary.{{sfn|Ball|2003|pp=485-487}} A five-decade rosary consists of a \"total\" of 59 beads.<ref>Richard Poe, [http://www.chanttherosary.com/appendices/rosary-parts/ \"Parts of the Rosary\"], ''TheChantRosary.com'', 2-4-2018</ref>\n\nAlthough counting the prayers on a string of beads is customary, the prayers of the Rosary do not require a set of beads, but can be said using any type of counting device, by counting on the fingers or by counting without any device at all.{{sfn|Ball|2003|pp=485-487}}\n\n===Single-decade rosaries=== <!--This section is linked from the redirect \"Rosary ring\". If changed, please update accordingly. -->\nSingle-decade rosaries can also be used: the devotee counts the same ring of ten beads repeatedly for every decade. During religious conflict in 16th- and 17th-century Ireland severe [[Penal Laws (Ireland)#Ascendancy rule 1691\u20131778|legal penalties]] were prescribed against practising Catholics. Small, easily hidden rosaries were thus used to avoid identification and became known as [[Irish penal rosary|Irish penal rosaries]].{{sfn|Ball|2003|pp=485-487}} Sometimes rather than a cross, other symbols of specific meanings were used, such as a hammer to signify the [[Nail (relic)|nails of the cross]], cords to represent the [[Flagellation of Christ|scourging]], a chalice to recall the Last Supper, or a crowing [[rooster]] signifying the [[denial of Peter]].\n\n===Materials and distribution===\n[[File:StMichaelRosary.jpg|thumb|A [[Chaplet of Saint Michael|Saint Michael Chaplet]].]]\nThe beads can be made from any materials, including wood, bone, glass, crushed flowers, semi-precious stones such as agate, jet, amber, or jasper, or precious materials including [[Coral (precious)#Coral as a gemstone|coral]], crystal, silver, and gold. Beads may be made to include enclosed sacred relics or drops of [[holy water]]. Rosaries are sometimes made from the seeds of the \"[[Abrus precatorius|rosary pea]]\" or \"[[Adenanthera pavonina|bead tree]].\" Today, the vast majority of rosary beads are made of glass, plastic or wood. It is common for beads to be made of material with some special significance, such as jet from the shrine of [[St. James the Greater|St. James]] at [[Santiago de Compostela]], or olive seeds from the [[Garden of Gethsemane]]. In rare cases beads are made of expensive materials, from [[gold]] and [[silver]] to [[mother of pearl]] and [[Swarovski]] black diamond designs. Early rosaries were strung on thread, often silk, but modern ones are more often made as a series of chain-linked beads. Catholic missionaries in Africa have reported that rosaries made of [[Bark (botany)|tree bark]] have been used there for praying due to the lack of conventional rosaries. [[Our Lady's Rosary Makers]] produce some 7 million rosaries annually that are distributed to those considered to be in economic and spiritual need.<ref>[http://www.olrm.org/ \"Our Lady's Rosary Makers\", Access date: 15 May 2008.]</ref> \n\nMost rosaries used in the world today have simple and inexpensive plastic or wooden beads connected by cords or strings. The major cost is labor for assembly. A large number of inexpensive rosary beads are manufactured in Asia, especially in China. Italy has a strong manufacturing presence in medium- and high-cost rosaries.\n\nRosaries are often made for sale; hundreds of millions have also been made and distributed free of charge by Catholic [[apostolates|lay and religious apostolates]] worldwide. There are a number of rosary-making clubs around the world that make and distribute rosaries to missions, hospitals, prisons, etc. free of charge. To comply with safety precautions in prisons, special rosaries are donated using string that easily breaks.\n\n===Wearing the rosary===\nThe Apostolate of Holy Motherhood writes that the Virgin Mary encourages the faithful to wear the rosary and scapular because \"it will help them to love [[Jesus]] more\" and serve as a \"protection from [[Satan]].\"<ref name=\"Shamon2003\">{{cite book |last=Shamon |first=Albert Joseph Mary |title=Our Lady Teaches about Sacramentals and Blessed Objects |date=1 June 2003 |publisher=CMJ Publishers and Distributors |isbn=9781891280122 |page=31 |quote=To Mariamante, Our Lady said: \"The Scapular of Mount Carmel is a sign of my protection.

The Scapular and the Rosary are the greatest of these and will afford you the most protection. I want all my children to wear one. It will help them to love Jesus more. This is a simple means by which God helps His children. Wear it always.\" (''The Apostolate of Holy Motherhood'', pp. 10-11.)}}</ref> In addition, [[Saint Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort]] encouraged Christians to wear the rosary, stating that doing so \"eased him considerably.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Saint Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort |first= |title=The Secret of the Rosary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7wMvAAAAYAAJ&q=St.+Louis+De+Montfort+rosary+wear+neck&dq=St.+Louis+De+Montfort+rosary+wear+neck&hl=en&sa=X&ei=R6eYUKWIE4ry9gTq5ICgDw&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA |accessdate=6 November 2012 |year=1965 |publisher=Montfort Publications |isbn=0895550563 |page=67}}</ref> Many religious orders wear the rosary as part of their habit.

It would not be respectful to wear it merely as jewelry. This latter point is something to bear in mind in the case of wearing a rosary around the neck. In the first place, while not unknown, it is not common Catholic practice. ...While a Catholic may wear a rosary around the neck for a good purpose, he or she should consider if the practice will be positively understood in the cultural context in which the person moves. If any misunderstanding is likely, then it would be better to avoid the practice. ...Similar reasoning is observed in dealing with rosary bracelets and rings, although in this case there is far less danger of confusion as to meaning. They are never mere jewelry but are worn as a sign of faith.<ref>[http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/wearing-the-rosary-as-a-necklace McNamara, Edward. \"Wearing the Rosary as a Necklace\", Zenit, 14 June 2011]</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Ringrosary.JPG|thumb|Single-decade ring rosary.]]\nA rosary ring is a ring worn around the finger with 10 indentations and a cross on the surface, representing one decade of a rosary. These and other kinds of religious rings were especially popular during the 15th and the 16th centuries.<ref>[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O121196/ring-unknown/ \"Collections: Ring\", Victoria and Albert Museum]</ref> These rosary rings have been given to some Catholic nuns at the time of their solemn profession.{{sfn|Ball|2003|p=483}} A finger rosary is similar to a ring, but is somewhat larger. Rosaries like these are used by either rotating or just holding them between a finger and thumb while praying. A hand rosary is a decade in a complete loop, with one bead separated from ten other beads, this is meant to be carried while walking or running, so as not to entangle the larger type. \n\nIn addition to a string of beads, single-decade rosaries are made in other physical forms. A ring rosary, also known as a \"[[Basque ring rosary|Basque rosary]],\" is a finger ring with eleven knobs on it, ten round ones and one crucifix.\n\nA rosary bracelet is one with ten beads and often a cross or medal.

Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 7 Oct. 2014]</ref> As in other Novenas, the traditional method consists of praying the rosary on nine consecutive days, and submitting a petition along with each prayer. Indulgences are provided for rosary Novenas that include specific prayers, e.g. a prayer to Saint [[Catherine of Siena]] and [[Saint Dominic]].<ref name=Raccolta294 >Christopher, Joseph P., Spence, Charles E., and Rowan, John F., ''The Raccolta or A Manual of Indulgences'', 2003 {{ISBN|0-9706526-6-6}} pages 294-296</ref>\n\nThe longer \"54-day Rosary Novena\" consists of two parts, 27 days each, i.e. three repetitions of the 9 day Novena cycle. It is an uninterrupted series of Rosaries in honor of the Virgin Mary, reported as a private revelation by Fortuna Agrelli in [[Naples, Italy]], in 1884.<ref name=Dubruiel171 >''The Church's Most Powerful Novenas'' by Michael Dubruiel 2006 {{ISBN|1-59276-097-X}} pp. 171-174</ref> The Novena is performed by praying five decades of the Rosary each day for twenty-seven days in petition. The second phase which immediately follows it consists of five decades each day for twenty-seven days in thanksgiving, and is prayed whether or not the petition has been granted. During the novena, the meditations rotate among the joyful, sorrowful and glorious mysteries.{{sfn|Ball|2003|p=394}}\n\nRosary beads are at times used to say rosary-based prayers that do not primarily involve the Hail Mary and the mysteries of the Rosary. Some forms of the Catholic rosary are intended as reparation ''including the sins of others''. An example is the [[Rosary of the Holy Wounds]] first introduced at the beginning of the 20th century by the Venerable Sister [[Marie Martha Chambon]], a Catholic nun of the ''Monastery of the Visitation Order'' in [[Chamb\u00e9ry]], France.{{sfn|Ball|2003|pp=121, 245}} This rosary is somewhat similar in structure to the [[Chaplet of Divine Mercy]] introduced by Saint [[Faustina Kowalska]] said on the usual rosary beads and intended as an [[Act of Reparation to Jesus Christ]] for the sins of the world. These prayers often use rosary beads, but their words and format do not correspond to the Mysteries. Both Kowalska and Chambon attributed these prayers to [[Visions of Jesus and Mary|visions of Jesus]].<ref>Michael Freze, 1993, ''Voices, Visions, and Apparitions'', OSV Publishing {{ISBN|0-87973-454-X}}</ref>\n\n==Recordings of the Rosary==\nRecordings of the Rosary prayers are sometimes used by devotees to help with aspects of prayer such as pacing, memorization, and by providing inspirational meditations. Some of the more well known include:\n\n* The Rosary is a Place, [[Benedict Groeschel|Fr. Benedict J. Groeschel, CFR]] and Simonetta, The Saint Philomena Foundation\n* The Rosary, [[Fr. Kevin Scallon]] and [[Dana Rosemary Scallon|Dana]], Heartbeat Records\n* Pray the Rosary with Servant of God, [[Patrick Peyton|Fr. Patrick Peyton]]\n\n==In non-Catholic Christianity==\nMany similar prayer practices exist in other Christian communities, each with its own set of prescribed prayers and its own form of [[prayer beads]] (known as the \"[[Chotki]]\"), such as the [[prayer rope]] in [[Eastern Orthodox]] Christianity. These other devotions and their associated beads are usually referred to as \"[[Chaplet (Prayer)|chaplets]].\" The rosary is sometimes used by other [[Christians]], especially in [[Lutheranism]], the [[Anglican Communion]], and the [[Old Catholic Church]].<ref name=Schultz /><ref name=Lutheran />\n\nAnother example of Rosary-based prayers includes the non-denominational [[Ecumenical Miracle Rosary]], \"a set of prayers and meditations which covers key moments in the New Testament.\"<ref name=Paulist1>{{cite web |url=http://paulist.org/ecumenism/rosary-all-christians |title=A Rosary for All Christians? |year=2012 |publisher=[[Paulist Fathers]] |accessdate=5 November 2012 |author=Dennis Di Mauro |quote=I call the rosary \"ecumenical\", since the prayers and \"miracles\" are either directly from the Bible or are derived from the Bible. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028192011/http://paulist.org/ecumenism/rosary-all-christians |archivedate=28 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Anglicanism===\n{{Main article|Anglican prayer beads}}\n[[File:Anglican prayer beads-2006 04 08.jpg|thumb|Anglican prayer beads.]]\n\nThe use of the Catholic Rosary is fairly common among Anglicans of [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] [[churchmanship]].<ref name=Duckworth /> Many Anglo-Catholic prayer books and manuals of devotion, such as [[Saint Augustine's Prayer Book]] contain the Catholic Rosary along with other Marian devotions. The public services of the Anglican churches, as contained in the [[Book of Common Prayer]], do not directly invoke the Blessed Virgin or any other saint in prayer as the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] reject the practice of praying to saints, but many Anglo-Catholics feel free to do so in their private devotions. Anglicans who pray the Catholic Rosary tend not to use the Luminous Mysteries or the F\u00e1tima decade prayer.<ref name=Schultz >''The Rosary for Episcopalians/Anglicans'' by Thomas Schultz 2003 {{ISBN|1-58790-055-6}}</ref>\n\n[[Anglican prayer beads]], also known informally as the \"Anglican rosary,\" are a recent innovation created in the 1980s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kingofpeace.org/prayerbeads.htm|title=King of Peace - Anglican Prayer Beads|website=kingofpeace.org|access-date=2019-08-29}}</ref> They consist of four \"weeks\" (the equivalent of a decade) of seven beads each.

The final \"Hail Mary\" can also be replaced by reciting of either the prayer ''[[Magnificat]],'' or [[Martin Luther]]'s \"Evangelical praise of the Mother of God.\"<ref name=Lutheran>[http://www.giftsofaith.com/Files/lutheranrosary.pdf A Lutheran Rosary].

Gruenwald also introduced outgoing aspiring actress Lindsay McCabe, who became Drew's best friend and the mainstay of her supporting cast.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/without-a-trace-15-missing-marvel-characters/|title=Without a Trace: 15 Missing Marvel Characters|last=Cronin|first=Brian|website=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=March 18, 2017|accessdate=October 17, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004104702/http://www.cbr.com/without-a-trace-15-missing-marvel-characters/|archivedate=October 4, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMarvel had been heavily advertising the series from the start, and during Gruenwald's run [[Spider-Woman (TV series)|an animated TV series]] began airing. But [[Roger Stern]], who replaced Wolfman as editor, recounted that Spider-Woman had already lost her status as a top seller by this time. Despite her differing origin and powers and Wolfman's deliberate effort to avoid Spider-Man guest appearances or crossovers, readers still tended to see the character as a female Spider-Man. \"They saw her, and later the She-Hulk\", Stern explained, \"as running a good idea into the ground, much as DC had done in the \u201960s with its then-ever-growing families of Super- and Bat-characters\".<ref name=\"Back17\" />\n\nIssue #20 saw the departure of Gruenwald, Infantino, and Stern. New writer [[Michael Fleisher]] gave Spider-Woman a career as a bounty hunter, abandoned both the series' macabre tone and outstanding subplots such as Charles Magnus' mysterious disappearance, and replaced them with such superhero standbys as criminal masterminds and a love interest who is enamored with the protagonist's costumed guise but oblivious to her in her civilian identity. Many fans criticized that Fleisher had taken away everything that made the character special.<ref>\"Venom Blasts\" letter pages in ''Spider-Woman'' #27-28.</ref> Fleisher would be retained on the series up until #32, after which [[Chris Claremont]], already a big-name writer for his work on ''Uncanny X-Men'', took over and switched Jessica Drew's occupation from bounty hunter to private investigator. [[Steve Leialoha]] was drawing the series by this time.\n\nThe series had already come under criticism for its rapid turnover of writers,<ref>\"Venom Blasts\" letter page in ''Spider-Woman'' #33.</ref> and like all of its writers, Claremont had a fairly short stay on ''Spider-Woman''. After 13 issues, both he and Leialoha were compelled to leave for other projects.<ref>\"Venom Blasts\" letter page in ''Spider-Woman'' #46.</ref> Their final issue marked the return of Gruenwald, this time as editor. He was promptly informed that due to dwindling sales, Marvel was canceling the series, and issue #50 would be the last.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2012/02/11/the-abandoned-an%E2%80%99-forsaked-spider-womans-dead-and-forgotten/|title=The Abandoned An\u2019 Forsaked \u2013 Spider-Woman\u2019s Dead and Forgotten?!?|first=Brian | last= Cronin|publisher=[[ComicBookResources.com]]|date=February 11, 2012|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref> Gruenwald hired comic book novices [[Ann Nocenti]] and Brian Postman as writer and penciler for the final four issues, under the theory that their inexperience in the medium would give them a unique perspective and perhaps take the series out with a bang.<ref name=\"Back17\" /> Under Gruenwald's direction, the series returned to its macabre roots and resumed the long-abandoned subplot of Magnus's disappearance. The final issue used a photo cover of Marvel staffers (including Gruenwald and Nocenti) in costume as the issue's cast,<ref name=\"Back17\" /> and had Spider-Woman perish in a climactic battle with her nemesis Morgan le Fay. Nocenti reasoned, \"These are licensed characters and you want them to have a forever life. At the same time, they live in a violent world and occasionally you feel like someone has to die, otherwise it\u2019s too unreal\".<ref name=\"Back17\" />\n\nReaders were outraged at the character being killed, and Nocenti and Gruenwald both came to feel remorse over their decision.<ref name=\"Back17\" /> Gruenwald took the readers' reaction especially to heart, and became determined to fix what he saw as a major mistake. He and Stern had been paired up again on ''Avengers'', but with their jobs swapped, and he instructed Stern to write a story reviving Drew.<ref name=\"Back17\" /> Less than a year after her death, Spider-Woman was resurrected in ''The Avengers'' #240-241 (Feb.-March 1984).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/10-marvel-heroes-who-quit-and-returned|title=10 Marvel Heroes Who Quit and Returned|last=Marnell|first=Blair|website=Marvel|date=May 30, 2019|accessdate=October 17, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812135751/https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/10-marvel-heroes-who-quit-and-returned|archivedate=June 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Decline===\nFor the next four years she was limited to a handful of guest appearances.

Titled \"The Return of Spider-Woman\", it put Drew back in costume for the first time in over a decade and ended with a teaser for further Spider-Woman adventures in ''Spider-Man Team Up''. Gruenwald died, however, before these stories could be written, and subsequent appearances treated \"The Return of Spider-Woman\" as non-canon. In 1999, Drew was again placed in the role of non-costumed supporting character, this time to the third Spider-Woman, [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Mattie Franklin]], for the first 11 issues of ''Spider-Woman'' volume 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicsalliance.com/the-replacements-jessica-drew-spider-woman-legacy/|title=The Replacements: Jessica Drew And The Legacy Of Spider-Woman|last=Shiach|first=Kieran|publisher=[[ComicsAlliance]]|date=August 25, 2016|accessdate=May 31, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181009124344/http://comicsalliance.com/the-replacements-jessica-drew-spider-woman-legacy/|archivedate=October 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\nDrew made an appearance in a 2003 story arc in ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'', a series written by [[Brian Michael Bendis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tor.com/2015/11/02/jessica-jones-the-alias-reread-part-3/|title=Jessica Jones: The Alias Reread Part 3|last=Roberts|first=Tansy Rayner|website=[[Tor.com|Tor]]|date=November 2, 2015|accessdate=October 17, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702174930/https://www.tor.com/2015/11/02/jessica-jones-the-alias-reread-part-3/|archivedate=July 2, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Bendis would write most of the character's adventures for the next decade.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicsverse.com/spider-woman-jessica-drew-podcast/|title=Episode 114: Why Spider-Woman Should Be Marvel\u2019s Next Big Female Superhero|last=Camau|first=Jesse|website=ComicsVerse|date=May 31, 2019|accessdate=October 16, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608143044/https://comicsverse.com/spider-woman-jessica-drew-podcast/|archivedate=June 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Revival through New Avengers===\nIn January 2005, ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]'' was launched, ostensibly with Jessica Drew as a member of the titular supergroup, back in costume as Spider-Woman. Though this Jessica Drew would later be revealed as an imposter, this prominent exposure of the character opened the door for new attention to her original adventures. Firstly, on 21 December 2005, Marvel released the first issue of ''Spider-Woman: Origin,'' a five-part miniseries co-written by Brian Michael Bendis and Brian Reed, illustrated by the art team of the [[Luna Brothers]], Jonathan and Joshua Luna. It was largely an extended retelling of ''Marvel Spotlight'' #32, though some details were changed.<ref name=\"CBRorigin\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/just-what-is-spider-womans-origin/|title=Just What Is Spider-Woman's Origin?|last=Cronin|first=Brian|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=January 11, 2017|accessdate=May 31, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114114405/https://www.cbr.com/just-what-is-spider-womans-origin/|archivedate=January 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSecondly, the original ''Spider-Woman'' series was reprinted in its entirety, along with ''Marvel Spotlight'' #32 and all her contemporaneous guest appearances, in a pair of ''Essentials'' [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]s, the first released simultaneously with ''Spider-Woman: Origin'' #1, the second in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiderfan.org/title/comics/essential_spider_woman.html|title=Essential Spider-Woman - reprints|last=|first=|website=Spiderfan|date=|accessdate=October 17, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323060159/http://www.spiderfan.org/title/comics/essential_spider_woman.html|archivedate=March 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the \"[[Secret Invasion]]\" storyline revealed that, with the exception of some flashback scenes, all of Jessica Drew's appearances in ''New Avengers'' over the past four years were actually made by a [[Skrull]] imposter.

At a young age, her family moves to a lab built by her father and [[High Evolutionary|Herbert Wyndham]] near [[Wundagore|Mount Wundagore]] in [[Transia]], where she becomes gravely ill from months of uranium exposure. To save her life, her father injects her with an experimental serum based on irradiated spiders' blood. Because the serum requires a month's incubation, Wyndham places her in a genetic accelerator. Shortly after, her mother dies and her father leaves for the United States, leaving Wyndham to care of her.<ref name=\"SW1\">''Spider-Woman'' #1</ref> While in the accelerator, she ages at a decelerated rate. When she is finally released, decades later, Drew is only 17 years old.\n\nDrew is ostracized by the other residents of Mount Wundagore, the High Evolutionary's [[New Men (Marvel Comics)|New Men]], since she was originally human while they were animals. Because of this, she eventually leaves to seek human civilization. She is captured by a [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] reserve unit under [[Count Otto Vermis]]'s leadership who erases her memories, brainwashes her, and recruits her as a HYDRA agent under the codename Arachne.<ref name=\"SW1\" /> One of HYDRA's top agents, Jared, is assigned to train her in combat and espionage and to seduce her. Once Jessica has become his lover, he allows himself to be captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] so that she can be goaded into assassinating S.H.I.E.L.D. commander [[Nick Fury]].<ref name=\"debut\">''Marvel Spotlight'' #32</ref>\n\nWhile battling Fury, Jessica accidentally kills Jared and learns HYDRA's true nature. She quits HYDRA and assaults the unit's base, sending Count Vermis into a fatal crash, but not before he unlocks memory implants that she was actually an evolved spider and had killed a man before her association with HYDRA.<ref name=\"debut\" /> Despondent from these revelations, she wanders the woods where Vermis crashed until being recaptured and hypnotized by HYDRA.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #31</ref>\n\n====''Spider-Woman: Origin''====\n''Origin'' does away with the spider-blood serum and genetic accelerator elements of the character's previous origin story. Instead, Jessica's powers derive from her mother's womb being hit by a laser beam containing the DNA traits of several different species of spiders while she was carrying Jessica (the Drews were trying to splice and harness spiders' environmental adaptive capabilities to graft them into the human genome).<ref name=\"SWorigin1\">''Spider-Woman Origin'' vol. 1 #1 (February 2006) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref><ref name=\"SWorigin3\">''Spider-Woman Origin'' vol. 1 #3 (April 2006) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>\n\nAfter Jessica's parents disappear under mysterious circumstances, Jessica is recruited into HYDRA (under false pretenses), where she is made into a formidable fighter and assassin. She is trained and mentored by [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]], who trains her in many martial disciplines and more than seven different fighting styles out of his own \"arsenal\".<ref name=\"SWorigin2\">''Spider-Woman Origin'' vol. 1 #2 (March 2006) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>\n\nIn this re-telling, Otto Vermis, originally recruiting her into HYDRA, is rather an old, retired HYDRA agent whom Jessica seduces to gain information that will lead her to her mother.<ref name=\"SWorigin4\">''Spider-Woman Origin'' vol. 1 #4 (May 2006) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>\n\nIn addition, ''Origin'' made the following modifications:\n* Merriam Drew was now Miriam Drew.<ref name=\"SWorigin1\" />\n* The Drews moved to Wundagore Mountain prior to Jessica's conception, establishing without a doubt that she was born on the European landmark. Afterwards, she was raised by her nanny [[Bova (comics)|Bova]] (human in appearance), as well as her mother.<ref name=\"SWorigin1\" />\n* Jessica's father, Jonathan, never found uranium on their land. Instead, their research was funded by HYDRA, and their direct liaison/financier from the group was General Wyndham. It is not clear what connection, if any, he had with Edgar Wyndham (who, in the original Spider-Woman books, was Jonathan's best friend and research partner), nor with the High Evolutionary.<ref name=\"SWorigin1\" />\n* Jessica's father worked in large part with [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Miles Warren]] who later left the project because he felt that there was more potential in experimenting with the [[Clone Saga|cloning]] of human cells.<ref name=\"SWorigin1\" />\n\n===Spider-Woman===\nGoing by the \"[[Spider-Woman]]\" name, Jessica Drew is ordered to abduct [[Alicia Masters]] vacationing in London. During the resultant conflict with [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]], she recovers from her brainwashing and joins him in saving Masters.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #30-32</ref> She and Grimm then encounter [[Modred the Mystic]], who removes HYDRA's memory implants and restores her memories.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #33</ref>\n\nJessica moves into an apartment in London, but finds it impossible to get a job due to her complete lack of background and her tendency to inspire dislike and even fear in other people. Following an aborted break-in, she is unmasked by [[Scotland Yard]] officer (and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent) Jerry Hunt, who becomes obsessed with her.<ref name=\"SW1\" /> During this troubled time, she is approached by the mysterious sorcerer [[Magnus the Sorcerer|Magnus]], who offers help. After defending him from Excaliber, who was sent by [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan Le Fay]] to recover the [[Darkhold]], he suggests that she relocate with him to [[Los Angeles]].<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #2</ref> Magnus tutors her in the ways of civilization and informs her that her father was murdered, leading her on a hunt for his killer.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #3-4</ref> She is distracted from this hunt when Morgan Le Fey's ghost again seeks the Darkhold, this time in person. During the battle, Hunt catches up with Jessica and they begin a romantic relationship.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #5-6</ref> With his help, she identifies her father's murderer who dies immediately after confessing.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #7</ref>\n\nFor the time, Jessica chooses to keep her doings as Spider-Woman a secret. Her relationship with Hunt sours, and following a final battle with the [[Brothers Grimm (comics)|Brothers Grimm]], he and Magnus part ways with her.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #12-13, 16</ref> For the next three months, she makes a hand-to-mouth living by working as a receptionist at the Hatros Institute while undergoing group therapy there. Though she ultimately loses the position due to a change in management, during her time there she received medication to suppress her pheromones so that she could exist among other people without producing any unwanted side-effects.  Jessica formed a strong friendship with fellow patient and aspiring actress Lindsay McCabe and developed acquaintances with several other superheroes.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #13-20</ref>\n\nThe next few months of Jessica's life are not covered by published stories. During this time, she goes public as Spider-Woman, becomes a bounty hunter working in partnership with [[paraplegic]] criminologist [[Hornet (comics)#Hornet (Scotty McDowell)|Scotty McDowell]], acquires a full wardrobe of disguises for use in her work, and finds a police liaison in Captain Walsh.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #21</ref> This situation lasts for several months. When her working relationship with Scotty fails, Jessica accepts an offer from Lindsay to move into an apartment with her in [[San Francisco]],<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #35</ref> where she begins a romantic relationship with their landlord David Ishima,<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #37</ref> and sets up a practice as a licensed private investigator.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #38</ref> Her move there allows Lindsay to deduce her secret identity; she is unbothered by the danger involved in being Spider-Woman's friend, and the shared secret deepens the friendship between them.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #43. Lindsay implies that she had deduced Spider-Woman's identity following her first public appearance in San Francisco, which was in ''Spider-Woman'' #38.</ref>\n\nWhile working as a P.I., Jessica battles Morgan once again.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #41</ref> Not long after that, she gives up her immunity powers to save [[Bill Foster (comics)|Giant-Man]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #85</ref> Her relationship with David Ishima develops to the point where she reveals her Spider-Woman identity to him, only to have him break up with her because he wants to be with an ordinary woman.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #49-50</ref>\n\nJessica travels in astral form with Magnus to Sixth Century England to free her friends' souls in a showdown with Morgan le Fey in the 6th century. She manages to vanquish Morgan, but her human body dies while her spirit was gone.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #50</ref> At her request, Magnus places a spell over humanity to remove all memory of Jessica's existence. This spell is faulty; when [[Tigra]] and the Shroud discover Jessica's dead body, they contact the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Doctor Strange]]. The Avengers and Strange travel to the astral plane to battle Morgan Le Fay, who was trying to claim Jessica's body so she could return to the physical realm. Eventually, Doctor Strange and Magnus reunite Jessica's spirit with her human body, though Magnus's life and Jessica's powers are sacrificed to do so. She thus abandons her Spider-Woman identity<ref>''Avengers'' #240-241</ref> and continues her life as a private investigator in San Francisco, assisted by Lindsay McCabe and, for a time, by Tigra.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' #1</ref>\n\nJessica and Lindsay take a job delivering the Black Blade to Japan, but while passing through [[Madripoor]], she is enchanted by the blade. By this time, her superhuman strength and agility, and ability to cling to walls have returned. She is freed from the blade's power by Lindsay and an underworld figure called Patch,<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #1-3</ref> whom she immediately recognizes as the X-Man [[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]].<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #14</ref> Following the incident, she and Lindsay set up new business lodgings in Madripoor, with Patch as a frequent ally and information source.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #4-8, 10-16</ref>\n\nJessica Drew's life settles down until [[Spider-Woman (Charlotte Witter)|Charlotte Witter]], a villainess going by the Spider-Woman name, steals her powers and leaves her near death.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 2 #5</ref> Jessica is taken from the hospital to New York City by [[Madame Web]] who directs her and [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Mattie Franklin]] (yet another woman who has assumed the Spider-Woman name) to track down Witter. Under Madame Web's guidance, Franklin absorbs from Witter the powers of all four Spider-Women.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' Vol. 3 #1</ref> Afterwards, Jessica remains with Madame Web for a time, helping her to watch over Mattie.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' Vol. 3 #3-11</ref> Jessica's powers gradually return to her during this time,<ref>''Spider-Woman'' Vol. 3 #4-5</ref> but are now unreliable, failing her unexpectedly on occasion.<ref>''Alias'' #20</ref>\n\nFor untold reasons, Jessica moves back to San Francisco, resuming her private investigator practice there.<ref>''Alias'' #17</ref> When she hears that Mattie Franklin has gone missing, she goes to New York to find her.

Jessica is superhumanly strong and is able to lift around seven tons at her peak. She also possesses superhuman speed, stamina, agility, and reflexes. Jessica's body is more resistant to injury than an ordinary person, allowing her to take far more physical punishment compared to an ordinary human. Jessica also possesses superhuman hearing and smell, the latter of which allowed her to distinguish a life-model decoy from the real Nick Fury.<ref>''New Avengers Vol. 1'' #23</ref> Jessica's palms and soles secrete a special fluid that allows her to cling to solid objects, like a true spider. Jessica's physical makeup also makes her highly resistant to all terrestrial poisons, toxins, and completely immune to radiation. While she is typically rendered dizzy by the initial dose, she is completely immune to it after being exposed again. She also exudes a high concentration of pheromones that elicit pleasure and attraction from others, depending on unknown factors which might include gender and mood, although she typically uses a chemical \"perfume\" that renders these pheromones inert. This ability appears to be passive.<ref>{{cite comic|title=Spider-Gwen|volume=2|issue=7|writer=[[Jason Latour]]|artist=Bengal|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=April 13, 2016}}</ref> Jessica's body also produces an inordinate amount of bio-electrical energy, which she can discharge from her hands. She refers to these discharges as \"venom blasts\" although they actually have nothing to do with poison and typically cause pain and unconsciousness, and Jessica can kill a man in the same way that a lightning bolt would and can pierce solid metals like steel by using her blasts at their greatest intensity. Jessica was also able to glide through unknown means using the web-like extensions of her costume but seems to have gained the power to fly after being replaced by the Skrull Queen Veranke.{{issue|date=September 2013}} Jessica has lost her powers in numerous ways and on several occasions,{{issue|date=September 2013}} but after returning to Earth at the end of the Secret Invasion, Jessica's powers were restored and are greater than ever.{{issue|date=September 2013}}\n\nIn addition to her powers, she is a superb hand-to-hand combat fighter, and has trained in several styles of fighting including [[Boxing]], [[Capoeira]], [[Judo]],<ref>''Spider-Woman'' vol. 1 #34 (January 1981)</ref> [[Karate]] and [[Tai chi]],<ref>''Spider-Woman'' vol. 1 #40 (October 1981)</ref> learned under the training of the Taskmaster.{{issue|date=September 2019}} She has also had training in fencing and the use of many other weapons.

His father turned out to be a Russian double agent, who is then killed by his mother. Joining S.H.I.E.L.D. after high school, Jesse is sent back to the moon to renovate the base where he and his crew were attacked by alien spider creatures. Jesse makes it out alive, but the spider's spit starts poisoning his blood and turning it into black goo. He is saved by the head of S.I.L.K., Cindy Moon, who uses her spider formula to fix his blood and grant him spider powers. She deceives Jesse into thinking he needs two doses of the formula a day to survive, but it is discovered by Gwen that he is already cured and the doses are just maintaining his superhuman powers.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' Vol. 6 #7</ref>\n\nAfter learning of this, he quits S.I.L.K. and escapes the state with his family, but not before he aids the three Spider-Women by giving them access codes to Earth-65 Cindy's home base.<ref>{{cite comic|title=Spider-Women: Omega|volume=1|issue=#1|writer=[[Dennis Hallum]], [[Jason Latour]], [[Robbie Thompson]]|artist=[[Nico Leon]]|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=June, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Marvel Adventures Spider-Man===\nIn this version, Jessica Drew appeared in issue 52 and is a freelance agent who arrived at Peter's school as a substitute teacher when she discovered Peter's biology report mixed up with HYDRA's bio-weapons plan.

At its conclusion, she was killed, and though later resurrected, she fell into disuse, supplanted by other characters using the name [[Spider-Woman]].\n\nWriter [[Brian Michael Bendis]] added Spider-Woman to the roster of the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]].

The series was interrupted by Marvel's 2015 \"[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]\" event, and ended with issue #10.

Scene from ''Spider-Woman'' #2 (May 1978); story by [[Marv Wolfman]], pencils by [[Carmine Infantino]], inks by [[Tony DeZuniga]].]]\nWolfman introduced Spider-Woman's mentor [[Magnus the Sorcerer|Charles Magnus]] and archenemies [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] and the [[Brothers Grimm (comics)|Brothers Grimm]]. He left the series after issue #8, citing a heavy workload,<ref>\"Venom Blasts\" letter pages in ''Spider-Woman'' #8 and 12.</ref> but later admitted \"If truth be told, I never felt comfortable writing her. I never found a handle for her and kept trying until I finally decided to leave the book\".<ref name=\"Back17\" /> Neophyte [[Mark Gruenwald]] became the writer, while the series's regular penciler, comics legend [[Carmine Infantino]], remained on board, having developed a fondness for the character and her stories.<ref name=\"Back17\" /> Gruenwald continued with the macabre themes Wolfman had used, while putting more focus on Drew's struggles to deal with her social awkwardness, shyness, and the negative reactions she produced in nearly everyone she met. The last of these is revealed to be caused by fear-inducing pheromones, a previously unrevealed ability. Gruenwald also introduced outgoing aspiring actress Lindsay McCabe, who became Drew's best friend and the mainstay of her supporting cast.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/without-a-trace-15-missing-marvel-characters/|title=Without a Trace: 15 Missing Marvel Characters|last=Cronin|first=Brian|website=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=March 18, 2017|accessdate=October 17, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004104702/http://www.cbr.com/without-a-trace-15-missing-marvel-characters/|archivedate=October 4, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMarvel had been heavily advertising the series from the start, and during Gruenwald's run [[Spider-Woman (TV series)|an animated TV series]] began airing. But [[Roger Stern]], who replaced Wolfman as editor, recounted that Spider-Woman had already lost her status as a top seller by this time. Despite her differing origin and powers and Wolfman's deliberate effort to avoid Spider-Man guest appearances or crossovers, readers still tended to see the character as a female Spider-Man. \"They saw her, and later the She-Hulk\", Stern explained, \"as running a good idea into the ground, much as DC had done in the \u201960s with its then-ever-growing families of Super- and Bat-characters\".<ref name=\"Back17\" />\n\nIssue #20 saw the departure of Gruenwald, Infantino, and Stern. New writer [[Michael Fleisher]] gave Spider-Woman a career as a bounty hunter, abandoned both the series' macabre tone and outstanding subplots such as Charles Magnus' mysterious disappearance, and replaced them with such superhero standbys as criminal masterminds and a love interest who is enamored with the protagonist's costumed guise but oblivious to her in her civilian identity. Many fans criticized that Fleisher had taken away everything that made the character special.<ref>\"Venom Blasts\" letter pages in ''Spider-Woman'' #27-28.</ref> Fleisher would be retained on the series up until #32, after which [[Chris Claremont]], already a big-name writer for his work on ''Uncanny X-Men'', took over and switched Jessica Drew's occupation from bounty hunter to private investigator. [[Steve Leialoha]] was drawing the series by this time.\n\nThe series had already come under criticism for its rapid turnover of writers,<ref>\"Venom Blasts\" letter page in ''Spider-Woman'' #33.</ref> and like all of its writers, Claremont had a fairly short stay on ''Spider-Woman''. After 13 issues, both he and Leialoha were compelled to leave for other projects.<ref>\"Venom Blasts\" letter page in ''Spider-Woman'' #46.</ref> Their final issue marked the return of Gruenwald, this time as editor. He was promptly informed that due to dwindling sales, Marvel was canceling the series, and issue #50 would be the last.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2012/02/11/the-abandoned-an%E2%80%99-forsaked-spider-womans-dead-and-forgotten/|title=The Abandoned An\u2019 Forsaked \u2013 Spider-Woman\u2019s Dead and Forgotten?!?|first=Brian | last= Cronin|publisher=[[ComicBookResources.com]]|date=February 11, 2012|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref> Gruenwald hired comic book novices [[Ann Nocenti]] and Brian Postman as writer and penciler for the final four issues, under the theory that their inexperience in the medium would give them a unique perspective and perhaps take the series out with a bang.<ref name=\"Back17\" /> Under Gruenwald's direction, the series returned to its macabre roots and resumed the long-abandoned subplot of Magnus's disappearance. The final issue used a photo cover of Marvel staffers (including Gruenwald and Nocenti) in costume as the issue's cast,<ref name=\"Back17\" /> and had Spider-Woman perish in a climactic battle with her nemesis Morgan le Fay. Nocenti reasoned, \"These are licensed characters and you want them to have a forever life. At the same time, they live in a violent world and occasionally you feel like someone has to die, otherwise it\u2019s too unreal\".<ref name=\"Back17\" />\n\nReaders were outraged at the character being killed, and Nocenti and Gruenwald both came to feel remorse over their decision.<ref name=\"Back17\" /> Gruenwald took the readers' reaction especially to heart, and became determined to fix what he saw as a major mistake. He and Stern had been paired up again on ''Avengers'', but with their jobs swapped, and he instructed Stern to write a story reviving Drew.<ref name=\"Back17\" /> Less than a year after her death, Spider-Woman was resurrected in ''The Avengers'' #240-241 (Feb.-March 1984).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/10-marvel-heroes-who-quit-and-returned|title=10 Marvel Heroes Who Quit and Returned|last=Marnell|first=Blair|website=Marvel|date=May 30, 2019|accessdate=October 17, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812135751/https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/10-marvel-heroes-who-quit-and-returned|archivedate=June 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Decline===\nFor the next four years she was limited to a handful of guest appearances. In 1988, she and Lindsay McCabe joined the supporting cast of ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'', appearing through the first 16 issues of the character's series, followed by brief returns in issues #27 and 125-128. She was never depicted in costume during her appearances in ''Wolverine'', sticking with her civilian identity, though she did often use her powers to aid Wolverine.<ref name=\"CBRwolverine\">{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/wolverine-superheroes-best-friends-deadpool-nightcrawler/|title=Wolverine: 15 Superheroes You Didn't Know He Was Best Friends With - 12|last=Blunden|first=Fred|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=February 19, 2017|accessdate=May 31, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204211004/https://screenrant.com/wolverine-superheroes-best-friends-deadpool-nightcrawler/|archivedate=February 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Mark Gruenwald returned to the character with a short back-up feature in ''Sensational Spider-Man Annual'' '96. Titled \"The Return of Spider-Woman\", it put Drew back in costume for the first time in over a decade and ended with a teaser for further Spider-Woman adventures in ''Spider-Man Team Up''. Gruenwald died, however, before these stories could be written, and subsequent appearances treated \"The Return of Spider-Woman\" as non-canon. In 1999, Drew was again placed in the role of non-costumed supporting character, this time to the third Spider-Woman, [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Mattie Franklin]], for the first 11 issues of ''Spider-Woman'' volume 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicsalliance.com/the-replacements-jessica-drew-spider-woman-legacy/|title=The Replacements: Jessica Drew And The Legacy Of Spider-Woman|last=Shiach|first=Kieran|publisher=[[ComicsAlliance]]|date=August 25, 2016|accessdate=May 31, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181009124344/http://comicsalliance.com/the-replacements-jessica-drew-spider-woman-legacy/|archivedate=October 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\nDrew made an appearance in a 2003 story arc in ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'', a series written by [[Brian Michael Bendis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tor.com/2015/11/02/jessica-jones-the-alias-reread-part-3/|title=Jessica Jones: The Alias Reread Part 3|last=Roberts|first=Tansy Rayner|website=[[Tor.com|Tor]]|date=November 2, 2015|accessdate=October 17, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702174930/https://www.tor.com/2015/11/02/jessica-jones-the-alias-reread-part-3/|archivedate=July 2, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Bendis would write most of the character's adventures for the next decade.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comicsverse.com/spider-woman-jessica-drew-podcast/|title=Episode 114: Why Spider-Woman Should Be Marvel\u2019s Next Big Female Superhero|last=Camau|first=Jesse|website=ComicsVerse|date=May 31, 2019|accessdate=October 16, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608143044/https://comicsverse.com/spider-woman-jessica-drew-podcast/|archivedate=June 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Revival through New Avengers===\nIn January 2005, ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]'' was launched, ostensibly with Jessica Drew as a member of the titular supergroup, back in costume as Spider-Woman. Though this Jessica Drew would later be revealed as an imposter, this prominent exposure of the character opened the door for new attention to her original adventures. Firstly, on 21 December 2005, Marvel released the first issue of ''Spider-Woman: Origin,'' a five-part miniseries co-written by Brian Michael Bendis and Brian Reed, illustrated by the art team of the [[Luna Brothers]], Jonathan and Joshua Luna. It was largely an extended retelling of ''Marvel Spotlight'' #32, though some details were changed.<ref name=\"CBRorigin\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/just-what-is-spider-womans-origin/|title=Just What Is Spider-Woman's Origin?|last=Cronin|first=Brian|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=January 11, 2017|accessdate=May 31, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114114405/https://www.cbr.com/just-what-is-spider-womans-origin/|archivedate=January 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSecondly, the original ''Spider-Woman'' series was reprinted in its entirety, along with ''Marvel Spotlight'' #32 and all her contemporaneous guest appearances, in a pair of ''Essentials'' [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]s, the first released simultaneously with ''Spider-Woman: Origin'' #1, the second in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiderfan.org/title/comics/essential_spider_woman.html|title=Essential Spider-Woman - reprints|last=|first=|website=Spiderfan|date=|accessdate=October 17, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323060159/http://www.spiderfan.org/title/comics/essential_spider_woman.html|archivedate=March 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the \"[[Secret Invasion]]\" storyline revealed that, with the exception of some flashback scenes, all of Jessica Drew's appearances in ''New Avengers'' over the past four years were actually made by a [[Skrull]] imposter.

At a young age, her family moves to a lab built by her father and [[High Evolutionary|Herbert Wyndham]] near [[Wundagore|Mount Wundagore]] in [[Transia]], where she becomes gravely ill from months of uranium exposure. To save her life, her father injects her with an experimental serum based on irradiated spiders' blood. Because the serum requires a month's incubation, Wyndham places her in a genetic accelerator. Shortly after, her mother dies and her father leaves for the United States, leaving Wyndham to care of her.<ref name=\"SW1\">''Spider-Woman'' #1</ref> While in the accelerator, she ages at a decelerated rate. When she is finally released, decades later, Drew is only 17 years old.\n\nDrew is ostracized by the other residents of Mount Wundagore, the High Evolutionary's [[New Men (Marvel Comics)|New Men]], since she was originally human while they were animals. Because of this, she eventually leaves to seek human civilization. She is captured by a [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] reserve unit under [[Count Otto Vermis]]'s leadership who erases her memories, brainwashes her, and recruits her as a HYDRA agent under the codename Arachne.<ref name=\"SW1\" /> One of HYDRA's top agents, Jared, is assigned to train her in combat and espionage and to seduce her. Once Jessica has become his lover, he allows himself to be captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] so that she can be goaded into assassinating S.H.I.E.L.D. commander [[Nick Fury]].<ref name=\"debut\">''Marvel Spotlight'' #32</ref>\n\nWhile battling Fury, Jessica accidentally kills Jared and learns HYDRA's true nature. She quits HYDRA and assaults the unit's base, sending Count Vermis into a fatal crash, but not before he unlocks memory implants that she was actually an evolved spider and had killed a man before her association with HYDRA.<ref name=\"debut\" /> Despondent from these revelations, she wanders the woods where Vermis crashed until being recaptured and hypnotized by HYDRA.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #31</ref>\n\n====''Spider-Woman: Origin''====\n''Origin'' does away with the spider-blood serum and genetic accelerator elements of the character's previous origin story. Instead, Jessica's powers derive from her mother's womb being hit by a laser beam containing the DNA traits of several different species of spiders while she was carrying Jessica (the Drews were trying to splice and harness spiders' environmental adaptive capabilities to graft them into the human genome).<ref name=\"SWorigin1\">''Spider-Woman Origin'' vol. 1 #1 (February 2006) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref><ref name=\"SWorigin3\">''Spider-Woman Origin'' vol. 1 #3 (April 2006) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>\n\nAfter Jessica's parents disappear under mysterious circumstances, Jessica is recruited into HYDRA (under false pretenses), where she is made into a formidable fighter and assassin. She is trained and mentored by [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]], who trains her in many martial disciplines and more than seven different fighting styles out of his own \"arsenal\".<ref name=\"SWorigin2\">''Spider-Woman Origin'' vol. 1 #2 (March 2006) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>\n\nIn this re-telling, Otto Vermis, originally recruiting her into HYDRA, is rather an old, retired HYDRA agent whom Jessica seduces to gain information that will lead her to her mother.<ref name=\"SWorigin4\">''Spider-Woman Origin'' vol. 1 #4 (May 2006) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>\n\nIn addition, ''Origin'' made the following modifications:\n* Merriam Drew was now Miriam Drew.<ref name=\"SWorigin1\" />\n* The Drews moved to Wundagore Mountain prior to Jessica's conception, establishing without a doubt that she was born on the European landmark. Afterwards, she was raised by her nanny [[Bova (comics)|Bova]] (human in appearance), as well as her mother.<ref name=\"SWorigin1\" />\n* Jessica's father, Jonathan, never found uranium on their land. Instead, their research was funded by HYDRA, and their direct liaison/financier from the group was General Wyndham. It is not clear what connection, if any, he had with Edgar Wyndham (who, in the original Spider-Woman books, was Jonathan's best friend and research partner), nor with the High Evolutionary.<ref name=\"SWorigin1\" />\n* Jessica's father worked in large part with [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Miles Warren]] who later left the project because he felt that there was more potential in experimenting with the [[Clone Saga|cloning]] of human cells.<ref name=\"SWorigin1\" />\n\n===Spider-Woman===\nGoing by the \"[[Spider-Woman]]\" name, Jessica Drew is ordered to abduct [[Alicia Masters]] vacationing in London. During the resultant conflict with [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]], she recovers from her brainwashing and joins him in saving Masters.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #30-32</ref> She and Grimm then encounter [[Modred the Mystic]], who removes HYDRA's memory implants and restores her memories.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #33</ref>\n\nJessica moves into an apartment in London, but finds it impossible to get a job due to her complete lack of background and her tendency to inspire dislike and even fear in other people. Following an aborted break-in, she is unmasked by [[Scotland Yard]] officer (and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent) Jerry Hunt, who becomes obsessed with her.<ref name=\"SW1\" /> During this troubled time, she is approached by the mysterious sorcerer [[Magnus the Sorcerer|Magnus]], who offers help. After defending him from Excaliber, who was sent by [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan Le Fay]] to recover the [[Darkhold]], he suggests that she relocate with him to [[Los Angeles]].<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #2</ref> Magnus tutors her in the ways of civilization and informs her that her father was murdered, leading her on a hunt for his killer.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #3-4</ref> She is distracted from this hunt when Morgan Le Fey's ghost again seeks the Darkhold, this time in person. During the battle, Hunt catches up with Jessica and they begin a romantic relationship.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #5-6</ref> With his help, she identifies her father's murderer who dies immediately after confessing.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #7</ref>\n\nFor the time, Jessica chooses to keep her doings as Spider-Woman a secret. Her relationship with Hunt sours, and following a final battle with the [[Brothers Grimm (comics)|Brothers Grimm]], he and Magnus part ways with her.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #12-13, 16</ref> For the next three months, she makes a hand-to-mouth living by working as a receptionist at the Hatros Institute while undergoing group therapy there. Though she ultimately loses the position due to a change in management, during her time there she received medication to suppress her pheromones so that she could exist among other people without producing any unwanted side-effects.  Jessica formed a strong friendship with fellow patient and aspiring actress Lindsay McCabe and developed acquaintances with several other superheroes.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #13-20</ref>\n\nThe next few months of Jessica's life are not covered by published stories. During this time, she goes public as Spider-Woman, becomes a bounty hunter working in partnership with [[paraplegic]] criminologist [[Hornet (comics)#Hornet (Scotty McDowell)|Scotty McDowell]], acquires a full wardrobe of disguises for use in her work, and finds a police liaison in Captain Walsh.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #21</ref> This situation lasts for several months. When her working relationship with Scotty fails, Jessica accepts an offer from Lindsay to move into an apartment with her in [[San Francisco]],<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #35</ref> where she begins a romantic relationship with their landlord David Ishima,<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #37</ref> and sets up a practice as a licensed private investigator.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #38</ref> Her move there allows Lindsay to deduce her secret identity; she is unbothered by the danger involved in being Spider-Woman's friend, and the shared secret deepens the friendship between them.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #43. Lindsay implies that she had deduced Spider-Woman's identity following her first public appearance in San Francisco, which was in ''Spider-Woman'' #38.</ref>\n\nWhile working as a P.I., Jessica battles Morgan once again.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #41</ref> Not long after that, she gives up her immunity powers to save [[Bill Foster (comics)|Giant-Man]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #85</ref> Her relationship with David Ishima develops to the point where she reveals her Spider-Woman identity to him, only to have him break up with her because he wants to be with an ordinary woman.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #49-50</ref>\n\nJessica travels in astral form with Magnus to Sixth Century England to free her friends' souls in a showdown with Morgan le Fey in the 6th century. She manages to vanquish Morgan, but her human body dies while her spirit was gone.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' #50</ref> At her request, Magnus places a spell over humanity to remove all memory of Jessica's existence. This spell is faulty; when [[Tigra]] and the Shroud discover Jessica's dead body, they contact the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Doctor Strange]]. The Avengers and Strange travel to the astral plane to battle Morgan Le Fay, who was trying to claim Jessica's body so she could return to the physical realm. Eventually, Doctor Strange and Magnus reunite Jessica's spirit with her human body, though Magnus's life and Jessica's powers are sacrificed to do so.

Jessica is superhumanly strong and is able to lift around seven tons at her peak. She also possesses superhuman speed, stamina, agility, and reflexes. Jessica's body is more resistant to injury than an ordinary person, allowing her to take far more physical punishment compared to an ordinary human. Jessica also possesses superhuman hearing and smell, the latter of which allowed her to distinguish a life-model decoy from the real Nick Fury.<ref>''New Avengers Vol. 1'' #23</ref> Jessica's palms and soles secrete a special fluid that allows her to cling to solid objects, like a true spider. Jessica's physical makeup also makes her highly resistant to all terrestrial poisons, toxins, and completely immune to radiation. While she is typically rendered dizzy by the initial dose, she is completely immune to it after being exposed again. She also exudes a high concentration of pheromones that elicit pleasure and attraction from others, depending on unknown factors which might include gender and mood, although she typically uses a chemical \"perfume\" that renders these pheromones inert. This ability appears to be passive.<ref>{{cite comic|title=Spider-Gwen|volume=2|issue=7|writer=[[Jason Latour]]|artist=Bengal|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=April 13, 2016}}</ref> Jessica's body also produces an inordinate amount of bio-electrical energy, which she can discharge from her hands. She refers to these discharges as \"venom blasts\" although they actually have nothing to do with poison and typically cause pain and unconsciousness, and Jessica can kill a man in the same way that a lightning bolt would and can pierce solid metals like steel by using her blasts at their greatest intensity. Jessica was also able to glide through unknown means using the web-like extensions of her costume but seems to have gained the power to fly after being replaced by the Skrull Queen Veranke.{{issue|date=September 2013}} Jessica has lost her powers in numerous ways and on several occasions,{{issue|date=September 2013}} but after returning to Earth at the end of the Secret Invasion, Jessica's powers were restored and are greater than ever.{{issue|date=September 2013}}\n\nIn addition to her powers, she is a superb hand-to-hand combat fighter, and has trained in several styles of fighting including [[Boxing]], [[Capoeira]], [[Judo]],<ref>''Spider-Woman'' vol. 1 #34 (January 1981)</ref> [[Karate]] and [[Tai chi]],<ref>''Spider-Woman'' vol. 1 #40 (October 1981)</ref> learned under the training of the Taskmaster.{{issue|date=September 2019}} She has also had training in fencing and the use of many other weapons.

His father turned out to be a Russian double agent, who is then killed by his mother. Joining S.H.I.E.L.D. after high school, Jesse is sent back to the moon to renovate the base where he and his crew were attacked by alien spider creatures. Jesse makes it out alive, but the spider's spit starts poisoning his blood and turning it into black goo. He is saved by the head of S.I.L.K., Cindy Moon, who uses her spider formula to fix his blood and grant him spider powers. She deceives Jesse into thinking he needs two doses of the formula a day to survive, but it is discovered by Gwen that he is already cured and the doses are just maintaining his superhuman powers.<ref>''Spider-Woman'' Vol. 6 #7</ref>\n\nAfter learning of this, he quits S.I.L.K. and escapes the state with his family, but not before he aids the three Spider-Women by giving them access codes to Earth-65 Cindy's home base.<ref>{{cite comic|title=Spider-Women: Omega|volume=1|issue=#1|writer=[[Dennis Hallum]], [[Jason Latour]], [[Robbie Thompson]]|artist=[[Nico Leon]]|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=June, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Marvel Adventures Spider-Man===\nIn this version, Jessica Drew appeared in issue 52 and is a freelance agent who arrived at Peter's school as a substitute teacher when she discovered Peter's biology report mixed up with HYDRA's bio-weapons plan.
