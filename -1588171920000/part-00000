It maintains the modern Siamese head and body type but appears in a wide range of coat colors and patterns. Like the Siamese, Orientals have almond-shaped eyes, a triangular head shape, large ears, and an elongated, slender, and muscular body. Their personalities are also very similar. Orientals are social, intelligent, and many are rather vocal. They often remain playful into adulthood, with many enjoying playing [[Fetch (game)|fetch]]. Despite their slender appearance, they are athletic and can leap into high places. They prefer to live in pairs or groups and also seek human interaction. Unlike the breed's blue-eyed forebear, Orientals are usually green-eyed.<ref name=ticaOS/> The [[Oriental Longhair]] differs only with respect to coat length.\n\nWhile the breed's [[Genetics|genetic]] roots are ultimately in [[Thailand]], it was formally developed in the US by a number of New York area cat breeders, led by Vicky and Peter Markstein (PetMark cattery), who in 1971-72 were intrigued by lynx patterned and solid colored cats of a Siamese body type at Angela Sayers' Solitaire Cattery<ref name=\"92-yearbook\">Heather Lorimer, [http://www.orientalbc.org/92-yearbook.htm \"Oriental Shorthair\"], 1992-1993 CFA Yearbook, pp. 106-117.</ref> and at Patricia White's.<ref name=\"ultimate-cat\">Leigh-Ann Andersen, [http://ultimatecat.blogspot.com/2011/01/cat-breed-facts-oriental-shorthair.html \"Cat Breed Facts: Oriental Shorthair\"], Jan. 13, 2011.</ref> These were based on solid-colored cats with the body of a Siamese, bred by Baroness von Ullmann over the 1950s.<ref name=\"ultimate-cat\" /><ref>Vicky Markstein, [http://www.orientalbc.org/new_page_1.htm \"The Oriental Shorthair on the Oriental Express\"], 1978 Annual CFA Yearbook, pp. 257-268.</ref>  An \"Oriental Shorthairs International\" was formed in 1973,<ref name=\"92-yearbook\" /> and Peter Markstein presented the breed to the 1976 Annual Cat Fanciers Association, at the same time as the [[Havana Brown]] was presented by Joe Bittaker.<ref>Norma Placchi, [http://www.havanabrowncfabc.com/StandardHistory.htm \"CFA Havana Brown Standard History\"], Havana Brown CFA Breed Council, last visited August 19, 2019.</ref> In 1977 the Oriental Shorthair was accepted by the [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] for championship competition.

The [[gene]] that causes the color to be restricted to the points is a recessive gene; therefore, the general population of the cats of Siam were largely self-colored (solid). When the cats from Siam were bred, the pointed cats were eventually registered as Siamese, while the others were referred to as \"non-blue eyed Siamese\" or \"foreign shorthair\".

{"title_page": "Max Planck Institute of Biophysics", "text_new": "{{no footnotes}}\n[[Image:Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Biophysik.jpg|thumb|300px|Max Planck Institute of Biophysics]]\nThe '''Max Planck Institute of Biophysics''' ({{lang-de|Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Biophysik}}) is located in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]]. It was founded as [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biophysics|Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Biophysics]] in 1937, and moved into a new building in 2003. It is one of 86 institutes in the [[Max Planck Society]] (Max-Planck-Gesellschaft zur F\u00f6rderung der Wissenschaften e. V.). \n\nSince March 2003, the MPI for Biophysics has resided in a new building on the Riedberg campus of the Goethe University in the north of the city. At the end of 2016, a total of 178 employees were working at the institute, including 48 scientists and 50 junior researchers. The Nobel Prize winner Hartmut Michel has been Director of the Institute since 1987. Scientific links to fellow researchers at [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Goethe University]] have been strengthened further as the institute is now situated next to the University's biology, chemistry and physics laboratories. Together with the [[Max Planck Institute for Brain Research]] and the [[Goethe University]] of Frankfurt am Main the institute run the ''International Max Planck Research School (IMPRS) for Structure and Function of Biological Membranes'', a graduate program offering a Ph.D. in the period from 2000 until 2012.\n\n== Departments ==\n\n*[https://www.biophys.mpg.de/en/molecular-membrane-biology.html Molecular Membrane Biology] ([[Hartmut Michel]], since 1987)\n*[https://www.biophys.mpg.de/en/structural-biology.html Structural Biology] (Werner K\u00fchlbrandt, since 1997)\n*[https://www.biophys.mpg.de/en/emeritus-group-bamberg.html Biophysical Chemistry] ([[Ernst Bamberg]], since 1993, em. since 2016)\n*[https://www.biophys.mpg.de/en/theoretical-biophysics.html Theoretical Biophysics] (Gerhard Hummer, since 2013)\n*Molecular Sociology (Martin Beck, since 2019)\n*Molecular Neurogenetics (Peter Mombaerts, from 2006 until 2010) \n\nA prerequisite for the understanding of the fundamental processes of life is the knowledge of the structure of the participating macromolecules. Two of the four Departments are devoted to the challenging task of determining the structure of [[membrane protein]]s. Under the direction of [[Hartmut Michel]] ([[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] of 1988 for the first structure determination of a membrane protein), the Department of Molecular Membrane Biology approaches this problem primarily by [[x-ray crystallography]], whereas the Department of Structural Biology, headed by [[Werner K\u00fchlbrandt]], uses the complementary technique of [[electron microscopy]]. The Department of Biophysical Chemistry, directed by [[Ernst Bamberg]], studies the function of these [[protein]]s in native or reconstituted membranes by electrophysiological and spectroscopic methods. Since 2013, the institute hosts the Department of Theoretical Biophysics, directed by Gerhard Hummer focusing on development and implementation of broad range of computational and theoretical methods to bridge fundamental physics, chemistry and biology of molecular systems. In the Department of Molecular Sociology  integrative cellular structural biology is studied by cryo-electron microscopy, biochemical and mass spectroscopic methods applied to nuclear pores, macromolecular machines that are responsible for the communication between the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm. \n<br />\n==Institute's history==\nThe institute was founded in [[Frankfurt]] am Main as the \"[[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biophysics|Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Biophysics]]\" in 1937. However, it had a predecessor, the \"[[Institut f\u00fcr Physikalische Grundlagen der Medizin]]\" which had been established in 1921 by [[Friedrich Dessauer]], an admirer of Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen, who endeavored to apply radiation physics to medicine and biology. Being a conservative member of parliament for the democratic \"Zentrumspartei\", Dessauer opposed the National Socialists' rise to power and was then forced to emigrate in 1934. His successor, Dessauer's colleague and long-standing collaborator, [[Boris Rajewsky]] was the first director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Biophysics. Rajewsky firstly coined the term \"Biophysics\" and consequently the institute became one of the first to be known by this name. Research has been conducted primarily on the effects of radioactive radiation on humans and possible medical use, as well as on aerosols.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the institute was reopened in 1948 as the \"Max Planck Institute of Biophysics\". With the retirement of Boris Rajewsky in 1966 and the appointment of Reinhard Schl\u00f6gl in 1965, the research work was oriented away from work with radioactive radiation towards the investigation of \"mass transport through biological and artificial membranes\". With the subsequent appointment of Karl Julius Ullrich in 1967 and finally Hermann Passow in 1968 as new directors of the institute, the management of the Max Planck Institute of Biophysics also developed away from the classic one-director institute to a more modern board of directors. The main focus of research was (and still is) the investigation of the cell membrane and its building blocks, the membrane proteins (and especially the transport proteins). The cell membranes and the proteins were and are being investigated using the most modern physical methods available at the time, including\n\n- X-ray crystallography\n\n- high-resolution electron microscopy\n\n- Spectroscopy\n\nThis development was initiated, especially after the retirement of Passow and Ullrich in 1993 and Schl\u00f6gl in 1996, by the appointment of a new generation of directors, in 1987 by Hartmut Michel (Dept. of Molecular Membrane Biology), in 1993 by Ernst Bamberg (Dept. of Biophysical Chemistry) and in 1996 by Werner K\u00fchlbrandt (Dept. of Structural Biology).\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe functional new building of the MPIBP on the Riedberg university campus is divided into two halves by an entrance hall running continuously in an east-west direction. The laboratories and other research facilities of the institute are located in the northern half, while the offices and meeting rooms of the scientists and the administration are located in the southern half from the first floor onwards. For fast communication, the two halves are connected by bridges spanning the entrance hall. The architects of the new building were the Auer Weber Assoziierte GmbH in Stuttgart.\n\n== Miscellaneous ==\nSince the founding of the MPI of Biophysics, one of the directors has also held a chair at Frankfurt's Goethe University.\n\nIn cooperation with other MPIs (for Biochemistry, Medical Research, and Molecular Physiology) it operates its own [[:de:Beamline|beamline]] at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) in Switzerland, \"one of the most modern and powerful \"third generation\" [[:de:Synchrotronstrahlung|synchrotron radiation sources]] in Europe\" (source), in order to avoid the normally long waiting times for a measurement. The sharply focused and intense synchrotron radiation (X-rays) is intended to enable, among other things, large protein complexes to be better investigated by X-ray structure analysis.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.biophys.mpg.de Official site MPI of Biophysics]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Biophysics]]\n[[Category:Max Planck Institutes|Biophysics]]\n[[Category:Biological research institutes]]\n[[Category:1937 establishments in Germany]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1937]]\n", "text_old": "{{no footnotes|date=February 2013}}\n[[Image:Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Biophysik.jpg|thumb|300px|Max Planck Institute for Biophysics]]\nThe '''Max Planck Institute of Biophysics''' ({{lang-de|Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Biophysik}}) is located in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]]. It was founded as [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biophysics]] in 1937, and moved into a new building in 2003. It is one of 80 institutes in the [[Max Planck Society]] (Max Planck Gesellschaft). Since April 2003, the institute's four departments are housed in the same building, resulting in improved scientific interaction between the research groups. Scientific links to fellow researchers at [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Frankfurt University]] have been strengthened further as the institute is now situated next to the University's biology, chemistry and physics laboratories. Together with the [[Max Planck Institute for Brain Research]] and the [[Goethe University]] of Frankfurt am Main the institute runs the International Max Planck Research School (IMPReS) on the Structure and Function of Biological Membranes, a graduate program offering a Ph.D.\n\n== Departments ==\n\n*[https://www.biophys.mpg.de/en/molecular-membrane-biology.html Department of Molecular Membrane Biology] ([[Hartmut Michel]])\n*[https://www.biophys.mpg.de/en/structural-biology.html Department of Structural Biology] (Werner K\u00fchlbrandt)\n*[https://www.biophys.mpg.de/en/emeritus-group-bamberg.html Department of Biophysical Chemistry] ([[Ernst Bamberg]])\n* Molecular Neurogenetics (Peter Mombaerts)\n*[https://www.biophys.mpg.de/en/theoretical-biophysics.html Theoretical Biophysics] (Gerhard Hummer)\n\nA prerequisite for the understanding of the fundamental processes of life is the knowledge of the structure of the participating macromolecules. Two of the four departments are devoted to the challenging task of determining the structure of [[membrane protein]]s. Under the direction of [[Hartmut Michel]] ([[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] of 1988 for the first structure determination of a membrane protein), the Department of Molecular Membrane Biology approaches this problem primarily by [[x-ray crystallography]], whereas the Department of Structural Biology, headed by [[Werner K\u00fchlbrandt]], uses the complementary technique of [[electron microscopy]]. The Department of Biophysical Chemistry, directed by [[Ernst Bamberg]], studies the function of these [[protein]]s in native or reconstituted membranes by electrophysiological and spectroscopic methods. The fourth department \"Molecular Neurogenetics\" under the direction of [[Peter Mombaerts]] has started its work in 2007. Since 2013, the institute hosts a new department \"Theoretical Biophysics\", directed by Gerhard Hummer focusing on development and implementation of broad range of computational and theoretical methods to bridge fundamental physics, chemistry and biology of molecular systems.\n<br />\n==Note on the Institute's history==\nThe institute was founded in [[Frankfurt]] as the \"[[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biophysics]]\" in 1937. However, it had a predecessor, the \"[[Institut f\u00fcr Physikalische Grundlagen der Medizin]]\" which had been established in 1921 by [[Friedrich Dessauer]], an admirer of Wilhelm Roentgen, who endeavored to apply radiation physics to medicine and biology. Being a conservative member of parliament for the democratic \"Zentrumspartei\", Dessauer opposed the National Socialists' rise to power and was then forced to emigrate in 1934. His successor, Dessauer's colleague and long-standing collaborator, [[Boris Rajewsky]] was the first director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biophysics. Rajewsky firstly coined the term \"Biophysics\" and consequently the institute became one of the first to be known by this name.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.mpibp-frankfurt.mpg.de/ Official site MPI-BP]\n\n{{Max Planck Society}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Biophysics]]\n[[Category:Max Planck Institutes|Biophysics]]\n[[Category:Biological research institutes]]\n[[Category:1937 establishments in Germany]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1937]]\n", "name_user": "\u00d6Akonto", "label": "safe", "comment": "80 versus 86", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck_Institute_of_Biophysics"}

His major opponents were the leader of [[People's Movement of Ukraine|Rukh]] [[Vyacheslav Chornovil]] and the author of the [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|Declaration of Independence]]. President Kravchuk remained in office until he resigned as part of a political compromise. A [[snap election]] was held in [[1994 Ukrainian presidential election|1994]], which was won by Ukraine's former Prime Minister [[Leonid Kuchma]]. Kuchma was re-elected for a second term of office in [[1999 Ukrainian presidential election|1999]].\n\nThe [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election|2004]] presidential election was marked by controversy with allegations of electoral fraud in the conduct of the second round [[Two-round system|runoff]] ballot between opposition candidate [[Viktor Yushchenko]] and the government-backed candidate and former Prime Minister [[Viktor Yanukovych]]. After mass nationwide protests, colloquially known as the \"[[Orange Revolution]],\" a new election was held on 26 December 2004 in which Victor Yushchenko was declared the winner with 52% of the vote and was subsequently sworn into office on 23 January 2005.  Victor Yanukovych again served as Prime Minister.\n\nThe [[2010 Ukrainian presidential election|2010 election]] took place on 17 January, with a run-off on 7 February due to a 13 May Constitutional Court ruling striking down 25 October date that the parliament called in April 2009.<ref>{{cite news|title=Court declares unconstitutional parliament's resolution calling presidential polls for October 25, 2009|url=http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/13747.html|work=[[Interfax-Ukraine]]|date=13 May 2009|accessdate=13 May 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224041337/http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/13747.html|archivedate=24 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As a result of this election [[Viktor Yanukovych]] was elected the fourth modern president of Ukraine.\n\nAfter Viktor Yanukovych was removed from power in early 2014 as a result of the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]] the chairman of parliament [[Oleksandr Turchynov]] was appointed to the role of acting president by the [[Verkhovna Rada]] in accordance with article 112 of the Constitution of Ukraine.
