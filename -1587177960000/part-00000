It evolved from what was until 2018 Norway's largest [[University college (Scandinavia)|university college]], [[Oslo and Akershus University College]], which was itself the result of many previous mergers of around 30 former colleges and community colleges in the Oslo area.\n\nMost of the university is located in the city centre of Oslo along the [[Pilestredet]] street, with subsidiary campuses in [[Sandvika]] and [[Kjeller]] in Akershus. The [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the university is [[Curt Rice]].\n\n==History==\n===Roots in vocational colleges and academization from the 1990s===\nOslo Metropolitan University evolved from a former state [[University college (Scandinavia)|university college]], [[Oslo and Akershus University College]], which was established in 2011 through the merger of [[Oslo University College]] and [[Akershus University College]]. Both these institutions had been formed in 1994 through the mergers of many former colleges in the [[Greater Oslo Region]]. These colleges historically focused on [[vocational education]], such as teacher and nursing education, but from the mid 1990s the newly formed Oslo University College and Akershus University College had gradually become more similar to universities through of a process of \"academization\", similar to the development of British [[Polytechnic (United Kingdom)|polytechnics]] into [[new universities]]. This involved broadening their scope to include more traditionally academic disciplines and placing increased emphasis on research and education at master's and PhD levels, as well as increasingly favouring recruitment at the associate professor level or higher. From 1995, the colleges were also governed by the same law and regulatory framework as the universities.

It evolved from what was until 2018 Norway's largest [[University college (Scandinavia)|university college]], [[Oslo and Akershus University College]], which was itself the result of many previous mergers of around 30 former colleges and community colleges in the Oslo area.\n\nMost of the university is located in the city centre of Oslo along the [[Pilestredet]] street, with subsidiary campuses in [[Sandvika]] and [[Kjeller]] in Akershus. The [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the university is [[Curt Rice]].\n\n==History==\n===Roots in vocational colleges and academization from the 1990s===\nOslo Metropolitan University evolved from a former state [[University college (Scandinavia)|university college]], [[Oslo and Akershus University College]], which was established in 2011 through the merger of [[Oslo University College]] and [[Akershus University College]]. Both these institutions had been formed in 1994 through the mergers of many former colleges in the [[Greater Oslo Region]]. These colleges historically focused on [[vocational education]], such as teacher and nursing education, but from the mid 1990s the newly formed Oslo University College and Akershus University College had gradually become more similar to universities through of a process of \"academization\", similar to the development of British [[Polytechnic (United Kingdom)|polytechnics]] into [[new universities]]. This involved broadening their scope to include more traditionally academic disciplines and placing increased emphasis on research and education at master's and PhD levels, as well as increasingly favouring recruitment at the associate professor level or higher. From 1995, the colleges were also governed by the same law and regulatory framework as the universities. Thus, by the 2000s the formal differences between universities and university colleges had become minimal, although the university colleges were still less research-intensive and with a more vocational focus.\n\n===Mergers with research institutes===\nIn 2014 and 2016 the then-university college merged with four of Norway's largest [[social science]] research institutes. These were the [[Work Research Institute]], [[Norwegian Social Research]], the [[Norwegian Institute for Urban and Regional Research]] and the [[National Institute for Consumer Research]].

Encouraged by the success of these two programs, Osher decided to greatly expand his grant support for similar lifelong learning institutes.\n\n==OLLI program development==\nIn 2002 the Osher Foundation began making program development grants of $100,000 a year for up to three years to launch new OLLI programs.  The initial focus was on California, which now has OLLI programs at seven [[University of California]] and 16 [[California State University]] campuses.  In 2004 Osher established a National Resource Center at USM to distribute information about effective educational programs for older adults via a web site, a research journal, and an annual conference. In October 2014 the NRC was relocated to [[Northwestern University]]'s downtown [[Chicago, Illinois]] campus.<ref name=\"NRC\">{{cite web |url=http://nrc.northwestern.edu/2015/04/the-national-resource-center-for-the-osher-lifelong-learning-institutes/ |title=The National Resource Center for Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=April 15, 2015 |website=northwestern.edu |access-date=30 April 2017}}{{dead link|date=November 2019}}</ref>\n\nUnder current practices, if an OLLI program has 500 fee-paying members by the end of its fourth year, the university is eligible for a $1 million endowment grant from the Osher Foundation.  When it reaches 1000 members, it is eligible for another $1 million endowment grant.

The series aired during the network's [[Saturday-morning cartoon|Saturday morning schedule]] from September 10, 1977 to June 21, 1980.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |pages=108-109 }}</ref> All 40 episodes are available on the [[Boomerang (TV network)]] subscription app.\n\n==Summary==\n''Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels'' centers on the mystery-solving adventures of the Teen Angels\u2014'''Brenda''', '''Dee Dee''' and '''Taffy'''\u2014and their friend '''Captain Caveman''' (or Cavey for short), a prehistoric caveman whom the girls discovered and thawed from a block of ice. The concept and general plot for the show was seen as a parody of ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' (which also aired on ABC).<ref name=Woolery>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Children's Television: The First Thirty-Five Years, 1946-1981 |date=1983 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-1557-5  |url=https://archive.org/details/childrenstelevis0000wool/page/62/mode/2up |accessdate=14 March 2020 |pages=62-63}}</ref> The show also borrowed heavily from other Hanna-Barbera shows such as ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' and ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'', among others. \n\nCaptain Caveman's powers include super-strength, a variety of useful objects hidden inside his hair, and a club that allows him to fly and from which pop out different tools he uses to fight crime. His trademark is his battle cry of \"Captain CAAAAAVEMAAAAAAANNNN!\" Captain Caveman's voice was provided by [[Mel Blanc]].\n\nA total of forty 11-minute episodes ran for three seasons from 1977 to 1980: sixteen episodes were produced as segments of ''[[Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics]]'' in 1977, eight episodes were produced as segments of ''[[Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics|Scooby's All-Stars]]'' in 1978 and sixteen episodes were produced in 1980 when ''Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels'' were given their own half-hour show which combined new episodes and reruns from 1977\u201379. Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels also participated in [[Sport|sporting competitions]] as part of \"[[Laff-A-Lympics#The Scooby Doobies|The Scooby Doobies]]\" team on the half-hour ''[[Laff-A-Lympics]]'' segment. Like many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track]], one of the Hanna-Barbera last productions to do so.\n\n==Characters==\n===Captain Caveman===\nCaptain Caveman, or \"Cavey\" for short (voiced by [[Mel Blanc]]), is the protagonist of the show, billed as \"the world's first superhero.\" He is a [[caveman]] who is millennia old (his exact age is never disclosed, although in an episode he is carded by a doorman who is unsure Cavey is old enough to let in, to which Captain Caveman responds, \"I'll be 2 million next month.\") He can pull various objects from his long body hair that covers his body except for his nose, arms, and legs. He can also fly, but his flying power always seems to fail him at the worst possible moment. Sometimes he would attribute this mishap to an energy shortage (\"Uh oh! Bad time for energy crisis.\" ''CRASH!''), which was a reference to the [[1973 oil crisis#Price controls and rationing|gasoline rationing shortages]] of the late 1970s. He speaks in stereotypical \"caveman-talk\", replacing [[subject pronoun]]s with their [[object pronoun|object]] equivalents and dropping [[article (grammar)|articles]] such as \"the\" (for example, \"Me know where bad guys are hiding.\"), and often mumbles the nonsense phrase \"unga bunga\". He also has a bad habit of occasionally eating large non-food objects in one gulp (i.e. [[bicycle]]s, [[Television|TV]] sets, safes, table lamps), and the Teen Angels occasionally have to stop him from eating potential clues that will help them to solve the mystery.\n\n===Dee Dee Sykes===\nDee Dee Sykes (voiced by [[Vernee Watson-Johnson|Vernee Watson]]) is the brains of the Teen Angels and acts as their unofficial leader. Dee Dee and the rest of the Teen Angels found the frozen Captain Caveman and defrosted him. She wears her hair in an [[afro]] and usually wears a red turtleneck sweater with a blue skirt and red knee high boots. Both her dress style and her knack for solving mysteries make her similar to [[Velma Dinkley]] of ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' fame, while she also bears a resemblance to Valerie from ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]''. She is misidentified as Brenda in the [[opening credits]].\n\n===Brenda Chance===\nBrenda Chance (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]) is a nervous brunette who is always scared of the demons, monsters and phantoms that she encounters and always tries to back out of a scary mystery, but always ends up getting captured or the short end of the stick. She wears a purple striped tank top and a pair of hot pink flared trousers with a white belt. She also acts as Dee Dee's sergeant of the Teen Angels. She is misidentified as Dee Dee in the opening credits.\n\n===Taffy Dare===\nTaffy Dare (voiced by Laurel Page) is the blonde member of the group, renowned for her cry of \"Zowie!\" whenever she comes up with a plan (or \"Another Daffy Taffy Plan\" as Brenda and Cavey would call it) to catch the culprits, has a distinct, flirtatious, childlike persona and a [[New York City English|New York-influenced]]/Southern [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]. In spite of her usually zany plans and ditziness, Taffy is actually very capable and clever. She has the ability to seduce Caveman into acting as bait for her plans to capture the culprit. She wears a green dress with matching shoes. She also acts as Dee Dee's second-in-command of the Teen Angels. It is revealed that Captain Caveman has a crush on her and vice versa.\n\n==Broadcast history==\n''Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels'' was broadcast in these following formats on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]:\n\n* '''''Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics''''' (September 10, 1977 \u2013 September 2, 1978, ABC Saturday)\n* '''''Scooby's All-Stars''''' (September 9, 1978 \u2013 September 8, 1979, ABC Saturday)\n* '''''Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels''''' (March 8, 1980 \u2013 June 21, 1980, ABC Saturday)\n\nBroadcast schedules (all [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]):\n\n*September 10, 1977 \u2013 July 1978, ABC Saturday 9:00-11:00&nbsp;a.m.\n*July 1978 \u2013 September 2, 1978, ABC Saturday 9:30-11:30&nbsp;a.m.\n*September 9, 1978 \u2013 November 1978, ABC Saturday 10:00-11:30&nbsp;a.m.\n*November 1978 \u2013 May 1979, ABC Saturday 8:00-9:30&nbsp;a.m.\n*May 1979 \u2013 September 8, 1979, ABC Saturday 8:30-10:00&nbsp;a.m.\n*March 8, 1980 \u2013 June 21, 1980, ABC Saturday 11:30-12:00 noon\n\n==Opening and closing credits==\nThe opening credits for each episode consisted of voice-over narration by [[Gary Owens]]:\n<blockquote>''Set free by the Teen Angels from his prehistoric block of glacier ice, comes the world's first superhero, Captain Caveman!

Captain Caveman worked at ''The Daily Granite'' newspaper with [[Wilma Flintstone]] and [[Betty Rubble]]. His \"secret identity\" was Chester, the office boy. To disguise himself as Chester, Captain Caveman wore a pair of glasses and a tie. Despite the simplicity of his disguise, he required a coat rack and an elaborate transformation sequence to become Captain Caveman.\n\n===The Flintstone Kids (1986\u201388)===\nIn 1986, Captain Caveman appeared in a backup segment of ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' called ''Captain Caveman and Son'' with his son, Cavey Jr. (voiced by [[Charlie Adler|Charles Adler]]). In this case he appeared on a show-within-a-show that the younger versions of Fred, Barney, Wilma, and Betty enjoyed watching; the Captain's mumbled \"unga bunga\" became a catchphrase that the kids would shout before watching each \"episode\" of the show.  The show would involve a lesson the Flintstone kids were trying to learn in the prologue.  The whole \"secret identity\" idea was also ignored or forgotten.\n\n===Other appearances===\n* A very similar pair of characters, the Slag Brothers, made an appearance in the earlier Hanna-Barbera series ''[[Wacky Races (1968 TV series)|Wacky Races]]''. They served as the inspiration for Captain Caveman.\n\n* Captain Caveman later appeared in the ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'' episode \"The Evolutionary War\" with Captain Caveman voiced by [[Chris Edgerly]] and Cavey Jr. voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]. His son Cavey Jr. was teased at school because his existence proved the [[Creation and evolution in public education|Theory of Evolution]].\n\n* Captain Caveman appeared in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode \"Ban on the Fun\", voiced by [[Breckin Meyer]]. In a segment that parodies ''[[Laff-A-Lympics]]'' in the style of the [[Munich massacre]], Captain Caveman and [[Shaggy Rogers]] confront [[Daisy Mayhem]] and Captain Caveman blows her up with the wrong club.\n\n* Characters that look very similar to Captain Caveman appear as enemies in the 8-bit computer game ''[[Renegade III: The Final Chapter]]''.\n\n* In the [[Halloween]] 2008 episode of ''[[Homestar Runner]]'', Homsar is dressed up in a Captain Caveman costume. He then exclaims \"Daaa!! AaAah'm the Captain Caveman of the graveyard train!\"\n\n* In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode named \"[[Perfect Castaway]]\", Peter expresses how much he misses Captain Caveman, and vows that he will see him again once he gets off the island.\n\n* Captain Caveman also makes a cameo appearance in an episode of ''[[Adventure Time]]'' where he is seen as a stuffed doll in Finn's room.\n\n* Captain Caveman appears in the ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]'' episode \"Mystery Solvers Club State Finals,\" voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]. He and the Teen Angels appear alongside other Hanna-Barbera detective teams in a fever dream of Scooby-Doo's. When the teenage sleuths are kidnapped by Lord Infernacus, it is up to their sidekicks to save them.\n\n* In ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mask of the Blue Falcon]]'', there is a person who's cosplaying as Captain Caveman in a Hanna-Barbera convention.\n\n* Captain Caveman is seen briefly in the background in ''[[Imaginationland: The Movie|South Park - Imaginationland: The Movie]]'' (2008). He is amongst a plethora of other imaginary and cartoon characters who are being attacked by terrorists.\n\n* Captain Caveman appeared in the episode \"'Caveman Begins\" on ''[[Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BqLQA2SlGTx/|title=I tell stories on Instagram: \u201cRecording Captain Caveman voice for Warner Brothers new show\u201d Yabba Dabba Dinosaurs.\u201d . . . . #voiceacting #voiceactor #actor #vo #acting\u2026\u201d|website=Instagram}}</ref>\n\n* Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels will appear in ''[[Jellystone!]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/10/hbo-max-looney-tunes-jellystone-the-fungies-tig-n-seek-kids-family-series-1202771895/|title=HBO Max Sets New Looney Tunes, Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, Robert Zemeckis Hybrid Series \u2018Tooned Out\u2019, More For Kids & Family Slate|first1=Patrick|last1=Hipes|first2=Patrick|last2=Hipes|date=October 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n* Captain Caveman and Dee Dee Sykes will appear in the upcoming theatrical animated ''Scooby-Doo'' film ''[[Scoob!]]'' with Captain Caveman voiced by [[Tracy Morgan]] and Dee Dee Sykes voiced by [[Kiersey Clemons]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/scooby-doo-movie-star-will-forte-gina-rodriguez-tracy-morgan-1177354|title=Will Forte, Gina Rodriguez and Tracy Morgan to Star in Animated Scooby-Doo Movie (Exclusive)|first=Borys|last=Kit|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=March 1, 2019|accessdate=March 1, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/04/scooby-doo-movie-scoob-ken-jeong-kiersey-clemons-join-cast-1202593116/|title=Ken Jeong & Kiersey Clemons Toon Up For Warner Bros.\u2019 \u2018Scoob\u2019|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|last2=D'Alessandro|first2=Anthony|date=2019-04-10|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref> It is currently unknown if Brenda and Taffy will also appear.\n\n==Comic books==\n* Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels appeared in all 13 issues of ''Laff-A-Lympics'' ([[Marvel Comics]], 1978\u201379) as members of the Scooby Doobies.\n* Cavey and the Angels appeared in the first issue of the short-lived ''Hanna-Barbera TV Stars'' (Marvel, August 1978).<ref name=TVS1>{{comicbookdb|issue|103865|TV Stars #1}}</ref>\n* The Captain and the Angels team up with Mystery, Inc. in ''Scooby-Doo'' #9 (Marvel, February 1979).<ref name=SD9>{{comicbookdb|issue|94377|Scooby-Doo #9}}</ref>\n* In 2018, Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels appeared in a backup story in the [[DC Comics|DC]] comic ''Aquaman/ Jabberjaw Special'' #1;<ref name=AJ1>{{comicbookdb|issue|442713|Aquaman/Jabberjaw Special #1}}</ref> in this story, the wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] transports the powerful hominid from prehistoric times to the present, to settle an argument with [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|The Spectre]] about whether heroism is strictly a trait of modern man or also of early man.\n\n==Production credits==\n* Executive Producers: [[Joseph Barbera]] and [[William Hanna]]\n* Director: [[Charles August Nichols|Charles A.

The concept and general plot for the show was seen as a parody of ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' (which also aired on ABC).<ref name=Woolery>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Children's Television: The First Thirty-Five Years, 1946-1981 |date=1983 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=0-8108-1557-5  |url=https://archive.org/details/childrenstelevis0000wool/page/62/mode/2up |accessdate=14 March 2020 |pages=62-63}}</ref> The show also borrowed heavily from other Hanna-Barbera shows such as ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' and ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'', among others. \n\nCaptain Caveman's powers include super-strength, a variety of useful objects hidden inside his hair, and a club that allows him to fly and from which pop out different tools he uses to fight crime. His trademark is his battle cry of \"Captain CAAAAAVEMAAAAAAANNNN!\" Captain Caveman's voice was provided by [[Mel Blanc]].\n\nA total of forty 11-minute episodes ran for three seasons from 1977 to 1980: sixteen episodes were produced as segments of ''[[Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics]]'' in 1977, eight episodes were produced as segments of ''[[Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics|Scooby's All-Stars]]'' in 1978 and sixteen episodes were produced in 1980 when ''Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels'' were given their own half-hour show which combined new episodes and reruns from 1977\u201379. Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels also participated in [[Sport|sporting competitions]] as part of \"[[Laff-A-Lympics#The Scooby Doobies|The Scooby Doobies]]\" team on the half-hour ''[[Laff-A-Lympics]]'' segment. Like many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track]], one of the Hanna-Barbera last productions to do so.\n\n==Characters==\n===Captain Caveman===\nCaptain Caveman, or \"Cavey\" for short (voiced by [[Mel Blanc]]), is the protagonist of the show, billed as \"the world's first superhero.\" He is a [[caveman]] who is millennia old (his exact age is never disclosed, although in an episode he is carded by a doorman who is unsure Cavey is old enough to let in, to which Captain Caveman responds, \"I'll be 2 million next month.\") He can pull various objects from his long body hair that covers his body except for his nose, arms, and legs. He can also fly, but his flying power always seems to fail him at the worst possible moment. Sometimes he would attribute this mishap to an energy shortage (\"Uh oh! Bad time for energy crisis.\" ''CRASH!''), which was a reference to the [[1973 oil crisis#Price controls and rationing|gasoline rationing shortages]] of the late 1970s. He speaks in stereotypical \"caveman-talk\", replacing [[subject pronoun]]s with their [[object pronoun|object]] equivalents and dropping [[article (grammar)|articles]] such as \"the\" (for example, \"Me know where bad guys are hiding.\"), and often mumbles the nonsense phrase \"unga bunga\". He also has a bad habit of occasionally eating large non-food objects in one gulp (i.e. [[bicycle]]s, [[Television|TV]] sets, safes, table lamps), and the Teen Angels occasionally have to stop him from eating potential clues that will help them to solve the mystery.\n\n===Dee Dee Sykes===\nDee Dee Sykes (voiced by [[Vernee Watson-Johnson|Vernee Watson]]) is the brains of the Teen Angels and acts as their unofficial leader. Dee Dee and the rest of the Teen Angels found the frozen Captain Caveman and defrosted him. She wears her hair in an [[afro]] and usually wears a red turtleneck sweater with a blue skirt and red knee high boots. Both her dress style and her knack for solving mysteries make her similar to [[Velma Dinkley]] of ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' fame, while she also bears a resemblance to Valerie from ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]''. She is misidentified as Brenda in the [[opening credits]].\n\n===Brenda Chance===\nBrenda Chance (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]) is a nervous brunette who is always scared of the demons, monsters and phantoms that she encounters and always tries to back out of a scary mystery, but always ends up getting captured or the short end of the stick. She wears a purple striped tank top and a pair of hot pink flared trousers with a white belt. She also acts as Dee Dee's sergeant of the Teen Angels. She is misidentified as Dee Dee in the opening credits.\n\n===Taffy Dare===\nTaffy Dare (voiced by Laurel Page) is the blonde member of the group, renowned for her cry of \"Zowie!\" whenever she comes up with a plan (or \"Another Daffy Taffy Plan\" as Brenda and Cavey would call it) to catch the culprits, has a distinct, flirtatious, childlike persona and a [[New York City English|New York-influenced]]/Southern [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]. In spite of her usually zany plans and ditziness, Taffy is actually very capable and clever. She has the ability to seduce Caveman into acting as bait for her plans to capture the culprit. She wears a green dress with matching shoes. She also acts as Dee Dee's second-in-command of the Teen Angels. It is revealed that Captain Caveman has a crush on her and vice versa.\n\n==Broadcast history==\n''Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels'' was broadcast in these following formats on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]:\n\n* '''''Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics''''' (September 10, 1977 \u2013 September 2, 1978, ABC Saturday)\n* '''''Scooby's All-Stars''''' (September 9, 1978 \u2013 September 8, 1979, ABC Saturday)\n* '''''Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels''''' (March 8, 1980 \u2013 June 21, 1980, ABC Saturday)\n\nBroadcast schedules (all [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]):\n\n*September 10, 1977 \u2013 July 1978, ABC Saturday 9:00-11:00&nbsp;a.m.\n*July 1978 \u2013 September 2, 1978, ABC Saturday 9:30-11:30&nbsp;a.m.\n*September 9, 1978 \u2013 November 1978, ABC Saturday 10:00-11:30&nbsp;a.m.\n*November 1978 \u2013 May 1979, ABC Saturday 8:00-9:30&nbsp;a.m.\n*May 1979 \u2013 September 8, 1979, ABC Saturday 8:30-10:00&nbsp;a.m.\n*March 8, 1980 \u2013 June 21, 1980, ABC Saturday 11:30-12:00 noon\n\n==Opening and closing credits==\nThe opening credits for each episode consisted of voice-over narration by [[Gary Owens]]:\n<blockquote>''Set free by the Teen Angels from his prehistoric block of glacier ice, comes the world's first superhero, Captain Caveman!

Captain Caveman worked at ''The Daily Granite'' newspaper with [[Wilma Flintstone]] and [[Betty Rubble]]. His \"secret identity\" was Chester, the office boy. To disguise himself as Chester, Captain Caveman wore a pair of glasses and a tie. Despite the simplicity of his disguise, he required a coat rack and an elaborate transformation sequence to become Captain Caveman.\n\n===The Flintstone Kids (1986\u201388)===\nIn 1986, Captain Caveman appeared in a backup segment of ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' called ''Captain Caveman and Son'' with his son, Cavey Jr. (voiced by [[Charlie Adler|Charles Adler]]). In this case he appeared on a show-within-a-show that the younger versions of Fred, Barney, Wilma, and Betty enjoyed watching; the Captain's mumbled \"unga bunga\" became a catchphrase that the kids would shout before watching each \"episode\" of the show.  The show would involve a lesson the Flintstone kids were trying to learn in the prologue.  The whole \"secret identity\" idea was also ignored or forgotten.\n\n===Other appearances===\n* A very similar pair of characters, the Slag Brothers, made an appearance in the earlier Hanna-Barbera series ''[[Wacky Races (1968 TV series)|Wacky Races]]''. They served as the inspiration for Captain Caveman.\n\n* Captain Caveman later appeared in the ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'' episode \"The Evolutionary War\" with Captain Caveman voiced by [[Chris Edgerly]] and Cavey Jr. voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]]. His son Cavey Jr. was teased at school because his existence proved the [[Creation and evolution in public education|Theory of Evolution]].\n\n* Captain Caveman appeared in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode \"Ban on the Fun\", voiced by [[Breckin Meyer]]. In a segment that parodies ''[[Laff-A-Lympics]]'' in the style of the [[Munich massacre]], Captain Caveman and [[Shaggy Rogers]] confront [[Daisy Mayhem]] and Captain Caveman blows her up with the wrong club.\n\n* Characters that look very similar to Captain Caveman appear as enemies in the 8-bit computer game ''[[Renegade III: The Final Chapter]]''.\n\n* In the [[Halloween]] 2008 episode of ''[[Homestar Runner]]'', Homsar is dressed up in a Captain Caveman costume. He then exclaims \"Daaa!! AaAah'm the Captain Caveman of the graveyard train!\"\n\n* In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode named \"[[Perfect Castaway]]\", Peter expresses how much he misses Captain Caveman, and vows that he will see him again once he gets off the island.\n\n* Captain Caveman also makes a cameo appearance in an episode of ''[[Adventure Time]]'' where he is seen as a stuffed doll in Finn's room.\n\n* Captain Caveman appears in the ''[[Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated]]'' episode \"Mystery Solvers Club State Finals,\" voiced by [[Jim Cummings]]. He and the Teen Angels appear alongside other Hanna-Barbera detective teams in a fever dream of Scooby-Doo's.

ADKINS'''<br />\nUNITED STATES ARMY\n</center>\n\n''For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty:''\n\nSergeant First Class Bennie G. Adkins distinguished himself by acts of gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as an Intelligence Sergeant with Detachment A-102, 5th Special Forces Group, 1st Special Forces, during combat operations against an armed enemy at Camp A Shau, Republic of Vietnam from March 9 to 12, 1966. When the camp was attacked by a large North Vietnamese and Viet Cong force in the early morning hours, Sergeant First Class Adkins rushed through intense enemy fire and manned a mortar position continually adjusting fire for the camp, despite incurring wounds as the mortar pit received several direct hits from enemy mortars. Upon learning that several soldiers were wounded near the center of camp, he temporarily turned the mortar over to another soldier, ran through exploding mortar rounds and dragged several comrades to safety. As the hostile fire subsided, Sergeant First Class Adkins exposed himself to sporadic sniper fire while carrying his wounded comrades to the camp dispensary. When Sergeant First Class Adkins and his group of defenders came under heavy small arms fire from members of the Civilian Irregular Defense Group that had defected to fight with the North Vietnamese, he maneuvered outside the camp to evacuate a seriously wounded American and draw fire all the while successfully covering the rescue. When a resupply air drop landed outside of the camp perimeter, Sergeant First Class Adkins, again, moved outside of the camp walls to retrieve the much needed supplies. During the early morning hours of March 10, 1966 enemy forces launched their main attack and within two hours, Sergeant First Class Adkins was the only man firing a mortar weapon. When all mortar rounds were expended, Sergeant First Class Adkins began placing effective recoilless rifle fire upon enemy positions. Despite receiving additional wounds from enemy rounds exploding on his position, Sergeant First Class Adkins fought off intense waves of attacking Viet Cong. Sergeant First Class Adkins eliminated numerous insurgents with small arms fire after withdrawing to a communications bunker with several soldiers. Running extremely low on ammunition, he returned to the mortar pit, gathered vital ammunition and ran through intense fire back to the bunker. After being ordered to evacuate the camp, Sergeant First Class Adkins and a small group of soldiers destroyed all signal equipment and classified documents, dug their way out of the rear of the bunker and fought their way out of the camp. While carrying a wounded soldier to the extraction point he learned that the last helicopter had already departed. Sergeant First Class Adkins led the group while evading the enemy until they were rescued by helicopter on March 12, 1966. During the thirty-eight-hour battle and forty-eight hours of escape and evasion, fighting with mortars, machine guns, recoilless rifles, small arms, and hand grenades, it was estimated that Sergeant First Class Adkins killed between one hundred thirty five and one hundred seventy five of the enemy while sustaining eighteen different wounds to his body. Sergeant First Class Adkins' extraordinary heroism and selflessness above and beyond the call of duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, Detachment A-102, 5th Special Forces Group, 1st Special Forces and the United States Army.<ref name=usarmy />}}\n\n==Awards and decorations==\n[[File:Joseph Dunford and Bennie Adkins 170119-D-PB383-002 (32047590960).jpg|thumb|Adkins with [[Joseph F.

Adkins distinguished himself by acts of gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as an Intelligence Sergeant with Detachment A-102, 5th Special Forces Group, 1st Special Forces, during combat operations against an armed enemy at Camp A Shau, Republic of Vietnam from March 9 to 12, 1966. When the camp was attacked by a large North Vietnamese and Viet Cong force in the early morning hours, Sergeant First Class Adkins rushed through intense enemy fire and manned a mortar position continually adjusting fire for the camp, despite incurring wounds as the mortar pit received several direct hits from enemy mortars. Upon learning that several soldiers were wounded near the center of camp, he temporarily turned the mortar over to another soldier, ran through exploding mortar rounds and dragged several comrades to safety. As the hostile fire subsided, Sergeant First Class Adkins exposed himself to sporadic sniper fire while carrying his wounded comrades to the camp dispensary. When Sergeant First Class Adkins and his group of defenders came under heavy small arms fire from members of the Civilian Irregular Defense Group that had defected to fight with the North Vietnamese, he maneuvered outside the camp to evacuate a seriously wounded American and draw fire all the while successfully covering the rescue. When a resupply air drop landed outside of the camp perimeter, Sergeant First Class Adkins, again, moved outside of the camp walls to retrieve the much needed supplies. During the early morning hours of March 10, 1966 enemy forces launched their main attack and within two hours, Sergeant First Class Adkins was the only man firing a mortar weapon. When all mortar rounds were expended, Sergeant First Class Adkins began placing effective recoilless rifle fire upon enemy positions.

In [[Australia]] the group was called \"British Jigsaw\" due to the existence of a local band of the same name.\n\n==Overview==\nFormed as a six-piece [[band (music)|band]] of musicians in [[Coventry]] and [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] by Tony Campbell in April 1966, they scored a number of [[chart-topper|hit]] [[single (music)|singles]] around the world, and released thirteen [[album]]s. The group was partly influenced by fellow British musicians [[The Beatles]], at times sounding Beatle-esque, especially their [[ballad]]s, which show leanings towards [[Paul McCartney]]'s musical and vocal arrangements.\n\n==The early days==\nThe original line-up consisted of Dave \"Biffo\" Beech ([[vocals]] and [[drum kit|drums]]) (born David Beech, 25 September 1945, in [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]], Warwickshire, died 7 June 2007); [[Clive Scott]] ([[keyboard instrument|keyboards]] and vocals) (born Clive Kenneth Scott, 24 February 1945, in [[Coventry]], died 10 May 2009); Barrie Bernard ([[bass guitar]]) (born 27 November 1944, in Coventry); Tony Campbell ([[guitar]]) (born Anthony Campbell, 24 June 1944, in Rugby); Tony Britnell ([[saxophone]]) and Kevin \"Beppy\" Mahon (tenor saxophone). Biffo left in the first year, and was replaced by Des Dyer ([[drum kit|drums]]) (born Desmond Roy Dyer, 22 May 1948, in Rugby), who took over lead vocals.\n\nScott had been in Scott and The Antarctics; Dyer had played in The Surfcyders and Clockwork Shoppe; Campbell, Mahon and Beech had worked together in [[The Mighty Avengers (band)|The Mighty Avengers]]; and Bernard had been a member of [[Pinkerton's Assorted Colours]], whilst Britnell had worked with [[The Fortunes]].\n\nCampbell named the band after a Manchester nightclub called \"The Jigsaw Club\", but the way that he 'pieced together' the band from other members of existing groups also gave added aptness to the name.\n\nIn 1970, the group were given the opportunity of turning fully professional by being the backing band for [[Arthur Conley]], on his European tour. Most of the band did so, but Kevin Mahon decided to keep his day job and left the band. In 1974, Tony Britnell became seriously ill and left the band. After his recuperation he became a member of The Sunsets, the backing band for [[Shakin' Stevens]].\n\n==Change in musical direction and commercial success==\nOn stage, Jigsaw were a wild rock band who had a high energy live show; drum kits were set on fire, explosions were set off as an effect, Tony Britnell performed fire eating and Clive Scott would make his Marshall stack explode and disintegrate.  However, during the early 1970s they began writing and recording more mainstream pop.\n\nJigsaw's arrangement of the [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] tune, ''[[Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring]]'' was featured on their 1970 debut album ''Letherslade Farm''.\n\nThe group give credit to their producer and manager, Chas Peate, for inspiration to get songs completed. As Jigsaw toured a lot, Scott and Dyer would write snippets of songs separately in their spare time, but, as Dyer said in an interview in the 1990s, \"it was Chas who would say we're recording an album soon, you'll need 10 songs by then\". The two would then combine their work together for the planned recording sessions.\n\nAs songwriters, the duo had a hit song with \"[[Who Do You Think You Are (Candlewick Green song)|Who Do You Think You Are]]\", which was covered by the UK band [[Candlewick Green]] in 1974.  The song was further covered in the U.S. by [[Bo Donaldson and The Heywoods]] (this version made the U.S. charts), and again in 1993 by [[Saint Etienne (band)|Saint Etienne]].  The song was also on Jigsaw's 1974 album ''I\u2019ve Seen The Film, I\u2019ve Read The Book''.  However, the band's own single from the album \"You\u2019re Not The Only Girl\" was not a chart success. Early in 1975, the single \"Baby Don't Do It\" received heavy airplay on the UK service of Radio Luxembourg, but the record was not a hit and the band were soon dropped by their recording label, [[BASF]].\n\n[[File:Jigsaw1975.jpg|thumb|Jigsaw on the Dutch TV programme ''[[TopPop]]'' on 20 January 1975.]]\nWanting to carry on, the group continued to make music and signed a new deal with independent UK label Splash, which was founded by Chas Peate himself. Their first single for their new label, titled \"[[Sky High (song)|Sky High]]\", was recorded for the film ''[[The Man from Hong Kong]]'', a 1975 martial-arts action movie starring [[George Lazenby]]. Splash pressed a couple of hundred promotional copies and reaction to the song was good, especially from Radio Luxembourg which began playing the song with high rotation during its nightly English pop music broadcasts to the UK. \"Sky High\" subsequently made the UK Top 10 in November 1975. The recording was licensed to [[Chelsea Records]] in the United States where it reached #3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and to #2 [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]].  The song was also #1 in [[Japan]]. A famous Mexican [[Lucha libre|wrestler]], [[Mil M\u00e1scaras]], used \"Sky High\" as his theme tune. He would walk to the ring with the song playing in the background, and his popularity in Japan helped \"Sky High\" to become a hit twice over in that country in consecutive years.\n\nThe ''Sky High'' album also sold well too, especially in Japan. The next single \"Love Fire\" was another hit, although not in the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, \"Love Fire\"  was followed by two new albums, one for the British market called ''Pieces of Magic'' and another for the American market simply named, ''Jigsaw''.\n\nIn 1977, the band recorded an album ''Journey into Space'' in Los Angeles. Years later, Clive Scott revealed in an interview that the record label [[20th Century Records]] paid for the band to fly out to make the album, paid for their accommodation, and gave them cash advances (or, as Scott called it, \"[[wikt:pocket money|pocket money]]\") to live off for three months while making the record. The album was produced by Rick Jarrard who was the producer of [[Jose Feliciano]] and the person responsible for putting together Elvis Presley's Las Vegas band. However, the album was never released, much to the frustration of the group.\n\nJigsaw returned to Britain and scored another hit with the single \"If I Have To Go Away\", after which they recorded ten original songs for the film ''Home Before Midnight''.\n\n==Break-up==\nBernard left the band in 1978 and was replaced by Jon Fox. Campbell also left the band in 1979 and was replaced by Rod Godwin. The band ceased touring in 1981 but Scott and Dyer continued to record using Tim Stone on guitar and Pete Dennis on bass. This new group lineup recorded one album for [[Elektra Records|Elektra]]. The album, a disco influenced set (that was never released in the [[United Kingdom]]) was issued in the [[United States]] the following year.  A final single under the Jigsaw name was released by Splash in early 1983 called \"Love Isn't at Home\".\n\nFollowing the group split, Scott and Dyer continued to be successful songwriters, having their work recorded by [[Nicki French]], [[Bad Boys Inc]], [[Boyzone]], [[Jon Otis (musician)|Jon Otis]], [[Bobby Rydell]], and many others. After leaving his music career behind when he quit Jigsaw in 1979, Tony Campbell went back to his first occupation, ophthalmic engineering. He had a family. One of his daughters created and manages the Royal Academy of Dance dance school in Rugby, Warwickshire. Barrie Bernard continued to work in the entertainment business, running [[night club]]s and being an active [[Magician (illusion)|magician]]. Though no new studio albums have been issued, eight newly recorded songs were included on a 1995 compilation CD, entitled ''The Best of Jigsaw'', just one of the collections of their music released. Dyer has twice attempted to represent the UK at the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], taking part in the 1983 and 1985 [[A Song For Europe]] competitions. In 1983, he placed third as lead singer of the group Casablanca with the song \"With Love\". Two years later, as a soloist, he took \"Energy\" to fourth place. The song from 1985, \"Energy\", was reworked to become the album track \"Voice of America\" and sung by [[Nicki French]] for her first studio album \"Secrets\". In 1988, Dyer provided backing vocals at the [[Eurovision]] final alongside Julie Forsyth and Dominic Grant, both formerly of [[Guys 'n' Dolls]], for the UK entry performed by [[Scott Fitzgerald (singer)|Scott Fitzgerald]], \"Go\". This song placed second in the contest held in [[Dublin]] on 30 April. The UK lost by one point to [[Celine Dion]], representing Switzerland with \"Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi\" (Don't Leave Without Me).\n\nMuch has also been made about their lack of success in the UK charts, where only two of their singles made the Top 40. It has been suggested this was because [[BBC Radio 1]], the most popular station in the UK at the time, gave little or no airplay to their singles after \"Sky High\" in 1975.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} However, the group lasted a long time and were big stars in Japan, as well as having four [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] hit singles in the U.S. Their music is also still in print on [[compact disc]], enjoying healthy sales.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The sleeve notes to their 1998 Greatest Hits collection, ''The Very Best of Jigsaw'' stated \"A look at Jigsaw\u2019s songs reveals the innovative work of its creators: the advanced song structure, the clever use of classical techniques like counterpoint and a novel approach to using sound effects \u2013 leaving the listener with a sadly-overlooked-but-very-impressive catalogue of melodic pop songs\".\n\nFounding member Clive Scott died on 10 May 2009.<ref>[http://www.thedeadrockstarsclub.com/2009.html Deadrockstarsclub.com - accessed May 2009]</ref> He had an accident at home two weeks earlier and never recovered, despite having brain surgery.

The two would then combine their work together for the planned recording sessions.\n\nAs songwriters, the duo had a hit song with \"[[Who Do You Think You Are (Candlewick Green song)|Who Do You Think You Are]]\", which was covered by the UK band [[Candlewick Green]] in 1974.  The song was further covered in the U.S. by [[Bo Donaldson and The Heywoods]] (this version made the U.S. charts), and again in 1993 by [[Saint Etienne (band)|Saint Etienne]].  The song was also on Jigsaw's 1974 album ''I\u2019ve Seen The Film, I\u2019ve Read The Book''.  However, the band's own single from the album \"You\u2019re Not The Only Girl\" was not a chart success. Early in 1975, the single \"Baby Don't Do It\" received heavy airplay on the UK service of Radio Luxembourg, but the record was not a hit and the band were soon dropped by their recording label, [[BASF]].\n\n[[File:Jigsaw1975.jpg|thumb|Jigsaw on the Dutch TV programme ''[[TopPop]]'' on 20 January 1975.]]\nWanting to carry on, the group continued to make music and signed a new deal with independent UK label Splash, which was founded by Chas Peate himself. Their first single for their new label, titled \"[[Sky High (song)|Sky High]]\", was recorded for the film ''[[The Man from Hong Kong]]'', a 1975 martial-arts action movie starring [[George Lazenby]]. Splash pressed a couple of hundred promotional copies and reaction to the song was good, especially from Radio Luxembourg which began playing the song with high rotation during its nightly English pop music broadcasts to the UK. \"Sky High\" subsequently made the UK Top 10 in November 1975. The recording was licensed to [[Chelsea Records]] in the United States where it reached #3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and to #2 [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]].  The song was also #1 in [[Japan]]. A famous Mexican [[Lucha libre|wrestler]], [[Mil M\u00e1scaras]], used \"Sky High\" as his theme tune. He would walk to the ring with the song playing in the background, and his popularity in Japan helped \"Sky High\" to become a hit twice over in that country in consecutive years.\n\nThe ''Sky High'' album also sold well too, especially in Japan. The next single \"Love Fire\" was another hit, although not in the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, \"Love Fire\"  was followed by two new albums, one for the British market called ''Pieces of Magic'' and another for the American market simply named, ''Jigsaw''.\n\nIn 1977, the band recorded an album ''Journey into Space'' in Los Angeles. Years later, Clive Scott revealed in an interview that the record label [[20th Century Records]] paid for the band to fly out to make the album, paid for their accommodation, and gave them cash advances (or, as Scott called it, \"[[wikt:pocket money|pocket money]]\") to live off for three months while making the record. The album was produced by Rick Jarrard who was the producer of [[Jose Feliciano]] and the person responsible for putting together Elvis Presley's Las Vegas band. However, the album was never released, much to the frustration of the group.\n\nJigsaw returned to Britain and scored another hit with the single \"If I Have To Go Away\", after which they recorded ten original songs for the film ''Home Before Midnight''.\n\n==Break-up==\nBernard left the band in 1978 and was replaced by Jon Fox. Campbell also left the band in 1979 and was replaced by Rod Godwin. The band ceased touring in 1981 but Scott and Dyer continued to record using Tim Stone on guitar and Pete Dennis on bass. This new group lineup recorded one album for [[Elektra Records|Elektra]]. The album, a disco influenced set (that was never released in the [[United Kingdom]]) was issued in the [[United States]] the following year.  A final single under the Jigsaw name was released by Splash in early 1983 called \"Love Isn't at Home\".\n\nFollowing the group split, Scott and Dyer continued to be successful songwriters, having their work recorded by [[Nicki French]], [[Bad Boys Inc]], [[Boyzone]], [[Jon Otis (musician)|Jon Otis]], [[Bobby Rydell]], and many others. After leaving his music career behind when he quit Jigsaw in 1979, Tony Campbell went back to his first occupation, ophthalmic engineering. He had a family. One of his daughters created and manages the Royal Academy of Dance dance school in Rugby, Warwickshire. Barrie Bernard continued to work in the entertainment business, running [[night club]]s and being an active [[Magician (illusion)|magician]]. Though no new studio albums have been issued, eight newly recorded songs were included on a 1995 compilation CD, entitled ''The Best of Jigsaw'', just one of the collections of their music released. Dyer has twice attempted to represent the UK at the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], taking part in the 1983 and 1985 [[A Song For Europe]] competitions. In 1983, he placed third as lead singer of the group Casablanca with the song \"With Love\". Two years later, as a soloist, he took \"Energy\" to fourth place. The song from 1985, \"Energy\", was reworked to become the album track \"Voice of America\" and sung by [[Nicki French]] for her first studio album \"Secrets\". In 1988, Dyer provided backing vocals at the [[Eurovision]] final alongside Julie Forsyth and Dominic Grant, both formerly of [[Guys 'n' Dolls]], for the UK entry performed by [[Scott Fitzgerald (singer)|Scott Fitzgerald]], \"Go\". This song placed second in the contest held in [[Dublin]] on 30 April. The UK lost by one point to [[Celine Dion]], representing Switzerland with \"Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi\" (Don't Leave Without Me).\n\nMuch has also been made about their lack of success in the UK charts, where only two of their singles made the Top 40. It has been suggested this was because [[BBC Radio 1]], the most popular station in the UK at the time, gave little or no airplay to their singles after \"Sky High\" in 1975.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} However, the group lasted a long time and were big stars in Japan, as well as having four [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] hit singles in the U.S. Their music is also still in print on [[compact disc]], enjoying healthy sales.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The sleeve notes to their 1998 Greatest Hits collection, ''The Very Best of Jigsaw'' stated \"A look at Jigsaw\u2019s songs reveals the innovative work of its creators: the advanced song structure, the clever use of classical techniques like counterpoint and a novel approach to using sound effects \u2013 leaving the listener with a sadly-overlooked-but-very-impressive catalogue of melodic pop songs\".\n\nFounding member Clive Scott died on 10 May 2009.<ref>[http://www.thedeadrockstarsclub.com/2009.html Deadrockstarsclub.com - accessed May 2009]</ref> He had an accident at home two weeks earlier and never recovered, despite having brain surgery.

{"title_page": "United States Indian Police", "text_new": "[[Image:US Indian Police badge.png|thumb|U.S. Indian Police badge ca. 1890]]\n{{Law enforcement in the United States}}\nThe '''United States Indian Police''' (USIP) were organized in 1880 by [[John Q. Tufts]] the Indian Commissioner in [[Muskogee, Oklahoma|Muskogee]], [[Indian Territory]], to police the [[Five Civilized Tribes]]. Their mission is to \"provide justice services and technical assistance to federally recognized Indian tribes.\"<ref name=\"bia.gov\">https://bia.gov/WhoWeAre/BIA/OJS/ojs-services/index.htm</ref> The USIP, after its founding in 1880, recruited many of their police officers from the ranks of the existing [[Lighthorse (American Indian police)|Indian Lighthorsemen]]. Unlike the Lighthorse who were under the direction of the individual tribe, the USIP was under the direction of the [[Indian agent]] assigned to the Union Agency. Many of the US Indian police officers were given [[United States Marshals Service|Deputy U.S. Marshal]] commissions that allowed them to cross jurisdictional boundaries and also to arrest non-Indians.\n\n==United States Indian Police Academy==\nThe '''United States Indian Police Academy''' was originally established as the United States Indian Police Training and Research Center in Roswell, New Mexico on December 17, 1968. The program was administered by the Thiokol Chemical Corporation during the academy's period in Roswell and specialized to include the training of juvenile detention, criminal investigation and supervisors. In 1973, the academy was relocated to Brigham City, Utah to be combined with the Division of Law and Order Research and Statistical Unit from Pierre, South Dakota. The result was the creation of the Center for U.S. Indian Police Training and Research. The academy relocated to Marana, Arizona in 1984. In 1993, it was relocated again to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center grounds in Artesia, New Mexico, where it remains to this day.\n\nToday, the United States Indian Police Academy caters their training to the needs of the Indian Country Justice Services. The academy is designed to teach future USIP officers how to fulfill the unit's mission to \"prevent crimes, reduce recidivism, and support tribal justice systems.\" <ref name=\"bia.gov\"/> The positions generally filled by graduates include police officers, correctional officers, criminal investigators, tribal court staff and telecommunication equipment operators. Steven Juneau is the current Academy Director and Osceola Red Shirt is the Deputy Academy Director.<ref>https://www.indianaffairs.gov/cs/groups/xojs/documents/text/idc2-061311.pdf</ref>\n\n==Jurisdiction==\n{{main|Tribal sovereignty in the United States}}\nThe USIP was given authority over cases of manslaughter, murder, assault, rape, arson, and burglary in Native American communities with the passage of the Major Crimes Act of 1885, now codified as 18 U.S.C. 1153. However, the role of the USIP was often unclear and there was a continual need for new acts to increase its jurisdiction because of a lack of prior planning. The power of the United States Indian Police to arrest whites, half-Indians and those outside the reservation of their jurisdiction were continually challenged. This power was questioned in the case of U.S. v. Clapox, but the decision was left unclear. Maintenance of prohibition in Indian territory was passed in what is now 18 USC 1152, 1156, and 1161. These being passed further gave the USIP jurisdiction over non-Indians as the majority of bootleggers were Caucasian, though most of those arrested by the officers were their Native American customers who did not have the same access to quality attorneys. The 1913 Appropriation Act gave United States Indian Police the same powers as U.S. Marshals. The Johnson v. Gerald's case, 234 U.S. 422, further solidified the confiscation powers of the USIP in a decision about whether it was the place of the USIP to take or destroy Indian-made beverages or products.<ref name=\"tribal-institute.org\">http://www.tribal-institute.org/download/Indian%20Law%20Enforcement%20History.pdf</ref>\n\n==Pre-USIP law enforcement==\nWhile some tribes later policed by the United States Indian Police did not give individuals law enforcement responsibilities and made order a community effort, others had institutions similar to police. The [[Muscogee]] Creek had an organization whose purpose was to enforce the laws created by the tribe. The group was composed of warriors who had reached a certain level of renown. The [[Cherokee]] had both their own form of police, the Lighthorse, and the court system. In fact, the attempt to replace the pre-existing law enforcement of the Native American tribes was marked by opposition from many tribes. The Commissioner received a letter from an agent of another Indian police force about the difficulties he'd met with Sioux opposition.  \"[T]here have existed among the Sioux and other tribes, native soldier organizations systematically governed by laws and regulations. Some of the opposition encountered in endeavoring to organize the police force in the spring of 1879 was from these native soldier organizations.\"<ref name=\"tribal-institute.org\"/>\n\n==Interaction with outlaws==\nOne of the major set-backs for the United States Indian Police was the activity of prominent Western outlaw gangs, including the Cooks, the Starrs and the Daltons. One of the members of the [[Dalton gang]], Bob Dalton, used his position as Chief of the Osage Police to the benefit of his and his gang's bootlegging careers. The Dalton Gang was also well known for murder and bank and train robberies,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-dalton-gang-is-wiped-out-in-coffeyville-kansas|title=The Dalton Gang is wiped out in Coffeyville, Kansas - Oct 05, 1892 - HISTORY.com|publisher=}}</ref> using Indian Territory to evade Oklahoma officers. These groups would often fire upon USIP officers so as not to be captured and their bootlegging drew Native Americans under USIP jurisdiction into criminal activity as they consumed illegal goods the groups smuggled in. The outlaw problem became so dire that, in 1895, the Indian policy for officers included instructions for how to handle outlaws: \"Arrest all outlaws, thieves, and murderers in your section, and if they resist you will shoot them on the spot.\" <ref name=\"tribal-institute.org\"/>\n\n==Sam Sixkiller==\n'''Sam Sixkiller''' was a former High Sheriff of the Cherokee Nation who was recruited to become the Captain of the US Indian Police in 1880. In 1886 two Indians killed [[Sam Sixkiller]], the Captain of the US Indian Police and a Deputy US Marshal commissioned by the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas|Judicial District of Western Arkansas]]. He was known for surviving multiple gun battles over six years of service, he was unarmed when he shot on a Christmas Eve. After the killers escaped indictment by the Creek and Cherokee, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed a law (24 Stat., 463.) giving the [[United States district court]]s jurisdiction over any Indian who committed a crime against a federally appointed Indian police officer or United States Deputy Marshal. His death also resulted in a law making it a Federal offense to kill an Indian police officer, which is still in effect. (18 U.S.C. 1114.)\n\n==Other Indian police==\n\nThere were basically two other types of police officers on the reservations:\n* [[Indian tribal police]]\n*: Several Indian tribes replaced hereditary chiefs with constitutional governments. These tribes hired police officers under a number of different titles\u2014sheriffs, constables, regulators, lighthorsemen, etc.\u2014to enforce tribal laws.\n* [[Indian agency police]]\n*: Many tribes had no recognizable governments and therefore no tribal laws. On these reservations, the Indian agent assigned to the tribe hired Indian police from among tribal members to effect law and order according to Federal, agency, and treaty rules. These were considered federally appointed police officers. The Indian police that killed [[Sitting Bull]] were of this kind.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of federal law enforcement agencies]]\n* [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol1/HTML_files/SES0036.html Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties.

The Dalton Gang was also well known for murder and bank and train robberies,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-dalton-gang-is-wiped-out-in-coffeyville-kansas|title=The Dalton Gang is wiped out in Coffeyville, Kansas - Oct 05, 1892 - HISTORY.com|publisher=}}</ref> using Indian Territory to evade Oklahoma officers. These groups would often fire upon USIP officers so as not to be captured and their bootlegging drew Native Americans under USIP jurisdiction into criminal activity as they consumed illegal goods the groups smuggled in. The outlaw problem became so dire that, in 1895, the Indian policy for officers included instructions for how to handle outlaws: \"Arrest all outlaws, thieves, and murderers in your section, and if they resist you will shoot them on the spot.\" <ref name=\"tribal-institute.org\"/>\n\n==Sam Sixkiller==\n'''Sam Sixkiller''' was a former High Sheriff of the Cherokee Nation who was recruited to become the Captain of the US Indian Police in 1880. In 1886 two Indians killed [[Sam Sixkiller]], the Captain of the US Indian Police and a Deputy US Marshal commissioned by the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas|Judicial District of Western Arkansas]]. He was known for surviving multiple gun battles over six years of service, he was unarmed when he shot on a Christmas Eve. After the killers escaped indictment by the Creek and Cherokee, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed a law (24 Stat., 463.) giving the [[United States district court]]s jurisdiction over any Indian who committed a crime against a federally appointed Indian police officer or United States Deputy Marshal. His death also resulted in a law making it a Federal offense to kill an Indian police officer, which is still in effect. (18 U.S.C. 1114.)\n\n==Other Indian police==\n\nThere were basically two other types of police officers on the reservations:\n* [[Indian tribal police]]\n*: Several Indian tribes replaced hereditary chiefs with constitutional governments. These tribes hired police officers under a number of different titles\u2014sheriffs, constables, regulators, lighthorsemen, etc.\u2014to enforce tribal laws.\n* [[Indian agency police]]\n*: Many tribes had no recognizable governments and therefore no tribal laws. On these reservations, the Indian agent assigned to the tribe hired Indian police from among tribal members to effect law and order according to Federal, agency, and treaty rules. These were considered federally appointed police officers. The Indian police that killed [[Sitting Bull]] were of this kind.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of federal law enforcement agencies]]\n* [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol1/HTML_files/SES0036.html Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties.

In the 13th century the Chinese invented the metal-barrelled [[hand cannon]], widely considered{{by whom|date=August 2018}} the true ancestor of all firearms.  The technology gradually spread through the rest of [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]], the [[Middle East]], and Europe. Older firearms typically used [[Gunpowder|black powder]] as a propellant, but modern firearms use [[smokeless powder]] or other propellants. Most modern firearms (with the notable exception of [[smoothbore]] [[shotgun]]s) have [[rifling|rifled]] barrels to impart spin to the [[projectile]] for improved flight stability.\n\nModern firearms can be described by their [[caliber]] (i.e. their bore diameter; this is given in millimeters or inches e.g. 7.5&nbsp;mm, .357 in.) or in the case of shotguns by their [[Gauge (bore diameter)|gauge]] (e.g. 12 ga.); by the type of action employed (muzzleloader, breechloader, lever, bolt, pump, revolver, [[semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]], [[automatic firearm|fully automatic]], etc.) together with the usual means of deportment (hand-held or mechanical mounting). Further classification may make reference to the type of barrel used (rifled) and to the barrel length (24 inch), to the firing mechanism (e.g. [[matchlock]], [[wheellock]], [[flintlock]], [[percussion lock]]), to the design's primary intended use (e.g. hunting rifle), or to the commonly accepted name for a particular variation (e.g. [[Gatling gun]]).\n\nShooters aim firearms at their targets with [[hand-eye coordination]], using either [[iron sights]] or  [[Telescopic sight|optical sights]]. The accurate range of pistols generally does not exceed {{convert|110|yd|m}}, while most rifles are accurate to {{convert|500|m|yd|order= flip}} using iron sights, or to longer ranges using optical sights (firearm rounds may be dangerous or lethal well beyond their accurate range; the minimum distance for safety is much greater than the specified range). Purpose-built [[sniper rifle]]s and [[anti-materiel rifle]]s are accurate to ranges of more than {{convert|2000|m|yd|order=flip}}.\n\n{{TOC Limit|4}}\n\n==Types==\nFirearms include a variety of ranged weapons and there is no agreed-upon definition.\n\n===Configuration===\n{{for|a more detailed list of common firearms|List of firearms|List of most-produced firearms|Small Arms and Light Weapons}}\n\nThe term \"'''small arms'''\" generally refers to any [[projectile#Kinetic projectiles|kinetic-projectile]] firearm small and light enough to be carried and operated by a single infantryman.

Revolvers have a number of firing chambers or \"charge holes\" in a revolving cylinder; each chamber in the cylinder is loaded with a single [[cartridge (firearms) |cartridge]] or charge. Semi-automatic pistols have a single fixed firing-chamber machined into the rear of the barrel, and a magazine so they can be used to fire more than one round. Each press of the trigger fires a cartridge, using the energy of the cartridge to activate a mechanism so that the next cartridge may be fired immediately. This is opposed to \"[[double-action]]\" revolvers, which accomplish the same end using a mechanical action linked to the trigger pull.\n\nWith the invention of the revolver in 1818, handguns capable of holding multiple rounds became popular. Certain designs of auto-loading pistol appeared beginning in the 1870s and had largely supplanted revolvers in military applications by the end of World War I. By the end of the 20th century, most handguns carried regularly by military, police and civilians were semi-automatic, although revolvers were still widely used. Generally speaking, military and police forces use semi-automatic pistols due to their high magazine capacities and ability to rapidly reload by simply removing the empty magazine and inserting a loaded one. Revolvers are very common among handgun hunters because revolver cartridges are usually more powerful than similar caliber semi-automatic pistol cartridges (which are designed for [[self-defense]]) and the strength, simplicity and durability of the revolver design is well-suited to outdoor use. Revolvers, especially in [[.22 LR]] and 38 Special/357 Magnum, are also common [[Concealed carry in the United States|concealed weapons]] in jurisdictions allowing this practice because their simple mechanics make them smaller than many autoloaders while remaining reliable. Both designs are common among civilian gun owners, depending on the owner's intention (self-defense, hunting, target shooting, competitions, collecting, etc.).\n\n====Long guns====\n{{main|Long gun}}\nA long gun is generally any firearm that is larger than a handgun and is designed to be held and fired with both hands, while braced against either the hip or the shoulder for better stability.  Long guns typically have a barrel length from {{convert|10|to|30|in|mm}} (there are restrictions on minimum barrel length in many jurisdictions; maximum barrel length is usually a matter of practicality), that along with the receiver and trigger group is mounted into a wood, plastic, metal or composite ''stock'', composed of one or more pieces that form a foregrip, rear grip, and optionally (but typically) a shoulder mount called the ''butt''. Early long arms, from the Renaissance up to the mid-19th century, were generally smoothbore firearms that fired one or more ball shot, called [[musket]]s or [[arquebus]] depending on caliber and firing mechanism.\n\n=====Rifles and shotguns=====\n{{main|Rifle|Shotgun}}\n[[File:Rifle Springfield M1903.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Springfield Armory [[M1903 Springfield|M1903 rifle]]]]\nMost modern [[long gun]]s are either [[rifle]]s or [[shotgun]]s. Both are the successors of the musket, diverging from their parent weapon in distinct ways. A rifle is so named for the spiral fluting ([[rifling]]) machined into the inner surface of its barrel, which imparts a self-stabilizing spin to the single [[bullet]]s it fires. Shotguns are predominantly [[smoothbore]] firearms designed to fire a number of ''[[Shot (pellet)|shot]]''; pellet sizes commonly ranging between 2&nbsp;mm #9 birdshot and 8.4&nbsp;mm #00 (double-aught) buckshot. Shotguns are also capable of firing single [[shotgun slug|slugs]], or specialty (often \"[[Non-lethal weapon|less lethal]]\") rounds such as [[Bean bag round|bean bags]], tear gas or [[breaching round]]s. Rifles have a very small impact area but a long range and high accuracy. Shotguns have a large impact area with considerably less range and accuracy. However, the larger impact area can compensate for reduced accuracy, since [[Shotgun shell#Spread|shot spreads]] during flight; consequently, in hunting, shotguns are generally used for flying game.\n\nRifles and shotguns are commonly used for hunting and often to defend a home or place of business. Usually, large game are hunted with rifles (although shotguns can be used, particularly with slugs), while birds are hunted with shotguns. Shotguns are sometimes preferred for defending a home or business due to their wide impact area, multiple wound tracks (when using buckshot), shorter range, and reduced penetration of walls (when using lighter shot), which significantly reduces the likelihood of unintended harm, although the handgun is also common.\n\n[[File:3-7 Shooting Competition (Image 2 of 4) (12753731154).jpg|thumb|left|A [[United States Marine]] armed with a [[Mossberg 500]] shotgun]]\nThere are a variety of types of rifles and shotguns based on the method they are reloaded. Bolt-action and lever-action rifles are manually operated. Manipulation of the bolt or the lever causes the spent cartridge to be removed, the firing mechanism recocked, and a fresh cartridge inserted. These two types of action are almost exclusively used by rifles. Slide-action (commonly called 'pump-action') rifles and shotguns are manually cycled by shuttling the foregrip of the firearm back and forth. This type of action is typically used by shotguns, but several major manufacturers make rifles that use this action.\n\nBoth rifles and shotguns also come in break-action varieties that do not have any kind of reloading mechanism at all but must be hand-loaded after each shot. Both rifles and shotguns come in single- and double-barreled varieties; however due to the expense and difficulty of manufacturing, double-barreled rifles are rare. Double-barreled rifles are typically intended for African big-game hunts where the animals are dangerous, ranges are short, and speed is of the essence. Very large and powerful calibers are normal for these firearms.\n\nRifles have been in nationally featured marksmanship events in Europe and the United States since at least the 18th century, when rifles were first becoming widely available. One of the earliest purely \"American\" rifle-shooting competitions took place in 1775, when Daniel Morgan was recruiting sharpshooters in Virginia for the impending [[American Revolutionary War]]. In some countries, rifle marksmanship is still a matter of national pride. Some specialized rifles in the larger calibers are claimed to have an accurate range of up to about {{convert|1|mi|m}}, although most have considerably less. In the second half of the 20th century, competitive shotgun sports became perhaps even more popular than riflery, largely due to the motion and immediate feedback in activities such as skeet, trap and sporting clays.\n\nIn military use, bolt-action rifles with high-power scopes are common as sniper rifles, however by the [[Korean War]] the traditional bolt-action and semi-automatic rifles used by infantrymen had been supplemented by select-fire designs known as [[automatic rifle]]s.\n\n=====Carbines=====\n{{main|Carbine}}\nA carbine is a firearm similar to a rifle in form and intended usage, but generally shorter or smaller than the typical \"full-size\" hunting or battle rifle of a similar time period, and sometimes using a smaller or less-powerful cartridge. Carbines were and are typically used by members of the military in roles that are expected to engage in combat, but where a full-size rifle would be an impediment to the primary duties of that soldier (vehicle drivers, field commanders and support staff, airborne troops, engineers, etc.). Carbines are also common in law enforcement and among civilian owners where similar size, space and/or power concerns may exist. Carbines, like rifles, can be single-shot, repeating-action, semi-automatic or select-fire/fully automatic, generally depending on the time period and intended market. Common historical examples include the [[Winchester Model 1892]], Lee\u2013Enfield \"[[Jungle Carbine]]\", [[SKS]], [[M1 carbine]] (no relation to the larger [[M1 Garand]]) and [[M4 carbine]] (a more compact variant of the current [[M16 rifle]]). Modern U.S. civilian carbines include compact customizations of the [[AR-15]], [[Ruger Mini-14]], [[Beretta Cx4 Storm]], [[Kel-Tec SUB-2000]], bolt-action rifles generally falling under the specifications of a [[scout rifle]], and aftermarket conversion kits for popular pistols including the [[M1911 pistol|M1911]] and [[Glock]] models.\n\n=====Machine guns=====\n{{main|Machine gun}}\n[[File:MG42 Sideview.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[MG 42]] general-purpose machine gun with retracted bipod]]\nA machine gun is a fully [[automatic firearm]], most often separated from other classes of automatic weapons by the use of belt-fed ammunition (though some designs employ drum, pan or hopper magazines), generally in a rifle-inspired caliber ranging between [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] (.223 Remington) for a [[light machine gun]] to as large as [[.50 BMG]] or even larger for crewed or aircraft weapons. Although not widely fielded until World War I, early machine guns were being used by militaries in the second half of the 19th century. Notables in the U.S. arsenal during the 20th century included the [[M2 Browning]] .50 caliber heavy machine gun, [[M1919 Browning machine gun|M1919 Browning]] .30 caliber medium machine gun, and the [[M60 machine gun|M60]] [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] general-purpose machine gun which came into use around the Vietnam War. Machine guns of this type were originally defensive firearms crewed by at least two men, mainly because of the difficulties involved in moving and placing them, their ammunition, and their tripod. In contrast, modern [[light machine gun]]s such as the [[FN Minimi]] are often wielded by a single infantryman. They provide a large ammunition capacity and a high rate of fire, and are typically used to give suppressing fire during infantry movement. Accuracy on machine guns varies based on a wide number of factors from design to manufacturing tolerances, most of which have been improved over time. Machine guns are often mounted on vehicles or helicopters, and have been used since World War I as offensive firearms in fighter aircraft and tanks (e.g. for air combat or suppressing fire for ground troop support).\n\nThe definition of machine gun is different in U.S. law. The [[National Firearms Act]] and [[Firearm Owners Protection Act]] define a \"machine gun\" in the United States code ''Title 26, Subtitle E, Chapter 53, Subchapter B, Part 1, \u00a7 5845'' as:\n\"... any firearm which shoots ... automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger\". \"Machine gun\" is therefore largely synonymous with \"automatic weapon\" in the U.S. civilian parlance, covering all automatic firearms.\n\n=====Sniper rifles=====\n{{main|Sniper rifle}}\n[[File:G22 ohne Schalldaempfer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Accuracy International]] [[Accuracy International Arctic Warfare|Arctic Warfare]] series of sniper rifles is standard issue in the armies of several countries, including those of Britain, Ireland, and Germany (picture shows a rifle of the [[German Army]]).]]\nThe definition of a sniper rifle is disputed among military, police and civilian observers alike, however most generally define a \u201csniper rifle\u201d as a high powered, semi-automatic/bolt action, precision rifle with an accurate range further than that of a standard rifle. These are often purpose-built for their applications. For example, a police sniper rifle may differ in specs from a military rifle. Police snipers generally do not engage targets at extreme range, but rather, a target at medium range. They may also have multiple targets within the shorter range, and thus a semi-automatic model is preferred to a bolt action. They also may be more compact than milspec rifles as police marksmen may need more portability. On the other hand, a military rifle is more likely to use a higher powered cartridge to defeat body armor or medium-light cover. They are more commonly (but not a lot more) bolt-action, as they are simpler to build and maintain. Also, due to fewer moving and overall parts, they are much more reliable under adverse conditions. They may also have a more powerful scope to acquire targets further away. Overall, sniper units never became prominent until [[World War 1]], when the Germans displayed their usefulness on the battlefield. Since then, they have become irrevocably embedded in warfare. Examples of sniper rifles include the [[Accuracy International AWM]], [[Sako TRG-42]] and the [[CheyTac M200]]. Examples of specialized sniper cartridges include the [[.338 Lapua Magnum]], [[.300 Winchester Magnum]], and [[.408 CheyTac]] rounds.\n\n=====Submachine guns=====\n{{main|Submachine gun}}\n[[File:Skorpion PICT0107.jpg|thumb|right|Czechoslovak 7.65 mm [[submachine gun]] [[\u0160korpion vz. 61]] designed in 1959.]]\nA submachine gun is a magazine-fed firearm, usually smaller than other automatic firearms, that fires [[pistol]]-caliber ammunition; for this reason certain submachine guns can also be referred to as ''machine pistols'', especially when referring to handgun-sized designs such as the [[\u0160korpion vz. 61]] and [[Glock#9\u00d719mm Parabellum|Glock 18]]. Well-known examples are the Israeli [[Uzi]] and [[Heckler & Koch MP5]] which use the [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] cartridge, and the American [[Thompson submachine gun]] which fires [[.45 ACP]]. Because of their small size and limited projectile penetration compared to high-power rifle rounds, submachine guns are commonly favored by military, paramilitary and police forces for close-quarters engagements such as inside buildings, in urban areas or in trench complexes.\n\nSubmachine guns were originally about the size of carbines. Because they fire pistol ammunition, they have limited long-range use, but in close combat can be used in fully automatic in a controllable manner due to the lighter recoil of the pistol ammunition. They are also extremely inexpensive and simple to build in time of war, enabling a nation to quickly arm its military. In the latter half of the 20th century, submachine guns were being miniaturized to the point of being only slightly larger than some large handguns. The most widely used submachine gun at the end of the 20th century was the Heckler & Koch MP5. The MP5 is actually designated as a \"machine pistol\" by Heckler & Koch (MP5 stands for ''Maschinenpistole 5'', or Machine Pistol 5), although some reserve this designation for even smaller submachine guns such as the MAC-10 and [[Glock#9\u00d719mm Parabellum|Glock 18]], which are about the size and shape of pistols.\n\n=====Automatic rifles=====\n{{main|Automatic rifle}}\nAn automatic rifle is a magazine-fed firearm, wielded by a single infantryman, that is chambered for rifle cartridges and capable of automatic fire. The [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle]] was the first U.S. infantry weapon of this type, and was generally used for suppressive or support fire in the role now usually filled by the [[light machine gun]]. Other early automatic rifles include the [[Fedorov Avtomat]] and the [[Huot Automatic Rifle]]. Later, German forces fielded the [[StG 44|Sturmgewehr 44]] during [[World War II]], a light automatic rifle firing a reduced power \"[[intermediate cartridge]]\". This design was to become the basis for the \"[[assault rifle]]\" subclass of automatic weapons, as contrasted with \"[[battle rifle]]s\", which generally fire a traditional \"full-power\" rifle cartridge.\n\n=====Assault rifles=====\n{{main|Assault rifle}}\n[[File:AK-47 assault rifle.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[AK-47]], one of the most widely produced and used assault rifles in the world.]]\nIn [[World War II]], Germany introduced the [[StG 44]], and brought to the forefront of firearm technology what eventually became the class of firearm most widely adopted by the military, the assault rifle. An assault rifle is usually slightly smaller than a [[battle rifle]] such as the American M14, but the chief differences defining an assault rifle are [[Selective fire|select-fire capability]] and the use of a rifle round of lesser power, known as an [[intermediate cartridge]].\n\nSoviet engineer [[Mikhail Kalashnikov]] quickly adapted the German concept, using a less-powerful 7.62\u00d739mm cartridge derived from the standard 7.62\u00d754mmR Russian battle rifle round, to produce the [[AK-47]], which has become the world's most widely used assault rifle. Soon after World War II, the Automatic Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifle began to be fielded by the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies in the Eastern Bloc, as well as by nations such as China, North Korea, and North Vietnam.\n\nIn the United States, the assault rifle design was later in coming; the replacement for the M1 Garand of WWII was another John Garand design chambered for the new [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] cartridge; the select-fire [[M14 rifle|M14]], which was used by the U.S. military until the 1960s. The significant recoil of the M14 when fired in full-automatic mode was seen as a problem as it reduced accuracy, and in the 1960s it was replaced by [[Eugene Stoner]]'s [[AR-15]], which also marked a switch from the powerful .30 caliber cartridges used by the U.S. military up until early in the Vietnam War to the much less powerful but far lighter and light recoiling .223 caliber (5.56mm) [[intermediate cartridge]]. The military later designated the AR-15 as the \"[[M16 rifle|M16]]\". The civilian version of the M16 continues to be known as the AR-15 and looks exactly like the military version, although to conform to [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|B.A.T.F.E.]] regulations in the U.S., it lacks the mechanism that permits fully automatic fire.\n\nVariants of both of the M16 and AK-47 are still in wide international use today, though other automatic rifle designs have since been introduced. A smaller version of the M16A2, the [[M4 carbine]], is widely used by U.S. and NATO tank and vehicle crews, airbornes, support staff, and in other scenarios where space is limited. The [[IMI Galil]], an Israeli-designed weapon based on the action of the AK-47, is in use by Israel, Italy, Burma, the Philippines, Peru, and Colombia. [[Swiss Arms]] of Switzerland produces the [[SIG SG 550]] assault rifle used by France, Chile, and Spain among others, and [[Steyr Mannlicher]] produces the [[Steyr AUG|AUG]], a [[bullpup]] rifle in use in Austria, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and Saudi Arabia among other nations.\n\nModern designs call for compact weapons retaining firepower. The bullpup design, by mounting the magazine behind the trigger, unifies the accuracy and firepower of the traditional assault rifle with the compact size of the submachine gun (though submachine guns are still used); examples are the French [[FAMAS]] and the British [[SA80]].\n\n=====Personal defense weapons=====\n{{main|Personal defense weapon}}\n[[File:FN-P90 2.jpg|thumb|[[FN P90]] PDW]]\nA recently developed class of firearm is the [[personal defense weapon]] or PDW, which is in simplest terms a [[submachine gun]] designed to fire ammunitions with ballistic performance similar to rifle cartridges.  While a submachine gun is desirable for its compact size and ammunition capacity, its pistol cartridges lack the penetrating capability of a rifle round.  Conversely, rifle bullets can pierce light armor and are easier to shoot accurately, but even a [[carbine]] such as the Colt M4 is larger and/or longer than a submachine gun, making it harder to maneuver in close quarters.  The solution many firearms manufacturers have presented is a weapon resembling a submachine gun in size and general configuration, but which fires a higher-powered armor-penetrating round (often specially designed for the weapon), thus combining the advantages of a carbine and submachine gun.  This also earned the PDWs an infrequently used nickname \u2014 the submachine carbines.  The [[FN P90]] and [[Heckler & Koch MP7]] are most famous examples of PDWs.\n\n=====Battle rifles=====\n{{main|Battle rifle}}\n\n[[File:Scar H Standard.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Belgium|Belgian]] [[FN SCAR#SCAR-H|FN SCAR-H]]]]\n\nBattle rifles are another subtype of rifle, usually defined as [[selective fire]] rifles that use full power rifle cartridges, examples of which include the [[7.62x51mm NATO]], [[7.92x57mm Mauser]], and [[7.62x54mmR]]. These serve similar purposes to assault rifles, as they both are usually employed by ground infantry. However, some prefer battle rifles due to their more powerful cartridge, despite added recoil. Some semi-automatic sniper rifles are configured from battle rifles.\n\n===Function===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{main|Firearm action}}\nFirearms are also categorized by their functioning cycle or \"action\" which describes its loading, firing, and unloading cycle.\n\n====Manual====\nThe earliest evolution of the firearm, there are many types of manual action firearms. These can be divided into two basic categories: [[single shot]] and [[Repeating rifle|repeating]].\n\nA single shot firearm can only be fired once per equipped barrel before it must be reloaded or charged via an external mechanism or series of steps. A repeating firearm can be fired multiple times, but can only be fired once with each subsequent pull of the trigger. Between trigger pulls, the firearm's action must be reloaded or charged via an internal mechanism.\n\n====Lever action====\nA gun which has a lever that you pull down then back up to load.\n\n====Pump action====\nPump action weapons are primarily shotguns. A pump action is created when you slide a lever (usually a grip) and it brings a new round in the chamber while expelling the old one.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pump-action | title=Definition of PUMP-ACTION}}</ref>\n\n====Semi-automatic====\n{{main|Semi-automatic firearm}}\nA semi-automatic, self-loading, or \"auto loader\" firearm is one that performs all steps necessary to prepare it for firing again after a single discharge, until cartridges are no longer available in the weapon's feed device or magazine. Auto loaders fire one round with each pull of the trigger. Some people confuse the term with \"fully automatic\" firearms.  (See next.) While some semi-automatic rifles may resemble military-style firearms, they are not properly classified \"Assault Weapons\" which refers to those that continue to fire until the trigger is no longer depressed.\n\n====Automatic====\n{{main|Automatic firearm}}\nAn ''automatic'' firearm, or \"fully automatic\", \"fully auto\", or \"full auto\", is generally defined as one that continues to load and fire cartridges from its magazine as long as the trigger is depressed (and until the magazine is depleted of available ammunition.) The first weapon generally considered in this category is the [[Gatling gun]], originally a carriage-mounted, crank-operated firearm with multiple rotating barrels that was fielded in the [[American Civil War]]. The modern trigger-actuated machine gun began with various designs developed in the late 19th century and fielded in [[World War I]], such as the [[Maxim gun]], [[Lewis Gun]], and [[MG 08|MG 08 \"Spandau\"]]. Most automatic weapons are classed as long guns (as the ammunition used is of similar type as for rifles, and the recoil of the weapon's rapid fire is better controlled with two hands), but handgun-sized automatic weapons also exist, generally in the \"submachine gun\" or \"machine pistol\" class.\n\n====Selective fire====\n{{main|Selective fire}}\n'''Selective fire''', or \"select fire\", means the capability of a weapon's fire control to be adjusted in either semi-automatic, fully automatic firing modes, or 3 round burst.  The modes are chosen by means of a selector, which varies depending on the weapon's design.  Some selective-fire weapons have [[burst mode (weapons)|burst fire]] mechanisms built in to limit the maximum number of shots fired in fully automatic mode, with most common limits being two or three rounds per trigger pull.  The presence of selective-fire modes on firearms allows more efficient use of ammunition for specific tactical needs, either precision-aimed or [[suppressive fire]].  This capability is most commonly found on military weapons of the 20th and 21st centuries, most notably the [[assault rifle]]s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Yuan chinese gun.jpg|thumb|[[Hand cannon]] from the Chinese [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1271\u20131368).]]\n{{main|History of the firearm}}\n{{see also|History of gunpowder}}\nThe first primitive firearms were invented about 1250 AD in [[History of science and technology in China|China]] when the man-portable [[fire lance]] (a bamboo or metal tube that could shoot ignited [[gunpowder]]) was combined with projectiles such as scrap metal, broken porcelain, or darts/arrows.<ref name=\"Helaine\" /><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |author=Ho Peng Yoke |editor-first=Helaine |date=1997 |editor-last=Selin |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures |title=Gunpowder |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raKRY3KQspsC&pg=PA389 |access-date=30 July 2013 |language= |edition= |publisher=Springer |volume= |location= |id= |isbn=978-0-7923-4066-9 |oclc= |doi= |page=389 |quote= |ref= }}</ref>\n\nThe earliest depiction of a firearm is a sculpture from a cave in [[Sichuan]], China.

Breech-loading became more or less a universal standard for the reloading of most hand-held firearms and continues to be so with some notable exceptions (such as mortars). Instead of loading individual rounds into weapons, magazines holding multiple munitions were adopted\u2014these aided rapid reloading. Automatic and semi-automatic firing mechanisms meant that a single soldier could fire many more rounds in a minute than a vintage weapon could fire over the course of a battle. Polymers and alloys in firearm construction made weaponry progressively lighter and thus easier to deploy. Ammunition changed over the centuries from simple metallic ball-shaped projectiles that rattled down the barrel to bullets and cartridges manufactured to high precision. Especially in the past century has particular attention been devoted to accuracy and sighting to make firearms altogether far more accurate than ever before. More than any single factor though, firearms have proliferated due to the advent of mass production\u2014enabling arms manufacturers to produce large quantities of weaponry to a consistent standard.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nVelocities of bullets increased with the use of a \"jacket\" of a metal such as copper or copper alloys that covered a lead core and allowed the bullet to glide down the barrel more easily than exposed lead. Such bullets are designated as \"full metal jacket\" (FMJ). Such FMJ bullets are less likely to fragment on impact and are more likely to traverse through a target while imparting less energy. Hence, FMJ bullets impart less tissue damage than non-jacketed bullets that expand. (Dougherty and Eidt, 2009) This led to their adoption for military use by countries adhering to the Hague Convention in 1899.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThat said, the basic principle behind firearm operation remains unchanged to this day. A musket of several centuries ago is still similar in principle to a modern-day assault rifle\u2014using the expansion of gases to propel projectiles over long distances\u2014albeit less accurately and rapidly.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://allthingsliberty.com/2013/07/the-inaccuracy-of-muskets/|title=The Inaccuracy of Muskets |date=2013-07-15|work=Journal of the American Revolution|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Evolution===\n====Early models====\n=====Fire lances=====\n{{main|Fire lance}}\nThe Chinese [[fire lance]]{{when|date=August 2018}} was the direct predecessor to the modern concept of the firearm. It was not a gun itself, but an addition to the soldiers' spears. Originally it consisted of paper or bamboo barrels that would have incendiary gunpowder within it, that could be lit one time and would project flames at the enemy. Sometimes the Chinese troops would place small projectiles within the barrel that would also be projected when the gunpowder was lit, but most of the explosive force would create flames. Later, the barrel was changed to be made of metal, so that a more explosive gunpowder could be used and put more force into the propulsion of the projectile.<ref name=Chase />{{rp|31\u201332}}\n\n=====Hand cannons=====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{main|Hand cannon}}\n[[File:Lgehumble 1400.jpg|thumb|[[Hand cannon]] being fired from a stand, \"Belli Fortis\", manuscript, by Konrad Kyeser, 1400]]\nThe original predecessor of all firearms, the Chinese [[fire lance]]{{when|date=August 2018}} and [[hand cannon]] were loaded with gunpowder and the shot (initially [[lead shot]], later replaced by cast iron{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}) through the muzzle, while a fuse was placed at the rear. This fuse was lit, causing the gunpowder to ignite and propel the cannonball. In military use, the standard hand cannon was tremendously powerful, while also being somewhat useless{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} due to relative inability of the gunner to aim the weapon, or control the ballistic properties of the projectile. Recoil could be absorbed by bracing the barrel against the ground using a wooden support, the forerunner of the [[Stock (firearms)|stock]]. Neither the quality or amount of gunpowder, nor the consistency in projectile dimensions were controlled, with resulting inaccuracy in firing due to [[windage]], variance in gunpowder composition, and the difference in diameter between the [[Caliber|bore]] and the shot. The [[hand cannon]]s were replaced by lighter carriage-mounted [[artillery]] pieces, and ultimately the [[arquebus]].\n\n=====Muskets=====\n{{main|Musket}}\n[[File:Brown Bess.png|thumb|upright=1.35|A [[Brown Bess]] musket, used widely by the [[British Empire]] and some others during the 18th century.]]\n[[Muzzleloader|Muzzle-loading]] muskets (smooth-bored long guns) were among the first firearms developed.{{when|date=August 2018}} The firearm was loaded through the muzzle with gunpowder, optionally some wadding and then a bullet (usually a solid lead ball, but musketeers could shoot stones when they ran out of bullets). Greatly improved muzzleloaders (usually rifled instead of smooth-bored) are manufactured today and have many enthusiasts, many of whom hunt large and small game with their guns. Muzzleloaders have to be manually reloaded after each shot; a skilled archer could fire multiple arrows faster than most early muskets could be reloaded and fired, although by the mid-18th century, when muzzleloaders became the standard small armament of the military, a well-drilled soldier could fire six rounds in a minute using prepared cartridges in his musket. Before then, effectiveness of muzzleloaders was hindered by both the low reloading speed and, before the firing mechanism was perfected, the very high risk posed by the firearm to the person attempting to fire it.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nOne interesting solution to the reloading problem was the \"Roman Candle Gun\" with [[superposed load]]s. This was a muzzleloader in which multiple charges and balls were loaded one on top of the other, with a small hole in each ball to allow the subsequent charge to be ignited after the one ahead of it was ignited. It was neither a very reliable nor popular firearm, but it enabled a form of \"automatic\" fire long before the advent of the machine gun.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotwars.com/html/equip_firearms2.htm#3|title=Roman Candle Gun|work=Scotwars.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302211812/http://scotwars.com/html/equip_firearms2.htm|archivedate=March 2, 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Loading techniques====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{main|Muzzleloader}}\n[[File:Meyers b8 s0102a.jpg|220px|thumb|[[Percussion cap]] and early [[bolt action]] form]]\nMost early firearms were muzzle-loading. This form of loading has several disadvantages, such as a slow rate of fire and having to expose oneself to enemy fire to reload as the weapon had to be pointed upright so the powder could be poured through the muzzle into the breech followed by the ramming the projectile into the breech. As effective methods of sealing the breech were developed through the development of sturdy, weatherproof, self-contained metallic cartridges, muzzle-loaders were replaced by single-shot breech loaders. Eventually single-shot weapons were replaced by the following repeater type weapons.\n\n====Internal magazines====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{main|Magazine (firearms)}}\nMany firearms made in the late 19th century through the 1950s used internal magazines to load the cartridge into the chamber of the weapon. The most notable and revolutionary weapons of this period appeared during the U.S. Civil War and they were the [[Spencer rifle|Spencer]] and [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifles. Both used fixed tubular magazines, the former having the magazine in the buttstock and the latter under the barrel which allowed a larger capacity. Later weapons used fixed box magazines that could not be removed from the weapon without disassembling the weapon itself. Fixed magazines permitted the use of larger cartridges and eliminated the hazard of having the bullet of one cartridge butting next to the primer or rim of another cartridge. These magazines are loaded while they are in the weapon, often using a stripper clip. A clip is used to transfer cartridges into the magazine. Some notable weapons that use internal magazines include the [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]], the [[Mauser Kar 98k]], the [[Springfield M1903]], the [[M1 Garand]], and the [[SKS]]. Firearms that have internal magazines are usually, but not always, rifles. Some exceptions to this include the Mauser C96 pistol, which uses an internal magazine, and the [[Breda 30]], an Italian light machine gun.\n\n====Detachable magazines====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\nMany modern firearms use what are called detachable or box magazines as their method of chambering a cartridge. Detachable magazines can be removed from the weapon without disassembling the firearms, usually by pushing the magazine release.\n\n====Belt-fed weapons====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{main|Belt (firearm)}}\nA belt or ammunition belt is a device used to retain and feed cartridges into a firearm commonly used on machine guns. Belts were originally composed of canvas or cloth with pockets spaced evenly to allow the belt to be mechanically fed into the gun. These designs were prone to malfunctions due to the effects of oil and other contaminants altering the belt. Later belt designs used permanently connected metal links to retain the cartridges during feeding. These belts were more tolerant to exposure to solvents and oil. Some notable weapons that use belts are the M240, the M249, the M134 Minigun, and the PK Machine Gun.\n\n====Firing mechanisms====\n{{further|Trigger (firearms)|Firearm action}}\n\n=====Matchlock=====\n{{main|Matchlock}}\n[[File:Edo period rifles.jpg|thumb|left|Various Japanese (samurai) [[Edo period]] matchlocks (''tanegashima'').]]\n[[Matchlock]]s were the first and simplest firearms firing mechanisms developed. Using the matchlock mechanism, the powder in the gun barrel was ignited by a piece of burning cord called a \"match\". The match was wedged into one end of an S-shaped piece of steel. As the trigger (often actually a lever) was pulled, the match was brought into the open end of a \"touch hole\" at the base of the gun barrel, which contained a very small quantity of gunpowder, igniting the main charge of gunpowder in the gun barrel. The match usually had to be relit after each firing. The main parts to the matchlock firing mechanism are the pan, match, arm and trigger.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/move/musket |title=> Where Are You From? |publisher=Credo Reference |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref> A benefit of the pan and arm swivel being moved to the side of the gun was it gave a clear line of fire.<ref>Weir, William. 50 Weapons That Changed Warfare.

One disadvantage was if it was raining the match could not be kept lit to fire the weapon.  Another issue with the match was it could give away the position of soldiers because of the glow, sound, and smell.<ref>Saidel, Benjamin. \"Matchlocks, Flintlocks, and Saltpetre: The Chronological Implications for the Use of Matchlock Muskets among Ottoman-Period Bedouin in the Southern Levant.\" ''International Journal of Historical Archaeology'' 4 (2000): 191\u2013215.</ref>\n\n=====Wheellock=====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{main|Wheellock}}\n[[File:Wheellock for a firearm, 17th century, iron - Stadtmuseum Fembohaus - Nuremberg, Germany -DSC02125.jpg|right|thumb|A wheellock pistol mechanism from the 17th century]]\nThe [[wheellock]] action, a successor to the matchlock, predated the flintlock. Despite its many faults, the wheellock was a significant improvement over the matchlock in terms of both convenience and safety, since it eliminated the need to keep a smoldering match in proximity to loose gunpowder. It operated using a small wheel much like that on [[Lighter|cigarette lighters]] which was wound up with a key before use and which, when the trigger was pulled, spun against a flint, creating the shower of sparks that ignited the powder in the touch hole. Supposedly invented by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], the Italian [[Polymath|Renaissance man]], the wheellock action was an innovation that was not widely adopted due to the high cost of the clockwork mechanism.\n\n=====Flintlock=====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{main|Flintlock}}\n[[File:FlintlockMechanism.jpg|thumb|Flintlock mechanism]]\nThe [[flintlock]] action was a major innovation in firearm design. The spark used to ignite the gunpowder in the touch hole was supplied by a sharpened piece of flint clamped in the jaws of a \"cock\" which, when released by the trigger, struck a piece of steel called the \"[[frizzen]]\" to create the necessary sparks. (The spring-loaded arm that holds a piece of flint or pyrite is referred to as a cock because of its resemblance to a rooster.) The cock had to be manually reset after each firing, and the flint had to be replaced periodically due to wear from striking the frizzen. (See also [[flintlock mechanism]], [[snaphance]], [[Miquelet lock]]) The flintlock was widely used during the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries in both muskets and rifles.\n\n=====Percussion cap=====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{further|Percussion cap|Caplock mechanism}}\n[[Percussion cap]]s ([[caplock mechanism]]s), coming into wide service in the early 19th century, were a dramatic improvement over flintlocks. With the percussion cap mechanism, the small primer charge of gunpowder used in all preceding firearms was replaced by a completely self-contained explosive charge contained in a small brass \"cap\". The cap was fastened to the touch hole of the gun (extended to form a \"nipple\") and ignited by the impact of the gun's \"hammer\". (The hammer is roughly the same as the cock found on flintlocks except that it doesn't clamp onto anything.) In the case of percussion caps the hammer was hollow on the end to fit around the cap in order to keep the cap from fragmenting and injuring the shooter.\n\nOnce struck, the flame from the cap in turn ignited the main charge of gunpowder, as with the flintlock, but there was no longer any need to charge the touch hole with gunpowder, and even better, the touch hole was no longer exposed to the elements. As a result, the percussion cap mechanism was considerably safer, far more weatherproof, and vastly more reliable (cloth-bound cartridges containing a premeasured charge of gunpowder and a ball had been in regular military service for many years, but the exposed gunpowder in the entry to the touch hole had long been a source of misfires). All [[muzzleloader]]s manufactured since the second half of the 19th century use percussion caps except those built as replicas of the flintlock or earlier firearms.\n\n====Cartridges====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{main|Cartridge (firearms)}}\n{{further|Magazine (firearms)|Ammunition}}\n[[File:Snider-Martini-Enfield Cartridges.JPG|thumb|(From Left to Right): A [[.577 Snider]] cartridge (1867), a [[.577/450 Martini-Henry]] cartridge (1871), a later drawn brass .577/450 [[Martini-Henry]] cartridge, and a [[.303 British]] Mk VII SAA Ball cartridge.]]\n\nFrenchman [[Louis-Nicolas Flobert]] invented the first [[rimfire ammunition|rimfire metallic cartridge]] in 1845.

These cartridges have a relatively low muzzle velocity of around 700&nbsp;ft/s (210&nbsp;m/s).\n\nThis was major innovation in firearms ammunition, previously delivered as separate bullets and powder, was combined in a single metallic (usually brass) [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] containing a percussion cap, powder, and a bullet in one weatherproof package. The main technical advantage of the brass cartridge case was the effective and reliable sealing of high pressure gasses at the breech, as the gas pressure forces the cartridge case to expand outward, pressing it firmly against the inside of the gun barrel chamber.  This prevents the leakage of hot gas which could injure the shooter. The brass cartridge also opened the way for modern repeating arms, by uniting the bullet, gunpowder and primer into one assembly that could be fed reliably into the breech by a mechanical action in the firearm.\n\nBefore this, a \"cartridge\" was simply a premeasured quantity of [[gunpowder]] together with a ball in a small cloth bag (or rolled paper cylinder), which also acted as [[wadding]] for the charge and ball. This early form of cartridge had to be rammed into the muzzleloader's barrel, and either a small charge of gunpowder in the touch hole or an external percussion cap mounted on the touch hole ignited the gunpowder in the cartridge. Cartridges with built-in percussion caps (called \"primers\") continue to this day to be the standard in firearms. In cartridge-firing firearms, a hammer (or a firing pin struck by the hammer) strikes the cartridge primer, which then ignites the gunpowder within. The primer charge is at the base of the cartridge, either within the rim (a \"[[rimfire ammunition|rimfire]]\" cartridge) or in a small percussion cap embedded in the center of the base (a \"[[centerfire]]\" cartridge). As a rule, centerfire cartridges are more powerful than rimfire cartridges, operating at considerably higher pressures than rimfire cartridges. Centerfire cartridges are also safer, as a dropped rimfire cartridge has the potential to discharge if its rim strikes the ground with sufficient force to ignite the primer. This is practically impossible with most centerfire cartridges.\n\nNearly all contemporary firearms load cartridges directly into their [[Breech-loading weapon|breech]]. Some additionally or exclusively load from a [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] that holds multiple cartridges. A magazine is defined as a part of the firearm which exists to store ammunition and assist in its feeding by the action into the breech (such as through the rotation of a revolver's cylinder or by spring-loaded platforms in most pistol and rifle designs). Some magazines, such as that of most centerfire hunting rifles and all revolvers, are internal to and inseparable from the firearm, and are loaded by using a \"clip\".  A [[clip (ammunition)|clip]], often mistakingly used to refer to a detachable \"magazine\", is a device that holds the ammunition by the rim of the case and is designed to assist the shooter in reloading the firearm's magazine. Examples include revolver [[speedloader]]s, the [[stripper clip]] used to aid loading rifles such as the [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] or [[Mauser 98]], and the [[En-bloc clip#En bloc|en-bloc clip]] used in loading the [[M1 Garand]]. In this sense, \"magazines\" and \"clips\", though often used synonymously, refer to different types of devices.\n\n====Repeating, semi-automatic, and automatic firearms====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{further|Single-shot}}\n{{main|Repeating rifle}}\n{{main|Semi-automatic firearm}}\n[[File:FAMAS dsc06877.jpg|thumb|The French [[FAMAS]], example of a [[bullpup]] rifle]]\n[[File:M4w-att.jpg|thumb|The [[M4 carbine]], a modern-day service rifle capable of being fired automatically. It is in service by the U.S. military and has a wide ability for customization.]]\nMany firearms are \"single shot\": i.e., each time a cartridge is fired, the operator must manually re-cock the firearm and load another cartridge. The classic single-barreled shotgun is a good example. A firearm that can load multiple cartridges as the firearm is re-cocked is considered a \"repeating firearm\" or simply a \"repeater\". A lever-action rifle, a pump-action shotgun, and most bolt-action rifles are good examples of repeating firearms. A firearm that automatically re-cocks and reloads the next round with each trigger pull is considered a semi-automatic or autoloading firearm.\n\nThe first \"rapid firing\" firearms were usually similar to the 19th century [[Gatling gun]], which would fire cartridges from a magazine as fast as and as long as the operator turned a crank. Eventually, the \"rapid\" firing mechanism was perfected and miniaturized to the extent that either the recoil of the firearm or the gas pressure from firing could be used to operate it, thus the operator needed only to pull a trigger (which made the firing mechanisms truly \"automatic\"). An [[Automatic firearm|automatic]] (or \"fully automatic\") firearm is one that automatically re-cocks, reloads, and fires as long as the trigger is depressed. An automatic firearm is capable of firing multiple rounds with one pull of the trigger. The [[Gatling gun]] may have been the first automatic weapon, though the modern trigger-actuated machine gun was not widely introduced until the [[World War I|First World War]] with the German \"[[MG 08|Spandau]]\" and British [[Lewis Gun]]. Automatic rifles such as the [[Browning Automatic Rifle]] were in common use by the military during the early part of the 20th century, and automatic rifles that fired handgun rounds, known as submachine guns, also appeared in this time. Many modern military firearms have a [[selective fire]] option, which is a mechanical switch that allows the firearm be fired either in the semi-automatic or fully automatic mode. In the current M16A2 and M16A4 variants of the U.S.-made [[M16 rifle|M16]], continuous fully automatic fire is not possible, having been replaced by an automatic burst of three cartridges (this conserves ammunition and increases controllability). Automatic weapons are largely restricted to military and paramilitary organizations, though many automatic designs are infamous for their use by civilians.\n\n==Health hazards==\n{{See also|Gunshot wound|Gun safety}}\n\nFirearm hazard is quite notable, with a significant impact on the health system. In 2001, for quantification purpose, it was estimated that the cost of fatalities and injuries was US$ 4700 million per year in Canada (US$ 170 per Canadian) and US$ 100,000 million per year in the USA (US$ 300 per American).<ref name=\"who2001\" />\n\n===Fatality===\n[[File:2010 homicide suicide rates high-income countries.png| thumb | right | 325px |Gun-related homicide and suicide ''rates'' in high-income [[OECD]] countries, 2010, countries in graph ordered by total death rates (homicide plus suicide plus other gun-related deaths).<ref name=AJM201603>{{cite journal |last1=Grinshteyn |first1=Erin |last2=Hemenway |first2=David |title=Violent Death Rates: The US Compared with Other High-income OECD Countries, 2010 |journal=[[The American Journal of Medicine]] |date=March 2016 |volume=129 |issue=3 |pages=266\u2013273 |doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2015.10.025 |pmid=26551975 |doi-access=free }} ([https://www.webcitation.org/726BRzNvK?url=https://www.amjmed.com/action/showFullTableImage?isHtml=true&tableId=tbl4&pii=S000293431501030X Table 4]).

Individuals who shoot guns often have a characteristic pattern of hearing loss referred to as \u201cshooters ear\u201d. They often have a high frequency loss with better hearing in the low frequencies and one ear is typically worse than the other.The ear on the side the shooter is holding the gun will receive protection from the sound wave from the shoulder while the other ear remains unprotected and more susceptible to the full impact of the sound wave<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.asha.org/public/hearing/Recreational-Firearm-Noise-Exposure/|title=Recreational Firearm Noise Exposure|website=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref>. \n\nThe intensity of a gunshot does vary; lower caliber guns are typically on the softer side while higher caliber guns are often louder. The intensity of a gunshot though typically ranges from 140dB to 175dB. Indoor shooting also causes loud reverberations which can also be as damaging as the actual gunshot itself <ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />. According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders noise above 85dB can begin to cause hearing loss<ref name=\":0\" />. While many sounds cause damage over time, when you reach the intensity level of a gunshot (140dB or louder), damage to the ear can occur instantly<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />. \n\nHearing protection is the only way to protect the ears against damage from gunfire as there is no option for the shooter to be further from the sound source or to reduce the intensity to a safe level. If possible, observers should attempt to move away, but hearing protection is often still necessary<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />. Different types of shooters may benefit from different types of hearing protection. When target practicing it is recommended to wear an insert plug as well as an over the ear muff <ref name=\":1\" />. Hunters are recommended to wear electronic type hearing protection which can amplify soft sounds like leaves crunching while reducing the intensity of the gunshot<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />. Custom hearing protection can also be effective<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> and is typically recommended for individuals who are skeet shooting<ref name=\":1\" />. Hearing protection does have limitations though, and due to the high intensity of guns it is certainly possible for shooters to still develop hearing loss.

In the 13th century the Chinese invented the metal-barrelled [[hand cannon]], widely considered{{by whom|date=August 2018}} the true ancestor of all firearms.  The technology gradually spread through the rest of [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]], the [[Middle East]], and Europe. Older firearms typically used [[Gunpowder|black powder]] as a propellant, but modern firearms use [[smokeless powder]] or other propellants. Most modern firearms (with the notable exception of [[smoothbore]] [[shotgun]]s) have [[rifling|rifled]] barrels to impart spin to the [[projectile]] for improved flight stability.\n\nModern firearms can be described by their [[caliber]] (i.e. their bore diameter; this is given in millimeters or inches e.g. 7.5&nbsp;mm, .357 in.) or in the case of shotguns by their [[Gauge (bore diameter)|gauge]] (e.g. 12 ga.); by the type of action employed (muzzleloader, breechloader, lever, bolt, pump, revolver, [[semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]], [[automatic firearm|fully automatic]], etc.) together with the usual means of deportment (hand-held or mechanical mounting). Further classification may make reference to the type of barrel used (rifled) and to the barrel length (24 inch), to the firing mechanism (e.g. [[matchlock]], [[wheellock]], [[flintlock]], [[percussion lock]]), to the design's primary intended use (e.g. hunting rifle), or to the commonly accepted name for a particular variation (e.g. [[Gatling gun]]).\n\nShooters aim firearms at their targets with [[hand-eye coordination]], using either [[iron sights]] or  [[Telescopic sight|optical sights]]. The accurate range of pistols generally does not exceed {{convert|110|yd|m}}, while most rifles are accurate to {{convert|500|m|yd|order= flip}} using iron sights, or to longer ranges using optical sights (firearm rounds may be dangerous or lethal well beyond their accurate range; the minimum distance for safety is much greater than the specified range). Purpose-built [[sniper rifle]]s and [[anti-materiel rifle]]s are accurate to ranges of more than {{convert|2000|m|yd|order=flip}}.\n\n{{TOC Limit|4}}\n\n==Types==\nFirearms include a variety of ranged weapons and there is no agreed-upon definition.\n\n===Configuration===\n{{for|a more detailed list of common firearms|List of firearms|List of most-produced firearms|Small Arms and Light Weapons}}\n\nThe term \"'''small arms'''\" generally refers to any [[projectile#Kinetic projectiles|kinetic-projectile]] firearm small and light enough to be carried and operated by a single infantryman.

Revolvers have a number of firing chambers or \"charge holes\" in a revolving cylinder; each chamber in the cylinder is loaded with a single [[cartridge (firearms) |cartridge]] or charge. Semi-automatic pistols have a single fixed firing-chamber machined into the rear of the barrel, and a magazine so they can be used to fire more than one round. Each press of the trigger fires a cartridge, using the energy of the cartridge to activate a mechanism so that the next cartridge may be fired immediately. This is opposed to \"[[double-action]]\" revolvers, which accomplish the same end using a mechanical action linked to the trigger pull.\n\nWith the invention of the revolver in 1818, handguns capable of holding multiple rounds became popular. Certain designs of auto-loading pistol appeared beginning in the 1870s and had largely supplanted revolvers in military applications by the end of World War I. By the end of the 20th century, most handguns carried regularly by military, police and civilians were semi-automatic, although revolvers were still widely used. Generally speaking, military and police forces use semi-automatic pistols due to their high magazine capacities and ability to rapidly reload by simply removing the empty magazine and inserting a loaded one. Revolvers are very common among handgun hunters because revolver cartridges are usually more powerful than similar caliber semi-automatic pistol cartridges (which are designed for [[self-defense]]) and the strength, simplicity and durability of the revolver design is well-suited to outdoor use. Revolvers, especially in [[.22 LR]] and 38 Special/357 Magnum, are also common [[Concealed carry in the United States|concealed weapons]] in jurisdictions allowing this practice because their simple mechanics make them smaller than many autoloaders while remaining reliable. Both designs are common among civilian gun owners, depending on the owner's intention (self-defense, hunting, target shooting, competitions, collecting, etc.).\n\n====Long guns====\n{{main|Long gun}}\nA long gun is generally any firearm that is larger than a handgun and is designed to be held and fired with both hands, while brace against either the hip or the shoulder for better stability.  Long guns typically have a barrel length from {{convert|10|to|30|in|mm}} (there are restrictions on minimum barrel length in many jurisdictions; maximum barrel length is usually a matter of practicality), that along with the receiver and trigger group is mounted into a wood, plastic, metal or composite ''stock'', composed of one or more pieces that form a foregrip, rear grip, and optionally (but typically) a shoulder mount called the ''butt''. Early long arms, from the Renaissance up to the mid-19th century, were generally smoothbore firearms that fired one or more ball shot, called [[musket]]s or [[arquebus]] depending on caliber and firing mechanism.\n\n=====Rifles and shotguns=====\n{{main|Rifle|Shotgun}}\n[[File:Rifle Springfield M1903.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Springfield Armory [[M1903 Springfield|M1903 rifle]]]]\nMost modern [[long gun]]s are either [[rifle]]s or [[shotgun]]s. Both are the successors of the musket, diverging from their parent weapon in distinct ways. A rifle is so named for the spiral fluting ([[rifling]]) machined into the inner surface of its barrel, which imparts a self-stabilizing spin to the single [[bullet]]s it fires. Shotguns are predominantly [[smoothbore]] firearms designed to fire a number of ''[[Shot (pellet)|shot]]''; pellet sizes commonly ranging between 2&nbsp;mm #9 birdshot and 8.4&nbsp;mm #00 (double-aught) buckshot. Shotguns are also capable of firing single [[shotgun slug|slugs]], or specialty (often \"[[Non-lethal weapon|less lethal]]\") rounds such as [[Bean bag round|bean bags]], tear gas or [[breaching round]]s. Rifles have a very small impact area but a long range and high accuracy. Shotguns have a large impact area with considerably less range and accuracy. However, the larger impact area can compensate for reduced accuracy, since [[Shotgun shell#Spread|shot spreads]] during flight; consequently, in hunting, shotguns are generally used for flying game.\n\nRifles and shotguns are commonly used for hunting and often to defend a home or place of business. Usually, large game are hunted with rifles (although shotguns can be used, particularly with slugs), while birds are hunted with shotguns. Shotguns are sometimes preferred for defending a home or business due to their wide impact area, multiple wound tracks (when using buckshot), shorter range, and reduced penetration of walls (when using lighter shot), which significantly reduces the likelihood of unintended harm, although the handgun is also common.\n\n[[File:3-7 Shooting Competition (Image 2 of 4) (12753731154).jpg|thumb|left|A [[United States Marine]] armed with a [[Mossberg 500]] shotgun]]\nThere are a variety of types of rifles and shotguns based on the method they are reloaded. Bolt-action and lever-action rifles are manually operated. Manipulation of the bolt or the lever causes the spent cartridge to be removed, the firing mechanism recocked, and a fresh cartridge inserted. These two types of action are almost exclusively used by rifles. Slide-action (commonly called 'pump-action') rifles and shotguns are manually cycled by shuttling the foregrip of the firearm back and forth. This type of action is typically used by shotguns, but several major manufacturers make rifles that use this action.\n\nBoth rifles and shotguns also come in break-action varieties that do not have any kind of reloading mechanism at all but must be hand-loaded after each shot. Both rifles and shotguns come in single- and double-barreled varieties; however due to the expense and difficulty of manufacturing, double-barreled rifles are rare. Double-barreled rifles are typically intended for African big-game hunts where the animals are dangerous, ranges are short, and speed is of the essence. Very large and powerful calibers are normal for these firearms.\n\nRifles have been in nationally featured marksmanship events in Europe and the United States since at least the 18th century, when rifles were first becoming widely available. One of the earliest purely \"American\" rifle-shooting competitions took place in 1775, when Daniel Morgan was recruiting sharpshooters in Virginia for the impending [[American Revolutionary War]]. In some countries, rifle marksmanship is still a matter of national pride. Some specialized rifles in the larger calibers are claimed to have an accurate range of up to about {{convert|1|mi|m}}, although most have considerably less. In the second half of the 20th century, competitive shotgun sports became perhaps even more popular than riflery, largely due to the motion and immediate feedback in activities such as skeet, trap and sporting clays.\n\nIn military use, bolt-action rifles with high-power scopes are common as sniper rifles, however by the [[Korean War]] the traditional bolt-action and semi-automatic rifles used by infantrymen had been supplemented by select-fire designs known as [[automatic rifle]]s.\n\n=====Carbines=====\n{{main|Carbine}}\nA carbine is a firearm similar to a rifle in form and intended usage, but generally shorter or smaller than the typical \"full-size\" hunting or battle rifle of a similar time period, and sometimes using a smaller or less-powerful cartridge. Carbines were and are typically used by members of the military in roles that are expected to engage in combat, but where a full-size rifle would be an impediment to the primary duties of that soldier (vehicle drivers, field commanders and support staff, airborne troops, engineers, etc.). Carbines are also common in law enforcement and among civilian owners where similar size, space and/or power concerns may exist. Carbines, like rifles, can be single-shot, repeating-action, semi-automatic or select-fire/fully automatic, generally depending on the time period and intended market. Common historical examples include the [[Winchester Model 1892]], Lee\u2013Enfield \"[[Jungle Carbine]]\", [[SKS]], [[M1 carbine]] (no relation to the larger [[M1 Garand]]) and [[M4 carbine]] (a more compact variant of the current [[M16 rifle]]). Modern U.S. civilian carbines include compact customizations of the [[AR-15]], [[Ruger Mini-14]], [[Beretta Cx4 Storm]], [[Kel-Tec SUB-2000]], bolt-action rifles generally falling under the specifications of a [[scout rifle]], and aftermarket conversion kits for popular pistols including the [[M1911 pistol|M1911]] and [[Glock]] models.\n\n=====Machine guns=====\n{{main|Machine gun}}\n[[File:MG42 Sideview.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[MG 42]] general-purpose machine gun with retracted bipod]]\nA machine gun is a fully [[automatic firearm]], most often separated from other classes of automatic weapons by the use of belt-fed ammunition (though some designs employ drum, pan or hopper magazines), generally in a rifle-inspired caliber ranging between [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] (.223 Remington) for a [[light machine gun]] to as large as [[.50 BMG]] or even larger for crewed or aircraft weapons. Although not widely fielded until World War I, early machine guns were being used by militaries in the second half of the 19th century. Notables in the U.S. arsenal during the 20th century included the [[M2 Browning]] .50 caliber heavy machine gun, [[M1919 Browning machine gun|M1919 Browning]] .30 caliber medium machine gun, and the [[M60 machine gun|M60]] [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] general-purpose machine gun which came into use around the Vietnam War. Machine guns of this type were originally defensive firearms crewed by at least two men, mainly because of the difficulties involved in moving and placing them, their ammunition, and their tripod. In contrast, modern [[light machine gun]]s such as the [[FN Minimi]] are often wielded by a single infantryman. They provide a large ammunition capacity and a high rate of fire, and are typically used to give suppressing fire during infantry movement. Accuracy on machine guns varies based on a wide number of factors from design to manufacturing tolerances, most of which have been improved over time. Machine guns are often mounted on vehicles or helicopters, and have been used since World War I as offensive firearms in fighter aircraft and tanks (e.g. for air combat or suppressing fire for ground troop support).\n\nThe definition of machine gun is different in U.S. law. The [[National Firearms Act]] and [[Firearm Owners Protection Act]] define a \"machine gun\" in the United States code ''Title 26, Subtitle E, Chapter 53, Subchapter B, Part 1, \u00a7 5845'' as:\n\"... any firearm which shoots ... automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger\". \"Machine gun\" is therefore largely synonymous with \"automatic weapon\" in the U.S. civilian parlance, covering all automatic firearms.\n\n=====Sniper rifles=====\n{{main|Sniper rifle}}\n[[File:G22 ohne Schalldaempfer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Accuracy International]] [[Accuracy International Arctic Warfare|Arctic Warfare]] series of sniper rifles is standard issue in the armies of several countries, including those of Britain, Ireland, and Germany (picture shows a rifle of the [[German Army]]).]]\nThe definition of a sniper rifle is disputed among military, police and civilian observers alike, however most generally define a \u201csniper rifle\u201d as a high powered, semi-automatic/bolt action, precision rifle with an accurate range further than that of a standard rifle. These are often purpose-built for their applications. For example, a police sniper rifle may differ in specs from a military rifle. Police snipers generally do not engage targets at extreme range, but rather, a target at medium range. They may also have multiple targets within the shorter range, and thus a semi-automatic model is preferred to a bolt action. They also may be more compact than milspec rifles as police marksmen may need more portability. On the other hand, a military rifle is more likely to use a higher powered cartridge to defeat body armor or medium-light cover. They are more commonly (but not a lot more) bolt-action, as they are simpler to build and maintain. Also, due to fewer moving and overall parts, they are much more reliable under adverse conditions. They may also have a more powerful scope to acquire targets further away. Overall, sniper units never became prominent until [[World War 1]], when the Germans displayed their usefulness on the battlefield. Since then, they have become irrevocably embedded in warfare. Examples of sniper rifles include the [[Accuracy International AWM]], [[Sako TRG-42]] and the [[CheyTac M200]]. Examples of specialized sniper cartridges include the [[.338 Lapua Magnum]], [[.300 Winchester Magnum]], and [[.408 CheyTac]] rounds.\n\n=====Submachine guns=====\n{{main|Submachine gun}}\n[[File:Skorpion PICT0107.jpg|thumb|right|Czechoslovak 7.65 mm [[submachine gun]] [[\u0160korpion vz. 61]] designed in 1959.]]\nA submachine gun is a magazine-fed firearm, usually smaller than other automatic firearms, that fires [[pistol]]-caliber ammunition; for this reason certain submachine guns can also be referred to as ''machine pistols'', especially when referring to handgun-sized designs such as the [[\u0160korpion vz. 61]] and [[Glock#9\u00d719mm Parabellum|Glock 18]]. Well-known examples are the Israeli [[Uzi]] and [[Heckler & Koch MP5]] which use the [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]] cartridge, and the American [[Thompson submachine gun]] which fires [[.45 ACP]]. Because of their small size and limited projectile penetration compared to high-power rifle rounds, submachine guns are commonly favored by military, paramilitary and police forces for close-quarters engagements such as inside buildings, in urban areas or in trench complexes.\n\nSubmachine guns were originally about the size of carbines. Because they fire pistol ammunition, they have limited long-range use, but in close combat can be used in fully automatic in a controllable manner due to the lighter recoil of the pistol ammunition. They are also extremely inexpensive and simple to build in time of war, enabling a nation to quickly arm its military. In the latter half of the 20th century, submachine guns were being miniaturized to the point of being only slightly larger than some large handguns. The most widely used submachine gun at the end of the 20th century was the Heckler & Koch MP5. The MP5 is actually designated as a \"machine pistol\" by Heckler & Koch (MP5 stands for ''Maschinenpistole 5'', or Machine Pistol 5), although some reserve this designation for even smaller submachine guns such as the MAC-10 and [[Glock#9\u00d719mm Parabellum|Glock 18]], which are about the size and shape of pistols.\n\n=====Automatic rifles=====\n{{main|Automatic rifle}}\nAn automatic rifle is a magazine-fed firearm, wielded by a single infantryman, that is chambered for rifle cartridges and capable of automatic fire. The [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle]] was the first U.S. infantry weapon of this type, and was generally used for suppressive or support fire in the role now usually filled by the [[light machine gun]]. Other early automatic rifles include the [[Fedorov Avtomat]] and the [[Huot Automatic Rifle]]. Later, German forces fielded the [[StG 44|Sturmgewehr 44]] during [[World War II]], a light automatic rifle firing a reduced power \"[[intermediate cartridge]]\". This design was to become the basis for the \"[[assault rifle]]\" subclass of automatic weapons, as contrasted with \"[[battle rifle]]s\", which generally fire a traditional \"full-power\" rifle cartridge.\n\n=====Assault rifles=====\n{{main|Assault rifle}}\n[[File:AK-47 assault rifle.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[AK-47]], one of the most widely produced and used assault rifles in the world.]]\nIn [[World War II]], Germany introduced the [[StG 44]], and brought to the forefront of firearm technology what eventually became the class of firearm most widely adopted by the military, the assault rifle. An assault rifle is usually slightly smaller than a [[battle rifle]] such as the American M14, but the chief differences defining an assault rifle are [[Selective fire|select-fire capability]] and the use of a rifle round of lesser power, known as an [[intermediate cartridge]].\n\nSoviet engineer [[Mikhail Kalashnikov]] quickly adapted the German concept, using a less-powerful 7.62\u00d739mm cartridge derived from the standard 7.62\u00d754mmR Russian battle rifle round, to produce the [[AK-47]], which has become the world's most widely used assault rifle. Soon after World War II, the Automatic Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifle began to be fielded by the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies in the Eastern Bloc, as well as by nations such as China, North Korea, and North Vietnam.\n\nIn the United States, the assault rifle design was later in coming; the replacement for the M1 Garand of WWII was another John Garand design chambered for the new [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] cartridge; the select-fire [[M14 rifle|M14]], which was used by the U.S. military until the 1960s. The significant recoil of the M14 when fired in full-automatic mode was seen as a problem as it reduced accuracy, and in the 1960s it was replaced by [[Eugene Stoner]]'s [[AR-15]], which also marked a switch from the powerful .30 caliber cartridges used by the U.S. military up until early in the Vietnam War to the much less powerful but far lighter and light recoiling .223 caliber (5.56mm) [[intermediate cartridge]]. The military later designated the AR-15 as the \"[[M16 rifle|M16]]\". The civilian version of the M16 continues to be known as the AR-15 and looks exactly like the military version, although to conform to [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|B.A.T.F.E.]] regulations in the U.S., it lacks the mechanism that permits fully automatic fire.\n\nVariants of both of the M16 and AK-47 are still in wide international use today, though other automatic rifle designs have since been introduced. A smaller version of the M16A2, the [[M4 carbine]], is widely used by U.S. and NATO tank and vehicle crews, airbornes, support staff, and in other scenarios where space is limited. The [[IMI Galil]], an Israeli-designed weapon based on the action of the AK-47, is in use by Israel, Italy, Burma, the Philippines, Peru, and Colombia. [[Swiss Arms]] of Switzerland produces the [[SIG SG 550]] assault rifle used by France, Chile, and Spain among others, and [[Steyr Mannlicher]] produces the [[Steyr AUG|AUG]], a [[bullpup]] rifle in use in Austria, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and Saudi Arabia among other nations.\n\nModern designs call for compact weapons retaining firepower. The bullpup design, by mounting the magazine behind the trigger, unifies the accuracy and firepower of the traditional assault rifle with the compact size of the submachine gun (though submachine guns are still used); examples are the French [[FAMAS]] and the British [[SA80]].\n\n=====Personal defense weapons=====\n{{main|Personal defense weapon}}\n[[File:FN-P90 2.jpg|thumb|[[FN P90]] PDW]]\nA recently developed class of firearm is the [[personal defense weapon]] or PDW, which is in simplest terms a [[submachine gun]] designed to fire ammunitions with ballistic performance similar to rifle cartridges.  While a submachine gun is desirable for its compact size and ammunition capacity, its pistol cartridges lack the penetrating capability of a rifle round.  Conversely, rifle bullets can pierce light armor and are easier to shoot accurately, but even a [[carbine]] such as the Colt M4 is larger and/or longer than a submachine gun, making it harder to maneuver in close quarters.  The solution many firearms manufacturers have presented is a weapon resembling a submachine gun in size and general configuration, but which fires a higher-powered armor-penetrating round (often specially designed for the weapon), thus combining the advantages of a carbine and submachine gun.  This also earned the PDWs an infrequently used nickname \u2014 the submachine carbines.  The [[FN P90]] and [[Heckler & Koch MP7]] are most famous examples of PDWs.\n\n=====Battle rifles=====\n{{main|Battle rifle}}\n\n[[File:Scar H Standard.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Belgium|Belgian]] [[FN SCAR#SCAR-H|FN SCAR-H]]]]\n\nBattle rifles are another subtype of rifle, usually defined as [[selective fire]] rifles that use full power rifle cartridges, examples of which include the [[7.62x51mm NATO]], [[7.92x57mm Mauser]], and [[7.62x54mmR]]. These serve similar purposes to assault rifles, as they both are usually employed by ground infantry. However, some prefer battle rifles due to their more powerful cartridge, despite added recoil. Some semi-automatic sniper rifles are configured from battle rifles.\n\n===Function===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{main|Firearm action}}\nFirearms are also categorized by their functioning cycle or \"action\" which describes its loading, firing, and unloading cycle.\n\n====Manual====\nThe earliest evolution of the firearm, there are many types of manual action firearms. These can be divided into two basic categories: [[single shot]] and [[Repeating rifle|repeating]].\n\nA single shot firearm can only be fired once per equipped barrel before it must be reloaded or charged via an external mechanism or series of steps. A repeating firearm can be fired multiple times, but can only be fired once with each subsequent pull of the trigger. Between trigger pulls, the firearm's action must be reloaded or charged via an internal mechanism.\n\n====Lever action====\nA gun which has a lever that you pull down then back up to load.\n\n====Pump action====\nPump action weapons are primarily shotguns. A pump action is created when you slide a lever (usually a grip) and it brings a new round in the chamber while expelling the old one.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pump-action | title=Definition of PUMP-ACTION}}</ref>\n\n====Semi-automatic====\n{{main|Semi-automatic firearm}}\nA semi-automatic, self-loading, or \"auto loader\" firearm is one that performs all steps necessary to prepare it for firing again after a single discharge, until cartridges are no longer available in the weapon's feed device or magazine. Auto loaders fire one round with each pull of the trigger. Some people confuse the term with \"fully automatic\" firearms.  (See next.) While some semi-automatic rifles may resemble military-style firearms, they are not properly classified \"Assault Weapons\" which refers to those that continue to fire until the trigger is no longer depressed.\n\n====Automatic====\n{{main|Automatic firearm}}\nAn ''automatic'' firearm, or \"fully automatic\", \"fully auto\", or \"full auto\", is generally defined as one that continues to load and fire cartridges from its magazine as long as the trigger is depressed (and until the magazine is depleted of available ammunition.) The first weapon generally considered in this category is the [[Gatling gun]], originally a carriage-mounted, crank-operated firearm with multiple rotating barrels that was fielded in the [[American Civil War]]. The modern trigger-actuated machine gun began with various designs developed in the late 19th century and fielded in [[World War I]], such as the [[Maxim gun]], [[Lewis Gun]], and [[MG 08|MG 08 \"Spandau\"]]. Most automatic weapons are classed as long guns (as the ammunition used is of similar type as for rifles, and the recoil of the weapon's rapid fire is better controlled with two hands), but handgun-sized automatic weapons also exist, generally in the \"submachine gun\" or \"machine pistol\" class.\n\n====Selective fire====\n{{main|Selective fire}}\n'''Selective fire''', or \"select fire\", means the capability of a weapon's fire control to be adjusted in either semi-automatic, fully automatic firing modes, or 3 round burst.  The modes are chosen by means of a selector, which varies depending on the weapon's design.  Some selective-fire weapons have [[burst mode (weapons)|burst fire]] mechanisms built in to limit the maximum number of shots fired in fully automatic mode, with most common limits being two or three rounds per trigger pull.  The presence of selective-fire modes on firearms allows more efficient use of ammunition for specific tactical needs, either precision-aimed or [[suppressive fire]].  This capability is most commonly found on military weapons of the 20th and 21st centuries, most notably the [[assault rifle]]s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Yuan chinese gun.jpg|thumb|[[Hand cannon]] from the Chinese [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1271\u20131368).]]\n{{main|History of the firearm}}\n{{see also|History of gunpowder}}\nThe first primitive firearms were invented about 1250 AD in [[History of science and technology in China|China]] when the man-portable [[fire lance]] (a bamboo or metal tube that could shoot ignited [[gunpowder]]) was combined with projectiles such as scrap metal, broken porcelain, or darts/arrows.<ref name=\"Helaine\" /><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |author=Ho Peng Yoke |editor-first=Helaine |date=1997 |editor-last=Selin |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures |title=Gunpowder |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raKRY3KQspsC&pg=PA389 |access-date=30 July 2013 |language= |edition= |publisher=Springer |volume= |location= |id= |isbn=978-0-7923-4066-9 |oclc= |doi= |page=389 |quote= |ref= }}</ref>\n\nThe earliest depiction of a firearm is a sculpture from a cave in [[Sichuan]], China.

Breech-loading became more or less a universal standard for the reloading of most hand-held firearms and continues to be so with some notable exceptions (such as mortars). Instead of loading individual rounds into weapons, magazines holding multiple munitions were adopted\u2014these aided rapid reloading. Automatic and semi-automatic firing mechanisms meant that a single soldier could fire many more rounds in a minute than a vintage weapon could fire over the course of a battle. Polymers and alloys in firearm construction made weaponry progressively lighter and thus easier to deploy. Ammunition changed over the centuries from simple metallic ball-shaped projectiles that rattled down the barrel to bullets and cartridges manufactured to high precision. Especially in the past century has particular attention been devoted to accuracy and sighting to make firearms altogether far more accurate than ever before. More than any single factor though, firearms have proliferated due to the advent of mass production\u2014enabling arms manufacturers to produce large quantities of weaponry to a consistent standard.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nVelocities of bullets increased with the use of a \"jacket\" of a metal such as copper or copper alloys that covered a lead core and allowed the bullet to glide down the barrel more easily than exposed lead. Such bullets are designated as \"full metal jacket\" (FMJ). Such FMJ bullets are less likely to fragment on impact and are more likely to traverse through a target while imparting less energy. Hence, FMJ bullets impart less tissue damage than non-jacketed bullets that expand. (Dougherty and Eidt, 2009) This led to their adoption for military use by countries adhering to the Hague Convention in 1899.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThat said, the basic principle behind firearm operation remains unchanged to this day. A musket of several centuries ago is still similar in principle to a modern-day assault rifle\u2014using the expansion of gases to propel projectiles over long distances\u2014albeit less accurately and rapidly.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://allthingsliberty.com/2013/07/the-inaccuracy-of-muskets/|title=The Inaccuracy of Muskets |date=2013-07-15|work=Journal of the American Revolution|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Evolution===\n====Early models====\n=====Fire lances=====\n{{main|Fire lance}}\nThe Chinese [[fire lance]]{{when|date=August 2018}} was the direct predecessor to the modern concept of the firearm. It was not a gun itself, but an addition to the soldiers' spears. Originally it consisted of paper or bamboo barrels that would have incendiary gunpowder within it, that could be lit one time and would project flames at the enemy. Sometimes the Chinese troops would place small projectiles within the barrel that would also be projected when the gunpowder was lit, but most of the explosive force would create flames. Later, the barrel was changed to be made of metal, so that a more explosive gunpowder could be used and put more force into the propulsion of the projectile.<ref name=Chase />{{rp|31\u201332}}\n\n=====Hand cannons=====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{main|Hand cannon}}\n[[File:Lgehumble 1400.jpg|thumb|[[Hand cannon]] being fired from a stand, \"Belli Fortis\", manuscript, by Konrad Kyeser, 1400]]\nThe original predecessor of all firearms, the Chinese [[fire lance]]{{when|date=August 2018}} and [[hand cannon]] were loaded with gunpowder and the shot (initially [[lead shot]], later replaced by cast iron{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}) through the muzzle, while a fuse was placed at the rear. This fuse was lit, causing the gunpowder to ignite and propel the cannonball. In military use, the standard hand cannon was tremendously powerful, while also being somewhat useless{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} due to relative inability of the gunner to aim the weapon, or control the ballistic properties of the projectile. Recoil could be absorbed by bracing the barrel against the ground using a wooden support, the forerunner of the [[Stock (firearms)|stock]]. Neither the quality or amount of gunpowder, nor the consistency in projectile dimensions were controlled, with resulting inaccuracy in firing due to [[windage]], variance in gunpowder composition, and the difference in diameter between the [[Caliber|bore]] and the shot. The [[hand cannon]]s were replaced by lighter carriage-mounted [[artillery]] pieces, and ultimately the [[arquebus]].\n\n=====Muskets=====\n{{main|Musket}}\n[[File:Brown Bess.png|thumb|upright=1.35|A [[Brown Bess]] musket, used widely by the [[British Empire]] and some others during the 18th century.]]\n[[Muzzleloader|Muzzle-loading]] muskets (smooth-bored long guns) were among the first firearms developed.{{when|date=August 2018}} The firearm was loaded through the muzzle with gunpowder, optionally some wadding and then a bullet (usually a solid lead ball, but musketeers could shoot stones when they ran out of bullets). Greatly improved muzzleloaders (usually rifled instead of smooth-bored) are manufactured today and have many enthusiasts, many of whom hunt large and small game with their guns. Muzzleloaders have to be manually reloaded after each shot; a skilled archer could fire multiple arrows faster than most early muskets could be reloaded and fired, although by the mid-18th century, when muzzleloaders became the standard small armament of the military, a well-drilled soldier could fire six rounds in a minute using prepared cartridges in his musket. Before then, effectiveness of muzzleloaders was hindered by both the low reloading speed and, before the firing mechanism was perfected, the very high risk posed by the firearm to the person attempting to fire it.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nOne interesting solution to the reloading problem was the \"Roman Candle Gun\" with [[superposed load]]s. This was a muzzleloader in which multiple charges and balls were loaded one on top of the other, with a small hole in each ball to allow the subsequent charge to be ignited after the one ahead of it was ignited. It was neither a very reliable nor popular firearm, but it enabled a form of \"automatic\" fire long before the advent of the machine gun.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotwars.com/html/equip_firearms2.htm#3|title=Roman Candle Gun|work=Scotwars.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302211812/http://scotwars.com/html/equip_firearms2.htm|archivedate=March 2, 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Loading techniques====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{main|Muzzleloader}}\n[[File:Meyers b8 s0102a.jpg|220px|thumb|[[Percussion cap]] and early [[bolt action]] form]]\nMost early firearms were muzzle-loading. This form of loading has several disadvantages, such as a slow rate of fire and having to expose oneself to enemy fire to reload as the weapon had to be pointed upright so the powder could be poured through the muzzle into the breech followed by the ramming the projectile into the breech. As effective methods of sealing the breech were developed through the development of sturdy, weatherproof, self-contained metallic cartridges, muzzle-loaders were replaced by single-shot breech loaders. Eventually single-shot weapons were replaced by the following repeater type weapons.\n\n====Internal magazines====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{main|Magazine (firearms)}}\nMany firearms made in the late 19th century through the 1950s used internal magazines to load the cartridge into the chamber of the weapon. The most notable and revolutionary weapons of this period appeared during the U.S. Civil War and they were the [[Spencer rifle|Spencer]] and [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifles. Both used fixed tubular magazines, the former having the magazine in the buttstock and the latter under the barrel which allowed a larger capacity. Later weapons used fixed box magazines that could not be removed from the weapon without disassembling the weapon itself. Fixed magazines permitted the use of larger cartridges and eliminated the hazard of having the bullet of one cartridge butting next to the primer or rim of another cartridge. These magazines are loaded while they are in the weapon, often using a stripper clip. A clip is used to transfer cartridges into the magazine. Some notable weapons that use internal magazines include the [[Mosin\u2013Nagant]], the [[Mauser Kar 98k]], the [[Springfield M1903]], the [[M1 Garand]], and the [[SKS]]. Firearms that have internal magazines are usually, but not always, rifles. Some exceptions to this include the Mauser C96 pistol, which uses an internal magazine, and the [[Breda 30]], an Italian light machine gun.\n\n====Detachable magazines====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\nMany modern firearms use what are called detachable or box magazines as their method of chambering a cartridge. Detachable magazines can be removed from the weapon without disassembling the firearms, usually by pushing the magazine release.\n\n====Belt-fed weapons====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{main|Belt (firearm)}}\nA belt or ammunition belt is a device used to retain and feed cartridges into a firearm commonly used on machine guns. Belts were originally composed of canvas or cloth with pockets spaced evenly to allow the belt to be mechanically fed into the gun. These designs were prone to malfunctions due to the effects of oil and other contaminants altering the belt. Later belt designs used permanently connected metal links to retain the cartridges during feeding. These belts were more tolerant to exposure to solvents and oil. Some notable weapons that use belts are the M240, the M249, the M134 Minigun, and the PK Machine Gun.\n\n====Firing mechanisms====\n{{further|Trigger (firearms)|Firearm action}}\n\n=====Matchlock=====\n{{main|Matchlock}}\n[[File:Edo period rifles.jpg|thumb|left|Various Japanese (samurai) [[Edo period]] matchlocks (''tanegashima'').]]\n[[Matchlock]]s were the first and simplest firearms firing mechanisms developed. Using the matchlock mechanism, the powder in the gun barrel was ignited by a piece of burning cord called a \"match\". The match was wedged into one end of an S-shaped piece of steel. As the trigger (often actually a lever) was pulled, the match was brought into the open end of a \"touch hole\" at the base of the gun barrel, which contained a very small quantity of gunpowder, igniting the main charge of gunpowder in the gun barrel. The match usually had to be relit after each firing. The main parts to the matchlock firing mechanism are the pan, match, arm and trigger.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/move/musket |title=> Where Are You From? |publisher=Credo Reference |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref> A benefit of the pan and arm swivel being moved to the side of the gun was it gave a clear line of fire.<ref>Weir, William. 50 Weapons That Changed Warfare.

One disadvantage was if it was raining the match could not be kept lit to fire the weapon.  Another issue with the match was it could give away the position of soldiers because of the glow, sound, and smell.<ref>Saidel, Benjamin. \"Matchlocks, Flintlocks, and Saltpetre: The Chronological Implications for the Use of Matchlock Muskets among Ottoman-Period Bedouin in the Southern Levant.\" ''International Journal of Historical Archaeology'' 4 (2000): 191\u2013215.</ref>\n\n=====Wheellock=====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{main|Wheellock}}\n[[File:Wheellock for a firearm, 17th century, iron - Stadtmuseum Fembohaus - Nuremberg, Germany -DSC02125.jpg|right|thumb|A wheellock pistol mechanism from the 17th century]]\nThe [[wheellock]] action, a successor to the matchlock, predated the flintlock. Despite its many faults, the wheellock was a significant improvement over the matchlock in terms of both convenience and safety, since it eliminated the need to keep a smoldering match in proximity to loose gunpowder. It operated using a small wheel much like that on [[Lighter|cigarette lighters]] which was wound up with a key before use and which, when the trigger was pulled, spun against a flint, creating the shower of sparks that ignited the powder in the touch hole. Supposedly invented by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], the Italian [[Polymath|Renaissance man]], the wheellock action was an innovation that was not widely adopted due to the high cost of the clockwork mechanism.\n\n=====Flintlock=====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{main|Flintlock}}\n[[File:FlintlockMechanism.jpg|thumb|Flintlock mechanism]]\nThe [[flintlock]] action was a major innovation in firearm design. The spark used to ignite the gunpowder in the touch hole was supplied by a sharpened piece of flint clamped in the jaws of a \"cock\" which, when released by the trigger, struck a piece of steel called the \"[[frizzen]]\" to create the necessary sparks. (The spring-loaded arm that holds a piece of flint or pyrite is referred to as a cock because of its resemblance to a rooster.) The cock had to be manually reset after each firing, and the flint had to be replaced periodically due to wear from striking the frizzen. (See also [[flintlock mechanism]], [[snaphance]], [[Miquelet lock]]) The flintlock was widely used during the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries in both muskets and rifles.\n\n=====Percussion cap=====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{further|Percussion cap|Caplock mechanism}}\n[[Percussion cap]]s ([[caplock mechanism]]s), coming into wide service in the early 19th century, were a dramatic improvement over flintlocks. With the percussion cap mechanism, the small primer charge of gunpowder used in all preceding firearms was replaced by a completely self-contained explosive charge contained in a small brass \"cap\". The cap was fastened to the touch hole of the gun (extended to form a \"nipple\") and ignited by the impact of the gun's \"hammer\". (The hammer is roughly the same as the cock found on flintlocks except that it doesn't clamp onto anything.) In the case of percussion caps the hammer was hollow on the end to fit around the cap in order to keep the cap from fragmenting and injuring the shooter.\n\nOnce struck, the flame from the cap in turn ignited the main charge of gunpowder, as with the flintlock, but there was no longer any need to charge the touch hole with gunpowder, and even better, the touch hole was no longer exposed to the elements. As a result, the percussion cap mechanism was considerably safer, far more weatherproof, and vastly more reliable (cloth-bound cartridges containing a premeasured charge of gunpowder and a ball had been in regular military service for many years, but the exposed gunpowder in the entry to the touch hole had long been a source of misfires). All [[muzzleloader]]s manufactured since the second half of the 19th century use percussion caps except those built as replicas of the flintlock or earlier firearms.\n\n====Cartridges====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{main|Cartridge (firearms)}}\n{{further|Magazine (firearms)|Ammunition}}\n[[File:Snider-Martini-Enfield Cartridges.JPG|thumb|(From Left to Right): A [[.577 Snider]] cartridge (1867), a [[.577/450 Martini-Henry]] cartridge (1871), a later drawn brass .577/450 [[Martini-Henry]] cartridge, and a [[.303 British]] Mk VII SAA Ball cartridge.]]\n\nFrenchman [[Louis-Nicolas Flobert]] invented the first [[rimfire ammunition|rimfire metallic cartridge]] in 1845.

These cartridges have a relatively low muzzle velocity of around 700&nbsp;ft/s (210&nbsp;m/s).\n\nThis was major innovation in firearms ammunition, previously delivered as separate bullets and powder, was combined in a single metallic (usually brass) [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] containing a percussion cap, powder, and a bullet in one weatherproof package. The main technical advantage of the brass cartridge case was the effective and reliable sealing of high pressure gasses at the breech, as the gas pressure forces the cartridge case to expand outward, pressing it firmly against the inside of the gun barrel chamber.  This prevents the leakage of hot gas which could injure the shooter. The brass cartridge also opened the way for modern repeating arms, by uniting the bullet, gunpowder and primer into one assembly that could be fed reliably into the breech by a mechanical action in the firearm.\n\nBefore this, a \"cartridge\" was simply a premeasured quantity of [[gunpowder]] together with a ball in a small cloth bag (or rolled paper cylinder), which also acted as [[wadding]] for the charge and ball. This early form of cartridge had to be rammed into the muzzleloader's barrel, and either a small charge of gunpowder in the touch hole or an external percussion cap mounted on the touch hole ignited the gunpowder in the cartridge. Cartridges with built-in percussion caps (called \"primers\") continue to this day to be the standard in firearms. In cartridge-firing firearms, a hammer (or a firing pin struck by the hammer) strikes the cartridge primer, which then ignites the gunpowder within. The primer charge is at the base of the cartridge, either within the rim (a \"[[rimfire ammunition|rimfire]]\" cartridge) or in a small percussion cap embedded in the center of the base (a \"[[centerfire]]\" cartridge). As a rule, centerfire cartridges are more powerful than rimfire cartridges, operating at considerably higher pressures than rimfire cartridges. Centerfire cartridges are also safer, as a dropped rimfire cartridge has the potential to discharge if its rim strikes the ground with sufficient force to ignite the primer. This is practically impossible with most centerfire cartridges.\n\nNearly all contemporary firearms load cartridges directly into their [[Breech-loading weapon|breech]]. Some additionally or exclusively load from a [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] that holds multiple cartridges. A magazine is defined as a part of the firearm which exists to store ammunition and assist in its feeding by the action into the breech (such as through the rotation of a revolver's cylinder or by spring-loaded platforms in most pistol and rifle designs). Some magazines, such as that of most centerfire hunting rifles and all revolvers, are internal to and inseparable from the firearm, and are loaded by using a \"clip\".  A [[clip (ammunition)|clip]], often mistakingly used to refer to a detachable \"magazine\", is a device that holds the ammunition by the rim of the case and is designed to assist the shooter in reloading the firearm's magazine. Examples include revolver [[speedloader]]s, the [[stripper clip]] used to aid loading rifles such as the [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] or [[Mauser 98]], and the [[En-bloc clip#En bloc|en-bloc clip]] used in loading the [[M1 Garand]]. In this sense, \"magazines\" and \"clips\", though often used synonymously, refer to different types of devices.\n\n====Repeating, semi-automatic, and automatic firearms====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{further|Single-shot}}\n{{main|Repeating rifle}}\n{{main|Semi-automatic firearm}}\n[[File:FAMAS dsc06877.jpg|thumb|The French [[FAMAS]], example of a [[bullpup]] rifle]]\n[[File:M4w-att.jpg|thumb|The [[M4 carbine]], a modern-day service rifle capable of being fired automatically. It is in service by the U.S. military and has a wide ability for customization.]]\nMany firearms are \"single shot\": i.e., each time a cartridge is fired, the operator must manually re-cock the firearm and load another cartridge. The classic single-barreled shotgun is a good example. A firearm that can load multiple cartridges as the firearm is re-cocked is considered a \"repeating firearm\" or simply a \"repeater\". A lever-action rifle, a pump-action shotgun, and most bolt-action rifles are good examples of repeating firearms. A firearm that automatically re-cocks and reloads the next round with each trigger pull is considered a semi-automatic or autoloading firearm.\n\nThe first \"rapid firing\" firearms were usually similar to the 19th century [[Gatling gun]], which would fire cartridges from a magazine as fast as and as long as the operator turned a crank. Eventually, the \"rapid\" firing mechanism was perfected and miniaturized to the extent that either the recoil of the firearm or the gas pressure from firing could be used to operate it, thus the operator needed only to pull a trigger (which made the firing mechanisms truly \"automatic\"). An [[Automatic firearm|automatic]] (or \"fully automatic\") firearm is one that automatically re-cocks, reloads, and fires as long as the trigger is depressed. An automatic firearm is capable of firing multiple rounds with one pull of the trigger. The [[Gatling gun]] may have been the first automatic weapon, though the modern trigger-actuated machine gun was not widely introduced until the [[World War I|First World War]] with the German \"[[MG 08|Spandau]]\" and British [[Lewis Gun]]. Automatic rifles such as the [[Browning Automatic Rifle]] were in common use by the military during the early part of the 20th century, and automatic rifles that fired handgun rounds, known as submachine guns, also appeared in this time. Many modern military firearms have a [[selective fire]] option, which is a mechanical switch that allows the firearm be fired either in the semi-automatic or fully automatic mode. In the current M16A2 and M16A4 variants of the U.S.-made [[M16 rifle|M16]], continuous fully automatic fire is not possible, having been replaced by an automatic burst of three cartridges (this conserves ammunition and increases controllability). Automatic weapons are largely restricted to military and paramilitary organizations, though many automatic designs are infamous for their use by civilians.\n\n==Health hazards==\n{{See also|Gunshot wound|Gun safety}}\n\nFirearm hazard is quite notable, with a significant impact on the health system. In 2001, for quantification purpose, it was estimated that the cost of fatalities and injuries was US$ 4700 million per year in Canada (US$ 170 per Canadian) and US$ 100,000 million per year in the USA (US$ 300 per American).<ref name=\"who2001\" />\n\n===Fatality===\n[[File:2010 homicide suicide rates high-income countries.png| thumb | right | 325px |Gun-related homicide and suicide ''rates'' in high-income [[OECD]] countries, 2010, countries in graph ordered by total death rates (homicide plus suicide plus other gun-related deaths).<ref name=AJM201603>{{cite journal |last1=Grinshteyn |first1=Erin |last2=Hemenway |first2=David |title=Violent Death Rates: The US Compared with Other High-income OECD Countries, 2010 |journal=[[The American Journal of Medicine]] |date=March 2016 |volume=129 |issue=3 |pages=266\u2013273 |doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2015.10.025 |pmid=26551975 |doi-access=free }} ([https://www.webcitation.org/726BRzNvK?url=https://www.amjmed.com/action/showFullTableImage?isHtml=true&tableId=tbl4&pii=S000293431501030X Table 4]).

Individuals who shoot guns often have a characteristic pattern of hearing loss referred to as \u201cshooters ear\u201d. They often have a high frequency loss with better hearing in the low frequencies and one ear is typically worse than the other.The ear on the side the shooter is holding the gun will receive protection from the sound wave from the shoulder while the other ear remains unprotected and more susceptible to the full impact of the sound wave<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.asha.org/public/hearing/Recreational-Firearm-Noise-Exposure/|title=Recreational Firearm Noise Exposure|website=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref>. \n\nThe intensity of a gunshot does vary; lower caliber guns are typically on the softer side while higher caliber guns are often louder. The intensity of a gunshot though typically ranges from 140dB to 175dB. Indoor shooting also causes loud reverberations which can also be as damaging as the actual gunshot itself <ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />. According to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders noise above 85dB can begin to cause hearing loss<ref name=\":0\" />. While many sounds cause damage over time, when you reach the intensity level of a gunshot (140dB or louder), damage to the ear can occur instantly<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />. \n\nHearing protection is the only way to protect the ears against damage from gunfire as there is no option for the shooter to be further from the sound source or to reduce the intensity to a safe level. If possible, observers should attempt to move away, but hearing protection is often still necessary<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />. Different types of shooters may benefit from different types of hearing protection. When target practicing it is recommended to wear an insert plug as well as an over the ear muff <ref name=\":1\" />. Hunters are recommended to wear electronic type hearing protection which can amplify soft sounds like leaves crunching while reducing the intensity of the gunshot<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />. Custom hearing protection can also be effective<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> and is typically recommended for individuals who are skeet shooting<ref name=\":1\" />. Hearing protection does have limitations though, and due to the high intensity of guns it is certainly possible for shooters to still develop hearing loss.
