It is commonly found in the form of a rounded outgrowth on a [[tree]] [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]] or [[branch]] that is filled with small [[Knothole|knots]] from dormant buds.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Fatburl.jpeg|thumb|right|Large burl on a spruce tree at [[Denali State Park]], Alaska]]\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nA burl results from a tree undergoing some form of stress. It may be caused by an injury, virus or fungus. Most burls grow beneath the ground, attached to the [[root]]s as a type of [[Cancer|malignancy]] that is generally not discovered until the tree dies or falls over. Such burls sometimes appear as groups of bulbous protrusions connected by a system of [[rope]]-like roots. Almost all burl wood is covered by [[bark (botany)|bark]], even if it is underground. [[Insect]] infestation and certain types of [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] infestation are the most common causes of this condition.\n\nIn some tree species, burls can grow to great size. The largest, at {{Convert|26|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, occur in coast redwoods (''[[Sequoia sempervirens]]'') and can encircle the entire trunk; when moisture is present, these burls can grow new redwood trees. The world's second-largest burls can be found in [[Port McNeill, British Columbia]]. One of the largest burls known was found around 1984 in the small town of [[Tamworth, New South Wales]]. It stands {{convert|6.4|ft|abbr=on}} tall, with an odd shape resembling a trombone. In January 2009, this burl was controversially removed from its original location, and relocated to a public school in the central New South Wales city of [[Dubbo]].\n\n==Use==\n[[File:Burlrailingseats.JPG|thumb|left|A burled spruce log carved for use as a railing with built-in seats on a log cabin]]\nBurls yield a very peculiar and highly [[figure (wood)|figured]] wood, prized for its beauty and rarity. It is sought after by furniture makers, artists, and [[Wood carving|wood sculptors]]. There are a number of well-known types of burls (each from a particular species); these are highly valued and sliced into [[Wood veneer|veneers]] for furniture, [[Marquetry|inlay]] in doors, [[picture frame]]s, household objects, automobile interior paneling and [[Wood trim|trim]], musical instruments, and [[woodturning]]. The famous [[Bird's eye figure|birdseye maple]] of the sugar maple (''[[Acer saccharum]]'') superficially resembles the wood of a burl but is something else entirely. Burl wood is very hard to work with hand tools or on a [[lathe]] because its grain is twisted and interlocked, causing it to chip and shatter unpredictably. This \"wild grain\" makes burl wood extremely dense and resistant to splitting, which made it valued for bowls, mallets, mauls and \"beetles\" or \"beadles\" for hammering chisels and driving wooden pegs.<ref>Sloane, Eric (1973).

These devices are commonly marketed as being beneficial to [[allergy]] sufferers and [[asthma]]tics, and at reducing or eliminating [[passive smoking|second-hand tobacco smoke]]. The commercially graded air purifiers are manufactured as either small stand-alone units or larger units that can be affixed to an air handler unit (AHU) or to an [[HVAC]] unit found in the medical, industrial, and commercial industries.

As of 2005, the most common methods were high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2005-11-01|title=Air Cleaning Technologies|journal=Ontario Health Technology Assessment Series|volume=5|issue=17|pages=1\u201352|issn=1915-7398|pmc=3382390|pmid=23074468}}</ref>\n\n=== Filtration ===\n[[Air filter]] purification traps airborne particles by size exclusion. Air is forced through a filter and particles are physically captured by the filter. Various filters exist notably including:\n* High-efficiency particulate arrestance ([[HEPA]]) filters remove at least 99.97% of 0.3-micrometer particles and are usually more effective at removing larger particles. HEPA purifiers, which filter all the air going into a [[clean room]], must be arranged so that no air bypasses the HEPA filter. In dusty environments, a HEPA filter may follow an easily cleaned conventional filter (prefilter) which removes coarser impurities so that the HEPA filter needs cleaning or replacing less frequently. HEPA filters do not generate ozone or harmful byproducts in the course of operation.\n* Filter HVAC at [[Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value|MERV]] 14 or above are rated to remove airborne particles of 0.3 micrometers or larger. A high-efficiency MERV 14 filter has a capture rate of at least 75% for particles between 0.3 and 1.0 micrometers. Although the capture rate of a MERV filter is lower than that of a HEPA filter, a central air system can move significantly more air in the same period of time. Using a high-grade MERV filter can be more effective than using a high-powered HEPA machine at a fraction of the initial capital expenditure. Unfortunately, most furnace filters are slid in place without an [[hermetic seal|airtight seal]], which allows air to pass around the filters. This problem is worse for the higher-efficiency MERV filters because of the increase in [[drag (physics)|air resistance]]. Higher-efficiency MERV filters are usually denser and increase air resistance in the central system, requiring a greater [[air pressure]] drop and consequently increasing energy costs.\n\n=== Other methods ===\n[[File:\u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u2116 3. \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a.\u041e\u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0443\u0445\u0430.jpg|thumb|right|192px|<center> {{PAGENAME}} </center>]]\n*[[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation]] - UVGI can be used to sterilize air that passes UV lamps via forced air. Air purification UVGI systems can be freestanding units with shielded UV lamps that use a fan to force air past the UV light. Other systems are installed in forced air systems so that the circulation for the premises moves micro-organisms past the lamps. Key to this form of sterilization is the placement of the UV lamps and a good filtration system to remove the dead micro-organisms. For example, forced air systems by design impede line-of-sight, thus creating areas of the environment that will be shaded from the UV light. However, a UV lamp placed at the coils and drain pan of the cooling system will keep micro-organisms from forming in these naturally damp places. The most effective method for treating the air rather than the coils is in-line duct systems, these systems are placed in the center of the duct and parallel to the airflow.\n\n*[[Activated carbon]] is a [[porosity|porous]] material that can [[adsorption|adsorb]] volatile chemicals on a molecular basis, but does not remove larger particles. The adsorption process when using activated carbon must reach equilibrium thus it may be difficult to completely remove contaminants.<ref name=\"zeltner\" /> Activated carbon is merely a process of changing contaminants from a gaseous phase to a solid phase, when aggravated or disturbed contaminants can be regenerated in indoor air sources.<ref name=\"lee\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Ao | first1 = C.

Most polarized-media electronic air cleaners use safe 24-volt DC voltage to establish the polarizing electric field. Most airborne particles have a charge and many are even bi-polar.  As airborne particles pass through the electric field the polarized field re-orients the particle to  adhere to a disposable fiber media pad. Ultra-fine particles (UFPs) that are not collected on their initial pass through the media pad are polarized and agglomerate to other particles, odor and VOC molecules and are collected on subsequent passes. The efficiency of polarized-media electronic air cleaners increases as they load, providing high-efficiency filtration, with air resistance typically equal to or less than passive filters. Polarized-media technology is non-ionizing, which means no ozone is produced.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n*[[Photocatalysis|Photocatalytic oxidation]] (PCO) is an emerging technology in the HVAC industry.{{cn|date=August 2019}} In addition to the prospect of Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) benefits, it has the added potential for limiting the introduction of unconditioned air to the building space, thereby presenting an opportunity to achieve energy savings over previous prescriptive designs.

Photocatalytic Oxidation systems often have high commercial costs.<ref name=\"zeltner\" />\n:A related technology relevant to air purification is photoelectrochemical oxidation (PECO) [[Photoelectrochemical oxidation]]. While technically a type of PCO, PECO involves electrochemical interactions among the catalyst material and reactive species (e.g., through emplacement of cathodic materials) to improve quantum efficiency; in this way, it is possible to use lower energy UVA radiation as the light source and yet achieve improved effectiveness.<ref name=\"goswami\">{{cite patent|invent1=Goswami, D.

These ions attach to airborne particles which are then [[electrostatic]]ally attracted to a charged collector plate. This mechanism produces trace amounts of [[ozone]] and other oxidants as by-products.<ref name=\"ang\" /> Most ionizers produce less than 0.05 [[parts per million|ppm]] of ozone, an industrial safety standard. There are two major subdivisions: the fanless ionizer and fan-based ionizer. Fanless ionizers are noiseless and use little power, but are less efficient at air purification. Fan-based ionizers clean and distribute air much faster. Permanently mounted home and industrial ionizer purifiers are called [[electrostatic precipitator]]s.\n*[[Immobilized Cell Technology|Immobilized cell technology]] removes microfine particulate matter from the air by attracting charged particulates to a bio-reactive mass, or bioreactor, which enzymatically renders them inert.\n*[[Ozone generator]]s are designed to produce ozone and are sometimes sold as whole-house air cleaners. Unlike ionizers, ozone generators are intended to produce significant amounts of ozone, a strong [[oxidant]] gas which can oxidize many other chemicals. The only safe use of ozone generators is in unoccupied rooms, utilising \"shock treatment\" commercial ozone generators that produce over 3000&nbsp;mg of ozone per hour. Restoration contractors use these types of ozone generators to remove smoke odors after fire damage, musty smells after flooding, [[mold remediation|mold]] (including [[toxic mold]]s), and the stench caused by decaying flesh which cannot be removed by bleach or anything else except for ozone.

As of 2005, the most common methods were high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2005-11-01|title=Air Cleaning Technologies|journal=Ontario Health Technology Assessment Series|volume=5|issue=17|pages=1\u201352|issn=1915-7398|pmc=3382390|pmid=23074468}}</ref>\n\n=== Filtration ===\n[[Air filter]] purification traps airborne particles by size exclusion. Air is forced through a filter and particles are physically captured by the filter. Various filters exist notably including:\n* High-efficiency particulate arrestance ([[HEPA]]) filters remove at least 99.97% of 0.3-micrometer particles and are usually more effective at removing larger particles. HEPA purifiers, which filter all the air going into a [[clean room]], must be arranged so that no air bypasses the HEPA filter. In dusty environments, a HEPA filter may follow an easily cleaned conventional filter (prefilter) which removes coarser impurities so that the HEPA filter needs cleaning or replacing less frequently. HEPA filters do not generate ozone or harmful byproducts in the course of operation.\n* Filter HVAC at [[Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value|MERV]] 14 or above are rated to remove airborne particles of 0.3 micrometers or larger. A high-efficiency MERV 14 filter has a capture rate of at least 75% for particles between 0.3 and 1.0 micrometers. Although the capture rate of a MERV filter is lower than that of a HEPA filter, a central air system can move significantly more air in the same period of time. Using a high-grade MERV filter can be more effective than using a high-powered HEPA machine at a fraction of the initial capital expenditure. Unfortunately, most furnace filters are slid in place without an [[hermetic seal|airtight seal]], which allows air to pass around the filters. This problem is worse for the higher-efficiency MERV filters because of the increase in [[drag (physics)|air resistance]]. Higher-efficiency MERV filters are usually denser and increase air resistance in the central system, requiring a greater [[air pressure]] drop and consequently increasing energy costs.\n\n=== Other methods ===\n[[File:\u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u2116 3. \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a.\u041e\u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0443\u0445\u0430.jpg|thumb|right|192px|<center> {{PAGENAME}} </center>]]\n*[[Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation]] - UVGI can be used to sterilize air that passes UV lamps via forced air. Air purification UVGI systems can be freestanding units with shielded UV lamps that use a fan to force air past the UV light. Other systems are installed in forced air systems so that the circulation for the premises moves micro-organisms past the lamps. Key to this form of sterilization is the placement of the UV lamps and a good filtration system to remove the dead micro-organisms. For example, forced air systems by design impede line-of-sight, thus creating areas of the environment that will be shaded from the UV light. However, a UV lamp placed at the coils and drain pan of the cooling system will keep micro-organisms from forming in these naturally damp places. The most effective method for treating the air rather than the coils is in-line duct systems, these systems are placed in the center of the duct and parallel to the airflow.\n\n*[[Activated carbon]] is a [[porosity|porous]] material that can [[adsorption|adsorb]] volatile chemicals on a molecular basis, but does not remove larger particles. The adsorption process when using activated carbon must reach equilibrium thus it may be difficult to completely remove contaminants.<ref name=\"zeltner\" /> Activated carbon is merely a process of changing contaminants from a gaseous phase to a solid phase, when aggravated or disturbed contaminants can be regenerated in indoor air sources.<ref name=\"lee\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Ao | first1 = C.

Most polarized-media electronic air cleaners use safe 24-volt DC voltage to establish the polarizing electric field. Most airborne particles have a charge and many are even bi-polar.  As airborne particles pass through the electric field the polarized field re-orients the particle to  adhere to a disposable fiber media pad. Ultra-fine particles (UFPs) that are not collected on their initial pass through the media pad are polarized and agglomerate to other particles, odor and VOC molecules and are collected on subsequent passes. The efficiency of polarized-media electronic air cleaners increases as they load, providing high-efficiency filtration, with air resistance typically equal to or less than passive filters. Polarized-media technology is non-ionizing, which means no ozone is produced.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n*[[Photocatalysis|Photocatalytic oxidation]] (PCO) is an emerging technology in the HVAC industry.{{cn|date=August 2019}} In addition to the prospect of Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) benefits, it has the added potential for limiting the introduction of unconditioned air to the building space, thereby presenting an opportunity to achieve energy savings over previous prescriptive designs.

In a controlled experiment, in many cases, ozone concentrations were well in excess of public and/or industrial safety levels established by US Environmental Protection Agency, particularly in poorly ventilated rooms.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Quantification of Ozone Levels in Indoor Environments Generated by Ionization and Ozonolysis Air Purifiers|author1=Britigan, Nicole |author2=Alshawa, Ahmad |author3=Nizkorodov, Sergey A. | journal=Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association|date=May 2006| volume=56| pages=601\u2013610| issn=1047-3289| pmid=16739796| issue=5| doi=10.1080/10473289.2006.10464467| doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nOzone can damage the lungs, causing chest pain, coughing, shortness of breath and throat irritation.

In 2004, it was renamed to Zoner Photo Studio, because the product focus switched to strictly [[digital photography]] only.\nA new version has been published each year during the software's history.\n\n'''Key changes brought by recent versions:'''\n\nVersion 12 of Zoner Photo Studio introduced the program's division into \"modules\": a Manager, Viewer, Editor, and [[Raw image format|raw]] module, to increase the ease of working with photo management/editing/etc. simultaneously. This was also the first version with a default charcoal gray interface, intended to ease photo viewing.\nVersion 13 brought support for dual monitors and [[64-bit]] versions of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].\nVersion 14 brought support for batch upload to the developer's Zonerama web gallery service and for [[GPU]] acceleration via [[CUDA]] and [[OpenCL]].\nVersion 15 added the new Import module.\nVersion 16 completed the Editor's switch to using the Side Panel.\nVersion 17 revamped the raw module and made the Catalog more central to the Manager. Version 18 brought a major interface change. The five modules were distilled into three: Manager, Develop, and Editor. Develop enables non-destructive edits to raw files and other supported files. New version of Zoner Photo Studio X is subscription based and brings fine-tuned retouching tools and support of layer based editing.\n\n== Interface ==\nThis is all-in-one photo software, that is, it has features for all of a photo workflow, rather than e.g. only editing. The interface is divided into what the company calls \"modules,\" each addressing a certain major task in that workflow, such as viewing, editing, managing, or \"importing\" (downloading) photos.\n\n=== Import module\u2014downloading photos onto a computer ===\nThe program's Import module is used for copying or moving photos from a camera, a card, or other external media onto a computer. It offers various automatic actions during download, such as assigning keywords and other metadata.\n\n=== Manager module\u2014organizing photos ===\nThe program's Manager module is for organizing photos. It can display \"[[metadata]],\" that is, information about pictures, stored in the [[Exif]], IPTC, and/or XMP standard. This metadata includes titles, descriptions, author info, keywords, audio notes, digital signatures, [[GPS]] data, ratings, colored labels, etc. Metadata can also be edited here, or used for filtering. The Manager supports batch work.\nThe program works with image files on disk directly\u2014they are not imported in and later exported out. However, it does have a Catalog database that serves as a \"card catalog\" for metadata.\nThe Manager has several different views\u2014besides the standard \"Browser,\" these are \"Preview,\" \"Map,\" and \"Compare.\" Their purposes match their names.\n\n=== Viewer\u2014full-size picture viewing ===\nThe Viewer is for quick full-size picture browsing.\n\n=== Editor\u2014photo editing ===\nThe Editor is used for photo editing. This is a classic bitmap editor, built for retouching purposes only and thus without full layer support (just a temporary layer upon which edits \"float\" until they are applied). This editor offers selections and a selection mask.\n\n=== Raw module\u2014raw file development ===\nThe program's raw module enables conversion of [[Raw image format|raw]]-format data into files in standard [[Bitmap|bitmap formats]]. The native support does not cover all the newest [[camera]]s at any given moment, but can be expanded to support them by integrating a free DNG converter. Version 17 of the program added support for automatic lens defect corrections during development using LCP profiles.\n\n==Photo Studio 15==\nZoner Photo Studio was released in October 2012.\n\n=== Features Added in Version 15 ===\n\n==== Import Module\u2014photo downloading ====\nThe photo-download process was completely redesigned for version 15.\n\n==== Side Panel introduced ====\nThe Side Panel was first added to the Editor in this version, where it already replaced the major editing dialogs (for e.g. colors, brightness, white balance, etc.). Version 15 is thus also when full-screen previewing first replaced small preview panes for most edits.

In 2004, it was renamed to Zoner Photo Studio, because the product focus switched to strictly [[digital photography]] only.\nA new version has been published each year during the software's history.\n\n'''Key changes brought by recent versions:'''\n\nVersion 12 of Zoner Photo Studio introduced the program's division into \"modules\": a Manager, Viewer, Editor, and [[Raw image format|raw]] module, to increase the ease of working with photo management/editing/etc. simultaneously. This was also the first version with a default charcoal gray interface, intended to ease photo viewing.\nVersion 13 brought support for dual monitors and [[64-bit]] versions of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].\nVersion 14 brought support for batch upload to the developer's Zonerama web gallery service and for [[GPU]] acceleration via [[CUDA]] and [[OpenCL]].\nVersion 15 added the new Import module.\nVersion 16 completed the Editor's switch to using the Side Panel.\nVersion 17 revamped the raw module and made the Catalog more central to the Manager. Version 18 brought a major interface change. The five modules were distilled into three: Manager, Develop, and Editor. Develop enables non-destructive edits to raw files and other supported files. New version of Zoner Photo Studio X is subscription based and brings fine-tuned retouching tools and support of layer based editing.\n\n== Interface ==\nThis is all-in-one photo software, that is, it has features for all of a photo workflow, rather than e.g. only editing. The interface is divided into what the company calls \"modules,\" each addressing a certain major task in that workflow, such as viewing, editing, managing, or \"importing\" (downloading) photos.\n\n=== Import module\u2014downloading photos onto a computer ===\nThe program's Import module is used for copying or moving photos from a camera, a card, or other external media onto a computer. It offers various automatic actions during download, such as assigning keywords and other metadata.\n\n=== Manager module\u2014organizing photos ===\nThe program's Manager module is for organizing photos. It can display \"[[metadata]],\" that is, information about pictures, stored in the [[Exif]], IPTC, and/or XMP standard. This metadata includes titles, descriptions, author info, keywords, audio notes, digital signatures, [[GPS]] data, ratings, colored labels, etc. Metadata can also be edited here, or used for filtering. The Manager supports batch work.\nThe program works with image files on disk directly\u2014they are not imported in and later exported out. However, it does have a Catalog database that serves as a \"card catalog\" for metadata.\nThe Manager has several different views\u2014besides the standard \"Browser,\" these are \"Preview,\" \"Map,\" and \"Compare.\" Their purposes match their names.\n\n=== Viewer\u2014full-size picture viewing ===\nThe Viewer is for quick full-size picture browsing.\n\n=== Editor\u2014photo editing ===\nThe Editor is used for photo editing. This is a classic bitmap editor, built for retouching purposes only and thus without full layer support (just a temporary layer upon which edits \"float\" until they are applied). This editor offers selections and a selection mask.\n\n=== Raw module\u2014raw file development ===\nThe program's raw module enables conversion of [[Raw image format|raw]]-format data into files in standard [[Bitmap|bitmap formats]]. The native support does not cover all the newest [[camera]]s at any given moment, but can be expanded to support them by integrating a free DNG converter. Version 17 of the program added support for automatic lens defect corrections during development using LCP profiles.\n\n==Photo Studio 15==\nZoner Photo Studio was released in October 2012.\n\n=== Features Added in Version 15 ===\n\n==== Import Module\u2014photo downloading ====\nThe photo-download process was completely redesigned for version 15.\n\n==== Side Panel introduced ====\nThe Side Panel was first added to the Editor in this version, where it already replaced the major editing dialogs (for e.g. colors, brightness, white balance, etc.). Version 15 is thus also when full-screen previewing first replaced small preview panes for most edits. This version saw the addition of \"Quick Filters,\" designed for quickly applying multiple edits at once to give a certain look (e.g. \"Polaroid,\" \"Cross Process,\" \"Lomo\").\n\n==== Automatic Backups of Original Version ====\nEach photo is automatically backed up to a local database the moment a user first edits that photo in the program. The program offers a \"Restore Original\" function powered by this database. This function is optional, but on by default.\n\n==== Synchronization ====\nA tool that synchronizes photo collections in multiple locations against each other.\n\n==== Tilt-shift ====\nThis feature works like a [[Tilt-shift]] lens, that is, it blurs a picture's background (with controls for where and how much to blur).\n\n==== Zonerama ====\nZonerama is a web gallery service run by the developer of Zoner Photo Studio. Zoner, Inc. provides it for free to both users and non-users of the program. Albums can have configurable privacy, visibility, etc. Version 15 introduced integration between the program and this service, although version 15's integration is outdated today. This integration includes e.g. editing of Zonerama pictures directly from the program.\n\n== Zoner Photo Studio 16 ==\n<ref>{{cite web|title=Photography Blog|url=http://www.photographyblog.com/reviews/zoner_photo_studio_16_review/|accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThis version was released in October 2013.\n\n=== Features added in version 16 ===\n\n=== Improved touch-controls support ===\nVersion 16 improves the program's usability on tablet PCs and with touch monitors.\n\n==== Manager ====\nThis version saw the Manager's main area split into several views\u2014the traditional Browser, plus Preview for quick full-size viewing, Map for work with pictures\u2019 GPS coordinates, and Compare for visually comparing photos side-by-side.

Photo ratings were changed from numbers to stars, and the ability to batch-keyword-tag photos in the Information pane was added.\nAs of this version, the Catalog indexes pictures in the background (i.e. it is non-blocking) and auto-indexes the Windows Pictures library, and the Catalog section holds a more prominent place in the folder list on the left. The Catalog section also contains the controls for the [[DLNA]] capabilities added in this version.\nA tool for finding and deleting duplicate files was added in this version.\n\n==== Raw ====\nThis version saw a full reworking of the raw module's interface, with some elements removed and some added; one addition is an Automatic button that auto-suggests settings. The most important newly adjustable development settings here are for histogram curves. As of this version, Manager thumbnails immediately reflect changes in the raw module.\nThis version also adds support for lens defect correction using LCP profiles during raw development.\n\n== Zoner Photo Studio 18 ==\nThe English version of Zoner Photo Studio 18 was released on 1 October 2015.\n\n=== Features added in version 18 ===\n\n==== Interface ====\nZoner Photo Studio 18 is divided into three sections \u2013 Manager, Develop and Editor.

{"title_page": "Enriched flour", "text_new": "{{no footnotes|date=May 2013}}\n\n'''Enriched flour''' is [[flour]] with specific [[nutrient]]s returned to it that have been lost while being prepared. These restored nutrients include [[iron]] and [[B vitamins]] (folic acid, riboflavin, niacin, and thiamine). Calcium may also be supplemented. The purpose of enriching flour is to replenish the nutrients in the flour to match the nutritional status of the unrefined product. This differentiates enrichment from [[Food fortification|fortification]], which is the process of introducing new nutrients to a food.\n\n== History ==\n{{no footnotes|date=May 2013}}\n\nWhite flour became adopted in many cultures because it was recognized as being healthier than dark flours during the late Middle Ages. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The unknown factor for its benefit at that time was that [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] and [[fungus]] in the grains, which led to several diseases, were eliminated in the processing that resulted in white flour. \n\nIn the 1920s, [[Benjamin R. Jacobs]] began to document the loss of essential nutrients, however, through this processing of [[cereal]]s and [[grain]]s and to demonstrate a method by which the end products could be enriched with the lost nutrients. These nutrients promote good health and help to prevent some diseases.\n\nThe international effort to start enriching flour was launched during the 1940s as a means to improve the health of the wartime populations of the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[United States]] while food was being rationed and alternative sources of the nutrients were scarce.{{clarify | reason=The meaning of \"international effort\" to improve health in 2 countries seems odd; clarify or provide citation? | date=January 2014}}  The decision to choose flour for enrichment was based on its commonality in the diets of those wartime populations, ranging from the rich to the poor. A major factor in the switch to enriched flour in the United States was the U.S. Army's restriction in 1942, that it would purchase only enriched flour.\n\n== Flour processing and nutrient loss ==\nThe conversion of grains to flour involves several steps that vary with the type of grain used. The initial stages of processing remove the [[bran]] and the [[Cereal germ|germ]] of the seed. The bran is the outermost layer of grains that contains fiber (primarily insoluble), some protein, and trace minerals. The germ is the embryo of the seed that contains B vitamins and trace minerals. Because the germ has a fat content of 10%, it may reduce shelf-life. Thus, it is separated to ensure longer shelf life of the flour. In contrast to enriched flour, whole wheat flour contains both the bran and the germ. The remaining and largest portion of the seed is the [[endosperm]]. It acts as a nutrient reservoir for the developing embryo. The endosperm contains a large amount of carbohydrates, protein, iron, B vitamins (niacin and riboflavin), and soluble fiber. \n\nOnce the endosperm is isolated, it is ground into a fine powder and sifted to remove any remaining fragments of bran or germ. Next, a chemical bleaching process is used to give the flour a whiter color.

These restored nutrients include [[iron]] and [[B vitamins]] (folic acid, riboflavin, niacin, and thiamine). Calcium may also be supplemented. The purpose of enriching flour is to replenish the nutrients in the flour to match the nutritional status of the unrefined product. This differentiates enrichment from [[Food fortification|fortification]], which is the process of introducing new nutrients to a food.\n\n== History ==\n{{no footnotes|date=May 2013}}\n\nWhite flour became adopted in many cultures because it was recognized as being healthier than dark flours during the late Middle Ages. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The unknown factor for its benefit at that time was that [[mold]] and [[fungus]] in the grains, which led to several diseases, were eliminated in the processing that resulted in white flour. \n\nIn the 1920s, [[Benjamin R. Jacobs]] began to document the loss of essential nutrients, however, through this processing of [[cereal]]s and [[grain]]s and to demonstrate a method by which the end products could be enriched with the lost nutrients. These nutrients promote good health and help to prevent some diseases.\n\nThe international effort to start enriching flour was launched during the 1940s as a means to improve the health of the wartime populations of the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[United States]] while food was being rationed and alternative sources of the nutrients were scarce.{{clarify | reason=The meaning of \"international effort\" to improve health in 2 countries seems odd; clarify or provide citation? | date=January 2014}}  The decision to choose flour for enrichment was based on its commonality in the diets of those wartime populations, ranging from the rich to the poor. A major factor in the switch to enriched flour in the United States was the U.S. Army's restriction in 1942, that it would purchase only enriched flour.\n\n== Flour processing and nutrient loss ==\nThe conversion of grains to flour involves several steps that vary with the type of grain used. The initial stages of processing remove the [[bran]] and the [[Cereal germ|germ]] of the seed. The bran is the outermost layer of grains that contains fiber (primarily insoluble), some protein, and trace minerals. The germ is the embryo of the seed that contains B vitamins and trace minerals. Because the germ has a fat content of 10%, it may reduce shelf-life. Thus, it is separated to ensure longer shelf life of the flour. In contrast to enriched flour, whole wheat flour contains both the bran and the germ. The remaining and largest portion of the seed is the [[endosperm]]. It acts as a nutrient reservoir for the developing embryo. The endosperm contains a large amount of carbohydrates, protein, iron, B vitamins (niacin and riboflavin), and soluble fiber. \n\nOnce the endosperm is isolated, it is ground into a fine powder and sifted to remove any remaining fragments of bran or germ. Next, a chemical bleaching process is used to give the flour a whiter color. This bleaching step, usually with chlorine or benzoyl peroxide, destroys many of the original nutrients that were present in the flour. The final flour product contains a smaller portion of the original nutrients that were present in the seed prior to processing. Enrichment ensures that these important nutrients are restored to improve the quality of the flour.\n\n== Enrichment requirements ==\nAccording to the U.S. [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/get-cfr.cgi?TITLE=21&PART=137&SECTION=165&YEAR=2001&TYPE=TEXT FDA], a pound of enriched flour must have the following quantities of nutrients to qualify: 2.9 milligrams of [[thiamin]], 1.8 milligrams of [[riboflavin]], 24 milligrams of [[niacin]], 0.7 milligrams of \n[[folic acid]], and 20 milligrams of [[iron]]. The first four nutrients are [[B vitamin]]s. [[Calcium]] also may be added; this must be to a minimum level of 960 milligrams per pound if calcium is mentioned in the labeling.

He appears in the films ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' and ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'', in the [[animated television series]] ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'' and ''[[Extreme Ghostbusters]]'', in the video games ''[[Ghostbusters: The Video Game]]'' and [[Beeline (software company)|Beeline's ''Ghostbusters'']]. Spengler was portrayed by [[Harold Ramis]] in the films and voiced by him in ''[[Ghostbusters: The Video Game]]'' and ''[[Lego Dimensions]]'', and voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]] in the cartoon series. He is a member of the Ghostbusters and one of the three doctors of [[parapsychology]], along with Dr. [[Peter Venkman]] and Dr. [[Ray Stantz]].\n\n==Creation and conception==\nThe character of Egon Spengler was named after [[Oswald Spengler]] and a classmate of Ramis at [[Senn High School]], Egon Donsbach, a Hungarian refugee.<ref>Ghostbusters DVD Commentary</ref>\n\n[[Christopher Walken]], [[John Lithgow]], [[Christopher Lloyd]] and [[Jeff Goldblum]] were all considered for the role of Egon Spengler, before Ramis, who had gotten close to the character while writing him, felt compelled to play it himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shortlist.com/entertainment/films/30-ghostbusters-facts |title=30 things you (probably) didn't know about Ghostbusters &#124; ShortList Magazine |website=Shortlist.com |date=1984-06-08 |accessdate=2016-07-17}}</ref>\n\nLaMarche stated that when he auditioned for the part of Spengler in ''The Real Ghostbusters'', he was asked not to do an impression of Ramis, which he ignored because impressions were one of his strengths as a performer, and there was no other way he could imagine properly portraying the character other than to follow Ramis's example. He got the part anyway and said in an interview that he did two different takes: in which he impersonated Ramis, the other in which he tried a more \"[[Woody Allen]]\"-like approach that did not suit the character's physicality, he admitted.<ref>\"The Real Ghostbusters\" DVD vol. 1, Special Features: Ain't Afraid Of No Ghost: Creating The Real Ghostbusters (October 2008)</ref>\n\n==Character==\nEgon Spengler is a tall, [[laconic]], [[bespectacled]], awkward member of the team responsible for the main theoretical framework for their [[paranormal]]/[[quantum]] studies. Being addicted to science, he is the creator of the [[List of Ghostbusters equipment|Ghostbusters' equipment]] along with Raymond Stantz, thus making him the brains of the Ghostbusters. Although book smart, Spengler does not have much social ability, as demonstrated by his stiff interactions with the Ghostbusters' secretary [[Janine Melnitz]], and his reliance on Peter Venkman as spokesperson for the group.\n\nSpengler is the most serious and rigid member of the team. Of his hobbies, Spengler states that he collects \"[[spore]]s, [[Mold (fungus)|mold]]s, and [[fungus]]\", and claims that, as a child, the only toy he ever had was \"part of a [[Slinky]]\", which he straightened out. As implied in the first movie, Spengler apparently is a sugar junkie, due to his affection for sweets and candy. According to the 2009 video game, Spengler sleeps an average of 14 minutes per day, leaving him \"a lot of time to work.\"\n\n==Appearances==\n===Film===\n====''Ghostbusters'' (1984)====\n{{main|Ghostbusters}}\nEgon was very interested in paranormal phenomena, even while working with Ray Stantz and Peter Venkman at the University. He and Ray Stantz studied paranormal literature in their spare time and were interested in theories of reincarnation.\n\nEgon was usually the first to interview case subjects, adding to their mantra, \"we're ready to believe you.\" Examples were Dana Barrett from her Zuul encounter and her carriage phenomenon with Oscar. Even people Peter called \"schizo\" always went to either Egon or Ray to describe their paranormal experiences, no matter how far-fetched their stories were. For his part, Venkman once took back everything negative he said about him, rewarding the fellow scientist with his favorite candy bar (a Crunch bar). Egon's only weakness is evidently sugar (or at least snacks), as he is seen, on occasion, snacking.\n\nEgon developed the technology behind the P.K.E. Meter, the Proton Pack, the Trap, and the storage facility. He was also aware of the risk of crossing the streams. He spent a lot of time focusing on the stability of the storage facility, and was concerned about the possibilities of a P.K.E. surge of dangerous proportions. Egon was particularly critical of Walter Peck's actions, and his attitude that the Ghostbusters were responsible for the explosion of the containment unit that occurred when Peck ordered a municipal worker to shut the unit down. After their encounter with Stay Puft, Egon suggested an atypical solution when he recommended blasting Gozer's dimensional portal while crossing the proton streams to reverse the particle flow and send Gozer back to his/its dimension.\n\nEgon once tried to drill a hole in his own head (a process known as [[trepanning]]), which he says \"would have worked\" if Venkman had not stopped him.<ref>[[Harold Ramis]] wrote the line about Egon trying to drill a hole in his head. It was inspired by a thwarted experiment by [[John C. Lilly|John Lilly]], a prominent researcher in [[dolphin]] [[communication]] who proposed drilling a hole in his head to test some higher brain function. See also: ''Making Ghostbusters'' - Page 27.</ref>\n\n====''Ghostbusters II'' (1989)====\n{{main|Ghostbusters II}}\nDue to the large amount of collateral damage the city of New York suffered from the battle with Gozer, the Ghostbusters were sued by nearly every county and city agency in New York. Additionally a judicial restraining order was enacted which barred the Ghostbusters from performing services as paranormal investigators and eliminators, effectively putting them out of business. Five years after the events of the first film Egon was working at the Institute for Advanced Theoretical Research and was conducting experiments on human emotions. A negative test involved keeping a couple with marriage problems locked in a room for hours and gradually raising the temperature. A positive test involved a girl in a room with dozens of stuffed animals and a puppy.\n\nHe was the first person Dana Barrett contacted when her baby carriage took off by itself. Egon recommended bringing in Ray, and they both performed a physical exam on Dana's son Oscar. Egon, along with Peter and Ray were later arrested after digging a large hole under First Avenue as part of their paranormal investigations to help Dana.\n\nDuring the course of their trial they were found guilty of willful destruction of public property, fraud, violating their judicial restraining order, and malicious mischief by judge Stephen Wexler (whom Egon said was known as \"The Hammer\"). While angrily insulting the trio judge Wexler inadvertently released the ghosts of the Scoleri Brothers; two murderers he sentenced to death by the electric chair. During the chaos judge Wexler dismisses the charges against the Ghostbusters, and rescinds the judicial restraining order allowing Egon, Ray, and Peter to capture the ghosts, effectively putting the Ghostbusters back in business. Egon had a dry sense of humor, of which he used on Peter to bewilder him, and smirked at his friend's cluelessness on what the word \"epididymis\" was.\n\nEgon primarily worked with Ray, both of whom were still living at the Firehouse, conducting research on the pink slime. Still very scientifically minded, Egon seems to have loosened up a little bit, letting his sense of humor show and even giving Dana a smile and Peter (who was carried away with photographing Vigo's portrait), a knowing smile.\n\n====''Ghostbusters'' (2016)====\n{{main|Ghostbusters (2016 film)}}\nAlthough the 2016 ''Ghostbusters'' film is a reboot, the film's marketing confirms that a version of Egon Spengler does exist in the film's [[fictional universe]]. According to a tie-in video to the film, [[Kate McKinnon]]'s character Dr. Jillian Holtzmann and Harold Ramis' character Dr. Egon Spengler created the film's proton packs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.proton-pack.com/ |title=Sony Global |publisher=Proton Pack |date=2016-04-02 |accessdate=2016-07-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UWbASEi7_o/ |title=Sony develops the world\u2019s first ghost catching device - The Proton Pack\u2122 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2016-03-31 |accessdate=2016-07-17}}</ref> The paragraph accompanying the video read:\n<blockquote>\n''Engineers at Sony Corporation developed the 2016 Proton Pack\u2122 in collaboration with nuclear engineer and munitions expert Dr. Jillian Holtzmann. Sony President and CEO Kazuo Hirai commented \u201cThe perfection of the Proton Pack\u2122, long a dream of the world\u2019s greatest engineers since first pioneered by'' '''''Dr. Egon Spengler''''' ''of Columbia University, is an example of Sony\u2019s relentless pursuit of innovation. It absolutely delivers the wow factor that is so important to our company mission.''\n</blockquote>\n\nAdditionally, in the film, a bronze bust of Harold Ramis as the film's version of Spengler is seen just as Erin Gilbert leaves her office. During the credits of ''Ghostbusters'', the words \"For Harold Ramis\" are seen.\n\n====''Ghostbusters: Afterlife'' (2020)====\n{{main|Ghostbusters: Afterlife}}\n\nIn the 2020 film, which serves as a direct sequel to the original ''Ghostbusters'' and ''Ghostbusters II'', Egon has since passed away and left a house and land, containing Ghostbusters gear, to his daughter Callie and his two grandchildren Phoebe and Trevor. \nAfter the near destruction of New York in 1989, cases of paranormal activity ceased and the Ghostbusters shut up shop. Egon spent years investigating Ivo Shandor and bought a ranch near to the mine that the architect used to build Spook Central. Egon discovered that the portal to the Gozer Dimension was only closed and not destroyed, and the Selenium mineral was still supercharged in the earth from the events of 1984.\nBefore he died he left instruction for his family hidden at his ranch. The kids in the film seek the help of their teacher Mr Gooberson who was a young recruit of the original Ghostbusters team in the early 1990s before it closed. He tracks down the old team.<ref name=\"FirstLook\">{{Cite web|url=https://hnentertainment.co/ghostbusters-afterlife-trailer-reveals-the-family-is-indeed-related-to-egon-spengler/|title= Ghostbusters: Afterlife Trailer Reveals The Family Is Indeed Related to Egon Spengler|first=Christopher|last=Marc|date=2019-09-12|website=HN Entertainment.co|accessdate=2019-10-12}}</ref>\n\n===Television===\n====''The Real Ghostbusters''====\n{{main|The Real Ghostbusters}}\nSpengler's hair was changed from brown in the films (Ramis's natural hair color) to a blond [[pompadour (hairstyle)|pompadour]] in the animated series (Spengler wore his hair in a ponytail on ''[[Extreme Ghostbusters]]''). This was reportedly done due to legal issues concerning character / actor likenesses.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nDespite his leanings toward science, Spengler has a family history of [[witchcraft]] (three ancestors, Zedekiah, Eli and Ezekiel, were wizards), of which he is not so much ashamed as \"strongly\" considers irrelevant, mainly because he sees science as relevant. Spengler's faith in science was also tested in one episode where the Ghostbusters get abducted to the ghost world by the ghost of [[Al Capone]]. Spengler's scientific equipment fails until he is told by former [[caporegime|capo]]s of Capone (who aid the Ghostbusters in revenge for Capone double-crossing them) that only magic can harm ghosts in the ghost world as opposed to science harming ghosts in the human world, thus forcing Spengler to accept the wizardry methods of his ancestors to defeat Capone.\n\nHe is the love interest of [[Janine Melnitz]], the Ghostbusters' secretary, in the first film and both animated series (''[[Ghostbusters II]]'' excluded their romance due to Ramis' dislike of the subplot, thus having Melnitz date Louis Tully instead). Spengler sometimes appears to be unaware of Melnitz's romantic interest in him, but at times he displays having similar feelings for her, such as when he gave her a [[Pelargonium|geranium]] as a gift when she expressed an interest in plants (which backfired horribly when it was revealed that the geranium was possessed by a ghost and nearly destroyed her apartment, along with much of Brooklyn; though Spengler managed to thwart the ghost, Melnitz angrily told Spengler he would have to pay for the damages to her home) and when he rushed to her rescue in \"Janine, You've Changed\"; he also embraces her in \"Ghost Busted\" after she was kidnapped and held for ransom by a gangster, and became jealous when she was briefly involved with a slimy businessman named Paul Smart.\n\nIn the episode \"Cry Uncle\", Spengler's well-meaning but skeptical uncle Cyrus, visits him and, since he does not believe that Spengler's work with the Ghostbusters is real scientific work and therefore a waste of Spengler's genius, tries to make him come back to [[Ohio]] (where Spengler grew up) to work at his uncle's lab, but fortunately, after his uncle accidentally releases the [[Stay Puft Marshmallow Man]] from the containment unit, he realizes that ghosts are real and accepts Spengler's work.\n\nThroughout the series, Spengler would have his soul switched with that of a demon, have his molecular structure destabilized to the point that it stranded him in the [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|Netherworld]] (requiring him to be rescued by the others), regress into a baby, turn into a were-chicken, and have his intellect switched with [[Slimer]]'s. He has however, ceased his sugar junkie ways, only to briefly be tempted by a candy store when in Slimer's body (a likely fact that Slimer was an overt glutton).\n\nIt is revealed in \"The Boogieman Cometh\" that, as a child, Spengler was stalked by the [[boogieman]], a supernatural monster that fed on the fear of children and hid in their closets, and was particularly fond of Spengler's fear; it was these encounters with the creature that inspired Spengler to study the paranormal, and as an adult, he would battle the Boogieman twice and defeat him.\n\nIt is implied in one episode of the animated series that Spengler accidentally burned down his family's garage.\n\n====''Extreme Ghostbusters''====\n{{main|Extreme Ghostbusters}}\nSpengler is the only original Ghostbuster to return for the ''[[Extreme Ghostbusters]]'' series as a regular, acting as a mentor to the new Ghostbusters (the others appeared for a two-part episode, \"Back in the Saddle\"), and monitoring and sustaining the Containment Unit while working as a paranormal studies professor at a university. He is the [[de facto]] leader of the new, younger team of Ghostbusters; although the old team had gone into retirement after they apparently dealt with all the ghosts in the city, after the digging of a new subway tunnel resulted in the release of an ancient ghost, Spengler was forced to recruit his only four current students to act as the new Ghostbusters.\n\nAlthough willing to do his share of the legwork, Spengler overestimates his abilities and his aging becomes apparent when he is no longer able to work at the same level as in his younger days, generally working at the firehouse doing research while the team handle the actual 'Ghostbusting', though when the situation calls for it he will help. Melnitz is still carrying a torch for him, which leaves him a little flustered. He celebrates his 40th birthday during this series, which would put him in his late twenties when ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'' began. Age is the largest factor causing Spengler to having transition from active ghost hunting to a [[mentorship]] role; in one episode where the original Ghostbusters guest starred on an episode the audience clearly sees middle adulthood has affected the speed and weakened the stamina of the original Ghostbusters.\n\n====''The Earth Day Special''====\n{{main|The Earth Day Special}}\nAlthough Egon Spengler does not appear in the 1990 ''[[The Earth Day Special]]'', his character and status as a Ghostbuster is mentioned, and [[Harold Ramis]] portrays his twin brother, named Elon Spengler, who is the President of the Wastebusters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-mK907DpKU |title=Wastebusters! |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2008-04-21 |accessdate=2016-07-17}}</ref>\n\n===Video games===\n====''Ghostbusters: The Video Game''====\n{{main|Ghostbusters: The Video Game}}\nA likeness of Ramis, circa 1991 (the year in which the game takes place) appears in the ''[[Ghostbusters: The Video Game]]'' that was released on June 16, 2009.

He and Ray instruct the Rookie in the use of the Proton Pack and its eventual PCS upgrades. Over the course of the game, it becomes evident that he was somewhat traumatized by their exhausting trek up the stairs of 55 Central Park West.

He appears in the films ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' and ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'', in the [[animated television series]] ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'' and ''[[Extreme Ghostbusters]]'', in the video games ''[[Ghostbusters: The Video Game]]'' and [[Beeline (software company)|Beeline's ''Ghostbusters'']]. Spengler was portrayed by [[Harold Ramis]] in the films and voiced by him in ''[[Ghostbusters: The Video Game]]'' and ''[[Lego Dimensions]]'', and voiced by [[Maurice LaMarche]] in the cartoon series. He is a member of the Ghostbusters and one of the three doctors of [[parapsychology]], along with Dr. [[Peter Venkman]] and Dr. [[Ray Stantz]].\n\n==Creation and conception==\nThe character of Egon Spengler was named after [[Oswald Spengler]] and a classmate of Ramis at [[Senn High School]], Egon Donsbach, a Hungarian refugee.<ref>Ghostbusters DVD Commentary</ref>\n\n[[Christopher Walken]], [[John Lithgow]], [[Christopher Lloyd]] and [[Jeff Goldblum]] were all considered for the role of Egon Spengler, before Ramis, who had gotten close to the character while writing him, felt compelled to play it himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shortlist.com/entertainment/films/30-ghostbusters-facts |title=30 things you (probably) didn't know about Ghostbusters &#124; ShortList Magazine |website=Shortlist.com |date=1984-06-08 |accessdate=2016-07-17}}</ref>\n\nLaMarche stated that when he auditioned for the part of Spengler in ''The Real Ghostbusters'', he was asked not to do an impression of Ramis, which he ignored because impressions were one of his strengths as a performer, and there was no other way he could imagine properly portraying the character other than to follow Ramis's example. He got the part anyway and said in an interview that he did two different takes: in which he impersonated Ramis, the other in which he tried a more \"[[Woody Allen]]\"-like approach that did not suit the character's physicality, he admitted.<ref>\"The Real Ghostbusters\" DVD vol. 1, Special Features: Ain't Afraid Of No Ghost: Creating The Real Ghostbusters (October 2008)</ref>\n\n==Character==\nEgon Spengler is a tall, [[laconic]], [[bespectacled]], awkward member of the team responsible for the main theoretical framework for their [[paranormal]]/[[quantum]] studies. Being addicted to science, he is the creator of the [[List of Ghostbusters equipment|Ghostbusters' equipment]] along with Raymond Stantz, thus making him the brains of the Ghostbusters. Although book smart, Spengler does not have much social ability, as demonstrated by his stiff interactions with the Ghostbusters' secretary [[Janine Melnitz]], and his reliance on Peter Venkman as spokesperson for the group.\n\nSpengler is the most serious and rigid member of the team. Of his hobbies, Spengler states that he collects \"[[spore]]s, [[mold]]s, and [[fungus]]\", and claims that, as a child, the only toy he ever had was \"part of a [[Slinky]]\", which he straightened out. As implied in the first movie, Spengler apparently is a sugar junkie, due to his affection for sweets and candy. According to the 2009 video game, Spengler sleeps an average of 14 minutes per day, leaving him \"a lot of time to work.\"\n\n==Appearances==\n===Film===\n====''Ghostbusters'' (1984)====\n{{main|Ghostbusters}}\nEgon was very interested in paranormal phenomena, even while working with Ray Stantz and Peter Venkman at the University. He and Ray Stantz studied paranormal literature in their spare time and were interested in theories of reincarnation.\n\nEgon was usually the first to interview case subjects, adding to their mantra, \"we're ready to believe you.\" Examples were Dana Barrett from her Zuul encounter and her carriage phenomenon with Oscar. Even people Peter called \"schizo\" always went to either Egon or Ray to describe their paranormal experiences, no matter how far-fetched their stories were. For his part, Venkman once took back everything negative he said about him, rewarding the fellow scientist with his favorite candy bar (a Crunch bar). Egon's only weakness is evidently sugar (or at least snacks), as he is seen, on occasion, snacking.\n\nEgon developed the technology behind the P.K.E. Meter, the Proton Pack, the Trap, and the storage facility. He was also aware of the risk of crossing the streams. He spent a lot of time focusing on the stability of the storage facility, and was concerned about the possibilities of a P.K.E. surge of dangerous proportions. Egon was particularly critical of Walter Peck's actions, and his attitude that the Ghostbusters were responsible for the explosion of the containment unit that occurred when Peck ordered a municipal worker to shut the unit down. After their encounter with Stay Puft, Egon suggested an atypical solution when he recommended blasting Gozer's dimensional portal while crossing the proton streams to reverse the particle flow and send Gozer back to his/its dimension.\n\nEgon once tried to drill a hole in his own head (a process known as [[trepanning]]), which he says \"would have worked\" if Venkman had not stopped him.<ref>[[Harold Ramis]] wrote the line about Egon trying to drill a hole in his head. It was inspired by a thwarted experiment by [[John C. Lilly|John Lilly]], a prominent researcher in [[dolphin]] [[communication]] who proposed drilling a hole in his head to test some higher brain function. See also: ''Making Ghostbusters'' - Page 27.</ref>\n\n====''Ghostbusters II'' (1989)====\n{{main|Ghostbusters II}}\nDue to the large amount of collateral damage the city of New York suffered from the battle with Gozer, the Ghostbusters were sued by nearly every county and city agency in New York. Additionally a judicial restraining order was enacted which barred the Ghostbusters from performing services as paranormal investigators and eliminators, effectively putting them out of business. Five years after the events of the first film Egon was working at the Institute for Advanced Theoretical Research and was conducting experiments on human emotions. A negative test involved keeping a couple with marriage problems locked in a room for hours and gradually raising the temperature. A positive test involved a girl in a room with dozens of stuffed animals and a puppy.\n\nHe was the first person Dana Barrett contacted when her baby carriage took off by itself. Egon recommended bringing in Ray, and they both performed a physical exam on Dana's son Oscar. Egon, along with Peter and Ray were later arrested after digging a large hole under First Avenue as part of their paranormal investigations to help Dana.\n\nDuring the course of their trial they were found guilty of willful destruction of public property, fraud, violating their judicial restraining order, and malicious mischief by judge Stephen Wexler (whom Egon said was known as \"The Hammer\"). While angrily insulting the trio judge Wexler inadvertently released the ghosts of the Scoleri Brothers; two murderers he sentenced to death by the electric chair. During the chaos judge Wexler dismisses the charges against the Ghostbusters, and rescinds the judicial restraining order allowing Egon, Ray, and Peter to capture the ghosts, effectively putting the Ghostbusters back in business. Egon had a dry sense of humor, of which he used on Peter to bewilder him, and smirked at his friend's cluelessness on what the word \"epididymis\" was.\n\nEgon primarily worked with Ray, both of whom were still living at the Firehouse, conducting research on the pink slime. Still very scientifically minded, Egon seems to have loosened up a little bit, letting his sense of humor show and even giving Dana a smile and Peter (who was carried away with photographing Vigo's portrait), a knowing smile.\n\n====''Ghostbusters'' (2016)====\n{{main|Ghostbusters (2016 film)}}\nAlthough the 2016 ''Ghostbusters'' film is a reboot, the film's marketing confirms that a version of Egon Spengler does exist in the film's [[fictional universe]]. According to a tie-in video to the film, [[Kate McKinnon]]'s character Dr. Jillian Holtzmann and Harold Ramis' character Dr. Egon Spengler created the film's proton packs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.proton-pack.com/ |title=Sony Global |publisher=Proton Pack |date=2016-04-02 |accessdate=2016-07-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UWbASEi7_o/ |title=Sony develops the world\u2019s first ghost catching device - The Proton Pack\u2122 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2016-03-31 |accessdate=2016-07-17}}</ref> The paragraph accompanying the video read:\n<blockquote>\n''Engineers at Sony Corporation developed the 2016 Proton Pack\u2122 in collaboration with nuclear engineer and munitions expert Dr. Jillian Holtzmann. Sony President and CEO Kazuo Hirai commented \u201cThe perfection of the Proton Pack\u2122, long a dream of the world\u2019s greatest engineers since first pioneered by'' '''''Dr. Egon Spengler''''' ''of Columbia University, is an example of Sony\u2019s relentless pursuit of innovation. It absolutely delivers the wow factor that is so important to our company mission.''\n</blockquote>\n\nAdditionally, in the film, a bronze bust of Harold Ramis as the film's version of Spengler is seen just as Erin Gilbert leaves her office. During the credits of ''Ghostbusters'', the words \"For Harold Ramis\" are seen.\n\n====''Ghostbusters: Afterlife'' (2020)====\n{{main|Ghostbusters: Afterlife}}\n\nIn the 2020 film, which serves as a direct sequel to the original ''Ghostbusters'' and ''Ghostbusters II'', Egon has since passed away and left a house and land, containing Ghostbusters gear, to his daughter Callie and his two grandchildren Phoebe and Trevor. \nAfter the near destruction of New York in 1989, cases of paranormal activity ceased and the Ghostbusters shut up shop. Egon spent years investigating Ivo Shandor and bought a ranch near to the mine that the architect used to build Spook Central. Egon discovered that the portal to the Gozer Dimension was only closed and not destroyed, and the Selenium mineral was still supercharged in the earth from the events of 1984.\nBefore he died he left instruction for his family hidden at his ranch. The kids in the film seek the help of their teacher Mr Gooberson who was a young recruit of the original Ghostbusters team in the early 1990s before it closed. He tracks down the old team.<ref name=\"FirstLook\">{{Cite web|url=https://hnentertainment.co/ghostbusters-afterlife-trailer-reveals-the-family-is-indeed-related-to-egon-spengler/|title= Ghostbusters: Afterlife Trailer Reveals The Family Is Indeed Related to Egon Spengler|first=Christopher|last=Marc|date=2019-09-12|website=HN Entertainment.co|accessdate=2019-10-12}}</ref>\n\n===Television===\n====''The Real Ghostbusters''====\n{{main|The Real Ghostbusters}}\nSpengler's hair was changed from brown in the films (Ramis's natural hair color) to a blond [[pompadour (hairstyle)|pompadour]] in the animated series (Spengler wore his hair in a ponytail on ''[[Extreme Ghostbusters]]''). This was reportedly done due to legal issues concerning character / actor likenesses.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nDespite his leanings toward science, Spengler has a family history of [[witchcraft]] (three ancestors, Zedekiah, Eli and Ezekiel, were wizards), of which he is not so much ashamed as \"strongly\" considers irrelevant, mainly because he sees science as relevant. Spengler's faith in science was also tested in one episode where the Ghostbusters get abducted to the ghost world by the ghost of [[Al Capone]]. Spengler's scientific equipment fails until he is told by former [[caporegime|capo]]s of Capone (who aid the Ghostbusters in revenge for Capone double-crossing them) that only magic can harm ghosts in the ghost world as opposed to science harming ghosts in the human world, thus forcing Spengler to accept the wizardry methods of his ancestors to defeat Capone.\n\nHe is the love interest of [[Janine Melnitz]], the Ghostbusters' secretary, in the first film and both animated series (''[[Ghostbusters II]]'' excluded their romance due to Ramis' dislike of the subplot, thus having Melnitz date Louis Tully instead). Spengler sometimes appears to be unaware of Melnitz's romantic interest in him, but at times he displays having similar feelings for her, such as when he gave her a [[Pelargonium|geranium]] as a gift when she expressed an interest in plants (which backfired horribly when it was revealed that the geranium was possessed by a ghost and nearly destroyed her apartment, along with much of Brooklyn; though Spengler managed to thwart the ghost, Melnitz angrily told Spengler he would have to pay for the damages to her home) and when he rushed to her rescue in \"Janine, You've Changed\"; he also embraces her in \"Ghost Busted\" after she was kidnapped and held for ransom by a gangster, and became jealous when she was briefly involved with a slimy businessman named Paul Smart.\n\nIn the episode \"Cry Uncle\", Spengler's well-meaning but skeptical uncle Cyrus, visits him and, since he does not believe that Spengler's work with the Ghostbusters is real scientific work and therefore a waste of Spengler's genius, tries to make him come back to [[Ohio]] (where Spengler grew up) to work at his uncle's lab, but fortunately, after his uncle accidentally releases the [[Stay Puft Marshmallow Man]] from the containment unit, he realizes that ghosts are real and accepts Spengler's work.\n\nThroughout the series, Spengler would have his soul switched with that of a demon, have his molecular structure destabilized to the point that it stranded him in the [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|Netherworld]] (requiring him to be rescued by the others), regress into a baby, turn into a were-chicken, and have his intellect switched with [[Slimer]]'s. He has however, ceased his sugar junkie ways, only to briefly be tempted by a candy store when in Slimer's body (a likely fact that Slimer was an overt glutton).\n\nIt is revealed in \"The Boogieman Cometh\" that, as a child, Spengler was stalked by the [[boogieman]], a supernatural monster that fed on the fear of children and hid in their closets, and was particularly fond of Spengler's fear; it was these encounters with the creature that inspired Spengler to study the paranormal, and as an adult, he would battle the Boogieman twice and defeat him.\n\nIt is implied in one episode of the animated series that Spengler accidentally burned down his family's garage.\n\n====''Extreme Ghostbusters''====\n{{main|Extreme Ghostbusters}}\nSpengler is the only original Ghostbuster to return for the ''[[Extreme Ghostbusters]]'' series as a regular, acting as a mentor to the new Ghostbusters (the others appeared for a two-part episode, \"Back in the Saddle\"), and monitoring and sustaining the Containment Unit while working as a paranormal studies professor at a university. He is the [[de facto]] leader of the new, younger team of Ghostbusters; although the old team had gone into retirement after they apparently dealt with all the ghosts in the city, after the digging of a new subway tunnel resulted in the release of an ancient ghost, Spengler was forced to recruit his only four current students to act as the new Ghostbusters.\n\nAlthough willing to do his share of the legwork, Spengler overestimates his abilities and his aging becomes apparent when he is no longer able to work at the same level as in his younger days, generally working at the firehouse doing research while the team handle the actual 'Ghostbusting', though when the situation calls for it he will help. Melnitz is still carrying a torch for him, which leaves him a little flustered. He celebrates his 40th birthday during this series, which would put him in his late twenties when ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'' began. Age is the largest factor causing Spengler to having transition from active ghost hunting to a [[mentorship]] role; in one episode where the original Ghostbusters guest starred on an episode the audience clearly sees middle adulthood has affected the speed and weakened the stamina of the original Ghostbusters.\n\n====''The Earth Day Special''====\n{{main|The Earth Day Special}}\nAlthough Egon Spengler does not appear in the 1990 ''[[The Earth Day Special]]'', his character and status as a Ghostbuster is mentioned, and [[Harold Ramis]] portrays his twin brother, named Elon Spengler, who is the President of the Wastebusters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-mK907DpKU |title=Wastebusters! |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2008-04-21 |accessdate=2016-07-17}}</ref>\n\n===Video games===\n====''Ghostbusters: The Video Game''====\n{{main|Ghostbusters: The Video Game}}\nA likeness of Ramis, circa 1991 (the year in which the game takes place) appears in the ''[[Ghostbusters: The Video Game]]'' that was released on June 16, 2009.

He and Ray instruct the Rookie in the use of the Proton Pack and its eventual PCS upgrades. Over the course of the game, it becomes evident that he was somewhat traumatized by their exhausting trek up the stairs of 55 Central Park West. While in the alternate dimension of the library, Egon is heard to groan, \"Oh no,\" and when Ray asks if he saw something scary, Egon replies, \"Stairs, lots of stairs\". Before the \"Return to Sedgewick Hotel\" mission, Stantz comments that Spengler was once a [[coroner]], to which he replied that he maintains interest in the subject as a hobby.\n\n====Beeline's ''Ghostbusters''====\nSpengler appears in [[Beeline (software company)|Beeline]]'s ''Ghostbusters'' game for [[iOS]] alongside his niece, Michelle Ying.
