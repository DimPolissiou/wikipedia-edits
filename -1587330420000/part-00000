The season contains 15 episodes and concluded airing on November 15, 2007.\n\n== Season synopsis ==\nThe Gang's [[narcissism]] spins out of control, as usual. First they decide to do good: Sweet Dee and Mac adopt a baby that was abandoned in a dumpster, Dennis volunteers with environmental rights activists, and everyone in the gang become vigilantes to solve Philadelphia's homeless problem. The gang then hatches several schemes to become famous: Mac, Frank, and Charlie try to be viral video stars by covering the local news while Dennis and Dee seek fame as spoiled, drug-addled club hoppers. Sweet Dee dates a local rapper mistakenly thought to be mentally handicapped by Mac and Dennis, the two of whom start a band, but can't quite pinpoint their genre of music\u2014especially when Charlie comes up with a raunchy, disjointed song about a mysterious creature who violates him in his sleep.\n\nThe Gang's jealousy and greed come roaring back when they fight over Barbara's inheritance, after she wills the house to Dennis. Dee gets jealous of her high school friend (who lost weight and has a successful career in fashion design) and decides to start her very own sweatshop. The entire gang struggles to compete with a local bar owned by a Korean man who looks like [[Kim Jong-il]], and then decide to sell out by offering Paddy's Pub to a corporate chain. Two members of the gang find themselves on the wrong side of the law due to mistaken identity: Mac is suspected to be a serial killer after becoming distant from the gang and Dennis is mistaken for a registered sex offender after a real sex offender (who looks like a fatter version of Dennis) is released from prison due to overcrowding. Meanwhile, the gang sells some cocaine found in a pair of abandoned stereo speakers, forcing them to turn to crime and prostitution to earn the money back before some local Mafia members whack them.\n\nFinally, the gang is forced to save themselves from Charlie's mistakes. First, the McPoyles get revenge on the gang for revealing their false molestation charge (from season one's finale \"Charlie Got Molested\") and inadvertently shooting their brother Doyle (from this season's \"The Gang Gets Invincible\") after he was invited to the Eagles' training camp by taking all of them hostage in their own bar. Finally, Charlie's illiteracy screws over the gang when he accidentally puts the bar up as a prize for a dance marathon, and all the enemies made throughout the course of the series enter the contest so they can take the bar away from the gang. The gang won't let the bar go without a fight\u2014but not before using dirty tricks on each other.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{see also|List of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia characters}}\n=== Main cast ===\n* [[Charlie Day]] as [[Charlie Kelly (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia)|Charlie Kelly]]\n* [[Glenn Howerton]] as Dennis Reynolds / Wendell Albright\n* [[Rob McElhenney]] as [[Mac (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia)|Mac]]\n* [[Kaitlin Olson]] as [[Dee Reynolds]]\n* [[Danny DeVito]] as Frank Reynolds\n\n=== Recurring cast ===\n* [[Mary Elizabeth Ellis]] as [[The Waitress (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia)|The Waitress]]\n* [[David Hornsby]] as Matthew \"Rickety Cricket\" Mara\n\n=== Guest stars ===\n* [[Lynne Marie Stewart]] as Charlie's Mom\n* [[Lucy DeVito]] as Woman\n* [[Jimmi Simpson]] as Liam McPoyle\n* [[Artemis Pebdani]] as Artemis\n* [[Stephen Collins]] as Bruce Mathis\n* [[Sam Witwer]] as Muscular Guy\n* [[Judy Greer]] as Ingrid Nelson\n* [[Kyle Davis (actor)|Kyle Davis]] as Lil' Kevin\n* [[Richard Ruccolo]] as Corporate Rep\n* [[Brittany Daniel]] as Carmen the Transsexual\n* [[Tracey Walter]] as Bum\n* [[Sklar Brothers]] as Fat Michael and DJ Squirrely D\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{See also|List of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia episodes}}\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#AC1D22 |overall=5 |season=5 |title=26 |director=10 |writer=25 |airdate=13 |prodcode=16 |country=US |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia (season 3)\n |EpisodeNumber = 18\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = The Gang Finds a Dumpster Baby\n |DirectedBy = [[Jerry Levine]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Charlie Day]] & [[Rob McElhenney]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|9|13}}\n |ProdCode = IP03001\n |ShortSummary = Dee and Mac find an abandoned baby boy in a dumpster and try to look after (and make money off) him; Frank and Charlie get into dumpster-diving; Charlie is still trying to find out if Frank is his real father; and Dennis tricks an environmentalist into chaining himself to a tree to save it from being cut.\n |LineColor = AC1D22\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia (season 3)\n |EpisodeNumber = 19\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n |Title = The Gang Gets Invincible\n |DirectedBy = [[Fred Savage]]\n |WrittenBy = Charlie Day & [[David Hornsby]] & [[Glenn Howerton]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|9|13}}\n |ProdCode = IP03010\n |ShortSummary = When the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] hold open tryouts \u00e0 la the movie ''[[Invincible (2006 film)|Invincible]]'', Mac, Dennis, and Dee make the event their own personal competition; Frank and Charlie go to a tailgate party, where Frank trips on [[LSD]] and make things worse between them and the McPoyle family from \"Charlie Got Molested\" and \"Charlie Goes America All Over Everybody's Ass.\"\n |LineColor = AC1D22\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia (season 3)\n |EpisodeNumber = 20\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 3\n |Title = Dennis and Dee's Mom Is Dead\n |DirectedBy = [[Matt Shakman]]\n |WrittenBy = David Hornsby & Rob McElhenney\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|9|20}}\n |ProdCode = IP03013\n |ShortSummary = Frank's ex-wife Barbara dies (for real this time), leaving behind a big inheritance that Frank and Dee will do anything to get; Mac, Dennis, and Charlie use Barbara's house as a men's club to make new male friends (\"nothing sexual\").\n |LineColor = AC1D22\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia (season 3)\n |EpisodeNumber = 21\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 4\n |Title = The Gang Gets Held Hostage\n |DirectedBy = Fred Savage\n |WrittenBy = {{StoryTeleplay|s=Lisa Parsons|t=Rob McElhenney}}\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|9|20}}\n |ProdCode = IP03009\n |ShortSummary = The McPoyles hold the Gang hostage in Paddy's Pub; Frank crawls through the vents (a la ''[[Die Hard]]'') to find his will, which Charlie hid.\n |LineColor = AC1D22\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia (season 3)\n |EpisodeNumber = 22\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 5\n |Title = The Aluminum Monster vs. Fatty Magoo\n |DirectedBy = Fred Savage\n |WrittenBy = Charlie Day & Glenn Howerton\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|9|27}}\n |ProdCode = IP03007\n |ShortSummary = The Gang gets involved in the fashion-design world when Dee gets jealous of her high-school best friend ([[Judy Greer]]), who is now a successful boutique owner.

Two members of the gang find themselves on the wrong side of the law due to mistaken identity: Mac is suspected to be a serial killer after becoming distant from the gang and Dennis is mistaken for a registered sex offender after a real sex offender (who looks like a fatter version of Dennis) is released from prison due to overcrowding. Meanwhile, the gang sells some cocaine found in a pair of abandoned stereo speakers, forcing them to turn to crime and prostitution to earn the money back before some local Mafia members whack them.\n\nFinally, the gang is forced to save themselves from Charlie's mistakes. First, the McPoyles get revenge on the gang for revealing their false molestation charge (from season one's finale \"Charlie Got Molested\") and inadvertently shooting their brother Doyle (from this season's \"The Gang Gets Invincible\") after he was invited to the Eagles' training camp by taking all of them hostage in their own bar. Finally, Charlie's illiteracy screws over the gang when he accidentally puts the bar up as a prize for a dance marathon, and all the enemies made throughout the course of the series enter the contest so they can take the bar away from the gang. The gang won't let the bar go without a fight\u2014but not before using dirty tricks on each other.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{see also|List of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia characters}}\n=== Main cast ===\n* [[Charlie Day]] as [[Charlie Kelly (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia)|Charlie Kelly]]\n* [[Glenn Howerton]] as Dennis Reynolds / Wendell Albright\n* [[Rob McElhenney]] as [[Mac (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia)|Mac]]\n* [[Kaitlin Olson]] as [[Dee Reynolds]]\n* [[Danny DeVito]] as Frank Reynolds\n\n=== Recurring cast ===\n* [[Mary Elizabeth Ellis]] as [[The Waitress (It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia)|The Waitress]]\n* [[David Hornsby]] as Matthew \"Rickety Cricket\" Mara\n\n=== Guest stars ===\n* [[Lynne Marie Stewart]] as Charlie's Mom\n* [[Lucy DeVito]] as Woman\n* [[Jimmi Simpson]] as Liam McPoyle\n* [[Artemis Pebdani]] as Artemis\n* [[Stephen Collins]] as Bruce Mathis\n* [[Sam Witwer]] as Muscular Guy\n* [[Judy Greer]] as Ingrid Nelson\n* [[Kyle Davis (actor)|Kyle Davis]] as Lil' Kevin\n* [[Richard Ruccolo]] as Corporate Rep\n* [[Brittany Daniel]] as Carmen the Transsexual\n* [[Tracey Walter]] as Bum\n* [[Sklar Brothers]] as Fat Michael and DJ Squirrely D\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{See also|List of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia episodes}}\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#AC1D22 |overall=5 |season=5 |title=26 |director=10 |writer=25 |airdate=13 |prodcode=16 |country=US |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia (season 3)\n |EpisodeNumber = 18\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = The Gang Finds a Dumpster Baby\n |DirectedBy = [[Jerry Levine]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Charlie Day]] & [[Rob McElhenney]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|9|13}}\n |ProdCode = IP03001\n |ShortSummary = Dee and Mac find an abandoned baby boy in a dumpster and try to look after (and make money off) him; Frank and Charlie get into dumpster-diving; Charlie is still trying to find out if Frank is his real father; and Dennis tricks an environmentalist into chaining himself to a tree to save it from being cut.\n |LineColor = AC1D22\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia (season 3)\n |EpisodeNumber = 19\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n |Title = The Gang Gets Invincible\n |DirectedBy = [[Fred Savage]]\n |WrittenBy = Charlie Day & [[David Hornsby]] & [[Glenn Howerton]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|9|13}}\n |ProdCode = IP03010\n |ShortSummary = When the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] hold open tryouts \u00e0 la the movie ''[[Invincible (2006 film)|Invincible]]'', Mac, Dennis, and Dee make the event their own personal competition; Frank and Charlie go to a tailgate party, where Frank trips on [[LSD]] and make things worse between them and the McPoyle family from \"Charlie Got Molested\" and \"Charlie Goes America All Over Everybody's Ass.\"\n |LineColor = AC1D22\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia (season 3)\n |EpisodeNumber = 20\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 3\n |Title = Dennis and Dee's Mom Is Dead\n |DirectedBy = [[Matt Shakman]]\n |WrittenBy = David Hornsby & Rob McElhenney\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|9|20}}\n |ProdCode = IP03013\n |ShortSummary = Frank's ex-wife Barbara dies (for real this time), leaving behind a big inheritance that Frank and Dee will do anything to get; Mac, Dennis, and Charlie use Barbara's house as a men's club to make new male friends (\"nothing sexual\").\n |LineColor = AC1D22\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia (season 3)\n |EpisodeNumber = 21\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 4\n |Title = The Gang Gets Held Hostage\n |DirectedBy = Fred Savage\n |WrittenBy = {{StoryTeleplay|s=Lisa Parsons|t=Rob McElhenney}}\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|9|20}}\n |ProdCode = IP03009\n |ShortSummary = The McPoyles hold the Gang hostage in Paddy's Pub; Frank crawls through the vents (a la ''[[Die Hard]]'') to find his will, which Charlie hid.\n |LineColor = AC1D22\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia (season 3)\n |EpisodeNumber = 22\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 5\n |Title = The Aluminum Monster vs. Fatty Magoo\n |DirectedBy = Fred Savage\n |WrittenBy = Charlie Day & Glenn Howerton\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|9|27}}\n |ProdCode = IP03007\n |ShortSummary = The Gang gets involved in the fashion-design world when Dee gets jealous of her high-school best friend ([[Judy Greer]]), who is now a successful boutique owner.

Located in the [[diocese of Rochester]], it is the administrative centre of the [[Gravesham|Borough of Gravesham]].\n\nIts geographical situation has given Gravesend strategic importance throughout the [[maritime history|maritime]] and [[History of communication|communications history]] of [[South East England]].

Another theory suggests that the name ''Gravesham'' may be a corruption of the words ''grafs-ham'' \u2013 a place \"at the end of the grove\".<ref>[[Paul Theroux]]'s report that \"the town bore the name of Gravesend because east of it, the dead had to be buried at sea\", is unsupported (Theroux, ''The Kingdom by the Sea'' 1983:19).</ref> Frank Carr<ref>{{cite book|first=Frank|last=Carr|author=|title=Sailing Barges|date=1939|publisher=Terence Dalton Ltd, Suffolk, UK}}</ref> asserts that the name derives from the Saxon ''Gerevesend'', the end of the authority of the [[Portreeve]] (originally ''Portgereve'', chief town administrator). In the Netherlands, a place called [['s-Gravenzande]] is found with its name translating into \"Sand (or sandy area) belonging to the Count\". The ''{{'}}s'' is a contraction of the old Dutch genitive article ''des'', and translates into plain English as ''of the''. In [[Brooklyn, New York]], the neighbourhood of [[Gravesend, Brooklyn|Gravesend]] is said by some to have been named for 's-Gravenzande.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forgotten-ny.com/2000/05/gravesend-brooklyn/|title=Gravesend, Brooklyn - Forgotten New York|publisher=}}</ref>  Though its founding by the English religious dissenter, Lady Deborah Moody, in 1645 strongly indicates that it is named after Gravesend, England.

The Ambassador laid a floral tribute of 21 roses at the base of the statue, symbolising each year of Pocahontas' life.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gravesham.gov.uk/home/news-and-events/news/2017/us-ambassador-visits-gravesend|title=US Ambassador visits Gravesend|first=Gravesham Borough Council - All Rights|last=Reserved|date=1 January 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Windmill Hill===\n{{Main|Windmill Hill, Kent}}\nWindmill Hill, named after its former windmills, offers extensive views across the [[Thames]] and was a popular spot for Victorian visitors to the town because of the [[camera obscura]] installed at the ''Old Mill'' and for its tea gardens and other amusements.\n\nThe hill was the site of a [[beacon]] in 1377, which was instituted by [[Richard II of England|King Richard II]], and still in use 200&nbsp;years later at the time of the [[Spanish Armada]], although the hill was then known as \"Rouge Hill\". A modern beacon was erected and lit in 1988, the 300th anniversary of the Armada.\n\nIt was during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] that the first [[windmill]] was placed at the highest point in Gravesend, 179&nbsp;ft (55&nbsp;m) overlooking the high-water mark of the river. One mill burnt down in 1763 but was replaced the following year and that too demolished in 1894. The last surviving windmill is reported as having been destroyed by fire during [[Mafeking|Mafeking Night]] celebrations in 1900.\n\nDuring [[World War I]] an Imperial German Navy airship passed over Windmill Hill, dropping bombs on it; today there are three markers indicating where these bombs struck.\n\n=== Gravesend Power Station ===\nGravesend power station (TQ 6575 7413) was built by the Gravesend Corporation in 1902-03 to supply local demand for electricity. It was built on the south side of the basin at the west end of the [[Thames and Medway Canal|Thames and Medway canal]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Power Stations of the Lower Thames|last=Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England|first=|publisher=National Monuments Record Centre|year=1995|isbn=|location=Swindon|pages=}}</ref> It comprised a long engine room with a short, taller boiler house to the north, and an office block to the east; the boiler house had three tall chimneys. The engine room walls were of stock brick with red brick dressings. The interior of the engine room was lit by 13 high level circular windows on the long elevation, and tall windows in the west gable end.<ref name=\":0\" /> New generating equipment was added as the demand for electricity increased. The generating capacity, maximum load, and electricity generated and sold was as follows:<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=London County Council|first=|title=London Statistics (various dates)|publisher=London County Council|year=|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Gravesend power station generating capacity, load and electricity produced and sold\n|'''Year'''\n|'''Generating  capacity, MW'''\n|'''Maximum  load, MW'''\n|'''Electricity  generated, GWh'''\n|'''Electricity  sold, GWh'''\n|-\n|1912/3\n|1.050\n|0.855\n|1.601\n|1.179\n|-\n|1918/9\n|1.850\n|1.275\n|3.517\n|2.456\n|-\n|1919/20\n|1.850\n|1.557\n|4.379\n|3.098\n|-\n|1923/4\n|8.400\n|3.125\n|10.241\n|8.135\n|-\n|1936/7\n|13.40\n|9.67\n|11.283\n|33.333\n|}\nIn 1912 the power station was supplying 36 public arc lights and 377 incandescent lights in the town.

By 1966 the installed generating capacity was 12 MW ([[Watt|megawatts]]).<ref name=\":1\">''CEGB Statistical Yearbook'' (various dates).

The [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] cooling system was unusual in being cooled with water abstracted from wells. Due the low [[thermal efficiency]] (8.14 per cent) of the old plant the station produced less than 2 GWh of electricity in each of its final years.<ref name=\":1\" /> The station was decommissioned in 1970. After closure the GEGB converted the station to a scientific research base, which continued in use until 1993.

One of the town's first distinctions was in being given the sole right to transport passengers to and from London by water in the late 14th century. The \"Tilt Boat\" was a familiar sight as it sailed along the Thames, the passengers protected from the weather by a canvas tilt (awning). The first steamboat plied its trade between Gravesend and London in the early 19th century, bringing with it a steadily increasing number of visitors to the Terrace Pier Gardens, Windmill Hill, Springhead Gardens and [[Rosherville Gardens]]. Gravesend soon became one of the first English [[resort town]]s and thrived from an early [[tourist]] trade.\n\nGravesend \"watermen\" were often in a family trade; and the town is the headquarters of the [[Port of London Authority]] [[Port of London|Control Centre]] (formerly known as ''Thames Navigation Service''),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pla.co.uk/ |title=Port of London Authority |website=Pla.co.uk |date= |accessdate=27 February 2016}}</ref> supplying both river and sea pilots. Today radar plays an important role in the navigation of shipping on the River Thames.\n\nA dinghy at an unmodernised Gravesend was the backdrop to the 1952 thriller ''[[The Long Memory]]'' starring [[Sir John Mills]]. In the film, Mills plays a character living in poverty on a derelict fishing boat stranded in the mud flats.\n\nGravesend also has one of England's oldest regattas retained from its strong maritime links with the Thames. Although the origins of the regatta are unknown it dates back at least to [[Tudor era|Tudor times]]. The races are traditionally competed by Gravesend [[skiffs]], {{convert|21|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[Oak#Uses|oak]]en round-bottomed, [[clinker-built]] boats.\n\nThe ''Thames Navigation Service'' was first thought up between 1950 and 1952 by [[Peter de Neumann|Cdr Peter de Neumann GM RN]], while he was captain of [[HM Revenue and Customs|HMRC]] cutter ''Vigilant'' based at '''Gravesend Reach'''. It is possible that Vigilant Way in Gravesend is named for her.  This idea followed on from considering such incidents as the accidental ramming of HMS ''Truculent'' by the ''Divina'' in 1950, the collision with the ''Nore Forts'' by ''Baalbek'', and the disastrous flooding of [[Canvey]], [[Foulness]] and the East Coast in 1953. In these and other situations, rescue and intelligence gathering were severely hampered by a lack of centralised command and control, and lack of a detailed \"picture\". De Neumann resigned his command after returning ''Vigilant'' from the Spithead Review and joined the PLA, immediately suggesting, in a report to them submitted in 1953, that a feasibility study of such a system be carried out.  He then oversaw its development and ultimate installation at Gravesend.\n\n[[File:St Andrew's Art Centre & Gallery at Bawley Bay, Gravesend.JPG|thumb|St Andrew's Art Centre & Gallery, sits between Bawley Bay and Anchor Cove, both being the embarkation points for British colonists sailing to New Zealand and Australia, in the early 19th century.]]\nUntil the building of [[Port of Tilbury|Tilbury Docks]], on the opposite side of the river, between 1882 and 1886, Gravesend was the Thames's first port of entry. Thousands of emigrants, as well as large numbers of troops, embarked from here. [[Tilbury Docks]] have expanded considerably since, with the closure of all the [[London Docks]]. The entrance to the Docks is somewhat awkward, situated as it is on the sharp bend of the river, and boats often need [[tugboat]] assistance, as do the larger ships moored at Tilbury landing stages. There have been many tug companies based at Gravesend: among them the ''Sun Company'', the ''Alexandra Towing Company'' and, today, the ''Smith Howard Towing Company''. [[East Indiamen]] traditionally stopped here at a point known as '''Long Reach''' to lighten their loads before sailing up the [[River Thames|Thames]] to moorings at [[Blackwall, London|Blackwall]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=46535|title=The East India Docks: Historical development', Survey of London: volumes 43 and 44: Poplar, Blackwall and Isle of Dogs|year=1994|accessdate=7 November 2007}}</ref>\n\nFor some years after, war steamer excursions were run on the [[MV Royal Daffodil (1939)|MV ''Royal Daffodil'']] down the Thames from Gravesend to France, but they ceased in 1966.  Cruises are now operated by the [[Lower Thames and Medway Passenger Boat Company]] up the river to [[Greenwich]]. The cross-river passenger ferry to [[Tilbury]] provides a long-established route to and from Essex. Before the [[Dartford Crossing]] came into being, there was a vehicle ferry at Gravesend as well.\n\nThere is a [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution|RNLI lifeboat station]], based at '''Royal Terrace Pier''' ,which has become one of the busiest in the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rnli.org/Pages/default.aspx |title=The RNLI is the charity that saves lives at sea |website=Rnli.org |date=29 January 2016 |accessdate=27 February 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225084107/http://rnli.org/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=25 February 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Thames and Medway Canal===\n{{main|Thames and Medway Canal}}\n[[File:GravesendCanalBasin3456.JPG|thumb|Gravesend Canal Basin]]\nThe [[Thames and Medway Canal]] was opened for barge traffic in 1824. It ran from Gravesend on the Thames to [[Frindsbury]] near [[Strood]] on the [[Medway]]. Although seven miles long, it had only two locks, each {{cvt|94|ft}} by {{cvt|22|ft}} in size, one at each end. Its most notable feature was the tunnel near Strood, which was {{cvt|3,946|yds}} long, the second longest canal tunnel ever built in the UK. The great cost of the tunnel meant that the [[canal]] was not a commercial success.\n\nAfter only 20&nbsp;years, most of the canal was closed and the canal's tunnel was converted to railway use. Initially, canal and railway shared the tunnel, with the single track built on timber supports, but by 1847, canal use was abandoned and a double track laid. Today Gravesend Canal Basin is used for the mooring of [[pleasure craft]]. [[Gravesend Sailing Club]], which was founded so that working men could participate in the sport while still having to earn a living is based here. The lock has been dredged, and restoration and strengthening work has been carried out on the basin walls as part of the regeneration of the area.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Roads===\nThe main roads through the town are the west-east [[A226 road]] from [[Dartford]] and beyond to [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]]; and the [[A227 road]] to [[Tonbridge]]. The [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2 road]] passes two miles (3&nbsp;km) south of Gravesend town centre; a mile stretch of it was rerouted in the early 2000s to take the traffic away from the south end of the town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2005/20052933.htm |title=The A2 Trunk Road (Pepperhill to Cobham and Slip Roads) Order 2005 |website=Opsi.gov.uk |date=4 July 2011 |accessdate=27 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2006 the first of the area\u2019s new [[Fastrack (bus)|Fastrack]] bus services, which use a combination of ordinary roads and dedicated 'bus tracks', opened.

The [[Gravesend West Line]], terminating by the river and for some time operating as a [[English Channel|continental]] ferry connection, closed in 1968.\n\nGravesend is the primary [[North West Kent|north Kent]] interchange for high speed and metro rail services. In December 2009, the full high-speed timetable between London and Kent came into force and passenger usage from Gravesend has exceeded expectations. High-speed services from [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras]] and [[Stratford International railway station|Stratford International]], are offered via Gravesend to the [[Medway]] towns, [[Sittingbourne]], [[Faversham]], [[Margate]], [[Broadstairs]] and [[Ramsgate]]. Some of these services continue to [[Ashford International railway station|Ashford International]] via [[Sandwich railway station|Sandwich]] and [[Dover Priory railway station|Dover Priory]].\n\nThere are also metro services to [[Charing Cross railway station|London Charing Cross]], [[Waterloo East railway station|London Waterloo East]] and [[London Bridge railway station|London Bridge]] via [[Sidcup railway station|Sidcup]], via [[Woolwich Arsenal railway station|Woolwich Arsenal]] and [[Lewisham railway station|Lewisham]] and [[Bexleyheath railway station|Bexleyheath]], and to [[Gillingham (Kent) railway station|Gillingham]].\n\nUnusually Gravesend features a Platform 0, one of the few in the country, it is used for terminating services from [[Cannon Street railway station|London Cannon Street]] or London Charing Cross via Sidcup.\n\n===Buses===\nGravesend is served by several [[Arriva Kent Thameside]] bus services connecting the town with other areas in [[Kent]] including [[Dartford]], [[Bluewater (shopping centre)|Bluewater]] and [[Sevenoaks]] and to the [[Medway Towns]].<br />\nGravesend is also served by [[Fastrack (bus)|Fastrack]] bus services connecting the town with Bluewater, [[Darent Valley Hospital]] and Dartford.\n\n===Ferry===\n[[File:GravesendThames3401.JPG|thumb|The ferry from Tilbury coming alongside at Gravesend]]\n{{main|Gravesend\u2013Tilbury Ferry }} \nPassenger ferry services to [[Tilbury]], [[Essex]], operate daily (except Sundays), from [[Gravesend town pier|Gravesend Town Pier]].\n\n===Footpaths===\n\nThe [[Saxon Shore Way]], a [[long distance footpath]], starts at Gravesend and traces the coast as in [[Roman Empire|Roman times]] as far as [[Hastings]], [[East Sussex]]; 163 miles (262&nbsp;km) in total. The [[Wealdway]] also starts at the Town Pier, and continues almost due south over the [[Weald]] to [[Eastbourne]] in East Sussex where it links with [[South Downs Way]], a distance of 80&nbsp;miles (128&nbsp;km).\n\n==Religious buildings==\nThe town's principal Anglican place of worship is the Church of St George, Gravesend.  This [[Georgian architecture|Georgian building]] is a tourist attraction because of its association with Princess Pocahontas, as well as being the [[parish church]].  Gravesend has three other [[Church of England]] parishes and [[Roman Catholic]], [[Methodist]], [[United Reformed]] and [[Baptist]] churches as well as other smaller chapels.\n\n[[File:GravesendGurdwara3436.JPG|thumb|[[Guru Nanak Darbar Gurdwara]] at Gravesend in November 2007]]\nGravesend has a significant [[Sikh]] population.

By 1893, 4,699 such people had benefited by its presence.  In 2004 the original building, and parts of the newer buildings were demolished to make way for a new community hospital. Gravesend Community Hospital provides a Minor Injury Unit, Dental services, Speech and Language therapy and Physiotherapy. It also has a Stroke Ward and offers inpatient care. The outpatient department provides care for much of the local area and is separate from those offered at Darent Valley Hospital. In addition, Gravesend emergency doctors out of hours service as well as podiatry are offered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kentcht.nhs.uk/home/our-services/gravesham-community-hospital/?entryid109=230335 |title=Kent Community Health NHS Foundation Trust - Gravesham Community Hospital |website=Kentcht.nhs.uk |date= |accessdate=27 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the town centre is a large medical clinic at Swan Yard, next to the Market car park, and several other doctors' surgeries are located in the area.\n\n==Sport==\n===Football===\nThe [[Stonebridge Road]] [[association football|football ground]] at neighbouring [[Northfleet]] is home to [[Ebbsfleet United F.C.]], which changed its name from Gravesend and Northfleet F.C. in June 2007.

The team colours are black and white. \n\nOld Gravesendians RFC (founded in 1929)<ref>J.P Jordan (1949) History of Kent Rugby Football, pages 119-120</ref> consisted traditionally of former Gravesend Grammar School pupils. Prior to the forming of Old Gravesendians RFC, on leaving the Grammar School, former pupils had continued to engage in various sports through the Old Blues Association (founded in 1914).<ref>Gravesend and Dartford Reporter, Saturday 15 January 1921</ref> Owing to [[World War I]] the Old Blues Association practically went to pieces with only one annual dinner having been held in 1914. After the war a reunion dinner was held in 1920, the second annual dinner, which re-started the Old Blues Association activities. The Old Gravesendians RFC was often referred to as 'Gravesend Old Blues' in match reports. Old Gravesendians RFC continued to foster rugby in Gravesend during [[World War II]] by turning out a side every season. Old Gravesendians (Old G's) have had some of their best success in recent seasons reaching six Kent Plate Finals (winning two of these) and achieving promotion to London League rugby in 2009. Unfortunately this proved a step too far with relegation in 2009-10. Old G's put out three sides with the first team playing in [[Shepherd Neame Kent 1]] during the 2018-19 season.

In ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'' Mr. Peggotty, Ham and the Micawbers say their goodbyes and sail away from Gravesend to begin a new life in Australia. In ''[[Great Expectations]]'', Pip, with accomplices, rows Magwitch from London downriver in expectation of waylaying a regular steamer (whilst under way in the Lower Hope, off Gravesend) bound for Hamburg. (Gravesend also appears in ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'').\n\nGravesend is briefly mentioned in the 1818 novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' by [[Mary Shelley]] during Victor's travels through the United Kingdom with Clerval; ultimately culminating in Victor's residence in the [[Orkney Islands]].\n\nAlso in the 1902 novel ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' by [[Joseph Conrad]] the narrator has dark aired Gravesend as the perspective from which we continue our gaze of a sky that is mournfully gloomy over London. Waiting for the tide near the shores of Gravesend is the setting from which shipmate Marlow tells his tale.\n\n''[[The War Game]]'' was a 1965 television drama-documentary film depicting a nuclear war. Written, directed, and produced by Peter Watkins for the BBC's The Wednesday Play anthology series, it caused dismay within the BBC and in government, and was withdrawn before the provisional screening date of Thursday 7 October 1965.[1] The corporation said that \"the effect of the film has been judged by the BBC to be too horrifying for the medium of broadcasting. It will, however, be shown to invited audiences...\"[2] Despite this decision, it was publicly screened and shown abroad, winning the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 1966. The film was eventually broadcast on 31 July 1985 on the BBC, during the week before the fortieth anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing, the day before a repeat screening of Threads.[4] The film was shot in the Kent towns of Tonbridge, Gravesend, Chatham and Dover. The cast was almost entirely made up of non-actors, casting having taken place via a series of local public meetings several months earlier.\n\nThe 1952 film \"[[The Long Memory]]\" starring [[John Mills]] was filmed in and around Gravesend. It features many squalid streets running down towards the river that even then were being progressively cleared for redevelopment. It is also possible to hear in the background steam engines working out of the [[Gravesend West Line]] West Street terminus.

Located in the [[diocese of Rochester]], it is the administrative centre of the [[Gravesham|Borough of Gravesham]].\n\nIts geographical situation has given Gravesend strategic importance throughout the [[maritime history|maritime]] and [[History of communication|communications history]] of [[South East England]].

In the Netherlands, a place called [['s-Gravenzande]] is found with its name translating into \"Sand (or sandy area) belonging to the Count\". The ''{{'}}s'' is a contraction of the old Dutch genitive article ''des'', and translates into plain English as ''of the''. In [[Brooklyn, New York]], the neighbourhood of [[Gravesend, Brooklyn|Gravesend]] is said by some to have been named for 's-Gravenzande.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forgotten-ny.com/2000/05/gravesend-brooklyn/|title=Gravesend, Brooklyn - Forgotten New York|publisher=}}</ref>  Though its founding by the English religious dissenter, Lady Deborah Moody, in 1645 strongly indicates that it is named after Gravesend, England.

Gravesend was incorporated as a Municipal Borough in 1835 under the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]] and Northfleet was constituted an Urban District in 1894 under the [[Local Government Act 1894]]: Gravesend absorbed Milton (1914), Denton, Chalk and part of Northfleet, including Claphall, Singlewell and King's Farm (1935).\n\n==Geography==\nThe location of Gravesend is at a point where the higher land \u2013 the lowest point of the [[dip slope]] of the [[North Downs]] \u2013 reaches the [[river bank]]. To the east are the low-lying Shorne Marshes; to the west, beyond [[Northfleet]] and the Swanscombe Marshes.

One of the town's first distinctions was in being given the sole right to transport passengers to and from London by water in the late 14th century. The \"Tilt Boat\" was a familiar sight as it sailed along the Thames, the passengers protected from the weather by a canvas tilt (awning). The first steamboat plied its trade between Gravesend and London in the early 19th century, bringing with it a steadily increasing number of visitors to the Terrace Pier Gardens, Windmill Hill, Springhead Gardens and [[Rosherville Gardens]]. Gravesend soon became one of the first English [[resort town]]s and thrived from an early [[tourist]] trade.\n\nGravesend \"watermen\" were often in a family trade; and the town is the headquarters of the [[Port of London Authority]] [[Port of London|Control Centre]] (formerly known as ''Thames Navigation Service''),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pla.co.uk/ |title=Port of London Authority |website=Pla.co.uk |date= |accessdate=27 February 2016}}</ref> supplying both river and sea pilots. Today radar plays an important role in the navigation of shipping on the River Thames.\n\nA dinghy at an unmodernised Gravesend was the backdrop to the 1952 thriller ''[[The Long Memory]]'' starring [[Sir John Mills]]. In the film, Mills plays a character living in poverty on a derelict fishing boat stranded in the mud flats.\n\nGravesend also has one of England's oldest regattas retained from its strong maritime links with the Thames. Although the origins of the regatta are unknown it dates back at least to [[Tudor era|Tudor times]]. The races are traditionally competed by Gravesend [[skiffs]], {{convert|21|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[Oak#Uses|oak]]en round-bottomed, [[clinker-built]] boats.\n\nThe ''Thames Navigation Service'' was first thought up between 1950 and 1952 by [[Peter de Neumann|Cdr Peter de Neumann GM RN]], while he was captain of [[HM Revenue and Customs|HMRC]] cutter ''Vigilant'' based at '''Gravesend Reach'''. It is possible that Vigilant Way in Gravesend is named for her.  This idea followed on from considering such incidents as the accidental ramming of HMS ''Truculent'' by the ''Divina'' in 1950, the collision with the ''Nore Forts'' by ''Baalbek'', and the disastrous flooding of [[Canvey]], [[Foulness]] and the East Coast in 1953. In these and other situations, rescue and intelligence gathering were severely hampered by a lack of centralised command and control, and lack of a detailed \"picture\". De Neumann resigned his command after returning ''Vigilant'' from the Spithead Review and joined the PLA, immediately suggesting, in a report to them submitted in 1953, that a feasibility study of such a system be carried out.  He then oversaw its development and ultimate installation at Gravesend.\n\n[[File:St Andrew's Art Centre & Gallery at Bawley Bay, Gravesend.JPG|thumb|St Andrew's Art Centre & Gallery, sits between Bawley Bay and Anchor Cove, both being the embarkation points for British colonists sailing to New Zealand and Australia, in the early 19th century.]]\nUntil the building of [[Port of Tilbury|Tilbury Docks]], on the opposite side of the river, between 1882 and 1886, Gravesend was the Thames's first port of entry. Thousands of emigrants, as well as large numbers of troops, embarked from here. [[Tilbury Docks]] have expanded considerably since, with the closure of all the [[London Docks]]. The entrance to the Docks is somewhat awkward, situated as it is on the sharp bend of the river, and boats often need [[tugboat]] assistance, as do the larger ships moored at Tilbury landing stages. There have been many tug companies based at Gravesend: among them the ''Sun Company'', the ''Alexandra Towing Company'' and, today, the ''Smith Howard Towing Company''. [[East Indiamen]] traditionally stopped here at a point known as '''Long Reach''' to lighten their loads before sailing up the [[River Thames|Thames]] to moorings at [[Blackwall, London|Blackwall]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=46535|title=The East India Docks: Historical development', Survey of London: volumes 43 and 44: Poplar, Blackwall and Isle of Dogs|year=1994|accessdate=7 November 2007}}</ref>\n\nFor some years after, war steamer excursions were run on the [[MV Royal Daffodil (1939)|MV ''Royal Daffodil'']] down the Thames from Gravesend to France, but they ceased in 1966.  Cruises are now operated by the [[Lower Thames and Medway Passenger Boat Company]] up the river to [[Greenwich]]. The cross-river passenger ferry to [[Tilbury]] provides a long-established route to and from Essex. Before the [[Dartford Crossing]] came into being, there was a vehicle ferry at Gravesend as well.\n\nThere is a [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution|RNLI lifeboat station]], based at '''Royal Terrace Pier''' ,which has become one of the busiest in the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rnli.org/Pages/default.aspx |title=The RNLI is the charity that saves lives at sea |website=Rnli.org |date=29 January 2016 |accessdate=27 February 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225084107/http://rnli.org/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=25 February 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Thames and Medway Canal===\n{{main|Thames and Medway Canal}}\n[[File:GravesendCanalBasin3456.JPG|thumb|Gravesend Canal Basin]]\nThe [[Thames and Medway Canal]] was opened for barge traffic in 1824. It ran from Gravesend on the Thames to [[Frindsbury]] near [[Strood]] on the [[Medway]]. Although seven miles long, it had only two locks, each {{cvt|94|ft}} by {{cvt|22|ft}} in size, one at each end. Its most notable feature was the tunnel near Strood, which was {{cvt|3,946|yds}} long, the second longest canal tunnel ever built in the UK. The great cost of the tunnel meant that the [[canal]] was not a commercial success.\n\nAfter only 20&nbsp;years, most of the canal was closed and the canal's tunnel was converted to railway use. Initially, canal and railway shared the tunnel, with the single track built on timber supports, but by 1847, canal use was abandoned and a double track laid. Today Gravesend Canal Basin is used for the mooring of [[pleasure craft]]. [[Gravesend Sailing Club]], which was founded so that working men could participate in the sport while still having to earn a living is based here. The lock has been dredged, and restoration and strengthening work has been carried out on the basin walls as part of the regeneration of the area.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Roads===\nThe main roads through the town are the west-east [[A226 road]] from [[Dartford]] and beyond to [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]]; and the [[A227 road]] to [[Tonbridge]]. The [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2 road]] passes two miles (3&nbsp;km) south of Gravesend town centre; a mile stretch of it was rerouted in the early 2000s to take the traffic away from the south end of the town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2005/20052933.htm |title=The A2 Trunk Road (Pepperhill to Cobham and Slip Roads) Order 2005 |website=Opsi.gov.uk |date=4 July 2011 |accessdate=27 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2006 the first of the area\u2019s new [[Fastrack (bus)|Fastrack]] bus services, which use a combination of ordinary roads and dedicated 'bus tracks', opened. The service links to [[Ebbsfleet International railway station]], [[Greenhithe]], [[Bluewater (shopping centre)|Bluewater Shopping Centre]] and Dartford.\n\n===Rail===\n{{Main|Gravesend railway station|Gravesend West Line}}\n[[File:Gravesend Railway Station 2.jpg|thumb|left|Gravesend's Victorian railway station modernised for HS1 in 2014]]\n\n[[Gravesend railway station]] lies on the [[North Kent Line]], and was opened in 1849. The [[Gravesend West Line]], terminating by the river and for some time operating as a [[English Channel|continental]] ferry connection, closed in 1968.\n\nGravesend is the primary [[North West Kent|north Kent]] interchange for high speed and metro rail services. In December 2009, the full high-speed timetable between London and Kent came into force and passenger usage from Gravesend has exceeded expectations. High-speed services from [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras]] and [[Stratford International railway station|Stratford International]], are offered via Gravesend to the [[Medway]] towns, [[Sittingbourne]], [[Faversham]], [[Margate]], [[Broadstairs]] and [[Ramsgate]]. Some of these services continue to [[Ashford International railway station|Ashford International]] via [[Sandwich railway station|Sandwich]] and [[Dover Priory railway station|Dover Priory]].\n\nThere are also metro services to [[Charing Cross railway station|London Charing Cross]], [[Waterloo East railway station|London Waterloo East]] and [[London Bridge railway station|London Bridge]] via [[Sidcup railway station|Sidcup]], via [[Woolwich Arsenal railway station|Woolwich Arsenal]] and [[Lewisham railway station|Lewisham]] and [[Bexleyheath railway station|Bexleyheath]], and to [[Gillingham (Kent) railway station|Gillingham]].\n\nUnusually Gravesend features a Platform 0, one of the few in the country, it is used for terminating services from [[Cannon Street railway station|London Cannon Street]] or London Charing Cross via Sidcup.\n\n===Buses===\nGravesend is served by several [[Arriva Kent Thameside]] bus services connecting the town with other areas in [[Kent]] including [[Dartford]], [[Bluewater (shopping centre)|Bluewater]] and [[Sevenoaks]] and to the [[Medway Towns]].<br />\nGravesend is also served by [[Fastrack (bus)|Fastrack]] bus services connecting the town with Bluewater, [[Darent Valley Hospital]] and Dartford.\n\n===Ferry===\n[[File:GravesendThames3401.JPG|thumb|The ferry from Tilbury coming alongside at Gravesend]]\n{{main|Gravesend\u2013Tilbury Ferry }} \nPassenger ferry services to [[Tilbury]], [[Essex]], operate daily (except Sundays), from [[Gravesend town pier|Gravesend Town Pier]].\n\n===Footpaths===\n\nThe [[Saxon Shore Way]], a [[long distance footpath]], starts at Gravesend and traces the coast as in [[Roman Empire|Roman times]] as far as [[Hastings]], [[East Sussex]]; 163 miles (262&nbsp;km) in total. The [[Wealdway]] also starts at the Town Pier, and continues almost due south over the [[Weald]] to [[Eastbourne]] in East Sussex where it links with [[South Downs Way]], a distance of 80&nbsp;miles (128&nbsp;km).\n\n==Religious buildings==\nThe town's principal Anglican place of worship is the Church of St George, Gravesend.  This [[Georgian architecture|Georgian building]] is a tourist attraction because of its association with Princess Pocahontas, as well as being the [[parish church]].  Gravesend has three other [[Church of England]] parishes and [[Roman Catholic]], [[Methodist]], [[United Reformed]] and [[Baptist]] churches as well as other smaller chapels.\n\n[[File:GravesendGurdwara3436.JPG|thumb|[[Guru Nanak Darbar Gurdwara]] at Gravesend in November 2007]]\nGravesend has a significant [[Sikh]] population. Its first [[gurdwara]] was founded in 1956 by [[Bhat Sikhs|Bhat Sikh]] [[Suraj Parkash|Santokh Singh Takk]] (off Pelham Road South) in Edwin Street with a second one opening, ten years later, in a former [[Congregationalist]] church, but this gurdwara closed in 2010.

By 1893, 4,699 such people had benefited by its presence.  In 2004 the original building, and parts of the newer buildings were demolished to make way for a new community hospital. Gravesend Community Hospital provides a Minor Injury Unit, Dental services, Speech and Language therapy and Physiotherapy. It also has a Stroke Ward and offers inpatient care. The outpatient department provides care for much of the local area and is separate from those offered at Darent Valley Hospital. In addition, Gravesend emergency doctors out of hours service as well as podiatry are offered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kentcht.nhs.uk/home/our-services/gravesham-community-hospital/?entryid109=230335 |title=Kent Community Health NHS Foundation Trust - Gravesham Community Hospital |website=Kentcht.nhs.uk |date= |accessdate=27 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the town centre is a large medical clinic at Swan Yard, next to the Market car park, and several other doctors' surgeries are located in the area.\n\n==Sport==\n===Football===\nThe [[Stonebridge Road]] [[association football|football ground]] at neighbouring [[Northfleet]] is home to [[Ebbsfleet United F.C.]], which changed its name from Gravesend and Northfleet F.C. in June 2007.

Gravesend Rugby Football Club (founded in 1921) has been the towns senior club since league rugby was established in the 1980s and currently plays in the [[London 2 South East]] league. The team colours are black and white. \n\nOld Gravesendians RFC (founded in 1929)<ref>J.P Jordan (1949) History of Kent Rugby Football, pages 119-120</ref> consisted traditionally of former Gravesend Grammar School pupils. Prior to the forming of Old Gravesendians RFC, on leaving the Grammar School, former pupils had continued to engage in various sports through the Old Blues Association (founded in 1914).<ref>Gravesend and Dartford Reporter, Saturday 15 January 1921</ref> Owing to [[World War I]] the Old Blues Association practically went to pieces with only one annual dinner having been held in 1914. After the war a reunion dinner was held in 1920, the second annual dinner, which re-started the Old Blues Association activities. The Old Gravesendians RFC was often referred to as 'Gravesend Old Blues' in match reports. Old Gravesendians RFC continued to foster rugby in Gravesend during [[World War II]] by turning out a side every season. Old Gravesendians (Old G's) have had some of their best success in recent seasons reaching six Kent Plate Finals (winning two of these) and achieving promotion to London League rugby in 2009. Unfortunately this proved a step too far with relegation in 2009-10. Old G's put out three sides with the first team playing in [[Shepherd Neame Kent 1]] during the 2018-19 season. The team colours are light blue and dark blue.\n\n===Rowing===\nRowing races have been held on the [[River Thames]] at Gravesend since at least 1698, with the first organised [[Regatta]] recorded in 1715.

In ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'' Mr. Peggotty, Ham and the Micawbers say their goodbyes and sail away from Gravesend to begin a new life in Australia. In ''[[Great Expectations]]'', Pip, with accomplices, rows Magwitch from London downriver in expectation of waylaying a regular steamer (whilst under way in the Lower Hope, off Gravesend) bound for Hamburg. (Gravesend also appears in ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'').\n\nGravesend is briefly mentioned in the 1818 novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' by [[Mary Shelley]] during Victor's travels through the United Kingdom with Clerval; ultimately culminating in Victor's residence in the [[Orkney Islands]].\n\nAlso in the 1902 novel ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' by [[Joseph Conrad]] the narrator has dark aired Gravesend as the perspective from which we continue our gaze of a sky that is mournfully gloomy over London. Waiting for the tide near the shores of Gravesend is the setting from which shipmate Marlow tells his tale.\n\n''[[The War Game]]'' was a 1965 television drama-documentary film depicting a nuclear war. Written, directed, and produced by Peter Watkins for the BBC's The Wednesday Play anthology series, it caused dismay within the BBC and in government, and was withdrawn before the provisional screening date of Thursday 7 October 1965.[1] The corporation said that \"the effect of the film has been judged by the BBC to be too horrifying for the medium of broadcasting. It will, however, be shown to invited audiences...\"[2] Despite this decision, it was publicly screened and shown abroad, winning the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 1966. The film was eventually broadcast on 31 July 1985 on the BBC, during the week before the fortieth anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing, the day before a repeat screening of Threads.[4] The film was shot in the Kent towns of Tonbridge, Gravesend, Chatham and Dover. The cast was almost entirely made up of non-actors, casting having taken place via a series of local public meetings several months earlier.\n\nThe 1952 film \"[[The Long Memory]]\" starring [[John Mills]] was filmed in and around Gravesend. It features many squalid streets running down towards the river that even then were being progressively cleared for redevelopment. It is also possible to hear in the background steam engines working out of the [[Gravesend West Line]] West Street terminus. Except for the skeletal remains of the pier all evidence of this station has now disappeared.\n\n==Notable people==\n[[File:General Charles George Gordon Statue.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of General Gordon at Gravesend]]\n\n* [[Edwin Arnold|Sir Edwin Arnold]] (1832\u20131904), English poet and journalist whose most prominent work as a poet was ''The Light of Asia'' (1879).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.information-britain.co.uk/famousbrits.php?id=1123 |title=Edwin Arnold, famous people from Gravesend |publisher=Information-britain.co.uk |date=12 February 2007 |accessdate=27 February 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Gemma Arterton]] (born 1986), actress, was born at Northfleet and attended [[Gravesend Grammar School for Girls]].\n* [[George Box]] (born 1919), renowned statistician, and a recipient of the [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]].\n* [[Charles Dickens]] is associated with Gravesend and villages around the borough.

I use the word 'persona' carefully, as they taught me how to move with sound, through sound, persona. In our visual-material age, sound is the great undiscovered or forgotten land for actors and audiences. Reason and Emotion are all very well in speech, much needed, but with Peter and Barbara I learnt of the limbs of speech, the feet, the legs, the arms, the great will and beautiful spirit to move with speech. Just as a marvellous javelin thrower wills his spear down the pitch to the winning distance and harnesses every muscle necessary in perfect balance to achieve his aim, so, when appropriate, we speak in space and silence. It was a lucky day for me when I met them; they know some great secrets and forgotten pathways.\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liberationofacting.com/|title=FOREWORD by Mark

I use the word 'persona' carefully, as they taught me how to move with sound, through sound, persona. In our visual-material age, sound is the great undiscovered or forgotten land for actors and audiences. Reason and Emotion are all very well in speech, much needed, but with Peter and Barbara I learnt of the limbs of speech, the feet, the legs, the arms, the great will and beautiful spirit to move with speech. Just as a marvellous javelin thrower wills his spear down the pitch to the winning distance and harnesses every muscle necessary in perfect balance to achieve his aim, so, when appropriate, we speak in space and silence. It was a lucky day for me when I met them; they know some great secrets and forgotten pathways.\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liberationofacting.com/|title=FOREWORD by Mark

[[Saw Gerrera]], having been sent to Geonosis to investigate, deduced the Empire possesses a superweapon and resolved to discover the Death Star as depicted in the final season two-parter \"In the Name of the Rebellion.\" Though it was a dead-end, finding only scientists being abducted by the Empire, Saw learned the weapon is powered by kyber crystals taken from the Jedha system.\n\nThe [[Star Wars#Anthology films|anthology film]] ''[[Rogue One]]'' focuses on a band of Rebels stealing the plans for the first Death Star prior to the events of ''A New Hope''. The Death Star project was overseen by Orson Krennic, the Director of Advanced Weapons Research for the Imperial Military. Under Krennic's supervision, the project was beset by constant delays, and he forcibly recruited weapons designer Galen Erso (the father of Jyn Erso, the movie's main protagonist) to complete the design; nevertheless, it was another fifteen years before the Death Star was operational. The Death Star's primary laser was powered by kyber crystals mined from the desert moon of [[Jedha]], and is first used to destroy Jedha City both as a response to a violent insurgency on the planet, and as a display of the Death Star's operational status to restore the Empire's confidence in the project. Grand Moff Tarkin assumes control over the Death Star while Krennic investigates security breaches in the design project. It is subsequently revealed that Galen discreetly sabotaged the design by building a vulnerability into the reactor. This is the same vulnerability that Luke Skywalker takes advantage of during the events of ''A New Hope''. After the Death Star plans are stolen from the Scarif vault, Tarkin fires the Death Star's superlaser on the base killing Krennic, as well as Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor.<ref name=\"rogue-one-film\" /> ''Rogue One'' also reveals that the Death Star's superlaser is powered by multiple reactors, allowing it to vary its destructive power depending on the target. Skeptical of the station's power, Tarkin ordered that it first be tested on Jedha City using a single reactor. Near the end of ''Rogue One'', a second single-reactor test would destroy their installation on Scarif, along with the Rebel strike force who had successfully stolen the station's plans. This is consistent with the canon continuity in ''Star Wars'', since the destruction of the planet Alderaan would be the first time the Death Star fired the superlaser with ''all'' reactors employed so Tarkin could declare the battlestation \"fully operational\".\n\nThe canonical population of the first Death Star was 1.7 million military personnel, 400,000 maintenance droids, and 250,000 civilians/ associated contractors.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Complete Locations\"/><ref name=\"Star Wars: Death Star Battles\"/>\nThe first Death Star was defended by thousands of turbolasers, ion cannons and laser cannons, plus a complement of seven to nine thousand TIE fighters, along with tens of thousands of support craft. It also had several massive docking bays, including dry docks capable of accommodating Star Destroyers.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe 2014 book ''[[Star Wars: Tarkin]]'' detailed the life of Grand Moff Tarkin, and prominently featured the first Death Star. The theme of the construction of the Death Star is continued in the 2016 book, ''[[Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel]]'', which tells the story of the development of the Death Star's superweapon by the scientist, Galen Erso and Krennic's deception of him.  It also reveals how Poggle worked with Krennic on the Project but then turned on him.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rogue One Prequel Book Reveals Secret Origins of the Death Star|url=http://movieweb.com/star-wars-rogue-one-prequel-novel-death-star-origins/|accessdate=21 September 2016|agency=MovieWeb.com|date=1 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Second Death Star===\n[[File:DeathStar2.jpg|thumb|alt=The second Death Star|The second Death Star]]\n\n''Return of the Jedi'' features a second Death Star still under construction as it orbits the forest moon of the planet [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]]. Besides being even more massive it also fixed the flaws found in its predecessor, so the Rebel Alliance's only hope is to destroy it prior to its completion. [[Emperor Palpatine]] and Darth Vader send the Rebels false information that the station's weapons systems are not yet operational in order to lure the Alliance fleet into a trap, resulting in the decisive Battle of Endor. Compared to its predecessor, the second Death Star's superlaser is more advanced as it can be fired every few minutes instead of needing 24 hours to recharge, while improved targeting computers could track smaller targets such as capital ships.

It was constructed by Bevel Lemelisk and his engineers at the Empire's secret Maw Installation. The prototype measured 120 kilometers in diameter. Its superlaser was only powerful enough to destroy a planet's core, rendering it an uninhabitable \"dead planet\". The targeting system on the prototype was never calibrated and the superlaser was inefficient, leaving the weapon's batteries drained. The prototype had no interior except a slave-linked control room, hyperdrive engines and other components; the station operated with skeleton-crew of 75 personnel.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nAlthough ''Star Wars'' creator [[George Lucas]] confirmed that the plans featured in ''Attack of the Clones'' and the under-construction facility in ''Revenge of the Sith'' was the original Death Star,{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} ''Star Wars: The New Essential Chronology'' [[retcon]]ned the DS-X prototype into being separate from the main Death Star.\n\n====Death Star III====\nIn the Disney attraction ''[[Star Tours - The Adventures Continue]]'', guests can travel inside an incomplete Death Star during one of the randomized ride sequences. In the original Star Tours, a '''''Death Star III''''' is seen and destroyed during the ride sequence by the New Republic. [[Leland Chee]] originally created the third Death Star to explain why a Death Star is present on the ''[[Star Tours]]'' ride when both of the stations in the movies were destroyed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/convenient-daily-departures-the-history-of-star-tours|title=Convenient Daily Departures: The History of Star Tours - StarWars.com|date=22 August 2013|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2016}}</ref> The station being built near the Forest Moon of Endor like the second Death Star before. It is similar to an original concept for ''Return of the Jedi'', where two Death Stars would have been built near Had Abbadon (then the Imperial capital world). The ''Habitation'' spheres, based on the Imperials' suspicious claims that they were designed strictly for peaceful purposes, were suggested by some fans to have been the origin for the Death Star III. This was later revealed to be the case in Part 2 of the StarWars.com Blog series ''The Imperial Warlords: Despoilers of an Empire''. In the ''Legends'' game ''[[Star Wars: Tiny Death Star]]'', a random HoloNet entry states that one of the residents of the Death Star is simply staying there until he can afford to stay at the third Death Star.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n====Other superweapons====\nA prototype version of the Death Star can be found in Kevin J. Anderson's novel ''[[Jedi Search]]'' (1994).<ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Kevin J.|title=Jedi Search|year=1994|isbn=0-553-29798-8|page=271|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSbTCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA271}}</ref> It was kept at the Maw Installation, an Imperial research institute in a cluster of black holes, and later deployed by Tol Sivron after the Maw Installation was invaded by the New Republic. The prototype was ineffective, missing its target and instead destroying an Imperial garrison moon the sole time it was fired in combat. After this, the prototype was later destroyed when it was led into the black holes of the cluster.\n\nIn the original Marvel [[Star Wars (1977 comic book)|''Star Wars'' comic series]], a superweapon called \"The Tarkin\" is built. It is described as being similar to the Death Star but with more energy. Darth Vader commands it and Luke, Leia, Chewbacca, {{nowrap|C-3PO}}, and R2-D2 sabotage it with Lando's help. It is finally destroyed by an Imperial officer attempting to use an ionic weapon to both attack the escaping Rebels and assassinate Vader.\n\nIn the ''[[Dark Empire]]'' comic series (1991\u201395), the reborn Emperor Palpatine's flagships ''Eclipse'' and ''Eclipse II'' Super Star Destroyers (Star Dreadnoughts) have a miniaturized version of the Death Star superlaser.<ref>https://www.theforce.net/jedicouncil/interview/saxton.asp</ref> The first ''Eclipse'' was under construction at the time of the Emperor's death at Endor; shortly thereafter, it was briefly captured by pirates, who quickly abandoned it as an obvious target for the Rebels. The vessel was retrieved by remnants of the Empire and completed, and later served as the flagship of the resurrected Palpatine. It was destroyed by a Force storm enhanced by Luke and Leia, who had been brought aboard by the Emperor in hopes that they could be converted to the dark side. The ''Eclipse II'' was mostly identical to its predecessor save for a handful of visual changes, and fulfilled the same purpose. It was later destroyed when an errant projectile from the destroyed Galaxy Gun, another superweapon developed under the returned Palpatine, fell onto the ship and caused a massive explosion that destroyed not only the ship and its accompanying fleet, but also the nearby Imperial citadel of [[Byss]].\n\nIn Kevin J. Anderson's novel ''[[Darksaber (novel)|Darksaber]]'' (1995), Death Star designer Bevel Lemelisk is recruited by the Hutts to build a superlaser weapon. Due to their refusal to sufficiently fund and supply the project, the resultant 'superweapon' is quickly destroyed by a combination of the tumultuous Hoth asteroid field in which it was built and the efforts of the New Republic. Lemelisk is captured and incarcerated by the Republic, and is later executed for his hand in the design and construction of Imperial superweapons.\n\nThe novel ''[[Children of the Jedi]]'' (1995) involves the return of ''Eye of Palpatine'', a \"colossal, asteroid-shaped\" super dreadnaught constructed at the behest of Emperor Palpatine during the second year of the Galactic Civil War.

Later, [[Luke Skywalker]], [[Han Solo]], [[Chewbacca]], [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], [[C-3PO]], and [[R2-D2]] are pulled aboard the station by a [[tractor beam]], where they discover and manage to rescue Princess Leia. As they make their escape, Obi-Wan dies duelling [[Darth Vader]], enabling the others to flee the station. Later, Luke returns as part of a fighter force to attack its only weak point: a ray-shielded particle exhaust vent leading straight from the surface directly into its reactor core. Luke is able to successfully launch his [[X-wing fighter]]'s torpedoes into the vent, impacting the core and triggering a catastrophic explosion, which destroys the station before it can use its superlaser weapon to annihilate the Rebel base on Yavin 4.<ref name=\"star wars 4\">{{cite AV media|people=Lucas, George (Director)|title=[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope]]|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|date=May 25, 1977|medium=DVD|edition=2004}}</ref>\n\nThe first Death Star's schematics are visible in the scenes on [[Geonosis]] in ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]'' showcasing the early development of the Death Star prototype.

[[Saw Gerrera]], having been sent to Geonosis to investigate, deduced the Empire possesses a superweapon and resolved to discover the Death Star as depicted in the final season two-parter \"In the Name of the Rebellion.\" Though it was a dead-end, finding only scientists being abducted by the Empire, Saw learned the weapon is powered by kyber crystals taken from the Jedha system.\n\nThe [[Star Wars#Anthology films|anthology film]] ''[[Rogue One]]'' focuses on a band of Rebels stealing the plans for the first Death Star prior to the events of ''A New Hope''. The Death Star project was overseen by Orson Krennic, the Director of Advanced Weapons Research for the Imperial Military. Under Krennic's supervision, the project was beset by constant delays, and he forcibly recruited weapons designer Galen Erso (the father of Jyn Erso, the movie's main protagonist) to complete the design; nevertheless, it was another fifteen years before the Death Star was operational. The Death Star's primary laser was powered by kyber crystals mined from the desert moon of [[Jedha]], and is first used to destroy Jedha City both as a response to a violent insurgency on the planet, and as a display of the Death Star's operational status to restore the Empire's confidence in the project. Grand Moff Tarkin assumes control over the Death Star while Krennic investigates security breaches in the design project. It is subsequently revealed that Galen discreetly sabotaged the design by building a vulnerability into the reactor. This is the same vulnerability that Luke Skywalker takes advantage of during the events of ''A New Hope''. After the Death Star plans are stolen from the Scarif vault, Tarkin fires the Death Star's superlaser on the base killing Krennic, as well as Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor.<ref name=\"rogue-one-film\" /> ''Rogue One'' also reveals that the Death Star's superlaser is powered by multiple reactors, allowing it to vary its destructive power depending on the target. Skeptical of the station's power, Tarkin ordered that it first be tested on Jedha City using a single reactor. Near the end of ''Rogue One'', a second single-reactor test would destroy their installation on Scarif, along with the Rebel strike force who had successfully stolen the station's plans. This is consistent with the canon continuity in ''Star Wars'', since the destruction of the planet Alderaan would be the first time the Death Star fired the superlaser with ''all'' reactors employed so Tarkin could declare the battlestation \"fully operational\".\n\nThe canonical population of the first Death Star was 1.7 million military personnel, 400,000 maintenance droids, and 250,000 civilians/ associated contractors.<ref name=\"Star Wars: Complete Locations\"/><ref name=\"Star Wars: Death Star Battles\"/>\nThe first Death Star was defended by thousands of turbolasers, ion cannons and laser cannons, plus a complement of seven to nine thousand TIE fighters, along with tens of thousands of support craft. It also had several massive docking bays, including dry docks capable of accommodating Star Destroyers.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe 2014 book ''[[Star Wars: Tarkin]]'' detailed the life of Grand Moff Tarkin, and prominently featured the first Death Star. The theme of the construction of the Death Star is continued in the 2016 book, ''[[Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel]]'', which tells the story of the development of the Death Star's superweapon by the scientist, Galen Erso and Krennic's deception of him.

Compared to its predecessor, the second Death Star's superlaser is more advanced as it can be fired every few minutes instead of needing 24 hours to recharge, while improved targeting computers could track smaller targets such as capital ships. The unfinished battle station had been protected by a planetary shield projector deployed on the forest moon of Endor, but this was taken out by a ground assault team led by Han Solo with the help of the native [[Ewok]]s.

The vessel was retrieved by remnants of the Empire and completed, and later served as the flagship of the resurrected Palpatine. It was destroyed by a Force storm enhanced by Luke and Leia, who had been brought aboard by the Emperor in hopes that they could be converted to the dark side. The ''Eclipse II'' was mostly identical to its predecessor save for a handful of visual changes, and fulfilled the same purpose. It was later destroyed when an errant projectile from the destroyed Galaxy Gun, another superweapon developed under the returned Palpatine, fell onto the ship and caused a massive explosion that destroyed not only the ship and its accompanying fleet, but also the nearby Imperial citadel of [[Byss]].\n\nIn Kevin J. Anderson's novel ''[[Darksaber (novel)|Darksaber]]'' (1995), Death Star designer Bevel Lemelisk is recruited by the Hutts to build a superlaser weapon.

It is one of Norway's five traditional bishoprics and was founded around the year 1070.\n\n==History==\nOslo was established as a diocese in 1068. It was originally a [[suffragan]] of the archdiocese of [[Hamburg-Bremen]], from 1104 on of that of [[Diocese of Lund|Lund]] and starting from 1152 on of [[Archdiocese of Nidaros|Nidaros]]. It then covered the (modern) counties of [[Oslo]], [[Akershus]], [[Buskerud]] (except [[Hallingdal]]), [[Hedmark]] (except the northern part of [[\u00d8sterdalen]]), [[Oppland]] (except [[Valdres]]), [[Telemark]], [[Vestfold]] and [[\u00d8stfold]], and the province of [[Bohusl\u00e4n]], and the parishes of [[Idre]] and [[S\u00e4rna]].\n\nThe [[Ancient Diocese of Hamar|Diocese of Hamar]] was established and separated from Oslo in 1152, but it was again merged with Oslo in 1541 (together with the northern part of \u00d8sterdalen from [[Diocese of Nidaros]]). The regions of Hallingdal and Valdres were transferred from [[Diocese of Stavanger]] to Oslo in 1631. (But Oslo had to give the upper part of Telemark to Stavanger in return.) The parishes of Idre and S\u00e4rna were lost to Sweden in 1644, and the province of Bohusl\u00e4n was lost in 1658. Hamar (with Hedmark and Oppland) was again separated from Oslo in 1864. The rest of Telemark was transferred to ''Diocese of Kristiansand'' (see [[Diocese of Agder og Telemark]]) the same year. The [[Diocese of Tunsberg]] (with Vestfold and Buskerud) was established and separated from Oslo in 1948. The [[Diocese of Borg]] (with Akershus and \u00d8stfold) was established and separated from Oslo in 1969.\n\nToday the Diocese of Oslo only covers the county of Oslo and the municipalities of [[Asker]] and [[B\u00e6rum]] in Akershus.\n\n==Bishops since the Reformation==\n*1541\u20131545 [[Hans Rev]]\n*1545\u20131548 [[Anders Madss\u00f8n]]\n*1548\u20131580 [[Frants Berg]]\n*1580\u20131600

It is one of Norway's five traditional bishoprics and was founded around the year 1070.\n\n==History==\nOslo was established as a diocese in 1068. It was originally a [[suffragan]] of the archdiocese of [[Hamburg-Bremen]], from 1104 on of that of [[Diocese of Lund|Lund]] and starting from 1152 on of [[Archdiocese of Nidaros|Nidaros]]. It then covered the (modern) counties of [[Oslo]], [[Akershus]], [[Buskerud]] (except [[Hallingdal]]), [[Hedmark]] (except the northern part of [[\u00d8sterdalen]]), [[Oppland]] (except [[Valdres]]), [[Telemark]], [[Vestfold]] and [[\u00d8stfold]], and the province of [[Bohusl\u00e4n]], and the parishes of [[Idre]] and [[S\u00e4rna]].\n\nThe [[Ancient Diocese of Hamar|Diocese of Hamar]] was established and separated from Oslo in 1152, but it was again merged with Oslo in 1541 (together with the northern part of \u00d8sterdalen from [[Diocese of Nidaros]]). The regions of Hallingdal and Valdres were transferred from [[Diocese of Stavanger]] to Oslo in 1631. (But Oslo had to give the upper part of Telemark to Stavanger in return.) The parishes of Idre and S\u00e4rna were lost to Sweden in 1644, and the province of Bohusl\u00e4n was lost in 1658. Hamar (with Hedmark and Oppland) was again separated from Oslo in 1864. The rest of Telemark was transferred to ''Diocese of Kristiansand'' (see [[Diocese of Agder og Telemark]]) the same year. The [[Diocese of Tunsberg]] (with Vestfold and Buskerud) was established and separated from Oslo in 1948. The [[Diocese of Borg]] (with Akershus and \u00d8stfold) was established and separated from Oslo in 1969.\n\nToday the Diocese of Oslo only covers the county of Oslo and the municipalities of [[Asker]] and [[B\u00e6rum]] in Akershus.\n\n==Bishops since the Reformation==\n*1541\u20131545 [[Hans Rev]]\n*1545\u20131548 [[Anders Madss\u00f8n]]\n*1548\u20131580 [[Frants Berg]]\n*1580\u20131600 [[Jens Nilss\u00f8n]]\n*1601\u20131607 [[Anders Bendss\u00f8n Dall]]\n*1607\u20131617 [[Niels Clauss\u00f8n Senning]]\n*1617\u20131639 [[Niels Simonsen Glostrup]]\n*1639\u20131646 [[Oluf Boesen]]\n*1646\u20131664 [[Henning Stockfleth]]\n*1664\u20131699 [[Hans Rosing]]\n*1699\u20131712 [[Hans Munch (bishop)|Hans Munch]]\n*1713\u20131730 [[Bartholom\u00e6us Deichman]]\n*1731\u20131737 [[Peder Hersleb]]\n*1738\u20131758 [[Niels Dorph]]\n*1758\u20131773 [[Fredrik Nannestad]]\n*1773\u20131804 [[Christian Schmidt (bishop)|Christian Schmidt]]\n*1805\u20131822 [[Fredrik Julius Bech]]\n*1823\u20131845 [[Christian S\u00f8renssen]]\n*1846\u20131874 [[Jens Lauritz Arup]]\n*1875\u20131893 [[Carl Peter Parelius Essendrop]]\n*1893\u20131896 [[Fredrik Wilhelm Klumpp Bugge]]\n*1896\u20131912 [[Anton Christian Bang]]\n*1912\u20131922 [[Jens Fr\u00f8lich Tandberg]]\n*1922\u20131937 [[Johan Lunde]]\n*1937\u20131951 [[Eivind Berggrav|Eivind Josef Berggrav]]\n*1951\u20131968 [[Johannes Smemo]]\n*1968\u20131973 [[Fridtjov S\u00f8iland Birkeli]]\n*1973\u20131977 [[Kaare St\u00f8ylen]]\n*1977\u20131998 [[Andreas Aarflot]]\n*1998\u20132005 [[Gunnar St\u00e5lsett]]\n*2005\u20132017 [[Ole Christian Kvarme]]\n*2017-present [[Kari Veiteberg]]\n\n== Deaneries ==\n* [[Oslo arch-deanery]]\n* [[:no:Asker prosti|Asker deanery]]\n* [[B\u00e6rum deanery]]\n* [[Nordre Aker deanery]]\n* [[S\u00f8ndre Aker deanery]]\n* [[Vestre Aker deanery]]\n* [[\u00d8stre Aker-Groruddalen deanery]]\n* '''Nationwide deaneries''':\n**The deaf chaplain deanery\n**The military chaplain corps\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.kirken.no/oslo/ Official website]\n*{{CathEncy|wstitle=Ancient See of Oslo}}\n\n{{Bishops of Norway}}\n{{Churches in Oslo arch-deanery}}\n{{Churches in Nordre Aker deanery}}\n{{Churches in S\u00f8ndre Aker deanery}}\n{{Churches in Vestre Aker deanery}}\n{{Churches in \u00d8stre Aker-Groruddalen deanery}}\n\n{{coord missing|Sweden}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Diocese Of Oslo}}\n[[Category:Religion in Oslo]]\n[[Category:Church of Norway dioceses|Oslo]]\n[[Category:1068 establishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:11th-century establishments in Norway]]  \n[[Category:Former Catholic dioceses in Sweden|Oslo]]\n[[Category:Organisations based in Oslo]]\n", "name_user": "Redriv", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDeaneries:added link to the deaf church deanery", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Oslo"}

The arm had a tattoo of a rose with the words \"useless generation\" in capitals underneath, which was changed to \"generation terrorists\". This was not without problems, as the original pressing had made Edwards' flesh to be bright pink as opposed to the intended mustard. The back cover featured a design similar to their earlier [[New Art Riot|''New Art Riot'' EP]] cover, an [[European Community|EC]] Flag, though this time it was crumpled and in flames. The [[working title]] of the album was ''Culture, Alienation, Boredom & Despair'' (a lyric from the song \"Little Baby Nothing\").\n\n== Release ==\n\n''Generation Terrorists'' was released on 10 February 1992.{{sfn|Price|1999|p=74}} The album entered the [[UK Rock Chart]] at No. 1,{{sfn|Price|1999|p=79}} selling around 250,000 copies worldwide initially.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://archive.classicrockmagazine.com/view/october-2010/59/generation-terrorists |title=''Generation Terrorists'' |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |accessdate=6 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130215180344/http://archive.classicrockmagazine.com/view/october-2010/59/generation-terrorists |archivedate=15 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> These sales coincided with the 1992 [[BRIT Awards]], whose winners relegated ''Generation Terrorists'' to a peak of No. 13 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].{{sfn|Price|1999|p=79}} Early pressings of the album contain a sample from ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' at the start of \"Little Baby Nothing\". It was removed from later pressings and does not appear on the legacy 20th anniversary edition of the album. The success of 1996's ''[[Everything Must Go (Manic Street Preachers album)|Everything Must Go]]'' at the 1997 [[BRIT Awards]] ensured that sales of ''Generation Terrorists'' and subsequent albums ''[[Gold Against the Soul]]'' and ''[[The Holy Bible (album)|The Holy Bible]]'' enjoyed a late surge; the band's debut sold an extra 110,000 copies.{{sfn|Price|1999|p=235}}\n\nIn the US, the track listing was changed, and some of the more political tracks were dropped. \"Democracy Coma\" was added to make up for this; it was later released as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] to \"[[Love's Sweet Exile/Repeat|Love's Sweet Exile]]\"/\"[[Love's Sweet Exile/Repeat|Repeat]]\", and also appeared on ''[[Lipstick Traces (A Secret History of Manic Street Preachers)]]''. In addition, four tracks on the US release (\"Slash 'n' Burn\", \"Nat West\u2013Barclays\u2013Midlands\u2013Lloyds\", \"Little Baby Nothing\" and \"You Love Us\") were remixed by [[Michael Brauer]]. These same four tracks also featured live drumming from American drummer Zachary Alford. These tracks were later included on the ''Stars and Stripes'' EP in Japan.<ref name=\"Burrows\"/>\n\nThe album failed to chart in the United States, shifting only 35,000 units. Music journalist [[Simon Price]] suggested that this was because of the arrival of bands such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Pearl Jam]] and [[Soundgarden]] as the \"new rock-megastar elite\".{{sfn|Price|1999|p=92}}\n\nOn 5 November 2012, ''Generation Terrorists'' was re-released for its 20th anniversary.

The arm had a tattoo of a rose with the words \"useless generation\" in capitals underneath, which was changed to \"generation terrorists\". This was not without problems, as the original pressing had made Edwards' flesh to be bright pink as opposed to the intended mustard. The back cover featured a design similar to their earlier [[New Art Riot|''New Art Riot'' EP]] cover, an [[European Community|EC]] Flag, though this time it was crumpled and in flames. The [[working title]] of the album was ''Culture, Alienation, Boredom & Despair'' (a lyric from the song \"Little Baby Nothing\").\n\n== Release ==\n\n''Generation Terrorists'' was released on 10 February 1992.{{sfn|Price|1999|p=74}} The album entered the [[UK Rock Chart]] at No. 1,{{sfn|Price|1999|p=79}} selling around 250,000 copies worldwide initially.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://archive.classicrockmagazine.com/view/october-2010/59/generation-terrorists |title=''Generation Terrorists'' |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |accessdate=6 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130215180344/http://archive.classicrockmagazine.com/view/october-2010/59/generation-terrorists |archivedate=15 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> These sales coincided with the 1992 [[BRIT Awards]], whose winners relegated ''Generation Terrorists'' to a peak of No. 13 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].{{sfn|Price|1999|p=79}} Early pressings of the album contain a sample from ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' at the start of \"Little Baby Nothing\". It was removed from later pressings and does not appear on the legacy 20th anniversary edition of the album. The success of 1996's ''[[Everything Must Go (Manic Street Preachers album)|Everything Must Go]]'' at the 1997 [[BRIT Awards]] ensured that sales of ''Generation Terrorists'' and subsequent albums ''[[Gold Against the Soul]]'' and ''[[The Holy Bible (album)|The Holy Bible]]'' enjoyed a late surge; the band's debut sold an extra 110,000 copies.{{sfn|Price|1999|p=235}}\n\nIn the US, the track listing was changed, and some of the more political tracks were dropped. \"Democracy Coma\" was added to make up for this; it was later released as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] to \"[[Love's Sweet Exile/Repeat|Love's Sweet Exile]]\"/\"[[Love's Sweet Exile/Repeat|Repeat]]\", and also appeared on ''[[Lipstick Traces (A Secret History of Manic Street Preachers)]]''. In addition, four tracks on the US release (\"Slash 'n' Burn\", \"Nat West\u2013Barclays\u2013Midlands\u2013Lloyds\", \"Little Baby Nothing\" and \"You Love Us\") were remixed by [[Michael Brauer]]. These same four tracks also featured live drumming from American drummer Zachary Alford. These tracks were later included on the ''Stars and Stripes'' EP in Japan.<ref name=\"Burrows\"/>\n\nThe album failed to chart in the United States, shifting only 35,000 units. Music journalist [[Simon Price]] suggested that this was because of the arrival of bands such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Pearl Jam]] and [[Soundgarden]] as the \"new rock-megastar elite\".{{sfn|Price|1999|p=92}}\n\nOn 5 November 2012, ''Generation Terrorists'' was re-released for its 20th anniversary. There are five editions of the re-release: the original album; a two-disc Deluxe Edition with a bonus disc of demos and a DVD of the documentary film ''Culture, Alienation, Boredom, Despair'', about the making of the album \u2013 when purchased from the [[Rough Trade (shops)|Rough Trade]] record store in London it also included a free ticket to a showing of the documentary film, followed by an acoustic gig with James Dean Bradfield on 6 November;

When postcodes were introduced, these were mapped into the new ''G'' postcode: C1 became G1, W1 became G11, N1 became G21, E1 became G31, S1 became G41, SW1 became G51, and so on. As NW and SE had never been subdivided they became G20 and G40 respectively.\n\n===Norwich and Croydon===\nNorwich and Croydon were used for a postcode experiment in the late 1960s, which was replaced by the current system. The format was of the form NOR or CRO followed by two numbers and a letter, e.g. NOR 07A.\n\n==Non-geographic postcodes==\n{{further|Postcodes in the United Kingdom#Non-geographic codes}}\n\nNote that a number of non-geographic postcode sectors are also contained within geographic postcode areas.\n\n===GIR===\nGIR 0AA is a postcode created for [[Girobank]] in [[Bootle]]. It remained in use by its successors when Girobank was taken over by [[Alliance & Leicester]] and subsequently by [[Santander UK]].\n\n===BF===\nThe BF postcode area was introduced in 2012 to provide optional postcodes for [[British Forces Post Office]] addresses, for consistency with the layout of other UK addresses. It uses the national non-geographic [[post town]] \"[[BFPO]]\" and, as of 2012, the postcode district \"BF1\".\n\n===BX===\nThe non-geographic postcode area BX has been introduced for addresses which do not include a locality: this allows large organisations long-term flexibility as to where they receive their mail.  This postcode area is used by [[Lloyds Banking Group]] (BX1 1LT) and parts of the [[HM Revenue and Customs]] like VAT Central Unit (BX5 5AT) and Pay as You Earn (BX9 1AS).  Lloyds Bank also use BX4.  After splitting from Lloyds, [[TSB Bank (United Kingdom)|TSB Bank]] uses BX4 7SB, the latter part of which, when written, looks similar to \"TSB\".\n\n===XX===\nThe non-geographic postcode area XX is used by online retailers for returns by Royal Mail.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

When postcodes were introduced, these were mapped into the new ''G'' postcode: C1 became G1, W1 became G11, N1 became G21, E1 became G31, S1 became G41, SW1 became G51, and so on.

It uses the national non-geographic [[post town]] \"[[BFPO]]\" and, as of 2012, the postcode district \"BF1\".\n\n===BX===\nThe non-geographic postcode area BX has been introduced for addresses which do not include a locality: this allows large organisations long-term flexibility as to where they receive their mail.  This postcode area is used by [[Lloyds Banking Group]] (BX1 1LT) and parts of the [[HM Revenue and Customs]] like VAT Central Unit (BX5 5AT) and Pay as You Earn (BX9 1AS).  Lloyds Bank also use BX4.

The final product of the [[videographer]]'s documentation is commonly called a '''wedding video'''. It is also referred to as a '''wedding movie,''' or a '''wedding film'''.\n\n[[File:WeddingVideographer Wikipedia.jpg|thumb|A videographer recording a wedding]]\n\nWedding [[videography]] can trace its roots back to before the invention of the modern [[video camera]] through 8mm and 16mm films. When film was the only way to capture moving pictures, a few enterprising individuals would take the family 8mm camera and film the weddings of friends and family. These film cameras had a major limitation in the form of 4-minute load times. After exposing 4 minutes of film, the operator would have to load a new film cartridge. The high cost of processing and the fact the majority of them could not record sound to the film further limited the industry. However, there were still a few individuals who were able to turn the documentation of weddings into a business.\n\nIn 1967 Sony introduced the first Portapak, the Sony DV-2400 Video Rover. With the introduction of these first camcorders, wedding video documentation evolved from something only for the rich into something for the masses. Early adopters were primarily hobbyists who at first started recording the weddings of friends and family, then went on to do jobs for pay.\n\nThe early days of professional wedding videography were marked by primitive technology and technique, with the equipment generally producing low image quality. Cameras required bright lights, had fuzzy pictures, poor color saturation, and single-channel, poor quality audio. The cameras were bulky, with a separate unit that connected to the video recorder via a cable, severely limiting the videographer's movement.  In post-production, many wedding videos were not edited.  [[Generation loss]] was also a limiting factor because of the nature of analog video tape.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, the state of the industry began to improve. Videographers began to form regional and national organizations, the largest, currently active organization being the Wedding and Event Videographers Association International (WEVA). Manufacturers created a market between the [[professional video camera]] and [[video camera]] consumer levels, known as the [[prosumer]], which met the needs of this niche market. \nTowards the mid-1990s, the manufacturers introduced digital cameras, removing the last of the technological barriers that had impeded wedding videography since it was established. The cameras were small, mobile, worked even better than the already good analog cameras on the market in low light situations, and allowed the videographer to be discreet and not an intrusion to the events.\n[[File:A Kent Wedding Videographer Filming In Canterbury Cathedral Crypt .jpg|alt=A smaller DLSR camera with a rig shooting a church wedding|thumb|A wedding videographer shooting on smaller DSLR equipment.]]\n[[Post-production]] creativity took a major leap forward with the introduction of advanced tools like the Newtek [[Video Toaster]] in the early 1990s. This led to the introduction of other relatively inexpensive [[non-linear editing system]]s (NLE), which offered the editor many more creative options. But the delivery method still relied on an analog viewing system, [[VHS]] [[video tape]]. This changed in the late 1990s with introduction of the [[recordable DVD]]. Weddings and events were now recorded digitally, edited digitally, and delivered digitally, greatly improving the [[image quality]].\n\nBy the late 1990s, wedding videography had expanded beyond documentation of weddings. The majority of wedding videographers preferred to add the additional term of \"event\" to their description of service.  New offerings, such as Love Stories, Photo Montages (a retrospective collection of photographs set to music), music videos, family biographies, anniversaries, Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, graduations, and many other one-time events were also being documented in large numbers on video. The general skill level of the industry's members improved and post-production capabilities reflected the standards of commercial productions.  \n\n==Typical styles==\nCommon styles range from \"journalistic\" to \"cinematic\".\n\n;Video Journalistic style (also referred to as documentary style): Typically described as a [[documentary film]] of the event.
