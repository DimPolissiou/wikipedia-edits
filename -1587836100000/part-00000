It was developed by Pete James and Anthony Taglione for the then UK-based [[Mindscape (software publisher)|Mindscape]], and published by [[The Software Toolworks]]. In the game, the player controls four adventurers on a quest to save the land of Trazere from an ancient, re-awakening evil. In 1993, Mindscape released a sequel, ''Worlds of Legend: Son of the Empire''.\n\n== Release ==\n''The Four Crystals of Trazere'' is an American version of ''Legend''. It was commenced under funding from Mirrorsoft, which went into receivership after the death of Robert Maxwell. The following day, December 11, Taglione was meeting with Phil Harrison of Mindscape to discuss the conversion to PC of Tony Crowther's Amiga game, ''Captive''. On hearing that Mirrorsoft had just gone into receivership, Taglione suggested the possibility of publication by Mindscape.

The demo's content is not taken from the storyline or any part of the full game, but comprises a small but challenging standalone adventure in the world of Trazere.\n\nThe gameplay of the demo is limited to the city of Treihadwyl, and a single dungeon within - the overrun cellars of the Mad Monks' temple - as there is no world map view and therefore no way to travel to any other location. However, the adventure has not been subsequently re-released or incorporated into any retail version of the game, and as such its availability is incredibly limited.\n\nThe demo's difficulty is high in comparison to the beginning stages of the full game, due to the presence of far more intricate puzzle rooms, stronger monster spawns, and more frequent wandering monster ambushes. However, these challenges are offset slightly in that the runemaster begins the demo with an array of powerful spells ready-made, invaluable protective and healing items are scattered around the first dungeon room, and mid to high-level weapons and armour are always available for purchase from the city blacksmith.\n\nThe following year, Taglione coded another similarly unique demo for PC Home, this time for ''Legend'''s sequel, ''Worlds of Legend: Son of the Empire''.\n\n=== Sequel ===\nThe game spawned a sequel a year later called ''Worlds of Legend: Son of the Empire''.<ref>http://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/worlds-of-legend-son-of-the-empire</ref> Although set in a different realm of Trazere, the gameplay is almost identical with a few tweaks and bugfixes.\n\n==Development==\n''Legend'' began development in August 1990, and was originally scheduled for a September 1991 release for [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], and [[DOS]].<ref name=prerelease /> In an April 1991 issue of British gaming magazine ''[[The One (magazine)|The One]]'', ''The One'' interviewed Anthony Taglione, ''Legend's'' programmer, for information regarding its development in a pre-release interview.<ref name=prerelease /> This interview was conducted when ''Legend'' was to be published by Mirrorsoft,<ref name=prerelease /> and prior to [[Robert Maxwell]]'s death and subsequent [[bankruptcy]] of Mirrorsoft; this possibly contributed to ''Legend's'' delayed release.
