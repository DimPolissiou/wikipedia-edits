[[Cadmium]] poisoning from industrial waste in [[Toyama Prefecture]] was discovered to be the cause of the extremely painful {{Nihongo|''[[itai-itai disease]]''|\u30a4\u30bf\u30a4\u30a4\u30bf\u30a4\u75c5|Itai itai by\u014d|\"ouch ouch sickness\"}}. People in Minamata City in [[Kumamoto Prefecture]] were poisoned by [[methylmercury]] drained from the [[chemical factory]], known as the ''[[Minamata disease]]''. The number of casualties in Minamata is 6,500 as of November 2006.\n\nIn [[Yokkaichi]], a port in [[Mie Prefecture]], air pollution caused by [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[nitrogen dioxide]] emissions led to a rapid increase in the number of people suffering from [[asthma]] and [[bronchitis]]. In urban areas [[photochemical smog]] from automotive and industrial exhaust fumes also contributed to a rise in respiratory problems. In the early 1970s, chronic [[arsenic]] poisoning attributed to dust from arsenic mines occurred in [[Shimane Prefecture|Shimane]] and [[Miyazaki Prefecture]]s.\n\n[[Consumers Union of Japan]] was founded in 1969 to deal with health problems and false claims by companies, as Japan's rampant industrial development was seen as causing problems for consumers and citizens. In the 1970s, the Consumers Union of Japan led the opposition to nuclear power, calling for a nationwide Anti-Nuclear Power Week Campaign.\n\nIn the 1990s, Japan's environmental legislation was further tightened. In 1993 the government reorganized the environment law system and legislated the ''Basic Environment Law'' ({{lang|ja|\u74b0\u5883\u57fa\u672c\u6cd5}}) and related laws. The law includes restriction of industrial emissions, restriction of products, restriction of wastes, improvement of energy conservation, promotion of recycling, restriction of land utilization, the arrangement of environmental pollution control programs, relief of victims and provision for sanctions. The Environment Agency was promoted to full-fledged [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] in 2001, to deal with the deteriorating international environmental problems.\n\nIn 1984 the Environmental Agency had issued its first [[white paper]]. In the 1989 study, citizens thought environmental problems had improved compared with the past, nearly 1.7% thought things had improved, 31% thought that they had stayed the same, and nearly 21% thought that they had worsened. Some 75% of those surveyed expressed concern about [[endangered species]], shrinkage of [[rain forest]]s, [[Desertification|expansion of deserts]], destruction of the [[ozone layer]], [[acid rain]], and increased [[water pollution|water]] and [[air pollution]] in [[developing country|developing countries]]. Most believed that Japan, alone or in cooperation with other industrialized countries, had the responsibility to solve environmental problems. In the 2007 opinion poll, 31.8% of the people answered environmental conservation activity leads to more economic development, 22.0% answered the environmental activity does not always obstruct the economic, 23.3% answered environmental conservation should be given preference even if it may obstruct the economic and 3.2\uff05 answered economic development should place priority than environmental conservation.<ref>[http://www8.cao.go.jp/survey/h17/h17-environment/2-1.html \u74b0\u5883\u554f\u984c\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u4e16\u8ad6\u8abf\u67fb] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208092325/http://www8.cao.go.jp/survey/h17/h17-environment/2-1.html |date=2008-02-08 }}, \u5185\u95a3\u5e9c\u5927\u81e3\u5b98\u623f\u653f\u5e9c\u5e83\u5831\u5ba4</ref>\n\nThe OECD's first Environmental Performance Review of Japan was published in 1994, which applauded the nation for decoupling its economic development from air pollution, as the nation's air quality improved while the economy thrived.

Because of the depletion of ocean stocks in the late 20th century, Japan's total annual fish catch has been diminishing rapidly.

The Environment Agency was promoted to full-fledged [[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] in 2001, to deal with the deteriorating international environmental problems.\n\nIn 1984 the Environmental Agency had issued its first [[white paper]]. In the 1989 study, citizens thought environmental problems had improved compared with the past, nearly 1.7% thought things had improved, 31% thought that they had stayed the same, and nearly 21% thought that they had worsened. Some 75% of those surveyed expressed concern about [[endangered species]], shrinkage of [[rain forest]]s, [[Desertification|expansion of deserts]], destruction of the [[ozone layer]], [[acid rain]], and increased [[water pollution|water]] and [[air pollution]] in [[developing country|developing countries]]. Most believed that Japan, alone or in cooperation with other industrialized countries, had the responsibility to solve environmental problems. In the 2007 opinion poll, 31.8% of the people answered environmental conservation activity leads to more economic development, 22.0% answered the environmental activity does not always obstruct the economic, 23.3% answered environmental conservation should be given preference even if it may obstruct the economic and 3.2\uff05 answered economic development should place priority than environmental conservation.<ref>[http://www8.cao.go.jp/survey/h17/h17-environment/2-1.html \u74b0\u5883\u554f\u984c\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u4e16\u8ad6\u8abf\u67fb] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208092325/http://www8.cao.go.jp/survey/h17/h17-environment/2-1.html |date=2008-02-08 }}, \u5185\u95a3\u5e9c\u5927\u81e3\u5b98\u623f\u653f\u5e9c\u5e83\u5831\u5ba4</ref>\n\nThe OECD's first Environmental Performance Review of Japan was published in 1994, which applauded the nation for decoupling its economic development from air pollution, as the nation's air quality improved while the economy thrived.

While a majority of Japanese citizens generally supported the use of existing nuclear reactors, since the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|nuclear accident]] at the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant]] on March 11, 2011, this support seems to have shifted to a majority wanting Japan to phase out nuclear power.

Some local cities announced a plan to conduct an environmental study at the disposal site, but citizens' groups strongly oppose the plan.\n\n===Fishery and whaling===\n{{main|Fishing industry in Japan|Whaling in Japan}}\nIn Japanese diets, fish and its products are more prominent than other types of meat. Because of the depletion of ocean stocks in the late 20th century, Japan's total annual fish catch has been diminishing rapidly. Japan, along with the United States and the European Union, occupies the large part of international fish trade.<ref>[http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/ah876e/ah876e10.htm Fish and fishery products], Food and Agriculture Organization</ref> Japanese fish catches were the third in the world in 2000, following China and Peru.

Her work reflects certain recurring themes such as nature, magic, faith and redemption, and often references visual art.\n\n== Background ==\nMarly Youmans grew up in [[Louisiana]], [[North Carolina]], and elsewhere. She currently lives in the village of [[Cooperstown, New York]], with her husband and three children. She graduated from [[Hollins College]], [[Brown University]], and [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].  She taught at [[State University of New York]] but quit academia after receiving promotion and tenure in her fifth year.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xxd451POnpYC&pg=PT485&dq=Marly+Youmans&cd=5#v=onepage&q=Marly%20Youmans&f=false| title=Southern writers: a new biographical dictionary| editors=Joseph M. Flora, Amber Vogel, Bryan Albin Giemza| publisher=LSU Press| year= 2006| isbn=978-0-8071-3123-7 }}</ref>\n\n== Writing ==\nHer published work consists of five books of poetry, eight novels and two fantasies for young readers, as well as uncollected short stories, essays and poems. Across all these idioms, her work displays a commitment to rhythm, the sound of words, imagery and complexity of form and allusion. ''Thaliad'', for example, is an epic poem that tells a compelling story of children who survive an apocalypse to begin a new society, written as though a spoken history remembranced in blank verse a generation on. Her novels have been described as 'literary fiction at its finest' in ''Books and Culture''<ref>[http://www.booksandculture.com/articles/webexclusives/2012/may/whitecamellia.html Linda McCullough Moore, Books and Culture, May 2012]</ref> while ''The Advocate'' has cited her skill at mastering poetic forms.<ref>[http://theadvocate.com/utility/homepagestories/4857392-129/poets-invite-readers-to-share Greg Langley, ''The Advocate'', 30 January 2013]</ref> The editor of Books and Culture says, \"Youmans (pronounced like 'yeoman' with an 's' added) is the best-kept secret among contemporary American writers.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Top Ten Books of 2003|url = http://www.booksandculture.com/articles/webexclusives/2003/december/031222.html|website = Books and Culture|access-date = 2016-01-29}}</ref>\n\nHer books demonstrate a number of continuing interests: in lives lived close to nature, whether in the past (''Catherwood'') or the future (''Thaliad''), magic, faith and redemption (''Val/Orson'', ''The Foliate Head'') and the individual\u2019s journey from youth to adulthood (''Inglewood'', ''A Death at the White Camelia Orphanage''). Visual art is often referenced in her work and ''Thaliad,'' ''The Foliate Head, Glimmerglass, and Maze of Blood'' were collaborations with the artist [[Clive Hicks-Jenkins]] with decorations throughout the texts. She provided the title poems for an illustrated anthology, ''The Book of Ystwyth: Six Poets on the Art of Clive Hicks-Jenkins''.<ref>Bonta, Dave, Callum James, Andrea Selch, Catriona Urquhart, Damian Walford Davies and Marly Youmans, ''The Book of Ystwyth: Six Poets on the Art of Clive Hicks-Jenkins'' (2011: Carolina Wren Press) {{ISBN|978-0-932112-89-7}}\n</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\nYoumans has been awarded many \"book of the year\" and \"best of the year\" citations by magazines, newspapers, and organizations.

South Carolina]]) is an American poet, novelist and short story writer. Her work reflects certain recurring themes such as nature, magic, faith and redemption, and often references visual art.\n\n== Background ==\nMarly Youmans grew up in [[Louisiana]], [[North Carolina]], and elsewhere. She currently lives in the village of [[Cooperstown, New York]], with her husband and three children. She graduated from [[Hollins College]], [[Brown University]], and [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].  She taught at [[State University of New York]] but quit academia after receiving promotion and tenure in her fifth year.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xxd451POnpYC&pg=PT485&dq=Marly+Youmans&cd=5#v=onepage&q=Marly%20Youmans&f=false| title=Southern writers: a new biographical dictionary| editors=Joseph M. Flora, Amber Vogel, Bryan Albin Giemza| publisher=LSU Press| year= 2006| isbn=978-0-8071-3123-7 }}</ref>\n\n== Writing ==\nHer published work consists of five books of poetry, eight novels and two fantasies for young readers, as well as uncollected short stories, essays and poems. Across all these idioms, her work displays a commitment to rhythm, the sound of words, imagery and complexity of form and allusion. ''Thaliad'', for example, is an epic poem that tells a compelling story of children who survive an apocalypse to begin a new society, written as though a spoken history remembranced in blank verse a generation on. Her novels have been described as 'literary fiction at its finest' in ''Books and Culture''<ref>[http://www.booksandculture.com/articles/webexclusives/2012/may/whitecamellia.html Linda McCullough Moore, Books and Culture, May 2012]</ref> while ''The Advocate'' has cited her skill at mastering poetic forms.<ref>[http://theadvocate.com/utility/homepagestories/4857392-129/poets-invite-readers-to-share Greg Langley, ''The Advocate'', 30 January 2013]</ref> The editor of Books and Culture says, \"Youmans (pronounced like 'yeoman' with an 's' added) is the best-kept secret among contemporary American writers.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Top Ten Books of 2003|url = http://www.booksandculture.com/articles/webexclusives/2003/december/031222.html|website = Books and Culture|access-date = 2016-01-29}}</ref>\n\nHer books demonstrate a number of continuing interests: in lives lived close to nature, whether in the past (''Catherwood'') or the future (''Thaliad''), magic, faith and redemption (''Val/Orson'', ''The Foliate Head'') and the individual\u2019s journey from youth to adulthood (''Inglewood'', ''A Death at the White Camelia Orphanage''). Visual art is often referenced in her work and ''Thaliad,'' ''The Foliate Head, Glimmerglass, and Maze of Blood'' were collaborations with the artist [[Clive Hicks-Jenkins]] with decorations throughout the texts. She provided the title poems for an illustrated anthology, ''The Book of Ystwyth: Six Poets on the Art of Clive Hicks-Jenkins''.<ref>Bonta, Dave, Callum James, Andrea Selch, Catriona Urquhart, Damian Walford Davies and Marly Youmans, ''The Book of Ystwyth: Six Poets on the Art of Clive Hicks-Jenkins'' (2011: Carolina Wren Press) {{ISBN|978-0-932112-89-7}}\n</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\nYoumans has been awarded many \"book of the year\" and \"best of the year\" citations by magazines, newspapers, and organizations.

It is also the headquarters of the [[Sivaganga District]]. The town is located at a distance of {{convert|48|km|abbr=on}} from [[Madurai]] and {{convert|449|km|abbr=on}} from the state capital [[Chennai]]. It is an important town in this district for official and commercial purposes. Its nickname was '''Sivagangai Seemai ( \u0b9a\u0bbf\u0bb5\u0b95\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc8 \u0b9a\u0bc0\u0bae\u0bc8 ) '''.\n\nSivaganga kingdom was founded by Sasivarna Periya Oodaya Thevar in 1730. The town was subsequently ruled by his successors and ultimately by [[Velu Nachiyar]] under the stewardship of [[Maruthu Pandiyar]]. They were against the [[British Empire]], but ultimately lost to them in 1790. The Company appointed Gowry Vallaba Periya Oodaya Thevar as the Zamindar of Sivaganga in 1801, whose successors continued with chaos until India's independence in 1947.

The seventh king of the empire, [[Vijaya Raghunatha Sethupathi]] (also called Kelvan Sethupathy) ruled from 1674 to 1710 and was succeeded by his sister's son Vijia Regunatha Sethupathy. He was succeeded by his son-in-law Sundareswara Regunatha Sethupathy in 1726. Bavani Sankara Thevan, the illegitimate son of Regunatha Sethupathy aligned with the Rajah of Tanjore to attack Ramnad. Though Bavani won, he did not honour the earlier decision to cede some portions of the empire to the King of Tanjore. He quarrelled with Sasivarna Periya Oodaya Thevar and sent him out of his province. Both Sasivarna and Kattaya Thevar, the brother of Sundareswara, aligned with the Rajah of Tanjore. Both of them conquered Bavani in 1730 with the help of the army of Tanjore. Kattaya Thevar divided the kingdom into five provinces and gave two to Sasivarna, who became the first king of Sivaganga. As per legend, Sasivarna built the Teppakulam and fort around the spring \"Sivaganga\", where he met his spiritual guru Sathappier. As per another account, Sasivarna was appointed as the king by the [[Nawab of Carnatic]].<ref>[[#Iyer|Iyer 1899]], pp. i-ii</ref> Sasivarna died at around 1750 and his son Muthuvaduganatha Periya Udaya Thevar took over the reign. He was shot dead in 1780 by Nawab's troops. His widow [[Velu Nachiyar]] and infant [[Vellacci]] fled the region and were aided by the two [[Maruthu Pandiyar|Maruthu brothers]] namely Periya Maruthu and Chinna Maruthu. Velu Nachiyar ruled the region till 1790, when her daughter succeeded her. The brothers still continued the support the new queen. The brothers rebelled against the British East India Company and Nawab of Carnatic, who was supporting the Company. The brothers were later captured and hanged in Tirupathoor. The Company appointed Gowry Vallaba Periya Oodaya Thevar as the Zamindar of Sivaganga in 1801.<ref>[[#Iyer|Iyer 1899]], pp. iii-iv</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Municipality Office-Sivagangai.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sivaganga Municipality Office]]\nSivaganga has an average elevation of 102&nbsp;metres (334&nbsp;[[foot (length)|feet]]).The town has a [[tropical wet and dry climate]].

The seventh king of the empire, [[Vijaya Raghunatha Sethupathi]] (also called Kelvan Sethupathy) ruled from 1674 to 1710 and was succeeded by his sister's son Vijia Regunatha Sethupathy. He was succeeded by his son-in-law Sundareswara Regunatha Sethupathy in 1726. Bavani Sankara Thevan, the illegitimate son of Regunatha Sethupathy aligned with the Rajah of Tanjore to attack Ramnad. Though Bavani won, he did not honour the earlier decision to cede some portions of the empire to the King of Tanjore. He quarrelled with Sasivarna Periya Oodaya Thevar and sent him out of his province. Both Sasivarna and Kattaya Thevar, the brother of Sundareswara, aligned with the Rajah of Tanjore. Both of them conquered Bavani in 1730 with the help of the army of Tanjore. Kattaya Thevar divided the kingdom into five provinces and gave two to Sasivarna, who became the first king of Sivaganga. As per legend, Sasivarna built the Teppakulam and fort around the spring \"Sivaganga\", where he met his spiritual guru Sathappier. As per another account, Sasivarna was appointed as the king by the [[Nawab of Carnatic]].<ref>[[#Iyer|Iyer 1899]], pp. i-ii</ref> Sasivarna died at around 1750 and his son Muthuvaduganatha Periya Udaya Thevar took over the reign. He was shot dead in 1780 by Nawab's troops. His widow [[Velu Nachiyar]] and infant [[Vellacci]] fled the region and were aided by the two [[Maruthu Pandiyar|Maruthu brothers]] namely Periya Maruthu and Chinna Maruthu. Velu Nachiyar ruled the region till 1790, when her daughter succeeded her. The brothers still continued the support the new queen. The brothers rebelled against the British East India Company and Nawab of Carnatic, who was supporting the Company. The brothers were later captured and hanged in Tirupathoor. The Company appointed Gowry Vallaba Periya Oodaya Thevar as the Zamindar of Sivaganga in 1801.<ref>[[#Iyer|Iyer 1899]], pp. iii-iv</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Municipality Office-Sivagangai.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sivaganga Municipality Office]]\nSivaganga has an average elevation of 102&nbsp;metres (334&nbsp;[[foot (length)|feet]]).The town has a [[tropical wet and dry climate]].
