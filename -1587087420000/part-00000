The 2017 election also saw the first party under MMP in New Zealand to lead a government without commanding the plurality of the party vote.\n\n===Current standings===\n{{52nd New Zealand Parliament}}\n*{{note|Coalition|Coa}} [[New Zealand First]] announced a coalition agreement with the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] on 19 October 2017.\n*{{note|Confidence|CS}} The [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] entered into a [[confidence and supply]] agreement with the Labour Party on the same day as the coalition was announced.\n{{notelist}}\n*{{note|Ross|Ind1}} National MP [[Jami-Lee Ross]] resigned from the party in October 2018 after an alleged leak of party documents and a public spat with party leader [[Simon Bridges]]. He has continued to represent his electorate as an independent MP.\n\n== Electoral system ==\n{{main|Electoral system of New Zealand}}\n\nNew Zealand uses the [[mixed-member proportional]] (MMP) voting system to elect the House of Representatives. Each voter gets two votes, one for a political party (the party vote) and one for a local candidate (the electorate vote). Political parties which meet the threshold (5% of the party vote or one electorate seat) receive seats in the House in proportion to the percentage of the party vote they receive. 72 of the 120 seats are filled by the MPs elected from the [[New Zealand electorates|electorates]], with the winner in each electorate determined by the [[first-past-the-post voting|first past the post method]] (i.e. most votes wins). The remaining 48 seats are filled by candidates from each party's closed [[party list]]. If a party wins more electorates than seats it is entitled to under the party vote, an [[overhang seat|overhang]] results; in this case, the House will add extra seats to cover the overhang.\n\nThe political party or party bloc with the majority of the seats in the House forms the [[Government of New Zealand|Government]]. Since the introduction of MMP in 1996, no party has won enough votes to win an outright majority of seats. As a result, parties must negotiate with other parties to form a [[coalition government]] or a [[minority government]].\n\n===Electorate boundaries===\n[[File:New Zealand electorate popualtion change, 2018 census.svg|thumb|300x300px|The 2014 electoral boundaries showing electorates out of tolerance following the 2018 census and M\u0101ori electoral option. Red electorates are more than 5% above quota and therefore must drop population.

prior to election day, parties and candidates have limits on how much they may spend on election campaigning. It is illegal in New Zealand to campaign on election day itself.<ref>[[Electoral Act 1993]], section 197.</ref>\n\nThe limits on electoral expenses are updated every year to reflect inflation. For the 2019/20 fiscal year, every registered party contending the party vote is permitted to spend [[NZD|$]]1,169,000 on election campaigning during the regulated period, excluding radio and television campaigning (broadcasting funding is allocated separately). Additionally, all electorate candidates are permitted to spend $27,500 each on campaigning over and above their party's allocation.<ref>[[Electoral Act 1993]], section 205(c).</ref> A party contesting all 72 electorates is therefore permitted to spend $3,149,000 on election campaigning.<ref>[[Electoral Act 1993]], section 206(c).</ref>\n\nRegistered parties are allocated a separate broadcasting budget for radio and television campaigning. Only money from the broadcasting allocation can be used to purchase airtime; the actual production costs of advertisements can come from the general election expenses budget. The Electoral Commission sets the amount of broadcasting funds each party gets; generally the allocation is based on the number of seats in the current Parliament, previous election results, and support in opinion polls.\n\nThird party promoters, such as trade unions and [[Advocacy group|lobby groups]], can campaign during the regulated period. The maximum expense limit for the 2019/20 fiscal year is $330,000 for those promoters registered with the Electoral Commission,<ref>[[Electoral Act 1993]], section 206(v).</ref> and $13,200 for unregistered promoters.<ref>[[Electoral Act 1993]], section 204(b).</ref>\n\n=== Party campaigns ===\n{{Expand section|date=February 2020}}\n\nAfter the announcement of the 19 September election date, parties started their campaigns.<ref name=\"NZH campaigning\">{{cite news |last1=Trevett |first1=Claire |title=The 2020 election campaign: Labour and National's strategies |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12304906 |accessdate=2 February 2020 |work=NZ Herald |date=1 February 2020 |url-access=subscription<!--inspect element #article-content p--> |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200201200534/https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12304906 |archive-date=1 February 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==== National ====\n[[Paula Bennett]] was chosen as [[campaign manager]].

He has continued to represent his electorate as an independent MP.\n\n== Electoral system ==\n{{main|Electoral system of New Zealand}}\n\nNew Zealand uses the [[mixed-member proportional]] (MMP) voting system to elect the House of Representatives. Each voter gets two votes, one for a political party (the party vote) and one for a local candidate (the electorate vote). Political parties which meet the threshold (5% of the party vote or one electorate seat) receive seats in the House in proportion to the percentage of the party vote they receive. 72 of the 120 seats are filled by the MPs elected from the [[New Zealand electorates|electorates]], with the winner in each electorate determined by the [[first-past-the-post voting|first past the post method]] (i.e. most votes wins). The remaining 48 seats are filled by candidates from each party's closed [[party list]]. If a party wins more electorates than seats it is entitled to under the party vote, an [[overhang seat|overhang]] results; in this case, the House will add extra seats to cover the overhang.\n\nThe political party or party bloc with the majority of the seats in the House forms the [[Government of New Zealand|Government]]. Since the introduction of MMP in 1996, no party has won enough votes to win an outright majority of seats. As a result, parties must negotiate with other parties to form a [[coalition government]] or a [[minority government]].\n\n===Electorate boundaries===\n[[File:New Zealand electorate popualtion change, 2018 census.svg|thumb|300x300px|The 2014 electoral boundaries showing electorates out of tolerance following the 2018 census and M\u0101ori electoral option.

The most recent election was held on 23 September 2017.\n\nThe [[Governor-General of New Zealand|governor-general]] must issue [[Writ of election|writs]] for an election within seven days of the expiration or dissolution of the current parliament. Under section 17 of the [[Constitution Act 1986]], parliament expires three years \"from the day fixed for the return of the writs issued for the last preceding general election of members of the House of Representatives, and no longer.\" The writs for the 2017 election were returned on 12 October 2017. As a result, the 52nd Parliament must dissolve no later than 12 October 2020. Consequently, the last day for issuance of writs of election is 19 October 2020. The writs must be returned within 50 days of their issuance (save for any judicial recount or death of a candidate), which would be 7 December 2020.<ref name=legislation1>{{cite web |url= http://legislation.co.nz/act/public/1993/0087/latest/DLM309482.html |title=Electoral Act 1993, Sec. 139 |date=17 August 2011 |website=Legislation.co.nz |accessdate=22 October 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160629065145/http://legislation.co.nz/act/public/1993/0087/latest/DLM309482.html#DLM309482 |archivedate=29 June 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Because polling day must be on a Saturday,<ref name=legislation1/> and two weeks is generally required for the counting of special votes, the last possible date for the next general election is 21 November 2020.\n\nOn 28 January 2020, Ardern announced that the election will be held on 19 September,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/118983011/jacinda-ardern-announces-2020-election-will-be-held-on-september-19 |title=Jacinda Ardern announces 2020 election will be held on September 19 |first1=Luke |last1=Malpass |first2=Henry |last2=Cooke |work=Stuff.co.nz |date=28 January 2020 |accessdate=28 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128021549/https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/118983011/jacinda-ardern-announces-2020-election-will-be-held-on-september-19 |archive-date=28 January 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> with the {{show by date|2020|9|19|current|52nd}} parliament holding its last sitting day on 6 August and dissolving on 12 August.<ref name=\"election date\"/>\n\nThe date of 19 September was announced before the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in New Zealand|COVID-19 pandemic had reached New Zealand]].

prior to election day, parties and candidates have limits on how much they may spend on election campaigning. It is illegal in New Zealand to campaign on election day itself.<ref>[[Electoral Act 1993]], section 197.</ref>\n\nThe limits on electoral expenses are updated every year to reflect inflation. For the 2019/20 fiscal year, every registered party contending the party vote is permitted to spend [[NZD|$]]1,169,000 on election campaigning during the regulated period, excluding radio and television campaigning (broadcasting funding is allocated separately). Additionally, all electorate candidates are permitted to spend $27,500 each on campaigning over and above their party's allocation.<ref>[[Electoral Act 1993]], section 205(c).</ref> A party contesting all 72 electorates is therefore permitted to spend $3,149,000 on election campaigning.<ref>[[Electoral Act 1993]], section 206(c).</ref>\n\nRegistered parties are allocated a separate broadcasting budget for radio and television campaigning.

While only the United States and Russia have maintained strong nuclear triads for most of the nuclear age, there are other countries that have triad powers.<ref name=\"Time\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/russias_nuclear_rearmament_policy_shift_or_business_as_usual/|title=Russia's Nuclear Rearmament: Policy Shift or Business as Usual? {{!}} NTI|website=www.nti.org|access-date=2018-04-03}}</ref> These countries include China, India, and France.<ref name=\":0\" /> Both the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] have had the strongest, and longest-living triads.<ref name=\":0\" /> These triads include the following components:\n#[[Bomber aircraft]]: Aircraft carrying nuclear bombs, or nuclear-armed cruise missiles, for use against ground or sea targets.<ref name=\"NW\"/><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web |url= http://www.nti.org/learn/glossary/#intercontinental-ballistic-missile-icbm |title= Glossary {{!}} Learn {{!}} NTI |website= www.nti.org |access-date= 2018-04-03 }}</ref>\n#Land-based [[missiles]] ([[MRBM]]s or [[ICBM]]s): Delivery vehicles powered by a liquid or solid-fueled rocket that primarily travel in a ballistic (free-fall) trajectory.<ref name=\"NW\"/><ref name=\"Time\"/><ref name=\":3\" /> \n#[[Ballistic missile submarine]]s ([[Ballistic missile submarine|SSBNs]]): Nuclear missiles launched from ships or submarines.

For the United States, the idea to have these three options was for the purpose of retaliation. If two of the three legs of the triad were destroyed, the third could still have a retaliatory strike. Also, having these three legs protects against the issue of new technology, like an enemy [[Missile defense|missile-defense system]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2001/11/what_is_the_nuclear_triad.html|title=What Is the Nuclear Triad?|last=Suellentrop|first=Chris|date=2001-11-15|work=Slate|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}</ref> It also gives the [[commander-in-chief]] the flexibility to use different types of weapons for the appropriate strike while also maintaining a reserve of nuclear weapons safe from a counter-force strike.\n\n* [[Strategic bomber]]s are the first leg of the triad. They have greater flexibility in their deployment and weaponry.  Some of the many advantages of bombers are that they can be quickly deployed and recalled in response to last-minute decisions.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2017/ph241/chabolla2/|title=US Nuclear Triad Overview|website=large.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-04-03}}</ref> Since bombers are recallable, sending them away from a potential target is a highly visible way of demonstrating to enemies and allies that you want to resolve a fight, thus preventing war.<ref name=\":1\" /> Some disadvantages include confusion on the type of [[payload]]. Bombers can hold both nuclear and conventional weapons. During an event, an enemy could suspect that a conventionally-armed bomber was actually carrying a nuclear weapon, encouraging the enemy to attack the bomber or make a nuclear strike.<ref name=\":1\" /> Furthermore, bombers that are scrambled might intensify tension and arouse suspicion of an upcoming nuclear strike.<ref name=\":1\" /> Bombers can serve as both a first- and second-strike weapon. For example, a bomber armed with [[AGM-129 ACM]] missiles could be classified as a first-strike weapon and bombers that are classified as an [[aerial refueling]] aircraft would constitute as a [[Second strike|second-strike]] weapon.<ref name=\"NW\" /><ref name=\"Time\" /> If dispersed in small airfields or aboard an aircraft carrier, they can reasonably avoid a counterstrike giving them regional second-strike capacity. Aircraft such as the [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000]], [[McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle|F-15E]], [[North American A-5 Vigilante|A-5 Vigilante]], [[Sea Harrier]], or [[FB-111]] were tasked with land or sea-based strategic nuclear attack missions.  Bombers that contain an [[aerial refueling]] fleet support intercontinental strategic operations for both heavy bombers and smaller aircraft. It also makes it possible for bombers to be alert and on standby, making these airborne assets nearly impossible to eliminate in a first strike.<ref name=\"heritage.org\" />\n\n* [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles]] (ICBMs) allow for a long-range strike launched from a controlled environment.

The USSR entered the nuclear age in 1949 with [[RDS-1|their imitation]] of the American [[Fat Man]] plutonium implosion design. Although the Soviet Union was behind the U.S in the years following [[World War II]] in terms of nuclear development, they soon closed the gap. By 1953, the U.S successfully tested the world's first hydrogen bomb, [[Ivy Mike]] with a yield of about 10 MT. It was only two years later on August 12, 1955 that the Soviet Union successfully tested their own hydrogen bomb, the [[RDS-6]] (known as Joe-4 in America). In addition, the development of stealth and fighter bombers by the USSR were heavily modeled on the American counterparts, the [[B-2]] and [[B-47]].\n\n=====ICBMs=====\nThe development of the ICBM (Inter-continental Ballistic Missile) was led by the Soviet Union. The first-ever mid-range ballistic missile, R-5M, was created by the Soviet Union and accepted for military purposes on July 21, 1956. This missile had a range of 700 miles with a yield of 1 MT. From its acceptance in 1956 until 1968 there were 48 launchers with R-5M ballistic missiles equipped with nuclear warheads deployed by the Soviet Union.<ref>Wade, Mark. \"R-5M\". Encyclopedia Astronautica. Retrieved 10 April 2018.</ref>\n\nAfter the creation of ICBMs and improvements on distance and accuracy had been achieved, the modernization of the Soviet nuclear arsenal was undertaken. The first \"shrapnel\" [[Multiple reentry vehicle|MRVs]] (Multiple reentry vehicles) were successfully tested by 1970 with the [[R-36 (missile)|R-36]] (or SS-9) ICBM, and their deployment followed the next year. This meant that a single missile would now contain multiple nuclear warheads. Further development using the R-36 heavy ICBM type created the [[R-36M]] (SS-18). MRV's evolved into [[MIRV]]s, which did not function as dispersal devices, but rather allowed independent targets for the multiple nuclear warheads. MIRV as well as single warhead R-36 ICBMS were deployed by the Soviet Union in 1975. The next generation of the Soviet ICBM was the R-36M UTTH, which increased the accuracy of the warhead and allowed for innovations that allowed the missiles to carry up to 8 warheads. The final improved generated the [[R-36M2 Voevoda]], which allowed even more accurate attacks and increased the number of warheads to 10. Some \"light\" ICBMs developed by the Soviet Union included the [[UR-100N]] (SS-19) and the [[MR-UR-100]] (SS-17), with lower launch weights and fewer warhead capabilities. MRVs, unlike MIRVs which allowed for independent targeting, had a downside known as the \"fratricide effect\", which refers to the inability to distance multiple warheads from each other, allowing the chance for the initial explosion to destroy the other warheads.<ref name=\"Arbatov, Alexey 2016\">Arbatov, Alexey, and Vladimir Dvorkin. \"SOVIET UNION.\" MIRVs (2016): 55.</ref>\n\nBy 1975, there were around 1600 ICBM launchers deployed by the Soviet Union. Not only did this number exceed American estimates, but the addition of MRVs and MIRVs further amplified the destructive capabilities of Soviet ICBMs. These launchers also utilized the increases in accuracy and range from the [[SS-17]], [[SS-18]], [[SS-19]] ICBM silo-based types. One final advent to the Soviet Union's development of ICBMs was the mobile-launcher [[SS-20]] type.<ref>Odom, William E. \u201cThe Soviet Approach to Nuclear Weapons: A Historical Review.\u201d The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, vol. 469, 1983, pp. 117\u2013135. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1044540.</ref>\n\nMIRVs were not mentioned in the [[SALT I]] treaty (Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty) between the US and USSR in 1972, and consequently were insignificantly limited in the [[SALT II]] treaty of 1979. As a result, the increase in ICBM launchers and nuclear warheads continued by both countries. It is thought that the Soviet Union attained an advantage regarding ICBMs by the late 1970s.<ref>Podvig, P. \"The Window of Vulnerability That Wasn't: Soviet Military Buildup in the 1970s\u2014A Research Note.\" International Security, vol. 33 no. 1, 2008, pp. 118\u2013138.

They launched the first SLBM, with a [[R-11FM]] ballistic missile in 1956, and in 1957 introduced submarines with two R-11FM's in 1957.<ref>Wade, Mark. \"R-11\". Encyclopedia Astronautica. Retrieved 10 April 2011.</ref> However, these early submarines had to be surfaced in order to launch their missiles. It is in this aspect that the US became the leader when they deployed the first SSBN, {{USS|George Washington|SSBN-598}}, in 1959 with [[Polaris A-1]] missiles able to be launched underwater. However, the first successful underwater launch of a ballistic missile was in July 1960. It was not until 1963 that the Soviet Union was able to match the US in this regard, with a R-21 missile. There was also a considerable gap between the United States employment of MRVs and MIRVs on SLBM's to that of the Soviet's, which the US had achieved as early as 1964. In 1974, the USSR deployed [[SS-N-6]], the first Soviet SSBN with shrapnel MRV nuclear warheads. Three years later, the Soviet Navy deployed their first SLBM with MIRV warheads, the [[SS-N-18]] missile<ref name=\"Arbatov, Alexey 2016\"/>\n\nThese technologies comprise a majority of the nuclear advances made by the Soviet Union from the 1950s\u20131970's. As the 1980s came about, the new technology of cruise-missiles significantly altered deterrence strategies in both the US and Soviet Union. At this point, the nuclear triad maintained its importance in ensuring a second-strike capability, although this significance has waned dramatically since the end of the Cold War.\n\n===United States===\n{{main|United States Strategic Command|Air Force Global Strike Command|Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|LGM-30 Minuteman|Regulus missile submarines|41 for Freedom|Ohio-class submarine}}\n\n==== Nuclear triad during the Cold War (1960\u20131990) ====\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 520\n\n | image2 = Titan II launch.jpg\n | alt2 = \n | caption2 = \n\n | image1 = USS George Washington (SSBN-598) underway at sea, circa in the 1970s.jpg\n | alt1 = \n | caption1 = \n\n | image3 = B-52G with Hound dog flight test K-6951 (7251450430).jpg\n | alt3 = \n | caption3 = \n\n | footer = The elements of the US nuclear triad in the 1960s - a {{sclass-|George Washington|submarine|0}} SSBN, an [[LGM-25C Titan II]] ICBM and a [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52G Stratofortress]] strategic bomber\n}}\nThe origins of the United States' nuclear triad can be traced back to the 1960s. Its main motivation for developing the program was that the [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Army|Army]], and [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] all wanted to play a role in the operation of the country's [[Nuclear weapons of the United States|nuclear arsenal]].<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc847627/m2/1/high_res_d/RL33640_2016Mar10.pdf|title=U.S. Strategic Nuclear Forces: Background, Developments, and Issues|last=Woolf|first=Amy|date=March 10, 2016|access-date=April 5, 2018}}</ref> The United States also desired the nuclear triad because it would give them a variety of platforms to deliver a deadly strike to the Soviet Union. Forcing the Soviet Union to put focus on potential attacks from the land, air, and sea would give the United States a significant advantage in terms of deterrence. Specifically, the nuclear triad was viewed as a way to complicate Soviet first strike and attack planning as well as ensure the survivability of U.S. assets.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThroughout the 1960s, the United States steadily commissioned increasing numbers of delivery vehicles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. In 1967, the greatest number of deployment ready delivery vehicles of the decade was recorded at 2,268.<ref name=\":5\" /> In 1970, a significant change brought about a dramatic increase in the nuclear arsenal. The 1970s saw a large increase in delivery vehicles and warheads because of the introduction of the [[Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle|multiple independent reentry vehicle]] or MIRV, which allowed for the deployment of ICBMs and SLBMs that could carry multiple warheads.<ref name=\":5\" /> Up until 1990 and the [[START I|Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty]] (START) with the Soviet Union, the number of delivery vehicles possessed by the United States hovered between 1,875 and 2,200.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n[[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]]<nowiki/>s were viewed by the United States as the means to attack hardened targets within the Soviet Union such as underground bunkers. Stored in underground silos, these long range missiles were accurate and could be fired quickly. During the Cold War, the United States maintained multiple different types of ICBMs. This portion of the triad consisted of [[Minuteman-II|Minuteman II]] missiles (single warhead), [[Minuteman-III|Minuteman III]] missiles (three-warhead), and [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|Peacekeeper]] missiles (ten-warhead). The ICBM count for the United States in 1990 included 2,450 warheads in 1,000 ICBMs.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn terms of submarine launched missiles, the United States utilized various classes of submarines as the delivery vehicles. Missile submarines played an especially important role in terms of strategic deterrence. These submarines were extremely hard to locate and could be positioned right off of enemy coastlines. In terms of the nuclear triad, this leg was meant to be the most survivable. The United States commissioned various classes of submarines throughout the Cold War as new improvements were made to each class. The first submarines to carry nuclear weapons were a collection of [[Regulus missile submarines|five boats]] equipped with the [[SSM-N-8 Regulus]] [[cruise missile]], which were employed in the Pacific as part of the regular strategic deterrent from 1959 to 1964. The Regulus boats were essentially a stop-gap until sufficient [[ballistic missile submarine]]s became available. Referred to as the \"[[41 for Freedom]],\" the {{sclass-|George Washington|submarine|5}}, {{sclass-|Ethan Allen| submarine|5}}, {{sclass-|Lafayette|submarine|5}}, {{sclass-|James Madison|submarine|5}}, and {{sclass-|Benjamin Franklin|submarine|4}}es were all commissioned between 1959 and 1967.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ssbn655.org/41-for-freedom/41-for-freedom.html|title=41 for Freedom|date=2017|access-date=April 6, 2018}}</ref> These classes of submarines carried [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris A-1/A-2/A-3]], [[UGM-73 Poseidon|Poseidon C-3]] and [[UGM-96 Trident I|Trident C-4]] missiles. Along with the \"41 for Freedom\" classes, the United States also commissioned the {{sclass-|Ohio|submarine|2}}s before the Cold War's end. ''Ohio''-class submarines carried Trident C-4 and [[UGM-133 Trident II|Trident D-5]] missiles. In 1990, the United States was in possession of around 600 SLBMs and 5,216 warheads.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nRounding out the United States' nuclear triad during the Cold War were its [[Strategic bomber|long-range bombers]]. The leg of the nuclear triad was the most versatile since bombers could be moved quickly and recalled if necessary to avoid unnecessary strikes. The U.S. bomber force during the Cold War consisted of [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52H and B-52G Stratofortresses]], [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer|B-1 Lancers]], and the newly commissioned [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirits]]. By 1990, the United States possessed 94 B-52H bombers, 96 B-1 bombers, and 2 B-2 bombers, along with a total of almost 5,000 available weapons.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==== Nuclear triad after the Cold War (1990\u20132010) ====\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 520\n\n | image2 = LGM-118A Peacekeeper Test Launch.jpg\n | alt2 = \n | caption2 = \n\n | image1 = USS Henry M.

These treaties called for the reduction of nuclear warheads and delivery systems within both the Soviet Union and the United States. Specifically, the U.S. was limited to 6,000 total warheads, 4,900 warheads on ballistic missiles, and 1,600 delivery vehicles.<ref name=\":5\" /> Consequentially, the United States began reducing both its warhead and delivery vehicle counts during this time. By the time they had completed the implementation of the START Treaty in 2001, the total warhead count was 6,196 and the total delivery system count was 1,064.<ref name=\":5\" /> These values continued to shrink, and by 2009 the United States reduced its warhead and delivery vehicles counts to 2,200 and 850 respectively.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nFollowing the Cold War, the United States continued upgrading its various types of ICBMs. [[Minuteman-II|Minuteman II]] variants were all but eliminated and continued efforts were put toward [[Minuteman-III|Minuteman III]] and [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|Peacekeeper]] variants. In 2001, the United States possessed 500 Minuteman III missiles (three warheads each) and 50 Peacekeeper missiles (ten warheads each).<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nWithin its nuclear submarine fleet, the United States eliminated the usage of the \"[[41 for Freedom]]\" classes of ballistic missiles submarines in favor of the more versatile {{sclass-|Ohio|submarine|4}}. During the 1990s, the United States reached a total of 18 submarines within this class.<ref name=\":5\" /> In 2001, these 18 submarines were all deployable and could carry 24 Trident II missiles each (6 to 8 warheads on each missile).<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe United States kept up to date with its strategic bomber leg of the triad following the Cold War as well. B-52G variants were phased out in favor of B-52H classes. In 2001, 94 [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52H]] bombers, each capable of carrying 20 cruise missiles, were active along with 21 B-2 bombers each capable of carrying 16 bombs.<ref name=\":5\" /> [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer|B-1]] Lancer bombers were phased out of the triad and reoriented for different missions in an effort to honor the delivery systems limitations set by the START Treaties.\n\n==== Modern nuclear triad (2010\u2013present) ====\nThe Obama Administration made clear in the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review ([[Nuclear Posture Review|NPR]]) that the United States will retain a nuclear triad for the foreseeable future.<ref name=\":5\" /> Each leg was still viewed as necessary because of how they strengthened each other's weaknesses and gave the United States plenty of options for a nuclear strike should one or multiple legs go down. Following the [[New START Treaty]] set into place in 2010, the United States continued reducing its numbers of warheads and delivery systems with a focus on modernizing and updating its most effective platforms. The United States has released a plan to complete its downsizing efforts in 2018, reducing its 2010 numbers of 880 delivery vehicles and 2,152 warheads to 800 delivery vehicles and 1,550 warheads.<ref name=\":5\" /> In their release of the 2017 [[Nuclear Posture Review|NPR]], the Trump Administration made clear that the United States supports global nuclear weapons elimination. President [[Donald Trump]] also stated his intent to keep the US safe, as well as allies and partners. Until a time where nuclear weapons are not longer needed, the Trump Administration has also stated its intent to maintain a \"modern, flexible, and resilient\" nuclear armada. Since the height of the [[Cold War]], the US's nuclear armada has been reduced by over 85 percent. The Trump Administration acknowledges it faces a \"more diverse and advanced nuclear-threat environment than ever before.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|date=January 27, 2017|title=Nuclear Posture Review|url=https://media.defense.gov/2018/Feb/02/2001872877/-1/-1/1/EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.PDF|journal=Office of the Secretary of Defense|via=US Department of Defense}}</ref>\n\nIt is estimated that the US currently has around 475 [[B61 nuclear bomb|B-61]] and [[B83 nuclear bomb|B-83]] bombs. The B61-7 is carried by the B-2, whereas the B61-3, 4, and 10 are lighter and can be carried by the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]], [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F-35]], and other light aircraft. These smaller bombs also yield smaller payloads due to their decreased size. The B61-11 is a more hardened bomb that can be used to destroy hardened targets such as bunkers, however it is unlikely that it can penetrate steel or concrete. The B83 is currently the largest bomb in the US arsenal. The US plans to retire it by the year 2025 after the new B61 LEP is completed.<ref name=\":5\" />\n[[File:Columbia class.png|thumb|The {{sclass-|Columbia|submarine|0}} is planned as the United States' new SSBN, replacing the ''Ohio''-class|240px]]\n[[File:Artist Rendering B21 Bomber Air Force Official.jpg|thumb|The [[Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider|B-21 Raider]]. This aircraft will serve as the new long range bomber for the United States, replacing the [[B-52H]] and [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2]] bombers.|240x240px]]\nThe United States continues to operate its [[Minuteman-III|Minuteman III ICBMs]] (three warheads each) from underground hardened silos under the command of U.S. [[Air Force Global Strike Command]]. The Peacekeeper variants were eliminated to allow for the United States to honor the reduction requirements set forth by the New START Treaty. By February 2015, the United States Air Force had deactivated all missiles of this type and filled the silos containing them with gravel.<ref name=\":5\" /> The U.S. Minuteman III ICBMs are spread between three Air Force bases which are [[Francis E. Warren Air Force Base]] in Wyoming, [[Malmstrom Air Force Base]] in Montana, and [[Minot Air Force Base]] in North Dakota with each of these bases in possession of 150 missiles.<ref name=\":5\" /> Multiple programs have been put into place and are currently in place to work on up-keeping and modernizing the United States ICBM force including the Propulsion Replacement Program, Guidance Replacement Program, Propulsion System Rocket Engine Program, Safety Enhanced Reentry Vehicle (SERV), Solid Rocket Motor Warm Line Program, Rapid Execution and Combat Targeting (REACT) Service Life Extension Program, and Fuse Replacement Programs. The Air Force plans to keep the Minuteman III program viable and updated through 2030 and is in the process of developing a potential replacement in the form of the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) through various companies such as [[Northrop Grumman]] and [[Lockheed Martin]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe ballistic missile submarine leg of the United States' nuclear triad is still robust. Currently, the SSBN fleet consists of 14 ''Ohio''-class submarines each capable of carrying 24 Trident II missiles.<ref name=\":5\" /> These ballistic missile submarines are based out of [[Kings Bay, Georgia|Kings Bay]], Georgia, and [[Bangor Base, Washington|Bangor]], Washington. The [[New START]] Treaty has led the United States to begin reducing the number of missiles carried on each submarine from 24 to 20 and these reductions will be reached before the end of 2018. In the early 2000s, the United States possessed 18 ''Ohio''-class submarines. Following START Treaty protocol, the United States enacted various programs to reach the treaty's requirements. The Backfit Program was utilized to eliminate the submarines that still carried [[UGM-96 Trident I|Trident I]] missiles leaving the United States with ''Ohio''-class submarines that only carried [[UGM-133 Trident II|Trident II]] missiles.<ref name=\":5\" /> This reduction led to the conversion of four [[Ballistic missile submarine|SSBN]]<nowiki/>s to [[Cruise missile submarine|SSGN]]<nowiki/>s. SSGNs are guided missile submarines which carry conventional Tomahawk cruise missiles. Currently, the United States plans to begin retiring the ''Ohio''-class submarines in 2027. That being said, a replacement for the ''Ohio'' class, the SSBN (X) variant or [[Ohio Replacement Program]], is currently being developed with plans of the first variant entering the Navy in 2031.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe strategic bomber program for the United States still remains viable as well. [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2]] and [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52H]] bombers still make up the entirety of the long range bomber force designed to deliver a nuclear payload. The [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer]] is also used for long range bombing missions. However, in 1997, it was modified to carry only conventional payloads. The B-1 Lancer is no longer used to deliver nuclear payloads. Currently, 76 B-52H bombers are maintained at bases in Barksdale, Louisiana, and Minot, North Dakota. Along with these, 20 B-2 bombers are in service at [[Whiteman Air Force Base]] in Missouri. The United States Air Force is in the process of integrating a new long range bomber, the [[Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider|B-21 Raider]], into service. This aircraft is scheduled to begin service in 2025.<ref name=\":5\" /> The B-21 will contribute to even greater capabilities for the US nuclear armada. It will allow for a larger and more diverse payload that includes current and future weapons. It will allow for increased range compared to the B-1, 2, and 52. The range capabilities of the B-21 are currently classified and are not expected to be released. The B-21 will also cost significantly less than the B-2 bomber. In 1997, the average cost of a B-2 was $737 million. The projected average cost for the B-21 Raider is $550 million per plane.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gertler|first=Jeremiah|date=June 7, 2017|title=Air Force B-21 Raider Long-Range Strike Bomber|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/R44463.pdf|journal=Congressional Research Service|volume=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nLong-Range Standoff, or [[LRSO]], Weapons are another active option available to the US. Air-Launched cruise missiles (ALCM) and Advanced Cruise Missiles (ACM) are the missiles currently maintained by the Air Force. Both are carried via the B-52 bomber. The ACM's most current design makes it have higher stealth capabilities than the ALCM. In 2006, the US had 1,142 ALCMs and 394 ACMs. Since then, the number of ALC missiles has been reduced to 528. By 2030, the Air Force plans to phase out the ALCM and replace them with the long range standoff (LRSO) cruise missile.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nWhile the US currently has strong capabilities and a vast arsenal, concerns about the age of each component of the nuclear triad are valid. The US is working to replace all legs of the nuclear triad, but budget limitations have been extremely restrictive in recent years. Using 2015 as a baseline, the ages of the current systems of the nuclear triad are 45 years for the Minuteman III, 25 years for the Trident II D-5 SLBM, 54 years for the B-52H, 18 years for the B-2, and 34 years for the ''Ohio''-class SSBNs. Compared to other nuclear superpowers, these systems are lagging far behind. During the Cold War, the US led the world in almost all categories. This is no longer the case. A recurring issue with maintaining the nuclear triad is that some manufactures who originally produced parts for some of these systems that are no longer operational. The U.S. cannot produce a solid-fuel rocket engine on its own and currently has to rely on Russia to supply these engines. If the US and Russia became at odds, this could be a major problem for the US.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=October 5, 2017|title=U.S. Nuclear Weapons Capability|url=https://www.heritage.org/military-strength/assessment-us-military-power/us-nuclear-weapons-capability|journal=An Assessment of U.S. Military Power|via=heritage.org}}</ref>\n\n==Former triad powers==\n\n===France===\nDuring the [[Cold War (1953\u20131962)|Cold War]], France obtained [[ballistic missile submarine]]s, land-based missiles, and nuclear-armed bombers.

Bombers can hold both nuclear and conventional weapons.

They are all mostly armed with strategic stand off missiles or cruise missiles such as the [[Kh-15 (missile)|KH-15]] and the [[Kh-55 (missile family)|KH-55/Kh-102]]. These bombers and nuclear capable strike aircraft such as the [[Sukhoi Su-24]] are supported by [[Ilyushin Il-78]] aerial refuelling aircraft.\n\nThe USSR was required to destroy its stock of [[IRBM]]s in accordance with the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty|INF treaty]].\n\n====Soviet nuclear triad during the Cold War====\nThe Soviet Union developed their [[Soviet atomic bomb project|first nuclear bombs]] only a few years after the United States. The USSR entered the nuclear age in 1949 with [[RDS-1|their imitation]] of the American [[Fat Man]] plutonium implosion design. Although the Soviet Union was behind the U.S in the years following [[World War II]] in terms of nuclear development, they soon closed the gap. By 1953, the U.S successfully tested the world's first hydrogen bomb, [[Ivy Mike]] with a yield of about 10 MT. It was only two years later on August 12, 1955 that the Soviet Union successfully tested their own hydrogen bomb, the [[RDS-6]] (known as Joe-4 in America). In addition, the development of stealth and fighter bombers by the USSR were heavily modeled on the American counterparts, the [[B-2]] and [[B-47]].\n\n=====ICBMs=====\nThe development of the ICBM (Inter-continental Ballistic Missile) was led by the Soviet Union. The first-ever mid-range ballistic missile, R-5M, was created by the Soviet Union and accepted for military purposes on July 21, 1956. This missile had a range of 700 miles with a yield of 1 MT. From its acceptance in 1956 until 1968 there were 48 launchers with R-5M ballistic missiles equipped with nuclear warheads deployed by the Soviet Union.<ref>Wade, Mark. \"R-5M\". Encyclopedia Astronautica. Retrieved 10 April 2018.</ref>\n\nAfter the creation of ICBMs and improvements on distance and accuracy had been achieved, the modernization of the Soviet nuclear arsenal was undertaken. The first \"shrapnel\" [[Multiple reentry vehicle|MRVs]] (Multiple reentry vehicles) were successfully tested by 1970 with the [[R-36 (missile)|R-36]] (or SS-9) ICBM, and their deployment followed the next year. This meant that a single missile would now contain multiple nuclear warheads. Further development using the R-36 heavy ICBM type created the [[R-36M]] (SS-18). MRV's evolved into [[MIRV]]s, which did not function as dispersal devices, but rather allowed independent targets for the multiple nuclear warheads. MIRV as well as single warhead R-36 ICBMS were deployed by the Soviet Union in 1975. The next generation of the Soviet ICBM was the R-36M UTTH, which increased the accuracy of the warhead and allowed for innovations that allowed the missiles to carry up to 8 warheads. The final improved generated the [[R-36M2 Voevoda]], which allowed even more accurate attacks and increased the number of warheads to 10. Some \"light\" ICBMs developed by the Soviet Union included the [[UR-100N]] (SS-19) and the [[MR-UR-100]] (SS-17), with lower launch weights and fewer warhead capabilities. MRVs, unlike MIRVs which allowed for independent targeting, had a downside known as the \"fratricide effect\", which refers to the inability to distance multiple warheads from each other, allowing the chance for the initial explosion to destroy the other warheads.<ref name=\"Arbatov, Alexey 2016\">Arbatov, Alexey, and Vladimir Dvorkin. \"SOVIET UNION.\" MIRVs (2016): 55.</ref>\n\nBy 1975, there were around 1600 ICBM launchers deployed by the Soviet Union. Not only did this number exceed American estimates, but the addition of MRVs and MIRVs further amplified the destructive capabilities of Soviet ICBMs. These launchers also utilized the increases in accuracy and range from the [[SS-17]], [[SS-18]], [[SS-19]] ICBM silo-based types. One final advent to the Soviet Union's development of ICBMs was the mobile-launcher [[SS-20]] type.<ref>Odom, William E. \u201cThe Soviet Approach to Nuclear Weapons: A Historical Review.\u201d The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, vol. 469, 1983, pp. 117\u2013135. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1044540.</ref>\n\nMIRVs were not mentioned in the [[SALT I]] treaty (Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty) between the US and USSR in 1972, and consequently were insignificantly limited in the [[SALT II]] treaty of 1979. As a result, the increase in ICBM launchers and nuclear warheads continued by both countries. It is thought that the Soviet Union attained an advantage regarding ICBMs by the late 1970s.<ref>Podvig, P. \"The Window of Vulnerability That Wasn't: Soviet Military Buildup in the 1970s\u2014A Research Note.\" International Security, vol. 33 no. 1, 2008, pp. 118\u2013138.

They launched the first SLBM, with a [[R-11FM]] ballistic missile in 1956, and in 1957 introduced submarines with two R-11FM's in 1957.<ref>Wade, Mark. \"R-11\". Encyclopedia Astronautica. Retrieved 10 April 2011.</ref> However, these early submarines had to be surfaced in order to launch their missiles. It is in this aspect that the US became the leader when they deployed the first SSBN, {{USS|George Washington|SSBN-598}}, in 1959 with [[Polaris A-1]] missiles able to be launched underwater. However, the first successful underwater launch of a ballistic missile was in July 1960. It was not until 1963 that the Soviet Union was able to match the US in this regard, with a R-21 missile. There was also a considerable gap between the United States employment of MRVs and MIRVs on SLBM's to that of the Soviet's, which the US had achieved as early as 1964. In 1974, the USSR deployed [[SS-N-6]], the first Soviet SSBN with shrapnel MRV nuclear warheads. Three years later, the Soviet Navy deployed their first SLBM with MIRV warheads, the [[SS-N-18]] missile<ref name=\"Arbatov, Alexey 2016\"/>\n\nThese technologies comprise a majority of the nuclear advances made by the Soviet Union from the 1950s\u20131970's. As the 1980s came about, the new technology of cruise-missiles significantly altered deterrence strategies in both the US and Soviet Union. At this point, the nuclear triad maintained its importance in ensuring a second-strike capability, although this significance has waned dramatically since the end of the Cold War.\n\n===United States===\n{{main|United States Strategic Command|Air Force Global Strike Command|Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|LGM-30 Minuteman|Regulus missile submarines|41 for Freedom|Ohio-class submarine}}\n\n==== Nuclear triad during the Cold War (1960\u20131990) ====\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 520\n\n | image2 = Titan II launch.jpg\n | alt2 = \n | caption2 = \n\n | image1 = USS George Washington (SSBN-598) underway at sea, circa in the 1970s.jpg\n | alt1 = \n | caption1 = \n\n | image3 = B-52G with Hound dog flight test K-6951 (7251450430).jpg\n | alt3 = \n | caption3 = \n\n | footer = The elements of the US nuclear triad in the 1960s - a {{sclass-|George Washington|submarine|0}} SSBN, an [[LGM-25C Titan II]] ICBM and a [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52G Stratofortress]] strategic bomber\n}}\nThe origins of the United States' nuclear triad can be traced back to the 1960s. Its main motivation for developing the program was that the [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Army|Army]], and [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] all wanted to play a role in the operation of the country's [[Nuclear weapons of the United States|nuclear arsenal]].<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc847627/m2/1/high_res_d/RL33640_2016Mar10.pdf|title=U.S. Strategic Nuclear Forces: Background, Developments, and Issues|last=Woolf|first=Amy|date=March 10, 2016|access-date=April 5, 2018}}</ref> The United States also desired the nuclear triad because it would give them a variety of platforms to deliver a deadly strike to the Soviet Union. Forcing the Soviet Union to put focus on potential attacks from the land, air, and sea would give the United States a significant advantage in terms of deterrence. Specifically, the nuclear triad was viewed as a way to complicate Soviet first strike and attack planning as well as ensure the survivability of U.S. assets.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThroughout the 1960s, the United States steadily commissioned increasing numbers of delivery vehicles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. In 1967, the greatest number of deployment ready delivery vehicles of the decade was recorded at 2,268.<ref name=\":5\" /> In 1970, a significant change brought about a dramatic increase in the nuclear arsenal. The 1970s saw a large increase in delivery vehicles and warheads because of the introduction of the [[Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle|multiple independent reentry vehicle]] or MIRV, which allowed for the deployment of ICBMs and SLBMs that could carry multiple warheads.<ref name=\":5\" /> Up until 1990 and the [[START I|Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty]] (START) with the Soviet Union, the number of delivery vehicles possessed by the United States hovered between 1,875 and 2,200.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n[[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]]<nowiki/>s were viewed by the United States as the means to attack hardened targets within the Soviet Union such as underground bunkers. Stored in underground silos, these long range missiles were accurate and could be fired quickly. During the Cold War, the United States maintained multiple different types of ICBMs. This portion of the triad consisted of [[Minuteman-II|Minuteman II]] missiles (single warhead), [[Minuteman-III|Minuteman III]] missiles (three-warhead), and [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|Peacekeeper]] missiles (ten-warhead). The ICBM count for the United States in 1990 included 2,450 warheads in 1,000 ICBMs.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn terms of submarine launched missiles, the United States utilized various classes of submarines as the delivery vehicles. Missile submarines played an especially important role in terms of strategic deterrence. These submarines were extremely hard to locate and could be positioned right off of enemy coastlines. In terms of the nuclear triad, this leg was meant to be the most survivable. The United States commissioned various classes of submarines throughout the Cold War as new improvements were made to each class. The first submarines to carry nuclear weapons were a collection of [[Regulus missile submarines|five boats]] equipped with the [[SSM-N-8 Regulus]] [[cruise missile]], which were employed in the Pacific as part of the regular strategic deterrent from 1959 to 1964. The Regulus boats were essentially a stop-gap until sufficient [[ballistic missile submarine]]s became available. Referred to as the \"[[41 for Freedom]],\" the {{sclass-|George Washington|submarine|5}}, {{sclass-|Ethan Allen| submarine|5}}, {{sclass-|Lafayette|submarine|5}}, {{sclass-|James Madison|submarine|5}}, and {{sclass-|Benjamin Franklin|submarine|4}}es were all commissioned between 1959 and 1967.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ssbn655.org/41-for-freedom/41-for-freedom.html|title=41 for Freedom|date=2017|access-date=April 6, 2018}}</ref> These classes of submarines carried [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris A-1/A-2/A-3]], [[UGM-73 Poseidon|Poseidon C-3]] and [[UGM-96 Trident I|Trident C-4]] missiles. Along with the \"41 for Freedom\" classes, the United States also commissioned the {{sclass-|Ohio|submarine|2}}s before the Cold War's end. ''Ohio''-class submarines carried Trident C-4 and [[UGM-133 Trident II|Trident D-5]] missiles. In 1990, the United States was in possession of around 600 SLBMs and 5,216 warheads.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nRounding out the United States' nuclear triad during the Cold War were its [[Strategic bomber|long-range bombers]]. The leg of the nuclear triad was the most versatile since bombers could be moved quickly and recalled if necessary to avoid unnecessary strikes. The U.S. bomber force during the Cold War consisted of [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52H and B-52G Stratofortresses]], [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer|B-1 Lancers]], and the newly commissioned [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirits]]. By 1990, the United States possessed 94 B-52H bombers, 96 B-1 bombers, and 2 B-2 bombers, along with a total of almost 5,000 available weapons.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==== Nuclear triad after the Cold War (1990\u20132010) ====\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 520\n\n | image2 = LGM-118A Peacekeeper Test Launch.jpg\n | alt2 = \n | caption2 = \n\n | image1 = USS Henry M.

These treaties called for the reduction of nuclear warheads and delivery systems within both the Soviet Union and the United States. Specifically, the U.S. was limited to 6,000 total warheads, 4,900 warheads on ballistic missiles, and 1,600 delivery vehicles.<ref name=\":5\" /> Consequentially, the United States began reducing both its warhead and delivery vehicle counts during this time. By the time they had completed the implementation of the START Treaty in 2001, the total warhead count was 6,196 and the total delivery system count was 1,064.<ref name=\":5\" /> These values continued to shrink, and by 2009 the United States reduced its warhead and delivery vehicles counts to 2,200 and 850 respectively.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nFollowing the Cold War, the United States continued upgrading its various types of ICBMs. [[Minuteman-II|Minuteman II]] variants were all but eliminated and continued efforts were put toward [[Minuteman-III|Minuteman III]] and [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|Peacekeeper]] variants. In 2001, the United States possessed 500 Minuteman III missiles (three warheads each) and 50 Peacekeeper missiles (ten warheads each).<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nWithin its nuclear submarine fleet, the United States eliminated the usage of the \"[[41 for Freedom]]\" classes of ballistic missiles submarines in favor of the more versatile {{sclass-|Ohio|submarine|4}}. During the 1990s, the United States reached a total of 18 submarines within this class.<ref name=\":5\" /> In 2001, these 18 submarines were all deployable and could carry 24 Trident II missiles each (6 to 8 warheads on each missile).<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe United States kept up to date with its strategic bomber leg of the triad following the Cold War as well. B-52G variants were phased out in favor of B-52H classes. In 2001, 94 [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52H]] bombers, each capable of carrying 20 cruise missiles, were active along with 21 B-2 bombers each capable of carrying 16 bombs.<ref name=\":5\" /> [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer|B-1]] Lancer bombers were phased out of the triad and reoriented for different missions in an effort to honor the delivery systems limitations set by the START Treaties.\n\n==== Modern nuclear triad (2010\u2013present) ====\nThe Obama Administration made clear in the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review ([[Nuclear Posture Review|NPR]]) that the United States will retain a nuclear triad for the foreseeable future.<ref name=\":5\" /> Each leg was still viewed as necessary because of how they strengthened each other's weaknesses and gave the United States plenty of options for a nuclear strike should one or multiple legs go down. Following the [[New START Treaty]] set into place in 2010, the United States continued reducing its numbers of warheads and delivery systems with a focus on modernizing and updating its most effective platforms. The United States has released a plan to complete its downsizing efforts in 2018, reducing its 2010 numbers of 880 delivery vehicles and 2,152 warheads to 800 delivery vehicles and 1,550 warheads.<ref name=\":5\" /> In their release of the 2017 [[Nuclear Posture Review|NPR]], the Trump Administration made clear that the United States supports global nuclear weapons elimination. President [[Donald Trump]] also stated his intent to keep the US safe, as well as allies and partners. Until a time where nuclear weapons are not longer needed, the Trump Administration has also stated its intent to maintain a \"modern, flexible, and resilient\" nuclear armada. Since the height of the [[Cold War]], the US's nuclear armada has been reduced by over 85 percent. The Trump Administration acknowledges it faces a \"more diverse and advanced nuclear-threat environment than ever before.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|date=January 27, 2017|title=Nuclear Posture Review|url=https://media.defense.gov/2018/Feb/02/2001872877/-1/-1/1/EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.PDF|journal=Office of the Secretary of Defense|via=US Department of Defense}}</ref>\n\nIt is estimated that the US currently has around 475 [[B61 nuclear bomb|B-61]] and [[B83 nuclear bomb|B-83]] bombs.

By February 2015, the United States Air Force had deactivated all missiles of this type and filled the silos containing them with gravel.<ref name=\":5\" /> The U.S. Minuteman III ICBMs are spread between three Air Force bases which are [[Francis E. Warren Air Force Base]] in Wyoming, [[Malmstrom Air Force Base]] in Montana, and [[Minot Air Force Base]] in North Dakota with each of these bases in possession of 150 missiles.<ref name=\":5\" /> Multiple programs have been put into place and are currently in place to work on up-keeping and modernizing the United States ICBM force including the Propulsion Replacement Program, Guidance Replacement Program, Propulsion System Rocket Engine Program, Safety Enhanced Reentry Vehicle (SERV), Solid Rocket Motor Warm Line Program, Rapid Execution and Combat Targeting (REACT) Service Life Extension Program, and Fuse Replacement Programs. The Air Force plans to keep the Minuteman III program viable and updated through 2030 and is in the process of developing a potential replacement in the form of the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) through various companies such as [[Northrop Grumman]] and [[Lockheed Martin]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe ballistic missile submarine leg of the United States' nuclear triad is still robust. Currently, the SSBN fleet consists of 14 ''Ohio''-class submarines each capable of carrying 24 Trident II missiles.<ref name=\":5\" /> These ballistic missile submarines are based out of [[Kings Bay, Georgia|Kings Bay]], Georgia, and [[Bangor Base, Washington|Bangor]], Washington. The [[New START]] Treaty has led the United States to begin reducing the number of missiles carried on each submarine from 24 to 20 and these reductions will be reached before the end of 2018. In the early 2000s, the United States possessed 18 ''Ohio''-class submarines. Following START Treaty protocol, the United States enacted various programs to reach the treaty's requirements. The Backfit Program was utilized to eliminate the submarines that still carried [[UGM-96 Trident I|Trident I]] missiles leaving the United States with ''Ohio''-class submarines that only carried [[UGM-133 Trident II|Trident II]] missiles.<ref name=\":5\" /> This reduction led to the conversion of four [[Ballistic missile submarine|SSBN]]<nowiki/>s to [[Cruise missile submarine|SSGN]]<nowiki/>s. SSGNs are guided missile submarines which carry conventional Tomahawk cruise missiles. Currently, the United States plans to begin retiring the ''Ohio''-class submarines in 2027. That being said, a replacement for the ''Ohio'' class, the SSBN (X) variant or [[Ohio Replacement Program]], is currently being developed with plans of the first variant entering the Navy in 2031.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe strategic bomber program for the United States still remains viable as well. [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2]] and [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52H]] bombers still make up the entirety of the long range bomber force designed to deliver a nuclear payload. The [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer]] is also used for long range bombing missions. However, in 1997, it was modified to carry only conventional payloads. The B-1 Lancer is no longer used to deliver nuclear payloads. Currently, 76 B-52H bombers are maintained at bases in Barksdale, Louisiana, and Minot, North Dakota. Along with these, 20 B-2 bombers are in service at [[Whiteman Air Force Base]] in Missouri. The United States Air Force is in the process of integrating a new long range bomber, the [[Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider|B-21 Raider]], into service. This aircraft is scheduled to begin service in 2025.<ref name=\":5\" /> The B-21 will contribute to even greater capabilities for the US nuclear armada. It will allow for a larger and more diverse payload that includes current and future weapons. It will allow for increased range compared to the B-1, 2, and 52. The range capabilities of the B-21 are currently classified and are not expected to be released. The B-21 will also cost significantly less than the B-2 bomber. In 1997, the average cost of a B-2 was $737 million. The projected average cost for the B-21 Raider is $550 million per plane.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gertler|first=Jeremiah|date=June 7, 2017|title=Air Force B-21 Raider Long-Range Strike Bomber|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/R44463.pdf|journal=Congressional Research Service|volume=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nLong-Range Standoff, or [[LRSO]], Weapons are another active option available to the US. Air-Launched cruise missiles (ALCM) and Advanced Cruise Missiles (ACM) are the missiles currently maintained by the Air Force. Both are carried via the B-52 bomber. The ACM's most current design makes it have higher stealth capabilities than the ALCM. In 2006, the US had 1,142 ALCMs and 394 ACMs. Since then, the number of ALC missiles has been reduced to 528. By 2030, the Air Force plans to phase out the ALCM and replace them with the long range standoff (LRSO) cruise missile.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nWhile the US currently has strong capabilities and a vast arsenal, concerns about the age of each component of the nuclear triad are valid. The US is working to replace all legs of the nuclear triad, but budget limitations have been extremely restrictive in recent years. Using 2015 as a baseline, the ages of the current systems of the nuclear triad are 45 years for the Minuteman III, 25 years for the Trident II D-5 SLBM, 54 years for the B-52H, 18 years for the B-2, and 34 years for the ''Ohio''-class SSBNs. Compared to other nuclear superpowers, these systems are lagging far behind. During the Cold War, the US led the world in almost all categories. This is no longer the case. A recurring issue with maintaining the nuclear triad is that some manufactures who originally produced parts for some of these systems that are no longer operational. The U.S. cannot produce a solid-fuel rocket engine on its own and currently has to rely on Russia to supply these engines. If the US and Russia became at odds, this could be a major problem for the US.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=October 5, 2017|title=U.S. Nuclear Weapons Capability|url=https://www.heritage.org/military-strength/assessment-us-military-power/us-nuclear-weapons-capability|journal=An Assessment of U.S. Military Power|via=heritage.org}}</ref>\n\n==Former triad powers==\n\n===France===\nDuring the [[Cold War (1953\u20131962)|Cold War]], France obtained [[ballistic missile submarine]]s, land-based missiles, and nuclear-armed bombers.

Following withdrawals by other bidding cities during the [[2024 Summer Olympics]] bidding process that led to just two candidate cities (Los Angeles and [[Paris bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics|Paris]]), the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) announced that the [[2028 Summer Olympics]] would be awarded at the same time as 2024. After extended negotiations, Los Angeles agreed to bid for the 2028 Games if certain conditions were met. On July 31, 2017, the IOC announced Los Angeles as the sole candidate for the 2028 games, with [[US Dollar|$]]1.8 billion of additional funding to support local sports and the Games program.\n\nLos Angeles was chosen by the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) on August 28, 2015, after the [[Los Angeles City Council]] voted unanimously to back the bid. Los Angeles was the second city submitted by the USOC for the 2024 Summer Olympics. [[Boston bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics|Boston]] was originally chosen to be the American bid but withdrew on July 27, 2015. Los Angeles also originally bid for the USOC's nomination in late 2014, when Boston was chosen over Los Angeles; [[Washington, D.C.]]; and [[San Francisco]]. This was the third United States summer bid since hosting the [[Centennial Olympic Games]] (1996) in Atlanta, previously losing in 2012 and 2016 to London and Rio de Janeiro.\n\nLos Angeles previously hosted the [[1932 Summer Olympics]] and the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] and will become the third city \u2013 after London and Paris in 2024 \u2013 to host the Summer Games three times. Los Angeles will become the first American city to host the Olympic Games since the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City]].

Following withdrawals by other bidding cities during the [[2024 Summer Olympics]] bidding process that led to just two candidate cities (Los Angeles and [[Paris bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics|Paris]]), the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) announced that the [[2028 Summer Olympics]] would be awarded at the same time as 2024. After extended negotiations, Los Angeles agreed to bid for the 2028 Games if certain conditions were met. On July 31, 2017, the IOC announced Los Angeles as the sole candidate for the 2028 games, with [[US Dollar|$]]1.8 billion of additional funding to support local sports and the Games program.\n\nLos Angeles was chosen by the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) on August 28, 2015, after the [[Los Angeles City Council]] voted unanimously to back the bid. Los Angeles was the second city submitted by the USOC for the 2024 Summer Olympics. [[Boston bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics|Boston]] was originally chosen to be the American bid but withdrew on July 27, 2015. Los Angeles also originally bid for the USOC's nomination in late 2014, when Boston was chosen over Los Angeles, [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[San Francisco]]. This was the third United States summer bid since hosting the [[Centennial Olympic Games]] (1996) in Atlanta, previously losing in 2012 and 2016 to London and Rio de Janeiro.\n\nLos Angeles previously hosted the [[1932 Summer Olympics]] and the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] and will become the third city \u2013 after London and Paris in 2024 \u2013 to host the Summer Games three times.
