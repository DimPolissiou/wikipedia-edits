The Hawkeyes played their home games at [[Kinnick Stadium]] in [[Iowa City, Iowa]] and competed in the West Division of the [[Big Ten Conference]]. They were led by [[Kirk Ferentz]] in his 20th season as head coach.\n\nIowa began the year with six wins in their first seven games, with their sole loss during that span coming in their conference opener against [[2018 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]]. The Hawkeyes rose to 18th in the [[AP Poll]], but lost three consecutive games to knock them from the polls. They ended the regular season with two more wins to finish tied for second in the West Division with a conference record of 5\u20134. They were invited to the [[2019 Outback Bowl]], where they defeated [[2018 Mississippi State Bulldogs football team|Mississippi State]]. Iowa finished with a record of 9\u20134 and were ranked 25th in the final AP Poll, their first ranked finish and highest win total since [[2015 Iowa Hawkeyes football team|2015]].\n\nQuarterback [[Nate Stanley]] led the team in passing with 2,852 yards and 26 touchdowns, good for second in the Big Ten Conference in the latter category. The Hawkeyes featured two standout [[tight end]]s, with [[Noah Fant]] and [[T. J. Hockenson]] both earning [[2018 All-Big Ten Conference football team|first-team all-conference honors]]. Hockenson was awarded the [[John Mackey Award]] as the nation's top tight end. Iowa became the first school to have two tight ends chosen in the first round of an NFL Draft when Hockenson and Fant both were both selected in the first 20 picks of the [[2019 NFL Draft]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apnews.com/59a5c3b1d3174f3893ed256167c3ad1a|title=2 Iowa tight ends likely to go in 1st round of NFL draft|first=Barry|last=Wilner|date=April 24, 2019|work=Associated Press}}</ref> Defensive end [[A.

The win was the 144th for head coach Kirk Ferentz, making him the all-time winningest coach in Iowa football history. After an opening drive 3 and out for the Hawkeyes, NIU blocked the punt and had the ball at the Iowa 20. However, a missed field goal swung momentum back to the home team. The only first half points came on a 33-yard field goal from Hawkeye kicker Miguel Recinos. After a slow 3rd quarter, Heisman hopeful Nate Stanley threw his first touchdown of the year, a 1-yard pitch-and-catch to tight end Noah Fant. On the ensuing drive, running back Ivory Kelly-Martin barreled in on a 3rd and goal play to make it 17\u20130 going into the 4th quarter. After another short field, Toren Young found pay dirt on a 6-yard effort, and it was 24\u20130 Iowa. After a great punt by Colton Rastetter, NIU got the ball inside their own 1 yard line. on 2nd down, the Hawkeyes forced a safety, and after getting the ball back off the safety punt, backup quarterback Peyton Mansell got his first career touchdown on a quarterback sneak. After Iowa put their 2nd team defense in, the Huskies marched down the field in an impressive 11 play, 75 yard drive to put some late points on the scoreboard. Iowa shook off the slow 1st half and routed NIU 33\u20137 inside of Kinnick Stadium during the annual Gold Game.\n\n<ref>{{cite web | publisher=[[Iowa Hawkeyes|University of Iowa Athletics]] | title=Game Notes: Iowa vs. Northern Illinois | url=https://hawkeyesports.com/news/2018/8/24/football-game-notes-iowa-vs-northern-illinois.aspx | date=August 27, 2018 | access-date=September 1, 2018 }}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web | publisher=[[Athlon Media Group|Athlon Sports]] | title=Northern Illinois Huskies vs. Iowa Hawkeyes Prediction and Preview | url=https://athlonsports.com/college-football/northern-illinois-huskies-vs-iowa-hawkeyes-prediction-picks-2018 | date=August 30, 2018 | access-date=August 31, 2018 }}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web |title=Kirk Ferentz passes Fry, Iowa rolls past NIU 33\u20137 |url=https://collegefootball.ap.org/article/kirk-ferentz-passes-fry-iowa-rolls-past-niu-33-7-0 |work=[[Associated Press]]|date=September 1, 2018 |accessdate=September 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Iowa State===\n{{see also|2018 Iowa State Cyclones football team}}\n{{AFB game box start\n| Title = '''Iowa State at Iowa'''<br><small>[[Iowa\u2013Iowa State football rivalry|Cy-Hawk Trophy]]</small>\n| Visitor = Cyclones\n| V1=3 |V2=0 |V3=0 |V4=0\n| Host = '''Hawkeyes'''\n| H1=0 |H2=3 |H3=3 |H4=7\n| Date = September 8\n| Location = <br>[[Kinnick Stadium]]<br>[[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City, IA]]\n| StartTime = 4:00 p.m.\n| TimeZone = CDT\n| ElapsedTime = 3:12\n| Attendance = 69,250\n| Weather = 69\u00b0 F, Partly Sunny, Wind 5\u201310 MPH\n| Referee = Cooper Castleberry\n| TVAnnouncers = [[Tim Brando]], [[Spencer Tillman]], and Holly Sonders\n| TVStation = [[Fox College Football|FOX]]\n}}\n*'''Source''': [http://hawkeyesports.com/boxscore.aspx?id=12306 Box Score]\n{{AFB game box scoring entry |FirstEntry=yes|Quarter=1 |Time=6:42 |Team=ISU |Event=C.

The Hawkeyes played their home games at [[Kinnick Stadium]] in [[Iowa City, Iowa]] and competed in the West Division of the [[Big Ten Conference]]. They were led by [[Kirk Ferentz]] in his 20th season as head coach.\n\nIowa began the year with six wins in their first seven games, with their sole loss during that span coming in their conference opener against [[2018 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]]. The Hawkeyes rose to 18th in the [[AP Poll]], but lost three consecutive games to knock them from the polls. They ended the regular season with two more wins to finish tied for second in the West Division with a conference record of 5\u20134. They were invited to the [[2019 Outback Bowl]], where they defeated [[2018 Mississippi State Bulldogs football team|Mississippi State]]. Iowa finished with a record of 9\u20134 and were ranked 25th in the final AP Poll, their first ranked finish and highest win total since [[2015 Iowa Hawkeyes football team|2015]].\n\nQuarterback [[Nate Stanley]] led the team in passing with 2,852 yards and 26 touchdowns, good for second in the Big Ten Conference in the latter category. The Hawkeyes featured two standout [[tight end]]s, with [[Noah Fant]] and [[T. J. Hockenson]] both earning [[2018 All-Big Ten Conference football team|first-team all-conference honors]]. Hockenson was awarded the [[John Mackey Award]] as the nation's top tight end. Iowa became the first school to have two tight ends chosen in the first round of an NFL Draft when Hockenson and Fant both were both selected in the first 20 picks of the [[2019 NFL Draft]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apnews.com/59a5c3b1d3174f3893ed256167c3ad1a|title=2 Iowa tight ends likely to go in 1st round of NFL draft|first=Barry|last=Wilner|date=April 24, 2019|work=Associated Press}}</ref> Defensive end [[A.

The win was the 144th for head coach Kirk Ferentz, making him the all-time winningest coach in Iowa football history. After an opening drive 3 and out for the Hawkeyes, NIU blocked the punt and had the ball at the Iowa 20. However, a missed field goal swung momentum back to the home team. The only first half points came on a 33-yard field goal from Hawkeye kicker Miguel Recinos. After a slow 3rd quarter, Heisman hopeful Nate Stanley threw his first touchdown of the year, a 1-yard pitch-and-catch to tight end Noah Fant. On the ensuing drive, running back Ivory Kelly-Martin barreled in on a 3rd and goal play to make it 17\u20130 going into the 4th quarter. After another short field, Toren Young found pay dirt on a 6-yard effort, and it was 24\u20130 Iowa.

He has a penchant for exaggeration when he is not telling outright lies, and publicly humiliates his long-suffering wife Kim with his shameless flirting with various women and an affair with Beaty, a friend of the family. \n\nAt other times, he seems genuinely interested in bonding with his son, taking him camping so they can test supposedly waterproof sleeping bags he has made or allowing him to practise driving in the family's [[Alvis Cars|Alvis]] convertible on a wide expanse of deserted beach with reckless abandon. As a result, Blake is left with mixed feelings for his father, ranging from deeply rooted anger to compassionate acceptance.

It is usually from an investment bank to its clients directly. [[Forward contract|Forwards]] and [[Swap (finance)|swaps]] are prime examples of such contracts. It is mostly done online or by telephone. For [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]], these agreements are usually governed by an [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association]] agreement.

In 2000 the authors acknowledged that the growth in OTC transactions \"in many ways made possible, the modernization of commercial and investment banking and the globalization of finance.\"{{Sfn|Schinasi|Craig|Drees|Kramer|2001|pages=5\u20137}} However, in September, an IMF team led by Mathieson and Schinasi cautioned that \"episodes of turbulence\" in the late 1990s \"revealed the risks posed to market stability originated in features of OTC derivatives instruments and markets.{{Sfn|Mathieson|Schinasi|2000|page=3}}\n\nThe [[NYMEX]] has created a clearing mechanism for a slate of commonly traded OTC energy derivatives which allows counterparties of many bilateral OTC transactions to mutually agree to transfer the trade to ClearPort, the exchange's clearing house, thus eliminating credit and performance risk of the initial OTC transaction counterparts.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Collateral management]]\n*[[Dark liquidity]]\n*[[Delta One]]\n*[[London Platinum and Palladium Market]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=Notes}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{citation|work=Bank for International Settlements (BIS) |url=http://www.bis.org/publ/otc_hy1311.pdf |title=Statistical release: OTC derivatives statistics at end June 2013 |author=Monetary and Economic Department |date=November 2013 |accessdate=12 April 2014 |ref={{SfnRef|Bank for International Settlements (BIS)|2013}}}} \n* {{citation |url=http://www.bettertrades.org/companies/walmart-ticker-wmt.asp|title=WMT Overview |accessdate=12 April 2014 |date=2012 |work= Better Trades |ref={{SfnRef|Better Trades|2012}}}}\n* {{citation |url=http://www.isda.org/c_and_a/pdf/Collateral-Market-Review.pdf |title=Market Review of OTC Derivative Bilateral Collateralization Practices |work=International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) |accessdate=12 April 2014 |date=1 March 2010 |ref={{SfnRef|International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA)|2010}}}}\n* {{citation |title=OTC Derivatives Market Analysis, Year-End 2010 |work=ISDA |date= 26 May 2011 |ref={{SfnRef|ISDA|2011}}}}\n* {{citation |title=OTC Derivatives Market Analysis, Year-End 2012 |work=ISDA |date=June 2013 |ref={{SfnRef|ISDA|2013}}}}\n* {{citation |first=Jon |last=Gregory |title=Counterparty Credit Risk: The new challenge for global financial markets |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |pages=448 |isbn=978-0-470-68576-1 |date=7 September 2011 |ref={{SfnRef|Gregory|2011}}}}\n* {{citation |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/icm/2000/01/eng/pdf/chap1.pdf |series=World Economic and Financial Surveys |title=International Capital Markets: Developments, Prospects, and Key Policy Issues |first1=Donald J. |last1=Mathieson |first2=Garry J. |last2=Schinasi |date=September 2000 |ref={{SfnRef|Mathieson|Schinasi|2000}}}}\n* {{citation |title=Dark markets may be more harmful than high-frequency trading |first=John |last=McCrank |location=New York |publisher=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/06/us-dark-markets-analysis-idUSBREA3508V20140406|date=6 April 2014 |accessdate=12 April 2014 |ref={{SfnRef|McCrank|2014}}}}\n* {{citation |first1=Garry J. |last1=Schinasi |first2=R.

Toronto agreed to play a best of 5 series against the [[Victoria Aristocrats]] of the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]]. A controversy erupted when a letter arrived from the Stanley Cup trustees on March 17, stating that the trustees would not let the Stanley Cup travel west, as they did not consider Victoria a proper challenger because they had not formally notified the trustees.<ref>{{cite news\n |work=Saskatoon Phoenix |title=Stanley Cup Contest May Not Be for the Mug, After All is Said |date=March 18, 1914 |page=8}}</ref> However, on March 18, Trustee [[William Foran]] stated that it was a misunderstanding. PCHA president [[Frank Patrick (ice hockey)|Frank Patrick]] had not filed a challenge, because he had expected [[Emmett Quinn]] of the NHA to make all of the arrangements in his role as hockey commissioner, whereas the trustees thought they were being deliberately ignored.

The second game was seven-man hockey, played under PCHA rules, which also meant dividing up the ice into three zones, with the centre zone open to \"off-side\" passing. Toronto led 3\u20132 after the first period. [[Lester Patrick]] scored twice and [[Tommy Dunderdale]] scored in the second to give Victoria a 5\u20133 lead after two periods. [[Frank Foyston]] scored twice in the third to tie the score, sending it to overtime.

The Victoria forwards back-checked well and reduced the shooting opportunities of Toronto. The game had a lot of rough play, and \"the man with the puck was generally sent sprawling before he had a chance to shoot,\" according to ''The Globe.'' The Victoria forwards played a good game bringing many shots against Toronto's [[Hap Holmes|Harry Holmes]] in net. Victoria's Patrick injured his wrist in the second period and could not shoot after that. Davidson and [[Bobby Genge]] started a fight at 15 minutes of the third period, clearing the benches. Foyston scored for Toronto in the second period, and Cameron scored in the third to score the winning goal.

It was also the final series of the \"challenge\" era, where inter-league series for the Stanley Cup were sanctioned by the Stanley Cup trustees.

After dispatching the Canadiens, the Blue Shirts series with Sydeny was cancelled. Toronto agreed to play a best of 5 series against the [[Victoria Aristocrats]] of the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]]. A controversy erupted when a letter arrived from the Stanley Cup trustees on March 17, stating that the trustees would not let the Stanley Cup travel west, as they did not consider Victoria a proper challenger because they had not formally notified the trustees.<ref>{{cite news\n |work=Saskatoon Phoenix |title=Stanley Cup Contest May Not Be for the Mug, After All is Said |date=March 18, 1914 |page=8}}</ref> However, on March 18, Trustee [[William Foran]] stated that it was a misunderstanding. PCHA president [[Frank Patrick (ice hockey)|Frank Patrick]] had not filed a challenge, because he had expected [[Emmett Quinn]] of the NHA to make all of the arrangements in his role as hockey commissioner, whereas the trustees thought they were being deliberately ignored. In any case, all arrangements had been ironed out and the series was accepted.<ref>{{cite news |work=Montreal Daily Mail |date=March 19, 1914 |title=A Tempest In a Teapot |page=9}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |work=Toronto Globe and Mail |title=Stanley Cup Muddle Cleared Up |date=March 19, 1914 |page=}}</ref>\n\nSeveral days later, Foran wrote to Quinn that the trustees are \"perfectly satisfied to allow the representatives of the three pro leagues (NHA, PCHA and Maritime) to make all arrangements each season as to the series of matches to be played for the Cup.\"<ref>{{cite news |work=Toronto World\n |title=Three Pro Leagues as to Stanley Cup |date=March 25, 1914 |page=8}}</ref>\n\n==Game summaries==\n\nThe first game, the first Stanley Cup game in Toronto, was played under NHA rules. Toronto won 5\u20132 as the \"Coast Champions Did Not Show Expected Form\" according to the ''Toronto Globe''. Victoria had too much individual play and not enough \"team play and combination work.\"<ref>{{cite news \n |work=The Globe |date=March 16, 1914 |title=First Stanley Cup Game for Torontos |page=12}}</ref>\n\n[[Scotty Davidson]], Toronto's captain, sat out the second game due to the flu. The second game was seven-man hockey, played under PCHA rules, which also meant dividing up the ice into three zones, with the centre zone open to \"off-side\" passing. Toronto led 3\u20132 after the first period. [[Lester Patrick]] scored twice and [[Tommy Dunderdale]] scored in the second to give Victoria a 5\u20133 lead after two periods. [[Frank Foyston]] scored twice in the third to tie the score, sending it to overtime. McGiffin scored the winning goal after 18 minutes of overtime.<ref>{{cite news |work=The Globe |date=March 18, 1914 |title=Victoria Beaten at Their Own Style |page=14}}</ref>\n\nDavidson returned for the third game as a substitute for [[Cully Wilson]]. The Victoria forwards back-checked well and reduced the shooting opportunities of Toronto. The game had a lot of rough play, and \"the man with the puck was generally sent sprawling before he had a chance to shoot,\" according to ''The Globe.'' The Victoria forwards played a good game bringing many shots against Toronto's [[Hap Holmes|Harry Holmes]] in net. Victoria's Patrick injured his wrist in the second period and could not shoot after that. Davidson and [[Bobby Genge]] started a fight at 15 minutes of the third period, clearing the benches. Foyston scored for Toronto in the second period, and Cameron scored in the third to score the winning goal. Victoria's [[Dubby Kerr]] scored with seven minutes to go, but Victoria was not able to get an equalizer.<ref>{{cite news |work=The Globe\n |date=March 20, 1914 |title=Stanley Cup Will Come To Toronto |page=12}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=\"120\" | Date\n! width=\"140\" | Winning Team\n! width=\"10\" | Score\n! width=\"140\" | Losing Team\n!

Two of the gates, E73 and E75, can accommodate the [[Airbus A380]].\n\nAlong with the standard customs and immigration facilities, Terminal 1 also contains special customs \"B\" checkpoints along the international arrivals walkway. Passengers connecting from an international or trans-border arrival to another international (non-U.S.) departure in Terminal 1 go to one of these checkpoints for passport control and immigration checks, then are immediately directed to Pier E for departure.
