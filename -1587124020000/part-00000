The [[Government of India]] initially refused to allow these visits without giving a reason.

OTD expressed how the Karma Kamtsang forefathers and disciples maintained and propagated the teachings through study, teaching, and practice; thus, ripened generations of disciples through their wisdom, love, and power. OTD related that this activity of ''ripening'' disciples is the essential heart of the Kagyu history, the majesty and the true weight of the Kagyu teachings. He said that we need to continue to uphold the Lineage by preserving these fine deeds and activities. However, OTD warned, if we instead spend most of our time being biased, factional, and partisan\u2014this is extremely dangerous. If we are partisan and factional, we won't see the faults on our own side, or the qualities on the other. We won't be able to recognize what is good and what is bad. OTD said: \"For that reason, it is a situation where we absolutely must be careful. So this is why I asked His Holiness Thaye Dorje for a meeting this year.\" Furthermore, OTD emphasized that whether reconciliation goes well or not does not depend upon only the two claimants, OTD and TTD. It depends on all the followers and the whole community of the Karma Kamtsang.\n\nIn addition, OTD implored everyone to take as expansive a view as possible, to consider the long-term survival of the Karma Kagyu lineage. He said that those with a very short-term view may think that it was pointless for him to meet with TTD. Likewise, some people might think that OTD, by meeting with TTD, ended up losing\u2014that he was defeated. But he said that victory and defeat is a very short-term worldly way of speaking, and that the long-term danger is that the lineage of the Karma Kagyu will disappear without a trace. Considering this grave danger, OTD said that losing face, victory and defeat, are really not important. In conclusion, OTD requested everyone to please keep this explanation in mind.\n\n=== 2019: Joint Long Life Prayer for Kunzig Shamar Rinpoche\u2019s Reincarnation ===\nOn Oct. 27, 2019 OTD and TTD released a co-authored long life prayer for Kunzig Shamar Rinpoche\u2019s reincarnation.

Tibetan language is the lifeline that links Tibetans to their culture, arts, and spirituality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kagyuoffice.org/the-gyalwang-karmapa-rings-an-alarm-we-must-preserve-tibetan-language-and-culture/|title=The Gyalwang Karmapa Rings an Alarm: We Must Preserve Tibetan Language and Culture {{!}} Karmapa \u2013 The Official Website of the 17th Karmapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kagyuoffice.org/the-importance-of-harmony-among-tibetans/|title=The Importance of Harmony among Tibetans {{!}} Karmapa \u2013 The Official Website of the 17th Karmapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kagyuoffice.org/a-wide-ranging-interview-with-the-gyalwang-karmapa/|title=A Wide-Ranging Interview with the Gyalwang Karmapa {{!}} Karmapa \u2013 The Official Website of the 17th Karmapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref> Tibetan culture, he states, is the mind and life force of the Tibetan people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kagyuoffice.org/language-as-the-link-unity-as-the-future-the-gyalwang-karmapa-speaks-at-the-56th-anniversary-of-the-upper-tcv/|title=Language as the Link, Unity as the Future: The Gyalwang Karmapa Speaks at the 56th Anniversary of the Upper TCV {{!}} Karmapa \u2013 The Official Website of the 17th Karmapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n\nStressing the importance of Tibetan harmony and unity, Gyalwang Karmapa has implored all Tibetans to exercise religious tolerance, stating that all Buddhist traditions in Tibet come from one source, the Buddha, so the differences between them are not great. He has warned that it is a huge mistake to inflate small distinctions into a basis for attachment and hatred, asserting one\u2019s own tradition to be better than another\u2019s. He has said that the reason for any future decline of the Buddha\u2019s Dharma would not come from outside, but from within, from disputes between the holders of his teachings. Therefore, Gyalwang Karmapa has reiterated time and time again that the differences between lineages and factions are minor in terms of view, meditation, and conduct, and has urged everyone to keep a broader non-partisan perspective in mind.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kagyuoffice.org/tibetan-unity-and-language-are-crucial/|title=Tibetan Unity and Language Are Crucial {{!}} Karmapa \u2013 The Official Website of the 17th Karmapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n\n=== 108 Translations ===\n108 Translations was initiated in 2015 by H.H. Karmapa Orgyen Trinley Dorje. Born of a concept developed during a translators\u2019 workshop held at [http://latse.org Latse] and presided over by Gyalwang Karmapa, the aim of the 108 Translations project is to produce a needed body of reading material that can promote the reinvigoration of Tibetan language. Rather than focussing on translating a few famous works that match the interests of a small group of well-educated readers (which has been the case for translations into Tibetan up to the present), 108 Translations aims to provide a plethora of good and easily accessible reading materials for ''average'' Tibetan readers.\n\nIn his [https://dharmaebooks.org/108-translations/ Statement of Purpose], Gyalwang Karmapa expressed that we are currently inhabiting a time where there is great concern that the Tibetan language will go extinct. He has said that we have come to the point where we need to take responsibility for the survival of the Tibetan language, and we are in a situation where there is very little reading material that matches the interests of the ordinary Tibetan reader.\n\nThe main criteria for the 108 Translations is that they don't lose the meaning and feeling (or \"flavour\") of the original, the translations must be easy to understand and pronounce in Tibetan, and the selected works need to meet the interests of the readership. For example, translations of famous literary works that have a low readership are examples of unsuccessful translations. 108 Translations must not only consider how well known the works are, they must also examine how they have sold, how many other languages they have been translated into, and so forth. Works with low sales are not selected, even if they are renowned. Over time, the hope is that future translations will grow ever closer to the interests of the readership.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dharmaebooks.org/108-translations/|title=A Statement of Purpose|last=|first=|date=|website=dharmaebooks.org|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n\n108 Translations aims to nurture literacy in the Tibetan language, while giving Tibetan readers greater access to world literature.

Chokyi Lodro]], 14th [[Shamarpa]] (the second-longest recognized tulku lineage in the Karma Kagyu tradition, and who in previous incarnations has held and transmitted the Kagyu lineage between Karmapas), did not recognize Ogyen Trinley Dorje and instead proclaimed [[Trinley Thaye Dorje]] ({{bo|w=Mtha'-yas Rdo-rje}}), whom he purportedly identified a few years earlier than the recognition of Orgyen Thrinley Dorje in a dream as the true Karmapa. Shamarpas camp argue that until the reincarnation line of the Shamarpas was forbidden by the government of the Dalai Lama,<ref>see: [[Shamarpa#Controversy]]</ref> the successive Shamarpas were the persons in charge to recognize the Karmapas, whereas the [[Dalai Lama]]s played no role in the recognition.<ref>[https://karmapaissue.wordpress.com/affirmation-of-prof-samuel-geoffrey-concerning-the-historical-role-of-the-dalai-lamas-in-recognizing-the-karmapas/ Prof. Geoffrey Brian Samuel in: \u201cAffirmation of Geoffrey Brian Samuel,\u201d Lama vs. Hope and Ors, CIV-2004404-001363, High Court of New Zealand Auckland Registry, 11 November 2004].</ref>\n\nMany of the previous Karmapas have left a letter stating the details of their rebirth (this is an aspect of the special self-recognizing [[siddhi]] of the Karmapas) to assist in the recognition of their future incarnation, and thus the Shamarpa's recognition through a dream has come under scrutiny. On the other side Shamarpa questioned the authenticity of the \"prophecy letter\" which the 16th Karmapa allegedly had written and asked Situ Rinpoche for a forensic test of the letter, which Situ Rinpoche refused.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://karmapaissue.wordpress.com/2015/03/10/the-letter-of-prediction/ |title = The \"letter of prediction\"|date = 10 March 2015}}</ref> Ogyen Trinley Dorje is supported by the majority of the Kagyu hierarchy,<ref>{{cite news |title=Tibetan Lama Faces Scrutiny and Suspicion in India |first=Jim |last=Yardley |authorlink=Jim Yardley |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/world/asia/08tibet.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=New York Times |date=2011-02-08 |accessdate=2011-02-08 |quote=After the death of the previous Karmapa, a bitter feud broke out between the high lamas charged with identifying his successor: at least two other people now claim to be the Karmapa, though a majority of Tibetans, including the Dalai Lama, recognize Ogyen Trinley Dorje. |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wM5g7lzg?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/world/asia/08tibet.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all |archivedate=2011-02-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> including two lamas who have played a role in finding previous Karmapas: [[Tai Situpa]] and [[Goshir Gyaltsab]].

OTD expressed how the Karma Kamtsang forefathers and disciples maintained and propagated the teachings through study, teaching, and practice; thus, ripened generations of disciples through their wisdom, love, and power. OTD related that this activity of ''ripening'' disciples is the essential heart of the Kagyu history, the majesty and the true weight of the Kagyu teachings. He said that we need to continue to uphold the Lineage by preserving these fine deeds and activities. However, OTD warned, if we instead spend most of our time being biased, factional, and partisan\u2014this is extremely dangerous. If we are partisan and factional, we won't see the faults on our own side, or the qualities on the other. We won't be able to recognize what is good and what is bad. OTD said: \"For that reason, it is a situation where we absolutely must be careful. So this is why I asked His Holiness Thaye Dorje for a meeting this year.\" Furthermore, OTD emphasized that whether reconciliation goes well or not does not depend upon only the two claimants, OTD and TTD. It depends on all the followers and the whole community of the Karma Kamtsang.\n\nIn addition, OTD implored everyone to take as expansive a view as possible, to consider the long-term survival of the Karma Kagyu lineage. He said that those with a very short-term view may think that it was pointless for him to meet with TTD. Likewise, some people might think that OTD, by meeting with TTD, ended up losing\u2014that he was defeated. But he said that victory and defeat is a very short-term worldly way of speaking, and that the long-term danger is that the lineage of the Karma Kagyu will disappear without a trace. Considering this grave danger, OTD said that losing face, victory and defeat, are really not important. In conclusion, OTD requested everyone to please keep this explanation in mind.\n\n=== 2019: Joint Long Life Prayer for Kunzig Shamar Rinpoche\u2019s Reincarnation ===\nOn Oct. 27, 2019 OTD and TTD released a co-authored long life prayer for Kunzig Shamar Rinpoche\u2019s reincarnation.

He has warned that it is a huge mistake to inflate small distinctions into a basis for attachment and hatred, asserting one\u2019s own tradition to be better than another\u2019s. He has said that the reason for any future decline of the Buddha\u2019s Dharma would not come from outside, but from within, from disputes between the holders of his teachings. Therefore, Gyalwang Karmapa has reiterated time and time again that the differences between lineages and factions are minor in terms of view, meditation, and conduct, and has urged everyone to keep a broader non-partisan perspective in mind.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kagyuoffice.org/tibetan-unity-and-language-are-crucial/|title=Tibetan Unity and Language Are Crucial {{!}} Karmapa \u2013 The Official Website of the 17th Karmapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n\n=== 108 Translations ===\n108 Translations was initiated in 2015 by H.H. Karmapa Orgyen Trinley Dorje. Born of a concept developed during a translators\u2019 workshop held at [http://latse.org Latse] and presided over by Gyalwang Karmapa, the aim of the 108 Translations project is to produce a needed body of reading material that can promote the reinvigoration of Tibetan language. Rather than focussing on translating a few famous works that match the interests of a small group of well-educated readers (which has been the case for translations into Tibetan up to the present), 108 Translations aims to provide a plethora of good and easily accessible reading materials for ''average'' Tibetan readers.\n\nIn his [https://dharmaebooks.org/108-translations/ Statement of Purpose], Gyalwang Karmapa expressed that we are currently inhabiting a time where there is great concern that the Tibetan language will go extinct. He has said that we have come to the point where we need to take responsibility for the survival of the Tibetan language, and we are in a situation where there is very little reading material that matches the interests of the ordinary Tibetan reader.\n\nThe main criteria for the 108 Translations is that they don't lose the meaning and feeling (or \"flavour\") of the original, the translations must be easy to understand and pronounce in Tibetan, and the selected works need to meet the interests of the readership. For example, translations of famous literary works that have a low readership are examples of unsuccessful translations. 108 Translations must not only consider how well known the works are, they must also examine how they have sold, how many other languages they have been translated into, and so forth. Works with low sales are not selected, even if they are renowned. Over time, the hope is that future translations will grow ever closer to the interests of the readership.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dharmaebooks.org/108-translations/|title=A Statement of Purpose|last=|first=|date=|website=dharmaebooks.org|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n\n108 Translations aims to nurture literacy in the Tibetan language, while giving Tibetan readers greater access to world literature. It is a project of Latse and is managed by the 108 Translations Management Team, whose combined skills and experience ensure the highest quality of translation. This project is also generously supported by [https://dharma-treasure.org Dharma Treasure] and the ebooks will be published on [https://dharmaebooks.org/ dharmaebooks.org] as well [http://latse.org/program/108-translations latse.org/program/108-translations].\n\n== Supporting the Female Buddhist Community ==\nThe Karmapa has, for many years, taken a deep interest in the welfare of the female Buddhist community, as well as being a voice that regularly encourages equal rights and opportunities for women practitioners. He has, in particular, taken the responsibility to restore full ordination for Tibetan nuns.\n\nEach year the Karmapa also hosts the [https://www.facebook.com/AryaKshema/ Arya Kshema] dharma winter gathering where nuns receive special teachings, instructions and gather to debate Buddhist philosophy so as to further increase their opportunities for a traditional education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kagyuoffice.org/portfolio-item/nuns-ordination/|title=The Female Buddhist Community {{!}} Karmapa \u2013 The Official Website of the 17th Karmapa|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-30}}</ref>\n\n=== 2013: Preliminary Discussions on Restoring Nuns\u2019 Ordination===\n\nOn September 14, 2013, at the International Buddhist Confederation in New Delhi, Gyalwang Karmapa participated in a discussions with the Full Nun\u2019s Ordination Working Group, joining Co-Chairs Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo, Abbess of Dongyu Gatsal Ling Nunnery in India, and Ven.

Chokyi Lodro]], 14th [[Shamarpa]] (the second-longest recognized tulku lineage in the Karma Kagyu tradition, and who in previous incarnations has held and transmitted the Kagyu lineage between Karmapas), did not recognize Ogyen Trinley Dorje and instead proclaimed [[Trinley Thaye Dorje]] ({{bo|w=Mtha'-yas Rdo-rje}}), whom he purportedly identified a few years earlier than the recognition of Orgyen Thrinley Dorje in a dream as the true Karmapa. Shamarpas camp argue that until the reincarnation line of the Shamarpas was forbidden by the government of the Dalai Lama,<ref>see: [[Shamarpa#Controversy]]</ref> the successive Shamarpas were the persons in charge to recognize the Karmapas, whereas the [[Dalai Lama]]s played no role in the recognition.<ref>[https://karmapaissue.wordpress.com/affirmation-of-prof-samuel-geoffrey-concerning-the-historical-role-of-the-dalai-lamas-in-recognizing-the-karmapas/ Prof. Geoffrey Brian Samuel in: \u201cAffirmation of Geoffrey Brian Samuel,\u201d Lama vs. Hope and Ors, CIV-2004404-001363, High Court of New Zealand Auckland Registry, 11 November 2004].</ref>\n\nMany of the previous Karmapas have left a letter stating the details of their rebirth (this is an aspect of the special self-recognizing [[siddhi]] of the Karmapas) to assist in the recognition of their future incarnation, and thus the Shamarpa's recognition through a dream has come under scrutiny. On the other side Shamarpa questioned the authenticity of the \"prophecy letter\" which the 16th Karmapa allegedly had written and asked Situ Rinpoche for a forensic test of the letter, which Situ Rinpoche refused.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://karmapaissue.wordpress.com/2015/03/10/the-letter-of-prediction/ |title = The \"letter of prediction\"|date = 10 March 2015}}</ref> Ogyen Trinley Dorje is supported by the majority of the Kagyu hierarchy,<ref>{{cite news |title=Tibetan Lama Faces Scrutiny and Suspicion in India |first=Jim |last=Yardley |authorlink=Jim Yardley |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/world/asia/08tibet.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=New York Times |date=2011-02-08 |accessdate=2011-02-08 |quote=After the death of the previous Karmapa, a bitter feud broke out between the high lamas charged with identifying his successor: at least two other people now claim to be the Karmapa, though a majority of Tibetans, including the Dalai Lama, recognize Ogyen Trinley Dorje. |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wM5g7lzg?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/world/asia/08tibet.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all |archivedate=2011-02-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref> including two lamas who have played a role in finding previous Karmapas: [[Tai Situpa]] and [[Goshir Gyaltsab]].

Hou Fangyu, one of the Society's members, falls in love with courtesan [[Li Xiangjun]] beside the [[Qinhuai River]]. He sends Li Xiangjun a fan as a gift and becomes engaged to her. An official called [[Ruan Dacheng]], delivers trousseau through celebrity Yang Longyou (T: [[:zh:\u694a\u9f8d\u53cb|\u694a\u9f8d\u53cb]], S: [[:zh:\u694a\u9f8d\u53cb|\u6768\u9f99\u53cb]], P: ''Y\u00e1ng L\u00f3ngy\u01d2u'', W: ''Yang Lung-yu'') for Hou in order not to be isolated from the royal court. Hou is persuaded into accepting it, but Li Xiangjun rejects the gift firmly, which wins Hou Fangyu's respect.\n\nBecause he lacks military provisions, the commander of [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] Zuo Liangyu intends to move his army south to Nanjing, which terrifies the court. Considering Hou Fangyu's father had once been Zuo Liangyu's superior, Nanjing officials send Yang to ask Hou for help as a substitute. Hou Fangyu writes a letter to discourage Zuo from moving, but is slandered by Ruan for betraying the country, forcing him to find shelter with [[Shi Kefa]] in [[Yangzhou]]. Li Xiangjun and Hou Fangyu are separated.\n\nAt that time, the political situation runs out of control. News comes that [[Li Zicheng]], the leader of peasant rebellion, had captured the capital Beijing, and that the [[Chongzhen Emperor]] had hanged himself. Ruan and Ma Shiying, the local governor of Fengyang (\u9cf3\u967d\u7763\u64ab), crowns the Prince of Fu (\u798f\u738b) [[Zhu Yousong]] as new Emperor and changes the title of the reign into Hongguang \u5f18\u5149. They persecute Reformists and indulge the Emperor with lust. Governor of Cao (\u66f9\u64ab) Tian Yang (\u7530\u4ef0) covets Li's beauty and wants to take her as concubine. At the marriage ceremony, Li resists with a suicide attempt. She knocks her head on a pillar, leaving blood spots on the fan which was given by Hou Fangyu. After that, Yang draws a branch of peach blossoms with Li Xiangjun's blood on the fan, and it is sent to Hou Fangyu to show Li Xiangjun's determination. Jin Fu, author of ''Chinese Theatre'', wrote that the fan and poem symbolize the integrity and determination of Li Xiangjun.<ref name=FuJinp59>Fu, Jin, p.

However, the internal conflicts among four generals, who are in charge of strategic posts in north of the Yangtze River, are fierce, and Shi Kefa himself could not retrieve the defeat. Meanwhile, the new Emperor never cares about politics, only losing himself in song and dance. Ma Shiying and Ruan Dacheng send Li into the court as a gift, catering to the Emperor. Li Xiangjun scolds the evil officials to their faces and is beaten cruelly. Hou Fangyu flees to Nanjing during the chaotic war but was caught and sent into prison by Ruan Dacheng.\n\nYangzhou falls and Shi Kefa drowns himself into the river. The new Emperor is captured by the Qing army.<ref name=Niup112>{{harvnb|Niu|2004|p=112}}.</ref> The end of the play features a Taoist ceremony mourning the loss of the Ming dynasty. The remaining protagonists decide to seclude themselves instead of serving in the Qing dynasty.<ref name=Actonpxvii/> Hou Fangyu and Li Xiangjun meet each other occasionally at [[Qixia Mountain]]. When they are telling their affection, Zhang Yaoxing, a Taoist master, criticized them for the affair, asking \"How laughable to cling to your amorous desires when the world has been turned upside down?\"<ref>K'ung, p.

Birch wrote that the Hou Fangyu-Fragrant Princess love affair \"is brilliantly integrated with the more weighty matter of the plot\" and that the martial scenes \"perfectly reflect the unhappy progress of the Ming cause and depict in vivid terms the gallant but ultimately futile loyalty or generals like Huang Te-kung and Shih-K'o-fa.\"<ref name=Actonpxvii/>\n\n==Characters==\n[[File:Portrait of Li Xiangjun (\u674e\u9999\u541b) by Cui He.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of Li Xiangjun'' by Cui He, circa 1800\u20131850 ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]])]]\nThe play involves 30 ''[[dramatis personae]]''.

The \"Additional Scene\" and then the \"Sequel\", the epilogue, are the final portions of the play.<ref name=WangCHp10>Wang, C. H., p. 10.</ref>\n\n===Plot===\nIn the late [[Ming dynasty]], the reformist [[Donglin movement]] reinstituted the \"Restoration Society\" (C: [[:zh:\u5fa9\u793e|\u5fa9\u793e]], P: ''f\u00f9sh\u00e8'', W: ''fu-she'') in [[Nanjing]] to fight corrupt officials. Hou Fangyu, one of the Society's members, falls in love with courtesan [[Li Xiangjun]] beside the [[Qinhuai River]]. He sends Li Xiangjun a fan as a gift and becomes engaged to her. An official called [[Ruan Dacheng]], delivers trousseau through celebrity Yang Longyou (T: [[:zh:\u694a\u9f8d\u53cb|\u694a\u9f8d\u53cb]], S: [[:zh:\u694a\u9f8d\u53cb|\u6768\u9f99\u53cb]], P: ''Y\u00e1ng L\u00f3ngy\u01d2u'', W: ''Yang Lung-yu'') for Hou in order not to be isolated from the royal court. Hou is persuaded into accepting it, but Li Xiangjun rejects the gift firmly, which wins Hou Fangyu's respect.\n\nBecause he lacks military provisions, the commander of [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] Zuo Liangyu intends to move his army south to Nanjing, which terrifies the court. Considering Hou Fangyu's father had once been Zuo Liangyu's superior, Nanjing officials send Yang to ask Hou for help as a substitute. Hou Fangyu writes a letter to discourage Zuo from moving, but is slandered by Ruan for betraying the country, forcing him to find shelter with [[Shi Kefa]] in [[Yangzhou]]. Li Xiangjun and Hou Fangyu are separated.\n\nAt that time, the political situation runs out of control. News comes that [[Li Zicheng]], the leader of peasant rebellion, had captured the capital Beijing, and that the [[Chongzhen Emperor]] had hanged himself. Ruan and Ma Shiying, the local governor of Fengyang (\u9cf3\u967d\u7763\u64ab), crowns the Prince of Fu (\u798f\u738b) [[Zhu Yousong]] as new Emperor and changes the title of the reign into Hongguang \u5f18\u5149. They persecute Reformists and indulge the Emperor with lust. Governor of Cao (\u66f9\u64ab) Tian Yang (\u7530\u4ef0) covets Li's beauty and wants to take her as concubine. At the marriage ceremony, Li resists with a suicide attempt. She knocks her head on a pillar, leaving blood spots on the fan which was given by Hou Fangyu. After that, Yang draws a branch of peach blossoms with Li Xiangjun's blood on the fan, and it is sent to Hou Fangyu to show Li Xiangjun's determination. Jin Fu, author of ''Chinese Theatre'', wrote that the fan and poem symbolize the integrity and determination of Li Xiangjun.<ref name=FuJinp59>Fu, Jin, p.

However, the internal conflicts among four generals, who are in charge of strategic posts in north of the Yangtze River, are fierce, and Shi Kefa himself could not retrieve the defeat. Meanwhile, the new Emperor never cares about politics, only losing himself in song and dance. Ma Shiying and Ruan Dacheng send Li into the court as a gift, catering to the Emperor. Li Xiangjun scolds the evil officials to their faces and is beaten cruelly. Hou Fangyu flees to Nanjing during the chaotic war but was caught and sent into prison by Ruan Dacheng.\n\nYangzhou falls and Shi Kefa drowns himself into the river. The new Emperor is captured by the Qing army.<ref name=Niup112>{{harvnb|Niu|2004|p=112}}.</ref> The end of the play features a Taoist ceremony mourning the loss of the Ming dynasty. The remaining protagonists decide to seclude themselves instead of serving in the Qing dynasty.<ref name=Actonpxvii/> Hou Fangyu and Li Xiangjun meet each other occasionally at [[Qixia Mountain]]. When they are telling their affection, Zhang Yaoxing, a Taoist master, criticized them for the affair, asking \"How laughable to cling to your amorous desires when the world has been turned upside down?\"<ref>K'ung, p.

Birch wrote that the Hou Fangyu-Fragrant Princess love affair \"is brilliantly integrated with the more weighty matter of the plot\" and that the martial scenes \"perfectly reflect the unhappy progress of the Ming cause and depict in vivid terms the gallant but ultimately futile loyalty or generals like Huang Te-kung and Shih-K'o-fa.\"<ref name=Actonpxvii/>\n\n==Characters==\n[[File:Portrait of Li Xiangjun (\u674e\u9999\u541b) by Cui He.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of Li Xiangjun'' by Cui He, circa 1800\u20131850 ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]])]]\nThe play involves 30 ''[[dramatis personae]]''.

The toys belong to two children who live at the house named Benjie and Sis (however, they are never seen on-screen). Whenever the children or anyone else are not present, the Rubbadubbers come to life and begin a fun activity.\n\nBut in every episode, one of the toys become dissatisfied with the way the activity or situation goes. He/she then wishes for it to go as planned by beginning the wish with 'if only...' . Suddenly, the Rubbadubber begins dreaming about an alternate reality where the wish comes true. Some of the other Rubbadubbers appear in the dream world as well, where they play different versions of their regular selves in order to either assist or hinder the character that made the wish.\n\nIt always turns out that the wish goes wrong in the dream world, much to the character's disappointment. The character then complains again with another 'if only...', which automatically stops the dream. From the dream, the character learns to be careful with what they wish for, and then decides that instead of changing the real-world situation to their will, they should simply leave it as it was and find a way to have fun with it. All the Rubbadubbers are then happy again. Each episode ends with Reg the robot, one of the Rubbadubbers, announcing to the others that Benjie and Sis are arriving for their bath. The toys then excitedly prepare themselves for it.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Rubbadubbers ===\n*Tubb (voiced by [[John Gordon Sinclair]]) is a male Scottish rubber frog and the [[leader]] of the Rubbadubbers. He is admired by everyone for his cool attitude and enjoys cleaning anything with his [[cotton bud]] and floating on a [[green]] [[Lily Pad|lily pad]]. Tubb's catchphrase is 'swimmin'!'\n*Sploshy (voiced by [[Maria Darling]]) is a female English starfish sponge. She speaks in a childish voice, is very energetic (she is often seen cartwheeling) and is known to have a short temper. Sploshy's catchphrase is 'splish, splash, splosh!'\n*Finbar (voiced by [[Sean Hughes (comedian)|Sean Hughes]]) is a male Irish wind-up shark. He often calls himself in third-person 'the mighty, scary shark', while often playing games involving pretend hunting and scaring. He also frequently uses the word 'mighty' in place of 'very' to describe things. In the dream worlds, he usually plays roles that rival the character that made the wish (such as robbers, monsters and even his regular self). Finbar's pirate-like catchphrase is 'arr, arr, arr!' (one which he uses countless times).\n*Terence (voiced by John Gordon Sinclair) is a male English soap bottle who resembles a crocodile. He can blow bubbles out of his nose and heavily dislikes getting splashed, often avoiding water altogether. He has a favourite, red toothbrush for cleaning his one tooth. Terence also has several spots on his back and doesn't have a catchphrase.\n*Winona (voiced by Maria Darling) is a female purple rubber baby whale. She is mute, thus she cannot speak and make 'if only' wishes, but she can make squeaking sounds in order to communicate with the Rubbadubbers. She can also squirt water from her blowhole and perform tail tricks.\n*Reg (voiced by John Gordon Sinclair) is a male Australian toy robot and is the supporting leader of the Rubbadubbers. Just like Terence, he avoids water, as simply getting splashed makes him malfunction. He also stutters rather often. He plays with the others but is always on the lookout for Benjie and Sis' presence in order to make the Rubbadubbers prepare themselves for bath time. At the end of every episode, he announces their arrival with his catchphrase: 'Rubbadubbers! Rubbadubbers! Benjie and Sis/the children are coming! Bath time scramble!'\n*Amelia (voiced by Maria Darling) is a female English aeroplane-submarine hybrid toy. Likely named after [[Amelia Earhart]], she and the Rubbadubbers often call her 'the flying submarine'. She is very energetic (like Sploshy), is usually rather happy and loves to try new things, fly around the bathroom and perform tricks.\n\n=== Others ===\n*Lawrence (voiced by John Gordon Sinclair) is a male English soap bottle that resembles a crocodile. He only appears in the episode 'Terence's Double Trouble' and plays Terence's almost-fully-identical friend in Terence's dream. But the only differences to him and Terence are that the tie that he wears is blue (Terence has a red one), he doesn't have a toothbrush, he has two teeth (Terence has one) and can do better tie tricks than Terence.\n*Benjie and Sis are the two owners of the Rubbadubbers that are never seen on-screen. They are two young human siblings that are presumably British. Whenever they need to use the bathroom, Reg the robot alerts the Rubbadubbers to prepare for their arrival.\n\n==[[VHS]] and [[DVD]] Releases==\n\n* Rubbadubbers: Here Come the Rubbadubbers!\n* Rubbadubbers: Splish!
