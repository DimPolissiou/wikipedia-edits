Although Imperial chronologies include eight empresses regnant in the course of Japanese history, their successors were always selected from amongst the members of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women's reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century.<ref name=\"jt2007\"/>  Though [[Empress Genmei]] was followed on the throne by her daughter, [[Empress Gensh\u014d]],<ref>Ponsonby-Fane, Richard.

On 20 January 2006, [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Junichiro Koizumi]] used part of his annual keynote speech to address the controversy when he pledged to submit a bill to the [[National Diet|Diet]] letting women ascend to the throne in order that the Imperial throne be continued into the future in a stable manner.

Although Imperial chronologies include eight empresses regnant in the course of Japanese history, their successors were always selected from amongst the members of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women's reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century.<ref name=\"jt2007\"/>  Though [[Empress Genmei]] was followed on the throne by her daughter, [[Empress Gensh\u014d]],<ref>Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1959). ''The Imperial House of Japan,'' p. 56.</ref> Gensh\u014d herself was succeeded by her brother's son, thus keeping the throne in the same agnatic line; both Gensh\u014d and Genmei, as well as all other empresses regnant and emperors, belonged to the same [[patriline]].\n\nA government-appointed panel of experts submitted a report on 25 October 2005, recommending that the Imperial succession law be amended to permit absolute primogeniture. On 20 January 2006, [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Junichiro Koizumi]] used part of his annual keynote speech to address the controversy when he pledged to submit a bill to the [[National Diet|Diet]] letting women ascend to the throne in order that the Imperial throne be continued into the future in a stable manner. Koizumi did not announce a timing for the legislation to be introduced nor did he provide details about the content, but he did note that it would be in line with the conclusions of the 2005 government panel.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4630464.stm | work=BBC News | title=Japan bill to let women on throne | date=January 20, 2006 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Birth of male cousin===\n{{see also|Japanese succession debate}}\nProposals to replace agnatic primogeniture were shelved temporarily after it was announced in February 2006 that the-then Crown Prince's younger brother, [[Fumihito, Prince Akishino]], and his wife, [[Kiko, Princess Akishino]], were expecting their third child.

It can use [[twist drill]] bits, [[annular cutter]]s, milling cutters, and other rotary cutters. With suitable bits it can also tap threads, ream, and countersink. Its combination of a stable magnetic base and low RPM help resist or reduce torque forces created by large diameter bits.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://magneticdrillingmachines.com/2015/03/13/what-is-a-magnetic-drilling-machine/|title=What is a Magnetic Drilling Machine?}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bds-machines.com/blogs/troubleshooting-magnetic-drill-machine/|title=How to Troubleshoot Magnetic Drilling Machine Problems|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Magnetic drilling machines with reversible motor and variable speed controls can also performa operations like tapping<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bds-machines.in/annular-cutters/how-to-perform-tapping-thread-cutting-with-a-magnetic-drilling-machine/|title=How to perform Tapping (Thread Cutting) with a Magnetic Drilling Machine?|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>, countersink and reaming.

It gives an accuracy of 0.01 mm to 0.05mm in steel or other magnetic material. The drill bits used for this machines are generally made from high-speed steel(HSS) or are tungsten carbide tipped(TCT).\n\n=== Base ===\nThe base of a magnetic drill is equipped with a powerful electromagnet to easily clamp the machine on the work piece to be drilled. When energized this magnet is held on the metal work piece locking the machine base to the surface. The electromagnet plays a very important role in a portable magnetic drill, as it helps the machine to be steady, does not let the machine dismount during drilling, can work with the machine overhead, horizontal or vertical. Generally, a magnetic core drilling machine is used on a ferrous material directly, but it can also be used on non-ferrous material like aluminum with the help of clamping devices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.magnetic-drilling-machine.com/faqs/|title=Frequently Asked Questions About Drilling|website=www.magnetic-drilling-machine.com/faqs/|publisher=BDS Machines Pvt. Ltd.|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-12}}</ref> The new generation magnetic driling machines' bases are also equipped with Swivel Base, to position the machine under magnetic condition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bds-maschinen-gmbh.de/blogs/magnet-kernbohrmaschinen-vorteile/|title=Magnetkernbohrmaschine mit Swivel Base|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Stand ===\nA drill stand is the main body of the magnetic drill where the electric switches for motor and magnet are mounted, magnet indicator is mounted and also the clock-anticlockwise direction switches are mounted. The body of the magnetic drill holds together the motor and the magnet base. The feed handle is also attached to the body. The body of the magnetic drill helps the motor slide on it to get an upward and downward feed. The body of the magnetic drill also plays the role of a handle to lift and move the machine from one place to other. The material used for the body is generally cast iron.\n\n=== Arbor ===\nAn arbor or chuck on a magnetic drill is attached to the motor. it is a type of clamp used to attach the core drills. There are mainly two types of chuck available for the magnetic drill, industrial arbor (manual tightening) and quick change drill chucks.

It can use [[twist drill]] bits, [[annular cutter]]s, milling cutters, and other rotary cutters. With suitable bits it can also tap threads, ream, and countersink. Its combination of a stable magnetic base and low RPM help resist or reduce torque forces created by large diameter bits.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://magneticdrillingmachines.com/2015/03/13/what-is-a-magnetic-drilling-machine/|title=What is a Magnetic Drilling Machine?}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nA portable magnetic drilling machine is faster and more portable alternative to hole making machines such as the drill press, and is more accurate than a hand drill. \n\nA portable magnetic drilling machine is used on steel or other magnetic materials.  It gives an accuracy of 0.01 mm to 0.05mm in steel or other magnetic material. The drill bits used for this machines are generally made from high-speed steel(HSS) or are tungsten carbide tipped(TCT).\n\n=== Base ===\nThe base of a magnetic drill is equipped with a powerful electromagnet to easily clamp the machine on the work piece to be drilled. When energized this magnet is held on the metal work piece locking the machine base to the surface. The electromagnet plays a very important role in a portable magnetic drill, as it helps the machine to be steady, does not let the machine dismount during drilling, can work with the machine overhead, horizontal or vertical. Generally, a magnetic core drilling machine is used on a ferrous material directly, but it can also be used on non-ferrous material like aluminum with the help of clamping devices.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.magnetic-drilling-machine.com/faqs/|title=Frequently Asked Questions About Drilling|website=www.magnetic-drilling-machine.com/faqs/|publisher=BDS Machines Pvt. Ltd.|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-12}}</ref>\n\n=== Stand ===\nA drill stand is the main body of the magnetic drill where the electric switches for motor and magnet are mounted, magnet indicator is mounted and also the clock-anticlockwise direction switches are mounted. The body of the magnetic drill holds together the motor and the magnet base. The feed handle is also attached to the body. The body of the magnetic drill helps the motor slide on it to get an upward and downward feed. The body of the magnetic drill also plays the role of a handle to lift and move the machine from one place to other. The material used for the body is generally cast iron.\n\n=== Arbor ===\nAn arbor or chuck on a magnetic drill is attached to the motor. it is a type of clamp used to attach the core drills. There are mainly two types of chuck available for the magnetic drill, industrial arbor (manual tightening) and quick change drill chucks. The quick change drill chucks are easy and fast option to attach the core drills. They do not need to tighten the screws/jaws manually. The arbor or chucks have different types of spindle holder (machine taper) like Morse taper MT 2, MT 3, and MT 4. The chuck allows different types of core drill shafts (shanks) to fit in it.\n\n== Types ==\nPopular forms of magnetic drilling machine include:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bds-machines.com/Magnetic-Drilling-Machines/en_US|title=Magnetic Drilling Machines}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blogen.bds-machines.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=628&action=edit&lang=en|title=Types Of Magnetic Drilling Machines|last=BDS Maschinen GmbH|website=www.bds-machines.com|publisher=BDS Maschinen GmbH}}</ref>\n\n=== Light weight ===\nVery light weight types magnetic drills are very popular to perform several operations where the weight of a machine to carry is a great concern like working on an electric pole, mobile tower, TV tower, bridge, etc.\n\n=== Automatic and semi-automatic feed ===\nMagnetic core drilling machines with fully and semi-automatic drill feed are very popular these days.

The name was changed in 1920 to the ''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'' \u2013 NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers' Party, commonly known as the [[Nazi Party]]). It was [[anti-Marxist]] and opposed to the democratic post-war government of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the [[Treaty of Versailles]], advocating extreme nationalism and [[Pan-Germanism]] as well as virulent [[anti-Semitism]]. Hitler attained power in March 1933, after the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] adopted the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] in that month, giving expanded authority. President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] had already appointed Hitler as [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] on 30 January 1933 after a series of parliamentary elections and associated backroom intrigues. The Enabling Act\u2014when used ruthlessly and with authority\u2014virtually assured that Hitler could thereafter constitutionally exercise dictatorial power without legal objection.\n\nHitler rose to a place of prominence in the early years of the party. Being one of its best speakers, he was made leader after he threatened to leave otherwise. He was aided in part by his willingness to use violence in advancing his political objectives and to recruit party members who were willing to do the same. The [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in November 1923 and the later release of his book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (''My Struggle'') expanded Hitler's audience. In the mid-1920s, the party engaged in electoral battles in which Hitler participated as a speaker and organizer,{{efn|name=citizenship}} as well as in street battles and violence between the ''[[Rotfrontk\u00e4mpferbund]]'' and the Nazis' ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA). Through the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Nazis gathered enough electoral support to become the largest political party in the Reichstag, and Hitler's blend of political acuity, deceptiveness, and cunning converted the party's non-[[majority]] but [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] status into effective governing power in the ailing Weimar Republic of 1933.\n\nOnce in power, the Nazis created a mythology surrounding their rise to power, and they described the period that roughly corresponds to the scope of this article as either the ''Kampfzeit'' (the time of struggle) or the ''Kampfjahre'' (years of struggle).\n\n==Early steps (1918\u20131924)==\n[[Adolf Hitler]] became involved with the fledgling Nazi Party after the First World War, and set the violent tone of the movement early, by forming the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) paramilitary.{{sfn|''Shadows of the Dictators''|1989|p=25}} Catholic Bavaria resented rule from Protestant Berlin, and Hitler at first saw revolution in Bavaria as a means to power\u2014but an early attempt proved fruitless, and he was imprisoned after the 1923 Munich [[Beerhall Putsch]]. He used the time to write ''Mein Kampf'', in which he argued that effeminate Jewish-Christian ethics were enfeebling Europe, and that Germany needed a man of iron to restore itself and build an empire.{{sfn|''Shadows of the Dictators''|1989|p=27}} He decided on the tactic of pursuing power through legal means.{{sfn|''Shadows of the Dictators''|1989|p=28}}\n\n===From Armistice (November 1918) to party membership (September 1919)===\n[[File:February 1919 US News coverage of unrest in Germany.png|thumb|300px|alt=B&W newspapers|February 1919 United States News coverage of the unrest in Germany]]\nAfter being granted permission from [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|King Ludwig III of Bavaria]], 25-year-old Austrian-born Hitler enlisted in a Bavarian regiment of the German Army, although he was not yet a German citizen. For over four years (August 1914&nbsp;\u2013 November 1918), Germany was a principal nation involved in World War I {{efn|name=promotions}} on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. After the fighting on the front ended in November 1918,{{efn|name=surrender}} on 19 November, Hitler was discharged from the Pasewalk hospital{{efn|name=wounded}} and returned to Munich, which at the time was in a state of [[People's State of Bavaria|socialist upheaval]].{{sfn|Ullrich|2016|p=73}} Arriving on 21 November, he was assigned to 7th Company of the 1st Replacement Battalion of the 2nd Infantry Regiment. In December he was reassigned to a Prisoner of War camp in Traunstein as a guard.{{sfn|Ullrich|2016|p=75}} There he would stay until the camp dissolved January 1919.{{efn|name=guard duty}}\n\nHe returned to Munich and spent a few months in barracks waiting for reassignment. During this time in Munich there were a number of assassinations, including socialist [[Kurt Eisner]]{{efn|name=KurtEisner}} who was shot dead by a German nationalist on 21 February 1919. His rival [[Erhard Auer]] was also wounded in an attack. Other acts of violence were the killings of both Major Paul Ritter von Jahrei\u00df and the conservative MP [[:de:Heinrich Osel|Heinrich Osel]]. In this political chaos Berlin sent in the military \u2013 called the \"White Guards of Capitalism\" by the communists. On 3 April 1919, Hitler was elected as the liaison of his military battalion and again on 15 April. During this time he urged his unit to stay out of the fighting and not join either side.{{sfn|Ullrich|2016|p=79}} The [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] was officially crushed on 6 May 1919, when Lt. General Burghard von Oven and his forces declared the city secure. In the aftermath of arrests and executions, Hitler denounced a fellow liaison, Georg Dufter, as a Soviet \"radical rabble-rouser.\"{{sfn|Ullrich|2016|p=80}} Other testimony he gave to the military board of inquiry allowed them to root out other members of the military that \"had been infected with revolutionary fervor.\"{{sfn|Mitchell|2013|p=37}} For his anti-communist views he was allowed to avoid discharge when his unit was disbanded in May 1919.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=34}}{{efn|name=political department}}\n\nIn June 1919, Hitler was moved to the demobilization office of the 2nd Infantry Regiment. Around this time the German military command released an edict that the army's main priority was to \"carry out, in conjunction with the police, stricter surveillance of the population ... so that the ignition of any new unrest can be discovered and extinguished.\"{{sfn|Ullrich|2016|p=80}} In May 1919 [[Karl Mayr]] became commander of the 6th Battalion of the guards regiment in Munich and from 30 May the head of the \"Education and Propaganda Department\" of the General Command von Oven and the Group Command No. 4 (Department Ib). In this capacity as head of the intelligence department, Mayr recruited Hitler as an undercover agent in early June 1919. Under Captain Mayr \"national thinking\" courses were arranged at the Reichswehrlager Lechfeld near Augsburg,{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=72\u201374}} with Hitler attending from 10\u201319 July. During this time Hitler so impressed Mayr that he assigned him to an anti-bolshevik \"educational commando\" as 1 of 26 instructors in the summer of 1919.{{sfn|Ullrich|2016|p=82}}{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=35}}{{efn|name=public speaking 1}}{{efn|name=public speaking 2}}\n\nIn July 1919 Hitler was appointed ''Verbindungsmann'' (intelligence agent) of an ''Aufkl\u00e4rungskommando'' (reconnaissance commando) of the ''Reichswehr'', both to influence other soldiers and to [[Espionage|infiltrate]] the German Workers' Party (DAP). The DAP had been formed by [[Anton Drexler]], [[Karl Harrer]] and others, through amalgamation of other groups, on 5 January 1919 at a small gathering in Munich at the restaurant Fuerstenfelder Hof. While he studied the activities of the DAP, Hitler became impressed with Drexler's antisemitic, nationalist, [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] and anti-Marxist ideas.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}}\n[[File:Hitler's DAP membership card.png|thumb|Hitler's membership card for the German Workers' Party (DAP)]]\nDuring the 12 September 1919 meeting,{{efn|name=beer hall meeting}} Hitler took umbrage with comments made by an audience member that were directed against [[Gottfried Feder]], the speaker, a crank economist with whom Hitler was acquainted due to a lecture Feder delivered in an army \"education\" course.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=35}}{{efn|name=Feder}} The audience member (Hitler in ''Mein Kampf'' disparagingly called him the \"professor\") asserted that [[Bavaria]] should be wholly independent from Germany and should secede from Germany and unite with [[Austria]] to form a new South German nation.{{efn|name=South German Nation}} The volatile Hitler arose and scolded the unfortunate Professor Baumann, using his speaking skills and eventually causing Baumann to leave the meeting before its adjournment.{{sfn|Hitler|1999|p=219}}{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=75}} Impressed with Hitler's oratory skills, Drexler encouraged him to join the DAP. On the orders of his army superiors, Hitler applied to join the party.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=170}} Within a week, Hitler received a postcard stating he had officially been accepted as a member and he should come to a \"committee\" meeting to discuss it. Hitler attended the \"committee\" meeting held at the run-down Alte Rosenbad beer-house.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=75, 76}} Later Hitler wrote that joining the fledgling party \"...was the most decisive resolve of my life. From here there was and could be no turning back. ...&nbsp;I registered as a member of the German Workers' Party and received a provisional membership card with the number 7\".{{sfn|Hitler|1999|p=224}} Normally, enlisted army personnel were not allowed to join political parties. However, in this case, Hitler had Captain Mayr's permission to join the DAP. Further, Hitler was allowed to stay in the army and receive his weekly pay of 20 gold marks.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=76}}\n\n===From early party membership to the Hofbr\u00e4uhaus Mel\u00e9e (November 1921)===\n{{quote box| quote = ''[[Otto Strasser]]'': What is the program of the NSDAP?<br />''Hitler'': The program is not the question.

With the support of Anton Drexler, Hitler became chief of propaganda for the party in early 1920 and his actions began to transform the party. He organised their biggest meeting yet of 2,000 people, on 24 February 1920 in the ''Staatliches Hofbr\u00e4uhaus in M\u00fcnchen''.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=86}} There Hitler announced the party's 25-point program (''see'' [[National Socialist Program]]).{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=85, 86}} He engineered the name change of the DAP to the ''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei''&nbsp;\u2013 [[NSDAP]] (National Socialist German Workers' Party), commonly known to the rest of the world as the [[Nazi Party]].{{efn|name=Nazi}}{{sfn|Zentner|Bed\u00fcrftig|1997|p=629}} Hitler designed the party's banner of a [[swastika]] in a white circle on a red background. Hitler was later discharged from the army in March 1920 and began working full-time for the Nazi Party.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=87\u201388, 93}}\n\nIn 1920, a small \"hall protection\" squad was organised around [[Emil Maurice]].{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=50}} The group was first named the \"Order troops\" (''Ordnertruppen''). Later in August 1921, Hitler redefined the group, which became known as the \"Gymnastic and Sports Division\" of the party (''Turn- und Sportabteilung'').{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=42}} By the autumn of 1921 the group was being called the ''Sturmabteilung'' (Storm Detachment) or SA, and in November 1921 the group was officially known by that name.{{sfn|Campbell|1998|pp=19, 20}}\n\nIn 1920, Hitler also began to lecture in Munich beer halls, particularly the ''[[Hofbr\u00e4uhaus]]'', ''[[Sterneckerbr\u00e4u]]'' and ''[[B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller]]''. Only Hitler was able to bring in the crowds for the party speeches and meetings. By this time, the police were already monitoring the speeches, and their own surviving records reveal that Hitler delivered lectures with titles such as ''Political Phenomenon, Jews and the [[Treaty of Versailles]]''. At the end of the year, party membership was recorded at 2,000.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=88\u201389}}\n\nIn June 1921, while Hitler and [[Dietrich Eckart]] were on a fundraising trip to Berlin, a mutiny broke out within the Nazi Party in Munich, its organizational home. Members of its executive committee wanted to merge with the rival [[German Socialist Party]] (DSP).{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=100\u2013101}} Hitler returned to Munich on 11 July and angrily tendered his resignation. The committee members realised that the resignation of their leading public figure and speaker would mean the end of the party.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=102}} Hitler announced he would rejoin on the condition that he would replace Drexler as party chairman and that the party headquarters would remain in Munich.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=103}} The committee agreed, and he rejoined the party on 26 July as member 3,680.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=103}} In the following days, Hitler spoke to several packed houses and defended himself, to thunderous applause. His strategy proved successful: at a general membership meeting, he was granted absolute powers as party chairman, with only one nay vote cast.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=83, 103}}\n\nOn 14 September 1921, Hitler and a substantial number of SA members and other Nazi Party adherents disrupted a meeting at the ''[[L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4ukeller]]'' of the Bavarian League. This federalist organization objected to the centralism of the Weimar Constitution but accepted its social program. The League was led by [[Otto Ballerstedt]], an engineer whom Hitler regarded as \"my most dangerous opponent\". One Nazi, [[Hermann Esser]], climbed upon a chair and shouted that the Jews were to blame for the misfortunes of Bavaria and the Nazis shouted demands that Ballerstedt yield the floor to Hitler.{{sfn|Toland|1976|pp=112\u2013113}} The Nazis beat up Ballerstedt and shoved him off the stage into the audience. Hitler and Esser were arrested and Hitler commented notoriously to the police commissioner, \"It's all right. We got what we wanted. Ballerstedt did not speak\".{{sfn|Toland|1976|p=113}} Hitler was eventually sentenced to 3 months imprisonment and ended up serving only a little over one month.\n\nOn 4 November 1921, the Nazi Party held a large public meeting in the Munich ''[[Hofbr\u00e4uhaus]]''. After Hitler had spoken for some time, the meeting erupted into a mel\u00e9e in which a small company of SA defeated the opposition.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=50}}\n\n===From Beer Hall Mel\u00e9e to Beer Hall ''Coup D'\u00c9tat''===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00344, M\u00fcnchen, nach Hitler-Ludendorff Prozess.jpg|thumb|Defendants in the Beer Hall Putsch]]\nIn 1922 and early 1923, Hitler and the Nazi Party formed two organizations that would grow to have huge significance. The first began as the ''Jungsturm Adolf Hitler'' and the ''[[Jugendbund]] der NSDAP''; they would later become the [[Hitler Youth]].{{sfn|Lepage|2008|p=21}}{{sfn|Zentner|Bed\u00fcrftig|1997|p=431}} The other was the ''Stabswache'' (Staff Guard), which in May 1923 was renamed the ''[[Sto\u00dftrupp-Hitler]]'' (Shock Troop-Hitler).{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=16}} This early incarnation of a bodyguard unit for Hitler would later become the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS).{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=26\u201329}}\nInspired by [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[March on Rome]] in 1922, Hitler decided that a ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' was the proper strategy to seize control of the country. In May 1923, elements loyal to Hitler within the army helped the SA to procure a barracks and its weaponry, but the order to march never came.\n\nA pivotal moment came when Hitler led the [[Beer Hall Putsch]], an attempted ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' on 8\u20139 November 1923. [[List of Nazis who died in the Beer Hall Putsch|Sixteen Nazi Party members]] and four police officers were killed in the failed [[coup]]. Hitler was arrested on 11 November 1923.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=131}} Hitler was put on trial for [[high treason]], gaining great public attention.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=75}}\n\nThe rather spectacular trial began in February 1924. Hitler endeavored to turn the tables and put democracy and the Weimar Republic on trial as traitors to the German people. Hitler was convicted and on 1 April sentenced to five years' imprisonment at [[Landsberg Prison]].{{sfn|Fulda|2009|pp=68\u201369}} Hitler received friendly treatment from the guards; he had a room with a view of the river, wore a tie, had regular visitors to his chambers, was allowed mail from supporters and was permitted the use of a private secretary. Pardoned by the Bavarian Supreme Court, he was released from jail on 20 December 1924, against the state prosecutor's objections.{{sfn|Kershaw|1999|p=239}}\n\nHitler used the time in Landsberg Prison to consider his political strategy and dictate the first volume of [[Mein Kampf]] (''My Struggle''; originally entitled ''Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity, and Cowardice''), principally to his deputy [[Rudolf Hess]].{{efn|name=Hess}} After the putsch the party was banned in [[Bavaria]], but it participated in 1924's two elections by proxy as the [[National Socialist Freedom Movement]]. In the [[May 1924 German federal election]] the party gained seats in the Reichstag, with 6.6% (1,918,329) voting for the Movement. In the [[December 1924 German federal election|December 1924 federal election]], the National Socialist Freedom Movement (NSFB) (combination of the ''Deutschv\u00f6lkische Freiheitspartei'' (DVFP) and the Nazi Party (NSDAP)) lost 18 seats, only holding on to 14 seats, with 3% (907,242) of the electorate voting for Hitler's party. The [[Barmat Scandal]] was often used later in Nazi propaganda, both as an electoral strategy and as an appeal to anti-Semitism.\n\nAfter some reflection, Hitler had determined that power was to be achieved not through revolution outside of the government, but rather through legal means, within the confines of the democratic system established by Weimar. For five to six years, there would be no further prohibitions of the party.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Move towards power (1925\u20131930)==\nIn the [[1928 German federal election|May 1928 federal election]], the party achieved just 12 seats in the Reichstag.{{sfn|Kolb|2005|pp=224\u2013225}} The highest provincial gain was again in Bavaria (5.1%), though in three areas the Nazis failed to gain even 1% of the vote. Overall the Party gained 2.6% (810,100) of the vote.{{sfn|Kolb|2005|pp=224\u2013225}} Partially due to the poor results, Hitler decided that Germans needed to know more about his goals. Despite being discouraged by his publisher, he wrote a second book that was discovered and released posthumously as the ''[[Zweites Buch]]''. At this time the SA began a period of deliberate antagonism to the Rotfront by marching into Communist strongholds and starting violent altercations.\n\nAt the end of 1928, party membership was recorded at 130,000. In March 1929, [[Erich Ludendorff]] represented the Nazi Party in the Presidential elections. He gained 280,000 votes (1.1%), and was the only candidate to poll fewer than a million votes. The battles on the streets grew increasingly violent. After the Rotfront interrupted a speech by Hitler, the SA marched into the streets of Nuremberg and killed two bystanders. In a tit-for-tat action, the SA stormed a Rotfront meeting on 25 August and days later the Berlin headquarters of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) itself. In September [[Goebbels]] led his men into [[Neuk\u00f6lln]], a KPD stronghold, and the two warring parties exchanged pistol and revolver fire.\n\nThe [[1929 German referendum|German referendum of 1929]] was important as it gained the Nazi Party recognition and credibility it never had before.<ref>Nicholls, A.J.

Goebbels seized upon the attack (and the weeks Wessel spent on his deathbed) to publicize the song, and the funeral was used as an anti-Communist propaganda opportunity for the Nazis.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=266\u2013268}} In May, Goebbels was convicted of \"libeling\" President Hindenburg and fined 800 marks. It stemmed from a 1929 article by Goebbels in his newspaper ''[[Der Angriff]]''. In June, Goebbels was charged with high treason by the prosecutor in Leipzig based on statements Goebbels had made in 1927, but after a four-month investigation it came to naught.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|pp=111\u2013112}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 119-0289, M\u00fcnchen, Hitler bei Einweihung \"Braunes Haus\".jpg|thumb|right|275px|Hitler with Nazi Party members in December 1930]]\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Hitler's party gained a victory in the Reichstag, obtaining 107 seats (18.3%, 6,409,600 votes) in the [[1930 German federal election|September 1930 federal election]].{{sfn|Kolb|2005|pp=224\u2013225}} The Nazis became the second largest party in Germany. In Bavaria the party gained 17.9% of the vote, though for the first time this percentage was exceeded by most other provinces: Oldenburg (27.3%), Braunschweig (26.6%), Waldeck (26.5%), Mecklenburg-Strelitz (22.6%), Lippe (22.3%) Mecklenburg-Schwerin (20.1%), Anhalt (19.8%), Thuringen (19.5%), Baden (19.2%), Hamburg (19.2%), Prussia (18.4%), Hessen (18.4%), Sachsen (18.3%), Lubeck (18.3%) and Schaumburg-Lippe (18.1%).\n\nAn unprecedented amount of money was thrown behind the campaign. Well over one million pamphlets were produced and distributed; sixty trucks were commandeered for use in Berlin alone. In areas where Nazi campaigning was less rigorous, the total was as low as 9%. [[The Great Depression]] was also a factor in Hitler's electoral success. Against this legal backdrop, the SA began its first major anti-Jewish action on 13 October 1930 when groups of brownshirts smashed the windows of Jewish-owned stores at [[Potsdamer Platz]].{{sfn|Hakim|1995|p={{page needed|date=January 2014}} }}\n\n==Weimar parties fail to halt Nazis==\nThe [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] heralded worldwide economic disaster. The Nazis and the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communists]] made great gains at the [[1930 German federal election|1930 federal election]].{{sfn|Fulbrook|1991|p=55}} Both the Nazis and Communists between them secured almost 40% of Reichstag seats, which required the moderate parties to consider negotiations with anti-democrats.{{sfn|Bullock|1991|p=118}} \"The Communists\", wrote Bullock, \"openly announced that they would prefer to see the Nazis in power rather than lift a finger to save the republic\".{{sfn|Bullock|1991|p=138}}\n\nThe [[Weimar political parties]] failed to stop the Nazi rise. Germany's Weimar political system made it difficult for chancellors to govern with a stable parliamentary majority, and successive chancellors instead relied on the president's emergency powers to govern.{{sfn|Bullock|1991|pp=92\u201394}} From 1931 to 1933, the Nazis combined terror tactics with conventional campaigning \u2013 Hitler criss-crossed the nation by air, while SA troops paraded in the streets, beat up opponents, and broke up their meetings.{{sfn|''Shadows of the Dictators''|1989|p=28}}\n\nA middle-class liberal party strong enough to block the Nazis did not exist&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Deutsche Volkspartei|People's Party]] and the [[Deutsche Demokratische Partei|Democrats]] suffered severe losses to the Nazis at the polls. The Social Democrats were essentially a conservative trade union party, with ineffectual leadership. The [[Catholic Centre Party]] maintained its voting block, but was preoccupied with defending its own particular interests and, wrote Bullock: \"through 1932-3&nbsp;... was so far from recognizing the danger of a Nazi dictatorship that it continued to negotiate with the Nazis\". The Communists meanwhile were engaging in violent clashes with Nazis on the streets, but Moscow had directed the Communist Party to prioritise destruction of the Social Democrats, seeing more danger in them as a rival for the loyalty of the working class. Nevertheless, wrote Bullock, the heaviest responsibility lay with the German right wing, who \"forsook a true conservatism\" and made Hitler their partner in a coalition government.{{sfn|Bullock|1991|pp=138\u2013139}}\n\n[[File:PapenSchleicher0001.jpg|thumb|Chancellor [[Franz von Papen]] (left) with his eventual successor, the Minister of Defence [[Kurt von Schleicher]]]]\n\nThe Centre Party's [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]] was Chancellor from 1930 to 1932.

Schleicher convinced Hindenburg to sack Papen, and Schleicher himself became Chancellor, promising to form a workable coalition.{{sfn|Bullock|1991|p=128}}\n\nThe aggrieved Papen opened negotiations with Hitler, proposing a Nazi-Nationalist Coalition. Having nearly outmaneuvered Hitler, only to be trounced by Schleicher, Papen turned his attentions on defeating Schleicher, and concluded an agreement with Hitler.{{sfn|Bullock|1991|p=132}}\n\n==Seizure of control (1931\u20131933)==\nOn 10 March 1931, with street violence between the Rotfront and SA increasing, breaking all previous barriers and expectations, [[Prussia]] re-enacted its ban on Brownshirts. Days after the ban, SA-men shot dead two communists in a street fight, which led to a ban being placed on the public speaking of Goebbels, who sidestepped the prohibition by recording speeches and playing them to an audience in his absence.\n\nWhen Hitler's citizenship became a matter of public discussion in 1924 he had a public declaration printed on 16 October 1924,\n\n{{quote|The loss of my Austrian citizenship is not painful to me, as I never felt as an Austrian citizen but always as a German only. ...

The deaths mounted, with many more on the Rotfront side, and by the end of 1931 the SA had suffered 47 deaths and the Rotfront recorded losses of approximately 80 killed. Street fights and beer hall battles resulting in deaths occurred throughout February and April 1932, all against the backdrop of Adolf Hitler's competition in the [[1932 German presidential election|presidential election]] which pitted him against the monumentally popular Hindenburg. In the first round on 13 March, Hitler had polled over 11 million votes but was still behind Hindenburg. The second and final round took place on 10 April: Hitler (36.8% 13,418,547) lost to [[Paul von Hindenburg]] (53.0% 19,359,983) while the KPD candidate Th\u00e4lmann gained a meagre percentage of the vote (10.2% 3,706,759).

After less than a month the law was repealed on 30 May by [[Franz von Papen]], Chancellor of Germany. Such ambivalence about the fate of Jews was supported by the culture of anti-Semitism that pervaded the German public at the time.\n\nIn the [[July 1932 German federal election|federal election of July 1932]], the Nazis won 37.3% of the popular vote (13,745,000 votes), an upswing by 19 percent, becoming the largest party in the Reichstag, with 230 out of 608 seats.{{sfn|Kolb|2005|pp=224\u2013225}} Dwarfed by Hitler's electoral gains, the KPD turned away from legal means and increasingly towards violence. One resulting battle in Silesia resulted in the army being dispatched, each shot sending Germany further into a potential civil war. By this time both sides marched into each other's strongholds hoping to spark a rivalry. The attacks continued and reached fever pitch when SA leader Axel Schaffeld was assassinated on 1 August.\n\nAs the Nazi Party was now the largest party in the Reichstag, it was entitled to select the President of the Reichstag and were able to elect G\u00f6ring for the post.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=297}} Energised by the success, Hitler asked to be made chancellor. Hitler was offered the job of vice-chancellor by Chancellor Papen at the behest of President Hindenburg but he refused. Hitler saw this offer as placing him in a position of \"playing second fiddle\" in the government.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=233, 234}}\n\nIn his position of Reichstag president, G\u00f6ring asked that decisive measures be taken by the government over the spate in murders of Nazi Party members. On 9 August, amendments were made to the ''Reichstrafgesetzbuch'' statute on 'acts of political violence', increasing the penalty to 'lifetime imprisonment, 20 years hard labour or death'. Special courts were announced to try such offences. When in power less than half a year later, Hitler would use this legislation against his opponents with devastating effect.\n\nThe law was applied almost immediately but did not bring the perpetrators behind the recent massacres to trial as expected. Instead, five SA men who were alleged to have murdered a KPD member in Potempa ([[Upper Silesia]]) were tried. Hitler appeared at the trial as a defence witness, but on 22 August the five were convicted and sentenced to death. On appeal, this sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in early September. They served just over four months before Hitler freed all imprisoned Nazis in a 1933 amnesty.\n\nThe Nazi Party lost 35 seats in the [[November 1932 German federal election|November 1932 election]], but remained the Reichstag's largest party, with 196 seats (33.1%). The Social Democrats (SPD) won 121 seats (20.4%) and the Communists (KPD) won 100 (16.9%).\n\nThe [[Communist International]] described all moderate left-wing parties as \"[[social fascists]]\" and urged the Communists to devote their energies to the destruction of the moderate left. As a result, the KPD, following orders from Moscow, rejected overtures from the Social Democrats to form a political alliance against the NSDAP.\n\nAfter Chancellor Papen left office, he secretly told Hitler that he still held considerable sway with President Hindenburg and that he would make Hitler chancellor as long as he, Papen, could be the vice chancellor. Another notable event was the publication of the ''[[Industrielleneingabe]]'', a letter signed by 22 important representatives of industry, finance and agriculture, asking Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as chancellor. Hindenburg reluctantly agreed to appoint Hitler as chancellor after the parliamentary elections of July and November 1932 had not resulted in the formation of a majority government. Hitler headed a short-lived coalition government formed by the NSDAP and the [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP).\n\nOn 30 January 1933, the new cabinet was sworn in during a brief ceremony in Hindenburg's office. The NSDAP gained three posts: Hitler was named chancellor, [[Wilhelm Frick]] Minister of the Interior, and Hermann G\u00f6ring, [[Minister Without Portfolio]] (and Minister of the Interior for Prussia).{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=184}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=92}} The SA and SS led torchlit parades throughout Berlin. It is this event that would become termed Hitler's ''[[:wikt:Machtergreifung|Machtergreifung]]'' (\"seizure of power\"). The term was originally used by some Nazis to suggest a revolutionary process,{{sfn|=Stachura Introduction|2015|p=6}} though Hitler, and others, used the word ''{{lang|de|Macht\u00fcbernahme}}'' (\"take-over of power\"), reflecting that the transfer of power took place within the existing constitutional framework{{sfn|=Stachura Introduction|2015|p=6}} and suggesting that the process was legal.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pages=569, 580ff}}{{sfn|Frei|1983}}\n\nPapen was to serve as Vice-Chancellor in a majority conservative Cabinet \u2013 still falsely believing that he could \"tame\" Hitler.{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}} Initially, Papen did [[Marburg speech|speak out]] against some Nazi excesses. However, after narrowly escaping death in the [[Night of the Long Knives]] in 1934, he no longer dared criticise the regime and was sent off to Vienna as German ambassador.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nBoth within Germany and abroad, there were initially few fears that Hitler could use his position to establish his later dictatorial single-party regime. Rather, the conservatives that helped to make him chancellor were convinced that they could control Hitler and \"tame\" the Nazi Party while setting the relevant impulses in the government themselves; foreign ambassadors played down worries by emphasizing that Hitler was \"mediocre\" if not a bad copy of [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]; even SPD politician [[Kurt Schumacher]] trivialized Hitler as a \"Dekorationsst\u00fcck\" (\"piece of scenery/decoration\") of the new government. German newspapers wrote that, without doubt, the Hitler-led government would try to fight its political enemies (the left-wing parties), but that it would be impossible to establish a dictatorship in Germany because there was \"a barrier, over which violence cannot proceed\" and because of the German nation being proud of \"the freedom of speech and thought\". Theodor Wolff of ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]'' wrote:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zeit.de/2017/05/adolf-hitler-reichskanzler-ernennung-jahrestag/komplettansicht |title=Ruhig abwarten! |language=German |trans-title=Calmly wait! |work=Die Zeit Online |accessdate=2016-02-03}}</ref>\n\n{{quotation|It is a hopeless misjudgement to think that one could force a dictatorial regime upon the German nation.

In a declaration of 30 January, the steering committee of the central Jewish German organization (''Centralverein deutscher Staatsb\u00fcrger j\u00fcdischen Glaubens'') wrote that \"as a matter of course\" the Jewish community faces the new government \"with the largest mistrust\", but at the same they were convinced that \"nobody would dare to touch [their] constitutional rights\".

The name was changed in 1920 to the ''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei''&nbsp;\u2013 NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers' Party, commonly known as the [[Nazi Party]]). It was [[anti-Marxist]] and opposed to the democratic post-war government of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the [[Treaty of Versailles]], advocating extreme nationalism and [[Pan-Germanism]] as well as virulent [[anti-Semitism]]. Hitler attained power in March 1933, after the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] adopted the [[Enabling Act of 1933]] in that month, giving expanded authority. President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] had already appointed Hitler as [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] on 30 January 1933 after a series of parliamentary elections and associated backroom intrigues. The Enabling Act\u2014when used ruthlessly and with authority\u2014virtually assured that Hitler could thereafter constitutionally exercise dictatorial power without legal objection.\n\nHitler rose to a place of prominence in the early years of the party. Being one of its best speakers, he was made leader after he threatened to leave otherwise. He was aided in part by his willingness to use violence in advancing his political objectives and to recruit party members who were willing to do the same. The [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in November 1923 and the later release of his book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (''My Struggle'') expanded Hitler's audience. In the mid-1920s, the party engaged in electoral battles in which Hitler participated as a speaker and organizer,{{efn|name=citizenship}} as well as in street battles and violence between the ''[[Rotfrontk\u00e4mpferbund]]'' and the Nazis' ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA). Through the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Nazis gathered enough electoral support to become the largest political party in the Reichstag, and Hitler's blend of political acuity, deceptiveness, and cunning converted the party's non-[[majority]] but [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] status into effective governing power in the ailing Weimar Republic of 1933.\n\nOnce in power, the Nazis created a mythology surrounding their rise to power, and they described the period that roughly corresponds to the scope of this article as either the ''Kampfzeit'' (the time of struggle) or the ''Kampfjahre'' (years of struggle).\n\n==Early steps (1918\u20131924)==\n[[Adolf Hitler]] became involved with the fledgling Nazi Party after the First World War, and set the violent tone of the movement early, by forming the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) paramilitary.{{sfn|''Shadows of the Dictators''|1989|p=25}} Catholic Bavaria resented rule from Protestant Berlin, and Hitler at first saw revolution in Bavaria as a means to power\u2014but an early attempt proved fruitless, and he was imprisoned after the 1923 Munich [[Beerhall Putsch]]. He used the time to write ''Mein Kampf'', in which he argued that effeminate Jewish-Christian ethics were enfeebling Europe, and that Germany needed a man of iron to restore itself and build an empire.{{sfn|''Shadows of the Dictators''|1989|p=27}} He decided on the tactic of pursuing power through legal means.{{sfn|''Shadows of the Dictators''|1989|p=28}}\n\n===From Armistice (November 1918) to party membership (September 1919)===\n[[File:February 1919 US News coverage of unrest in Germany.png|thumb|300px|alt=B&W newspapers|February 1919 United States News coverage of the unrest in Germany]]\nAfter being granted permission from [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|King Ludwig III of Bavaria]], 25-year-old Austrian-born Hitler enlisted in a Bavarian regiment of the German Army, although he was not yet a German citizen. For over four years (August 1914&nbsp;\u2013 November 1918), Germany was a principal nation involved in World War I {{efn|name=promotions}} on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. After the fighting on the front ended in November 1918,{{efn|name=surrender}} on 19 November, Hitler was discharged from the Pasewalk hospital{{efn|name=wounded}} and returned to Munich, which at the time was in a state of [[People's State of Bavaria|socialist upheaval]].{{sfn|Ullrich|2016|p=73}} Arriving on 21 November, he was assigned to 7th Company of the 1st Replacement Battalion of the 2nd Infantry Regiment. In December he was reassigned to a Prisoner of War camp in Traunstein as a guard.{{sfn|Ullrich|2016|p=75}} There he would stay until the camp dissolved January 1919.{{efn|name=guard duty}}\n\nHe returned to Munich and spent a few months in barracks waiting for reassignment. During this time in Munich there were a number of assassinations, including socialist [[Kurt Eisner]]{{efn|name=KurtEisner}} who was shot dead by a German nationalist on 21 February 1919. His rival [[Erhard Auer]] was also wounded in an attack. Other acts of violence were the killings of both Major Paul Ritter von Jahrei\u00df and the conservative MP [[:de:Heinrich Osel|Heinrich Osel]]. In this political chaos Berlin sent in the military \u2013 called the \"White Guards of Capitalism\" by the communists. On 3 April 1919, Hitler was elected as the liaison of his military battalion and again on 15 April. During this time he urged his unit to stay out of the fighting and not join either side.{{sfn|Ullrich|2016|p=79}} The [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] was officially crushed on 6 May 1919, when Lt. General Burghard von Oven and his forces declared the city secure. In the aftermath of arrests and executions, Hitler denounced a fellow liaison, Georg Dufter, as a Soviet \"radical rabble-rouser.\"{{sfn|Ullrich|2016|p=80}} Other testimony he gave to the military board of inquiry allowed them to root out other members of the military that \"had been infected with revolutionary fervor.\"{{sfn|Mitchell|2013|p=37}} For his anti-communist views he was allowed to avoid discharge when his unit was disbanded in May 1919.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=34}}{{efn|name=political department}}\n\nIn June 1919 Hitler was moved to the demobilization office of the 2nd Infantry Regiment. Around this time the German military command released an edict that the army's main priority was to \"carry out, in conjunction with the police, stricter surveillance of the population ... so that the ignition of any new unrest can be discovered and extinguished.\"{{sfn|Ullrich|2016|p=80}} In May 1919 [[Karl Mayr]] became commander of the 6th Battalion of the guards regiment in Munich and from 30 May the head of the \"Education and Propaganda Department\" of the General Command von Oven and the Group Command No. 4 (Department Ib). In this capacity as head of the intelligence department, Mayr recruited Hitler as an undercover agent in early June 1919. Under Captain Mayr \"national thinking\" courses were arranged at the Reichswehrlager Lechfeld near Augsburg,{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=72\u201374}} with Hitler attending from 10\u201319 July.

The DAP had been formed by [[Anton Drexler]], [[Karl Harrer]] and others, through amalgamation of other groups, on 5 January 1919 at a small gathering in Munich at the restaurant Fuerstenfelder Hof. While he studied the activities of the DAP, Hitler became impressed with Drexler's antisemitic, nationalist, [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] and anti-Marxist ideas.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}}\n[[File:Hitler's DAP membership card.png|thumb|Hitler's membership card for the German Workers' Party (DAP)]]\nDuring the 12 September 1919 meeting,{{efn|name=beer hall meeting}} Hitler took umbrage with comments made by an audience member that were directed against [[Gottfried Feder]], the speaker, a crank economist with whom Hitler was acquainted due to a lecture Feder delivered in an army \"education\" course.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=35}}{{efn|name=Feder}} The audience member (Hitler in ''Mein Kampf'' disparagingly called him the \"professor\") asserted that [[Bavaria]] should be wholly independent from Germany and should secede from Germany and unite with [[Austria]] to form a new South German nation.{{efn|name=South German Nation}} The volatile Hitler arose and scolded the unfortunate Professor Baumann, using his speaking skills and eventually causing Baumann to leave the meeting before its adjournment.{{sfn|Hitler|1999|p=219}}{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=75}} Impressed with Hitler's oratory skills, Drexler encouraged him to join the DAP. On the orders of his army superiors, Hitler applied to join the party.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=170}} Within a week, Hitler received a postcard stating he had officially been accepted as a member and he should come to a \"committee\" meeting to discuss it. Hitler attended the \"committee\" meeting held at the run-down Alte Rosenbad beer-house.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=75, 76}} Later Hitler wrote that joining the fledgling party \"...was the most decisive resolve of my life. From here there was and could be no turning back. ...&nbsp;I registered as a member of the German Workers' Party and received a provisional membership card with the number 7\".{{sfn|Hitler|1999|p=224}} Normally, enlisted army personnel were not allowed to join political parties. However, in this case, Hitler had Captain Mayr's permission to join the DAP. Further, Hitler was allowed to stay in the army and receive his weekly pay of 20 gold marks.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=76}}\n\n===From early party membership to the Hofbr\u00e4uhaus Mel\u00e9e (November 1921)===\n{{quote box| quote = ''[[Otto Strasser]]'': What is the program of the NSDAP?<br />''Hitler'': The program is not the question.

Only Hitler was able to bring in the crowds for the party speeches and meetings. By this time, the police were already monitoring the speeches, and their own surviving records reveal that Hitler delivered lectures with titles such as ''Political Phenomenon, Jews and the [[Treaty of Versailles]]''. At the end of the year, party membership was recorded at 2,000.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=88\u201389}}\n\nIn June 1921, while Hitler and [[Dietrich Eckart]] were on a fundraising trip to Berlin, a mutiny broke out within the Nazi Party in Munich, its organizational home. Members of its executive committee wanted to merge with the rival [[German Socialist Party]] (DSP).{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=100\u2013101}} Hitler returned to Munich on 11 July and angrily tendered his resignation.

This federalist organization objected to the centralism of the Weimar Constitution but accepted its social program. The League was led by [[Otto Ballerstedt]], an engineer whom Hitler regarded as \"my most dangerous opponent\". One Nazi, [[Hermann Esser]], climbed upon a chair and shouted that the Jews were to blame for the misfortunes of Bavaria and the Nazis shouted demands that Ballerstedt yield the floor to Hitler.{{sfn|Toland|1976|pp=112\u2013113}} The Nazis beat up Ballerstedt and shoved him off the stage into the audience.

In May 1923, elements loyal to Hitler within the army helped the SA to procure a barracks and its weaponry, but the order to march never came.\n\nA pivotal moment came when Hitler led the [[Beer Hall Putsch]], an attempted ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' on 8\u20139 November 1923. [[List of Nazis who died in the Beer Hall Putsch|Sixteen Nazi Party members]] and four police officers were killed in the failed [[coup]].

In the [[May 1924 German federal election]] the party gained seats in the Reichstag, with 6.6% (1,918,329) voting for the Movement. In the [[December 1924 German federal election]] the National Socialist Freedom Movement (NSFB) (Combination of the ''Deutschv\u00f6lkische Freiheitspartei'' (DVFP) and the Nazi Party (NSDAP)) lost 18 seats, only holding on to 14 seats, with 3% (907,242) of the electorate voting for Hitler's party. The [[Barmat Scandal]] was often used later in Nazi propaganda, both as an electoral strategy and as an appeal to anti-Semitism.\n\nHitler had determined, after some reflection, that power was to be achieved not through revolution outside of the government, but rather through legal means, within the confines of the democratic system established by Weimar.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nFor five to six years there would be no further prohibitions of the party (''see below'' [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power#Seizure of control (1931 - 1933)|Seizure of Control: (1931\u20131933)]]).\n\n==Move towards power (1925\u20131930)==\nIn the [[1928 German federal election|German election, May 1928]] the Party achieved just 12 seats in the Reichstag.{{sfn|Kolb|2005|pp=224\u2013225}} The highest provincial gain was again in Bavaria (5.1%), though in three areas the Nazis failed to gain even 1% of the vote.

Despite being discouraged by his publisher, he wrote a second book that was discovered and released posthumously as the ''[[Zweites Buch]]''. At this time the SA began a period of deliberate antagonism to the Rotfront by marching into Communist strongholds and starting violent altercations.\n\nAt the end of 1928, party membership was recorded at 130,000. In March 1929, [[Erich Ludendorff]] represented the Nazi Party in the Presidential elections. He gained 280,000 votes (1.1%), and was the only candidate to poll fewer than a million votes. The battles on the streets grew increasingly violent. After the Rotfront interrupted a speech by Hitler, the SA marched into the streets of Nuremberg and killed two bystanders. In a tit-for-tat action, the SA stormed a Rotfront meeting on 25 August and days later the Berlin headquarters of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) itself. In September [[Goebbels]] led his men into [[Neuk\u00f6lln]], a KPD stronghold, and the two warring parties exchanged pistol and revolver fire.\n\nThe [[1929 German referendum|German referendum of 1929]] was important as it gained the Nazi Party recognition and credibility it never had before.<ref>Nicholls, A.J.

It stemmed from a 1929 article by Goebbels in his newspaper ''[[Der Angriff]]''.

Well over one million pamphlets were produced and distributed; sixty trucks were commandeered for use in Berlin alone. In areas where Nazi campaigning was less rigorous, the total was as low as 9%. [[The Great Depression]] was also a factor in Hitler's electoral success.

The Social Democrats were essentially a conservative trade union party, with ineffectual leadership. The [[Catholic Centre Party]] maintained its voting block, but was preoccupied with defending its own particular interests and, wrote Bullock: \"through 1932-3&nbsp;... was so far from recognizing the danger of a Nazi dictatorship that it continued to negotiate with the Nazis\". The Communists meanwhile were engaging in violent clashes with Nazis on the streets, but Moscow had directed the Communist Party to prioritise destruction of the Social Democrats, seeing more danger in them as a rival for the loyalty of the working class. Nevertheless, wrote Bullock, the heaviest responsibility lay with the German right wing, who \"forsook a true conservatism\" and made Hitler their partner in a coalition government.{{sfn|Bullock|1991|pp=138\u2013139}}\n\n[[File:PapenSchleicher0001.jpg|thumb|Chancellor [[Franz von Papen]] (left) with his eventual successor, the Minister of Defence [[Kurt von Schleicher]]]]\n\nThe Centre Party's [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]] was Chancellor from 1930 to 1932.

Street fights and beer hall battles resulting in deaths occurred throughout February and April 1932, all against the backdrop of Adolf Hitler's competition in the [[1932 German presidential election|presidential election]] which pitted him against the monumentally popular Hindenburg. In the first round on 13 March, Hitler had polled over 11 million votes but was still behind Hindenburg.

After less than a month the law was repealed on 30 May by [[Franz von Papen]], Chancellor of Germany. Such ambivalence about the fate of Jews was supported by the culture of anti-Semitism that pervaded the German public at the time.\n\nIn the [[July 1932 German federal election|federal election of July 1932]], the Nazis won 37.3% of the popular vote (13,745,000 votes), an upswing by 19 percent, becoming the largest party in the Reichstag, with 230 out of 608 seats.{{sfn|Kolb|2005|pp=224\u2013225}} Dwarfed by Hitler's electoral gains, the KPD turned away from legal means and increasingly towards violence. One resulting battle in Silesia resulted in the army being dispatched, each shot sending Germany further into a potential civil war. By this time both sides marched into each other's strongholds hoping to spark a rivalry. The attacks continued and reached fever pitch when SA leader Axel Schaffeld was assassinated on 1 August.\n\nAs the Nazi Party was now the largest party in the Reichstag, it was entitled to select the President of the Reichstag and were able to elect G\u00f6ring for the post.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=297}} Energised by the success, Hitler asked to be made chancellor. Hitler was offered the job of vice-chancellor by Chancellor Papen at the behest of President Hindenburg but he refused. Hitler saw this offer as placing him in a position of \"playing second fiddle\" in the government.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=233, 234}}\n\nIn his position of Reichstag president, G\u00f6ring asked that decisive measures be taken by the government over the spate in murders of Nazi Party members. On 9 August, amendments were made to the ''Reichstrafgesetzbuch'' statute on 'acts of political violence', increasing the penalty to 'lifetime imprisonment, 20 years hard labour or death'. Special courts were announced to try such offences. When in power less than half a year later, Hitler would use this legislation against his opponents with devastating effect.\n\nThe law was applied almost immediately but did not bring the perpetrators behind the recent massacres to trial as expected. Instead, five SA men who were alleged to have murdered a KPD member in Potempa ([[Upper Silesia]]) were tried. Hitler appeared at the trial as a defence witness, but on 22 August the five were convicted and sentenced to death. On appeal, this sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in early September. They served just over four months before Hitler freed all imprisoned Nazis in a 1933 amnesty.\n\nThe Nazi Party lost 35 seats in the [[November 1932 German federal election|November 1932 election]], but remained the Reichstag's largest party, with 196 seats (33.1%). The Social Democrats (SPD) won 121 seats (20.4%) and the Communists (KPD) won 100 (16.9%).\n\nThe [[Communist International]] described all moderate left-wing parties as \"[[social fascists]]\" and urged the Communists to devote their energies to the destruction of the moderate left. As a result, the KPD, following orders from Moscow, rejected overtures from the Social Democrats to form a political alliance against the NSDAP.\n\nAfter Chancellor Papen left office, he secretly told Hitler that he still held considerable sway with President Hindenburg and that he would make Hitler chancellor as long as he, Papen, could be the vice chancellor. Another notable event was the publication of the ''[[Industrielleneingabe]]'', a letter signed by 22 important representatives of industry, finance and agriculture, asking Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as chancellor. Hindenburg reluctantly agreed to appoint Hitler as chancellor after the parliamentary elections of July and November 1932 had not resulted in the formation of a majority government. Hitler headed a short-lived coalition government formed by the NSDAP and the [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP).\n\nOn 30 January 1933, the new cabinet was sworn in during a brief ceremony in Hindenburg's office. The NSDAP gained three posts: Hitler was named chancellor, [[Wilhelm Frick]] Minister of the Interior, and Hermann G\u00f6ring, [[Minister Without Portfolio]] (and Minister of the Interior for Prussia).{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=184}}{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=92}} The SA and SS led torchlit parades throughout Berlin. It is this event that would become termed Hitler's ''[[:wikt:Machtergreifung|Machtergreifung]]'' (\"seizure of power\"). The term was originally used by some Nazis to suggest a revolutionary process,{{sfn|=Stachura Introduction|2015|p=6}} though Hitler, and others, used the word ''{{lang|de|Macht\u00fcbernahme}}'' (\"take-over of power\"), reflecting that the transfer of power took place within the existing constitutional framework{{sfn|=Stachura Introduction|2015|p=6}} and suggesting that the process was legal.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pages=569, 580ff}}{{sfn|Frei|1983}}\n\nPapen was to serve as Vice-Chancellor in a majority conservative Cabinet \u2013 still falsely believing that he could \"tame\" Hitler.{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}} Initially, Papen did [[Marburg speech|speak out]] against some Nazi excesses. However, after narrowly escaping death in the [[Night of the Long Knives]] in 1934, he no longer dared criticise the regime and was sent off to Vienna as German ambassador.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nBoth within Germany and abroad, there were initially few fears that Hitler could use his position to establish his later dictatorial single-party regime. Rather, the conservatives that helped to make him chancellor were convinced that they could control Hitler and \"tame\" the Nazi Party while setting the relevant impulses in the government themselves; foreign ambassadors played down worries by emphasizing that Hitler was \"mediocre\" if not a bad copy of [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]; even SPD politician [[Kurt Schumacher]] trivialized Hitler as a \"Dekorationsst\u00fcck\" (\"piece of scenery/decoration\") of the new government. German newspapers wrote that, without doubt, the Hitler-led government would try to fight its political enemies (the left-wing parties), but that it would be impossible to establish a dictatorship in Germany because there was \"a barrier, over which violence cannot proceed\" and because of the German nation being proud of \"the freedom of speech and thought\".

In a declaration of 30 January, the steering committee of the central Jewish German organization (''Centralverein deutscher Staatsb\u00fcrger j\u00fcdischen Glaubens'') wrote that \"as a matter of course\" the Jewish community faces the new government \"with the largest mistrust\", but at the same they were convinced that \"nobody would dare to touch [their] constitutional rights\".

The Communists were excluded from the Reichstag. At the [[March 1933 German federal election|March 1933 elections]], again no single party secured a majority. Hitler required the vote of the Centre Party and Conservatives in the Reichstag to obtain the powers he desired. He called on Reichstag members to vote for the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] on 24 March 1933. Hitler was granted [[plenary powers]] \"temporarily\" by the passage of the Act.{{sfn|Bullock|1991|pp=147\u2013148}} The law gave him the freedom to act without parliamentary consent and even without constitutional limitations.{{sfn|Hoffmann|1977|p=7}}\n\nEmploying his characteristic mix of negotiation and intimidation, Hitler offered the possibility of friendly co-operation, promising not to threaten the Reichstag, the President, the States or the Churches if granted the emergency powers. With Nazi paramilitary encircling the building, he said: \"It is for you, gentlemen of the Reichstag to decide between war and peace\".{{sfn|Bullock|1991|pp=147\u2013148}} The Centre Party, having obtained promises of non-interference in religion, joined with conservatives in voting for the Act (only the Social Democrats voted against).{{sfn|Bullock|1991|pp=138, 148}}\n\nThe Act allowed Hitler and his Cabinet to rule by emergency decree for four years, though Hindenburg remained President.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=354}} Hitler immediately set about abolishing the powers of the [[States of Germany|states]] and the existence of non-Nazi political parties and organisations. Non-Nazi parties were formally outlawed on 14 July 1933, and the Reichstag abdicated its democratic responsibilities.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=200\u2013201}} Hindenburg remained commander-in-chief of the military and retained the power to negotiate foreign treaties.\n\nThe Act did not infringe upon the powers of the President, and Hitler would not fully achieve full dictatorial power until after the death of Hindenburg in August 1934.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=226\u2013227}} Journalists and diplomats wondered whether Hitler could appoint himself President, who might succeed him as Chancellor, and what the army would do. They did not know that the army supported Hitler after the Night of the Long Knives, or expect that he would combine the two positions of President and Chancellor into one office. Only Hitler, as head of state, could dismiss Hitler as head of the government.
