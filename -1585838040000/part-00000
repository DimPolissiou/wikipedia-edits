Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!-- ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020 --> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!-- ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020 --> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Initial analysis of the discovery concluded that the eastern province of Saudi Arabia was the homeland of the earliest settlers of Mesopotamia, and by extension, the likely origin of the Sumerians. However, experts such as Joan Oates had the opportunity to see the Ubaid period sherds in eastern Arabia and consequently conclude that the sherds dates to the last two phases of Ubaid period (period three and four), while handful examples could be classified roughly as either Ubaid 3 or Ubaid 2. Thus the idea that colonists from Saudi Arabia had emigrated to southern Mesopotamia and founded the region's first sedentary culture was abandoned.<ref>Roads of Arabia p. 175.</ref>\n\nClimatic change and the onset of aridity may have brought about the end of this phase of settlement, as little archaeological evidence exists from the succeeding millennium.<ref>Roads of Arabia p. 176.</ref> The settlement of the region picks up again in the period of [[Dilmun]] in the early 3rd millennium. Known records from Uruk refer to a place called [[Dilmun]], associated in several occasions with copper and in later period it was a source of imported woods in southern Mesopotamia. A number of scholars have suggested that Dilmun originally designated the eastern province of Saudi Arabia, notably linked with the major Dilmunite settlements of Umm an-Nussi and Umm ar-Ramadh in the interior and Tarout on the coast. It is likely that [[Tarout Island]] was the main port and the capital of Dilmun.<ref name=\"Roads of Arabia p. 180\"/> Mesopotamian inscribed clay tablets suggests that, in the early period of Dilmun, a form of hierarchical organized political structure existed. In 1966 an earthworks in Tarout exposed ancient burial field that yielded a large impressive statue dating to the Dilmunite period (mid 3rd millennium BC). The statue was locally made under strong Mesopotamian influence on the artistic principle of Dilmun.<ref name=\"Roads of Arabia p. 180\"/>\n\nBy 2200 BC, the centre of Dilmun shifted for unknown reasons from Tarout and the Saudi Arabian mainland to the island of [[Bahrain]], and a major developed settlements appeared in Bahrain for the first time, where a laborious temple complex and thousands of burial mounds that dates to this period were discovered.<ref name=\"Roads of Arabia p. 180\"/>\n\n[[File:Figures Five Kings of Midian Slain by Israel.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Five kings of Midian slain by Israel (illustration from the 1728 ''Figures de la Bible'')]]\nBy the Late Bronze Age, a historically recorded people and land (Median and the Medianites) in the north-western portion of Saudi Arabia are well-documented in the Bible.

At the same time, the Ikhwan became disenchanted with Ibn Saud's domestic policies which appeared to favor modernization and the increase in the number of non-Muslim foreigners in the country.

Oil provided Saudi Arabia with economic prosperity and substantial political leverage internationally.<ref name=\"Britannica history\" />\n\nCultural life rapidly developed, primarily in the Hejaz, which was the center for newspapers and radio.

In 1972, Saudi Arabia gained a 20 percent control in Aramco, thereby decreasing US control over Saudi oil.\n\nIn 1973, Saudi Arabia led an oil boycott against the Western countries that supported Israel in the [[Yom Kippur War]] against Egypt and Syria.

The first was the [[Iranian Revolution|Iranian Islamic Revolution]]. It was feared that the country's [[Shi'a Islam in Saudi Arabia|Shi'ite minority]] in the [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]] (which is also the location of the oil fields) might rebel under the influence of their Iranian co-religionists.

He was succeeded by his brother, [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]], who added the title \"Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques\" to his name in 1986 in response to considerable fundamentalist pressure to avoid use of \"majesty\" in association with anything except God. Fahd continued to develop close relations with the United States and increased the purchase of American and British military equipment.<ref name=\"Britannica history\"/>\n\nThe vast wealth generated by oil revenues was beginning to have an even greater impact on Saudi society. It led to rapid technological (but not cultural) modernisation, urbanization, mass public education and the creation of new media. This and the presence of increasingly large numbers of foreign workers greatly affected traditional Saudi norms and values. Although there was dramatic change in the social and economic life of the country, political power continued to be monopolized by the royal family<ref name=\"Britannica history\"/> leading to discontent among many Saudis who began to look for wider participation in government.<ref>[[#Abir1993|Abir (1993)]], p. 114</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, Saudi Arabia spent $25 billion in support of [[Saddam Hussein]] in the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]].<ref>Robert Fisk (2005) ''[[The Great War For Civilisation]]''.

In 1991, Saudi Arabian forces were involved both in bombing raids on Iraq and in the land invasion that helped to liberate Kuwait.\n\nSaudi Arabia's relations with the West began to cause growing concern among some of the ulema and students of sharia law and was one of the issues that led to [[List of militant incidents in Saudi Arabia|an increase in Islamist terrorism]] in Saudi Arabia, as well as [[Islamic terrorism|Islamist terrorist attacks]] in Western countries by Saudi nationals.

Although now extremely wealthy, Saudi Arabia's economy was near stagnant. High taxes and a growth in unemployment have contributed to discontent, and has been reflected in a rise in civil unrest, and discontent with the royal family. In response, a number of limited \"reforms\" were initiated by King Fahd. In March 1992, he introduced the \"[[Basic Law of Saudi Arabia|Basic Law]]\", which emphasised the duties and responsibilities of a ruler. In December 1993, the Consultative Council was inaugurated. It is composed of a chairman and 60 members\u2014all chosen by the King. The King's intent was to respond to dissent while making as few actual changes in the status quo as possible.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Fahd made it clear that he did not have democracy in mind: \"A system based on elections is not consistent with our Islamic creed, which [approves of] government by consultation [sh\u016br\u0101].\"<ref name=\"Britannica history\" />\n\nIn 1995, Fahd suffered a debilitating stroke, and the Crown Prince, [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|Abdullah]], assumed the role of ''de facto'' [[regent]], taking on the day-to-day running of the country.

In February 2009, [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|Abdullah]] announced a series of governmental changes to the judiciary, armed forces, and various ministries to modernize these institutions including the

Saudi Arabia maintains a list of sectors in which foreign investment is prohibited, but the government plans to open some closed sectors such as telecommunications, insurance, and power transmission/distribution over time.\n\nThe government has also made an attempt at \"[[Saudization|Saudizing]]\" the economy, replacing foreign workers with Saudi nationals with limited success.<ref name=house-161>[[#House|House]], p. 161: \"Over the past decade, the government has announced one plan after another to 'Saudize' the economy, but to no avail.

Al-Hasa has over 30 million palm trees which produce over 100 thousand tons of dates every year.]]\n\nSerious large-scale agricultural development began in the 1970s. The government launched an extensive program to promote modern farming technology; to establish rural roads, irrigation networks and storage and export facilities; and to encourage agricultural research and training institutions.\nAs a result, there has been a phenomenal growth in the production of all basic foods. Saudi Arabia is now completely self-sufficient in a number of foodstuffs, including meat, milk and eggs.\nThe country exports wheat, dates, dairy products, eggs, fish, poultry, fruits, vegetables and flowers to markets around the world. Dates, once a staple of the Saudi diet, are now mainly grown for global humanitarian aid.\nIn addition, Saudi farmers grow substantial amounts of other grains such as barley, sorghum and millet. As of 2016, in the interest of preserving precious water resources, domestic production of wheat has ended.<ref>{{cite web |title=Saudi Arabia ends domestic wheat production program|url = https://www.world-grain.com/articles/6275-saudi-arabia-ends-domestic-wheat-production-program|accessdate=8 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Kingdom likewise has some of the most modern and largest dairy farms in the Middle East. Milk production boasts a remarkably productive annual rate of 1,800 gallons per cow, one of the highest in the world. The local dairy manufacturing company [[Almarai]] is the largest vertically integrated dairy company in the Middle East.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elopak.com/site/cms.jsp?node=11449|title=Innovation Drive Al-Marai|publisher=Elopak|accessdate=3 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113093305/http://www.elopak.com/site/cms.jsp?node=11449|archivedate=13 November 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Kingdom's most dramatic agricultural accomplishment, noted worldwide, was its rapid transformation from importer to exporter of wheat. In 1978, the country built its first grain silos. By 1984, it had become self-sufficient in wheat. Shortly thereafter, Saudi Arabia began exporting wheat to some 30 countries, including China and the former Soviet Union, and in the major producing areas of Tabuk, Hail and Qasim, average yields reached 3.6 tons per acre.\nThe Kingdom has, however, stepped up fruit and vegetable production, by improving both agricultural techniques and the roads that link farmers with urban consumers. Saudi Arabia is a major exporter of fruits and vegetables to its neighbors. Among its most productive crops are watermelon, grapes, citrus fruits, onions, squash and tomatoes. At Jizan in the country's well-watered southwest, the Al-Hikmah Research Station is producing tropical fruits including pineapples, paw-paws, bananas, mangoes and guavas.<ref>{{cite web |title=Agriculture & Water|url = https://www.saudiembassy.net/agriculture-water |accessdate=8 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[olive]] tree is indigenous to Saudi Arabia.

About 50% of drinking water comes from desalination, 40% from the mining of non-renewable groundwater and 10% from surface water, especially in the mountainous southwest of the country. The capital [[Riyadh]], located in the heart of the country, is supplied with desalinated water pumped from the [[Persian Gulf]] over a distance of 467&nbsp;km. Given the substantial [[Economy of Saudi Arabia|oil wealth]], water is provided almost for free. Despite improvements service quality remains poor. For example, in Riyadh water was available only once every 2.5 days in 2011, while in Jeddah it is available only every 9 days.<ref name=\"GWI April 2011\">Global Water Intelligence: Becoming a world-class water utility, April 2011</ref> Institutional capacity and [[governance]] in the sector are weak, reflecting general characteristics of the public sector in Saudi Arabia. Since 2000, the government has increasingly relied on the private sector to operate water and sanitation infrastructure, beginning with desalination and wastewater treatment plants. Since 2008, the operation of urban water distribution systems is being gradually delegated to private companies as well.\n\n===Tourism===\n{{Main|Tourism in Saudi Arabia}}\n\nAlthough most tourism in Saudi Arabia still largely involves religious pilgrimages, there is growth in the leisure tourism sector.

The predominantly loose and flowing, but covering, garments are suited to Saudi Arabia's [[desert]] climate. Traditionally, men usually wear a white ankle length garment woven from wool or cotton (known as a [[thawb]]), with a [[keffiyeh]] (a large checkered square of cotton held in place by an [[agal]]) or a [[Keffiyeh|ghutra]] (a plain white square made of finer cotton, also held in place by an [[agal]]) worn on the head. For rare chilly days, Saudi men wear a [[camel]]-hair cloak ([[bisht (clothing)|bisht]]) over the top. In public women are required to wear a black [[abaya]] or other black clothing that covers everything under the neck with the exception of their hands and feet, although most women cover their head in respect for their religion. This requirement applies to non-Muslim women too and failure to abide can result in police action, particularly in more conservative areas of the country. Women's clothes are often decorated with tribal motifs, coins, sequins, metallic thread, and appliques.\n* [[Ghutrah]] ({{lang-ar|\u063a\u062a\u0631\u0647}}) is a traditional [[headdress]] typically worn by [[Arab]] men. It is made of a square of cloth (\"scarf\"), usually cotton, folded and wrapped in various styles around the head. It is commonly worn in areas with an [[arid]] climate, to provide protection from direct [[sun exposure]], and also protection of the mouth and eyes from blown dust and [[sand]].\n* [[Agal]] ({{lang-ar|\u0639\u0642\u0627\u0644}}) is an item of [[Arab]] headgear constructed of cord which is fastened around the [[Ghutrah]] to hold it in place. The ''agal'' is usually black in colour.\n* [[Thawb]] ({{lang-ar|\u062b\u0648\u0628}}) is the standard Arabic word for garment. It is ankle-length, usually with long sleeves, similar to a [[robe]].\n* [[Bisht (clothing)|Bisht]] ({{lang-ar|\u0628\u0634\u062a}}) is a traditional Arabic men's [[cloak]] usually only worn for prestige on special occasions such as weddings.\n* [[Abaya]] ({{lang-ar|\u0639\u0628\u0627\u0626\u0629}}) is a woman's garment. It is a black cloak which loosely covers the entire body except the head. Some women choose to cover their faces with a niq\u0101b and some do not. Some abayas cover the top of the head as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelovelyplanet.net/traditional-dress-of-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia/ |title=Traditional dress of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia |date=29 September 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018115808/http://www.thelovelyplanet.net/traditional-dress-of-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia/ |archivedate=18 October 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Arts and entertainment===\n{{Main|Saudi Arabian art|Cinema of Saudi Arabia|Music of Saudi Arabia|Theatre in Saudi Arabia}}\n[[File:King Abdullah in his youth.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|King Abdullah practising [[falconry]], a traditional pursuit in the country]]\n\nDuring the 1970s, cinemas were numerous in the Kingdom although they were seen as contrary to Wahhabi norms.<ref name=\"Return of cinema in Saudi Arabia provokes critics\">[http://worldfocus.org/blog/2009/01/05/return-of-cinema-in-saudi-arabia-provokes-critics/3473/ World Focus]. 5 January 2009</ref> During the [[Islamic revival]] movement in the 1980s, and as a political response to an increase in [[Islamist]] activism including the 1979 [[Grand Mosque Seizure|seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca]], the government closed all cinemas and theaters.

With the advent of oil-wealth in the 20th century came exposure to outside influences, such as Western housing styles, furnishings, and clothes. Music and dance have always been part of Saudi life. Traditional music is generally associated with poetry and is sung collectively. Instruments include the rab\u0101bah, an instrument not unlike a three-string fiddle, and various types of percussion instruments, such as the \u1e6dabl (drum) and the \u1e6d\u0101r (tambourine). Of the native dances, the most popular is a martial line dance known as the \u02bfar\u1e0dah, which includes lines of men, frequently armed with swords or rifles, dancing to the beat of drums and tambourines.

Initial analysis of the discovery concluded that the eastern province of Saudi Arabia was the homeland of the earliest settlers of Mesopotamia, and by extension, the likely origin of the Sumerians. However, experts such as Joan Oates had the opportunity to see the Ubaid period sherds in eastern Arabia and consequently conclude that the sherds dates to the last two phases of Ubaid period (period three and four), while handful examples could be classified roughly as either Ubaid 3 or Ubaid 2. Thus the idea that colonists from Saudi Arabia had emigrated to southern Mesopotamia and founded the region's first sedentary culture was abandoned.<ref>Roads of Arabia p. 175.</ref>\n\nClimatic change and the onset of aridity may have brought about the end of this phase of settlement, as little archaeological evidence exists from the succeeding millennium.<ref>Roads of Arabia p. 176.</ref> The settlement of the region picks up again in the period of [[Dilmun]] in the early 3rd millennium. Known records from Uruk refer to a place called [[Dilmun]], associated in several occasions with copper and in later period it was a source of imported woods in southern Mesopotamia. A number of scholars have suggested that Dilmun originally designated the eastern province of Saudi Arabia, notably linked with the major Dilmunite settlements of Umm an-Nussi and Umm ar-Ramadh in the interior and Tarout on the coast. It is likely that [[Tarout Island]] was the main port and the capital of Dilmun.<ref name=\"Roads of Arabia p. 180\"/> Mesopotamian inscribed clay tablets suggests that, in the early period of Dilmun, a form of hierarchical organized political structure existed. In 1966 an earthworks in Tarout exposed ancient burial field that yielded a large impressive statue dating to the Dilmunite period (mid 3rd millennium BC). The statue was locally made under strong Mesopotamian influence on the artistic principle of Dilmun.<ref name=\"Roads of Arabia p. 180\"/>\n\nBy 2200 BC, the centre of Dilmun shifted for unknown reasons from Tarout and the Saudi Arabian mainland to the island of [[Bahrain]], and a major developed settlements appeared in Bahrain for the first time, where a laborious temple complex and thousands of burial mounds that dates to this period were discovered.<ref name=\"Roads of Arabia p. 180\"/>\n\n[[File:Figures Five Kings of Midian Slain by Israel.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Five kings of Midian slain by Israel (illustration from the 1728 ''Figures de la Bible'')]]\nBy the Late Bronze Age, a historically recorded people and land (Median and the Medianites) in the north-western portion of Saudi Arabia are well-documented in the Bible.

Saudi Arabia maintains a list of sectors in which foreign investment is prohibited, but the government plans to open some closed sectors such as telecommunications, insurance, and power transmission/distribution over time.\n\nThe government has also made an attempt at \"[[Saudization|Saudizing]]\" the economy, replacing foreign workers with Saudi nationals with limited success.<ref name=house-161>[[#House|House]], p. 161: \"Over the past decade, the government has announced one plan after another to 'Saudize' the economy, but to no avail.

Al-Hasa has over 30 million palm trees which produce over 100 thousand tons of dates every year.]]\n\nSerious large-scale agricultural development began in the 1970s. The government launched an extensive program to promote modern farming technology; to establish rural roads, irrigation networks and storage and export facilities; and to encourage agricultural research and training institutions.\nAs a result, there has been a phenomenal growth in the production of all basic foods. Saudi Arabia is now completely self-sufficient in a number of foodstuffs, including meat, milk and eggs.\nThe country exports wheat, dates, dairy products, eggs, fish, poultry, fruits, vegetables and flowers to markets around the world. Dates, once a staple of the Saudi diet, are now mainly grown for global humanitarian aid.\nIn addition, Saudi farmers grow substantial amounts of other grains such as barley, sorghum and millet. As of 2016, in the interest of preserving precious water resources, domestic production of wheat has ended.<ref>{{cite web |title=Saudi Arabia ends domestic wheat production program|url = https://www.world-grain.com/articles/6275-saudi-arabia-ends-domestic-wheat-production-program|accessdate=8 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Kingdom likewise has some of the most modern and largest dairy farms in the Middle East. Milk production boasts a remarkably productive annual rate of 1,800 gallons per cow, one of the highest in the world. The local dairy manufacturing company [[Almarai]] is the largest vertically integrated dairy company in the Middle East.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elopak.com/site/cms.jsp?node=11449|title=Innovation Drive Al-Marai|publisher=Elopak|accessdate=3 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113093305/http://www.elopak.com/site/cms.jsp?node=11449|archivedate=13 November 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Kingdom's most dramatic agricultural accomplishment, noted worldwide, was its rapid transformation from importer to exporter of wheat. In 1978, the country built its first grain silos. By 1984, it had become self-sufficient in wheat. Shortly thereafter, Saudi Arabia began exporting wheat to some 30 countries, including China and the former Soviet Union, and in the major producing areas of Tabuk, Hail and Qasim, average yields reached 3.6 tons per acre.\nThe Kingdom has, however, stepped up fruit and vegetable production, by improving both agricultural techniques and the roads that link farmers with urban consumers. Saudi Arabia is a major exporter of fruits and vegetables to its neighbors. Among its most productive crops are watermelon, grapes, citrus fruits, onions, squash and tomatoes. At Jizan in the country's well-watered southwest, the Al-Hikmah Research Station is producing tropical fruits including pineapples, paw-paws, bananas, mangoes and guavas.<ref>{{cite web |title=Agriculture & Water|url = https://www.saudiembassy.net/agriculture-water |accessdate=8 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[olive]] tree is indigenous to Saudi Arabia.

About 50% of drinking water comes from desalination, 40% from the mining of non-renewable groundwater and 10% from surface water, especially in the mountainous southwest of the country. The capital [[Riyadh]], located in the heart of the country, is supplied with desalinated water pumped from the [[Persian Gulf]] over a distance of 467&nbsp;km. Given the substantial [[Economy of Saudi Arabia|oil wealth]], water is provided almost for free. Despite improvements service quality remains poor. For example, in Riyadh water was available only once every 2.5 days in 2011, while in Jeddah it is available only every 9 days.<ref name=\"GWI April 2011\">Global Water Intelligence: Becoming a world-class water utility, April 2011</ref> Institutional capacity and [[governance]] in the sector are weak, reflecting general characteristics of the public sector in Saudi Arabia. Since 2000, the government has increasingly relied on the private sector to operate water and sanitation infrastructure, beginning with desalination and wastewater treatment plants. Since 2008, the operation of urban water distribution systems is being gradually delegated to private companies as well.\n\n===Tourism===\n{{Main|Tourism in Saudi Arabia}}\n\nAlthough most tourism in Saudi Arabia still largely involves religious pilgrimages, there is growth in the leisure tourism sector.

The predominantly loose and flowing, but covering, garments are suited to Saudi Arabia's [[desert]] climate. Traditionally, men usually wear a white ankle length garment woven from wool or cotton (known as a [[thawb]]), with a [[keffiyeh]] (a large checkered square of cotton held in place by an [[agal]]) or a [[Keffiyeh|ghutra]] (a plain white square made of finer cotton, also held in place by an [[agal]]) worn on the head. For rare chilly days, Saudi men wear a [[camel]]-hair cloak ([[bisht (clothing)|bisht]]) over the top. In public women are required to wear a black [[abaya]] or other black clothing that covers everything under the neck with the exception of their hands and feet, although most women cover their head in respect for their religion. This requirement applies to non-Muslim women too and failure to abide can result in police action, particularly in more conservative areas of the country. Women's clothes are often decorated with tribal motifs, coins, sequins, metallic thread, and appliques.\n* [[Ghutrah]] ({{lang-ar|\u063a\u062a\u0631\u0647}}) is a traditional [[headdress]] typically worn by [[Arab]] men. It is made of a square of cloth (\"scarf\"), usually cotton, folded and wrapped in various styles around the head. It is commonly worn in areas with an [[arid]] climate, to provide protection from direct [[sun exposure]], and also protection of the mouth and eyes from blown dust and [[sand]].\n* [[Agal]] ({{lang-ar|\u0639\u0642\u0627\u0644}}) is an item of [[Arab]] headgear constructed of cord which is fastened around the [[Ghutrah]] to hold it in place. The ''agal'' is usually black in colour.\n* [[Thawb]] ({{lang-ar|\u062b\u0648\u0628}}) is the standard Arabic word for garment. It is ankle-length, usually with long sleeves, similar to a [[robe]].\n* [[Bisht (clothing)|Bisht]] ({{lang-ar|\u0628\u0634\u062a}}) is a traditional Arabic men's [[cloak]] usually only worn for prestige on special occasions such as weddings.\n* [[Abaya]] ({{lang-ar|\u0639\u0628\u0627\u0626\u0629}}) is a woman's garment. It is a black cloak which loosely covers the entire body except the head. Some women choose to cover their faces with a niq\u0101b and some do not. Some abayas cover the top of the head as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelovelyplanet.net/traditional-dress-of-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia/ |title=Traditional dress of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia |date=29 September 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018115808/http://www.thelovelyplanet.net/traditional-dress-of-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia/ |archivedate=18 October 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Arts and entertainment===\n{{Main|Saudi Arabian art|Cinema of Saudi Arabia|Music of Saudi Arabia|Theatre in Saudi Arabia}}\n[[File:King Abdullah in his youth.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|King Abdullah practising [[falconry]], a traditional pursuit in the country]]\n\nDuring the 1970s, cinemas were numerous in the Kingdom although they were seen as contrary to Wahhabi norms.<ref name=\"Return of cinema in Saudi Arabia provokes critics\">[http://worldfocus.org/blog/2009/01/05/return-of-cinema-in-saudi-arabia-provokes-critics/3473/ World Focus]. 5 January 2009</ref> During the [[Islamic revival]] movement in the 1980s, and as a political response to an increase in [[Islamist]] activism including the 1979 [[Grand Mosque Seizure|seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca]], the government closed all cinemas and theaters.

With the advent of oil-wealth in the 20th century came exposure to outside influences, such as Western housing styles, furnishings, and clothes. Music and dance have always been part of Saudi life. Traditional music is generally associated with poetry and is sung collectively. Instruments include the rab\u0101bah, an instrument not unlike a three-string fiddle, and various types of percussion instruments, such as the \u1e6dabl (drum) and the \u1e6d\u0101r (tambourine). Of the native dances, the most popular is a martial line dance known as the \u02bfar\u1e0dah, which includes lines of men, frequently armed with swords or rifles, dancing to the beat of drums and tambourines.

According to the team approach to leadership, a team is a type of organizational group of people that are members.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} A team is composed of members who are dependent on each other, work towards interchangeable achievements, and share common attainments. A team works as a whole together to achieve certain things. A team is usually located in the same setting as it is normally connected to a kind of organization, company, or community. Teams can meet in-person (directly face-to-face) or virtually when practicing their values and activities or duties. A team's communication is significantly important to their relationship.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} Ergo, communication is frequent and persistent, and as well are the [[meeting]]s.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The definition of team as an organizational group is not completely set in stone, as organizations have confronted a myriad{{quantify|date=February 2019}} of new forms of contemporary collaboration. Teams usually have strong organizational structured platforms and respond quickly and efficiently to challenges as they have skills and the capability to do so.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} An effective organizational team leads to greater productivity, more effective implementation of resources, better decisions and problem-solving, better-quality products/service, and greater innovation and originality.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nAlongside the concept of a team, compare the more structured/skilled concept of a [[crew]], the advantages of formal and informal [[partnership]]s, or the well-defined - but time-limited - existence of [[task force]]s.\n\nA team becomes more than just a collection of people when a strong sense of mutual [[commitment (disambiguation)|commitment]] creates synergy, thus generating performance greater than the sum of the performance of its individual members.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} \n\nThus teams of [[game]] players can form (and re-form) to practise their craft/sport. Transport logistics executives can select teams of [[horse]]s, [[dog]]s, or [[ox]]en for the purpose of conveying passengers or goods.\n\n==Types==\nOf particular importance is the [[concept]] of different types of teams.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Categories by subject===\n\n[[File:Type 91 SAM fire.JPG|thumb|A [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]] (JASDF) team looks on after the Type 91 Kai MANPAD fires a rocket at a mock airborne target.]]\n\nAlthough the concept of a team is relatively simple, social scientists have identified many different types of teams. In general, teams either act as information processors, or take on a more active role in the task and actually perform activities. Common categories and subtypes of teams include:\n\n====Action teams====\n\n====Advisory teams====\nAdvisory teams make suggestions about a final product (Devine, 2002). For instance, a [[quality control|quality-control]] group on an assembly line would be an example of an advisory team: they may examine the products produced and make suggestions about how to improve the quality of the items being made.\n\n====Command team====\nThe goal of the command team is to combine instructions and to coordinate action among management. In other words, command teams serve as the \"''middle man''\" in tasks (Devine, 2002). For instance, messengers on a construction site, conveying instructions from the executive team to the builders, would be an example of a command team.{{Clarify|date=August 2017}}\n\n==== Executive team ====\nAn executive team is a management team that draws up plans for activities and then directs these activities (Devine, 2002). An example of an executive team would be a construction team designing blueprints for a new building, and then guiding the construction of the building using these blueprints.\n\n==== Project teams ====\n{{Main|Project team}}\nA team used only for a [[define]]d period of time and for a separate, concretely definable purpose, often{{quantify|date=April 2016}} becomes known as a project team. This category of team includes negotiation-, commission- and design-team subtypes. In general, these types of teams are multi-talented and composed of individuals with expertise in many different areas. Members of these teams might belong to different groups, but receive assignment to activities for the same [[project]], thereby allowing outsiders to view them as a single unit. In this way, setting up a team allegedly facilitates the creation, tracking and assignment of a group of people based on the project in hand.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}  The use of the \"team\" label in this instance often has no relationship to whether the employees work as a team.\n\nLundin and Soderholm define project teams as a special case in the more general category of temporary organizations which also includes task forces, program committees, and action groups.  All of these are formed to ``make things happen``. This emphasis on action leads to a demarcation between the temporary organization and its environment.  The demarcation is driven by four interrelated concepts (the four T`s):\n#Time \u2013 the time horizons and limits are crucial to the existence of temporary organizations ``whose very existence helps spread a sense of urgency``.\n#Task \u2013 the raison d` \u00e8tre for the temporary organization; no other party is attending to the same task at the same time in the same way\n#Team \u2013 provides the human resources to accomplish the task in the time available\n#Transition \u2013 an accomplishment or some sort of qualitative difference is expected after the time horizon\n\"The concepts also differ from the crucial concepts that define the permanent organization. Permanent organizations are more naturally defined by goals (rather than tasks), survival (rather than time), working organization (rather than team) and production processes and continual development (rather than transition)\"\n<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lundin|first1=R.

Members include all players (even those who are waiting their turn to play), as well as support members such as a team manager or [[Coach (sport)|coach]].\n\n====Virtual teams====\n{{Main|Virtual team}}\nDevelopments in [[information and communications technology]] have seen the emergence of the virtual work-team. A virtual team is a group of people who work interdependently and with shared purpose across space, time, and organisational boundaries using technology to communicate and collaborate. Virtual team members can be located across a country or across the world, rarely meet face-to-face, and include members from different cultures.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=634645 Kimble et al.

People in those occupations come together in one department because they serve a common overall function, but almost everyone in the group works fairly independently.

This is because a larger group is able to address concerns of the whole [[system]]. So while a large team may be ineffective at performing a given task, Cooperider says that the relevance of that task should be considered, because determining whether the team is effective first requires identifying what needs to be accomplished.\n\n[[File:Bullock wagon Promontory Road.jpg|thumb|A team of [[ox]]en yoked together]]\nRegarding composition, all teams will have an element of homogeneity and heterogeneity.  The more homogeneous the group, the more cohesive it will be. The more heterogeneous the group, the greater the differences in perspective and increased potential for [[creativity]], but also the greater potential for conflict.\n\nTeam members normally have different roles, like team leader and agents. Large teams can divide into subteams according to need.\n\nMany teams go through a life-cycle of stages, identified by [[Bruce Tuckman]] as: [[Forming-storming-norming-performing|forming, storming, norming, performing and adjourning]].\n\n== Team cognition ==\n\nTeam cognition has been defined as an \"emergent state that refers to the manner in which knowledge important to team functioning is organized, represented, and distributed within team.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = DeChurch | first1 = L.A. | last2 = Mesmer-Magnus | first2 = J.R. | year = 2010 | title = The cognitive underpinnings of effective teamwork: a meta-analysis | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 95 | issue = 1| pages = 32\u201353 | doi=10.1037/a0017328 | pmid=20085405}}</ref>  This emergent state can manifest in two ways. Compositional emergence occurs when individual level cognition is similar in form and function to its manifestation at team-level. Compilational emergence, on the other hand, represents a greater degree of synergy among team members and represents a new-team level construct. As such, higher degrees of compilational emergence are more closely related to team process and performance than is compositional emergence.\n\nResearch into team cognition has focused on how teams develop mental models and [[transactive memory]] systems. Mental models refer to the degree in which team members have similar cognitive understanding of the situation and performance goals which include shared representations of the task.  Transactive memory systems relate to how knowledge is distributed among team members and retrieved in a coordinated fashion, the way that team member rely on knowledge that is possessed by other members and how knowledge sets are differentiated within a team.  The emergence of team cognition is thought to impact team effectiveness because it can positively affect a team's behavioural process, motivational states, and performance.\n\nTeam cognition consists of two broad types of content. Task related models are related to knowledge of the major duties and resources possessed by the team. Team-related models refer to interactions and interdependence among the team members.\n\n==Team effectiveness ==\n{{Main|Team effectiveness}}\nWhen companies are in trouble, they often restructure into teams. However, putting people into teams does not solve problems; if not done thoughtfully, this may even cause more problems.<ref name=\":3\" /> The formation of teams is most appropriate for tasks that are difficult, complex and important. These types of tasks are often beyond the skills and abilities of any single individual. However, the formation of a team to complete such tasks does not guarantee success. Rather, the proper implementation of teams is positively related to both member satisfaction and increased effectiveness.  Organizations who want to receive the benefits afforded by teams need to carefully consider how teams are built and implemented. Often, teams are created without providing members any training to develop the skills necessary to perform well in a team setting. This is critical, because teamwork can be cognitively and interpersonally demanding.   Even when a team consists of talented individuals, these individuals must learn to coordinate their actions and develop functional interpersonal interactions.<ref name=\"Forsyth, D.

Take for example [[NUMMI|New United Motor Manufacturing Inc]] (NUMMI). Originally it was a General Motors automotive manufacturing plant that had to close due to numerous issues, causing it to be the worst performing GM plant. NUMMI was the collaborative creation of General Motors and Toyota. These two companies took most of the same work force and created one of the most productive automotive plants, producing high quality cars. They did this by implementing a new team structure, where management and the company was more supportive of the union workforce.<ref>{{cite book |last1=O'Reilly III |first1=Charles |last2=Pfeffer |first2=Jeffrey |title=Hidden Value: How Great Companies Achieve Extraordinary Results with Ordinary People |date=2000 |publisher=Harvard Business School Press |location=Boston, Massachusetts |isbn=9780875848983 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/hiddenvaluehowgr00orei/page/175 175\u2013200] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/hiddenvaluehowgr00orei/page/175 }}</ref>\n\n==Not all groups are teams==\nSome people use the word \"team\" when they mean \"employees\".  A \"[[sales]] team\" is a common example of this loose or perhaps [[euphemistic]] usage, though inter-dependencies exist in [[organisations]], and a sales group can be let down by poor performance in other parts of the organisation upon which sales depend, like delivery, after-sales service, etc.  However \"sales staff\" is a more accurate description of the typical arrangement.\n\nGroups develop into teams in four stages:<ref>\nWheelan, S. (2010). Creating Effective Teams: a team for 5 to 6 naks</ref>\n\n# dependency and inclusion\n# counter dependency and fighting\n# trust and structure\n# work\n\nIn the first stage, group development is characterized by members' dependency on the designated [[leader]] (identical to 'Forming' in Tuckman's model). In the second stage, the group seeks to free itself from its dependence on the leader and groups have conflicts about goals and procedures (identical to 'Storming' in Tuckman's model). In the third stage, the group manages to work through the conflicts (identical to 'Norming' in Tuckman's model). And in the last stage, groups focus on team productivity (identical to 'Performing' in Tuckman's model).{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}\n\nOne aspect of teams that can set them apart from other groups is their level of autonomy. Hackman developed a hierarchical model of team autonomy which consists of four levels of team self-management. It is imagined along a continuum, starting with a manager-led team in which team members complete the required tasks but someone outside the team performs the executive functions.  Next in the hierarchy are [[self-managing team]]s, followed by self-designing teams. Finally, at the top of the hierarchy, come self-governing teams.  The model describes four different types of control that fully self-governing teams can possess. These include control over the execution of the task, monitoring and managing work processes, control over the design and performance of a team, and setting the overall direction of the team.<ref name=\"Forsyth, D. R. 2006 P. 351-377\" />\n\nTo understand how teams deliver extra performance, we need to distinguish between teams and working groups. A working group's performance is made up of the individual results of all its individual members. A team's performance is made up of both individual results and collective results. Teams produce work products/results though the joint contributions of team members. This is what makes the team's collective performance greater than the sum of all individual members\u2019 best performance. In short, a team is more than the sum of its parts.<ref>[http://www.jointeambuilding.com/business-tools-for-success/how-to-tell-the-difference-between-groups-and-teams/ Group vs Team]</ref>\n\n== Leadership ==\nThe \u201cteam\u201d portion of team leadership is based on individuals and how each share the work between one another. First, individuals must see that they are a team, not simply a group. Each member takes on a portion of the group's leadership and responsibility. Each member helps other members to see their strengths and how they complement each other.\n\nSecond, the team sets result driven goals. To achieve this, the designated leader guides the team based decision making process. The team clarifies or agrees on attainable goals. Additionally, they agree on steps to obtain them. Furthermore, the team determines if they need to take an immediate action, or if they can simply watch a situation for a period of time.\n\nThird, if the team decides to take an action, it may be something they change internally, such as clarifying their goals, receiving training, collaborating, or building commitment as a team. If not internally, this action can be something they will act on outside of the team, such as networking with others or negotiating for support.\n\nLastly, the team's leader will contribute by finding ways to improve team work. This may be done through questionnaires given to the team. These can address any problems, or seek avenues the team would like to see improved. A strength of the team is its continuous stride for improvement and openness to interventional assistance.\n\nIn <u>Leadership - Theory and Practice 7th Edition</u> by Peter G. Northouse, he states that, \u201cA team is a type of organizational group that is composed of members who are interdependent, who share common goals, and who must coordinate their activities to accomplish these goals,\u201d (Northouse, 363). Overall, the team will lead each other to bring forth their own individual ideas and strengths, which create opportunities for great success.\n\nA common myth is that to function effectively, teams need a strong, powerful, and charismatic leader. In general, leaders who control all the details, manage alle the key relationships in the team, have all the good ideas, and use the team to execute their \"vision\" are usually overworked and underproductive.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nTeams are in need of transformational leaders not more managers, with the important caveat that the world does not function well without managers. [[Transformational leadership|Transformational leaders]] engage in the following behaviors:<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bass|first=Bernard M.|last2=Riggio|first2=Ronald E.|date=2006-08-15|title=Transformational Leadership|journal=BMJ : British Medical Journal|volume=331|issue=7516|pages=560|doi=10.4324/9781410617095|pmc=1200593|isbn=9781410617095}}</ref>\n\n* Idealized Influence: The ability to engage other people by your actions. They like the way that you do things, they like the way the you treat people, and they like your approach to problems. Charisma is often associated with idealized influence.\n* Inspirational Motivation: The ability to inspire others with your vision. Those who lead with inspirational motivation will enable their followers to achieve things they did not believe were possible.\n* Intellectual Stimulation: The ability to stimulate others to be creative and challenge preconceptions they possess. This behavior enables a leader to tap into creativity as a competitive advantage.\n* Individualized Consideration: The ability to truly know those that you wish to lead. This behavior enables leaders to realize and draw out the full potential of others.\n\n==See also==<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->\n{{Wiktionary|teem|team}}\n{{Commons category|Teams|lcfirst=yes}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*[[Air-defense experiments]]\n*[[Coalition]]\n*[[Community]]\n*[[Driving (horse)#Teams|Driving (horse)]]\n*[[Forming-storming-norming-performing]]\n*[[Group (sociology)]]\n*[[Groups of people]]\n*[[Judge\u2013advisor system]]\n*[[Multiteam system]]\n*[[Player (game)|Player]]\n*[[Super-team]]\n*[[Albert S Humphrey|Team Action Management]]\n*[[Team building]]\n*[[Team composition]]\n*[[Teamwork]]\n*[[The Five Dysfunctions of a Team]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n* Devine, D.

According to the team approach to leadership, a team is a type of organizational group of people that are members.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} A team is composed of members who are dependent on each other, work towards interchangeable achievements, and share common attainments. A team works as a whole together to achieve certain things. A team is usually located in the same setting as it is normally connected to a kind of organization, company, or community. Teams can meet in-person (directly face-to-face) or virtually when practicing their values and activities or duties. A team's communication is significantly important to their relationship.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} Ergo, communication is frequent and persistent, and as well are the [[meeting]]s.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The definition of team as an organizational group is not completely set in stone, as organizations have confronted a myriad{{quantify|date=February 2019}} of new forms of contemporary collaboration. Teams usually have strong organizational structured platforms and respond quickly and efficiently to challenges as they have skills and the capability to do so.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} An effective organizational team leads to greater productivity, more effective implementation of resources, better decisions and problem-solving, better-quality products/service, and greater innovation and originality.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nAlongside the concept of a team, compare the more structured/skilled concept of a [[crew]], the advantages of formal and informal [[partnership]]s, or the well-defined - but time-limited - existence of [[task force]]s.\n\nA team becomes more than just a collection of people when a strong sense of mutual [[commitment (disambiguation)|commitment]] creates synergy, thus generating performance greater than the sum of the performance of its individual members.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} \n\nThus teams of [[game]] players can form (and re-form) to practise their craft/sport. Transport logistics executives can select teams of [[horse]]s, [[dog]]s, or [[ox]]en for the purpose of conveying passengers or goods.\n\n==Types==\nOf particular importance is the [[concept]] of different types of teams.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===Categories by subject===\n\n[[File:Type 91 SAM fire.JPG|thumb|A [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]] (JASDF) team looks on after the Type 91 Kai MANPAD fires a rocket at a mock airborne target.]]\n\nAlthough the concept of a team is relatively simple, social scientists have identified many different types of teams. In general, teams either act as information processors, or take on a more active role in the task and actually perform activities. Common categories and subtypes of teams include:\n\n====Action teams====\n\n====Advisory teams====\nAdvisory teams make suggestions about a final product (Devine, 2002). For instance, a [[quality control|quality-control]] group on an assembly line would be an example of an advisory team: they may examine the products produced and make suggestions about how to improve the quality of the items being made.\n\n====Command team====\nThe goal of the command team is to combine instructions and to coordinate action among management. In other words, command teams serve as the \"''middle man''\" in tasks (Devine, 2002). For instance, messengers on a construction site, conveying instructions from the executive team to the builders, would be an example of a command team.{{Clarify|date=August 2017}}\n\n==== Executive team ====\nAn executive team is a management team that draws up plans for activities and then directs these activities (Devine, 2002). An example of an executive team would be a construction team designing blueprints for a new building, and then guiding the construction of the building using these blueprints.\n\n==== Project teams ====\n{{Main|Project team}}\nA team used only for a [[define]]d period of time and for a separate, concretely definable purpose, often{{quantify|date=April 2016}} becomes known as a project team. This category of team includes negotiation-, commission- and design-team subtypes. In general, these types of teams are multi-talented and composed of individuals with expertise in many different areas. Members of these teams might belong to different groups, but receive assignment to activities for the same [[project]], thereby allowing outsiders to view them as a single unit. In this way, setting up a team allegedly facilitates the creation, tracking and assignment of a group of people based on the project in hand.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}  The use of the \"team\" label in this instance often has no relationship to whether the employees work as a team.\n\nLundin and Soderholm define project teams as a special case in the more general category of temporary organizations which also includes task forces, program committees, and action groups.  All of these are formed to ``make things happen``. This emphasis on action leads to a demarcation between the temporary organization and its environment.  The demarcation is driven by four interrelated concepts (the four T`s):\n#Time \u2013 the time horizons and limits are crucial to the existence of temporary organizations ``whose very existence helps spread a sense of urgency``.\n#Task \u2013 the raison d` \u00e8tre for the temporary organization; no other party is attending to the same task at the same time in the same way\n#Team \u2013 provides the human resources to accomplish the task in the time available\n#Transition \u2013 an accomplishment or some sort of qualitative difference is expected after the time horizon\n\"The concepts also differ from the crucial concepts that define the permanent organization. Permanent organizations are more naturally defined by goals (rather than tasks), survival (rather than time), working organization (rather than team) and production processes and continual development (rather than transition)\"\n<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lundin|first1=R.

A virtual team is a group of people who work interdependently and with shared purpose across space, time, and organisational boundaries using technology to communicate and collaborate.

This is because a larger group is able to address concerns of the whole [[system]]. So while a large team may be ineffective at performing a given task, Cooperider says that the relevance of that task should be considered, because determining whether the team is effective first requires identifying what needs to be accomplished.\n\n[[File:Bullock wagon Promontory Road.jpg|thumb|A team of [[ox]]en yoked together]]\nRegarding composition, all teams will have an element of homogeneity and heterogeneity.  The more homogeneous the group, the more cohesive it will be. The more heterogeneous the group, the greater the differences in perspective and increased potential for [[creativity]], but also the greater potential for conflict.\n\nTeam members normally have different roles, like team leader and agents. Large teams can divide into subteams according to need.\n\nMany teams go through a life-cycle of stages, identified by [[Bruce Tuckman]] as: [[Forming-storming-norming-performing|forming, storming, norming, performing and adjourning]].\n\n== Team cognition ==\n\nTeam cognition has been defined as an \"emergent state that refers to the manner in which knowledge important to team functioning is organized, represented, and distributed within team.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = DeChurch | first1 = L.A. | last2 = Mesmer-Magnus | first2 = J.R. | year = 2010 | title = The cognitive underpinnings of effective teamwork: a meta-analysis | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 95 | issue = 1| pages = 32\u201353 | doi=10.1037/a0017328 | pmid=20085405}}</ref>  This emergent state can manifest in two ways. Compositional emergence occurs when individual level cognition is similar in form and function to its manifestation at team-level. Compilational emergence, on the other hand, represents a greater degree of synergy among team members and represents a new-team level construct. As such, higher degrees of compilational emergence are more closely related to team process and performance than is compositional emergence.\n\nResearch into team cognition has focused on how teams develop mental models and [[transactive memory]] systems. Mental models refer to the degree in which team members have similar cognitive understanding of the situation and performance goals which include shared representations of the task.  Transactive memory systems relate to how knowledge is distributed among team members and retrieved in a coordinated fashion, the way that team member rely on knowledge that is possessed by other members and how knowledge sets are differentiated within a team.  The emergence of team cognition is thought to impact team effectiveness because it can positively affect a team's behavioural process, motivational states, and performance.\n\nTeam cognition consists of two broad types of content. Task related models are related to knowledge of the major duties and resources possessed by the team. Team-related models refer to interactions and interdependence among the team members.\n\n==Team effectiveness ==\n{{Main|Team effectiveness}}\nWhen companies are in trouble, they often restructure into teams. However, putting people into teams does not solve problems; if not done thoughtfully, this may even cause more problems.<ref name=\":3\" /> The formation of teams is most appropriate for tasks that are difficult, complex and important. These types of tasks are often beyond the skills and abilities of any single individual. However, the formation of a team to complete such tasks does not guarantee success. Rather, the proper implementation of teams is positively related to both member satisfaction and increased effectiveness.  Organizations who want to receive the benefits afforded by teams need to carefully consider how teams are built and implemented. Often, teams are created without providing members any training to develop the skills necessary to perform well in a team setting. This is critical, because teamwork can be cognitively and interpersonally demanding.   Even when a team consists of talented individuals, these individuals must learn to coordinate their actions and develop functional interpersonal interactions.<ref name=\"Forsyth, D.

Take for example [[NUMMI|New United Motor Manufacturing Inc]] (NUMMI). Originally it was a General Motors automotive manufacturing plant that had to close due to numerous issues, causing it to be the worst performing GM plant. NUMMI was the collaborative creation of General Motors and Toyota. These two companies took most of the same work force and created one of the most productive automotive plants, producing high quality cars. They did this by implementing a new team structure, where management and the company was more supportive of the union workforce.<ref>{{cite book |last1=O'Reilly III |first1=Charles |last2=Pfeffer |first2=Jeffrey |title=Hidden Value: How Great Companies Achieve Extraordinary Results with Ordinary People |date=2000 |publisher=Harvard Business School Press |location=Boston, Massachusetts |isbn=9780875848983 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/hiddenvaluehowgr00orei/page/175 175\u2013200] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/hiddenvaluehowgr00orei/page/175 }}</ref>\n\n==Not all groups are teams==\nSome people use the word \"team\" when they mean \"employees\".  A \"[[sales]] team\" is a common example of this loose or perhaps [[euphemistic]] usage, though inter-dependencies exist in [[organisations]], and a sales group can be let down by poor performance in other parts of the organisation upon which sales depend, like delivery, after-sales service, etc.  However \"sales staff\" is a more accurate description of the typical arrangement.\n\nGroups develop into teams in four stages:<ref>\nWheelan, S. (2010). Creating Effective Teams: a team for 5 to 6 naks</ref>\n\n# dependency and inclusion\n# counter dependency and fighting\n# trust and structure\n# work\n\nIn the first stage, group development is characterized by members' dependency on the designated [[leader]] (identical to 'Forming' in Tuckman's model). In the second stage, the group seeks to free itself from its dependence on the leader and groups have conflicts about goals and procedures (identical to 'Storming' in Tuckman's model). In the third stage, the group manages to work through the conflicts (identical to 'Norming' in Tuckman's model). And in the last stage, groups focus on team productivity (identical to 'Performing' in Tuckman's model).{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}\n\nOne aspect of teams that can set them apart from other groups is their level of autonomy. Hackman developed a hierarchical model of team autonomy which consists of four levels of team self-management. It is imagined along a continuum, starting with a manager-led team in which team members complete the required tasks but someone outside the team performs the executive functions.  Next in the hierarchy are [[self-managing team]]s, followed by self-designing teams. Finally, at the top of the hierarchy, come self-governing teams.  The model describes four different types of control that fully self-governing teams can possess. These include control over the execution of the task, monitoring and managing work processes, control over the design and performance of a team, and setting the overall direction of the team.<ref name=\"Forsyth, D. R. 2006 P. 351-377\" />\n\nTo understand how teams deliver extra performance, we need to distinguish between teams and working groups. A working group's performance is made up of the individual results of all its individual members. A team's performance is made up of both individual results and collective results. Teams produce work products/results though the joint contributions of team members. This is what makes the team's collective performance greater than the sum of all individual members\u2019 best performance. In short, a team is more than the sum of its parts.<ref>[http://www.jointeambuilding.com/business-tools-for-success/how-to-tell-the-difference-between-groups-and-teams/ Group vs Team]</ref>\n\n== Leadership ==\nThe \u201cteam\u201d portion of team leadership is based on individuals and how each share the work between one another. First, individuals must see that they are a team, not simply a group. Each member takes on a portion of the group's leadership and responsibility. Each member helps other members to see their strengths and how they complement each other.\n\nSecond, the team sets result driven goals. To achieve this, the designated leader guides the team based decision making process. The team clarifies or agrees on attainable goals. Additionally, they agree on steps to obtain them. Furthermore, the team determines if they need to take an immediate action, or if they can simply watch a situation for a period of time.\n\nThird, if the team decides to take an action, it may be something they change internally, such as clarifying their goals, receiving training, collaborating, or building commitment as a team. If not internally, this action can be something they will act on outside of the team, such as networking with others or negotiating for support.\n\nLastly, the team's leader will contribute by finding ways to improve team work. This may be done through questionnaires given to the team. These can address any problems, or seek avenues the team would like to see improved. A strength of the team is its continuous stride for improvement and openness to interventional assistance.\n\nIn <u>Leadership - Theory and Practice 7th Edition</u> by Peter G. Northouse, he states that, \u201cA team is a type of organizational group that is composed of members who are interdependent, who share common goals, and who must coordinate their activities to accomplish these goals,\u201d (Northouse, 363). Overall, the team will lead each other to bring forth their own individual ideas and strengths, which create opportunities for great success.\n\nA common myth is that to function effectively, teams need a strong, powerful, and charismatic leader. In general, leaders who control all the details, manage alle the key relationships in the team, have all the good ideas, and use the team to execute their \"vision\" are usually overworked and underproductive.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nTeams are in need of transformational leaders not more managers, with the important caveat that the world does not function well without managers. [[Transformational leadership|Transformational leaders]] engage in the following behaviors:<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bass|first=Bernard M.|last2=Riggio|first2=Ronald E.|date=2006-08-15|title=Transformational Leadership|journal=BMJ : British Medical Journal|volume=331|issue=7516|pages=560|doi=10.4324/9781410617095|pmc=1200593|isbn=9781410617095}}</ref>\n\n* Idealized Influence: The ability to engage other people by your actions. They like the way that you do things, they like the way the you treat people, and they like your approach to problems. Charisma is often associated with idealized influence.\n* Inspirational Motivation: The ability to inspire others with your vision. Those who lead with inspirational motivation will enable their followers to achieve things they did not believe were possible.\n* Intellectual Stimulation: The ability to stimulate others to be creative and challenge preconceptions they possess. This behavior enables a leader to tap into creativity as a competitive advantage.\n* Individualized Consideration: The ability to truly know those that you wish to lead. This behavior enables leaders to realize and draw out the full potential of others.\n\n==See also==<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->\n{{Wiktionary|teem|team}}\n{{Commons category|Teams|lcfirst=yes}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*[[Air-defense experiments]]\n*[[Coalition]]\n*[[Community]]\n*[[Driving (horse)#Teams|Driving (horse)]]\n*[[Forming-storming-norming-performing]]\n*[[Group (sociology)]]\n*[[Groups of people]]\n*[[Judge\u2013advisor system]]\n*[[Multiteam system]]\n*[[Player (game)|Player]]\n*[[Super-team]]\n*[[Albert S Humphrey|Team Action Management]]\n*[[Team building]]\n*[[Team composition]]\n*[[Teamwork]]\n*[[The Five Dysfunctions of a Team]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n* Devine, D.
