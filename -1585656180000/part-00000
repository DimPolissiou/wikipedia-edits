They are more correctly called the '''Royal Group of Docks''' to distinguish them from the [[Royal Navy Dockyard|Royal Dockyards]], Royal being due to their naming after royal personages rather than [[The Crown|Crown]] ownership. The three docks collectively formed the largest enclosed docks in the world, with a water area of nearly {{convert|250|acre|km2|1}} and an overall estate of {{convert|1100|acre|km2|1}}. This is equivalent to the whole of central London from [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] to [[Tower Bridge]]. The area was designated a [[Urban Enterprise Zone#United Kingdom|special enterprise zone]] in 2012. [[North Woolwich]] is part of Royal Docks ward.\n\nRoyal Docks is also a ward of the London Borough of Newham. At the 2011 Census it had a population of 10,679.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=13688998&c=Royal+Docks&d=14&e=62&g=6335034&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&o=362&m=0&r=1&s=1476697962553&enc=1 |title=Newham Ward population 2011 |accessdate=17 October 2016 |publisher=Office for National Statistics |work=Neighbourhood Statistics}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Im1934BCI-Spil24.jpg|thumb|Spiller's [[Millennium Mills]] on the south side of the docks, 1934]]\nThe three docks were completed between 1855 and 1921 on riverside marshes in [[County Borough of East Ham|East Ham]] and [[County Borough of West Ham|West Ham]] (now the [[London Borough of Newham]]). The Victoria and Albert docks were constructed by the London & St Katharine Docks Company, to provide berths for large vessels that could not be accommodated further upriver. They were a great commercial success, becoming London's principal docks during the first half of the 20th century. They specialised particularly in the import and unloading of foodstuffs, with rows of giant granaries and refrigerated warehouses being sited alongside the quays. The docks' great size and provision of numerous finger quays gave them a collective span of over {{convert|12|mi|km|1}} of quaysides, serving hundreds of cargo and passenger ships at a time. Following the opening of the Royal Albert Dock in 1880, giving the Royals access to Gallions Reach, {{convert|11|mi|km|1}} below London Bridge, the rival East & West India Docks Company responded with the construction of [[Port of Tilbury|Tilbury Docks]] even further down river. The ruinous competition led eventually to all the enclosed docks being taken over by the [[Port of London Authority]] (PLA) in 1909. The PLA completed the King George V Dock in 1921 and reserved land to the north for a fourth dock, never built.\n\n[[File:Royal Victoria Dock 1973.jpg|thumb|left|The Victoria dock in 1973]]\nThe [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|General Strike of 1926]] hit the Royal Docks hard, with 750,000 frozen carcasses threatened by the docks' electrical supply being cut off. The [[Royal Navy]] saved the day for the dock owners by connecting the generators of two submarines to power the warehouses' freezers.\n\nAlthough the Royal Docks suffered severe damage from [[Germany|German]] bombing in [[World War II]], they recovered after the war but suffered a steady decline from the 1960s onwards, following the adoption of [[containerization]]. Nonetheless, they survived longer than any of the other upstream docks, finally closing to commercial traffic only in 1981. The docks' closure led to high levels of unemployment and social deprivation in the surrounding communities of [[North Woolwich]] and [[Silvertown]].\n\n== Redevelopment ==\n[[File:London City Airport Zwart.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the docks looking west, 2010]]\n[[File:Yachting in Royal Victoria Dock - geograph.org.uk - 834047.jpg|thumb|The ExCel centre in 2008]]\nBecause of their relative remoteness from central London and poor transport links, the redevelopment of London's [[London Docklands|Docklands]] has proceeded more slowly in the Royals than in the other former docks. The [[London Docklands Development Corporation]] undertook much work during the 1980s and 1990s to improve local transport and promote new residential and commercial developments in the area. Thousands of new homes were built at [[Beckton]], just north of the Royal Docks.\n\nAn extension of the [[Docklands Light Railway]] (DLR) opened in 1994 to provide direct links to the [[City of London]] and [[Canary Wharf]]. This was later extended round the south side of the docks with the link to [[London City Airport]] opening in December 2006. The line was later extended to [[Woolwich]]. [[Crossrail]] will serve the area from 2021.\n\nSeveral other major projects have been proposed or implemented since then. Many residential complexes have been built; most notably the architecturally progressive [[Eastern Quay]] on the south side of Royal Victoria Dock, Capital East on the north side of the dock and the large complex of Gallion's Reach in the extreme east of the Royal Docks. A series of major developments have seen the construction of a new university campus (for the [[University of East London]]) and the [[ExCeL Exhibition Centre]], among much else. The Royal Docks have also seen the development of [[London City Airport]] (code LCY), opened in 1988 on the quay between the Royal Albert Dock and the King George V dock. While the docks themselves have been preserved largely intact, little remains of the old infrastructure, although some historic warehouses and cranes have been preserved.\n\nIn 2011 the one hundred and twenty five hectares of the Royal Docks were granted [[Enterprise Zone]] status to help attract jobs and businesses to the area.<ref>[http://www.london.gov.uk/media/press_releases_mayoral/london\u2019s-royal-docks-become-one-country\u2019s-largest-enterprise-zones London\u2019s Royal Docks to become one of country\u2019s largest Enterprise Zones | Greater London Authority<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Singapore listed Oxley Holdings together with leading developer Ballymore UK have a Joint-Venture to set up a new waterfront township of [[Royal Wharf]], with 3,385 new homes housing over 10,000. This will be a [[mixed-use development]] comprising shops, restaurants and even office complexes.

[[Transport for London]] plan to extend the Beckton branch to [[Dagenham]] but this is dependent on funding. The DLR replaced the [[North London Line]] services that previously served the area from Canning Town to North Woolwich via Custom House and the 600&nbsp;m Connaught tunnel beneath the docks.\n\nFrom 2018 a branch of the Crossrail line will pass beneath the Royal Docks between [[Canning Town]] and [[Woolwich]], serving [[Custom House station]] (and future provision for a station at [[Silvertown railway station|Silvertown]].

A long-standing proposal has been for a four-lane tolled bridge providing a road link between Beckton and [[Thamesmead]] on the south bank: the [[Thames Gateway Bridge]]. A public inquiry on the bridge closed in May 2006, it being particularly contentious in the residential neighbourhoods between Plumstead and the Danson Interchange (a junction on the A2). The plans were shelved, along with the DLR Dagenham extension, by [[Boris Johnson]] when he came to power in 2008. However, in the run up to the 2012 election Mayor Johnson has started to push for a [[Silvertown Tunnel|crossing at Silvertown]] (the western end of the docks)<ref>{{cite web|last=Bienkov |first=Adam |url=http://snipe.at/scoop/a-pressing-need-but-no-funding-for-new-river-crossings |title=A \"pressing need\" but no funding for new river crossings \u00bb The Scoop &#124; Snipe |publisher=Snipe.at |date=2010-08-26 |accessdate=2012-06-05}}</ref>\n\nThe Royal Docks is also home to [[London City Airport]], between the northern and southern docks. It was opened in 1988 to serve the Canary Wharf development. It is closer to central London than Heathrow, and is served by a dedicated DLR station. In 2010, London City was the fifth busiest airport in terms of passengers and aircraft movements serving the London area.\n\n== Navigation ==\nAlthough the docks are now closed for commercial shipping, most of the water area of the docks still exists and is still navigable by craft of all sizes up to and including sizeable ships.  The docks' principal use is now water sports, but they do see occasional visits by naval and merchant vessels, especially during the annual [[London Boat Show]] and the biannual [[DSEi]] arms fair, both of which are held at the ExCeL Exhibition Centre. Cruise ships including [[Fred Olsen Lines]]' [[Braemar (ship)|Braemar]] (24,300 [[Gross tonnage|GT]]) were moored there during the [[London 2012]] Olympics.\n\nThe management of the water areas of the Royal Docks, including locks and bridges, is now the responsibility of ''Royal Docks Management Authority Limited'' (RoDMA), which is owned and funded by the owners of the surrounding development land.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Royal Docks Heritage Railway]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.royalwharf.net/ Royal Wharf - Royal Docks Biggest Township]\n* [http://www.royalwharflondon.com/about-royal-wharf-london/ Royal Wharf Details- Royal Docks Biggest Township]\n* [http://www.royaldocks.london/ The Mayor of London \u2013 Royal Docks website]\n* [http://www.royaldockstrust.org.uk/ Royal Docks Trust website]\n* [http://www.rodma.co.uk/ Royal Docks Management Authority Limited website]\n* [http://www.royaldocks.net/ Royal Docks Information website]\n\n{{coord|51.506661|0.04240|display=title|region:GB_type:landmark}}\n\n{{LB Newham}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2017}}\n\n[[Category:London docks]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Newham]]\n[[Category:Geography of the London Borough of Newham]]\n[[Category:Redevelopment projects in London]]\n[[Category:Port of London]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use British English|date=August 2017}}\n[[File:Newham London UK Royal Docks ward map.jpg|thumb|255px|Ward map of Royal Docks within the [[London Borough of Newham]]]]\n:''Not to be confused with the [[Royal Dock, Grimsby]]''\n'''Royal Docks''' is an area and a [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|ward]] in the [[London Borough of Newham]] in the [[London Docklands]] in [[East London]], [[England]].\n\nThe area is named after three docks \u2013 the [[Royal Albert Dock, London|Royal Albert Dock]], the [[Royal Victoria Dock]] and the [[King George V Dock, London|King George V Dock]].

And the uranium, like plutonium, is only usable in the core of a bomb in metallic form.\n\nHowever, only 2\u20134&nbsp;kg of plutonium is needed for the same device that would need 20\u201325&nbsp;kg of U-235. Additionally, a few grams of tritium (a by-product of plutonium production reactors and thermonuclear fuel) can increase the overall yield of the bombs by a factor of three to four. \"The sixth Pakistan nuclear test, codename [[Chagai-II]], (30 May 1998) at Kharan Desert was a successful test of a sophisticated, compact, but powerful bomb designed to be carried by missiles.\n\nUltra-centrifugation for obtaining U-235 cannot be done simply by putting natural uranium through the centrifuges. It requires the complete mastery over the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle, beginning at uranium mining and refining, production of uranium ore or yellow cake, conversion of ore into [[uranium dioxide]] ({{chem|UO|2}}) (which is used to make nuclear fuel for natural uranium reactors like Khushab and KANUPP), conversion of UO<sub>2</sub> into [[uranium tetrafluoride]] ({{chem|UF|4}}) and then into the feedstock for enrichment ({{chem|UF|6}}).\n\nThe complete mastery of fluorine chemistry and production of highly toxic and corrosive hydrofluoric acid and other fluorine compounds is required. The UF<sub>6</sub> is pumped into the centrifuges for enrichment. The process is then repeated in reverse until UF<sub>4</sub> is produced, leading to the production of uranium metal, the form in which U-235 is used in a bomb.\n\nIt is estimated that there are approximately 10,000\u201320,000 centrifuges in Kahuta. This means that with P2 machines, they would be producing between 75\u2013100&nbsp;kg of HEU since 1986, when full production of weapons-grade HEU began. Also the production of HEU was voluntarily capped by Pakistan between 1991 and 1997, and the five nuclear tests of 28 May 1998 also consumed HEU. So it is safe to assume that between 1986 and 2005 (prior to the 2005 earthquake), KRL produced 1500&nbsp;kg of HEU. Accounting for losses in the production of weapons, it can be assumed that each weapon would need 20&nbsp;kg of HEU; sufficient for 75 bombs as in 2005.\n\nPakistan's first nuclear tests were made in May 1998, when six warheads were tested under codename [[Chagai-I]] and [[Chagai-II]]. It is reported that the yields from these tests were 12&nbsp;kt, 30 to 36&nbsp;kt and four low-yield (below 1&nbsp;kt) tests. From these tests Pakistan can be estimated to have developed operational warheads of 20 to 25&nbsp;kt and 150&nbsp;kt in the shape of low weight compact designs and may have 300\u2013500&nbsp;kt<ref name=\"defense-update.com\">{{cite web |url=http://defense-update.com/analysis/analysis_pakistan_240409.html |title=Pakistan's Nukes \u2013 Al-Qaeda's Next Strategic Surprise? \u2013 Defense Update News Analysis |publisher=Defense-update.com |accessdate=21 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205120735/http://www.defense-update.com/analysis/analysis_pakistan_240409.html |archivedate=5 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> large-size warheads.

One was that Pakistan did not want to be an irresponsible state and the PAEC under Munir Ahmed Khan did not divert spent fuel from the safeguarded KANUPP for reprocessing at the New Labs. The second one was allocation of resources.\n\nAlternatively, it is hard to believe that Pakistan had the engineering capability to produce plutonium for nuclear bombs in the early 70s, when it could not even complete the less difficult step of subcritical, [[nuclear weapons testing|cold testing]] until 1983 in [[Kirana Hills]].

Consequently, Pakistan built the 40\u201350 MW (megawatt, thermal) [[Khushab Reactor Complex]] at Joharabad, and in April 1998, Pakistan announced that the nuclear reactor was operational. The Khushab reactor project was initiated in 1986 by Munir Khan, who informed the world that the reactor was totally indigenous, i.e. that it was designed and built by Pakistani scientists and engineers. Various Pakistani industries contributed in 82% of the reactor's construction. The Project-Director for this project was [[Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood]].

Correspondingly, the critical mass of a bare mass sphere of plutonium-239 is 8\u201310&nbsp;kg. The bomb that destroyed Hiroshima used 60&nbsp;kg of U-235 while the Nagasaki Pu bomb used only 6&nbsp;kg of Pu-239. Since all Pakistani bomb designs are implosion-type weapons, they will typically use between 15\u201325&nbsp;kg of U-235 for their cores. Reducing the amount of U-235 in cores from 60&nbsp;kg in gun-type devices to 25&nbsp;kg in implosion devices is only possible by using good neutron reflector/tamper material such as beryllium metal, which increases the weight of the bomb. And the uranium, like plutonium, is only usable in the core of a bomb in metallic form.\n\nHowever, only 2\u20134&nbsp;kg of plutonium is needed for the same device that would need 20\u201325&nbsp;kg of U-235. Additionally, a few grams of tritium (a by-product of plutonium production reactors and thermonuclear fuel) can increase the overall yield of the bombs by a factor of three to four. \"The sixth Pakistan nuclear test, codename [[Chagai-II]], (30 May 1998) at Kharan Desert was a successful test of a sophisticated, compact, but powerful bomb designed to be carried by missiles.\n\nUltra-centrifugation for obtaining U-235 cannot be done simply by putting natural uranium through the centrifuges. It requires the complete mastery over the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle, beginning at uranium mining and refining, production of uranium ore or yellow cake, conversion of ore into [[uranium dioxide]] ({{chem|UO|2}}) (which is used to make nuclear fuel for natural uranium reactors like Khushab and KANUPP), conversion of UO<sub>2</sub> into [[uranium tetrafluoride]] ({{chem|UF|4}}) and then into the feedstock for enrichment ({{chem|UF|6}}).\n\nThe complete mastery of fluorine chemistry and production of highly toxic and corrosive hydrofluoric acid and other fluorine compounds is required. The UF<sub>6</sub> is pumped into the centrifuges for enrichment. The process is then repeated in reverse until UF<sub>4</sub> is produced, leading to the production of uranium metal, the form in which U-235 is used in a bomb.\n\nIt is estimated that there are approximately 10,000\u201320,000 centrifuges in Kahuta. This means that with P2 machines, they would be producing between 75\u2013100&nbsp;kg of HEU since 1986, when full production of weapons-grade HEU began. Also the production of HEU was voluntarily capped by Pakistan between 1991 and 1997, and the five nuclear tests of 28 May 1998 also consumed HEU. So it is safe to assume that between 1986 and 2005 (prior to the 2005 earthquake), KRL produced 1500&nbsp;kg of HEU. Accounting for losses in the production of weapons, it can be assumed that each weapon would need 20&nbsp;kg of HEU; sufficient for 75 bombs as in 2005.\n\nPakistan's first nuclear tests were made in May 1998, when six warheads were tested under codename [[Chagai-I]] and [[Chagai-II]]. It is reported that the yields from these tests were 12&nbsp;kt, 30 to 36&nbsp;kt and four low-yield (below 1&nbsp;kt) tests. From these tests Pakistan can be estimated to have developed operational warheads of 20 to 25&nbsp;kt and 150&nbsp;kt in the shape of low weight compact designs and may have 300\u2013500&nbsp;kt<ref name=\"defense-update.com\">{{cite web |url=http://defense-update.com/analysis/analysis_pakistan_240409.html |title=Pakistan's Nukes \u2013 Al-Qaeda's Next Strategic Surprise? \u2013 Defense Update News Analysis |publisher=Defense-update.com |accessdate=21 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205120735/http://www.defense-update.com/analysis/analysis_pakistan_240409.html |archivedate=5 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> large-size warheads.

The relative weakness in defence warfare is highlighted in Pakistan's nuclear posture, which Pakistan considers its primary deterrent from Indian conventional offensives or nuclear attack. Nuclear theorist [[Brigadier-General]] Feroz Hassan Khan adds: \"The Pakistani situation is akin to [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]]'s position in the [[Cold War]]. There are geographic gaps and corridors similar to those that existed in Europe ... that are vulnerable to exploitation by mechanized [[Indian forces]] ... With its relatively smaller conventional force, and lacking adequate technical means, especially in early warning and surveillance, Pakistan relies on a more proactive nuclear defensive policy.\"<ref name=\"Feroz Khan\">{{cite journal|last=Khan|first=Feroz|title=Challenges to Nuclear Stability in South Asia|journal=Nonproliferation Review|date=Spring 2003|volume=10|series=No. 1|page=65|url=http://cns.miis.edu/npr/pdfs/101khan.pdf|accessdate=4 January 2013|doi=10.1080/10736700308436917|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606194812/http://cns.miis.edu/npr/pdfs/101khan.pdf|archivedate=6 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIndian political scientist Vipin Narang, however, argues that Pakistan's asymmetric escalation posture, or the rapid first use of nuclear weapons against conventional attacks to deter their outbreak, increases instability in South Asia.

The shapes of these virus particles range from simple [[helix|helical]] and [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] forms to more complex structures. Most virus species have virions too small to be seen with an [[optical microscope]], about one hundredth the size of most bacteria.\n\nThe origins of viruses in the [[evolutionary history of life]] are unclear: some may have [[evolution|evolved]] from [[plasmid]]s\u2014pieces of DNA that can move between cells\u2014while others may have evolved from bacteria. In evolution, viruses are an important means of [[horizontal gene transfer]], which increases [[genetic diversity]] in a way analogous to [[sexual reproduction]].<ref name=\"Canchaya\" /> Viruses are considered by some [[biologist]]s to be a life form, because they carry genetic material, reproduce, and evolve through [[natural selection]], although they lack key characteristics (such as cell structure) that are generally considered necessary to count as life. Because they possess some but not all such qualities, viruses have been described as \"organisms at the edge of life\",<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal| vauthors = Rybicki EP |year = 1990|title = The classification of organisms at the edge of life, or problems with virus systematics|journal = South African Journal of Science |volume = 86|pages = 182\u201386}}</ref> and as [[Self-replication|replicators]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Koonin EV, Starokadomskyy P | title = Are viruses alive?

One transmission pathway is through disease-bearing organisms known as [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]: for example, viruses are often transmitted from plant to plant by insects that feed on [[plant sap]], such as [[aphid]]s; and viruses in animals can be carried by [[Hematophagy|blood-sucking]] insects. [[influenza|Influenza viruses]] are spread by coughing and sneezing. [[Norovirus]] and [[rotavirus]], common causes of viral [[gastroenteritis]], are transmitted by the [[fecal\u2013oral route|faecal\u2013oral route]], passed by contact and entering the body in food or water. [[HIV]] is one of several viruses transmitted through [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexual contact]] and by exposure to infected blood. The variety of host cells that a virus can infect is called its \"[[Host specificity|host range]]\". This can be narrow, meaning a virus is capable of infecting few species, or broad, meaning it is capable of infecting many.<ref>Shors pp. 49\u201350</ref>\n\nViral infections in animals provoke an [[immune response]] that usually eliminates the infecting virus. Immune responses can also be produced by [[vaccine]]s, which confer an [[immunity (medical)|artificially acquired immunity]] to the specific viral infection. Some viruses, including those that cause AIDS, [[Human papillomavirus infection|HPV infection]], and [[viral hepatitis]], evade these immune responses and result in [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] infections.

This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions which can be short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic material (typically single-stranded RNA, but ssDNA in some cases) is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, the length of a helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it, and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres. The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus is an example of a helical virus.<ref>Collier p. 37</ref>\n\n; Icosahedral: Most animal viruses are icosahedral or near-spherical with chiral [[icosahedral symmetry]]. A [[regular icosahedron]] is the optimum way of forming a closed shell from identical sub-units. The minimum number of identical capsomeres required for each triangular face is 3, which gives 60 for the icosahedron. Many viruses, such as rotavirus, have more than 60 capsomers and appear spherical but they retain this symmetry. To achieve this, the capsomeres at the apices are surrounded by five other capsomeres and are called pentons. Capsomeres on the triangular faces are surrounded by six others and are called [[Hexon protein|hexons]].<ref>Collier pp. 40, 42</ref> Hexons are in essence flat and pentons, which form the 12 vertices, are curved.

The type of nucleic acid is irrelevant to the shape of the genome. Among RNA viruses and certain DNA viruses, the genome is often divided up into separate parts, in which case it is called segmented.

All segments are not required to be in the same virion for the virus to be infectious, as demonstrated by [[brome mosaic virus]] and several other plant viruses.<ref name=\"Collier3355\" />\n\nA viral genome, irrespective of nucleic acid type, is almost always either single-stranded or double-stranded. Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle. Double-stranded genomes consist of two complementary paired nucleic acids, analogous to a ladder. The virus particles of some virus families, such as those belonging to the ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'', contain a genome that is partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded.<ref name=\"Collier9699\" />\n\nFor most viruses with RNA genomes and some with single-stranded DNA genomes, the single strands are said to be either [[positive-sense]] (called the 'plus-strand') or [[negative-sense]] (called the 'minus-strand'), depending on if they are complementary to the viral [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA). Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately [[translation (genetics)|translated]] by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]] before translation.

This is because its surface protein, [[gp120]], specifically interacts with the [[CD4]] molecule\u2014a [[chemokine receptor]]\u2014which is most commonly found on the surface of [[CD4+]] [[T-Cells]]. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells in which they are capable of replication.

Some viruses undergo a [[lysogenic cycle]] where the viral genome is incorporated by [[genetic recombination]] into a specific place in the host's chromosome. The viral genome is then known as a \"[[provirus]]\" or, in the case of bacteriophages a \"[[prophage]]\".<ref>Shors pp. 60, 597</ref> Whenever the host divides, the viral genome is also replicated. The viral genome is mostly silent within the host. At some point, the provirus or prophage may give rise to active virus, which may lyse the host cells.<ref>Dimmock, Chapter 15, ''Mechanisms in virus latentcy'', pp. 243\u201359</ref> Enveloped viruses (e.g., HIV) typically are released from the host cell by [[viral shedding|budding]].

If the cell has the appropriate receptor on its surface, these viruses enter the cell sometimes by direct fusion with the cell membrane (e.g., herpesviruses) or\u2014more usually\u2014by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell's DNA and RNA synthesising machinery, and RNA processing machinery. Viruses with larger genomes may encode much of this machinery themselves. In eukaryotes the viral genome must cross the cell's nuclear membrane to access this machinery, while in bacteria it need only enter the cell.<ref>Shors p. 54; Collier p. 78</ref>\n\n; [[RNA virus]]es: Replication usually takes place in the [[cytoplasm]]. RNA viruses can be placed into four different groups depending on their modes of replication. The [[Sense (molecular biology)|polarity]] (whether or not it can be used directly by ribosomes to make proteins) of single-stranded RNA viruses largely determines the replicative mechanism; the other major criterion is whether the genetic material is single-stranded or double-stranded. All RNA viruses use their own [[RNA replicase]] enzymes to create copies of their genomes.<ref>Collier p. 79</ref>\n\n; [[Reverse transcribing viruses]]: These have ssRNA (''[[Retroviridae]]'', ''[[Metaviridae]]'', ''[[Pseudoviridae]]'') or dsDNA (''[[Caulimoviridae]]'', and ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'') in their particles. Reverse transcribing viruses with RNA genomes (retroviruses), use a DNA intermediate to replicate, whereas those with DNA genomes (pararetroviruses) use an RNA intermediate during genome replication. Both types use a [[reverse transcriptase]], or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme, to carry out the nucleic acid conversion. [[Retrovirus]]es integrate the DNA produced by [[reverse transcription]] into the host genome as a provirus as a part of the replication process; pararetroviruses do not, although integrated genome copies of especially plant pararetroviruses can give rise to infectious virus.<ref name=\"pmid16949329\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Staginnus C, Richert-P\u00f6ggeler KR | title = Endogenous pararetroviruses: two-faced travelers in the plant genome | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 11 | issue = 10 | pages = 485\u201391 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 16949329 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2006.08.008 }}</ref> They are susceptible to [[antiviral drug]]s that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme, e.g. [[zidovudine]] and [[lamivudine]].

Viruses must generate mRNAs from their genomes to produce proteins and replicate themselves, but different mechanisms are used to achieve this in each virus family. Viral genomes may be single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds), RNA or DNA, and may or may not use [[reverse transcriptase]] (RT). In addition, ssRNA viruses may be either [[sense (molecular biology)|sense]] (+) or antisense (\u2212). This classification places viruses into seven groups:\n\n{{Baltimore groups}}\n\nAs an example of viral classification, the [[chicken pox]] virus, [[varicella zoster]] (VZV), belongs to the order ''[[Herpesvirales]]'', family ''[[Herpesviridae]]'', subfamily ''[[Alphaherpesvirinae]]'', and genus ''[[Varicellovirus]]''. VZV is in Group I of the Baltimore Classification because it is a dsDNA virus that does not use reverse transcriptase.\n\nThe complete set of viruses in an organism or habitat is called the [[virome]]; for example, all human viruses constitute the [[human virome]].<ref name=\"pmid27698618\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Parker MT | title = An Ecological Framework of the Human Virome Provides Classification of Current Knowledge and Identifies Areas of Forthcoming Discovery | journal = The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine | volume = 89 | issue = 3 | pages = 339\u2013351 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 27698618 | pmc = 5045143 | doi =  }}</ref>\n\n== Role in human disease ==\n[[File:Viral infections and involved species.png|thumb|alt=A photograph of the upper body of a man labelled with the names of viruses that infect the different parts|Overview of the main types of viral infection and the most notable species involved<ref name=\"Microbiology\">Mainly Chapter 33 (Disease summaries), pp. 367\u201392 in:{{cite book| last1 = Fisher | first1 = Bruce | last2 = Harvey | first2 = Richard P. | last3 = Champe | first3 =  Pamela C. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews: Microbiology |series=Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews Series |publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Hagerstwon, MD|year=2007|pages= 367\u201392|isbn=978-0-7817-8215-9}}</ref>]]\n{{See also|Viral disease}}\n\nExamples of common human diseases caused by viruses include the [[common cold]], influenza, [[chickenpox]], and [[cold sores]].

From the viewpoint of a materials scientist, viruses can be regarded as organic nanoparticles.\nTheir surface carries specific tools designed to cross the barriers of their host cells. The size and shape of viruses and the number and nature of the functional groups on their surface is precisely defined. As such, viruses are commonly used in materials science as scaffolds for covalently linked surface modifications. A particular quality of viruses is that they can be tailored by directed evolution. The powerful techniques developed by life sciences are becoming the basis of engineering approaches towards nanomaterials, opening a wide range of applications far beyond biology and medicine.<ref name=\"fischlechner\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fischlechner M, Donath E | title = Viruses as building blocks for materials and devices | journal = Angewandte Chemie | volume = 46 | issue = 18 | pages = 3184\u201393 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17348058 | doi = 10.1002/anie.200603445 }}</ref>\n\nBecause of their size, shape, and well-defined chemical structures, viruses have been used as templates for organising materials on the nanoscale.

The shapes of these virus particles range from simple [[helix|helical]] and [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] forms to more complex structures. Most virus species have virions too small to be seen with an [[optical microscope]], about one hundredth the size of most bacteria.\n\nThe origins of viruses in the [[evolutionary history of life]] are unclear: some may have [[evolution|evolved]] from [[plasmid]]s\u2014pieces of DNA that can move between cells\u2014while others may have evolved from bacteria. In evolution, viruses are an important means of [[horizontal gene transfer]], which increases [[genetic diversity]] in a way analogous to [[sexual reproduction]].<ref name=\"Canchaya\" /> Viruses are considered by some [[biologist]]s to be a life form, because they carry genetic material, reproduce, and evolve through [[natural selection]], although they lack key characteristics (such as cell structure) that are generally considered necessary to count as life.

One transmission pathway is through disease-bearing organisms known as [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]: for example, viruses are often transmitted from plant to plant by insects that feed on [[plant sap]], such as [[aphid]]s; and viruses in animals can be carried by [[Hematophagy|blood-sucking]] insects. [[influenza|Influenza viruses]] are spread by coughing and sneezing. [[Norovirus]] and [[rotavirus]], common causes of viral [[gastroenteritis]], are transmitted by the [[fecal\u2013oral route|faecal\u2013oral route]], passed by contact and entering the body in food or water. [[HIV]] is one of several viruses transmitted through [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexual contact]] and by exposure to infected blood. The variety of host cells that a virus can infect is called its \"[[Host specificity|host range]]\". This can be narrow, meaning a virus is capable of infecting few species, or broad, meaning it is capable of infecting many.<ref>Shors pp. 49\u201350</ref>\n\nViral infections in animals provoke an [[immune response]] that usually eliminates the infecting virus. Immune responses can also be produced by [[vaccine]]s, which confer an [[immunity (medical)|artificially acquired immunity]] to the specific viral infection. Some viruses, including those that cause AIDS, [[Human papillomavirus infection|HPV infection]], and [[viral hepatitis]], evade these immune responses and result in [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] infections.

This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions which can be short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic material (typically single-stranded RNA, but ssDNA in some cases) is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, the length of a helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it, and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres. The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus is an example of a helical virus.<ref>Collier p. 37</ref>\n\n; Icosahedral: Most animal viruses are icosahedral or near-spherical with chiral [[icosahedral symmetry]]. A [[regular icosahedron]] is the optimum way of forming a closed shell from identical sub-units. The minimum number of identical capsomeres required for each triangular face is 3, which gives 60 for the icosahedron. Many viruses, such as rotavirus, have more than 60 capsomers and appear spherical but they retain this symmetry. To achieve this, the capsomeres at the apices are surrounded by five other capsomeres and are called pentons. Capsomeres on the triangular faces are surrounded by six others and are called [[Hexon protein|hexons]].<ref>Collier pp. 40, 42</ref> Hexons are in essence flat and pentons, which form the 12 vertices, are curved.

The type of nucleic acid is irrelevant to the shape of the genome. Among RNA viruses and certain DNA viruses, the genome is often divided up into separate parts, in which case it is called segmented.

Single-stranded genomes consist of an unpaired nucleic acid, analogous to one-half of a ladder split down the middle. Double-stranded genomes consist of two complementary paired nucleic acids, analogous to a ladder. The virus particles of some virus families, such as those belonging to the ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'', contain a genome that is partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded.<ref name=\"Collier9699\" />\n\nFor most viruses with RNA genomes and some with single-stranded DNA genomes, the single strands are said to be either [[positive-sense]] (called the 'plus-strand') or [[negative-sense]] (called the 'minus-strand'), depending on if they are complementary to the viral [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA). Positive-sense viral RNA is in the same sense as viral mRNA and thus at least a part of it can be immediately [[translation (genetics)|translated]] by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]] before translation. DNA nomenclature for viruses with single-sense genomic ssDNA is similar to RNA nomenclature, in that positive-strand viral ssDNA is identical in sequence to the viral mRNA and is thus a coding strand, while negative-strand viral ssDNA is complementary to the viral mRNA and is thus a template strand.<ref name=\"Collier9699\" /> Several types of ssDNA and ssRNA viruses have genomes that are [[ambisense]] in that transcription can occur off both strands in a double-stranded replicative intermediate.

Some viruses undergo a [[lysogenic cycle]] where the viral genome is incorporated by [[genetic recombination]] into a specific place in the host's chromosome. The viral genome is then known as a \"[[provirus]]\" or, in the case of bacteriophages a \"[[prophage]]\".<ref>Shors pp. 60, 597</ref> Whenever the host divides, the viral genome is also replicated.

If the cell has the appropriate receptor on its surface, these viruses enter the cell sometimes by direct fusion with the cell membrane (e.g., herpesviruses) or\u2014more usually\u2014by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell's DNA and RNA synthesising machinery, and RNA processing machinery. Viruses with larger genomes may encode much of this machinery themselves. In eukaryotes the viral genome must cross the cell's nuclear membrane to access this machinery, while in bacteria it need only enter the cell.<ref>Shors p. 54; Collier p. 78</ref>\n\n; [[RNA virus]]es: Replication usually takes place in the [[cytoplasm]]. RNA viruses can be placed into four different groups depending on their modes of replication. The [[Sense (molecular biology)|polarity]] (whether or not it can be used directly by ribosomes to make proteins) of single-stranded RNA viruses largely determines the replicative mechanism; the other major criterion is whether the genetic material is single-stranded or double-stranded. All RNA viruses use their own [[RNA replicase]] enzymes to create copies of their genomes.<ref>Collier p. 79</ref>\n\n; [[Reverse transcribing viruses]]: These have ssRNA (''[[Retroviridae]]'', ''[[Metaviridae]]'', ''[[Pseudoviridae]]'') or dsDNA (''[[Caulimoviridae]]'', and ''[[Hepadnaviridae]]'') in their particles. Reverse transcribing viruses with RNA genomes (retroviruses), use a DNA intermediate to replicate, whereas those with DNA genomes (pararetroviruses) use an RNA intermediate during genome replication. Both types use a [[reverse transcriptase]], or RNA-dependent DNA polymerase enzyme, to carry out the nucleic acid conversion. [[Retrovirus]]es integrate the DNA produced by [[reverse transcription]] into the host genome as a provirus as a part of the replication process; pararetroviruses do not, although integrated genome copies of especially plant pararetroviruses can give rise to infectious virus.<ref name=\"pmid16949329\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Staginnus C, Richert-P\u00f6ggeler KR | title = Endogenous pararetroviruses: two-faced travelers in the plant genome | journal = Trends in Plant Science | volume = 11 | issue = 10 | pages = 485\u201391 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 16949329 | doi = 10.1016/j.tplants.2006.08.008 }}</ref> They are susceptible to [[antiviral drug]]s that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme, e.g. [[zidovudine]] and [[lamivudine]].

From the viewpoint of a materials scientist, viruses can be regarded as organic nanoparticles.\nTheir surface carries specific tools designed to cross the barriers of their host cells. The size and shape of viruses and the number and nature of the functional groups on their surface is precisely defined. As such, viruses are commonly used in materials science as scaffolds for covalently linked surface modifications. A particular quality of viruses is that they can be tailored by directed evolution.

The dock was deeply indented with four solid piers, each 152 m long by 43 m wide, on which were constructed two-storey warehouses. Other warehouses, granaries, shed and storage buildings surrounded the dock, which had a total of 3.6&nbsp;km of quays.<ref name=Naib/>{{rp|17}}\n\nThe dock was an immediate commercial success, as it could easily accommodate all but the very largest steamships. By 1860, it was already taking over 850,000 tons of shipping a year \u2013 double that of the [[London Docks]], four times that of [[St Katharine Docks]] and 70% more than the [[West India Docks|West India Dock]] and [[East India Docks]] combined. It was badly damaged by German bombing in [[World War II]] but experienced a resurgence in trade following the war. From the 1960s onwards, the Royal Victoria experienced a steady decline \u2013 as did all of London's other docks \u2013 as the shipping industry adopted [[containerisation]], which effectively moved traffic downstream to [[Port of Tilbury|Tilbury]]. It finally closed to commercial traffic along with the other Royal Docks in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.londonsroyaldocks.com/londons-royal-docks-history/|title= History|publisher=London's Royal Docks|accessdate=30 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, the then-dilapidated site was chosen by French electronic musician [[Jean Michel Jarre]] as the site for one of his signature large-scale concerts, eventually titled [[Destination Docklands]].

The dock was deeply indented with four solid piers, each 152 m long by 43 m wide, on which were constructed two-storey warehouses. Other warehouses, granaries, shed and storage buildings surrounded the dock, which had a total of 3.6&nbsp;km of quays.<ref name=Naib/>{{rp|17}}\n\nThe dock was an immediate commercial success, as it could easily accommodate all but the very largest steamships. By 1860, it was already taking over 850,000 tons of shipping a year \u2013 double that of the [[London Docks]], four times that of [[St Katharine Docks]] and 70% more than the [[West India Docks|West India Dock]] and [[East India Docks]] combined. It was badly damaged by German bombing in [[World War II]] but experienced a resurgence in trade following the war. From the 1960s onwards, the Royal Victoria experienced a steady decline \u2013 as did all of London's other docks \u2013 as the shipping industry adopted [[containerisation]], which effectively moved traffic downstream to [[Port of Tilbury|Tilbury]]. It finally closed to commercial traffic along with the other Royal Docks in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.londonsroyaldocks.com/londons-royal-docks-history/|title= History|publisher=London's Royal Docks|accessdate=30 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, the then-dilapidated site was chosen by French electronic musician [[Jean Michel Jarre]] as the site for one of his signature large-scale concerts, eventually titled [[Destination Docklands]].

He appeared in more than 180 films.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Early years ==\nBorn in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], Sutton was raised in [[Florida]] where he attended [[St. Petersburg High School]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Career ==\nSutton began his career during the [[silent film]] era and made the transition to [[sound film]]s with the college themed [[shorts]] ''The Boy Friends''.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-grady-sutton-1602975.html|title=Obituary: Grady Sutton|last=Gifford|first=Denis |date=1995-09-26|newspaper=The Independent (London)|accessdate=2009-01-29}}</ref> He moved on to countless character roles, where he frequently played dimwitted country boys. His best-known roles were as Frank Dowling, [[Katharine Hepburn]]'s dancing partner, in ''[[Alice Adams (1935 film)|Alice Adams]]'' (1935) and as a foil to [[W.C. Fields]] in four films,''[[The Pharmacist (1933 film)|The Pharmacist]]'' (1933), ''[[Man on the Flying Trapeze]]'' (1935), ''[[You Can't Cheat an Honest Man]]'' (1939), and ''[[The Bank Dick]]'' (1940).\n\nFilm historian William J. Mann characterizes Sutton as a typical \"Hollywood Sissy,\" that is as a [[Homosexuality|gay]] actor who ordinarily portrayed an effeminate character for comedic effect.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mann |first=William J. |author-link=William J.

The strength of his association with Fields was such that it was mentioned in the commentary for ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]''. Sutton has a non-speaking role in some of the formal-dress scenes, and subtly performs some comic shtick. The commentator refers to him as \"an old W. C. Fields actor\".\n\nOn television, Sutton appeared in ''The Odd Couple'', and he was seen in some commercials.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Death ==\nOn September 17, 1995,<ref name=\":0\" /> Sutton died at the [[Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital]] in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California|Woodland Hills, California]] at the age of 89.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE5DC133EF93BA1575AC0A963958260|title=Grady Sutton, 89, a Comic Foil to Fields, Hepburn and Lombard|date=1992-10-28|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-01-29}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n===Film===\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%;\" \n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\"\n!

His best-known roles were as Frank Dowling, [[Katharine Hepburn]]'s dancing partner, in ''[[Alice Adams (1935 film)|Alice Adams]]'' (1935) and as a foil to [[W.C. Fields]] in four films,''[[The Pharmacist (1933 film)|The Pharmacist]]'' (1933), ''[[Man on the Flying Trapeze]]'' (1935), ''[[You Can't Cheat an Honest Man]]'' (1939), and ''[[The Bank Dick]]'' (1940).\n\nFilm historian William J. Mann characterizes Sutton as a typical \"Hollywood Sissy,\" that is as a [[Homosexuality|gay]] actor who ordinarily portrayed an effeminate character for comedic effect.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mann |first=William J. |author-link=William J.

The strength of his association with Fields was such that it was mentioned in the commentary for ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]''. Sutton has a non-speaking role in some of the formal-dress scenes, and subtly performs some comic shtick. The commentator refers to him as \"an old W. C. Fields actor\".\n\nOn television, Sutton appeared in ''The Odd Couple'', and he was seen in some commercials.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Death ==\nOn September 17, 1995,<ref name=\":0\" /> Sutton died at the [[Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital]] in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, California|Woodland Hills, California]] at the age of 89.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE5DC133EF93BA1575AC0A963958260|title=Grady Sutton, 89, a Comic Foil to Fields, Hepburn and Lombard|date=1992-10-28|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-01-29}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n===Film===\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%;\" \n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\"\n!

Occurrences during [[prenatal development]] may be important; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth.<ref>{{cite journal|url=|title=Prenatal thumb sucking is related to postnatal handedness| doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.08.009|pmid=15707608|volume=43|issue=3|journal=Neuropsychologia|pages=313\u2013315|year=2005 | last1 = Hepper | first1 = Peter G.}}</ref> In a 2013 study, 39% of infants (6 to 14 months) and 97% of toddlers (18 to 24 months) demonstrated a hand preference.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Nelson EL, Campbell JM, Michel GF | year = 2013 | title = Unimanual to bimanual: Tracking the development of handedness from 6 to 24 months | journal = Infant Behavior and Development | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 181\u2013188 | pmc=3615031 | doi=10.1016/j.infbeh.2013.01.009 | pmid=23454419}}</ref>\n\n=== Division of labor ===\nOne common theory as to how handedness affects the hemispheres is the brain hemisphere division of labor. Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor.<ref name=book>{{cite book |last=Banich |first=Marie |authorlink=Marie Banich |year=1997 |title=Neuropsychology: The Neural Bases of Mental Function|url=https://archive.org/details/neuropsychologyn00bani |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nVerbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemispheres are either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less [[Lateralization of brain function|lateralized]].<ref name=book/>\n\n=== Genetic factors ===\nHandedness displays a complex inheritance pattern. For example, if both parents of a child are left-handed, there is a 26% chance of that child being left-handed.<ref name=\"McManusChris\">{{cite book | author=McManus, Chris | title=Right Hand, Left Hand | publisher=Phoenix Paperbacks | year=2003 | isbn=978-0753813553}}</ref> A large study of twins from 25,732 families by Medland et al.

About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left [[occiput]] (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either [[vestibular system|vestibular]] abnormalities or delay,<ref>Nonright-handedness, central nervous system and related pathology, and its lateralization: A reformulation and synthesis.</ref> and asymmetry of the [[vestibular cortex]] is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dieterich | first1 = M. | last2 = Bense | first2 = S. | last3 = Lutz | first3 = S. | last4 = Drzezga | first4 = A. | last5 = Stephan | first5 = T. | last6 = Bartenstein | first6 = P. | last7 = Brandt | first7 = T. | year = 2003 | title = Dominance for vestibular cortical function in the non-dominant hemisphere | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 13 | issue = 9| pages = 994\u20131007 | pmid = 12902399 | doi = 10.1093/cercor/13.9.994 }}</ref>\n\n=== Ultrasound ===\nAnother theory is that [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] may sometimes affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy.

He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain.<ref>[http://www.righthandlefthand.com/ Right-Hand, Left-Hand official website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504153055/http://www.righthandlefthand.com/ |date=2012-05-04 }} Accessed June 2006.</ref>\n\nWriting in ''[[Scientific American]],'' McManus states that,\n<blockquote>Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers' brains are structured differently from right-handers' in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population.<ref>Chris McManus. April 14, 2012.

In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18\u201324 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of their right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), they were more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores.<ref>Nelson, E.L., J.M. Campbell, and G.F.

[[Tight end]]s, when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the [[offensive tackle]] on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's \"blind side,\" is typically the most valued member of the offensive line.

Bowlers have to adjust their shots to compensate for changed rotation of the ball as the game or series goes on. A left-handed bowler throws their shot up the opposite side of the lane than a right-handed bowler, and therefore deals with less breakdown. This means left-handed bowlers have to adjust their shot less frequently than right-handed bowlers in team events or qualifying rounds where there are 4-10 people per set of two lanes. This can allow them to stay more consistent. However, this advantage is not present in bracket rounds and tournament finals where matches are 1v1 on a pair of lanes. \n\n=== Gender ===\nAccording to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.22 male to female odds ratio.<ref name=\"Papadatou\">{{cite journal|last=Papadatou-Pastou|first=M|author2=Martin, M|author3=Munaf\u00f2, MR|author4=Jones, GV|date=September 2008|title=Sex differences in left-handedness: a meta-analysis of 144 studies|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=134|issue=5|pages=677\u201399|doi=10.1037/a0012814|pmid=18729568}}</ref>{{clarify|date=January 2018}}\n\n=== Sexuality and gender identity ===\n{{further|Handedness and sexual orientation}}\nA number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lalumi\u00e8re ML, Blanchard R, Zucker KJ | year = 2000 | title = Sexual orientation and handedness in men and women: a meta-analysis | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 126 | issue = 4 | pages = 575\u2013592 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.4.575 | pmid=10900997}}</ref> though findings are mixed.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| doi = 10.1023/A:1014039403752 \n| pmid = 11910784 \n| year = 2002 \n| last1 = Mustanski | first1 = B.

In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction \"right\" also means \"correct\" or \"proper\". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative, or evil; even into the 20th century, left-handed children were beaten by schoolteachers for writing with their left hand.\n\nThe Latin adjective ''sinister'' or ''sinistra'' (as applied to male or female nouns\u200a\u2060\u2014\u200a\u2060Latin nouns are gender specific) means \"left\" as well as \"unlucky\", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English words \"sinister\" (meaning both 'evil' and 'on the bearer's left on a coat of arms') and \"ambisinister\" meaning 'awkward or clumsy with both or either hand'.\n\nThere are many negative connotations associated with the phrase \"left-handed\": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A \"left-handed compliment\" is one that has two meanings, one of which is unflattering to the recipient. In [[French language|French]], ''gauche'' means both \"left\" and \"awkward\" or \"clumsy\", while ''droit(e)'' ([[cognate]] to English ''direct'' and related to \"adroit\") means both \"right\" and \"straight\", as well as \"law\" and the legal sense of \"right\". The name \"Dexter\" derives from the Latin for \"right\", as does the word \"dexterity\" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.\n\n[[Black magic]] is sometimes referred to as the \"[[left-hand path]]\".\n\nUntil very recently in [[Taiwan]] (and still in [[Mainland China]], [[Japan]] and [[Korea|both North and South Korea]]), left-handed people were forced to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of [[stroke order]], developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/243637.htm|title=A question of the left being right \u2013 and normal|work=China Daily|date=February 22, 2008|accessdate=2011-01-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110124025533/http://china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/243637.htm| archivedate= January 24, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the [[Latin alphabet]] might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward.<ref>[http://www.lefthander-consulting.org/deutsch/InfoSchreiben.htm Erste deutsche Beratungs- und Informationsstelle f\u00fcr Linksh\u00e4nder und umge-schulte Linksh\u00e4nder] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922143207/http://www.lefthander-consulting.org/deutsch/InfoSchreiben.htm |date=2013-09-22 }}.

Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor.<ref name=book>{{cite book |last=Banich |first=Marie |authorlink=Marie Banich |year=1997 |title=Neuropsychology: The Neural Bases of Mental Function|url=https://archive.org/details/neuropsychologyn00bani |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nVerbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemispheres are either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less [[Lateralization of brain function|lateralized]].<ref name=book/>\n\n=== Genetic factors ===\nHandedness displays a complex inheritance pattern.

About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left [[occiput]] (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either [[vestibular system|vestibular]] abnormalities or delay,<ref>Nonright-handedness, central nervous system and related pathology, and its lateralization: A reformulation and synthesis.</ref> and asymmetry of the [[vestibular cortex]] is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dieterich | first1 = M. | last2 = Bense | first2 = S. | last3 = Lutz | first3 = S. | last4 = Drzezga | first4 = A. | last5 = Stephan | first5 = T. | last6 = Bartenstein | first6 = P. | last7 = Brandt | first7 = T. | year = 2003 | title = Dominance for vestibular cortical function in the non-dominant hemisphere | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 13 | issue = 9| pages = 994\u20131007 | pmid = 12902399 | doi = 10.1093/cercor/13.9.994 }}</ref>\n\n=== Ultrasound ===\nAnother theory is that [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] may sometimes affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy.

He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain.<ref>[http://www.righthandlefthand.com/ Right-Hand, Left-Hand official website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504153055/http://www.righthandlefthand.com/ |date=2012-05-04 }} Accessed June 2006.</ref>\n\nWriting in ''[[Scientific American]],'' McManus states that,\n<blockquote>Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers' brains are structured differently from right-handers' in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population.<ref>Chris McManus. April 14, 2012.

In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18\u201324 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of their right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), they were more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores.<ref>Nelson, E.L., J.M. Campbell, and G.F.

[[Tight end]]s, when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the [[offensive tackle]] on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's \"blind side,\" is typically the most valued member of the offensive line.

Bowlers have to adjust their shots to compensate for increased rotation of the ball as the game or series goes on. A left-handed bowler throws their shot up the opposite side of the lane than a right-handed bowler, and therefore deals with less breakdown. This means left-handed bowlers have to adjust their shot less frequently than right-handed bowlers in team events or qualifying rounds where there are 4-10 people per set of two lanes. This can allow them to stay more consistent. However, this advantage is not present in bracket rounds and tournament finals where matches are 1v1 on a pair of lanes. \n\n=== Gender ===\nAccording to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.22 male to female odds ratio.<ref name=\"Papadatou\">{{cite journal|last=Papadatou-Pastou|first=M|author2=Martin, M|author3=Munaf\u00f2, MR|author4=Jones, GV|date=September 2008|title=Sex differences in left-handedness: a meta-analysis of 144 studies|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=134|issue=5|pages=677\u201399|doi=10.1037/a0012814|pmid=18729568}}</ref>{{clarify|date=January 2018}}\n\n=== Sexuality and gender identity ===\n{{further|Handedness and sexual orientation}}\nA number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lalumi\u00e8re ML, Blanchard R, Zucker KJ | year = 2000 | title = Sexual orientation and handedness in men and women: a meta-analysis | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 126 | issue = 4 | pages = 575\u2013592 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.4.575 | pmid=10900997}}</ref> though findings are mixed.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| doi = 10.1023/A:1014039403752 \n| pmid = 11910784 \n| year = 2002 \n| last1 = Mustanski | first1 = B.

In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction \"right\" also means \"correct\" or \"proper\". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative, or evil; even into the 20th century, left-handed children were beaten by schoolteachers for writing with their left hand.\n\nThe Latin adjective ''sinister'' or ''sinistra'' (as applied to male or female nouns\u200a\u2060\u2014\u200a\u2060Latin nouns are gender specific) means \"left\" as well as \"unlucky\", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English words \"sinister\" (meaning both 'evil' and 'on the bearer's left on a coat of arms') and \"ambisinister\" meaning 'awkward or clumsy with both or either hand'.\n\nThere are many negative connotations associated with the phrase \"left-handed\": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A \"left-handed compliment\" is one that has two meanings, one of which is unflattering to the recipient. In [[French language|French]], ''gauche'' means both \"left\" and \"awkward\" or \"clumsy\", while ''droit(e)'' ([[cognate]] to English ''direct'' and related to \"adroit\") means both \"right\" and \"straight\", as well as \"law\" and the legal sense of \"right\". The name \"Dexter\" derives from the Latin for \"right\", as does the word \"dexterity\" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.\n\n[[Black magic]] is sometimes referred to as the \"[[left-hand path]]\".\n\nUntil very recently in [[Taiwan]] (and still in [[Mainland China]], [[Japan]] and [[Korea|both North and South Korea]]), left-handed people were forced to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of [[stroke order]], developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/243637.htm|title=A question of the left being right \u2013 and normal|work=China Daily|date=February 22, 2008|accessdate=2011-01-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110124025533/http://china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/243637.htm| archivedate= January 24, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the [[Latin alphabet]] might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward.<ref>[http://www.lefthander-consulting.org/deutsch/InfoSchreiben.htm Erste deutsche Beratungs- und Informationsstelle f\u00fcr Linksh\u00e4nder und umge-schulte Linksh\u00e4nder] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922143207/http://www.lefthander-consulting.org/deutsch/InfoSchreiben.htm |date=2013-09-22 }}.

Thousands of left-handed people in today's society have to adapt to use right-handed tools and objects. Again according to the club, \"in the U.K. alone there were over 20 regional events to mark the day in 2001 \u2013 including left-v-right sports matches, a left-handed tea party, pubs using left-handed corkscrews where patrons drank and played pub games with the left hand only, and nationwide 'Lefty Zones' where left-handers' creativity, adaptability and sporting prowess were celebrated, whilst right-handers were encouraged to try out everyday left-handed objects to see just how awkward it can feel using the wrong equipment!\"<ref name=\"about\" />\n\n== In other animals ==\n[[Kangaroo]]s and other [[Macropodidae|macropod]] [[marsupial]]s show a left-hand preference for everyday tasks in the wild. 'True' handedness is unexpected in marsupials however, because unlike [[Placentalia|placental mammals]], they lack a [[corpus callosum]]. Left-handedness was particularly apparent in the red kangaroo (''Macropus rufus'') and the eastern gray kangaroo (''Macropus giganteus''). Red-necked (Bennett's) wallabies (''Macropus rufogriseus'') preferentially use their left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength.

{"title_page": "Social Security Disability Insurance", "text_new": "{{Distinguish|Supplemental Security Income}}\n{{Redirect|SSDI|the death index|Social Security Death Index}}\n\n{{Disability}}\n'''Social Security Disability Insurance''' ('''SSD''' or '''SSDI''') is a [[payroll tax]]-funded [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|federal insurance]] program of the [[United States government]].  It is managed by the [[Social Security Administration]] and designed to provide [[income supplement]]s to people who are physically restricted in their ability to be [[employed]] because of a notable [[disability]] (usually [[physical disability|physical]]). SSD can be supplied on either a temporary or permanent basis, usually directly correlated to whether the person's disability is temporary or permanent.\n\nPeople frequently confuse Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and [[Supplemental Security Income]] (SSI). Unlike SSI, SSDI does not depend on the income of the disabled individual receiving it. A legitimately disabled person (a finding based on legal and medical justification) of any income level can receive SSD. ('Disability' under SSDI is measured by a different standard than under the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]].) Most SSI recipients are below an administratively mandated income threshold, and these individuals must stay below that threshold to continue receiving SSI, unlike with SSD.\n\nInformal names for SSDI include '''Disability Insurance Benefits''' ('''DIB''') and '''Title II benefits'''. These names come from the chapter title of the governing section of the [[Social Security Act]], which came into law in August 1935. In July 1956, after two decades bouncing around Congress, the Social Security Disability Insurance program was put into effect.\n\n==Usage==\nAt the end of 2011, there were 10.6 million Americans collecting SSDI, up from 7.2 million in 2002.<ref>{{cite news|last=Paletta|first=Damian, and Dionne Searcey|title=Jobless Tap Disability Fund|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204296804577121392750460030|accessdate=16 September 2012|newspaper=Wall street Journal|date=28 December 2011}}</ref> The share of the U.S. population receiving SSDI benefits has risen rapidly over the past two decades, from 2.2 percent of adults age 25 to 64 in 1985 to 4.1 percent in 2005.<ref name=Autor2012 /> According to [[David Autor]] and [[Mark Duggan (economist)|Mark Duggan]], aging and changes to the overall health of the U.S. population have had a small effect at most on SSDI usage.<ref name=Autor2012>{{cite journal |last=Autor |first=David |first2=Mark |last2=Duggan |title=The Growth in the Social Security Disability Rolls: A Fiscal Crisis Unfolding |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |year=2006 |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=71\u201396 |doi=10.1257/jep.20.3.71 |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w12436.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIn a 2006 analysis, Autor and Duggan state that the most significant factor in the growth of SSDI usage has been the loosening of the screening process that took place in 1984 following the signing of [[Social Security Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984|an SSDI reform act]] into law; this directed the [[Social Security Administration]] to relax screening of mental illness, place more weight on applicants' reported pain and discomfort, consider multiple non-severe ailments to be disabling, and give more credence to medical evidence provided by the applicant's doctor. These changes had the effect of increasing the number of new SSDI awards and shifting their composition towards claimants with low-mortality disorders such as [[mental illness]] and [[back pain]].\n\nAccording to Autor and Duggan, a second factor in increased SSDI usage was the rising value of SSDI benefits relative to what recipients would have earned from employment. According to this report, a low-income older male SSDI recipient in 1984 would have received from benefits about 68% of the income he would have earned by working; by 2004, due to increasing [[income inequality in the United States|income inequality]], the same man would have received from SSDI benefits 86% of what he would have earned through employment.<ref name=Autor2012 />\n\nAutor and Duggan argue that because the definition of disability adopted in 1984 is quite broad, the SSDI program often functions in practice as an insurance program for unemployable people.<ref name=Autor2012/> Other researchers, however, do not agree with Autor and Duggan's explanation for the increase in Americans getting social security disability.  The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has found demographic factors such as population growth, aging of the baby boom generation, growth in women's labor force participation, and the increase in Social Security's full retirement age from 65 to 66 to be the primary factors in higher rates of SSDI program usage.<ref>https://www.cbpp.org/research/social-security/chart-book-social-security-disability-insurance#Section_two</ref>\n\nIn December 2014, the SSDI program insured approximately 10.9 million beneficiaries including disabled workers and their spouses and children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/issuepapers/ip2015-01.html|title=Social Security Disability Insurance at Age 60: Does It Still Reflect Congress' Original Intent?|last=Policy|first=U.S. Social Security Administration, Office of Retirement and Disability|website=www.ssa.gov|access-date=2016-04-27}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2019, the Social Security Trustees reported that under current law, \"the DI Trust Fund reserves [will] become depleted in 2052 and the OASI Trust Fund reserves [will] become depleted in 2034\".<ref name=\"The 2013 Long-Term Projections for Social Security:\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2019/tr2019.pdf|title=THE 2019 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE FEDERAL OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE AND FEDERAL DISABILITY INSURANCE TRUST FUNDS|date=25 April 2019|website=Social Security Administration}}</ref>\n\n=== Treating physician rule ===\nThe usage has been affected by the \"treating physician rule\" which gives \"controlling weight\" to determinations of the treating physicians.<ref name=TreatingPhysician>(2013).

Prior to the codified rule, federal courts had imposed a similar rule through a [[common law]], but it was inconsistent.<ref name=TreatingPhysician/>\n\nOn January 18, 2017, the security administration published final rules titled \"Revisions to Rules Regarding the Evaluation of Medical Evidence\" regarding the \"treating physician rule\".<ref>revisions-rules.html</ref>  These new rules regarding the assessment of medical opinions in a social security disability case apply to cases filed after March 27, 2017. While these new rules expand the definition of what social security considers to be an \"acceptable medical source\" for disability claim medical opinions to include nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and others, they also have effectively abolished the \"treating physician rule\" by eliminating the requirement that a treating physician opinion be granted \"controlling weight\".<ref>https://nosscr.org/final-rules</ref>\n\n== Payment amount ==\nThe amount that each recipient receives monthly is based upon an average of past earnings. The calculation is based on the average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) which is used to calculate the primary insurance amount (PIA). In 2017, the average monthly disability payment was $1171, and the maximum monthly benefit was $2,687.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bauer|first1=Brandy|title=SSI vs. SSDI: What Are These Benefits and How Do They Differ?|url=https://www.ncoa.org/blog/ssi-vs-ssdi-what-are-these-benefits-how-they-differ/|website=National Council on Aging|accessdate=23 July 2017|date=6 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Qualification==\nAccording to the Social Security Administration (SSA)\n*they have a physical or mental condition that prevents them from engaging in any \"substantial gainful activity\" (\"SGA\"), and\n*the condition is expected to last at least 12 months or result in death, and\n*they are under the age of 65, and\n*generally, they have accumulated 20 social security credits in the last 10 years prior to the onset of disability (normally four credits per full or partial year); one additional credit is required for every year by which the worker's age exceeds 42.<ref>[http://ssa-custhelp.ssa.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/342 Social Security Administration]</ref><ref>{{cite book |author= [[Barbara C.

The parent(s) experience no loss of benefits.\n\nMedical evidence is signs, symptoms and laboratory findings and is required to document the claim.  Symptoms, such as pain, are considered but must be reasonably expected to come from a medically determinable impairment which the claimant is diagnosed to have. The decision is based on a sequential evaluation of medical evidence. The sequence for adults is:\n:1. Is the claimant performing a [[substantial gainful activity]]?  If yes, deny.  If no, continue to next sequence.\n:2. Is the claimant's impairment severe?  If no, deny.  If yes, continue to next sequence.\n:3. Does the impairment meet or equal the severity of impairments in the Listing of Impairments?<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/AdultListings.htm |title=  Listing of Impairments - Adult Listings |accessdate=2008-02-07 |publisher= [[Social Security Administration]]}}</ref> If yes, allow the claim.  If no, continue to next sequence.\n:4. Is the claimant able to perform past work?  If yes, deny.  If no continue to next sequence.\n:5. Is the claimant able to perform any work in the economy?  If yes, deny.  If no allow the claim.\n\nMedical evidence that demonstrates the applicant's inability to work is required. The DDS or ALJ may also require the applicant to visit a third-party physician for medical documentation, often to supplement the evidence treating sources do not supply. The applicant may meet a SSA medical listing for their condition. If their condition does not meet the requirements of a listing, their residual functional capacity is considered, along with their age, past relevant work, and education, in determining their ability to perform either their past work, or other work generally available in the national economy.\n\nDetermination of a residual functional capacity\u2014made in the fourth step in the sequential evaluation process\u2014often constitutes the bulk of the SSDI application and appeal process.  A residual functional capacity is assessed in accordance with Title 20 of the [[Code of Federal Regulations]], part 404, section 1545<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2006/aprqtr/20cfr404.1545.htm|title= 20 CFR \u00a7 404.1545, Your Residual Functional Capacity |accessdate=2008-12-19|publisher=[[Social Security Administration]]}}</ref> by a [[Disability Determination Services|disability determination service]] (DDS) or, on appeal, by an [[administrative law judge]] (ALJ), and is generally based upon the opinions of treating and examining physicians, if available.\n\nResidual functional capacity (RFC) is classified according to the five exertional levels of work defined in the [[Dictionary of Occupational Titles]], which are: Sedentary, Light, Medium, Heavy, and Very Heavy.  If the residual functional capacity of an individual equals the previous work performed, the claim is denied on the basis that the individual can return to former work.  If the residual functional capacity is less than former work then the RFC is applied against a vocational grid that considers the individual's age, education and transferability of formerly learned and used skills.  The vocational grid directs an allowance or denial of benefits.\n\n== Legal representation ==\nApplicants may hire a lawyer or non-attorney representative to help them apply or appeal. There are two primary types of organizations: companies with trained specialists experienced in handling SSDI applications and appeals in some or any local community across the country and law firms which specialize in disability-related cases.\n\nMost SSDI applicants\u2014about 90 percent according to the SSA\u2014have a disability representative for their appeal. An August 2010 report by the Office of Inspector General for the Social Security Administration indicated that many people submitting an initial disability application for SSDI might benefit from using a third-party disability representative when they first apply for benefits. It indicated that having a disability representative earlier in the process significantly improves the chances of those with four major types of disabilities getting approved for SSDI.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ssa.gov/oig/ADOBEPDF/A-07-09-19083.pdf |title=Office of the Inspector General \u2013 Social Security Administration: Disability Impairments on Cases Most Frequently Denied by Disability Determination Services and Subsequently Allowed by Administrative Law Judges (August 2010) |accessdate=2010-11-23|website= |publisher= SSA}}</ref>\n\nThe fee that a representative can charge for SSDI representation is set by law. Currently, under the SSA's fee agreement approval process, it is 25 percent of the retroactive dollar amount awarded, not to exceed $6,000. Some representatives may charge fees for costs related to the claim, such as photocopy and medical record collection expenses. If an SSDI applicant is approved quickly and does not receive a retroactive award, the SSA must review and approve the fee a representative will charge the individual. Disability representatives do not charge a fee if they are unsuccessful in obtaining a claimant's disability benefit.\n\nRepresentatives may decline to represent you if, after reviewing your situation, they do not believe you are likely to meet the requirements for SSDI.  Most representatives will provide this screening at no cost to you. Typical reasons individuals do not meet the requirements are: their disability is not severe enough or the applicant does not have a sufficient work history (and did not pay enough into FICA - the [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act]]).\n\n==Wait time for applications==\nThe amount of time it takes for an application to be approved or denied varies, depending on the level of the process at which the award is made. In 2009, there were 2,816,244 applications for SSDI.<ref name=\"performance section\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/STATS/dibStat.html | title=Disabled-worker stats |author=SSA |date=March 31, 2010 |accessdate=2010-04-14 }}</ref> As of March 31, 2007, the number of pending applications (or \"backlog\") was 1,463,153.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://waysandmeans.house.gov/hearings.asp?formmode=view&id=5438 |title=Testimony Before the Subcommittee on Social Security of the House Committee on Ways and Means |author=Sylvester J.

In the case of persons who have a diagnosed mental impairment which interferes with their ability to manage their own finances, the Social Security Administration may require that the person assign someone to be their [[representative payee]]. This person will receive the benefits on behalf of the disabled individual, and disburse them directly to payers such as landlords, or to the disabled person, while providing money management assistance (help with purchasing items, limiting spending money, etc.). The representative payee often does not charge a fee for this service, especially if it's a friend or relative. Social service agencies who are assigned as payee are NOT prohibited from charging a fee, although the maximum fee is set by Social Security. The fee is the same for ALL recipients, except it can be larger for those with severe substance abuse problems (Social Security determines when a higher fee can be charged, not the representative payee.) Some states and counties have representative payee agencies (also called substitute payee programs) which receive the benefits on behalf of the disabled person's social worker, and disburse the benefits per the social worker's instructions. A payee can be very helpful in the instance of homeless individuals who need assistance paying down debts (like utility bills) and saving for housing.\n\n==Differences from long-term disability insurance==\n{{Cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=May 2009}}\n{{Main|Disability insurance}}\n\n*Social Security provides a regular monthly payment that supplements any current disability benefits already received. It also provides annual cost of living increases. A portion of these benefits may be tax free.\n*Regardless of a person's age, after receiving SSDI benefits for 24 months, they are eligible for [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], including Part A (hospital benefits), Part B (medical benefits), and Part D (drug benefits). The date of Medicare eligibility is measured from the date of eligibility for SSDI (generally 6 months after the start of disability), not the date when the first SSDI payment was received.\n*If a person receives Social Security disability benefits, any [[Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985|COBRA]] benefits may also be extended from 18 to 29 months.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/cobraemployee.pdf | title=An Employee's Guide to Health Benefits Under COBRA |author=U.S. Department of Labor |date=November 2012 |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}</ref>\n*Social Security disability entitlement \"freezes\" Social Security earnings records during a person's period of disability so that reduced earnings during a period of disability will not have an adverse effect on retirement benefits. The resulting benefits computation may raise, but will not lower, future Social Security retirement benefits.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Disability Freeze|url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/dibfreeze.html|website=Social Security Administration|accessdate=23 July 2017}}</ref>\n*A person receiving Social Security Disability Insurance may have a dependent (child, adopted child, or, in some cases, a stepchild or grandchild) eligible for Social Security benefits.  This child must be under age 18 or under age 19 if in elementary or secondary school full-time.\n*A person receiving Social Security Disability Insurance may have a spouse eligible for Social Security benefits. The spouse, if not personally receiving SSDI because of his or her own disabling condition, must be 62 or older or caring for a child of the wage earner who is younger than age 16 or disabled.\n*Benefits can be paid on the record of a disabled, retired or deceased parent to an unmarried child of any age if the child became disabled before the age of 22.\n*Social Security will provide a person opportunities to return to work while still paying them disability benefits.\n*Since 1984 a portion of social security benefits are taxable, usually levied when a person has another source of income often from a separate pension/disability fund or from a spouse. State income tax laws generally exclude all social security benefits from taxable income.  If social security disability and other public benefits provide more than 1/2 of an adult's cost of living, that person is not considered a dependent for establishing head of household filing status by a caregiver, although in practice, many taxpayers claim disability benefit recipient relatives. Private disability insurance income is taxable if the original premiums for the benefit were paid by the employer; if they were paid by the individual, they are not taxable. If both paid the premiums, they are taxable in the same proportion. Five states (California, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Hawaii) have mandatory state disability programs, but the structure of the programs vary widely. Tax treatment of California's program is especially complex, as California's program pre-dates the Social Security Act, resulting in numerous tax-law special rules.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''[http://ssa.gov/disability/disability_starter_kits.htm Social Security Disability Starter Kit]''\n*''[https://ssabest.benefits.gov B.E.S.T The Benefit Eligibility Screening Tool]''\n*''[https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v66n3/v66n3p1.html Social Security and the \"D\" in OASDI: The History of a Federal Program Insuring Earners Against Disability]''\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ssa.gov/disability/ Disability Programs]; Social Security Administration\n* [http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pressoffice/pr/DSI-pr.htm Press release] on new Social Security Disability determination process\n* [http://www.ssa.gov/redbook 2011 Red Book \"A Summary Guide To Employment Support For Persons With Disabilities Under The Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income Programs\"]\n* [http://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/AdultListings.htm Social Security Administration Listing of Impairments]\n* [https://www.disabilityadvisor.com/social-security-disability/ Social Security Disability Research & Information ]\n* [https://www.socialsecuritybranch.com/resource/social-security-disability-benefits/ SSDI Research Guide ]\n\n{{ssusa}}\n{{Contemporary social welfare programs in the United States}}\n\n[[Category:Social security in the United States]]\n[[Category:Disability law in the United States]]\n[[Category:Federal assistance in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Distinguish|Supplemental Security Income}}\n{{Redirect|SSDI|the death index|Social Security Death Index}}\n\n{{Disability}}\n'''Social Security Disability Insurance''' ('''SSD''' or '''SSDI''') is a [[payroll tax]]-funded [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|federal insurance]] program of the [[United States government]].  It is managed by the [[Social Security Administration]] and designed to provide [[income supplement]]s to people who are physically restricted in their ability to be [[employed]] because of a notable [[disability]] (usually [[physical disability|physical]]). SSD can be supplied on either a temporary or permanent basis, usually directly correlated to whether the person's disability is temporary or permanent.\n\nPeople frequently confuse Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and [[Supplemental Security Income]] (SSI). Unlike SSI, SSDI does not depend on the income of the disabled individual receiving it. A legitimately disabled person (a finding based on legal and medical justification) of any income level can receive SSD. ('Disability' under SSDI is measured by a different standard than under the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]].) Most SSI recipients are below an administratively mandated income threshold, and these individuals must stay below that threshold to continue receiving SSI, unlike with SSD.\n\nInformal names for SSDI include '''Disability Insurance Benefits''' ('''DIB''') and '''Title II benefits'''. These names come from the chapter title of the governing section of the [[Social Security Act]], which came into law in August 1935. In July 1956, after two decades bouncing around Congress, the Social Security Disability Insurance program was put into effect.\n\n==Usage==\nAt the end of 2011, there were 10.6 million Americans collecting SSDI, up from 7.2 million in 2002.<ref>{{cite news|last=Paletta|first=Damian, and Dionne Searcey|title=Jobless Tap Disability Fund|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204296804577121392750460030|accessdate=16 September 2012|newspaper=Wall street Journal|date=28 December 2011}}</ref> The share of the U.S. population receiving SSDI benefits has risen rapidly over the past two decades, from 2.2 percent of adults age 25 to 64 in 1985 to 4.1 percent in 2005.<ref name=Autor2012 /> According to [[David Autor]] and [[Mark Duggan (economist)|Mark Duggan]], aging and changes to the overall health of the U.S. population have had a small effect at most on SSDI usage.<ref name=Autor2012>{{cite journal |last=Autor |first=David |first2=Mark |last2=Duggan |title=The Growth in the Social Security Disability Rolls: A Fiscal Crisis Unfolding |journal=[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |year=2006 |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=71\u201396 |doi=10.1257/jep.20.3.71 |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w12436.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIn a 2006 analysis, Autor and Duggan state that the most significant factor in the growth of SSDI usage has been the loosening of the screening process that took place in 1984 following the signing of [[Social Security Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984|an SSDI reform act]] into law; this directed the [[Social Security Administration]] to relax screening of mental illness, place more weight on applicants' reported pain and discomfort, consider multiple non-severe ailments to be disabling, and give more credence to medical evidence provided by the applicant's doctor. These changes had the effect of increasing the number of new SSDI awards and shifting their composition towards claimants with low-mortality disorders such as [[mental illness]] and [[back pain]].\n\nAccording to Autor and Duggan, a second factor in increased SSDI usage was the rising value of SSDI benefits relative to what recipients would have earned from employment. According to this report, a low-income older male SSDI recipient in 1984 would have received from benefits about 68% of the income he would have earned by working; by 2004, due to increasing [[income inequality in the United States|income inequality]], the same man would have received from SSDI benefits 86% of what he would have earned through employment.<ref name=Autor2012 />\n\nAutor and Duggan argue that because the definition of disability adopted in 1984 is quite broad, the SSDI program often functions in practice as an insurance program for unemployable people.<ref name=Autor2012/> Other researchers, however, do not agree with Autor and Duggan's explanation for the increase in Americans getting social security disability.  The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has found demographic factors such as population growth, aging of the baby boom generation, growth in women's labor force participation, and the increase in Social Security's full retirement age from 65 to 66 to be the primary factors in higher rates of SSDI program usage.<ref>https://www.cbpp.org/research/social-security/chart-book-social-security-disability-insurance#Section_two</ref>\n\nIn December 2014, the SSDI program insured approximately 10.9 million beneficiaries including disabled workers and their spouses and children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/issuepapers/ip2015-01.html|title=Social Security Disability Insurance at Age 60: Does It Still Reflect Congress' Original Intent?|last=Policy|first=U.S. Social Security Administration, Office of Retirement and Disability|website=www.ssa.gov|access-date=2016-04-27}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2019, the Social Security Trustees reported that under current law, \"the DI Trust Fund reserves [will] become depleted in 2052 and the OASI Trust Fund reserves [will] become depleted in 2034\".<ref name=\"The 2013 Long-Term Projections for Social Security:\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2019/tr2019.pdf|title=THE 2019 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE FEDERAL OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE AND FEDERAL DISABILITY INSURANCE TRUST FUNDS|date=25 April 2019|website=Social Security Administration}}</ref>\n\n=== Treating physician rule ===\nThe usage has been affected by the \"treating physician rule\" which gives \"controlling weight\" to determinations of the treating physicians.<ref name=TreatingPhysician>(2013).

Prior to the codified rule, federal courts had imposed a similar rule through a [[common law]], but it was inconsistent.<ref name=TreatingPhysician/>\n\nOn January 18, 2017, the security administration published final rules titled \"Revisions to Rules Regarding the Evaluation of Medical Evidence\" regarding the \"treating physician rule\".<ref>revisions-rules.html</ref>  These new rules regarding the assessment of medical opinions in a social security disability case apply to cases filed after March 27, 2017. While these new rules expand the definition of what social security considers to be an \"acceptable medical source\" for disability claim medical opinions to include nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and others, they also have efffectively abolished the \"treating physician rule\" by eliminating the requirement that a treating physician opinion be granted \"controlling weight\".<ref>https://nosscr.org/final-rules</ref>\n\n== Payment amount ==\nThe amount that each recipient receives monthly is based upon an average of past earnings. The calculation is based on the average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) which is used to calculate the primary insurance amount (PIA). In 2017, the average monthly disability payment was $1171, and the maximum monthly benefit was $2,687.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bauer|first1=Brandy|title=SSI vs. SSDI: What Are These Benefits and How Do They Differ?|url=https://www.ncoa.org/blog/ssi-vs-ssdi-what-are-these-benefits-how-they-differ/|website=National Council on Aging|accessdate=23 July 2017|date=6 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Qualification==\nAccording to the Social Security Administration (SSA)\n*they have a physical or mental condition that prevents them from engaging in any \"substantial gainful activity\" (\"SGA\"), and\n*the condition is expected to last at least 12 months or result in death, and\n*they are under the age of 65, and\n*generally, they have accumulated 20 social security credits in the last 10 years prior to the onset of disability (normally four credits per full or partial year); one additional credit is required for every year by which the worker's age exceeds 42.<ref>[http://ssa-custhelp.ssa.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/342 Social Security Administration]</ref><ref>{{cite book |author= [[Barbara C.

The parent(s) experience no loss of benefits.\n\nMedical evidence is signs, symptoms and laboratory findings and is required to document the claim.  Symptoms, such as pain, are considered but must be reasonably expected to come from a medically determinable impairment which the claimant is diagnosed to have. The decision is based on a sequential evaluation of medical evidence. The sequence for adults is:\n:1. Is the claimant performing a [[substantial gainful activity]]?  If yes, deny.  If no, continue to next sequence.\n:2. Is the claimant's impairment severe?  If no, deny.  If yes, continue to next sequence.\n:3. Does the impairment meet or equal the severity of impairments in the Listing of Impairments?<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/AdultListings.htm |title=  Listing of Impairments - Adult Listings |accessdate=2008-02-07 |publisher= [[Social Security Administration]]}}</ref> If yes, allow the claim.  If no, continue to next sequence.\n:4. Is the claimant able to perform past work?  If yes, deny.  If no continue to next sequence.\n:5. Is the claimant able to perform any work in the economy?  If yes, deny.  If no allow the claim.\n\nMedical evidence that demonstrates the applicant's inability to work is required. The DDS or ALJ may also require the applicant to visit a third-party physician for medical documentation, often to supplement the evidence treating sources do not supply. The applicant may meet a SSA medical listing for their condition. If their condition does not meet the requirements of a listing, their residual functional capacity is considered, along with their age, past relevant work, and education, in determining their ability to perform either their past work, or other work generally available in the national economy.\n\nDetermination of a residual functional capacity\u2014made in the fourth step in the sequential evaluation process\u2014often constitutes the bulk of the SSDI application and appeal process.  A residual functional capacity is assessed in accordance with Title 20 of the [[Code of Federal Regulations]], part 404, section 1545<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2006/aprqtr/20cfr404.1545.htm|title= 20 CFR \u00a7 404.1545, Your Residual Functional Capacity |accessdate=2008-12-19|publisher=[[Social Security Administration]]}}</ref> by a [[Disability Determination Services|disability determination service]] (DDS) or, on appeal, by an [[administrative law judge]] (ALJ), and is generally based upon the opinions of treating and examining physicians, if available.\n\nResidual functional capacity (RFC) is classified according to the five exertional levels of work defined in the [[Dictionary of Occupational Titles]], which are: Sedentary, Light, Medium, Heavy, and Very Heavy.  If the residual functional capacity of an individual equals the previous work performed, the claim is denied on the basis that the individual can return to former work.  If the residual functional capacity is less than former work then the RFC is applied against a vocational grid that considers the individual's age, education and transferability of formerly learned and used skills.  The vocational grid directs an allowance or denial of benefits.\n\n== Legal representation ==\nApplicants may hire a lawyer or non-attorney representative to help them apply or appeal. There are two primary types of organizations: companies with trained specialists experienced in handling SSDI applications and appeals in some or any local community across the country and law firms which specialize in disability-related cases.\n\nMost SSDI applicants\u2014about 90 percent according to the SSA\u2014have a disability representative for their appeal. An August 2010 report by the Office of Inspector General for the Social Security Administration indicated that many people submitting an initial disability application for SSDI might benefit from using a third-party disability representative when they first apply for benefits. It indicated that having a disability representative earlier in the process significantly improves the chances of those with four major types of disabilities getting approved for SSDI.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ssa.gov/oig/ADOBEPDF/A-07-09-19083.pdf |title=Office of the Inspector General \u2013 Social Security Administration: Disability Impairments on Cases Most Frequently Denied by Disability Determination Services and Subsequently Allowed by Administrative Law Judges (August 2010) |accessdate=2010-11-23|website= |publisher= SSA}}</ref>\n\nThe fee that a representative can charge for SSDI representation is set by law. Currently, under the SSA's fee agreement approval process, it is 25 percent of the retroactive dollar amount awarded, not to exceed $6,000. Some representatives may charge fees for costs related to the claim, such as photocopy and medical record collection expenses. If an SSDI applicant is approved quickly and does not receive a retroactive award, the SSA must review and approve the fee a representative will charge the individual. Disability representatives do not charge a fee if they are unsuccessful in obtaining a claimant's disability benefit.\n\nRepresentatives may decline to represent you if, after reviewing your situation, they do not believe you are likely to meet the requirements for SSDI.  Most representatives will provide this screening at no cost to you. Typical reasons individuals do not meet the requirements are: their disability is not severe enough or the applicant does not have a sufficient work history (and did not pay enough into FICA - the [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act]]).\n\n==Wait time for applications==\nThe amount of time it takes for an application to be approved or denied varies, depending on the level of the process at which the award is made. In 2009, there were 2,816,244 applications for SSDI.<ref name=\"performance section\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/STATS/dibStat.html | title=Disabled-worker stats |author=SSA |date=March 31, 2010 |accessdate=2010-04-14 }}</ref> As of March 31, 2007, the number of pending applications (or \"backlog\") was 1,463,153.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://waysandmeans.house.gov/hearings.asp?formmode=view&id=5438 |title=Testimony Before the Subcommittee on Social Security of the House Committee on Ways and Means |author=Sylvester J.

In the case of persons who have a diagnosed mental impairment which interferes with their ability to manage their own finances, the Social Security Administration may require that the person assign someone to be their [[representative payee]]. This person will receive the benefits on behalf of the disabled individual, and disburse them directly to payers such as landlords, or to the disabled person, while providing money management assistance (help with purchasing items, limiting spending money, etc.). The representative payee often does not charge a fee for this service, especially if it's a friend or relative. Social service agencies who are assigned as payee are NOT prohibited from charging a fee, although the maximum fee is set by Social Security. The fee is the same for ALL recipients, except it can be larger for those with severe substance abuse problems (Social Security determines when a higher fee can be charged, not the representative payee.) Some states and counties have representative payee agencies (also called substitute payee programs) which receive the benefits on behalf of the disabled person's social worker, and disburse the benefits per the social worker's instructions. A payee can be very helpful in the instance of homeless individuals who need assistance paying down debts (like utility bills) and saving for housing.\n\n==Differences from long-term disability insurance==\n{{Cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=May 2009}}\n{{Main|Disability insurance}}\n\n*Social Security provides a regular monthly payment that supplements any current disability benefits already received. It also provides annual cost of living increases. A portion of these benefits may be tax free.\n*Regardless of a person's age, after receiving SSDI benefits for 24 months, they are eligible for [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], including Part A (hospital benefits), Part B (medical benefits), and Part D (drug benefits). The date of Medicare eligibility is measured from the date of eligibility for SSDI (generally 6 months after the start of disability), not the date when the first SSDI payment was received.\n*If a person receives Social Security disability benefits, any [[Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985|COBRA]] benefits may also be extended from 18 to 29 months.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/cobraemployee.pdf | title=An Employee's Guide to Health Benefits Under COBRA |author=U.S. Department of Labor |date=November 2012 |accessdate=2013-11-20 }}</ref>\n*Social Security disability entitlement \"freezes\" Social Security earnings records during a person's period of disability so that reduced earnings during a period of disability will not have an adverse effect on retirement benefits. The resulting benefits computation may raise, but will not lower, future Social Security retirement benefits.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Disability Freeze|url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/dibfreeze.html|website=Social Security Administration|accessdate=23 July 2017}}</ref>\n*A person receiving Social Security Disability Insurance may have a dependent (child, adopted child, or, in some cases, a stepchild or grandchild) eligible for Social Security benefits.  This child must be under age 18 or under age 19 if in elementary or secondary school full-time.\n*A person receiving Social Security Disability Insurance may have a spouse eligible for Social Security benefits. The spouse, if not personally receiving SSDI because of his or her own disabling condition, must be 62 or older or caring for a child of the wage earner who is younger than age 16 or disabled.\n*Benefits can be paid on the record of a disabled, retired or deceased parent to an unmarried child of any age if the child became disabled before the age of 22.\n*Social Security will provide a person opportunities to return to work while still paying them disability benefits.\n*Since 1984 a portion of social security benefits are taxable, usually levied when a person has another source of income often from a separate pension/disability fund or from a spouse. State income tax laws generally exclude all social security benefits from taxable income.  If social security disability and other public benefits provide more than 1/2 of an adult's cost of living, that person is not considered a dependent for establishing head of household filing status by a caregiver, although in practice, many taxpayers claim disability benefit recipient relatives. Private disability insurance income is taxable if the original premiums for the benefit were paid by the employer; if they were paid by the individual, they are not taxable. If both paid the premiums, they are taxable in the same proportion. Five states (California, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Hawaii) have mandatory state disability programs, but the structure of the programs vary widely. Tax treatment of California's program is especially complex, as California's program pre-dates the Social Security Act, resulting in numerous tax-law special rules.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''[http://ssa.gov/disability/disability_starter_kits.htm Social Security Disability Starter Kit]''\n*''[https://ssabest.benefits.gov B.E.S.T The Benefit Eligibility Screening Tool]''\n*''[https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v66n3/v66n3p1.html Social Security and the \"D\" in OASDI: The History of a Federal Program Insuring Earners Against Disability]''\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ssa.gov/disability/ Disability Programs]; Social Security Administration\n* [http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pressoffice/pr/DSI-pr.htm Press release] on new Social Security Disability determination process\n* [http://www.ssa.gov/redbook 2011 Red Book \"A Summary Guide To Employment Support For Persons With Disabilities Under The Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income Programs\"]\n* [http://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/AdultListings.htm Social Security Administration Listing of Impairments]\n* [https://www.disabilityadvisor.com/social-security-disability/ Social Security Disability Research & Information ]\n* [https://www.socialsecuritybranch.com/resource/social-security-disability-benefits/ SSDI Research Guide ]\n\n{{ssusa}}\n{{Contemporary social welfare programs in the United States}}\n\n[[Category:Social security in the United States]]\n[[Category:Disability law in the United States]]\n[[Category:Federal assistance in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Disability_Insurance"}

However, he got his start painting scenery as part of the backstage crew during the silent movie era. By 1911, he was active in films as an actor, writer and director. He freelanced and worked for many of the movie studios, building a solid reputation for his work both on and off screen.\n\nHurst is best remembered for two roles: as the [[Yankee]] deserter who trespasses at Tara and is shot by Scarlett in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939); and his memorable characterization of the drunken and sadistic vigilante Smith in ''[[The Ox Bow Incident]]'' (1943).\n\nHowever, he was most proud of his role as a crotchety, old rancher who refuses water to a Quaker family in the movie ''[[Angel and the Badman]]'', until [[John Wayne]]'s character convinces him to share the water.

However, he got his start painting scenery as part of the backstage crew during the silent movie era. By 1911, he was active in films as an actor, writer and director. He freelanced and worked for many of the movie studios, building a solid reputation for his work both on and off screen.\n\nHurst is best remembered for two roles: as the [[Yankee]] deserter who trespasses at Tara and is shot by Scarlett in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939); and his memorable characterization of the drunken and sadistic vigilante Smith in ''[[The Ox Bow Incident]]'' (1943).\n\nHowever, he was most proud of his role as a crotchety, old rancher who refuses water to a Quaker family in the movie ''[[Angel and the Badman]]'', until [[John Wayne]]'s character convinces him to share the water. It was after this latter role that [[Republic Pictures]] signed him as the comic sidekick in [[Monte Hale]]'s Western series. His last film was [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Sun Shines Bright]]''.\n\n==Death==\nHurst was diagnosed with terminal [[cancer]] in late 1952, and committed [[suicide]] in February 1953.

The central government may create (or abolish) [[administrative division]]s (sub-national units).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-is-a-unitary-state.html |title=What is a Unitary State? |website=WorldAtlas |access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref> Such units exercise only the powers that the central government chooses to delegate. Although [[Power (social and political)|political power]] may be delegated through [[devolution]] to regional or [[local government]]s by [[statute]], the central government may abrogate the acts of [[Devolution|devolved governments]] or curtail (or expand) their powers. A large majority of the world's states (166 of the 193 [[Member states of the United Nations|UN member states]]) have a unitary system of government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/democracy/index.html |title=Democracy |date=2015-11-20 |website=www.un.org |access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\n\nUnitary states stand in contrast with [[federation]]s, also known as ''federal states''. In federations, the provincial governments share powers with the central government as equal actors through a written [[constitution]], to which the consent of both is required to make amendments. This means that the sub-national units have a right of existence and powers that cannot be unilaterally changed by the central government.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ghai |first=Yash |last2=Regan |first2=Anthony J. |date=September 2006 |title=Unitary state, devolution, autonomy, secession: State building and nation building in Bougainville, Papua New Guinea |journal=The Round Table |volume=95 |issue=386 |pages=589\u2013608 |doi=10.1080/00358530600931178 |issn=0035-8533|url=https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar//handle/123456789/21028 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] is an example of a unitary state. [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] have a degree of autonomous devolved power, but such power is delegated by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], which may enact laws unilaterally altering or abolishing devolution ([[Devolved English parliament|England does not have any devolved power]]). Similarly in the [[Spain|Kingdom of Spain]], the devolved powers are delegated through the central government.<ref>Devolution within a unitary state, like federalism may be symmetrical, with all sub-national units having the same powers and status, or asymmetric, with sub-national units varying in their powers and status.</ref> Many unitary states have no areas possessing a degree of autonomy.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/unitary-system |title=unitary system {{!}} government |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=2017-08-11}}</ref> In such countries, sub-national regions cannot decide their own laws. Examples are [[Romania]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Norway]].<ref>[[Svalbard]] has even less autonomy than the mainland. It is directly controlled by the government and has no local rule.</ref>\n[[File:The pathway of regional integration or separation.png|thumb|upright=2.7|The pathway of regional integration or separation]]\n[[File:Territorial organization of European countries.svg|thumb|Territorial organization of some European countries.

state''' is a [[State (polity)|state]] governed as a single power in which the [[central government]] is ultimately supreme. The central government may create (or abolish) [[administrative division]]s (sub-national units).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-is-a-unitary-state.html |title=What is a Unitary State? |website=WorldAtlas |access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref> Such units exercise only the powers that the central government chooses to delegate. Although [[Power (social and political)|political power]] may be delegated through [[devolution]] to regional or [[local government]]s by [[statute]], the central government may abrogate the acts of [[Devolution|devolved governments]] or curtail (or expand) their powers. A large majority of the world's states (166 of the 193 [[Member states of the United Nations|UN member states]]) have a unitary system of government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/democracy/index.html |title=Democracy |date=2015-11-20 |website=www.un.org |access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>\n\nUnitary states stand in contrast with [[federation]]s, also known as ''federal states''. In federations, the provincial governments share powers with the central government as equal actors through a written [[constitution]], to which the consent of both is required to make amendments. This means that the sub-national units have a right of existence and powers that cannot be unilaterally changed by the central government.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ghai |first=Yash |last2=Regan |first2=Anthony J. |date=September 2006 |title=Unitary state, devolution, autonomy, secession: State building and nation building in Bougainville, Papua New Guinea |journal=The Round Table |volume=95 |issue=386 |pages=589\u2013608 |doi=10.1080/00358530600931178 |issn=0035-8533|url=https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar//handle/123456789/21028 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] is an example of a unitary state. [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] have a degree of autonomous devolved power, but such power is delegated by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], which may enact laws unilaterally altering or abolishing devolution ([[Devolved English parliament|England does not have any devolved power]]). Similarly in the [[Spain|Kingdom of Spain]], the devolved powers are delegated through the central government.<ref>Devolution within a unitary state, like federalism may be symmetrical, with all sub-national units having the same powers and status, or asymmetric, with sub-national units varying in their powers and status.</ref> Many unitary states have no areas possessing a degree of autonomy.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/unitary-system |title=unitary system {{!}} government |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=2017-08-11}}</ref> In such countries, sub-national regions cannot decide their own laws.

The company is best known for its line of interchangeable-barrel, single-shot pistols and rifles. Thompson/Center also manufactures [[muzzle-loading]] rifles and is credited with creating the resurgence of their use in the 1970s.\n\n==History==\nIn the 1960s, Warren Center developed an unusual break-action, single-shot pistol in his basement workshop that later became known as the Contender. Meanwhile, the K.W. Thompson Tool Company had been searching for a product to manufacture year-round. In 1965, Warren Center joined the K.W. Thompson Tool Company, and together, they announced Warren Center's Contender pistol in 1967.

Hence, barrels with iron or telescopic sights, and even the hinge pin, are all simply gun parts, with no serial numbers, making the choice of changing cartridges from a multitude of rimfire, centerfire rifle and pistol cartridges, and even shotgun shells, very simple.\n\nIt is possible to fit a shoulder stock on a pistol frame in place of a pistol grip, and, when combined with a 16\" or longer barrel (see \"Thompson Center Arms and the Supreme Court\" below), a Contender may be legally converted from a pistol to a rifle or reversed. Although it is technically possible to fit a pistol grip on an original Contender rifle frame, and use a pistol barrel to convert it from being a rifle to a pistol, this is not legal in the USA, being an illegal creation of a pistol from a rifle. In order to be able to go back and forth, the receiver must have been originally sold as a pistol, per [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] rules.\n\n====California Legalities====\n\nSee [[Gun laws in California]]\n*Possession of a Thompson Center Arms .45/.410 pistol barrel is illegal in California, for both dealers and individuals, and such a barrel may not legally be shipped into the state, or even taken into California for a hunting trip, by reason of it being classified as a short barreled shotgun (SBSG) when used with a Contender receiver.<ref>{{cite web |title=California Dangerous Weapons Control Law ARTICLE 2.

Hence, barrels with iron or telescopic sights, and even the hinge pin, are all simply gun parts, with no serial numbers, making the choice of changing cartridges from a multitude of rimfire, centerfire rifle and pistol cartridges, and even shotgun shells, very simple.\n\nIt is possible to fit a shoulder stock on a pistol frame in place of a pistol grip, and, when combined with a 16\" or longer barrel (see \"Thompson Center Arms and the Supreme Court\" below), a Contender may be legally converted from a pistol to a rifle or reversed. Although it is technically possible to fit a pistol grip on an original Contender rifle frame, and use a pistol barrel to convert it from being a rifle to a pistol, this is not legal in the USA, being an illegal creation of a pistol from a rifle. In order to be able to go back and forth, the receiver must have been originally sold as a pistol, per [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] rules.\n\n====California Legalities====\n\nSee [[Gun laws in California]]\n*Possession of a Thompson Center Arms .45/.410 pistol barrel is illegal in California, for both dealers and individuals, and such a barrel may not legally be shipped into the state, or even taken into California for a hunting trip, by reason of it being classified as a short barreled shotgun (SBSG) when used with a Contender receiver.<ref>{{cite web |title=California Dangerous Weapons Control Law ARTICLE 2.

Some of the better-known models are the Renegade, the [[Hawken rifle|Hawken]], the Big Boar, and the White Mountain.\n\nThe traditional Thompson Center muzzleloaders are largely responsible for the resurgence of black powder hunting that began in the U.S. in 1970 when Warren Center designed the firm's Hawken-styled rifle. Thompson Center's reintroduced Hawken-styled rifle with solid brass hardware and an American walnut stock, styled in large part on \"plains rifles\" made by Hawken in the 1800s, has become one of the most-copied firearms designs in history.<ref>{{cite journal | last =Towsley | first = Bryce| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Mighty Hawken| journal = Hunting Magazine| volume = 15| issue = 6| pages = | publisher =Petersen | year = 2003| url = | doi = | id = | accessdate = }}</ref> Thompson Center produced these rifles in the following models and calibers:\n\n'''Cherokee:'''\nBarrel: 24\u201d octagonal, twist: 1:30 (32) & 1:48 (36 & 45),\nTrigger: double set,\nCaliber: 32, 36 & 45,\nStock: American Walnut,\nStatus: discontinued 1994,\nIgnition: percussion\n\n'''Seneca:'''\nBarrel: 27\u201d octagonal, twist: 1:30 (32) & 1:48 (36 & 45),\nTrigger: double set,\nCaliber: 32, 36 & 45,\nStock: American Walnut,\nStatus: discontinued 1987,\nIgnition: percussion\n\n'''Hawken:'''\nBarrel: 28\u201d octagonal, twist: 1:48, except 1:66 on 50 cal deep button rifling,\nTrigger: double set,\nCaliber: 45, 50 & 54,\nStock: American Walnut,\nStatus: 45 & 54 discontinued, 50 in production, many special editions,\nIgnition: flint & percussion\n\n'''Cougar:'''\nSpecial edition of the '''Hawken''', satin finish barrel, stainless furniture, highly figured wood\n\n'''Renegade:'''\nBarrel: 26\u201d octagonal, 1:38 (50), 1:48 (50 & 54), 1: 66 (50 deep button rifling), smoothbore (56),\nTrigger: double set,\nCaliber: 50, 54 & 56, \nStock: American Walnut,\nStatus: discontinued,\nIgnition: flintlock & percussion\n\n'''Big Boar:'''\nBarrel: 26\u201d octagonal, 1:48,\nTrigger: single,\nCaliber: 58,\nStock: American Walnut,\nStatus: discontinued,\nIgnition: percussion\n\n'''Encore 209x50''' \nA modern design muzzleloader that can interchange with centerfire barrels.

Both are lawful, and while they can easily be assembled into the blasting agent known as [[ANFO]], possession of both has never been held to imply (without other evidence) that a farmer was \"making\" explosives.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tcarms.com/ Thompson/Center Arms] corporate website\n*[http://bullberry.com Bullberry Barrel Works], specializing in Contender, G2, and Encore barrels\n*[http://guns.huntingpa.info/index.php/T/C_--_Thompson/Center Muzzleloader Museum Online], listing of some of T/C's muzzleloader guns with pictures and specifications.\n\n[[Category:Firearm manufacturers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Smith & Wesson]]\n", "name_user": "Gjs238", "label": "safe", "comment": "copy edit", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson/Center_Arms"}
