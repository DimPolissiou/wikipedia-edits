In the scientific literature on [[ecology]], the term is used more generally to indicate the time frame for any seasonal biological phenomena, including the dates of last appearance (e.g., the seasonal phenology of a species may be from April through September).\n\n[[File:Phenology.png|thumb|Phenological development of [[olive]] flowering, following [[BBCH-scale|BBCH standard scale]]. a-50, b-51, c-54, d-57, (<15% open flowers); e-61, (>50% open flowers); f-65, (>15% open flowers); g-67, (<15% open flowers); h-68 (Oteros et al., 2013)<ref name=\"Oteros et al., 2013\">Oteros, J., Garc\u00eda-Mozo, H., V\u00e1zquez, L., Mestre, A., Dom\u00ednguez-Vilches, E., Gal\u00e1n, C.

Many cultures have traditional phenological proverbs and sayings which indicate a time for action: \"When the sloe tree is white as a sheet, sow your barley whether it be dry or wet\" or attempt to forecast future climate: \"If oak's before ash, you're in for a splash. If ash before oak, you're in for a soak\". But the indications can be pretty unreliable, as an alternative version of the rhyme shows: \"If the oak is out before the [[Fraxinus excelsior|ash]], 'Twill be a summer of wet and splash; If the ash is out before the oak, 'Twill be a summer of fire and smoke.\" Theoretically, though, these are not mutually exclusive, as one forecasts immediate conditions and one forecasts future conditions.\n\nThe [[North American Bird Phenology Program]] at USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center (PWRC) is in possession of a collection of millions of bird arrival and departure date records for over 870 species across North America, dating between 1880 and 1970. This program, originally started by [[Wells W. Cooke]], involved over 3,000 observers including many notable naturalists of the time. The program ran for 90 years and came to a close in 1970 when other programs starting up at PWRC took precedence. The program was again started in 2009 to digitize the collection of records and now with the help of citizens worldwide, each record is being transcribed into a database which will be publicly accessible for use.\n\nThe English naturalists [[Gilbert White]] and [[William Markwick]] reported the seasonal events of more than 400 plant and animal species, Gilbert White in [[Selborne]], Hampshire and William Markwick in [[Battle, Sussex]] over a 25-year period between 1768 and 1793. The data, reported in White's ''[[Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]]''<ref name=white>White, G (1789) [[The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]]</ref> are reported as the earliest and latest dates for each event over 25 years; so annual changes cannot therefore be determined.\n\nIn Japan and China the time of blossoming of cherry and peach trees is associated with ancient festivals and some of these dates can be traced back to the eighth century. Such historical records may, in principle, be capable of providing estimates of climate at dates before instrumental records became available.

These took the form of dates of the first occurrence of events such as flowering, bud burst, emergence or flight of an insect. Generations of Marsham's family maintained consistent records of the same events or \"phenophases\" over unprecedentedly long periods of time, eventually ending with the death of Mary Marsham in 1958, so that trends can be observed and related to long-term climate records. The data show significant variation in dates which broadly correspond with warm and cold years. Between 1850 and 1950 a long-term trend of gradual climate warming is observable, and during this same period the Marsham record of oak-leafing dates tended to become earlier.<ref name=\"Sparks & Carey\">{{cite journal | last1 = Sparks | first1 = T.H. | last2 = Carey | first2 = P.D. | year = 1995 | title = The responses of species to climate over two centuries: an analysis of the Marsham phenological record, 1736-1947 | url = | journal = Journal of Ecology | volume = 83 | issue = 2 | pages = 321\u2013329 | doi = 10.2307/2261570 | jstor = 2261570 }}</ref>\n\nAfter 1960 the rate of warming accelerated, and this is mirrored by increasing earliness of oak leafing, recorded in the data collected by Jean Combes in Surrey.

Up to 600 observers submitted returns in some years, with numbers averaging a few hundred. During this period 11 main plant phenophases were consistently recorded over the 58 years from 1891\u20131948, and a further 14 phenophases were recorded for the 20 years between 1929 and 1948.

These methods complement the traditional phenological methods which recorded the first occurrences of individual species and phenophases.\n\nThe most successful of these approaches is based on tracking the temporal change of a Vegetation Index (like [[Normalized Difference Vegetation Index]](NDVI)). NDVI makes use of the vegetation's typical low reflection in the red (red energy is mostly absorbed by growing plants for Photosynthesis) and strong reflection in the Near [[Infrared]] (Infrared energy is mostly reflected by plants due to their cellular structure). Due to its robustness and simplicity, NDVI has become one of the most popular remote sensing based products. Typically, a vegetation index is constructed in such a way that the attenuated reflected sunlight energy (1% to 30% of incident sunlight) is amplified by ratio-ing red and NIR following this equation:\n: <math>\\mathrm{NDVI}={\\mathrm{NIR}-\\mathrm{red} \\over \\mathrm{NIR}+\\mathrm{red}}</math>\n\nThe evolution of the vegetation index through time, depicted by the graph above, exhibits a strong [[correlation]] with the typical green vegetation growth stages (emergence, vigor/growth, maturity, and harvest/senescence). These temporal curves are analyzed to extract useful parameters about the vegetation growing season (start of season, end of season, length of [[growing season]], etc.). Other growing season [[parameter]]s could potentially be extracted, and global maps of any of these growing season parameters could then be constructed and used in all sorts of [[climate change|climatic change]] studies.\n\nA noteworthy example of the use of [[remote sensing]] based phenology is the work of Ranga Myneni<ref>[http://cybele.bu.edu/people/rmyneni.html Welcome to the Climate and Vegetation Research Group, Boston University<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> from [[Boston University]].

This is mainly due to the limitation of current space-based remote sensing, especially the spatial resolution, and the nature of vegetation index.

For example, if a plant species blooms its flowers earlier than previous years, but the pollinators that feed on and pollinate this flower does not arrive or grow earlier as well, then a phenological mismatch has occurred. This results in the plant population declining as there are no pollinators to aid in their reproductive success<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gonsamo|first=Alemu|last2=Chen|first2=Jing M.|last3=Wu|first3=Chaoyang|date=2013-07-19|title=Citizen Science: linking the recent rapid advances of plant flowering in Canada with climate variability|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep02239|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1\u20135|doi=10.1038/srep02239|issn=2045-2322}}</ref>. Another example includes the interaction between plant species, where the presence of one specie aids in the pollination of another through attraction of pollinators. However, if these plant species develop at mismatched times, this interaction will be negatively affected and therefore the plant species that relies on the other will be harmed.  \n\nPhenological mismatches means the loss of many biological interactions and therefore [[Ecosystem function|ecosystem functions]] are also at risk of being negatively effects or lost all together. Phenological mismatches his will effect species and ecosystems [[Food web|food webs]], [[reproduction]] success, resource availability, population and community dynamics in future generations, and therefore evolutionary process and overall [[biodiversity]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Citizen science]]\n* [[Nature Detectives]]\n* [[Season creep]]\n* [[Growing degree-day]]\n* [[Biological life cycle]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/s00484-011-0442-5|pmid = 21713602|title = From \"Periodical Observations\" to \"Anthochronology\" and \"Phenology\" \u2013 the scientific debate between Adolphe Quetelet and Charles Morren on the origin of the word \"Phenology\"|journal = International Journal of Biometeorology|volume = 55|issue = 6|pages = 753\u2013761|year = 2011|last1 = Demar\u00e9e|first1 = Gaston R|last2 = Rutishauser|first2 = This|url = https://boris.unibe.ch/9252/8/484_2011_Article_442.pdf |ref=harv}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bpp/ North American Bird Phenology Program] Citizen science program to digitize bird phenology records\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110104054300/http://neoninc.org/budburst/ Project Budburst] Citizen Science for Plant Phenology in the USA\n* [http://www.usanpn.org/ USA National Phenology Network] Citizen science and research network observations on phenology in the USA\n* [http://www.outdoors.org/conservation/mountainwatch/index.cfm AMC's Mountain Watch] Citizen science and phenology monitoring in the Appalachian mountains\n* [http://www.pep725.eu/ Pan European Phenology Project PEP725] European open access database with plant phenology data sets for science, research and education\n* [http://www.naturescalendar.org.uk/ UK Nature's Calendar] UK Phenology network\n* [https://www.dwd.de/phaenologie DWD phenology website] Information on the plant phenological network operated by Germany's national meteorological service (DWD)\n* [http://www.biology.ie/ Nature's Calendar Ireland] Spring Watch & Autumn Watch\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040504141637/http://www.naturewatch.ca/english/ Naturewatch: A Canadian Phenology project]\n* [http://www.springalive.net/ Spring Alive Project] Phenological survey on birds for children\n* [http://www.mojpopek.org/ Moj Popek] Citizen Science for Plant Phenology in Slovenia\n* [http://www.obs-saisons.fr/ Observatoire des Saisons] French Phenology network\n* [http://video.wpt.org/video/1883119733/ Phenology] Video produced by [[Wisconsin Public Television]]\n* [http://www.phenowatch.at/ Austrian phenological network run by ZAMG]\n* [https://www.growapp.today/main.html the GrowApp] Citizen science program that follows trees\n\n[[Category:Periodic phenomena]]\n[[Category:Chronobiology]]\n[[Category:Ecology]]\n[[Category:Climatology]]\n[[Category:Branches of biology]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|Phrenology|Phonology}}\n\n'''Phenology''' is the study of periodic plant and animal life cycle events and how these are influenced by seasonal and interannual variations in climate, as well as habitat factors (such as elevation). \n\nExamples include the date of emergence of leaves and flowers, the first flight of butterflies, the first appearance of [[bird migration|migratory]] birds, the date of leaf colouring and fall in deciduous trees, the dates of egg-laying of birds and amphibia, or the timing of the developmental cycles of [[temperate]]-zone [[honey bee]] colonies.

Many cultures have traditional phenological proverbs and sayings which indicate a time for action: \"When the sloe tree is white as a sheet, sow your barley whether it be dry or wet\" or attempt to forecast future climate: \"If oak's before ash, you're in for a splash. If ash before oak, you're in for a soak\". But the indications can be pretty unreliable, as an alternative version of the rhyme shows: \"If the oak is out before the [[Fraxinus excelsior|ash]], 'Twill be a summer of wet and splash; If the ash is out before the oak, 'Twill be a summer of fire and smoke.\" Theoretically, though, these are not mutually exclusive, as one forecasts immediate conditions and one forecasts future conditions.\n\nThe [[North American Bird Phenology Program]] at USGS Patuxent Wildlife Research Center (PWRC) is in possession of a collection of millions of bird arrival and departure date records for over 870 species across North America, dating between 1880 and 1970. This program, originally started by [[Wells W. Cooke]], involved over 3,000 observers including many notable naturalists of the time. The program ran for 90 years and came to a close in 1970 when other programs starting up at PWRC took precedence. The program was again started in 2009 to digitize the collection of records and now with the help of citizens worldwide, each record is being transcribed into a database which will be publicly accessible for use.\n\nThe English naturalists [[Gilbert White]] and [[William Markwick]] reported the seasonal events of more than 400 plant and animal species, Gilbert White in [[Selborne]], Hampshire and William Markwick in [[Battle, Sussex]] over a 25-year period between 1768 and 1793. The data, reported in White's ''[[Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]]''<ref name=white>White, G (1789) [[The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]]</ref> are reported as the earliest and latest dates for each event over 25 years; so annual changes cannot therefore be determined.\n\nIn Japan and China the time of blossoming of cherry and peach trees is associated with ancient festivals and some of these dates can be traced back to the eighth century. Such historical records may, in principle, be capable of providing estimates of climate at dates before instrumental records became available.

These took the form of dates of the first occurrence of events such as flowering, bud burst, emergence or flight of an insect. Generations of Marsham's family maintained consistent records of the same events or \"phenophases\" over unprecedentedly long periods of time, eventually ending with the death of Mary Marsham in 1958, so that trends can be observed and related to long-term climate records. The data show significant variation in dates which broadly correspond with warm and cold years.

Up to 600 observers submitted returns in some years, with numbers averaging a few hundred. During this period 11 main plant phenophases were consistently recorded over the 58 years from 1891\u20131948, and a further 14 phenophases were recorded for the 20 years between 1929 and 1948.

These methods complement the traditional phenological methods which recorded the first occurrences of individual species and phenophases.\n\nThe most successful of these approaches is based on tracking the temporal change of a Vegetation Index (like [[Normalized Difference Vegetation Index]](NDVI)). NDVI makes use of the vegetation's typical low reflection in the red (red energy is mostly absorbed by growing plants for Photosynthesis) and strong reflection in the Near [[Infrared]] (Infrared energy is mostly reflected by plants due to their cellular structure). Due to its robustness and simplicity, NDVI has become one of the most popular remote sensing based products. Typically, a vegetation index is constructed in such a way that the attenuated reflected sunlight energy (1% to 30% of incident sunlight) is amplified by ratio-ing red and NIR following this equation:\n: <math>\\mathrm{NDVI}={\\mathrm{NIR}-\\mathrm{red} \\over \\mathrm{NIR}+\\mathrm{red}}</math>\n\n[[Image:MODIS NDVI Temporal Profile Conifer.jpg|thumb|400px|NDVI temporal profile for a typical patch of coniferous forest over a period of six years. This temporal profile depicts the growing season every year as well as changes in this profile from year to year due to climatic and other constraints.

These temporal curves are analyzed to extract useful parameters about the vegetation growing season (start of season, end of season, length of [[growing season]], etc.). Other growing season [[parameter]]s could potentially be extracted, and global maps of any of these growing season parameters could then be constructed and used in all sorts of [[climate change|climatic change]] studies.\n\nA noteworthy example of the use of [[remote sensing]] based phenology is the work of Ranga Myneni<ref>[http://cybele.bu.edu/people/rmyneni.html Welcome to the Climate and Vegetation Research Group, Boston University<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> from [[Boston University]].

Another example includes the interaction between plant species, where the presence of one specie aids in the pollination of another through attraction of pollinators.

He has played a significant role in the development of the \"Denver Sound\", music that mixes elements of [[country music|country]], [[Gothic rock|gothic]], [[Folk music|folk]] and [[gospel music|gospel]]. He is a current member of [[Slim Cessna's Auto Club]], Munly and the Lupercalians, and Denver Broncos UK (DBUK). He was the leader of Munly and the Lee Lewis Harlots from approximately 2000 to 2006. \n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood and upbringing ===\n\nMunly was born and raised [[Quebec, Canada]] in a \"stereotypical Catholic family\"<ref name=\"Munly on Vera\">{{cite news |last1=Forman |first1=Bill |title=Wulf at the door |url=https://m.csindy.com/coloradosprings/wulf-at-the-door/Content?oid=1974001 |accessdate=March 26, 2020 |work=Colorado Springs Indy |publisher=Colorado Springs Independent |date=December 23, 2010 |ref=Munly on Vera}}</ref> with two parents and two siblings \u2013 one brother<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\">{{cite news |last1=Solomon |first1=Jon |title=Munly talks Slim Cessna's Auto Club's new album and seeing Billy Bragg for the first time |url=https://www.westword.com/music/munly-talks-slim-cessnas-auto-clubs-new-album-and-seeing-billy-bragg-for-the-first-time-5719289 |accessdate=March 23, 2020 |work=Westword |date=December 27, 2012 |ref=Munly Acting Westword}}</ref> and one sister.<ref name=\"Munly ORH\">{{cite news |title=Munly Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://archive.org/details/OutsightRadioHoursInterviews2000-2010/KramerEddie.rm |accessdate=April 5, 2020 |work=Outsight Radio Hours |issue=Interview No. 252 |publisher=Archive.org |date=October 26, 2004 |ref=Munly ORH}}</ref><ref name=\"Coolstreams\">{{cite web |title=CoolStreams Internet Radio \u2013 Jay Munly |url=http://musicsojourn.com/AR/Alt/page/m/MunlyJay.htm |website=musicsojourn.com |accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nHe was a well-behaved child growing up, rarely getting into trouble.

The song \"Cooney vs. Munly\" on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002) was written as a tribute to him.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nOne of the first concerts that he ever attended was [[Billy Bragg]] opening for [[Echo and the Bunnymen]] at Denver's [[Rainbow Music Hall]], presumably around \"11 or 12 years old.\"<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" /> According to a music blog, the actual date of the concert was September 3, 1984, making Munly 14 years old at the time.<ref name=\"Munly Concert\">{{cite web |title=Echo and The Bunnymen @ Rainbow Music Hall, 1984-09-03 |url=http://thatsthethingaboutthat.blogspot.com/2018/07/echo-and-bunnymen-rainbow-music-hall.html |website=That's The Thing About That (Blogspot) |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=Munly Concert}}</ref>\n\nWhen he was older, presumably in his 20s, he moved to [[Boulder, Colorado]] before eventually moving to [[Denver]].<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> In a 2009 interview, he said that he identifies more with being an American from Denver than with being a Canadian from Quebec.<ref name=\"Crawdaddy\" />\n\n===Interest in ice hockey===\n\nTaking interest in [[ice hockey]] as a young man in Canada, Munly grew up a [[Montreal Canadiens]] fan.\n\nHe played hockey as a child in Canada and the U.S. before a related injury side-lined him. In a 2012 interview with [[Westword]], he says that his brother took him to the [[Bob Johnson (ice hockey, born 1931)|Bob Johnson]] ice hockey school to play.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\n===Interest in music===\n\nHis interest in music initially stemmed from boredom as he was recovering from an ice hockey injury. He also had some familial ties: his father and grandfather owned and played banjos. His father also made a [[dulcimer]] for his mother as a gift, although she did not play it.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nWhile recuperating from said injury, Munly taught himself how to play his father's 19th century-era [[banjo]], which was technically off-limits to handle.<ref name=\"Munly on Vera\" /> He would eventually teach himself to play the guitar as well.\n\n==Musical process==\n\n===Approach to songwriting===\n\nMunly is the chief songwriter for both his solo endeavors and side projects. It is a role that he is happy to take on by himself, believing that a band's success is dependent on playing to individual strengths rather than collaboration with members on each part of an album's creation.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" />\n\nHe says that he is \"selfish\" with his written material and serious about lyrical preservation.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\nHe expanded on his way of thinking in a 2019 interview with Sadwave, a Russian publication:\n\n{{quote|''\"From the very beginning, I understand where and why I'm writing a song. There is no complicated science. When you have been doing this for so many years, you bring the skill to automatism. I can start with a melody, but I can with a text \u2013 I always have a lot of words, I write a lot. I constantly find common themes in my songs, but I never had the feeling that I was working on a pattern. It would be immoral and unnatural, and I would not want to. I have characters who constantly come back, wander from song to song. But I try to change the angle, write on behalf of different people. On behalf of all sad people.\"''<ref name=\"Munly Sadwave\">{{cite news |last1=Kurkin |first1=Dmitry |title=Jay Manley [sic] (DBUK): 'I try to write on behalf of all sad people' |url=https://sadwave.com/2019/02/jay-munli/ |accessdate=April 5, 2020 |work=sad wave |date=February 8, 2019 |ref=Munly Sadwave}}</ref>}}\n\n===Musical themes and genres===\n\nHis music has ties to [[alt-country]] and [[Gothabilly|Gothic-Americana]]. Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\nOne topic that Munly deliberately does not write about is politics, since he \"hates\" music that veers into that kind of territory.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he admits that the stories and songs that he writes can be applied to real-world events in a way that coincidentally fits.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" />\n\n===Controversy===\n\nAs stated in a few interviews, people have found some of Munly's material controversial and politically incorrect. It is important to note that in most cases, the words and phrases used (as well as the views they represent) are that of the fictional characters that Munly creates, not of Munly himself.\n\nExamples:\n\n* ''\"Boys with tattoos can't be Jews\"'' \u2013 from \"Kidneys Running Dry\" on ''Blurry'' (1996)<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /><ref name=\"KRD Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Munly \u2013 Kidneys Running Dry |url=https://genius.com/Munly-kidneys-running-dry-lyrics?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=bd3ae05fe6c1e2a47c4f0713ffa5a16e71fce6fd-1586308658-0-AacccNM6Up3QUKAwcxWr7moI6buvh28pOpYPxYODrvwTY_F1arxPxbTRgSuWyl4Xdp0ySY_ZseZwWCStv8dumtz5AhmL5llOOnD9_3dv6-XTquwykYgduqCixdMk01PstYrSa8KQZi4SK3emYdNuLlbX4RFCHJbwQ1YRExOJjd6dkKD1_GHgcdfYYDe-vTJWI1uyX_0R8Q64ZevT3n-7A-7f2-ifsSZoF6J2JCq_RT2aMwKoWBxbHjarJrGdvNiZWwohYzH2ba2tN14wf2PwTXEzsdbFCgp-hDaOKuoeEYASB7ZBgYOJT_5LMn8GQ2PkKSfxVXNgggJO-I6ajZK3bMX27bSVAiYaqRheMbR_klyaHJvQPTQvRxAPyOR5CZ1c9A |website=Genius |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=KRD Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[a] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"My Darling Sambo\" \u2013 the first track title on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"JCS Amazon\">{{cite web |title=MUNLY, JAY \u2013 Jimmy Carter Syndrome |url=https://www.amazon.com/Jimmy-Carter-Syndrome-JAY-MUNLY/dp/B000BKWZOI |website=Amazon Music |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=JCS Amazon}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[b] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Paint your blackface/Yeah, won't you put me in your anteroom case/I'll be your n***er/On stage\"'' \u2013 from \"Censer from the Footlights\" on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"CFTF Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Jay Munly \u2013 Censer from the Footlights Lyrics |url=http://www.songlyrics.com/jay-munly/censer-from-the-footlights-lyrics/ |website=SongLyrics |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=CFTF Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[c] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[d] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[e] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[f] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Then we found ourselves a half-breed/To tell us our fortune today/He painted my hands a deep, dark red/Said 'now boy, you know that you gotta pay'\"'' \u2013 from \"Goose Walking Over My Grave\" on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"Munly Birds\">{{cite news |last1=Bradley |first1=Lisa M. |title=A Crack in Its Speak: Fantastic Birds in the Gothic Country Lyrics of Jay Munly |url=http://stonetelling.com/issue8-aug2012/bradley-speak.html |accessdate=April 6, 2020 |work=Stone Telling |issue=Issue No. 8 |date=August 2012 |ref=Munly Birds}}</ref><ref name=\"Goose Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Lyrics \u2013 Goose Walking Over My Grave |url=https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Munly-The-Lee-Lewis-Harlots/Goose-Walking-Over-My-Grave |website=Musixmatch |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=Goose Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[g] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"Cassius Castrato The She-Male of the Men's Prison\" \u2013 the fifth track title on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"LLH Album\">{{cite web |title=Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com/collections/munly/products/munly-the-lee-lewis-harlots |website=slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=LLH Album}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[h] ]]</sup>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Solo career===\n\nIn the 1990s, Munly started out his music career as a solo artist. He had toured with The Reejers before releasing his first album. He also shared a 7-inch vinyl album with [[Roger Manning]].<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" />\n\nHe released his debut solo album, ''Blurry'', in 1996 through Top Notch, an imprint of [[What Are Records?]]. ''Munly de Dar He'' and ''Galvanized Yankee'' were also released through Top Notch in 1997 and 1999, respectively. His fourth and final solo album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', was released through [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 2002. Each of these albums were re-mastered by Bob Ferbrache and re-released as limited editions through Smooch Records in 2006. Only 1,000 copies of each were printed.\n\nHe has worked with several musicians that are featured on his albums, such as John Ellison of The Reejers and Chris Mars of The Replacements.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he makes a point of not listing the exact musical contributions of each member in liner notes, preferring the simplicity of the 'Modern Library book' aesthetic.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nAlthough Munly is the primary vocalist and lyricist on each of his albums, he hesitates to call himself a \"singer-songwriter\":\n\n''{{quote|\"It's kind of rough being a solo artist.

In a 2012 interview with [[Westword]], he says that his brother took him to the [[Bob Johnson (ice hockey, born 1931)|Bob Johnson]] ice hockey school to play.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\n===Interest in music===\n\nHis interest in music initially stemmed from boredom as he was recovering from an ice hockey injury. He also had some familial ties: his father and grandfather owned and played banjos. His father also made a [[dulcimer]] for his mother as a gift, although she did not play it.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nWhile recuperating from said injury, Munly taught himself how to play his father's 19th century-era [[banjo]], which was technically off-limits to handle.<ref name=\"Munly on Vera\" /> He would eventually teach himself to play the guitar as well.\n\n==Musical process==\n\n===Approach to songwriting===\n\nMunly is the chief songwriter for both his solo endeavors and side projects. It is a role that he is happy to take on by himself, believing that a band's success is dependent on playing to individual strengths rather than collaboration with members on each part of an album's creation.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" />\n\nHe says that he is \"selfish\" with his written material and serious about lyrical preservation.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\nHe expanded on his way of thinking in a 2019 interview with Sadwave, a Russian publication:\n\n{{quote|''\"From the very beginning, I understand where and why I'm writing a song. There is no complicated science. When you have been doing this for so many years, you bring the skill to automatism. I can start with a melody, but I can with a text \u2013 I always have a lot of words, I write a lot. I constantly find common themes in my songs, but I never had the feeling that I was working on a pattern. It would be immoral and unnatural, and I would not want to. I have characters who constantly come back, wander from song to song. But I try to change the angle, write on behalf of different people. On behalf of all sad people.\"''<ref name=\"Munly Sadwave\">{{cite news |last1=Kurkin |first1=Dmitry |title=Jay Manley [sic] (DBUK): 'I try to write on behalf of all sad people' |url=https://sadwave.com/2019/02/jay-munli/ |accessdate=April 5, 2020 |work=sad wave |date=February 8, 2019 |ref=Munly Sadwave}}</ref>}}\n\n===Musical themes and genres===\n\nHis music has ties to [[alt-country]] and [[Gothabilly|Gothic-Americana]]. Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\nOne topic that Munly deliberately does not write about is politics, since he \"hates\" music that veers into that kind of territory.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he admits that the stories and songs that he writes can be applied to real-world events in a way that coincidentally fits.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" />\n\n===Controversy===\n\nAs stated in a few interviews, people have found some of Munly's material controversial and politically incorrect. It is important to note that in most cases, the words and phrases used (as well as the views they represent) are that of the fictional characters that Munly creates, not of Munly himself.\n\nExamples:\n\n* ''\"Boys with tattoos can't be Jews\"'' \u2013 from \"Kidneys Running Dry\" on ''Blurry'' (1996)<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /><ref name=\"KRD Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Munly \u2013 Kidneys Running Dry |url=https://genius.com/Munly-kidneys-running-dry-lyrics?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=bd3ae05fe6c1e2a47c4f0713ffa5a16e71fce6fd-1586308658-0-AacccNM6Up3QUKAwcxWr7moI6buvh28pOpYPxYODrvwTY_F1arxPxbTRgSuWyl4Xdp0ySY_ZseZwWCStv8dumtz5AhmL5llOOnD9_3dv6-XTquwykYgduqCixdMk01PstYrSa8KQZi4SK3emYdNuLlbX4RFCHJbwQ1YRExOJjd6dkKD1_GHgcdfYYDe-vTJWI1uyX_0R8Q64ZevT3n-7A-7f2-ifsSZoF6J2JCq_RT2aMwKoWBxbHjarJrGdvNiZWwohYzH2ba2tN14wf2PwTXEzsdbFCgp-hDaOKuoeEYASB7ZBgYOJT_5LMn8GQ2PkKSfxVXNgggJO-I6ajZK3bMX27bSVAiYaqRheMbR_klyaHJvQPTQvRxAPyOR5CZ1c9A |website=Genius |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=KRD Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[a] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"My Darling Sambo\" \u2013 the first track title on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"JCS Amazon\">{{cite web |title=MUNLY, JAY \u2013 Jimmy Carter Syndrome |url=https://www.amazon.com/Jimmy-Carter-Syndrome-JAY-MUNLY/dp/B000BKWZOI |website=Amazon Music |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=JCS Amazon}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[b] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Paint your blackface/Yeah, won't you put me in your anteroom case/I'll be your n***er/On stage\"'' \u2013 from \"Censer from the Footlights\" on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"CFTF Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Jay Munly \u2013 Censer from the Footlights Lyrics |url=http://www.songlyrics.com/jay-munly/censer-from-the-footlights-lyrics/ |website=SongLyrics |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=CFTF Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[c] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[d] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[e] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[f] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Then we found ourselves a half-breed/To tell us our fortune today/He painted my hands a deep, dark red/Said 'now boy, you know that you gotta pay'\"'' \u2013 from \"Goose Walking Over My Grave\" on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"Munly Birds\">{{cite news |last1=Bradley |first1=Lisa M. |title=A Crack in Its Speak: Fantastic Birds in the Gothic Country Lyrics of Jay Munly |url=http://stonetelling.com/issue8-aug2012/bradley-speak.html |accessdate=April 6, 2020 |work=Stone Telling |issue=Issue No. 8 |date=August 2012 |ref=Munly Birds}}</ref><ref name=\"Goose Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Lyrics \u2013 Goose Walking Over My Grave |url=https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Munly-The-Lee-Lewis-Harlots/Goose-Walking-Over-My-Grave |website=Musixmatch |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=Goose Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[g] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"Cassius Castrato The She-Male of the Men's Prison\" \u2013 the fifth track title on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"LLH Album\">{{cite web |title=Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com/collections/munly/products/munly-the-lee-lewis-harlots |website=slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=LLH Album}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[h] ]]</sup>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Solo career===\n\nIn the 1990s, Munly started out his music career as a solo artist.

''Munly de Dar He'' and ''Galvanized Yankee'' were also released through Top Notch in 1997 and 1999, respectively. His fourth and final solo album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', was released through [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 2002. Each of these albums were re-mastered by Bob Ferbrache and re-released as limited editions through Smooch Records in 2006. Only 1,000 copies of each were printed.\n\nHe has worked with several musicians that are featured on his albums, such as John Ellison of The Reejers and Chris Mars of The Replacements.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he makes a point of not listing the exact musical contributions of each member in liner notes, preferring the simplicity of the 'Modern Library book' aesthetic.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nAlthough Munly is the primary vocalist and lyricist on each of his albums, he hesitates to call himself a \"singer-songwriter\":\n\n''{{quote|\"It's kind of rough being a solo artist.

All 300 members of the [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly]] were elected, 253 from [[first-past-the-post]] [[_South Korean Legislature Constituencies|constituencies]] and 47 from [[party-list proportional representation|proportional party lists]].\n\nThe election was a landslide victory for the liberal [[Democratic Party of Korea|Democratic Party]] which defeated the conservative [[United Future Party]]. The Democratic Party and its satellite party, the [[Together Citizens' Party]], won 180 out of 300 seats, or 60% of seats.

It is based on the true story of the pursuit of American serial killer [[John Wayne Gacy]].\n\n== Plot ==\nAs he investigates the missing person report of a teenager named Chris Gant (based on Gacy's final victim, Robert Piest), [[Des Plaines, IL]] detective Lt. Joe Kozenczak (Riley) becomes concerned that local businessman John Wayne Gacy (Dennehy) may be responsible for this as well as many other disappearances. However, when he and his team are ready to arrest Gacy, their evidence is viewed as being circumstantial. Worst of all, everyone (including Kozenczak's superiors) view Gacy as a respectable pillar of society. Meanwhile, Gacy himself begins a sadistic game of [[cat and mouse|cat-and-mouse]] as he tries in every way to manipulate and outwit the police.\n\nAfter eventually achieving two search warrants, Kozenczak finds a large amount of incriminating evidence, and later 29 bodies buried throughout John Gacy's property; the remaining four are found dumped in a nearby river, including Gant's remains. Afterwards, he is charged with the rape and murder of 33 boys and young men and convicted, being sentenced to death.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Brian Dennehy]] as [[John Wayne Gacy]]\n* [[Michael Riley]] as Lieutenant Joseph 'Joe / Polock' Kozenczak\n* [[Margot Kidder]] as Rachel Grayson\n* [[Meg Foster]] as City Attorney Linda Carlson\n* [[Martin Julien]] as Theodore 'Ted' Koslo\n* [[Scott Hylands]] as Delta Squad Sergeant Mike Paxton\n* [[David Eisner (actor)|David Eisner]] as Detective Terry Williams\n* [[John Boylan (Canadian actor)|John Boylan]] as Detective Gary Atkins\n* [[Tony De Santis]] as Delta Squad Detective Craig DeMarco\n* [[Mark Humphrey (actor)|Mark Humphrey]] as Delta Squad Detective King\n* [[Gary Reineke]] as Delta Squad Detective Leonard 'Lenny' Petrie\n* [[Tim Progosh]] as Delta Squad Detective Jack Morris\n* [[Danny Pawlick]] as Patrolman Tony Santori\n* [[Bruce Ramsay]] as Forensic Officer Edward 'Ed' Bragg\n* [[Brenda Bazinet]] as Alice Pearson\n* [[Liliane Clune]] as Marcia Kozenczak\n* [[Toby Proctor]] as Michael Kozenczak\n* [[Christopher Marren]] as Billy\n* [[Jay Brazeau]] as Jake Burns\n\n== Impact/reception ==\n\nThe film was broadcast in three countries, the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-13/entertainment/ca-1440_1_eye-view|title=TV Reviews :  'To Catch a Killer' a Cop's-Eye View of Gacy Case|last=ROSENBERG|first=HOWARD|date=1992-05-13|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-10-16|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref><ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbcone/london/1994-08-19 ''bbc.co.uk: 19 August 1994'']</ref> In general, the film was received well by critics. As a result, Brian Dennehy was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for \"Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Special.\" In addition, actor Michael Riley and director Eric Till were both nominated for two individual [[Gemini Awards]].\n\n== Historical context ==\n\nThe film broadly follows the historical narrative of the investigation leading to John Wayne Gacy's arrest in December 1978 and does not directly depict his earlier life or criminal activity prior to 1978. Several changes to names and details of real persons involved in the case were made. This was likely for legal reasons, as many key witnesses and victims' family members, as well as Gacy himself, were still alive at the time of production. Gacy's last known victim Robert Piest was represented in the film as 'Chris Gant'. The name of Gacy's contracting company was changed from 'PDM Contractors' to 'LPW Construction' in the film. The real-life detective Lt. Joseph R. Kozenczak served as a technical advisor to the production.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/joseph-r-kozenczak-des-plaines-detective-chief-on-the-gacy-serial-slayer-case-dead-at-75/|title=Joseph R.

Afterwards, he is charged with the rape and murder of 33 boys and young men and convicted, being sentenced to death.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Brian Dennehy]] as John Wayne Gacy\n* [[Michael Riley]] as Lieutenant Joseph 'Joe / Polock' Kozenczak\n* [[Margot Kidder]] as Rachel Grayson\n* [[Meg Foster]] as City Attorney Linda Carlson\n* [[Martin Julien]] as Theodore 'Ted' Koslo\n* [[Scott Hylands]] as Delta Squad Sergeant Mike Paxton\n* [[David Eisner (actor)|David Eisner]] as Detective Terry Williams\n* [[John Boylan (Canadian actor)|John Boylan]] as Detective Gary Atkins\n* [[Tony De Santis]] as Delta Squad Detective Craig DeMarco\n* [[Mark Humphrey (actor)|Mark Humphrey]] as Delta Squad Detective King\n* [[Gary Reineke]] as Delta Squad Detective Leonard 'Lenny' Petrie\n* [[Tim Progosh]] as Delta Squad Detective Jack Morris\n* [[Danny Pawlick]] as Patrolman Tony Santori\n* [[Bruce Ramsay]] as Forensic Officer Edward 'Ed' Bragg\n* [[Brenda Bazinet]] as Alice Pearson\n* [[Liliane Clune]] as Marcia Kozenczak\n* [[Toby Proctor]] as Michael Kozenczak\n* [[Christopher Marren]] as Billy\n* [[Jay Brazeau]] as Jake Burns\n\n== Impact/reception ==\n\nThe film was broadcast in three countries, the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-13/entertainment/ca-1440_1_eye-view|title=TV Reviews :  'To Catch a Killer' a Cop's-Eye View of Gacy Case|last=ROSENBERG|first=HOWARD|date=1992-05-13|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-10-16|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref><ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbcone/london/1994-08-19 ''bbc.co.uk: 19 August 1994'']</ref> In general, the film was received well by critics. As a result, Brian Dennehy was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for \"Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Special.\" In addition, actor Michael Riley and director Eric Till were both nominated for two individual [[Gemini Awards]].\n\n== Historical context ==\n\nThe film broadly follows the historical narrative of the investigation leading to John Wayne Gacy's arrest in December 1978 and does not directly depict his earlier life or criminal activity prior to 1978. Several changes to names and details of real persons involved in the case were made. This was likely for legal reasons, as many key witnesses and victims' family members, as well as Gacy himself, were still alive at the time of production. Gacy's last known victim Robert Piest was represented in the film as 'Chris Gant'. The name of Gacy's contracting company was changed from 'PDM Contractors' to 'LPW Construction' in the film. The real-life detective Lt. Joseph R. Kozenczak served as a technical advisor to the production.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/joseph-r-kozenczak-des-plaines-detective-chief-on-the-gacy-serial-slayer-case-dead-at-75/|title=Joseph R.

The primary focus of these rotations was to conduct Maritime Interception Operations as part of a US, Australian and British force enforcing [[United Nations]] Security Council resolutions against Iraq.  The first rotation consisted of Her Majesty's Australian Ships (HMAS) ''[[HMAS Sydney (FFG 03)|Sydney]]'', ''[[HMAS Adelaide (FFG 01)|Adelaide]]'' and [[HMAS Kanimbla (L-51)|''Kanimbla'']].

On 20 March 2003, HMA Ships ''Kanimbla'', ''Anzac'' and ''Darwin'' participated in the combat phase of the 2003 Iraq War, codenamed [[Operation Falconer]]; in April ''Kanimbla'' supported Operation Baghdad Assist, delivering medical supplies that were transported to Baghdad.<ref name=workingpaper/> During these operations the Australian ships pioneered a number of techniques that increased the effectiveness of Maritime Interception Force operations leading to them intercepting and boarding about 1,700 vessels in this period.

Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762 at [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]], the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife Margaret.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} John Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships. Four ships seen stern on in the right of the picture, obscured by clouds of smoke, a fifth ship seen bow on in the left.|''Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\n[[File:Goodman's fields on Roque's map 1746.png|thumb|right|upright=1|The [[Tenterground]] in [[Goodman's Fields]] marked on [[John Rocque's Map of London, 1746]]]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home at Donhead Lodge on [[Barkers Hill]].{{r|\"CW:49\"}}{{r|DH:30}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active.

Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762 at [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]], the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife Margaret.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} John Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships.

Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\n[[File:Goodman's fields on Roque's map 1746.png|thumb|right|upright=1|The [[Tenterground]] in [[Goodman's Fields]] marked on [[John Rocque's Map of London, 1746]]]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home at Donhead Lodge on [[Barkers Hill]].{{r|\"CW:49\"}}{{r|DH:30}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} After Cooke's death, Louisa remained in residence at Donhead Lodge until 1813.{{r|DH:30}} She died at her home, 9 Montpellier Terrace, [[Montpellier, Cheltenham]], on 5 February 1853 aged 96.{{r|\"LC:Death\"}} The funeral was held at [[St Peter's Church, Leckhampton]], on 11 February 1853, with interment following in the churchyard.{{r|\"LC:Funeral\"}} Louisa Charlotte Cooke, their only child, was born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa Charlotte married Abraham John Newenham Devonsher of Kilshanick, County Cork, at Cheltenham, on 9 March 1820.{{r|LCC:Marriage}} Formerly of [[Hinton Charterhouse]], she died after a short illness at St. Anne\u2019s, Albion Street, Cheltenham, on 30 April 1871 aged 74.{{r|LCC:Death}} She was interred at Bouncer's Lane Cemetery, [[Prestbury, Gloucestershire|Prestbury]], Cheltenham, on 5 May 1871.{{r|\"LCC:Funeral\"}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} A number of sources, including T. A. Heathcote's ''Nelson's Trafalgar Captains and Their Battles'', [[Colin White (historian)|Colin White's]] ''The Trafalgar Captains'' and [[John Knox Laughton|John Knox Laughton's]] entry for Cooke in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' give a birth year of 1763 and omit most information about Cooke's early life. Nicholas Tracy's entry in ''Who's Who in Nelson's Navy'' provides fuller coverage of Cooke's early life, and includes a specific baptism date. Cooke's baptism register entry records that he was \"borne {{sic}} 17th February in 4 Tenters\".{{r|\"John Cooke Baptism\"}} Tenters was then part of the [[Tenterground]] in [[Goodman's Fields]], [[London]].
