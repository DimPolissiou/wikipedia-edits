The attack was directed against trains passing through [[Kasumigaseki]] and [[Nagatach\u014d, Tokyo|Nagatach\u014d]], where the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]] (Japanese parliament) is headquartered in Tokyo.\n\nThe group, led by [[Shoko Asahara]], had already carried out several assassinations and terrorist attacks using sarin, including the [[Matsumoto sarin attack]] nine months earlier. They had also produced several other nerve agents, including [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]], and attempted to produce [[botulinum toxin]] and had perpetrated several failed acts of [[bioterrorism]]. Asahara had been made aware of a police raid scheduled for March 22 and had planned the Tokyo subway attack in order to hinder police investigations into the cult and perhaps spark the [[apocalypse]] they believed in. The leader also wanted to start a Third World War.\n\nIn the raid following the attack, police arrested many senior members of the cult. Police activity continued throughout the summer, and over 200 members were arrested, including Asahara. Thirteen of the senior Aum management were sentenced to death and later executed; many others were given prison sentences up to life. The attack remains the deadliest terrorist incident in Japan as defined by [[Definitions of terrorism|modern standards]].{{efn|The definition of \"terrorism\" has changed over time, sporadic rebel clashes and/or raids throughout Japanese history can also be seen as a form of terrorism.}}\n\n==Background==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Aum Shinrikyo===\n====Origins====\n[[File:Aum symbol.png|thumb|Symbol of Aum Shinrikyo.]]\n[[Aum Shinrikyo]] was founded in 1984 as a yoga and meditation class, initially known as {{nihongo|''Oumu Shinsen no Kai''|\u30aa\u30a6\u30e0\u795e\u4ed9\u306e\u4f1a|\"Aum Mountain Hermits\u2019 Society\"}}, by pharmacist [[Chizuo Matsumoto]].

In 1987, the group rebranded and established a [[New York City|New York]] branch; the following year, it opened a headquarters in [[Fujinomiya City|Fujinomiya]]. Around this time, the mental health of Matsumoto (now going by the name Shoko Asahara) deteriorated \u2013 he developed a [[Hypochondriasis|health anxiety]] and expressed suicidal views.<ref name=\"clock\">{{cite book|title=A Clock That Has Stopped|last=Matsumoto|first=Rika|year=2015|publisher=\u8b1b\u8ac7\u793e}}<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nIn August 1989, the group was granted official religious corporation status by the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Government]], giving it privileges such as tax breaks and freedom from governmental oversight.

Despite showing confidence in their ability to gain seats in the diet, the party received only 1,783 votes; the failure to achieve power legitimately, blamed by Asahara on an external conspiracy propagated by ''\"[[Freemasons]] and [[Jews]]\"'', caused him to order the cult to produce [[botulinum]] and [[phosgene]] in order to overthrow the Japanese government. As members became disillusioned with the group (following contact with the outside world made during the election campaign) and defected, an attitude among the remaining members that 'the unenlightened' did not deserve salvation became accepted.<ref name=murakami>{{cite book|title=Underground: The Tokyo Gas Attack and the Japanese Psyche|last=Murakami|first=Haruki|year=1997|publisher=Kodansha|isbn=0-375-72580-6|url=https://archive.org/details/undergroundtokyo00haru}}</ref>\n\nAttempts to stockpile botulinum toxin proved unsuccessful.

In total, around 50 batches of 9,000 litres of a crude broth were produced \u2013 however, the cult did not attempt to purify the broth (which mostly would have consisted of [[growth medium|bacterial cultivation media]]; one member even fell into one of the fermenters and nearly drowned, but otherwise suffered no ill effects).<ref name=cnas>{{cite web|url=http://files.cnas.org.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/CNAS_AumShinrikyo_Danzig_1.pdf|title=Aum Shinrikyo: Insights Into How Terrorists Develop Biological and Chemical Weapons|date=July 2011|publisher=Centre for a New American Security|access-date=2018-05-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190729072552/http://files.cnas.org.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/CNAS_AumShinrikyo_Danzig_1.pdf|archive-date=2019-07-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDespite mouse bioassays run by Tomomasu Nakagawa (another cult member assisting Endo) returning no toxic effects, in April 1990 the crude broth was loaded into three trucks equipped with custom spray devices, which was to be sprayed at two US naval bases, Narita airport, the Diet building, the Imperial Palace, and the headquarters of a rival religious group.<ref name=chronology>{{cite web|url=http://www.nonproliferation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/aum_chrn.pdf|title=Chronology of Aum Shinrikyo's CBQ Activities|date=June 2016|publisher=Monterey Institute of International Studies|access-date=2018-05-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411091246/https://www.nonproliferation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/aum_chrn.pdf|archive-date=2018-04-11|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSimultaneously, Asahara announced that the coming apocalyptic war could not save people outside of the cult, and that members should attend a three-day seminar in [[Ishigaki, Okinawa|Ishigakijima]] in order to seek shelter. The spraying attacks failed to cause any ill effects among the population but 1270 people attended the seminar, many of them becoming devout monks.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nWith the intention of building a compound incorporating facilities such as a phosgene plant (as well as facilities to manufacture [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]] and [[chlorine]] gas), Aum Shinrikyo used 14 dummy companies to purchase acres of land in Namino (now part of [[Aso, Kumamoto|Aso city]]), and began construction. However, public attitudes towards the cult had become very negative due to suspicions around the cult's illegal activities. These attitudes were exacerbated once it was revealed to the surrounding community that the group had acted illegally. A police investigation in October resulted in the arrests of several Aum members, causing Asahara to fear a police raid \u2013 he hence ordered the destruction of all biological and chemical weapon stockpiles, and for the cult to focus on legitimate, non-violent strategies only.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n====Restarting violent activity====\nAfter the destruction of the illegal weapon stockpiles, the cult relied on 'mainstream' methods to attract other members \u2013 this included frequent television appearances by Asahara, as well as the setting up of the 'Aum Shinrikyo broadcasting' radio station in Russia in April 1992. However, starting in late 1992, Asahara's mental health deteriorated further \u2013 his suicidal feelings intensified, he began to complain of hallucinations and paranoia,<ref name=clock/> and he withdrew from public appearances (except for on Aum Shinrikyo Broadcasting), claiming society was preventing him from fulfilling his destiny as Christ. The concurrent replacement of the previously predominantly female group of top advisers with a more aggressive male group lead to the gradual restarting of the violent campaign to seize power.

In September 1992, Asahara was made president of the ironworks, resulting in 90% of staff being dismissed or leaving due to the 'Aum-ification' of the plant. These workers were replaced with other members of the group. Over the course of 1993, the cult smuggled [[AK-74]] rifles and 5.45mm bullets, and began to prototype rifles based on the AK-74 design.\n[[File:Layout_of_Aum_Shinrikyo_biological_weapons_facility.png|left|thumb|Layout of the Aum Shinrikyo biological weapons facility.]]\nUnder the oversight of Endo, the biological weapons division of the cult resumed \u2013 this time pursuing not only botulinum toxin, but also [[anthrax]], using improved 200-litre drum fermenters at their Kameido facility.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nAgain, the group did not attempt to purify the resulting product, which resembled a foul-smelling brown slurry. Further failed attacks on individuals were attempted in 1993 and 1994 using botulinum \u2013 first using a homemade sprayer mounted to a car, and then by mixing with juice \u2013 but neither had any effects. Five days before the sarin attack on the Tokyo subways, botulinum was dispersed in a failed attack on [[Kasumigaseki Station (Tokyo)|Kasumigaseki station]] \u2013 a dissident member had replaced the active compound with water, but the cult had failed to acquire an active strain of ''C. botulinum''.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nSimilarly, the Aum anthrax program was a failure \u2013 despite having access to a sympathiser outside of the group who could acquire anthrax spores, the strain received by the group was a Sterne vaccine strain incapable of causing harm. It was unclear why, despite having this knowledge, the group executed two attacks in 1993 using this vaccine strain \u2013 once from the roof of the headquarters building in Kameido, and once from a truck with a custom spraying device, aimed at the Diet building, Imperial Palace, and Tokyo Tower. Both attacks caused no effects other than a foul smell, reported by passers-by.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn the summer of 1993, Endo attempted a different strategy \u2013 by desiccating the slurry, the ''B. anthracis'' spores could be spread as a powder, rather than through spraying \u2013 this was achieved with a crude hot air dryer. Nakagawa has claimed that an attempt was made to spread this powder through the centre of Tokyo, but this, also, had no effects. The total failure of the biological weapons program had, by mid-1993, convinced Asahara to focus on the chemical weapons division under Masami Tsuchiya. While Endo would be promoted within the cult to 'health minister' in 1994 \u2013 reflecting his seniority \u2013 no further attacks using biological weapons were attempted.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Chemical weapon production===\nTsuchiya had established a small laboratory in their [[Kamikuishiki, Yamanashi|Kamikuishiki]] complex in November 1992. After initial research (done at [[Tsukuba University]], where he had previously studied chemistry), he suggested to Hideo Murai \u2013 a senior Aum advisor who had tasked him with researching chemical weapons in November 1992, out of fear that the cult would soon be attacked with them \u2013 that the most cost-effective substance to synthesise would be sarin.<ref name=cnas/>\n\nHe was subsequently ordered to produce a small amount \u2013 within a month, the necessary equipment had been ordered and installed, and 10-20g of sarin had been produced via synthetic procedures derived from the five-step DHMP process as originally described by IG Farben in 1938, and as used by the Allies after World War II.<ref name=cnas/>\n\nAfter this small quantity had been produced, Murai ordered Tsuchiya to produce about 70  tons \u2013 when Tsuchiya protested, noting that this level of scaling was not feasible in a research laboratory, a chemical plant was ordered to be built alongside the biological production facility in the Fujigamine district of Kamikuishiki, to be labelled Satyan-7 ('Truth'). The specialised equipment and substantial chemicals needed to run the facility were purchased using [[shell companies]] under Hasegawa Chemical, a chemical company already owned by Aum. At the same time, in September 1993, Asahara and 24 other cult members travelled from Tokyo to [[Perth]], Australia, bringing generators, tools, protective equipment (including gas masks and respirators), and chemicals to make sarin.\n\nAfter repurchasing chemicals confiscated by customs, the group chartered aircraft from Perth to [[Banjawarn Station]], where they searched for uranium deposits to make [[Nuclear terrorism|nuclear weapons]], and may have tested the efficacy of the synthesised sarin on animals. They remained in Australia for eight days and attempted to return in October of the same year, but were denied visas \u2013 Banjawarn Station would be sold a year later.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n[[File:Overhead_view_of_Satyan_7.png|thumb|Overhead view of the Satyan-7 chemical weapon facility.]]\nThe Satyan-7 facility was declared ready for occupancy by September 1993 with the capacity to produce about 40\u201350 litres of sarin, being equipped with 30L capacity mixing flasks within protective hoods, and eventually employing 100 Aum members; the UN would later estimate the value of the building and its contents at $30 million.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Cult at the End of the World: The Terrifying Story of the Aum Doomsday Cult, from the Subways of Tokyo to the Nuclear Arsenals of Russia|last1=Kaplan|first1=David|last2=Marshall|first2=Andrew|year=1996|publisher=Crown Publishing|isbn=978-0517705438}}</ref>\n\nDespite the safety features and often state-of-the-art equipment and practices, the operation of the facility was very unsafe - one analyst would later describe the cult as having 'a high degree of book learning, but virtually nothing in the way of technical skill'.<ref name=olson>{{cite journal|last1=Olson|first1=Kyle|date=1996|title=Overview: Recent events and responder implications|url=https://biotech.law.lsu.edu/blaw/FEMA/Proceedings.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the Seminar on Responding to the Consequences of Chemical and Biological Terrorism|volume=2|issue=36|pages=2\u201393|access-date=2018-05-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194732/http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/blaw/FEMA/Proceedings.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWhen the facility developed leaks, buckets were used to contain spills; several technicians inhaled fumes on repeated occasions, developing 'symptoms ranging from nosebleeds to convulsions',<ref name=ataxia-chapter3/> and toxic chemicals leaked from the site and into the soil. Citizens lodged complaints about foul smells several times, with the cult claiming that the [[US Army]] had assaulted the complex with poison gas. An accident at the plant in November 1994 would eventually force the suspension of the production of chemical agents.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nBy December, Tsuchiya had accumulated in total about 3&nbsp;kg of sarin \u2013 from this, two separate assassination attempts were made on [[Daisaku Ikeda]], leader of [[Soka Gakkai]] (a rival Japanese religious movement), in mid-1994. The first attack involved a truck with a spraying system, as previously used \u2013 the spraying system malfunctioned, spraying sarin into the truck itself, and mildly poisoning the operators. The second attack utilised a truck modified to include an evaporation system based on heating sarin over a gas stove fire; despite prior warnings from cult member Kazuyoshi Takizawa, the truck caught fire during the dissemination, severely poisoning the driver Tomomitsu Niimi and causing both Niimi and Murai \u2013 the operators \u2013 to flee. Niimi received an injection of [[atropine]] and pralidoximine iodine, saving his life.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nDespite the failure of the attack, the members of Aum were convinced of sarin's efficacy, prompting Asahara to appoint Takizawa in charge of operations of Satyan-7; Tsuchiya was assigned to several other projects and would go on to manufacture several [[psychoactives]] \u2013 [[LSD]], [[Phencyclidine|PCP]], [[methamphetamine]], [[mescaline]], and [[phenobarbital]] to be used in the cult activities and [[brainwashing]]; he would also manufacture small amounts of phosgene, VX, [[soman]], [[cyclosarin]], and gunpowder.

About a week later, on 27 June, 30L of sarin was loaded onto a truck equipped with a fan, heater, and pump \u2013 six members, pre-administered with sarin antidotes and wearing improvised gas masks, began the propagation of sarin at around 10:40pm, spraying for around 10\u201320 minutes.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nDue to it being a warm evening, many residents had left their windows open while they slept \u2013 the first emergency call was made at 11:09pm. Within an hour, a mass disaster caused by an unknown toxic gas had been declared. Fifty-eight people were hospitalised, of whom eight people died, and an additional 253 people sought medical care at outpatient clinics.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n[[File:Description_of_Aum_Shinrikyo_sarin_truck.png|thumb|Depiction of Aum Shinrikyo sarin truck.]]\nInvestigations after the Matsumoto attack were generally inconclusive, with the primary suspect being [[Yoshiyuki K\u014dno (victim)|Yoshiyuki K\u014dno]], whose wife had been left comatose by the attack. Blame would not be clearly attributed to Aum Shinrikyo until after the subway attack, despite tipoffs \u2013 in September 1994, two anonymous letters were sent to major media outlets in Japan \u2013 the first asserting that the group were responsible for the attack, and the second claiming that Matsumoto was an open-air 'experiment of sorts', noting that the results would have been much worse if sarin had been released indoors, such as in 'a crowded subway'.<ref name=ataxia-chapter3/>\n\nFollowing an accident at Satyan-7 the next month (and complaints from the surrounding communities), a police investigation revealed [[methylphosphonic acid]] and isopropyl methylphosphonic acid \u2013 the former being a degradation product of sarin, and the latter being a definitive signature of both sarin production and of failures in production. However, there was no law at the time prohibiting the production of the nerve agents. This evidence was left unacted on, but was leaked to the [[Yomiuri Shimbun]] in January 1995, alerting Asahara and the cult, and causing Nakagawa and Endo to begin the process of destroying and/or hiding all nerve agents and biological weapons, which lasted until the end of February.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Preparation for the attack===\nFingerprint evidence for an Aum member linked to an earlier kidnapping, in addition to the sarin-contaminated soil samples, caused the police to set a raid date for 22 March. Asahara was made aware of the impending raid by two cult members inside the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Self-Defense Forces]], and ordered an attack on Tokyo subway lines close to the Metropolitan Police Department on the morning of the 20th March \u2013 possibly as a desperate attack to initiate the apocalypse.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Holy Terror: Armageddon in Tokyo|last=Brackett|first=D.

Later forensic analysis found that the sarin utilised in the attack was roughly half as pure as that used in the Matsumoto attack.\n\n==Attack==\nOn Monday, 20 March 1995, five members of [[Aum Shinrikyo]] launched a chemical attack on the [[Tokyo subway]] (on lines that are part of the present-day [[Tokyo Metro]]), one of the world's busiest commuter transport systems, at the peak of the morning [[rush hour]]. The chemical agent used, liquid [[sarin]], was contained in plastic bags which each team then wrapped in newspaper. Each perpetrator carried two packets totaling approximately {{convert|0.9|liter|floz}} of sarin, except Yasuo Hayashi, who carried three bags totalling approximately {{convert|1.3|liter|floz}} of sarin. Aum originally planned to spread the sarin as an aerosol but did not follow through with it.  Sarin has an [[Median lethal dose|LD<sub>50</sub>]] of {{val|550|u=\u00b5g|up=kg}}, corresponding to {{val|38.5|u=mg}} for a {{val|70|u=kg}} ({{val|154|u=lb}}) human; however, dispersal issues dramatically reduce its effectiveness.\n\nCarrying their packets of sarin and umbrellas with sharpened tips, the perpetrators boarded their appointed trains. At prearranged stations, the sarin packets were dropped and punctured several times with the sharpened tip of the umbrella. Each perpetrator then got off the train and exited the station to meet his accomplice with a car.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite journal|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/03/march-20-1995-poison-gas-wreaks-tokyo-subway-terror-2/|title=March 20, 1995: Poison Gas Wreaks Tokyo Subway Terror|first=WIRED|last=Staff|journal=Wired|date=Mar 20, 2009|accessdate=Apr 18, 2020|via=www.wired.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180911232211/https://www.wired.com/2009/03/march-20-1995-poison-gas-wreaks-tokyo-subway-terror-2/|archive-date=September 11, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Leaving the punctured packets on the floor allowed the sarin to leak out into the train car and stations.

The train continued on to the next station where it was completely stopped, evacuated and cleaned.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Marunouchi Line===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\n\n====Ogikubo-bound====\n[[File:Marunouchi-ogi map sarin attack.png|thumb|300px|left|Detailed map of the attack on the [[Ogikubo Station|Ogikubo]]-bound [[Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line|Marunouchi Line]] train.]]\nTwo men, Ken'ichi Hirose and Koichi Kitamura, were assigned to release two sarin packets on the westbound [[Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line|Marunouchi Line]] destined for [[Ogikubo Station]]. The pair left Aum headquarters in [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] at 6:00&nbsp;am and drove to [[Yotsuya Station]]. There Hirose boarded a westbound Marunouchi Line train, then changed to a northbound [[East Japan Railway Company|JR East]] [[Saiky\u014d Line]] train at [[Shinjuku Station]] and got off at [[Ikebukuro Station]]. He then bought a sports tabloid to wrap the sarin packets in and boarded the second car of Marunouchi Line train A777.\n\nAs he was about to release the sarin, Hirose believed the loud noises caused by the newspaper-wrapped packets had caught the attention of a [[student|schoolgirl]]. To avoid further suspicion, he got off the train at either [[Myogadani Station|Myogadani]] or [[Korakuen Station]] and moved to the third car instead of the second.\n\nAs the train approached [[Ochanomizu Station]], Hirose dropped the newspapers to the floor, repeated an Aum mantra and punctured both sarin packets with so much force that he bent the tip of his sharpened umbrella. Both packets were successfully broken, and all {{convert|900|ml|floz}} of sarin was released onto the floor of the train. Hirose then departed the train at Ochanomizu and left via Kitamura's car waiting outside the station. Hirose's clumsy release of the sarin resulted in him accidentally poisoning himself, but he was able to administer an antidote stored in Kitamura's car.\n\nAt [[Nakano-sakaue Station]], 14 stops later, two severely injured passengers were carried out of the train car, while station attendant Sumio Nishimura removed the sarin packets (one of these two passengers was the only fatality from this attack). The train continued with sarin still on the floor of the third car. Five stops later, at 8:38&nbsp;am, the train reached [[Ogikubo Station]], the end of the [[Marunouchi Line]], all while passengers continued to board the train. The train continued eastbound until it was finally taken out of service at [[Shin-K\u014denji Station]] two stops later. The entire ordeal resulted in one passenger's death with 358 being seriously injured.\n\n====Ikebukuro-bound====\n[[File:Marunouchi-ike map sarin attack.png|thumb|300px|right|Detailed map of the attack on the [[Ikebukuro Station|Ikebukuro]]-bound [[Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line|Marunouchi Line]] train.]]\nMasato Yokoyama and his driver Kiyotaka Tonozaki were assigned to release sarin on the [[Ikebukuro Station|Ikebukuro]]-bound Marunouchi Line. On the way to [[Shinjuku Station]], Tonozaki stopped to allow Yokoyama to buy a copy of ''[[Nihon Keizai Shimbun]]'', to wrap the two sarin packets. When they arrived at the station, Yokoyama put on a wig and fake glasses and boarded the fifth car of the Ikebukuro-bound 07:39 Marunouchi Line train number B801. As the train approached [[Yotsuya Station]], Yokoyama began poking at the sarin packets. When the train reached the next station, he fled the scene with Tonozaki, leaving the sarin packets on the train car. The packets were not fully punctured. During his drop, Yokoyama left one packet fully intact, while the other packet was only punctured once (and with a small hole), resulting in the sarin being released relatively slowly.\n\nThe train reached the end of the line, Ikebukuro, at 8:30&nbsp;am where it would head back in the opposite direction. Before it departed the train was evacuated and searched, but the searchers failed to discover the sarin packets. The train departed Ikebukuro Station at 8:32&nbsp;am as the Shinjuku-bound A801. Passengers soon became ill and alerted station attendants of the sarin-soaked newspapers at [[K\u014drakuen Station]]. One station later, at [[Hong\u014d-sanch\u014dme Station|Hong\u014d-sanch\u014dme]], staff removed the sarin packets and mopped the floor, but the train continued on to Shinjuku. After arriving at 9:09&nbsp;am, the train once again began to make its way back to Ikebukuro as the B901. The train was finally put out of service at [[Kokkai-gijid\u014d-mae Station]] in Chiyoda at 9:27&nbsp;am, one hour and forty minutes after Yokoyama punctured the sarin packet. The attack resulted in no fatalities, but over 200 people were left in serious condition.\n\n===Hibiya Line===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\n\n====T\u014dbu D\u014dbutsu K\u014den-bound====\n[[File:HibiyaLine ne bound sarin attack.png|thumb|left|Detailed map of the attack on the [[T\u014dbu D\u014dbutsu K\u014den Station|T\u014dbu D\u014dbutsu K\u014den]]-bound [[Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line|Hibiya Line]] train.]]\nToru Toyoda and his driver Katsuya Takahashi were assigned to release sarin on the northeast-bound [[Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line|Hibiya Line]].\n\nThe pair, with Takahashi driving, left Aum headquarters in Shibuya at 6:30&nbsp;am. After purchasing a copy of ''[[Hochi Shimbun]]'' and wrapping his two sarin packets, Toyoda arrived at [[Naka-Meguro Station]] where he boarded the first car of northeast-bound 07:59 Hibiya Line train number B711T. Sitting close to the door, he set the sarin packets on the floor. When the train arrived at the next station, [[Ebisu Station (Tokyo)|Ebisu]], Toyoda punctured both packets and got off the train. He was on the train for a total of two minutes, by far the quickest sarin drop out of the five attacks that day.\n\nTwo stops later, at [[Roppongi Station]], passengers in the train's first car began to feel the effects of the sarin and began to open the windows. By [[Kamiyacho Station]], the next stop, the passengers in the car had begun panicking. The first car was evacuated and several passengers were immediately taken to a hospital. Still, with the first car empty, the train continued down the line for one more stop until it was completely evacuated at [[Kasumigaseki Station (Tokyo)|Kasumigaseki Station]]. This attack killed one person and seriously injured 532 others.\n\n====Naka-Meguro-bound====\n[[File:HibiyaLine se bound sarin attack.png|thumb|Detailed map of the attack on the [[Naka-Meguro Station|Naka-Meguro]]-bound [[Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line|Hibiya Line]] train.]]\nYasuo Hayashi and Shigeo Sugimoto were the team assigned to drop sarin on the southwest-bound Hibiya Line departing [[Kita-Senju Station]] for [[Naka-Meguro Station]]. Unlike the rest of the attackers, Hayashi carried three sarin packets onto the train instead of two. Prior to the attack, Hayashi asked to carry a flawed leftover packet in addition to the two others in an apparent bid to allay suspicions and prove his loyalty to the group.\n\nAfter Sugimoto escorted him to [[Ueno Station]], Hayashi boarded the third car of southwest-bound 07:43 Hibiya Line train number A720S and dropped his sarin packets to the floor. Two stops later, at [[Akihabara Station]], he punctured two of the three packets, left the train, and arrived back at Aum headquarters with Sugimoto by 8:30&nbsp;am. Hayashi made the most punctures of any of the perpetrators. By the next stop, passengers in the third car began to feel the effects of the sarin. Noticing the large, liquid-soaked package on the floor and assuming it was the culprit, one passenger kicked the sarin packets out of the train and onto [[Kodenmach\u014d Station]]'s subway platform. Four people in the station died as a result.\n\nA puddle of sarin remained on the floor of the passenger car as the train continued to the next station. At 8:10&nbsp;am, after the train pulled out of [[Hatch\u014dbori Station (Tokyo)|Hatch\u014dbori Station]], a passenger in the third car pressed the emergency stop button. The train was in a tunnel at the time, and was forced to proceed to [[Tsukiji Station]], where passengers stumbled out and collapsed on the station's platform and the train was taken out of service.\n\nThe attack was originally believed to be an explosion and was thus labeled as such in media reports. Eventually, station attendants realized that the attack was not an explosion, but rather a chemical attack. At 8:35&nbsp;am, the Hibiya Line was completely shut down and all commuters were evacuated. Between the five stations affected in this attack, 8 people died and 275 were seriously injured.\n\n==Main perpetrators==\nTen men were responsible for carrying out the attacks: five released the sarin, while the other five served as [[Crime scene getaway|getaway drivers]].\n\nThe teams were:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Dr. Nobuo Yanagisawa had experience with treating sarin poisoning after the [[Matsumoto incident]]; he recognized the symptoms, had information on diagnosis and treatment collected, and led a team who sent the information to hospitals throughout Tokyo via fax.\n\n[[St. Luke's International Hospital]] in Tsukiji was one of very few hospitals in Tokyo at that time to have the entire building wired and piped for conversion into a \"field hospital\" in the event of a major disaster. This proved to be a very fortunate coincidence as the hospital was able to take in most of the 600+ victims at Tsukiji Station, resulting in no fatalities at that station.\n\nAs there was a severe shortage of antidotes in Tokyo, sarin antidote stored in rural hospitals as an antidote for herbicide/insecticide poisoning was delivered to nearby [[Shinkansen]] stations, where it was collected by a Ministry of Health official on a train bound for Tokyo.\n\n===Defense offered by Japanese and American scholars===\nAum had carefully cultivated the friendship of Japanese scholars of religion. After the sarin gas attack, some of them, including Shimada Hiromi, a professor at Tokyo's [[Japan Women's University]], suggested Aum may be innocent. Shimada later apologized, claiming he had been deceived by Aum, but his and others' statements damaged the public image of scholars of religion in general in Japan.

The Tokyo High Court postponed its decision on the appeal until results were obtained from a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation, which was issued to determine whether Asahara was fit to stand trial. In February 2006, the court ruled that Asahara was indeed fit to stand trial, and on 27 March 2006, rejected the appeal against his death sentence. Japan's Supreme Court upheld this decision on 15 September 2006. Two re-trial appeals were declined by the appellate court. In June 2012, Asahara's execution was postponed due to the further arrests of the two remaining Aum Shinrikyo members wanted in connection with the attack.

In 1987, the group rebranded and established a [[New York City|New York]] branch; the following year, it opened a headquarters in [[Fujinomiya City|Fujinomiya]]. Around this time, the mental health of Matsumoto (now going by the name Shoko Asahara) deteriorated \u2013 he developed a [[Hypochondriasis|health anxiety]] and expressed suicidal views.<ref name=\"clock\">{{cite book|title=A Clock That Has Stopped|last=Matsumoto|first=Rika|year=2015|publisher=\u8b1b\u8ac7\u793e}}<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nIn August 1989, the group was granted official religious corporation status by the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Government]], giving it privileges such as tax breaks and freedom from governmental oversight. This recognition caused dramatic growth, including an increase in net worth from less than 430 million yen to over 100 billion yen (approximately $5.6m to $1.1b in 2017 dollars) over the next six years, as well as an increase in membership from around 20 members to around 20,000 by 1992.<ref name=\"subcommittee\">{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/congress/1995_rpt/aum/part03.htm|title=A Case Study on Aum Shinrikyo|date=31 October 1995|publisher=Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations|access-date=5 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502195249/http://fas.org/irp/congress/1995_rpt/aum/part03.htm|archive-date=2 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe drastically increasing popularity of the group also saw an increase in violent behaviour from its members. In the year preceding its recognition by the Tokyo government, a member of the cult \u2013 Terayuki Majima \u2013 had accidentally drowned during a ritual; his body was cremated, with the remaining bones ground up and scattered over a nearby lake.

Despite showing confidence in their ability to gain seats in the diet, the party received only 1,783 votes; the failure to achieve power legitimately, blamed by Asahara on an external conspiracy propagated by ''\"[[Freemasons]] and [[Jews]]\"'', caused him to order the cult to produce [[botulinum]] and [[phosgene]] in order to overthrow the Japanese government. As members became disillusioned with the group (following contact with the outside world made during the election campaign) and defected, an attitude among the remaining members that 'the unenlightened' did not deserve salvation became accepted.<ref name=murakami>{{cite book|title=Underground: The Tokyo Gas Attack and the Japanese Psyche|last=Murakami|first=Haruki|year=1997|publisher=Kodansha|isbn=0-375-72580-6|url=https://archive.org/details/undergroundtokyo00haru}}</ref>\n\nAttempts to stockpile botulinum toxin proved unsuccessful.

In total, around 50 batches of 9,000 litres of a crude broth were produced \u2013 however, the cult did not attempt to purify the broth (which mostly would have consisted of [[growth medium|bacterial cultivation media]]; one member even fell into one of the fermenters and nearly drowned, but otherwise suffered no ill effects.<ref name=cnas>{{cite web|url=http://files.cnas.org.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/CNAS_AumShinrikyo_Danzig_1.pdf|title=Aum Shinrikyo: Insights Into How Terrorists Develop Biological and Chemical Weapons|date=July 2011|publisher=Centre for a New American Security|access-date=2018-05-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190729072552/http://files.cnas.org.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/CNAS_AumShinrikyo_Danzig_1.pdf|archive-date=2019-07-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDespite mouse bioassays run by Tomomasu Nakagawa (another cult member assisting Endo) returning no toxic effects, in April 1990 the crude broth was loaded into three trucks equipped with custom spray devices, which was to be sprayed at two US naval bases, Narita airport, the Diet building, the Imperial Palace, and the headquarters of a rival religious group.<ref name=chronology>{{cite web|url=http://www.nonproliferation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/aum_chrn.pdf|title=Chronology of Aum Shinrikyo's CBQ Activities|date=June 2016|publisher=Monterey Institute of International Studies|access-date=2018-05-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411091246/https://www.nonproliferation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/aum_chrn.pdf|archive-date=2018-04-11|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSimultaneously, Asahara announced that the coming apocalyptic war could not save people outside of the cult, and that members should attend a three-day seminar in [[Ishigaki, Okinawa|Ishigakijima]] in order to seek shelter. The spraying attacks failed to cause any ill effects among the population but 1270 people attended the seminar, many of them becoming devout monks.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nWith the intention of building a compound incorporating facilities such as a phosgene plant (as well as facilities to manufacture [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]] and [[chlorine]] gas), Aum Shinrikyo used 14 dummy companies to purchase acres of land in Namino (now part of [[Aso, Kumamoto|Aso city]]), and began construction. However, public attitudes towards the cult had become very negative due to suspicions around the cult's illegal activities. These attitudes were exacerbated once it was revealed to the surrounding community that the group had acted illegally. A police investigation in October resulted in the arrests of several Aum members, causing Asahara to fear a police raid \u2013 he hence ordered the destruction of all biological and chemical weapon stockpiles, and for the cult to focus on legitimate, non-violent strategies only.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n====Restarting violent activity====\nAfter the destruction of the illegal weapon stockpiles, the cult relied on 'mainstream' methods to attract other members \u2013 this included frequent television appearances by Asahara, as well as the setting up of the 'Aum Shinrikyo broadcasting' radio station in Russia in April 1992. However, starting in late 1992, Asahara's mental health deteriorated further \u2013 his suicidal feelings intensified, he began to complain of hallucinations and paranoia,<ref name=clock/> and he withdrew from public appearances (except for on Aum Shinrikyo Broadcasting), claiming society was preventing him from fulfilling his destiny as Christ. The concurrent replacement of the previously predominantly female group of top advisers with a more aggressive male group lead to the gradual restarting of the violent campaign to seize power.

In September 1992, Asahara was made president of the ironworks, resulting in 90% of staff being dismissed or leaving due to the 'Aum-ification' of the plant. These workers were replaced with other members of the group. Over the course of 1993, the cult smuggled [[AK-74]] rifles and 5.45mm bullets, and began to prototype rifles based on the AK-74 design.\n[[File:Layout_of_Aum_Shinrikyo_biological_weapons_facility.png|left|thumb|Layout of the Aum Shinrikyo biological weapons facility.]]\nUnder the oversight of Endo, the biological weapons division of the cult resumed \u2013 this time pursuing not only botulinum toxin, but also [[anthrax]], using improved 200-litre drum fermenters at their Kameido facility.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nAgain, the group did not attempt to purify the resulting product, which resembled a foul-smelling brown slurry. Further failed attacks on individuals were attempted in 1993 and 1994 using botulinum \u2013 first using a homemade sprayer mounted to a car, and then by mixing with juice \u2013 but neither had any effects. Five days before the sarin attack on the Tokyo subways, botulinum was dispersed in a failed attack on [[Kasumigaseki Station (Tokyo)|Kasumigaseki station]] \u2013 a dissident member had replaced the active compound with water, but the cult had failed to acquire an active strain of ''C. botulinum''.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nSimilarly, the Aum anthrax program was a failure \u2013 despite having access to a sympathiser outside of the group who could acquire anthrax spores, the strain received by the group was a Sterne vaccine strain incapable of causing harm. It was unclear why, despite having this knowledge, the group executed two attacks in 1993 using this vaccine strain \u2013 once from the roof of the headquarters building in Kameido, and once from a truck with a custom spraying device, aimed at the Diet building, Imperial Palace, and Tokyo Tower. Both attacks caused no effects other than a foul smell, reported by passers-by.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn the summer of 1993, Endo attempted a different strategy \u2013 by desiccating the slurry, the ''B. anthracis'' spores could be spread as a powder, rather than through spraying \u2013 this was achieved with a crude hot air dryer. Nakagawa has claimed that an attempt was made to spread this powder through the centre of Tokyo, but this, also, had no effects. The total failure of the biological weapons program had, by mid-1993, convinced Asahara to focus on the chemical weapons division under Masami Tsuchiya. While Endo would be promoted within the cult to 'health minister' in 1994 \u2013 reflecting his seniority \u2013 no further attacks using biological weapons were attempted.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Chemical weapon production===\nTsuchiya had established a small laboratory in their [[Kamikuishiki, Yamanashi|Kamikuishiki]] complex in November 1992. After initial research (done at [[Tsukuba University]], where he had previously studied chemistry), he suggested to Hideo Murai \u2013 a senior Aum advisor who had tasked him with researching chemical weapons in November 1992, out of fear that the cult would soon be attacked with them \u2013 that the most cost-effective substance to synthesise would be sarin.<ref name=cnas/>\n\nHe was subsequently ordered to produce a small amount \u2013 within a month, the necessary equipment had been ordered and installed, and 10-20g of sarin had been produced via synthetic procedures derived from the five-step DHMP process as originally described by IG Farben in 1938, and as used by the Allies after World War II.<ref name=cnas/>\n\nAfter this small quantity had been produced, Murai ordered Tsuchiya to produce about 70  tons \u2013 when Tsuchiya protested, noting that this level of scaling was not feasible in a research laboratory, a chemical plant was ordered to be built alongside the biological production facility in the Fujigamine district of Kamikuishiki, to be labelled Satyan-7 ('Truth'). The specialised equipment and substantial chemicals needed to run the facility were purchased using [[shell companies]] under Hasegawa Chemical, a chemical company already owned by Aum. At the same time, in September 1993, Asahara and 24 other cult members travelled from Tokyo to [[Perth]], Australia, bringing generators, tools, protective equipment (including gas masks and respirators), and chemicals to make sarin.\n\nAfter repurchasing chemicals confiscated by customs, the group chartered aircraft from Perth to [[Banjawarn Station]], where they searched for uranium deposits to make [[Nuclear terrorism|nuclear weapons]], and may have tested the efficacy of the synthesised sarin on animals. They remained in Australia for eight days and attempted to return in October of the same year, but were denied visas \u2013 Banjawarn Station would be sold a year later.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n[[File:Overhead_view_of_Satyan_7.png|thumb|Overhead view of the Satyan-7 chemical weapon facility.]]\nThe Satyan-7 facility was declared ready for occupancy by September 1993 with the capacity to produce about 40\u201350 litres of sarin, being equipped with 30L capacity mixing flasks within protective hoods, and eventually employing 100 Aum members; the UN would later estimate the value of the building and its contents at $30 million.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Cult at the End of the World: The Terrifying Story of the Aum Doomsday Cult, from the Subways of Tokyo to the Nuclear Arsenals of Russia|last1=Kaplan|first1=David|last2=Marshall|first2=Andrew|year=1996|publisher=Crown Publishing|isbn=978-0517705438}}</ref>\n\nDespite the safety features and often state-of-the-art equipment and practices, the operation of the facility was very unsafe - one analyst would later describe the cult as having 'a high degree of book learning, but virtually nothing in the way of technical skill'.<ref name=olson>{{cite journal|last1=Olson|first1=Kyle|date=1996|title=Overview: Recent events and responder implications|url=https://biotech.law.lsu.edu/blaw/FEMA/Proceedings.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the Seminar on Responding to the Consequences of Chemical and Biological Terrorism|volume=2|issue=36|pages=2\u201393|access-date=2018-05-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194732/http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/blaw/FEMA/Proceedings.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWhen the facility developed leaks, buckets were used to contain spills; several technicians inhaled fumes on repeated occasions, developing 'symptoms ranging from nosebleeds to convulsions',<ref name=ataxia-chapter3/> and toxic chemicals leaked from the site and into the soil. Citizens lodged complaints about foul smells several times, with the cult claiming that the [[US Army]] had assaulted the complex with poison gas. An accident at the plant in November 1994 would eventually force the suspension of the production of chemical agents.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nBy December, Tsuchiya had accumulated in total about 3&nbsp;kg of sarin \u2013 from this, two separate assassination attempts were made on [[Daisaku Ikeda]], leader of [[Soka Gakkai]] (a rival Japanese religious movement), in mid-1994. The first attack involved a truck with a spraying system, as previously used \u2013 the spraying system malfunctioned, spraying sarin into the truck itself, and mildly poisoning the operators. The second attack utilised a truck modified to include an evaporation system based on heating sarin over a gas stove fire; despite prior warnings from cult member Kazuyoshi Takizawa, the truck caught fire during the dissemination, severely poisoning the driver Tomomitsu Niimi and causing both Niimi and Murai \u2013 the operators \u2013 to flee. Niimi received an injection of [[atropine]] and pralidoximine iodine, saving his life.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nDespite the failure of the attack, the members of Aum were convinced of sarin's efficacy, prompting Asahara to appoint Takizawa in charge of operations of Satyan-7; Tsuchiya was assigned to several other projects and would go on to manufacture several [[psychoactives]] \u2013 [[LSD]], [[Phencyclidine|PCP]], [[methamphetamine]], [[mescaline]], and [[phenobarbital]] to be used in the cult activities and [[brainwashing]]; he would also manufacture small amounts of phosgene, VX, [[soman]], [[cyclosarin]], and gunpowder.

About a week later, on 27 June, 30L of sarin was loaded onto a truck equipped with a fan, heater, and pump \u2013 six members, pre-administered with sarin antidotes and wearing improvised gas masks, began the propagation of sarin at around 10:40pm, spraying for around 10\u201320 minutes.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nDue to it being a warm evening, many residents had left their windows open while they slept \u2013 the first emergency call was made at 11:09pm. Within an hour, a mass disaster caused by an unknown toxic gas had been declared. Fifty-eight people were hospitalised, of whom eight people died, and an additional 253 people sought medical care at outpatient clinics.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n[[File:Description_of_Aum_Shinrikyo_sarin_truck.png|thumb|Depiction of Aum Shinrikyo sarin truck.]]\nInvestigations after the Matsumoto attack were generally inconclusive, with the primary suspect being [[Yoshiyuki K\u014dno (victim)|Yoshiyuki K\u014dno]], whose wife had been left comatose by the attack. Blame would not be clearly attributed to Aum Shinrikyo until after the subway attack, despite tipoffs \u2013 in September 1994, two anonymous letters were sent to major media outlets in Japan \u2013 the first asserting that the group were responsible for the attack, and the second claiming that Matsumoto was an open-air 'experiment of sorts', noting that the results would have been much worse if sarin had been released indoors, such as in 'a crowded subway'.<ref name=ataxia-chapter3/>\n\nFollowing an accident at Satyan-7 the next month (and complaints from the surrounding communities), a police investigation revealed [[methylphosphonic acid]] and isopropyl methylphosphonic acid \u2013 the former being a degradation product of sarin, and the latter being a definitive signature of both sarin production and of failures in production. However, there was no law at the time prohibiting the production of the nerve agents. This evidence was left unacted on, but was leaked to the [[Yomiuri Shimbun]] in January 1995, alerting Asahara and the cult, and causing Nakagawa and Endo to begin the process of destroying and/or hiding all nerve agents and biological weapons, which lasted until the end of February.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Preparation for the attack===\nFingerprint evidence for an Aum member linked to an earlier kidnapping, in addition to the sarin-contaminated soil samples, caused the police to set a raid date for 22 March. Asahara was made aware of the impending raid by two cult members inside the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Self-Defense Forces]], and ordered an attack on Tokyo subway lines close to the Metropolitan Police Department on the morning of the 20th March \u2013 possibly as a desperate attack to initiate the apocalypse.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Holy Terror: Armageddon in Tokyo|last=Brackett|first=D.

Later forensic analysis found that the sarin utilised in the attack was roughly half as pure as that used in the Matsumoto attack.\n\n==Attack==\nOn Monday, 20 March 1995, five members of [[Aum Shinrikyo]] launched a chemical attack on the [[Tokyo subway]] (on lines that are part of the present-day [[Tokyo Metro]]), one of the world's busiest commuter transport systems, at the peak of the morning [[rush hour]]. The chemical agent used, liquid [[sarin]], was contained in plastic bags which each team then wrapped in newspaper. Each perpetrator carried two packets totaling approximately {{convert|0.9|liter|floz}} of sarin, except Yasuo Hayashi, who carried three bags totalling approximately {{convert|1.3|liter|floz}} of sarin. Aum originally planned to spread the sarin as an aerosol but did not follow through with it.

Hayashi was the perpetrator and Niimi was his getaway driver. On the way to [[Sendagi Station]], Niimi purchased newspapers to wrap the sarin packets in\u2014the [[Japan Communist Party]]'s ''[[Akahata]]'' and the [[S\u014dka Gakkai International|S\u014dka Gakkai]]'s ''[[Seikyo Shimbun]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nHayashi eventually chose to use ''Akahata''. Wearing a [[surgical mask]] commonly worn by the Japanese during cold and flu season, Hayashi boarded the first car of southwest-bound 07:48 Chiyoda Line train number A725K. As the train approached [[Shin-Ochanomizu Station]], the central business district in [[Chiyoda, Tokyo|Chiyoda]], he punctured one of his two bags of sarin, leaving the other untouched, and exited the train at Shin-Ochanomizu.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe train proceeded down the line with the punctured bag of sarin leaking until 4 stops later at [[Kasumigaseki Station (Tokyo)|Kasumigaseki Station]]. There, the bags were removed and eventually disposed of by station attendants, of whom two died. The train continued on to the next station where it was completely stopped, evacuated and cleaned.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Marunouchi Line===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\n\n====Ogikubo-bound====\n[[File:Marunouchi-ogi map sarin attack.png|thumb|300px|left|Detailed map of the attack on the [[Ogikubo Station|Ogikubo]]-bound [[Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line|Marunouchi Line]] train.]]\nTwo men, Ken'ichi Hirose and Koichi Kitamura, were assigned to release two sarin packets on the westbound [[Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line|Marunouchi Line]] destined for [[Ogikubo Station]]. The pair left Aum headquarters in [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] at 6:00&nbsp;am and drove to [[Yotsuya Station]]. There Hirose boarded a westbound Marunouchi Line train, then changed to a northbound [[East Japan Railway Company|JR East]] [[Saiky\u014d Line]] train at [[Shinjuku Station]] and got off at [[Ikebukuro Station]]. He then bought a sports tabloid to wrap the sarin packets in and boarded the second car of Marunouchi Line train A777.\n\nAs he was about to release the sarin, Hirose believed the loud noises caused by the newspaper-wrapped packets had caught the attention of a [[student|schoolgirl]]. To avoid further suspicion, he got off the train at either [[Myogadani Station|Myogadani]] or [[Korakuen Station]] and moved to the third car instead of the second.\n\nAs the train approached [[Ochanomizu Station]], Hirose dropped the newspapers to the floor, repeated an Aum mantra and punctured both sarin packets with so much force that he bent the tip of his sharpened umbrella. Both packets were successfully broken, and all {{convert|900|ml|floz}} of sarin was released onto the floor of the train. Hirose then departed the train at Ochanomizu and left via Kitamura's car waiting outside the station. Hirose's clumsy release of the sarin resulted in him accidentally poisoning himself, but he was able to administer an antidote stored in Kitamura's car.\n\nAt [[Nakano-sakaue Station]], 14 stops later, two severely injured passengers were carried out of the train car, while station attendant Sumio Nishimura removed the sarin packets (one of these two passengers was the only fatality from this attack). The train continued with sarin still on the floor of the third car. Five stops later, at 8:38&nbsp;am, the train reached [[Ogikubo Station]], the end of the [[Marunouchi Line]], all while passengers continued to board the train. The train continued eastbound until it was finally taken out of service at [[Shin-K\u014denji Station]] two stops later. The entire ordeal resulted in one passenger's death with 358 being seriously injured.\n\n====Ikebukuro-bound====\n[[File:Marunouchi-ike map sarin attack.png|thumb|300px|right|Detailed map of the attack on the [[Ikebukuro Station|Ikebukuro]]-bound [[Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line|Marunouchi Line]] train.]]\nMasato Yokoyama and his driver Kiyotaka Tonozaki were assigned to release sarin on the [[Ikebukuro Station|Ikebukuro]]-bound Marunouchi Line. On the way to [[Shinjuku Station]], Tonozaki stopped to allow Yokoyama to buy a copy of ''[[Nihon Keizai Shimbun]]'', to wrap the two sarin packets. When they arrived at the station, Yokoyama put on a wig and fake glasses and boarded the fifth car of the Ikebukuro-bound 07:39 Marunouchi Line train number B801. As the train approached [[Yotsuya Station]], Yokoyama began poking at the sarin packets. When the train reached the next station, he fled the scene with Tonozaki, leaving the sarin packets on the train car. The packets were not fully punctured. During his drop, Yokoyama left one packet fully intact, while the other packet was only punctured once (and with a small hole), resulting in the sarin being released relatively slowly.\n\nThe train reached the end of the line, Ikebukuro, at 8:30&nbsp;am where it would head back in the opposite direction. Before it departed the train was evacuated and searched, but the searchers failed to discover the sarin packets. The train departed Ikebukuro Station at 8:32&nbsp;am as the Shinjuku-bound A801. Passengers soon became ill and alerted station attendants of the sarin-soaked newspapers at [[K\u014drakuen Station]]. One station later, at [[Hong\u014d-sanch\u014dme Station|Hong\u014d-sanch\u014dme]], staff removed the sarin packets and mopped the floor, but the train continued on to Shinjuku. After arriving at 9:09&nbsp;am, the train once again began to make its way back to Ikebukuro as the B901. The train was finally put out of service at [[Kokkai-gijid\u014d-mae Station]] in Chiyoda at 9:27&nbsp;am, one hour and forty minutes after Yokoyama punctured the sarin packet. The attack resulted in no fatalities, but over 200 people were left in serious condition.\n\n===Hibiya Line===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\n\n====T\u014dbu D\u014dbutsu K\u014den-bound====\n[[File:HibiyaLine ne bound sarin attack.png|thumb|left|Detailed map of the attack on the [[T\u014dbu D\u014dbutsu K\u014den Station|T\u014dbu D\u014dbutsu K\u014den]]-bound [[Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line|Hibiya Line]] train.]]\nToru Toyoda and his driver Katsuya Takahashi were assigned to release sarin on the northeast-bound [[Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line|Hibiya Line]].\n\nThe pair, with Takahashi driving, left Aum headquarters in Shibuya at 6:30&nbsp;am. After purchasing a copy of ''[[Hochi Shimbun]]'' and wrapping his two sarin packets, Toyoda arrived at [[Naka-Meguro Station]] where he boarded the first car of northeast-bound 07:59 Hibiya Line train number B711T. Sitting close to the door, he set the sarin packets on the floor. When the train arrived at the next station, [[Ebisu Station (Tokyo)|Ebisu]], Toyoda punctured both packets and got off the train. He was on the train for a total of two minutes, by far the quickest sarin drop out of the five attacks that day.\n\nTwo stops later, at [[Roppongi Station]], passengers in the train's first car began to feel the effects of the sarin and began to open the windows. By [[Kamiyacho Station]], the next stop, the passengers in the car had begun panicking. The first car was evacuated and several passengers were immediately taken to a hospital. Still, with the first car empty, the train continued down the line for one more stop until it was completely evacuated at [[Kasumigaseki Station (Tokyo)|Kasumigaseki Station]]. This attack killed one person and seriously injured 532 others.\n\n====Naka-Meguro-bound====\n[[File:HibiyaLine se bound sarin attack.png|thumb|Detailed map of the attack on the [[Naka-Meguro Station|Naka-Meguro]]-bound [[Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line|Hibiya Line]] train.]]\nYasuo Hayashi and Shigeo Sugimoto were the team assigned to drop sarin on the southwest-bound Hibiya Line departing [[Kita-Senju Station]] for [[Naka-Meguro Station]]. Unlike the rest of the attackers, Hayashi carried three sarin packets onto the train instead of two. Prior to the attack, Hayashi asked to carry a flawed leftover packet in addition to the two others in an apparent bid to allay suspicions and prove his loyalty to the group.\n\nAfter Sugimoto escorted him to [[Ueno Station]], Hayashi boarded the third car of southwest-bound 07:43 Hibiya Line train number A720S and dropped his sarin packets to the floor. Two stops later, at [[Akihabara Station]], he punctured two of the three packets, left the train, and arrived back at Aum headquarters with Sugimoto by 8:30&nbsp;am. Hayashi made the most punctures of any of the perpetrators. By the next stop, passengers in the third car began to feel the effects of the sarin. Noticing the large, liquid-soaked package on the floor and assuming it was the culprit, one passenger kicked the sarin packets out of the train and onto [[Kodenmach\u014d Station]]'s subway platform. Four people in the station died as a result.\n\nA puddle of sarin remained on the floor of the passenger car as the train continued to the next station. At 8:10&nbsp;am, after the train pulled out of [[Hatch\u014dbori Station (Tokyo)|Hatch\u014dbori Station]], a passenger in the third car pressed the emergency stop button. The train was in a tunnel at the time, and was forced to proceed to [[Tsukiji Station]], where passengers stumbled out and collapsed on the station's platform and the train was taken out of service.\n\nThe attack was originally believed to be an explosion and was thus labeled as such in media reports. Eventually, station attendants realized that the attack was not an explosion, but rather a chemical attack. At 8:35&nbsp;am, the Hibiya Line was completely shut down and all commuters were evacuated. Between the five stations affected in this attack, 8 people died and 275 were seriously injured.\n\n==Main perpetrators==\nTen men were responsible for carrying out the attacks: five released the sarin, while the other five served as [[Crime scene getaway|getaway drivers]].\n\nThe teams were:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Several of those affected by sarin went to work in spite of their symptoms,<ref name=\"auto1\"/> not realizing that they had been exposed to sarin.

Dr. Nobuo Yanagisawa had experience with treating sarin poisoning after the [[Matsumoto incident]]; he recognized the symptoms, had information on diagnosis and treatment collected, and led a team who sent the information to hospitals throughout Tokyo via fax.\n\n[[St. Luke's International Hospital]] in Tsukiji was one of very few hospitals in Tokyo at that time to have the entire building wired and piped for conversion into a \"field hospital\" in the event of a major disaster. This proved to be a very fortunate coincidence as the hospital was able to take in most of the 600+ victims at Tsukiji Station, resulting in no fatalities at that station.\n\nAs there was a severe shortage of antidotes in Tokyo, sarin antidote stored in rural hospitals as an antidote for herbicide/insecticide poisoning was delivered to nearby [[Shinkansen]] stations, where it was collected by a Ministry of Health official on a train bound for Tokyo.\n\n===Defense offered by Japanese and American scholars===\nAum had carefully cultivated the friendship of Japanese scholars of religion. After the sarin gas attack, some of them, including Shimada Hiromi, a professor at Tokyo's [[Japan Women's University]], suggested Aum may be innocent. Shimada later apologized, claiming he had been deceived by Aum, but his and others' statements damaged the public image of scholars of religion in general in Japan.

The Tokyo High Court postponed its decision on the appeal until results were obtained from a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation, which was issued to determine whether Asahara was fit to stand trial. In February 2006, the court ruled that Asahara was indeed fit to stand trial, and on 27 March 2006, rejected the appeal against his death sentence. Japan's Supreme Court upheld this decision on 15 September 2006. Two re-trial appeals were declined by the appellate court. In June 2012, Asahara's execution was postponed due to the further arrests of the two remaining Aum Shinrikyo members wanted in connection with the attack.

Every two months I had glandular fever. So for the next 18 months I was living on ten dollars a week and getting my strength up. But I was still playing.<ref name=\"PP75\" />}}\n\n== Career ==\n=== Early 1960s: session musician ===\nWhile still a student, Page often performed on stage at the [[Marquee Club]] with bands such as [[Cyril Davies]]' [[All-Stars (band)|All Stars]], [[Alexis Korner]]'s [[Blues Incorporated]], and fellow guitarists [[Jeff Beck]] and [[Eric Clapton]]. He was spotted one night by John Gibb of Brian Howard & the Silhouettes, who asked him to help record some singles for [[Columbia Graphophone Company]], including \"The Worrying Kind\". [[Mike Leander]] of [[Decca Records]] first offered Page regular studio work. His first session for the label was the recording \"[[Diamonds (Jerry Lordan song)|Diamonds]]\" by [[Jet Harris]] and [[Tony Meehan]], which went to Number 1 on the singles chart in early 1963.<ref name=\"Schulps\" />\n\nAfter brief stints with [[Carter-Lewis and the Southerners]], [[Mike Hurst (producer)|Mike Hurst]] and the Method and [[Mickey Finn (guitarist)|Mickey Finn and the Blue Men]], Page committed himself to full-time session work. As a session guitarist, he was known as 'Lil' Jim Pea' to prevent confusion with the other noted English session guitarist [[Big Jim Sullivan]]. Page was mainly called into sessions as \"insurance\" in instances when a replacement or second guitarist was required by the recording artist. \"It was usually myself and a drummer\", he explained, \"though they never mention the drummer these days, just me&nbsp;... Anyone needing a guitarist either went to Big Jim [Sullivan] or myself.\"<ref name=\"Schulps\" /> He stated that \"In the initial stages they just said, play what you want, cos at that time I couldn't read music or anything.\"<ref name=DuNoyer>{{cite journal|last=Paul|first=Du Noyer|title=Who the hell does Jimmy Page think he is?|work=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] magazine|issue=August 1988|pages=5\u20137}}</ref>\n\n{{listen|type=music\n| filename = Jimmy Page - She Just Satisfies.ogg\n| title = She Just Satisfies\n| description = Sample of \"She Just Satisfies\", Page's first single (released in 1965).<ref>{{cite book|author=George Case|title=Jimmy Page: Magus, Musician, Man: An Unauthorized Biography|date=1 April 2009|publisher=Backbeat Books|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=N3o3AQAAIAAJ}} |isbn=978-0-87930-947-3 |page=43}}</ref>\n| pos = right\n}}\n\nPage was the favoured session guitarist of record producer [[Shel Talmy]].

He composed and recorded songs for the John Williams (not to be confused with the film composer [[John Williams]]) album ''The Maureeny Wishful Album'' with Big Jim Sullivan. Page worked as session musician on [[Donovan]] Leitch's ''[[Sunshine Superman (album)|Sunshine Superman]]'' and the [[Johnny Hallyday]] albums ''Jeune Homme'' and ''Je Suis N\u00e9 Dans La Rue'', the [[Al Stewart]] album ''[[Love Chronicles]]'' and played guitar on five tracks of [[Joe Cocker]]'s debut album, ''[[With a Little Help from My Friends (Joe Cocker album)|With a Little Help from My Friends]]''. Over the years since 1970, Page played lead guitar on 10 [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]] tracks, comprising 81 minutes of music.\n\nWhen questioned about which songs he played on, especially ones where there exists some controversy as to what his exact role was, Page often points out that it is hard to remember exactly what he did given the enormous number of sessions he was playing at the time.<ref name=\"DuNoyer\"/><ref name=\"tripleJ\" /> In a radio interview he explained that \"I was doing three sessions a day, fifteen sessions a week. Sometimes I would be playing with a group, sometimes I could be doing film music, it could be a folk session&nbsp;... I was able to fit all these different roles.\"<ref name=\"NPRPage\"/>\n\nAlthough Page recorded with many notable musicians, many of these early tracks are only available as [[bootleg recording]]s, several of which were released by the Led Zeppelin fan club in the late 1970s. One of the rarest of these is the early jam session featuring him and Stones guitarist [[Keith Richards]] covering [[Robert Johnson]]'s \"Little Queen of Spades\". Several early tracks were compiled on the twin album release, ''[[Jimmy Page: Session Man]]''. He also recorded with Richards on guitar and vocals in [[Olympic Sound Studios]] on 15 October 1974. Along with [[Ric Grech]] on bass and [[Bruce Rowland]] on drums, a track called \"Scarlet\" was cut. Page reflected later in an interview with ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s [[Cameron Crowe]]: \"I did what could possibly be the next Stones B side. It was Ric Grech, Keith and me doing a number called \"Scarlet.\" I can't remember the drummer. It sounded very similar in style and mood to those ''Blonde on Blonde'' tracks. It was great, really good. We stayed up all night and went down to Island Studios where Keith put some reggae guitars over one section. I just put some solos on it, but it was eight in the morning of the next day before I did that. He took the tapes to Switzerland and someone found out about them. Keith told people that it was a track from my album\".<ref name=\"PP75\" />\n\nPage left studio work when the increasing influence of [[Stax Records]] on popular music led to the greater incorporation of brass and orchestral arrangements into recordings at the expense of guitars.<ref name=\"JPinterview\" /> He stated that his time as a session player served as extremely good schooling:\n{{quote|My session work was invaluable. At one point I was playing at least three sessions a day, six days a week! And I rarely ever knew in advance what I was going to be playing. But I learned things even on my worst sessions \u2013 and believe me, I played on some horrendous things. I finally called it quits after I started getting calls to do [[Elevator music|Muzak]]. I decided I couldn't live that life any more; it was getting too silly. I guess it was destiny that a week after I quit doing sessions Paul Samwell-Smith left the Yardbirds and I was able to take his place.

The experience gave Page an idea to form a new [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] featuring Beck, along with [[The Who]]'s [[John Entwistle]] on bass and Moon on drums.<ref name=\"Schulps\" /> However, the lack of a quality vocalist and contractual problems prevented the project from getting off the ground. During this time, Moon suggested the name \"Lead [[Zeppelin]]\" for the first time, after Entwistle commented that the proceedings would take to the air like a lead balloon.\n\nWithin weeks, Page attended a Yardbirds concert at [[Oxford]]. After the show, he went backstage where [[Paul Samwell-Smith]] announced that he was leaving the group.<ref name=\"JPinterview\" /> Page offered to replace Samwell-Smith, and this was accepted by the group. He initially played electric bass with the Yardbirds before finally switching to twin lead guitar with Beck when [[Chris Dreja]] moved to bass. The musical potential of the line-up was scuttled, however, by interpersonal conflicts caused by constant touring and a lack of commercial success, although they released one single, \"[[Happenings Ten Years Time Ago]]\". While Page and Beck played together in the Yardbirds, the trio of Page, Beck and Clapton never played in the original group at the same time. The three guitarists did appear on stage together at the [[ARMS Charity Concert]]s in 1983.\n\nAfter Beck's departure, the Yardbirds remained a quartet. They recorded one album with Page on lead guitar, ''[[Little Games]]''. The album received indifferent reviews and was not a commercial success, peaking at number 80 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Though their studio sound was fairly commercial at the time, the band's live performances were just the opposite, becoming heavier and more experimental. These concerts featured musical aspects that Page would later perfect with Led Zeppelin, most notably performances of \"[[Dazed and Confused (song)#Led Zeppelin live performances|Dazed and Confused]]\".\n\nAfter the departure of [[Keith Relf]] and [[Jim McCarty]] in 1968, Page reconfigured the group with a new line-up to fulfil unfinished tour dates in Scandinavia. To this end, Page recruited vocalist [[Robert Plant]] and drummer [[John Bonham]], and he was also contacted by [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], who asked to join.<ref name=\"Miserandino\">{{cite web|url=http://thecelebritycafe.com/interviews/john_paul_jones.html|title=Led Zeppelin : John talks about his musical career with Led Zeppelin, before and after|first=Dominick A.|last=Miserandino|work=TheCelebrityCafe.com|date=29 November 2000|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> During the [[Led Zeppelin Scandinavian Tour 1968|Scandinavian tour]], the new group appeared as the New Yardbirds, but soon recalled the old joke by Keith Moon and John Entwistle.

Various sources estimate the group's worldwide sales at more than 200 or even 300 million albums. With 111.5 million RIAA-certified units, they are the second-best-selling band in the United States. Each of their nine studio albums reached the top 10 of the US Billboard album chart, and six reached the number-one spot.\n\nLed Zeppelin were the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock, and their sound was largely the product of Page's input as a producer and musician. The band's individualistic style drew from a wide variety of influences. They performed on multiple record-breaking concert tours, which also earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s, the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties of the members.\n\nPage explained that he had a very specific idea in mind as to what he wanted Led Zeppelin to be, from the very beginning:\n{{quote|I had a lot of ideas from my days with the Yardbirds. The Yardbirds allowed me to improvise a lot in live performance and I started building a textbook of ideas that I eventually used in Zeppelin. In addition to those ideas, I wanted to add acoustic textures. Ultimately, I wanted Zeppelin to be a marriage of blues, hard rock and acoustic music topped with heavy choruses \u2013 a combination that had never been done before. Lots of light and shade in the music.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />}}\n\n=== Post-Led Zeppelin career ===\nLed Zeppelin broke up in 1980 following the death of Bonham at Page's home. Page initially refused to touch a guitar, grieving for his friend.<ref name=\"DuNoyer\"/><ref name=\"uncutinterview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/features/john-paul-jones-on-jimmy-page-37701|first=David|last=Cavanagh|title=John Paul Jones on Jimmy Page|work=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|date=29 December 2008|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> For the rest of the 1980s, his work consisted of a series of short-term collaborations in the bands [[The Firm (rock band)|the Firm]], [[the Honeydrippers]], reunions and individual work, including film soundtracks. He also became active in philanthropic work.\n\n===1980s===\n[[File:Jimmy Page 1983.jpg|thumb|upright|Page in 1983]]\n\nPage made a return to the stage at a Jeff Beck show in March 1981 at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]].{{sfn|Case|2007|p=164}} Also in 1981, Page joined with [[Yes (band)|Yes]] bassist [[Chris Squire]] and drummer [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]] to form a supergroup called [[XYZ (UK band)|XYZ]] (for former Yes-Zeppelin). They rehearsed several times, but the project was shelved. Bootlegs of these sessions revealed that some of the material emerged on later projects, notably The Firm's \"Fortune Hunter\" and Yes songs \"Mind Drive\" and \"Can You Imagine?\". Page joined Yes on stage in 1984 at [[Westfalenhalle]] in [[Dortmund]], Germany, playing \"[[I'm Down]]\".\n\nIn 1982, Page collaborated with director [[Michael Winner]] to record the ''[[Death Wish II (album)|Death Wish II]]'' soundtrack. This and several subsequent Page recordings, including the ''[[Death Wish III]]'' soundtrack, were recorded and produced at his recording studio, [[Sol Studios|The Sol]] in [[Cookham]], which he had purchased from [[Gus Dudgeon]] in the early 1980s.\n\n[[File:Jimmy Page - A.R.M.S. Concert, Oakland, Ca. 1983.jpg|thumb|left|Page at an A.R.M.S. concert in 1983]]\n\nIn 1983, Page appeared with the A.R.M.S. (Action Research for [[Multiple Sclerosis]]) charity series of concerts which honoured [[Small Faces]] bassist [[Ronnie Lane]], who suffered from the disease. For the first shows at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, Page's set consisted of songs from the ''Death Wish II'' soundtrack (with [[Steve Winwood]] on vocals) and an instrumental version of \"Stairway to Heaven\". A four-city tour of the United States followed, with [[Paul Rodgers]] of [[Bad Company]] replacing Winwood. During the tour, Page and Rodgers performed \"Midnight Moonlight\", which would later appear on The Firm's first album. All of the shows featured an on stage jam of \"[[Layla]]\" that reunited Page with Beck and Clapton. According to the book ''[[Hammer of the Gods (book)|Hammer of the Gods]]'', it was reportedly around this time that Page told friends that he had just ended seven years of heroin use. On 13 December 1983, Page joined Plant on stage for one encore at the Hammersmith Odeon in London.\n\nPage next linked up with [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]] for the 1984 album ''[[Whatever Happened to Jugula?]]'' and occasional concerts, performing a predominantly acoustic set at folk festivals under various guises such as the MacGregors and Themselves. Also in 1984, Page recorded with Plant as the Honeydrippers the album ''[[The Honeydrippers: Volume 1]]'' and with [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] on the film soundtrack ''[[Scream for Help (album)|Scream for Help]]''.\n\nPage subsequently collaborated with Rodgers on two albums under the name [[The Firm (rock band)|The Firm]]. The first album, released in 1985, was the self-titled ''[[The Firm (album)|The Firm]]''. Popular songs included \"[[Radioactive (The Firm song)|Radioactive]]\" and \"Satisfaction Guaranteed\". The album peaked at number 17 on the ''Billboard'' pop albums chart and went gold in the US. It was followed by ''[[Mean Business]]'' in 1986. The band toured in support of both albums, but soon split up.\n\nVarious other projects followed, such as session work for [[Graham Nash]], [[Stephen Stills]] and the Rolling Stones (on their 1986 single \"[[One Hit (to the Body)]]\"). In 1986, Page reunited temporarily with his former Yardbirds bandmates to play on several tracks of the [[Box of Frogs]] album ''Strange Land''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3534576.stm|title=Zeppelin defend Live Aid opt out|work=BBC News|date=4 August 2004|accessdate=11 September 2010}}</ref> Page released a solo album entitled ''[[Outrider (album)|Outrider]]'' in 1988, which featured contributions from Plant, with Page contributing in turn to Plant's solo album ''[[Now and Zen]]'', which was released the same year. ''Outrider'' also featured singer John Miles on the album's opening track \"Wasting My Time\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classicrockhistory.com/why-wasting-my-time-was-jimmy-pages-best-post-led-zeppelin-song/|title=Why \"Wasting My Time,\" Was Jimmy Page's Best Post Led Zeppelin Song|last=Roberts|first=Janey|date=7 August 2017|website=ClassicRockHistory.com|accessdate=10 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nThroughout these years, Page also reunited with the other former bandmates of Led Zeppelin to perform live on a few occasions, most notably in 1985 for the [[Live Aid]] concert with both [[Phil Collins]] and [[Tony Thompson (drummer)|Tony Thompson]] filling drum duties. However, the band members considered this performance to be sub-standard, with Page having been let down by a poorly tuned Les Paul. Page, Plant and Jones, as well as John Bonham's son [[Jason Bonham|Jason]], performed at the [[Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary]] show on 14 May 1988, closing the 12-hour show.{{sfn|Lewis|Pallett|2005|p=139}}\n\n===1990s===\nIn 1990, a [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]] concert to aid the Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy Centre and the British School for Performing Arts and Technology saw Plant unexpectedly joined by Page to perform \"[[Misty Mountain Hop]]\", \"[[Wearing and Tearing]]\" and \"[[Rock and Roll (Led Zeppelin song)|Rock and Roll]]\". The same year, Page appeared with [[Aerosmith]] at the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival. Page also performed with the band's former members at Jason Bonham's wedding. Page also embarked on a collaboration with [[David Coverdale]] in 1993 entitled [[Coverdale Page]].\n\nIn 1994, Page reunited with Plant for the penultimate performance in MTV's \"[[MTV Unplugged|Unplugged]]\" series. The 90-minute special, dubbed ''Unledded'', premiered to the highest ratings in MTV's history. In October of the same year, the session was released as the CD ''[[No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded]]'' and in 2004 as the DVD ''[[No Quarter Unledded]]''. Following a highly successful mid-1990s tour to support ''No Quarter'', Page and Plant recorded 1998's ''[[Walking into Clarksdale]]'', along with drummer [[Michael Lee (musician)|Michael Lee]].\n\nPage was heavily involved in [[remaster]]ing the Led Zeppelin catalogue. He participated in various charity concerts and charity work, particularly the ''Action for Brazil's Children Trust'' (ABC Trust), founded by his wife Jimena Gomez-Paratcha in 1998. In the same year, Page played guitar for [[Hip hop music|rap]] singer/producer [[Puff Daddy]]'s song \"[[Come with Me (Puff Daddy & Jimmy Page song)|Come with Me]]\", which heavily samples Led Zeppelin's \"[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]\" and was included in the soundtrack of ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]''. The two later performed the song on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.\n\nIn October 1999, Page teamed up with [[The Black Crowes]] for a two-night performance of material from the Led Zeppelin catalogue and old blues and rock standards. The concert was recorded and released as a [[double album|double live album]], ''[[Live at the Greek]]'' in 2000. In 2001, he made an appearance on stage with [[Limp Bizkit]] frontman [[Fred Durst]] and [[Wes Scantlin]] of [[Puddle of Mudd]] at the MTV Europe Video Music Awards in [[Frankfurt]], where they performed a version of Led Zeppelin's \"[[Thank You (Led Zeppelin song)|Thank You]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12051457|title=Led Zep's Page Joins Limp Bizkit's Durst And Puddle of Mudd's Scantlin On Stage|accessdate=17 February 2007|date=11 October 2001|publisher=Yahoo|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616141509/http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12051457|archivedate=16 June 2007}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:JimmyPage.jpg|thumb|upright|Jimmy Page performing at the Led Zeppelin reunion concert at [[the O2 Arena]] in London in 2007]]\n\nIn 2005, Page was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in recognition of his Brazilian charity work for Task Brazil and Action For Brazil's Children's Trust,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2005/12/14/page-obe.html|title=Jimmy Page given OBE for charity work|accessdate=6 January 2007|date=14 December 2005|work=CBC.ca Arts|publisher=CBC|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312030202/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2005/12/14/page-obe.html|archivedate=12 March 2007}}</ref> made an honorary citizen of [[Rio de Janeiro]] later that year and was awarded a Grammy Award.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4271212.stm|title=Zeppelin's Page made Rio citizen|accessdate=6 January 2007|date=22 September 2006|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2006, Led Zeppelin was inducted into the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]].

I started to learn microphone placements and things like that, what did and what didn't work. I certainly knew what did and didn't work with drummers because they put drummers in these little sound booths that had no sound deflection at all and the drums would just sound awful. The reality of it is the drum is a musical instrument, it relies on having a bright room and a live room&nbsp;... And so bit by bit I was learning really how ''not'' to record.<ref name=\"NPRPage\"/></blockquote>\n\nHe developed a reputation for employing effects in new ways and trying out different methods of using microphones and amplification. During the late 1960s, most British music producers placed [[microphone]]s directly in front of [[amplifier]]s and drums, resulting in the sometimes \"tinny\" sound of the recordings of the era. Page commented to ''Guitar World'' magazine that he felt the drum sounds of the day in particular \"sounded like cardboard boxes.\"<ref name=\"guiwo\" /> Instead, Page was a fan of 1950s recording techniques, [[Sun Studio]] being a particular favourite. In the same ''Guitar World'' interview, Page remarked: \"Recording used to be a science\" and \"[engineers] used to have a maxim: distance equals depth.\" Taking this maxim to heart, Page developed the idea of placing an additional microphone some distance from the amplifier (as much as twenty feet) and then recording the balance between the two. By adopting this technique, Page became one of the first British producers to record a band's \"ambient sound\" \u2013 the distance of a note's time-lag from one end of the room to the other.<ref name=\"RS2006\"/>\n\nFor the recording of several Led Zeppelin tracks, such as \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\" and \"[[You Shook Me]]\", Page additionally utilised \"[[reverse echo]]\" \u2013 a technique which he claims to have invented himself while with the Yardbirds (he had originally developed the method when recording the 1967 single \"[[Ten Little Indians (Harry Nilsson song)|Ten Little Indians]]\").<ref name=\"guiwo\"/> This production technique involved hearing the echo before the main sound instead of after it, achieved by turning the tape over and employing the echo on a spare track, then turning the tape back over again to get the echo preceding the signal.\n\nPage has stated that, as producer, he deliberately changed the [[audio engineer]]s on Led Zeppelin albums, from [[Glyn Johns]] for the first album, to [[Eddie Kramer]] for ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'', to [[Andy Johns]] for ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]'' and later albums. He explained: \"I consciously kept changing engineers because I didn't want people to think that they were responsible for our sound. I wanted people to know it was me.\"<ref name=\"guiwo\" />\n\nJohn Paul Jones acknowledged that Page's production techniques were a key component of the success of Led Zeppelin:\n\n{{quote|The backwards echo stuff [and] a lot of the microphone techniques were just inspired. Using distance-miking&nbsp;... and small amplifiers. Everybody thinks we go in the studio with huge walls of amplifiers, but Page doesn't. He uses a really small amplifier and he just mikes it up really well, so that it fits into a sonic picture.<ref name=\"uncutinterview\"/>}}\n\nIn an interview that Page himself gave to ''Guitar World'' magazine in 1993, he remarked on his work as a producer:\n\n{{quote|Many people think of me as just a riff guitarist, but I think of myself in broader terms&nbsp;... As a record producer I would like to be remembered as someone who was able to sustain a band of unquestionable individual talent and push it to the forefront during its working career. I think I really captured the best of our output, growth, change and maturity on tape \u2013 the multifaceted gem that is Led Zeppelin.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />}}\n\n==Personal life==\n===Partners===\nAn early 1960s companion was American recording artist [[Jackie DeShannon]], possibly the inspiration for the Page composition and Led Zeppelin recording \"Tangerine\".{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=44}}\n\nFrench model Charlotte Martin was Page's partner from 1970 to about 1982 or 1983. Page called her \"My Lady\". Together they had a daughter, [[Scarlet Page]] (born in 1971), who is a photographer.\n\nAlso during the 1970s, Page had a well-documented, several-year-long relationship with \"baby groupie\" [[Lori Mattix]] (also known as Lori Maddox), beginning when she was 13 or 14 and while he was an adult in his twenties.

In an interview with ''[[Guitar World]]'' magazine in 2003, he stated: \"I can't speak for the [other members of the band], but for me drugs were an integral part of the whole thing, right from the beginning, right to the end.\"<ref>Tolinski, Brad. \"The Greatest Show on Earth\", ''Guitar World'', July 2003; re-published in ''Guitar Legends Magazine'', Winter 2004, p. 72.</ref> After the band's 1973 [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1973|North American tour]], Page told [[Nick Kent]]: \"Oh, everyone went over the top a few times.

He later said that following this discovery, he thought: \"Yes, that's it. My thing: I've found it.\"{{sfn|Salewicz|2018|p=33}}\n\nThe appearance of four symbols on the jacket of Led Zeppelin's [[Led Zeppelin IV|fourth album]] has been linked to Page's interest in the occult.<ref name=\"GW2008\">''Jimmy Page interview'', ''Guitar World'', January 2008.</ref> The four symbols represented each member of the band. Page's own so-called \"Zoso\" symbol originated in ''Ars Magica Arteficii'' (1557) by [[Gerolamo Cardano]], an old alchemical [[grimoire]], where it has been identified as a [[sigil (magic)|sigil]] consisting of zodiac signs. The sigil is reproduced in ''Dictionary of Occult, Hermetic and Alchemical Sigils'' by Fred Gettings.{{sfn|Gettings|1981|p=201}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inthelight.co.nz/ledzep/zososymbol.htm|title=Jimmy Page's symbol|date=17 September 2009|accessdate=4 December 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222124002/http://www.inthelight.co.nz/ledzep/zososymbol.htm|archivedate=22 February 2012}}\n</ref>\n\nDuring tours and performances after the release of the fourth album, Page often had the \"Zoso\" symbol embroidered on his clothes, along with [[zodiac]] symbols. These were visible most notably on his \"Dragon Suit\", which included the signs for Capricorn, Scorpio and Cancer which are Page's Sun, Ascendant and Moon signs, respectively.\n\nThe artwork inside the album cover of ''Led Zeppelin IV'' is from a painting attributed to the artist Barrington Colby, influenced by the traditional Rider/Waite Tarot card design for the card called \"The Hermit\". Very little is known about Colby and rumours have persisted down the years that Page himself is responsible for the painting.<ref name=\"GW2008\" /> Page transforms into this character during his fantasy sequence in Led Zeppelin's concert film ''The Song Remains the Same''.\n\nIn the early 1970s Page owned an occult bookshop and publishing house, The Equinox Booksellers and Publishers, at 4 [[Holland Street, Kensington|Holland Street]] in [[Kensington]], London, named after Crowley's biannual magazine, ''[[The Equinox]]''.{{sfn|Salewicz|2018|p=289}} The design of the interior incorporated Egyptian and Art Deco motifs, with Crowley's birth chart affixed to a wall. Page's reasons for setting up the bookshop were straightforward:\n<blockquote>There was not one bookshop in London with a good collection of occult books and I was so pissed off at not being able to get the books I wanted.{{sfn|Salewicz|2018|p=289}}</blockquote>\n\nThe company published two books: a facsimile of Crowley's 1904 edition of ''[[The Goetia]]''<ref name=\"Tolinski2012\">{{cite book|author=Brad Tolinski|title=Light and Shade: Conversations with Jimmy Page|year=2012|publisher=Virgin|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=6gzUbV5AJQYC}}|isbn=978-0-7535-4039-8|page=183}}</ref> and ''Astrology, A Cosmic Science'' by Isabel Hickey.{{sfn|Salewicz|2018|p=290}} The lease eventually expired on the premises and was not renewed. As Page said: \"It obviously wasn't going to run the way it should without some drastic business changes, and I didn't really want to have to agree to all that. I basically just wanted the shop to be the nucleus, that's all.\"{{sfn|Salewicz|2018|p=410}}\n\nPage has maintained a strong interest in Crowley for many years. In 1978, he explained:\n\n{{quote|I feel Aleister Crowley is a misunderstood genius of the 20th century. It is because his whole thing was liberation of the person, of the entity and that restrictions would foul you up, lead to frustration which leads to violence, crime, mental breakdown, depending on what sort of makeup you have underneath. The further this age we're in now gets into technology and alienation, a lot of the points he's made seem to manifest themselves all down the line. ... I'm not saying it's a system for anybody to follow. I don't agree with everything but I find a lot of it relevant and it's those things that people attacked him on, so he was misunderstood. ... I'm not trying to interest anyone in Aleister Crowley any more than I am in Charles Dickens. All it was, was that at a particular time he was expounding a theory of self-liberation, which is something which is so important. He was like an eye to the world, into the forthcoming situation. My studies have been quite intensive, but I don't particularly want to go into it because it's a personal thing and isn't in relation to anything apart from the fact that I've employed his system in my own day to day life. ... The thing is to come to terms with one's free will, discover one's place and what one is, and from that you can go ahead and do it and not spend your whole life suppressed and frustrated. It's very basically coming to terms with yourself.<ref>''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', 13&nbsp;March 1978.</ref>}}\n\nPage was commissioned to write the soundtrack music for the film ''[[Lucifer Rising (film)|Lucifer Rising]]'' by Crowley admirer and underground movie director [[Kenneth Anger]]. Page ultimately produced 23 minutes of music, which Anger felt was insufficient because the film ran for 28 minutes and Anger wanted the film to have a full soundtrack. Anger claimed Page took three years to deliver the music and the final product was only 23 minutes of \"droning\". The director also slammed the guitarist in the press by calling him a \"dabbler\" in the occult and an addict and being too strung out on drugs to complete the project. Page countered that he had fulfilled all his obligations, even going so far as to lend Anger his own film editing equipment to help him finish the project.<ref name=\"GW2006\">''The Story Behind The Lost Lucifer Rising Soundtrack'', ''[[Guitar World]]'', October 2006.</ref> Page released the Lucifer Rising music on vinyl in 2012 via his website on \"Lucifer Rising and other sound tracks\". Side one contained \"Lucifer Rising \u2013 Main Track\", whilst side two contained the tracks \"Incubus\", \"Damask\", \"Unharmonics\", \"Damask \u2013 Ambient\", and \"Lucifer Rising  \u2013 Percussive Return\". In the December 2012 Rolling Stone cover story \"Jimmy Page Looks Back\", Page said: \"... there was a request, suggesting that Lucifer Rising should come out again with my music on. I ignored it.\"\n\nAlthough Page collected works by Crowley, he has never described himself as a [[Thelemite]] nor was he ever initiated into the [[Typhonian Order|OTO]]. The Equinox Bookstore and Boleskine House were both sold off during the 1980s, as Page settled into family life and participated in charity work.\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Jimmy Page discography}}\n\nEarly in his career, Page played on a number of recordings by British rock and pop artists as a session guitarist. As a member of the Yardbirds, he recorded ''[[Little Games]]'' (1967) (expanded in 1992 as ''Little Games Sessions & More''), ''[[Live Yardbirds: Featuring Jimmy Page|Live Yardbirds! Featuring Jimmy Page]]'' (1971), and ''[[Cumular Limit]]'' (2000). Beginning in 1968, he recorded nine albums with Led Zeppelin (see [[Led Zeppelin discography]] for the complete list). After Zeppelin, Page has recorded in several different settings. One of the first is the soundtrack album ''[[Death Wish II (album)|Death Wish II]]'' (1982). As a member of the Firm, he recorded ''[[The Firm (album)|The Firm]]'' (1985) and ''[[Mean Business]]'' (1986). Collaborations followed, including ''[[Whatever Happened to Jugula?]]'' (1985) with Roy Harper, ''[[Coverdale\u2022Page (album)|Coverdale\u2022Page]]'' (1993), ''[[Walking into Clarksdale]]'' (1998) with Robert Plant, and ''[[Live at the Greek]]'' (2000) with the Black Crowes. His only solo album, ''[[Outrider (album)|Outrider]]'', was released in 1988. As a guest performer, he has contributed to several albums and singles.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Bacon|first1=Tony|last2=Burrluck|first2=Dave|last3=Day|first3=Paul|last4=Wright|first4=Michael|year=2000|title=Electric Guitars: The Illustrated Encyclopedia|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=ZSIUAQAAIAAJ}}|location=San Diego, CA|publisher=Thunder Bay Press|isbn=978-1-57145-281-8|ref=CITEREFBacon2000}}\n* {{cite book|last=Cole|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Cole|year=1992|title=Stairway to Heaven: Led Zeppelin Uncensored|location=New York City|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=fUxrSOrrzM8C}}|isbn=978-0-06-018323-3|ref=CITEREFCole1992}}\n* {{cite book|last=Case|first=George|year=2007|title=Jimmy Page: Magus, Musician, Man: An Unauthorized Biography|edition=1st|location=New York|publisher=Hal Leonard|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=OsbuBD3mkkkC}}|isbn=1-4234-0407-6|ref=CITEREFCase2007}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Chipkin|first1=Kenn|last2=Stang|first2=Aaron|year=2003|title=Real Rock Guitar: A Classic Rock Bible of the '60s and '70s|location=Miami, FL|publisher=Warner Bros.

[[Mike Leander]] of [[Decca Records]] first offered Page regular studio work.

He composed and recorded songs for the John Williams (not to be confused with the film composer [[John Williams]]) album ''The Maureeny Wishful Album'' with Big Jim Sullivan. Page worked as session musician on [[Donovan]] Leitch's ''[[Sunshine Superman (album)|Sunshine Superman]]'' and the [[Johnny Hallyday]] albums ''Jeune Homme'' and ''Je Suis N\u00e9 Dans La Rue'', the [[Al Stewart]] album ''[[Love Chronicles]]'' and played guitar on five tracks of [[Joe Cocker]]'s debut album, ''[[With a Little Help from My Friends (Joe Cocker album)|With a Little Help from My Friends]]''. Over the years since 1970, Page played lead guitar on 10 [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]] tracks, comprising 81 minutes of music.\n\nWhen questioned about which songs he played on, especially ones where there exists some controversy as to what his exact role was, Page often points out that it is hard to remember exactly what he did given the enormous number of sessions he was playing at the time.<ref name=\"DuNoyer\"/><ref name=\"tripleJ\" /> In a radio interview he explained that \"I was doing three sessions a day, fifteen sessions a week. Sometimes I would be playing with a group, sometimes I could be doing film music, it could be a folk session&nbsp;... I was able to fit all these different roles.\"<ref name=\"NPRPage\"/>\n\nAlthough Page recorded with many notable musicians, many of these early tracks are only available as [[bootleg recording]]s, several of which were released by the Led Zeppelin fan club in the late 1970s. One of the rarest of these is the early jam session featuring him and Stones guitarist [[Keith Richards]] covering [[Robert Johnson]]'s \"Little Queen of Spades\". Several early tracks were compiled on the twin album release, ''[[Jimmy Page: Session Man]]''. He also recorded with Richards on guitar and vocals in [[Olympic Sound Studios]] on 15 October 1974. Along with [[Ric Grech]] on bass and [[Bruce Rowland]] on drums, a track called \"Scarlet\" was cut. Page reflected later in an interview with ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s [[Cameron Crowe]]: \"I did what could possibly be the next Stones B side. It was Ric Grech, Keith and me doing a number called \"Scarlet.\" I can't remember the drummer. It sounded very similar in style and mood to those ''Blonde on Blonde'' tracks. It was great, really good. We stayed up all night and went down to Island Studios where Keith put some reggae guitars over one section. I just put some solos on it, but it was eight in the morning of the next day before I did that. He took the tapes to Switzerland and someone found out about them. Keith told people that it was a track from my album\".<ref name=\"PP75\" />\n\nPage left studio work when the increasing influence of [[Stax Records]] on popular music led to the greater incorporation of brass and orchestral arrangements into recordings at the expense of guitars.<ref name=\"JPinterview\" /> He stated that his time as a session player served as extremely good schooling:\n{{quote|My session work was invaluable. At one point I was playing at least three sessions a day, six days a week! And I rarely ever knew in advance what I was going to be playing. But I learned things even on my worst sessions \u2013 and believe me, I played on some horrendous things. I finally called it quits after I started getting calls to do [[Elevator music|Muzak]]. I decided I couldn't live that life any more; it was getting too silly. I guess it was destiny that a week after I quit doing sessions Paul Samwell-Smith left the Yardbirds and I was able to take his place. But being a session musician was good fun in the beginning \u2013 the studio discipline was great. They'd just count the song off and you couldn't make any mistakes.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />}}\n\n=== Late 1960s: The Yardbirds ===\n{{Main|The Yardbirds}}\n\nIn late 1964, Page was approached about the possibility of replacing Eric Clapton in the Yardbirds, but he declined out of loyalty to his friend.<ref name=\"Schulps\" /> In February 1965, Clapton quit the Yardbirds and Page was formally offered his spot, but unwilling to give up his lucrative career as a session musician and worried about his health under touring conditions, he suggested his friend Jeff Beck.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ainian.com/HitParader_April66.pdf|journal=[[Hit Parader]]|issue=April 1966|title=Jeff Beck Interview (PDF)|accessdate=12 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917085935/http://ainian.com/HitParader_April66.pdf|archive-date=17 September 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> On 16 May 1966, drummer [[Keith Moon]], bass player [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], keyboardist [[Nicky Hopkins]], Beck and Page recorded \"[[Beck's Bolero]]\" in London's [[IBC Studios]]. The experience gave Page an idea to form a new [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] featuring Beck, along with [[The Who]]'s [[John Entwistle]] on bass and Moon on drums.<ref name=\"Schulps\" /> However, the lack of a quality vocalist and contractual problems prevented the project from getting off the ground. During this time, Moon suggested the name \"Lead [[Zeppelin]]\" for the first time, after Entwistle commented that the proceedings would take to the air like a lead balloon.\n\nWithin weeks, Page attended a Yardbirds concert at [[Oxford]]. After the show, he went backstage where [[Paul Samwell-Smith]] announced that he was leaving the group.<ref name=\"JPinterview\" /> Page offered to replace Samwell-Smith, and this was accepted by the group. He initially played electric bass with the Yardbirds before finally switching to twin lead guitar with Beck when [[Chris Dreja]] moved to bass. The musical potential of the line-up was scuttled, however, by interpersonal conflicts caused by constant touring and a lack of commercial success, although they released one single, \"[[Happenings Ten Years Time Ago]]\". While Page and Beck played together in the Yardbirds, the trio of Page, Beck and Clapton never played in the original group at the same time. The three guitarists did appear on stage together at the [[ARMS Charity Concert]]s in 1983.\n\nAfter Beck's departure, the Yardbirds remained a quartet. They recorded one album with Page on lead guitar, ''[[Little Games]]''. The album received indifferent reviews and was not a commercial success, peaking at number 80 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Though their studio sound was fairly commercial at the time, the band's live performances were just the opposite, becoming heavier and more experimental. These concerts featured musical aspects that Page would later perfect with Led Zeppelin, most notably performances of \"[[Dazed and Confused (song)#Led Zeppelin live performances|Dazed and Confused]]\".\n\nAfter the departure of [[Keith Relf]] and [[Jim McCarty]] in 1968, Page reconfigured the group with a new line-up to fulfil unfinished tour dates in Scandinavia. To this end, Page recruited vocalist [[Robert Plant]] and drummer [[John Bonham]], and he was also contacted by [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], who asked to join.<ref name=\"Miserandino\">{{cite web|url=http://thecelebritycafe.com/interviews/john_paul_jones.html|title=Led Zeppelin : John talks about his musical career with Led Zeppelin, before and after|first=Dominick A.|last=Miserandino|work=TheCelebrityCafe.com|date=29 November 2000|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> During the [[Led Zeppelin Scandinavian Tour 1968|Scandinavian tour]], the new group appeared as the New Yardbirds, but soon recalled the old joke by Keith Moon and John Entwistle.

Various sources estimate the group's worldwide sales at more than 200 or even 300 million albums. With 111.5 million RIAA-certified units, they are the second-best-selling band in the United States. Each of their nine studio albums reached the top 10 of the US Billboard album chart, and six reached the number-one spot.\n\nLed Zeppelin were the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock, and their sound was largely the product of Page's input as a producer and musician. The band's individualistic style drew from a wide variety of influences. They performed on multiple record-breaking concert tours, which also earned them a reputation for excess. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, in the later 1970s, the band's output and touring schedule were limited by the personal difficulties of the members.\n\nPage explained that he had a very specific idea in mind as to what he wanted Led Zeppelin to be, from the very beginning:\n{{quote|I had a lot of ideas from my days with the Yardbirds. The Yardbirds allowed me to improvise a lot in live performance and I started building a textbook of ideas that I eventually used in Zeppelin. In addition to those ideas, I wanted to add acoustic textures. Ultimately, I wanted Zeppelin to be a marriage of blues, hard rock and acoustic music topped with heavy choruses \u2013 a combination that had never been done before. Lots of light and shade in the music.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />}}\n\n=== Post-Led Zeppelin career ===\nLed Zeppelin broke up in 1980 following the death of Bonham at Page's home. Page initially refused to touch a guitar, grieving for his friend.<ref name=\"DuNoyer\"/><ref name=\"uncutinterview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/features/john-paul-jones-on-jimmy-page-37701|first=David|last=Cavanagh|title=John Paul Jones on Jimmy Page|work=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|date=29 December 2008|accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> For the rest of the 1980s, his work consisted of a series of short-term collaborations in the bands [[The Firm (rock band)|the Firm]], [[the Honeydrippers]], reunions and individual work, including film soundtracks. He also became active in philanthropic work.\n\n===1980s===\n[[File:Jimmy Page 1983.jpg|thumb|upright|Page in 1983]]\n\nPage made a return to the stage at a Jeff Beck show in March 1981 at the [[Hammersmith Odeon]].{{sfn|Case|2007|p=164}} Also in 1981, Page joined with [[Yes (band)|Yes]] bassist [[Chris Squire]] and drummer [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]] to form a supergroup called [[XYZ (UK band)|XYZ]] (for former Yes-Zeppelin). They rehearsed several times, but the project was shelved. Bootlegs of these sessions revealed that some of the material emerged on later projects, notably The Firm's \"Fortune Hunter\" and Yes songs \"Mind Drive\" and \"Can You Imagine?\". Page joined Yes on stage in 1984 at [[Westfalenhalle]] in [[Dortmund]], Germany, playing \"[[I'm Down]]\".\n\nIn 1982, Page collaborated with director [[Michael Winner]] to record the ''[[Death Wish II (album)|Death Wish II]]'' soundtrack. This and several subsequent Page recordings, including the ''[[Death Wish III]]'' soundtrack, were recorded and produced at his recording studio, [[Sol Studios|The Sol]] in [[Cookham]], which he had purchased from [[Gus Dudgeon]] in the early 1980s.\n\n[[File:Jimmy Page - A.R.M.S. Concert, Oakland, Ca. 1983.jpg|thumb|left|Page at an A.R.M.S. concert in 1983]]\n\nIn 1983, Page appeared with the A.R.M.S. (Action Research for [[Multiple Sclerosis]]) charity series of concerts which honoured [[Small Faces]] bassist [[Ronnie Lane]], who suffered from the disease. For the first shows at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London, Page's set consisted of songs from the ''Death Wish II'' soundtrack (with [[Steve Winwood]] on vocals) and an instrumental version of \"Stairway to Heaven\". A four-city tour of the United States followed, with [[Paul Rodgers]] of [[Bad Company]] replacing Winwood. During the tour, Page and Rodgers performed \"Midnight Moonlight\", which would later appear on The Firm's first album. All of the shows featured an on stage jam of \"[[Layla]]\" that reunited Page with Beck and Clapton. According to the book ''[[Hammer of the Gods (book)|Hammer of the Gods]]'', it was reportedly around this time that Page told friends that he had just ended seven years of heroin use. On 13 December 1983, Page joined Plant on stage for one encore at the Hammersmith Odeon in London.\n\nPage next linked up with [[Roy Harper (singer)|Roy Harper]] for the 1984 album ''[[Whatever Happened to Jugula?]]'' and occasional concerts, performing a predominantly acoustic set at folk festivals under various guises such as the MacGregors and Themselves. Also in 1984, Page recorded with Plant as the Honeydrippers the album ''[[The Honeydrippers: Volume 1]]'' and with [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] on the film soundtrack ''[[Scream for Help (album)|Scream for Help]]''.\n\nPage subsequently collaborated with Rodgers on two albums under the name [[The Firm (rock band)|The Firm]]. The first album, released in 1985, was the self-titled ''[[The Firm (album)|The Firm]]''. Popular songs included \"[[Radioactive (The Firm song)|Radioactive]]\" and \"Satisfaction Guaranteed\". The album peaked at number 17 on the ''Billboard'' pop albums chart and went gold in the US. It was followed by ''[[Mean Business]]'' in 1986. The band toured in support of both albums, but soon split up.\n\nVarious other projects followed, such as session work for [[Graham Nash]], [[Stephen Stills]] and the Rolling Stones (on their 1986 single \"[[One Hit (to the Body)]]\"). In 1986, Page reunited temporarily with his former Yardbirds bandmates to play on several tracks of the [[Box of Frogs]] album ''Strange Land''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3534576.stm|title=Zeppelin defend Live Aid opt out|work=BBC News|date=4 August 2004|accessdate=11 September 2010}}</ref> Page released a solo album entitled ''[[Outrider (album)|Outrider]]'' in 1988, which featured contributions from Plant, with Page contributing in turn to Plant's solo album ''[[Now and Zen]]'', which was released the same year.

However, the band members considered this performance to be sub-standard, with Page having been let down by a poorly tuned Les Paul. Page, Plant and Jones, as well as John Bonham's son [[Jason Bonham|Jason]], performed at the [[Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary]] show on 14 May 1988, closing the 12-hour show.{{sfn|Lewis|Pallett|2005|p=139}}\n\n===1990s===\nIn 1990, a [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]] concert to aid the Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy Centre and the British School for Performing Arts and Technology saw Plant unexpectedly joined by Page to perform \"[[Misty Mountain Hop]]\", \"[[Wearing and Tearing]]\" and \"[[Rock and Roll (Led Zeppelin song)|Rock and Roll]]\". The same year, Page appeared with [[Aerosmith]] at the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival. Page also performed with the band's former members at Jason Bonham's wedding. Page also embarked on a collaboration with [[David Coverdale]] in 1993 entitled [[Coverdale Page]].\n\nIn 1994, Page reunited with Plant for the penultimate performance in MTV's \"[[MTV Unplugged|Unplugged]]\" series. The 90-minute special, dubbed ''Unledded'', premiered to the highest ratings in MTV's history. In October of the same year, the session was released as the CD ''[[No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded]]'' and in 2004 as the DVD ''[[No Quarter Unledded]]''. Following a highly successful mid-1990s tour to support ''No Quarter'', Page and Plant recorded 1998's ''[[Walking into Clarksdale]]'', along with drummer [[Michael Lee (musician)|Michael Lee]].\n\nPage was heavily involved in [[remaster]]ing the Led Zeppelin catalogue. He participated in various charity concerts and charity work, particularly the ''Action for Brazil's Children Trust'' (ABC Trust), founded by his wife Jimena Gomez-Paratcha in 1998. In the same year, Page played guitar for [[Hip hop music|rap]] singer/producer [[Puff Daddy]]'s song \"[[Come with Me (Puff Daddy & Jimmy Page song)|Come with Me]]\", which heavily samples Led Zeppelin's \"[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]\" and was included in the soundtrack of ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]''. The two later performed the song on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.\n\nIn October 1999, Page teamed up with [[The Black Crowes]] for a two-night performance of material from the Led Zeppelin catalogue and old blues and rock standards. The concert was recorded and released as a [[double album|double live album]], ''[[Live at the Greek]]'' in 2000. In 2001, he made an appearance on stage with [[Limp Bizkit]] frontman [[Fred Durst]] and [[Wes Scantlin]] of [[Puddle of Mudd]] at the MTV Europe Video Music Awards in [[Frankfurt]], where they performed a version of Led Zeppelin's \"[[Thank You (Led Zeppelin song)|Thank You]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12051457|title=Led Zep's Page Joins Limp Bizkit's Durst And Puddle of Mudd's Scantlin On Stage|accessdate=17 February 2007|date=11 October 2001|publisher=Yahoo|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616141509/http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12051457|archivedate=16 June 2007}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:JimmyPage.jpg|thumb|upright|Jimmy Page performing at the Led Zeppelin reunion concert at [[the O2 Arena]] in London in 2007]]\n\nIn 2005, Page was appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in recognition of his Brazilian charity work for Task Brazil and Action For Brazil's Children's Trust,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2005/12/14/page-obe.html|title=Jimmy Page given OBE for charity work|accessdate=6 January 2007|date=14 December 2005|work=CBC.ca Arts|publisher=CBC|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312030202/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2005/12/14/page-obe.html|archivedate=12 March 2007}}</ref> made an honorary citizen of [[Rio de Janeiro]] later that year and was awarded a Grammy Award.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4271212.stm|title=Zeppelin's Page made Rio citizen|accessdate=6 January 2007|date=22 September 2006|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2006, Led Zeppelin was inducted into the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]].

I started to learn microphone placements and things like that, what did and what didn't work. I certainly knew what did and didn't work with drummers because they put drummers in these little sound booths that had no sound deflection at all and the drums would just sound awful. The reality of it is the drum is a musical instrument, it relies on having a bright room and a live room&nbsp;... And so bit by bit I was learning really how ''not'' to record.<ref name=\"NPRPage\"/></blockquote>\n\nHe developed a reputation for employing effects in new ways and trying out different methods of using microphones and amplification. During the late 1960s, most British music producers placed [[microphone]]s directly in front of [[amplifier]]s and drums, resulting in the sometimes \"tinny\" sound of the recordings of the era. Page commented to ''Guitar World'' magazine that he felt the drum sounds of the day in particular \"sounded like cardboard boxes.\"<ref name=\"guiwo\" /> Instead, Page was a fan of 1950s recording techniques, [[Sun Studio]] being a particular favourite. In the same ''Guitar World'' interview, Page remarked: \"Recording used to be a science\" and \"[engineers] used to have a maxim: distance equals depth.\" Taking this maxim to heart, Page developed the idea of placing an additional microphone some distance from the amplifier (as much as twenty feet) and then recording the balance between the two. By adopting this technique, Page became one of the first British producers to record a band's \"ambient sound\" \u2013 the distance of a note's time-lag from one end of the room to the other.<ref name=\"RS2006\"/>\n\nFor the recording of several Led Zeppelin tracks, such as \"[[Whole Lotta Love]]\" and \"[[You Shook Me]]\", Page additionally utilised \"[[reverse echo]]\" \u2013 a technique which he claims to have invented himself while with the Yardbirds (he had originally developed the method when recording the 1967 single \"[[Ten Little Indians (Harry Nilsson song)|Ten Little Indians]]\").<ref name=\"guiwo\"/> This production technique involved hearing the echo before the main sound instead of after it, achieved by turning the tape over and employing the echo on a spare track, then turning the tape back over again to get the echo preceding the signal.\n\nPage has stated that, as producer, he deliberately changed the [[audio engineer]]s on Led Zeppelin albums, from [[Glyn Johns]] for the first album, to [[Eddie Kramer]] for ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'', to [[Andy Johns]] for ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]'' and later albums. He explained: \"I consciously kept changing engineers because I didn't want people to think that they were responsible for our sound. I wanted people to know it was me.\"<ref name=\"guiwo\" />\n\nJohn Paul Jones acknowledged that Page's production techniques were a key component of the success of Led Zeppelin:\n\n{{quote|The backwards echo stuff [and] a lot of the microphone techniques were just inspired. Using distance-miking&nbsp;... and small amplifiers. Everybody thinks we go in the studio with huge walls of amplifiers, but Page doesn't. He uses a really small amplifier and he just mikes it up really well, so that it fits into a sonic picture.<ref name=\"uncutinterview\"/>}}\n\nIn an interview that Page himself gave to ''Guitar World'' magazine in 1993, he remarked on his work as a producer:\n\n{{quote|Many people think of me as just a riff guitarist, but I think of myself in broader terms&nbsp;... As a record producer I would like to be remembered as someone who was able to sustain a band of unquestionable individual talent and push it to the forefront during its working career. I think I really captured the best of our output, growth, change and maturity on tape \u2013 the multifaceted gem that is Led Zeppelin.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />}}\n\n==Personal life==\n===Partners===\nAn early 1960s companion was American recording artist [[Jackie DeShannon]], possibly the inspiration for the Page composition and Led Zeppelin recording \"Tangerine\".{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p=44}}\n\nFrench model Charlotte Martin was Page's partner from 1970 to about 1982 or 1983. Page called her \"My Lady\". Together they had a daughter, [[Scarlet Page]] (born in 1971), who is a photographer.\n\nAlso during the 1970s, Page had a well-documented, several-year-long relationship with \"baby groupie\" [[Lori Mattix]] (also known as Lori Maddox), beginning when she was 13 or 14 and while he was an adult in his twenties. In light of the [[Me Too movement]] four decades later, this attracted renewed attention as [[statutory rape]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@msullivangates/a-word-on-david-bowie-lori-mattix-and-the-speed-of-information-b38681f24cf4|title=A Word on David Bowie, Lori Mattix, and the Speed of Information|publisher=Medium.com|accessdate=12 September 2018}}{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-10-wildest-led-zeppelin-legends-fact-checked-20121121/jimmy-page-dated-a-14-year-old-girl-while-he-was-in-led-zeppelin-19691231|title=Jimmy Page Dated a 14-year-old Girl While He Was in Led Zeppelin \u2013 The 10 Wildest Led Zeppelin Legends, Fact-Checked|website=Rolling Stone|access-date=30 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1986 to 1995, Page was married to Patricia Ecker, a model and waitress.

He later said that following this discovery, he thought: \"Yes, that's it. My thing: I've found it.\"{{sfn|Salewicz|2018|p=33}}\n\nThe appearance of four symbols on the jacket of Led Zeppelin's [[Led Zeppelin IV|fourth album]] has been linked to Page's interest in the occult.<ref name=\"GW2008\">''Jimmy Page interview'', ''Guitar World'', January 2008.</ref> The four symbols represented each member of the band. Page's own so-called \"Zoso\" symbol originated in ''Ars Magica Arteficii'' (1557) by [[Gerolamo Cardano]], an old alchemical [[grimoire]], where it has been identified as a [[sigil (magic)|sigil]] consisting of zodiac signs. The sigil is reproduced in ''Dictionary of Occult, Hermetic and Alchemical Sigils'' by Fred Gettings.{{sfn|Gettings|1981|p=201}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inthelight.co.nz/ledzep/zososymbol.htm|title=Jimmy Page's symbol|date=17 September 2009|accessdate=4 December 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222124002/http://www.inthelight.co.nz/ledzep/zososymbol.htm|archivedate=22 February 2012}}\n</ref>\n\nDuring tours and performances after the release of the fourth album, Page often had the \"Zoso\" symbol embroidered on his clothes, along with [[zodiac]] symbols. These were visible most notably on his \"Dragon Suit\", which included the signs for Capricorn, Scorpio and Cancer which are Page's Sun, Ascendant and Moon signs, respectively.\n\nThe artwork inside the album cover of ''Led Zeppelin IV'' is from a painting attributed to the artist Barrington Colby, influenced by the traditional Rider/Waite Tarot card design for the card called \"The Hermit\". Very little is known about Colby and rumours have persisted down the years that Page himself is responsible for the painting.<ref name=\"GW2008\" /> Page transforms into this character during his fantasy sequence in Led Zeppelin's concert film ''The Song Remains the Same''.\n\nIn the early 1970s Page owned an occult bookshop and publishing house, The Equinox Booksellers and Publishers, at 4 [[Holland Street, Kensington|Holland Street]] in [[Kensington]], London, named after Crowley's biannual magazine, ''[[The Equinox]]''.{{sfn|Salewicz|2018|p=289}} The design of the interior incorporated Egyptian and Art Deco motifs, with Crowley's birth chart affixed to a wall. Page's reasons for setting up the bookshop were straightforward:\n<blockquote>There was not one bookshop in London with a good collection of occult books and I was so pissed off at not being able to get the books I wanted.{{sfn|Salewicz|2018|p=289}}</blockquote>\n\nThe company published two books: a facsimile of Crowley's 1904 edition of ''[[The Goetia]]''<ref name=\"Tolinski2012\">{{cite book|author=Brad Tolinski|title=Light and Shade: Conversations with Jimmy Page|year=2012|publisher=Virgin|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=6gzUbV5AJQYC}}|isbn=978-0-7535-4039-8|page=183}}</ref> and ''Astrology, A Cosmic Science'' by Isabel Hickey.{{sfn|Salewicz|2018|p=290}} The lease eventually expired on the premises and was not renewed. As Page said: \"It obviously wasn't going to run the way it should without some drastic business changes, and I didn't really want to have to agree to all that. I basically just wanted the shop to be the nucleus, that's all.\"{{sfn|Salewicz|2018|p=410}}\n\nPage has maintained a strong interest in Crowley for many years. In 1978, he explained:\n\n{{quote|I feel Aleister Crowley is a misunderstood genius of the 20th century. It is because his whole thing was liberation of the person, of the entity and that restrictions would foul you up, lead to frustration which leads to violence, crime, mental breakdown, depending on what sort of makeup you have underneath. The further this age we're in now gets into technology and alienation, a lot of the points he's made seem to manifest themselves all down the line. ... I'm not saying it's a system for anybody to follow. I don't agree with everything but I find a lot of it relevant and it's those things that people attacked him on, so he was misunderstood. ... I'm not trying to interest anyone in Aleister Crowley any more than I am in Charles Dickens. All it was, was that at a particular time he was expounding a theory of self-liberation, which is something which is so important. He was like an eye to the world, into the forthcoming situation. My studies have been quite intensive, but I don't particularly want to go into it because it's a personal thing and isn't in relation to anything apart from the fact that I've employed his system in my own day to day life. ... The thing is to come to terms with one's free will, discover one's place and what one is, and from that you can go ahead and do it and not spend your whole life suppressed and frustrated. It's very basically coming to terms with yourself.<ref>''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', 13&nbsp;March 1978.</ref>}}\n\nPage was commissioned to write the soundtrack music for the film ''[[Lucifer Rising (film)|Lucifer Rising]]'' by Crowley admirer and underground movie director [[Kenneth Anger]]. Page ultimately produced 23 minutes of music, which Anger felt was insufficient because the film ran for 28 minutes and Anger wanted the film to have a full soundtrack. Anger claimed Page took three years to deliver the music and the final product was only 23 minutes of \"droning\". The director also slammed the guitarist in the press by calling him a \"dabbler\" in the occult and an addict and being too strung out on drugs to complete the project. Page countered that he had fulfilled all his obligations, even going so far as to lend Anger his own film editing equipment to help him finish the project.<ref name=\"GW2006\">''The Story Behind The Lost Lucifer Rising Soundtrack'', ''[[Guitar World]]'', October 2006.</ref> Page released the Lucifer Rising music on vinyl in 2012 via his website on \"Lucifer Rising and other sound tracks\". Side one contained \"Lucifer Rising \u2013 Main Track\", whilst side two contained the tracks \"Incubus\", \"Damask\", \"Unharmonics\", \"Damask \u2013 Ambient\", and \"Lucifer Rising  \u2013 Percussive Return\". In the December 2012 Rolling Stone cover story \"Jimmy Page Looks Back\", Page said: \"... there was a request, suggesting that Lucifer Rising should come out again with my music on. I ignored it.\"\n\nAlthough Page collected works by Crowley, he has never described himself as a [[Thelemite]] nor was he ever initiated into the [[Typhonian Order|OTO]]. The Equinox Bookstore and Boleskine House were both sold off during the 1980s, as Page settled into family life and participated in charity work.\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Jimmy Page discography}}\n\nEarly in his career, Page played on a number of recordings by British rock and pop artists as a session guitarist. As a member of the Yardbirds, he recorded ''[[Little Games]]'' (1967) (expanded in 1992 as ''Little Games Sessions & More''), ''[[Live Yardbirds: Featuring Jimmy Page|Live Yardbirds! Featuring Jimmy Page]]'' (1971), and ''[[Cumular Limit]]'' (2000). Beginning in 1968, he recorded nine albums with Led Zeppelin (see [[Led Zeppelin discography]] for the complete list). After Zeppelin, Page has recorded in several different settings. One of the first is the soundtrack album ''[[Death Wish II (album)|Death Wish II]]'' (1982). As a member of the Firm, he recorded ''[[The Firm (album)|The Firm]]'' (1985) and ''[[Mean Business]]'' (1986).

Lutrinae is a branch of the [[Mustelidae]] [[Family (biology)|family]], which also includes [[weasel]]s, [[badger]]s, [[honey badger]]s, [[marten]]s, [[mink]]s, [[polecat]]s, and [[wolverine]]s.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word ''otter'' derives from the [[Old English language|Old English]] word {{lang|ang|otor}} or {{lang|ang|oter}}. This, and cognate words in other [[Indo-European languages]], ultimately stem from the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] root {{PIE|*w\u00f3dr\u0325}}, which also gave rise to the English word \"water\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/otter |title=Otter |work=Merriam Webster's online dictionary |accessdate=16 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{OEtymD|otter}}</ref>\n\n== Terminology ==\nAn otter's den is called a holt or couch. Male otters are called dogs or boars, females are called bitches or sows, and their offspring are called pups.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Otters: ecology, behaviour and conservation| author=Kruuk H| page=7| publisher=Oxford Biology| isbn=978-0-19-856587-1 | year=2007}}</ref> The [[collective noun]]s for otters are bevy, family, lodge, romp (being descriptive of their often playful nature) or, when in water, raft.<ref>M & P Briggs, ''The Natural History of British Isles'', pp. 334\u201335{{ISBN?}}</ref><ref name=\"OTWO\">{{cite web|url=http://www.otter-world.com/facts-about-otters/|title=Facts about otters|publisher=Otter World|accessdate=1 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[feces]] of otters are typically identified by their distinctive aroma, the smell of which has been described as ranging from freshly mown hay to putrefied fish;<ref name=\"btinternet\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ottersite.btinternet.co.uk/spraints.htm|website=archive.today|title=Spraint Analysis|accessdate=28 September 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120908081151/http://www.ottersite.btinternet.co.uk/spraints.htm|archivedate=8 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> these are known as [[spraint]]s.<ref>{{Cite book |title=What Shat That?: A Pocket Guide to Poop Identity |author=Pagett, Matt |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-58008-885-5}}</ref>\n\n== Life cycle ==\nThe [[gestation]] period in otters is about 60 to 86 days. The newborn pup is cared for by the bitch, dog and older offspring. Bitch otters reach sexual maturity at approximately two years of age and males at approximately three years. The holt is built under tree roots or a rocky cairn, more common in Scotland. It is lined with moss and grass.\n\nAfter one month, the pup can leave the holt and after two months, it is able to swim. The pup lives with its family for approximately one year. Otters live up to 16 years; they are by nature playful, and frolic in the water with their pups. Its usual source of food is fish, and further downriver, eels, but it may sample frogs and birds.\n\n== Description ==\nOtters have long, slim bodies and relatively short limbs. Their most striking anatomical features are the powerful [[webbed foot|webbed feet]] used to swim, and their seal-like abilities holding breath underwater. Most have sharp claws on their feet and all except the sea otter have long, muscular tails. The 13 species range in adult size from {{convert|0.6|to|1.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|1|to|45|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight. The [[Asian small-clawed otter]] is the smallest otter species and the [[giant otter]] and [[sea otter]] are the largest. They have very soft, insulated underfur, which is protected by an outer layer of long [[guard hairs]]. This traps a layer of air which keeps them dry, warm, and somewhat [[buoyant]] under water.\n\nSeveral otter species live in cold waters and have high [[metabolic rate]]s to help keep them warm. [[European otter]]s must eat 15% of their body weight each day, and [[sea otter]]s 20 to 25%, depending on the temperature. In water as warm as {{convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, an otter needs to catch {{convert|100|g|oz|abbr=on}} of fish per hour to survive. Most [[species]] hunt for three to five hours each day and [[nursing]] mothers up to eight hours each day.\n\n==Feeding==\nFor most otters, fish is the staple of their diet. This is often supplemented by frogs, [[crayfish]] and [[crabs]].<ref>{{Cite book| title=Otters: ecology, behavior and conservation| author=Kruuk H| pages=99\u2013116| publisher=Oxford Biology| isbn=978-0-19-856587-1 | year=2007}}</ref> Some otters are experts at opening [[shellfish]], and others will feed on available small mammals or birds. Prey-dependence leaves otters very vulnerable to prey depletion. Sea otters are hunters of [[clams]], [[sea urchins]] and other shelled creatures. They are notable for their ability to use stones to break open shellfish on their stomachs. This skill must be learned by the young.<ref name=\"ONKI\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onekind.org/education/animal_sentience/tool_use/tool_use_in_otters/|title=Tool use in otters|publisher=OneKind|accessdate=1 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104064517/http://www.onekind.org/education/animal_sentience/tool_use/tool_use_in_otters|archive-date=4 November 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOtters are active hunters, chasing prey in the water or searching the beds of rivers, lakes or the seas. Most species live beside water, but river otters usually enter it only to hunt or travel, otherwise spending much of their time on land to prevent their fur becoming waterlogged. Sea otters are considerably more aquatic and live in the ocean for most of their lives.\n\nOtters are playful animals and appear to engage in various behaviors for sheer enjoyment, such as making waterslides and then sliding on them into the water. They may also find and play with small stones. Different species vary in their social structure, with some being largely solitary, while others live in groups&nbsp;\u2013 in a few species these groups may be fairly large.\n\n== Species ==\n{{seealso|List of mustelids}}\n<div class=\"thumb tright\" style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; margin:0.5em;\">\n{|border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|{{clade| style=font-size:90%;line-height:75%\n| label1=Lutrinae\n| 1={{clade\n| 1=[[Giant otter]] (''Pteronura brasiliensis'')\n|    2={{clade\n|       1={{clade\n|          1=[[North American river otter]] (''Lontra canadensis'')\n|          2={{clade\n|             1={{clade\n|                1=[[Marine otter]] (''Lontra felina'')\n|                2=[[Southern river otter]] (''Lontra provocax'')\n                }}\n|             2=[[Neotropical river otter]] (''Lontra longicaudis'')\n          }} }}\n|       2={{clade\n|          1=[[Sea otter]] (''Enhydra lutris'')\n|          2=[[Spotted-necked otter]] (''Hydrictis maculicollis'')\n|          3={{clade\n|             1={{clade\n|                1=[[Eurasian otter]] (''Lutra lutra'')\n|                2=[[Hairy-nosed otter]] (''Lutra sumatrana'')\n|                3=[[Japanese otter]]\u2020 (''Lutra nippon'')\n|                4=''[[Lutra euxena]]''\u2020\n|                5=''[[Lutra castiglionis]]''\u2020\n|                6=''[[Lutra simplicidens]]''\u2020\n|                7=''[[Lutra trinacriae]]''\u2020\n                }}\n|             2={{clade\n|                1={{clade\n|                   1=[[African clawless otter]] (''Aonyx capensis'')\n                            }}\n|                2={{clade\n|                   1=[[Asian small-clawed otter]] (''Aonyx cinerea'')\n|                   2=[[Smooth-coated otter]] (''Lutrogale perspicillata'')\n}} }} }} }} }} }} }}\n|}\n<div style=\"border: none;\"><div class=\"thumbcaption\"><center><small>Cladogram, after Koepfli ''et al.'' 2008<ref name=Koepfli2008>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Koepfli KP, Deere KA, Slater GJ, etal |title=Multigene phylogeny of the Mustelidae: Resolving relationships, tempo and biogeographic history of a mammalian adaptive radiation |journal=BMC Biol. |volume=6 |pages=4\u20135 |year=2008 |pmid=18275614 |doi=10.1186/1741-7007-6-10 |pmc=2276185}}</ref> and Bininda-Emonds ''et al.'' 1999<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Bininda-Emonds OR, Gittleman JL, Purvis A |title=Building large trees by combining phylogenetic information: a complete phylogeny of the extant Carnivora (Mammalia) |journal=Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=143\u201375 |year=1999 |pmid=10396181 |doi=10.1017/S0006323199005307|url=http://www.molekularesystematik.uni-oldenburg.de/download/Publications/CarnivoreST.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.328.7194 }}</ref></small></center></div></div></div>\n\nGenus ''[[Lutra]] ''\n*[[Eurasian otter]] (''Lutra lutra'')\n*[[Hairy-nosed otter]] (''Lutra sumatrana'')\n*[[Japanese otter]]\u2020 (''Lutra nippon'')\n* ''[[Lutra euxena]]''\u2020\n* ''[[Lutra castiglionis]]''\u2020\n* ''[[Lutra simplicidens]]''\u2020\n* ''[[Lutra trinacriae]]''\u2020\nGenus ''[[Hydrictis]]''\n*[[Spotted-necked otter]] (''Hydrictis maculicollis'')\nGenus ''[[Lutrogale]]''\n*[[Smooth-coated otter]] (''Lutrogale perspicillata'')\n* ''[[Lutrogale robusta]]''\u2020\nGenus ''[[Lontra]]''\n*[[North American river otter]] (''Lontra canadensis'')\n*[[Southern river otter]] (''Lontra provocax'')\n*[[Neotropical river otter]] (''Lontra longicaudis'')\n*[[Marine otter]] (''Lontra felina'')\nGenus ''[[Pteronura]]''\n*[[Giant otter]] (''Pteronura brasiliensis'')\nGenus ''[[Amblonyx]]''\n*[[Asian small-clawed otter]] (''Amblonyx cinereus'')\nGenus ''[[Aonyx]]''\n*[[African clawless otter]] (''Aonyx capensis'')\nGenus ''[[Sea otter|Enhydra]]''\n*[[Sea otter]] (''Enhydra lutris'')\n* ''[[Enhydra reevei]]''\u2020\nGenus \u2020''[[Megalenhydris]]'' <br />\nGenus \u2020''[[Sardolutra]]'' <br />\nGenus \u2020''[[Algarolutra]]'' <br />\nGenus \u2020''[[Cyrnaonyx]]'' <br />\nGenus \u2020''[[Teruelictis]]''<br />\nGenus \u2020''[[Enhydriodon]]''<br />\nGenus \u2020''[[Enhydritherium]]''<br />\nGenus \u2020''[[Teruelictis]]''<br />\nGenus \u2020''[[Limnonyx]]''<br />\nGenus \u2020''[[Lutravus]]''<br />\nGenus \u2020''[[Sivaonyx]]''<br />\nGenus \u2020''[[Torolutra]]''<br />\nGenus \u2020''[[Tyrrhenolutra]]''<br />\nGenus \u2020''[[Vishnuonyx]]'' <br />\nGenus \u2020''[[Siamogale]]''\n\n=== European otter ===\n{{Main|European otter}}\n[[File:Otter in Southwold.jpg|thumb|left|European otter, England]]\nThe European otter (''Lutra lutra''), also called the Eurasian otter, inhabits Europe, most of Asia and parts of North Africa. In the [[British Isles]], they were common as recently as the 1950s, but became rare in many areas due to the use of [[chlorinated hydrocarbon]] [[pesticide]]s, [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] loss and water pollution (they remained relatively common in parts of Scotland and Ireland). Population levels reached a low point in the 1980s, but are now recovering strongly. The UK [[Biodiversity Action Plan]] envisages the re-establishment of otters by 2010 in all the UK rivers and coastal areas they inhabited in 1960.

This, and cognate words in other [[Indo-European languages]], ultimately stem from the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] root {{PIE|*w\u00f3dr\u0325}}, which also gave rise to the English word \"water\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/otter |title=Otter |work=Merriam Webster's online dictionary |accessdate=16 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{OEtymD|otter}}</ref>\n\n== Terminology ==\nAn otter's den is called a holt or couch.

The newborn pup is cared for by the bitch, dog and older offspring. Bitch otters reach sexual maturity at approximately two years of age and males at approximately three years. The holt is built under tree roots or a rocky cairn, more common in Scotland. It is lined with moss and grass.\n\nAfter one month, the pup can leave the holt and after two months, it is able to swim. The pup lives with its family for approximately one year. Otters live up to 16 years; they are by nature playful, and frolic in the water with their pups. Its usual source of food is fish, and further downriver, eels, but it may sample frogs and birds.\n\n== Description ==\nOtters have long, slim bodies and relatively short limbs. Their most striking anatomical features are the powerful [[webbed foot|webbed feet]] used to swim, and their seal-like abilities holding breath underwater. Most have sharp claws on their feet and all except the sea otter have long, muscular tails. The 13 species range in adult size from {{convert|0.6|to|1.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|1|to|45|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight. The [[Asian small-clawed otter]] is the smallest otter species and the [[giant otter]] and [[sea otter]] are the largest. They have very soft, insulated underfur, which is protected by an outer layer of long [[guard hairs]]. This traps a layer of air which keeps them dry, warm, and somewhat [[buoyant]] under water.\n\nSeveral otter species live in cold waters and have high [[metabolic rate]]s to help keep them warm. [[European otter]]s must eat 15% of their body weight each day, and [[sea otter]]s 20 to 25%, depending on the temperature. In water as warm as {{convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, an otter needs to catch {{convert|100|g|oz|abbr=on}} of fish per hour to survive. Most [[species]] hunt for three to five hours each day and [[nursing]] mothers up to eight hours each day.\n\n==Feeding==\nFor most otters, fish is the staple of their diet. This is often supplemented by frogs, [[crayfish]] and [[crabs]].<ref>{{Cite book| title=Otters: ecology, behavior and conservation| author=Kruuk H| pages=99\u2013116| publisher=Oxford Biology| isbn=978-0-19-856587-1 | year=2007}}</ref> Some otters are experts at opening [[shellfish]], and others will feed on available small mammals or birds. Prey-dependence leaves otters very vulnerable to prey depletion. Sea otters are hunters of [[clams]], [[sea urchins]] and other shelled creatures. They are notable for their ability to use stones to break open shellfish on their stomachs. This skill must be learned by the young.<ref name=\"ONKI\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onekind.org/education/animal_sentience/tool_use/tool_use_in_otters/|title=Tool use in otters|publisher=OneKind|accessdate=1 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104064517/http://www.onekind.org/education/animal_sentience/tool_use/tool_use_in_otters|archive-date=4 November 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOtters are active hunters, chasing prey in the water or searching the beds of rivers, lakes or the seas. Most species live beside water, but river otters usually enter it only to hunt or travel, otherwise spending much of their time on land to prevent their fur becoming waterlogged. Sea otters are considerably more aquatic and live in the ocean for most of their lives.\n\nOtters are playful animals and appear to engage in various behaviors for sheer enjoyment, such as making waterslides and then sliding on them into the water. They may also find and play with small stones. Different species vary in their social structure, with some being largely solitary, while others live in groups&nbsp;\u2013 in a few species these groups may be fairly large.\n\n== Species ==\n{{seealso|List of mustelids}}\n<div class=\"thumb tright\" style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; margin:0.5em;\">\n{|border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|{{clade| style=font-size:90%;line-height:75%\n| label1=Lutrinae\n| 1={{clade\n| 1=[[Giant otter]] (''Pteronura brasiliensis'')\n|    2={{clade\n|       1={{clade\n|          1=[[North American river otter]] (''Lontra canadensis'')\n|          2={{clade\n|             1={{clade\n|                1=[[Marine otter]] (''Lontra felina'')\n|                2=[[Southern river otter]] (''Lontra provocax'')\n                }}\n|             2=[[Neotropical river otter]] (''Lontra longicaudis'')\n          }} }}\n|       2={{clade\n|          1=[[Sea otter]] (''Enhydra lutris'')\n|          2=[[Spotted-necked otter]] (''Hydrictis maculicollis'')\n|          3={{clade\n|             1={{clade\n|                1=[[Eurasian otter]] (''Lutra lutra'')\n|                2=[[Hairy-nosed otter]] (''Lutra sumatrana'')\n|                3=[[Japanese otter]]\u2020 (''Lutra nippon'')\n|                4=''[[Lutra euxena]]''\u2020\n|                5=''[[Lutra castiglionis]]''\u2020\n|                6=''[[Lutra simplicidens]]''\u2020\n|                7=''[[Lutra trinacriae]]''\u2020\n                }}\n|             2={{clade\n|                1={{clade\n|                   1=[[African clawless otter]] (''Aonyx capensis'')\n                            }}\n|                2={{clade\n|                   1=[[Asian small-clawed otter]] (''Aonyx cinerea'')\n|                   2=[[Smooth-coated otter]] (''Lutrogale perspicillata'')\n}} }} }} }} }} }} }}\n|}\n<div style=\"border: none;\"><div class=\"thumbcaption\"><center><small>Cladogram, after Koepfli ''et al.'' 2008<ref name=Koepfli2008>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Koepfli KP, Deere KA, Slater GJ, etal |title=Multigene phylogeny of the Mustelidae: Resolving relationships, tempo and biogeographic history of a mammalian adaptive radiation |journal=BMC Biol. |volume=6 |pages=4\u20135 |year=2008 |pmid=18275614 |doi=10.1186/1741-7007-6-10 |pmc=2276185}}</ref> and Bininda-Emonds ''et al.'' 1999<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Bininda-Emonds OR, Gittleman JL, Purvis A |title=Building large trees by combining phylogenetic information: a complete phylogeny of the extant Carnivora (Mammalia) |journal=Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=143\u201375 |year=1999 |pmid=10396181 |doi=10.1017/S0006323199005307|url=http://www.molekularesystematik.uni-oldenburg.de/download/Publications/CarnivoreST.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.328.7194 }}</ref></small></center></div></div></div>\n\nGenus ''[[Lutra]] ''\n*[[Eurasian otter]] (''Lutra lutra'')\n*[[Hairy-nosed otter]] (''Lutra sumatrana'')\n*[[Japanese otter]]\u2020 (''Lutra nippon'')\n* ''[[Lutra euxena]]''\u2020\n* ''[[Lutra castiglionis]]''\u2020\n* ''[[Lutra simplicidens]]''\u2020\n* ''[[Lutra trinacriae]]''\u2020\nGenus ''[[Hydrictis]]''\n*[[Spotted-necked otter]] (''Hydrictis maculicollis'')\nGenus ''[[Lutrogale]]''\n*[[Smooth-coated otter]] (''Lutrogale perspicillata'')\n* ''[[Lutrogale robusta]]''\u2020\nGenus ''[[Lontra]]''\n*[[North American river otter]] (''Lontra canadensis'')\n*[[Southern river otter]] (''Lontra provocax'')\n*[[Neotropical river otter]] (''Lontra longicaudis'')\n*[[Marine otter]] (''Lontra felina'')\nGenus ''[[Pteronura]]''\n*[[Giant otter]] (''Pteronura brasiliensis'')\nGenus ''[[Amblonyx]]''\n*[[Asian small-clawed otter]] (''Amblonyx cinereus'')\nGenus ''[[Aonyx]]''\n*[[African clawless otter]] (''Aonyx capensis'')\nGenus ''[[Sea otter|Enhydra]]''\n*[[Sea otter]] (''Enhydra lutris'')\n* ''[[Enhydra reevei]]''\u2020\nGenus \u2020''[[Megalenhydris]]'' <br />\nGenus \u2020''[[Sardolutra]]'' <br />\nGenus \u2020''[[Algarolutra]]'' <br />\nGenus \u2020''[[Cyrnaonyx]]'' <br />\nGenus \u2020''[[Teruelictis]]''<br />\nGenus \u2020''[[Enhydriodon]]''<br />\nGenus \u2020''[[Enhydritherium]]''<br />\nGenus \u2020''[[Teruelictis]]''<br />\nGenus \u2020''[[Limnonyx]]''<br />\nGenus \u2020''[[Lutravus]]''<br />\nGenus \u2020''[[Sivaonyx]]''<br />\nGenus \u2020''[[Torolutra]]''<br />\nGenus \u2020''[[Tyrrhenolutra]]''<br />\nGenus \u2020''[[Vishnuonyx]]'' <br />\nGenus \u2020''[[Siamogale]]''\n\n=== European otter ===\n{{Main|European otter}}\n[[File:Otter in Southwold.jpg|thumb|left|European otter, England]]\nThe European otter (''Lutra lutra''), also called the Eurasian otter, inhabits Europe, most of Asia and parts of North Africa. In the [[British Isles]], they were common as recently as the 1950s, but became rare in many areas due to the use of [[chlorinated hydrocarbon]] [[pesticide]]s, [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] loss and water pollution (they remained relatively common in parts of Scotland and Ireland). Population levels reached a low point in the 1980s, but are now recovering strongly. The UK [[Biodiversity Action Plan]] envisages the re-establishment of otters by 2010 in all the UK rivers and coastal areas they inhabited in 1960. [[Roadkill]] deaths have become one of the significant threats to the success of their re-establishment.\n\n=== North American river otter ===\n{{Main|North American river otter}}\n[[File:LutraCanadensis fullres.jpg|thumb|North American river otters]]\n\nThe North American river otter (''Lontra canadensis'') became one of the major animals hunted and trapped for [[fur]] in North America after European contact. River otters eat a variety of fish and shellfish, as well as small land mammals and birds. They grow to one meter (3 to 4&nbsp;ft) in length and weigh from five to 15 kilograms (10 to 30&nbsp;lb).\n\nIn some areas, this is a protected species, and some places have otter sanctuaries that help sick and injured otters to recover.\n\n=== Sea otter ===\n{{Main|Sea otter}}\n[[File:Sea otter cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Sea otter in [[Morro Bay]], California]]\n\nSea otters (''Enhydra lutris'') are classified as [[marine mammal]]s and live along the Pacific coast of North America.

Although once near extinction, they have begun to spread again, from remnant populations in California and [[Alaska]].\n\nUnlike most marine mammals (such as [[Pinniped|seals]] or whales), sea otters do not have a layer of insulating [[blubber]].<ref name=\"www.defenders.org\" /> As with other species of otter, they rely on a layer of air trapped in their fur, which they keep topped up by blowing into the fur from their mouths.

Early hunting methods included darts, arrows, nets and snares but later, traps were set on land and guns used.\n\nThere has been a long history of otter pelts being worn around the world. In China it was standard for the royalty to wear robes made from them. People that were financially high in status also wore them. The tails of otters were often made into items for men to wear. These included hats and belts.

These included GLV-10 in Gippsland, who moved to channel 8 in order to allow ATV-0 Melbourne to move to channel 10 in 1980. DDQ-10 and TVQ-0 switched channels to become DDQ-0 and TVQ-10, and SEQ10 became SEQ55 in 1988.\n\nThe last regional station to launch before aggregation launched unofficially on 2 January 1988 \u2013 IMP-9, [[Imparja Television]] in [[Alice Springs]], began transmission via the [[Optus fleet of satellites|AUSSAT]] satellites, as well as a number of terrestrial transmitters.\n\n====Aggregation====\nThe [[Bob Hawke|Hawke Labor government]] of the 1980s introduced a system of regional equalisation, known as aggregation, which would provide regional viewers with the same viewing choice as their metropolitan counterparts.\n\nLocal stations protested at this proposal, arguing that their profits would fall, and that local output would also decrease. They offered their own proposal, whereby the existing operator would be allowed to operate relays of the other two networks, allowing a combination of both viewer choice and local programming. If NBN were to take the Nine affiliation, for example, their two relays would offer programs from the Seven and Ten networks, direct from Sydney.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} This proposal was, however, rejected.\n\nThe new system would allow stations to transmit into neighbouring markets, as an affiliate of one of the three metropolitan networks. For instance, before aggregation, there were three separate licence areas in northern [[New South Wales]] \u2013 [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], [[New England (Australia)|New England]], and the [[Mid North Coast]], each served by a single commercial station. After aggregation, these three licence areas merged, with the three stations in direct competition for viewers.\n\nSoon after realising they had lost their battle with the government, the stations began to organise affiliations with metro networks. Stations that hadn't joined forces beforehand began to merge and form new networks:\n{{Col-start}}\n{{Col-3}}\n'''Vision TV''' (later '''Star Television''')\n* [[RTQ-7]] [[Rockhampton]]\n* [[DDQ (TV station)|DDQ-0]] [[Toowoomba]]\n{{Col-3}}\n'''Prime Television''' (later '''[[Prime7]]''')\n* [[CWN-6]] [[Dubbo]] (previously part of ''MidState Television'')\n* [[CBN (Australian TV station)|CBN-8]] [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]] (previously part of ''MidState Television'')\n* [[MTN (TV station)|MTN-9]] [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]] (previously part of ''MidState Television'', split from network in 1989 to affiliate with [[WIN Television]])\n* [[RVN (TV station)|RVN-2]] [[Wagga Wagga]] (previously part of ''RVN-AMV'')\n* [[AMV (TV station)|AMV-4]] [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury]]-[[Wodonga]] (previously part of ''RVN-AMV'')\n{{Col-3}}\n'''Sunshine Television Network''' (callsign '''STQ''')\n* [[SEQ-8]] [[Maryborough, Queensland|Maryborough]]\n* [[STQ|MVQ-6]] [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]]\n{{Col-end}}\n\nSouthern New South Wales was the first area to be formed, in two phases (as a result of problems in Orange and Wagga), starting on 31 March 1989. [[WIN Television]] [[Wollongong]] (WIN-4) became an affiliate of the [[Nine Network]], [[Prime7|The Prime Network]] became a [[Seven Network|Seven]] affiliate, and [[CTC (TV station)|Capital Television]] in [[Canberra]] became a [[Network Ten]] affiliate.\n\nThe next area to be aggregated was Queensland, which took place on 31 December 1990. QTV was to become a Nine affiliate, Star Television a Network Ten affiliate, and the Sunshine Television Network a Seven affiliate. However, in the week before aggregation was due to take place, [[WIN Television]] bought Star Television and gave them the Nine affiliation \u2013 meaning that QTV was forced to change its affiliation to Network Ten.\n\nThe next year, northern New South Wales was aggregated. [[NBN Television]] became the Nine Network affiliate, while the Seven Network would be carried by [[Prime7]], formerly carried by 9-8 Television. [[NRTV|Northern Rivers Television (NRTV)]] became the Network Ten affiliate. At one stage, WIN made its first attempt in setting up a northern New South Wales outlet by replicating the steal it had made in Regional Queensland. WIN tried to buy NRTV through bidding to steal the Nine affiliation rights from NBN, and force the latter to pick up the Ten affiliation. However, nothing came out of the deal and the respective affiliations remained as is among stations until today.\n\nAggregation in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] took place between 1992 and 1993. [[Vic Television|VIC TV]] (later WIN) became a Nine Network affiliate, Prime Television the Seven affiliate, and [[Southern Cross Ten|SCN]] the Ten affiliate. [[Tasmania]] was aggregated in 1994, albeit with only two stations \u2013 [[Southern Cross Television|Southern Cross]] is a dual Seven and Ten affiliate, while [[TAS TV]] took programming from the Nine Network.\n\nRemote and Central Australia was the final area to be aggregated \u2013 one of the largest geographical licence areas, taking in parts of the [[Northern Territory]], western [[Queensland]], the north west of [[South Australia]], and other areas in which [[terrestrial television]] signals cannot be received. Stations broadcast to this area mainly through [[satellite television|satellite]] or re-transmission stations. [[Imparja Television]], based in [[Alice Springs]], became a dual Nine and Ten affiliate, while [[Seven Central]], based in [[Mount Isa]], became a Seven affiliate.\n\nA number of areas were not aggregated, due to their small size and relative inability to support more than one commercial station \u2013 these included Griffith, Mildura, Darwin and regional Western Australia.\n\n===1990s===\nThroughout the 1990s, a number of changes relating to local programming and identity began to take place \u2013 the first of which was to occur for [[NRTV]], bought out by QTV's owners, [[Telecasters Australia]] in 1993. Soon after, both stations took on generic Network Ten branding with the name ''Ten Northern New South Wales'' and ''Ten Queensland''. Local news services were also axed in most of these areas with the exception of [[Townsville]] and [[Cairns]]. Similarly, the Southern Cross Network in Victoria changed its name and logo to a pseudo-Ten ''SCN'' design. The same network later axed local news services and changed its name to ''Ten Victoria'', in line with moves taken by the Telecasters Australia-owned stations in New South Wales and Queensland.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\n[[NBN Television]] made similar moves in 1994, when it launched a new logo based on that of the [[Nine Network]] at the time. [[Sunshine Television]] was purchased by the [[Seven Network]] in 1995 and became nearly identical to the network's metropolitan stations under the name ''Seven Queensland''.\n\nA second commercial licence was made available for single-licence areas such as [[Mildura]], [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]], and [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. Incumbent stations were permitted to apply for the new licence under Section 73 of the ''[[Broadcasting Services Act 1992]]'', however only if the [[Australian Broadcasting Authority]], at the time, felt that there was no other operator who would be interested or able to operate a new station in the area.

However, as of 2007 all of the licences so far granted under section 38B have been to joint ventures between existing operators. These licences were awarded to [[Tasmania]] ([[Tasmanian Digital Television]], owned by WIN and Southern Cross), [[Mildura]] ([[Mildura Digital Television]], owned by WIN and Prime), and [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] ([[Darwin Digital Television]], owned by PBL Media and Southern Cross).\n\nThe axing of local news services by [[Prime7]] and [[Southern Cross Broadcasting]] in Newcastle, Wollongong, Queensland, Darwin and remote Central & Eastern Australia triggered a review of local content regulations by the [[Australian Broadcasting Authority]]. The ABA later ruled, in 2003, that a minimum level of local content should be provided in the four largest regional licence areas. Prime and Southern Cross responded to this by launching two-minute bulletins for all affected regions from areas in which local news was already produced, as well as in [[Southern Cross Ten]]'s case the current affairs program ''State Focus'', and on [[Prime]], a Saturday morning children's programme ''Saturday Club''.\n\nIn December 2003, the first digital-only commercial television station was launched, [[Tasmanian Digital Television]], operating on a supplementary licence owned jointly by WIN Television and Southern Cross. Similarly, [[Mildura Digital Television]] (a similar joint venture between WIN and Prime) began broadcasting in 2006 to Mildura, offering exclusive Ten-based programming for the first time in the area. It is a direct feed of [[ATV (Australia)|Ten Melbourne]] with local advertising. [[Darwin Digital Television]] opened transmission on 28 April 2008.\n\nDuring April 2007, SP Telemedia announced that it would consider selling NBN Television, and had received at least two bids, one each from WIN (in its second attempt of entering the northern NSW market) and Nine Network's owner [[PBL Media]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/04/20/1902772.htm|title=WIN, PBL pursuing Newcastle Channel 9|date=20 April 2007|work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=16 July 2007}}</ref> On 9 May 2007, [[PBL Media]]'s (now Nine Entertainment Co.)

In addition to these, digital television channels from [[ABC Television]] and [[SBS Television]] are also available. The majority of these areas were aggregated in the early 1990s.

Consequently, only two broadcasters operate in these areas, with a jointly owned supplementary service that provides the services of the remaining network.

'''2''': State feed. '''3''': Local feed.

The first is the \"national feed\" \u2013 content that is broadcast to the entire country, more-or-less at the same time (accounting for time zones and minor rescheduling). This category is composed of nearly all the non-news programs and sometimes station promotions and branding.\n\nThe second is the \"state feed\", content that is broadcast to the entire state or territory. It comprises mainly state news, as well as current affairs programs and station promotions. This is usually the case in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]] and [[Western Australia]]. The third is the \"local feed\", content broadcast to a specific market, such as local news and advertising.\n\n===Original Programming===\nIn order to fulfil regulations put in place by the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]], the majority of regional networks are required to provide original, locally targeted output such as news, current affairs, or children's programmes.<ref name=\"newsother-quotas\">{{cite press release\n | title = MR 73/2006\n | publisher = [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]]\n | date = 24 July 2006\n | url = http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_100666\n | accessdate = 2007-07-01\n }}\n</ref>\n\n[[WIN Television]], Australia's largest regional network, produces a number of programs including sports magazine show ''[[Fishing Australia]]'', cooking show ''[[Alive and Cooking]]'', and travel shows ''[[Destinations]]'' and ''[[Postcards (TV series)|Postcards Australia]]''. [[Southern Cross Television]] in [[Tasmania]] airs ''Hook, Line and Sinker'' alongside a range of other regional programs.\n\nUp until its full merger with Channel Seven, Both [[Prime]] and [[GWN7|GWN]] produce their own versions of ''The Saturday Club''. Prime also produces country music show ''A Little Bit of Country'' as well as an agricultural news program, ''On the Land''. Prime 7/GWN7 currently show just ''Seven'' programming.\n\n[[Imparja Television]] also produce various local indigenous programs, as well as ''[[Yamba's Playtime]]'', a daily show for pre-school children. Most Imparja-produced programming is also shown on [[National Indigenous Television]].\n\n===News===\n[[Australian Communications and Media Authority|ACMA]] regulations have, since 2003, required stations to provide minimum levels of local news and other content.<ref name=\"newsother-quotas\" />\n\n* [[WIN Television]] produces half-hour ''[[WIN News]]'' bulletins for twelve regional markets, airing at 6pm on weeknights. The network also produces ''All Australian News,'' composed of stories from WIN's regional bulletins. In nine markets, short news updates are broadcast throughout the day, generally to fulfill local content quotas.\n* [[Nine Network|Nine]]-owned [[NBN Television|NBN]] produces an hour-long program, ''NBN News'', containing local, national and international news, sport and weather for its entire coverage area, airing nightly at 6:00pm. NBN News is considered as the only mainland regional station to produce a one-hour news bulletin 365 days a year. As part of the nightly bulletin, the station produces local opt-outs for each of its six sub-regions.\n* [[Prime7]] produces half-hour bulletins in five markets in New South Wales and Victoria; as well as in [[Western Australia]] under the ''[[Golden West Network#News|GWN7 News]]'' banner. In other areas, Prime7 produces short updates to fulfill quota requirements.\n* [[STQ|Seven Queensland]] produces half-hour bulletins in each of its seven coverage areas ([[Cairns]], [[Townsville]], [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]], [[Central Queensland]], [[Darling Downs]], [[Wide Bay\u2013Burnett]] and the [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine Coast]]).\n*The Brisbane stations of [[QTQ-9|Nine]] and [[BTQ|Seven]] both produce half-hour bulletins for the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] at 5:30pm, airing as an opt-out on the respective station's Gold Coast transmitters.\n* [[Southern Cross Television]] in Tasmania produces ''Nightly News'', a nightly hour-long bulletin incorporating local, national & international news, and a 30-minute local bulletin on weeknights for the [[Spencer Gulf, South Australia|Spencer Gulf]]/[[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] area of [[South Australia]]. For the remote central and eastern Australia licence area, [[Southern Cross Central]] and [[Imparja Television]] both air short news updates each weekday.\n* [[Southern Cross Nine]] airs hour-long state-based editions of ''[[Nine News]]'' in Queensland, Southern New South Wales, the ACT, Victoria and Darwin each weeknight, incorporating local, national and international stories. The three editions contain opt-outs for local news, sport and weather in fourteen markets.\n\nIn most cases, newsroom staff including reporters, camera crews and producers are based in newsrooms within the coverage area though the news program itself may be presented and broadcast from studios outside the region. For example, news staff for Seven's [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]] bulletin is based in the city with the program presented from studios in [[Maroochydore]].\n\n===Scheduling===\nThe majority of programming in regional areas is shown at the same time as its metropolitan counterpart, with some exceptions, mainly for local news programs. Prior to the 2016 media shakeup, ''[[A Current Affair (Australian TV series)|A Current Affair]]'' was shown at 7.30pm rather than 7.00pm in most WIN regions via then-HD multichannel GEM (Tasmania and markets without a ''WIN News'' bulletin received the programme in its original timeslot on the main channel). NBN had aired the program on delay at 7pm until the expansion of Nine's metropolitan local bulletins in January 2014, allowing the station to air ACA at the same time as in Sydney.\n\nPrime7 had aired Seven News on delay at 6.30pm in markets that receive full local bulletins at 6.00pm until the major expansion of Seven's metropolitan local bulletins in February 2014, allowing the stations to extend both the Prime7 bulletins at the same time as in Sydney and Melbourne.

Prior to the full merge with Seven, Prime and GWN choose to replace nearly all Seven Network programs between midnight and 6am with infomercials, along with Southern Cross Ten, which also replaces some morning programs with infomercials.\n\nPrior to 2016, NBN Television opted to air classic programs (The Sullivans), its own ''Today Extra'' program until 2007 and infomercials in place of Nine's Morning News.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[2016 Australian regional television realignment]]\n{{Portal|Television|Australia}}\n\n{{Television in Australia}}\n\n[[Category:Television in Australia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Australian English|date=July 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\nIn Australia, '''regional television''' is the local television services outside of the five main Australian cities ([[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide]] and [[Perth]]).\n\n==History==\n\n===1960s===\nThe first regional television stations were launched five years after the rollout of television to metropolitan [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide]] and [[Perth]].

These included GLV-10 in Gippsland, who moved to channel 8 in order to allow ATV-0 Melbourne to move to channel 10 in 1980. DDQ-10 and TVQ-0 switched channels to become DDQ-0 and TVQ-10, and SEQ10 became SEQ55 in 1988.\n\nThe last regional station to launch before aggregation launched unofficially on 2 January 1988 \u2013 IMP-9, [[Imparja Television]] in [[Alice Springs]], began transmission via the [[Optus fleet of satellites|AUSSAT]] satellites, as well as a number of terrestrial transmitters.\n\n====Aggregation====\nThe [[Bob Hawke|Hawke Labor government]] of the 1980s introduced a system of regional equalisation, known as aggregation, which would provide regional viewers with the same viewing choice as their metropolitan counterparts.\n\nLocal stations protested at this proposal, arguing that their profits would fall, and that local output would also decrease. They offered their own proposal, whereby the existing operator would be allowed to operate relays of the other two networks, allowing a combination of both viewer choice and local programming. If NBN were to take the Nine affiliation, for example, their two relays would offer programs from the Seven and Ten networks, direct from Sydney.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} This proposal was, however, rejected.\n\nThe new system would allow stations to transmit into neighbouring markets, as an affiliate of one of the three metropolitan networks. For instance, before aggregation, there were three separate licence areas in northern [[New South Wales]] \u2013 [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], [[New England (Australia)|New England]], and the [[Mid North Coast]], each served by a single commercial station. After aggregation, these three licence areas merged, with the three stations in direct competition for viewers.\n\nSoon after realising they had lost their battle with the government, the stations began to organise affiliations with metro networks. Stations that hadn't joined forces beforehand began to merge and form new networks:\n{{Col-start}}\n{{Col-3}}\n'''Vision TV''' (later '''Star Television''')\n* [[RTQ-7]] [[Rockhampton]]\n* [[DDQ (TV station)|DDQ-0]] [[Toowoomba]]\n{{Col-3}}\n'''Prime Television''' (later '''[[Prime7]]''')\n* [[CWN-6]] [[Dubbo]] (previously part of ''MidState Television'')\n* [[CBN (Australian TV station)|CBN-8]] [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]] (previously part of ''MidState Television'')\n* [[MTN (TV station)|MTN-9]] [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]] (previously part of ''MidState Television'', split from network in 1989 to affiliate with [[WIN Television]])\n* [[RVN (TV station)|RVN-2]] [[Wagga Wagga]] (previously part of ''RVN-AMV'')\n* [[AMV (TV station)|AMV-4]] [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury]]-[[Wodonga]] (previously part of ''RVN-AMV'')\n{{Col-3}}\n'''Sunshine Television Network''' (callsign '''STQ''')\n* [[SEQ-8]] [[Maryborough, Queensland|Maryborough]]\n* [[STQ|MVQ-6]] [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]]\n{{Col-end}}\n\nSouthern New South Wales was the first area to be formed, in two phases (as a result of problems in Orange and Wagga), starting on 31 March 1989. [[WIN Television]] [[Wollongong]] (WIN-4) became an affiliate of the [[Nine Network]], [[Prime7|The Prime Network]] became a [[Seven Network|Seven]] affiliate, and [[CTC (TV station)|Capital Television]] in [[Canberra]] became a [[Network Ten]] affiliate.\n\nThe next area to be aggregated was Queensland, which took place on 31 December 1990. QTV was to become a Nine affiliate, Star Television a Network Ten affiliate, and the Sunshine Television Network a Seven affiliate. However, in the week before aggregation was due to take place, [[WIN Television]] bought Star Television and gave them the Nine affiliation \u2013 meaning that QTV was forced to change its affiliation to Network Ten.\n\nThe next year, northern New South Wales was aggregated. [[NBN Television]] became the Nine Network affiliate, while the Seven Network would be carried by [[Prime7]], formerly carried by 9-8 Television. [[NRTV|Northern Rivers Television (NRTV)]] became the Network Ten affiliate. At one stage, WIN made its first attempt in setting up a northern New South Wales outlet by replicating the steal it had made in Regional Queensland. WIN tried to buy NRTV through bidding to steal the Nine affiliation rights from NBN, and force the latter to pick up the Ten affiliation. However, nothing came out of the deal and the respective affiliations remained as is among stations until today.\n\nAggregation in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] took place between 1992 and 1993. [[Vic Television|VIC TV]] (later WIN) became a Nine Network affiliate, Prime Television the Seven affiliate, and [[Southern Cross Ten|SCN]] the Ten affiliate. [[Tasmania]] was aggregated in 1994, albeit with only two stations \u2013 [[Southern Cross Television|Southern Cross]] is a dual Seven and Ten affiliate, while [[TAS TV]] took programming from the Nine Network.\n\nRemote and Central Australia was the final area to be aggregated \u2013 one of the largest geographical licence areas, taking in parts of the [[Northern Territory]], western [[Queensland]], the north west of [[South Australia]], and other areas in which [[terrestrial television]] signals cannot be received. Stations broadcast to this area mainly through [[satellite television|satellite]] or re-transmission stations. [[Imparja Television]], based in [[Alice Springs]], became a dual Nine and Ten affiliate, while [[Seven Central]], based in [[Mount Isa]], became a Seven affiliate.\n\nA number of areas were not aggregated, due to their small size and relative inability to support more than one commercial station \u2013 these included Griffith, Mildura, Darwin and regional Western Australia.\n\n===1990s===\nThroughout the 1990s, a number of changes relating to local programming and identity began to take place \u2013 the first of which was to occur for [[NRTV]], bought out by QTV's owners, [[Telecasters Australia]] in 1993. Soon after, both stations took on generic Network Ten branding with the name ''Ten Northern New South Wales'' and ''Ten Queensland''. Local news services were also axed in most of these areas with the exception of [[Townsville]] and [[Cairns]]. Similarly, the Southern Cross Network in Victoria changed its name and logo to a pseudo-Ten ''SCN'' design. The same network later axed local news services and changed its name to ''Ten Victoria'', in line with moves taken by the Telecasters Australia-owned stations in New South Wales and Queensland.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\n[[NBN Television]] made similar moves in 1994, when it launched a new logo based on that of the [[Nine Network]] at the time. [[Sunshine Television]] was purchased by the [[Seven Network]] in 1995 and became nearly identical to the network's metropolitan stations under the name ''Seven Queensland''.\n\nA second commercial licence was made available for single-licence areas such as [[Mildura]], [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]], and [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. Incumbent stations were permitted to apply for the new licence under Section 73 of the ''[[Broadcasting Services Act 1992]]'', however only if the [[Australian Broadcasting Authority]], at the time, felt that there was no other operator who would be interested or able to operate a new station in the area.

A second licence for remote [[Western Australia]], one of the last remaining solus markets, was put up for auction in 1998. [[WIN Television]] won the ability to broadcast to the entire regional Western Australia market (as opposed to [[Golden West Network|GWN]], which held separate licences in various areas), and subsequently launched its new station [[WOW (TV station)|WOW]] in 1999.

The remote Eastern and remote Central licence areas were also merged at this time, amongst the last to be aggregated.\n\nThe solus operators in the regional licence areas of [[South Australia]] have been granted an 38A licence, being allocated on 2002-04-24.\n\n* [[Spencer Gulf]]/[[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]]: [[GTS/BKN|Central GTS/BKN]], owned by [[Southern Cross Broadcasting]] was granted callsigns ''SGS'' and ''SCN'', and branded as [[Southern Cross Ten]], carrying [[Network Ten]] programming.\n* [[Renmark, South Australia|Renmark]]/[[Loxton, South Australia|Loxton]] and [[Mount Gambier, South Australia|Mount Gambier]]: [[WIN Television]] South Australia, owners of existing stations [[SES/RTS|SES-8]] and [[RTS (TV station)|RTS-5A]], was granted callsigns ''LRS'' and ''MGS'', branded as ''WIN Ten'', carrying Ten Network programming.\n\nIn more recent years, the premise has been extended to allow for two station markets where there are two different owners to apply, either separately or jointly, to operate a [[digital television|digital]]-only third station.

However, as of 2007 all of the licences so far granted under section 38B have been to joint ventures between existing operators. These licences were awarded to [[Tasmania]] ([[Tasmanian Digital Television]], owned by WIN and Southern Cross), [[Mildura]] ([[Mildura Digital Television]], owned by WIN and Prime), and [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] ([[Darwin Digital Television]], owned by PBL Media and Southern Cross).\n\nThe axing of local news services by [[Prime7]] and [[Southern Cross Broadcasting]] in Newcastle, Wollongong, Queensland, Darwin and remote Central & Eastern Australia triggered a review of local content regulations by the [[Australian Broadcasting Authority]]. The ABA later ruled, in 2003, that a minimum level of local content should be provided in the four largest regional licence areas. Prime and Southern Cross responded to this by launching two-minute bulletins for all affected regions from areas in which local news was already produced, as well as in [[Southern Cross Ten]]'s case the current affairs program ''State Focus'', and on [[Prime]], a Saturday morning children's programme ''Saturday Club''.\n\nIn December 2003, the first digital-only commercial television station was launched, [[Tasmanian Digital Television]], operating on a supplementary licence owned jointly by WIN Television and Southern Cross. Similarly, [[Mildura Digital Television]] (a similar joint venture between WIN and Prime) began broadcasting in 2006 to Mildura, offering exclusive Ten-based programming for the first time in the area. It is a direct feed of [[ATV (Australia)|Ten Melbourne]] with local advertising.

Channel numbers were reshuffled to align with WIN's other stations; but as Nine owned NBN Television holds the 8 numbered digital channels, NRN's channels remained on the 5 numbered channels.\n\n==Broadcasting==\n\n===Three-station Markets===\nThe majority of these licence areas are on the more densely populated east coast, in which three commercial stations are each affiliated to the [[Seven Network]], [[Nine Network]] and [[Network Ten]] from their respective capital cities. In addition to these, digital television channels from [[ABC Television]] and [[SBS Television]] are also available. The majority of these areas were aggregated in the early 1990s.

Consequently, only two broadcasters operate in these areas, with a jointly owned supplementary service that provides the services of the remaining network. These supplementary services are italicised.

'''2''': State feed. '''3''': Local feed. '''4''': Programming aired on a television station]]\n\nEach commercial network (both regional and metropolitan) can be seen as being composed of three layers, with some exceptions. The first is the \"national feed\" \u2013 content that is broadcast to the entire country, more-or-less at the same time (accounting for timezones and minor rescheduling). This category is composed of nearly all the non-news programs and sometimes station promotions and branding.\n\nThe second is the \"state feed\", content that is broadcast to the entire state or territory. It comprises mainly state news, as well as current affairs programs and station promotions. This is usually the case in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]] and [[Western Australia]]. The third is the \"local feed\", content broadcast to a specific market, such as local news and advertising.\n\n===Original Programming===\nIn order to fulfil regulations put in place by the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]], the majority of regional networks are required to provide original, locally targeted output such as news, current affairs, or children's programmes.<ref name=\"newsother-quotas\">{{cite press release\n | title = MR 73/2006\n | publisher = [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]]\n | date = 24 July 2006\n | url = http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_100666\n | accessdate = 2007-07-01\n }}\n</ref>\n\n[[WIN Television]], Australia's largest regional network, produces a number of programs including sports magazine show ''[[Fishing Australia]]'', cooking show ''[[Alive and Cooking]]'', and travel shows ''[[Destinations]]'' and ''[[Postcards (TV series)|Postcards Australia]]''. [[Southern Cross Television]] in [[Tasmania]] airs ''Hook, Line and Sinker'' alongside a range of other regional programs.\n\nUp until its full merger with Channel Seven, Both [[Prime]] and [[GWN7|GWN]] produce their own versions of ''The Saturday Club''. Prime also produces country music show ''A Little Bit of Country'' as well as an agricultural news program, ''On the Land''. Prime 7/GWN7 currently show just ''Seven'' programming.\n\n[[Imparja Television]] also produce various local indigenous programs, as well as ''[[Yamba's Playtime]]'', a daily show for pre-school children. Most Imparja-produced programming is also shown on [[National Indigenous Television]].\n\n===News===\n[[Australian Communications and Media Authority|ACMA]] regulations have, since 2003, required stations to provide minimum levels of local news and other content.<ref name=\"newsother-quotas\" />\n\n* [[WIN Television]] produces half-hour ''[[WIN News]]'' bulletins for twelve regional markets, airing at 6pm on weeknights. The network also produces ''All Australian News,'' composed of stories from WIN's regional bulletins. In nine markets, short news updates are broadcast throughout the day, generally to fulfill local content quotas.\n* [[Nine Network|Nine]]-owned [[NBN Television|NBN]] produces an hour-long program, ''NBN News'', containing local, national and international news, sport and weather for its entire coverage area, airing nightly at 6:00pm. NBN News is considered as the only mainland regional station to produce a one-hour news bulletin 365 days a year. As part of the nightly bulletin, the station produces local opt-outs for each of its six sub-regions.\n* [[Prime7]] produces half-hour bulletins in five markets in New South Wales and Victoria; as well as in [[Western Australia]] under the ''[[Golden West Network#News|GWN7 News]]'' banner. In other areas, Prime7 produces short updates to fulfill quota requirements.\n* [[STQ|Seven Queensland]] produces half-hour bulletins in each of its seven coverage areas ([[Cairns]], [[Townsville]], [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]], [[Central Queensland]], [[Darling Downs]], [[Wide Bay\u2013Burnett]] and the [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine Coast]]).\n*The Brisbane stations of [[QTQ-9|Nine]] and [[BTQ|Seven]] both produce half-hour bulletins for the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] at 5:30pm, airing as an opt-out on the respective station's Gold Coast transmitters.\n* [[Southern Cross Television]] in Tasmania produces ''Nightly News'', a nightly hour-long bulletin incorporating local, national & international news, and a 30-minute local bulletin on weeknights for the [[Spencer Gulf, South Australia|Spencer Gulf]]/[[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] area of [[South Australia]]. For the remote central and eastern Australia licence area, [[Southern Cross Central]] and [[Imparja Television]] both air short news updates each weekday.\n* [[Southern Cross Nine]] airs hour-long state-based editions of ''[[Nine News]]'' in Queensland, Southern New South Wales, the ACT, Victoria and Darwin each weeknight, incorporating local, national and international stories. The three editions contain opt-outs for local news, sport and weather in fourteen markets.\n\nIn most cases, newsroom staff including reporters, camera crews and producers are based in newsrooms within the coverage area though the news program itself may be presented and broadcast from studios outside the region. For example, news staff for Seven's [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]] bulletin is based in the city with the program presented from studios in [[Maroochydore]].\n\n===Scheduling===\nThe majority of programming in regional areas is shown at the same time as its metropolitan counterpart, with some exceptions, mainly for local news programs. Prior to the 2016 media shakeup, ''[[A Current Affair (Australian TV series)|A Current Affair]]'' was shown at 7.30pm rather than 7.00pm in most WIN regions via then-HD multichannel GEM (Tasmania and markets without a ''WIN News'' bulletin received the programme in its original timeslot on the main channel). NBN had aired the program on delay at 7pm until the expansion of Nine's metropolitan local bulletins in January 2014, allowing the station to air ACA at the same time as in Sydney.\n\nPrime7 had aired Seven News on delay at 6.30pm in markets that receive full local bulletins at 6.00pm until the major expansion of Seven's metropolitan local bulletins in February 2014, allowing the stations to extend both the Prime7 bulletins at the same time as in Sydney and Melbourne. In its current format, full bulletin markets served by stations CBN and NEN receive the Prime7 News hour composed of the usual local news bulletin at 6.00pm, followed by Prime7 News at 6.30, a live statewide bulletin covering national stories that are shown on Seven News in metropolitan markets; AMV transmitters in the Albury and NSW/Victoria border areas receive a delayed shortened first segment of Seven News Melbourne at 6.30pm after Prime7 Local News at 6.00pm, then switches back to the live Melbourne feed for sport and weather.\n\nPrior to the development of digital television broadcasting, many dual-network affiliates, such as [[WIN Television|WIN WA]], broadcast a mix of programming from two networks at differing times of the week. Prior to the full merge with Seven, Prime and GWN choose to replace nearly all Seven Network programs between midnight and 6am with infomercials, along with Southern Cross Ten, which also replaces some morning programs with infomercials.\n\nPrior to 2016, NBN Television opted to air classic programs (The Sullivans), its own ''Today Extra'' program until 2007 and infomercials in place of Nine's Morning News.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[2016 Australian regional television realignment]]\n{{Portal|Television|Australia}}\n\n{{Television in Australia}}\n\n[[Category:Television in Australia]]\n", "name_user": "3Todd", "label": "safe", "comment": "Correct \"timezone\" typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_television_in_Australia"}
