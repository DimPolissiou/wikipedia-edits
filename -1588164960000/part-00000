If the flag is damaged, it should be burned in a respectful manner.\n*The flag can be displayed by civilians on days specified by the ministry of internal affairs, as well as in sporting events and other occasions of the sort.\n*When displayed vertically, the canton must be on the left side of the flag from the point of view of the spectator.\n*The flag should never be:\n:#Defaced by means of writing or superimposing any kind of image or symbol upon it,\n:#Used to cover a statue.

In the most recent legislation regarding the national flag, the colours mentioned are:\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = The National Flag of Greece is cyan and white, it is made up of nine (9) stripes equal in width, of which five (5) are cyan and four (4) are white so that the upper and lower stripes are cyan and the others in between are white.\n |source = '''Law 851/1978''', ''Regarding the National Flag'', Article 1, Clause 1\n |quoted = 1\n |width  = 400px\n |align  = center\n|qalign = justify\n}}\nBecause of the use of the word 'cyan' ({{lang-el|\u03ba\u03c5\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2}}, {{lang|el-Latn|Kyanos}}), which can also mean 'blue' in [[Greek language|Greek]], the exact shade of blue remains ambiguous. Although it implies the use of a light shade of blue, such as on the [[flag of the United Nations]], the colours of the Greek flag tend to be darker, especially during the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974|dictatorship]] and in recent years, with the exception of the years of the rule of [[Otto of Greece|King Otto]], when a very light shade of blue was used. Consequently, the shade of blue is largely left to the flagmakers to decide, as shown in the table below. \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! Official colour (White)\n!

The designs differ according to the historical era they were used in and in accordance with the political scene in [[Greece]] at the time. The first flag to be used by a [[List of heads of state of Greece|head of state of Greece]] was that of [[Otto of Greece|King Otto of Greece]].\n\nFollowing the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Greece (Wittelsbach)|Kingdom of Greece]] in 1832, the 17-year old Bavarian prince [[Otto of Greece|Otto]] was selected as king for the newfound monarchy. A royal decree dated 4 (16) April 1833 prescribed a number of maritime flags, including the royal standard. This flag, set at a 7:10 ratio, was a variant of the Greek white-cross-on-blue and featured the ancestral coat of arms of the [[Wittelsbach dynasty]] at its centre. The construction and dimensions of this flag was further described by a decree dated 28 August 1858, which also changed the proportions of the flag from 7:10 to 3:2. Following Otto's abdication in 1862, the Wittelsbach coat of arms would subsequently be removed.\n\nIn 1863, the 17-year old Danish prince William was selected as Greece's new king, taking on the name [[George I of Greece|George I]]. A royal decree dated 28 December 1863 prescribed that the king's standard would retain the same dimensions and basic design of the previous flag. At the flag's centre, the royal coat of arms of the new dynasty ([[Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg]]) would feature. By a new royal decree of 3 June 1914, the distinguishing flags to be utilised by the various members of the royal family were described. The king's flag was defined as being square in shape and, as in previous flags, featured the coat of arms of the king on a Greek white-cross-on-blue. As the king at the time, [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]], was made a [[stratarchis|field marshal]] the previous year, the coat of arms on his flag featured a heraldic representation of the [[Marshal's baton]] in twos, crossed behind his coat of arms.\n\nWith the establishment of the [[Second Hellenic Republic]] in 1924, the king's flag was made redundant. In 1930, a presidential decree described the president's flag as being a square version of the usual cross flag, devoid of any distinguishing markings.\n\nOn 10 October 1935, [[Georgios Kondylis]] declared that the monarchy had been restored and the 3 June 1914 decree was restored by decree of 7 November 1935. This flag, and the flags of other members of the royal family, was replaced the following year with new designs. Unlike previous designs, all flags now featured the coat of arms of the dynasty at its centre and would be distinguished by the number of crowns present at each of the four corners of the flags: The flag of the king featured a crown on each of the corners of the flag. This was the last design of a royal standard to be adopted prior to the eventual formal abolition of the monarchy in 1973.\n\nThe president's flag is currently prescribed by Presidential Decree 274/1979.<ref>published in [http://www.et.gr/idocs-nph/search/pdfViewerForm.html?args=5C7QrtC22wGrY_r85_PxvndtvSoClrL8I8z79QigGevtIl9LGdkF53UIxsx942CdyqxSQYNuqAGCF0IfB9HI6hq6ZkZV96FIfIVzV77K9VrmI-B8II7sEq0wVwZop3WjWeAjIakbj2s.

One suggested explanation {{citation needed|date=October 2011}} is that, upon independence, an effort was made for political \u2014 and international relations \u2014 reasons to limit expressions implying efforts to recreate the Byzantine Empire. Yet another theory{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} is that this symbol was only connected with a particular period of Greek history (Byzantine) and a particular form of rule (imperial). More recent research {{citation needed|date=October 2011}} has justified this view, connecting this symbol only to personal and dynastic emblems of Byzantine Emperors.\n\nSome Greek sources have attempted to establish links with ancient symbols: the eagle was a common design representing power in ancient city-states, while there was an implication of a \"dual-eagle\" concept in the tale that Zeus left two eagles fly east and west from the ends of the world, eventually meeting in Delphi, thus proving it to be the centre of the earth. However, there is virtually no doubt that its origin is a blend of Roman and Eastern influences. Indeed, the early Byzantine Empire inherited the Roman eagle as an imperial symbol. During his reign, Emperor [[Isaac I Comnenus]] (1057\u201359) modified it as double-headed, influenced by traditions about such a beast in his native [[Paphlagonia]] in Asia Minor (in turn reflecting possibly much older local myths). Many modifications followed in flag details, often combined with the cross. After the recapture of Constantinople by the Byzantine Greeks in 1261, two crowns were added (over each head) representing \u2014 according to the most prevalent theory \u2014 the newly recaptured capital and the intermediate \"capital\" of the [[empire of Nicaea]].  There has been some confusion about the exact use of this symbol by the Byzantines; it appears that, at least originally, it was more a \"dynastic\" and not a \"state\" symbol (a term not fully applicable at the time, anyway), and for this reason, the colours connected with it were clearly the colours of \"imperial power\", i.e., red and yellow/gold.\n\nAfter the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]] nonetheless, the double-headed eagle remained a strong symbol of reference for the Greeks. Most characteristically, the Orthodox Church continues to use the double-headed eagle extensively as a decorative motif, and has also adopted a black eagle on yellow/gold background as its official flag.\n\nAfter the Ottoman conquest, however, this symbol also found its way to a \"new Constantinople\" (or [[Third Rome]]), i.e. [[Moscow]].  Russia, deeply influenced by the Byzantine Empire, saw herself as its heir and adopted the double-headed eagle as its imperial symbol. It was also adopted by the Serbs, the Montenegrins, the Albanians and a number of Western rulers, most notably in Germany and Austria.\n\n<gallery>\nFlag_of_the_Greek_Orthodox_Church.svg|[[File:FIAV historical.svg|23px]]Flag of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]]\nFile:Flag of Northern Epirus.PNG|{{FIAV|historical}} Flag of the [[Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus]]\nTr ponto2.gif|{{FIAV|historical}} Proposed flag for the [[Provisional Republic of Pontus|Republic of the Pontus]]\nFlag of the Greek Army.svg|Flag of the [[Hellenic Army General Staff]]\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Greece]]\n* [[Coat of arms of Greece]]\n* [[Hymn to Liberty]]\n* [[Byzantine heraldry]]\n* [[History of Greece]]\n* [[List of Greek flags]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* I.

In the surviving pictorial sources of the middle and later Empire, primarily the illustrated [[Skylitzes Chronicle]], the predominating colours are red and blue in horizontal stripes, with a cross often placed in the centre of the flag.

If the flag is damaged, it should be burned in a respectful manner.\n*The flag can be displayed by civilians on days specified by the ministry of internal affairs, as well as in sporting events and other occasions of the sort.\n*When displayed vertically, the canton must be on the left side of the flag from the point of view of the spectator.\n*The flag should never be:\n:#Defaced by means of writing or superimposing any kind of image or symbol upon it,\n:#Used to cover a statue.

In the most recent legislation regarding the national flag, the colours mentioned are:\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = The National Flag of Greece is cyan and white, it is made up of nine (9) stripes equal in width, of which five (5) are cyan and four (4) are white so that the upper and lower stripes are cyan and the others in between are white.\n |source = '''Law 851/1978''', ''Regarding the National Flag'', Article 1, Clause 1\n |quoted = 1\n |width  = 400px\n |align  = center\n|qalign = justify\n}}\nBecause of the use of the word 'cyan' ({{lang-el|\u03ba\u03c5\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2}}, {{lang|el-Latn|Kyanos}}), which can also mean 'blue' in [[Greek language|Greek]], the exact shade of blue remains ambiguous. Although it implies the use of a light shade of blue, such as on the [[flag of the United Nations]], the colours of the Greek flag tend to be darker, especially during the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974|dictatorship]] and in recent years, with the exception of the years of the rule of [[Otto of Greece|King Otto]], when a very light shade of blue was used. Consequently, the shade of blue is largely left to the flagmakers to decide, as shown in the table below. \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! Official colour (White)\n!

The designs differ according to the historical era they were used in and in accordance with the political scene in [[Greece]] at the time. The first flag to be used by a [[List of heads of state of Greece|head of state of Greece]] was that of [[Otto of Greece|King Otto of Greece]].\n\nFollowing the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Greece (Wittelsbach)|Kingdom of Greece]] in 1832, the 17-year old Bavarian prince [[Otto of Greece|Otto]] was selected as king for the newfound monarchy. A royal decree dated 4 (16) April 1833 prescribed a number of maritime flags, including the royal standard. This flag, set at a 7:10 ratio, was a variant of the Greek white-cross-on-blue and featured the ancestral coat of arms of the [[Wittelsbach dynasty]] at its centre. The construction and dimensions of this flag was further described by a decree dated 28 August 1858, which also changed the proportions of the flag from 7:10 to 3:2. Following Otto's abdication in 1862, the Wittelsbach coat of arms would subsequently be removed.\n\nIn 1863, the 17-year old Danish prince William was selected as Greece's new king, taking on the name [[George I of Greece|George I]]. A royal decree dated 28 December 1863 prescribed that the king's standard would retain the same dimensions and basic design of the previous flag. At the flag's centre, the royal coat of arms of the new dynasty ([[Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg]]) would feature. By a new royal decree of 3 June 1914, the distinguishing flags to be utilised by the various members of the royal family were described. The king's flag was defined as being square in shape and, as in previous flags, featured the coat of arms of the king on a Greek white-cross-on-blue. As the king at the time, [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]], was made a [[stratarchis|field marshal]] the previous year, the coat of arms on his flag featured a heraldic representation of the [[Marshal's baton]] in twos, crossed behind his coat of arms.\n\nWith the establishment of the [[Second Hellenic Republic]] in 1924, the king's flag was made redundant. In 1930, a presidential decree described the president's flag as being a square version of the usual cross flag, devoid of any distinguishing markings.\n\nOn 10 October 1935, [[Georgios Kondylis]] declared that the monarchy had been restored and the 3 June 1914 decree was restored by decree of 7 November 1935. This flag, and the flags of other members of the royal family, was replaced the following year with new designs. Unlike previous designs, all flags now featured the coat of arms of the dynasty at its centre and would be distinguished by the number of crowns present at each of the four corners of the flags: The flag of the king featured a crown on each of the corners of the flag. This was the last design of a royal standard to be adopted prior to the eventual formal abolition of the monarchy in 1973.\n\nThe president's flag is currently prescribed by Presidential Decree 274/1979.<ref>published in [http://www.et.gr/idocs-nph/search/pdfViewerForm.html?args=5C7QrtC22wGrY_r85_PxvndtvSoClrL8I8z79QigGevtIl9LGdkF53UIxsx942CdyqxSQYNuqAGCF0IfB9HI6hq6ZkZV96FIfIVzV77K9VrmI-B8II7sEq0wVwZop3WjWeAjIakbj2s.

One suggested explanation {{citation needed|date=October 2011}} is that, upon independence, an effort was made for political \u2014 and international relations \u2014 reasons to limit expressions implying efforts to recreate the Byzantine Empire. Yet another theory{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} is that this symbol was only connected with a particular period of Greek history (Byzantine) and a particular form of rule (imperial). More recent research {{citation needed|date=October 2011}} has justified this view, connecting this symbol only to personal and dynastic emblems of Byzantine Emperors.\n\nSome Greek sources have attempted to establish links with ancient symbols: the eagle was a common design representing power in ancient city-states, while there was an implication of a \"dual-eagle\" concept in the tale that Zeus left two eagles fly east and west from the ends of the world, eventually meeting in Delphi, thus proving it to be the centre of the earth. However, there is virtually no doubt that its origin is a blend of Roman and Eastern influences. Indeed, the early Byzantine Empire inherited the Roman eagle as an imperial symbol. During his reign, Emperor [[Isaac I Comnenus]] (1057\u201359) modified it as double-headed, influenced by traditions about such a beast in his native [[Paphlagonia]] in Asia Minor (in turn reflecting possibly much older local myths). Many modifications followed in flag details, often combined with the cross. After the recapture of Constantinople by the Byzantine Greeks in 1261, two crowns were added (over each head) representing \u2014 according to the most prevalent theory \u2014 the newly recaptured capital and the intermediate \"capital\" of the [[empire of Nicaea]].  There has been some confusion about the exact use of this symbol by the Byzantines; it appears that, at least originally, it was more a \"dynastic\" and not a \"state\" symbol (a term not fully applicable at the time, anyway), and for this reason, the colours connected with it were clearly the colours of \"imperial power\", i.e., red and yellow/gold.\n\nAfter the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]] nonetheless, the double-headed eagle remained a strong symbol of reference for the Greeks. Most characteristically, the Orthodox Church continues to use the double-headed eagle extensively as a decorative motif, and has also adopted a black eagle on yellow/gold background as its official flag.\n\nAfter the Ottoman conquest, however, this symbol also found its way to a \"new Constantinople\" (or [[Third Rome]]), i.e. [[Moscow]].  Russia, deeply influenced by the Byzantine Empire, saw herself as its heir and adopted the double-headed eagle as its imperial symbol. It was also adopted by the Serbs, the Montenegrins, the Albanians and a number of Western rulers, most notably in Germany and Austria.\n\n<gallery>\nFlag_of_the_Greek_Orthodox_Church.svg|[[File:FIAV historical.svg|23px]]Flag of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]]\nFile:Flag of Northern Epirus.PNG|{{FIAV|historical}} Flag of the [[Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus]]\nTr ponto2.gif|{{FIAV|historical}} Proposed flag for the [[Provisional Republic of Pontus|Republic of the Pontus]]\nFlag of the Greek Army.svg|Flag of the [[Hellenic Army General Staff]]\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Greece]]\n* [[Coat of arms of Greece]]\n* [[Hymn to Liberty]]\n* [[Byzantine heraldry]]\n* [[History of Greece]]\n* [[List of Greek flags]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* I.

Sang. 577, p. 165 (9th/10th centuries).]]\n'''''The Passion of Saints Perpetua and Felicity''''' ({{lang-la|Passio sanctarum Perpetuae et Felicitatis}}) is a diary by [[Vibia Perpetua]] describing her imprisonment as a Christian in 203, completed after her death by a redactor.<ref name=\"Heffernan\">{{cite book |last1=Heffernan |first1=Thomas J. |title=The passion of Perpetua and Felicity |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199777570 |doi=10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199777570.001.0001}}</ref> It is one of the oldest and most notable early Christian texts.\n\nAlong with the experiences of [[Perpetua and Felicity]], the text also appears to contain, in his own words, the accounts of the visions of Saturus, another Christian martyred with Perpetua. An editor who states he was an eyewitness has added accounts of the martyrs' suffering and deaths. It survives in both Latin and Greek forms.<ref>[[Bibliotheca Hagiographica Latina|BHL]] 6633\u20136636; [[Bibliotheca Hagiographica Graeca|BHG]] 1482.</ref> \n\n==Text and content==\n\n===Summary of the Passion text===\nThe traditional view has been that Perpetua, Felicity and the others were martyred owing to a decree of Roman emperor [[Septimius Severus]] (193\u2013211). This is based on a reference to a decree Severus is said to have issued forbidding conversions to Judaism and Christianity, but this decree is known only from one source, the [[Augustan History]], an unreliable mix of fact and fiction.<ref name=\"Tabbernee\">{{cite book|last=Tabbernee|first=William|title=Fake Prophecy and Polluted Sacraments: Ecclesiastical and Imperial Reactions to Montanism (Supplements to Vigiliae Christianae)|date=2007|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-9004158191}}</ref>{{rp|184}} Early church historian [[Eusebius]] describes Severus as a persecutor, but the [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologist]] [[Tertullian]] states that Severus was well disposed towards Christians, employed a Christian as his personal physician, and had personally intervened to save several high-born Christians known to him from [[Ochlocracy|the mob]].<ref name=Tabbernee />{{rp|184}} Eusebius' description of Severus as a persecutor likely derives merely from the fact that numerous persecutions occurred during his reign, including those known in the ''[[Roman martyrology]]'' as the martyrs of [[Madaurus|Madaura]] as well as Perpetua and Felicity in the Roman province of Africa, but these were probably as the result of local persecutions rather than empire wide actions or decrees by Severus.<ref name=Tabbernee />{{rp|185}}\n\nThe details of the martyrdoms survive in both Latin and Greek texts (see below).

After the guards are bribed, she is allowed to move to a better portion of the prison, where she nurses her child and gives its charge to her mother and brother (iii), and the child is able to stay in prison with her for the time being (iii).\n\nAt the encouragement of her brother, Perpetua asks for and receives a vision, in which she climbs a dangerous ladder to which various weapons are attached (iv). At the foot of a ladder is a serpent, which is faced first by Saturus and later by Perpetua (iv). The serpent does not harm her, and she ascends to a garden (iv). At the conclusion of her dream, Perpetua realizes that the martyrs will suffer (iv).\n\nPerpetua's father visits her in prison and pleads with her, but Perpetua remains steadfast in her faith (v). She is brought to a hearing before the governor Hilarianus and the martyrs confess their Christian faith (vi). In a second vision, Perpetua sees her brother Dinocrates, who had died unbaptized from cancer at the early age of seven (vii). She prayed for him and later had a vision of him happy and healthy, his facial disfigurement reduced to a scar (viii). Perpetua's father again visits the prison, and Pudens (the warden) shows the martyrs' honor (ix).\n\nThe day before her martyrdom, Perpetua envisions herself defeating a savage Egyptian and interprets this to mean that she would have to do battle not merely with wild beasts but with the [[Devil]] himself (x).\n\nSaturus, who is also said to have recorded his own vision, sees himself and Perpetua transported eastward by four angels to a beautiful garden, where they meet Jocundus, Saturninus, Artaxius, and Quintus, four other Christians who are burnt alive during the same persecution (xi\u2013xii). He also sees Bishop Optatus of Carthage and the priest Aspasius, who beseech the martyrs to reconcile the conflicts between them (xiii).\n\nAs the editor resumes the story, Secundulus is said to have died in prison (xiv). The slave Felicitas gives birth to a daughter despite her initial concern that she would not be permitted to suffer martyrdom with the others, since the law forbade the execution of pregnant women (xv). On the day of the games, the martyrs are led into the amphitheatre (xviii). At the demand of the crowd they were first [[scourged]] before a line of gladiators; then a boar, a bear, and a leopard were set on the men, and a wild cow on the women (xix). Wounded by the wild animals, they gave each other the [[kiss of peace]] and were then put to the sword (xix). The text describes Perpetua's death as follows; \"But Perpetua, that she might have some taste of pain, was pierced between the bones and shrieked out; and when the swordsman's hand wandered still (for he was a novice), herself set it upon her own neck. Perchance so great a woman could not else have been slain (being feared of the [[unclean spirit]]) had she not herself so willed it\" (xix). The text ends as the editor extols the acts of the martyrs. \n\nI like talons.\n\n===Debate over editor===\nScholars generally believe that the ''Passio SS Perpetuae et Felicitatis'' narrative was in fact, written by Perpetua.{{sfn|Shaw, p. 14}} If this is true, the text is important because Perpetua is one of the first Christian female writers before the fourth century whose works have survived.{{sfn|Ross, p. 1048}} The personal account of a female martyr is also rare, as the stories of other female martyrs were recorded collectively.{{sfn|Shaw, p. 14}} Perpetua's style is described as \"emotional\", \"personal\", \"fragmented\" and \"colloquial\", which is fitting with the circumstances under which she would have been writing. It should still be acknowledged that the style could have been crafted to give the impression of a female martyr's diary.{{sfn|Ross, p. 1055}}\n\nAlthough some have suggested that the editor of the text is [[Tertullian]], the editor's identity remains uncertain.{{sfn|Shaw, p. 30}} The writing style and content of the edited material do seem to suggest that the editor is male.{{sfn|Shaw, pp. 30\u201331}}\n\nMany scholars have examined the male modification and transmission of a female martyrdom story that challenged power dynamics and gender hierarchies within the organized church.{{sfn|Shaw, pp. 33, 36}} This issue of gender may have influenced the redaction tendencies of the editor. Brent Shaw argues that the editor of the story rewrites Perpetua's experience in such a way that affirms the technical value of her martyrdom while simultaneously presenting her actions as unnatural.{{sfn|Shaw, p. 36}}  Furthermore, the dream vision of Saturus is considered to be the result of editorial activity, unlikely to have been written by Saturus himself because of its distinctive construction and impersonal bent.{{sfn|Shaw, p. 32}}  If the editor is male, he may have been seeking to show that men and women, rather than women alone, are responsible for the dreams and visions received in the narrative. Others argue that Felicity may have been the initial source for the dream, an attribution changed by the editor in order to circumvent the problematic implications of a female slave who can receive visions.\n\n===Dating issues===\nThe date of their martyrdom is traditionally given as 203 AD. The association of the martyrdom with a birthday festival of the [[Publius Septimius Geta|Emperor Geta]], however, might seem to place it after 209, when Geta was made \"Augustus\" (having held the junior title ''Caesar'' since 198 when his elder brother had been made \"Augustus\"), though before 211, when he was assassinated. The ''[[Acts of the Martyrs|Acta]]'' notes that the martyrdom occurred in the year when Minucius Timinianus was proconsul in the [[Africa (province)|Roman province of Africa]], but Timinianus is not otherwise attested in history. Werner Eck notes that the Greek version of the ''Acta'' calls the proconsul \u039c\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd\u03ba\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f48\u03c0\u03c0\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2, or Minucius Opimianus, who is recorded as proconsul for 202/203.<ref>Eck, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4435445 \"Erg\u00e4nzungen zu den Fasti Consulares des 1. und 2.

In becoming a martyr, Perpetua failed to conform to society's expectations.{{sfn|Shaw, p. 25}} Perpetua and Felicity also defer their roles as mothers to remain loyal to Christ, leaving behind young children at the time of their death.{{sfn|Shaw, p. 36}}\n\nAlthough the narrator does describe Perpetua as \"honorably married\", no husband appears in the text.{{sfn|Farina, p. 52}} Possible explanations include that her husband was attempting to distance himself from the proceedings as a non-Christian, that he was away on business, or that her mention of him was edited out; because Perpetua was called the bride of Christ, omission of her husband may have been intended to reduce any sexual implications (xviii).{{sfn|Shaw, p. 31}} Regardless, the absence of a husband in the text leads Perpetua to assume new family loyalties and a new identity in relation to Christ.{{sfn|Salisbury, p. 8}}\n\nPerpetua belonged to an aristocratic family with Roman citizenship, as indicated by her name [[Vibia (gens)|Vibia]] Perpetua.{{sfn|Shaw, pp. 10\u201311}} Perpetua's execution alongside slaves demonstrated Christianity's ability to transcend social distinctions, in contrast to the inequality that pervaded Roman religion and society.{{sfn|Farina, p. 49}} As Perpetua and Felicity were equal in martyrdom despite differences in class, they made the dramatic statement that Christianity transcended social structure.{{sfn|Salisbury, p. 13}}\n\n==Evidence for Montanism in the text==\n{{Further|Montanism}}\nSome scholars believe that ''The Passion of Saints Perpetua and Felicity'' present a [[Montanism|Montanist]] theology.<ref>{{citation|last=Litfin|first=Bryan|title=Getting to Know the Church Fathers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jgEZmsn34PEC|accessdate=5 January 2013|year=2007|publisher=Brazos Press|location=Grand Rapids|isbn=978-1-58743-196-8|page=128|chapter=Perpetua}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Rex D.|title=The New Prophecy and 'New Visions': Evidence of Montanism in 'The Passion of Perpetua and Felicitas|year=2014|publisher=BorderStone Press, LLC|isbn=978-1936670963|edition=1st}}</ref>\nMontanism was a doctrine of early Christianity<ref name=\"newadvent.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10521a.htm|title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Montanists|work=newadvent.org|accessdate=16 November 2015}}</ref> that arose in [[Phrygia]], modern Turkey. The movement was founded by [[Montanus]]; a recent convert to Christianity, said by early church father Saint Jerome to have been previously a priest of Cybele,<ref name=\"newadvent.org\"/> who had shared his ideas with followers. The group emphasized a belief in the continuing presence of the Holy Spirit visible in the prophetic words of Christians.{{sfn|Salisbury, p.  156}}\n\nPerpetua and Saturus had received new dreams and prophesies within the text in accordance with the beliefs and tenets of Montanism.{{sfn|Farina, p. 76}} Further evidence for Montanism is that Perpetua and Felicity may have separated themselves from their partners in accordance with Montanist teachings, which allowed and sometimes even encouraged women to leave non-Christian husbands in favor of celibate lives devoted to preaching the Gospel.{{sfn|Farina, pp. 52\u201353}}  However, nothing in the text is explicitly Montanist. Opponents of the new prophecy accused its members of having avoided martyrdom, which makes the identification of the Passion text as Montanist less likely.{{sfn|Ross, p. 1061}}\n\nThe editor's additions may be an attempt to validate Montanist beliefs, praising prophecy and visionary gifts from the spirit.{{sfn|Salisbury, p. 158}} In the introduction for example, the editor includes a biblical reference to the sons and daughters who shall prophesy in the last days (i). The editor also asserts the importance of acknowledging and honoring both \"new prophecies\" and \"new visions\" (i).\n\nTimothy David Barnes, in his \"Tertullian: An Historical and Literal Study\" (1973, Oxford University Press), initially defended the Montanist tone of the \"Passion\" as well as of the martyrs themselves. In his second edition (1982), he retracted this opinion, concluding that \"[t]he attempt to show that the martyrs, as well as the 'Passion,' are Montanist must be pronounced unconvincing.\"<ref>p. 329, citing L. Robert, 'Une vision de Perp\u00e9tue martyre \u00e0 Carthage en 203.' CRAI 1982. 228\u201376.; J.R. Matthews, JTS, N.S. XXIV (1973), 248/9: \"What matters for Barnes's argument [in the first edition of 'Tertullian'] is that the martyrs themselves should be shown up as Montanists. According to Barnes, they are. But the grounds do not seem adequate. Two features are isolated as 'suspect': the eagerness of Perpetua and her companions for martyrdom, and the spiritual ascendancy, implicit in two passages of the 'Passio,' of confessors over the established clergy. Yet elsewhere, zeal for martyrdom is explained as a central feature of African Christianity from its known beginnings. Montanism in itself, according to Barnes, helped Tertullian resolve an ambiguity in his own attitude to martyrdom \u2013 but can it be argued to have acquired the monopoly? As for the ascendancy of martyrs over the clergy, this was an issue of spiritual authority by no means confined to Montanists. According to Barnes, Tertullian derided the Catholics (in later works) for attributing authority to their martyrs and confessors.\"</ref> Every single one of the purported \"Montanist\" features of the \"Passion\" were (and remain today) utterly compatible with orthodox Catholicism.\n\n==Controversy over Dinocrates==\nThe account of Saint Perpetua comforting her dead brother has been a point of controversy. The text specifically says that the child had not been baptized. Renatus used this account to bolster his claim that unbaptized infants could attain paradise, if not the kingdom of heaven. Augustine in turn proposed an explanation for how Dinocrates could have been baptized but later estranged from Christ by his pagan father.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicfirst.com/thefaith/churchfathers/volume14/augustin1412.html|title=Church Fathers Volume 14 Augustin|work=catholicfirst.com|accessdate=16 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe once-flowering rambling rose \"F\u00e9licit\u00e9 et Perp\u00e9tue\" (''R. sempervirens'' x 'Old Blush'<ref>Its French equivalent name is R.

Perpetua's father again visits the prison, and Pudens (the warden) shows the martyrs' honor (ix).\n\nThe day before her martyrdom, Perpetua envisions herself defeating a savage Egyptian and interprets this to mean that she would have to do battle not merely with wild beasts but with the [[Devil]] himself (x).\n\nSaturus, who is also said to have recorded his own vision, sees himself and Perpetua transported eastward by four angels to a beautiful garden, where they meet Jocundus, Saturninus, Artaxius, and Quintus, four other Christians who are burnt alive during the same persecution (xi\u2013xii). He also sees Bishop Optatus of Carthage and the priest Aspasius, who beseech the martyrs to reconcile the conflicts between them (xiii).\n\nAs the editor resumes the story, Secundulus is said to have died in prison (xiv). The slave Felicitas gives birth to a daughter despite her initial concern that she would not be permitted to suffer martyrdom with the others, since the law forbade the execution of pregnant women (xv). On the day of the games, the martyrs are led into the amphitheatre (xviii). At the demand of the crowd they were first [[scourged]] before a line of gladiators; then a boar, a bear, and a leopard were set on the men, and a wild cow on the women (xix). Wounded by the wild animals, they gave each other the [[kiss of peace]] and were then put to the sword (xix). The text describes Perpetua's death as follows; \"But Perpetua, that she might have some taste of pain, was pierced between the bones and shrieked out; and when the swordsman's hand wandered still (for he was a novice), herself set it upon her own neck. Perchance so great a woman could not else have been slain (being feared of the [[unclean spirit]]) had she not herself so willed it\" (xix). The text ends as the editor extols the acts of the martyrs.\n\n===Debate over editor===\nScholars generally believe that the ''Passio SS Perpetuae et Felicitatis'' narrative was in fact, written by Perpetua.{{sfn|Shaw, p. 14}} If this is true, the text is important because Perpetua is one of the first Christian female writers before the fourth century whose works have survived.{{sfn|Ross, p. 1048}} The personal account of a female martyr is also rare, as the stories of other female martyrs were recorded collectively.{{sfn|Shaw, p. 14}} Perpetua's style is described as \"emotional\", \"personal\", \"fragmented\" and \"colloquial\", which is fitting with the circumstances under which she would have been writing. It should still be acknowledged that the style could have been crafted to give the impression of a female martyr's diary.{{sfn|Ross, p. 1055}}\n\nAlthough some have suggested that the editor of the text is [[Tertullian]], the editor's identity remains uncertain.{{sfn|Shaw, p. 30}} The writing style and content of the edited material do seem to suggest that the editor is male.{{sfn|Shaw, pp. 30\u201331}}\n\nMany scholars have examined the male modification and transmission of a female martyrdom story that challenged power dynamics and gender hierarchies within the organized church.{{sfn|Shaw, pp. 33, 36}} This issue of gender may have influenced the redaction tendencies of the editor. Brent Shaw argues that the editor of the story rewrites Perpetua's experience in such a way that affirms the technical value of her martyrdom while simultaneously presenting her actions as unnatural.{{sfn|Shaw, p. 36}}  Furthermore, the dream vision of Saturus is considered to be the result of editorial activity, unlikely to have been written by Saturus himself because of its distinctive construction and impersonal bent.{{sfn|Shaw, p. 32}}  If the editor is male, he may have been seeking to show that men and women, rather than women alone, are responsible for the dreams and visions received in the narrative. Others argue that Felicity may have been the initial source for the dream, an attribution changed by the editor in order to circumvent the problematic implications of a female slave who can receive visions.\n\n===Dating issues===\nThe date of their martyrdom is traditionally given as 203 AD. The association of the martyrdom with a birthday festival of the [[Publius Septimius Geta|Emperor Geta]], however, might seem to place it after 209, when Geta was made \"Augustus\" (having held the junior title ''Caesar'' since 198 when his elder brother had been made \"Augustus\"), though before 211, when he was assassinated. The ''[[Acts of the Martyrs|Acta]]'' notes that the martyrdom occurred in the year when Minucius Timinianus was proconsul in the [[Africa (province)|Roman province of Africa]], but Timinianus is not otherwise attested in history. Werner Eck notes that the Greek version of the ''Acta'' calls the proconsul \u039c\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd\u03ba\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f48\u03c0\u03c0\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2, or Minucius Opimianus, who is recorded as proconsul for 202/203.<ref>Eck, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4435445 \"Erg\u00e4nzungen zu den Fasti Consulares des 1. und 2.

In becoming a martyr, Perpetua failed to conform to society's expectations.{{sfn|Shaw, p. 25}} Perpetua and Felicity also defer their roles as mothers to remain loyal to Christ, leaving behind young children at the time of their death.{{sfn|Shaw, p. 36}}\n\nAlthough the narrator does describe Perpetua as \"honorably married\", no husband appears in the text.{{sfn|Farina, p. 52}} Possible explanations include that her husband was attempting to distance himself from the proceedings as a non-Christian, that he was away on business, or that her mention of him was edited out; because Perpetua was called the bride of Christ, omission of her husband may have been intended to reduce any sexual implications (xviii).{{sfn|Shaw, p. 31}} Regardless, the absence of a husband in the text leads Perpetua to assume new family loyalties and a new identity in relation to Christ.{{sfn|Salisbury, p. 8}}\n\nPerpetua belonged to an aristocratic family with Roman citizenship, as indicated by her name [[Vibia (gens)|Vibia]] Perpetua.{{sfn|Shaw, pp. 10\u201311}} Perpetua's execution alongside slaves demonstrated Christianity's ability to transcend social distinctions, in contrast to the inequality that pervaded Roman religion and society.{{sfn|Farina, p. 49}} As Perpetua and Felicity were equal in martyrdom despite differences in class, they made the dramatic statement that Christianity transcended social structure.{{sfn|Salisbury, p. 13}}\n\n==Evidence for Montanism in the text==\n{{Further|Montanism}}\nSome scholars believe that ''The Passion of Saints Perpetua and Felicity'' present a [[Montanism|Montanist]] theology.<ref>{{citation|last=Litfin|first=Bryan|title=Getting to Know the Church Fathers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jgEZmsn34PEC|accessdate=5 January 2013|year=2007|publisher=Brazos Press|location=Grand Rapids|isbn=978-1-58743-196-8|page=128|chapter=Perpetua}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Rex D.|title=The New Prophecy and 'New Visions': Evidence of Montanism in 'The Passion of Perpetua and Felicitas|year=2014|publisher=BorderStone Press, LLC|isbn=978-1936670963|edition=1st}}</ref>\nMontanism was a doctrine of early Christianity<ref name=\"newadvent.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10521a.htm|title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Montanists|work=newadvent.org|accessdate=16 November 2015}}</ref> that arose in [[Phrygia]], modern Turkey. The movement was founded by [[Montanus]]; a recent convert to Christianity, said by early church father Saint Jerome to have been previously a priest of Cybele,<ref name=\"newadvent.org\"/> who had shared his ideas with followers. The group emphasized a belief in the continuing presence of the Holy Spirit visible in the prophetic words of Christians.{{sfn|Salisbury, p.  156}}\n\nPerpetua and Saturus had received new dreams and prophesies within the text in accordance with the beliefs and tenets of Montanism.{{sfn|Farina, p. 76}} Further evidence for Montanism is that Perpetua and Felicity may have separated themselves from their partners in accordance with Montanist teachings, which allowed and sometimes even encouraged women to leave non-Christian husbands in favor of celibate lives devoted to preaching the Gospel.{{sfn|Farina, pp. 52\u201353}}  However, nothing in the text is explicitly Montanist. Opponents of the new prophecy accused its members of having avoided martyrdom, which makes the identification of the Passion text as Montanist less likely.{{sfn|Ross, p. 1061}}\n\nThe editor's additions may be an attempt to validate Montanist beliefs, praising prophecy and visionary gifts from the spirit.{{sfn|Salisbury, p. 158}} In the introduction for example, the editor includes a biblical reference to the sons and daughters who shall prophesy in the last days (i). The editor also asserts the importance of acknowledging and honoring both \"new prophecies\" and \"new visions\" (i).\n\nTimothy David Barnes, in his \"Tertullian: An Historical and Literal Study\" (1973, Oxford University Press), initially defended the Montanist tone of the \"Passion\" as well as of the martyrs themselves. In his second edition (1982), he retracted this opinion, concluding that \"[t]he attempt to show that the martyrs, as well as the 'Passion,' are Montanist must be pronounced unconvincing.\"<ref>p. 329, citing L. Robert, 'Une vision de Perp\u00e9tue martyre \u00e0 Carthage en 203.' CRAI 1982. 228\u201376.; J.R. Matthews, JTS, N.S. XXIV (1973), 248/9: \"What matters for Barnes's argument [in the first edition of 'Tertullian'] is that the martyrs themselves should be shown up as Montanists. According to Barnes, they are. But the grounds do not seem adequate. Two features are isolated as 'suspect': the eagerness of Perpetua and her companions for martyrdom, and the spiritual ascendancy, implicit in two passages of the 'Passio,' of confessors over the established clergy. Yet elsewhere, zeal for martyrdom is explained as a central feature of African Christianity from its known beginnings. Montanism in itself, according to Barnes, helped Tertullian resolve an ambiguity in his own attitude to martyrdom \u2013 but can it be argued to have acquired the monopoly? As for the ascendancy of martyrs over the clergy, this was an issue of spiritual authority by no means confined to Montanists. According to Barnes, Tertullian derided the Catholics (in later works) for attributing authority to their martyrs and confessors.\"</ref> Every single one of the purported \"Montanist\" features of the \"Passion\" were (and remain today) utterly compatible with orthodox Catholicism.\n\n==Controversy over Dinocrates==\nThe account of Saint Perpetua comforting her dead brother has been a point of controversy. The text specifically says that the child had not been baptized. Renatus used this account to bolster his claim that unbaptized infants could attain paradise, if not the kingdom of heaven. Augustine in turn proposed an explanation for how Dinocrates could have been baptized but later estranged from Christ by his pagan father.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicfirst.com/thefaith/churchfathers/volume14/augustin1412.html|title=Church Fathers Volume 14 Augustin|work=catholicfirst.com|accessdate=16 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe once-flowering rambling rose \"F\u00e9licit\u00e9 et Perp\u00e9tue\" (''R. sempervirens'' x 'Old Blush'<ref>Its French equivalent name is R.

This pipe organ is very deteriorated. A new pipe organ was inaugurated in 2010 and follows the design of the Catalan pipe organs that are located next to the Church. It is an important work of Catalan musical craftsmanship that places Montserrat at an international musical level. This pipe organ is designed by [[Albert Blancafort]], built by ''Blancafort, orgueners de Montserrat,'' and financed by popular subscription and the social work of the ''Caixa de Penedes''. The pipe organ is located on the side of the nave, as is traditional in Catalonia, offering a very good sound throughout the temple.\n\n=== Cloister ===\n\nThe cloister of the monastery is the work of the architect [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]] (1929). It is two floors, supported by stone columns. The lower floor communicates with the garden and has a fountain in its central area. On the walls of the cloister, the visitor can see old pieces, some of 10th century. The extensive garden includes the Chapel of Sant Iscle and Santa Vict\u00f2ria, Romanesque, access to the buildings of the novitiate and the choir and several sculptures, such as the marble of the \"Good Shepherd\" of [[Manolo (sculptor)|Manolo Hugu\u00e9]] or some of the sculptures that [[Josep de San Benet]] made in the 18th century for the bell tower of the monastery and that were never installed.\n\n=== Refectory ===\nThe refectory is from the 17th century and it was rebuilt in 1925 by Puig i Cadafalch. The central part has a mosaic that represents Christ, while in the opposite area the visitor can see a triptych with scenes from the life of St. Benedict.\n\n=== Museum ===\n{{Main|Museum of Montserrat}}\nThe monastery has an important museum divided into three different sections:\n\n* Modern painting, with works by artists from Catalonia such as [[Santiago Rusi\u00f1ol]], [[Ramon Casas]], [[Isidre Nonell]], [[Joaquim Mir]], [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], [[Joan Mir\u00f3]] and [[Antoni T\u00e0pies]], and non-Catalans like [[Pablo Picasso]] or the painter [[Dar\u00edo de Regoyos]], Asturian, who was the only painter linked to the European impressionist and neo-impressionist movements; as well as a representation of French [[impressionism]], with authors such as [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Alfred Sisley]] and [[Edgar Degas]].\n* Archeology of the biblical East, showing objects of [[Egypt]], [[Cyprus]], [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Holy Land]].\n* Ancient painting, showing works by authors such as [[El Greco]], [[Caravaggio]] (from this author, an important ''St. Jerome''), [[Luca Giordano]], [[Giambattista Tiepolo]] and [[Pedro Berruguete]].\n\nOther collections include Montserrat iconography and religious goldsmithing.<ref>{{Harvsp|Molas i Rif\u00e0|1998|pp = 42-43.}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe legend places the finding of the statue of the Virgin of Montserrat around 880.<ref>{{Harvsp|Molas i Rif\u00e0|1998|p = 12.}}</ref> Then began the cult of the ''Moreneta'' virgin, which materialized in four earlier hermitages in the 9th century: Santa Maria, Sant Iscle, Sant Pere and Sant Mart\u00ed. However, the origin of the monastery is uncertain. It is known that around 1011 a monk from the [[Santa Maria de Ripoll|monastery of Santa Maria de Ripoll]] came to the mountain to take charge of the monastery of [[Santa Cec\u00edlia de Montserrat]], thus leaving the monastery under the orders of [[Abbot Oliba]] of Ripoll. Santa Cec\u00edlia did not accept this new situation, so Oliba decided to found the monastery of Santa Maria in the place where there was an old hermitage of the same name (1025). As of 1082, Santa Maria became an abbot of her own and ceased to depend on the abbot of Ripoll. This hermitage had become the most important of all those that existed in the [[Montserrat (mountain)|mountain]] thanks to the statue of the Virgin that was venerated in it since 880.\n\nIn 1811 and in 1812, the abbey was twice burned down and sacked by Napoleon's troops, and many of its treasures were lost. In 1835, the abbey was closed until restoration in 1844. \n\nIn 1880, Montserrat celebrated 1000 years of existence. On 11 September 1881, to coincide with the Catalan national day Pope Leo XIII proclaimed the Virgin of Montserrat patron of Catalonia.\n\n;Spanish Civil War \n[[File:1 montserrat Santa Maria de Montserrat Abbey Funicular de Sant Joan 2014.jpg|thumb|The abbey as seen from the [[Funicular de Sant Joan]]]]\n\nThe [[Spanish Civil War]] saw the violent suppression of the Abbey of Montserrat.

They created and promoted, among others, some children's publications (L'Infantil, Tretzevents) and some cultural and religious journals (Serra d'Or, Q\u00fcestions de vida cristiana). In 1958, tile Abbey founded the Estela Press to promote religious books in Catalan (Masot i Muntaner, 1986).  In 1971 the PAM Press (Publications of the Montserrat's Abbey) became official (Faul\u00ed, 1999, pp. 35\u20139).

The facade was realized in 1901, work of [[Francisco de Paula del Villar y Carmona]] in [[Plateresque#Plateresque_Revival|Plateresque Revival]] style, with sculptural reliefs of [[Venanci Vallmitjana i Barbany|Venanci]] and [[Agapit Vallmitjana i Barbany]].\n\nAfter the [[Spanish Civil War]] a new fa\u00e7ade of the church was built (between 1942 and 1968),<ref name=\"official guide\">{{cite book|last=Molas i Rif\u00e0|first=Jordi|title=Gu\u00eda oficial de Montserrat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7peOoMR3cAC&pg=RA1-PR5|year=1998|publisher=L'Abadia de Montserrat|isbn=978-84-7826-956-3}}</ref> the work of [[Francesc Folguera i Grassi]] and decorated with sculptural reliefs of [[Joan Rebull]] (''St. Benedict'', ''Proclamation of the dogma of the Assumption of Mary by Pius XII'' and ''St. George'', with a representation of the monks who died during the Spanish Civil War), as well as the inscription ''Urbs Jerusalem Beata Dicta Pacis Visio'' (\"Blessed city of Jerusalem, called the vision of peace\"). At the foot of the frieze with the relief of St. George is sculpted the phrase \"Catalonia will be Christian or it will not be\", attributed to the bishop [[Josep Torras i Bages]], which has been assumed as a political motto of Catholic root.\n\nThis facade precedes the church proper, which is accessed through an atrium. Here are the 16th century sepulchres<ref name=\"official guide\"/> of [[Juan de Arag\u00f3n y de Jonqueras, 2nd count of Ribagorza]] and [[Bernat II of Vilamar\u00ed]].  There are also several sculptures: ''St. John the Baptist'' and ''St. Joseph'' (1952),<ref name=\"official guide\"/> of [[Josep Clar\u00e0]], and ''St. Benedict'' (1962),<ref name=\"official guide\"/> by [[Dom\u00e8nec Fita i Molat]]. There are also the paintings ''Visit of the Catholic Monarchs to Montserrat'' and ''Visit of Don John of Austria to Montserrat'' (1921)<ref name=\"official guide\"/> by [[Francesc Fornells-Pla]]. The square that precedes the church (called del Abat Argeric, built in 18th century)<ref name=\"official guide\"/> is decorated with [[sgraffito]]s (1956)<ref name=\"official guide\"/> of [[Josep Obiols i Palau]] and the friar [[Benet Mart\u00ednez]], which represent the history of Montserrat and the main basilicas of the world. The square also houses various sculptures: ''St. Anthony Mary Claret'' (1954),<ref name=\"official guide\"/> by [[Rafael Solanic]]; ''John I of Aragon'' (1956)<ref name=\"official guide\"/> and ''St. Gregory the Great'' (1957),<ref name=\"official guide\"/> by [[Frederic Mar\u00e8s]]; and ''St. Pius X'', by F.

Next to the baptistery there is a sculpture of ''St. Ignatius of Loyola'', a work by Rafael Solanic..<ref>{{Harvsp|Molas i Rif\u00e0|1998|pp = 25-27.}}</ref>\n\nThe church is of a single [[nave]], 68.32 meters long and 21.50 wide, with a height of 33.33 meters. It is supported by central [[column]]s, carved in wood by [[Josep Llimona i Bruguera]], representing the prophets [[Isaiah]], [[Jeremiah]], [[Ezekiel]] and [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]]. At the head is the main altar, decorated with [[vitreous enamel|enamels]] (1928) of [[Montserrat Mainar]], depicting various [[Bible|biblical]] scenes, such as ''The Last Supper'', ''The Weddings of Cana'' and ''The Multiplication of Loaves and Fishes''. The 15th century cross on the altar is the work of [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]]. On the altar there is a [[shrine]] of [[octagon|octagonal]] form. In the [[chancel]] there are various paintings by [[Alexandre de Riquer]], [[Joan Llimona]], [[Joaquim Vancells]], [[Dion\u00eds Baixeras]] and [[Llu\u00eds Graner]].<ref>{{Harvsp|Molas i Rif\u00e0|1998|p = 32.}}</ref>\n\nJust above the main altar is located the room of the Virgin that is accessed after crossing a portal of [[alabaster]] (Porta Ang\u00e8lica) in which are represented various biblical scenes, work of [[Enric Monjo]] (1954)<ref name=\"official guide\"/>. The [[mosaic]]s on the walls represent the ''Saints Mothers'' (left) and the ''Saints V\u00edrgins'' (right), the work of the friar Benet Mart\u00ednez. Next comes the Throne Room (1944-1954)<ref name=\"official guide\"/>, the work of Francesc Folguera, decorated with paintings by [[Josep Obiols]] (''Judit who Cuts Off Holofernes's Head'', ''Esther's Wedding with the Persian King Asuero'') and [[Carlo Maratta]] (''Birth of Jesus''). The Fountain of the Virgin is also found here, with reliefs of Charles Collet representing the miracles of [[Jesus]]. The Throne of the Virgin is embossed silver, work of the goldsmith Ramon Sunyer, with two reliefs made by Alfons Serrahima and designed by [[Joaquim Ros i Bofarull]] that represent the ''Nativity'' and the ''Visitation'', and an image of ''St. Michael'' by [[Josep Granyer]]. Here is a 12th century statue of the Virgin on which are placed some angels that hold the crown, the scepter and the lily of the Virgin, the work of [[Mart\u00ed Llaurad\u00f3 i Mariscot|Mart\u00ed Llaurad\u00f3]],<ref name=\"official guide\"/> covered by a [[baldachin]]. The Sala del Cambril is a circular chapel with three [[apse]]s, built between 1876 and 1884 by Villar i Carmona with the collaboration of his assistant, a young [[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]].  The [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] is decorated by [[Joan Llimona]] (''The Virgin Welcomes the Romeros'') and the figures of angels and the sculpture of [[Saint George|St. George]] are of Agapit Vallmitjana. The windows are of [[Antoni Rigalt i Blanch]].<ref>{{Harvsp|Molas i Rif\u00e0|1998|pp = 34-39.}}</ref> The exit of the room is carried out by the Cam\u00ed de l'Ave Maria, where it is customary to make offerings in the form of candles. Here stands out a statue of the ''Angel of the Annunciation'' by [[Apel\u00b7les Fenosa]], as well as a [[maiolica]] ceramic depicting the Virgin, the work of [[Joan Guivernau]].<ref>{{Harvsp|Molas i Rif\u00e0|1998|pp = 40-41.}}</ref>\n\nAround the central nave there are several [[chapel]]s.

This pipe organ is very deteriorated. A new pipe organ was inaugurated in 2010 and follows the design of the Catalan pipe organs that are located next to the Church. It is an important work of Catalan musical craftsmanship that places Montserrat at an international musical level. This pipe organ is designed by [[Albert Blancafort]], built by ''Blancafort, orgueners de Montserrat,'' and financed by popular subscription and the social work of the ''Caixa de Penedes''. The pipe organ is located on the side of the nave, as is traditional in Catalonia, offering a very good sound throughout the temple.\n\n=== Cloister ===\n\nThe cloister of the monastery is the work of the architect [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]] (1929). It is two floors, supported by stone columns. The lower floor communicates with the garden and has a fountain in its central area. On the walls of the cloister, the visitor can see old pieces, some of 10th century. The extensive garden includes the Chapel of Sant Iscle and Santa Vict\u00f2ria, Romanesque, access to the buildings of the novitiate and the choir and several sculptures, such as the marble of the \"Good Shepherd\" of [[Manolo (sculptor)|Manolo Hugu\u00e9]] or some of the sculptures that [[Josep de San Benet]] made in the 18th century for the bell tower of the monastery and that were never installed.\n\n=== Refectory ===\nThe refectory is from the 17th century and it was rebuilt in 1925 by Puig i Cadafalch. The central part has a mosaic that represents Christ, while in the opposite area the visitor can see a triptych with scenes from the life of St. Benedict.\n\n=== Museum ===\n{{Main|Museum of Montserrat}}\nThe monastery has an important museum divided into three different sections:\n\n* Modern painting, with works by artists from Catalonia such as [[Santiago Rusi\u00f1ol]], [[Ramon Casas]], [[Isidre Nonell]], [[Joaquim Mir]], [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], [[Joan Mir\u00f3]] and [[Antoni T\u00e0pies]], and non-Catalans like [[Pablo Picasso]] or the painter [[Dar\u00edo de Regoyos]], Asturian, who was the only painter linked to the European impressionist and neo-impressionist movements; as well as a representation of French [[impressionism]], with authors such as [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Alfred Sisley]] and [[Edgar Degas]].\n* Archeology of the biblical East, showing objects of [[Egypt]], [[Cyprus]], [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Holy Land]].\n* Ancient painting, showing works by authors such as [[El Greco]], [[Caravaggio]] (from this author, an important ''St. Jerome''), [[Luca Giordano]], [[Giambattista Tiepolo]] and [[Pedro Berruguete]].\n\nOther collections include Montserrat iconography and religious goldsmithing.<ref>{{Harvsp|Molas i Rif\u00e0|1998|pp = 42-43.}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe legend places the finding of the statue of the Virgin of Montserrat around 880.<ref>{{Harvsp|Molas i Rif\u00e0|1998|p = 12.}}</ref> Then began the cult of the ''Moreneta'' virgin, which materialized in four earlier hermitages in the 9th century: Santa Maria, Sant Iscle, Sant Pere and Sant Mart\u00ed. However, the origin of the monastery is uncertain. It is known that around 1011 a monk from the [[Santa Maria de Ripoll|monastery of Santa Maria de Ripoll]] came to the mountain to take charge of the monastery of [[Santa Cec\u00edlia de Montserrat]], thus leaving the monastery under the orders of [[Abbot Oliba]] of Ripoll. Santa Cec\u00edlia did not accept this new situation, so Oliba decided to found the monastery of Santa Maria in the place where there was an old hermitage of the same name (1025). As of 1082, Santa Maria became an abbot of her own and ceased to depend on the abbot of Ripoll. This hermitage had become the most important of all those that existed in the [[Montserrat (mountain)|mountain]] thanks to the statue of the Virgin that was venerated in it since 880.\n\nIn 1811 and in 1812, the abbey was twice burned down and sacked by Napoleon's troops, and many of its treasures were lost. In 1835, the abbey was closed until restoration in 1844. \n\nIn 1880, Montserrat celebrated 1000 years of existence. On 11 September 1881, to coincide with the Catalan national day Pope Leo XIII proclaimed the Virgin of Montserrat patron of Catalonia.\n\n;Spanish Civil War \n[[File:1 montserrat Santa Maria de Montserrat Abbey Funicular de Sant Joan 2014.jpg|thumb|The abbey as seen from the [[Funicular de Sant Joan]]]]\n\nThe [[Spanish Civil War]] saw the violent suppression of the Abbey of Montserrat.

They created and promoted, among others, some children's publications (L'Infantil, Tretzevents) and some cultural and religious journals (Serra d'Or, Q\u00fcestions de vida cristiana). In 1958, tile Abbey founded the Estela Press to promote religious books in Catalan (Masot i Muntaner, 1986).  In 1971 the PAM Press (Publications of the Montserrat's Abbey) became official (Faul\u00ed, 1999, pp. 35\u20139). The Abbey was also active in providing shelter to intellectuals and clandestine political activists from a wide political spectrum.<ref>Guibernau, Montserrat.
