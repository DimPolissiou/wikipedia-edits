In Germany, Marxist [[social democracy]] was the political perspective of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]], inspiring Russian Marxists, such as Lenin.<ref name=lih1>{{cite book|last=Lih|first=Lars|title=Lenin Rediscovered: What is to be Done? in Context|year=2005|publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|isbn=978-90-04-13120-0}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, the socio-economic backwardness of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] (1721\u20131917) \u2014 combined and uneven economic development \u2014 facilitated rapid and intensive industrialisation, which produced a united, working-class [[proletariat]] in a predominantly agrarian society. Moreover, because the industrialisation was financed mostly with foreign capital, Imperial Russia did not possess a revolutionary [[bourgeoisie]] with political and economic influence upon the workers and the peasants, as had been the case in the [[French Revolution]] (1789\u20131799), in the 18th century. Although Russia's [[political economy]] was agrarian and [[Feudalism|semi-feudal]], the task of democratic revolution fell to the urban, industrial working class as the only [[social class]] capable of effecting [[land reform]] and democratization, in view that the Russian bourgeoisie would suppress any revolution.\n\nIn the ''[[April Theses]]'' (1917), the political strategy of the [[October Revolution]] (7\u20138 November 1917), Lenin proposed that the Russian revolution was not an isolated national event, but a fundamentally international event \u2014 the first socialist revolution in the world. Lenin's practical application of [[Marxism]] and [[proletarian revolution]] to the social, political, and economic conditions of agrarian Russia motivated and impelled the \"revolutionary nationalism of the poor\" to depose the [[absolute monarchy]] of the three-hundred-year dynasty of the [[House of Romanov]] (1613\u20131917), as [[Tsarism|tsars]] of Russia.<ref>''Faces of Janus'' p. 133.</ref>\n\n=== Imperialism ===\nIn ''[[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism]]'' (1916) Lenin\u2019s economic analyses indicated that capitalism would transform into a [[global financial system]], by which industrialised countries exported [[financial capital]] to their [[Colonialism|colonies]] and so realise the [[exploitation of labour]] of the natives and the exploitation of the natural resources of their countries. That such [[Superprofit|superexploitation]] allows wealthy countries to maintain a domestic [[labour aristocracy]] with a slightly higher standard of living than the majority of workers, and so ensure peaceful labour\u2013capital relations in the capitalist homeland. Therefore, a [[proletarian revolution]] of workers and peasants could not occur in capitalist countries whilst the imperialist global-finance system remained in place. The first proletarian revolution would have to occur in an under-developed country, such as Imperial Russia, which was the politically weakest country in the capitalist global-finance system in the early 20th century.<ref name=tomasic>Tomasic, D. \"The Impact of Russian Culture on Soviet Communism\" (1953), ''The Western Political Quarterly'', vol. 6, No. 4 December, pp. 808\u2013809.</ref> In the ''United States of Europe Slogan'' (1915), Lenin said: {{quotation|[[Workers of the world, unite!]] \u2014 Uneven economic and political development is an absolute law of capitalism. Hence the victory of socialism is possible, first in several, or even in one capitalist country taken separately. The victorious proletariat of that country, having expropriated the capitalists and organised its own socialist production, would stand up against the rest of the world, the capitalist world.|''Collected Works'', vol. 18, p. 232<ref>Lenin, V. I., ''United States of Europe Slogan'', ''Collected Works'', vol. 18, p. 232.</ref>|source=}}\n\nIn ''[[Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder]]'' (1920), Lenin said: {{quotation|The more powerful enemy can be vanquished only by exerting the utmost effort, and by the most thorough, careful, attentive, skillful and obligatory use of any, even the smallest, rift between the enemies, any conflict of interests among the bourgeoisie of the various countries and among the various groups or types of bourgeoisie within the various countries, and also by taking advantage of any, even the smallest, opportunity of winning a mass ally, even though this ally is temporary, vacillating, unstable, unreliable and conditional. Those who do not understand this reveal a failure to understand even the smallest grain of Marxism, of modern [[scientific socialism]] in general. Those who have not proved in practice, over a fairly considerable period of time and in fairly varied political situations, their ability to apply this truth in practice have not yet learned to help the revolutionary class in its struggle to emancipate all toiling humanity from the exploiters. And this applies equally to the period before and after the proletariat has won political power.|''Collected Works'', vol. 31, p. 23<ref>{{cite book|title=Left-Wing Communism: an Infantile Disorder|chapter=No Compromises?|first=Vladimir|last=Lenin|author-link=Vladimir Lenin|publisher=Progress Publishers|year=1920|place=[[Soviet Union]]|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/lwc/index.htm|chapterurl=http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/lwc/ch08.htm|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>|source=}}\n\n== Leninist praxis ==\n{{Leninism sidebar|expanded=all}}\n\n=== Vanguard party ===\n{{main|Vanguardism}}\nIn Chapter II: \"Proletarians and Communists\" of ''The Communist Manifesto'' (1848), Marx and Engels present the communist party as the political vanguard solely qualified to lead the proletariat in revolution: {{quotation|The Communists, therefore, are, on the one hand, practically the most advanced and resolute section of the working-class parties of every country, that section which pushes forward all others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the lines of march, the conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement. The immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all other proletarian parties: Formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of political power by the proletariat.}}\n\nThe revolutionary purpose of the Leninist [[vanguard party]] is to establish the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] with the support of the [[working class]]. The Communist Party would lead the popular deposition of the [[Tsarism|Tsarist]] government and then transfer power of government to the working class; that change of ruling class \u2014 from the [[bourgeoisie]] to the [[proletariat]] \u2014 makes possible the establishment of [[socialism]].<ref>Townson, D. ''The New Penguin Dictionary of Modern History: 1789\u20131945''. London:1994. pp. 462\u2013464.</ref> In ''[[What Is To Be Done?]]'' (1902), Lenin said that a revolutionary vanguard party, recruited from the working class, should lead the political campaign, because only in that way would the proletariat successfully realise their revolution; unlike the economic campaign of trade-union-struggle advocated by other socialist political parties and the [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalists]]. Like Marx, Lenin distinguished between the aspects of a revolution, the \"economic campaign\" (labour strikes for increased wages and work concessions) that featured diffused plural leadership; and the \"political campaign\" (socialist changes to society), which required the decisive, revolutionary leadership of the Bolshevik vanguard party.\n\n==== Democratic centralism ====\n{{main|Democratic centralism}}\nBased upon the [[First International]] (IWA, International Workingmen's Association, 1864\u20131876), Lenin organised the Bolsheviks as a [[Democratic centralism|democratically centralised]] vanguard party, wherein free political-speech was recognised legitimate until policy consensus; afterwards, every member of the Party was expected to abide the agreed policy. Democratic debate was Bolshevik practice, even after Lenin banned factions among the Party in 1921. Despite being a guiding political influence, Lenin did not exercise absolute power, and continually debated to have his points of view accepted as a course of revolutionary action. In ''Freedom to Criticise and Unity of Action'' (1905), Lenin said: {{quotation|Of course, the application of this principle in practice will sometimes give rise to disputes and misunderstandings; but only on the basis of this principle can all disputes and all misunderstandings be settled honourably for the Party. [...] The principle of democratic centralism and autonomy for local Party organisations implies universal and full freedom to criticise, so long as this does not disturb the unity of a definite action; it rules out all criticism which disrupts or makes difficult the unity of an action decided on by the Party.<ref>Lenin, V.I.

The Trotskyist demands countered Stalin's political dominance of the Communist Party, which was officially characterised by the \"[[Cult of personality|cult of Lenin]]\", the rejection of permanent revolution, and advocated the doctrine of [[socialism in one country]]. The Stalinist economic policy vacillated between appeasing the capitalist interests of the [[kulak]] in the countryside and destroying them as a social class. Initially, the Stalinists also rejected the national industrialisation of Russia, but then pursued it in full, sometimes brutally. In both cases, the Left Opposition denounced the regressive nature of Stalin's policy towards the wealthy kulak social class, and the brutality of forced industrialisation. Trotsky described Stailinist vacillation as a symptom of the undemocratic nature of a ruling bureaucracy.<ref>Trotsky, L.D. (1938) ''The Revolution Betrayed''.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1920s and the 1930s, Stalin fought and defeated the political influence of Trotsky and the Trotskyists in Russia, by means of slander, [[antisemitism]], and [[censorship]], expulsions, exile (internal and external), and imprisonment. The anti\u2013Trotsky campaign culminated in the executions (official and unofficial) of the [[Moscow Trials]] (1936\u20131938), which were part of the [[Great Purge]] of [[Old Bolshevik]]s who had led the Revolution).<ref name=\"Deutscher 1959\"/><ref>Rogovin, Vadim Z.

Left communism criticizes the ideology that the [[Bolshevik Party]] practised as the revolutionary vanguard.

In Germany, Marxist [[social democracy]] was the political perspective of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]], inspiring Russian Marxists, such as Lenin.<ref name=lih1>{{cite book|last=Lih|first=Lars|title=Lenin Rediscovered: What is to be Done? in Context|year=2005|publisher=Brill Academic Publishers|isbn=978-90-04-13120-0}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, the socio-economic backwardness of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] (1721\u20131917) \u2014 combined and uneven economic development \u2014 facilitated rapid and intensive industrialisation, which produced a united, working-class [[proletariat]] in a predominantly agrarian society. Moreover, because the industrialisation was financed mostly with foreign capital, Imperial Russia did not possess a revolutionary [[bourgeoisie]] with political and economic influence upon the workers and the peasants, as had been the case in the [[French Revolution]] (1789\u20131799), in the 18th century. Although Russia's [[political economy]] was agrarian and [[Feudalism|semi-feudal]], the task of democratic revolution fell to the urban, industrial working class as the only [[social class]] capable of effecting [[land reform]] and democratization, in view that the Russian bourgeoisie would suppress any revolution.\n\nIn the ''[[April Theses]]'' (1917), the political strategy of the [[October Revolution]] (7\u20138 November 1917), Lenin proposed that the Russian revolution was not an isolated national event, but a fundamentally international event \u2014 the first socialist revolution in the world. Lenin's practical application of [[Marxism]] and [[proletarian revolution]] to the social, political, and economic conditions of agrarian Russia motivated and impelled the \"revolutionary nationalism of the poor\" to depose the [[absolute monarchy]] of the three-hundred-year dynasty of the [[House of Romanov]] (1613\u20131917), as [[Tsarism|tsars]] of Russia.<ref>''Faces of Janus'' p. 133.</ref>\n\n=== Imperialism ===\nIn ''[[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism]]'' (1916) Lenin\u2019s economic analyses indicated that capitalism would transform into a [[global financial system]], by which industrialised countries exported [[financial capital]] to their [[Colonialism|colonies]] and so realise the [[exploitation of labour]] of the natives and the exploitation of the natural resources of their countries. That such [[Superprofit|superexploitation]] allows wealthy countries to maintain a domestic [[labour aristocracy]] with a slightly higher standard of living than the majority of workers, and so ensure peaceful labour\u2013capital relations in the capitalist homeland. Therefore, a [[proletarian revolution]] of workers and peasants could not occur in capitalist countries whilst the imperialist global-finance system remained in place. The first proletarian revolution would have to occur in an under-developed country, such as Imperial Russia, which was the politically weakest country in the capitalist global-finance system in the early 20th century.<ref name=tomasic>Tomasic, D. \"The Impact of Russian Culture on Soviet Communism\" (1953), ''The Western Political Quarterly'', vol. 6, No. 4 December, pp. 808\u2013809.</ref> In the ''United States of Europe Slogan'' (1915), Lenin said: {{quotation|[[Workers of the world, unite!]] \u2014 Uneven economic and political development is an absolute law of capitalism.

Those who do not understand this reveal a failure to understand even the smallest grain of Marxism, of modern [[scientific socialism]] in general. Those who have not proved in practice, over a fairly considerable period of time and in fairly varied political situations, their ability to apply this truth in practice have not yet learned to help the revolutionary class in its struggle to emancipate all toiling humanity from the exploiters.

The immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all other proletarian parties: Formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of political power by the proletariat.}}\n\nThe revolutionary purpose of the Leninist [[vanguard party]] is to establish the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] with the support of the [[working class]]. The Communist Party would lead the popular deposition of the [[Tsarism|Tsarist]] government and then transfer power of government to the working class; that change of ruling class \u2014 from the [[bourgeoisie]] to the [[proletariat]] \u2014 makes possible the establishment of [[socialism]].<ref>Townson, D. ''The New Penguin Dictionary of Modern History: 1789\u20131945''. London:1994. pp. 462\u2013464.</ref> In ''[[What Is To Be Done?]]'' (1902), Lenin said that a revolutionary vanguard party, recruited from the working class, should lead the political campaign, because only in that way would the proletariat successfully realise their revolution; unlike the economic campaign of trade-union-struggle advocated by other socialist political parties and the [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalists]]. Like Marx, Lenin distinguished between the aspects of a revolution, the \"economic campaign\" (labour strikes for increased wages and work concessions) that featured diffused plural leadership; and the \"political campaign\" (socialist changes to society), which required the decisive, revolutionary leadership of the Bolshevik vanguard party.\n\n==== Democratic centralism ====\n{{main|Democratic centralism}}\nBased upon the [[First International]] (IWA, International Workingmen's Association, 1864\u20131876), Lenin organised the Bolsheviks as a [[Democratic centralism|democratically centralised]] vanguard party, wherein free political-speech was recognised legitimate until policy consensus; afterwards, every member of the Party was expected to abide the agreed policy. Democratic debate was Bolshevik practice, even after Lenin banned factions among the Party in 1921. Despite being a guiding political influence, Lenin did not exercise absolute power, and continually debated to have his points of view accepted as a course of revolutionary action. In ''Freedom to Criticise and Unity of Action'' (1905), Lenin said: {{quotation|Of course, the application of this principle in practice will sometimes give rise to disputes and misunderstandings; but only on the basis of this principle can all disputes and all misunderstandings be settled honourably for the Party. [...] The principle of democratic centralism and autonomy for local Party organisations implies universal and full freedom to criticise, so long as this does not disturb the unity of a definite action; it rules out all criticism which disrupts or makes difficult the unity of an action decided on by the Party.<ref>Lenin, V.I.

Trotsky's theory of [[permanent revolution]] proposed that socialist revolutions in underdeveloped countries would go further towards dismantling [[Feudalism|feudal]] r\u00e9gimes and establish socialist democracies that would not pass through a capitalist stage of development and government. Hence, revolutionary workers should politically ally with peasant political organisations, but not with capitalist political parties.

The Stalinist economic policy vacillated between appeasing the capitalist interests of the [[kulak]] in the countryside and destroying them as a social class. Initially, the Stalinists also rejected the national industrialisation of Russia, but then pursued it in full, sometimes brutally. In both cases, the Left Opposition denounced the regressive nature of Stalin's policy towards the wealthy kulak social class, and the brutality of forced industrialisation.

In that atmosphere, Tecgraf's clients could not afford, either politically or financially, to buy customized software from abroad.

There was a lack of any flow-control structures in SOL and DEL, and Petrobras felt a growing need to add full programming power to them.\n\nIn ''The Evolution of Lua'', the language's authors wrote:<ref name=hopl2007 />\n\n{{Quote|In 1993, the only real contender was [[Tcl]], which had been explicitly designed to be embedded into applications. However, Tcl had unfamiliar syntax, did not offer good support for data description, and ran only on Unix platforms. We did not consider [[Lisp (programming language)|LISP]] or [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] because of their unfriendly syntax. [[Python (programming language)|Python]] was still in its infancy. In the free, do-it-yourself atmosphere that then reigned in Tecgraf, it was quite natural that we should try to develop our own scripting language&nbsp;... Because many potential users of the language were not professional programmers, the language should avoid cryptic syntax and semantics. The implementation of the new language should be highly portable, because Tecgraf's clients had a very diverse collection of computer platforms. Finally, since we expected that other Tecgraf products would also need to embed a scripting language, the new language should follow the example of SOL and be provided as a library with a C API.}}\n\nLua 1.0 was designed in such a way that its object constructors, being then slightly different from the current light and flexible style, incorporated the data-description syntax of SOL (hence the name Lua: ''Sol'' is also the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese word]] for \"Sun\", ''Lua'' being the word for \"Moon\"). Lua [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] for control structures was mostly borrowed from [[Modula]] (<code>if</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>repeat</code>/<code>until</code>), but also had taken influence from [[CLU (programming language)|CLU]] (multiple assignments and multiple returns from function calls, as a simpler alternative to [[Call by reference|reference parameters]] or explicit [[pointer (computer programming)|pointers]]), [[C++]] (\"neat idea of allowing a [[local variable]] to be declared only where we need it\"<ref name=hopl2007 />), [[SNOBOL]] and [[AWK]] ([[associative array]]s). In an article published in ''[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]'', Lua's creators also state that [[LISP]] and [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] with their single, ubiquitous data-structure mechanism (the [[List (computing)|list]]) were a major influence on their decision to develop the table as the primary data structure of Lua.<ref name=ddj96>{{cite news| last1 = Figueiredo | first1 = L.

Several features were added in new Lua versions.\n\nVersions of Lua prior to version 5.0 were released under a license similar to the [[BSD licenses|BSD license]]. From version 5.0 onwards, Lua has been licensed under the [[MIT License]].  Both are [[permissive free software licences]] and are almost identical.\n\n== Features ==\n{{excessive detail|section|date=April 2017}}\n\nLua is commonly described as a \"[[Multi-paradigm programming language|multi-paradigm]]\" language, providing a small set of general features that can be extended to fit different problem types. Lua does not contain explicit support for [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]], but allows it to be implemented with [[metatable]]s. Similarly, Lua allows programmers to implement [[namespaces]], [[Class (computer science)|classes]], and other related features using its single table implementation; [[first-class function]]s allow the employment of many techniques from [[functional programming]]; and full lexical [[Scope (programming)|scoping]] allows fine-grained [[information hiding]] to enforce the [[principle of least privilege]].\n\nIn general, Lua strives to provide simple, flexible [[Metaprogramming|meta-features]] that can be extended as needed, rather than supply a feature-set specific to one programming paradigm. As a result, the base language is [[Lightweight programming language|light]]\u2014the full reference [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] is only about 247&nbsp;[[Kilobyte|kB]] compiled<ref name=luaabout />\u2014and easily adaptable to a broad range of applications.\n\nLua is a [[dynamically typed]] language intended for use as an [[Scripting language|extension]] or [[scripting language]] and is compact enough to fit on a variety of host platforms. It supports only a small number of atomic data structures such as [[Boolean data type|boolean]] values, numbers (double-precision [[floating point]] and 64-bit [[integers]] by default), and [[string (computer science)|strings]]. Typical data structures such as [[Array data structure|arrays]], [[set (computer science)|sets]], [[List (computing)|lists]], and [[record (computer science)|records]] can be represented using Lua's single native data structure, the table, which is essentially a heterogeneous [[associative array]].\n\nLua implements a small set of advanced features such as [[first-class function]]s, [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]], [[Closure (computer science)|closures]], proper [[Tail recursion|tail calls]], [[Type conversion|coercion]] (automatic conversion between string and number values at run time), [[coroutine]]s (cooperative multitasking) and [[Dynamic loading|dynamic module loading]].\n\n=== Syntax ===\n\nThe classic [[\"Hello, World!\" program]] can be written as follows:<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.lua.org/pil/1.html | title=Programming in Lua : 1}}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\n</syntaxhighlight>\nor as:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nprint 'Hello World!'\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nA [[comment (computer programming)|comment]] in Lua starts with a double-[[hyphen]] and runs to the end of the line, similar to [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[SQL]] and [[VHDL]]. Multi-line strings and comments are adorned with double square brackets.\n\nThe [[factorial]] function is implemented as a function in this example:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nfunction factorial(n)\n  local x = 1\n  for i = 2, n do\n    x = x * i\n  end\n  return x\nend\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Control flow ===\n\nLua has four types of [[loop (computing)|loops]]: the [[while loop|<code>while</code> loop]], the <code>repeat</code> loop (similar to a [[do while loop|<code> do while</code> loop]]), the numeric [[for loop|<code>for</code> loop]], and the generic <code>for</code> loop.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\n--condition = true\n\nwhile condition do\n  --statements\nend\n\nrepeat\n  --statements\nuntil condition\n\nfor i = first, last, delta do  --delta may be negative, allowing the for loop to count down or up\n  --statements\n  --example: print(i)\nend\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe generic <code>for</code> loop:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nfor key, value in pairs(_G) do\n  print(key, value)\nend\n</syntaxhighlight>\nwould iterate over the table <code>_G</code> using the standard iterator function <code>pairs</code>, until it returns <code>nil</code>.\n\nYou can also do a nested loop, which is a loop inside of another loop.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nlocal grid = {\n  { 11, 12, 13 },\n  { 21, 22, 23 },\n  { 31, 32, 33 }\n}\n\nfor y, row in ipairs(grid) do\n  for x, value in ipairs(row) do\n    print(x, y, grid[y][x])\n  end\nend\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Functions ===\n\nLua's treatment of functions as [[first-class function|first-class]] values is shown in the following example, where the print function's behavior is modified:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\ndo\n  local oldprint = print\n  -- Store current print function as oldprint\n  function print(s)\n    --[[ Redefine print function. The usual print function can still be used\n      through oldprint. The new one has only one argument.]]\n    oldprint(s == \"foo\" and \"bar\" or s)\n  end\nend\n</syntaxhighlight>\nAny future calls to <code>print</code> will now be routed through the new function, and because of Lua's [[Scope (programming)#Lexical scoping|lexical scoping]], the old print function will only be accessible by the new, modified print.\n\nLua also supports [[Closure (computer programming)|closures]], as demonstrated below:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nfunction addto(x)\n  -- Return a new function that adds x to the argument\n  return function(y)\n    --[=[ When we refer to the variable x, which is outside the current\n      scope and whose lifetime would be shorter than that of this anonymous\n      function, Lua creates a closure.]=]\n    return x + y\n  end\nend\nfourplus = addto(4)\nprint(fourplus(3))  -- Prints 7\n\n--This can also be achieved by calling the function in the following way:\nprint(addto(4)(3))\n--[[ This is because we are calling the returned function from 'addto(4)' with the argument '3' directly.\n  This also helps to reduce data cost and up performance if being called iteratively.\n]]\n</syntaxhighlight>\nA new closure for the variable <code>x</code> is created every time <code>addto</code> is called, so that each new anonymous function returned will always access its own <code>x</code> parameter. The closure is managed by Lua's garbage collector, just like any other object.\n\n=== Tables ===\n\nTables are the most important data structures (and, by design, the only built-in [[composite data type]]) in Lua and are the foundation of all user-created types. They are [[associative array]]s with addition of automatic numeric key and special syntax.\n\nA table is a collection of key and data pairs, where the data is referenced by key; in other words, it is a [[hash table|hashed]] heterogeneous associative array.\n\nTables are created using the <code>{}</code> constructor syntax.\n\n<source lang=\"lua\">\na_table = {} -- Creates a new, empty table\n</source>\n\nTables are always passed by reference (see [[Call by sharing]]).\n\nA key (index) can be any value except <code>nil</code> and [[NaN]], including functions.\n\n<source lang=\"lua\">\na_table = {x = 10}  -- Creates a new table, with one entry mapping \"x\" to the number 10.\nprint(a_table[\"x\"]) -- Prints the value associated with the string key, in this case 10.\nb_table = a_table\nb_table[\"x\"] = 20   -- The value in the table has been changed to 20.\nprint(b_table[\"x\"]) -- Prints 20.\nprint(a_table[\"x\"]) -- Also prints 20, because a_table and b_table both refer to the same table.\n</source>\n\nA table is often used as [[object composition|structure]] (or [[Record (computer science)|record]]) by using [[string (computer science)|strings]] as keys. Because such use is very common, Lua features a special syntax for accessing such fields.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#2.3|title=Lua 5.1 Reference Manual|accessdate=2014-02-27|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n<source lang=\"lua\">\npoint = { x = 10, y = 20 }   -- Create new table\nprint(point[\"x\"])            -- Prints 10\nprint(point.x)               -- Has exactly the same meaning as line above. The easier-to-read dot notation is just syntactic sugar.\n</source>\n\nBy using a table to store related functions, it can act as a namespace.\n\n<source lang=\"lua\">\nPoint = {}\n\nPoint.new = function(x, y)\n  return {x = x, y = y}  --  return {[\"x\"] = x, [\"y\"] = y}\nend\n\nPoint.set_x = function(point, x)\n  point.x = x  --  point[\"x\"] = x;\nend\n</source>\n\nTables are automatically assigned a numerical key, enabling them to be used as an [[array data type]]. The first automatic index is 1 rather than 0 as it is for many other programming languages (though an explicit index of 0 is allowed).\n\nA numeric key <code>1</code> is distinct from a string key <code>\"1\"</code>.\n\n<source lang=\"lua\">\narray = { \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\" }   -- Indices are assigned automatically.\nprint(array[2])                  -- Prints \"b\". Automatic indexing in Lua starts at 1.\nprint(#array)                    -- Prints 4.  # is the length operator for tables and strings.\narray[0] = \"z\"                   -- Zero is a legal index.\nprint(#array)                    -- Still prints 4, as Lua arrays are 1-based.\n</source>\n\nThe length of a table <code>t</code> is defined to be any integer index <code>n</code> such that <code>t[n]</code> is not <code>nil</code> and <code>t[n+1]</code> is <code>nil</code>; moreover, if <code>t[1]</code> is <code>nil</code>, <code>n</code> can be zero. For a regular array, with non-nil values from 1 to a given <code>n</code>, its length is exactly that <code>n</code>, the index of its last value. If the array has \"holes\" (that is, nil values between other non-nil values), then <code>#t</code> can be any of the indices that directly precedes a <code>nil</code> value (that is, it may consider any such nil value as the end of the array).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#2.5.5|title=Lua 5.1 Reference Manual|accessdate=2012-10-16|year=2012}}</ref>\n\n<source lang=\"lua\">\nExampleTable =\n{\n  {1, 2, 3, 4},\n  {5, 6, 7, 8}\n}\nprint(ExampleTable[1][3]) -- Prints \"3\"\nprint(ExampleTable[2][4]) -- Prints \"8\"\n</source>\n\nA table can be an array of objects.\n\n<source lang=\"lua\">\nfunction Point(x, y)        -- \"Point\" object constructor\n  return { x = x, y = y }   -- Creates and returns a new object (table)\nend\narray = { Point(10, 20), Point(30, 40), Point(50, 60) }   -- Creates array of points\n                        -- array = { { x = 10, y = 20 }, { x = 30, y = 40 }, { x = 50, y = 60 } };\nprint(array[2].y)                                         -- Prints 40\n</source>\n\nUsing a hash map to emulate an array normally is slower than using an actual array; however, Lua tables are optimized for use as arrays to help avoid this issue.<ref name=lobject_h_array>{{cite web|url=https://www.lua.org/source/5.1/lobject.h.html#array|title=Lua 5.1 Source Code|accessdate=2011-03-24|year=2006}}</ref><!-- I'd like to find a message on the mailing list from one of the developers, but I can't. Oh well, source code is a pretty trustworthy reference. -->\n\n=== Metatables ===\nExtensible semantics is a key feature of Lua, and the [[metatable]] concept allows Lua's tables to be customized in powerful ways.  The following example demonstrates an \"infinite\" table.  For any <code>n</code>, <code>fibs[n]</code> will give the <code>n</code>-th [[Fibonacci number]] using [[dynamic programming]] and [[memoization]].\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nfibs = { 1, 1 }                                -- Initial values for fibs[1] and fibs[2].\nsetmetatable(fibs, {\n  __index = function(values, n)                --[[__index is a function predefined by Lua, \n                                                   it is called if key \"n\" does not exist.]]\n    values[n] = values[n - 1] + values[n - 2]  -- Calculate and memoize fibs[n].\n    return values[n]\n  end\n})\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Object-oriented programming ===\n\nAlthough Lua does not have a built-in concept of [[class (computer science)|classes]], [[object-oriented programming]] can be achieved using two language features: [[first-class function]]s and tables. By placing functions and related data into a table, an object is formed. [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|Inheritance]] (both single and multiple) can be implemented using the [[metatable]] mechanism, telling the object to look up nonexistent methods and fields in parent object(s).\n\nThere is no such concept as \"class\" with these techniques; rather, [[prototype-based programming|prototypes]] are used, similar to [[Self (programming language)|Self]] or [[JavaScript]]. New objects are created either with a [[factory method pattern|factory method]] (that constructs new objects from scratch) or by cloning an existing object.\n\nLua provides some [[syntactic sugar]] to facilitate object orientation. To declare [[Method (computer science)|member functions]] inside a prototype table, one can use {{code |lang=lua |function table:func(args)}}, which is equivalent to {{code |lang=lua |function table.func(self, args)}}. Calling class methods also makes use of the colon: {{code |lang=lua |object:func(args)}} is equivalent to {{code |lang=lua |object.func(object, args)}}.\n\nCreating a basic [[Vector (geometry)|vector]] object:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nlocal Vector = {}\nVector.__index = Vector\n\nfunction Vector:new(x, y, z)    -- The constructor\n  return setmetatable({x = x, y = y, z = z}, Vector)\nend\n\nfunction Vector:magnitude()     -- Another method\n  -- Reference the implicit object using self\n  return math.sqrt(self.x^2 + self.y^2 + self.z^2)\nend\n\nlocal vec = Vector:new(0, 1, 0) -- Create a vector\nprint(vec:magnitude())          -- Call a method (output: 1)\nprint(vec.x)                    -- Access a member variable (output: 0)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n== Implementation ==\n\nLua programs are not [[interpreted language|interpreted]] directly from the textual Lua file, but are [[compiler|compiled]] into [[bytecode]], which is then run on the Lua [[virtual machine]]. The compilation process is typically invisible to the user and is performed during [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]], but it can be done offline in order to increase loading performance or reduce the memory footprint of the host environment by leaving out the compiler. Lua bytecode can also be produced and executed from within Lua, using the <code>dump</code> function from the string library and the <code>load/loadstring/loadfile</code> functions. Lua version 5.3.4 is implemented in approximately 24,000 lines of C code.<ref name=\"luaspe\" /><ref name=\"luaabout\" />\n\nLike most CPUs, and unlike most virtual machines (which are [[stack machine|stack-based]]), the Lua VM is [[register machine|register-based]], and therefore more closely resembles an actual hardware design. The register architecture both avoids excessive copying of values and reduces the total number of instructions per function. The virtual machine of Lua 5 is one of the first register-based pure VMs to have a wide use.<ref name=lua5impl>{{cite journal| last1 = Ierusalimschy | first1 = R. | last2 = Figueiredo | first2 = L.

The API is divided into two parts: the Lua core and the Lua auxiliary library.<ref name=\"luarefman\">{{cite web| url = https://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/| title = Lua 5.2 Reference Manual| publisher = Lua.org| accessdate = 2012-10-23}}</ref> The Lua API's design eliminates the need for manual [[Reference counting|reference management]] in C code, unlike [[Python (programming language)|Python]]'s API. The API, like the language, is minimalistic. Advanced functionality is provided by the auxiliary library, which consists largely of [[preprocessor]] [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] which assist with complex table operations.\n\nThe Lua C API is [[Stack (data structure)|stack]] based. Lua provides functions to push and pop most simple C data types (integers, floats, etc.) to and from the stack, as well as functions for manipulating tables through the stack. The Lua stack is somewhat different from a traditional stack; the stack can be indexed directly, for example. Negative indices indicate offsets from the top of the stack. For example, \u22121<!-- not a hyphen --> is the top (most recently pushed value), while positive indices indicate offsets from the bottom (oldest value). [[Marshalling (computer science)|Marshalling]] data between C and Lua functions is also done using the stack. To call a Lua function, arguments are pushed onto the stack, and then the <code>lua_call</code> is used to call the actual function. When writing a C function to be directly called from Lua, the arguments are read from the stack.\n\nHere is an example of calling a Lua function from C:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <lua.h> // Lua main library (lua_*)\n#include <lauxlib.h> // Lua auxiliary library (luaL_*)\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // create a Lua state\n    lua_State *L = luaL_newstate();\n\n    // load and execute a string\n    if (luaL_dostring(L, \"function foo (x,y) return x+y end\")) {\n        lua_close(L);\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    // push value of global \"foo\" (the function defined above)\n    // to the stack, followed by integers 5 and 3\n    lua_getglobal(L, \"foo\");\n    lua_pushinteger(L, 5);\n    lua_pushinteger(L, 3);\n    lua_call(L, 2, 1); // call a function with two arguments and one return value\n    printf(\"Result: %d\\n\", lua_tointeger(L, -1)); // print integer value of item at stack top\n    lua_pop(L, 1); // return stack to original state\n    lua_close(L); // close Lua state\n    return 0;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nRunning this example gives:\n<pre>$ cc -o example example.c -llua\n$ ./example\nResult: 8\n</pre>\n\nThe C API also provides some special tables, located at various \"pseudo-indices\" in the Lua stack. At <code>LUA_GLOBALSINDEX</code> prior to Lua 5.2<ref name=\"Changes in the API, Lua 5.2 manual\">{{cite web| url = https://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#8.3| title = Changes in the API | work = Lua 5.2 Reference Manual| publisher = Lua.org| accessdate = 2014-05-09}}</ref> is the globals table, <code>_G</code> from within Lua, which is the main [[namespace]]. There is also a registry located at <code>LUA_REGISTRYINDEX</code> where C programs can store Lua values for later retrieval.\n\nIt is possible to write extension modules using the Lua API. Extension modules are [[Library (computing)#Dynamic linking|shared objects]] which can be used to extend the functionality of the interpreter by providing native facilities to Lua scripts. From the Lua side, such a module appears as a namespace table holding its functions and variables. Lua scripts may load extension modules using <code>require</code>,<ref name=luarefman /> just like modules written in Lua itself.

It provided the basic facilities of most [[procedural programming]] languages, but more complicated or [[domain-specific language|domain-specific]] features were not included; rather, it included mechanisms for extending the language, allowing programmers to implement such features. As Lua was intended to be a general embeddable extension language, the designers of Lua focused on improving its [[Profiling (computer programming)|speed]], [[Portability (computer science)|portability]], extensibility, and ease-of-use in development.\n\n== History ==\n\nLua was created in 1993 by [[Roberto Ierusalimschy]], Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo, and Waldemar Celes, members of the Computer Graphics Technology Group (Tecgraf) at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro]], in [[Brazil]].\n\nFrom 1977 until 1992, Brazil had a policy of strong [[trade barrier]]s (called a market reserve) for computer hardware and software. In that atmosphere, Tecgraf's clients could not afford, either politically or financially, to buy customized software from abroad. Those reasons led Tecgraf to implement the basic tools it needed from scratch.<ref name=hopl2007>{{cite book| last1 = Ierusalimschy | first1 = R.| author1-link = Roberto Ierusalimschy| last2 = Figueiredo| first2 = L.

There was a lack of any flow-control structures in SOL and DEL, and Petrobras felt a growing need to add full programming power to them.\n\nIn ''The Evolution of Lua'', the language's authors wrote:<ref name=hopl2007 />\n\n{{Quote|In 1993, the only real contender was [[Tcl]], which had been explicitly designed to be embedded into applications. However, Tcl had unfamiliar syntax, did not offer good support for data description, and ran only on Unix platforms. We did not consider [[Lisp (programming language)|LISP]] or [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] because of their unfriendly syntax. [[Python (programming language)|Python]] was still in its infancy. In the free, do-it-yourself atmosphere that then reigned in Tecgraf, it was quite natural that we should try to develop our own scripting language&nbsp;... Because many potential users of the language were not professional programmers, the language should avoid cryptic syntax and semantics. The implementation of the new language should be highly portable, because Tecgraf's clients had a very diverse collection of computer platforms. Finally, since we expected that other Tecgraf products would also need to embed a scripting language, the new language should follow the example of SOL and be provided as a library with a C API.}}\n\nLua 1.0 was designed in such a way that its object constructors, being then slightly different from the current light and flexible style, incorporated the data-description syntax of SOL (hence the name Lua: ''Sol'' is also the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese word]] for \"Sun\", ''Lua'' being the word for \"Moon\"). Lua [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] for control structures was mostly borrowed from [[Modula]] (<code>if</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>repeat</code>/<code>until</code>), but also had taken influence from [[CLU (programming language)|CLU]] (multiple assignments and multiple returns from function calls, as a simpler alternative to [[Call by reference|reference parameters]] or explicit [[pointer (computer programming)|pointers]]), [[C++]] (\"neat idea of allowing a [[local variable]] to be declared only where we need it\"<ref name=hopl2007 />), [[SNOBOL]] and [[AWK]] ([[associative array]]s). In an article published in ''[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]'', Lua's creators also state that [[LISP]] and [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] with their single, ubiquitous data-structure mechanism (the [[List (computing)|list]]) were a major influence on their decision to develop the table as the primary data structure of Lua.<ref name=ddj96>{{cite news| last1 = Figueiredo | first1 = L.

Several features were added in new Lua versions.\n\nVersions of Lua prior to version 5.0 were released under a license similar to the [[BSD licenses|BSD license]]. From version 5.0 onwards, Lua has been licensed under the [[MIT License]].  Both are [[permissive free software licences]] and are almost identical.\n\n== Features ==\n{{excessive detail|section|date=April 2017}}\n\nLua is commonly described as a \"[[Multi-paradigm programming language|multi-paradigm]]\" language, providing a small set of general features that can be extended to fit different problem types. Lua does not contain explicit support for [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]], but allows it to be implemented with [[metatable]]s. Similarly, Lua allows programmers to implement [[namespaces]], [[Class (computer science)|classes]], and other related features using its single table implementation; [[first-class function]]s allow the employment of many techniques from [[functional programming]]; and full lexical [[Scope (programming)|scoping]] allows fine-grained [[information hiding]] to enforce the [[principle of least privilege]].\n\nIn general, Lua strives to provide simple, flexible [[Metaprogramming|meta-features]] that can be extended as needed, rather than supply a feature-set specific to one programming paradigm. As a result, the base language is [[Lightweight programming language|light]]\u2014the full reference [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] is only about 247&nbsp;[[Kilobyte|kB]] compiled<ref name=luaabout />\u2014and easily adaptable to a broad range of applications.\n\nLua is a [[dynamically typed]] language intended for use as an [[Scripting language|extension]] or [[scripting language]] and is compact enough to fit on a variety of host platforms. It supports only a small number of atomic data structures such as [[Boolean data type|boolean]] values, numbers (double-precision [[floating point]] and 64-bit [[integers]] by default), and [[string (computer science)|strings]]. Typical data structures such as [[Array data structure|arrays]], [[set (computer science)|sets]], [[List (computing)|lists]], and [[record (computer science)|records]] can be represented using Lua's single native data structure, the table, which is essentially a heterogeneous [[associative array]].\n\nLua implements a small set of advanced features such as [[first-class function]]s, [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]], [[Closure (computer science)|closures]], proper [[Tail recursion|tail calls]], [[Type conversion|coercion]] (automatic conversion between string and number values at run time), [[coroutine]]s (cooperative multitasking) and [[Dynamic loading|dynamic module loading]].\n\n=== Syntax ===\n\nThe classic [[\"Hello, World!\" program]] can be written as follows:<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.lua.org/pil/1.html | title=Programming in Lua : 1}}</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nprint(\"Hello World!\")\n</syntaxhighlight>\nor as:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nprint 'Hello World!'\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nA [[comment (computer programming)|comment]] in Lua starts with a double-[[hyphen]] and runs to the end of the line, similar to [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[SQL]] and [[VHDL]]. Multi-line strings and comments are adorned with double square brackets.\n\nThe [[factorial]] function is implemented as a function in this example:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nfunction factorial(n)\n  local x = 1\n  for i = 2, n do\n    x = x * i\n  end\n  return x\nend\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Control flow ===\n\nLua has four types of [[loop (computing)|loops]]: the [[while loop|<code>while</code> loop]], the <code>repeat</code> loop (similar to a [[do while loop|<code> do while</code> loop]]), the numeric [[for loop|<code>for</code> loop]], and the generic <code>for</code> loop.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\n--condition = true\n\nwhile condition do\n  --statements\nend\n\nrepeat\n  --statements\nuntil condition\n\nfor i = first, last, delta do  --delta may be negative, allowing the for loop to count down or up\n  --statements\n  --example: print(i)\nend\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe generic <code>for</code> loop:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nfor key, value in pairs(_G) do\n  print(key, value)\nend\n</syntaxhighlight>\nwould iterate over the table <code>_G</code> using the standard iterator function <code>pairs</code>, until it returns <code>nil</code>.\n\nYou can also do a nested loop, which is a loop inside of another loop.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nlocal grid = {\n  { 11, 12, 13 },\n  { 21, 22, 23 },\n  { 31, 32, 33 }\n}\n\nfor y, row in ipairs(grid) do\n  for x, value in ipairs(row) do\n    print(x, y, grid[y][x])\n  end\nend\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Functions ===\n\nLua's treatment of functions as [[first-class function|first-class]] values is shown in the following example, where the print function's behavior is modified:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\ndo\n  local oldprint = print\n  -- Store current print function as oldprint\n  function print(s)\n    --[[ Redefine print function. The usual print function can still be used\n      through oldprint. The new one has only one argument.]]\n    oldprint(s == \"foo\" and \"bar\" or s)\n  end\nend\n</syntaxhighlight>\nAny future calls to <code>print</code> will now be routed through the new function, and because of Lua's [[Scope (programming)#Lexical scoping|lexical scoping]], the old print function will only be accessible by the new, modified print.\n\nLua also supports [[Closure (computer programming)|closures]], as demonstrated below:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nfunction addto(x)\n  -- Return a new function that adds x to the argument\n  return function(y)\n    --[=[ When we refer to the variable x, which is outside the current\n      scope and whose lifetime would be shorter than that of this anonymous\n      function, Lua creates a closure.]=]\n    return x + y\n  end\nend\nfourplus = addto(4)\nprint(fourplus(3))  -- Prints 7\n\n--This can also be achieved by calling the function in the following way:\nprint(addto(4)(3))\n--[[ This is because we are calling the returned function from 'addto(4)' with the argument '3' directly.\n  This also helps to reduce data cost and up performance if being called iteratively.\n]]\n</syntaxhighlight>\nA new closure for the variable <code>x</code> is created every time <code>addto</code> is called, so that each new anonymous function returned will always access its own <code>x</code> parameter. The closure is managed by Lua's garbage collector, just like any other object.\n\n=== Tables ===\n\nTables are the most important data structures (and, by design, the only built-in [[composite data type]]) in Lua and are the foundation of all user-created types. They are [[associative array]]s with addition of automatic numeric key and special syntax.\n\nA table is a collection of key and data pairs, where the data is referenced by key; in other words, it is a [[hash table|hashed]] heterogeneous associative array.\n\nTables are created using the <code>{}</code> constructor syntax.\n\n<source lang=\"lua\">\na_table = {} -- Creates a new, empty table\n</source>\n\nTables are always passed by reference (see [[Call by sharing]]).\n\nA key (index) can be any value except <code>nil</code> and [[NaN]], including functions.\n\n<source lang=\"lua\">\na_table = {x = 10}  -- Creates a new table, with one entry mapping \"x\" to the number 10.\nprint(a_table[\"x\"]) -- Prints the value associated with the string key, in this case 10.\nb_table = a_table\nb_table[\"x\"] = 20   -- The value in the table has been changed to 20.\nprint(b_table[\"x\"]) -- Prints 20.\nprint(a_table[\"x\"]) -- Also prints 20, because a_table and b_table both refer to the same table.\n</source>\n\nA table is often used as [[object composition|structure]] (or [[Record (computer science)|record]]) by using [[string (computer science)|strings]] as keys. Because such use is very common, Lua features a special syntax for accessing such fields.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#2.3|title=Lua 5.1 Reference Manual|accessdate=2014-02-27|year=2014}}</ref>\n\n<source lang=\"lua\">\npoint = { x = 10, y = 20 }   -- Create new table\nprint(point[\"x\"])            -- Prints 10\nprint(point.x)               -- Has exactly the same meaning as line above. The easier-to-read dot notation is just syntactic sugar.\n</source>\n\nBy using a table to store related functions, it can act as a namespace.\n\n<source lang=\"lua\">\nPoint = {}\n\nPoint.new = function(x, y)\n  return {x = x, y = y}  --  return {[\"x\"] = x, [\"y\"] = y}\nend\n\nPoint.set_x = function(point, x)\n  point.x = x  --  point[\"x\"] = x;\nend\n</source>\n\nTables are automatically assigned a numerical key, enabling them to be used as an [[array data type]]. The first automatic index is 1 rather than 0 as it is for many other programming languages (though an explicit index of 0 is allowed).\n\nA numeric key <code>1</code> is distinct from a string key <code>\"1\"</code>.\n\n<source lang=\"lua\">\narray = { \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\" }   -- Indices are assigned automatically.\nprint(array[2])                  -- Prints \"b\". Automatic indexing in Lua starts at 1.\nprint(#array)                    -- Prints 4.  # is the length operator for tables and strings.\narray[0] = \"z\"                   -- Zero is a legal index.\nprint(#array)                    -- Still prints 4, as Lua arrays are 1-based.\n</source>\n\nThe length of a table <code>t</code> is defined to be any integer index <code>n</code> such that <code>t[n]</code> is not <code>nil</code> and <code>t[n+1]</code> is <code>nil</code>; moreover, if <code>t[1]</code> is <code>nil</code>, <code>n</code> can be zero. For a regular array, with non-nil values from 1 to a given <code>n</code>, its length is exactly that <code>n</code>, the index of its last value. If the array has \"holes\" (that is, nil values between other non-nil values), then <code>#t</code> can be any of the indices that directly precedes a <code>nil</code> value (that is, it may consider any such nil value as the end of the array).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#2.5.5|title=Lua 5.1 Reference Manual|accessdate=2012-10-16|year=2012}}</ref>\n\n<source lang=\"lua\">\nExampleTable =\n{\n  {1, 2, 3, 4},\n  {5, 6, 7, 8}\n}\nprint(ExampleTable[1][3]) -- Prints \"3\"\nprint(ExampleTable[2][4]) -- Prints \"8\"\n</source>\n\nA table can be an array of objects.\n\n<source lang=\"lua\">\nfunction Point(x, y)        -- \"Point\" object constructor\n  return { x = x, y = y }   -- Creates and returns a new object (table)\nend\narray = { Point(10, 20), Point(30, 40), Point(50, 60) }   -- Creates array of points\n                        -- array = { { x = 10, y = 20 }, { x = 30, y = 40 }, { x = 50, y = 60 } };\nprint(array[2].y)                                         -- Prints 40\n</source>\n\nUsing a hash map to emulate an array normally is slower than using an actual array; however, Lua tables are optimized for use as arrays to help avoid this issue.<ref name=lobject_h_array>{{cite web|url=https://www.lua.org/source/5.1/lobject.h.html#array|title=Lua 5.1 Source Code|accessdate=2011-03-24|year=2006}}</ref><!-- I'd like to find a message on the mailing list from one of the developers, but I can't. Oh well, source code is a pretty trustworthy reference. -->\n\n=== Metatables ===\nExtensible semantics is a key feature of Lua, and the [[metatable]] concept allows Lua's tables to be customized in powerful ways.  The following example demonstrates an \"infinite\" table.  For any <code>n</code>, <code>fibs[n]</code> will give the <code>n</code>-th [[Fibonacci number]] using [[dynamic programming]] and [[memoization]].\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nfibs = { 1, 1 }                                -- Initial values for fibs[1] and fibs[2].\nsetmetatable(fibs, {\n  __index = function(values, n)                --[[__index is a function predefined by Lua, \n                                                   it is called if key \"n\" does not exist.]]\n    values[n] = values[n - 1] + values[n - 2]  -- Calculate and memoize fibs[n].\n    return values[n]\n  end\n})\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Object-oriented programming ===\n\nAlthough Lua does not have a built-in concept of [[class (computer science)|classes]], [[object-oriented programming]] can be achieved using two language features: [[first-class function]]s and tables. By placing functions and related data into a table, an object is formed. [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|Inheritance]] (both single and multiple) can be implemented using the [[metatable]] mechanism, telling the object to look up nonexistent methods and fields in parent object(s).\n\nThere is no such concept as \"class\" with these techniques; rather, [[prototype-based programming|prototypes]] are used, similar to [[Self (programming language)|Self]] or [[JavaScript]]. New objects are created either with a [[factory method pattern|factory method]] (that constructs new objects from scratch) or by cloning an existing object.\n\nLua provides some [[syntactic sugar]] to facilitate object orientation. To declare [[Method (computer science)|member functions]] inside a prototype table, one can use {{code |lang=lua |function table:func(args)}}, which is equivalent to {{code |lang=lua |function table.func(self, args)}}. Calling class methods also makes use of the colon: {{code |lang=lua |object:func(args)}} is equivalent to {{code |lang=lua |object.func(object, args)}}.\n\nCreating a basic [[Vector (geometry)|vector]] object:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"lua\">\nlocal Vector = {}\nVector.__index = Vector\n\nfunction Vector:new(x, y, z)    -- The constructor\n  return setmetatable({x = x, y = y, z = z}, Vector)\nend\n\nfunction Vector:magnitude()     -- Another method\n  -- Reference the implicit object using self\n  return math.sqrt(self.x^2 + self.y^2 + self.z^2)\nend\n\nlocal vec = Vector:new(0, 1, 0) -- Create a vector\nprint(vec:magnitude())          -- Call a method (output: 1)\nprint(vec.x)                    -- Access a member variable (output: 0)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n== Implementation ==\n\nLua programs are not [[interpreted language|interpreted]] directly from the textual Lua file, but are [[compiler|compiled]] into [[bytecode]], which is then run on the Lua [[virtual machine]]. The compilation process is typically invisible to the user and is performed during [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]], but it can be done offline in order to increase loading performance or reduce the memory footprint of the host environment by leaving out the compiler. Lua bytecode can also be produced and executed from within Lua, using the <code>dump</code> function from the string library and the <code>load/loadstring/loadfile</code> functions. Lua version 5.3.4 is implemented in approximately 24,000 lines of C code.<ref name=\"luaspe\" /><ref name=\"luaabout\" />\n\nLike most CPUs, and unlike most virtual machines (which are [[stack machine|stack-based]]), the Lua VM is [[register machine|register-based]], and therefore more closely resembles an actual hardware design. The register architecture both avoids excessive copying of values and reduces the total number of instructions per function. The virtual machine of Lua 5 is one of the first register-based pure VMs to have a wide use.<ref name=lua5impl>{{cite journal| last1 = Ierusalimschy | first1 = R. | last2 = Figueiredo | first2 = L.

The API is divided into two parts: the Lua core and the Lua auxiliary library.<ref name=\"luarefman\">{{cite web| url = https://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/| title = Lua 5.2 Reference Manual| publisher = Lua.org| accessdate = 2012-10-23}}</ref> The Lua API's design eliminates the need for manual [[Reference counting|reference management]] in C code, unlike [[Python (programming language)|Python]]'s API. The API, like the language, is minimalistic. Advanced functionality is provided by the auxiliary library, which consists largely of [[preprocessor]] [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] which assist with complex table operations.\n\nThe Lua C API is [[Stack (data structure)|stack]] based. Lua provides functions to push and pop most simple C data types (integers, floats, etc.) to and from the stack, as well as functions for manipulating tables through the stack. The Lua stack is somewhat different from a traditional stack; the stack can be indexed directly, for example. Negative indices indicate offsets from the top of the stack. For example, \u22121<!-- not a hyphen --> is the top (most recently pushed value), while positive indices indicate offsets from the bottom (oldest value). [[Marshalling (computer science)|Marshalling]] data between C and Lua functions is also done using the stack. To call a Lua function, arguments are pushed onto the stack, and then the <code>lua_call</code> is used to call the actual function. When writing a C function to be directly called from Lua, the arguments are read from the stack.\n\nHere is an example of calling a Lua function from C:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <lua.h> // Lua main library (lua_*)\n#include <lauxlib.h> // Lua auxiliary library (luaL_*)\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    // create a Lua state\n    lua_State *L = luaL_newstate();\n\n    // load and execute a string\n    if (luaL_dostring(L, \"function foo (x,y) return x+y end\")) {\n        lua_close(L);\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    // push value of global \"foo\" (the function defined above)\n    // to the stack, followed by integers 5 and 3\n    lua_getglobal(L, \"foo\");\n    lua_pushinteger(L, 5);\n    lua_pushinteger(L, 3);\n    lua_call(L, 2, 1); // call a function with two arguments and one return value\n    printf(\"Result: %d\\n\", lua_tointeger(L, -1)); // print integer value of item at stack top\n    lua_pop(L, 1); // return stack to original state\n    lua_close(L); // close Lua state\n    return 0;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nRunning this example gives:\n<pre>$ cc -o example example.c -llua\n$ ./example\nResult: 8\n</pre>\n\nThe C API also provides some special tables, located at various \"pseudo-indices\" in the Lua stack. At <code>LUA_GLOBALSINDEX</code> prior to Lua 5.2<ref name=\"Changes in the API, Lua 5.2 manual\">{{cite web| url = https://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#8.3| title = Changes in the API | work = Lua 5.2 Reference Manual| publisher = Lua.org| accessdate = 2014-05-09}}</ref> is the globals table, <code>_G</code> from within Lua, which is the main [[namespace]]. There is also a registry located at <code>LUA_REGISTRYINDEX</code> where C programs can store Lua values for later retrieval.\n\nIt is possible to write extension modules using the Lua API. Extension modules are [[Library (computing)#Dynamic linking|shared objects]] which can be used to extend the functionality of the interpreter by providing native facilities to Lua scripts. From the Lua side, such a module appears as a namespace table holding its functions and variables. Lua scripts may load extension modules using <code>require</code>,<ref name=luarefman /> just like modules written in Lua itself. A growing collection of modules known as ''rocks'' are available through a [[package management system]] called [[LuaRocks]],<ref>{{cite web| url = https://luarocks.org/| title = LuaRocks| publisher = LuaRocks wiki| accessdate=2009-05-24}}</ref> in the spirit of [[CPAN]], [[RubyGems]] and [[Python eggs]].

The fine debris finds its way past the filter and tends to accumulate in the governor, causing it to stick. A temporary solution is to remove and clean the governor. The problem will often recur as debris from damaged parts continues to build up in the governor.

The fine debris finds its way past the filter and tends to accumulate in the governor, causing it to stick. A temporary solution is to remove and clean the governor. The problem will often recur as debris from damaged parts continues to build up in the governor. If the problem continues after cleaning the governor then it may be necessary to replace the autobox if it cannot be fully reconditioned. \nUsual symptoms are failing to shift after 1st gear while the gearbox is still cold, and then failing to kickdown to 1st while at a stop. The governor is located at the end of the gearbox and usually it starts to work again after a cleanup.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of ZF transmissions]]\n\n==References==\n*{{cite web|title=ZF North America application chart (automatic)|url=http://www.zf.com/na/content/media/united_states/corporate_replacement_parts_1/service_portfolio/passenger_cars/AppChartpasscartrans.pdf|format=PDF|work=[[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF Friedrichshafen AG]]|publisher=ZF-Group.com|accessdate=11 February 2006}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:ZF Friedrichshafen transmissions|4HP22]]\n", "name_user": "CplDHicks2", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGear ratios:we don't use commas as decimal separators in English", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZF_4HP22_transmission"}

It was replaced by the [[Honda CR-X del Sol]] for the 1992 model year. Although there are many supposed definitions for the acronym CR-X, the most widely accepted is \"Civic Renaissance Experimental\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/CRX|title=CRX|work=TheFreeDictionary.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the US, the CRX (not CR-X) was marketed as an economy sport [[Kammback]], with room for two passengers. The European-spec car received a ZC {{convert|130\n|hp|abbr=on}} engine and a [[2+2 (car body style)|2+2 seating arrangement]]. Redesigned in 1988 and produced to 1991, the CRX was popular for its performance, nimble handling, and good fuel economy.

In North America, the CRX was marketed in two versions: economy and sport.  The economy model used a new aluminum 1.3 liter [[CVCC]] engine.  The sport model featured an aluminum 1.5 liter four cylinder with three valves per cylinder and available with a 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic.\n\nFor 1985, Honda replaced the economy model with an HF (high fuel) model featuring a 1.5 liter engine which uses an aluminum block but the 1984 CVCC cylinder head (two valves per cylinder) instead of the new aluminum head with three valves per cylinder. In spring 1985, Honda introduced an Si (Sports, injected) model featuring a more powerful 1.5 liter SOHC [[Programmed fuel injection|PGM-FI]] engine.  The Si model included a power sunroof, standard dual remote exterior mirrors, rear wiper, 13-inch alloy wheels and an Si-exclusive ducktail spoiler for the hatch.\n\nFor 1986, Honda updated the CRX with new aerodynamic headlights.  The Si received body color matched lower cladding, a revised rear spoiler, new bumper covers and 14-inch alloy wheels. The interior was upgraded and added a center console with cassette tape storage.  1987 was virtually unchanged from 1986 and would be the final year of the first generation CRX.\n\nThe first generation CRX was sold in some regions outside Japan as the \"[[Honda Civic]] CRX\". At its introduction, the CRX was available in Japan through ''[[Honda#Japan|Honda Verno]]'' dealership sales channels, and accompanied the [[Honda Vigor|Vigor]], the [[Honda Quint|Quint]], and the [[Honda Prelude|Prelude]].\n[[File:Honda-BalladeSportsCR-X1.5i.JPG|thumb|left|1987 Honda Ballade Sports CR-X 1.5i (Japan)]]\n\n===Drivetrain===\nThe Japanese Si and European 1.6i-16 models came with a 1590 cc [[DOHC]] [[internal combustion engine|engine]] putting out {{convert|135|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} in the UK-spec model and {{convert|140|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} in the [[Japanese domestic market|JDM]] model. Though similar versions of the same engine, the Japanese Si engine was stamped ZC, while the European engine was stamped ZC1.\nJapanese buyers took advantage of the largest, 1.5 L, engine while still paying the same amount of annual [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]].\n[[File:1987 Honda CRX Si, rear right (Lime Rock).jpg|thumb|left|1987 Honda CRX Si (U.S.)]]\n\nProject Synchronicity Honda Crx was a collaboration between American Honda and Racing Beat to install a second 1.5 liter engine with automatic transmission into the hatchback cargo area.<ref> Sherman, Don Car & Driver Magazine May 1985 p48-54 </ref> The installation of the second powertrain \"took six months and cost $20,000 dollars\". Phase Two of the project was to have Racing Beat install two 1.8 liter engines with automatic transmissions from the Honda Accord into Synchronicity. The Honda CRX would be called Super Synchronicity because of the increase of performance from two larger engines.<ref> Sherman, Don Car & Driver Magazine October 1985 p94-100 </ref> Both Honda Accord 1.8 liter powertrains were fuel injected and upgrades were made to the suspension.

The later 1.5 liter American-market CRX HF (high fuel economy) model (chassis codes EC1 and AF) could also reliably achieve very good gas mileage, more than a decade before gas-electric [[Hybrid car|hybrids]] appeared on the market, and at no price premium over the base model; the 1.5 liter is rated by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) (under the new rating system) at {{convert|42|mpgU.S.|l/100 km mpgimp}} city and {{convert|51|mpgU.S.|l/100 km mpgimp}} highway.<ref>[http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=2911 Gas Mileage of 1987 Honda Civic CRX HF], fueleconomy.gov website</ref>\n\n===U.S. model curb weights===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" Style=\"text-align:center\"\n!\n!Colspan=\"2\"| CRX\n!| CRX HF\n!| CRX Si\n|-\n|\n| Manual\n| Automatic\n| Manual\n| Manual\n|-\n| 1984\n|{{convert|1819|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|\n|\n| -\n|-\n| 1985\n|{{convert|1819|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|\n|{{convert|1713|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|{{convert|1953|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|-\n| '86-'87\n|{{convert|1865|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}<ref name=\"1986 Service Manual\">Helm Inc., Honda Civic CRX Service Manual 1986, p. 3-9</ref>\n|{{convert|1898|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}<ref name=\"1986 Service Manual\" />\n|{{convert|1713|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}<ref name=\"1986 Service Manual\" />\n|{{convert|1978|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}<ref name=\"1986 Service Manual\" />\n|}\n\n==Second generation==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Second generation\n| image = 1991CRXSi.jpg\n| caption = 1991 Honda CRX Si in Tahitian green\n| production = 1987&ndash;1991\n| model_years = 1988-1991\n| wheelbase = {{convert|90.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| length = {{convert|148.|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (1990\u201391)<br>{{convert|147.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (1988\u201389)\n| width = {{convert|65.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (1990\u201391)<br>{{convert|65.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (1988\u201389)\n| height = {{convert|50.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (1990\u201391)<br>{{convert|50|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (1988\u201389)\n| weight = {{convert|820|-|1000|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine = 1.5 L 62 hp ''[[Honda D engine#D15B6|D15B6]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]] (1988\u201389)<br> 72 hp ''[[Honda D engine#D15B6|D15B6]]'' I4 (1990\u201391)<br>1.5 L 92 hp ''[[Honda D engine#D15B2|D15B2]]'' I4<br>1.5 L 103 hp ''[[Honda D engine#D15B|D15B]]''<br>1.6 L 105 HP ''[[Honda D engine#D16A6|D16A6]]'' I4 (1988)<br>1.6 L 108 hp ''[[Honda D engine#D16A6|D16A6]]'' I4 (1989\u201391)<br>1.4 L ''[[Honda D engine#D14A1|D14A1]]'' I4{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}<br>1.6 L 130 hp '' I4<br>1.6 L 120hp ''[[Honda D engine#D16A8|D16A8]]'' I4<br>1.6 L 125-129hp ''[[Honda D engine#D16A9|D16A9]]'' I4<br>1.6 L 130 hp ''[[Honda ZC engine|D16ZC]]'' I4<br>1.6 L VTEC 150 hp ''[[Honda B engine#B16A1|B16A1]]'' I4\n|transmission = 5-speed manual, 4-speed automatic (DX only)\n}}\n\n===Overview===\nThe chassis was significantly changed in 1988, from its original torsion bar in the front and beam axle and trailing link in the rear to 4-wheel double wishbone suspension, in line with its sister Civic/Ballade models. Outside of North America, this second generation CRX was available with a 1493&nbsp;cc SOHC or an updated version of the 1590&nbsp;cc DOHC ZC engine. Many of these were fitted with fuel injection as standard.\n\n[[File:Hondacrxsirstock.jpg|left|thumb|Honda CR-X SiR]]\nThe VTEC-equipped models also received a makeover, with updated bumpers, lights, hood, brakes, suspensions and dashboard designs amongst other things. Additionally, some of these design changes were added to the concurrent non-VTEC models.\n\nOne of the options for the [[Japanese Domestic Market]] (JDM) CR-X was a glass roof, a fixed glass panel which stretched from the top of the windshield to the top of the hatch opening. Relatively common in Japan, these are sought-after models in other markets.\n\n===Drivetrain===\nIn September 1989, Honda added the 1595&nbsp;cc [[Honda B engine|B16A]] [[VTEC]] engine to the lineup outside of North America. The VTEC (variable valve timing and lift electronic control) engine provided increased power at high RPMs while still allowing low fuel consumption and better idling at low RPMs. The B16A produced {{convert|150|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} in the European 1.6i-VT model (where the engine bore the designation B16A1) and {{convert|160|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} in the JDM SiR model. The CRX was the second car to receive a VTEC engine, shortly after the [[Honda Integra|Integra]], although the CRX was more popular and common.\n[[File:1990 honda crx sir 2.jpg|thumb|1990 Honda CR-X SiR]]\nThe CR-X equipped with the 1.6 DOHC engine (ZC engine) or the 1.6 DOHC VTEC engine (B16A) came with a different hood since the B16A and ZC engines were taller and required additional hood clearances in comparison to the 1.6 SOHC engines.  The ZC engine was only slightly taller than the 1.6 SOHC engine and required additional hood clearance to clear the cam gear cover.  A CR-X equipped with the ZC engine had a hood with a bump on one side which offered the additional necessary clearance.  Cars equipped with a B16A engine came with a hood that was raised across most of the engine bay to offer additional overall clearance for the taller engine.\n\n===US market===\nThree different trim levels were available: The standard (unlabeled, sometimes called the \"DX\") equipped with the 16-valve 1493&nbsp;cc \"D15B2\" engine and dual-point fuel injection (DPFI), the HF (\"high fuel efficiency\") model with the eight-valve 1493&nbsp;cc \"D15B6\" engine and multi-point fuel injection (MPFI), or the Si (sport injected) model with the 16-valve 1590&nbsp;cc \"D16A6\" engine and MPFI. \"DX\" models were available with an automatic transmission, all others had a five-speed manual transmission. A modification was made to the rear of the vehicle on all second generation vehicles in that a glass panel was installed on the upper half of the rear of the vehicle, above the tail lights which aided in rearward visibility in addition to the glass hatchback. This panel is heavily stippled black.\n\n===Features and equipment===\nAir-conditioning was a dealer-installed option on all models.  The Si model came with a power sliding [[sunroof]] and 14-inch alloy wheels.  Underneath, the Si model was equipped with a rear [[anti-sway bar]] along with variable ratio rack-and-pinion steering.  The 90-91 Si models had 4-wheel disc brakes.\n\n===Colors and trim===\nThere were a total of six colors offered each model year.  Four color options were available on the CRX and CRX Si and two color options were available for the CRX HF.  Color availability would vary based on trim package and the interior color would depend on the exterior color choice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crxcommunity.com/viewtopic.php?t=5614|title=CRX Community Forum \u2022 View topic - OEM/Stock CRX Colors & Paint Codes|author=|date=|website=crxcommunity.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" Style=\"text-align:center\"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n!\t\t!!colspan=3 |\t1988\t\t\t\t\t!!colspan=3 |\t1989\t\t\t\t\t!!colspan=3 |\t1990\t\t\t\t\t!!colspan=3 |\t1991\t\t\t\t\n|-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n!\tColor name\t!!\tCRX HF\t!!\tCRX\t!!\tCRX Si\t!!\tCRX HF\t!!\tCRX\t!!\tCRX Si\t!!\tCRX HF\t!!\tCRX\t!!\tCRX Si\t!!\tCRX HF\t!!\tCRX\t!!\tCRX Si\n|-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|\tBlade silver metallic\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\n|-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|\tBarbados yellow\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\n|-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|\tSuperior blue metallic\t||\tX\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\n|-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|\tPolar white\t||\tX\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tX\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\n|-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|\tRio red\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tX\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\n|-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|\tFlint black metallic\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tX\n|-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|\tTorino red pearl\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\n|-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|\tCelestial blue pearl\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tN/A\n|-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|\tFrost white\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\t||\tX\t||\tX\n|-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n|\tTahitian green pearl\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tN/A\t||\tX\n|}\n\n===Curb weights===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" Style=\"text-align:center\"\n!\n!Colspan=\"2\"| CRX\n!| CRX HF\n!| CRX Si\n|-\n|\n| Manual\n| Automatic\n| Manual\n| Manual\n|-\n| 1988<ref name=\"Honda CRX Specifications\">http://eu.crxsi.com/specs.htm</ref>\n|{{convert|1922|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|\n|{{convert|1819|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|{{convert|2017|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|-\n| 1989<ref name=\"Honda CRX Specifications\" />\n|{{convert|2048|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|\n|{{convert|1834|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|{{convert|2138|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|-\n| 1990\u20131991<ref name=\"Honda CRX Specifications\" />\n|{{convert|2103|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|\n|{{convert|1967|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|{{convert|2174|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|}\n\n{{clear_left}}\n\n===Changes by model year===\n'''1988'''\n*First year of the second generation CRX.\n\n'''1989'''\n*Si and base model have door mounted seatbelts.

The del Sol was also badged as the CR-X del Sol in some markets, and known as simply the CR-X in others. It is because of this that the del Sol is generally considered the \"third Generation CR-X\" among enthusiasts, although it was arguably a very different car and Honda had seemingly quite different design goals when they built it.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} In the United States, the del Sol came in three trim lines: S (VXi in Japan, later VGi), Si (ESi in Europe), and VTEC (VTi in Europe) ; the JDM SiR model (not in US) featured a {{convert|170|hp|abbr=on}} B16A2 DOHC VTEC-engine. Production of the del Sol ended in 1997, and thus, the CR-X line was retired.\n\n==Comparison to other Honda vehicles==\nArticles on the 1st generation [[Honda Insight#History|Honda Insight]] have compared its appearance to that of the 1984\u20131991 CRX.<ref>{{cite web|author=Adrian Akau |url=http://www.gizmag.com/2010-honda-insight-world-premiere/10762/ |title=2010 Honda Insight world premiere |publisher=Gizmag.com |date=24 December 2010 |accessdate=2 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, thirteen years after the end of CRX production, Honda released the [[Honda CR-Z|CR-Z]], regarded as the [[spiritual successor]] to the CRX.<ref name=\"20071009insideline\">{{cite web|url= http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=122954|title= 2007 Tokyo Auto Show Preview: Honda CR-Z|accessdate= 22 February 2008|date= 9 October 2007|work= Inside Line|publisher= [[edmunds.com|edmunds]]|quote= Honda says the name of its sporty two-passenger concept for Tokyo \u2014 CR-Z \u2014 stands for \"Compact Renaissance Zero.\"}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nThe CRX was ''Motor Trend''{{'}}s [[Car of the Year|Import Car of the Year]] for 1984 and 1990, with the CRX-SI model also taking that title in 1988.

It was replaced by the [[Honda CR-X del Sol]] for the 1992 model year. Although there are many supposed definitions for the acronym CR-X, the most widely accepted is \"Civic Renaissance Experimental\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/CRX|title=CRX|work=TheFreeDictionary.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the US, the CRX (not CR-X) was marketed as an economy sport [[Kammback]], with room for two passengers. The European-spec car received a ZC {{convert|130\n|hp|abbr=on}} engine and a [[2+2 (car body style)|2+2 seating arrangement]]. Redesigned in 1988 and produced to 1991, the CRX was popular for its performance, nimble handling, and good fuel economy. Honda's 1992 [[Honda del sol|CRX del Sol]] was marketed as a CR-X in some markets.\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==First generation==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation\n| image = Honda Ballade CR-X.jpg\n| production = 1983&ndash;1987\n| model_years = 1984-1987 <br> Chassis EC1 AF AE532 AS\n| engine = 1.3 L 58 hp [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br>1.3 L 60 hp ''[[Honda E engine#Ev|EV1]]'' I4 (1984\u20131986)<br>1.5 L 58-76 hp ''[[Honda E engine#EW|EW1]]/[[Honda D engine#D15A2|D15A2]]'' I4 (1984\u201385)<br>1.5 L 91 hp ''[[Honda E engine#EW|EW3/4]]'' I4 (1985\u201387)<br>AU/NZ Spec:<br>1.5 L 108 hp ''[[Honda E engine#EW|EW5]]/[[Honda D engine#D15A3|D15A3]]'' I4 (1985\u20131987)<br>1.6 L 135 hp ZC1/D16A1 I4 (1986\u20131987)\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2200|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|3675|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1625|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1290|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|760|-|860|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n| transmission = 5-speed manual\n   \n3-speed automatic}}\n\n===Overview===\n\nFor the 1984 model year, Honda introduced an all-new two-seater that shared the drivetrain with the Civic but offered unique styling and interior furnishings.  In North America, the CRX was marketed in two versions: economy and sport.  The economy model used a new aluminum 1.3 liter [[CVCC]] engine.  The sport model featured an aluminum 1.5 liter four cylinder with three valves per cylinder and available with a 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic.\n\nFor 1985, Honda replaced the economy model with an HF (high fuel) model featuring a 1.5 liter engine which uses an aluminum block but the 1984 CVCC cylinder head (two valves per cylinder) instead of the new aluminum head with three valves per cylinder. In spring 1985, Honda introduced an Si (Sports, injected) model featuring a more powerful 1.5 liter SOHC [[Programmed fuel injection|PGM-FI]] engine.  The Si model included a power sunroof, standard dual remote exterior mirrors, rear wiper, 13-inch alloy wheels and an Si-exclusive ducktail spoiler for the hatch.\n\nFor 1986, Honda updated the CRX with new aerodynamic headlights.  The Si received body color matched lower cladding, a revised rear spoiler, new bumper covers and 14-inch alloy wheels. The interior was upgraded and added a center console with cassette tape storage.  1987 was virtually unchanged from 1986 and would be the final year of the first generation CRX.\n\nThe first generation CRX was sold in some regions outside Japan as the \"[[Honda Civic]] CRX\". At its introduction, the CRX was available in Japan through ''[[Honda#Japan|Honda Verno]]'' dealership sales channels, and accompanied the [[Honda Vigor|Vigor]], the [[Honda Quint|Quint]], and the [[Honda Prelude|Prelude]].\n[[File:Honda-BalladeSportsCR-X1.5i.JPG|thumb|left|1987 Honda Ballade Sports CR-X 1.5i (Japan)]]\n\n===Drivetrain===\nThe Japanese Si and European 1.6i-16 models came with a 1590 cc [[DOHC]] [[internal combustion engine|engine]] putting out {{convert|135|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} in the UK-spec model and {{convert|140|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} in the [[Japanese domestic market|JDM]] model. Though similar versions of the same engine, the Japanese Si engine was stamped ZC, while the European engine was stamped ZC1.\nJapanese buyers took advantage of the largest, 1.5 L, engine while still paying the same amount of annual [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]].\n[[File:1987 Honda CRX Si, rear right (Lime Rock).jpg|thumb|left|1987 Honda CRX Si (U.S.)]]\n\nProject Synchronicity Honda Crx was a collaboration between American Honda and Racing Beat to install a second 1.5 liter engine with automatic transmission into the hatchback cargo area.<ref> Sherman, Don Car & Driver Magazine May 1985 p48-54 </ref> The installation of the second powertrain \"took six months and cost $20,000 dollars\". Phase Two of the project was to have Racing Beat install two 1.8 liter engines with automatic transmissions from the Honda Accord into Synchronicity. The Honda CRX would be called Super Synchronicity because of the increase of performance from two larger engines.<ref> Sherman, Don Car & Driver Magazine October 1985 p94-100 </ref> Both Honda Accord 1.8 liter powertrains were fuel injected and upgrades were made to the suspension.  A Mugen body kit and upgraded wheels were also installed.<ref>https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a18734345/cd-project-cars-past-we-track-down-the-twin-engined-crx-newmans-own-turbo-and-our-72-pinto-race-car/</ref>\n\n===Fuel economy===\nThe original 1.3 liter car (chassis code AE532) had an EPA highway mileage rating of {{convert|52|mpgU.S.|l/100 km mpgimp}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=26572|title=Compare Side-by-Side|work=fueleconomy.gov}}</ref> in 1984 and was reported to often achieve over {{convert|70|mpgU.S.|l/100 km mpgimp}} in favorable driving conditions.  The later 1.5 liter American-market CRX HF (high fuel economy) model (chassis codes EC1 and AF) could also reliably achieve very good gas mileage, more than a decade before gas-electric [[Hybrid car|hybrids]] appeared on the market, and at no price premium over the base model; the 1.5 liter is rated by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) (under the new rating system) at {{convert|42|mpgU.S.|l/100 km mpgimp}} city and {{convert|51|mpgU.S.|l/100 km mpgimp}} highway.<ref>[http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=2911 Gas Mileage of 1987 Honda Civic CRX HF], fueleconomy.gov website</ref>\n\n===U.S. model curb weights===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" Style=\"text-align:center\"\n!\n!Colspan=\"2\"| CRX\n!| CRX HF\n!| CRX Si\n|-\n|\n| Manual\n| Automatic\n| Manual\n| Manual\n|-\n| 1984\n|{{convert|1819|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|\n|\n| -\n|-\n| 1985\n|{{convert|1819|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|\n|{{convert|1713|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|{{convert|1953|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}\n|-\n| '86-'87\n|{{convert|1865|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}<ref name=\"1986 Service Manual\">Helm Inc., Honda Civic CRX Service Manual 1986, p. 3-9</ref>\n|{{convert|1898|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}<ref name=\"1986 Service Manual\" />\n|{{convert|1713|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}<ref name=\"1986 Service Manual\" />\n|{{convert|1978|lb|kg|abbr=on|0}}<ref name=\"1986 Service Manual\" />\n|}\n\n==Second generation==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Second generation\n| image = 1991CRXSi.jpg\n| caption = 1991 Honda CRX Si in Tahitian green\n| production = 1987&ndash;1991\n| model_years = 1988-1991\n| wheelbase = {{convert|90.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| length = {{convert|148.|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (1990\u201391)<br>{{convert|147.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (1988\u201389)\n| width = {{convert|65.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (1990\u201391)<br>{{convert|65.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (1988\u201389)\n| height = {{convert|50.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (1990\u201391)<br>{{convert|50|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (1988\u201389)\n| weight = {{convert|820|-|1000|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine = 1.5 L 62 hp ''[[Honda D engine#D15B6|D15B6]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]] (1988\u201389)<br> 72 hp ''[[Honda D engine#D15B6|D15B6]]'' I4 (1990\u201391)<br>1.5 L 92 hp ''[[Honda D engine#D15B2|D15B2]]'' I4<br>1.5 L 103 hp ''[[Honda D engine#D15B|D15B]]''<br>1.6 L 105 HP ''[[Honda D engine#D16A6|D16A6]]'' I4 (1988)<br>1.6 L 108 hp ''[[Honda D engine#D16A6|D16A6]]'' I4 (1989\u201391)<br>1.4 L ''[[Honda D engine#D14A1|D14A1]]'' I4{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}<br>1.6 L 130 hp '' I4<br>1.6 L 120hp ''[[Honda D engine#D16A8|D16A8]]'' I4<br>1.6 L 125-129hp ''[[Honda D engine#D16A9|D16A9]]'' I4<br>1.6 L 130 hp ''[[Honda ZC engine|D16ZC]]'' I4<br>1.6 L VTEC 150 hp ''[[Honda B engine#B16A1|B16A1]]'' I4\n|transmission = 5-speed manual, 4-speed automatic (DX only)\n}}\n\n===Overview===\nThe chassis was significantly changed in 1988, from its original torsion bar in the front and beam axle and trailing link in the rear to 4-wheel double wishbone suspension, in line with its sister Civic/Ballade models. Outside of North America, this second generation CRX was available with a 1493&nbsp;cc SOHC or an updated version of the 1590&nbsp;cc DOHC ZC engine. Many of these were fitted with fuel injection as standard.\n\n[[File:Hondacrxsirstock.jpg|left|thumb|Honda CR-X SiR]]\nThe VTEC-equipped models also received a makeover, with updated bumpers, lights, hood, brakes, suspensions and dashboard designs amongst other things. Additionally, some of these design changes were added to the concurrent non-VTEC models.\n\nOne of the options for the [[Japanese Domestic Market]] (JDM) CR-X was a glass roof, a fixed glass panel which stretched from the top of the windshield to the top of the hatch opening. Relatively common in Japan, these are sought-after models in other markets.\n\n===Drivetrain===\nIn September 1989, Honda added the 1595&nbsp;cc [[Honda B engine|B16A]] [[VTEC]] engine to the lineup outside of North America. The VTEC (variable valve timing and lift electronic control) engine provided increased power at high RPMs while still allowing low fuel consumption and better idling at low RPMs. The B16A produced {{convert|150|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} in the European 1.6i-VT model (where the engine bore the designation B16A1) and {{convert|160|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} in the JDM SiR model. The CRX was the second car to receive a VTEC engine, shortly after the [[Honda Integra|Integra]], although the CRX was more popular and common.\n[[File:1990 honda crx sir 2.jpg|thumb|1990 Honda CR-X SiR]]\nThe CR-X equipped with the 1.6 DOHC engine (ZC engine) or the 1.6 DOHC VTEC engine (B16A) came with a different hood since the B16A and ZC engines were taller and required additional hood clearances in comparison to the 1.6 SOHC engines.  The ZC engine was only slightly taller than the 1.6 SOHC engine and required additional hood clearance to clear the cam gear cover.  A CR-X equipped with the ZC engine had a hood with a bump on one side which offered the additional necessary clearance.  Cars equipped with a B16A engine came with a hood that was raised across most of the engine bay to offer additional overall clearance for the taller engine.\n\n===US market===\nThree different trim levels were available: The standard (unlabeled, sometimes called the \"DX\") equipped with the 16-valve 1493&nbsp;cc \"D15B2\" engine and dual-point fuel injection (DPFI), the HF (\"high fuel efficiency\") model with the eight-valve 1493&nbsp;cc \"D15B6\" engine and multi-point fuel injection (MPFI), or the Si (sport injected) model with the 16-valve 1590&nbsp;cc \"D16A6\" engine and MPFI. \"DX\" models were available with an automatic transmission, all others had a five-speed manual transmission. A modification was made to the rear of the vehicle on all second generation vehicles in that a glass panel was installed on the upper half of the rear of the vehicle, above the tail lights which aided in rearward visibility in addition to the glass hatchback. This panel is heavily stippled black.\n\n===Features and equipment===\nAir-conditioning was a dealer-installed option on all models.  The Si model came with a power sliding [[sunroof]] and 14-inch alloy wheels.  Underneath, the Si model was equipped with a rear [[anti-sway bar]] along with variable ratio rack-and-pinion steering.  The 90-91 Si models had 4-wheel disc brakes.\n\n===Colors and trim===\nThere were a total of six colors offered each model year.

The del Sol was also badged as the CR-X del Sol in some markets, and known as simply the CR-X in others. It is because of this that the del Sol is generally considered the \"third Generation CR-X\" among enthusiasts, although it was arguably a very different car and Honda had seemingly quite different design goals when they built it.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} In the United States, the del Sol came in three trim lines: S (VXi in Japan, later VGi), Si (ESi in Europe), and VTEC (VTi in Europe) ; the JDM SiR model (not in US) featured a {{convert|170|hp|abbr=on}} B16A2 DOHC VTEC-engine. Production of the del Sol ended in 1997, and thus, the CR-X line was retired.\n\n==Comparison to other Honda vehicles==\nArticles on the 1st generation [[Honda Insight#History|Honda Insight]] have compared its appearance to that of the 1984\u20131991 CRX.<ref>{{cite web|author=Adrian Akau |url=http://www.gizmag.com/2010-honda-insight-world-premiere/10762/ |title=2010 Honda Insight world premiere |publisher=Gizmag.com |date=24 December 2010 |accessdate=2 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, thirteen years after the end of CRX production, Honda released the [[Honda CR-Z|CR-Z]], regarded as the [[spiritual successor]] to the CRX.<ref name=\"20071009insideline\">{{cite web|url= http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=122954|title= 2007 Tokyo Auto Show Preview: Honda CR-Z|accessdate= 22 February 2008|date= 9 October 2007|work= Inside Line|publisher= [[edmunds.com|edmunds]]|quote= Honda says the name of its sporty two-passenger concept for Tokyo \u2014 CR-Z \u2014 stands for \"Compact Renaissance Zero.\"}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nThe CRX was ''Motor Trend''{{'}}s [[Car of the Year|Import Car of the Year]] for 1984 and 1990, with the CRX-SI model also taking that title in 1988.
