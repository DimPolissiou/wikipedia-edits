It is not zero evil, but it is the lesser of these two evils and we intend to move forward that direction. That is our responsibility and to abdicate that is to insult the Americans that voted us into office.\" A statement provided by his office later that same day said \"It's hyperbolic to say that the only choices before us are the two corner solutions: no economy or widespread casualties.

In the interview with WIBC Radio in Indianapolis Hollingsworth said: \"The social scientists are telling us about the economic disaster that is going on. Our (Gross Domestic Product) is supposed to be down 20% alone this quarter,\" Hollingsworth said. \"It is policymakers' decision to put on our big boy and big girl pants and say it is the lesser of these two evils. It is not zero evil, but it is the lesser of these two evils and we intend to move forward that direction. That is our responsibility and to abdicate that is to insult the Americans that voted us into office.\" A statement provided by his office later that same day said \"It's hyperbolic to say that the only choices before us are the two corner solutions: no economy or widespread casualties.

It is then edited and broadcast first on Friday evening at 18:30, then repeated on the Saturday lunchtime. The final 28 minute show is significantly shorter than the original recording.  In 2012 the BBC began making an extended version for [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]].\n\nEach week, four panellists appear on the show. They are usually either [[comedian]]s or [[journalists]], and sometimes [[politicians]]. Journalists predominated in the early years. The ostensible purpose of the show is to test contestants' knowledge of the events of the previous week by asking questions which are usually oblique references to those events.  However this has given way to a general free-for-all where panellists chime in with their own humorous and satirical remarks once the question has been answered. The participants frequently wander off topic. The host ends the discussion of each question with a summary of the events it refers to, usually with a scripted comic punchline, before asking the next question.

It is then edited and broadcast first on Friday evening at 18:30, then repeated on the Saturday lunchtime. The final 28 minute show is significantly shorter than the original recording.  In 2012 the BBC began making an extended version for [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]].\n\nEach week, four panellists appear on the show. They are usually either [[comedian]]s or [[journalists]], and sometimes [[politicians]]. Journalists predominated in the early years. The ostensible purpose of the show is to test contestants' knowledge of the events of the previous week by asking questions which are usually oblique references to those events.  However this has given way to a general free-for-all where panellists chime in with their own humorous and satirical remarks once the question has been answered. The participants frequently wander off topic. The host ends the discussion of each question with a summary of the events it refers to, usually with a scripted comic punchline, before asking the next question. It is not uncommon for the show to get through only two rounds of the panel before the final section is reached. Before the host announces the largely symbolic scores, the panellists read out statements from newspapers and other media which they find amusing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/radio/the_news_quiz/|title=The News Quiz -

In opposition to what the authors see as the \"standard narrative\" of human sexual evolution, they contend that having multiple sexual partners was common and accepted in the [[environment of evolutionary adaptedness]]. The authors contend that mobile, self-contained groups of hunter gatherers were the norm for humans before agriculture led to high population density. Before agriculture, according to the authors,  sex was relatively promiscuous and paternity was not a concern. This dynamic is similar to the mating system of [[Bonobo]]s. According to the book, sexual interactions strengthened the bond of trust in the groups. Far from causing jealousy, social equilibrium and reciprocal obligation were strengthened by playful sexual interactions.\n\nThe book generated a great deal of publicity in the popular press where it was met with generally positive reviews. A number of scholars from related academic disciplines (such as anthropology, evolutionary psychology, primatology, biology, and sexology) have commented on the book. Most have been critical of the book's methodology and conclusions, although some have praised the book.\n\n==Summary==\nThe authors argue that human beings evolved in [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] [[hunter-gatherer]] bands in which sexual interaction was a shared resource, much like food, child care, and group defense.<ref name=Barash/><ref name=Ellsworth/><ref name=Wrapping /><ref name=Humanist>{{cite web|last=Seidman|first=Barry F.|date=March\u2013April 2011|title=Speaking of Sex|url=http://thehumanist.org/march-april-2011/speaking-of-sex/|publisher=Humanist Magazine|accessdate=7 February 2013|author2=Arnell Dowret }}</ref>\n\nThe authors believe that much of [[evolutionary psychology]] has been conducted with a [[bias]] regarding human sexuality. They argue that the public and many researchers are guilty of the \"''[[Flintstones|Flintstonization]]''\" of [[hunter-gatherer]] society, i.e. projecting modern assumptions and beliefs onto earlier societies. Thus the authors believe that there is a false assumption that our species is primarily [[monogamous]] and offer evidence to the contrary.<ref name=Humanist /> They argue, for example, that our [[sexual dimorphism]], [[testicle]] size, [[female copulatory vocalization]], appetite for sexual novelty, various cultural practices, and hidden female [[ovulation]], among other factors strongly suggest a [[non-monogamous]], non-[[polygynous]] history. The authors argue that mate selection among pre-agricultural humans was not the subject of intragroup competition as sex was neither scarce nor commodified. Rather, [[sperm competition]] was a more important paternity factor than [[sexual selection]]. This behavior survives among some remaining hunter-forager groups that believe in [[partible paternity]].\n\nThe authors argue as a result that [[conventional wisdom]] regarding human nature, as well as what they call the ''standard narrative'' of [[evolutionary psychology]], is wrong.<ref name=Humanist /> Their version of the \"standard narrative\" goes like this: Males and females assess the value of mates from perspectives based upon their differing reproductive agendas/capacities. According to the authors:<blockquote>\"[The male] looks for signs of youth, fertility, health, absence of previous sexual experience, and likelihood of future sexual fidelity. In other words, his assessment is skewed toward finding a fertile, healthy young mate with many childbearing years ahead and no current children to drain his resources. She looks for signs of wealth (or at least prospects of future wealth), social status, physical health, and likelihood that he will stick around to protect and provide for their children. Her guy must be willing and able to provide materially for her (especially during pregnancy and breastfeeding) and their children (known as male parental investment).\"</blockquote>Assuming the male and female meet each other's criteria, they mate and form a monogamous pair bond. Following this<blockquote>\"she will be sensitive to indications that he is considering leaving (vigilant toward signs of infidelity involving intimacy with other women that would threaten her access to his resources and protection)\u2014while keeping an eye out (around ovulation, especially) for a quick fling with a man genetically superior to her husband. He will be sensitive to signs of her sexual infidelities (which would reduce his all-important paternity certainty)\u2014while taking advantage of short-term sexual opportunities with other women (as his sperm are easily produced and plentiful).\"<ref name=\"inquisition\">{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Christopher|title=Inquisition|url=http://www.sexatdawn.com/page11/page10/page10.html|publisher=sexatdawn.com|accessdate=15 March 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313045906/http://www.sexatdawn.com/page11/page10/page10.html|archivedate=13 March 2013}}</ref> </blockquote>In human mating behavior, the authors state that \"we don\u2019t see [current mating behaviors] as elements of human nature so much as adaptations to social conditions\u2014many of which were introduced with the advent of agriculture no more than ten thousand years ago.\"<ref name=\"inquisition\" />\n\nThe authors take a broad position that goes beyond sexual behavior, arguing that humans are generally more egalitarian and selfless than is often thought. In an interview, Ryan said, \"So we\u2019re not saying that sharing was so widespread because everyone was loving and sitting around the fire singing \u201cKumbaya\u201d every night. The reason that sharing was so widespread\u2014and continues to be in the remaining hunter-gatherer societies in existence\u2014is because it's simply the most efficient way of distributing risk among a group of people.\"<ref name=\"Humanist\" /> However, the [[Neolithic revolution|advent of agriculture]] led to the advent of private property and the accumulation of power and completely changed people's lifestyles. This change in lifestyle fundamentally altered the way people behave and has left modern humans in a situation where their instincts are at odds with the societies in which they live.\n\nThe authors do not take an explicit position in the book regarding the morality or desirability of monogamy or alternative sexual behavior in modern society but argue that people should be made aware of our behavioral history so that they can make better informed choices.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Christopher Ryan|author2=Cacilda Jeth\u00e1, M.D.|lastauthoramp=yes|title=Frequently Asked Questions about Sex at Dawn|url=http://www.sexatdawn.com/page4/page13/page13.html|work=Sex at Dawn Official Website|accessdate=7 February 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123143934/http://www.sexatdawn.com/page4/page13/page13.html|archivedate=23 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Popular media reception===\nAbout six weeks after publication, ''Sex at Dawn'' debuted on ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[New York Times best seller list|best-seller list]] at #24<ref>{{cite news|title=Hardcover Nonfiction Bestseller list|accessdate=2016-05-16|newspaper=The New York Times Sunday Book Review|date=2010-08-08|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2010-08-08/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html}}</ref> and last appeared there as #33 three weeks later.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hardcover Nonfiction Bestseller list|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2010-08-29/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html|accessdate=2016-05-16|newspaper=The New York Times Sunday Book Review|date=2010-08-29}}</ref>\n\nDespite significant academic criticism of the research, reasoning, and conclusions of ''Sex at Dawn'', the book received praise from many non-academic reviewers in the media.

As examples, Johnson cites [[Sarah Hrdy]], [[David P. Barash]], and Judith Lipton. Hrdy, an American anthropologist and primatologist, \"advocated a promiscuous mating system for humans in 1999 in ''The Woman That Never Evolved''. Johnson claims that [[David P. Barash]], a psychologist, and Judith Lipton, a psychiatrist, presented similar arguments in 2001.<ref name=sexy /> However, Johnson's characterization of Barash's position might be overstated as Barash also criticized ''Sex at Dawn'' as follows:<blockquote>\"A little while ago, I worried that the next time someone asked me about the book, ''Sex at Dawn'', by Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jeth\u00e1, I might vomit. An over-reaction? Perhaps. And one likely composed, in part, of simple envy, since their book seems to have sold a lot of copies. At least as contributory, however, is the profoundly annoying fact that ''Sex at Dawn'' has been taken as scientifically valid by large numbers of na\u00efve readers \u2026 whereas it is an intellectually myopic, ideologically driven, pseudo-scientific fraud.</blockquote><blockquote>Written by people who don\u2019t know diddly-squat about evolutionary biology, and\u2014worse yet\u2014who don\u2019t know how much they don\u2019t know, ''Sex at Dawn'' purports to demonstrate that human beings are \u201cnaturally\u201d polyamorous, that (channeling Rousseau) we are born sexually open, omnivorous and pleasure-seeking, but are everywhere\u2014or almost everywhere\u2014in prudish, Victorian chains.</blockquote><blockquote>In the process, the authors trot out any number of biological howlers, not least a profound misreading of not only bonobo (\u201cpygmy chimp\u201d) sexuality, but what, if anything, this implies for ''Homo sapiens''. Their goal (aside from making money, not in itself deplorable), is clearly to justify their own chosen lifestyle \u2026 also not deplorable, except insofar as it has produced intellectual dishonesty combined with misrepresentation of both theory and data: Science fiction, at best.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/brainstorm/sex-at-dusk-2/50099|title=Sex at Dusk|last=Barash|first=David|date=2012-07-21|website=The Chronicle of Higher Education Blogs: Brainstorm|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-26}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Negative critique====\nThe book was criticized for its alleged \"biased reporting of data, theoretical and evidentiary shortcomings, and problematic assumptions\" in a pair of book reviews by anthropologist Ryan Ellsworth.<ref name=Wrapping /><ref>{{cite web|title=Ryan Ellsworth|url=https://missouri.academia.edu/RyanEllsworth/CurriculumVitae|publisher=Academia.edu|accessdate=25 July 2013}}</ref> Writing in the peer-reviewed journal ''[[Evolutionary Psychology (journal)|Evolutionary Psychology]]'', Ellsworth argues that the book misrepresents the state of current research on [[sexual behavior]]. Ellsworth argues that while promiscuity has certainly been part of human behavior, it is \"doubtful that this is because we are promiscuous at heart (this may apply to the behavior of most women more than the desire of most men), shackled by the trappings of a post-agricultural dilemma of our own devices, unable to return to the ancestral days of sexual communism.\" Noting that he could find no previous academic reviews of ''Sex at Dawn'', Ellsworth suggests that the book's positive reception in popular media will project \"a distorted portrayal of current theory and evidence on evolved human sexuality\" to the general public.<ref name=Ellsworth>{{cite journal|last=Ellsworth|first=Ryan|title=The Human That Never Evolved|journal=Evolutionary Psychology|year=2011|volume=9|issue=3|series=3|pages=325\u2013335|doi=10.1177/147470491201000316}}</ref><ref name=Wrapping>{{cite journal|last=Ellsworth|first=Ryan|title=The myth of promiscuity: A review of Lynn Saxon, Sex at Dusk: Lifting the Shiny Wrapping from Sex at Dawn|journal=Evolutionary Psychology|year=2012|volume=10|issue=3|series=3|pages=611\u2013616|doi=10.1177/147470491201000316|citeseerx=10.1.1.365.8383}}</ref> Ellsworth and colleagues also note that contrary to what is argued in ''Sex at Dawn'', \"the existence of partible paternity in some societies does not prove that humans are naturally promiscuous any more so than the existence of monogamy in some societies proves that humans are naturally monogamous\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ellsworth|first=Ryan M.|last2=Bailey|first2=Drew H.|last3=Hill|first3=Kim R.|last4=Hurtado|first4=A.

According to Ryan, they did not argue that human sexuality was the same as bonobo sexuality; but rather that coitus was more frequent than is generally acknowledged, and that a typical human being would have had multiple partners within relatively short periods of time (i.e. each estrus cycle of a female).

In opposition to what the authors see as the \"standard narrative\" of human sexual evolution, they contend that having multiple sexual partners was common and accepted in the [[environment of evolutionary adaptedness]]. The authors contend that mobile, self-contained groups of hunter gatherers were the norm for humans before agriculture led to high population density. Before agriculture, according to the authors,  sex was relatively promiscuous and paternity was not a concern. This dynamic is similar to the mating system of [[Bonobo]]s. According to the book, sexual interactions strengthened the bond of trust in the groups. Far from causing jealousy, social equilibrium and reciprocal obligation were strengthened by playful sexual interactions.\n\nThe book generated a great deal of publicity in the popular press where it was met with generally positive reviews. A number of scholars from related academic disciplines (such as anthropology, evolutionary psychology, primatology, biology, and sexology) have commented on the book. Most have been critical of the book's methodology and conclusions although some have praised the book.\n\n==Summary==\nThe authors argue that human beings evolved in [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] [[hunter-gatherer]] bands in which sexual interaction was a shared resource, much like food, child care, and group defense.<ref name=Barash/><ref name=Ellsworth/><ref name=Wrapping /><ref name=Humanist>{{cite web|last=Seidman|first=Barry F.|date=March\u2013April 2011|title=Speaking of Sex|url=http://thehumanist.org/march-april-2011/speaking-of-sex/|publisher=Humanist Magazine|accessdate=7 February 2013|author2=Arnell Dowret }}</ref>\n\nThe authors believe that much of [[evolutionary psychology]] has been conducted with a [[bias]] regarding human sexuality. They argue that the public and many researchers are guilty of the \"''[[Flintstones|Flintstonization]]''\" of [[hunter-gatherer]] society, i.e. projecting modern assumptions and beliefs onto earlier societies. Thus the authors believe that there is a false assumption that our species is primarily [[monogamous]] and offer evidence to the contrary.<ref name=Humanist /> They argue, for example, that our [[sexual dimorphism]], [[testicle]] size, [[female copulatory vocalization]], appetite for sexual novelty, various cultural practices, and hidden female [[ovulation]], among other factors strongly suggest a [[non-monogamous]], non-[[polygynous]] history. The authors argue that mate selection among pre-agricultural humans was not the subject of intragroup competition as sex was neither scarce nor commodified. Rather, [[sperm competition]] was a more important paternity factor than [[sexual selection]]. This behavior survives among some remaining hunter-forager groups that believe in [[partible paternity]].\n\nThe authors argue as a result that [[conventional wisdom]] regarding human nature, as well as what they call the ''standard narrative'' of [[evolutionary psychology]], is wrong.<ref name=Humanist /> Their version of the \"standard narrative\" goes like this: Males and females assess the value of mates from perspectives based upon their differing reproductive agendas/capacities. According to the authors:<blockquote>\"[The male] looks for signs of youth, fertility, health, absence of previous sexual experience, and likelihood of future sexual fidelity. In other words, his assessment is skewed toward finding a fertile, healthy young mate with many childbearing years ahead and no current children to drain his resources. She looks for signs of wealth (or at least prospects of future wealth), social status, physical health, and likelihood that he will stick around to protect and provide for their children. Her guy must be willing and able to provide materially for her (especially during pregnancy and breastfeeding) and their children (known as male parental investment).\"</blockquote>Assuming the male and female meet each other's criteria, they mate and form a monogamous pair bond. Following this<blockquote>\"she will be sensitive to indications that he is considering leaving (vigilant toward signs of infidelity involving intimacy with other women that would threaten her access to his resources and protection)\u2014while keeping an eye out (around ovulation, especially) for a quick fling with a man genetically superior to her husband. He will be sensitive to signs of her sexual infidelities (which would reduce his all-important paternity certainty)\u2014while taking advantage of short-term sexual opportunities with other women (as his sperm are easily produced and plentiful).\"<ref name=\"inquisition\">{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Christopher|title=Inquisition|url=http://www.sexatdawn.com/page11/page10/page10.html|publisher=sexatdawn.com|accessdate=15 March 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313045906/http://www.sexatdawn.com/page11/page10/page10.html|archivedate=13 March 2013}}</ref> </blockquote>In human mating behavior, the authors state that \"we don\u2019t see [current mating behaviors] as elements of human nature so much as adaptations to social conditions\u2014many of which were introduced with the advent of agriculture no more than ten thousand years ago.\"<ref name=\"inquisition\" />\n\nThe authors take a broad position that goes beyond sexual behavior, arguing that humans are generally more egalitarian and selfless than is often thought. In an interview, Ryan said, \"So we\u2019re not saying that sharing was so widespread because everyone was loving and sitting around the fire singing \u201cKumbaya\u201d every night. The reason that sharing was so widespread\u2014and continues to be in the remaining hunter-gatherer societies in existence\u2014is because it's simply the most efficient way of distributing risk among a group of people.\"<ref name=\"Humanist\" /> However, the [[Neolithic revolution|advent of agriculture]] led to the advent of private property and the accumulation of power and completely changed people's lifestyles. This change in lifestyle fundamentally altered the way people behave and has left modern humans in a situation where their instincts are at odds with the societies in which they live.\n\nThe authors do not take an explicit position in the book regarding the morality or desirability of monogamy or alternative sexual behavior in modern society but argue that people should be made aware of our behavioral history so that they can make better informed choices.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Christopher Ryan|author2=Cacilda Jeth\u00e1, M.D.|lastauthoramp=yes|title=Frequently Asked Questions about Sex at Dawn|url=http://www.sexatdawn.com/page4/page13/page13.html|work=Sex at Dawn Official Website|accessdate=7 February 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123143934/http://www.sexatdawn.com/page4/page13/page13.html|archivedate=23 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Popular media reception===\nAbout six weeks after publication, ''Sex at Dawn'' debuted on ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[New York Times best seller list|best-seller list]] at #24<ref>{{cite news|title=Hardcover Nonfiction Bestseller list|accessdate=2016-05-16|newspaper=The New York Times Sunday Book Review|date=2010-08-08|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2010-08-08/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html}}</ref> and last appeared there as #33 three weeks later.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hardcover Nonfiction Bestseller list|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2010-08-29/hardcover-nonfiction/list.html|accessdate=2016-05-16|newspaper=The New York Times Sunday Book Review|date=2010-08-29}}</ref>\n\nDespite significant academic criticism of the research, reasoning, and conclusions of ''Sex at Dawn'', the book received praise from many non-academic reviewers in the media.

He argues that the main point of the book is to discredit \"the standard narrative.\" He thinks reviewers read too much into the book, which merely seeks to challenge monogamy, rather than categorically reject it in favor of an alternative relationship model.<ref name=podcast/>\n\nSexuality scholar Emily Nagoski agreed with many of the book's criticisms of evolutionary psychology and the book's thesis \"that monogamy is not the innate sociosexual system of humans\" but concluded that \"they come to the wrong conclusion about the nature of human sexuality\" due to errors of reasoning and understanding of evolutionary science.<ref name=\"nagoski\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thedirtynormal.com/blog/2013/02/22/book-review-sex-at-dawn/|title=Book review: Sex at Dawn|last1=Nagoski|first1=Emily|website=The Dirty Normal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808123320/http://www.thedirtynormal.com/blog/2013/02/22/book-review-sex-at-dawn/|archivedate=8 August 2014|url-status=dead|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref> Nagoski ultimately concluded the book was \"sloppily reasoned, contemptuous, and ignorant.\"\n\nLynn Saxon's rebuttal, ''Sex at Dusk'', itemized misrepresented citations and research errors found throughout ''Sex at Dawn''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} In an approving ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' review of ''Sex at Dusk,'' [[David Barash]], co-author of ''[[The Myth of Monogamy: Fidelity and Infidelity in Animals and People]]'' wrote that Ryan and Jeth\u00e1 \"ignore and/or misrepresent reams of anthropology and biology in their eagerness to make a brief for some sort of [[Jean Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]-ian sexual idyll that exists\u2014and/or existed\u2014only in their overheated libidinous imaginations.\"<ref name=\"Barash\">{{cite web|last=Barash|first=David|title=Sex at Dusk|url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/brainstorm/sex-at-dusk-2/50099|publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=21 July 2012|accessdate=27 July 2012}}</ref> Barash favorably quotes Saxon's criticism of ''Sex at Dawn'' for being \"almost all about sex and not much about children ...

It is located north of [[Maldonado Department]], in the municipality of [[Aigu\u00e1]], in a hill range named [[Sierra Carap\u00e9]], which constitutes part of a larger range named [[Cuchilla Grande]]. Its name derived from the curious forms of the rocky elevations of its summit, which are very common in the southern part of this country.\n\n==History==\nUntil 1973, [[Cerro de las \u00c1nimas]] (formerly known as ''Mirador Nacional''), with an elevation of {{convert|501|m|ft|abbr=on}}, was considered the highest point of Uruguay. However, in that year, a group of scientists of the ''Servicio Geogr\u00e1fico Militar'' (''Military Geographic Service'') changed the measure of Cerro Catedral.\n\n==Geography==\n===Location and geology===\n[[Image:Marco del Cerro Catedral.jpg|thumb|left|220px|A [[Triangulation station|geodetic mark]] that indicates the summit]]\nSierra Carap\u00e9, formed in [[Precambrian]] time, crosses the Maldonado Department from west to east and enters the [[Rocha Department]].

Cerro Catedral, or Cerro Cordillera, is situated in the region of Las Ca\u00f1as, in the 8th Judicial Section and the 9th Police Section of the Maldonado Department. Near Cerro Catedral there are the source of Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Stream (''Arroyo Jos\u00e9 Ignacio''), which runs from north to south, and the source of Coronilla Stream (''Arroyo Coronilla''), running to the northwest, which drains into Aigu\u00e1.\n\nThe hill is situated in an area of the range which its formation is mainly [[Granite|granitic]] and [[gneiss]]ic.\n\n===Vegetation===\nIn the highest areas of Cerro Catedral, the vegetation practically does not exist, with the sparse appearance of a shrub called [[Ugni molinae|Myrtus ugni]] between the rocks.

Following the first confirmed case in the Bailiwick, the CCA enacted the Emergency Powers (Coronavirus) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Regulations 2020 on 17 March, a statutory instrument which enables the Medical Officer of Health to implement emergency measures enforceable by law; the first of which mandated that anyone arriving in the Bailiwick [[Isolation (health care)#Self-isolation|self-isolate]] for 14 days. Following the first confirmed case from on-island transmission, the CCA announced an immediate 'lockdown' starting from midnight on 25 March, comprising wide-ranging restrictions on freedom of movement, enforceable in law, whereby people have been ordered to stay at home and 'non-essential' businesses have been ordered to close. Several further emergency regulations have been enacted by the CCA to address the various challenges presented by the pandemic.\n\nThe pandemic has led to socio-economic disruption, the [[List of events affected by the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|cancellation or postponement of sporting and cultural events]], the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on education|closure of schools and colleges]] except for vulnerable children and children of critical workers, restrictions on travel (both within and to and from the Bailiwick), and fears of supply shortages have resulted in [[panic buying]].
