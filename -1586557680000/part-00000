[[Exonuclease]]s digest nucleic acids from the ends. [[Endonuclease]]s act on regions in the ''middle'' of target molecules. They are further subcategorized as [[deoxyribonuclease]]s and [[ribonuclease]]s. The former acts on [[DNA]], the latter on [[RNA]].<ref name=\"Ritti\u00e9Perbal2008\" />\n\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==History== kirrrrrr\nIn the late 1960s, scientists [[Stuart Linn]] and [[Werner Arber]] isolated examples of the two types of enzymes responsible for phage growth restriction in [[Escherichia coli]] ([[E. coli]]) bacteria.<ref>Linn S., Arber, W. (1968). Host specificity of DNA produced by Escherichia coli, X. In vitro restriction of phage fd replicative form. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 59:1300-1306</ref><ref>Arber, W., Linn S. (1969) DNA modification and restriction. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 38:467-500</ref> One of these enzymes added a [[methyl group]] to the DNA, generating [[DNA methylation|methylated DNA]], while the other cleaved unmethylated DNA at a wide variety of locations along the length of the molecule. The first type of enzyme was called a \"[[methylase]]\" and the other a \"[[restriction nuclease]]\". These enzymatic tools were important to scientists who were gathering the tools needed to \"[[cut and paste]]\" DNA molecules. What was then needed was a tool that would cut DNA at specific sites, rather than at random sites along the length of the molecule, so that scientists could cut [[DNA]] molecules in a predictable and reproducible way.\n\nAn important development came when H.O. Smith, K.W. Wilcox, and T.J. Kelley, working at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1968, isolated and characterized the first [[restriction nuclease]] whose functioning depended on a specific DNA [[nucleotide]] sequence. Working with [[Haemophilus influenzae]] bacteria, this group isolated an enzyme, called [[HindII|''Hind''II]], that always cut DNA molecules at a particular point within a specific sequence of six base pairs. They found that the ''Hind''II enzyme always cuts directly in the center of this sequence (between the 3rd and 4th base pairs)\n\n==Numerical Classification System==\nMost nucleases are classified by the [[Enzyme Commission number]] of the \"Nomenclature Committee of the [[International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology]]\" as [[hydrolase]]s (EC-number 3). The nucleases belong just like [[phosphodiesterase]], [[lipase]] and [[phosphatase]] to the [[esterase]]s (EC-number 3.1), a subgroup of the hydrolases. The esterases to which nucleases belong are classified with the EC-numbers 3.1.11 - EC-number 3.1.31.\n\n==Structure==\nNuclease [[protein primary structure|primary structure]] is by and large poorly conserved and minimally conserved at active sites, the surfaces of which primarily comprise acidic and basic amino acid residues. Nucleases can be classified into folding families.<ref name=\"nm200224\"/>\n\n==Site recognition==\nA nuclease must associate with a nucleic acid before it can cleave the molecule. That entails a degree of recognition. Nucleases variously employ both nonspecific and specific associations in their modes of recognition and binding. Both modes play important roles in living organisms, especially in DNA repair.<ref name=\"nm2002pp2728\">{{Cite journal |last=Nishino |first=Tatsuya |last2=Morikawa |first2=Kosuke |year=2002 |title=Structure and function of nucleases in DNA repair: shape, grip and blade of the DNA scissors |journal=Oncogene |volume=21 |issue=58 |pages=9027\u20139028 |doi=10.1038/sj.onc.1206135|pmid=12483517 }}</ref>\n\nNonspecific endonucleases involved in DNA repair can scan DNA for [[recognition sequence|target sequences]] or [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|damage]]. Such a nuclease diffuses along DNA until it encounters a target, upon which the [[amino acid residue|residues]] of its [[active site]] interact with the chemical groups of the DNA. In the case of endonucleases such as [[EcoRV]], [[BamHI]], and PvuII, this nonspecific binding involves electrostatic interactions between minimal surface area of the protein and the DNA. This weak association leaves the overall shape of the DNA undeformed, remaining in [[B-DNA|B-form]].<ref name=\"nm2002pp2728\"/>\n\nA site-specific nuclease forms far stronger associations by contrast. It draws DNA into the deep groove of its [[DNA-binding domain]]. This results in significant deformation of the DNA [[nucleic acid tertiary structure|tertiary structure]] and is accomplished with a surfaces rich in [[base (chemistry)|basic]] (positively charged) residues. It engages in extensive electrostatic interaction with the DNA.<ref name=\"nm2002pp2728\"/>\n\nSome nucleases involved in DNA repair exhibit partial sequence-specificity. however most are nonspecific, instead recognizing structural abnormalities produced in the DNA [[backbone chain|backbone]] by [[base pair]] mismatches.<ref name=\"nm2002pp2728\"/>\n\n===Structure specific nuclease===\n\nFor details see [[flap endonuclease]].\n\n===Sequence specific nuclease===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n!Enzyme!!Source!!Recognition Sequence!!Cut\n|-\n|[[HindII|''Hind''II]]||''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''\n|\n5'\u2013GTYRAC\u20133'<br >\n3'\u2013CARYTG\u20135'\n|\n5'\u2013{{Background colour|#9DF|GTY}} {{Background colour|#DDD|RAC}}\u20133'<br />\n3'\u2013{{Background colour|#DDD|CAR}} {{Background colour|#9DF|YTG}}\u20135'\n|-\n|colspan=4|R = [[Adenine|A]] or [[Guanine|G]]; Y = [[Cytosine|C]] or [[Thymine|T]]\n|}\n\nThere are more than 900 restriction enzymes, some sequence specific and some not, have been isolated from over 230 strains of bacteria since the initial discovery of ''Hind''II. These restriction enzymes generally have names that reflect their origin&mdash;The first letter of the name comes from the genus and the second two letters come from the species of the prokaryotic cell from which they were isolated. For example, [[EcoRI|''Eco''RI]] comes from [[Escherichia coli]] RY13 bacteria, while HindII comes from [[Haemophilus influenzae]] strain Rd. Numbers following the nuclease names indicate the order in which the enzymes were isolated from single strains of bacteria: [[EcoRI|''Eco''RI]], [[EcoRII|''Eco''RII]].\n\n==Endonucleases==\n\nA restriction endonuclease functions by \"scanning\" the length of a DNA molecule. Once it encounters its particular specific recognition sequence, it will bind to the DNA molecule and makes one cut in each of the two sugar-phosphate backbones. The positions of these two cuts, both in relation to each other, and to the recognition sequence itself, are determined by the identity of the restriction endonuclease. Different endonucleases yield different sets of cuts, but one endonuclease will always cut a particular base sequence the same way, no matter what DNA molecule it is acting on.

[[DNA replication]] is an error prone process, and DNA molecules themselves are vulnerable to modification by many metabolic and environmental stressors.

Many nucleases participate in DNA repair by recognizing damage sites and cleaving them from the surrounding DNA. These enzymes function independently or in [[multiprotein complex|complexes]].

In prokaryotes, this role is primarily filled by MutSLH and [[very short patch repair]] (VSP repair) associated proteins.\n\nThe MutSLH system (comprising [[MutS]], MutL, and MutH) corrects [[point mutation]]s and small [[turn (biochemistry)|turns]]. MutS recognizes and binds to mismatches, where it recruits MutL and MutH. MutL mediates the interaction between MutS and MutH, and enhances the endonucleasic activity of the latter. MutH recognizes hemimethylated <code>5'\u2014GATC\u20143'</code> sites and cleaves next to the <code>G</code> of the non-methylated strand (the more recently synthesized strand).\n\nVSP repair is initiated by the endonuclease Vsr. It corrects a specific <code>T/G</code> mismatch caused by the spontaneous [[deamination]] of [[methylated]] cytosines to thymines. Vsr recognizes the sequence <code>5'\u2014C<u>T</u>[[nucleic acid notation|W]]GG\u20143'</code>,\nwhere it nicks the DNA strand on the 5' side of the mismatched thymine (underlined in the previous sequence). One of the exonucleases RecJ, [[Exonuclease VII|ExoVII]], or [[Exodeoxyribonuclease I|ExoI]] then degrades the site before DNA polymerase resynthesizes the gap in the strand.<ref name=\"nm200224\"/>\n\n====Base excision repair====\n[[AP site]] formation is a common occurrence in dsDNA. It is the result of spontaneous hydrolysis and the activity of [[DNA glycosylase]]s as an intermediary step in [[base excision repair]]. These AP sites are removed by [[AP endonuclease]]s, which effect single strand breaks around the site.<ref name=\"nm200224\"/>\n\n====Nucleotide excision repair====\n[[Nucleotide excision repair]], not to be confused with base excision repair, involves the removal and replacement of damaged nucleotides. Instances of [[crosslinking of DNA|crosslinking]], [[DNA adduct|adducts]], and [[DNA lesion|lesions]] (generated by ultraviolet light or [[reactive oxygen species]]) can trigger this repair pathway. Short stretches of single stranded DNA containing such damaged nucleotide are removed from duplex DNA by separate endonucleases effecting nicks upstream and downstream of the damage. Deletions or mutations which affect these nucleases instigate increased sensitivity to ultraviolet damage and carcinogenesis. Such abnormalities can even impinge neural development.\n\nIn bacteria, both cuts executed by the [[UvrABC|UvrB-UvrC]] complex. In budding yeast, Rad2 and the Rad1-Rad10 complex make the 5' and 3' cuts, respectively. In mammals, the homologs [[ERCC5|XPG]] and [[ERCC4|XPF]]-[[ERCC1]] affect the same respective nicks.<ref name=\"nm200225\"/>\n\n====Double-strand break repair====\n[[Double-strand break]]s, both intentional and unintentional, regularly occur in cells. Unintentional breaks are commonly generated by [[ionizing radiation]], various exogenous and endogenous chemical agents, and halted replication forks. Intentional breaks are generated as intermediaries in [[meiosis]] and [[V(D)J recombination|V(D)J]] [[genetic recombination|recombination]], which are primarily repaired through [[homologous recombination]] and [[non-homologous end joining]]. Both cases require the ends in double strand breaks be processed by nucleases before repair can take place. One such nuclease is [[Mre11]] complexed with [[Rad50]]. Mutations of Mre11 can precipitate [[ataxia-telangiectasia]]-like disorder.<ref name=\"nm200225\">{{Cite journal |last=Nishino |first=Tatsuya |last2=Morikawa |first2=Kosuke |year=2002 |title=Structure and function of nucleases in DNA repair: shape, grip and blade of the DNA scissors |journal=Oncogene |volume=21 |issue=58 |pages=9024, 9025 |doi=10.1038/sj.onc.1206135|pmid=12483517 }}</ref>\n\nV(D)J recombination involves opening [[stem-loop]]s structures associated with double-strand breaks and subsequently joining both ends. The [[Artemis complex|Artemis-DNAPK<sub>cs</sub> complex]] participates in this reaction. Although Artemis exhibits 5' \u2192 3' ssDNA exonuclease activity when alone, its complexing with [[DNA-PKcs|DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub>]] allows for endonucleasic processing of the stem-loops. Defects of either protein confers severe immunodeficiency.<ref name=\"nm200225\" />\n\nHomologous recombination, on the other hand, involves two [[homologous chromosome|homologous DNA]] duplexes connected by [[D-loop]]s or [[Holliday junction]]s. In bacteria, endonucleases like [[RuvABC|RuvC]] ''resolve'' Holliday junctions into two separate dsDNAs by cleaving the junctions at two symmetrical sites near the junction centre. In eukaryotes, [[FEN1]], [[ERCC4|XPF]]-[[ERCC1]], and [[MUS81]] cleave the D-loops, and [[crossover junction endodeoxyribonuclease|Cce1]]/[[Ydc2]] processes Holliday junctions in mitochondria.<ref name=\"nm200225\" />\n\n== Meganucleases ==\n{{main|meganuclease}}The frequency at which a particular nuclease will cut a given DNA molecule depends on the complexity of the DNA and the length of the nuclease's recognition sequence; due to the statistical likelihood of finding the bases in a particular order by chance, a longer recognition sequence will result in less frequent digestion. For example, a given four-base sequence (corresponding to the recognition site for a hypothetical nuclease) would be predicted to occur every 256 base pairs on average (where 4^4=256),  but any given six-base sequence would be expected to occur once every 4,096 base pairs on average (4^6=4096).\n\nOne unique family of nucleases is the [[meganuclease]]s, which are characterized by having larger, and therefore less common, recognition sequences consisting of 12 to 40 base pairs. These nucleases are particularly useful for genetic engineering and [[Genome engineering]] applications in complex organisms such as plants and mammals, where typically larger genomes (numbering in the billions of base pairs) would result in frequent and deleterious site-specific digestion using traditional nucleases.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Nuclease protection assay]]\n* [[Micrococcal nuclease]]\n* [[S1 nuclease]]\n* [[P1 nuclease]]\n* [[HindIII]]\n* [[PIN domain]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.accessexcellence.org/AE/AEC/CC/re_chart.html Examples of Restriction Enzymes Chart]\n* [http://www.accessexcellence.org/AE/AEC/CC/action.html Restriction Enzyme Action of EcoRI]\n* [http://www.accessexcellence.org/AE/AEC/CC/enzyme_glossary.html Enzyme glossary]\n* [http://arbl.cvmbs.colostate.edu/hbooks/genetics/biotech/enzymes/nucleases.html Nucleases (Main source of the page...)]\n\n{{Esterases}}\n{{Enzymes}}\n{{Portal bar|Biology|border=no}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:EC 3.1]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:HindIII Restriction site and sticky ends vector.svg|thumb|Depiction of the [[restriction enzyme]] (endonuclease) [[HindIII]] cleaving a double-stranded DNA molecule at a valid [[restriction site]] ({{nowrap|5'\u2013A&#124;AGCTT\u20133'}}).]]\n\nA '''nuclease''' (also archaically known as '''nucleodepolymerase''' or '''polynucleotidase''') is an [[enzyme]] capable of cleaving the [[phosphodiester bond]]s between [[nucleotide]]s of [[nucleic acid]]s.

(1968). Host specificity of DNA produced by Escherichia coli, X. In vitro restriction of phage fd replicative form. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 59:1300-1306</ref><ref>Arber, W., Linn S. (1969) DNA modification and restriction. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 38:467-500</ref> One of these enzymes added a [[methyl group]] to the DNA, generating [[DNA methylation|methylated DNA]], while the other cleaved unmethylated DNA at a wide variety of locations along the length of the molecule. The first type of enzyme was called a \"[[methylase]]\" and the other a \"[[restriction nuclease]]\". These enzymatic tools were important to scientists who were gathering the tools needed to \"[[cut and paste]]\" DNA molecules. What was then needed was a tool that would cut DNA at specific sites, rather than at random sites along the length of the molecule, so that scientists could cut [[DNA]] molecules in a predictable and reproducible way.\n\nAn important development came when H.O. Smith, K.W. Wilcox, and T.J. Kelley, working at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1968, isolated and characterized the first [[restriction nuclease]] whose functioning depended on a specific DNA [[nucleotide]] sequence. Working with [[Haemophilus influenzae]] bacteria, this group isolated an enzyme, called [[HindII|''Hind''II]], that always cut DNA molecules at a particular point within a specific sequence of six base pairs. They found that the ''Hind''II enzyme always cuts directly in the center of this sequence (between the 3rd and 4th base pairs)\n\n==Numerical Classification System==\nMost nucleases are classified by the [[Enzyme Commission number]] of the \"Nomenclature Committee of the [[International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology]]\" as [[hydrolase]]s (EC-number 3). The nucleases belong just like [[phosphodiesterase]], [[lipase]] and [[phosphatase]] to the [[esterase]]s (EC-number 3.1), a subgroup of the hydrolases. The esterases to which nucleases belong are classified with the EC-numbers 3.1.11 - EC-number 3.1.31.\n\n==Structure==\nNuclease [[protein primary structure|primary structure]] is by and large poorly conserved and minimally conserved at active sites, the surfaces of which primarily comprise acidic and basic amino acid residues. Nucleases can be classified into folding families.<ref name=\"nm200224\"/>\n\n==Site recognition==\nA nuclease must associate with a nucleic acid before it can cleave the molecule. That entails a degree of recognition. Nucleases variously employ both nonspecific and specific associations in their modes of recognition and binding. Both modes play important roles in living organisms, especially in DNA repair.<ref name=\"nm2002pp2728\">{{Cite journal |last=Nishino |first=Tatsuya |last2=Morikawa |first2=Kosuke |year=2002 |title=Structure and function of nucleases in DNA repair: shape, grip and blade of the DNA scissors |journal=Oncogene |volume=21 |issue=58 |pages=9027\u20139028 |doi=10.1038/sj.onc.1206135|pmid=12483517 }}</ref>\n\nNonspecific endonucleases involved in DNA repair can scan DNA for [[recognition sequence|target sequences]] or [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|damage]]. Such a nuclease diffuses along DNA until it encounters a target, upon which the [[amino acid residue|residues]] of its [[active site]] interact with the chemical groups of the DNA. In the case of endonucleases such as [[EcoRV]], [[BamHI]], and PvuII, this nonspecific binding involves electrostatic interactions between minimal surface area of the protein and the DNA. This weak association leaves the overall shape of the DNA undeformed, remaining in [[B-DNA|B-form]].<ref name=\"nm2002pp2728\"/>\n\nA site-specific nuclease forms far stronger associations by contrast. It draws DNA into the deep groove of its [[DNA-binding domain]]. This results in significant deformation of the DNA [[nucleic acid tertiary structure|tertiary structure]] and is accomplished with a surfaces rich in [[base (chemistry)|basic]] (positively charged) residues. It engages in extensive electrostatic interaction with the DNA.<ref name=\"nm2002pp2728\"/>\n\nSome nucleases involved in DNA repair exhibit partial sequence-specificity. however most are nonspecific, instead recognizing structural abnormalities produced in the DNA [[backbone chain|backbone]] by [[base pair]] mismatches.<ref name=\"nm2002pp2728\"/>\n\n===Structure specific nuclease===\n\nFor details see [[flap endonuclease]].\n\n===Sequence specific nuclease===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n!Enzyme!!Source!!Recognition Sequence!!Cut\n|-\n|[[HindII|''Hind''II]]||''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''\n|\n5'\u2013GTYRAC\u20133'<br >\n3'\u2013CARYTG\u20135'\n|\n5'\u2013{{Background colour|#9DF|GTY}} {{Background colour|#DDD|RAC}}\u20133'<br />\n3'\u2013{{Background colour|#DDD|CAR}} {{Background colour|#9DF|YTG}}\u20135'\n|-\n|colspan=4|R = [[Adenine|A]] or [[Guanine|G]]; Y = [[Cytosine|C]] or [[Thymine|T]]\n|}\n\nThere are more than 900 restriction enzymes, some sequence specific and some not, have been isolated from over 230 strains of bacteria since the initial discovery of ''Hind''II. These restriction enzymes generally have names that reflect their origin&mdash;The first letter of the name comes from the genus and the second two letters come from the species of the prokaryotic cell from which they were isolated. For example, [[EcoRI|''Eco''RI]] comes from [[Escherichia coli]] RY13 bacteria, while HindII comes from [[Haemophilus influenzae]] strain Rd. Numbers following the nuclease names indicate the order in which the enzymes were isolated from single strains of bacteria: [[EcoRI|''Eco''RI]], [[EcoRII|''Eco''RII]].\n\n==Endonucleases==\n\nA restriction endonuclease functions by \"scanning\" the length of a DNA molecule. Once it encounters its particular specific recognition sequence, it will bind to the DNA molecule and makes one cut in each of the two sugar-phosphate backbones. The positions of these two cuts, both in relation to each other, and to the recognition sequence itself, are determined by the identity of the restriction endonuclease. Different endonucleases yield different sets of cuts, but one endonuclease will always cut a particular base sequence the same way, no matter what DNA molecule it is acting on. Once the cuts have been made, the DNA molecule will break into fragments.\n\n===Staggered cutting===\n\nNot all restriction endonucleases cut symmetrically and leave blunt ends like ''Hind''II described above.

These AP sites are removed by [[AP endonuclease]]s, which effect single strand breaks around the site.<ref name=\"nm200224\"/>\n\n====Nucleotide excision repair====\n[[Nucleotide excision repair]], not to be confused with base excision repair, involves the removal and replacement of damaged nucleotides. Instances of [[crosslinking of DNA|crosslinking]], [[DNA adduct|adducts]], and [[DNA lesion|lesions]] (generated by ultraviolet light or [[reactive oxygen species]]) can trigger this repair pathway. Short stretches of single stranded DNA containing such damaged nucleotide are removed from duplex DNA by separate endonucleases effecting nicks upstream and downstream of the damage. Deletions or mutations which affect these nucleases instigate increased sensitivity to ultraviolet damage and carcinogenesis. Such abnormalities can even impinge neural development.\n\nIn bacteria, both cuts executed by the [[UvrABC|UvrB-UvrC]] complex. In budding yeast, Rad2 and the Rad1-Rad10 complex make the 5' and 3' cuts, respectively. In mammals, the homologs [[ERCC5|XPG]] and [[ERCC4|XPF]]-[[ERCC1]] affect the same respective nicks.<ref name=\"nm200225\"/>\n\n====Double-strand break repair====\n[[Double-strand break]]s, both intentional and unintentional, regularly occur in cells. Unintentional breaks are commonly generated by [[ionizing radiation]], various exogenous and endogenous chemical agents, and halted replication forks. Intentional breaks are generated as intermediaries in [[meiosis]] and [[V(D)J recombination|V(D)J]] [[genetic recombination|recombination]], which are primarily repaired through [[homologous recombination]] and [[non-homologous end joining]]. Both cases require the ends in double strand breaks be processed by nucleases before repair can take place. One such nuclease is [[Mre11]] complexed with [[Rad50]]. Mutations of Mre11 can precipitate [[ataxia-telangiectasia]]-like disorder.<ref name=\"nm200225\">{{Cite journal |last=Nishino |first=Tatsuya |last2=Morikawa |first2=Kosuke |year=2002 |title=Structure and function of nucleases in DNA repair: shape, grip and blade of the DNA scissors |journal=Oncogene |volume=21 |issue=58 |pages=9024, 9025 |doi=10.1038/sj.onc.1206135|pmid=12483517 }}</ref>\n\nV(D)J recombination involves opening [[stem-loop]]s structures associated with double-strand breaks and subsequently joining both ends. The [[Artemis complex|Artemis-DNAPK<sub>cs</sub> complex]] participates in this reaction. Although Artemis exhibits 5' \u2192 3' ssDNA exonuclease activity when alone, its complexing with [[DNA-PKcs|DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub>]] allows for endonucleasic processing of the stem-loops. Defects of either protein confers severe immunodeficiency.<ref name=\"nm200225\" />\n\nHomologous recombination, on the other hand, involves two [[homologous chromosome|homologous DNA]] duplexes connected by [[D-loop]]s or [[Holliday junction]]s. In bacteria, endonucleases like [[RuvABC|RuvC]] ''resolve'' Holliday junctions into two separate dsDNAs by cleaving the junctions at two symmetrical sites near the junction centre. In eukaryotes, [[FEN1]], [[ERCC4|XPF]]-[[ERCC1]], and [[MUS81]] cleave the D-loops, and [[crossover junction endodeoxyribonuclease|Cce1]]/[[Ydc2]] processes Holliday junctions in mitochondria.<ref name=\"nm200225\" />\n\n== Meganucleases ==\n{{main|meganuclease}}The frequency at which a particular nuclease will cut a given DNA molecule depends on the complexity of the DNA and the length of the nuclease's recognition sequence; due to the statistical likelihood of finding the bases in a particular order by chance, a longer recognition sequence will result in less frequent digestion. For example, a given four-base sequence (corresponding to the recognition site for a hypothetical nuclease) would be predicted to occur every 256 base pairs on average (where 4^4=256),  but any given six-base sequence would be expected to occur once every 4,096 base pairs on average (4^6=4096).\n\nOne unique family of nucleases is the [[meganuclease]]s, which are characterized by having larger, and therefore less common, recognition sequences consisting of 12 to 40 base pairs. These nucleases are particularly useful for genetic engineering and [[Genome engineering]] applications in complex organisms such as plants and mammals, where typically larger genomes (numbering in the billions of base pairs) would result in frequent and deleterious site-specific digestion using traditional nucleases.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Nuclease protection assay]]\n* [[Micrococcal nuclease]]\n* [[S1 nuclease]]\n* [[P1 nuclease]]\n* [[HindIII]]\n* [[PIN domain]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.accessexcellence.org/AE/AEC/CC/re_chart.html Examples of Restriction Enzymes Chart]\n* [http://www.accessexcellence.org/AE/AEC/CC/action.html Restriction Enzyme Action of EcoRI]\n* [http://www.accessexcellence.org/AE/AEC/CC/enzyme_glossary.html Enzyme glossary]\n* [http://arbl.cvmbs.colostate.edu/hbooks/genetics/biotech/enzymes/nucleases.html Nucleases (Main source of the page...)]\n\n{{Esterases}}\n{{Enzymes}}\n{{Portal bar|Biology|border=no}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:EC 3.1]]\n", "name_user": "188.158.189.32", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclease"}
