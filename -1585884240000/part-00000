These lights may be dedicated emergency lights, such as a beacon or a light bar, or may be modified stock lighting, such as a [[wig-wag (automobile)|wig-wag]] or hide-away light, and are additional to any standard lighting on the car such as [[hazard lights]].  Often, they are used along with a [[Siren (noisemaker)|siren]] (or occasionally sirens) in order to increase their effectiveness.  In many jurisdictions, the use of these lights may afford the user specific legal powers, and may place requirements on other road users to behave differently, such as compelling them to pull to the side of the road and yield right of way so the emergency vehicle may proceed through unimpeded.\n\nLaws regarding and restricting the use of these lights vary widely among jurisdictions, and in some areas non-emergency vehicles (e.g. school buses) and semi-emergency vehicles (e.g. tow trucks) may be permitted to use similar lights.  These non-and semi-emergency lights are also discussed here.  Research into the usefulness and potential dangers of these lights is also presented.\n\nEmergency vehicle lighting is a sub-type of [[emergency vehicle equipment]].\n\n== History ==\nThe use of the blue emergency light originates in Germany during [[World War II]]. As a result of the \u2018Verdunkelung\u2019, a black-out measure for aerial defense from 1935, cobalt blue was regulated to replace the red color used until 1938 in emergency vehicle lights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amaot.de/bunker/8dfgvo.htm|title=Bunker in Braunschweig {{!}} Luftschutzgesetz - 8.

Brunswig|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Due to the [[scattering]] properties of the blue color, it is only visible to lower altitudes and is therefore less easily spotted by enemy airplanes.\n\n==Purpose==\nEmergency vehicle lighting is generally used to clear the right of way for [[emergency vehicle]]s, or to warn approaching motorists of potential hazards, such as a vehicle that is stopped or moving slower than the rate of traffic, or a car that has been pulled over. It may also be used to provide specific directions to motorists, such as a command to pull over. Some vehicles incorporate a small arrow board to direct traffic.\n\nThe use of emergency beacons is restricted by law in many jurisdictions only for responding to an emergency, initiating a traffic stop, bona fide training exercises, or when a specific hazard exists in the road. Most private security agencies have special permits that allow them to use beacons in specific areas. It has yet to be determined whether autonomous vehicles will be required to carry lights, or what colors or patterns they might exhibit to warn off aggressive human drivers.\n\n==Optical types==\nThe optical and mechanical characteristics of the lights used can have a significant effect on the look of the vehicle and how readily it gains attention in emergencies.\n\n===Steady burning===\nThe simplest form of lighting is a steadily burning lamp.  These may be white lights used on scene to enable emergency workers to see what they are doing, or they may be colored lights that advertise the emergency vehicle's presence.  In the latter case, steadily burning lights are often used alongside rotating or flashing lights rather than on their own, though historically some emergency vehicles only displayed steadily burning lights.  For example, California Vehicle Code Section 25252 states: \u201cEvery authorized emergency vehicle shall be equipped with at least one steady burning red warning lamp visible from at least 1,000 feet to the front of the vehicle\u201d\n\n===Rotating light===\n[[File:Composite green beacon photo.jpg|thumb|right|'''The parts and workings of a rotating light''': '''Top''' The assembled beacon, including an optional mirror to be used when the beacon is placed in the windshield or rear window. '''Center''' The beacon, with the mirror removed. '''Bottom left and right''' The green dome of the beacon has been removed to show its rotating reflector, stationary incandescent lamp, and electric motor.]]\nThese revolving lights may contain a single, stationary bulb around which a curved mirror is spun (or which is attached to a spinning mirror), or a lamp with a [[Fresnel lens]].  This creates rotating beam(s) of light, appearing to flash when viewed.  Larger rotating lights may contain modular or [[sealed beam|sealed-beam]] lamps which rotate as an assembly (commonly 2 or 4 bulbs, but possibly 1 or 3).\n\nTo protect the workings of the beacon, a plastic dome often covers the assembly.  These domes usually come in solid colors, but in some cases the front and back halves of the dome are different colors.  Other beacons use a clear dome with colored lenses on each lamp; in the latter case, these rotating beacons are sometimes referred to colloquially as \u2018[[gumball machine]]s\u2019 or sometimes \u2018cherry tops\u2019 in the case of red lights.\n\nRotating lights often use a [[Halogen lamp|quartz-halogen]] or conventional [[Incandescent light bulb|incandescent]] bulb, though some rotating beacons are now made with LEDs rather than bulbs.<ref>e.g. [http://www.aps-supply.com/product_details.php?itemid=540 Preco\u2019s 7600 series] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308170909/http://www.aps-supply.com/product_details.php?itemid=540 |date=2009-03-08 }}</ref>\n\nRotating lights may be used in lightbars as well as in single beacons.  In a modern enclosed lightbar, generally \u2018V\u2019- or diamond-shaped mirrors are provided between the lamps to give the effect of multiple flashing lights.\n\n===Strobe lights===\nSome emergency lighting is based on [[strobe light]]s similar to those used in flash photography.  These [[xenon flash lamp]]s put out a very brief but very bright flash by discharging a large current through a gas which ionizes the gas.  The light produced has a somewhat bluish [[emission spectrum]], which makes red lightbars glow a fuchsia-pink color when lit.\n\nStrobe Lighting did provide intense light which could improve visibility, however the short duration of the individual flash made it necessary to design the electronics to issue multiple consecutive flashes before alternating with the other associated lens pair. This purportedly allowed time for the human eye and mind to key in and observe the source of the light.  Since the changeover to L.E.D. lighting units, which could easily allow for longer duration illumination time, they have instead chosen to mimic what is actually a shortcoming of the strobe light, and design the L.E.D. light head to illuminate with multiple short duration flashes.  It has been noted that depending on the surrounding lighting conditions and other vehicle lighting, strobe only warning lighting did not allow for the same level of perception of distance from the source that traditional light bar and incandescent flashing lights would provide, especially on dark highways and similar locations.\n\n===LED lighting===\n[[File:I-35W-collapse-police-Minneapolis-20070801.jpg|thumb|left|Police cars sit at the base of the [[I-35W Mississippi River bridge|I-35W bridge collapse]]. The lightbars mounted on the cars are LED-based.  The illuminated back-up lamps seen in the two cars in the foreground are being used as emergency lights which operate on a different circuit, rather than burning steadily to indicate that the cars are in reverse gear.]]\n\n[[File:LED-Blaulicht-VW-T5.jpg|thumb|LED-lights on a [[Volkswagen Transporter]] ambulance]]\n\nLED-based lighting is becoming very popular in the emergency services for several reasons.  [[Light-emitting diode]]s are small, completely solid state, very power-efficient, long-lasting (as they have no filaments to burn out) and can be seen very easily even at great distances and in sunlight.\n\nWhether as lightbars or single beacons, LED-based lights typically use a clear, colorless dome because the light color is an intrinsic property of the LEDs themselves.  LED-based lightbars can be made very thin, reducing [[Drag (physics)|wind resistance]] by around 8-10 percent,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz-police/news/article.cfm?o_id=131&objectid=10542312|title=Arresting image update to save police force $800,000 |last=Binning|first=Elizabeth |date=11 November 2008|publisher=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=2009-03-23}}</ref> or made very flat and used in novel applications, for example to flip up under a sun visor.\n\nLED lights are often used in a mode similar to conventional strobe lights, however they can be programmed with a wider variety of flash patterns because of their ability to be switched directly by electronics, as opposed to discharging a capacitor through a gas-filled tube.\n\nLED lights produce relatively little heat when in use. In colder inclement climates, this has resulted in LED emergency vehicle warning lights (as well as [[traffic light]]s) being obscured by the buildup of frost or snow, raising safety concerns.  Solutions are being researched to provide a heat source, as necessary in certain weather conditions, to keep LED lights clear of snow and frost.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.findlaw.com/injured/2009/12/accidents-traffic-led-light-cant-melt-snow-3.html|title=Accidents: Traffic LED Light Can\u2019t Melt Snow|accessdate=2010-05-02|publisher=Findlaw }}</ref>\n\n===Modification of stock lighting===\n[[File:Hide-away lamp in headlight.jpg|A hide-away strobe light fitted into a [[headlamp]].  The strobe light is the coiled glass tube in the bottom of the headlight assembly, near the center of the highlighted region of the picture (click picture to enlarge).|thumb|right]]The vehicle's stock lighting may also be modified to add flashing and strobe effects.  This can be done by adding electronics to the existing lighting system (for instance, to create a [[Wig-wag (automobile)|wig-wag]]), or by drilling holes in the reflectors of stock lighting and inserting flashing lights in those holes.\n\n===Information matrix signs===\n[[File:Tuning World Bodensee 2018, Friedrichshafen (OW1A0053).jpg|thumb|left|LED Information matrix sign (black surface) on a police car between the beacon and search lights.]]\nSome emergency vehicles use signs made up of a large number of light sources (usually LEDs), which can be programmed to display messages to other road users.  This can be used to request other vehicles to pull over, indicate a special instruction, or just to display the name of the operating service (e.g. \u2018Police\u2019).\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Mounting types==\n[[File:Beacon positions.svg|thumb|right|Diagram showing potential mounting positions for internal, body mounted and removable beacons on emergency vehicles]]\nEmergency lighting may be fitted to several places on a vehicle, depending on the degree of conspicuity required.  Beacons and lightbars are often mounted on the roof for high visibility, while other lights may be mounted on the body, in the grill, or in the interior of the vehicle.\n{{clear right}}\n\n===<div id=\"beacon_anchor\">Roof-mounted single beacon</div>===\n[[File:Dodge Charger Michigan State Police car 2.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Michigan State Police]] cruiser with a single red beacon and hood fin]]\n\nSince their introduction in 1948, rotating beacons have become widely accepted as a means of attracting attention to one's vehicle.  Although the use of the single beacon in law enforcement has dropped since the introduction of light bars, they are still used by some police departments, because of their lower cost or due to tradition. One agency that continues to employ traditional red rotating beacons on its patrol cars is the [[Michigan State Police]].  Beacons are also occasionally used on construction equipment when a full-sized lightbar would be unnecessary or impractical to attach to the vehicle.\n\nWhile many single beacons use rotating lamps or mirrors, others use strobe lights under a translucent dome to provide an omnidirectional flash.  Some smaller and low-cost beacons of the latter type, however, are simply a blinking incandescent bulb.  LEDs are also used to light some omnidirectional beacons.\n\nThe single beacon is also available with a magnetic mount for situations where permanent mounting is impractical.  Examples of such situations would be [[detective]]s in unmarked vehicles, [[volunteer firefighter]]s, or managers at [[freight]] yards who use an amber light for safety. These \u2018mag-mount\u2019 beacons are often round or teardrop-shaped, and are often referred to as \u2018[[Kojak]]\u2019 lights after the popular 1970s TV detective who used one.\n\n===Lightbar===\n[[File:Code 3 MX 7000 Lightbar.jpg|thumb|left|Code 3 MX7000Lightbar used by the [[New South Wales Police Force]].  Also seen is an LED message board, which can display static or scrolling text.]]\n[[File:Lightbar close-up to see mechanism.jpg|thumb|right|Close up of an older light bar: this light bar has a clear dome under which two rotating lights can be seen in this view. The rotating light on the right is fitted with an additional red lens, while the left light will give off unfiltered white light.  At the extreme left, a [[Siren (noisemaker)|siren]] [[loudspeaker|speaker]] can be installed behind the grill.]]\n\nOriginally, this referred to a simple metal bar on the roof of the vehicle upon which agencies would mount two rotating beacons, as well as other components such as [[siren (noisemaker)#Vehicle-mounted|sirens]] and stationary \u2018lollipop\u2019 lights.  Soon the beacon manufacturers began producing off-the-shelf complete \u2018lightbars\u2019.\n\nLater, the individual components of the lightbar were integrated into a single contiguous unit, with two elongated  domes on either side of a siren enclosure.  The extended domes allowed for more rotating beacons, additional mirrors, and fixed-beam lights toward the center to replace the \u2018lollipops\u2019.\n\nLightbars may now contain fixed, rotating, strobe, or LED-based lights in various configurations and offering programmable flash patterns.  They may include a second, lower, tier of lamps, such as clear halogen \u2018takedown\u2019 lights towards the front to illuminate the vehicle being stopped, clear side-facing \u2018alley\u2019 spotlights, additional amber or red towards the rear for scene protection, or directional traffic advisory arrows.  The modern trend of locating sirens on or near the front bumper of emergency vehicles has resulted in many lightbar models eliminating the siren housing in lieu of more lighting.\n\nSome lightbar variations are specialized to meet certain desires of the agencies utilizing them, such as those using multiple rotating beacons in a \u2018V\u2019 pattern to provide additional illumination to the sides of the vehicle, and those designed to hug the roof of a vehicle to minimize air resistance or present a lower profile for \u2018stealth\u2019 purposes.\n\n===Body mounted===\n[[File:Ambulance side beacon.png|thumb|left|upright|Body mounted beacon in operation, used to draw attention to the vehicle as it emerges from side roads]]\nSome types of light can be mounted on to the outside of the vehicle (usually a permanent install) and these can be used to provide directional lighting in key areas, such as in front for clearing traffic, or to the rear for scene protection.  They can also form part of the main lighting arrangement for subtly marked or unmarked vehicles.  In this application, the operating service may choose to use lights with clear lenses so as to minimize the possibility of the lights being noticed when not on.\n\nCommon places to mount such beacons include on or in the grill of the vehicle and on the front of the rear view mirrors, where they can gain maximum visibility.  In the UK many emergency vehicles have lights on the side of the bonnet, which helps to warn oncoming traffic when pulling out of junctions.  These lights are often strobe or LED types, as they have the lowest profile for purposes of attachment.\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Vehicle integral===\nSometimes, the existing lighting on a vehicle is modified to create warning beacons.  In the case of [[wig-wag (automobile)|wig-wag]] lighting, this involves adding a device to alternately flash the high-beam headlights, or, in some countries, the rear fog lights.  It can also involve drilling out other lights on the vehicle to add \u2018hideaway\u2019 or \u2018corner strobes\u2019.\n\n[[File:HR 201 Commodore SS - Flickr - Highway Patrol Images (1).jpg|thumb|right|A [[New South Wales Police Force]] unmarked vehicle. The interior mounted lights can be seen on the dashboard]]\n\n===Interior mounted===\nA variety of emergency lights may be used in the interior of a vehicle, generally on the dashboard, visor area, or rear deck.  Uses range from discreet or temporary lighting for unmarked vehicles and volunteer responders, to additional rear lighting on fully marked vehicles, to a \u2018slick-top\u2019 configuration not unlike a full lightbar set.\n\nInterior lighting is available in a variety of form factors, ranging from flat LED panels under the sun visors, to halogen or strobe lights mounted on the rear deck, to \u2018cherry\u2019 or oscillating \u2018teardrop\u2019 lights mounted on the dash. These may be permanently mounted and wired into the vehicle's electrical system, or they may be temporarily mounted and plug into the vehicle's cigarette lighter.  They are often fitted with shields which direct the light through the window, but prevent reflections in to the cab.\n\n[[File:Dobbs Ferry PD cars 908 and 905, autumn 2006.jpg|thumb|right|The police car on the right is a slick-top or \u2018stealth\u2019 vehicle, lacking the roof-mounted lightbar seen on the traditionally equipped car on the left.]]\n\nThe aerodynamic properties of light bars can be important for police applications, as fuel efficiency and drag are concerns in patrol and pursuit.  Because of this, some police cars do not have roof mounted lightbars. These \u2018slick-top\u2019 cars mount their emergency lights within the cruiser, generally around the periphery of the windshield or into the leading or trailing edge of the roof.  Slick-top police cars also lack the silhouette of a lightbar or beacon, making the car harder to identify as a police vehicle from a distance, especially fore and aft.  Because of these visual advantages, these vehicles are sometimes referred to as \u2018stealth\u2019 vehicles.\n\nA key disadvantage of relying solely on internal lighting is the number of lights required to achieve true 360 degree visibility, with most lights usually concentrated front and rear.  This can limit the application of vehicles for instances such as scene protection.\n\n==Scientific research==\n\n===Perception===\nA study at [[Loughborough University]] in the United Kingdom showed that strobe lighting conveyed a greater sense of urgency to other road users, with the faster the flash the greater urgency, potentially helping to speed the emergency vehicle through traffic.  It also concluded that factors such as flash pattern were important, with simultaneously flashing beacons attracting attention far quicker than alternately flashing versions, although this did increase discomfort glare.  In general, as light intensity and the number of beacons present increased, the time it took to gain the attention of other drivers decreased.\n\nThis same study compared different light colors for glare and detection time under both daylight and night conditions.  While red and blue both compared favorably with amber for glare under various conditions, some contradictory findings were observed for detection time.  When all colors were held at equal intensity, amber had the poorest detection time both daytime and night.  However, when the light source was held at constant intensity, the amber filters, which generally let the most light through, had the best detection time.<ref name=\"ICE\">{{cite conference| first = Sharon| last = Cook|author2=Claire Quigley |author3=Laurence Clift| title = Motor vehicle and pedal cycle conspicuity: part 1- vehicle mounted warning beacons.

These potential hazards include:\n* [[Photosensitive epilepsy]] - This is an epileptic reaction to flashing lights in susceptible persons, which can range in severity from an unusual feeling or involuntary twitch to a generalized seizure.  This epileptogenic response can be triggered by lights flashing in the frequency range of 10\u201320&nbsp;Hz, regardless of color.  While individual light sources used on emergency vehicles generally have much lower flash rates than this,<ref>{{cite book| last =Harding| first =Graham F.A.|author2=Peter M.

It also notes that emergency workers may report distraction and eyestrain unrelated to epilepsy from working under the lights.<ref>Cook (2000:\u00a75.3.1)</ref>\n* [[Glare (vision)|Glare]] - A bright light source in a person's field of view can reduce their ability to see other objects.  The effect may be exacerbated by rain, windshields, or eyeglasses.  The study distinguished between \u2018disability glare\u2019, where a driver may be temporarily blinded and unable to see hazards in the road, versus \u2018discomfort glare\u2019, which is a more general effect from lights which may cause motorists to avert their eyes.  The worst effects for disability glare occurred with amber beacons, strobe beacons, and especially bright lights.<ref name=ICE/>\n* [[Phototaxis]] - This is the so-called \u2018moth-to-flame\u2019 effect, where the hypothesis runs that some drivers may be so distracted by the beacons that they are \u2018drawn\u2019 to them.  The Loughborough study, referencing the February 1998 issue of the U.S. trade journal ''Tow Times,'' asserts that there was a lawsuit in the U.S. where a tow operator was found liable for an accident for this reason, though the study authors were unable to locate any supporting scientific research.<ref>{{cite conference| first = Sharon| last = Cook|author2=Claire Quigley |author3=Laurence Clift| title = Motor vehicle and pedal cycle conspicuity - part 3: vehicle mounted warning beacons.

However, it is a darker specification blue than used in other parts of the world.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nRed lights are not common in Europe, though they are used in some countries where red has a specific meaning.  Police in Finland, Estonia, Germany and Sweden use a forward-facing red light to indicate that a driver must pull over and stop. In the U.K., police cars are outfitted with flashing red lights to the rear which are toggled on/off separately from blue lights to indicate caution. Fire Command units are also equipped with them when being used for command duties. As are certain bye-law enforcement and a small selection of private security companies.[[Austria]], [[Germany]] and [[Sweden]] also use red on fire vehicles to designate the command post; in other countries a single green beacon sometimes designates the command post. In Sweden, a green strobe will indicate a medical command vehicle.  Greece uses red on fire engines, and red along with blue on police vehicles. In Hungary, red is used only along with blue (on right in lightbars and roof integration) by police (including military police and diplomatic escort) and ambulance.  In Poland, red is used on designated vehicles, including police and military vehicles, to indicate the beginning and/or end of a convoy (of those type of vehicles).  Until recently the National Police in Slovakia used only blue lights, they have recently started using red and blue lights; Municipal and Military Police used blue lights in Slovakia. In Russia and Belarus, traffic police use red and blue lights, while conventional police along with the rest of the emergency services use only blue lights.\n\n===Argentina===\nArgentina uses blue for police, red for fire, green for ambulances, and amber for utility vehicles.\n\n===Australia===\n[[File:2017 Holden Commodore (VF II MY17) SV6 sedan, Western Australia Police (2018-09-28).jpg|right|thumb|A marked highway patrol car of the [[Western Australia Police]] with red and blue lights]]\n[[File:Roads and Traffic Authority Inspectors.jpg|thumb|A marked [[Roads and Traffic Authority]] vehicle with magenta lights]]\nIn Australia, colors are generally regulated at the state level, but there are some commonalities:\n[[File:RACQ Roadside Assistance 01.jpg|thumb|right|RACQ Roadside Assistance tow truck with amber lights]]\n\n==== Red and blue ====\nThis is used by all State and Federal Police forces, Naval Police, Military Police, Air Force Police and Australian Border Force motor vehicles.

However, rather unusually, it is not specified what types of lights and sirens can be used.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mintransporte.gov.co/descargar.php?idFile=2619|title=Concepto_0206.pdf}}</ref> Since emergency vehicles are usually imported from other parts of the world, one can see a great variety of light colors and siren types in Colombia. Since most law enforcement duties are consolidated in the [[National Police of Colombia|National Police]], there is some uniformity in police vehicles. Until the early 1990s, these police vehicles were equipped with yellow lights, although today they are equipped with a single red and blue LED lightbar on the roof, and sometimes supplementary red, white, and blue grille lights. Other, more minor law enforcement vehicles (Military Police, CTI, UNP) generally follow the same scheme.\n\nFire trucks are generally imported from the US, and therefore primarily use red lights although European-style fire trucks with blue lights can sometimes be seen and, more rarely, yellow lights as in Spain.\n\nLike the US, ambulance service in Colombia is often contracted out to private companies, and some hospitals operate their own ambulance services. These different services outfit their vehicles differently, so there is little uniformity. Also, many ambulances are imported from other countries and retain the lighting schemes of their country of origin. Most ambulances use red or red and white light combinations. However, ambulances operated by the National Police and the Army are equipped with red and blue lights. Some ambulances can be seen with green lights, meaning they were imported from Argentina where ambulances always use green lights. Others still can be seen with yellow lights, like in Spain.\n\nAs in most of the world, utility vehicles usually use flashing yellow/amber lights.\n\nAlthough only emergency and utility vehicles are allowed to display flashing colored lights, this law is usually not enforced and it is common to see private vehicles customized with colored lights. Taxis commonly display flashing blue lights as decoration, although some taxi drivers install sirens onto their vehicles in order to get around traffic. Many ''busetas'' (the traditional, unregulated bus systems in many urban areas) and [[Chiva bus|chivas]] (rural, informal, public buses) also display colorful flashing lights.\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\nSpecial audible warning device (siren) supplemented with special warning in blue color can be fitted to vehicles. Specifically vehicles classified for primary emergency services (state police, professional fire brigades, emergency ambulances) can use from 2019 combination of blue and red lights. Red lights must be installed only on the left side of vehicle, whereas ratio of blue and red ligths on vehicle must be 1:1. \nWhite flashing light can be used as minor suplementary color in lightbars. \n\n* Ministry of Interior used by the [[Police of Czech Republic|police]] and identified by special legislation,\n* the [[Prison Service of the Czech Republic|Prison Service]],\n* military police designated by special legislation,\n*[[Municipal police|Municipal Police]], which determines the municipality,\n* fire departments,\n* mine rescue service,\n* emergency service gas facilities,\n* emergency medical services and transport sick, wounded and pregnant women,\n* used by the Armed Forces military rescue units for carrying out humanitarian tasks of civil protection.\n* the customs administration marked by a special regulation.\n\nAmber lights are used for non-emergency warning on many different vehicles - e.g. road construction vehicles, heavy transports, tow trucks, municipal services (dustcarts, road hoovers), ...\n\nOther colors for flashing lights or beacons are not allowed.\n\n=== France ===\n[[File:Ford police nationale Strasbourg - juin 2014.jpg|thumb|right|[[Police Nationale]] police car with blue lights]]\n\n==== Blue ====\nWhen responding, emergency vehicles (including Police cars) are required to have, at least, one -360 degrees visible- blue light on the roof.\nFrench law strictly states what kind of blue lights and sirens an emergency vehicle can display, with 2 different categories.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=D9C2503AA65A0F350BC24F064A54BAEA.tpdjo04v_3?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006057859&dateTexte=20110221 |title=Arr\u00eat\u00e9 du 30 octobre 1987 relatif aux dispositifs sp\u00e9ciaux de signalisation des v\u00e9hicules d'intervention urgente |publisher=Legifrance |date=2004-12-23 |accessdate=2018-06-27}}</ref>\n\n* The first category includes Fire, local and national Police, [[Gendarmerie]], Customs, Penitentiary service, public EMS (SAMU), private ambulances under SAMU contract and government civil defence. These vehicles must use two-tones sirens and beacons with a rotating effect, and/or lightbars with flashing or rotating effects. They can also use two additional blue, flashing, front-facing lights.\n* The second category includes other private ambulances, blood/organ transport, railroad security, snow plows, highway maintenance/safety and electricity/gas units which respond to incidents and Banque de France transport trucks. These vehicles must only use three-tones sirens (except snow plows) and beacons with a flashing effect, and/or lightbars with flashing effects.\n\n==== Amber ====\nFor any emergency vehicle, amber lights can be used with or without blue, to warn other drivers the emergency vehicle is stopped or slow. Non-emergency vehicles allowed to use amber include agricultural, construction, utility, oversized, tow and airport vehicles.\n\n==== Green or red ====\nThese are not considered emergency lights, but are often used on the roof of command vehicles at the scene of incidents.\n\n=== Germany ===\n[[File:Rtwnef Ambulance Rettungsdienst Germany.jpg|thumb|right|German emergency vehicles (all blue beacons).]]\nOnly emergency and police vehicle may use blue lights. This includes firefighters, rescue services, emergency response vehicles for public utilities and civil defense units. All other kinds of blue lights (e.g. car floor lighting or cab interior lights), including reflective stickers or paintings, are illegal on public roads.<ref>\u00a752 Abs 3 Stra\u00dfenverkehrszulassungsordnung</ref> Flashing blue lights and sirens may only be used by authorized vehicles in case of emergency and order all other vehicles to make way, since these vehicles have the absolute right of way. Blue lights alone may be used to secure the site of an accident (or a standing emergency vehicle). Sometimes, columns of emergency or police vehicles use blue lights (without sirens) to make the column more visible to other vehicles.<ref>\u00a738 Stra\u00dfenverkehrsordnung</ref>\n\nBlue and yellow are the only colours of flashing lights legal for use on moving vehicles. Other colours, such as red or green are sometimes used to show vehicles of special functions, such as incident command, when stationary.\n\nGerman police lightbars often have \u2018''POLIZEI''\u2019 written in white over the dome, and usually incorporate an [[LED]] text display that can read, in mirrored writing if towards the front, \u2018''HALT'' ''POLIZEI''\u2019 or \u2018''BITTE FOLGEN''\u2019 (\u2018please follow\u2019), to signal drivers to pull over. In the newest generation, the text display changes between German and English (''HALT POLIZEI'' \u2192 STOP POLICE and ''BITTE FOLGEN'' \u2192 FOLLOW ME).\n\n=== Greece ===\n[[Hellenic Police|Police]] used to have blue-colored emergency lights but after a recent restock of vehicles, now the use of both blue and red color is usual. Fire Departments make use of red only emergency light while ambulances either use red or both colors. Regulation also states that the [[Military of Greece|Military]] as well as vehicles carrying politicians can make use of a single rotating blue light at the roof. Every other individual and/or company may use yellow lights for either warning or emergency. Special groups like Emergency Response teams and agents may also include emergency lights on their private vehicles in case of an emergency when not in active duty. All utility vehicles such as construction related, tow trucks must be equipped with a yellow-colored emergency light bar on the top, clearly visible from the front and rear side. The same applies for private security firm vehicles, that are in generally treated like typical private cars.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n===Hong Kong===\nUnder [[Hong Kong Law]], Chapter 374G of the [[Road Traffic (Traffic Control) Regulations]]: Section 46 ''Giving way to animals, police vehicles, ambulances, etc.,'' drivers must yield to vehicles which are sounding siren and/or flashing light bars.\n\n*'''Red and blue''': [[Hong Kong Police Force]]\n*'''Red only''': [[Fire Services Department]] fire engines\n*'''Blue only''': Ambulances, whether operated by Fire Services Department, [[Auxiliary Medical Services]], or [[Hong Kong St. John Ambulance]]; [[Customs and Excise Department (Hong Kong)|Customs and Excise Department]], [[Hong Kong Correctional Services]]\n*'''Amber only''': Utility vehicles, [[Civil Aid Service]], all vehicles in the air-side of the [[Hong Kong International Airport|airport]] (for pilots' visibility), [[Hong Kong Immigration Department]] vehicles\n\n=== Hungary ===\n\n==== Blue lights only ====\nThese are used by police, ambulance service, emergency blood transport, fire brigade, emergency response teams (public services), correction facilities.\n\n==== Blue and red ====\nUsed on most police and ambulance, and on some types of fire vehicles, but red is to be used only in combo with blue. Ambulances usually have large integrated roof corner flash lights, 3 blue ones and 1 red at front right position, and 3-5 or more smaller red/blue flash lights on mirrors, hood, grill, side and back, mounted and used in a zig-zag pattern. Separately-mounted external lightbars on ambulances are rare, used just on doctor's cars and older vans. Police cruisers usually have a lightbar similar to that of German units (Hella 3) with red and blue lights (red on right, like on ambulances), a blue flash behind the windscreen, and additional blue flash lights in the grill. Since Dec 2017, new police lightbars feature integrated LED matrix to display messages to front (mirrored) and rear, alternatively changing text in Hungarian and English. Some police units often use additional lighting, e.g. strobe lights, alternating headlight flash, behind-windshield blue/red lights. Detachable blue flash lamps are occasionally used by unmarked cars of special police forces, by personal transport services for government members, and diplomatic convoy/escort vehicles.\n\n==== Amber ====\nAmber or yellow flashing lights and lightbars are for warning some special attribute (e.g. oversized, slow, parking at unexpected places etc.) of vehicles like garbage trucks, road cleaning/control/repair, snow plow, car assistance services, construction, transporting dangerous materials etc. Amber/yellow lights do not grant traffic privileges, except to go in the opposite direction in one-way streets or driving on the opposite side in some cases, e.g. road cleaning.\n\n*\n\n===Indonesia===\n\nUnder the Indonesian Legislation number 22 year of 2009 section 59 the colors and users of lightbars are:\n\n*'''Blue:''' [[Indonesian National Police]] and escort units\n*'''Red:''' Ambulance, fire brigade, and Search & Rescue units\n*'''Amber:''' Tow Trucks, and Road engineer vehicles\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Ireland===\n[[File:Dfbyellowamb.JPG|thumb|An [[Dublin Fire Brigade]] ambulance responding with flashing blue lights.]]\n\n==== Blue lights ====\n\nUsage of emergency vehicle lighting is restricted in Ireland through the Road Traffic Lighting of Vehicles (Blue and Amber Lamps) Regulations 2011<ref>{{citation|title=Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) (Blue and Amber Lamps) Regulations 2011|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2011/si/695/made/en/|publisher= Government of Ireland|year=2011|accessdate=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n\nThe main colour for [[emergency service]] vehicles is overwhelmingly blue, although there is also widespread use of flashing (white) headlights, and many police vehicles have a set of two rear-facing red flashing lights to indicate that the police car is stopped or to indicate caution. \n\nThe use of blue lights not exceeding 50w are limited to vehicles being used-\n* By a member of the [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na]] in the performance of his or her duties as such member.\n* As a [[fire brigade]] vehicle.This Includes a vehicle used by senior fire officers in the performance of their duty as such officer.<ref>{{cite web|title=FAQs on Flashing Lights on Vehicles |url=https://www.rsa.ie/Documents/VS_Information_Notes/Vehicle_Parts/FAQs%20on%20Emergency%20Flashing%20Lights%20on%20Vehicles.pdf</ref>\n*[[File:An garda siochana ford ranger crowd control.jpg|thumb|Blue lights in use on a Garda Roads Policing vehicle]]By persons providing an [[ambulance]] service.\n*By the [[Irish Prison Service]].\n*As an [[Irish Coast Guard|Irish Marine Emergency Service vehicle]], with or without a trailer.\n*For the delivery or collection of human transplant organs human blood or human blood products.\n*Marked [[Military Police Corps (Ireland)|Military Police]] vehicles.\n\n[[File:Dublin Fire Brigade Foam and Environmental Unit in National Services Day.jpg|thumb|Dublin Fire Brigade Foam and Environmental Unit with blue flashing led lights.]]\n\nAlthough not specifically linked to the use of warning beacons, the police, fire brigade and ambulance services (but not the other emergency services listed above) may also choose to allow their drivers to claim legal exemptions from most motoring regulations, such as being able to treat a red [[traffic light]] as a [[give way sign]], exceeding the speed limit, passing the wrong side of a keep left/right sign, or parking in restricted areas.<ref>{{citation|title=ROAD TRAFFIC ACT 2010 |chapter=Part 5 Section 87|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2010/act/25/section/87/enacted/en/|publisher=[[Government of Ireland]]}} (NB: police, fire brigade, ambulance)</ref> \n\nNo qualification other than a [[driving licence]] is legally required to use blue lights.

Only designated emergency/priority vehicles may use blue lights; this includes police, fire brigade, ambulance service and a few other, smaller services such as the [[blood bank]] and some [[lifeguard]] organizations. [[Netherlands|Dutch]] police vehicles have an LED matrix display, which can show different texts in red lighting. Most often used are ''STOP POLITIE'' (ordering a driver to pull over and stop) or ''VOLGEN POLITIE'' (ordering driver to follow the police vehicle). Standard Dutch police cars often have the text bar incorporated in the light bar, vans and motorcycles usually have a separate sign on the front of the vehicle. On ambulances, a green beacon indicates the command vehicle when multiple units are responding to an incident - usually this is the first vehicle that arrives on the scene. Newer ambulance models also have a text display that will alternate the words \u2018Ambulance\u2019 and \u2018''Spoed''\u2019 (\u2018urgent\u2019).

Blue flashing lights are used by police, military police, customs, fire departments, rescue services, and ambulances. Government, VIP, and embassy vehicles may also use blue if accompanied by local police. Any vehicle equipped with a blue flashing light must have a permission issued by the DMV. The operator of such vehicle must be a qualified emergency vehicle operator and have a \u2018code 160\u2019 endorsement on their [[driver's license]]. Blue lights can be used alone or with an additional siren. The siren may not be used alone. The operator of an emergency vehicle may disregard speed limits and [[traffic light]]s with caution. Amber lights, however, are not regulated, but are used for any vehicle that need special attention, such as tow-trucks, snow plows, and parking enforcement. Red flashing lights are no longer in use, and were last used in the early 1960s.\n\n=== Poland ===\nOnly designated vehicles (such as Police, Fire Service, Ambulances, Internal Affairs, etc.) are permitted to use blue light. The sale of a blue emergency light is permitted, however, the possession of such a light in vehicles (whether turned on or off, visible or not) is strictly illegal. Red lights are used by the first and last vehicle of a convoy of designated vehicles and also are strictly regulated. Amber lights are seeing increasing popularity in recent years, however, specific uses are designated according to the Polish \u2018''Kodeks Drogowy''\u2019. There are no specific rules governing the use of other colors such as purple, green, or clear lights.\n\n=== Romania ===\nThe three emergency lights used in [[Romania]] are red, blue and amber. At a red flashing light, bringing the vehicle to a full stop is compulsory, while for a blue light yielding, slowing down and moving out of the way is compulsory, and an amber light means other traffic vehicles must proceed with caution due to an oversized or slow vehicle.\n\nThe cars that are allowed to use red lights are the [[Romanian Police]] and the [[Romanian General Inspectorate for Emergency Situations|Roman General Inspectorate for Emergency Situations]].\n\nCars that are allowed to use a blue rotating light are the [[Romanian Police]] (including [[Municipal police (Romania)|Local Police]]), [[Romanian Gendarmerie]], [[Romanian Border Police]], emergency medical services (including [[SMURD]]), [[Romanian General Inspectorate for Emergency Situations|Civil Protection]], [[Ministry of National Defense (Romania)|Ministry of National Defense]], [[Romanian Intelligence Service|Special Units of the Romanian Intelligence Service]], [[Protection and Guard Service]], [[Ministry of Justice (Romania)|Ministry of Justice - General Directorate of Prisons]], Public Ministry when in mission, [[National Anticorruption Directorate]] when in mission, and [[Financial Guard (Romania)|Financial Guard vehicles]].\n\nThe amber rotating light mean the vehicle and some accompanying vehicles are oversized, overweight, transporting dangerous goods, work as road/street maintenance, are tow trucks, are tractors, or are [[agricultural vehicle]]s.\n\n=== Russia ===\n* '''Red and blue''': Traffic police (DPS Dorozhno Patrulnaya Sluzhba Road Patrol Service); FSO (Federalnaya Sluzhba Ohrany Federal Protective Service); FSB (Federalnaya Sluzhba Besopasnosti Federal Security Service)\n* '''Blue''': Police, ambulance, fire brigade, EMERCOM vehicles, gas emergency service, Central Bank of Russia vehicles.\n* '''Amber''': Construction and utility vehicles, airport service vehicles (excluding emergency vehicles), snow removal.\n* '''White''': Russian post, armored cash transport cars.\n\n=== Serbia ===\n\n* '''Blue''': Police, ambulance service, fire brigade, military police, military ambulance, traffic police.\n* '''Blue and red''': First vehicle of a police vehicles convoy ore military police convoy.\n* '''Amber''': Municipality police, utility and construction vehicles, heavy machines, tractors, slow vehicles.\n\n=== Slovenia ===\n\n* '''Blue''': Police, ambulance service, fire brigade, military police, military ambulance, traffic police.\n* '''Blue and Red''': First vehicle of a police vehicles convoy.\n* '''White''': Additional lightbar color, [[wig-wag (automobile)|wig-wag]] on emergency vehicles, accident scene lighting (fire and ambulance)\n* '''Amber''': Municipality police, utility and construction vehicles, heavy machines, slow vehicles.\n\n===South Korea===\n* '''Red''': Fire department, Gyeongi province ambulances, some police vehicles\n* '''Blue''': Police motorcycles, some police vehicles, volunteer firefighters\n* '''Red and blue''': Police patrol cars\n* '''Green''': Ambulances (some privately operated ambulances use green and red lights)\n* '''Yellow/amber''': Utility vehicles, Security Company\n\n=== Spain ===\nThe law used to allow only the [[Cuerpo Nacional de Polic\u00eda]], [[Guardia Civil]], Polic\u00eda Local and autonomous law-enforcement agencies to use blue lights, so in contrast with convention in Europe, civil defense, ambulances (Ambulancia) and fire engines (Bomberos) had to use yellow/amber lights (the only other color authorized, in contrast to convention in which these color lights are used to denote slow vehicles). Some [[Autonomous Communities]] allowed other colors, such as blue, red or white (the latter two of which is used by [[SAMUR]] in Madrid), however, these are technically illegal to use throughout Spain. In 2018 a new law finally allowed these kind of emergency vehicles to use blue lights, giving them 2 years to make the switch from yellow/amber to blue. Yellow/amber lights are now only used in wide-load trucks and their accompanying vehicles among other special vehicles, such as tractors or tow trucks. A steady burn green light is permitted on taxis available for hire, and was formerly used on buses to indicate a bus was in service and with places free for passengers.\n\n=== Sweden ===\n\n==== Blue ====\nPolice vehicles, medical vehicles and fire engines along with other government vehicles such as the [[Military police#Sweden|Swedish Military Police]] and the [[Swedish Customs Service]] use white and dark [[Flag of Europe#Colours|\u2018Euro blue\u2019]] emergency lights. Ordinary traffic are required to make way for these vehicles if the lights are on.\n\nBlue lights & sirens may also be used on vehicles of that belong to private companies or organizations if their role is either life saving or protecting some vital system of society. This includes but not limited to; Medical & public transport, gas & electricity companies and security (specifically, Security Officers in charge of protecting government buildings & ports).\n\n==== Amber ====\nAmber lights grant no priority in traffic and exist purely to advertise the vehicle's presence, usually as a warning. Most commonly used on heavy machinery, trucks, bulldozers, slow-going and construction vehicles like are equipped with yellow/amber lights. It is legal to fitt these lights to other vehicles, such as privately owned cars.\n\n==== Red ====\nThe [[Swedish police]] use a forward-facing red light to indicate that a driver must pull over and stop.

Some lightbars include separate or integrated steady burn white lights that face forward (\"takedown lights\") or to the sides (\"alley lights\") to allow for better visibility of objects around the vehicle at night.\n* White is rarely used as the only color on a lightbar, though some states{{efn|Alabama, Arkansas, Rhode Island, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Maryland, West Virginia, South Dakota, Texas, Louisiana, and Kentucky require flashing white lights on school buses}} require flashing white beacons on the rear of school buses as a rear-end collision prevention measure.\n* Historically, white was used in combination with red bulb lenses in the Federal Signal Corporation Beacon Ray rotating beacon, introduced in 1948 and the later 1960s and 1970s model P A lights equipped with clear domes on through the 1980s, when revolving bulb and reflector type emergency lighting including the later 1970s Twinsonic and Aerodynic lightbars were supplanted with newer strobe types. The four bulb Beacon Ray Model 175 with a clear dome and colored lenses over the bulbs were used extensively in the 1960s by the NYPD with two red bulbs alternated with a white bulb and an amber bulb canted upwards at a 45-degree angle so the amber flash would reflect off upper-floor building windows for added traffic attention/visibility. This clear dome/colored bulb lens combination also found extensive use across the US as fire apparatus and ambulance lighting.\n* Certain railroad-related machines, like fueling tankers, track maintenance and switching engines, may also use a flashing white light. \n* In some states, certain government vehicles such as rural mail delivery vehicles use a flashing white beacon .\n\n==== Green ====\n[[File:'09-'12 Ford Escape Mall At Millenia.jpg|thumb|A security vehicle using green lights in a mall in [[Florida]]]]\n\n*Since [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] green is used by Homeland Security Agencies and government/private security agencies protecting high risk government and critical infrastructure.\n*Green emergency lighting is used on vehicles which are protecting nuclear facilities, oil & gas depots, water storage facilities and dams, gas pipelines, airports, defense facilities, maritime facilities, and all other areas which are at a high risk of terrorist attacks.\n*Green emergency lighting is also used by private security agencies securing certain government buildings and establishments where terrorist organizations may also target. However, in the State of Florida, green is allowed for use by all private security vehicles only in combination with amber lights.

Vehicles operated by fire departments, such as [[fire engines]] and [[heavy rescue vehicle]]s, prominently use red, a color with strong cultural associations with the fire service, along with some amber and white. Some more modern fire trucks and airport crash units use a yellow-green color, however.\n\nMany fire chiefs\u2019 cars have, in addition to the red lights, a single green beacon to indicate command post status.  On the other hand, in Chicago and some nearby communities, fire vehicles show a green light on the right, or starboard, side of the vehicle, reflecting nautical tradition.<ref>{{cite journal| title = Why does the Chicago Fire Department outfit their trucks and stations with green lights?| journal = Hot Times newsletter| publisher = Federal Signal Corporation| location = University Park, IL| date = June 2007| url = http://www.fedsig.com/industry_solutions/fire_ems/hotTimes_news/archives/electronic/2007/6/?show=main| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071109064043/http://www.fedsig.com/industry_solutions/fire_ems/hotTimes_news/archives/electronic/2007/6/?show=main| archivedate = 2007-11-09}}</ref>\n\nEmergency medical vehicles, such as [[ambulance]]s and paramedic [[fly-car]]s, generally use white, amber, and red as well.

The degree of lighting is mandated by law and also by local custom in most areas, and can vary from a single rotating light on the dashboard or roof, to a setup much like modern police cruisers. Some states also allow volunteer use of sirens and air horns to request the right of way.\n\nVirginia state law allows emergency personnel to equip one private vehicle \u201cwith no more than two flashing or steady-burning red or red and white combination warning lights\u201d.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uclue.com/?xq=777 |title=Virginia Personal Emergency Vehicle Lights |publisher=Uclue.com |accessdate=2010-10-09}}</ref>\n\nIn some states, volunteers are allowed to use the normal red lights, while in other states volunteers must use some other color, usually blue or green.  In the latter case, the lights are used as a courtesy to \u2018request\u2019 the right of way and generally do not mandate pulling over.  Some states, such as  Pennsylvania, limit volunteer use of red lights to chiefs and captains of squads.\n\nSeparate colors may be used for fire versus EMS volunteers.  In Connecticut, Indiana, and New York, volunteer firefighters use blue while volunteer EMTs use green. In New Jersey, volunteer fire and ambulance personnel use blue lights in their personal vehicles while responding to their stations. In NJ red lights are only allowed for emergency vehicles, fire chiefs, chief officers of first aid or rescue squads, or other law enforcement vehicles. In Iowa, volunteer firefighters can use flashing blue lights on their personal vehicles, while volunteer EMTs can use flashing white (clear) lights.\n\nNew York also certifies some volunteer EMTs to use red lights and sirens provided their vehicles carry certain equipment;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.health.state.ny.us/nysdoh/ems/policy/01-01.htm |title=NYS Department of Health: Authorizing Private Vehicles as EASV\u2019s (Use of Red Lights & Sirens) |publisher=Health.state.ny.us |accessdate=2010-10-09}}</ref> this is often used by [[Hatzolah]] volunteers in the NYC area. Typically in New York state, volunteer firefighters use blue lights in their personal vehicles and volunteer EMS use green lights.  This may generate confusion, as green lights are also used to signify an [[incident command]] vehicle. In the state of Texas, \u201ca private vehicle of a volunteer firefighter or a certified emergency medical services employee or volunteer when responding to a fire alarm or medical emergency\u201d is considered an \u201cauthorized emergency vehicle\u201d and may use alternately flashing lighting equipment or may be equipped with a siren, exhaust whistle, or bell.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.txdps.state.tx.us/RSD/PSB/News/blue_lights.htm |title=Texas Department of Public Safety: Red, White, or Blue Lights |accessdate=2015-01-20}}</ref>\n\nThe conflicting color assignments can create issues for volunteers who drive their vehicles out of state. One color in their state may mean firefighter or EMT when in another state it may mean police. While some authorities may be satisfied with covering the lights with an \u2018Out Of Service\u2019 tarpaulin, compliance may be more difficult in other jurisdictions.  For example, Arkansas bars civilian possession of blue lights on or in a vehicle unless sealed in the manufacturer's original package.<ref>[http://www.arkansashighways.com/Info/Act300/2007/27/27-36-301.htm Arkansas Motor Vehicle and Traffic Laws \u00a7 27-36-301: Violations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624190453/http://www.arkansashighways.com/Info/Act300/2007/27/27-36-301.htm |date=June 24, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n====Utility vehicles====\n[[File:GoldShieldSecurityCar.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Private Security Car with Amber/Yellow Lightbar on top.]]\n\nAmber lights are often used on vehicle involved in non-emergency work. Most utility companies, towing services, oversize load vehicles, slow vehicles, and certain types of construction equipment mount some type of lightbar or lighting system for a higher degree of visibility.\n\nIn [[Detroit, Michigan]], [[Devil's Night#Angels' Night|Angels' Night]] volunteers will patrol neighborhoods with yellow lights to help deter vandalism during [[Devil's Night]] and [[Halloween]]. Typically these lights are the single beacon kind, although lightbars have been used for vehicles of this type, especially on wreckers/tow trucks.\n\nIn [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], Tennessee most city maintenance vehicles (including MLG&W utility trucks) with flashing lights use yellow lights; however, some vehicles with the traffic engineering department use red flashing lights, especially vehicles equipped with cherry pickers used to repair traffic signals.\n\nIn states that do not enforce specific rules about green, yellow or white lights, these colors are often used by entities like private security companies which may be ineligible to use blue or red lights but need emergency lights for traffic and site visibility. Security vehicles generally use their lights on private property, in addition some security vehicles are off-road only such as ATV and Golf cart type vehicles. and in most jurisdictions security vehicles are generally not allowed a \u2018courtesy\u2019 or \u2018emergency\u2019 status on public roads.\n\n====Optional colors====\nWhile certain colors are customarily used by different services, often other colors are optionally used, such as amber and white. Sometimes, this is done to satisfy particular regulations; for example, California requires a steady red light facing forward and a flashing amber light to the rear on every emergency vehicle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/d12/vc25259.htm |title=CA Vehicle Code \u00a725252: Warning Lamps on Authorized Emergency Vehicles |publisher=Dmv.ca.gov |accessdate=2010-10-09}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Fire engines}}\n{{Commons category|Ambulances}}\n* [[Automotive lighting]]\n* [[Emergency vehicle equipment]]\n{{clear right}}\n\n==References==\n;Footnotes\n{{Notelist}}\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Emergency Vehicle Lighting}}\n[[Category:Automotive technologies]]\n[[Category:Emergency vehicles]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Signalling lights]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Red Lights and Sirens.jpg|thumb|right|Emergency vehicle lighting, such as that seen on this 1970s ambulance, helps to announce the vehicle's presence to other road users.]]\n[[File:Blue emergency lights.ogv|thumb|right|Rotating blue emergency lighting on a [[Sweden|Swedish]] police vehicle.]]\n[[File:Blaulicht.gif|thumb|Rotating beacon]]\n'''Emergency vehicle lighting''' is one or more visual warning lights fitted to a vehicle for use when the driver wishes to convey to other road users the urgency of their journey, to provide additional warning of a hazard when stationary, or in the case of law enforcement as a means of signalling another driver to stop for interaction with an officer.  These lights may be dedicated emergency lights, such as a beacon or a light bar, or may be modified stock lighting, such as a [[wig-wag (automobile)|wig-wag]] or hide-away light, and are additional to any standard lighting on the car such as [[hazard lights]].  Often, they are used along with a [[Siren (noisemaker)|siren]] (or occasionally sirens) in order to increase their effectiveness.  In many jurisdictions, the use of these lights may afford the user specific legal powers, and may place requirements on other road users to behave differently, such as compelling them to pull to the side of the road and yield right of way so the emergency vehicle may proceed through unimpeded.\n\nLaws regarding and restricting the use of these lights vary widely among jurisdictions, and in some areas non-emergency vehicles (e.g. school buses) and semi-emergency vehicles (e.g. tow trucks) may be permitted to use similar lights.  These non-and semi-emergency lights are also discussed here.  Research into the usefulness and potential dangers of these lights is also presented.\n\nEmergency vehicle lighting is a sub-type of [[emergency vehicle equipment]].\n\n== History ==\nThe use of the blue emergency light originates in Germany during [[World War II]]. As a result of the \u2018Verdunkelung\u2019, a black-out measure for aerial defense from 1935, cobalt blue was regulated to replace the red color used until 1938 in emergency vehicle lights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amaot.de/bunker/8dfgvo.htm|title=Bunker in Braunschweig {{!}} Luftschutzgesetz - 8.

Brunswig|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Due to the [[scattering]] properties of the blue color, it is only visible to lower altitudes and is therefore less easily spotted by enemy airplanes.\n\n==Purpose==\nEmergency vehicle lighting is generally used to clear the right of way for [[emergency vehicle]]s, or to warn approaching motorists of potential hazards, such as a vehicle that is stopped or moving slower than the rate of traffic, or a car that has been pulled over. It may also be used to provide specific directions to motorists, such as a command to pull over. Some vehicles incorporate a small arrow board to direct traffic.\n\nThe use of emergency beacons is restricted by law in many jurisdictions only for responding to an emergency, initiating a traffic stop, bona fide training exercises, or when a specific hazard exists in the road. Most private security agencies have special permits that allow them to use beacons in specific areas. It has yet to be determined whether autonomous vehicles will be required to carry lights, or what colors or patterns they might exhibit to warn off aggressive human drivers.\n\n==Optical types==\nThe optical and mechanical characteristics of the lights used can have a significant effect on the look of the vehicle and how readily it gains attention in emergencies.\n\n===Steady burning===\nThe simplest form of lighting is a steadily burning lamp.  These may be white lights used on scene to enable emergency workers to see what they are doing, or they may be colored lights that advertise the emergency vehicle's presence.  In the latter case, steadily burning lights are often used alongside rotating or flashing lights rather than on their own, though historically some emergency vehicles only displayed steadily burning lights.  For example, California Vehicle Code Section 25252 states: \u201cEvery authorized emergency vehicle shall be equipped with at least one steady burning red warning lamp visible from at least 1,000 feet to the front of the vehicle\u201d\n\n===Rotating light===\n[[File:Composite green beacon photo.jpg|thumb|right|'''The parts and workings of a rotating light''': '''Top''' The assembled beacon, including an optional mirror to be used when the beacon is placed in the windshield or rear window. '''Center''' The beacon, with the mirror removed. '''Bottom left and right''' The green dome of the beacon has been removed to show its rotating reflector, stationary incandescent lamp, and electric motor.]]\nThese revolving lights may contain a single, stationary bulb around which a curved mirror is spun (or which is attached to a spinning mirror), or a lamp with a [[Fresnel lens]].  This creates rotating beam(s) of light, appearing to flash when viewed.  Larger rotating lights may contain modular or [[sealed beam|sealed-beam]] lamps which rotate as an assembly (commonly 2 or 4 bulbs, but possibly 1 or 3).\n\nTo protect the workings of the beacon, a plastic dome often covers the assembly.  These domes usually come in solid colors, but in some cases the front and back halves of the dome are different colors.  Other beacons use a clear dome with colored lenses on each lamp; in the latter case, these rotating beacons are sometimes referred to colloquially as \u2018[[gumball machine]]s\u2019 or sometimes \u2018cherry tops\u2019 in the case of red lights.\n\nRotating lights often use a [[Halogen lamp|quartz-halogen]] or conventional [[Incandescent light bulb|incandescent]] bulb, though some rotating beacons are now made with LEDs rather than bulbs.<ref>e.g. [http://www.aps-supply.com/product_details.php?itemid=540 Preco\u2019s 7600 series] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308170909/http://www.aps-supply.com/product_details.php?itemid=540 |date=2009-03-08 }}</ref>\n\nRotating lights may be used in lightbars as well as in single beacons.  In a modern enclosed lightbar, generally \u2018V\u2019- or diamond-shaped mirrors are provided between the lamps to give the effect of multiple flashing lights.\n\n===Strobe lights===\nSome emergency lighting is based on [[strobe light]]s similar to those used in flash photography.  These [[xenon flash lamp]]s put out a very brief but very bright flash by discharging a large current through a gas which ionizes the gas.  The light produced has a somewhat bluish [[emission spectrum]], which makes red lightbars glow a fuchsia-pink color when lit.\n\nStrobe Lighting did provide intense light which could improve visibility, however the short duration of the individual flash made it necessary to design the electronics to issue multiple consecutive flashes before alternating with the other associated lens pair. This purportedly allowed time for the human eye and mind to key in and observe the source of the light.  Since the changeover to L.E.D. lighting units, which could easily allow for longer duration illumination time, they have instead chosen to mimic what is actually a shortcoming of the strobe light, and design the L.E.D. light head to illuminate with multiple short duration flashes.  It has been noted that depending on the surrounding lighting conditions and other vehicle lighting, strobe only warning lighting did not allow for the same level of perception of distance from the source that traditional light bar and incandescent flashing lights would provide, especially on dark highways and similar locations.\n\n===LED lighting===\n[[File:I-35W-collapse-police-Minneapolis-20070801.jpg|thumb|left|Police cars sit at the base of the [[I-35W Mississippi River bridge|I-35W bridge collapse]]. The lightbars mounted on the cars are LED-based.  The illuminated back-up lamps seen in the two cars in the foreground are being used as emergency lights which operate on a different circuit, rather than burning steadily to indicate that the cars are in reverse gear.]]\n\n[[File:LED-Blaulicht-VW-T5.jpg|thumb|LED-lights on a [[Volkswagen Transporter]] ambulance]]\n\nLED-based lighting is becoming very popular in the emergency services for several reasons.  [[Light-emitting diode]]s are small, completely solid state, very power-efficient, long-lasting (as they have no filaments to burn out) and can be seen very easily even at great distances and in sunlight.\n\nWhether as lightbars or single beacons, LED-based lights typically use a clear, colorless dome because the light color is an intrinsic property of the LEDs themselves.  LED-based lightbars can be made very thin, reducing [[Drag (physics)|wind resistance]] by around 8-10 percent,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz-police/news/article.cfm?o_id=131&objectid=10542312|title=Arresting image update to save police force $800,000 |last=Binning|first=Elizabeth |date=11 November 2008|publisher=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=2009-03-23}}</ref> or made very flat and used in novel applications, for example to flip up under a sun visor.\n\nLED lights are often used in a mode similar to conventional strobe lights, however they can be programmed with a wider variety of flash patterns because of their ability to be switched directly by electronics, as opposed to discharging a capacitor through a gas-filled tube.\n\nLED lights produce relatively little heat when in use. In colder inclement climates, this has resulted in LED emergency vehicle warning lights (as well as [[traffic light]]s) being obscured by the buildup of frost or snow, raising safety concerns.  Solutions are being researched to provide a heat source, as necessary in certain weather conditions, to keep LED lights clear of snow and frost.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.findlaw.com/injured/2009/12/accidents-traffic-led-light-cant-melt-snow-3.html|title=Accidents: Traffic LED Light Can\u2019t Melt Snow|accessdate=2010-05-02|publisher=Findlaw }}</ref>\n\n===Modification of stock lighting===\n[[File:Hide-away lamp in headlight.jpg|A hide-away strobe light fitted into a [[headlamp]].  The strobe light is the coiled glass tube in the bottom of the headlight assembly, near the center of the highlighted region of the picture (click picture to enlarge).|thumb|right]]The vehicle's stock lighting may also be modified to add flashing and strobe effects.  This can be done by adding electronics to the existing lighting system (for instance, to create a [[Wig-wag (automobile)|wig-wag]]), or by drilling holes in the reflectors of stock lighting and inserting flashing lights in those holes.\n\n===Information matrix signs===\n[[File:Tuning World Bodensee 2018, Friedrichshafen (OW1A0053).jpg|thumb|left|LED Information matrix sign (black surface) on a police car between the beacon and search lights.]]\nSome emergency vehicles use signs made up of a large number of light sources (usually LEDs), which can be programmed to display messages to other road users.  This can be used to request other vehicles to pull over, indicate a special instruction, or just to display the name of the operating service (e.g. \u2018Police\u2019).\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Mounting types==\n[[File:Beacon positions.svg|thumb|right|Diagram showing potential mounting positions for internal, body mounted and removable beacons on emergency vehicles]]\nEmergency lighting may be fitted to several places on a vehicle, depending on the degree of conspicuity required.  Beacons and lightbars are often mounted on the roof for high visibility, while other lights may be mounted on the body, in the grill, or in the interior of the vehicle.\n{{clear right}}\n\n===<div id=\"beacon_anchor\">Roof-mounted single beacon</div>===\n[[File:Dodge Charger Michigan State Police car 2.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Michigan State Police]] cruiser with a single red beacon and hood fin]]\n\nSince their introduction in 1948, rotating beacons have become widely accepted as a means of attracting attention to one's vehicle.  Although the use of the single beacon in law enforcement has dropped since the introduction of light bars, they are still used by some police departments, because of their lower cost or due to tradition. One agency that continues to employ traditional red rotating beacons on its patrol cars is the [[Michigan State Police]].  Beacons are also occasionally used on construction equipment when a full-sized lightbar would be unnecessary or impractical to attach to the vehicle.\n\nWhile many single beacons use rotating lamps or mirrors, others use strobe lights under a translucent dome to provide an omnidirectional flash.  Some smaller and low-cost beacons of the latter type, however, are simply a blinking incandescent bulb.  LEDs are also used to light some omnidirectional beacons.\n\nThe single beacon is also available with a magnetic mount for situations where permanent mounting is impractical.  Examples of such situations would be [[detective]]s in unmarked vehicles, [[volunteer firefighter]]s, or managers at [[freight]] yards who use an amber light for safety. These \u2018mag-mount\u2019 beacons are often round or teardrop-shaped, and are often referred to as \u2018[[Kojak]]\u2019 lights after the popular 1970s TV detective who used one.\n\n===Lightbar===\n[[File:Code 3 MX 7000 Lightbar.jpg|thumb|left|Code 3 MX7000Lightbar used by the [[New South Wales Police Force]].

At the extreme left, a [[Siren (noisemaker)|siren]] [[loudspeaker|speaker]] can be installed behind the grill.]]\n\nOriginally, this referred to a simple metal bar on the roof of the vehicle upon which agencies would mount two rotating beacons, as well as other components such as [[siren (noisemaker)#Vehicle-mounted|sirens]] and stationary \u2018lollipop\u2019 lights.  Soon the beacon manufacturers began producing off-the-shelf complete \u2018lightbars\u2019.\n\nLater, the individual components of the lightbar were integrated into a single contiguous unit, with two elongated  domes on either side of a siren enclosure.  The extended domes allowed for more rotating beacons, additional mirrors, and fixed-beam lights toward the center to replace the \u2018lollipops\u2019.\n\nLightbars may now contain fixed, rotating, strobe, or LED-based lights in various configurations and offering programmable flash patterns.  They may include a second, lower, tier of lamps, such as clear halogen \u2018takedown\u2019 lights towards the front to illuminate the vehicle being stopped, clear side-facing \u2018alley\u2019 spotlights, additional amber or red towards the rear for scene protection, or directional traffic advisory arrows.  The modern trend of locating sirens on or near the front bumper of emergency vehicles has resulted in many lightbar models eliminating the siren housing in lieu of more lighting.\n\nSome lightbar variations are specialized to meet certain desires of the agencies utilizing them, such as those using multiple rotating beacons in a \u2018V\u2019 pattern to provide additional illumination to the sides of the vehicle, and those designed to hug the roof of a vehicle to minimize air resistance or present a lower profile for \u2018stealth\u2019 purposes.\n\n===Body mounted===\n[[File:Ambulance side beacon.png|thumb|left|upright|Body mounted beacon in operation, used to draw attention to the vehicle as it emerges from side roads]]\nSome types of light can be mounted on to the outside of the vehicle (usually a permanent install) and these can be used to provide directional lighting in key areas, such as in front for clearing traffic, or to the rear for scene protection.  They can also form part of the main lighting arrangement for subtly marked or unmarked vehicles.  In this application, the operating service may choose to use lights with clear lenses so as to minimize the possibility of the lights being noticed when not on.\n\nCommon places to mount such beacons include on or in the grill of the vehicle and on the front of the rear view mirrors, where they can gain maximum visibility.  In the UK many emergency vehicles have lights on the side of the bonnet, which helps to warn oncoming traffic when pulling out of junctions.  These lights are often strobe or LED types, as they have the lowest profile for purposes of attachment.\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Vehicle integral===\nSometimes, the existing lighting on a vehicle is modified to create warning beacons.  In the case of [[wig-wag (automobile)|wig-wag]] lighting, this involves adding a device to alternately flash the high-beam headlights, or, in some countries, the rear fog lights.  It can also involve drilling out other lights on the vehicle to add \u2018hideaway\u2019 or \u2018corner strobes\u2019.\n\n[[File:HR 201 Commodore SS - Flickr - Highway Patrol Images (1).jpg|thumb|right|A [[New South Wales Police Force]] unmarked vehicle. The interior mounted lights can be seen on the dashboard]]\n\n===Interior mounted===\nA variety of emergency lights may be used in the interior of a vehicle, generally on the dashboard, visor area, or rear deck.  Uses range from discreet or temporary lighting for unmarked vehicles and volunteer responders, to additional rear lighting on fully marked vehicles, to a \u2018slick-top\u2019 configuration not unlike a full lightbar set.\n\nInterior lighting is available in a variety of form factors, ranging from flat LED panels under the sun visors, to halogen or strobe lights mounted on the rear deck, to \u2018cherry\u2019 or oscillating \u2018teardrop\u2019 lights mounted on the dash. These may be permanently mounted and wired into the vehicle's electrical system, or they may be temporarily mounted and plug into the vehicle's cigarette lighter.  They are often fitted with shields which direct the light through the window, but prevent reflections in to the cab.\n\n[[File:Dobbs Ferry PD cars 908 and 905, autumn 2006.jpg|thumb|right|The police car on the right is a slick-top or \u2018stealth\u2019 vehicle, lacking the roof-mounted lightbar seen on the traditionally equipped car on the left.]]\n\nThe aerodynamic properties of light bars can be important for police applications, as fuel efficiency and drag are concerns in patrol and pursuit.  Because of this, some police cars do not have roof mounted lightbars. These \u2018slick-top\u2019 cars mount their emergency lights within the cruiser, generally around the periphery of the windshield or into the leading or trailing edge of the roof.  Slick-top police cars also lack the silhouette of a lightbar or beacon, making the car harder to identify as a police vehicle from a distance, especially fore and aft.  Because of these visual advantages, these vehicles are sometimes referred to as \u2018stealth\u2019 vehicles.\n\nA key disadvantage of relying solely on internal lighting is the number of lights required to achieve true 360 degree visibility, with most lights usually concentrated front and rear.  This can limit the application of vehicles for instances such as scene protection.\n\n==Scientific research==\n\n===Perception===\nA study at [[Loughborough University]] in the United Kingdom showed that strobe lighting conveyed a greater sense of urgency to other road users, with the faster the flash the greater urgency, potentially helping to speed the emergency vehicle through traffic.  It also concluded that factors such as flash pattern were important, with simultaneously flashing beacons attracting attention far quicker than alternately flashing versions, although this did increase discomfort glare.  In general, as light intensity and the number of beacons present increased, the time it took to gain the attention of other drivers decreased.\n\nThis same study compared different light colors for glare and detection time under both daylight and night conditions.  While red and blue both compared favorably with amber for glare under various conditions, some contradictory findings were observed for detection time.  When all colors were held at equal intensity, amber had the poorest detection time both daytime and night.  However, when the light source was held at constant intensity, the amber filters, which generally let the most light through, had the best detection time.<ref name=\"ICE\">{{cite conference| first = Sharon| last = Cook|author2=Claire Quigley |author3=Laurence Clift| title = Motor vehicle and pedal cycle conspicuity: part 1- vehicle mounted warning beacons.

These potential hazards include:\n* [[Photosensitive epilepsy]] - This is an epileptic reaction to flashing lights in susceptible persons, which can range in severity from an unusual feeling or involuntary twitch to a generalized seizure.  This epileptogenic response can be triggered by lights flashing in the frequency range of 10\u201320&nbsp;Hz, regardless of color.  While individual light sources used on emergency vehicles generally have much lower flash rates than this,<ref>{{cite book| last =Harding| first =Graham F.A.|author2=Peter M.

It also notes that emergency workers may report distraction and eyestrain unrelated to epilepsy from working under the lights.<ref>Cook (2000:\u00a75.3.1)</ref>\n* [[Glare (vision)|Glare]] - A bright light source in a person's field of view can reduce their ability to see other objects.  The effect may be exacerbated by rain, windshields, or eyeglasses.  The study distinguished between \u2018disability glare\u2019, where a driver may be temporarily blinded and unable to see hazards in the road, versus \u2018discomfort glare\u2019, which is a more general effect from lights which may cause motorists to avert their eyes.  The worst effects for disability glare occurred with amber beacons, strobe beacons, and especially bright lights.<ref name=ICE/>\n* [[Phototaxis]] - This is the so-called \u2018moth-to-flame\u2019 effect, where the hypothesis runs that some drivers may be so distracted by the beacons that they are \u2018drawn\u2019 to them.  The Loughborough study, referencing the February 1998 issue of the U.S. trade journal ''Tow Times,'' asserts that there was a lawsuit in the U.S. where a tow operator was found liable for an accident for this reason, though the study authors were unable to locate any supporting scientific research.<ref>{{cite conference| first = Sharon| last = Cook|author2=Claire Quigley |author3=Laurence Clift| title = Motor vehicle and pedal cycle conspicuity - part 3: vehicle mounted warning beacons.

However, it is a darker specification blue than used in other parts of the world.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nRed lights are not common in Europe, though they are used in some countries where red has a specific meaning.  Police in Finland, Estonia, Germany and Sweden use a forward-facing red light to indicate that a driver must pull over and stop. In the U.K., police cars are outfitted with flashing red lights to the rear which are toggled on/off separately from blue lights to indicate caution. Fire Command units are also equipped with them when being used for command duties. As are certain bye-law enforcement and a small selection of private security companies.[[Austria]], [[Germany]] and [[Sweden]] also use red on fire vehicles to designate the command post; in other countries a single green beacon sometimes designates the command post. In Sweden, a green strobe will indicate a medical command vehicle.  Greece uses red on fire engines, and red along with blue on police vehicles. In Hungary, red is used only along with blue (on right in lightbars and roof integration) by police (including military police and diplomatic escort) and ambulance.  In Poland, red is used on designated vehicles, including police and military vehicles, to indicate the beginning and/or end of a convoy (of those type of vehicles).  Until recently the National Police in Slovakia used only blue lights, they have recently started using red and blue lights; Municipal and Military Police used blue lights in Slovakia. In Russia and Belarus, traffic police use red and blue lights, while conventional police along with the rest of the emergency services use only blue lights.\n\n===Argentina===\nArgentina uses blue for police, red for fire, green for ambulances, and amber for utility vehicles.\n\n===Australia===\n[[File:2017 Holden Commodore (VF II MY17) SV6 sedan, Western Australia Police (2018-09-28).jpg|right|thumb|A marked highway patrol car of the [[Western Australia Police]] with red and blue lights]]\n[[File:Roads and Traffic Authority Inspectors.jpg|thumb|A marked [[Roads and Traffic Authority]] vehicle with magenta lights]]\nIn Australia, colors are generally regulated at the state level, but there are some commonalities:\n[[File:RACQ Roadside Assistance 01.jpg|thumb|right|RACQ Roadside Assistance tow truck with amber lights]]\n\n==== Red and blue ====\nThis is used by all State and Federal Police forces, Naval Police, Military Police, Air Force Police and Australian Border Force motor vehicles.

Amber is also used by motor vehicles operating in and around airports and docks, this includes Australian Federal Police and Australian Customs vehicles which are fitted with additional amber lighting to supplement their red and blue lightbars. Queensland State Emergency Service motor vehicles are only authorized to display amber lights under certain circumstances.\n\n==== Green ====\nThese are used to denote a stationary ambulance, fire or police command motor vehicle. In Queensland it is also used on some State Forest bush fire units along with the amber. Further, in Queensland, some municipal animal control units use a green and amber light combination.\n\n==== Blue ====\nBlue lights are reserved for emergency motor vehicles in general, such as police, fire, ambulance, State Emergency Service (except Queensland) and traffic commanders. Blue by itself is also used by airport emergency vehicles to designate a command vehicle.\n\n==== Magenta ====\nSometimes referred to as purple, magenta lights are primarily used by heavy vehicle enforcement/escort officers of the NSW Roads and Maritime Services, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] [[VicRoads]] and South Australian Transport Safety Inspectors.  They are also used in combination with amber lights by some [[council ranger]]s<ref>A council ranger is a type of peace officer found in Australia who enforces municipal ordinances, and has limited police powers.</ref> and the [[New South Wales]] Ministry of Transport. In Western Australia magenta is used by the Department Of Environment and Conservation \u2018HAZMAT Response Unit\u2019. Magenta is also used in some Escort Vehicles used whilst escorting large mining equipment to the north of the state.\n\n==== White ====\nWhite lights are used on most newer emergency vehicles, both as an extra color on lightbars and in the form of \u2018[[Wig-wag (automobile)|wig-wag]]\u2019 headlights.\n\nMany police motor vehicles, and less often other emergency services, also fit LED matrix variable message displays to vehicle lightbars. Such message bars used in New South Wales by the police and fire brigade are capable of displaying numerous messages warning motorists of various hazards or dangers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/inthesmoke/5366760206/sizes/l/in/pool-884026@N25/ |title=flickr.com |publisher=flickr.com |accessdate=2013-01-05}}</ref>\n{{clear right}}\n\n=== Belgium ===\nBelgian law prohibits red lights facing forward and therefore emergency vehicles normally only use blue lights (red lights are allowed at the rear).

However, rather unusually, it is not specified what types of lights and sirens can be used.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mintransporte.gov.co/descargar.php?idFile=2619|title=Concepto_0206.pdf}}</ref> Since emergency vehicles are usually imported from other parts of the world, one can see a great variety of light colors and siren types in Colombia. Since most law enforcement duties are consolidated in the [[National Police of Colombia|National Police]], there is some uniformity in police vehicles. Until the early 1990s, these police vehicles were equipped with yellow lights, although today they are equipped with a single red and blue LED lightbar on the roof, and sometimes supplementary red, white, and blue grille lights. Other, more minor law enforcement vehicles (Military Police, CTI, UNP) generally follow the same scheme.\n\nFire trucks are generally imported from the US, and therefore primarily use red lights although European-style fire trucks with blue lights can sometimes be seen and, more rarely, yellow lights as in Spain.\n\nLike the US, ambulance service in Colombia is often contracted out to private companies, and some hospitals operate their own ambulance services. These different services outfit their vehicles differently, so there is little uniformity. Also, many ambulances are imported from other countries and retain the lighting schemes of their country of origin. Most ambulances use red or red and white light combinations. However, ambulances operated by the National Police and the Army are equipped with red and blue lights. Some ambulances can be seen with green lights, meaning they were imported from Argentina where ambulances always use green lights. Others still can be seen with yellow lights, like in Spain.\n\nAs in most of the world, utility vehicles usually use flashing yellow/amber lights.\n\nAlthough only emergency and utility vehicles are allowed to display flashing colored lights, this law is usually not enforced and it is common to see private vehicles customized with colored lights. Taxis commonly display flashing blue lights as decoration, although some taxi drivers install sirens onto their vehicles in order to get around traffic. Many ''busetas'' (the traditional, unregulated bus systems in many urban areas) and [[Chiva bus|chivas]] (rural, informal, public buses) also display colorful flashing lights.\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\nSpecial audible warning device (siren) supplemented with special warning in blue color can be fitted to vehicles. Specifically vehicles classified for primary emergency services (state police, professional fire brigades, emergency ambulances) can use from 2019 combination of blue and red lights. Red lights must be installed only on the left side of vehicle, whereas ratio of blue and red ligths on vehicle must be 1:1. \nWhite flashing light can be used as minor suplementary color in lightbars. \n\n* Ministry of Interior used by the [[Police of Czech Republic|police]] and identified by special legislation,\n* the [[Prison Service of the Czech Republic|Prison Service]],\n* military police designated by special legislation,\n*[[Municipal police|Municipal Police]], which determines the municipality,\n* fire departments,\n* mine rescue service,\n* emergency service gas facilities,\n* emergency medical services and transport sick, wounded and pregnant women,\n* used by the Armed Forces military rescue units for carrying out humanitarian tasks of civil protection.\n* the customs administration marked by a special regulation.\n\nAmber lights are used for non-emergency warning on many different vehicles - e.g. road construction vehicles, heavy transports, tow trucks, municipal services (dustcarts, road hoovers), ...\n\nOther colors for flashing lights or beacons are not allowed.\n\n=== France ===\n[[File:Ford police nationale Strasbourg - juin 2014.jpg|thumb|right|[[Police Nationale]] police car with blue lights]]\n\n==== Blue ====\nWhen responding, emergency vehicles (including Police cars) are required to have, at least, one -360 degrees visible- blue light on the roof.\nFrench law strictly states what kind of blue lights and sirens an emergency vehicle can display, with 2 different categories.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=D9C2503AA65A0F350BC24F064A54BAEA.tpdjo04v_3?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006057859&dateTexte=20110221 |title=Arr\u00eat\u00e9 du 30 octobre 1987 relatif aux dispositifs sp\u00e9ciaux de signalisation des v\u00e9hicules d'intervention urgente |publisher=Legifrance |date=2004-12-23 |accessdate=2018-06-27}}</ref>\n\n* The first category includes Fire, local and national Police, [[Gendarmerie]], Customs, Penitentiary service, public EMS (SAMU), private ambulances under SAMU contract and government civil defence. These vehicles must use two-tones sirens and beacons with a rotating effect, and/or lightbars with flashing or rotating effects. They can also use two additional blue, flashing, front-facing lights.\n* The second category includes other private ambulances, blood/organ transport, railroad security, snow plows, highway maintenance/safety and electricity/gas units which respond to incidents and Banque de France transport trucks. These vehicles must only use three-tones sirens (except snow plows) and beacons with a flashing effect, and/or lightbars with flashing effects.\n\n==== Amber ====\nFor any emergency vehicle, amber lights can be used with or without blue, to warn other drivers the emergency vehicle is stopped or slow. Non-emergency vehicles allowed to use amber include agricultural, construction, utility, oversized, tow and airport vehicles.\n\n==== Green or red ====\nThese are not considered emergency lights, but are often used on the roof of command vehicles at the scene of incidents.\n\n=== Germany ===\n[[File:Rtwnef Ambulance Rettungsdienst Germany.jpg|thumb|right|German emergency vehicles (all blue beacons).]]\nOnly emergency and police vehicle may use blue lights. This includes firefighters, rescue services, emergency response vehicles for public utilities and civil defense units. All other kinds of blue lights (e.g. car floor lighting or cab interior lights), including reflective stickers or paintings, are illegal on public roads.<ref>\u00a752 Abs 3 Stra\u00dfenverkehrszulassungsordnung</ref> Flashing blue lights and sirens may only be used by authorized vehicles in case of emergency and order all other vehicles to make way, since these vehicles have the absolute right of way. Blue lights alone may be used to secure the site of an accident (or a standing emergency vehicle). Sometimes, columns of emergency or police vehicles use blue lights (without sirens) to make the column more visible to other vehicles.<ref>\u00a738 Stra\u00dfenverkehrsordnung</ref>\n\nBlue and yellow are the only colours of flashing lights legal for use on moving vehicles. Other colours, such as red or green are sometimes used to show vehicles of special functions, such as incident command, when stationary.\n\nGerman police lightbars often have \u2018''POLIZEI''\u2019 written in white over the dome, and usually incorporate an [[LED]] text display that can read, in mirrored writing if towards the front, \u2018''HALT'' ''POLIZEI''\u2019 or \u2018''BITTE FOLGEN''\u2019 (\u2018please follow\u2019), to signal drivers to pull over. In the newest generation, the text display changes between German and English (''HALT POLIZEI'' \u2192 STOP POLICE and ''BITTE FOLGEN'' \u2192 FOLLOW ME).\n\n=== Greece ===\n[[Hellenic Police|Police]] used to have blue-colored emergency lights but after a recent restock of vehicles, now the use of both blue and red color is usual. Fire Departments make use of red only emergency light while ambulances either use red or both colors. Regulation also states that the [[Military of Greece|Military]] as well as vehicles carrying politicians can make use of a single rotating blue light at the roof. Every other individual and/or company may use yellow lights for either warning or emergency. Special groups like Emergency Response teams and agents may also include emergency lights on their private vehicles in case of an emergency when not in active duty. All utility vehicles such as construction related, tow trucks must be equipped with a yellow-colored emergency light bar on the top, clearly visible from the front and rear side. The same applies for private security firm vehicles, that are in generally treated like typical private cars.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n===Hong Kong===\nUnder [[Hong Kong Law]], Chapter 374G of the [[Road Traffic (Traffic Control) Regulations]]: Section 46 ''Giving way to animals, police vehicles, ambulances, etc.,'' drivers must yield to vehicles which are sounding siren and/or flashing light bars.\n\n*'''Red and blue''': [[Hong Kong Police Force]]\n*'''Red only''': [[Fire Services Department]] fire engines\n*'''Blue only''': Ambulances, whether operated by Fire Services Department, [[Auxiliary Medical Services]], or [[Hong Kong St. John Ambulance]]; [[Customs and Excise Department (Hong Kong)|Customs and Excise Department]], [[Hong Kong Correctional Services]]\n*'''Amber only''': Utility vehicles, [[Civil Aid Service]], all vehicles in the air-side of the [[Hong Kong International Airport|airport]] (for pilots' visibility), [[Hong Kong Immigration Department]] vehicles\n\n=== Hungary ===\n\n==== Blue lights only ====\nThese are used by police, ambulance service, emergency blood transport, fire brigade, emergency response teams (public services), correction facilities.\n\n==== Blue and red ====\nUsed on most police and ambulance, and on some types of fire vehicles, but red is to be used only in combo with blue. Ambulances usually have large integrated roof corner flash lights, 3 blue ones and 1 red at front right position, and 3-5 or more smaller red/blue flash lights on mirrors, hood, grill, side and back, mounted and used in a zig-zag pattern. Separately-mounted external lightbars on ambulances are rare, used just on doctor's cars and older vans. Police cruisers usually have a lightbar similar to that of German units (Hella 3) with red and blue lights (red on right, like on ambulances), a blue flash behind the windscreen, and additional blue flash lights in the grill. Since Dec 2017, new police lightbars feature integrated LED matrix to display messages to front (mirrored) and rear, alternatively changing text in Hungarian and English. Some police units often use additional lighting, e.g. strobe lights, alternating headlight flash, behind-windshield blue/red lights. Detachable blue flash lamps are occasionally used by unmarked cars of special police forces, by personal transport services for government members, and diplomatic convoy/escort vehicles.\n\n==== Amber ====\nAmber or yellow flashing lights and lightbars are for warning some special attribute (e.g. oversized, slow, parking at unexpected places etc.) of vehicles like garbage trucks, road cleaning/control/repair, snow plow, car assistance services, construction, transporting dangerous materials etc. Amber/yellow lights do not grant traffic privileges, except to go in the opposite direction in one-way streets or driving on the opposite side in some cases, e.g. road cleaning.\n\n*\n\n===Indonesia===\n\nUnder the Indonesian Legislation number 22 year of 2009 section 59 the colors and users of lightbars are:\n\n*'''Blue:''' [[Indonesian National Police]] and escort units\n*'''Red:''' Ambulance, fire brigade, and Search & Rescue units\n*'''Amber:''' Tow Trucks, and Road engineer vehicles\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Ireland===\n[[File:Dfbyellowamb.JPG|thumb|An [[Dublin Fire Brigade]] ambulance responding with flashing blue lights.]]\n\n==== Blue lights ====\n\nUsage of emergency vehicle lighting is restricted in Ireland through the Road Traffic Lighting of Vehicles (Blue and Amber Lamps) Regulations 2011<ref>{{citation|title=Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) (Blue and Amber Lamps) Regulations 2011|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2011/si/695/made/en/|publisher= Government of Ireland|year=2011|accessdate=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n\nThe main colour for [[emergency service]] vehicles is overwhelmingly blue, although there is also widespread use of flashing (white) headlights, and many police vehicles have a set of two rear-facing red flashing lights to indicate that the police car is stopped or to indicate caution. \n\nThe use of blue lights not exceeding 50w are limited to vehicles being used-\n* By a member of the [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na]] in the performance of his or her duties as such member.\n* As a [[fire brigade]] vehicle.This Includes a vehicle used by senior fire officers in the performance of their duty as such officer.<ref>{{cite web|title=FAQs on Flashing Lights on Vehicles |url=https://www.rsa.ie/Documents/VS_Information_Notes/Vehicle_Parts/FAQs%20on%20Emergency%20Flashing%20Lights%20on%20Vehicles.pdf</ref>\n*[[File:An garda siochana ford ranger crowd control.jpg|thumb|Blue lights in use on a Garda Roads Policing vehicle]]By persons providing an [[ambulance]] service.\n*By the [[Irish Prison Service]].\n*As an [[Irish Coast Guard|Irish Marine Emergency Service vehicle]], with or without a trailer.\n*For the delivery or collection of human transplant organs human blood or human blood products.\n*Marked [[Military Police Corps (Ireland)|Military Police]] vehicles.\n\n[[File:Dublin Fire Brigade Foam and Environmental Unit in National Services Day.jpg|thumb|Dublin Fire Brigade Foam and Environmental Unit with blue flashing led lights.]]\n\nAlthough not specifically linked to the use of warning beacons, the police, fire brigade and ambulance services (but not the other emergency services listed above) may also choose to allow their drivers to claim legal exemptions from most motoring regulations, such as being able to treat a red [[traffic light]] as a [[give way sign]], exceeding the speed limit, passing the wrong side of a keep left/right sign, or parking in restricted areas.<ref>{{citation|title=ROAD TRAFFIC ACT 2010 |chapter=Part 5 Section 87|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2010/act/25/section/87/enacted/en/|publisher=[[Government of Ireland]]}} (NB: police, fire brigade, ambulance)</ref> \n\nNo qualification other than a [[driving licence]] is legally required to use blue lights.

Vehicles using flashing blue lights and siren have right of way over all other vehicles. Only designated emergency/priority vehicles may use blue lights; this includes police, fire brigade, ambulance service and a few other, smaller services such as the [[blood bank]] and some [[lifeguard]] organizations. [[Netherlands|Dutch]] police vehicles have an LED matrix display, which can show different texts in red lighting. Most often used are ''STOP POLITIE'' (ordering a driver to pull over and stop) or ''VOLGEN POLITIE'' (ordering driver to follow the police vehicle). Standard Dutch police cars often have the text bar incorporated in the light bar, vans and motorcycles usually have a separate sign on the front of the vehicle. On ambulances, a green beacon indicates the command vehicle when multiple units are responding to an incident - usually this is the first vehicle that arrives on the scene. Newer ambulance models also have a text display that will alternate the words \u2018Ambulance\u2019 and \u2018''Spoed''\u2019 (\u2018urgent\u2019). When ever the vehicles are on scene (usually fire brigade vehicles and some police vans), or staying in place for another reason, they need to switch to amber lighting to signal that they are not moving.\n\n===New Zealand===\n[[File:2008-2009 Holden VE Commodore Omega sedan (New Zealand Police) 01.jpg|thumb|Typical New Zealand Police patrol vehicle with current LED lightbar, LED dash lighting and alternating headlights.]]\n[[File:DAF 2008 LF 55 Emergency Hazmat Command Unit in Christchurch.jpg|thumb|Christchurch Hazmat Command Unit truck with Federal Signal Corp Vision SLR lightbar.]]\n\nIn New Zealand, the colors used on lightbars and beacons are defined by the New Zealand Transport Authority regulations.<ref name=\"Landtransport.govt.nz\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nzta.govt.nz/resources/rules/vehicle-lighting-2004-index.html|title=Land Transport NZ: Vehicle Lighting 2004, Rule 32005|publisher=Landtransport.govt.nz|accessdate=2010-10-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzta.govt.nz/road-user-safety/new-road-rules/summary-of-changes.html|title=Land Transport NZ: 2004 summary|publisher=Ltsa.govt.nz|accessdate=2010-10-09}}{{dead link|date=March 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\n*'''Red and blue''': [[New Zealand Police]].

Blue flashing lights are used by police, military police, customs, fire departments, rescue services, and ambulances. Government, VIP, and embassy vehicles may also use blue if accompanied by local police. Any vehicle equipped with a blue flashing light must have a permission issued by the DMV. The operator of such vehicle must be a qualified emergency vehicle operator and have a \u2018code 160\u2019 endorsement on their [[driver's license]]. Blue lights can be used alone or with an additional siren. The siren may not be used alone. The operator of an emergency vehicle may disregard speed limits and [[traffic light]]s with caution.

Red flashing lights are no longer in use, and were last used in the early 1960s.\n\n=== Poland ===\nOnly designated vehicles (such as Police, Fire Service, Ambulances, Internal Affairs, etc.) are permitted to use blue light. The sale of a blue emergency light is permitted, however, the possession of such a light in vehicles (whether turned on or off, visible or not) is strictly illegal. Red lights are used by the first and last vehicle of a convoy of designated vehicles and also are strictly regulated. Amber lights are seeing increasing popularity in recent years, however, specific uses are designated according to the Polish \u2018''Kodeks Drogowy''\u2019. There are no specific rules governing the use of other colors such as purple, green, or clear lights.\n\n=== Romania ===\nThe three emergency lights used in [[Romania]] are red, blue and amber. At a red flashing light, bringing the vehicle to a full stop is compulsory, while for a blue light yielding, slowing down and moving out of the way is compulsory, and an amber light means other traffic vehicles must proceed with caution due to an oversized or slow vehicle.\n\nThe cars that are allowed to use red lights are the [[Romanian Police]] and the [[Romanian General Inspectorate for Emergency Situations|Roman General Inspectorate for Emergency Situations]].\n\nCars that are allowed to use a blue rotating light are the [[Romanian Police]] (including [[Municipal police (Romania)|Local Police]]), [[Romanian Gendarmerie]], [[Romanian Border Police]], emergency medical services (including [[SMURD]]), [[Romanian General Inspectorate for Emergency Situations|Civil Protection]], [[Ministry of National Defense (Romania)|Ministry of National Defense]], [[Romanian Intelligence Service|Special Units of the Romanian Intelligence Service]], [[Protection and Guard Service]], [[Ministry of Justice (Romania)|Ministry of Justice - General Directorate of Prisons]], Public Ministry when in mission, [[National Anticorruption Directorate]] when in mission, and [[Financial Guard (Romania)|Financial Guard vehicles]].\n\nThe amber rotating light mean the vehicle and some accompanying vehicles are oversized, overweight, transporting dangerous goods, work as road/street maintenance, are tow trucks, are tractors, or are [[agricultural vehicle]]s.\n\n=== Russia ===\n* '''Red and blue''': Traffic police (DPS Dorozhno Patrulnaya Sluzhba Road Patrol Service); FSO (Federalnaya Sluzhba Ohrany Federal Protective Service); FSB (Federalnaya Sluzhba Besopasnosti Federal Security Service)\n* '''Blue''': Police, ambulance, fire brigade, EMERCOM vehicles, gas emergency service, Central Bank of Russia vehicles.\n* '''Amber''': Construction and utility vehicles, airport service vehicles (excluding emergency vehicles), snow removal.\n* '''White''': Russian post, armored cash transport cars.\n\n=== Serbia ===\n\n* '''Blue''': Police, ambulance service, fire brigade, military police, military ambulance, traffic police.\n* '''Blue and red''': First vehicle of a police vehicles convoy ore military police convoy.\n* '''Amber''': Municipality police, utility and construction vehicles, heavy machines, tractors, slow vehicles.\n\n=== Slovenia ===\n\n* '''Blue''': Police, ambulance service, fire brigade, military police, military ambulance, traffic police.\n* '''Blue and Red''': First vehicle of a police vehicles convoy.\n* '''White''': Additional lightbar color, [[wig-wag (automobile)|wig-wag]] on emergency vehicles, accident scene lighting (fire and ambulance)\n* '''Amber''': Municipality police, utility and construction vehicles, heavy machines, slow vehicles.\n\n===South Korea===\n* '''Red''': Fire department, Gyeongi province ambulances, some police vehicles\n* '''Blue''': Police motorcycles, some police vehicles, volunteer firefighters\n* '''Red and blue''': Police patrol cars\n* '''Green''': Ambulances (some privately operated ambulances use green and red lights)\n* '''Yellow/amber''': Utility vehicles, Security Company\n\n=== Spain ===\nThe law used to allow only the [[Cuerpo Nacional de Polic\u00eda]], [[Guardia Civil]], Polic\u00eda Local and autonomous law-enforcement agencies to use blue lights, so in contrast with convention in Europe, civil defense, ambulances (Ambulancia) and fire engines (Bomberos) had to use yellow/amber lights (the only other color authorized, in contrast to convention in which these color lights are used to denote slow vehicles). Some [[Autonomous Communities]] allowed other colors, such as blue, red or white (the latter two of which is used by [[SAMUR]] in Madrid), however, these are technically illegal to use throughout Spain. In 2018 a new law finally allowed these kind of emergency vehicles to use blue lights, giving them 2 years to make the switch from yellow/amber to blue. Yellow/amber lights are now only used in wide-load trucks and their accompanying vehicles among other special vehicles, such as tractors or tow trucks.

Any vehicle not so fitted, such as an ambulance responding to a medical emergency on an aircraft, has to be accompanied by one so fitted.\n\nAmber lights are also used by the [[Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency]] and the [[Highways England Traffic Officer Service]] (with the addition of red lights) to stop vehicles.\n\n====Other lights====\n\nGreen flashing beacons can be used by Doctors (registered with the [[General Medical Council]]) when responding to a medical emergency.  Many doctors now either volunteer or are employed as First Responders for ambulance services and their vehicles will carry the, usually blue, lights used by the service or both blue and green to indicate their profession.

Hazard lights may be wired to function at the same time, to make civilians further conscious of their presence.

Most tow trucks mount rear-facing red lights to be used in sync with the vehicle's normal stop lights.\n* In [[Wisconsin]], tow trucks are required to be equipped with red lights but such lights may be operated only when the tow truck is standing on or near the traveled portion of a highway preparatory to towing or servicing a disabled vehicle.\n* In [[California]], emergency vehicles must display at least one forward-facing steady-burn red light. Some exceptions are occasionally made for individual vehicles.\n* In [[New York (state)|New York]], emergency vehicles must only display red lighting to the front and sides of the vehicle, with white lighting being optional. Blue lights are only permitted to be displayed to the rear.\n* In [[Michigan]], emergency road service vehicles such as tow trucks are allowed to use red warning lights only when stationary.\n* In [[Missouri]], tow trucks and road service vehicles, volunteer firefighters and EMS may use red and blue. Electric companies may use red.\n\n==== Amber or yellow ====\n\n* Often used by utility vehicles such as construction vehicles, tow trucks, snow plows, funeral escorts and hearses, security patrol vehicles, postal vehicles or other vehicles which may be stopped or moving slower than the flow of traffic.\n* Amber is usually the most permissively regulated color.\n* In California, emergency vehicles must display at least one rearward-facing flashing amber light.(par 36)\n\n==== White ====\n\n* Often used as an optional color on lightbars, usually in combination with other colors to increase visibility, though it may be restricted to emergency vehicles in some states. Some lightbars include separate or integrated steady burn white lights that face forward (\"takedown lights\") or to the sides (\"alley lights\") to allow for better visibility of objects around the vehicle at night.\n* White is rarely used as the only color on a lightbar, though some states{{efn|Alabama, Arkansas, Rhode Island, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Maryland, West Virginia, South Dakota, Texas, Louisiana, and Kentucky require flashing white lights on school buses}} require flashing white beacons on the rear of school buses as a rear-end collision prevention measure.\n* Historically, white was used in combination with red bulb lenses in the Federal Signal Corporation Beacon Ray rotating beacon, introduced in 1948 and the later 1960s and 1970s model P A lights equipped with clear domes on through the 1980s, when revolving bulb and reflector type emergency lighting including the later 1970s Twinsonic and Aerodynic lightbars were supplanted with newer strobe types. The four bulb Beacon Ray Model 175 with a clear dome and colored lenses over the bulbs were used extensively in the 1960s by the NYPD with two red bulbs alternated with a white bulb and an amber bulb canted upwards at a 45-degree angle so the amber flash would reflect off upper-floor building windows for added traffic attention/visibility. This clear dome/colored bulb lens combination also found extensive use across the US as fire apparatus and ambulance lighting.\n* Certain railroad-related machines, like fueling tankers, track maintenance and switching engines, may also use a flashing white light. \n* In some states, certain government vehicles such as rural mail delivery vehicles use a flashing white beacon .\n\n==== Green ====\n[[File:'09-'12 Ford Escape Mall At Millenia.jpg|thumb|A security vehicle using green lights in a mall in [[Florida]]]]\n\n*Since [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] green is used by Homeland Security Agencies and government/private security agencies protecting high risk government and critical infrastructure.\n*Green emergency lighting is used on vehicles which are protecting nuclear facilities, oil & gas depots, water storage facilities and dams, gas pipelines, airports, defense facilities, maritime facilities, and all other areas which are at a high risk of terrorist attacks.\n*Green emergency lighting is also used by private security agencies securing certain government buildings and establishments where terrorist organizations may also target. However, in the State of Florida, green is allowed for use by all private security vehicles only in combination with amber lights. (Florida state legislation is pending to also allow flashing clear/white lights in combination with amber/green security patrol lights for added visibility.)\n*Green and blue emergency lighting is used by some counter-terrorism agencies whilst responding to terrorist incidents, so as to distinguish the specialist agencies from other emergency departments.\n*In the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, green and blue is used by Homeland & National Security agencies by Municipal Police Forces in addition to counter-terrorism security agencies.\n*In Washington State, under the provisions of RCW 46.37.185, a firefighter may use a green light on their privately owned vehicle with the approval of the fire chief of the department they are employed by. The green light is used for identification purposes only and does not convey any special rights or status to the vehicle.\n*In Oregon, and some other states, the \u2018command\u2019 vehicle at a fire scene may use a green light to identify its location.\n*In Tennessee, motorcycles in funeral processions use green lights.\n*In Ohio, snowplows used by the Ohio Department of Transportation use a combination of green and amber lights.\n*In New York, Connecticut and Indiana, volunteer EMTs use green lights\n*In New York City, a single flashing green light separated from the other red and blue flashing lights on an NYPD vehicle denotes it as a THV (Temporary Headquarters Vehicle) also known as a Mobile Command Post vehicle and also used on a 2-star Assistant Chiefs marked RMP (Radio Motor Patrol) vehicle to identify it as such.\n*In [[Michigan]], flashing or oscillating green lights denote municipal vehicles actively removing ice, snow, or other materials from roads.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(ksybegv0qjwolh5s3jgpbtpz))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&objectname=mcl-257-698|title=Michigan Legislature - Section 257.698|website=www.legislature.mi.gov|access-date=2019-01-30}}</ref>\n\n==== Blue ====\n\n*Reserved for law enforcement, firefighters and EMTs.\n*In New Mexico tow trucks may have blue lights in combination with amber.\n*In Texas, highway maintenance vehicles display blue in combination with amber.\n*In California, blue lights may only be used on vehicles operated by Peace Officers, as defined under California Penal Code 830.1 to 830.38.

In the latter case, the lights are used as a courtesy to \u2018request\u2019 the right of way and generally do not mandate pulling over.  Some states, such as  Pennsylvania, limit volunteer use of red lights to chiefs and captains of squads.\n\nSeparate colors may be used for fire versus EMS volunteers.  In Connecticut, Indiana, and New York, volunteer firefighters use blue while volunteer EMTs use green. In New Jersey, volunteer fire and ambulance personnel use blue lights in their personal vehicles while responding to their stations. In NJ red lights are only allowed for emergency vehicles, fire chiefs, chief officers of first aid or rescue squads, or other law enforcement vehicles. In Iowa, volunteer firefighters can use flashing blue lights on their personal vehicles, while volunteer EMTs can use flashing white (clear) lights.\n\nNew York also certifies some volunteer EMTs to use red lights and sirens provided their vehicles carry certain equipment;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.health.state.ny.us/nysdoh/ems/policy/01-01.htm |title=NYS Department of Health: Authorizing Private Vehicles as EASV\u2019s (Use of Red Lights & Sirens) |publisher=Health.state.ny.us |accessdate=2010-10-09}}</ref> this is often used by [[Hatzolah]] volunteers in the NYC area. Typically in New York state, volunteer firefighters use blue lights in their personal vehicles and volunteer EMS use green lights.  This may generate confusion, as green lights are also used to signify an [[incident command]] vehicle. In the state of Texas, \u201ca private vehicle of a volunteer firefighter or a certified emergency medical services employee or volunteer when responding to a fire alarm or medical emergency\u201d is considered an \u201cauthorized emergency vehicle\u201d and may use alternately flashing lighting equipment or may be equipped with a siren, exhaust whistle, or bell.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.txdps.state.tx.us/RSD/PSB/News/blue_lights.htm |title=Texas Department of Public Safety: Red, White, or Blue Lights |accessdate=2015-01-20}}</ref>\n\nThe conflicting color assignments can create issues for volunteers who drive their vehicles out of state. One color in their state may mean firefighter or EMT when in another state it may mean police. While some authorities may be satisfied with covering the lights with an \u2018Out Of Service\u2019 tarpaulin, compliance may be more difficult in other jurisdictions.  For example, Arkansas bars civilian possession of blue lights on or in a vehicle unless sealed in the manufacturer's original package.<ref>[http://www.arkansashighways.com/Info/Act300/2007/27/27-36-301.htm Arkansas Motor Vehicle and Traffic Laws \u00a7 27-36-301: Violations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624190453/http://www.arkansashighways.com/Info/Act300/2007/27/27-36-301.htm |date=June 24, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n====Utility vehicles====\n[[File:GoldShieldSecurityCar.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Private Security Car with Amber/Yellow Lightbar on top.]]\n\nAmber lights are often used on vehicle involved in non-emergency work. Most utility companies, towing services, oversize load vehicles, slow vehicles, and certain types of construction equipment mount some type of lightbar or lighting system for a higher degree of visibility.\n\nIn [[Detroit, Michigan]], [[Devil's Night#Angels' Night|Angels' Night]] volunteers will patrol neighborhoods with yellow lights to help deter vandalism during [[Devil's Night]] and [[Halloween]]. Typically these lights are the single beacon kind, although lightbars have been used for vehicles of this type, especially on wreckers/tow trucks.\n\nIn [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], Tennessee most city maintenance vehicles (including MLG&W utility trucks) with flashing lights use yellow lights; however, some vehicles with the traffic engineering department use red flashing lights, especially vehicles equipped with cherry pickers used to repair traffic signals.\n\nIn states that do not enforce specific rules about green, yellow or white lights, these colors are often used by entities like private security companies which may be ineligible to use blue or red lights but need emergency lights for traffic and site visibility. Security vehicles generally use their lights on private property, in addition some security vehicles are off-road only such as ATV and Golf cart type vehicles. and in most jurisdictions security vehicles are generally not allowed a \u2018courtesy\u2019 or \u2018emergency\u2019 status on public roads.\n\n====Optional colors====\nWhile certain colors are customarily used by different services, often other colors are optionally used, such as amber and white. Sometimes, this is done to satisfy particular regulations; for example, California requires a steady red light facing forward and a flashing amber light to the rear on every emergency vehicle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/d12/vc25259.htm |title=CA Vehicle Code \u00a725252: Warning Lamps on Authorized Emergency Vehicles |publisher=Dmv.ca.gov |accessdate=2010-10-09}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Fire engines}}\n{{Commons category|Ambulances}}\n* [[Automotive lighting]]\n* [[Emergency vehicle equipment]]\n{{clear right}}\n\n==References==\n;Footnotes\n{{Notelist}}\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Emergency Vehicle Lighting}}\n[[Category:Automotive technologies]]\n[[Category:Emergency vehicles]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Signalling lights]]\n", "name_user": "User-duck", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eJapan:Move image away from bullets.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_vehicle_lighting"}

During his presidency, McKinley led the nation to victory in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], raised [[protective tariff]]s to promote American industry and kept the nation on the [[gold standard]] in a rejection of [[free silver]] (effectively, expansionary [[monetary policy]]).\n\nMcKinley was the last president to have served in the [[American Civil War]] and the only one to have started the war as an [[enlisted soldier]], beginning as a private in the [[Union Army]] and ending as a [[brevet (military)|brevet]] major. After the war, he settled in [[Canton, Ohio]], where he practiced law and married [[Ida Saxton]]. In 1876, he was elected to [[United States Congress|Congress]], where he became the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s expert on the [[protective tariff]], which he promised would bring prosperity. His 1890 [[McKinley Tariff]] was highly controversial, which together with a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] redistricting aimed at [[gerrymandering]] him out of office led to his defeat in the [[1890 United States House of Representatives elections|Democratic landslide of 1890]]. He was elected [[governor of Ohio]] in 1891 and 1893, steering a moderate course between capital and labor interests. With the aid of his close adviser [[Mark Hanna]], he [[William McKinley 1896 presidential campaign|secured the Republican nomination for president in 1896]] amid a deep economic depression. He defeated his Democratic rival [[William Jennings Bryan]] after a [[front porch campaign]] in which he advocated \"[[sound money]]\" (the gold standard unless altered by international agreement) and promised that high tariffs would restore prosperity.\n\nRapid economic growth marked McKinley's presidency. He promoted the 1897 [[Dingley Tariff]] to protect manufacturers and factory workers from foreign competition and in 1900 secured the passage of the [[Gold Standard Act]]. McKinley hoped to persuade Spain to grant independence to rebellious [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Cuba]] without conflict, but when negotiation failed he led the nation into the Spanish-American War of 1898. The United States victory was quick and decisive. As part of [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|the peace settlement]], Spain turned over to the United States its main overseas colonies of [[Puerto Rico]], [[Guam]] and the [[United States Military Government of the Philippine Islands|Philippines]] while [[United States Military Government in Cuba|Cuba]] was promised independence, but at that time remained under the control of the United States Army. The United States [[Annexation of Hawaii|annexed]] the independent [[Republic of Hawaii]] in 1898 and it became a [[Territory of Hawaii|United States territory]].\n\nHistorians regard McKinley's 1896 victory as a [[realigning election]] in which [[Third Party System|the political stalemate]] of the post-Civil War era gave way to the Republican-dominated [[Fourth Party System]], which began with the [[Progressive Era]]. McKinley defeated Bryan again in the [[1900 United States presidential election|1900 presidential election]] in a campaign focused on [[imperialism]], [[protectionism]] and free silver. His legacy was suddenly cut short when he was shot on September 6, 1901 by [[Leon Czolgosz]], a second-generation [[Polish-American]] with [[Anarchism in the United States|anarchist]] leanings. McKinley died eight days later and was succeeded by his Vice President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. As an innovator of American [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionism]] and pro-business sentiment, McKinley's presidency is [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|generally considered above average]], though his highly positive public perception was soon overshadowed by Roosevelt.\n\n==Early life and family==\n[[File:McKinley boy.png|left|thumb|upright|William McKinley at age 15]]\nWilliam McKinley Jr. was born in 1843 in [[Niles, Ohio]], the seventh of nine children of [[William McKinley Sr.]] and Nancy (n\u00e9e Allison) McKinley.{{sfnm|Leech||1p=4|Morgan||2p=2}} The McKinleys were of [[English Americans|English]] and [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] descent and had settled in western Pennsylvania in the 18th century, tracing back to a David McKinley who was born in [[Dervock]], County Antrim, in present-day [[Northern Ireland]]. There, the elder McKinley was born in [[Pine Township, Mercer County, Pennsylvania|Pine Township, Mercer County]].{{sfnm|Leech||1p=4|Morgan||2p=2}}\n\nThe family moved to Ohio when the senior McKinley was a boy, settling in [[Lisbon, Ohio|New Lisbon]] (now Lisbon).

Graduating from [[Poland Seminary]] in 1859, he enrolled the following year at [[Allegheny College]] in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]]. He was an honorary member of the [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity, Volume 2|last=Levere|first=William|publisher=Lakeside Press|year=1911|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=204\u201319}}</ref> He remained at Allegheny for only one year, returning home in 1860 after becoming ill and depressed.

Such a course would be inflationary, but advocates argued that the economic benefits of the increased [[money supply]] would be worth the inflation; opponents warned that \"[[free silver]]\" would not bring the promised benefits and would harm the United States in international trade.{{sfn|Horner|pp=180\u201381}} McKinley voted for the [[Bland\u2013Allison Act]] of 1878, which mandated large government purchases of silver for striking into money, and also joined the large majorities in each house that overrode Hayes' veto of the legislation. In so doing, McKinley voted against the position of the House Republican leader, his fellow Ohioan and friend, [[James Garfield]].{{sfnm|Morgan||1pp=46\u201347|Horner||2pp=181\u201382}}\n\n[[File:Mckin.jpg|thumb|Representative McKinley]]\n\nFrom his first term in Congress, McKinley was a strong advocate of protective tariffs. The primary purposes of such imposts was not to raise revenue, but to allow American manufacturing to develop by giving it a price advantage in the domestic market over foreign competitors. McKinley biographer [[Margaret Leech]] noted that Canton had become prosperous as a center for the manufacture of farm equipment because of [[protectionism|protection]], and that this may have helped form his political views. McKinley introduced and supported bills that raised protective tariffs, and opposed those that lowered them or imposed tariffs simply to raise revenue.{{sfnm|Leech||1pp=36\u201337|Phillips||2pp=42\u201344}} Garfield's election as president in 1880 created a vacancy on the [[House Ways and Means Committee]]; McKinley was selected to fill it, placing him on the most powerful committee after only two terms.{{sfn|Morgan|p=55}}\n\nMcKinley increasingly became a significant figure in national politics. In 1880, he served a brief term as Ohio's representative on the [[Republican National Committee]]. In 1884, he was elected a delegate to [[1884 Republican National Convention|that year's Republican convention]], where he served as chair of the Committee on Resolutions and won plaudits for his handling of the convention when called upon to preside. By 1886, McKinley, Senator [[John Sherman]], and Governor [[Joseph B. Foraker]] were considered the leaders of the Republican party in Ohio.{{sfn|Phillips|pp=60\u201361}} Sherman, who had helped to found the Republican Party, ran three times for the Republican nomination for president in the 1880s, each time failing,{{sfn|Morgan|pp=73\u201374}} while Foraker began a meteoric rise in Ohio politics early in the decade. Hanna, once he entered public affairs as a political manager and generous contributor, supported Sherman's ambitions, as well as those of Foraker. The latter relationship broke off at the [[1888 Republican National Convention]], where McKinley, Foraker, and Hanna were all delegates supporting Sherman. Convinced Sherman could not win, Foraker threw his support to the unsuccessful Republican 1884 presidential nominee, [[Maine]] Senator [[James G. Blaine]]. When Blaine stated he was not a candidate, Foraker returned to Sherman, but the nomination went to former [[Indiana]] senator [[Benjamin Harrison]], who was elected president. In the bitterness that followed the convention, Hanna abandoned Foraker, and for the rest of McKinley's life, the Ohio Republican Party was divided into two factions, one aligned with McKinley, Sherman, and Hanna and the other with Foraker.{{sfn|Horner|pp=59\u201360, 72\u201378}} Hanna came to admire McKinley and became a friend and close adviser to him. Although Hanna remained active in business and in promoting other Republicans, in the years after 1888, he spent an increasing amount of time boosting McKinley's political career.{{sfn|Horner|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nIn 1889, with the Republicans in the majority, McKinley sought election as [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]]. He failed to gain the post, which went to [[Thomas Brackett Reed|Thomas B. Reed]] of [[Maine]]; however, Speaker Reed appointed McKinley chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. The Ohioan guided the [[McKinley Tariff]] of 1890 through Congress; although McKinley's work was altered through the influence of special interests in the Senate, it imposed a number of protective tariffs on foreign goods.{{sfn|Phillips|pp=27, 42\u201343}}\n\n===Gerrymandering and defeat for re-election===\nRecognizing McKinley's potential, the Democrats, whenever they controlled the Ohio legislature, sought to [[Gerrymandering|gerrymander]] or redistrict him out of office.{{sfn|Phillips|p=27}} In 1878, McKinley faced election in a redrawn 17th district; he won anyway, causing Hayes to exult, \"Oh, the good luck of McKinley! He was gerrymandered out and then beat the gerrymander! We enjoyed it as much as he did.\"{{sfn|Morgan|p=54}} After the 1882 election, McKinley was unseated on an election contest by a near party-line House vote.{{sfn|Morgan|pp=59\u201360}} Out of office, he was briefly depressed by the setback, but soon vowed to run again. The Democrats again redistricted Stark County for the 1884 election; McKinley was returned to Congress anyway.{{sfn|Morgan|pp=60\u201362}}\n\n[[File:Judge cover September 1890 - On to Ohio.png|thumb|''Judge'' magazine cover from September 1890, showing McKinley (left) having helped dispatch Speaker Reed's opponent in early-voting Maine, hurrying off with the victor to McKinley's \"gerrymandered\" Ohio district]]\nFor 1890, the Democrats gerrymandered McKinley one final time, placing Stark County in the same district as one of the strongest pro-Democrat counties, [[Holmes County, Ohio|Holmes]], populated by solidly Democratic [[Pennsylvania Dutch]]. The new boundaries seemed good, based on past results, for a Democratic majority of 2000 to 3000. The Republicans could not reverse the gerrymander as legislative elections would not be held until 1891, but they could throw all their energies into the district, as the McKinley Tariff was a main theme of the Democratic campaign nationwide, and there was considerable attention paid to McKinley's race. The Republican Party sent its leading orators to Canton, including Blaine (then [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]), Speaker Reed and President Harrison. The Democrats countered with their best spokesmen on tariff issues.{{sfn|Jensen|pp=150\u201351}} McKinley tirelessly stumped his new district, reaching out to its 40,000 voters to explain that his tariff\n\n{{quote |\nwas framed for the people&nbsp;... as a defense to their industries, as a protection to the labor of their hands, as a safeguard to the happy homes of American workingmen, and as a security to their education, their wages, and their investments&nbsp;... It will bring to this country a prosperity unparalleled in our own history and unrivalled in the history of the world.\"{{sfn|McKinley|p=464}}\n}}\n\nDemocrats ran a strong candidate in former lieutenant governor [[John G. Warwick]]. To drive their point home, they hired young partisans to pretend to be peddlers, who went door to door offering 25-cent tinware to housewives for 50 cents, explaining the rise in prices was due to the McKinley Tariff. In the end, McKinley lost by 300 votes, but the Republicans won a statewide majority and claimed a moral victory.{{sfn|Jensen|pp=151\u201353}}\n\n===Governor of Ohio (1892\u20131896)===\nEven before McKinley completed his term in Congress, he met with a delegation of Ohioans urging him to run for governor. Governor [[James E. Campbell]], a Democrat, who had defeated [[Joseph B. Foraker|Foraker]] in 1889, was to seek re-election in 1891. The Ohio Republican party remained divided, but McKinley quietly arranged for Foraker to nominate him at the 1891 state Republican convention, which chose McKinley by acclamation. The former congressman spent much of the second half of 1891 campaigning against Campbell, beginning in his birthplace of Niles. Hanna, however, was little seen in the campaign; he spent much of his time raising funds for the election of legislators pledged to vote for Sherman in the 1892 senatorial election.{{sfn|Horner|p=46}}{{sfn|Morgan|pp=117\u201319}}{{efn|name=Seventeenth Amendment}} McKinley won the 1891 election by some 20,000 votes;{{sfn|Williams|p=50}} the following January, Sherman, with considerable assistance from Hanna, turned back a challenge by Foraker to win the legislature's vote for another term in the Senate.{{sfn|Horner|pp=86\u201387}}\n\n[[File:Blaine breaks out.png|right|thumb|Even after his final run for president in 1884, [[James G.

Although no declared Republican candidate opposed Harrison, many Republicans were ready to dump the President from the ticket if an alternative emerged. Among the possible candidates spoken of were McKinley, Reed, and the aging Blaine. Fearing that the Ohio governor would emerge as a candidate, Harrison's managers arranged for McKinley to be permanent chairman of [[1892 Republican National Convention|the convention]] in [[Minneapolis]], requiring him to play a public, neutral role. Hanna established an unofficial McKinley headquarters near the convention hall, though no active effort was made to convert delegates to McKinley's cause. McKinley objected to delegate votes being cast for him; nevertheless he finished third, behind the renominated Harrison, and behind Blaine, who had sent word he did not want to be considered.{{sfn|Horner|pp=92\u201396}} Although McKinley campaigned loyally for the Republican ticket, Harrison was defeated by former President Cleveland in [[1892 United States presidential election|the November election]]. In the wake of Cleveland's victory, McKinley was seen by some as the likely Republican candidate in 1896.{{sfn|Morgan|pp=128\u201329}}\n\nSoon after Cleveland's return to office, hard times struck the nation with the [[Panic of 1893]]. A businessman in [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]], Robert Walker, had lent money to McKinley in their younger days; in gratitude, McKinley had often guaranteed Walker's borrowings for his business. The governor had never kept track of what he was signing; he believed Walker a sound businessman. In fact, Walker had deceived McKinley, telling him that new notes were actually renewals of matured ones. Walker was ruined by the recession; McKinley was called upon for repayment in February 1893.{{sfn|Morgan|pp=129\u201330}} The total owed was over $100,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|.1|1893|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}) and a despairing McKinley initially proposed to resign as governor and earn the money as an attorney.{{sfn|Morgan|pp=130\u201334}} Instead, McKinley's wealthy supporters, including Hanna and Chicago publisher [[H. H. Kohlsaat]], became trustees of a fund from which the notes would be paid. Both William and Ida McKinley placed their property in the hands of the fund's trustees (who included Hanna and Kohlsaat), and the supporters raised and contributed a substantial sum of money. All of the couple's property was returned to them by the end of 1893, and when McKinley, who had promised eventual repayment, asked for the list of contributors, it was refused him. Many people who had suffered in the hard times sympathized with McKinley, whose popularity grew.{{sfn|Morgan|pp=130\u201334}} He was easily re-elected in November 1893, receiving the largest percentage of the vote of any Ohio governor since the Civil War.{{sfn|Phillips|p=67}}\n\nMcKinley campaigned widely for Republicans in the 1894 midterm congressional elections; many party candidates in districts where he spoke were successful. His political efforts in Ohio were rewarded with the election in November 1895 of a Republican successor as governor, [[Asa S. Bushnell (Governor)|Asa Bushnell]], and a Republican legislature that elected Foraker to the Senate. McKinley supported Foraker for Senate and Bushnell (who was of Foraker's faction) for governor; in return, the new senator-elect agreed to back McKinley's presidential ambitions. With party peace in Ohio assured, McKinley turned to the national arena.{{sfn|Phillips|pp=69\u201370}}\n\n==Election of 1896==\n{{Further|1896 United States presidential election|William McKinley 1896 presidential campaign}}\n\n===Obtaining the nomination===\n[[File:Mark Hanna by WJ Root, 1896 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|McKinley's close friend and adviser, [[Mark Hanna]]]]\nIt is unclear when William McKinley began to seriously prepare a run for president. As Phillips notes, \"no documents, no diaries, no confidential letters to Mark Hanna (or anyone else) contain his secret hopes or veiled stratagems.\"{{sfn|Phillips|p=61}} From the beginning, McKinley's preparations had the participation of Hanna, whose biographer William T. Horner noted, \"what is certainly true is that in 1888 the two men began to develop a close working relationship that helped put McKinley in the White House.\"{{sfn|Horner|p=81}} Sherman did not run for president again after 1888, and so Hanna could support McKinley's ambitions for that office wholeheartedly.{{sfn|Horner|p=92}}\n\nBacked by Hanna's money and organizational skills, McKinley quietly built support for a presidential bid through 1895 and early 1896. When other contenders such as Speaker Reed and [[Iowa]] Senator [[William B. Allison]] sent agents outside their states to organize Republicans in support of their candidacies, they found that Hanna's agents had preceded them. According to historian Stanley Jones in his study of the 1896 election,\n\n{{quote |\nAnother feature common to the Reed and Allison campaigns was their failure to make headway against the tide which was running toward McKinley. In fact, both campaigns from the moment they were launched were in retreat. The calm confidence with which each candidate claimed the support of his own section [of the country] soon gave way to&nbsp;... bitter accusations that Hanna by winning support for McKinley in their sections had violated the rules of the game.{{sfn|Jones|p=103}}\n}}\n\nHanna, on McKinley's behalf, met with the eastern Republican [[political boss]]es, such as Senators [[Thomas C. Platt|Thomas Platt]] of New York and [[Matthew Quay]] of Pennsylvania, who were willing to guarantee McKinley's nomination in exchange for promises regarding patronage and offices. McKinley, however, was determined to obtain the nomination without making deals, and Hanna accepted that decision.{{sfn|Jones|p=105}} Many of their early efforts were focused on the South; Hanna obtained a vacation home in southern Georgia where McKinley visited and met with Republican politicians from the region. McKinley needed 453\u00bd delegate votes to gain the nomination; he gained nearly half that number from the South and [[border states (American Civil War)|border states]]. Platt lamented in his memoirs, \"[Hanna] had the South practically solid before some of us awakened.\"{{sfn|Williams|p=57}}\n\n[[File:Coronation of McKinley.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|[[Louis Dalrymple]] cartoon from [[Puck (magazine)|''Puck'' magazine]], June 24, 1896, showing McKinley about to crown himself with the Republican nomination.

Morton]], and Illinois Senator [[Shelby Cullom]]. Delegate-rich Illinois proved a crucial battleground, as McKinley supporters, such as Chicago businessman (and future vice president) [[Charles G. Dawes]], sought to elect delegates pledged to vote for McKinley at the national convention in St. Louis. Cullom proved unable to stand against McKinley despite the support of local Republican machines; at the state convention at the end of April, McKinley completed a near-sweep of Illinois' delegates.{{sfn|Jones|pp=119\u201325}} Former president Harrison had been deemed a possible contender if he entered the race; when Harrison made it known he would not seek a third nomination, the McKinley organization took control of Indiana with a speed Harrison privately found unseemly. Morton operatives who journeyed to Indiana sent word back that they had found the state alive for McKinley.{{sfn|Jones|pp=117\u201319}} Wyoming Senator [[Francis Warren]] wrote, \"The politicians are making a hard fight against him, but if the masses could speak, McKinley is the choice of at least 75% of the entire [body of] Republican voters in the Union\".{{sfn|Phillips|pp=71\u201372}}\n\nBy the time the national convention began in [[St. Louis]] on June 16, 1896, McKinley had an ample majority of delegates. The former governor, who remained in Canton, followed events at the convention closely by telephone, and was able to hear part of Foraker's speech nominating him over the line. When Ohio was reached in the roll call of states, its votes gave McKinley the nomination, which he celebrated by hugging his wife and mother as his friends fled the house, anticipating the first of many crowds that gathered at the Republican candidate's home. Thousands of partisans came from Canton and surrounding towns that evening to hear McKinley speak from his front porch<!-- I want to save the link to \"front porch campaign\" for the next section -->. The convention nominated Republican National Committee vice chairman [[Garret Hobart]] of New Jersey for vice president, a choice actually made, by most accounts, by Hanna. Hobart, a wealthy lawyer, businessman, and former state legislator, was not widely known, but as Hanna biographer [[Herbert Croly]] pointed out, \"if he did little to strengthen the ticket he did nothing to weaken it\".{{sfn|Horner|pp=159\u201362}}{{sfn|Williams|p=59}}\n\n===General election campaign===\n{{for|additional information on the currency question|Cross of Gold speech#Background}}\n[[File:McKinley straddle.jpg|thumb|left|Before the 1896 convention, McKinley tried to avoid coming down on one side or the other of the currency question.

In the final days before the convention, McKinley decided, after hearing from politicians and businessmen, that the platform should endorse the gold standard, though it should allow for bimetallism through in coordination with other nations. Adoption of the platform caused some western delegates, led by Colorado Senator [[Henry M. Teller]], to walk out of the convention. However, compared with the Democrats, Republican divisions on the issue were small, especially as McKinley promised future concessions to silver advocates.{{sfn|Phillips|pp=52, 81\u201382}}{{sfn|Cherny|pp=55\u201356}}{{sfn|Jones|p=177}}\n\nThe bad economic times had continued, and strengthened the hand of forces for [[free silver]]. The issue bitterly divided the Democratic Party; President Cleveland firmly supported the gold standard, but an increasing number of rural Democrats wanted silver, especially in the South and West. The silverites took control of the [[1896 Democratic National Convention]] and chose [[William Jennings Bryan]] for president; he had electrified the delegates with his [[Cross of Gold speech]]. Bryan's financial radicalism shocked bankers\u2014they thought his inflationary program would bankrupt the railroads and ruin the economy.

The candidate then responded, speaking on campaign issues in a speech molded to suit the interest of the delegation. The speeches were carefully scripted to avoid extemporaneous remarks; even the spokesman's remarks were approved by McKinley or a representative. This was done as the candidate feared an offhand comment by another that might rebound on him, as [[1884 United States presidential election#Campaign|had happened to Blaine in 1884]].{{sfn|Leech|pp=88\u201389}}{{sfn|Williams|pp=131, 226}}{{sfn|Jones|p=285}}\n\n[[File:Man of Mark.png|thumb|right|upright|''A Man of Mark'' 1896 [[Homer Davenport]] cartoon of McKinley as Hanna's creature, from [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s New York ''Journal''|alt=A political cartoon.

By the end of September, the Republicans had discontinued printing material on the silver issue, and were entirely concentrating on the tariff question.{{sfn|Morgan|p=184}} On November 3, 1896, the voters had their say. McKinley won the entire Northeast and Midwest; he won 51% of the vote and an ample majority in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]].

Sherman had an outstanding reputation but old age was fast reducing his abilities. McKinley needed to have Hanna appointed to the Senate so Senator Sherman was moved up. {{sfn|Gould|pp=17\u201318}} Sherman's mental faculties were decaying even in 1896; this was widely spoken of in political circles, but McKinley did not believe the rumors.{{sfn|Gould|pp=17\u201318}} Nevertheless, McKinley sent his cousin, William McKinley Osborne, to have dinner with the 73-year-old senator; he reported back that Sherman seemed as lucid as ever.{{sfnm|Morgan||1pp=194\u201395, 285|Leech||2pp=152\u201353}} McKinley wrote once the appointment was announced, \"the stories regarding Senator Sherman's 'mental decay' are without foundation&nbsp;...

Charles Dawes, who had been Hanna's lieutenant in Chicago during the campaign, was considered for the Treasury post but by some accounts Dawes considered himself too young. Dawes eventually became [[Comptroller of the Currency]]; he recorded in his published diary that he had strongly urged McKinley to appoint as secretary the successful candidate, [[Lyman J.

McKinley was reluctant, stating to one Roosevelt booster, \"I want peace and I am told that your friend Theodore is always getting into rows with everybody.\" Nevertheless, he made the appointment.{{sfn|Morgan|pp=199\u2013200}}\n\nIn addition to Sherman, McKinley made one other ill-advised Cabinet appointment,{{sfn|Phillips|p=127}}<!-- \"McKinley had made a few unwise appointments in 1897, especially Russell Alger at the War Department and John Sherman at State\" --> that of [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], which fell to [[Russell A.

However, he proved a valuable adviser both for McKinley and for his Cabinet members.

McKinley had spoken out against [[lynching]] while governor, and most African Americans who could vote supported him in 1896. McKinley's priority, however, was in ending [[sectionalism]], and they were disappointed by his policies and appointments. Although McKinley made some appointments of African Americans to low-level government posts, and received some praise for that, the appointments were less than they had received under previous Republican administrations. [[Blanche Bruce|Blanche K. Bruce]], an African American who during [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]] had served as senator from [[Mississippi]], received the post of register at the Treasury Department; this post was traditionally given to an African American by Republican presidents. McKinley appointed several black postmasters; however, when Democrats protested the appointment of Justin W. Lyons as postmaster of [[Augusta, Georgia]], McKinley asked Lyons to withdraw (he was subsequently given the post of Treasury register after Bruce's death in 1898).{{sfn|Gould|pp=153\u201354}} The President did appoint George B. Jackson, a former slave, to the post of customs collector in [[Presidio, Texas]].{{sfn|Louisiana Historical Assoc, ''Cohen''}} However, African Americans in northern states felt that their contributions to McKinley's victory were overlooked; few were appointed to office.{{sfn|Gould|pp=153\u201354}}\n\nThe administration's response to racial violence was minimal, causing him to lose black support.{{sfn|Gould|pp=153\u201354}} When black postmasters at [[Hogansville, Georgia]] in 1897, and at [[Lake City, South Carolina]] the following year, were assaulted, McKinley issued no statement of condemnation. Although black leaders criticized McKinley for inaction, supporters responded by saying there was little the president could do to intervene. Critics replied by saying that he could at least publicly condemn such events, as Harrison had done.{{sfn|Gould|p=155}}\n\nAccording to historian Clarance A. Bacote, \"Before the Spanish\u2013American War, the Negroes, in spite of some mistakes, regarded McKinley as the best friend they ever had.\"{{sfn|Bacote|p=234}} Under pressure from black leaders, McKinley required the War Department to commission black officers above the rank of lieutenant. McKinley toured the South in late 1898, promoting sectional reconciliation. He visited [[Tuskegee Institute]] and black educator [[Booker T. Washington]]. He also visited Confederate memorials. In his tour of the South, McKinley did not mention the racial tensions or violence. Although the President received a rapturous reception from Southern whites, many African Americans, excluded from official welcoming committees, felt alienated by the President's words and actions.{{sfn|Gould|pp=156\u201357}}{{sfnm|Bacote||1pp=235\u201337|Leech||2p=348}} Gould concluded regarding race, \"McKinley lacked the vision to transcend the biases of his day and to point toward a better future for all Americans\".{{sfnm|Gould||1pp=159\u201360|Phillips||2p=149}}\n\n===1900 election===\n{{Main|1900 United States presidential election}}\n[[File:The Administration's Promises Have Been Kept.jpg|thumb|McKinley ran on his record of prosperity and victory in 1900, winning easy re-election over [[William Jennings Bryan|Bryan]].]]\n\nRepublicans were generally successful in state and local elections around the country in 1899, and McKinley was optimistic about his chances at re-election in 1900.{{sfn|Gould|pp=207\u201308}} McKinley's popularity in his first term assured him of renomination for a second.{{sfn|Gould|pp=213\u201314}} The only question about the Republican ticket concerned the vice presidential nomination; McKinley needed a new running mate as Hobart had died in late 1899.{{sfn|Gould|pp=215\u201317}} McKinley initially favored [[Elihu Root]], who had succeeded Alger as Secretary of War, but McKinley decided that Root was doing too good a job at the War Department to move him.{{sfn|Gould|pp=215\u201317}} He considered other prominent candidates, including Allison and [[Cornelius Newton Bliss|Cornelius N. Bliss]], but none were as popular as the Republican party's rising star, [[Theodore Roosevelt]].{{sfn|Phillips|pp=120\u201322}} After a stint as [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]], Roosevelt had resigned and raised [[Rough Riders|a cavalry regiment]]; they fought bravely in Cuba, and Roosevelt returned home covered in glory. Elected governor of New York on a reform platform in 1898, Roosevelt had his eye on the presidency.{{sfn|Gould|pp=215\u201317}} Many supporters recommended him to McKinley for the second spot on the ticket, and Roosevelt believed it would be an excellent stepping stone to the presidency in 1904.{{sfn|Gould|pp=215\u201317}} McKinley remained uncommitted in public, but Hanna was firmly opposed to the New York governor.{{sfn|Leech|pp=531\u201333}} The Ohio senator considered the New Yorker overly impulsive; his stance was undermined by the efforts of [[political boss]] and New York Senator [[Thomas C. Platt]], who, disliking Roosevelt's reform agenda, sought to sideline the governor by making him vice president.{{sfn|Horner|pp=260\u201366}}\n\nWhen the [[1900 Republican National Convention|Republican convention]] began in [[Philadelphia]] that June, no vice presidential candidate had overwhelming support, but Roosevelt had the broadest range of support from around the country.{{sfn|Gould|pp=215\u201317}} McKinley affirmed that the choice belonged to the convention, not to him.{{sfn|Gould|p=218}} On June 21, McKinley was unanimously renominated and, with Hanna's reluctant acquiescence, Roosevelt was nominated for vice president on the first ballot.{{sfn|Leech|pp=540\u201342}} The [[1900 Democratic National Convention|Democratic convention]] convened the next month in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] and nominated William Jennings Bryan, setting up a rematch of the 1896 contest.{{sfn|Gould|pp=219\u201320}}\n\nThe candidates were the same, but the issues of the campaign had shifted: free silver was still a question that animated many voters, but the Republicans focused on victory in war and prosperity at home as issues they believed favored their party.{{sfnm|Gould||1pp=226\u201327|Leech||2pp=543\u201344}} Democrats knew the war had been popular, even if the imperialism issue was less sure, so they focused on the issue of trusts and corporate power, painting McKinley as the servant of capital and big business.{{sfnm|Gould||1pp=227\u201328|Leech||2pp=544\u201346}} As in 1896, Bryan embarked on a speaking tour around the country while McKinley stayed at home, this time making only one speech, to accept his nomination.{{sfn|Leech|pp=549\u201357}} Roosevelt emerged as the campaign's primary speaker and Hanna helped the cause working to settle a [[Coal strike of 1902#The 1899 and 1900 strikes|coal miners strike in Pennsylvania]].{{sfn|Gould|p=228}} Bryan's campaigning failed to excite the voters as it had in 1896, and McKinley never doubted that he would be re-elected.{{sfnm|Gould||1p=229|Leech||2p=558}} On November 6, 1900, he was proven correct, winning the largest  victory for any Republican since 1872.{{sfn|Leech|p=559}} Bryan carried only four states outside the [[solid South]], and McKinley even won Bryan's home state of Nebraska.{{sfn|Leech|p=559}}\n\n===Second term===\nSoon after [[Second inauguration of William McKinley|his second inauguration]] on March 4, 1901, William and Ida McKinley undertook a six-week tour of the nation. Traveling mostly by rail, the McKinleys were to travel through the South to the Southwest, and then up the Pacific coast and east again, to conclude with a visit on June 13, 1901, to the [[Pan-American Exposition]] in [[Buffalo, New York]].{{sfn|Miller|pp=289\u201390}} However, the First Lady fell ill in California, causing her husband to limit his public events and cancel a series of speeches he had planned to give urging trade reciprocity. He also postponed the visit to the fair until September, planning a month in Washington and two in Canton before the Buffalo visit.{{sfn|Gould|pp=247\u201349}}\n\n===Assassination===\n{{Main|Assassination of William McKinley}}\n[[File:McKinley last photo.jpg|thumb|McKinley entering the Temple of Music on September 6, 1901, shortly before the shots were fired]]\n[[File:McKinleyAssassination.jpg|thumb|Artist's conception of the shooting of McKinley]]\n\nAlthough McKinley enjoyed meeting the public, Cortelyou was concerned with his security due to recent assassinations by anarchists in Europe, such as the assassination of King [[Umberto I of Italy]] the previous year, and twice tried to remove a public reception from the President's rescheduled visit to the Exposition. McKinley refused, and Cortelyou arranged for additional security for the trip.{{sfn|Miller|p=294}} On September 5, the President delivered his address at the fairgrounds, before a crowd of some 50,000 people. In his final speech, McKinley urged reciprocity treaties with other nations to assure American manufacturers access to foreign markets. He intended the speech as a keynote to his plans for a second term.{{sfn|Miller|pp=298\u2013300}}{{sfn|Gould|pp=250\u201351}}\n\nOne man in the crowd, [[Leon Czolgosz]], hoped to assassinate McKinley. He had managed to get close to the presidential podium, but did not fire, uncertain of hitting his target.{{sfn|Miller|pp=298\u2013300}} Czolgosz, after hearing a speech by anarchist [[Emma Goldman]] in Cleveland, had decided to do something he believed would advance the cause. After his failure to get close enough on the fifth, Czolgosz waited the next day at the [[Temple of Music]] on the Exposition grounds, where the President was to meet the public. Czolgosz concealed his gun in a handkerchief, and, when he reached the head of the line, shot McKinley twice in the abdomen.{{sfn|Miller|pp=300\u201301}}\n\nMcKinley urged his aides to break the news gently to Ida, and to call off the mob that had set on Czolgosz\u2014a request that may have saved his assassin's life.{{sfn|Miller|pp=301\u201302}} McKinley was taken to the Exposition aid station, where the doctor was unable to locate the second bullet. Although a primitive [[X-ray machine]] was being exhibited on the Exposition grounds, it was not used. McKinley was taken to the Milburn House.{{sfnm|Leech||1pp=596\u201397|Miller||2pp=312\u201315}}\n\nIn the days after the shooting McKinley appeared to improve. Doctors issued increasingly optimistic bulletins. Members of the Cabinet, who had rushed to Buffalo on hearing the news, dispersed; Vice President Roosevelt departed on a camping trip to the [[Adirondacks]].{{sfnm|Miller||1pp=315\u201317|Morgan||2pp=401\u201302}} Leech wrote, {{quote|It is difficult to interpret the optimism with which the President's physicians looked for his recovery. There was obviously the most serious danger that his wounds would become septic. In that case, he would almost certainly die, since drugs to control infection did not exist&nbsp;... [Prominent New York City physician] [[Charles McBurney (surgeon)|Dr. McBurney]] was by far the worst offender in showering sanguine assurances on the correspondents. As the only big-city surgeon on the case, he was eagerly questioned and quoted, and his rosy prognostications largely contributed to the delusion of the American public.{{sfn|Leech|p=599}}\n}}\n\nOn the morning of September 13, McKinley's condition deteriorated. Specialists were summoned; although at first some doctors hoped that McKinley might survive with a weakened heart, by afternoon they knew the case was hopeless. Unknown to the doctors, the [[gangrene]] that would kill him was growing on the walls of his stomach, slowly poisoning his blood. McKinley drifted in and out of consciousness all day; when awake he was the model patient. By evening, McKinley too knew he was dying, \"It is useless, gentlemen. I think we ought to have prayer.\"{{sfn|Leech|p=600}}{{sfn|Miller|pp=318\u2013319}} Relatives and friends gathered around the death bed. The First Lady sobbed over him, \"I want to go, too.

God's will be done, not ours\" and with final strength put an arm around her.{{sfn|Miller|p=320}} He may also have sung part of his favorite hymn, \"[[Nearer, My God, to Thee]]\",{{sfn|Leech|p=601}} although other accounts have her singing it softly to him.{{sfn|Miller|p=320}}\n \nAt 2:15&nbsp;a.m. on September 14, President McKinley died. Theodore Roosevelt had rushed back to Buffalo and took the oath of office as president. Czolgosz, put on trial for murder nine days after McKinley's death, was found guilty, sentenced to death on September 26, and executed by [[electric chair]] on October 29, 1901.{{sfn|Miller|pp=321\u201330}}\n\n==Funeral, memorials, and legacy==\n===Funeral and resting place===\n[[File:President McKinley's funeral, 1901. 4134s1.webmsd.webm|thumb|upright=0.9|President McKinley's funeral, 1901, part 1]]\n[[File:President McKinley's funeral, 1901. 4134s2.webmsd.webm|thumb|upright=0.9|President McKinley's funeral, 1901, part 2]]\n[[File:President McKinley's funeral, 1901. 4134s3.webmsd.webm|thumb|upright=0.9|President McKinley's funeral, 1901, part 3]]\n\nAccording to Gould, \"The nation experienced a wave of genuine grief at the news of McKinley's passing.\"{{sfn|Gould|p=252}} The stock market, faced with sudden uncertainty, suffered a steep decline\u2014almost unnoticed in the mourning. The nation focused its attention on the casket that made its way by train, first to Washington, where it first lay in the [[East Room]] of the Executive Mansion, and then [[Lying in state#United States|in state]] in the Capitol, and then was taken to Canton.{{sfn|Morgan|pp=402\u201303}} A hundred thousand people passed by the open casket in the [[Capitol Rotunda]], many having waited hours in the rain; in Canton, an equal number did the same at the Stark County Courthouse on September 18. The following day, a funeral service was held at the First Methodist Church; the casket was then sealed and taken to the McKinley house, where relatives paid their final respects.{{sfn|McElroy|p=167}} It was then transported to the receiving vault at [[West Lawn Cemetery]] in Canton, to await the construction of the memorial to McKinley already being planned.{{sfn|Morgan|p=403}}\n\nThere was a widespread expectation that Ida McKinley would not long survive her husband; one family friend stated, as William McKinley lay dying, that they should be prepared for a double funeral.{{sfn|Miller|p=348}} This did not occur; the former first lady accompanied her husband on the funeral train. Leech noted \"the circuitous journey was a cruel ordeal for the woman who huddled in a compartment of the funeral train, praying that the Lord would take her with her Dearest Love\".{{sfn|Leech|p=602}} She was thought too weak to attend the services in Washington or Canton, although she listened at the door to the service for her husband in her house on North Market Street. She remained in Canton for the remainder of her life, setting up a shrine in her house, and often visiting the receiving vault, until her death at age 59 on May 26, 1907.{{sfn|Miller|p=348}} She died only months before the completion of [[McKinley National Memorial|the large marble monument]] to her husband in Canton, which was dedicated by President Roosevelt on September 30, 1907. William and Ida McKinley are interred there with their daughters, atop a hillside overlooking the city of Canton.{{sfnm|McElroy||1pp=189\u201393|Morgan||2p=406}}\n\n===Other memorials===\nIn addition to the Canton site there are many memorials to McKinley. There is the ''[[William McKinley Monument]]'' in front of the [[Ohio Statehouse]] in Columbus, Ohio and [[National McKinley Birthplace Memorial|a monument at his birthplace]] in Niles; 20&nbsp;Ohio schools bear his name.{{sfn|McElroy|p=189}} There are several schools in the United States named [[McKinley School (disambiguation)|McKinley School]]. Nearly a million dollars was pledged by contributors or allocated from public funds for the construction of McKinley memorials in the year after his death.{{sfn|Olcott|p=388}} Phillips suggests the significant number of major memorials to McKinley in Ohio reflected the expectation among Ohioans in the years after McKinley's death that he would be ranked among the great presidents.{{sfn|Phillips|p=161}}\n\nStatues to him may be found in more than a dozen states; his name has been bestowed on streets, civic organizations, and libraries. In 1896, a gold prospector gave McKinley's name to [[Denali]], the tallest mountain in North America at {{convert|20310|ft}}. The Alaska Board of Geographic Names changed the name of the mountain back to Denali in 1975, which is what it was called by locals. The [[Department of the Interior]] followed suit in August 2015 as a part of a visit to Alaska by President [[Barack Obama]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hirschfeld Davis|first1=Julie|title=Mount McKinley Will Be Renamed Denali|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/31/us/mount-mckinley-will-be-renamed-denali.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur&_r=0|website=The New York Times |accessdate=August 30, 2015}}</ref> Similarly, [[Denali National Park]] was known as Mount McKinley National Park until December 2, 1980, when it was changed by legislation signed by President [[Jimmy Carter]].{{sfn|McElroy|p=189}}\n\n===Legacy and historical image===\n[[File:Harriet Anderson Stubbs Murphy - William McKinley - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|The official Presidential portrait of William McKinley, by [[Harriet Anderson Stubbs Murphy]].]]\n\nMcKinley's biographer, H. Wayne Morgan remarks that McKinley died the most beloved president in history.{{sfn|Morgan|p=404}} However, the young, enthusiastic Roosevelt quickly captured public attention after his predecessor's death. The new president made little effort to secure the trade reciprocity McKinley had intended to negotiate with other nations. Controversy and public interest surrounded Roosevelt throughout the seven and a half years of his presidency as memories of McKinley faded; by 1920, according to Gould, McKinley's administration was deemed no more than \"a mediocre prelude to the vigor and energy of Theodore Roosevelt's\".{{sfn|Gould|p=252}} Beginning in the 1950s, McKinley received more favorable evaluations; nevertheless, in surveys ranking American presidents, he has generally been placed near the middle, often trailing contemporaries such as Hayes and Cleveland.{{sfn|Gould|p=252}} Morgan suggests that this relatively low ranking is due to a perception among historians that while many decisions during McKinley's presidency profoundly affected the nation's future, he more followed public opinion than led it, and that McKinley's standing has suffered from altered public expectations of the presidency.{{sfn|Morgan|p=472}}\n\nThere has been broad agreement among historians that McKinley's election was at the time of a transition between two political eras, dubbed the [[Third Party System|Third]] and [[Fourth Party System]]s.{{sfn|Nice|p=448}} Kenneth F.

Klinghard argued that McKinley's personal control of the 1896 campaign gave him the opportunity to reshape the presidency\u2014rather than simply follow the party platform\u2014by representing himself as the voice of the people.{{sfn|Klinghard|pp=736\u201360}} Republican [[Karl Rove]] exalted McKinley as the model for a sweeping political realignment behind George W. Bush in the 2000s{{sfn|Rove}}\u2014a realignment that did not happen. Some political scientists, such as David Mayhew, questioned whether the 1896 election truly represented a realignment, thereby placing in issue whether McKinley deserves credit for it.{{sfn|Rauchway|pp=242\u201344}} Historian Michael J. Korzi argued in 2005 that while it is tempting to see McKinley as the key figure in the transition from congressional domination of government to the modern, powerful president, this change was an incremental process through the late 19th and early 20th centuries.{{sfn|Korzi|p=281}}\n\nPhillips writes that McKinley's low rating is undeserved, and that he should be ranked just after the great presidents such as Washington and Lincoln. He pointed to McKinley's success at building an electoral coalition that kept the Republicans mostly in power for a generation.{{sfn|Phillips|pp=156\u201357}} Phillips believes that part of McKinley's legacy is the men he included in his administration, who dominated the Republican Party for a quarter century after his death. These officials included Cortelyou, who served in three Cabinet positions under Roosevelt, and Dawes, who became vice president under [[Calvin Coolidge|Coolidge]]. Other McKinley appointees who later became major figures include Day, whom Roosevelt elevated to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] where he remained nearly twenty years, and [[William Howard Taft]], whom McKinley had made [[Governor-General of the Philippines]] and who succeeded Roosevelt as president.{{sfn|Phillips|pp=163\u201364}} After the assassination, the present [[United States Secret Service]] came into existence, when the [[United States Congress|Congress]] deemed it necessary, that presidential protection be part of its duties.<ref>[[United States Secret Service]]\n[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-president-william-mckinleys-assassination-led-modern-secret-service-180964868/]</ref>\n\nA controversial aspect of McKinley's presidency is territorial expansion and the question of imperialism\u2014with the exception of the Philippines, granted independence in 1946, the United States retains the territories taken under McKinley.{{sfn|Phillips|p=154}} The territorial expansion of 1898 is often seen by historians as the beginning of [[American imperialism|American empire]].{{sfn|Phillips|p=99}} Morgan sees that historical discussion as a subset of the debate over the rise of America as a world power; he expects the debate over McKinley's actions to continue indefinitely without resolution, and notes that however one judges McKinley's actions in American expansion, one of his motivations was to change the lives of Filipinos and Cubans for the better.{{sfn|Morgan|p=468}}\n\nMorgan alludes to the rise of interest in McKinley as part of the debate over the more assertive American foreign policy of recent decades:{{quote|McKinley was a major actor in some of the most important events in American history. His decisions shaped future policies and public attitudes. He usually rises in the estimation of scholars who study his life in detail.

During his presidency, McKinley led the nation to victory in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], raised [[protective tariff]]s to promote American industry and kept the nation on the [[gold standard]] in a rejection of [[free silver]] (effectively, expansionary [[monetary policy]]).\n\nMcKinley was the last president to have served in the [[American Civil War]] and the only one to have started the war as an [[enlisted soldier]], beginning as a private in the [[Union Army]] and ending as a [[brevet (military)|brevet]] major. After the war, he settled in [[Canton, Ohio]], where he practiced law and married [[Ida Saxton]]. In 1876, he was elected to [[United States Congress|Congress]], where he became the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s expert on the [[protective tariff]], which he promised would bring prosperity. His 1890 [[McKinley Tariff]] was highly controversial, which together with a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] redistricting aimed at [[gerrymandering]] him out of office led to his defeat in the [[1890 United States House of Representatives elections|Democratic landslide of 1890]]. He was elected [[governor of Ohio]] in 1891 and 1893, steering a moderate course between capital and labor interests. With the aid of his close adviser [[Mark Hanna]], he [[William McKinley 1896 presidential campaign|secured the Republican nomination for president in 1896]] amid a deep economic depression. He defeated his Democratic rival [[William Jennings Bryan]] after a [[front porch campaign]] in which he advocated \"[[sound money]]\" (the gold standard unless altered by international agreement) and promised that high tariffs would restore prosperity.\n\nRapid economic growth marked McKinley's presidency. He promoted the 1897 [[Dingley Tariff]] to protect manufacturers and factory workers from foreign competition and in 1900 secured the passage of the [[Gold Standard Act]]. McKinley hoped to persuade Spain to grant independence to rebellious [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Cuba]] without conflict, but when negotiation failed he led the nation into the Spanish-American War of 1898. The United States victory was quick and decisive. As part of [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|the peace settlement]], Spain turned over to the United States its main overseas colonies of [[Puerto Rico]], [[Guam]] and the [[United States Military Government of the Philippine Islands|Philippines]] while [[United States Military Government in Cuba|Cuba]] was promised independence, but at that time remained under the control of the United States Army. The United States [[Annexation of Hawaii|annexed]] the independent [[Republic of Hawaii]] in 1898 and it became a [[Territory of Hawaii|United States territory]].\n\nHistorians regard McKinley's 1896 victory as a [[realigning election]] in which [[Third Party System|the political stalemate]] of the post-Civil War era gave way to the Republican-dominated [[Fourth Party System]], which began with the [[Progressive Era]]. McKinley defeated Bryan again in the [[1900 United States presidential election|1900 presidential election]] in a campaign focused on [[imperialism]], [[protectionism]] and free silver. His legacy was suddenly cut short when he was shot on September 6, 1901 by [[Leon Czolgosz]], a second-generation [[Polish-American]] with [[Anarchism in the United States|anarchist]] leanings. McKinley died eight days later and was succeeded by his Vice President [[Theodore Roosevelt]].

McKinley biographer [[Margaret Leech]] noted that Canton had become prosperous as a center for the manufacture of farm equipment because of [[protectionism|protection]], and that this may have helped form his political views. McKinley introduced and supported bills that raised protective tariffs, and opposed those that lowered them or imposed tariffs simply to raise revenue.{{sfnm|Leech||1pp=36\u201337|Phillips||2pp=42\u201344}} Garfield's election as president in 1880 created a vacancy on the [[House Ways and Means Committee]]; McKinley was selected to fill it, placing him on the most powerful committee after only two terms.{{sfn|Morgan|p=55}}\n\nMcKinley increasingly became a significant figure in national politics.

Hanna, once he entered public affairs as a political manager and generous contributor, supported Sherman's ambitions, as well as those of Foraker. The latter relationship broke off at the [[1888 Republican National Convention]], where McKinley, Foraker, and Hanna were all delegates supporting Sherman. Convinced Sherman could not win, Foraker threw his support to the unsuccessful Republican 1884 presidential nominee, [[Maine]] Senator [[James G. Blaine]]. When Blaine stated he was not a candidate, Foraker returned to Sherman, but the nomination went to former [[Indiana]] senator [[Benjamin Harrison]], who was elected president. In the bitterness that followed the convention, Hanna abandoned Foraker, and for the rest of McKinley's life, the Ohio Republican Party was divided into two factions, one aligned with McKinley, Sherman, and Hanna and the other with Foraker.{{sfn|Horner|pp=59\u201360, 72\u201378}} Hanna came to admire McKinley and became a friend and close adviser to him.

The Democrats again redistricted Stark County for the 1884 election; McKinley was returned to Congress anyway.{{sfn|Morgan|pp=60\u201362}}\n\n[[File:Judge cover September 1890 - On to Ohio.png|thumb|''Judge'' magazine cover from September 1890, showing McKinley (left) having helped dispatch Speaker Reed's opponent in early-voting Maine, hurrying off with the victor to McKinley's \"gerrymandered\" Ohio district]]\nFor 1890, the Democrats gerrymandered McKinley one final time, placing Stark County in the same district as one of the strongest pro-Democrat counties, [[Holmes County, Ohio|Holmes]], populated by solidly Democratic [[Pennsylvania Dutch]]. The new boundaries seemed good, based on past results, for a Democratic majority of 2000 to 3000. The Republicans could not reverse the gerrymander as legislative elections would not be held until 1891, but they could throw all their energies into the district, as the McKinley Tariff was a main theme of the Democratic campaign nationwide, and there was considerable attention paid to McKinley's race. The Republican Party sent its leading orators to Canton, including Blaine (then [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]), Speaker Reed and President Harrison. The Democrats countered with their best spokesmen on tariff issues.{{sfn|Jensen|pp=150\u201351}} McKinley tirelessly stumped his new district, reaching out to its 40,000 voters to explain that his tariff\n\n{{quote |\nwas framed for the people&nbsp;... as a defense to their industries, as a protection to the labor of their hands, as a safeguard to the happy homes of American workingmen, and as a security to their education, their wages, and their investments&nbsp;... It will bring to this country a prosperity unparalleled in our own history and unrivalled in the history of the world.\"{{sfn|McKinley|p=464}}\n}}\n\nDemocrats ran a strong candidate in former lieutenant governor [[John G. Warwick]]. To drive their point home, they hired young partisans to pretend to be peddlers, who went door to door offering 25-cent tinware to housewives for 50 cents, explaining the rise in prices was due to the McKinley Tariff. In the end, McKinley lost by 300 votes, but the Republicans won a statewide majority and claimed a moral victory.{{sfn|Jensen|pp=151\u201353}}\n\n===Governor of Ohio (1892\u20131896)===\nEven before McKinley completed his term in Congress, he met with a delegation of Ohioans urging him to run for governor. Governor [[James E. Campbell]], a Democrat, who had defeated [[Joseph B. Foraker|Foraker]] in 1889, was to seek re-election in 1891. The Ohio Republican party remained divided, but McKinley quietly arranged for Foraker to nominate him at the 1891 state Republican convention, which chose McKinley by acclamation. The former congressman spent much of the second half of 1891 campaigning against Campbell, beginning in his birthplace of Niles. Hanna, however, was little seen in the campaign; he spent much of his time raising funds for the election of legislators pledged to vote for Sherman in the 1892 senatorial election.{{sfn|Horner|p=46}}{{sfn|Morgan|pp=117\u201319}}{{efn|name=Seventeenth Amendment}} McKinley won the 1891 election by some 20,000 votes;{{sfn|Williams|p=50}} the following January, Sherman, with considerable assistance from Hanna, turned back a challenge by Foraker to win the legislature's vote for another term in the Senate.{{sfn|Horner|pp=86\u201387}}\n\n[[File:Blaine breaks out.png|right|thumb|Even after his final run for president in 1884, [[James G. Blaine]] was still seen as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination. In this 1890 ''Puck'' cartoon, he is startling Reed and McKinley (right) as they make their plans for 1892.]]\n\nOhio's governor had relatively little power\u2014for example, he could recommend legislation, but not veto it\u2014but with Ohio a key [[swing state]], its governor was a major figure in national politics.{{sfn|Williams|p=117}} Although McKinley believed that the health of the nation depended on that of business, he was evenhanded in dealing with labor.{{sfn|Gould|p=7}} He procured legislation that set up an arbitration board to settle work disputes and obtained passage of a law that fined employers who fired workers for belonging to a union.{{sfn|Williams|p=122}}\n\n[[Benjamin Harrison|President Harrison]] had proven unpopular; there were divisions even within the Republican party as the year 1892 began and Harrison began his re-election drive. Although no declared Republican candidate opposed Harrison, many Republicans were ready to dump the President from the ticket if an alternative emerged. Among the possible candidates spoken of were McKinley, Reed, and the aging Blaine. Fearing that the Ohio governor would emerge as a candidate, Harrison's managers arranged for McKinley to be permanent chairman of [[1892 Republican National Convention|the convention]] in [[Minneapolis]], requiring him to play a public, neutral role. Hanna established an unofficial McKinley headquarters near the convention hall, though no active effort was made to convert delegates to McKinley's cause. McKinley objected to delegate votes being cast for him; nevertheless he finished third, behind the renominated Harrison, and behind Blaine, who had sent word he did not want to be considered.{{sfn|Horner|pp=92\u201396}} Although McKinley campaigned loyally for the Republican ticket, Harrison was defeated by former President Cleveland in [[1892 United States presidential election|the November election]]. In the wake of Cleveland's victory, McKinley was seen by some as the likely Republican candidate in 1896.{{sfn|Morgan|pp=128\u201329}}\n\nSoon after Cleveland's return to office, hard times struck the nation with the [[Panic of 1893]]. A businessman in [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]], Robert Walker, had lent money to McKinley in their younger days; in gratitude, McKinley had often guaranteed Walker's borrowings for his business. The governor had never kept track of what he was signing; he believed Walker a sound businessman. In fact, Walker had deceived McKinley, telling him that new notes were actually renewals of matured ones. Walker was ruined by the recession; McKinley was called upon for repayment in February 1893.{{sfn|Morgan|pp=129\u201330}} The total owed was over $100,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|.1|1893|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}) and a despairing McKinley initially proposed to resign as governor and earn the money as an attorney.{{sfn|Morgan|pp=130\u201334}} Instead, McKinley's wealthy supporters, including Hanna and Chicago publisher [[H. H. Kohlsaat]], became trustees of a fund from which the notes would be paid. Both William and Ida McKinley placed their property in the hands of the fund's trustees (who included Hanna and Kohlsaat), and the supporters raised and contributed a substantial sum of money. All of the couple's property was returned to them by the end of 1893, and when McKinley, who had promised eventual repayment, asked for the list of contributors, it was refused him. Many people who had suffered in the hard times sympathized with McKinley, whose popularity grew.{{sfn|Morgan|pp=130\u201334}} He was easily re-elected in November 1893, receiving the largest percentage of the vote of any Ohio governor since the Civil War.{{sfn|Phillips|p=67}}\n\nMcKinley campaigned widely for Republicans in the 1894 midterm congressional elections; many party candidates in districts where he spoke were successful. His political efforts in Ohio were rewarded with the election in November 1895 of a Republican successor as governor, [[Asa S. Bushnell (Governor)|Asa Bushnell]], and a Republican legislature that elected Foraker to the Senate. McKinley supported Foraker for Senate and Bushnell (who was of Foraker's faction) for governor; in return, the new senator-elect agreed to back McKinley's presidential ambitions. With party peace in Ohio assured, McKinley turned to the national arena.{{sfn|Phillips|pp=69\u201370}}\n\n==Election of 1896==\n{{Further|1896 United States presidential election|William McKinley 1896 presidential campaign}}\n\n===Obtaining the nomination===\n[[File:Mark Hanna by WJ Root, 1896 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|McKinley's close friend and adviser, [[Mark Hanna]]]]\nIt is unclear when William McKinley began to seriously prepare a run for president. As Phillips notes, \"no documents, no diaries, no confidential letters to Mark Hanna (or anyone else) contain his secret hopes or veiled stratagems.\"{{sfn|Phillips|p=61}} From the beginning, McKinley's preparations had the participation of Hanna, whose biographer William T. Horner noted, \"what is certainly true is that in 1888 the two men began to develop a close working relationship that helped put McKinley in the White House.\"{{sfn|Horner|p=81}} Sherman did not run for president again after 1888, and so Hanna could support McKinley's ambitions for that office wholeheartedly.{{sfn|Horner|p=92}}\n\nBacked by Hanna's money and organizational skills, McKinley quietly built support for a presidential bid through 1895 and early 1896. When other contenders such as Speaker Reed and [[Iowa]] Senator [[William B. Allison]] sent agents outside their states to organize Republicans in support of their candidacies, they found that Hanna's agents had preceded them. According to historian Stanley Jones in his study of the 1896 election,\n\n{{quote |\nAnother feature common to the Reed and Allison campaigns was their failure to make headway against the tide which was running toward McKinley. In fact, both campaigns from the moment they were launched were in retreat. The calm confidence with which each candidate claimed the support of his own section [of the country] soon gave way to&nbsp;... bitter accusations that Hanna by winning support for McKinley in their sections had violated the rules of the game.{{sfn|Jones|p=103}}\n}}\n\nHanna, on McKinley's behalf, met with the eastern Republican [[political boss]]es, such as Senators [[Thomas C. Platt|Thomas Platt]] of New York and [[Matthew Quay]] of Pennsylvania, who were willing to guarantee McKinley's nomination in exchange for promises regarding patronage and offices. McKinley, however, was determined to obtain the nomination without making deals, and Hanna accepted that decision.{{sfn|Jones|p=105}} Many of their early efforts were focused on the South; Hanna obtained a vacation home in southern Georgia where McKinley visited and met with Republican politicians from the region. McKinley needed 453\u00bd delegate votes to gain the nomination; he gained nearly half that number from the South and [[border states (American Civil War)|border states]]. Platt lamented in his memoirs, \"[Hanna] had the South practically solid before some of us awakened.\"{{sfn|Williams|p=57}}\n\n[[File:Coronation of McKinley.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|[[Louis Dalrymple]] cartoon from [[Puck (magazine)|''Puck'' magazine]], June 24, 1896, showing McKinley about to crown himself with the Republican nomination.

Morton]], and Illinois Senator [[Shelby Cullom]]. Delegate-rich Illinois proved a crucial battleground, as McKinley supporters, such as Chicago businessman (and future vice president) [[Charles G. Dawes]], sought to elect delegates pledged to vote for McKinley at the national convention in St. Louis. Cullom proved unable to stand against McKinley despite the support of local Republican machines; at the state convention at the end of April, McKinley completed a near-sweep of Illinois' delegates.{{sfn|Jones|pp=119\u201325}} Former president Harrison had been deemed a possible contender if he entered the race; when Harrison made it known he would not seek a third nomination, the McKinley organization took control of Indiana with a speed Harrison privately found unseemly. Morton operatives who journeyed to Indiana sent word back that they had found the state alive for McKinley.{{sfn|Jones|pp=117\u201319}} Wyoming Senator [[Francis Warren]] wrote, \"The politicians are making a hard fight against him, but if the masses could speak, McKinley is the choice of at least 75% of the entire [body of] Republican voters in the Union\".{{sfn|Phillips|pp=71\u201372}}\n\nBy the time the national convention began in [[St. Louis]] on June 16, 1896, McKinley had an ample majority of delegates. The former governor, who remained in Canton, followed events at the convention closely by telephone, and was able to hear part of Foraker's speech nominating him over the line. When Ohio was reached in the roll call of states, its votes gave McKinley the nomination, which he celebrated by hugging his wife and mother as his friends fled the house, anticipating the first of many crowds that gathered at the Republican candidate's home. Thousands of partisans came from Canton and surrounding towns that evening to hear McKinley speak from his front porch<!-- I want to save the link to \"front porch campaign\" for the next section -->. The convention nominated Republican National Committee vice chairman [[Garret Hobart]] of New Jersey for vice president, a choice actually made, by most accounts, by Hanna. Hobart, a wealthy lawyer, businessman, and former state legislator, was not widely known, but as Hanna biographer [[Herbert Croly]] pointed out, \"if he did little to strengthen the ticket he did nothing to weaken it\".{{sfn|Horner|pp=159\u201362}}{{sfn|Williams|p=59}}\n\n===General election campaign===\n{{for|additional information on the currency question|Cross of Gold speech#Background}}\n[[File:McKinley straddle.jpg|thumb|left|Before the 1896 convention, McKinley tried to avoid coming down on one side or the other of the currency question.

The man's weight is bending the wood rather dramatically.]]\n\nBefore the Republican convention, McKinley had been a \"straddle bug\" on the currency question, favoring moderate positions on silver such as accomplishing [[bimetallism]] by international agreement. In the final days before the convention, McKinley decided, after hearing from politicians and businessmen, that the platform should endorse the gold standard, though it should allow for bimetallism through in coordination with other nations. Adoption of the platform caused some western delegates, led by Colorado Senator [[Henry M. Teller]], to walk out of the convention. However, compared with the Democrats, Republican divisions on the issue were small, especially as McKinley promised future concessions to silver advocates.{{sfn|Phillips|pp=52, 81\u201382}}{{sfn|Cherny|pp=55\u201356}}{{sfn|Jones|p=177}}\n\nThe bad economic times had continued, and strengthened the hand of forces for [[free silver]]. The issue bitterly divided the Democratic Party; President Cleveland firmly supported the gold standard, but an increasing number of rural Democrats wanted silver, especially in the South and West. The silverites took control of the [[1896 Democratic National Convention]] and chose [[William Jennings Bryan]] for president; he had electrified the delegates with his [[Cross of Gold speech]]. Bryan's financial radicalism shocked bankers\u2014they thought his inflationary program would bankrupt the railroads and ruin the economy. Hanna approached them for support for his strategy to win the election, and they gave $3.5&nbsp;million for speakers and over 200&nbsp;million pamphlets advocating the Republican position on the money and tariff questions.{{sfn|Gould|pp=10\u201311}}{{sfn|Leech|pp=85\u201387}}\n\n{{listen\n| filename = William McKinley campaign speech 1896.ogg\n| title = McKinley speaks from his front porch\n| description = Historic recording of William McKinley.

With his eloquence and youthful energy his major assets in the race, Bryan decided on a [[Whistle stop train tour|whistle-stop]] political tour by train on an unprecedented scale. Hanna urged McKinley to match Bryan's tour with one of his own; the candidate declined on the grounds that the Democrat was a better stump speaker: \"I might just as well set up a trapeze on my front lawn and compete with some professional athlete as go out speaking against Bryan. I have to ''think''<!-- italics in original --> when I speak.\"{{sfn|Williams|pp=130\u201331}} Instead of going to the people, McKinley would remain at home in Canton and allow the people to come to him; according to historian R.

McKinley's '[[Front Porch Campaign]]' became a legend in American political history.\"{{sfn|Williams|pp=130\u201331}}\n\n[[File:Flower delegation.jpg|thumb|left|William and Ida McKinley (to her husband's left) pose with members of the \"Flower Delegation\" from [[Oil City, Pennsylvania]], before the McKinley home.

The candidate then responded, speaking on campaign issues in a speech molded to suit the interest of the delegation. The speeches were carefully scripted to avoid extemporaneous remarks; even the spokesman's remarks were approved by McKinley or a representative. This was done as the candidate feared an offhand comment by another that might rebound on him, as [[1884 United States presidential election#Campaign|had happened to Blaine in 1884]].{{sfn|Leech|pp=88\u201389}}{{sfn|Williams|pp=131, 226}}{{sfn|Jones|p=285}}\n\n[[File:Man of Mark.png|thumb|right|upright|''A Man of Mark'' 1896 [[Homer Davenport]] cartoon of McKinley as Hanna's creature, from [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s New York ''Journal''|alt=A political cartoon.

McKinley won the entire Northeast and Midwest; he won 51% of the vote and an ample majority in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]. Bryan had concentrated entirely on the silver issue, and had not appealed to urban workers.

Charles Dawes, who had been Hanna's lieutenant in Chicago during the campaign, was considered for the Treasury post but by some accounts Dawes considered himself too young. Dawes eventually became [[Comptroller of the Currency]]; he recorded in his published diary that he had strongly urged McKinley to appoint as secretary the successful candidate, [[Lyman J.

The new republic, dominated by business interests, [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|had overthrown the Queen in 1893 when she rejected a limited role for herself]].{{sfn|Gould|p=48}} There was strong American support for annexation, and the need for Pacific bases in wartime became clear after the Battle of Manila.{{sfn|Gould|pp=49\u201350}} McKinley came to office as a supporter of annexation, and lobbied Congress to act, warning that to do nothing would invite a royalist counter-revolution or a Japanese takeover.{{sfn|Gould|pp=49\u201350}} Foreseeing difficulty in getting two-thirds of the Senate to approve a treaty of annexation, McKinley instead supported the effort of Democratic Representative [[Francis G.

It is [[manifest destiny]].\"{{sfn|Morgan|p=225}}\n\n===Expanding influence overseas===\nEven before peace negotiations began with Spain, McKinley asked Congress to set up a commission to examine trade opportunities in Asia and espoused an \"[[Open Door Policy]]\", in which all nations would freely trade with China and none would seek to violate that nation's territorial integrity.{{sfn|Gould|p=201}}\n\n[[File:Siege of Peking, Boxer Rebellion.jpg|thumb|left|alt=painting of U.S. Army soldiers defending a fort in Peking while a zhengyangmen in the background burns|American soldiers scale the walls of Beijing to relieve the [[Siege of the International Legations]], August 1900]]\n\nAmerican missionaries were threatened with death when the [[Boxer Rebellion]] menaced foreigners in China.{{sfn|Gould|pp=220\u201322}} Americans and other westerners in [[Peking]] were besieged and, in cooperation with other western powers, McKinley ordered 5000 troops to the city in June 1900 in the [[China Relief Expedition]].{{sfn|Lafeber|p=714}} The westerners were rescued the next month, but several Congressional Democrats objected to McKinley dispatching troops without consulting the legislature.{{sfn|Gould|pp=220\u201322}} McKinley's actions set a precedent that led to most of his successors exerting similar independent control over the military.{{sfn|Lafeber|p=714}} After the rebellion ended, the United States reaffirmed its commitment to the Open Door policy, which became the basis of American policy toward China.{{sfn|Gould|p=233}}\n\nCloser to home, McKinley and Hay engaged in negotiations with Britain over the possible construction of a canal across Central America. The [[Clayton\u2013Bulwer Treaty]], which the two nations signed in 1850, prohibited either from establishing exclusive control over a canal there. The war had exposed the difficulty of maintaining a two-ocean navy without a connection closer than [[Cape Horn]].{{sfn|Gould|pp=196\u201398}} Now, with American business and military interests even more involved in Asia, a canal seemed more essential than ever, and McKinley pressed for a renegotiation of the treaty.{{sfn|Gould|pp=196\u201398}} Hay and the British ambassador, [[Julian Pauncefote, 1st Baron Pauncefote|Julian Pauncefote]], agreed that the United States could control a future canal, provided that it was open to all shipping and not fortified.{{sfn|McCullough|pp=256\u201359}} McKinley was satisfied with the terms, but the Senate rejected them, demanding that the United States be allowed to fortify the canal.{{sfn|McCullough|pp=256\u201359}} Hay was embarrassed by the rebuff and offered his resignation, but McKinley refused it and ordered him to continue negotiations to achieve the Senate's demands.{{sfn|McCullough|pp=256\u201359}} He was successful, and [[Hay\u2013Pauncefote Treaty|a new treaty]] was drafted and approved, but not before McKinley's assassination in 1901.{{sfn|McCullough|pp=256\u201359}}\n\n===Tariffs and bimetallism===\n[[File:McKinley Prosperity.jpg|thumb|upright|1900 reelection poster celebrates McKinley standing tall on the gold standard with support from soldiers, sailors, businessmen, factory workers and professionals.]]\n\nMcKinley had built his reputation in Congress on high tariffs, promising protection for American business and well-paid American factory workers. With the Republicans in control of Congress, Ways and Means chairman Dingley introduced the [[Dingley Act]] which would raise rates on wool, sugar, and luxury goods. McKinley supported it and it became law.{{sfn|Gould|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nAmerican negotiators soon concluded a reciprocity treaty with France, and the two nations approached Britain to gauge British enthusiasm for [[bimetallism]].{{sfn|Gould|pp=44\u201345}} The Prime Minister, [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], and his government showed some interest in the idea and told the American envoy, [[Edward O. Wolcott]], that he would be amenable to reopening the mints in [[India]] to silver coinage if the [[Viceroy's Executive Council]] there agreed.{{sfn|Gould|pp=45\u201346}} News of a possible departure from the gold standard stirred up immediate opposition from its partisans, and misgivings by the Indian administration led Britain to reject the proposal.{{sfn|Gould|pp=45\u201346}} With the international effort a failure, McKinley turned away from silver coinage and embraced the gold standard.{{sfn|Morgan|pp=217\u201318}} Even without the agreement, agitation for free silver eased as prosperity began to return to the United States and gold from recent strikes in the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Yukon]] and [[Australian gold rushes|Australia]] increased the monetary supply even without silver coinage.{{sfnm|Nichols||1p=586|Gould||2p=46}} In the absence of international agreement, McKinley favored legislation to formally affirm the gold standard, but was initially deterred by the silver strength in the Senate.{{sfn|Morgan|pp=218\u201319}} By 1900, with another campaign ahead and good economic conditions, McKinley urged Congress to pass such a law, and was able to sign the [[Gold Standard Act]] on March 14, 1900, using a gold pen to do so.{{sfn|Gould|pp=169\u201371}}\n\n===Civil rights===\n[[File:McKinley at Atlanta.jpg|thumb|left|McKinley, (right of center) flanked by Georgia Governor [[Allen D.

McKinley had spoken out against [[lynching]] while governor, and most African Americans who could vote supported him in 1896. McKinley's priority, however, was in ending [[sectionalism]], and they were disappointed by his policies and appointments. Although McKinley made some appointments of African Americans to low-level government posts, and received some praise for that, the appointments were less than they had received under previous Republican administrations. [[Blanche Bruce|Blanche K. Bruce]], an African American who during [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]] had served as senator from [[Mississippi]], received the post of register at the Treasury Department; this post was traditionally given to an African American by Republican presidents. McKinley appointed several black postmasters; however, when Democrats protested the appointment of Justin W. Lyons as postmaster of [[Augusta, Georgia]], McKinley asked Lyons to withdraw (he was subsequently given the post of Treasury register after Bruce's death in 1898).{{sfn|Gould|pp=153\u201354}} The President did appoint George B. Jackson, a former slave, to the post of customs collector in [[Presidio, Texas]].{{sfn|Louisiana Historical Assoc, ''Cohen''}} However, African Americans in northern states felt that their contributions to McKinley's victory were overlooked; few were appointed to office.{{sfn|Gould|pp=153\u201354}}\n\nThe administration's response to racial violence was minimal, causing him to lose black support.{{sfn|Gould|pp=153\u201354}} When black postmasters at [[Hogansville, Georgia]] in 1897, and at [[Lake City, South Carolina]] the following year, were assaulted, McKinley issued no statement of condemnation. Although black leaders criticized McKinley for inaction, supporters responded by saying there was little the president could do to intervene. Critics replied by saying that he could at least publicly condemn such events, as Harrison had done.{{sfn|Gould|p=155}}\n\nAccording to historian Clarance A. Bacote, \"Before the Spanish\u2013American War, the Negroes, in spite of some mistakes, regarded McKinley as the best friend they ever had.\"{{sfn|Bacote|p=234}} Under pressure from black leaders, McKinley required the War Department to commission black officers above the rank of lieutenant. McKinley toured the South in late 1898, promoting sectional reconciliation. He visited [[Tuskegee Institute]] and black educator [[Booker T. Washington]]. He also visited Confederate memorials. In his tour of the South, McKinley did not mention the racial tensions or violence. Although the President received a rapturous reception from Southern whites, many African Americans, excluded from official welcoming committees, felt alienated by the President's words and actions.{{sfn|Gould|pp=156\u201357}}{{sfnm|Bacote||1pp=235\u201337|Leech||2p=348}} Gould concluded regarding race, \"McKinley lacked the vision to transcend the biases of his day and to point toward a better future for all Americans\".{{sfnm|Gould||1pp=159\u201360|Phillips||2p=149}}\n\n===1900 election===\n{{Main|1900 United States presidential election}}\n[[File:The Administration's Promises Have Been Kept.jpg|thumb|McKinley ran on his record of prosperity and victory in 1900, winning easy re-election over [[William Jennings Bryan|Bryan]].]]\n\nRepublicans were generally successful in state and local elections around the country in 1899, and McKinley was optimistic about his chances at re-election in 1900.{{sfn|Gould|pp=207\u201308}} McKinley's popularity in his first term assured him of renomination for a second.{{sfn|Gould|pp=213\u201314}} The only question about the Republican ticket concerned the vice presidential nomination; McKinley needed a new running mate as Hobart had died in late 1899.{{sfn|Gould|pp=215\u201317}} McKinley initially favored [[Elihu Root]], who had succeeded Alger as Secretary of War, but McKinley decided that Root was doing too good a job at the War Department to move him.{{sfn|Gould|pp=215\u201317}} He considered other prominent candidates, including Allison and [[Cornelius Newton Bliss|Cornelius N. Bliss]], but none were as popular as the Republican party's rising star, [[Theodore Roosevelt]].{{sfn|Phillips|pp=120\u201322}} After a stint as [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]], Roosevelt had resigned and raised [[Rough Riders|a cavalry regiment]]; they fought bravely in Cuba, and Roosevelt returned home covered in glory. Elected governor of New York on a reform platform in 1898, Roosevelt had his eye on the presidency.{{sfn|Gould|pp=215\u201317}} Many supporters recommended him to McKinley for the second spot on the ticket, and Roosevelt believed it would be an excellent stepping stone to the presidency in 1904.{{sfn|Gould|pp=215\u201317}} McKinley remained uncommitted in public, but Hanna was firmly opposed to the New York governor.{{sfn|Leech|pp=531\u201333}} The Ohio senator considered the New Yorker overly impulsive; his stance was undermined by the efforts of [[political boss]] and New York Senator [[Thomas C.

After his failure to get close enough on the fifth, Czolgosz waited the next day at the [[Temple of Music]] on the Exposition grounds, where the President was to meet the public. Czolgosz concealed his gun in a handkerchief, and, when he reached the head of the line, shot McKinley twice in the abdomen.{{sfn|Miller|pp=300\u201301}}\n\nMcKinley urged his aides to break the news gently to Ida, and to call off the mob that had set on Czolgosz\u2014a request that may have saved his assassin's life.{{sfn|Miller|pp=301\u201302}} McKinley was taken to the Exposition aid station, where the doctor was unable to locate the second bullet.

Czolgosz, put on trial for murder nine days after McKinley's death, was found guilty, sentenced to death on September 26, and executed by [[electric chair]] on October 29, 1901.{{sfn|Miller|pp=321\u201330}}\n\n==Funeral, memorials, and legacy==\n===Funeral and resting place===\n[[File:President McKinley's funeral, 1901. 4134s1.webmsd.webm|thumb|upright=0.9|President McKinley's funeral, 1901, part 1]]\n[[File:President McKinley's funeral, 1901. 4134s2.webmsd.webm|thumb|upright=0.9|President McKinley's funeral, 1901, part 2]]\n[[File:President McKinley's funeral, 1901. 4134s3.webmsd.webm|thumb|upright=0.9|President McKinley's funeral, 1901, part 3]]\n\nAccording to Gould, \"The nation experienced a wave of genuine grief at the news of McKinley's passing.\"{{sfn|Gould|p=252}} The stock market, faced with sudden uncertainty, suffered a steep decline\u2014almost unnoticed in the mourning. The nation focused its attention on the casket that made its way by train, first to Washington, where it first lay in the [[East Room]] of the Executive Mansion, and then [[Lying in state#United States|in state]] in the Capitol, and then was taken to Canton.{{sfn|Morgan|pp=402\u201303}} A hundred thousand people passed by the open casket in the [[Capitol Rotunda]], many having waited hours in the rain; in Canton, an equal number did the same at the Stark County Courthouse on September 18. The following day, a funeral service was held at the First Methodist Church; the casket was then sealed and taken to the McKinley house, where relatives paid their final respects.{{sfn|McElroy|p=167}} It was then transported to the receiving vault at [[West Lawn Cemetery]] in Canton, to await the construction of the memorial to McKinley already being planned.{{sfn|Morgan|p=403}}\n\nThere was a widespread expectation that Ida McKinley would not long survive her husband; one family friend stated, as William McKinley lay dying, that they should be prepared for a double funeral.{{sfn|Miller|p=348}} This did not occur; the former first lady accompanied her husband on the funeral train. Leech noted \"the circuitous journey was a cruel ordeal for the woman who huddled in a compartment of the funeral train, praying that the Lord would take her with her Dearest Love\".{{sfn|Leech|p=602}} She was thought too weak to attend the services in Washington or Canton, although she listened at the door to the service for her husband in her house on North Market Street. She remained in Canton for the remainder of her life, setting up a shrine in her house, and often visiting the receiving vault, until her death at age 59 on May 26, 1907.{{sfn|Miller|p=348}} She died only months before the completion of [[McKinley National Memorial|the large marble monument]] to her husband in Canton, which was dedicated by President Roosevelt on September 30, 1907. William and Ida McKinley are interred there with their daughters, atop a hillside overlooking the city of Canton.{{sfnm|McElroy||1pp=189\u201393|Morgan||2p=406}}\n\n===Other memorials===\nIn addition to the Canton site there are many memorials to McKinley. There is the ''[[William McKinley Monument]]'' in front of the [[Ohio Statehouse]] in Columbus, Ohio and [[National McKinley Birthplace Memorial|a monument at his birthplace]] in Niles; 20&nbsp;Ohio schools bear his name.{{sfn|McElroy|p=189}} There are several schools in the United States named [[McKinley School (disambiguation)|McKinley School]]. Nearly a million dollars was pledged by contributors or allocated from public funds for the construction of McKinley memorials in the year after his death.{{sfn|Olcott|p=388}} Phillips suggests the significant number of major memorials to McKinley in Ohio reflected the expectation among Ohioans in the years after McKinley's death that he would be ranked among the great presidents.{{sfn|Phillips|p=161}}\n\nStatues to him may be found in more than a dozen states; his name has been bestowed on streets, civic organizations, and libraries. In 1896, a gold prospector gave McKinley's name to [[Denali]], the tallest mountain in North America at {{convert|20310|ft}}. The Alaska Board of Geographic Names changed the name of the mountain back to Denali in 1975, which is what it was called by locals. The [[Department of the Interior]] followed suit in August 2015 as a part of a visit to Alaska by President [[Barack Obama]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hirschfeld Davis|first1=Julie|title=Mount McKinley Will Be Renamed Denali|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/31/us/mount-mckinley-will-be-renamed-denali.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur&_r=0|website=The New York Times |accessdate=August 30, 2015}}</ref> Similarly, [[Denali National Park]] was known as Mount McKinley National Park until December 2, 1980, when it was changed by legislation signed by President [[Jimmy Carter]].{{sfn|McElroy|p=189}}\n\n===Legacy and historical image===\n[[File:Harriet Anderson Stubbs Murphy - William McKinley - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|The official Presidential portrait of William McKinley, by [[Harriet Anderson Stubbs Murphy]].]]\n\nMcKinley's biographer, H. Wayne Morgan remarks that McKinley died the most beloved president in history.{{sfn|Morgan|p=404}} However, the young, enthusiastic Roosevelt quickly captured public attention after his predecessor's death. The new president made little effort to secure the trade reciprocity McKinley had intended to negotiate with other nations. Controversy and public interest surrounded Roosevelt throughout the seven and a half years of his presidency as memories of McKinley faded; by 1920, according to Gould, McKinley's administration was deemed no more than \"a mediocre prelude to the vigor and energy of Theodore Roosevelt's\".{{sfn|Gould|p=252}} Beginning in the 1950s, McKinley received more favorable evaluations; nevertheless, in surveys ranking American presidents, he has generally been placed near the middle, often trailing contemporaries such as Hayes and Cleveland.{{sfn|Gould|p=252}} Morgan suggests that this relatively low ranking is due to a perception among historians that while many decisions during McKinley's presidency profoundly affected the nation's future, he more followed public opinion than led it, and that McKinley's standing has suffered from altered public expectations of the presidency.{{sfn|Morgan|p=472}}\n\nThere has been broad agreement among historians that McKinley's election was at the time of a transition between two political eras, dubbed the [[Third Party System|Third]] and [[Fourth Party System]]s.{{sfn|Nice|p=448}} Kenneth F. Warren emphasizes the national commitment to a pro-business, industrial, and modernizing program, represented by McKinley.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kenneth F.

Klinghard argued that McKinley's personal control of the 1896 campaign gave him the opportunity to reshape the presidency\u2014rather than simply follow the party platform\u2014by representing himself as the voice of the people.{{sfn|Klinghard|pp=736\u201360}} Republican [[Karl Rove]] exalted McKinley as the model for a sweeping political realignment behind George W. Bush in the 2000s{{sfn|Rove}}\u2014a realignment that did not happen. Some political scientists, such as David Mayhew, questioned whether the 1896 election truly represented a realignment, thereby placing in issue whether McKinley deserves credit for it.{{sfn|Rauchway|pp=242\u201344}} Historian Michael J. Korzi argued in 2005 that while it is tempting to see McKinley as the key figure in the transition from congressional domination of government to the modern, powerful president, this change was an incremental process through the late 19th and early 20th centuries.{{sfn|Korzi|p=281}}\n\nPhillips writes that McKinley's low rating is undeserved, and that he should be ranked just after the great presidents such as Washington and Lincoln. He pointed to McKinley's success at building an electoral coalition that kept the Republicans mostly in power for a generation.{{sfn|Phillips|pp=156\u201357}} Phillips believes that part of McKinley's legacy is the men he included in his administration, who dominated the Republican Party for a quarter century after his death. These officials included Cortelyou, who served in three Cabinet positions under Roosevelt, and Dawes, who became vice president under [[Calvin Coolidge|Coolidge]]. Other McKinley appointees who later became major figures include Day, whom Roosevelt elevated to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] where he remained nearly twenty years, and [[William Howard Taft]], whom McKinley had made [[Governor-General of the Philippines]] and who succeeded Roosevelt as president.{{sfn|Phillips|pp=163\u201364}} After the assassination, the present [[United States Secret Service]] came into existence, when the [[United States Congress|Congress]] deemed it necessary, that presidential protection be part of its duties.<ref>[[United States Secret Service]]\n[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-president-william-mckinleys-assassination-led-modern-secret-service-180964868/]</ref>\n\nA controversial aspect of McKinley's presidency is territorial expansion and the question of imperialism\u2014with the exception of the Philippines, granted independence in 1946, the United States retains the territories taken under McKinley.{{sfn|Phillips|p=154}} The territorial expansion of 1898 is often seen by historians as the beginning of [[American imperialism|American empire]].{{sfn|Phillips|p=99}} Morgan sees that historical discussion as a subset of the debate over the rise of America as a world power; he expects the debate over McKinley's actions to continue indefinitely without resolution, and notes that however one judges McKinley's actions in American expansion, one of his motivations was to change the lives of Filipinos and Cubans for the better.{{sfn|Morgan|p=468}}\n\nMorgan alludes to the rise of interest in McKinley as part of the debate over the more assertive American foreign policy of recent decades:{{quote|McKinley was a major actor in some of the most important events in American history. His decisions shaped future policies and public attitudes. He usually rises in the estimation of scholars who study his life in detail. Even those who disagree with his policies and decisions see him as an active, responsible, informed participant in charge of decision making. His dignified demeanor and subtle operations keep him somewhat remote from public perception.

He was able to run 101 miles in 19 hours and 6 minutes\u2014despite never having attempted to run a marathon previously. Soon after, David completed his first marathon (Las Vegas), in a time that qualified him for entrance into the Boston Marathon.

The reason for the injury and the failure in the attempt is thought to be the use of a portable pull-up bar that was not bolted down, as opposed to the sturdier equipment he used during the months of training prior to this event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nerverush.com/david-goggins-pull-up-record/|title=EXCLUSIVE: David Goggins 24-Hour Pull Up World Record: Take #2|date=November 20, 2012|website=Nerverush.com|accessdate=September 17, 2017}}</ref> Despite not beating the record, Goggins raised more than $20,000 for his chosen charity.\n\nOn November 27, 2012, he completed 3,207 pull-ups in 12 hours, but had to stop due to an injury in his left palm.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nOn January 19, 2013, at Crossfit Brentwood Hills<ref>{{Cite book|last=Goggins, David, 1975-|title=Can't hurt me : master your mind and defy the odds|year=2018|isbn=978-1-5445-1227-3|location=[United States]|oclc=1076968778}}</ref> in [[Brentwood, Tennessee]], Goggins broke the world record for the most pull-ups done in 24 hours, completing 4,030 pull-ups in 17 hours.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://davidgoggins.com/about/|title=ABOUT {{!}} David Goggins|website=davidgoggins.com|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{cite book|last=Goggins |first= David |title=Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds|date=2018|publisher=Lioncrest Publishing |isbn= 978-1-5445-1228-0}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://davidgoggins.com/book/|title=Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds (2018)|year=2018|website=davidgoggins.com|accessdate=December 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n{{Commons category|David Goggins}}\n* [http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/health/fitness/20080711-9999-1s11fitness.html Pain, pleasure to the extreme] at [[San Diego Union-Tribune]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150430072357/http://www.specialops.org/news/19157/David-Goggins-Getting-Even-More-Famous.htm David Goggins Getting Even More Famous (Archive.org snapshot)] at [[Special Operations Warrior Foundation]]\n* [http://www.navytimes.com/news/2008/10/navy_ironman_101308w/ Sailors, SEALs complete Ironman] at [[Navy Times]]\n* [https://www.instagram.com/p/BfEsJnqDhO6/] Attention to detail at [[Instagram]]\n*\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Goggins, David}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American male ultramarathon runners]]\n[[Category:1975 births]]\n[[Category:United States Air Force airmen]]\n[[Category:United States Navy SEALs personnel]]\n[[Category:United States Navy sailors]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Buffalo, New York]]\n[[Category:21st-century American military personnel]]\n", "name_user": "106.204.192.178", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(Best)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Goggins"}
