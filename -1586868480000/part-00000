The [[population density]] was 1,029.2 people per square mile (397.3/km\u00b2). There were 2,565 housing units at an average density of 365.4 per square mile (141.1/km\u00b2).

The only people that get variance's are Big Corporations that are beginning to dominate the city with huge homes and small lots. The zoning commission will approve the big corporation wants, yet will deny a small variance to a young couple who wants to build in the City. The City Manager basically makes the sale for the big corporations, yet will do nothing for the citizens. The City Manager has also screamed and yelled at a citizen like a child having a tantrum; calling him a \"liar\", \"don't point at me\". When the citizen gave him a paper, the continued with the tantrum, violently throwing it into the trash can screaming and interrupting another speaker yelling \"I don't care\". The Demographics are changing because the City council is wanting more money. The percentage of tax may have gone down, but the Huge homes being built on small lots are falsely increasing the value of the the properties. Giving the council more hard earned money to waste. The Cities Police and Fire fighters Associations (Scab Unions) unfairly dominate the political landscape getting the council members who will vote them pay raises and new facilities, thinking of themselves and not the people of Glenn Heights. This is a very volatile little community. The City Council and City Manager delete comments and reviews from the city website to prevent so many citizens that put honest statements that are derogatory towards the city manager and council.\n\n==Education==\nThe Dallas County portion of Glenn Heights is served by the [[DeSoto Independent School District]], while the Ellis County portion is served by the [[Red Oak Independent School District]].\n\nThe Dallas County portion is zoned to either Frank D.

Shields Elementary School, Red Oak Intermediate School, Red Oak Junior High School, and [[Red Oak High School (Texas)|Red Oak High School]].\n\n==Transportation==\nGlenn Heights is the only suburb (except for [[Cockrell Hill, Texas|Cockrell Hill]], which is technically an [[enclave]] and not a suburb) in the southern half of Dallas County that is a member of [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit]]; it has been since DART's inception in 1983.
