After his father's death he was raised by his mother, grandparents and aunts. According to his remembrance, he turned to poetry at 11 or 12, and from the early 1960s he published in such renowned periodicals as Kort\u00e1rs and [[\u00c9let \u00e9s Irodalom]]. Disillusioned by their style himself, he never let any of those writings be re-issued, and soon he developed intention to change career. During the following years he nursed at a mental clinic as a preliminary exercise for planned psychiatry studies, resigning from which he showed interest in economics and law, but later he decided to be a [[philosophy|philosopher]]. He informally attended philosophy classes at [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University]], Budapest. In 1966 he finally enrolled at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University with a Philosophy and Literature major, without ever graduating.

Until 1988 his works appeared only in [[samizdat]]. During that period he made a living as a freelance translator of poetry and drama, most notably that of [[Moli\u00e8re]]. The first official collection of his poems was printed in 1991 by Sz\u00e9pirodalmi K\u00f6nyvkiad\u00f3.\n\n==Political activity==\nBetween 1981 and 1985 he co-edited [[Besz\u00e9l\u0151]], the illegal paper of the [[Democratic Opposition]], and became involved in their anti-regime activities; he was a member of [[SZETA]] (Fund for the Support of the Poor, an illegal [[NGO]] that drew governmental attention by advocating the mere existence of poverty) from which a liberal party, [[Alliance of Free Democrats|SZDSZ]] was formed in 1988. During the 1994 elections, SZDSZ nominated him for [[Member of Parliament|MP]], but in the same year he had to express his disgust of the party's collaboration with its old enemies, the Socialists, by quitting the party. He never appeared in the political scene again.\n\n==Life in the Third Republic==\nHe was one of the editors of [[Holmi]], a literary periodical from 1989, the year of its foundation, to his death in 2000. \nBy receiving Kossuth prize in 1996 along with [[P\u00e9ter Esterh\u00e1zy]], he once again became subject to political criticism for alleged disrespect to [[Christianity]].\n\n==Death and afterward==\nFrom his early youth, Petri suffered in serious nicotine [[Substance dependence|dependency]] and [[alcoholism]]. In 1998, he was diagnosed of [[cancer]] at an incurable stage, in which he died two years later.

He attended elementary school in his native village. Despite his [[Slovene language|Slovene]] mother tongue, \u00c1goston P\u00e1vel graduated with excellence from a [[Hungarian language|Hungarian-speaking]] high school in [[Szentgotth\u00e1rd]], being the top student among 28 from 1897 through 1901. Already in the early days, an amicable relationship developed between P\u00e1vel and his class teacher [[Gy\u0151z\u0151 Schmidt]]. Schmidt, who was the high school's librarian and the editor of the local newspaper, taught him both Hungarian and [[Latin]].\n\nP\u00e1vel continued his studies at Premont College in [[Szombathely]] (1901\u201305). While attending college, he participated in the \"Society for Voluntary Further Education\". In the internal gazette called \"Bimb\u00f3f\u00fcz\u00e9r\" some of his first epigrams, ballads and historical elegies appeared.\n\nFrom 1905 to 1909, P\u00e1vel studied Hungarian and Latin at the Philosophical Faculty of [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University|P\u00e9ter P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny University]] in [[Budapest]]. Beside his specialist area he attended classes in [[Serbo-Croatian]] and [[Russian language]]s and in comparative research of Slavonic languages as a research associate. P\u00e1vel gained a scholarship, was exempted from tuition fees and taught as an assistant professor, where one of his students was [[Albert Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi]], later a [[Nobel Prize]] winner in [[Physiology]].\n\nOn May 15, 1909 he published a critical essay on two disquisitions by [[Oszk\u00e1r Asb\u00f3th]] on Slavic-Hungarian speech forms &mdash; one which scrutinized Slavic stem words and the mutations of the sounds \"j\" and \"gy\" among Hungarian Slovenes, and another on the academic speech of western Hungary, which had been P\u00e1vel's research focus.\n\nThe first verses of P\u00e1vel \u00c1goston were published (in Hungarian) in the newspaper ''Muraszombat \u00e9s Vid\u00e9ke'' (\"Murska Sobota and its district\") and (in the [[Prekmurje dialect]] of Slovene) in \"Novine\", \"Martijin List\" and \"Kolendar\". On November 13, 1909 P\u00e1vel read some Slovene verse translations and some of his own poetry at the Hungarian folklore symposium.\n\nAlso in 1909 the [[Hungarian Academy of Science]] published P\u00e1vel's essay on the phonology of the Slovene language in the language district of [[Cankova|Vashidegk\u00fat]]; the essay formed a part of his dissertation. This work won an award at the University and was highly recognized. Professor [[Oszk\u00e1r Asb\u00f3th|Asb\u00f3th]] commented: \"I am a little angry, however, not at [[Maks Pleter\u0161nik|Pletersnik]] [a Slovene linguist and literary historian], but at such Hungarian linguists who use their vocabulary with simplicity. I explicitly recommend them P\u00e1vel's rich essays, because they can learn a lot from them.\"\n\n==Military service and teaching career==\nIn 1909-10 \u00c1goston P\u00e1vel served in the 7th [[Graz]] and then in the 82nd [[Odorheiu Secuiesc|Sz\u00e9kelyudvarhely]] ([[Transylvania]]) infantry. Due to an administrative mistake, the infantry number 83 was mistakenly written as number 82 and he was detailed to military service in [[Transylvania]]. The \"People's News\" of 1986 wrote in commemoration of P\u00e1vel that he spent his little spare time in the army in collecting popular verse, songs, customs and clothing.\n\nFrom 1910 to 1911 P\u00e1vel served a practicum teaching at the academic main high school in the Budapest second district. \nFrom 1911 to 1913 he was a substitute teacher at the national main high school of [[Turda|Torda]]. On April 14, 1914 he married Irene Benko in [[Szentgotth\u00e1rd]].\n\nOn June 10, 1914 he became a fully certified teacher but was promptly drafted into military service. On September 6 he was badly injured in the battle of [[Lviv|Lemberg (Lviv)]], which resulted in five years of illness. In 1986 the \"People's News\" noted: \"P\u00e1vel \u00c1goston despised the war a lot. What bigger joy could have befallen him than being injured right in the first battle, since he could get away from this senseless war. During the years of sickness he kept writing and translating.\"\n\nIn 1916 P\u00e1vel received a [[Hungarian Academy of Science]] award for his work \"The Modern Slovene Literary Language\". \"With his work the author shows the ambitions that can be noticed in the field of literary language, with great poetic-linguistic expertise and with the basic knowledge of the national Slovene language, which approximates the Slovene language that can be found in Austria and differs from it in its popularity\" (Academic information sheet, May 1917).\n\nIn May 1919 he was elected as a member of the Department of [[Public Education of Domb\u00f3v\u00e1r]] and was also appointed to the editorial committee of the local weekly paper. From May 1920 till August 1933 he worked as a teacher at the national girls' high school of [[Szombathely]]. On November 16, 1920 he was appointed to the Philosophical Faculty of the [[University of Ljubljana]].\n\n==Literary and academic work==\nIn 1924, he was in charge of the library of the cultural organisation of [[Vas County]] and of the city of [[Szombathely]]. In 1925 he compiled and published service directory of cultural organisations for the library of [[Vas|Vas County]] and the city of [[Szombathely]]. By January 1, 1926 he had completed the indexing and restructuring of the museum library. \"The year 1926 marks a watershed in the history of the cultural organisation library, because due to the cooperation of P\u00e1vel \u00c1goston a new vitality ran through the veins of the library, and thus the former strict rules and restrictions were lifted.\"\n\nIn February 1928 began a friendship with [[Ferenc M\u00f3ra]] and [[Vilko Novak]]. In September 1928 he took charge of the museum of [[Vas|Vas County]] and of the folklore magazine, and in November 1928 of that year P\u00e1vel founded the Association of Amity of the [[Vas County Museum]]. For the school year 1928-29 P\u00e1vel opened his home to the 15-year-old [[S\u00e1ndor We\u00f6res]], who was later to become a well-known Hungarian poet.\n\nOn April 27, 1932 P\u00e1vel became a member of the caucus of the Folklore Society, and on June 12, 1939 a member of the correspondence department. In December 1932 was published his first compendium of verse called ''\"Praying in The Bosom of The Blind Valley\"''.\n\nFrom March 1933 until his death in 1946 he was the editor of the scientific journal ''Vasi Szemle'' (\"Vas Review\"). P\u00e1vel formulated and declared the journal's objective as \"a dedication to and an appreciation of the cultural problems in the history of Vas County and west Hungary.\"\n\nOn August 1, 1933 he was shifted to Faludi High School. In 1934 became an honorary secretary member of the Hungarian National Culture Association. In the same year he gained membership of the ''Erd\u00e9ly Sz\u00e9pm\u00edves C\u00e9h'' publishing company. From March 26, 1936 he was a member of the ''T\u00f6m\u00f6rk\u00e9ny'' Society in Szeged.\n\nIn the spring of 1936 he and Dr. [[S\u00e1ndor Gonyei]] went on a journey through the [[\u00d6rs\u00e9g]] National Park, which resulted in his work \"Pictures from \u00d6rs\u00e9g\". In 1936 his second compendium of verse, entitled \"Forest On Fire\", was published.\n\nIn 1937 P\u00e1vel's translation of the most significant literary works of [[Ivan Cankar]] &mdash; ''Hlapec Jernej in njegova resnica'' (\"The Bailiff Yerney and His Right\"), ''Potepuh Marko'' (\"Scapegrace Marko\") and the novel ''Kralj Matja\u017e'' (\"King Matthew\") &mdash; were published in \"[[Nyugat]]\".\n\nIn 1940 due to the fusion of [[Vas County]] and [[Zala County]] the [[Vas review]] expanded its mandate to become a review for western [[Hungary]]. On June 15, 1940 he became a member of the ''G\u00e1rdony'' Society. On August 26, 1940 he again visited [[\u00d6rs\u00e9g]], where together with [[Istv\u00e1n Gy\u0151rffy]] and [[K\u00e1roly Visky]] he accumulated material for a monograph.\nOn December 13, 1940 he was elected member of the ''Pen Klub''.\n\nIn 1941 the translation of the literary works of [[Ivan Cankar]] appeared as part of the series on south Slavic authors. The Hungarian culture review wrote on March 15, 1941: ''\"The translation by \u00c1goston P\u00e1vel is artistic and perfect.\"''  In February 1941 at the Philosophical Faculty of [[Szeged University]] P\u00e1vel was private tutor for the subjects of South Slavic language and literature, and on September 27 of that year he joined the [[Janus Pannonius Society]].\n\nIn 1944 he developed the curriculum for the study of the Hungarian language and composed a Hungarian literary history for use in the schools in the [[Prekmurje|Mura region]] in Slovene-speaking Hungary. in May 1945 he was elected president of the local pedagogic \"Free Province Organisation\" and began work as an official interpreter for Russian in [[Vas|Vas County]]. In June 1945, on his own initiative, he developed and taught the first Russian course to be held in [[Szombathely]]. On November 18, 1945 he was a member of the [[J\u00e1nos Bats\u00e1nyi Literary Society of P\u00e9cs]].\n\n\u00c1goston P\u00e1vel died on January 2, 1946 in [[Szombathely]].\n\n{{commons|\u00c1goston P\u00e1vel}}\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Poetry}}\n* [[Hungarian Slovenes]]\n* [[Prekmurje]]\n* [[List of Slovene writers and poets in Hungary]]\n\n==References==\n*Francek Muki\u010d - Marija Kozar: Slovensko Porabje, Mohorjeva dru\u017eba, [[Celje]] 1982.\n*M\u00e1ria Koz\u00e1r: Etnolo\u0161ki slovar Slovencev na Mad\u017earskem, Mono\u0161ter-Szombathely, 1996. {{ISBN|963-7206-62-0}}\n*Francek Muki\u010d - Marija Kozar: Spoznavanje slovenstva, Croatica, [[Budapest]] 2002. {{ISBN|963-9314-32-3}}\n*M\u00e1ria Koz\u00e1r: The Hungarian Slovenes, Press Publica, Changing world, {{ISBN|978-963-9001-83-1}}\n{{Cankova}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pavel, Agoston}}\n[[Category:1886 births]]\n[[Category:1946 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from the Municipality of Cankova]]\n[[Category:Slovenian writers and poets in Hungary]]\n[[Category:Hungarian male poets]]\n[[Category:Hungarian translators]]\n[[Category:Slovenian translators]]\n[[Category:University of Ljubljana faculty]]\n[[Category:20th-century Hungarian poets]]\n[[Category:20th-century translators]]\n[[Category:20th-century Hungarian male writers]]\n", "text_old": "{{no footnotes|date=February 2013}}\n[[File:P\u00e1vel \u00c1goston 1930 k\u00f6r\u00fcl.jpg|right|250px]]\n{{eastern name order|P\u00e1vel \u00c1goston}}\n'''\u00c1goston P\u00e1vel''', also known in [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] as '''Avgust Pavel''' (28 August 1886, [[Cankova]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]], today in [[Slovenia]] &ndash; 2 January 1946, [[Szombathely]], [[Hungary]]) was a [[Hungarian Slovenes|Hungarian Slovene]] writer, poet, ethnologist, linguist and historian.\n\n==Education==\n\u00c1goston P\u00e1vel was born in [[Cankova]] (then part of [[Vas County (former)|Vas County]]) as the third child of Iv\u00e1n P\u00e1vel, a tailor, and Erzs\u00e9bet Obal.

Professor [[Oszk\u00e1r Asb\u00f3th|Asb\u00f3th]] commented: \"I am a little angry, however, not at [[Maks Pleter\u0161nik|Pletersnik]] [a Slovene linguist and literary historian], but at such Hungarian linguists who use their vocabulary with simplicity. I explicitly recommend them P\u00e1vel's rich essays, because they can learn a lot from them.\"\n\n==Military service and teaching career==\nIn 1909-10 \u00c1goston P\u00e1vel served in the 7th [[Graz]] and then in the 82nd [[Odorheiu Secuiesc|Sz\u00e9kelyudvarhely]] ([[Transylvania]]) infantry. Due to an administrative mistake, the infantry number 83 was mistakenly written as number 82 and he was detailed to military service in [[Transylvania]]. The \"People's News\" of 1986 wrote in commemoration of P\u00e1vel that he spent his little spare time in the army in collecting popular verse, songs, customs and clothing.\n\nFrom 1910 to 1911 P\u00e1vel served a practicum teaching at the academic main high school in the Budapest second district. \nFrom 1911 to 1913 he was a substitute teacher at the national main high school of [[Turda|Torda]]. On April 14, 1914 he married Irene Benko in [[Szentgotth\u00e1rd]].\n\nOn June 10, 1914 he became a fully certified teacher but was promptly drafted into military service. On September 6 he was badly injured in the battle of [[Lviv|Lemberg (Lviv)]], which resulted in five years of illness. In 1986 the \"People's News\" noted: \"P\u00e1vel \u00c1goston despised the war a lot. What bigger joy could have befallen him than being injured right in the first battle, since he could get away from this senseless war. During the years of sickness he kept writing and translating.\"\n\nIn 1916 P\u00e1vel received a [[Hungarian Academy of Science]] award for his work \"The Modern Slovene Literary Language\". \"With his work the author shows the ambitions that can be noticed in the field of literary language, with great poetic-linguistic expertise and with the basic knowledge of the national Slovene language, which approximates the Slovene language that can be found in Austria and differs from it in its popularity\" (Academic information sheet, May 1917).\n\nIn May 1919 he was elected as a member of the Department of [[Public Education of Domb\u00f3v\u00e1r]] and was also appointed to the editorial committee of the local weekly paper. From May 1920 till August 1933 he worked as a teacher at the national girls' high school of [[Szombathely]]. On November 16, 1920 he was appointed to the Philosophical Faculty of the [[University of Ljubljana]].\n\n==Literary and academic work==\nIn 1924, he was in charge of the library of the cultural organisation of [[Vas County]] and of the city of [[Szombathely]]. In 1925 he compiled and published service directory of cultural organisations for the library of [[Vas|Vas County]] and the city of [[Szombathely]]. By January 1, 1926 he had completed the indexing and restructuring of the museum library. \"The year 1926 marks a watershed in the history of the cultural organisation library, because due to the cooperation of P\u00e1vel \u00c1goston a new vitality ran through the veins of the library, and thus the former strict rules and restrictions were lifted.\"\n\nIn February 1928 began a friendship with [[Ferenc M\u00f3ra]] and [[Vilko Novak]]. In September 1928 he took charge of the museum of [[Vas|Vas County]] and of the folklore magazine, and in November 1928 of that year P\u00e1vel founded the Association of Amity of the [[Vas County Museum]]. For the school year 1928-29 P\u00e1vel opened his home to the 15-year-old [[S\u00e1ndor We\u00f6res]], who was later to become a well-known Hungarian poet.\n\nOn April 27, 1932 P\u00e1vel became a member of the caucus of the Folklore Society, and on June 12, 1939 a member of the correspondence department. In December 1932 was published his first compendium of verse called ''\"Praying in The Bosom of The Blind Valley\"''.\n\nFrom March 1933 until his death in 1946 he was the editor of the scientific journal ''Vasi Szemle'' (\"Vas Review\"). P\u00e1vel formulated and declared the journal's objective as \"a dedication to and an appreciation of the cultural problems in the history of Vas County and west Hungary.\"\n\nOn August 1, 1933 he was shifted to Faludi High School. In 1934 became an honorary secretary member of the Hungarian National Culture Association. In the same year he gained membership of the ''Erd\u00e9ly Sz\u00e9pm\u00edves C\u00e9h'' publishing company. From March 26, 1936 he was a member of the ''T\u00f6m\u00f6rk\u00e9ny'' Society in Szeged.\n\nIn the spring of 1936 he and Dr. [[S\u00e1ndor Gonyei]] went on a journey through the [[\u00d6rs\u00e9g]] National Park, which resulted in his work \"Pictures from \u00d6rs\u00e9g\". In 1936 his second compendium of verse, entitled \"Forest On Fire\", was published.\n\nIn 1937 P\u00e1vel's translation of the most significant literary works of [[Ivan Cankar]] &mdash; ''Hlapec Jernej in njegova resnica'' (\"The Bailiff Yerney and His Right\"), ''Potepuh Marko'' (\"Scapegrace Marko\") and the novel ''Kralj Matja\u017e'' (\"King Matthew\") &mdash; were published in \"[[Nyugat]]\".\n\nIn 1940 due to the fusion of [[Vas County]] and [[Zala County]] the [[Vas review]] expanded its mandate to become a review for western [[Hungary]]. On June 15, 1940 he became a member of the ''G\u00e1rdony'' Society. On August 26, 1940 he again visited [[\u00d6rs\u00e9g]], where together with [[Istv\u00e1n Gy\u0151rffy]] and [[K\u00e1roly Visky]] he accumulated material for a monograph.\nOn December 13, 1940 he was elected member of the ''Pen Klub''.\n\nIn 1941 the translation of the literary works of [[Ivan Cankar]] appeared as part of the series on south Slavic authors. The Hungarian culture review wrote on March 15, 1941: ''\"The translation by \u00c1goston P\u00e1vel is artistic and perfect.\"''  In February 1941 at the Philosophical Faculty of [[Szeged University]] P\u00e1vel was private tutor for the subjects of South Slavic language and literature, and on September 27 of that year he joined the [[Janus Pannonius Society]].\n\nIn 1944 he developed the curriculum for the study of the Hungarian language and composed a Hungarian literary history for use in the schools in the [[Prekmurje|Mura region]] in Slovene-speaking Hungary. in May 1945 he was elected president of the local pedagogic \"Free Province Organisation\" and began work as an official interpreter for Russian in [[Vas|Vas County]]. In June 1945, on his own initiative, he developed and taught the first Russian course to be held in [[Szombathely]]. On November 18, 1945 he was a member of the [[J\u00e1nos Bats\u00e1nyi Literary Society of P\u00e9cs]].\n\n\u00c1goston P\u00e1vel died on January 2, 1946 in [[Szombathely]].\n\n{{commons|\u00c1goston P\u00e1vel}}\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Poetry}}\n* [[Hungarian Slovenes]]\n* [[Prekmurje]]\n* [[List of Slovene writers and poets in Hungary]]\n\n==References==\n*Francek Muki\u010d - Marija Kozar: Slovensko Porabje, Mohorjeva dru\u017eba, [[Celje]] 1982.\n*M\u00e1ria Koz\u00e1r: Etnolo\u0161ki slovar Slovencev na Mad\u017earskem, Mono\u0161ter-Szombathely, 1996. {{ISBN|963-7206-62-0}}\n*Francek Muki\u010d - Marija Kozar: Spoznavanje slovenstva, Croatica, [[Budapest]] 2002. {{ISBN|963-9314-32-3}}\n*M\u00e1ria Koz\u00e1r: The Hungarian Slovenes, Press Publica, Changing world, {{ISBN|978-963-9001-83-1}}\n{{Cankova}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pavel, Agoston}}\n[[Category:1886 births]]\n[[Category:1946 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from the Municipality of Cankova]]\n[[Category:Slovenian writers and poets in Hungary]]\n[[Category:Hungarian poets]]\n[[Category:Male poets]]\n[[Category:Hungarian translators]]\n[[Category:Slovenian translators]]\n[[Category:University of Ljubljana faculty]]\n[[Category:20th-century poets]]\n[[Category:20th-century translators]]\n[[Category:20th-century Hungarian male writers]]\n", "name_user": "Bearcat", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:recat", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81goston_P%C3%A1vel"}
