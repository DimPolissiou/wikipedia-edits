In February 1973, Sarkar was poisoned in prison, allegedly by the jail doctor on orders from the higher echelons of government. On 1 April, after recovering his health, Sarkar began fasting in support of a demand for an inquest into his poisoning. That demand was never met.

The basis of ''Ananda Marga'' practice is covered by a set of rules called the 'Sixteen Points' that guide the practitioner on both [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and social aspects.\n\nAnandamurti expounded these principles in '''{{IAST|\u0100nanda S\u016btram}}''' a text composed in Sanskrit in 1961.\n\n=== Meditation, ''Lalita Marmika'' dance and ''Kirtan'' ===\n[[File:Yoga Meditation Pos-410px.png|thumb|left|x130px|Meditation's posture.]]\nIn the ''tantric'' tradition of ''Ananda Marga'' the spiritual aspirant ([[sadhaka]]) practices [[sadhana]].

An ''acarya'' is most commonly a [[monk]] or [[nun]], but in the ''Ananda Marga'' tradition there are also \"family ''acaryas''\". In the [[initiation]] the aspirant makes a commitment to practice meditation and to live in harmony with the universal balance, and is then taught the technique itself. The aspirant is then required to keep the individual [[lesson]]s personal. In addition, he also taught ''Kapalika'' meditation to many ''[[Sannyasa|sany\u00e1sins]]''. His system of ''yoga'' can be termed as ''R\u00e1jadhir\u00e1ja Yoga'', ''Tantra Yoga'', or simply ''\u00c1nanda M\u00e1rga Yoga''. The basic ''\u00c1nanda M\u00e1rga'' meditation system is called Sahaja Yoga ('simple yoga').

These meetings called ''Dharma Chakras'' (weekly held in a place called ''Dhyan Mandir'') are preceded by the singing of few ''Prabhat Samgiita'' (\"Songs of the New Dawn\" composed by the ''Ananda Marga'' founder) followed by the spiritual dance of ''Lalita Marmika'' along with the singing of and by the practice of meditation.

Particularly the reflection of the soul on the mind is called ''jiivatma'' and in that case the \"reflector-soul\" is called ''Paramatma'' (Supreme Soul).<ref group=note>''Vis\u2019aya purus\u2019a'vabha\u2019shah jiiva\u2019tma\u2019'': \"The reflection of Consciousness \u2013 ''Purusa'' \u2013 in the unit object is known as ''jiiva\u2019tma'' \u2013 \"unit soul\" \u2013 (''A\u2019nanda Sutram'', Chapter 2, Sutra 8 (2\u20138) in Avadh\u016btika \u0100nanda Mitra \u0100c\u0101ry\u0101, 1981).</ref>\n\n{{Infobox\n|title        = Yama-Niyama\n<!-- This infobox is based on the 10 principles of yogic morality (yama-niyama) \nas explained by Shrii Shrii Anandamurti in ''A Guide to Human Conduct''. -->\n\n|headerstyle  = background:#ccf;\n|labelstyle   = background:#ddf;\n\n|header1 = Yama (Restraint)\n  | label2= Ahim'sa' (Benignity)\n  | data2 = Thinking, speaking, and acting without inflicting pain or harm on another\n  | label3= Satya (Benevolence)\n  | data3 = Thinking and speaking with goodwill\n  | label4= Asteya<br/>(Honesty)\n  | data4 = Not taking or keeping what belongs to others\n  | label5= Brahmacarya (Ideation)\n  | data5 = Constant mental association with the Supreme\n  | label6= Aparigraha (Frugality)\n  | data6 = Non-indulgence in superfluous amenities\n|header7 = Niyama (Regulation)\n  | label8= Shaoca (Cleanliness)\n  | data8 = Physical and mental purity, both internal and external\n  | label9= Santos'a (Contentment)\n  | data9 = Maintaining a state of mental ease\n  | label10= Tapah<br/>(Sacrifice)\n  | data10 = Acceptance of sufferings to reach the spiritual goal\n  | label11= Sva'dhya'ya (Contemplation)\n  | data11 = Clear understanding of any spiritual subject\n  | label12= Iishvara Pran'idha'na (Dedication)\n  | data12 = Adopting the Cosmic Controller as the only ideal of life and moving with ever-accelerating speed toward that Desideratum\n\n|belowstyle = background:#ddf;\n|below = Intent is primary, but both intent and action should conform if possible.\n}}\n* '''Realms of the [[Mind]]''': according to ''Ananda Marga'' philosophy the human mind is composed of five layers called ''Kosas'':<ref group=note>The last three deeper layers are collectively called \"Causal Mind\". \"Causal\" signifies that these layers are in the most direct contact with the \"Causal Consciousness\" from which the mind has evolved and within which it exists.</ref> 1)''Kamamaya Kosa'' (\"desire layer\") or \"Crude Mind\": is the crudest layer, purified through adherence to the yogic code of morality, Yama-Niyama.<ref group=note>This ''Kosa'' controls the various autonomic activities of the body and the expression of the mental propensities, known as ''vrtti'', in [[Samskrta]].</ref> 2)''Manomaya Kosa'' (\"layer of thinking\") or \"Subtle Mind\": is the layer of thought and memory.<ref group=note>This ''Kosa'' gives experience of pleasure and pain. It is developed naturally through physical clash, and in ''Ananda Marga sadhana'' by ''pranayama'' with cosmic ideation.</ref> 3)''Atimanasa Kosa'' or \"Supramental Mind\": is the intuitive layer.<ref group=note>This ''Kosa''  gives the capacity of intuitive [[dream]]s, [[clairvoyance]], [[telepathy]] and [[creativity|creative]] insight. It is developed naturally through psychic clash, and in ''Ananda Marga sadhana'' by methods of ''pratyahara'' (withdrawal) such as ''shuddhis'' and ''Guru Puja''.</ref> 4)''Vijinanamaya Kosa'' (\"layer of the special knowledge\") or \"Subliminal Mind\": is the layer of conscience or discrimination (''viveka'') and ''[[Vairagya|vaeragya]]'' (non-attachment).<ref group=note>This ''Kosa'' is developed naturally through psychic clash, and its development is accelerated by the process of ''dharana''.</ref> 5)''Hiranyamaya Kosa'' (\"golden level\") or \"Subtle Causal Mind\": is the subtlest layer. Here the [[awareness]] of mind is very close to the direct [[experience]] of \"Supreme Consciousness\".<ref group=note>Here there is only the separation of a thin veil of ignorance. This ''Kosa'' is developed naturally through the attraction for the Great, and ''[[Dhyana in Hinduism|dhyana]]'' accelerates this process for ''[[sadhaka]]s'' (spirituals aspirants).</ref>\n* '''[[Microvita theory]]''': ''Microvita'' is plural for ''Micro-vitum'' and literally means \"micro-life\". The concept was first introduced in 1986 through a series of lectures by P.R. Sarkar. According to this notion, microvita are entities which come within the realms both of physicality of psychic expression. They are smaller and subtler than physical [[atom]]s and [[subatomic particle]]s. So far as physicality is concerned, the position of these microvita is just between ectoplasm and electron, but they are neither ectoplasm nor electron.{{sfn|Dalal|2011|p=325}} The author predicted that they would be recognized by conventional science when it is developed much further.\n\n=== Social philosophy ===\nThe social outlook of ''Ananda Marga'' recognizes that the welfare of the [[individual]] is linked with the welfare of the [[collective]], each relying on the other for its [[existence]] and dynamism. According to this philosophy everyone has the [[Rights|right]] to [[Equal opportunity|equal opportunities]] of life and [[Social change|development]] and as such there should be no discrimination on the basis of superficial barriers such as [[race (classification of humans)|race]], nationality and religion. ''Ananda Marga'' advocates a world of [[justice]], security and [[peace]] for all.<ref>[http://anandamarga.org/social-philosophy/ Ananda Marga Social Philosophy]</ref> The Social Philosophy of ''Ananda Marga'' can be categorized under the topics: \n* '''[[Neohumanism#Neohumanism|Neohumanism]]''': in 1982, Sarkar extended his writings on the subject of [[Society|human society]] with the [[Introduction (essay)|introduction]] of his new theory of \"[[Neohumanism#Neohumanism|Neohumanism]]\".<ref>See: Sarkar, P. R., 1982.</ref> While [[humanism]] extends the recognition of equal rights to all humans, yet tends to anthropocentric worldview, neohumanism, according to Sarkar's theory, is instead the elevation of humanism to [[universalism]], thus expanding an inclusive spirit of welfare to all living beings and the created world.<ref group=note>\"When the underlying spirit of [[humanism]] is extended to everything, animate and inanimate, in this [[universe]] \u2013 I have designated this as \"Neohumanism\". This Neohumanism will elevate [[humanism]] to [[universalism]], the [[cult]] of love for all created beings of this [[universe]].\" (Sarkar, P. R., 1982).</ref>\n* '''Education''': according to the ''Ananda Marga'' system \"Education is for [[Moksha|Liberation]].\" Education means the simultaneous development in the physical, mental and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] [[realm]]s of human [[existence]]. By this, dormant human [[potentialities]] will be awakened and put to proper use. Sarkar said that real education leads to a pervasive [[Feeling|sense]] of love and [[compassion]] for all creation; in the ''Ananda Marga's'' education system, special emphasis is given to [[Morality|moral]] education and the inculcation of idealism together with a \"psycho-pedagogical approach\" and a blending of occidental extroversial science and oriental introversial philosophy.<ref group=note>\"The noblest form of social service is to educate the public and create a sense of consciousness in them. This sense of consciousness is to be instilled in every human being. This is your duty. The goal of education is to elevate the all-round standard, and especially the intellectual standard. In addition, the elevation of the moral standard is extremely necessary in the sphere of education. This moral standard is deficient today. It is lacking in the present educational system also. You are to create a new social order. Therefore, you should first acquire more and more knowledge in different spheres of life and also you are to upgrade your morality. Along with your intellectual standard, if you have morality, then everybody will respect you. Try to acquire as much knowledge as possible through our own books. Education which leads to the acquisition of knowledge plus morality makes for a peaceful society.\" (Sarkar, P. R., ''Discourses on Neo\u2013 humanist Education''.).</ref>\n* '''Culture''': In his discourse \"Talks on Prout\", given in Ranchi in July 1961, Sarkar makes a distinction between the terms \"culture\" and \"customs\". According to Sarkar \"culture... is the collective name for different expressions of life...\" but \"...all of society has the same culture. There are local variations in the mode or state of cultural expression, but the expression is universal... These local variations are called customs... Thus local modes of expression bearing local or group specialities are customs, but the expression itself is culture. Therefore it is a mistake to readjust boundaries on the basis of language and culture. Indian culture and the culture of the world are one and the same.\"{{sfn|Sarkar|1968}} The philosophy of Sarkar reinterprets the general concept of culture by inserting it into a new universalistic outlook. As described by Antonello Maggipinto:\n{{Quote|''...If the term \"culture\" is usually referred to the original meaning of this word (i.e. from the Greek \"paid\u00e9ia\" to the Latin \"humanitas\", that is to human beings capable of distinguishably mastering the arts, rhetoric, and philosophy), then Sarkar offers a new point of view, with a large universalistic explanation: \u201cthe culture of the whole human race is one, but marked by different local manifestations... it is the same, but varying in expression.\" (Sarkar, P.R., 1987)...''{{sfn|Maggipinto|2000}}}}\n* '''[[Progressive utilization theory|PROUT]]''' (\"[[Progressivism|Progressive]] Utilization [[Theory]]\"): is a [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] theory first mentioned in 1959 by P. R. Sarkar<ref>{{cite book |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Sociology of knowledge to Zaroastrianism |editor-first=Edward |editor-last=Craig |editor-link=Edward Craig (philosopher) |publisher= Routledge (Taylor & Francis) |year=1998 |isbn=0-415-16916-X}}</ref> in his speech \"The Cosmic Brotherood\".<ref>Later published in Sarkar, P. R. (1961-2001) p. 89-97.</ref> In 1968, Sarkar founded the organization \"Proutist Block of India\" (PBI), to further the ideals of his theory through political and social action.{{sfn|Fukui|1985|p=357}}\n\n=== ''Tantra'' in ''Ananda Marga'' ===\n{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|title=Shrii Shrii Anandamurti on ''tantrics'' and ''tantric'' cult |align=left|quote=\"\"A person who, irrespective of [[caste]], [[creed]] or religion, aspires for spiritual expansion or does something concrete, is a ''Tantric''. ''Tantra' in itself is neither a religion nor an 'ism'. ''Tantra'' is a fundamental spiritual science. So wherever there is any spiritual practice it should be taken for granted that it stands on the Tantric cult. Where there is no spiritual practice, where people pray to God for the fulfilment of narrow worldly desires, where people's only slogan is \"Give us this and give us that\" \u2013 only there do we find that Tantra is discouraged. So only those who do not understand Tantra, or even after understanding Tantra do not want to do any spiritual practice, oppose the cult of Tantra.\"|source=Shrii Shrii Anandamurti\u00b4s \"Tantra and its Effect on Society\", 1959.{{sfn|Anandamurti|1959}}}}\nSarkar weaves continuity with the ancient philosophy of ''Tantra'', infusing new insights in [[Psychology|human psychology]], [[social theory]] and in each individuals' [[role]]s as spiritual and \"socio-economic-cultural-political\" beings.\n''\u00c1nanda M\u00e1rga Tantra'' has a broad [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] base which allows for ways of [[Knowledge|knowing]], [[feeling]] and [[Process (science)|processing]] which go far beyond [[intellect]]uality or limited [[rationality]]. Priorities are given to the spiritual development, as Shrii Shrii \u00c1nandam\u00farti notes, \"spiritual life controls all other arenas of human life.\"<ref>[http://www.gurukul.edu Bussey, Marcus. ''Homo Tantricus: Tantra as an Episteme for Future Generations'']</ref>''Ananda Marga Tantra'' is a [[principle]], a science which if practiced will lead to the desired objective. The [[essence]] of ''Tantra'' is to awaken the latent spiritual force in the human personality and unify oneself with the Cosmic Consciousness.<ref group=note>\"It is not a religion or empty philosophy which can be confined to the realms of abstract speculation or theoretical debate. Tantra is a process of subjective transformation, which may be practiced by anyone irrespective of gender, cultural background, education, social status or intellectual evolution, as an adequate system of spiritual endeavor is the birthright of all. ''Tantra'' does not discriminate by any racial, genealogical, political, national or economic differences amongst human beings, as the later might form the basis for one human group to assert superiority over another. ''Tantra'' does, however, give recognition to individual vigor and the development of latent human potentialities, which make some people outstand in their lives. Consequently ''Tantra'' puts greater emphasis on human values than on social values\".(Coyle, G. 1985).</ref>\n\n=== ''Guru'' and Disciple ===\nAccording to ''tantric'' tradition a proper [[preceptor]] and a proper disciple are both essential for success on the path of ''Tantra''.\nP.R. Sarkar clearly explains<ref>See: Shrii Shrii Anandamurti, 1982 and 1994.</ref> that, disciples are of three categories: 1) disciples that acquire spiritual knowledge when they are in close contact with the preceptor, but as soon as they are apart from him they forget all his/her teachings, 2) disciples that learn many things from the preceptor with great hardship, but do not take proper care to preserve those instructions. They lose their hard-earned knowledge out of negligence, 3) disciples that carefully preserve deep in their minds and hearts whatever they have learned from their preceptor by wisely putting those teachings into practice. This is the best category of disciples.\n\n==References==\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n{{reflist|group=note|colwidth=30em}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n[https://indiankanoon.org/doc/100346371/ Abhipremananda Murder case]\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{citation |title=Tantra and its Effect on Society |last=Anandamurti |first=Shrii Shrii |location=Bhagalpur |publisher= Ananda Marga Pubs |year=1959}}\n* {{citation |last=Dalal |first=Roshen |title=The Religions of India: A Concise Guide to Nine Major Faiths |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pNmfdAKFpkQC&pg=PA21 |date=23 November 2011 |publisher=Penguin Books India |isbn=978-0-14-341517-6 |ref=harv}}\n* {{citation |title=Travel with the Mystic Master |last=Dharmavedananda |first=\u00c1c. |year=1999 |location=Singapore |publisher=Ananda Marga Publications |ISBN=981-04-0864-1}}\n* {{citation|title=Political Parties of Asia and the Pacific |last= Fukui |first= Haruhiro |year= 1985 | publisher=Greenwood Press|page=357 |isbn= 0-313-21350-X|ref=harv}}\n* {{citation |last=Lewis|first=James R.|title=Violence and New Religious Movements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5CqS3ILwnmsC&pg=PA250 |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-973563-1}}\n* {{citation |last = Maggipinto |first = Antonello |contribution = Multilanguage Acquisition, New Technologies, Education and Global Citizenship |editor-last = American Association for Italian Studies |title = Academic journal article from Italian Culture |volume = 18-2 |page =147 |pages = |publisher = AAIS |place = New York |year = 2000 |contribution-url =https://www.questia.com/library/1G1-83245337/multilanguage-acquisition-new-technologies-education}}\n* {{citation |title=PROUT in a Nutshell Part 15 |last=Sarkar |first=Prabhat Ranjan |publisher=Ananda Marga Publications |year= 1968 |ISBN= }}\n{{refend}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|title=Teaching asanas: An Ananda Marga manual for teacher |author=Ananda Marga Aa.

In 1967, Ananda Marga headquarters came under attack by locals who were allegedly incited by Communist leaders.{{sfn|Lewis|2011|p=254}} Criticism of corruption in the Indian government by acharyas of Ananda Marga also put it in confrontation with Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]]. In 1971, Sarkar was imprisoned in India for the alleged murder of Ananda Marga members. In February 1973, Sarkar was poisoned in prison, allegedly by the jail doctor on orders from the higher echelons of government. On 1 April, after recovering his health, Sarkar began fasting in support of a demand for an inquest into his poisoning. That demand was never met.

The concept was first introduced in 1986 through a series of lectures by P.R. Sarkar. According to this notion, microvita are entities which come within the realms both of physicality of psychic expression. They are smaller and subtler than physical [[atom]]s and [[subatomic particle]]s. So far as physicality is concerned, the position of these microvita is just between ectoplasm and electron, but they are neither ectoplasm nor electron.{{sfn|Dalal|2011|p=325}} The author predicted that they would be recognized by conventional science when it is developed much further.\n\n=== Social philosophy ===\nThe social outlook of ''Ananda Marga'' recognizes that the welfare of the [[individual]] is linked with the welfare of the [[collective]], each relying on the other for its [[existence]] and dynamism. According to this philosophy everyone has the [[Rights|right]] to [[Equal opportunity|equal opportunities]] of life and [[Social change|development]] and as such there should be no discrimination on the basis of superficial barriers such as [[race (classification of humans)|race]], nationality and religion.

R., 1982.</ref> While [[humanism]] extends the recognition of equal rights to all humans, yet tends to anthropocentric worldview, neohumanism, according to Sarkar's theory, is instead the elevation of humanism to [[universalism]], thus expanding an inclusive spirit of welfare to all living beings and the created world.<ref group=note>\"When the underlying spirit of [[humanism]] is extended to everything, animate and inanimate, in this [[universe]] \u2013 I have designated this as \"Neohumanism\". This Neohumanism will elevate [[humanism]] to [[universalism]], the [[cult]] of love for all created beings of this [[universe]].\" (Sarkar, P. R., 1982).</ref>\n* '''Education''': according to the ''Ananda Marga'' system \"Education is for [[Moksha|Liberation]].\" Education means the simultaneous development in the physical, mental and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] [[realm]]s of human [[existence]]. By this, dormant human [[potentialities]] will be awakened and put to proper use. Sarkar said that real education leads to a pervasive [[Feeling|sense]] of love and [[compassion]] for all creation; in the ''Ananda Marga's'' education system, special emphasis is given to [[Morality|moral]] education and the inculcation of idealism together with a \"psycho-pedagogical approach\" and a blending of occidental extroversial science and oriental introversial philosophy.<ref group=note>\"The noblest form of social service is to educate the public and create a sense of consciousness in them. This sense of consciousness is to be instilled in every human being. This is your duty. The goal of education is to elevate the all-round standard, and especially the intellectual standard. In addition, the elevation of the moral standard is extremely necessary in the sphere of education. This moral standard is deficient today. It is lacking in the present educational system also. You are to create a new social order. Therefore, you should first acquire more and more knowledge in different spheres of life and also you are to upgrade your morality. Along with your intellectual standard, if you have morality, then everybody will respect you. Try to acquire as much knowledge as possible through our own books. Education which leads to the acquisition of knowledge plus morality makes for a peaceful society.\" (Sarkar, P. R., ''Discourses on Neo\u2013 humanist Education''.).</ref>\n* '''Culture''': In his discourse \"Talks on Prout\", given in Ranchi in July 1961, Sarkar makes a distinction between the terms \"culture\" and \"customs\". According to Sarkar \"culture... is the collective name for different expressions of life...\" but \"...all of society has the same culture. There are local variations in the mode or state of cultural expression, but the expression is universal... These local variations are called customs... Thus local modes of expression bearing local or group specialities are customs, but the expression itself is culture. Therefore it is a mistake to readjust boundaries on the basis of language and culture. Indian culture and the culture of the world are one and the same.\"{{sfn|Sarkar|1968}} The philosophy of Sarkar reinterprets the general concept of culture by inserting it into a new universalistic outlook.

''Tantra' in itself is neither a religion nor an 'ism'. ''Tantra'' is a fundamental spiritual science. So wherever there is any spiritual practice it should be taken for granted that it stands on the Tantric cult. Where there is no spiritual practice, where people pray to God for the fulfilment of narrow worldly desires, where people's only slogan is \"Give us this and give us that\" \u2013 only there do we find that Tantra is discouraged. So only those who do not understand Tantra, or even after understanding Tantra do not want to do any spiritual practice, oppose the cult of Tantra.\"|source=Shrii Shrii Anandamurti\u00b4s \"Tantra and its Effect on Society\", 1959.{{sfn|Anandamurti|1959}}}}\nSarkar weaves continuity with the ancient philosophy of ''Tantra'', infusing new insights in [[Psychology|human psychology]], [[social theory]] and in each individuals' [[role]]s as spiritual and \"socio-economic-cultural-political\" beings.\n''\u00c1nanda M\u00e1rga Tantra'' has a broad [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] base which allows for ways of [[Knowledge|knowing]], [[feeling]] and [[Process (science)|processing]] which go far beyond [[intellect]]uality or limited [[rationality]]. Priorities are given to the spiritual development, as Shrii Shrii \u00c1nandam\u00farti notes, \"spiritual life controls all other arenas of human life.\"<ref>[http://www.gurukul.edu Bussey, Marcus. ''Homo Tantricus: Tantra as an Episteme for Future Generations'']</ref>''Ananda Marga Tantra'' is a [[principle]], a science which if practiced will lead to the desired objective. The [[essence]] of ''Tantra'' is to awaken the latent spiritual force in the human personality and unify oneself with the Cosmic Consciousness.<ref group=note>\"It is not a religion or empty philosophy which can be confined to the realms of abstract speculation or theoretical debate. Tantra is a process of subjective transformation, which may be practiced by anyone irrespective of gender, cultural background, education, social status or intellectual evolution, as an adequate system of spiritual endeavor is the birthright of all. ''Tantra'' does not discriminate by any racial, genealogical, political, national or economic differences amongst human beings, as the later might form the basis for one human group to assert superiority over another. ''Tantra'' does, however, give recognition to individual vigor and the development of latent human potentialities, which make some people outstand in their lives. Consequently ''Tantra'' puts greater emphasis on human values than on social values\".(Coyle, G. 1985).</ref>\n\n=== ''Guru'' and Disciple ===\nAccording to ''tantric'' tradition a proper [[preceptor]] and a proper disciple are both essential for success on the path of ''Tantra''.\nP.R. Sarkar clearly explains<ref>See: Shrii Shrii Anandamurti, 1982 and 1994.</ref> that, disciples are of three categories: 1) disciples that acquire spiritual knowledge when they are in close contact with the preceptor, but as soon as they are apart from him they forget all his/her teachings, 2) disciples that learn many things from the preceptor with great hardship, but do not take proper care to preserve those instructions. They lose their hard-earned knowledge out of negligence, 3) disciples that carefully preserve deep in their minds and hearts whatever they have learned from their preceptor by wisely putting those teachings into practice. This is the best category of disciples.\n\n==References==\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n{{reflist|group=note|colwidth=30em}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n[https://indiankanoon.org/doc/100346371/ Abhipremananda Murder case]\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{citation |title=Tantra and its Effect on Society |last=Anandamurti |first=Shrii Shrii |location=Bhagalpur |publisher= Ananda Marga Pubs |year=1959}}\n* {{citation |last=Dalal |first=Roshen |title=The Religions of India: A Concise Guide to Nine Major Faiths |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pNmfdAKFpkQC&pg=PA21 |date=23 November 2011 |publisher=Penguin Books India |isbn=978-0-14-341517-6 |ref=harv}}\n* {{citation |title=Travel with the Mystic Master |last=Dharmavedananda |first=\u00c1c. |year=1999 |location=Singapore |publisher=Ananda Marga Publications |ISBN=981-04-0864-1}}\n* {{citation|title=Political Parties of Asia and the Pacific |last= Fukui |first= Haruhiro |year= 1985 | publisher=Greenwood Press|page=357 |isbn= 0-313-21350-X|ref=harv}}\n* {{citation |last=Lewis|first=James R.|title=Violence and New Religious Movements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5CqS3ILwnmsC&pg=PA250 |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-973563-1}}\n* {{citation |last = Maggipinto |first = Antonello |contribution = Multilanguage Acquisition, New Technologies, Education and Global Citizenship |editor-last = American Association for Italian Studies |title = Academic journal article from Italian Culture |volume = 18-2 |page =147 |pages = |publisher = AAIS |place = New York |year = 2000 |contribution-url =https://www.questia.com/library/1G1-83245337/multilanguage-acquisition-new-technologies-education}}\n* {{citation |title=PROUT in a Nutshell Part 15 |last=Sarkar |first=Prabhat Ranjan |publisher=Ananda Marga Publications |year= 1968 |ISBN= }}\n{{refend}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|title=Teaching asanas: An Ananda Marga manual for teacher |author=Ananda Marga Aa.
