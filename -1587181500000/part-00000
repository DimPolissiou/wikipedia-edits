The University's Department of Medicine operates an important medical center located in the center of [[Santo Domingo]]. At an undergraduate level, the UCE counts with twelve academic departments: [[Medicine]], [[Dentistry]], [[Bioanalysis]], [[Pharmaceutics]], [[Business|Business Sciences]], [[Systems Engineering|Systems]], [[Tourism]], [[Industrial Engineering|Production Sciences]], [[Civil Engineering|Construction Sciences]], [[Natural Resources]], [[Law School|Law]], and [[Social and Public Communication]]. The Dominican State officially recognized the institution through the Presidential Decree N\u00b0. 1205, on July 2, 1971.\n\n==Short history==\n\nUCE was founded at a time in which the Dominican Republic only counted with a handful of other universities nationwide, which included the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo ([[Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Santo Domingo|UASD]]), founded by Pope [[Paul III]] in 1538; the [[PUCMM|Catholic University Mother and Teacher]] (now Pontifical) founded in [[Santiago de los Caballeros|Santiago]] in 1962; and the National University Pedro Henr\u00edquez Ure\u00f1a ([[UNPHU]]), founded in 1966.\n\nThe creation of UCE marked the beginning of an expansion period in Dominican higher education. During the 1970s, ten universities were inaugurated, UCE being  the first of them. During the 1980s, a period during which UCE expanded across the country, ten other universities saw their beginnings. An initiative of Dr. Jos\u00e9 A. Hazim Azar, UCE was first conceived as a Regional Institution: there were no higher education campuses or institutions in the eastern region of the country. For its creation, Hazim counted on the cooperation of important personalities of San Pedro de Macor\u00eds, some of them members of the chamber of commerce of the province. Nowadays, UCE has expanded to include several campuses nationwide, largely due to public demand. In 1980, the first extension was built in the province of [[El Seybo]]. The campus of [[La Romana, Dominican Republic|La Romana]] in 1982 followed, as did the extensions of [[San Juan de la Maguana]], [[San Crist\u00f3bal, Dominican Republic|San Crist\u00f3bal]], and [[Santo Domingo]], in 1983.
