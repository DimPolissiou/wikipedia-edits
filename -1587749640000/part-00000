{"title_page": "Paleontology in Texas", "text_new": "[[File:Map of USA TX.svg|thumb|The location of the [[state of Texas]]]]\n'''Paleontology in Texas''' refers to [[paleontological]] research occurring within or conducted by people from the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]]. Author Marian Murray has remarked that \"Texas is as big for [[fossil]]s as it is for everything else.\"<ref name=\"50states-texas-265\" /> Some of the most important fossil finds in [[Paleontology in the United States|United States]] history have come from Texas. Fossils can be found throughout most of the state.<ref name=\"50states-texas-265-266\" /> The [[fossil record]] of Texas spans almost the entire geologic column from [[Precambrian]] to [[Pleistocene]].<ref name=\"50states-texas-266\" /> [[Shark]] teeth are probably the state's most common fossil. During the early [[Paleozoic era]] Texas was covered by a sea that would later be home to creatures like [[brachiopod]]s, [[cephalopod]]s, [[graptolite]]s, and [[trilobite]]s. Little is known about the state's [[Devonian]] and early [[Carboniferous]] life. However, evidence indicates that during the late Carboniferous the state was home to marine life, land plants and early [[reptile]]s. During the [[Permian]], the seas largely shrank away, but nevertheless [[coral reef]]s formed in the state. The rest of Texas was a [[coastal plain]] inhabited by [[Synapsid|early relatives of]] [[mammals]] like ''[[Dimetrodon]]'' and ''[[Edaphosaurus]]''. During the [[Triassic]], a great river system formed in the state that was inhabited by [[crocodile]]-like [[phytosaurs]]. Little is known about [[Jurassic]] Texas, but there are fossil aquatic invertebrates of this age like [[ammonites]] in the state. During the [[Early Cretaceous]] local large [[sauropod]]s and [[theropod]]s left a great abundance of [[Dinosaur footprints|footprints]]. [[Late Cretaceous|Later]] in the [[Cretaceous]], the state was covered by the [[Western Interior Seaway]] and home to creatures like [[mosasaur]]s, [[plesiosaur]]s, and few icthyosaurs.  Early [[Cenozoic]] Texas still contained areas covered in seawater where invertebrates and [[shark]]s lived. On land the state would come to be home to creatures like [[glyptodont]]s, [[mammoth]]s, [[mastodon]]s, [[saber-toothed cat]]s, [[giant ground sloth]]s, [[titanothere]]s, [[uintathere]]s, and [[dire wolf|dire wolves]]. [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] evidence suggests that local [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] knew about local fossils. Formally trained scientists were already investigating the state's fossils by the late 1800s. In 1938, a major dinosaur footprint find occurred near [[Glen Rose]]. ''[[Pleurocoelus]]'' was the Texas [[state dinosaur]] from 1997 to 2009, when it was replaced by ''[[Paluxysaurus jonesi]]'' after the Texan fossils once referred to the former species were reclassified to a new [[genus]].\n\n==Prehistory==\nKhloe Devereaux is the prettiest and coolest person i know and follower her TikTok @khloe_.dev.24 - from b Williams \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the [[Cambrian]] period, Texas was covered by a sea.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> Cambrian life in Texas included [[brachiopod]]s, [[gastropod]]s, [[graptolite]]s, and [[trilobite]]s.<ref name=\"50states-texas-266-268\" /> Areas of Texas distant from the shore were home to [[bivalve]]s, brachiopods, [[sponge]]s, and trilobites.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" />  Contemporary graptolites were preserved in the central region of the state.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> Texan wildlife during the ensuing [[Ordovician]] period included brachiopods, [[cephalopod]]s,  [[coral]]s, gastropods, graptolites, sponges, and trilobites, although apart from the graptolites, these sorts of fossils tend to be poorly preserved.<ref name=\"50states-texas-267\" /> The graptolites were preserved in the Ordovician deposits of western Texas, especially some of the stratigraphic units of the [[Trans-Pecos]] region.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> In some places these graptolite fossils are common.<ref name=\"50states-texas-267\" /> The presence of these marine habitats distant from shore persisted into the [[Silurian]].<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> Few fossils were preserved locally during the former period.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> Silurian brachiopods and corals fossilized in the [[Van Horn, Texas|Van Horn]] and [[El Paso]] Regions.<ref name=\"50states-texas-267\" />\n\n[[Devonian]] Texas still contained marine habitats distant from shore.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> However, the state's Devonian rocks are buried below the surface and inaccessible apart from core drilling.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> Consequently the contemporary life is not well known.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> Known life of Devonian Texas includes brachiopods, [[bryozoan]]s, [[conodont]]s, corals, gastropods, [[radiolarian]]s and trilobites. Contemporary brachiopods were preserved in great abundance, however their fossils tend to be fragmentary. Their remains were preserved in the El Paso, Van Horn, [[Llano Uplift]], and [[Marathon, Texas|Marathon]] areas. Contemporary radiolarian fossils are also very common in the El Paso, Van Horn, and Marathon areas, and like the brachiopods, their fossils tend to be fragmentary. Fossils of the other listed taxa were preserved in the Llano Uplift area. Vertebrates included armored fishes, also preserved in the Llano Uplift.<ref name=\"50states-texas-267\" /> Contemporary [[placoderms]] were preserved in central Texas.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" />\n\nLike the state's Devonian rocks, those of [[Early Carboniferous]] age are buried below the surface and inaccessible apart from core drilling.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> Consequently the contemporary life is not well known.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> Texas was home to brachiopods, cephalopods, crinoids, gastropods, [[ostracods]], trilobites during the [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]]. Contemporary brachiopods were preserved in the [[Hueco Mountains]] of the Trans-Pecos Region and Llano Uplift. They tend to be the most common fossil in the Hueco Mountain sites. Contemporary bryozoan and gastropod fossils were preserved in the Hueco Mountains of the Trans-Pecos Region, but are less common. The other taxa's fossils were preserved in the Llano Uplift.<ref name=\"50states-texas-267\" />\n\nDuring the [[Late Carboniferous]] many fossils were preserved in the north-central part of the state.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> Texas had a fauna including [[algae]], brachiopods, corals, [[crinoids]], [[fusulinids]], gastropods, and [[pelecypods]] during the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] epoch. Pennsylvanian fossils are widespread in Texas. Pennsylvanian fossils of the listed taxa were preserved in both the [[Sierra Diablo Mountains|Diablo]] and Hueco Mountains.<ref name=\"50states-texas-267\" /> The Llano Uplift region also preserves Pennsylvanian fossils. The north-central region of the uplift is the best source. Pennsylvanian taxa preserved there included  brachiopods, branching bryozoans, lacy bryozoans, horn corals, other corals, crinoids, fusulinids, gastropods, [[goniatites]], [[nautiloids]], and pelecypods.<ref name=\"50states-texas-267\" /> The contemporary vertebrate fauna included [[sharks]], which left behind their teeth.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> Plant fossils were preserved in abundance in the Llano Uplift, north-central, and Trans Pecos Texas. Plant fossils from the latter two localities tended to be poorly preserved.<ref name=\"50states-texas-267-268\" /> Very early [[reptile]] fossils are also known from the deposits of the Llano Uplift.<ref name=\"50states-texas-267\" />\n[[File:Dimetrodon8DB.jpg|thumb|right|125px|''[[Dimetrodon]]''.]]\n[[Permian]] fossils are widespread in Texas.<ref name=\"50states-texas-267-268\" /> The shallow seas occupying this region began to retreat during the Permian. Coastal lowland environments formed in their place. However, the far western edge of Texas was still covered in sea water. A notable reef system formed there in the area now occupied by the Guadalupe Mountains. A great variety of marine invertebrates lived here.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> Brachiopods, bryozoans, corals, and mollusks were preserved in what are now the [[Glass Mountains]].<ref name=\"50states-texas-267-268\" />  Local vertebrate life included sharks.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> In the North-Central Plains of Texas both marine and terrestrial fossils can be found. Invertebrates, [[amphibians]], and reptiles are all known. Author Marian Murray described the region as \"one of the finest collecting areas in the world for marine life\". More than 320 kinds of crinoids are known from the region and more than 50 different kinds of [[blastoids]] as well.<ref name=\"50states-texas-267-268\" /> Sharks left behind their teeth to fossilize during the Permian.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> Amphibians and reptiles were preserved in Archer and Baylor counties during the Permian.<ref name=\"50states-texas-269-270\" /> The [[Red Beds of Texas and Oklahoma|red beds]] from the region might be the best record of this time period in the world. ''[[Seymouria]]'', a twenty inch long transitional form documenting the origin of reptiles was preserved in the Permian sediments of Baylor County.<ref name=\"50states-texas-270\" /> Baylor County and nearby regions also preserve ''[[Dimetrodon]]'' and ''[[Edaphosaurus]]''.<ref name=\"50states-texas-270\" /> During the [[middle Permian]], Texas was hot with dry and wet seasons attested to by [[Dry lake|playa]] lake deposits. Fossil footprints left by small reptiles are common in these sediments.<ref name=\"dinotracksna-permian-39\" />\n[[File:Edaphosaurus pogonias.jpg|thumb|125px|left|''[[Edaphosaurus]]''.]]\n\nTexas was home to a massive river system during the [[Triassic]]. A variety of local amphibians and reptiles lived nearby.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> Triassic life in Texas also included plants and invertebrates, although their fossils tend to be poorly preserved. Sharks left behind their teeth to fossilize at this time.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> Vertebrates included [[fishes]] and relatives of modern [[crocodile]]s called [[phytosaur]]s.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> Triassic fossils were preserved in areas of western Texas like the Glass Mountains as well as the High Plains.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> The phytosaur fossils were preserved at the edge of the High Plains.<ref name=\"50states-texas-270\" /> There are very few rocks of [[Jurassic]] age in Texas.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> The only known Jurassic fossils of Texas come from the [[Malone Mountains]] which preserve [[ammonites]], gastropods, and pelecypods.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" />\n\nThe [[Cretaceous]], by contrast left a rich local fossil record. Due to the alternating rising and falling of local sea levels a variety of life from both land and sea would be preserved in its fossil record. Cretaceous vertebrate life of Texas included amphibians, birds, dinosaurs, fish, and reptiles.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> Almost a quarter of Texas is covered by [[Cretaceous]] rocks and are a good source of fossils.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> Most of Texas was submerged under the [[Western Interior Seaway]] during the Cretaceous.<ref name=\"oceans-oneday-5\"/> The most common Cretaceous fossils in Texas are cephalopods, echinoids, gastropods, and pelecypods.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> During the [[Early Cretaceous]] Texas was home to the [[pliosaurid]] ''[[Brachauchenius]]''. Western Interior Seaway researcher Michael J. Everhart has called it a \"true 'sea monster'\" of its time.<ref name=\"oceans-pliosaurs-polycotylids-143-144\" /> Sharks left behind their teeth to fossilize during the [[Early Cretaceous]].<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> The Cretaceous sharks of Texas were similar to those of [[Paleontology in Kansas|Kansas]].<ref name=\"oceans-othersharks-69\" /> The [[prehistoric bony fish]] of Texas are known largely from Cretaceous rocks. Fossils include mostly teeth, vertebrae, and scales, although sometimes well preserved skeletons are found in the Austin Chalk member.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> During the [[Turonian]] Texas was home to the fish ''[[Pachyrhizodus leptopsis]]''.<ref name=\"oceans-pachyrhizodus-83\" /> Early Cretaceous [[heart urchin]]s and [[biscuit urchin]]s. In places fossil [[sea cucumbers]] are abundant.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> During the late [[Albian]], from about 115 to 110 million years ago [[sauropods]] and [[theropods]] left many footprints in the sediments that would later come to compose the [[Glen Rose Formation]].<ref name=\"dinotracksna-brontosaurs-185\" /> The widely spaced limbs of the sauropod trackmakers suggest that they were likely [[brachiosaurids]].<ref name=\"dinotracksna-brontosaurs-186\" /> Most of the tracks were left on an ancient coastal plain bordering the ancient [[Gulf of Mexico]], although some were left in [[lagoonal sediments]] or [[intertidal areas]]. More than fifty different contemporary sites are known across Texas over. Paleontologists \"recogniz[e]\" two mega-tracksites in Texas with areas covering thousands of square miles.<ref name=\"dinotracksna-brontosaurs-191\" /> Texan marine invertebrates during the Late Cretaceous included [[belemnoids]] and abundant ostracods.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> Contemporary vertebrates included [[mosasaurs]] (preserved near [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]), short-necked [[plesiosaurs]] (preserved near [[Waco, Texas|Waco]]), and some icthyosaurs( Platypterygius) found in the Grayson Formation and Duck Creek Formation. <ref name=\"50states-texas-270\" /> Forty foot ''[[Tylosaurus]]'' swam over Texas during the [[Campanian]].<ref name=\"oceans-mosasaurs-169\" /> More sharks left behind their teeth to fossilize during the [[Late Cretaceous]].<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> The terrestrial flora of Late Cretaceous Texas left behind plant fossils in northern Texas.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" />\n\nDuring the early [[Cenozoic]], Texas was the site of significant [[volcanic eruptions]].<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> Ostracods remained common in the [[Tertiary]] seas of Texas. Segments left by [[ophiuroids]] are also common in rocks deposited in these [[Sea|marine]] environments. Other contemporary life included corals, [[clams]], and [[snails]]. These Tertiary fossils are known from the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]].<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> Sharks left behind their teeth to fossilize during the Tertiary.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> During the [[Oligocene]] [[camels]] were widespread in Texas.<ref name=\"50states-texas-270\" /> Mammals resembling giant [[pig]]s were preserved in the Miocene deposits of the Coastal Plain. Camels remained widespread in the state.<ref name=\"50states-texas-270\" /> Sharks left behind fossil teeth during the Miocene, but not during the later epochs of the Cenozoic.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> Camels maintained a continued presence as significant members of the fauna during the Pliocene.<ref name=\"50states-texas-270\" /> During the [[Pleistocene]] Texas was home to camels, [[horses]], [[mammoths]], and other animals. Their fossils are common.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> Horses in particular were widespread in Texas during the Pleistocene. Camels were also widespread but for the last time in Texas history.<ref name=\"50states-texas-270\" /> Fossils of this age from the Gulf Coast and western part of the state included the remains of creatures like bison, mammoths, and mastodons.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> Other [[Cenozoic]] mammals of Texas included [[glyptodonts]], mammoths, [[mastodons]], [[saber-toothed cat|saber teeth]], [[giant ground sloths]], [[titanotheres]], [[uintatheres]], and [[dire wolves]].<ref name=\"50states-texas-270\" />\n\n==History==\n<!-- ===Indigenous interpretations=== -->\n[[File:Acrocantosaurus4.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''[[Acrocanthosaurus]]''.]]\n[[Archaeologist]] [[Jack. T. Hughes]] has found evidence that the [[paleo-Indians]] of Texas collected fossils.<ref name=\"mayor-archaeology-166\" /><!-- ===Scientific research=== --> After the establishment of paleontology as a formal science, in 1878, professor [[Jacob Boll]] made the first scientifically documented Texan fossil finds in [[Archer County, Texas|Archer]] and [[Wichita County, Texas|Wichita counties]] while collecting fossils on behalf of [[Edward Drinker Cope]]. In 1880 [[W. E. Cummins]] began a series of expeditions into Texas and other regions of the American southwest. Like Boll, Cummins was collecting for Cope. [[C. H. Sternberg]] also did \"very successful\" fieldwork in Texas between 1896 and 1917.<ref name=\"50states-texas-265\" /> In 1938, [[Barnum Brown]] of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] sent [[Roland T. Bird]] to Texas in search of [[dinosaur footprints]] uncovered by local [[moonshine]]rs.<ref name=\"lonestar-range-4-5\" /> At the town of [[Glen Rose]] he noticed a medium sized footprint left by a carnivorous dinosaur in a limestone block forming part of the [[Somervell County]] courthouse's bandstand. Local residents guided him to yet further carnivorous dinosaur tracks preserved in situ along the [[Paluxy River]]. While he was cleaning mud from these footprints, he noticed another kind of footprint, apparently left by a long-necked [[sauropod]] dinosaur. Brown was intrigued by the find.<ref name=\"lonestar-range-5\" /> At the time, Dr. [[E. H. Sellards]] of the [[University of Texas]] was organizing the Texas Statewide Paleontological Survey. Brown arranged for a collaborative expedition between the American Museum of Natural History and the Survey.<ref name=\"lonestar-range-5-6\" /> In 1940, Bird resumed his Texas fieldwork with the help of paleontologists from the Survey and labor employed by the [[Works Progress Administration]].<ref name=\"lonestar-range-6\" /> Some of the tracks excavated here were sent to the American Museum of Natural History and incorporated into an exhibit featuring ''[[Allosaurus]]'' and ''[[Apatosaurus]]'' even though they were 35 million years older than the dinosaurs that left behind the tracks in Texas and aren't even known from the state.<ref name=\"lonestar-range-6-8\" /> Other track fossils uncovered during these excavations were sent to institutions like [[Baylor University]], [[Brooklyn College]], the [[United States National Museum]], [[Southern Methodist University]], and the [[University of Texas]].<ref name=\"lonestar-range-8\" /> In 1964 Bob Slaughter found two genera of [[mosasaurs]] south of [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] as well as [[Miocene]] and [[Pleistocene]] fossils from the [[Livingston Reservoir]] basin.<ref name=\"50states-texas-270\" /> In 1994, [[Bill Sarjeant]] and [[Wann Langston]] published a monograph documenting fossil footprints laid down in the [[volcanic ash]] of the [[Vieja Group]] 36 to 38 million years ago during the [[late Eocene]]. They observed the tracks of six birds, two invertebrates, nineteen mammals, and two turtles. Among the mammals were relatives of [[camels]] and [[tapirs]] as well as carnivores and insectivores.

Author Marian Murray has remarked that \"Texas is as big for [[fossil]]s as it is for everything else.\"<ref name=\"50states-texas-265\" /> Some of the most important fossil finds in [[Paleontology in the United States|United States]] history have come from Texas. Fossils can be found throughout most of the state.<ref name=\"50states-texas-265-266\" /> The [[fossil record]] of Texas spans almost the entire geologic column from [[Precambrian]] to [[Pleistocene]].<ref name=\"50states-texas-266\" /> [[Shark]] teeth are probably the state's most common fossil. During the early [[Paleozoic era]] Texas was covered by a sea that would later be home to creatures like [[brachiopod]]s, [[cephalopod]]s, [[graptolite]]s, and [[trilobite]]s. Little is known about the state's [[Devonian]] and early [[Carboniferous]] life. However, evidence indicates that during the late Carboniferous the state was home to marine life, land plants and early [[reptile]]s. During the [[Permian]], the seas largely shrank away, but nevertheless [[coral reef]]s formed in the state. The rest of Texas was a [[coastal plain]] inhabited by [[Synapsid|early relatives of]] [[mammals]] like ''[[Dimetrodon]]'' and ''[[Edaphosaurus]]''. During the [[Triassic]], a great river system formed in the state that was inhabited by [[crocodile]]-like [[phytosaurs]]. Little is known about [[Jurassic]] Texas, but there are fossil aquatic invertebrates of this age like [[ammonites]] in the state. During the [[Early Cretaceous]] local large [[sauropod]]s and [[theropod]]s left a great abundance of [[Dinosaur footprints|footprints]]. [[Late Cretaceous|Later]] in the [[Cretaceous]], the state was covered by the [[Western Interior Seaway]] and home to creatures like [[mosasaur]]s, [[plesiosaur]]s, and few icthyosaurs.  Early [[Cenozoic]] Texas still contained areas covered in seawater where invertebrates and [[shark]]s lived. On land the state would come to be home to creatures like [[glyptodont]]s, [[mammoth]]s, [[mastodon]]s, [[saber-toothed cat]]s, [[giant ground sloth]]s, [[titanothere]]s, [[uintathere]]s, and [[dire wolf|dire wolves]]. [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] evidence suggests that local [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] knew about local fossils. Formally trained scientists were already investigating the state's fossils by the late 1800s. In 1938, a major dinosaur footprint find occurred near [[Glen Rose]]. ''[[Pleurocoelus]]'' was the Texas [[state dinosaur]] from 1997 to 2009, when it was replaced by ''[[Paluxysaurus jonesi]]'' after the Texan fossils once referred to the former species were reclassified to a new [[genus]].\n\n==Prehistory==\n\nDuring the [[Cambrian]] period, Texas was covered by a sea.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> Cambrian life in Texas included [[brachiopod]]s, [[gastropod]]s, [[graptolite]]s, and [[trilobite]]s.<ref name=\"50states-texas-266-268\" /> Areas of Texas distant from the shore were home to [[bivalve]]s, brachiopods, [[sponge]]s, and trilobites.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" />  Contemporary graptolites were preserved in the central region of the state.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> Texan wildlife during the ensuing [[Ordovician]] period included brachiopods, [[cephalopod]]s,  [[coral]]s, gastropods, graptolites, sponges, and trilobites, although apart from the graptolites, these sorts of fossils tend to be poorly preserved.<ref name=\"50states-texas-267\" /> The graptolites were preserved in the Ordovician deposits of western Texas, especially some of the stratigraphic units of the [[Trans-Pecos]] region.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> In some places these graptolite fossils are common.<ref name=\"50states-texas-267\" /> The presence of these marine habitats distant from shore persisted into the [[Silurian]].<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> Few fossils were preserved locally during the former period.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> Silurian brachiopods and corals fossilized in the [[Van Horn, Texas|Van Horn]] and [[El Paso]] Regions.<ref name=\"50states-texas-267\" />\n\n[[Devonian]] Texas still contained marine habitats distant from shore.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> However, the state's Devonian rocks are buried below the surface and inaccessible apart from core drilling.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> Consequently the contemporary life is not well known.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> Known life of Devonian Texas includes brachiopods, [[bryozoan]]s, [[conodont]]s, corals, gastropods, [[radiolarian]]s and trilobites. Contemporary brachiopods were preserved in great abundance, however their fossils tend to be fragmentary. Their remains were preserved in the El Paso, Van Horn, [[Llano Uplift]], and [[Marathon, Texas|Marathon]] areas. Contemporary radiolarian fossils are also very common in the El Paso, Van Horn, and Marathon areas, and like the brachiopods, their fossils tend to be fragmentary. Fossils of the other listed taxa were preserved in the Llano Uplift area. Vertebrates included armored fishes, also preserved in the Llano Uplift.<ref name=\"50states-texas-267\" /> Contemporary [[placoderms]] were preserved in central Texas.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" />\n\nLike the state's Devonian rocks, those of [[Early Carboniferous]] age are buried below the surface and inaccessible apart from core drilling.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> Consequently the contemporary life is not well known.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> Texas was home to brachiopods, cephalopods, crinoids, gastropods, [[ostracods]], trilobites during the [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]]. Contemporary brachiopods were preserved in the [[Hueco Mountains]] of the Trans-Pecos Region and Llano Uplift. They tend to be the most common fossil in the Hueco Mountain sites. Contemporary bryozoan and gastropod fossils were preserved in the Hueco Mountains of the Trans-Pecos Region, but are less common. The other taxa's fossils were preserved in the Llano Uplift.<ref name=\"50states-texas-267\" />\n\nDuring the [[Late Carboniferous]] many fossils were preserved in the north-central part of the state.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> Texas had a fauna including [[algae]], brachiopods, corals, [[crinoids]], [[fusulinids]], gastropods, and [[pelecypods]] during the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] epoch. Pennsylvanian fossils are widespread in Texas. Pennsylvanian fossils of the listed taxa were preserved in both the [[Sierra Diablo Mountains|Diablo]] and Hueco Mountains.<ref name=\"50states-texas-267\" /> The Llano Uplift region also preserves Pennsylvanian fossils. The north-central region of the uplift is the best source. Pennsylvanian taxa preserved there included  brachiopods, branching bryozoans, lacy bryozoans, horn corals, other corals, crinoids, fusulinids, gastropods, [[goniatites]], [[nautiloids]], and pelecypods.<ref name=\"50states-texas-267\" /> The contemporary vertebrate fauna included [[sharks]], which left behind their teeth.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> Plant fossils were preserved in abundance in the Llano Uplift, north-central, and Trans Pecos Texas. Plant fossils from the latter two localities tended to be poorly preserved.<ref name=\"50states-texas-267-268\" /> Very early [[reptile]] fossils are also known from the deposits of the Llano Uplift.<ref name=\"50states-texas-267\" />\n[[File:Dimetrodon8DB.jpg|thumb|right|125px|''[[Dimetrodon]]''.]]\n[[Permian]] fossils are widespread in Texas.<ref name=\"50states-texas-267-268\" /> The shallow seas occupying this region began to retreat during the Permian. Coastal lowland environments formed in their place. However, the far western edge of Texas was still covered in sea water. A notable reef system formed there in the area now occupied by the Guadalupe Mountains. A great variety of marine invertebrates lived here.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> Brachiopods, bryozoans, corals, and mollusks were preserved in what are now the [[Glass Mountains]].<ref name=\"50states-texas-267-268\" />  Local vertebrate life included sharks.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> In the North-Central Plains of Texas both marine and terrestrial fossils can be found. Invertebrates, [[amphibians]], and reptiles are all known. Author Marian Murray described the region as \"one of the finest collecting areas in the world for marine life\". More than 320 kinds of crinoids are known from the region and more than 50 different kinds of [[blastoids]] as well.<ref name=\"50states-texas-267-268\" /> Sharks left behind their teeth to fossilize during the Permian.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> Amphibians and reptiles were preserved in Archer and Baylor counties during the Permian.<ref name=\"50states-texas-269-270\" /> The [[Red Beds of Texas and Oklahoma|red beds]] from the region might be the best record of this time period in the world. ''[[Seymouria]]'', a twenty inch long transitional form documenting the origin of reptiles was preserved in the Permian sediments of Baylor County.<ref name=\"50states-texas-270\" /> Baylor County and nearby regions also preserve ''[[Dimetrodon]]'' and ''[[Edaphosaurus]]''.<ref name=\"50states-texas-270\" /> During the [[middle Permian]], Texas was hot with dry and wet seasons attested to by [[Dry lake|playa]] lake deposits. Fossil footprints left by small reptiles are common in these sediments.<ref name=\"dinotracksna-permian-39\" />\n[[File:Edaphosaurus pogonias.jpg|thumb|125px|left|''[[Edaphosaurus]]''.]]\n\nTexas was home to a massive river system during the [[Triassic]]. A variety of local amphibians and reptiles lived nearby.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> Triassic life in Texas also included plants and invertebrates, although their fossils tend to be poorly preserved. Sharks left behind their teeth to fossilize at this time.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> Vertebrates included [[fishes]] and relatives of modern [[crocodile]]s called [[phytosaur]]s.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> Triassic fossils were preserved in areas of western Texas like the Glass Mountains as well as the High Plains.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> The phytosaur fossils were preserved at the edge of the High Plains.<ref name=\"50states-texas-270\" /> There are very few rocks of [[Jurassic]] age in Texas.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> The only known Jurassic fossils of Texas come from the [[Malone Mountains]] which preserve [[ammonites]], gastropods, and pelecypods.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" />\n\nThe [[Cretaceous]], by contrast left a rich local fossil record. Due to the alternating rising and falling of local sea levels a variety of life from both land and sea would be preserved in its fossil record. Cretaceous vertebrate life of Texas included amphibians, birds, dinosaurs, fish, and reptiles.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> Almost a quarter of Texas is covered by [[Cretaceous]] rocks and are a good source of fossils.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> Most of Texas was submerged under the [[Western Interior Seaway]] during the Cretaceous.<ref name=\"oceans-oneday-5\"/> The most common Cretaceous fossils in Texas are cephalopods, echinoids, gastropods, and pelecypods.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> During the [[Early Cretaceous]] Texas was home to the [[pliosaurid]] ''[[Brachauchenius]]''. Western Interior Seaway researcher Michael J. Everhart has called it a \"true 'sea monster'\" of its time.<ref name=\"oceans-pliosaurs-polycotylids-143-144\" /> Sharks left behind their teeth to fossilize during the [[Early Cretaceous]].<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> The Cretaceous sharks of Texas were similar to those of [[Paleontology in Kansas|Kansas]].<ref name=\"oceans-othersharks-69\" /> The [[prehistoric bony fish]] of Texas are known largely from Cretaceous rocks. Fossils include mostly teeth, vertebrae, and scales, although sometimes well preserved skeletons are found in the Austin Chalk member.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> During the [[Turonian]] Texas was home to the fish ''[[Pachyrhizodus leptopsis]]''.<ref name=\"oceans-pachyrhizodus-83\" /> Early Cretaceous [[heart urchin]]s and [[biscuit urchin]]s. In places fossil [[sea cucumbers]] are abundant.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> During the late [[Albian]], from about 115 to 110 million years ago [[sauropods]] and [[theropods]] left many footprints in the sediments that would later come to compose the [[Glen Rose Formation]].<ref name=\"dinotracksna-brontosaurs-185\" /> The widely spaced limbs of the sauropod trackmakers suggest that they were likely [[brachiosaurids]].<ref name=\"dinotracksna-brontosaurs-186\" /> Most of the tracks were left on an ancient coastal plain bordering the ancient [[Gulf of Mexico]], although some were left in [[lagoonal sediments]] or [[intertidal areas]]. More than fifty different contemporary sites are known across Texas over. Paleontologists \"recogniz[e]\" two mega-tracksites in Texas with areas covering thousands of square miles.<ref name=\"dinotracksna-brontosaurs-191\" /> Texan marine invertebrates during the Late Cretaceous included [[belemnoids]] and abundant ostracods.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> Contemporary vertebrates included [[mosasaurs]] (preserved near [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]), short-necked [[plesiosaurs]] (preserved near [[Waco, Texas|Waco]]), and some icthyosaurs( Platypterygius) found in the Grayson Formation and Duck Creek Formation. <ref name=\"50states-texas-270\" /> Forty foot ''[[Tylosaurus]]'' swam over Texas during the [[Campanian]].<ref name=\"oceans-mosasaurs-169\" /> More sharks left behind their teeth to fossilize during the [[Late Cretaceous]].<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> The terrestrial flora of Late Cretaceous Texas left behind plant fossils in northern Texas.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" />\n\nDuring the early [[Cenozoic]], Texas was the site of significant [[volcanic eruptions]].<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> Ostracods remained common in the [[Tertiary]] seas of Texas. Segments left by [[ophiuroids]] are also common in rocks deposited in these [[Sea|marine]] environments. Other contemporary life included corals, [[clams]], and [[snails]]. These Tertiary fossils are known from the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]].<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> Sharks left behind their teeth to fossilize during the Tertiary.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> During the [[Oligocene]] [[camels]] were widespread in Texas.<ref name=\"50states-texas-270\" /> Mammals resembling giant [[pig]]s were preserved in the Miocene deposits of the Coastal Plain. Camels remained widespread in the state.<ref name=\"50states-texas-270\" /> Sharks left behind fossil teeth during the Miocene, but not during the later epochs of the Cenozoic.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> Camels maintained a continued presence as significant members of the fauna during the Pliocene.<ref name=\"50states-texas-270\" /> During the [[Pleistocene]] Texas was home to camels, [[horses]], [[mammoths]], and other animals. Their fossils are common.<ref name=\"50states-texas-268\" /> Horses in particular were widespread in Texas during the Pleistocene. Camels were also widespread but for the last time in Texas history.<ref name=\"50states-texas-270\" /> Fossils of this age from the Gulf Coast and western part of the state included the remains of creatures like bison, mammoths, and mastodons.<ref name=\"texas-paleoportal-general\" /> Other [[Cenozoic]] mammals of Texas included [[glyptodonts]], mammoths, [[mastodons]], [[saber-toothed cat|saber teeth]], [[giant ground sloths]], [[titanotheres]], [[uintatheres]], and [[dire wolves]].<ref name=\"50states-texas-270\" />\n\n==History==\n<!-- ===Indigenous interpretations=== -->\n[[File:Acrocantosaurus4.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''[[Acrocanthosaurus]]''.]]\n[[Archaeologist]] [[Jack. T. Hughes]] has found evidence that the [[paleo-Indians]] of Texas collected fossils.<ref name=\"mayor-archaeology-166\" /><!-- ===Scientific research=== --> After the establishment of paleontology as a formal science, in 1878, professor [[Jacob Boll]] made the first scientifically documented Texan fossil finds in [[Archer County, Texas|Archer]] and [[Wichita County, Texas|Wichita counties]] while collecting fossils on behalf of [[Edward Drinker Cope]]. In 1880 [[W. E. Cummins]] began a series of expeditions into Texas and other regions of the American southwest. Like Boll, Cummins was collecting for Cope. [[C. H. Sternberg]] also did \"very successful\" fieldwork in Texas between 1896 and 1917.<ref name=\"50states-texas-265\" /> In 1938, [[Barnum Brown]] of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] sent [[Roland T. Bird]] to Texas in search of [[dinosaur footprints]] uncovered by local [[moonshine]]rs.<ref name=\"lonestar-range-4-5\" /> At the town of [[Glen Rose]] he noticed a medium sized footprint left by a carnivorous dinosaur in a limestone block forming part of the [[Somervell County]] courthouse's bandstand. Local residents guided him to yet further carnivorous dinosaur tracks preserved in situ along the [[Paluxy River]]. While he was cleaning mud from these footprints, he noticed another kind of footprint, apparently left by a long-necked [[sauropod]] dinosaur. Brown was intrigued by the find.<ref name=\"lonestar-range-5\" /> At the time, Dr. [[E. H. Sellards]] of the [[University of Texas]] was organizing the Texas Statewide Paleontological Survey. Brown arranged for a collaborative expedition between the American Museum of Natural History and the Survey.<ref name=\"lonestar-range-5-6\" /> In 1940, Bird resumed his Texas fieldwork with the help of paleontologists from the Survey and labor employed by the [[Works Progress Administration]].<ref name=\"lonestar-range-6\" /> Some of the tracks excavated here were sent to the American Museum of Natural History and incorporated into an exhibit featuring ''[[Allosaurus]]'' and ''[[Apatosaurus]]'' even though they were 35 million years older than the dinosaurs that left behind the tracks in Texas and aren't even known from the state.<ref name=\"lonestar-range-6-8\" /> Other track fossils uncovered during these excavations were sent to institutions like [[Baylor University]], [[Brooklyn College]], the [[United States National Museum]], [[Southern Methodist University]], and the [[University of Texas]].<ref name=\"lonestar-range-8\" /> In 1964 Bob Slaughter found two genera of [[mosasaurs]] south of [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] as well as [[Miocene]] and [[Pleistocene]] fossils from the [[Livingston Reservoir]] basin.<ref name=\"50states-texas-270\" /> In 1994, [[Bill Sarjeant]] and [[Wann Langston]] published a monograph documenting fossil footprints laid down in the [[volcanic ash]] of the [[Vieja Group]] 36 to 38 million years ago during the [[late Eocene]]. They observed the tracks of six birds, two invertebrates, nineteen mammals, and two turtles. Among the mammals were relatives of [[camels]] and [[tapirs]] as well as carnivores and insectivores.

He initially worked in Collector Office in Ahmedabad and later joined M/s Lawrence Company in Bombay in 1863 (now [[Mumbai]]) as a representative of Bahechardas Ambaidas, a businessman from Ahmedabad. He also worked as a representative of [[Gondal State|Gondal]], [[Palanpur State|Palanpur]] and [[Idar State|Idar]] states in Bombay. He befriended [[Mansukhram Tripathi]] there. He was awarded Huzoor Assistant by [[Khengarji III]] of [[Cutch State]] and later appointed as a minister (Diwan). He retired in 1904. He was the president of  [[Gujarati Sahitya Parishad]] in the year 1912 in [[Vadodara]]. He was awarded Dewan Bahadur by British Government in 1915.

So he decided to come up with pure and sober Gujarati plays. He had written ten original and four adapted plays from Sanskrit literature. He borrowed from Sanskrit plays and also used mythological themes. He wrote plays on social and moral issues and some of these plays were performed in Bombay by Parsi theatre which caught attention of people. He first published his play in Gujarati monthly ''[[Buddhiprakash]]'' in serialized manner. The name of this play was ''Jaykumari-Vijay'' (1864). It is considered as the first modern love-story of Gujarati. It featured educated lead girl. It became very popular in Gujarat.  ''Lalita Dukh Darsak'' (1866) is a great example of his themes and his ability to address social reforms in his work. It was about an educated girl marrying an illiterate boy and thus passing through social and emotional trial which at the end result in his death. It became very popular and people shed tears at the performance. Nandan, the name of the illiterate boy, became synonymous for a heartless [[rake (character)|rake]].

So he decided to come up with pure and sober Gujarati plays. He had written ten original and four adapted plays from Sanskrit literature. He borrowed from Sanskrit plays and also used mythological themes. He wrote plays on social and moral issues and some of these plays were performed in Bombay by Parsi theatre which caught attention of people. He first published his play in Gujarati monthly ''[[Buddhiprakash]]'' in serialized manner. The name of this play was ''Jaykumari-Vijay'' (1864). It is considered as the first modern love-story of Gujarati. It featured educated lead girl. It became very popular in Gujarat.  ''Lalita Dukh Darsak'' (1866) is a great example of his themes and his ability to address social reforms in his work. It was about an educated girl marrying an illiterate boy and thus passing through social and emotional trial which at the end result in his death. It became very popular and people shed tears at the performance. Nandan, the name of the illiterate boy, became synonymous for a heartless [[rake (character)|rake]]. He also wrote mythological play called ''Harishchandra'' (1871) which was seen and lauded by [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. His other plays are  ''Taramatiswayamvar'' (1871),  ''Premrai Ane Charumati'' (1876), ''Bhanasur Madmardan'' (1878), ''Madalasa ane Hritudhwaj'' (1878), ''Nala-Damatanti'' (1893), ''Nindya Shringarnishedhak Roopak'' (1920), ''Verno Vanse Vashyo Varso'' (1922), ''Vanthel Virhana Kunda Krutyo'' (1923).
