The sample was divided into genuine necrophiliacs, who had a persistent attraction to corpses, and pseudo-necrophiliacs, who acted out of opportunity, sadism, or transient interest.  Of the total, 92% were male and 8% were female. 57% of the genuine necrophiliacs had occupational access to corpses, with morgue attendants, hospital orderly, and cemetery employees being the most common jobs. The researchers theorized that either of the following situations could be antecedents to necrophilia:<ref name=\"rosman\" />\n#The necrophile develops poor [[self-esteem]], perhaps due in part to a significant loss;\n#:(a) They are very fearful of rejection by others and they desire a sexual partner who is incapable of rejecting them; and/or\n#:(b) They are fearful of the dead, and transform their fear\u2014by means of [[reaction formation]]\u2014into a desire.\n#They develop an exciting fantasy of sex with a corpse, sometimes after exposure to a corpse.\n\n====Motives====\nThe most common motive for necrophiliacs is the possession of a partner who is unresisting or unrejecting.

She worked as an apprentice embalmer in Sacramento, California. On 17 December 1979, she stole the hearse along with the body of a 33-year-old man that was inside. She was sentenced to pay a $255 fine and 11 days in prison.\n\nIn 1987, Greenlee gave a detailed interview called \u201cThe Unrepentant Necrophile''\u201d for Jim Morton's (edited by [[Adam Parfrey|Adam Parafrey]]) book ''Apocalypse Culture''. In this interview, she stated that she had a preference for younger men and was attracted to the smell of blood and death. She considered necrophilia an addiction. The interview was held in her apartment, which was apparently a small studio filled with books, necrophilic drawings, and satanic adornments. She also had written a confession letter in which she claimed to have abused 20\u201340 male corpses.<ref>{{Citation|last=Crafford|first=J.

In 1978, Nilsen committed his first murder and enjoyed intercourse with the victim's corpse, keeping the body for months before disposal.

Harry wants very much to impress others with his magical skills; unfortunately, though inventive, he is far less talented and lucky in pulling off magic than his mischievous former stage rabbit, Bunnie, who steals his [[magic wand]] in the first episode, becoming the school's star pupil. Thereafter Bunny seems always to steal Harry's limelight. Harry is largely motivated by his desire to regain the magic wand and to humiliate Bunnie, and is very unscrupulous in how he attempts to do so. Nevertheless, Harry will occasionally team up with Bunnie if they are threatened by a common danger (such as the school's security guard); sometimes Harry will even display a soft side and go so far as to cooperate with Bunnie to do some charitable act, such as rescuing a baby Yeti or delivering toys to children. Harry has [[Navy blue|dark blue]] eyes and hair (a [[running gag]] in the show is for his [[quiff]] to become mussed and for Harry to tease it desperately back into place) and wears a magician's black [[tailcoat]] with the sleeves rolled up at the elbows, a black [[bowtie]], a red [[cummerbund]], dark gray trousers, and red [[sneakers]].\n\n*  '''Bunnie''' \u2014 A naughty rabbit that used to be Harry's magic prop in his performance. Having stolen Harry's magic wand after considerable provocation, he thereafter becomes the magical school's best student, and the favorite of the Headmistress, Penny. Bunnie has a ravenous appetite for carrots (indeed, Harry's having deprived Bunnie of his carrot was the original cause of their quarrel), though he quickly appears to develop almost as great an appetite for humiliating Harry, whom he will frequently taunt by waggling his tongue at the boy while pointing at it with one of his ears. Bunnie appears to be very popular with his fellow students; later in the series, he develops a romance with a [[Shades_of_pink#Light_hot_pink|pink]] kitten named Katty. Bunnie is a white rabbit with a brace on his front teeth, dark blue eyes, a [[sky blue]] shirt with a [[Shades_of_yellow#Light_yellow|pale yellow]] stripe, a black bow tie, and black shorts.\n\n==Recurring==\n\n===Faculty and Staff===\n* '''Penny''' \u2014 Headmistress of the magical school. She appears to be a skillful magician, a strict disciplinarian (she has a tendency to restore order by blowing an [[airhorn]]), and a good teacher, who takes her pupils on numerous field trips and outings. She is particularly fond of Bunnie, whereas she appears to have a grudge against Harry\u2014most likely because of his continual destruction of property, both the school's and her own\u2014though she shows an unexpected tenderness for him when he is turned into a baby. Penny has scanty gray hair, glasses, [[dentures]] (several episodes revolve around her desire for new and better ones), and a rather hunched figure; she wears a bejeweled [[turban]], gold earrings and bracelets, and a [[Shades_of_violet#Wisteria|wisteria violet]] and [[magenta]] robe; her wand is [[Shades_of_yellow#Gold_(golden)|gold-colored]] with an [[Shades_of_green#Emerald|emerald green]] crystal on the end. \n\n* '''The Security Guard''' \u2014 He ruthlessly enforces discipline for the school. The guard shows absolutely no favoritism and is just as likely to thwart Bunnie as he is Harry or any other student, though Harry does have a particular tendency to provoke him, particularly when he is off duty. The Guard is a husky, muscular man with a thick black mustache and frizzy black hair; he usually wears a blue uniform.\n\n* '''The Female Teacher''' \u2014 \n\n* '''The Male Teacher''' \u2014\n\n===Students===\n* '''Bob''' \u2014 A male student; he is strong and continually hungry, often shown consuming over-sized [[hero sandwich|hero sandwiches]].

According to Nate Fox, the game's director, the team distilled the game's numerous internal pitches into \"the fantasy of becoming a samurai\" during conceptualization.<ref name=\"waypoint\"/> To ensure that the title would be an accurate representation of feudal Japan, Sucker Punch consulted cultural experts and sent an audio team to Japan to record different sounds, including [[birdsongs]].

According to Nate Fox, the game's director, the team distilled the game's numerous internal pitches into \"the fantasy of becoming a samurai\" during conceptualization.<ref name=\"waypoint\"/> To ensure that the title would be an accurate representation of feudal Japan, Sucker Punch consulted cultural experts and sent an audio team to Japan to record different sounds, including [[birdsongs]].

Cheaper versions were then produced, including laminated chipboard, high-pressure laminates and steel boards with a matte-finished or glossy white, usually polyester or acrylic, coating. Enameled whiteboards, also referred to as porcelain, and sometimes glass boards, have the advantage that markings can be erased completely; other materials tend to become stained over time. Enameled boards are more expensive and less used in commercial environments, but in more demanding environments with heavier use, such as educational establishments, porcelain boards are considered superior.\n\nOther types of dry marker boards are also available, such as high gloss vinyl and [[coated paper]], which can be rolled up, high-density two-part high gloss paints, glass and coated acrylics and polypropylene magic whiteboards which use static electricity to cling to walls, windows, and doors.\n\nClear marker surfaces, made of glass (matte or glossy) or specially coated acrylic, became available around the [[2000s (decade)|mid-2000s]]. They are generally manufactured from technical glass, e.g. for monitor screen filters, which is optically coated.\n\n=== Adhesive whiteboards ===\nWhiteboard material can be bought in rolls, sheets, and pre-formed boards. Adhesive whiteboards come in either a sheet or a roll and feature a stick back enabling the user to create a custom size board or project with the material. Although adhesive whiteboard material does not come in a thick, hard glass or painted steel plate, the melamine allows for a flexible material while preserving the high-quality whiteboard attributes of other surface materials.<ref name=\":0\" /> Adhesive whiteboards allow for custom projects such as dry erase wall calendars, whiteboard tables, cupboard grocery lists, indoor games for kids, and more.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.discountmagnet.com/informationcenter/resources/5-ways-to-use-whiteboards|title=5 Creative Ways to Use Dry Erase & Adhesive Whiteboards|website=www.discountmagnet.com|access-date=2016-10-17}}</ref>\n\n=== Erasable marker ===\nThe whiteboard pen (also called a [[whiteboard marker]] or dry erasable marker) was invented by Jerry Woolf of Techform Laboratories and later patented by [[Pilot Pen]] in 1975. <ref>{{cite patent|title=Writing surface and ink composition for marking thereon|date=Feb 16, 1971|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US3563782|inventor-last=D|inventor2-last=U|inventor3-last=A|inventor-first=Atchley Raymond|inventor2-first=Liberman Isaiah|inventor3-first=Woolf Jerome|issue=US3563782 A|accessdate=2017-08-14}}</ref>It is a non-permanent marker and uses an erasable ink that adheres to the writing surface without binding to or being absorbed by it. Applications range from temporary writing with acetate sheets (for use with overhead projectors) to whiteboards and similar glossy surfaces. The erasable ink does not contain the toxic chemical compounds xylene and/or toluene, unlike permanent markers.\n\n== Surface materials ==\nThere are six types of materials commonly used for whiteboard surfaces:\n\n; [[Melamine resin|Melamine]]: A [[resin]]-infused paper which is typically used over a substrate that can range from particle board to MDF (medium density fiberboard).  Melamine boards range in quality primarily because of the amount of resin deposited on the base material.  Some melamine boards remain clean (no ghosting) for a long time, others less so.  Generally, this least expensive type of whiteboard is most commonly found in use in non-institutional applications.  They are available in any [[office supply]] stores. Performance varies widely. These boards are not suitable for heavy use, as in many educational cases, with time the paint erodes and the original surface reappears.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title=How It works|url=https://www.remarkablecoating.com/how-it-works/|website=Remarkable Coating|accessdate=21 October 2015}}</ref>\n;  [[Steel]] or [[aluminum]]: Painted steel and aluminum dry erase also have a wide range of quality.  Painted surfaces tend to be smoother, which leads to better methods of erasing.  The painted surface is generally a multiple layer of coatings made up of a base coat in color (most commonly white) and a clear performance coating that is the dry erase component.  Paint varies from electron beam cured coatings to UV and other coating systems.  Good commercial grade painted steel or aluminum has excellent dry erase properties and many will be able to have permanent marker cleaned from the surface.  Any coated surface is susceptible to scratching.  Painted steel surfaces are magnetic and allow the use of magnets. Painted aluminum surfaces are rarely used as a base for whiteboards as they are not magnetic and are more expensive than steel.  Painted steel whiteboards are most commonly used for custom printed whiteboards.  These products are used as tracking boards, patient information boards and tournament and training boards.\n; Hardcoat laminate: Here again the performance varies over a wide range depending on the amount of resin used in the manufacturer.  Basically, this category primarily uses melamine as its dry erase performance coat and therefore falls into the melamine universe.  Depending on the manufacturer (and the price) these laminate often are less porous and highly resistant to staining. Less common than other whiteboard surfaces, because they usually are used in combination with something else (a cabinet, doors or table tops for example). (This statement applies to Porcelain steel which is the only lifetime warranty available on the market)\n; [[Porcelain]], [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]]-on-[[steel]]: [[Ceramic]] fired onto a steel surface in a kiln.  They are the most durable surfaces, and most carry a lifetime [[warranty]].  They are very common in heavy-use industrial settings. They are highly scratch-resistant, although materials harder than glass, such as [[diamond]], can scratch them. They do not absorb dry erase or permanent marker ink.  They allow the use of [[magnets]].  The surface can be cleaned with any non-abrasive cleaner suitable for porcelain, then rinsed off with water to prevent smearing.  Permanent marker can be removed using a polar solvent such as ethanol, isopropanol or acetone, or by writing over it with a dry-erase marker and erasing it.\n; Tempered glass:[[Tempered glass]] is easier to erase.  Most tempered glass white boards have no frame.\n; [[Polypropylene]] film: Polypropylene film is temporary and uses [[static electricity]] to cling to existing surfaces. It works with dry whiteboard markers and wipes. Whiteboards are reusable and materials are recyclable.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Grease pencil]]\n*[[Flip chart]]\n*[[Album (Ancient Rome)]], a board chalked or painted white, on which public notices were inscribed in black\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category|Whiteboards}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Office equipment]]\n[[Category:Writing media]]\n[[Category:Educational devices]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|physical whiteboards|software-based wipeboards|Wipeboarding}}\n{{refimprove|date=July 2007}}\n[[File:Blank whiteboard.JPG|thumb|A blank whiteboard]]\n[[File:NCTR Intern Claire Boyle (15558843862).jpg|thumb|Researcher writing on a whiteboard]]\n\nA '''whiteboard''' (also known by the terms '''marker board''', '''dry-erase board''', '''wipe board''', '''dry-wipe board''', and '''pen-board''') is a glossy, usually white surface for making nonpermanent markings (an evolved version of the blackboard).
