O'Brien had planned to make ''The Valley of Gwangi'' decades earlier but died in 1962 before it could be realized.\n\nProducer Charles Scheer called it \" probably the least of the movies Ray and I made together.\"<ref>Swires p 67</ref>\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be set between 400-700 words. -->\nIn [[Mexico]] at the turn of the 20th century, a cowgirl named T.J. Breckenridge hosts a struggling rodeo. Her former lover, Tuck Kirby, a heroic former stuntman working for [[Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show]], wants to buy her out. Along the way, he is followed by a Mexican boy named Lope, who intends to join the rodeo on a quest for fame and fortune. T.J. is not interested in Tuck because of this, but Tuck is still attracted to T.J., especially when T.J. jumps off a diving board on her horse. T.J. finally accepts Tuck when he saves Lope from a bull and the two kiss.\n\nT.J. has an ace she hopes will boost attendance at her show - a tiny horse called El Diablo. Tuck meets a British [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] named Horace Bromley, who is working in a nearby Mexican desert. Bromley shows Tuck [[fossil]]ized horse tracks, and Tuck notes their similarity to El Diablo's feet. Tuck sneaks Bromley into the circus for a look at El Diablo, and Bromley declares the horse to be a [[prehistory|prehistoric]] ''[[Eohippus]]''.\n\nThe tiny horse came from a place known as the Forbidden Valley. A gypsy known as Tia Zorina claims that the horse is cursed, and demands that it be immediately returned. Later, she and the other gypsies collaborate with Bromley to steal El Diablo and release it back in the valley. Bromley hopes to follow the horse to its home in search of other prehistoric specimens. Carlos, an ex-member of the Gypsy tribe now working for T.J.'s circus, walks in on the theft and tries to stop it, but is knocked out.\n\nTuck arrives just as the Gypsy posse leaves. Carlos sees him as he is regaining consciousness. Tuck notices that the horse is missing, and sets off after Bromley. When T.J. and her crew discover Carlos, Carlos claims that Tuck has stolen El Diablo for himself. Carlos, T.J., and the others decide to follow Tuck and Bromley into the valley.\n\nMaking their way into the Forbidden Valley, Tuck, T.J., and the rest of the group meet up and soon discover why the valley is said to be cursed when a ''[[Pteranodon]]'' swoops down and snatches Lope but due to the weight it falls back to the ground. After Carlos kills the ''Pteranodon'' by twisting its neck, they spot an ''[[Ornithomimus]]'', which they chase after in the hopes of capturing it. Just as it is about to escape, it is killed by Gwangi, a vicious ''[[Allosaurus]]'' which chases Bromley and the rest of the group. However, a ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' appears and drives Gwangi away. As Gwangi leaves, he takes the dead ''Pteranodon'' with him.\n\nLater, Gwangi pursues the group to their base camp and they try to rope him down, but he breaks free when the ''Styracosaurus'' reappears. Gwangi battles and kills the ''Styracosaurus'' and later manages to catch and kill Carlos, but is knocked out by a rockslide while trying to exit the valley in pursuit of the rest of the group.\n\nSecuring the creature with ropes, Tuck and the other men in the group take Gwangi back to town to be put on display in T.J.'s show. On the opening day of the show, the dwarfed Gypsy sneaks in and begins to unlock Gwangi's cage in an effort to free him, only to be killed when Gwangi breaks free. The crowd begins to flee as Gwangi attacks, and Tia Zorina is trampled to death in the chaos. Bromley is crushed by a broken piece of the cage, and Gwangi attacks and kills a circus [[elephant]] before rampaging through the town. Tuck, accompanied by T.J. and Lope, tries to hide the crowd in a cathedral, but Gwangi finds them and breaks in. Tuck urges the crowd out through a back exit, leaving Tuck inside with Gwangi, T.J. and Lope.\n\nThough Gwangi tries to eat them, he is distracted when the cathedral's organ is accidentally sounded off as Tuck falls backwards into the keyboard. Tuck then manages to wound the dinosaur with a flag and throws a torch onto the floor near Gwangi, setting the building on fire. Tuck and the others manage to escape, leaving Gwangi trapped in the burning, collapsing building. Shrieking in agony, Gwangi is finally crushed to death by the falling debris, as Tuck, T.J., Lope (with tears in his eyes), and the townspeople look on.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Franciscus]] as Tuck\n* [[Gila Golan]] as T.J.\n* [[Richard Carlson (actor)|Richard Carlson]] as Champ\n* [[Laurence Naismith]] as Professor Bromley\n* [[Freda Jackson]] as Tia Zorina\n* [[Gustavo Rojo]] as Carlos\n* Dennis Kilbane as Rowdy\n* Mario De Barros as Bean (as Mario de Barros)\n* Curtis Arden as Lope\n\n==Development==\n''Gwangi'' was originally conceived by [[Willis O'Brien]] (1886-1962), the man who created the special effects for the original ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933). The plot was inspired by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's book ''[[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]'' (1912), with added elements from ''King Kong'' (capturing a creature and bringing it to civilization where it runs amok). \n\nIn O'Brien's scenario, then called ''Valley of the Mists'', cowboys discover an [[Allosaurus]] in the Grand Canyon. After finally roping the dinosaur, they put it in a Wild West show but the creature, now called \"Gwangi\", breaks free and fights lions from the show that have also escaped. After killing the lions, Gwangi goes on a rampage around the town and is run off a cliff by a man in a truck. \n\nO'Brien worked on the project at RKO during most of 1942. The studio cancelled the production reportedly because of research done that the public did not want to see a picture about dinosaurs.<ref>Creating Dinosaurs for BABY Lee, Nora. American Cinematographer; Hollywood Vol. 67, Iss. 3,  (Mar 1985): 57-63. </ref> \n\nAccording to Harryhausen the project \"didn't get to the shooting stage. They built a series of Dioramas in three-dimensional cardboard cutouts for each set-up.

New York Times 26 June 1955: X5.</ref>\n===Ray Harryhausen===\nIn the late 1960s [[Ray Harryhausen]] and producer Charles Schneer decided to reunited after several years of making films apart. Harryhausen suggested reviving two old O'Brien projects, ''War Eagles'', which had been developed for MGM, and ''Gwangi'' which had been done for RKO. Schneer did not see how they could get a script out of ''War Eagles'' but was enthusiastic about the ''Gwangi'' script and bought the rights from O'Brien's widow.<ref>Swires p 66</ref>\n\nSchneer had the script rewritten by William Bast and offered the project to Columbia, who had made all Scheer's previous collaborations with Harryhausen. The studio turned it down by Warner Bros agreed to finance. James O'Connelly signed to direct.<ref>Swires p 66</ref>\n\nHarryhausen said they decided to set the film in the past to eliminate \"cliches about the army moving in with tanks and missiles.\" <ref>Newsom p 28</ref>\n\nGwangi was described in O'Brien's original script as an ''Allosaurus'', although O'Brien apparently did not draw much distinction between ''Allosaurus'' and ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', as he also referred to the ''Tyrannosaurus'' in the original King Kong (modeled by Marcel Delgado) as an \"''Allosaurus''\". According to Ray Harryhausen, his own version of Gwangi (and O'Brien's Gwangi too, as well as Delgado's ''Tyrannosaurus'') was based on a [[Charles R. Knight]] painting of a ''Tyrannosaurus'' - one of the two most famous paintings by Knight, and one that is instantly recognizable by the eye being placed too far forward on the skull (this was based on concurrently incomplete skeletal remains and the eye was mistakenly placed in one of the [[Antorbital fenestra|antorbital fenestrae]]), as well as ultimately and incorrectly portraying Tyrannosaurus with a three-fingered hand. This famous Tyrannosaurus image is also reflected in Harryhausen's \"Rhedosaurus\" in ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]''. In an interview featured on the 'Valley of Gwangi' DVD, Harryhausen said \"We sometimes called it an ''Allosaurus''... They're both meat eaters, they're both Tyrants... one was just a bit larger than the other.\" Gwangi was scaled to be 14 feet tall, within the size range of an average adult ''Tyrannosaurus'' (although not the largest), and at the upper limit of the largest ''Allosaurus'' specimens.\n\n==Special effects==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2013}}\n''The Valley of Gwangi'' was the last dinosaur-themed film that Harryhausen animated, and he made much use of his experience in depicting extinct animals from his earlier films. Close to a year was spent on the special effects (there were more than 300 'Dynamation' cuts in the film, a record number for Harryhausen), with the roping of Gwangi being the most labor-intensive animated sequence. It was achieved by having the actors hold on to ropes tied to a \"monster stick\" that was in the back of a jeep. The jeep and stick when filmed with Gwangi are on a back rear projection plate and hidden by his body, and the portions of rope attached to his body are painted wires that are matched with the real ropes. The coordination of Gwangi's animation with live actors on horseback (and the horses appearing to react to Gwangi) was particularly difficult to film, and the source of an editorial lapse in a following scene. Gwangi bites through the ropes around his neck when first lassoed and later has his jaws roped together when unconscious. However, he is then shown being transported in a cart again held only by ropes around his neck but with jaws now un-bound.\n\nThe first animated sequence in the film is a diving act done by T.J. and her horse. Because it was decided that it was too risky to have a rider and horse jump off a 40-foot high platform into a tank of water, a model horse and rider were used. After tempting Gila Golan's horse to jump from a mock-up platform onto a trampoline, the film cut to an animated model suspended on wires (actually it was just a tiny toy horse and rider bought in a toy store). The splash was real, triggered by an electric charge inside the tank.\n\nAfter local Gypsies steal the ''[[Eohippus]]'', it is released back into the Forbidden Valley. For all the scenes where the cowboys are chasing the creature, the animated model was used. However, in one long shot, a baby goat was used instead because the model would have been too small.\n\nThe [[pterosaur]]s were mistakenly given bat's wings (with elongate fingers supporting the membrane; pterosaurs had one finger forming the wing's leading edge but none on the membrane). The wings appear to mimic those of a pterosaur from an earlier Harryhausen film, ''[[One Million Years B.C.]]'' (1966). Close-up sequences of the pterosaurs in Gwangi were provided by life-size models. For the scene when Lope is snatched from his horse by the ''[[Pteranodon]]'', the boy was raised by wires painted out in the studio and Harryhausen animated the eight-inch-high model pterosaur to correspond with his movements. However, once the creature gets up to a certain altitude the real boy was replaced with a model which was used until he crawls away from the creature which is being killed by Carlos on the ground. Bromley the [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] mistakenly calls it a ''[[Pterodactylus|pterodactyl]]'' (a common error) while he is inspecting it on the ground.\n\nThe scene where Gwangi pounces on the ''[[Ornithomimus]]'' has been copied many times in dinosaur films, primarily in [[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]], when the ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' pounces on the ''[[Gallimimus]]''. The smaller dinosaur had never appeared on the film screen before and although its movements were unlikely it was one of Harryhausen's favorite sequences in the film. The battle between Gwangi and the ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' features battle moves such as biting, stabbing, butting, and pinning. After Gwangi is captured, he is wheeled back to town in a cart; and for several of the long shots of this scene the crew built and used a full-sized mock-up of Gwangi, again because an actual model would have been far too small.\n\nHarryhausen originally planned to have used a real elephant in some of the scenes for the fight with Gwangi. This did not work out because he wanted to have used a 15-foot tall elephant (the world's biggest elephant was two feet shorter than this). So the live 8-foot elephant was only used in the beginning when a woman is seen briefly riding on its back. For some of the elephant fight scenes Harryhausen used the animation table as the bullring floor.<ref>Excerpts taken from ''Ray Harryhausen: An Animated Life, ''ch 8, pgs 204-212)</ref>\n\nFor Gwangi's death scene a number of special effects were used. When the torch hits the ground near Gwangi, the flames are seen quickly developing and surrounding Gwangi. The flames were added in by double printing the camera. The outside of the burning church was a mixture of composites: the lower half was the real church photographed on location in [[Spain]], and the upper, burning half was a miniature, again added in by double printing the camera.\n\nThe model of the ''[[Eohippus]]'' was supposed to have toes but appears to have regular hooves with 'toes' painted on (the sound effects of the animal moving also resemble hooves). The model of the ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' featured an inflatable air 'bladder' to simulate the animal breathing heavily after its combat with Gwangi (a feature first used in models made for much earlier films by Marcel Delgado).\n\nSome of the models used in the film featured were reused model armatures from earlier films. Gwangi, the ''[[Ornithomimus]]'', and the ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' were all made from the ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'', the ''[[Phorusrhacos]]'' and the ''[[Triceratops]]'', who were stripped down and had their armatures modified for further use. The actual model of Gwangi was about 12 inches high and the ''[[Ornithomimus]]'' was about 5 inches high. A solid-latex, non-armatured model of Gwangi was also used for the scenes when he knocks himself out while trying to exit the valley in pursuit of the cowboys (Harryhausen was never pleased with this, as the solid model did not look right).\n\n==Cast==\nActress [[Gila Golan]] was cast at the insistence of Warner Bros. Her Israeli accent was so strong that all of her lines were redubbed on the film by a voice actress.<ref>Swires  67</ref> \n\nActor [[Laurence Naismith]], who plays Professor Bromley, had earlier appeared in Harryhausen's ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' as the shipbuilder [[Argos]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6ad81e00|title=Jason and the Argonauts (1963)|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Location shooting===\n[[File:Cathedral's Organs.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of [[Cuenca Cathedral]] where the movie's climax takes place.]]\nThe film was filmed in [[Almer\u00eda]] and [[Cuenca, Spain]]. The bullring scenes were shot in Almer\u00eda's plaza de toros and the finale at Cuenca's cathedral. Some scenes with dinosaurs like the ''[[Pteranodon]]'' scene or the fight between the ''[[Allosaurus]]'' and ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' were filmed in [[Almer\u00eda]], in Tabernas Desert.

Management at [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] also changed, and the film was released with little promotional effort on a double-bill with a biker film; it thus missed its target audience and was not as successful as earlier Harryhausen efforts, but as since become a cult classic.\n\nAmong the critics, ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it a \"generally run-of-the-mill monster rally.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/09/04/archives/the-valley-of-gwangi.html|title=The Valley of Gwangi'|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe scene where Gwangi suddenly appears from behind a hill and snatches the fleeing ''[[Ornithomimus]]'' in his jaws was later copied in the big-budget dinosaur film, ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''.\n\nDuring the 1980s hit TV series ''[[Scarecrow and Mrs. King]]'', anytime a television was shown on in the series, ''The Valley of Gwangi'' was on the screen.{{dubious|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn episode 2-28 (2000) of the American version of the TV series ''[[Whose_Line_Is_It_Anyway%3F_(U.S._TV_series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'', the scene of Tuck fighting the pterodactyl was used for the green screen video during the Newsflash segment.\n\nJustin Parpan's 2006 children's read-aloud book, ''Gwango's Lonesome Trail'' (Red Cygnet Press, Inc., {{ISBN|1-60108-004-2}}) features a [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] dinosaur named \"Gwango\" roaming the contemporary [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]].\n\nIn the episode \"[[The One Where Joey Speaks French]]\" of the situation comedy ''[[Friends]]'', Ross watches the film while in a hospital.\n\nIn the 2011 animated film, ''[[Scooby-Doo!

Breckenridge hosts a struggling rodeo. Her former lover, Tuck Kirby, a heroic former stuntman working for [[Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show]], wants to buy her out. Along the way, he is followed by a Mexican boy named Lope, who intends to join the rodeo on a quest for fame and fortune. T.J. is not interested in Tuck because of this, but Tuck is still attracted to T.J., especially when T.J. jumps off a diving board on her horse. T.J. finally accepts Tuck when he saves Lope from a bull and the two kiss.\n\nT.J. has an ace she hopes will boost attendance at her show - a tiny horse called El Diablo. Tuck meets a British [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] named Horace Bromley, who is working in a nearby Mexican desert. Bromley shows Tuck [[fossil]]ized horse tracks, and Tuck notes their similarity to El Diablo's feet. Tuck sneaks Bromley into the circus for a look at El Diablo, and Bromley declares the horse to be a [[prehistory|prehistoric]] ''[[Eohippus]]''.\n\nThe tiny horse came from a place known as the Forbidden Valley. A gypsy known as Tia Zorina claims that the horse is cursed, and demands that it be immediately returned. Later, she and the other gypsies collaborate with Bromley to steal El Diablo and release it back in the valley. Bromley hopes to follow the horse to its home in search of other prehistoric specimens. Carlos, an ex-member of the Gypsy tribe now working for T.J.'s circus, walks in on the theft and tries to stop it, but is knocked out.\n\nTuck arrives just as the Gypsy posse leaves. Carlos sees him as he is regaining consciousness. Tuck notices that the horse is missing, and sets off after Bromley. When T.J. and her crew discover Carlos, Carlos claims that Tuck has stolen El Diablo for himself. Carlos, T.J., and the others decide to follow Tuck and Bromley into the valley.\n\nMaking their way into the Forbidden Valley, Tuck, T.J., and the rest of the group meet up and soon discover why the valley is said to be cursed when a ''[[Pteranodon]]'' swoops down and snatches Lope but due to the weight it falls back to the ground. After Carlos kills the ''Pteranodon'' by twisting its neck, they spot an ''[[Ornithomimus]]'', which they chase after in the hopes of capturing it. Just as it is about to escape, it is killed by Gwangi, a vicious ''[[Allosaurus]]'' which chases Bromley and the rest of the group. However, a ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' appears and drives Gwangi away. As Gwangi leaves, he takes the dead ''Pteranodon'' with him.\n\nLater, Gwangi pursues the group to their base camp and they try to rope him down, but he breaks free when the ''Styracosaurus'' reappears. Gwangi battles and kills the ''Styracosaurus'' and later manages to catch and kill Carlos, but is knocked out by a rockslide while trying to exit the valley in pursuit of the rest of the group.\n\nSecuring the creature with ropes, Tuck and the other men in the group take Gwangi back to town to be put on display in T.J.'s show. On the opening day of the show, the dwarfed Gypsy sneaks in and begins to unlock Gwangi's cage in an effort to free him, only to be killed when Gwangi breaks free. The crowd begins to flee as Gwangi attacks, and Tia Zorina is trampled to death in the chaos. Bromley is crushed by a broken piece of the cage, and Gwangi attacks and kills a circus elephant before rampaging through the town. Tuck, accompanied by T.J. and Lope, tries to hide the crowd in a cathedral, but Gwangi finds them and breaks in. Tuck urges the crowd out through a back exit, leaving Tuck inside with Gwangi, T.J. and Lope.\n\nThough Gwangi tries to eat them, he is distracted when the cathedral's organ is accidentally sounded off as Tuck falls backwards into the keyboard. Tuck then manages to wound the dinosaur with a flag and throws a torch onto the floor near Gwangi, setting the building on fire. Tuck and the others manage to escape, leaving Gwangi trapped in the burning, collapsing building. Shrieking in agony, Gwangi is finally crushed to death by the falling debris, as Tuck, T.J., Lope (with tears in his eyes), and the townspeople look on.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Franciscus]] as Tuck\n* [[Gila Golan]] as T.J.\n* [[Richard Carlson (actor)|Richard Carlson]] as Champ\n* [[Laurence Naismith]] as Professor Bromley\n* [[Freda Jackson]] as Tia Zorina\n* [[Gustavo Rojo]] as Carlos\n* Dennis Kilbane as Rowdy\n* Mario De Barros as Bean (as Mario de Barros)\n* Curtis Arden as Lope\n\n==Development==\n''Gwangi'' was originally conceived by [[Willis O'Brien]] (1886-1962), the man who created the special effects for the original ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933). The plot was inspired by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's book ''[[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]'' (1912), with added elements from ''King Kong'' (capturing a creature and bringing it to civilization where it runs amok). \n\nIn O'Brien's scenario, then called ''Valley of the Mists'', cowboys discover an [[Allosaurus]] in the Grand Canyon. After finally roping the dinosaur, they put it in a Wild West show but the creature, now called \"Gwangi\", breaks free and fights lions from the show that have also escaped. After killing the lions, Gwangi goes on a rampage around the town and is run off a cliff by a man in a truck. \n\nO'Brien worked on the project at RKO during most of 1942. The studio cancelled the production reportedly because of research done that the public did not want to see a picture about dinosaurs.<ref>Creating Dinosaurs for BABY Lee, Nora.

Harryhausen suggested reviving two old O'Brien projects, ''War Eagles'', which had been developed for MGM, and ''Gwangi'' which had been done for RKO. Schneer did not see how they could get a script out of ''War Eagles'' but was enthusiastic about the ''Gwangi'' script and bought the rights from O'Brien's widow.<ref>Swires p 66</ref>\n\nSchneer had the script rewritten by William Bast and offered the project to Columbia, who had made all Scheer's previous collaborations with Harryhausen. The studio turned it down by Warner Bros agreed to finance. James O'Connelly signed to direct.<ref>Swires p 66</ref>\n\nHarryhausen said they decided to set the film in the past to eliminate \"cliches about the army moving in with tanks and missiles.\" <ref>Newsom p 28</ref>\n\nGwangi was described in O'Brien's original script as an ''Allosaurus'', although O'Brien apparently did not draw much distinction between ''Allosaurus'' and ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', as he also referred to the ''Tyrannosaurus'' in the original King Kong (modeled by Marcel Delgado) as an \"''Allosaurus''\". According to Ray Harryhausen, his own version of Gwangi (and O'Brien's Gwangi too, as well as Delgado's ''Tyrannosaurus'') was based on a [[Charles R. Knight]] painting of a ''Tyrannosaurus'' - one of the two most famous paintings by Knight, and one that is instantly recognizable by the eye being placed too far forward on the skull (this was based on concurrently incomplete skeletal remains and the eye was mistakenly placed in one of the [[Antorbital fenestra|antorbital fenestrae]]), as well as ultimately and incorrectly portraying Tyrannosaurus with a three-fingered hand. This famous Tyrannosaurus image is also reflected in Harryhausen's \"Rhedosaurus\" in ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]''. In an interview featured on the 'Valley of Gwangi' DVD, Harryhausen said \"We sometimes called it an ''Allosaurus''... They're both meat eaters, they're both Tyrants... one was just a bit larger than the other.\" Gwangi was scaled to be 14 feet tall, within the size range of an average adult ''Tyrannosaurus'' (although not the largest), and at the upper limit of the largest ''Allosaurus'' specimens.\n\n==Special effects==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2013}}\n''The Valley of Gwangi'' was the last dinosaur-themed film that Harryhausen animated, and he made much use of his experience in depicting extinct animals from his earlier films. Close to a year was spent on the special effects (there were more than 300 'Dynamation' cuts in the film, a record number for Harryhausen), with the roping of Gwangi being the most labor-intensive animated sequence. It was achieved by having the actors hold on to ropes tied to a \"monster stick\" that was in the back of a jeep. The jeep and stick when filmed with Gwangi are on a back rear projection plate and hidden by his body, and the portions of rope attached to his body are painted wires that are matched with the real ropes. The coordination of Gwangi's animation with live actors on horseback (and the horses appearing to react to Gwangi) was particularly difficult to film, and the source of an editorial lapse in a following scene. Gwangi bites through the ropes around his neck when first lassoed and later has his jaws roped together when unconscious. However, he is then shown being transported in a cart again held only by ropes around his neck but with jaws now un-bound.\n\nThe first animated sequence in the film is a diving act done by T.J. and her horse. Because it was decided that it was too risky to have a rider and horse jump off a 40-foot high platform into a tank of water, a model horse and rider were used. After tempting Gila Golan's horse to jump from a mock-up platform onto a trampoline, the film cut to an animated model suspended on wires (actually it was just a tiny toy horse and rider bought in a toy store). The splash was real, triggered by an electric charge inside the tank.\n\nAfter local Gypsies steal the ''[[Eohippus]]'', it is released back into the Forbidden Valley. For all the scenes where the cowboys are chasing the creature, the animated model was used. However, in one long shot, a baby goat was used instead because the model would have been too small.\n\nThe [[pterosaur]]s were mistakenly given bat's wings (with elongate fingers supporting the membrane; pterosaurs had one finger forming the wing's leading edge but none on the membrane). The wings appear to mimic those of a pterosaur from an earlier Harryhausen film, ''[[One Million Years B.C.]]'' (1966). Close-up sequences of the pterosaurs in Gwangi were provided by life-size models. For the scene when Lope is snatched from his horse by the ''[[Pteranodon]]'', the boy was raised by wires painted out in the studio and Harryhausen animated the eight-inch-high model pterosaur to correspond with his movements. However, once the creature gets up to a certain altitude the real boy was replaced with a model which was used until he crawls away from the creature which is being killed by Carlos on the ground. Bromley the [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] mistakenly calls it a ''[[Pterodactylus|pterodactyl]]'' (a common error) while he is inspecting it on the ground.\n\nThe scene where Gwangi pounces on the ''[[Ornithomimus]]'' has been copied many times in dinosaur films, primarily in [[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]], when the ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' pounces on the ''[[Gallimimus]]''. The smaller dinosaur had never appeared on the film screen before and although its movements were unlikely it was one of Harryhausen's favorite sequences in the film. The battle between Gwangi and the ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' features battle moves such as biting, stabbing, butting, and pinning. After Gwangi is captured, he is wheeled back to town in a cart; and for several of the long shots of this scene the crew built and used a full-sized mock-up of Gwangi, again because an actual model would have been far too small.\n\nHarryhausen originally planned to have used a real elephant in some of the scenes for the fight with Gwangi. This did not work out because he wanted to have used a 15-foot tall elephant (the world's biggest elephant was two feet shorter than this). So the live 8-foot elephant was only used in the beginning when a woman is seen briefly riding on its back. For some of the elephant fight scenes Harryhausen used the animation table as the bullring floor.<ref>Excerpts taken from ''Ray Harryhausen: An Animated Life, ''ch 8, pgs 204-212)</ref>\n\nFor Gwangi's death scene a number of special effects were used. When the torch hits the ground near Gwangi, the flames are seen quickly developing and surrounding Gwangi. The flames were added in by double printing the camera. The outside of the burning church was a mixture of composites: the lower half was the real church photographed on location in [[Spain]], and the upper, burning half was a miniature, again added in by double printing the camera.\n\nThe model of the ''[[Eohippus]]'' was supposed to have toes but appears to have regular hooves with 'toes' painted on (the sound effects of the animal moving also resemble hooves). The model of the ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' featured an inflatable air 'bladder' to simulate the animal breathing heavily after its combat with Gwangi (a feature first used in models made for much earlier films by Marcel Delgado).\n\nSome of the models used in the film featured were reused model armatures from earlier films. Gwangi, the ''[[Ornithomimus]]'', and the ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' were all made from the ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'', the ''[[Phorusrhacos]]'' and the ''[[Triceratops]]'', who were stripped down and had their armatures modified for further use. The actual model of Gwangi was about 12 inches high and the ''[[Ornithomimus]]'' was about 5 inches high. A solid-latex, non-armatured model of Gwangi was also used for the scenes when he knocks himself out while trying to exit the valley in pursuit of the cowboys (Harryhausen was never pleased with this, as the solid model did not look right).\n\n==Cast==\nActress [[Gila Golan]] was cast at the insistence of Warner Bros. Her Israeli accent was so strong that all of her lines were redubbed on the film by a voice actress.<ref>Swires  67</ref> \n\nActor [[Laurence Naismith]], who plays Professor Bromley, had earlier appeared in Harryhausen's ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' as the shipbuilder [[Argos]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6ad81e00|title=Jason and the Argonauts (1963)|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Location shooting===\n[[File:Cathedral's Organs.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of [[Cuenca Cathedral]] where the movie's climax takes place.]]\nThe film was filmed in [[Almer\u00eda]] and [[Cuenca, Spain]]. The bullring scenes were shot in Almer\u00eda's plaza de toros and the finale at Cuenca's cathedral. Some scenes with dinosaurs like the ''[[Pteranodon]]'' scene or the fight between the ''[[Allosaurus]]'' and ''[[Styracosaurus]]'' were filmed in [[Almer\u00eda]], in Tabernas Desert. The unusual rock formations of Ciudad Encantada near Cuenca were used for the forbidden valley.<ref>Silver Screen Spain: English Language Films Made in Spain, [http://www.silver-screen-spain.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=113 The Valley of Gwangi (1969)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914023358/http://www.silver-screen-spain.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=113 |date=2016-09-14}}</ref>\n\nScheer says the director \"lost interest in the middle of shooting.

I thought, 'This is going to be a mess.'\" <ref>Newsom p 28</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box Office===\nAccording to Harryhausen \"we got trapped in a change of management shuffle at Warner Bros. If only they had publicized it properly! They just dumped the picture on the market. A lot of people who would have loved it never got a chance to see it, never knew it was playing.\"<ref name=\"film\"/>\n\n\"\"The new administration didn't give it the kind of release I expected,\" said Scheer. \"They didn't know how to market our type of picture as well as Columbia did. It was their money and their property, and they did what they wanted. I had no rapport with that new management. There was nothing I could do to change their minds.\"<ref>Swires p 67</ref> \n===Critical Reception===\nScheer later said he \" wasn't very keen about\" the film.  \"Because of the subject matter and the period in which it was set, it just didn't have the same appeal to me that our other pictures had. The central image of the cowboys roping the dinosaur was imaginative, but it didn't hold up for feature length.\"<ref>Swires  68</ref>\n\n==Comic book adaption==\n* [[Dell Comics|Dell]] Movie Classic: ''The Valley of Gwangi'' (December 1969)<ref>{{gcdb series|id=74238|title=Dell Movie Classic: ''The Valley of Gwangi''}}</ref><ref>{{comicbookdb|type=issue|id=311587|title=Dell Movie Classic: ''The Valley of Gwangi''}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nBy the time of the film's release, interest in [[monster movie]]s of this type was waning. Management at [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Warner Bros.-Seven Arts]] also changed, and the film was released with little promotional effort on a double-bill with a biker film; it thus missed its target audience and was not as successful as earlier Harryhausen efforts, but as since become a cult classic.\n\nAmong the critics, ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it a \"generally run-of-the-mill monster rally.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1969/09/04/archives/the-valley-of-gwangi.html|title=The Valley of Gwangi'|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe scene where Gwangi suddenly appears from behind a hill and snatches the fleeing ''[[Ornithomimus]]'' in his jaws was later copied in the big-budget dinosaur film, ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''.\n\nDuring the 1980s hit TV series ''[[Scarecrow and Mrs. King]]'', anytime a television was shown on in the series, ''The Valley of Gwangi'' was on the screen.{{dubious|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn episode 2-28 (2000) of the American version of the TV series ''[[Whose_Line_Is_It_Anyway%3F_(U.S._TV_series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'', the scene of Tuck fighting the pterodactyl was used for the green screen video during the Newsflash segment.\n\nJustin Parpan's 2006 children's read-aloud book, ''Gwango's Lonesome Trail'' (Red Cygnet Press, Inc., {{ISBN|1-60108-004-2}}) features a [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] dinosaur named \"Gwango\" roaming the contemporary [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]].\n\nIn the episode \"[[The One Where Joey Speaks French]]\" of the situation comedy ''[[Friends]]'', Ross watches the film while in a hospital.\n\nIn the 2011 animated film, ''[[Scooby-Doo! Legend of the Phantosaur]]'', during a night time chase scene through the town a [[movie theater]] can be seen in the background playing two dinosaur-themed [[monster movie]]s, ''The Valley of Gwangi'' and ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'' (another Harryhausen film from Warner Bros).\n\nIn July 2018.

It is the group's first song in over a decade, the last being 2009's \"[[Hush Hush; Hush Hush]]\", and marks their departure from [[Interscope Records]] instead favouring an independent release in partnership with First Access Entertainment. \"React\" sees the return of [[Carmit Bachar]] who left the group before the release of their last album, ''[[Doll Domination]]'' (2008), although it does not feature [[Melody Thornton]], who opted out of the reunion citing the desire to continue with her own solo music career. It was written by group member [[Nicole Scherzinger]], along with Georgia Buchanan, Johan Gustafsson, William Simister and Hannah Wilson. It was produced by Gustafson, Will Simms and Swedish producer Ivares. \n\nA pulsating [[electropop]] and [[synthpop]] song, \"React\" is about a stagnant and turbulent relationship with lyrics that speak of wanting a more powerful reaction and excitement from one's lover. The group debuted \"React\" during a medley performance of their hits on ''[[The X Factor: Celebrity]]'' on November 30, 2019, and shortly after confirmed a [[Unfinished Business (tour)|comeback concert tour]]. It was subsequently performed on ''[[Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway]]'' and [[G-A-Y]] as part of [[Gay Pride|National Student Pride]]. The ''X Factor'' performance generated in excess of 400 complains with British broadcast regulator [[Ofcom]] regarding a perceived raunchy nature of the performance. The group subsequently answered complaints by noting that they were entertainers and their intention was to always be fierce, whilst empowering women to own their bodies.\n\nOverall, \"React\" was met with critical acclaim for its uptempo production, drawing comparisons to the group's 2006 singles \"[[Beep (The Pussycat Dolls song)|Beep]]\" and \"[[Wait a Minute (The Pussycat Dolls song)|Wait a Minute]]\". An official [[music video]] was released on February 7, 2020 and features [[pyrotechnics]] and water, as well as a dance routine involving chairs, inspired by the 1983 movie ''[[Flashdance]]''. Critics called the release a successful return to music, further praising the video's synchronised choreography and backdrop of fire and water. Commercially, the song reached the top five in Scotland, top-twenty on a number of international component digital charts, as well as becoming the group's eleventh consecutive top-forty single in the UK. Scherzinger noted that \"React\" could be followed by further new music from the group depending its success and their upcoming concert tour.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Melody Thornton LF.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Former member [[Melody Thornton]] opted out of the reunion to focus on her solo career.]]\nFollowing the re-release of ''[[Doll Domination]]'' (2008) and the group's single 2009 \"[[Jai Ho!

It is the group's first song in over a decade, the last being 2009's \"[[Hush Hush; Hush Hush]]\", and marks their departure from [[Interscope Records]] instead favouring an independent release in partnership with First Access Entertainment. \"React\" sees the return of [[Carmit Bachar]] who left the group before the release of their last album, ''[[Doll Domination]]'' (2008), although it does not feature [[Melody Thornton]], who opted out of the reunion citing the desire to continue with her own solo music career. It was written by group member [[Nicole Scherzinger]], along with Georgia Buchanan, Johan Gustafsson, William Simister and Hannah Wilson. It was produced by Gustafson, Will Simms and Swedish producer Ivares. \n\nA pulsating [[electropop]] and [[synthpop]] song, \"React\" is about a stagnant and turbulent relationship with lyrics that speak of wanting a more powerful reaction and excitement from one's lover. The group debuted \"React\" during a medley performance of their hits on ''[[The X Factor: Celebrity]]'' on November 30, 2019, and shortly after confirmed a [[Unfinished Business (tour)|comeback concert tour]]. It was subsequently performed on ''[[Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway]]'' and [[G-A-Y]] as part of [[Gay Pride|National Student Pride]]. The ''X Factor'' performance generated in excess of 400 complains with British broadcast regulator [[Ofcom]] regarding a perceived raunchy nature of the performance. The group subsequently answered complaints by noting that they were entertainers and their intention was to always be fierce, whilst empowering women to own their bodies.\n\nOverall, \"React\" was met with critical acclaim for its uptempo production, drawing comparisons to the group's 2006 singles \"[[Beep (The Pussycat Dolls song)|Beep]]\" and \"[[Wait a Minute (The Pussycat Dolls song)|Wait a Minute]]\". An official [[music video]] was released on February 7, 2020 and features [[pyrotechnics]] and water, as well as a dance routine involving chairs, inspired by the 1983 movie ''[[Flashdance]]''. Critics called the release a successful return to music, further praising the video's synchronised choreography and backdrop of fire and water. Commercially, the song reached the top five in Scotland, top-twenty on a number of international component digital charts, as well as becoming the group's eleventh consecutive top-forty single in the UK. Scherzinger noted that \"React\" could be followed by further new music from the group depending its success and their upcoming concert tour.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Melody Thornton LF.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Former member [[Melody Thornton]] opted out of the reunion to focus on her solo career.]]\nFollowing the re-release of ''[[Doll Domination]]'' (2008) and the group's single 2009 \"[[Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)]]\", tensions in the group rose due to Scherzinger being billed as a featured artist on the release. This would go on to lead to a public outburst by member [[Melody Thornton]] during the group's [[Doll Domination Tour]].<ref>{{cite web

In addition, colonists imported numerous [[Native ethnic groups of Africa|African]] people as slaves in the 18th century.

The alluvial region includes low swamp lands, coastal marshlands and beaches, and [[barrier islands]] that cover about {{convert|20000|sqmi|km2}}. This area lies principally along the Gulf of Mexico and the [[Mississippi River]], which traverses the state from north to south for a distance of about {{convert|600|mi|-1|abbr=on}} and empties into the Gulf of Mexico; the [[Red River of the South|Red River]]; the [[Ouachita River]] and its branches; and other minor streams (some of which are called [[bayous]]).\n\nThe breadth of the alluvial region along the Mississippi is from 10 to 60 miles (15 to 100&nbsp;km), and along the other rivers, the alluvial region averages about 10 miles (15&nbsp;km) across. The Mississippi River flows along a ridge formed by its natural deposits (known as a [[levee]]), from which the lands decline toward a river beyond at an average fall of six feet per mile (3&nbsp;m/km). The alluvial lands along other streams present similar features.\n\nThe higher and contiguous hill lands of the north and northwestern part of the state have an area of more than {{convert|25000|sqmi|km2}}. They consist of prairie and woodlands. The elevations above sea level range from 10 feet (3&nbsp;m) at the coast and swamp lands to 50 and 60 feet (15\u201318&nbsp;m) at the prairie and alluvial lands. In the uplands and hills, the elevations rise to [[Driskill Mountain]], the highest point in the state only 535 feet (163&nbsp;m) above sea level. From 1932 to 2010 the state lost 1,800 square miles due to rises in sea level and [[erosion]].

Swamps have been extensively logged, leaving canals and ditches that allow salt water to move inland. Canals dug for the oil and gas industry also allow storms to move sea water inland, where it damages swamps and marshes. Rising sea waters have exacerbated the problem. Some researchers estimate that the state is losing a landmass equivalent to 30 football fields every day. There are many proposals to save coastal areas by reducing human damage, including restoring natural floods from the Mississippi. Without such restoration, coastal communities will continue to disappear.<ref>Boesch, D. F., Josselyn, M. N., Mehta, A. J., Morris, J. T., Nuttle, W. K., Simenstad, C. A., and Swift, D. P. J.

The subtropical characteristics of the state are due to its low latitude, low lying topography, and the influence of the [[Gulf of Mexico]], which at its farthest point is no more than {{convert|200|mi|-1|abbr=on}} away.\n\nRain is frequent throughout the year, although from April to September is slightly wetter than the rest of the year, which is the state's [[wet season]]. There is a dip in precipitation in October. In summer, thunderstorms build during the heat of the day and bring intense but brief, tropical downpours. In winter, rainfall is more frontal and less intense.\n\nSummers in southern Louisiana have high temperatures from June through September averaging 90&nbsp;\u00b0F (32&nbsp;\u00b0C) or more, and overnight lows averaging above 70&nbsp;\u00b0F (22&nbsp;\u00b0C). At times, temperatures in the 90s F, combined with [[dew points]] in the upper 70s F, create sensible temperatures over {{convert|120|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}. The humid, thick, jungle-like heat in southern Louisiana is a famous subject of countless stories and movies.\n\nTemperatures are generally warm in the winter in the southern part of the state, with highs around New Orleans, Baton Rouge, the rest of south Louisiana, and the Gulf of Mexico averaging 66&nbsp;\u00b0F (19&nbsp;\u00b0C). The northern part of the state is mildly cool in the winter, with highs averaging 59&nbsp;\u00b0F (15&nbsp;\u00b0C). The overnight lows in the winter average well above freezing throughout the state, with 46&nbsp;\u00b0F (8&nbsp;\u00b0C) the average near the Gulf and an average low of 37&nbsp;\u00b0F (3&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the winter in the northern part of the state.\n\nOn occasion, cold fronts from low-pressure centers to the north, reach Louisiana in winter. Low temperatures near 20&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u22128&nbsp;\u00b0C) occur on occasion in the northern part of the state but rarely do so in the southern part of the state. [[Snow in Louisiana|Snow]] is rare near the Gulf of Mexico, although residents in the northern parts of the state might receive a dusting of snow a few times each decade. Louisiana's highest recorded temperature is {{convert|114|F|C}} in [[Plain Dealing, Louisiana|Plain Dealing]] on August 10, 1936, while the coldest recorded temperature is {{convert|-16|F|C}} at [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]] on February 13, 1899.\n\nLouisiana is often affected by [[tropical cyclone]]s and is very vulnerable to strikes by major [[Atlantic hurricane|hurricanes]], particularly the lowlands around and in the New Orleans area. The unique geography of the region, with the many bayous, marshes and inlets, can result in water damage across a wide area from major hurricanes. The area is also prone to frequent thunderstorms, especially in the summer.<ref name=\"Annual average number of tornadoes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |title=NOAA National Climatic Data Center |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016174155/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |archive-date=October 16, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe entire state averages over 60 days of thunderstorms a year, more than any other state except Florida. Louisiana averages 27 [[tornado]]es annually. The entire state is vulnerable to a tornado strike, with the extreme southern portion of the state slightly less so than the rest of the state.

The French settlement had two purposes: to establish trade with the Spanish in [[Texas]] via the Old San Antonio Road, and to deter Spanish advances into Louisiana. The settlement soon became a flourishing river port and crossroads, giving rise to vast cotton kingdoms along the river that were worked by imported African slaves. Over time, planters developed large plantations and built fine homes in a growing town. This became a pattern repeated in New Orleans and other places, although the commodity crop in the south was primarily sugar cane.\n[[File:Atchafalaya Basin.jpg|thumb|French Acadians, who came to be known as [[Cajuns]], settled the swamps of southern Louisiana, especially in the [[Atchafalaya Basin]].]]\n\nLouisiana's French settlements contributed to further exploration and outposts, concentrated along the banks of the Mississippi and its major tributaries, from Louisiana to as far north as the region called the [[Illinois Country]], around present-day [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. The latter was settled by French colonists from Illinois.\n\nInitially, [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] and then [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] served as the capital of La Louisiane. Recognizing the importance of the Mississippi River to trade and military interests, and wanting to protect the capital from severe coastal storms, France developed New Orleans from 1722 as the seat of civilian and military authority south of the Great Lakes. From then until the United States acquired the territory in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, France and Spain jockeyed for control of New Orleans and the lands west of the Mississippi.\n\nIn the 1720s, German immigrants settled along the Mississippi River, in a region referred to as the [[German Coast]].\n\nFrance ceded most of its territory to the east of the Mississippi to Great Britain in 1763, in the aftermath of [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War]] (generally referred to in North America as the [[French and Indian War]]). The rest of Louisiana, including the area around New Orleans and the parishes around [[Lake Pontchartrain]], had become a colony of Spain by the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]] (1762). The transfer of power on either side of the river would be delayed until later in the decade.\n\nIn 1765, during Spanish rule, several thousand French-speaking refugees from the region of [[Acadia]] (now [[Nova Scotia]], New Brunswick, and [[Prince Edward Island]], Canada) made their way to Louisiana after having been [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expelled]] from their homelands by the British during the French and Indian War. They settled chiefly in the southwestern Louisiana region now called [[Acadiana]]. The Spanish, eager to gain more Catholic settlers, welcomed the [[Acadian]] refugees, the ancestors of Louisiana's [[Cajun]]s.\n\nSpanish Canary Islanders, called [[Isle\u00f1os]], emigrated from the Canary Islands of Spain to Louisiana under the Spanish crown between 1778 and 1783.\n\nIn 1800, France's [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] reacquired Louisiana from Spain in the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]], an arrangement kept secret for two years.\n\n===Expansion of slavery===\n\n{{main|History of slavery in Louisiana}}\n\n[[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville]] brought the first two African slaves to Louisiana in 1708, transporting them from a French colony in the West Indies. In 1709, French financier [[Antoine Crozat]] obtained a monopoly of commerce in [[La Louisiane]], which extended from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to what is now [[Illinois]]. \"That concession allowed him to bring in a cargo of blacks from Africa every year,\" the British historian [[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]] wrote.<ref>''The Slave Trade: The Story of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1440\u20131870'' by Hugh Thomas. 1997: Simon and Schuster. p. 242-43</ref> Physical conditions, including disease, were so harsh there was high mortality among both the colonists and the slaves, resulting in continuing demand and importation of slaves.\n\nStarting in 1719, traders began to import slaves in higher numbers; two French ships, the ''Du Maine'' and the ''Aurore'', arrived in New Orleans carrying more than 500 black slaves coming from Africa. Previous slaves in Louisiana had been transported from French colonies in the West Indies. By the end of 1721, New Orleans counted 1,256 inhabitants, of whom about half were slaves.\n\nIn 1724, the French government issued a law called the [[Code Noir]] (\"Black Code\" in English) which \"regulate[d] the interaction of whites [blancs] and blacks [noirs] in its colony of Louisiana<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.knowlouisiana.org/entry/code-noir-of-louisiana|title=Code Noir of Louisiana\u2014Know Louisiana|publisher=|access-date=April 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518041714/http://www.knowlouisiana.org/entry/code-noir-of-louisiana|archive-date=May 18, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> (which was much larger than the current state of Louisiana). The law consisted of 57 articles, which regulated religion in the colony, outlawed \"interracial\" marriages (those between people of different skin color, the varying shades of which were also defined by law), restricted [[manumission]], outlined legal punishment of slaves for various offenses, and defined some obligations of owners to their slaves. The main intent of the French government was to assert control over the slave system of agriculture in Louisiana and to impose restrictions on slaveowners there. In practice, the Code Noir was exceedingly difficult to enforce from afar. Some priests continued to perform interracial marriage ceremonies, for example, and some slaveholders continued to manumit slaves without permission while others punished slaves brutally.\n\nArticle II of the Code Noir of 1724 required owners to provide their slaves with religious education in the state religion, Roman Catholicism. Sunday was to be a day of rest for slaves. On days off, slaves were expected to feed and take care of themselves. During the 1740s economic crisis in the colony, owners had trouble feeding their slaves and themselves. Giving them time off also effectively gave more power to slaves, who started cultivating their own gardens and crafting items for sale as their own property. They began to participate in the economic development of the colony while at the same time increasing independence and self-subsistence.\n\nArticle VI of the Code Noir forbade mixed marriages, forbade but did little to protect slave women from rape by their owners, overseers or other slaves. On balance, the Code benefitted the owners but had more protections and flexibility than did the institution of slavery in the southern [[Thirteen Colonies]].\n\nThe Louisiana Black Code of 1806 made the cruel punishment of slaves a crime, but owners and overseers were seldom prosecuted for such acts.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=The law of slavery\u2014Master\u2013slave legal relationships |url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24164 |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007003400/http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24164 |archivedate=October 7, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nFugitive slaves, called maroons, could easily hide in the backcountry of the bayous and survive in small settlements. The word \"maroon\" comes from the Spanish \"cimarron\", meaning \"fugitive cattle\".\n\nIn the late 18th century, the last Spanish governor of the Louisiana territory wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Truly, it is impossible for lower Louisiana to get along without slaves and with the use of slaves, the colony had been making great strides toward prosperity and wealth.<ref name=\"The Slave Trade p. 548\"/></blockquote>\n\nWhen the United States [[Louisiana Purchase|purchased Louisiana]] in 1803, it was soon accepted that enslaved Africans could be brought to Louisiana as easily as they were brought to neighboring [[Mississippi]], though it violated U.S. law to do so.<ref name=\"The Slave Trade p. 548\">Hugh Thomas, ''The Slave Trade: The Story of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1440\u20131870'', Simon and Schuster, 1997, p. 548.</ref> Despite demands by United States Rep. [[James Hillhouse]] and by the pamphleteer [[Thomas Paine]] to enforce existing federal law against slavery in the newly acquired territory,<ref name=\"The Slave Trade p. 548\" /> slavery prevailed because it was the source of great profits and the lowest-cost labor.\n\nAt the start of the 19th century, Louisiana was a small producer of sugar with a relatively small number of slaves, compared to Saint-Domingue and the West Indies. It soon thereafter became a major sugar producer as new settlers arrived to develop plantations. [[William C. C. Claiborne]], Louisiana's first United States governor, said African slave labor was needed because white laborers \"cannot be had in this unhealthy climate\".<ref>Thomas (1997), ''The Slave Trade'', p. 549.</ref> Hugh Thomas wrote that Claiborne was unable to enforce the abolition of the African slave trade, which the U.S. and Great Britain adopted in 1808. The United States continued to protect the domestic slave trade, including the coastwise trade\u2014the transport of slaves by ship along the Atlantic Coast and to New Orleans and other Gulf ports.\n\nBy 1840, New Orleans had the biggest slave market in the United States, which contributed greatly to the economy of the city and of the state.

Many sold slaves to traders to take to the Deep South. Slaves were driven by traders overland from the Upper South or transported to New Orleans and other coastal markets by ship in the [[coastwise slave trade]]. After sales in New Orleans, steamboats operating on the Mississippi transported slaves upstream to markets or plantation destinations at Natchez and Memphis.\n\nAs the [[Deep South]] was developed for cotton and sugar in the first half of the nineteenth century, demand for slaves increased. This resulted in a massive forced migration (through the slave trade) of more than one million African Americans from the [[Upper South]] to the Deep South. Many traders brought slaves to New Orleans for domestic sale, and by 1840, New Orleans had the largest slave market in the country, was the third-largest city, and was one of the wealthiest cities.\n[[File:Free Woman of Color with daughter NOLA Collage.jpg|thumb|[[Free people of color|Free woman of color]] with [[mixed-race]] daughter; late 18th-century collage painting, New Orleans]]\n\n===Haitian migration and influence===\n\nSpanish occupation of Louisiana lasted from 1769 to 1800. Beginning in the 1790s, waves of immigration took place from [[Saint-Domingue]], following a [[Haitian Revolution|slave rebellion]] that started in 1791. Over the next decade, thousands of migrants landed in Louisiana from the island, including ethnic Europeans, [[free people of color]], and African slaves, some of the latter brought in by each free group. They greatly increased the French-speaking population in New Orleans and Louisiana, as well as the number of Africans, and the slaves reinforced African culture in the city. The process of gaining independence in Saint-Domingue was complex, but uprisings continued. In 1803, France pulled out its surviving troops from the island, having suffered the loss of two-thirds sent to the island two years before, mostly to [[yellow fever]]. In 1804, [[Haiti]], the second republic in the western hemisphere, proclaimed its independence, achieved by slave leaders.<ref>\"[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ht0017) The Slave Rebellion of 1791] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205164427/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID+ht0017%29 |date=February 5, 2016 }}\".

As American settlers pushed west, they found that the [[Appalachian Mountains]] provided a barrier to shipping goods eastward. The easiest way to ship produce was to use a [[flatboat]] to float it down the [[Ohio river|Ohio]] and Mississippi Rivers to the port of New Orleans, where goods could be put on ocean-going vessels. The problem with this route was that the Spanish owned both sides of the Mississippi below [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]].\n\nNapoleon's ambitions in Louisiana involved the creation of a new empire centered on the [[Caribbean]] [[sugar trade]]. By the terms of the Treaty of Amiens of 1802, Great Britain returned ownership of the islands of [[Martinique]] and [[Guadaloupe]] to the French. Napoleon looked upon Louisiana as a depot for these sugar islands, and as a buffer to U.S. settlement. In October 1801 he sent a large military force to take back Saint-Domingue, then under control of Toussaint Louverture after a slave rebellion.\nWhen the army led by Napoleon's brother-in-law Leclerc was defeated, Napoleon decided to sell Louisiana.\n[[File:Louisiane 1800.png|thumb|Map of Louisiana in 1800]]\n\n[[Thomas Jefferson]], third president of the United States, was disturbed by Napoleon's plans to re-establish French colonies in America. With the possession of New Orleans, Napoleon could close the Mississippi to U.S. commerce at any time. Jefferson authorized [[Robert Livingston (1746\u20131813)|Robert R. Livingston]], U.S. Minister to France, to negotiate for the purchase of the City of New Orleans, portions of the east bank of the Mississippi, and free navigation of the river for U.S. commerce. Livingston was authorized to pay up to $2&nbsp;million.\n\nAn official transfer of Louisiana to French ownership had not yet taken place, and Napoleon's deal with the Spanish was a poorly kept secret on the frontier. On October 18, 1802, however, Juan Ventura Morales, Acting Intendant of Louisiana, made public the intention of Spain to revoke the right of deposit at New Orleans for all cargo from the United States. The closure of this vital port to the United States caused anger and consternation. Commerce in the west was virtually blockaded. Historians believe the revocation of the right of deposit was prompted by abuses by the Americans, particularly smuggling, and not by French intrigues as was believed at the time. President Jefferson ignored public pressure for war with France, and appointed [[James Monroe]] a special envoy to Napoleon, to assist in obtaining New Orleans for the United States. Jefferson also raised the authorized expenditure to $10&nbsp;million.\n\nHowever, on April 11, 1803, French Foreign Minister [[Talleyrand]] surprised Livingston by asking how much the United States was prepared to pay for the '''entirety''' of Louisiana, not just New Orleans and the surrounding area (as Livingston's instructions covered). Monroe agreed with Livingston that Napoleon might withdraw this offer at any time (leaving them with no ability to obtain the desired New Orleans area), and that approval from President Jefferson might take months, so Livingston and Monroe decided to open negotiations immediately. By April 30, they closed a deal for the purchase of the entire Louisiana territory of {{convert|828000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} for 60 million [[French franc|Francs]] (approximately $15&nbsp;million).\n\nPart of this sum, $3.5&nbsp;million, was used to forgive debts owed by France to the United States.<ref>Peter Kastor, ''The Nation's Crucible: The Louisiana Purchase and the Creation of America'', (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004) 40</ref> The payment was made in United States [[Government bond|bonds]], which Napoleon sold at face value to the Dutch firm of [[Hope & Co.|Hope and Company]], and the [[Barings Bank|British banking house of Baring]], at a discount of 87\u00bd per each $100 unit. As a result, France received only $8,831,250 in cash for Louisiana. English banker [[Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton|Alexander Baring]] conferred with Marbois in Paris, shuttled to the United States to pick up the bonds, took them to Britain, and returned to France with the money\u2014which Napoleon used to wage war against Baring's own country.\n[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Louisiana Purchase, 1803.jpg|thumb|Louisiana Purchase, 1803]]\n\nWhen news of the purchase reached the United States, Jefferson was surprised. He had authorized the expenditure of $10&nbsp;million for a port city, and instead received treaties committing the government to spend $15&nbsp;million on a land package which would double the size of the country. Jefferson's political opponents in the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]] argued the Louisiana purchase was a worthless desert,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AsY9Vh9X8ZYC&dq=%22louisiana+purchase%22+federalist+desert+jefferson&q=worthless+desert |title=The American pageant: a history of the republic\u2014Thomas A.

What really worried the opposition was the new states which would inevitably be carved from the Louisiana territory, strengthening Western and Southern interests in Congress, and further reducing the influence of New England Federalists in national affairs. President Jefferson was an enthusiastic supporter of westward expansion, and held firm in his support for the treaty. Despite Federalist objections, the U.S. Senate ratified the Louisiana treaty on October 20, 1803.\n\nBy statute enacted on October 31, 1803, President Thomas Jefferson was authorized to take possession of the territories ceded by France and provide for initial governance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=282|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774\u20131875|website=memory.loc.gov|access-date=December 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220085715/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002%2Fllsl002.db&recNum=282|archive-date=December 20, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> A transfer ceremony was held in New Orleans on November 29, 1803. Since the Louisiana territory had never officially been turned over to the French, the Spanish took down their flag, and the French raised theirs. The following day, [[General James Wilkinson]] accepted possession of New Orleans for the United States. A similar ceremony was held in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] on March 9, 1804, when a French tricolor was raised near the river, replacing the Spanish national flag. The following day, [[Captain (U.S. Army)|Captain]] [[Amos Stoddard]] of the First U.S. Artillery marched his troops into town and had the American flag run up the fort's flagpole. The Louisiana territory was officially transferred to the United States government, represented by [[Meriwether Lewis]].\n\nThe Louisiana Territory, purchased for less than three cents an acre, doubled the size of the United States overnight, without a war or the loss of a single American life, and set a precedent for the purchase of territory. It opened the way for the eventual expansion of the United States across the continent to the Pacific.\n\nShortly after the United States took possession, the area was divided into two territories along the [[33rd parallel north]] on March 26, 1804, thereby organizing the [[Territory of Orleans]] to the south and the [[District of Louisiana]] (subsequently formed as the [[Louisiana Territory]]) to the north.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=320|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774\u20131875|website=rs6.loc.gov|access-date=December 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220091706/http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002%2Fllsl002.db&recNum=320|archive-date=December 20, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Statehood (1812)===\n\n{{Main|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|Seminole Wars|Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty}}\n\nLouisiana became the eighteenth U.S. state on April 30, 1812; the Territory of Orleans became the State of Louisiana and the Louisiana Territory was simultaneously renamed the [[Missouri Territory]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=738|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774\u20131875|website=memory.loc.gov|access-date=December 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105021747/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002%2Fllsl002.db&recNum=738|archive-date=January 5, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> An area known as the [[Florida Parishes]] was soon annexed into the state of Louisiana on April 14, 1812.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=745|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774\u20131875|website=memory.loc.gov|access-date=December 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202191512/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002%2Fllsl002.db&recNum=745|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1824 to 1861, Louisiana moved from a political system based on personality and ethnicity to a distinct two-party system, with Democrats competing first against ''Whigs'', then ''Know Nothings'', and finally only other [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].<ref>John M.

Initially state legislatures were dominated by former Confederates, who passed Black Codes to regulate [[freedmen]] and generally refused to give the vote. They refused to extend voting rights to African Americans who had been free before the war and had sometimes obtained education and property (as in New Orleans.) Following the [[Memphis riots of 1866]] and the [[New Orleans riot]] the same year, the Fourteenth Amendment was passed that provided suffrage and full citizenship for freedmen. Congress passed the Reconstruction Act, establishing military districts for those states where conditions were considered the worst, including Louisiana. It was grouped with [[Texas]] in what was administered as the [[Fifth Military District]].\n\nAfrican Americans began to live as citizens with some measure of equality before the law. Both [[freedmen]] and [[free people of color|people of color]] who had been free before the war began to make more advances in education, family stability and jobs. At the same time, there was tremendous social volatility in the aftermath of war, with many whites actively resisting defeat and the free labor market. White [[insurgents]] mobilized to enforce [[white supremacy]], first in [[Ku Klux Klan]] chapters.\n\nBy 1877, when federal forces were withdrawn, white Democrats in Louisiana and other states had regained control of state legislatures, often by paramilitary groups such as the [[White League]], which suppressed black voting through intimidation and violence. Following Mississippi's example in 1890, in 1898, the white Democratic, planter-dominated legislature passed a new constitution that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] people of color, by raising barriers to voter registration, such as [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], residency requirements and [[literacy tests]]. The effect was immediate and long lasting.

Neighboring states and the amount of federal spending received per dollar of federal tax collected were: Texas ($0.94), Arkansas ($1.41), and Mississippi ($2.02).

Petroleum and gas deposits are found in abundance both onshore and offshore in State-owned waters. In addition, vast petroleum and natural gas reserves are found offshore from Louisiana in the federally administered [[Outer Continental Shelf]] (OCS) in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. According to the [[Energy Information Administration]], the Gulf of Mexico OCS is the largest U.S. petroleum-producing region. Excluding the Gulf of Mexico OCS, Louisiana ranks fourth in petroleum production and is home to about two percent of the total U.S. petroleum reserves.\n\nLouisiana's natural gas reserves account for about five percent of the U.S. total. The recent discovery of the [[Haynesville Shale]] formation in parts of or all of Caddo, Bossier, Bienville, Sabine, De Soto, Red River, and Natchitoches parishes have made it the world's fourth largest gas field with some wells initially producing over 25 million cubic feet of gas daily.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=LA |title=EIA State Energy Profiles: Louisiana |date=June 12, 2008 |accessdate=June 24, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206050811/http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=LA |archive-date=February 6, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nLouisiana was the first site of [[Oil well|petroleum drilling]] over water in the world, on [[Caddo Lake]] in the northwest corner of the state. The petroleum and gas industry, as well as its subsidiary industries such as transport and [[Oil refinery|refining]], have dominated Louisiana's economy since the 1940s. Beginning in 1950, Louisiana was sued several times by the [[United States Department of the Interior|U.S. Interior Department]], in efforts by the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] to strip Louisiana of its submerged land property rights. These control vast stores of reservoirs of petroleum and natural gas.\n\nWhen petroleum and gas [[1973 oil crisis|boomed]] in the 1970s, so did Louisiana's economy. The Louisiana economy as well as its politics of the last half-century cannot be understood without thoroughly accounting for the influence of the petroleum and gas industries. Since the 1980s, these industries' headquarters have consolidated in [[Houston]], but many of the jobs that operate or provide logistical support to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico crude-oil-and-gas industry remained in Louisiana {{as of|lc=y|2010}}.\n\n==Law and government==\n\n{{Politics of Louisiana}}\n<!--This section is linked from [[Law of the United Kingdom]]-->\n:{{Further|List of Louisiana Governors|Louisiana law|Louisiana Constitution}}\n[[File:Louisiana State Capitol Building.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Louisiana State Capitol]] in Baton Rouge, the [[Heights of state capitols|tallest state capitol building]] in the United States]]\n[[File:LAGovMansion.JPG|right|thumb|The Louisiana Governor's Mansion]]\n\nIn 1849, the state moved the capital from New Orleans to [[Baton Rouge]]. [[Donaldsonville, Louisiana|Donaldsonville]], [[Opelousas, Louisiana|Opelousas]], and [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] have briefly served as the seat of Louisiana state government. The [[Louisiana State Capitol]] and the [[Louisiana Governor's Mansion]] are both located in Baton Rouge. The [[Louisiana Supreme Court]], however, did not move to Baton Rouge but remains headquartered in New Orleans.\n\nLouisiana and California (whose supreme court is seated in San Francisco) are the only two states whose high courts are not headquartered in the state capital.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe current Louisiana governor is [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[John Bel Edwards]]. The current [[United States Senate|United States senators]] are Republicans [[John Neely Kennedy]] and [[Bill Cassidy]]. Louisiana has six [[congressional district]]s and is represented in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] by five Republicans and one Democrat. Louisiana had eight votes in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] for the [[2012 United States presidential election in Louisiana|2012 election]]. It lost one House seat due to stagnant population growth in the 2010 Census.\n\n===Administrative divisions===\n\nLouisiana is divided into 64 [[Parish (administrative division)|parishes]] (the equivalent of [[County (United States)|counties]] in most other states).<ref name=\"nativeamericans\">{{Handbook of Texas|id=bzi04|name=Native Americans}}</ref>\n* [[List of parishes in Louisiana]]\n* [[Louisiana census statistical areas]]\n\nMost parishes have an elected government known as the Police Jury, dating from the colonial days. It is the legislative and executive government of the parish, and is elected by the voters. Its members are called Jurors, and together they elect a president as their chairman.\n\nA more limited number of parishes operate under [[home rule]] charters, electing various forms of government. This include mayor\u2013council, council\u2013manager (in which the council hires a professional operating manager for the parish), and others.\n\n===Civil law===\n\nThe Louisiana political and legal structure has maintained several elements from the times of French and Spanish governance. One is the use of the term \"[[parish (Louisiana)|parish]]\" (from the French: ''paroisse'') in place of \"[[County (United States)|county]]\" for administrative subdivision. Another is the legal system of [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] based on French, German, and Spanish [[legal code]]s and ultimately [[Roman law]], as opposed to English [[common law]].\n\nLouisiana's civil law system is what the majority of nations in the world use, especially in Europe and its former colonies, excluding those that derive from the [[British Empire]]. However, it is incorrect to equate the Louisiana Civil Code with the [[Napoleonic Code]]. Although the Napoleonic Code and Louisiana law draw from common legal roots, the Napoleonic Code was never in force in Louisiana, as it was enacted in 1804, after the United States had [[Louisiana Purchase|purchased]] and annexed Louisiana in 1803.\n\nWhile the Louisiana Civil Code of 1808 has been continuously revised and updated since its enactment, it is still considered the controlling authority in the state. Differences are found between Louisianan civil law and the common law found in the other U.S. states. While some of these differences have been bridged due to the strong influence of common law tradition,<ref name=\"kinsellalaw\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kinsellalaw.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/dictionary.pdf |title=A Civil Law to Common Law Dictionary |accessdate=December 7, 2010 |last=Kinsella |first=Norman |year=1997 |website=KinsellaLaw.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225105448/http://www.kinsellalaw.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/dictionary.pdf |archivedate=December 25, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the civil law tradition is still deeply rooted in most aspects of Louisiana private law.

The franchise for whites was expanded somewhat during these decades, but blacks remained essentially disfranchised until after the [[civil rights movement]] of the mid-20th century, gaining enforcement of their constitutional rights through passage by Congress of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].\n\nSince the 1960s, when civil rights legislation was passed under President [[Lyndon Johnson]] to protect voting and civil rights, most African Americans in the state have affiliated with the Democratic Party. In the same years, many white social conservatives have moved to support Republican Party candidates in national, gubernatorial and statewide elections. In 2004, [[David Vitter]] was the first Republican in Louisiana to be popularly elected as a U.S. senator. The previous Republican senator, [[John S. Harris]], who took office in 1868 during Reconstruction, was chosen by the state legislature under the rules of the 19th century.\n\nLouisiana is unique among U.S. states in using a system for its state and local elections similar to that of modern France. All candidates, regardless of party affiliation, run in a [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] (or \"jungle primary\") on Election Day. If no candidate has more than 50% of the vote, the two candidates with the highest vote totals compete in a runoff election approximately one month later. This run-off method does not take into account party identification; therefore, it is not uncommon for a Democrat to be in a runoff with a fellow Democrat or a Republican to be in a runoff with a fellow Republican.\n\nCongressional races have also been held under the jungle primary system. All other states (except [[Washington Initiative 872 (2004)|Washington]], [[California Proposition 14 (2010)|California]], and [[Maine]]) use single-party primaries followed by a general election between party candidates, each conducted by either a [[plurality voting system]] or [[Two-round system|runoff voting]], to elect senators, representatives, and statewide officials. Between 2008 and 2010, federal [[United States Congress|congressional]] elections were run under a closed primary system\u2014limited to registered party members. However, upon the passage of House Bill 292, Louisiana again adopted a nonpartisan blanket primary for its federal congressional elections.\n\nLouisiana has six seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, five of which are currently held by Republicans and one by a Democrat. The state lost a House seat at the end of the [[112th Congress]] due to stagnant population growth as recorded by the [[2010 United States Census]]. Louisiana is not classified as a \"[[swing state]]\" for future presidential elections, as since the late 20th century, it has regularly supported Republican candidates. The state's two U.S. senators are [[Bill Cassidy]] (R) [[John Neely Kennedy]] (R).\n\n===Law enforcement===\n\n{{See also|List of law enforcement agencies in Louisiana}}\n\nLouisiana's statewide police force is the [[Louisiana State Police]]. It began in 1922 with the creation of the Highway Commission. In 1927, a second branch, the Bureau of Criminal Investigations, was formed. In 1932, the State Highway Patrol was authorized to carry weapons.\n\nOn July 28, 1936, the two branches were consolidated to form the Louisiana Department of State Police; its motto was \"courtesy, loyalty, service\". In 1942, this office was abolished and became a division of the Department of Public Safety, called the Louisiana State Police.

The State Police are primarily a traffic enforcement agency, with other sections that delve into trucking safety, narcotics enforcement, and gaming oversight.\n\nThe elected sheriff in each parish is the chief law enforcement officer in the parish. They are the keepers of the local parish prisons, which house felony and misdemeanor prisoners. They are the primary criminal patrol and first responder agency in all matters criminal and civil. They are also the official tax collectors in each parish. The sheriffs are responsible for general law enforcement in their respective parishes. Orleans Parish is an exception, as the general law enforcement duties fall to the New Orleans Police Department. Before 2010, Orleans parish was the only parish to have two sheriff's offices. Orleans Parish divided sheriffs' duties between criminal and civil, with a different elected sheriff overseeing each aspect. In 2006, a bill was passed which eventually consolidated the two sheriff's departments into one parish sheriff responsible for both civil and criminal matters.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 2015, Louisiana had a higher murder rate (10.3 per 100,000) than any other state in the country for the 27th straight year.

Conditions were harsh, the climate and soil were unsuitable for certain crops the colonists knew, and they suffered from regional tropical diseases. Both colonists and the slaves they imported had high mortality rates. The settlers kept importing slaves, which resulted in a high proportion of native Africans from West Africa, who continued to practice their culture in new surroundings. As described by historian [[Gwendolyn Midlo Hall]], they developed a marked Afro-Creole culture in the colonial era.<ref>Gwendolyn Midlo Hall, ''Africans in Colonial Louisiana: The Development of Afro-Creole Culture in the Eighteenth Century'' (1992)</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/laslave/|title=Afro-Louisiana History and Genealogy|website=www.ibiblio.org|accessdate=October 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190430233835/http://www.ibiblio.org/laslave/|archive-date=April 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAt the turn of the 18th century and in the early 1800s, New Orleans received a major influx of white and mixed-race refugees fleeing the violence of the [[Haitian Revolution]], many of whom brought their slaves with them. This added another infusion of African culture to the city, as more slaves in [[Saint-Domingue]] were from Africa than in the United States. They strongly influenced the African-American culture of the city in terms of dance, music and religious practices.\n\n===Louisiana Creole culture===\n\n[[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] culture is an amalgamation of French, African, Spanish (and other European), and Native American cultures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laheritage.org/CreoleHeritage/index.html |title=French Creole Heritage |publisher=Laheritage.org |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140830084559/http://www.laheritage.org/CreoleHeritage/index.html |archivedate=August 30, 2014 }}</ref> Creole comes from the Portuguese word ''crioulo''; originally it referred to a colonist of European (specifically French) descent who was born in the New World, in comparison to immigrants from France.<ref>Delehanty, Randolph. ''New Orleans: Elegance and Decadence, Chronicle Books'', 1995, pg. 14</ref> The oldest Louisiana manuscript to use the word \"Creole\", from 1782, applied it to a slave born in the French colony.<ref>Kein, Sybil. ''Creole: The History and Legacy of Louisiana's Free People of Color'', Louisiana State University Press, 2009, p. 73.</ref> But originally it referred more generally to the French colonists born in Louisiana.\n\nOver time, there developed in the French colony a relatively large group of [[Creoles of Color]] (''gens de couleur libres''), who were primarily descended from African slave women and French men (later other Europeans became part of the mix, as well as some Native Americans.) Often the French would free their concubines and [[mixed-race]] children, and pass on social capital to them. They might educate sons in France, for instance, and help them enter the French Army for a career. They also settled capital or property on their mistresses and children. The free people of color gained more rights in the colony and sometimes education; they generally spoke French and were Roman Catholic. Many became artisans and property owners. Over time, the term \"Creole\" became associated with this class of [[Creoles of Color]], many of whom achieved freedom long before the Civil War.\n\nWealthy French Creoles generally maintained town houses in [[New Orleans]] as well as houses on their large sugar plantations outside town along the Mississippi River. New Orleans had the largest population of free people of color in the region; they could find work there and created their own culture, marrying among themselves for decades.\n\n===Acadian culture===\n\nThe ancestors of [[Cajun]]s immigrated mostly from west central France to New France, where they settled in the Atlantic provinces of [[New Brunswick]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Prince Edward Island]], known originally as [[Acadia]]. After the British defeated France in the [[French and Indian War]] ([[Seven Years' War]]) in 1763, France ceded its territory east of the Mississippi River to Britain. The British forcibly separated families and evicted them from Acadia because they refused to vow loyalty to the new British regime. The Acadians were deported to England, New England, and France. Some escaped the British remained in [[French Canada]].\n\nOthers scattered, to France, Canada, Mexico, or the Falkland Islands. Many Acadian refugees settled in south Louisiana in the region around [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] and the LaFourche Bayou country. They developed a distinct rural culture there, different from the French Creole colonists of New Orleans. Intermarrying with others in the area, they developed what was called Cajun music, cuisine and culture. Until the 1970s, the term \"Cajun\" was considered somewhat derogatory.\n\n===Isle\u00f1o culture===\n\n{{Main|Isle\u00f1o (Louisiana)}}\n[[File:El_Museo_de_los_Isle\u00f1os.jpg|alt=|thumb|El Museo de los Isle\u00f1os (Isle\u00f1o Museum) in [[Saint Bernard, Louisiana|Saint Bernard]]]]\n\nA third distinct culture in Louisiana is that of the Isle\u00f1os. Its members are descendants of colonists from the [[Canary Islands]] who settled in [[Spanish Louisiana]] between 1778 and 1783 and intermarried with other communities such as [[French people|Frenchman]], [[Acadians]], [[Louisiana Creole people|Creoles]], [[Spaniards]], and other groups, mainly through the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nIn Louisiana, the Isle\u00f1os originally settled in four communities which included Galveztown, Valenzuela, Barataria, and San Bernardo. Of those settlements, Valenzuela and San Bernardo were the most successful as the other two were plagued with both disease and flooding. The large migration of [[Acadian]] refugees to [[Bayou Lafourche]] led to the rapid gallicization of the Valenzuela community while the community of San Bernardo ([[Saint Bernard Parish, Louisiana|Saint Bernard]]) was able to preserve much of its unique culture and language into the 21st century. This being said, the transmission of Spanish and other customs has completely halted in St. Bernard with those having competency in Spanish being octogenarians.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite book|title=The Language of the Isle\u00f1os: Vestigial Spanish in Louisiana|last1=Lipski|first1=John|date=July 1, 1990|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|isbn=0807115347|location=|pages=i, 4}}</ref>\n\nThrough the centuries, the various Isle\u00f1o communities of Louisiana have kept alive different elements of their Canary Islander heritage while also adopting and building upon the customs and traditions of the communities that surround them. Today two heritage associates exist for the communities: Los Isle\u00f1os Heritage and Cultural Society of St. Bernard as well as the Canary Islanders Heritage Society of Louisiana.

Of these, only Tunica, Caddo and Choctaw still have living native speakers, although several other tribes are working to teach and revitalize their languages. Other Native American peoples migrated into the region, escaping from European pressure from the east. Among these were [[Alabama language|Alabama]], Biloxi, Koasati, and Ofo peoples.\n\nStarting in the 1700s, French colonists began to settle along the coast and founded New Orleans. They established French culture and language institutions. They imported thousands of slaves from tribes of West Africa, who spoke several different languages. In the creolization process, the slaves developed a Louisiana Creole dialect incorporating both French and African forms, which colonists adopted to communicate with them, and which persisted beyond slavery. In the 20th century, there were still people of mixed race, particularly, who spoke Louisiana Creole French.\n\nDuring the 19th century after the [[Louisiana Purchase]] by the United States, English gradually gained prominence for business and government due to the shift in population with settlement by numerous Americans who were English speakers. Many ethnic French families continued to use French in private. Slaves and some free people of color also spoke Louisiana Creole French. The [[Constitution of Louisiana#Louisiana Constitution of 1812|State Constitution of 1812]] gave English official status in legal proceedings, but use of French remained widespread. Subsequent state constitutions reflect the diminishing importance of French. The 1868 constitution, passed during the [[Reconstruction era]] before Louisiana was re-admitted to the Union, banned laws requiring the publication of legal proceedings in languages other than English. Subsequently, the legal status of French recovered somewhat, but it never regained its pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] prominence.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5694&context=lalrev |title=The French Language in Louisiana Law and Legal Education: A Requiem |first=Roger K |last=Ward |journal=Louisiana Law Review |volume=57 |issue=4 |date=Summer 1997 |access-date=October 11, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621233419/http://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5694&context=lalrev |archive-date=June 21, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nSeveral unique dialects of French, Creole, and English are spoken in Louisiana. Dialects of the French language are: [[Colonial French]] and Houma French. [[Louisiana Creole French]] is the term for one of the Creole languages. Two unique dialects developed of the English language: [[Cajun English|Louisiana English]], a French-influenced variety of English in which dropping of postvocalic /r/ is common ; and what is informally known as [[Yat (New Orleans)|Yat]], which resembles the [[New York City English|New York City dialect]] sometimes with southern influences, particularly that of historical [[Brooklyn]]. Both accents were influenced by large communities of immigrant Irish and Italians, but the Yat dialect, which developed in New Orleans, was also influenced by French and Spanish.\n[[File:Signalisation routi\u00e8re bilingue \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e de la Louisiane.jpg|thumb|Louisiana's bilingual state welcome sign, recognizing its French heritage]]\n\n[[Colonial French]] was the dominant language of white settlers in [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] during the French colonial period; it was spoken primarily by the French Creoles (native-born). In addition to this dialect, the mixed-race people and slaves developed [[Louisiana Creole French|Louisiana Creole]], with a base in West African languages. The limited years of Spanish rule at the end of the 18th century did not result in widespread adoption of the Spanish language. French and Louisiana Creole are still used in modern-day Louisiana, often in family gatherings. English and its associated dialects became predominant after the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, after which the area became dominated by numerous English speakers. In some regions, English was influenced by French, as seen with Louisiana English. [[Colonial French]], although mistakenly named Cajun French by some Cajuns, has persisted alongside English.\n\nRenewed interest in the French language in Louisiana has led to the establishment of Canadian-modeled [[French immersion]] schools, as well as bilingual signage in the historic French neighborhoods of New Orleans and [[Lafayette (Louisiana)|Lafayette]]. In addition to private organizations, since 1968 the state has maintained the [[Council for the Development of French in Louisiana]] (CODOFIL), which promotes use of the French language in the state's tourism, economic development, culture, education and international relations.

In addition, colonists imported numerous [[Native ethnic groups of Africa|African]] people as slaves in the 18th century. Many came from peoples of the same region of West Africa, thus concentrating their culture.

As Pangea split apart, the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico opened. Louisiana slowly developed, over millions of years, from water into land, and from north to south.<ref name=\"Keddy 2008\" /> The oldest rocks are exposed in the north, in areas such as the [[Kisatchie National Forest]]. The oldest rocks date back to the early [[Cenozoic Era]], some 60 million years ago. The history of the formation of these rocks can be found in D.

In general, the northern terraces have had sufficient time for rivers to cut deep channels, while the newer terraces tend to be much flatter.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Holland |first=W.C. |date=1944 |title=Physiographic divisions of the Quaternary lowlands of Louisiana |journal=Proceedings of the Louisiana Academy of Sciences |volume=8 |pages=10\u201324 }}</ref>\n\n[[Salt dome]]s are also found in Louisiana.

The alluvial region includes low swamp lands, coastal marshlands and beaches, and [[barrier islands]] that cover about {{convert|20000|sqmi|km2}}. This area lies principally along the Gulf of Mexico and the [[Mississippi River]], which traverses the state from north to south for a distance of about {{convert|600|mi|-1|abbr=on}} and empties into the Gulf of Mexico; the [[Red River of the South|Red River]]; the [[Ouachita River]] and its branches; and other minor streams (some of which are called [[bayous]]).\n\nThe breadth of the alluvial region along the Mississippi is from 10 to 60 miles (15 to 100&nbsp;km), and along the other rivers, the alluvial region averages about 10 miles (15&nbsp;km) across. The Mississippi River flows along a ridge formed by its natural deposits (known as a [[levee]]), from which the lands decline toward a river beyond at an average fall of six feet per mile (3&nbsp;m/km). The alluvial lands along other streams present similar features.\n\nThe higher and contiguous hill lands of the north and northwestern part of the state have an area of more than {{convert|25000|sqmi|km2}}. They consist of prairie and woodlands. The elevations above sea level range from 10 feet (3&nbsp;m) at the coast and swamp lands to 50 and 60 feet (15\u201318&nbsp;m) at the prairie and alluvial lands. In the uplands and hills, the elevations rise to [[Driskill Mountain]], the highest point in the state only 535 feet (163&nbsp;m) above sea level. From 1932 to 2010 the state lost 1,800 square miles due to rises in sea level and [[erosion]].

Swamps have been extensively logged, leaving canals and ditches that allow salt water to move inland. Canals dug for the oil and gas industry also allow storms to move sea water inland, where it damages swamps and marshes. Rising sea waters have exacerbated the problem. Some researchers estimate that the state is losing a landmass equivalent to 30 football fields every day. There are many proposals to save coastal areas by reducing human damage, including restoring natural floods from the Mississippi. Without such restoration, coastal communities will continue to disappear.<ref>Boesch, D. F., Josselyn, M. N., Mehta, A. J., Morris, J. T., Nuttle, W. K., Simenstad, C. A., and Swift, D. P. J.

The subtropical characteristics of the state are due to its low latitude, low lying topography, and the influence of the [[Gulf of Mexico]], which at its farthest point is no more than {{convert|200|mi|-1|abbr=on}} away.\n\nRain is frequent throughout the year, although from April to September is slightly wetter than the rest of the year, which is the state's [[wet season]]. There is a dip in precipitation in October. In summer, thunderstorms build during the heat of the day and bring intense but brief, tropical downpours. In winter, rainfall is more frontal and less intense.\n\nSummers in southern Louisiana have high temperatures from June through September averaging 90&nbsp;\u00b0F (32&nbsp;\u00b0C) or more, and overnight lows averaging above 70&nbsp;\u00b0F (22&nbsp;\u00b0C). At times, temperatures in the 90s F, combined with [[dew points]] in the upper 70s F, create sensible temperatures over {{convert|120|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}. The humid, thick, jungle-like heat in southern Louisiana is a famous subject of countless stories and movies.\n\nTemperatures are generally warm in the winter in the southern part of the state, with highs around New Orleans, Baton Rouge, the rest of south Louisiana, and the Gulf of Mexico averaging 66&nbsp;\u00b0F (19&nbsp;\u00b0C). The northern part of the state is mildly cool in the winter, with highs averaging 59&nbsp;\u00b0F (15&nbsp;\u00b0C). The overnight lows in the winter average well above freezing throughout the state, with 46&nbsp;\u00b0F (8&nbsp;\u00b0C) the average near the Gulf and an average low of 37&nbsp;\u00b0F (3&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the winter in the northern part of the state.\n\nOn occasion, cold fronts from low-pressure centers to the north, reach Louisiana in winter. Low temperatures near 20&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u22128&nbsp;\u00b0C) occur on occasion in the northern part of the state but rarely do so in the southern part of the state. [[Snow in Louisiana|Snow]] is rare near the Gulf of Mexico, although residents in the northern parts of the state might receive a dusting of snow a few times each decade. Louisiana's highest recorded temperature is {{convert|114|F|C}} in [[Plain Dealing, Louisiana|Plain Dealing]] on August 10, 1936, while the coldest recorded temperature is {{convert|-16|F|C}} at [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]] on February 13, 1899.\n\nLouisiana is often affected by [[tropical cyclone]]s and is very vulnerable to strikes by major [[Atlantic hurricane|hurricanes]], particularly the lowlands around and in the New Orleans area. The unique geography of the region, with the many bayous, marshes and inlets, can result in water damage across a wide area from major hurricanes. The area is also prone to frequent thunderstorms, especially in the summer.<ref name=\"Annual average number of tornadoes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |title=NOAA National Climatic Data Center |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016174155/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |archive-date=October 16, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe entire state averages over 60 days of thunderstorms a year, more than any other state except Florida. Louisiana averages 27 [[tornado]]es annually. The entire state is vulnerable to a tornado strike, with the extreme southern portion of the state slightly less so than the rest of the state.

The French settlement had two purposes: to establish trade with the Spanish in [[Texas]] via the Old San Antonio Road, and to deter Spanish advances into Louisiana. The settlement soon became a flourishing river port and crossroads, giving rise to vast cotton kingdoms along the river that were worked by imported African slaves. Over time, planters developed large plantations and built fine homes in a growing town. This became a pattern repeated in New Orleans and other places, although the commodity crop in the south was primarily sugar cane.\n[[File:Atchafalaya Basin.jpg|thumb|French Acadians, who came to be known as [[Cajuns]], settled the swamps of southern Louisiana, especially in the [[Atchafalaya Basin]].]]\n\nLouisiana's French settlements contributed to further exploration and outposts, concentrated along the banks of the Mississippi and its major tributaries, from Louisiana to as far north as the region called the [[Illinois Country]], around present-day [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. The latter was settled by French colonists from Illinois.\n\nInitially, [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] and then [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] served as the capital of La Louisiane. Recognizing the importance of the Mississippi River to trade and military interests, and wanting to protect the capital from severe coastal storms, France developed New Orleans from 1722 as the seat of civilian and military authority south of the Great Lakes. From then until the United States acquired the territory in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, France and Spain jockeyed for control of New Orleans and the lands west of the Mississippi.\n\nIn the 1720s, German immigrants settled along the Mississippi River, in a region referred to as the [[German Coast]].\n\nFrance ceded most of its territory to the east of the Mississippi to Great Britain in 1763, in the aftermath of [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War]] (generally referred to in North America as the [[French and Indian War]]). The rest of Louisiana, including the area around New Orleans and the parishes around [[Lake Pontchartrain]], had become a colony of Spain by the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]] (1762). The transfer of power on either side of the river would be delayed until later in the decade.\n\nIn 1765, during Spanish rule, several thousand French-speaking refugees from the region of [[Acadia]] (now [[Nova Scotia]], New Brunswick, and [[Prince Edward Island]], Canada) made their way to Louisiana after having been [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expelled]] from their homelands by the British during the French and Indian War. They settled chiefly in the southwestern Louisiana region now called [[Acadiana]]. The Spanish, eager to gain more Catholic settlers, welcomed the [[Acadian]] refugees, the ancestors of Louisiana's [[Cajun]]s.\n\nSpanish Canary Islanders, called [[Isle\u00f1os]], emigrated from the Canary Islands of Spain to Louisiana under the Spanish crown between 1778 and 1783.\n\nIn 1800, France's [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] reacquired Louisiana from Spain in the [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]], an arrangement kept secret for two years.\n\n===Expansion of slavery===\n\n{{main|History of slavery in Louisiana}}\n\n[[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville]] brought the first two African slaves to Louisiana in 1708, transporting them from a French colony in the West Indies. In 1709, French financier [[Antoine Crozat]] obtained a monopoly of commerce in [[La Louisiane]], which extended from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to what is now [[Illinois]]. \"That concession allowed him to bring in a cargo of blacks from Africa every year,\" the British historian [[Hugh Thomas (writer)|Hugh Thomas]] wrote.<ref>''The Slave Trade: The Story of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1440\u20131870'' by Hugh Thomas. 1997: Simon and Schuster. p. 242-43</ref> Physical conditions, including disease, were so harsh there was high mortality among both the colonists and the slaves, resulting in continuing demand and importation of slaves.\n\nStarting in 1719, traders began to import slaves in higher numbers; two French ships, the ''Du Maine'' and the ''Aurore'', arrived in New Orleans carrying more than 500 black slaves coming from Africa. Previous slaves in Louisiana had been transported from French colonies in the West Indies. By the end of 1721, New Orleans counted 1,256 inhabitants, of whom about half were slaves.\n\nIn 1724, the French government issued a law called the [[Code Noir]] (\"Black Code\" in English) which \"regulate[d] the interaction of whites [blancs] and blacks [noirs] in its colony of Louisiana<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.knowlouisiana.org/entry/code-noir-of-louisiana|title=Code Noir of Louisiana\u2014Know Louisiana|publisher=|access-date=April 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518041714/http://www.knowlouisiana.org/entry/code-noir-of-louisiana|archive-date=May 18, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> (which was much larger than the current state of Louisiana). The law consisted of 57 articles, which regulated religion in the colony, outlawed \"interracial\" marriages (those between people of different skin color, the varying shades of which were also defined by law), restricted [[manumission]], outlined legal punishment of slaves for various offenses, and defined some obligations of owners to their slaves. The main intent of the French government was to assert control over the slave system of agriculture in Louisiana and to impose restrictions on slaveowners there. In practice, the Code Noir was exceedingly difficult to enforce from afar. Some priests continued to perform interracial marriage ceremonies, for example, and some slaveholders continued to manumit slaves without permission while others punished slaves brutally.\n\nArticle II of the Code Noir of 1724 required owners to provide their slaves with religious education in the state religion, Roman Catholicism. Sunday was to be a day of rest for slaves. On days off, slaves were expected to feed and take care of themselves. During the 1740s economic crisis in the colony, owners had trouble feeding their slaves and themselves. Giving them time off also effectively gave more power to slaves, who started cultivating their own gardens and crafting items for sale as their own property. They began to participate in the economic development of the colony while at the same time increasing independence and self-subsistence.\n\nArticle VI of the Code Noir forbade mixed marriages, forbade but did little to protect slave women from rape by their owners, overseers or other slaves. On balance, the Code benefitted the owners but had more protections and flexibility than did the institution of slavery in the southern [[Thirteen Colonies]].\n\nThe Louisiana Black Code of 1806 made the cruel punishment of slaves a crime, but owners and overseers were seldom prosecuted for such acts.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=The law of slavery\u2014Master\u2013slave legal relationships |url=http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24164 |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007003400/http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24164 |archivedate=October 7, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nFugitive slaves, called maroons, could easily hide in the backcountry of the bayous and survive in small settlements. The word \"maroon\" comes from the Spanish \"cimarron\", meaning \"fugitive cattle\".\n\nIn the late 18th century, the last Spanish governor of the Louisiana territory wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Truly, it is impossible for lower Louisiana to get along without slaves and with the use of slaves, the colony had been making great strides toward prosperity and wealth.<ref name=\"The Slave Trade p. 548\"/></blockquote>\n\nWhen the United States [[Louisiana Purchase|purchased Louisiana]] in 1803, it was soon accepted that enslaved Africans could be brought to Louisiana as easily as they were brought to neighboring [[Mississippi]], though it violated U.S. law to do so.<ref name=\"The Slave Trade p. 548\">Hugh Thomas, ''The Slave Trade: The Story of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1440\u20131870'', Simon and Schuster, 1997, p. 548.</ref> Despite demands by United States Rep. [[James Hillhouse]] and by the pamphleteer [[Thomas Paine]] to enforce existing federal law against slavery in the newly acquired territory,<ref name=\"The Slave Trade p. 548\" /> slavery prevailed because it was the source of great profits and the lowest-cost labor.\n\nAt the start of the 19th century, Louisiana was a small producer of sugar with a relatively small number of slaves, compared to Saint-Domingue and the West Indies. It soon thereafter became a major sugar producer as new settlers arrived to develop plantations. [[William C. C. Claiborne]], Louisiana's first United States governor, said African slave labor was needed because white laborers \"cannot be had in this unhealthy climate\".<ref>Thomas (1997), ''The Slave Trade'', p. 549.</ref> Hugh Thomas wrote that Claiborne was unable to enforce the abolition of the African slave trade, which the U.S. and Great Britain adopted in 1808. The United States continued to protect the domestic slave trade, including the coastwise trade\u2014the transport of slaves by ship along the Atlantic Coast and to New Orleans and other Gulf ports.\n\nBy 1840, New Orleans had the biggest slave market in the United States, which contributed greatly to the economy of the city and of the state.

Many sold slaves to traders to take to the Deep South. Slaves were driven by traders overland from the Upper South or transported to New Orleans and other coastal markets by ship in the [[coastwise slave trade]]. After sales in New Orleans, steamboats operating on the Mississippi transported slaves upstream to markets or plantation destinations at Natchez and Memphis.\n\nAs the [[Deep South]] was developed for cotton and sugar in the first half of the nineteenth century, demand for slaves increased. This resulted in a massive forced migration (through the slave trade) of more than one million African Americans from the [[Upper South]] to the Deep South. Many traders brought slaves to New Orleans for domestic sale, and by 1840, New Orleans had the largest slave market in the country, was the third-largest city, and was one of the wealthiest cities.\n[[File:Free Woman of Color with daughter NOLA Collage.jpg|thumb|[[Free people of color|Free woman of color]] with [[mixed-race]] daughter; late 18th-century collage painting, New Orleans]]\n\n===Haitian migration and influence===\n\nSpanish occupation of Louisiana lasted from 1769 to 1800. Beginning in the 1790s, waves of immigration took place from [[Saint-Domingue]], following a [[Haitian Revolution|slave rebellion]] that started in 1791. Over the next decade, thousands of migrants landed in Louisiana from the island, including ethnic Europeans, [[free people of color]], and African slaves, some of the latter brought in by each free group. They greatly increased the French-speaking population in New Orleans and Louisiana, as well as the number of Africans, and the slaves reinforced African culture in the city. The process of gaining independence in Saint-Domingue was complex, but uprisings continued. In 1803, France pulled out its surviving troops from the island, having suffered the loss of two-thirds sent to the island two years before, mostly to [[yellow fever]]. In 1804, [[Haiti]], the second republic in the western hemisphere, proclaimed its independence, achieved by slave leaders.<ref>\"[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+ht0017) The Slave Rebellion of 1791] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205164427/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID+ht0017%29 |date=February 5, 2016 }}\".

As American settlers pushed west, they found that the [[Appalachian Mountains]] provided a barrier to shipping goods eastward. The easiest way to ship produce was to use a [[flatboat]] to float it down the [[Ohio river|Ohio]] and Mississippi Rivers to the port of New Orleans, where goods could be put on ocean-going vessels. The problem with this route was that the Spanish owned both sides of the Mississippi below [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]].\n\nNapoleon's ambitions in Louisiana involved the creation of a new empire centered on the [[Caribbean]] [[sugar trade]]. By the terms of the Treaty of Amiens of 1802, Great Britain returned ownership of the islands of [[Martinique]] and [[Guadaloupe]] to the French. Napoleon looked upon Louisiana as a depot for these sugar islands, and as a buffer to U.S. settlement. In October 1801 he sent a large military force to take back Saint-Domingue, then under control of Toussaint Louverture after a slave rebellion.\nWhen the army led by Napoleon's brother-in-law Leclerc was defeated, Napoleon decided to sell Louisiana.\n[[File:Louisiane 1800.png|thumb|Map of Louisiana in 1800]]\n\n[[Thomas Jefferson]], third president of the United States, was disturbed by Napoleon's plans to re-establish French colonies in America. With the possession of New Orleans, Napoleon could close the Mississippi to U.S. commerce at any time. Jefferson authorized [[Robert Livingston (1746\u20131813)|Robert R. Livingston]], U.S. Minister to France, to negotiate for the purchase of the City of New Orleans, portions of the east bank of the Mississippi, and free navigation of the river for U.S. commerce. Livingston was authorized to pay up to $2&nbsp;million.\n\nAn official transfer of Louisiana to French ownership had not yet taken place, and Napoleon's deal with the Spanish was a poorly kept secret on the frontier. On October 18, 1802, however, Juan Ventura Morales, Acting Intendant of Louisiana, made public the intention of Spain to revoke the right of deposit at New Orleans for all cargo from the United States. The closure of this vital port to the United States caused anger and consternation. Commerce in the west was virtually blockaded. Historians believe the revocation of the right of deposit was prompted by abuses by the Americans, particularly smuggling, and not by French intrigues as was believed at the time. President Jefferson ignored public pressure for war with France, and appointed [[James Monroe]] a special envoy to Napoleon, to assist in obtaining New Orleans for the United States. Jefferson also raised the authorized expenditure to $10&nbsp;million.\n\nHowever, on April 11, 1803, French Foreign Minister [[Talleyrand]] surprised Livingston by asking how much the United States was prepared to pay for the '''entirety''' of Louisiana, not just New Orleans and the surrounding area (as Livingston's instructions covered). Monroe agreed with Livingston that Napoleon might withdraw this offer at any time (leaving them with no ability to obtain the desired New Orleans area), and that approval from President Jefferson might take months, so Livingston and Monroe decided to open negotiations immediately. By April 30, they closed a deal for the purchase of the entire Louisiana territory of {{convert|828000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} for 60 million [[French franc|Francs]] (approximately $15&nbsp;million).\n\nPart of this sum, $3.5&nbsp;million, was used to forgive debts owed by France to the United States.<ref>Peter Kastor, ''The Nation's Crucible: The Louisiana Purchase and the Creation of America'', (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004) 40</ref> The payment was made in United States [[Government bond|bonds]], which Napoleon sold at face value to the Dutch firm of [[Hope & Co.|Hope and Company]], and the [[Barings Bank|British banking house of Baring]], at a discount of 87\u00bd per each $100 unit. As a result, France received only $8,831,250 in cash for Louisiana. English banker [[Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton|Alexander Baring]] conferred with Marbois in Paris, shuttled to the United States to pick up the bonds, took them to Britain, and returned to France with the money\u2014which Napoleon used to wage war against Baring's own country.\n[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Louisiana Purchase, 1803.jpg|thumb|Louisiana Purchase, 1803]]\n\nWhen news of the purchase reached the United States, Jefferson was surprised. He had authorized the expenditure of $10&nbsp;million for a port city, and instead received treaties committing the government to spend $15&nbsp;million on a land package which would double the size of the country. Jefferson's political opponents in the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]] argued the Louisiana purchase was a worthless desert,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AsY9Vh9X8ZYC&dq=%22louisiana+purchase%22+federalist+desert+jefferson&q=worthless+desert |title=The American pageant: a history of the republic\u2014Thomas A.

What really worried the opposition was the new states which would inevitably be carved from the Louisiana territory, strengthening Western and Southern interests in Congress, and further reducing the influence of New England Federalists in national affairs. President Jefferson was an enthusiastic supporter of westward expansion, and held firm in his support for the treaty. Despite Federalist objections, the U.S. Senate ratified the Louisiana treaty on October 20, 1803.\n\nBy statute enacted on October 31, 1803, President Thomas Jefferson was authorized to take possession of the territories ceded by France and provide for initial governance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=282|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774\u20131875|website=memory.loc.gov|access-date=December 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220085715/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002%2Fllsl002.db&recNum=282|archive-date=December 20, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> A transfer ceremony was held in New Orleans on November 29, 1803. Since the Louisiana territory had never officially been turned over to the French, the Spanish took down their flag, and the French raised theirs. The following day, [[General James Wilkinson]] accepted possession of New Orleans for the United States. A similar ceremony was held in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] on March 9, 1804, when a French tricolor was raised near the river, replacing the Spanish national flag. The following day, [[Captain (U.S. Army)|Captain]] [[Amos Stoddard]] of the First U.S. Artillery marched his troops into town and had the American flag run up the fort's flagpole. The Louisiana territory was officially transferred to the United States government, represented by [[Meriwether Lewis]].\n\nThe Louisiana Territory, purchased for less than three cents an acre, doubled the size of the United States overnight, without a war or the loss of a single American life, and set a precedent for the purchase of territory. It opened the way for the eventual expansion of the United States across the continent to the Pacific.\n\nShortly after the United States took possession, the area was divided into two territories along the [[33rd parallel north]] on March 26, 1804, thereby organizing the [[Territory of Orleans]] to the south and the [[District of Louisiana]] (subsequently formed as the [[Louisiana Territory]]) to the north.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=320|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774\u20131875|website=rs6.loc.gov|access-date=December 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220091706/http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002%2Fllsl002.db&recNum=320|archive-date=December 20, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Statehood (1812)===\n\n{{Main|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|Seminole Wars|Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty}}\n\nLouisiana became the eighteenth U.S. state on April 30, 1812; the Territory of Orleans became the State of Louisiana and the Louisiana Territory was simultaneously renamed the [[Missouri Territory]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=738|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774\u20131875|website=memory.loc.gov|access-date=December 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105021747/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002%2Fllsl002.db&recNum=738|archive-date=January 5, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> An area known as the [[Florida Parishes]] was soon annexed into the state of Louisiana on April 14, 1812.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002/llsl002.db&recNum=745|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774\u20131875|website=memory.loc.gov|access-date=December 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202191512/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=002%2Fllsl002.db&recNum=745|archive-date=February 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1824 to 1861, Louisiana moved from a political system based on personality and ethnicity to a distinct two-party system, with Democrats competing first against ''Whigs'', then ''Know Nothings'', and finally only other [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].<ref>John M.

Initially state legislatures were dominated by former Confederates, who passed Black Codes to regulate [[freedmen]] and generally refused to give the vote. They refused to extend voting rights to African Americans who had been free before the war and had sometimes obtained education and property (as in New Orleans.) Following the [[Memphis riots of 1866]] and the [[New Orleans riot]] the same year, the Fourteenth Amendment was passed that provided suffrage and full citizenship for freedmen. Congress passed the Reconstruction Act, establishing military districts for those states where conditions were considered the worst, including Louisiana. It was grouped with [[Texas]] in what was administered as the [[Fifth Military District]].\n\nAfrican Americans began to live as citizens with some measure of equality before the law. Both [[freedmen]] and [[free people of color|people of color]] who had been free before the war began to make more advances in education, family stability and jobs. At the same time, there was tremendous social volatility in the aftermath of war, with many whites actively resisting defeat and the free labor market. White [[insurgents]] mobilized to enforce [[white supremacy]], first in [[Ku Klux Klan]] chapters.\n\nBy 1877, when federal forces were withdrawn, white Democrats in Louisiana and other states had regained control of state legislatures, often by paramilitary groups such as the [[White League]], which suppressed black voting through intimidation and violence. Following Mississippi's example in 1890, in 1898, the white Democratic, planter-dominated legislature passed a new constitution that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] people of color, by raising barriers to voter registration, such as [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], residency requirements and [[literacy tests]]. The effect was immediate and long lasting.

Neighboring states and the amount of federal spending received per dollar of federal tax collected were: Texas ($0.94), Arkansas ($1.41), and Mississippi ($2.02).

Petroleum and gas deposits are found in abundance both onshore and offshore in State-owned waters. In addition, vast petroleum and natural gas reserves are found offshore from Louisiana in the federally administered [[Outer Continental Shelf]] (OCS) in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. According to the [[Energy Information Administration]], the Gulf of Mexico OCS is the largest U.S. petroleum-producing region. Excluding the Gulf of Mexico OCS, Louisiana ranks fourth in petroleum production and is home to about two percent of the total U.S. petroleum reserves.\n\nLouisiana's natural gas reserves account for about five percent of the U.S. total. The recent discovery of the [[Haynesville Shale]] formation in parts of or all of Caddo, Bossier, Bienville, Sabine, De Soto, Red River, and Natchitoches parishes have made it the world's fourth largest gas field with some wells initially producing over 25 million cubic feet of gas daily.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=LA |title=EIA State Energy Profiles: Louisiana |date=June 12, 2008 |accessdate=June 24, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206050811/http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=LA |archive-date=February 6, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nLouisiana was the first site of [[Oil well|petroleum drilling]] over water in the world, on [[Caddo Lake]] in the northwest corner of the state. The petroleum and gas industry, as well as its subsidiary industries such as transport and [[Oil refinery|refining]], have dominated Louisiana's economy since the 1940s. Beginning in 1950, Louisiana was sued several times by the [[United States Department of the Interior|U.S. Interior Department]], in efforts by the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] to strip Louisiana of its submerged land property rights. These control vast stores of reservoirs of petroleum and natural gas.\n\nWhen petroleum and gas [[1973 oil crisis|boomed]] in the 1970s, so did Louisiana's economy. The Louisiana economy as well as its politics of the last half-century cannot be understood without thoroughly accounting for the influence of the petroleum and gas industries. Since the 1980s, these industries' headquarters have consolidated in [[Houston]], but many of the jobs that operate or provide logistical support to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico crude-oil-and-gas industry remained in Louisiana {{as of|lc=y|2010}}.\n\n==Law and government==\n\n{{Politics of Louisiana}}\n<!--This section is linked from [[Law of the United Kingdom]]-->\n:{{Further|List of Louisiana Governors|Louisiana law|Louisiana Constitution}}\n[[File:Louisiana State Capitol Building.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Louisiana State Capitol]] in Baton Rouge, the [[Heights of state capitols|tallest state capitol building]] in the United States]]\n[[File:LAGovMansion.JPG|right|thumb|The Louisiana Governor's Mansion]]\n\nIn 1849, the state moved the capital from New Orleans to [[Baton Rouge]]. [[Donaldsonville, Louisiana|Donaldsonville]], [[Opelousas, Louisiana|Opelousas]], and [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] have briefly served as the seat of Louisiana state government. The [[Louisiana State Capitol]] and the [[Louisiana Governor's Mansion]] are both located in Baton Rouge. The [[Louisiana Supreme Court]], however, did not move to Baton Rouge but remains headquartered in New Orleans.\n\nLouisiana and California (whose supreme court is seated in San Francisco) are the only two states whose high courts are not headquartered in the state capital.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe current Louisiana governor is [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[John Bel Edwards]]. The current [[United States Senate|United States senators]] are Republicans [[John Neely Kennedy]] and [[Bill Cassidy]]. Louisiana has six [[congressional district]]s and is represented in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] by five Republicans and one Democrat. Louisiana had eight votes in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] for the [[2012 United States presidential election in Louisiana|2012 election]]. It lost one House seat due to stagnant population growth in the 2010 Census.\n\n===Administrative divisions===\n\nLouisiana is divided into 64 [[Parish (administrative division)|parishes]] (the equivalent of [[County (United States)|counties]] in most other states).<ref name=\"nativeamericans\">{{Handbook of Texas|id=bzi04|name=Native Americans}}</ref>\n* [[List of parishes in Louisiana]]\n* [[Louisiana census statistical areas]]\n\nMost parishes have an elected government known as the Police Jury, dating from the colonial days. It is the legislative and executive government of the parish, and is elected by the voters. Its members are called Jurors, and together they elect a president as their chairman.\n\nA more limited number of parishes operate under [[home rule]] charters, electing various forms of government. This include mayor\u2013council, council\u2013manager (in which the council hires a professional operating manager for the parish), and others.\n\n===Civil law===\n\nThe Louisiana political and legal structure has maintained several elements from the times of French and Spanish governance. One is the use of the term \"[[parish (Louisiana)|parish]]\" (from the French: ''paroisse'') in place of \"[[County (United States)|county]]\" for administrative subdivision. Another is the legal system of [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] based on French, German, and Spanish [[legal code]]s and ultimately [[Roman law]], as opposed to English [[common law]].\n\nLouisiana's civil law system is what the majority of nations in the world use, especially in Europe and its former colonies, excluding those that derive from the [[British Empire]]. However, it is incorrect to equate the Louisiana Civil Code with the [[Napoleonic Code]]. Although the Napoleonic Code and Louisiana law draw from common legal roots, the Napoleonic Code was never in force in Louisiana, as it was enacted in 1804, after the United States had [[Louisiana Purchase|purchased]] and annexed Louisiana in 1803.\n\nWhile the Louisiana Civil Code of 1808 has been continuously revised and updated since its enactment, it is still considered the controlling authority in the state. Differences are found between Louisianan civil law and the common law found in the other U.S. states. While some of these differences have been bridged due to the strong influence of common law tradition,<ref name=\"kinsellalaw\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kinsellalaw.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/dictionary.pdf |title=A Civil Law to Common Law Dictionary |accessdate=December 7, 2010 |last=Kinsella |first=Norman |year=1997 |website=KinsellaLaw.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225105448/http://www.kinsellalaw.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/dictionary.pdf |archivedate=December 25, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the civil law tradition is still deeply rooted in most aspects of Louisiana private law.

The franchise for whites was expanded somewhat during these decades, but blacks remained essentially disfranchised until after the [[civil rights movement]] of the mid-20th century, gaining enforcement of their constitutional rights through passage by Congress of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].\n\nSince the 1960s, when civil rights legislation was passed under President [[Lyndon Johnson]] to protect voting and civil rights, most African Americans in the state have affiliated with the Democratic Party. In the same years, many white social conservatives have moved to support Republican Party candidates in national, gubernatorial and statewide elections. In 2004, [[David Vitter]] was the first Republican in Louisiana to be popularly elected as a U.S. senator. The previous Republican senator, [[John S. Harris]], who took office in 1868 during Reconstruction, was chosen by the state legislature under the rules of the 19th century.\n\nLouisiana is unique among U.S. states in using a system for its state and local elections similar to that of modern France. All candidates, regardless of party affiliation, run in a [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] (or \"jungle primary\") on Election Day. If no candidate has more than 50% of the vote, the two candidates with the highest vote totals compete in a runoff election approximately one month later. This run-off method does not take into account party identification; therefore, it is not uncommon for a Democrat to be in a runoff with a fellow Democrat or a Republican to be in a runoff with a fellow Republican.\n\nCongressional races have also been held under the jungle primary system. All other states (except [[Washington Initiative 872 (2004)|Washington]], [[California Proposition 14 (2010)|California]], and [[Maine]]) use single-party primaries followed by a general election between party candidates, each conducted by either a [[plurality voting system]] or [[Two-round system|runoff voting]], to elect senators, representatives, and statewide officials. Between 2008 and 2010, federal [[United States Congress|congressional]] elections were run under a closed primary system\u2014limited to registered party members. However, upon the passage of House Bill 292, Louisiana again adopted a nonpartisan blanket primary for its federal congressional elections.\n\nLouisiana has six seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, five of which are currently held by Republicans and one by a Democrat. The state lost a House seat at the end of the [[112th Congress]] due to stagnant population growth as recorded by the [[2010 United States Census]]. Louisiana is not classified as a \"[[swing state]]\" for future presidential elections, as since the late 20th century, it has regularly supported Republican candidates. The state's two U.S. senators are [[Bill Cassidy]] (R) [[John Neely Kennedy]] (R).\n\n===Law enforcement===\n\n{{See also|List of law enforcement agencies in Louisiana}}\n\nLouisiana's statewide police force is the [[Louisiana State Police]]. It began in 1922 with the creation of the Highway Commission. In 1927, a second branch, the Bureau of Criminal Investigations, was formed. In 1932, the State Highway Patrol was authorized to carry weapons.\n\nOn July 28, 1936, the two branches were consolidated to form the Louisiana Department of State Police; its motto was \"courtesy, loyalty, service\". In 1942, this office was abolished and became a division of the Department of Public Safety, called the Louisiana State Police.

The State Police are primarily a traffic enforcement agency, with other sections that delve into trucking safety, narcotics enforcement, and gaming oversight.\n\nThe elected sheriff in each parish is the chief law enforcement officer in the parish. They are the keepers of the local parish prisons, which house felony and misdemeanor prisoners. They are the primary criminal patrol and first responder agency in all matters criminal and civil. They are also the official tax collectors in each parish. The sheriffs are responsible for general law enforcement in their respective parishes. Orleans Parish is an exception, as the general law enforcement duties fall to the New Orleans Police Department. Before 2010, Orleans parish was the only parish to have two sheriff's offices. Orleans Parish divided sheriffs' duties between criminal and civil, with a different elected sheriff overseeing each aspect. In 2006, a bill was passed which eventually consolidated the two sheriff's departments into one parish sheriff responsible for both civil and criminal matters.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 2015, Louisiana had a higher murder rate (10.3 per 100,000) than any other state in the country for the 27th straight year.

Conditions were harsh, the climate and soil were unsuitable for certain crops the colonists knew, and they suffered from regional tropical diseases. Both colonists and the slaves they imported had high mortality rates. The settlers kept importing slaves, which resulted in a high proportion of native Africans from West Africa, who continued to practice their culture in new surroundings. As described by historian [[Gwendolyn Midlo Hall]], they developed a marked Afro-Creole culture in the colonial era.<ref>Gwendolyn Midlo Hall, ''Africans in Colonial Louisiana: The Development of Afro-Creole Culture in the Eighteenth Century'' (1992)</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/laslave/|title=Afro-Louisiana History and Genealogy|website=www.ibiblio.org|accessdate=October 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190430233835/http://www.ibiblio.org/laslave/|archive-date=April 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAt the turn of the 18th century and in the early 1800s, New Orleans received a major influx of white and mixed-race refugees fleeing the violence of the [[Haitian Revolution]], many of whom brought their slaves with them. This added another infusion of African culture to the city, as more slaves in [[Saint-Domingue]] were from Africa than in the United States. They strongly influenced the African-American culture of the city in terms of dance, music and religious practices.\n\n===Louisiana Creole culture===\n\n[[Louisiana Creole people|Creole]] culture is an amalgamation of French, African, Spanish (and other European), and Native American cultures.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laheritage.org/CreoleHeritage/index.html |title=French Creole Heritage |publisher=Laheritage.org |date= |accessdate=April 23, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140830084559/http://www.laheritage.org/CreoleHeritage/index.html |archivedate=August 30, 2014 }}</ref> Creole comes from the Portuguese word ''crioulo''; originally it referred to a colonist of European (specifically French) descent who was born in the New World, in comparison to immigrants from France.<ref>Delehanty, Randolph. ''New Orleans: Elegance and Decadence, Chronicle Books'', 1995, pg. 14</ref> The oldest Louisiana manuscript to use the word \"Creole\", from 1782, applied it to a slave born in the French colony.<ref>Kein, Sybil. ''Creole: The History and Legacy of Louisiana's Free People of Color'', Louisiana State University Press, 2009, p. 73.</ref> But originally it referred more generally to the French colonists born in Louisiana.\n\nOver time, there developed in the French colony a relatively large group of [[Creoles of Color]] (''gens de couleur libres''), who were primarily descended from African slave women and French men (later other Europeans became part of the mix, as well as some Native Americans.) Often the French would free their concubines and [[mixed-race]] children, and pass on social capital to them. They might educate sons in France, for instance, and help them enter the French Army for a career. They also settled capital or property on their mistresses and children. The free people of color gained more rights in the colony and sometimes education; they generally spoke French and were Roman Catholic. Many became artisans and property owners. Over time, the term \"Creole\" became associated with this class of [[Creoles of Color]], many of whom achieved freedom long before the Civil War.\n\nWealthy French Creoles generally maintained town houses in [[New Orleans]] as well as houses on their large sugar plantations outside town along the Mississippi River. New Orleans had the largest population of free people of color in the region; they could find work there and created their own culture, marrying among themselves for decades.\n\n===Acadian culture===\n\nThe ancestors of [[Cajun]]s immigrated mostly from west central France to New France, where they settled in the Atlantic provinces of [[New Brunswick]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Prince Edward Island]], known originally as [[Acadia]]. After the British defeated France in the [[French and Indian War]] ([[Seven Years' War]]) in 1763, France ceded its territory east of the Mississippi River to Britain. The British forcibly separated families and evicted them from Acadia because they refused to vow loyalty to the new British regime. The Acadians were deported to England, New England, and France. Some escaped the British remained in [[French Canada]].\n\nOthers scattered, to France, Canada, Mexico, or the Falkland Islands. Many Acadian refugees settled in south Louisiana in the region around [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] and the LaFourche Bayou country. They developed a distinct rural culture there, different from the French Creole colonists of New Orleans. Intermarrying with others in the area, they developed what was called Cajun music, cuisine and culture. Until the 1970s, the term \"Cajun\" was considered somewhat derogatory.\n\n===Isle\u00f1o culture===\n\n{{Main|Isle\u00f1o (Louisiana)}}\n[[File:El_Museo_de_los_Isle\u00f1os.jpg|alt=|thumb|El Museo de los Isle\u00f1os (Isle\u00f1o Museum) in [[Saint Bernard, Louisiana|Saint Bernard]]]]\n\nA third distinct culture in Louisiana is that of the Isle\u00f1os. Its members are descendants of colonists from the [[Canary Islands]] who settled in [[Spanish Louisiana]] between 1778 and 1783 and intermarried with other communities such as [[French people|Frenchman]], [[Acadians]], [[Louisiana Creole people|Creoles]], [[Spaniards]], and other groups, mainly through the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nIn Louisiana, the Isle\u00f1os originally settled in four communities which included Galveztown, Valenzuela, Barataria, and San Bernardo. Of those settlements, Valenzuela and San Bernardo were the most successful as the other two were plagued with both disease and flooding. The large migration of [[Acadian]] refugees to [[Bayou Lafourche]] led to the rapid gallicization of the Valenzuela community while the community of San Bernardo ([[Saint Bernard Parish, Louisiana|Saint Bernard]]) was able to preserve much of its unique culture and language into the 21st century. This being said, the transmission of Spanish and other customs has completely halted in St. Bernard with those having competency in Spanish being octogenarians.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite book|title=The Language of the Isle\u00f1os: Vestigial Spanish in Louisiana|last1=Lipski|first1=John|date=July 1, 1990|publisher=Louisiana State University Press|isbn=0807115347|location=|pages=i, 4}}</ref>\n\nThrough the centuries, the various Isle\u00f1o communities of Louisiana have kept alive different elements of their Canary Islander heritage while also adopting and building upon the customs and traditions of the communities that surround them. Today two heritage associates exist for the communities: Los Isle\u00f1os Heritage and Cultural Society of St. Bernard as well as the Canary Islanders Heritage Society of Louisiana.

Of these, only Tunica, Caddo and Choctaw still have living native speakers, although several other tribes are working to teach and revitalize their languages. Other Native American peoples migrated into the region, escaping from European pressure from the east. Among these were [[Alabama language|Alabama]], Biloxi, Koasati, and Ofo peoples.\n\nStarting in the 1700s, French colonists began to settle along the coast and founded New Orleans. They established French culture and language institutions. They imported thousands of slaves from tribes of West Africa, who spoke several different languages. In the creolization process, the slaves developed a Louisiana Creole dialect incorporating both French and African forms, which colonists adopted to communicate with them, and which persisted beyond slavery. In the 20th century, there were still people of mixed race, particularly, who spoke Louisiana Creole French.\n\nDuring the 19th century after the [[Louisiana Purchase]] by the United States, English gradually gained prominence for business and government due to the shift in population with settlement by numerous Americans who were English speakers. Many ethnic French families continued to use French in private. Slaves and some free people of color also spoke Louisiana Creole French. The [[Constitution of Louisiana#Louisiana Constitution of 1812|State Constitution of 1812]] gave English official status in legal proceedings, but use of French remained widespread. Subsequent state constitutions reflect the diminishing importance of French. The 1868 constitution, passed during the [[Reconstruction era]] before Louisiana was re-admitted to the Union, banned laws requiring the publication of legal proceedings in languages other than English. Subsequently, the legal status of French recovered somewhat, but it never regained its pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] prominence.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5694&context=lalrev |title=The French Language in Louisiana Law and Legal Education: A Requiem |first=Roger K |last=Ward |journal=Louisiana Law Review |volume=57 |issue=4 |date=Summer 1997 |access-date=October 11, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621233419/http://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5694&context=lalrev |archive-date=June 21, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nSeveral unique dialects of French, Creole, and English are spoken in Louisiana. Dialects of the French language are: [[Colonial French]] and Houma French. [[Louisiana Creole French]] is the term for one of the Creole languages. Two unique dialects developed of the English language: [[Cajun English|Louisiana English]], a French-influenced variety of English in which dropping of postvocalic /r/ is common ; and what is informally known as [[Yat (New Orleans)|Yat]], which resembles the [[New York City English|New York City dialect]] sometimes with southern influences, particularly that of historical [[Brooklyn]]. Both accents were influenced by large communities of immigrant Irish and Italians, but the Yat dialect, which developed in New Orleans, was also influenced by French and Spanish.\n[[File:Signalisation routi\u00e8re bilingue \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e de la Louisiane.jpg|thumb|Louisiana's bilingual state welcome sign, recognizing its French heritage]]\n\n[[Colonial French]] was the dominant language of white settlers in [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] during the French colonial period; it was spoken primarily by the French Creoles (native-born). In addition to this dialect, the mixed-race people and slaves developed [[Louisiana Creole French|Louisiana Creole]], with a base in West African languages. The limited years of Spanish rule at the end of the 18th century did not result in widespread adoption of the Spanish language. French and Louisiana Creole are still used in modern-day Louisiana, often in family gatherings. English and its associated dialects became predominant after the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, after which the area became dominated by numerous English speakers. In some regions, English was influenced by French, as seen with Louisiana English. [[Colonial French]], although mistakenly named Cajun French by some Cajuns, has persisted alongside English.\n\nRenewed interest in the French language in Louisiana has led to the establishment of Canadian-modeled [[French immersion]] schools, as well as bilingual signage in the historic French neighborhoods of New Orleans and [[Lafayette (Louisiana)|Lafayette]]. In addition to private organizations, since 1968 the state has maintained the [[Council for the Development of French in Louisiana]] (CODOFIL), which promotes use of the French language in the state's tourism, economic development, culture, education and international relations.

[[Adjective]]s come before [[noun]]s. Nouns and adjectives are [[inflection|inflected]] for two [[Grammatical gender|genders]] (masc./fem.),<ref>Emeneau, M. B. (1962) \"Bilingualism and Structural Borrowing\" ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' 106(5): pp. 430\u2013442, p. 441</ref> two [[Grammatical number|numbers]] (sing./plur.), and four [[Grammatical case|cases]] (direct, oblique I, oblique II and vocative). There is also an inflection for the [[subjunctive mood]]. The [[verb]] system is very intricate with the following tenses: present, simple past, past progressive, present perfect, and past perfect. The sentence construction of Pashto has similarities with some other Indo-Iranian languages such as [[Prakrit]] and [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]]. The possessor precedes the possessed in the genitive construction. The verb generally agrees with the subject in both transitive and intransitive sentences. An exception occurs when a completed action is reported in any of the past tenses (simple past, past progressive, present perfect, or past perfect). In such cases, the verb agrees with the subject if it is intransitive, but if it is transitive, it agrees with the object,<ref name=\"Pashto-language\"/> therefore Pashto shows a partly [[ergative-absolutive language|ergative]] behaviour. Like [[Kurdish grammar|Kurdish]], but unlike most other Indo-Iranian languages, Pashto uses all three types of [[adpositional phrase|adpositions]] \u2013 prepositions, postpositions, and circumpositions.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Main article|Pashto phonology}}\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!\n!

In particular, the retroflex fricatives, which represent the original pronunciation of these sounds, are preserved in the southern/southwestern dialects (especially the prestige dialect of [[Kandahar]]), while they are pronounced as palatal fricatives in the west-central dialects. Other dialects merge the original retroflexes with other existing sounds: The southeastern dialects merge them with the [[Postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]] fricatives {{IPA|/\u0283, \u0292/}}, while the northern/northeastern dialects merge them with the [[Velar consonant|velar]] phonemes in an asymmetric pattern, pronouncing them as {{IPA|/x, \u0261/}} ('''not''' {{IPA|/\u0263/}}). Furthermore, according to Henderson (1983),<ref name=\"Henderson 1983\"/> the west-central [[voiced palatal fricative]] {{IPA|/\u029d/}} actually occurs only in the [[Wardak Province]], and is merged into {{IPA|/\u0261/}} elsewhere in the region.\n\nThe [[velar]]s {{IPA|/k, \u0261, x, \u0263/}} followed by the [[close back rounded vowel]] {{IPA|/u/}} assimilate into the [[Labialisation|labialized]] velars {{IPA|[k\u02b7, \u0261\u02b7, x\u02b7, \u0263\u02b7]}}.\n\nVoiceless stops {{IPA|[p, t, t\u0361\u0283, k]}} are all [[Aspirated consonant|unaspirated]], like [[Spanish language|Spanish]], other [[Romance languages]], and [[Austronesian languages]]; they have slightly [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] allophones prevocalically in a stressed syllable.\n\n==Vocabulary==\nIn Pashto, most of the native elements of the lexicon are related to other [[Eastern Iranian languages]].

Written Pashto literature saw a rise in development in the 17th century mostly due to poets like [[Khushal Khan Khattak]] (1613\u20131689), who, along with [[Rahman Baba]] (1650\u20131715), is widely regarded as among the greatest Pashto poets. From the time of [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] (1722\u20131772), Pashto has been the language of the court. The first Pashto teaching text was written during the period of Ahmad Shah Durrani by Pir Mohammad Kakar with the title of ''Ma\u02bfrifat al-Afgh\u0101n\u012b'' (\"The Knowledge of Afghani [Pashto]\"). After that, the first grammar book of Pashto [[verb]]s was written in 1805 under the title of ''Riy\u0101\u017c al-Ma\u1e25abbah'' (\"Training in Affection\") through the patronage of Nawab Mahabat Khan, son of [[Hafiz Rahmat Khan]], chief of the [[Barech]]. Nawabullah Yar Khan, another son of Hafiz Rahmat Khan, in 1808 wrote a book of Pashto words entitled ''\u02bfAj\u0101yib al-Lugh\u0101t'' (\"Wonders of Languages\").\n\n===Poetry example===\nAn excerpt from the ''Kal\u0101m'' of [[Rahman Baba]]:\n\n{{lang|ps|2=\n\u0632\u06c0 \u0631\u062d\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u06c0 \u062e\u067e\u0644\u0647 \u06ab\u0631\u0645 \u064a\u0645  \u0686\u06d0 \u0645\u064a\u0646 \u064a\u0645<br />\n\u0686\u06d0 \u062f\u0627 \u0646\u0648\u0631 \u067c\u0648\u067e\u0646 \u0645\u06d0 \u0628\u0648\u0644\u064a \u06ab\u0631\u0645 \u067e\u0647 \u0685\u06c0\n}}\n\n'''IPA:''' ''Z\u0259 ra.m\u0251n p\u0259 xp\u0259l.a gram j\u0259m t\u0361\u0283e ma.j\u0259n j\u0259m''<br />\n''t\u0361\u0283e d\u032a\u0251 nor \u0288o.pan me bo.li gram p\u0259 t\u0361s\u0259''\n\n'''Transliteration:''' ''Z\u0259 Rahm\u0101n p\u0259 xp\u0259la gram y\u0259m \u010de may\u0259n y\u0259m''<br />\n''\u010ce d\u0101 nor \u1e6dopan me boli gram p\u0259 ts\u0259''\n\n'''Translation:''' \"I Rahman, myself am guilty that I am a lover,<br />\nOn what does this other universe call me guilty.\"\n\n===Proverbs===\nPashto also has a rich heritage of proverbs (Pashto ''matal\u016bna'', sg.

Some of those who wrote in Pashto are [[Pir Roshan|Bayazid Pir Roshan]] (a major inventor of the [[Pashto alphabet]]), [[Khushal Khan Khattak]], [[Rahman Baba]], [[Nazo Tokhi]], and [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]], founder of the modern state of Afghanistan or the [[Durrani Empire]].\n\nIn modern times, noticing the incursion of Persian and Arabic vocabulary, there is a strong desire to \"[[Linguistic purism|purify]]\" Pashto by restoring its old vocabulary.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fdTJgCSPsGwC&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=pashto+purification#v=onepage&q=pashto%20purification&f=false |title=Afghanistan 101: Understanding Afghan Culture |author=Ehsan M Entezar |page=89 |publisher=Xlibris Corporation |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4257-9302-9}}</ref>{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}<ref name=\"BensonKosonen2013\">{{cite book|author1=Carol Benson|author2=Kimmo Kosonen|title=Language Issues in Comparative Education: Inclusive Teaching and Learning in Non-Dominant Languages and Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tdREAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA64|date=13 June 2013|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-94-6209-218-1|pages=64\u2013}}</ref><ref>[http://www.hewad.com/mohammadgul/ Muhammad Gul Khan Momand], Hew\u0101d Afghanistan</ref>\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main article|Pashto grammar}}\nPashto is a [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]] (SOV) language with [[split ergativity]]. [[Adjective]]s come before [[noun]]s. Nouns and adjectives are [[inflection|inflected]] for two [[Grammatical gender|genders]] (masc./fem.),<ref>Emeneau, M. B. (1962) \"Bilingualism and Structural Borrowing\" ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' 106(5): pp. 430\u2013442, p. 441</ref> two [[Grammatical number|numbers]] (sing./plur.), and four [[Grammatical case|cases]] (direct, oblique I, oblique II and vocative). There is also an inflection for the [[subjunctive mood]]. The [[verb]] system is very intricate with the following tenses: present, simple past, past progressive, present perfect, and past perfect. The sentence construction of Pashto has similarities with some other Indo-Iranian languages such as [[Prakrit]] and [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]]. The possessor precedes the possessed in the genitive construction. The verb generally agrees with the subject in both transitive and intransitive sentences. An exception occurs when a completed action is reported in any of the past tenses (simple past, past progressive, present perfect, or past perfect). In such cases, the verb agrees with the subject if it is intransitive, but if it is transitive, it agrees with the object,<ref name=\"Pashto-language\"/> therefore Pashto shows a partly [[ergative-absolutive language|ergative]] behaviour. Like [[Kurdish grammar|Kurdish]], but unlike most other Indo-Iranian languages, Pashto uses all three types of [[adpositional phrase|adpositions]] \u2013 prepositions, postpositions, and circumpositions.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Main article|Pashto phonology}}\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!\n!

In particular, the retroflex fricatives, which represent the original pronunciation of these sounds, are preserved in the southern/southwestern dialects (especially the prestige dialect of [[Kandahar]]), while they are pronounced as palatal fricatives in the west-central dialects. Other dialects merge the original retroflexes with other existing sounds: The southeastern dialects merge them with the [[Postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]] fricatives {{IPA|/\u0283, \u0292/}}, while the northern/northeastern dialects merge them with the [[Velar consonant|velar]] phonemes in an asymmetric pattern, pronouncing them as {{IPA|/x, \u0261/}} ('''not''' {{IPA|/\u0263/}}). Furthermore, according to Henderson (1983),<ref name=\"Henderson 1983\"/> the west-central [[voiced palatal fricative]] {{IPA|/\u029d/}} actually occurs only in the [[Wardak Province]], and is merged into {{IPA|/\u0261/}} elsewhere in the region.\n\nThe [[velar]]s {{IPA|/k, \u0261, x, \u0263/}} followed by the [[close back rounded vowel]] {{IPA|/u/}} assimilate into the [[Labialisation|labialized]] velars {{IPA|[k\u02b7, \u0261\u02b7, x\u02b7, \u0263\u02b7]}}.\n\nVoiceless stops {{IPA|[p, t, t\u0361\u0283, k]}} are all [[Aspirated consonant|unaspirated]], like [[Spanish language|Spanish]], other [[Romance languages]], and [[Austronesian languages]]; they have slightly [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] allophones prevocalically in a stressed syllable.\n\n==Vocabulary==\nIn Pashto, most of the native elements of the lexicon are related to other [[Eastern Iranian languages]].

Written Pashto literature saw a rise in development in the 17th century mostly due to poets like [[Khushal Khan Khattak]] (1613\u20131689), who, along with [[Rahman Baba]] (1650\u20131715), is widely regarded as among the greatest Pashto poets. From the time of [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] (1722\u20131772), Pashto has been the language of the court. The first Pashto teaching text was written during the period of Ahmad Shah Durrani by Pir Mohammad Kakar with the title of ''Ma\u02bfrifat al-Afgh\u0101n\u012b'' (\"The Knowledge of Afghani [Pashto]\"). After that, the first grammar book of Pashto [[verb]]s was written in 1805 under the title of ''Riy\u0101\u017c al-Ma\u1e25abbah'' (\"Training in Affection\") through the patronage of Nawab Mahabat Khan, son of [[Hafiz Rahmat Khan]], chief of the [[Barech]]. Nawabullah Yar Khan, another son of Hafiz Rahmat Khan, in 1808 wrote a book of Pashto words entitled ''\u02bfAj\u0101yib al-Lugh\u0101t'' (\"Wonders of Languages\").\n\n===Poetry example===\nAn excerpt from the ''Kal\u0101m'' of [[Rahman Baba]]:\n\n{{lang|ps|2=\n\u0632\u06c0 \u0631\u062d\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u06c0 \u062e\u067e\u0644\u0647 \u06ab\u0631\u0645 \u064a\u0645  \u0686\u06d0 \u0645\u064a\u0646 \u064a\u0645<br />\n\u0686\u06d0 \u062f\u0627 \u0646\u0648\u0631 \u067c\u0648\u067e\u0646 \u0645\u06d0 \u0628\u0648\u0644\u064a \u06ab\u0631\u0645 \u067e\u0647 \u0685\u06c0\n}}\n\n'''IPA:''' ''Z\u0259 ra.m\u0251n p\u0259 xp\u0259l.a gram j\u0259m t\u0361\u0283e ma.j\u0259n j\u0259m''<br />\n''t\u0361\u0283e d\u032a\u0251 nor \u0288o.pan me bo.li gram p\u0259 t\u0361s\u0259''\n\n'''Transliteration:''' ''Z\u0259 Rahm\u0101n p\u0259 xp\u0259la gram y\u0259m \u010de may\u0259n y\u0259m''<br />\n''\u010ce d\u0101 nor \u1e6dopan me boli gram p\u0259 ts\u0259''\n\n'''Translation:''' \"I Rahman, myself am guilty that I am a lover,<br />\nOn what does this other universe call me guilty.\"\n\n===Proverbs===\nPashto also has a rich heritage of proverbs (Pashto ''matal\u016bna'', sg.

Low poly meshes occur in real-time applications (e.g. games) as contrast with high poly meshes in [[animated movies]] and special effects of the same era.

Polygons can, in theory, have any number of sides but are commonly broken down into [[triangle]]s for display. In general the more triangles in a mesh the more detailed the object is, but the more computationally intensive it is to display. In order to decrease render times (i.e. increase [[frames per second|frame rate]]) the number of triangles in the scene must be reduced, by using low poly meshes.<ref>{{cite book |title=Autodesk 3ds Max 9 essentials |last=[[Autodesk]] |first= |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher=[[Focal Press]] |location= |isbn= |page=190 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9mu1TITGhUC&pg=PA214&dq=%22low+poly%22&hl=en&ei=05MkTuTTKJDZiALa87i9Aw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22low%20poly%22&f=false |accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nComputer graphics techniques such as [[normal mapping|normal]] and [[bump mapping]] have been designed to compensate for the decrease of polygons by making a low poly object appear to contain more detail than it does. This is done by altering the shading of polygons to contain internal detail which is not in the mesh.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zyh4HXuHTPMC&pg=PA144&dq=%22low+poly%22+%22bump+mapping%22&hl=en&ei=ubYkTp3vHvPWiALL9tXyCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22low%20poly%22%20%22bump%20mapping%22&f=false|title=Game design course: principles, practice, and techniques|last=Thompson|first=Jim|author2=Berbank-Green, Barnaby|author3=Cusworth, Nic|publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]]|year=2007|isbn=|location=|page=144|pages=|authorlink=|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Polygon budget==\n[[Image:Normal map example.png|thumb|An example of normal mapping used to add detail to a low poly (500 triangle) mesh]]\nA combination of the [[game engine]] or rendering method and the computer being used defines the '''polygon budget'''; the number of polygons which can appear in a scene and still be rendered at an acceptable frame rate. Therefore the use of low poly meshes are mostly confined to computer games and other software a user must manipulate 3D objects in real time because processing power is limited to that of a typical [[personal computer]] or [[games console]] and the frame rate must be high.<ref>{{cite book |title=3D game programming all in one |last=C.

In addition, computer processing power in these situations is typically less limited, often using a large network of computers or what is known as a [[render farm]]. Each frame can take hours to create, despite the enormous computer power involved. A common example of the difference this makes is [[full motion video]] sequences in computer games which, because they can be pre-rendered, look much smoother than the games themselves.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\n==Aesthetic==\nModels that are said to be low poly often appear blocky and simple while still maintaining the basic shape of what they are meant to represent. With [[computer graphics]] getting more powerful, it has become increasingly computationally cheap to render low poly graphics. Some artists use the resulting low-detail from a low polygon count as an aesthetic rather than as an optimization technique.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sessions.edu/notes-on-design/whats-the-deal-with-low-poly-art/|title=Low Poly Art - Notes on Design|date=2015-01-15|work=Sessions College|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}</ref> They are often used by [[Independent video game development|indie developers]] due to being faster and cheaper to create. In addition, there is an element of [[nostalgia]] to low poly styles, hearkening to older video game consoles such as the [[Nintendo 64]] or the [[PlayStation (console)]]. Since they often achieve a certain [[retro style]], serving as a 3-Dimensional analog to the 2-Dimensional [[pixel art]].{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Low poly as a relative term ===\nThere is no defined threshold for a mesh to be low poly; low poly is always a relative term and depends on (amongst other factors):{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\n* The time the meshes were designed and for what hardware\n* The detail required in the final mesh\n* The shape and properties of the object in question\n\nAs computing power inevitably increases, the number of polygons that can be used increases too. For example, [[Super Mario 64]] would be considered low poly today, but was considered a stunning achievement when it was released in 1996. Similarly, in 2018, using hundreds of polygons on a leaf in the background of a scene would be considered high poly, but using that many polygons on the main character would be considered low poly. In this way, there is a relativism between the importance of objects and their graphical quality. More important objects such as [[Non-player character]]<nowiki/>s usually contain a higher amount of detail than less important objects, which are often small or in the background, like a blade of grass. This relativism is subverted when low-poly is used as an intentional aesthetic style: every object shares the simplicity that a low number of polygons brings, making the distinction between important features and unimportant features less clear.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n[[File:Low Poly Mountains.jpg|thumb|Example of using low poly stylistically]]\n\n=== Emergence as an aesthetic style ===\nLow poly graphics emerged around late 2013 as a specific style when content creators began to redefine the difference between high-poly and low-poly. Instead of using a low number of polygons as a necessity, creators like Timothy J. Reynolds recognized how the usage of fewer polygons sharpens the focus on essential artistic elements like form, lighting, and texture<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lesterbanks.com/2014/03/polygons-dont-see-low-poly-art-timothy-j-reynolds/|title=It's the Polygons You Don't See, The Low Poly Art of Timothy J. Reynolds|date=2014-03-05|website=Lesterbanks|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref>. The emergence of the style is somewhat similar to earlier artistic movements where artists like [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]] tried to decompose objects into geometric shapes. The low poly style seeks to highlight the idea that the world can be represented by a composition of shapes, which makes it a self aware style that is intentionally vague.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\n=== Popularity in video games and other mediums ===\nAlthough it has gained some traction in the art world, low-poly is a much more established style in video games, since it serves the dual purpose of reducing development time and giving the game a unique aesthetic style. The oldest game on the popular game distribution site [[Steam (software)|Steam]] with the tag \"low-poly\" is Mirror Moon EP, an space-themed exploration game with an emphasis on the low-poly style, which was released in September 2013. In 2014, Richard Whitelock published ''Into this Wylde Abyss'', a short, story driven survival game with a similarly low-poly style. From that point on, the genre expanded quickly. From 2014 to 2018, there were 244 titles published on Steam with a low poly tag. Some of the most notable titles include [[Superhot]], [[Necropolis (video game)|Necropolis]], and [[Grow Up (video game)|Grow Up]].\n\n==Low poly meshes in physics engines==\n[[Physics engine]]s have presented a new role for low poly meshes. Since the display of computer graphics has become very efficient, allowing  the display of tens to hundreds of thousands of polygons at 25 frames per second on a desktop computer, low-poly has been almost universally phased out of games by limitation, giving rise to the emergence of low poly as an artistic choice instead of a practical one.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Polygon (computer graphics)]]\n* [[Bump mapping]]\n* [[Normal mapping]]\n* [[Sprite (computer graphics)|Sprites]]\n* [[Nurbs]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:3D computer graphics]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2012}}\n{{Refimprove|date=July 2011}}\n\n[[File:Dolphin triangle mesh.png|thumb|250px|This polygon mesh representing a dolphin would be considered low poly by modern (2020) standards]]\n'''Low poly''' is a [[polygon mesh]] in [[3D computer graphics]] that has a relatively small number of polygons.

The term ''low poly'' is used in both a technical and a descriptive sense; the number of polygons in a mesh is an important factor to optimize for [[computer performance|performance]] but can give an undesirable appearance to the resulting [[computer graphics|graphics]].<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=d0RlI4x0lHsC&pg=PA240&dq=Low+poly&hl=en&ei=HXMcTvDREISz8QOtwOCOCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Low%20poly&f=false |title=Introducing 3ds Max 2008|author=Dariush Derakhshani, Randi Lorene Munn|page=240|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year= 2008 |accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Necessity for low poly meshes==\nPolygon meshes are one of the major methods of modelling a 3D object for display by a computer. Polygons can, in theory, have any number of sides but are commonly broken down into [[triangle]]s for display. In general the more triangles in a mesh the more detailed the object is, but the more computationally intensive it is to display. In order to decrease render times (i.e. increase [[frames per second|frame rate]]) the number of triangles in the scene must be reduced, by using low poly meshes.<ref>{{cite book |title=Autodesk 3ds Max 9 essentials |last=[[Autodesk]] |first= |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher=[[Focal Press]] |location= |isbn= |page=190 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9mu1TITGhUC&pg=PA214&dq=%22low+poly%22&hl=en&ei=05MkTuTTKJDZiALa87i9Aw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22low%20poly%22&f=false |accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nComputer graphics techniques such as [[normal mapping|normal]] and [[bump mapping]] have been designed to compensate for the decrease of polygons by making a low poly object appear to contain more detail than it does. This is done by altering the shading of polygons to contain internal detail which is not in the mesh.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zyh4HXuHTPMC&pg=PA144&dq=%22low+poly%22+%22bump+mapping%22&hl=en&ei=ubYkTp3vHvPWiALL9tXyCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22low%20poly%22%20%22bump%20mapping%22&f=false|title=Game design course: principles, practice, and techniques|last=Thompson|first=Jim|author2=Berbank-Green, Barnaby|author3=Cusworth, Nic|publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]]|year=2007|isbn=|location=|page=144|pages=|authorlink=|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Polygon budget==\n[[Image:Normal map example.png|thumb|An example of normal mapping used to add detail to a low poly (500 triangle) mesh]]\nA combination of the [[game engine]] or rendering method and the computer being used defines the '''polygon budget'''; the number of polygons which can appear in a scene and still be rendered at an acceptable frame rate. Therefore the use of low poly meshes are mostly confined to computer games and other software a user must manipulate 3D objects in real time because processing power is limited to that of a typical [[personal computer]] or [[games console]] and the frame rate must be high.<ref>{{cite book |title=3D game programming all in one |last=C. Finney |first=Kenneth |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=415\u2013416 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cknGqaHwPFkC&pg=PA415&dq=%22low+poly%22+polygon+budget&hl=en&ei=FpgkTs2MOcPniALNsLS1Aw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22low%20poly%22%20polygon%20budget&f=false |accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref> [[Computer generated imagery]], for example, for [[films]] or still images have a higher polygon budget because rendering does not need to be done in real-time, which requires higher frame rates. In addition, computer processing power in these situations is typically less limited, often using a large network of computers or what is known as a [[render farm]]. Each frame can take hours to create, despite the enormous computer power involved. A common example of the difference this makes is [[full motion video]] sequences in computer games which, because they can be pre-rendered, look much smoother than the games themselves.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\n==Aesthetic==\nModels that are said to be low poly often appear blocky and simple while still maintaining the basic shape of what they are meant to represent. With [[computer graphics]] getting more powerful, it has become increasingly computationally cheap to render low poly graphics. Some artists use the resulting low-detail from a low polygon count as an aesthetic rather than as an optimization technique.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sessions.edu/notes-on-design/whats-the-deal-with-low-poly-art/|title=Low Poly Art - Notes on Design|date=2015-01-15|work=Sessions College|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}</ref> They are often used by [[Independent video game development|indie developers]] due to being faster and cheaper to create. In addition, there is an element of [[nostalgia]] to low poly styles, hearkening to older video game consoles such as the [[Nintendo 64]] or the [[PlayStation (console)]]. Since they often achieve a certain [[retro style]], serving as a 3-Dimensional analog to the 2-Dimensional [[pixel art]].{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Low poly as a relative term ===\nThere is no defined threshold for a mesh to be low poly; low poly is always a relative term and depends on (amongst other factors):{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\n* The time the meshes were designed and for what hardware\n* The detail required in the final mesh\n* The shape and properties of the object in question\n\nAs computing power inevitably increases, the number of polygons that can be used increases too. For example, [[Super Mario 64]] would be considered low poly today, but was considered a stunning achievement when it was released in 1996. Similarly, in 2018, using hundreds of polygons on a leaf in the background of a scene would be considered high poly, but using that many polygons on the main character would be considered low poly. In this way, there is a relativism between the importance of objects and their graphical quality. More important objects such as [[Non-player character]]<nowiki/>s usually contain a higher amount of detail than less important objects, which are often small or in the background, like a blade of grass. This relativism is subverted when low-poly is used as an intentional aesthetic style: every object shares the simplicity that a low number of polygons brings, making the distinction between important features and unimportant features less clear.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n[[File:Low Poly Mountains.jpg|thumb|Example of using low poly stylistically]]\n\n=== Emergence as an aesthetic style ===\nLow poly graphics emerged around late 2013 as a specific style when content creators began to redefine the difference between high-poly and low-poly. Instead of using a low number of polygons as a necessity, creators like Timothy J. Reynolds recognized how the usage of fewer polygons sharpens the focus on essential artistic elements like form, lighting, and texture<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lesterbanks.com/2014/03/polygons-dont-see-low-poly-art-timothy-j-reynolds/|title=It's the Polygons You Don't See, The Low Poly Art of Timothy J. Reynolds|date=2014-03-05|website=Lesterbanks|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref>. The emergence of the style is somewhat similar to earlier artistic movements where artists like [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]] tried to decompose objects into geometric shapes. The low poly style seeks to highlight the idea that the world can be represented by a composition of shapes, which makes it a self aware style that is intentionally vague.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\n=== Popularity in video games and other mediums ===\nAlthough it has gained some traction in the art world, low-poly is a much more established style in video games, since it serves the dual purpose of reducing development time and giving the game a unique aesthetic style. The oldest game on the popular game distribution site [[Steam (software)|Steam]] with the tag \"low-poly\" is Mirror Moon EP, an space-themed exploration game with an emphasis on the low-poly style, which was released in September 2013. In 2014, Richard Whitelock published ''Into this Wylde Abyss'', a short, story driven survival game with a similarly low-poly style. From that point on, the genre expanded quickly. From 2014 to 2018, there were 244 titles published on Steam with a low poly tag. Some of the most notable titles include [[Superhot]], [[Necropolis (video game)|Necropolis]], and [[Grow Up (video game)|Grow Up]].\n\n==Low poly meshes in physics engines==\n[[Physics engine]]s have presented a new role for low poly meshes. Since the display of computer graphics has become very efficient, allowing  the display of tens to hundreds of thousands of polygons at 25 frames per second on a desktop computer, low-poly has been almost universally phased out of games by limitation, giving rise to the emergence of low poly as an artistic choice instead of a practical one.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Polygon (computer graphics)]]\n* [[Bump mapping]]\n* [[Normal mapping]]\n* [[Sprite (computer graphics)|Sprites]]\n* [[Nurbs]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:3D computer graphics]]\n", "name_user": "77.49.191.235", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_poly"}
