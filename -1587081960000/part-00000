He also represented the [[United States]] in the [[single scull]] at the [[1960 Summer Olympics]].\n\n== Rowing career ==\n\nParker attended the [[University of Pennsylvania]] as an [[undergraduate]], where he majored in Philosophy and learned [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]].  Mentored by Pennsylvania's coach [[Joe Burk]], Parker rowed on the 1955 Penn Varsity crew that won the Grand Challenge Cup at the [[Henley Royal Regatta]].\n\nAfter college, Parker began to scull competitively.  He won the single scull (one man boat) at the 1959 [[Pan American Games]].  In 1959, Parker also competed in the Diamond Scull event at the [[Henley Royal Regatta]] finishing second to six-time champion [[Stuart MacKenzie]].\n\nIn 1960, he won the U.S. [[Olympic games|Olympic]] trials in the single scull.  At the [[1960 Summer Olympics]] in Rome, Parker made the finals and finished fifth.\n\n== Coaching career ==\n\nDuring his training for the national team, Parker's name was forwarded to the athletic director at [[Harvard]], Tom Bolles, who appointed the 27-year-old oarsman as the freshman coach in 1961.  When Harvard's varsity coach, Harvey Love, died suddenly of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in the spring of 1963, Parker was promoted to the varsity level, purely on an interim basis.  The crew had an uneven spring, and performed poorly at the [[Eastern Sprints]] (the league championship for the EARC).  The annual highpoint of the Harvard rowing season is the [[Harvard\u2013Yale Regatta|Harvard-Yale race]] (the oldest and longest-running intercollegiate sporting event in the United States) held in June. Parker meticulously prepared his crew for their biggest race of the year.  Heavy underdogs against the favored Yale crew, the Harvard varsity pulled off an upset.  Parker was appointed permanent coach of the varsity crew. Harvard would not lose to Yale until 1981.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Parker SI.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Parker on Sports Illustrated Cover]] -->Parker's success was immediate and unprecedented. His crews won the Eastern Sprints every year between 1964 and 1970.  Parker coached a Harvard four man boat (4+) at the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in [[Tokyo]].  Parker and the Harvard crew made the cover of [[Sports Illustrated]] in 1965. Parker's crews won the 1967 [[Pan American Games]], and finished second at the 1967 European Championships.  Parker's 1968 crew earned the right to represent the United States at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]]\u2014the last collegiate crew ever to do so.  The Harvard 8 narrowly won the Olympic trials by 5/100th of a second over of a powerful University of Pennsylvania crew \u2013 a race that pitted Parker against his mentor Joe Burk.\n\nIn Mexico, one of Harvard's rowers became ill and had to be replaced.  Harvard made the finals and finished sixth.  Several members of the crew were involved in the political turmoil which swept over the games.<ref>[http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/documents/olyhmeight.asp \"Olympics '68: The Politics of Hypocrisy\"]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050103121537/http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/documents/olyhmeight.asp |date=January 3, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nHarvard was the last non-national team crew to represent the United States in the Olympics in the 8+ man event.  Until 1960, the United States, using a trial system where the best 8 man crew went to the Olympics, had won every gold medal.  But the rest of the world had caught up and was surpassing the USA. In particular, [[Karl Adam, Rowing Coach|Karl Adam]] and his Ratzeburg crews from West Germany had become the team to beat. (Parker was one of the first US coaches to adopt Adam's methods). In 1972, the NAAO, the then governing organization for rowing in the United States, put together a national camp system to help ensure that the best rowers were in the national boat.  Parker was named head coach. With Parker at the helm and with numerous former Harvard oarsmen in the boat, Team USA finished second to New Zealand earning a silver medal in the 8+ at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in Munich.\nIn the 1970s, Parker's Harvard crews continued to be successful.  They did not win the Sprints in the years 1971\u20131973, but the losses were close.  Then came the 1974 and 1975 Harvard varsities which are considered{{By whom|date=January 2012}} to be among the greatest in the history of the sport. They swept the collegiate competition, including dual races each year against the undefeated west coast champions [[University of Washington|Washington]]. Numerous team members went on to row for the national team. Post-season, the 1975 crew went to England to race at the [[Henley Royal Regatta]].  They finished second in the premier event of the regatta, the Grand Challenge Cup, losing to the [[England|British]] national team by two lengths.\n\nParker was also a path-breaking coach: he was the first women's national team coach in 1975. That eight went on to win a silver medal at the World Rowing Championships (the so-called Red Rose Crew).  Parker would go on to coach the USA women's eight (8+) at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in [[Montreal]] where they earned a Bronze medal.\n\nParker's crews continued to be formidable in the mid and late 1970s, winning the Eastern Sprints in 1975, 1976, 1977 and 1980.  But Yale was on the rise; it won the Eastern Sprints in 1978 and 1979 and beat Harvard in doing so.  Still, Harvard continued to win the Harvard-Yale race. Parker ran his streak to 18 years.  Finally, in 1981, Yale ended the streak and would go on to win the next three races.\n[[File:Harvard Rowing Crew at Henley 2004 -2.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Harvard men's eight at Henley, 2004]]\n\nIn 1983, Harvard won the Eastern Sprints, and in one of the best collegiate races ever,{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} snatched the inaugural [[National Collegiate Rowing Championship]] by coming from a length down with 500 meters to go and catching a super-fast [[University of Washington|Washington]] boat at the line. Parker's 1985 Harvard varsity \u2013 after some early-season losses \u2013 won the Eastern Sprints, the National Collegiate Rowing Championship and the Grand Challenge Cup at the [[Henley Royal Regatta]].\n\nThrough the late 1980s and early 1990s, Harvard continued to be a dominating presence in rowing.  Parker's crews won the national championship in 1983, 1985, 1987, 1988, 1989  and 1992, and they were Eastern Sprints champions in 1988, 1989, and 1990.\n\nThe national championship race was disbanded in 1996, following which the [[Intercollegiate Rowing Association]] Championship, also known as the IRA, became the ''de facto'' national championship. Harvard had never gone to the IRAs during Parker's tenure, but in 2003, after a decade of good showings but no championships, Parker's varsity won the Eastern Sprints and decided to go to the IRA, which they also won.  They continued the streak by winning both the Eastern Sprints and the IRAs in 2004 and 2005.\n\nThe 2004 crew may have been Harvard's fastest crew ever. National team crews are older and more experienced than college oarsmen, and are far better prepared than when Harvard raced in the 1968 Summer Olympics.  Following the 2004 season, the Harvard varsity went to Europe, where it rowed in the World Cup in [[Lucerne]] which was a tune-up for most of the national teams competing in the Olympics. In an upset,{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Harvard made the finals at Lucerne by defeating the [[Great Britain|British]] and [[France|French]] Olympic squads. Harvard lost to the five national teams in the finals at Lucerne, which included four of the top six finishers at the [[2004 Summer Olympics|Olympic games]]\u2014but they were competitive for the length of the course. Harvard then competed in the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley, losing in the finals to the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Olympic 8+, which was also an Olympic finalist.\n\nHarry coached many entrances in the Henley Royal Regatta. His last attendance of the regatta, in 2012, saw his Varsity win by a foot over Leander in the Ladies' Plate. In 2013, two weeks after Harry's death, four members of his final varsity, coached by Bill Manning, broke the record in the Visitor's Challenge Cup.\n\nParker has nine official (or quasi-official) national championships, which is the second most among active coaches. Parker's crews from the 1960s and 1970s won several unofficial titles.\n\nHe completed 51 seasons at the helm, having confirmed his place as the most significant American coach of the latter half of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hewitt |first=Ed |title=Harry Parker has passed; a remembrance, 1935\u20132013 |url=http://www.row2k.com/features/744/Harry-Parker-has-passed--a-remembrance--1935-2013/#.UcyjzuD-hdZ |publisher=Row2k |accessdate=June 27, 2013 |date=June 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Harry Parker Boathouse ==\nOn September 10, 2008, [[Community Rowing, Inc.]] announced that it would name its new boathouse after Harry Parker.

It ended with their [[divorce]] in 1979. George Franklin Parker and David Lambert Parker were born during the 1960s.

He also represented the [[United States]] in the [[single scull]] at the [[1960 Summer Olympics]].\n\n== Rowing career ==\n\nParker attended the [[University of Pennsylvania]] as an [[undergraduate]], where he majored in Philosophy and learned [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]].  Mentored by Pennsylvania's coach [[Joe Burk]], Parker rowed on the 1955 Penn Varsity crew that won the Grand Challenge Cup at the [[Henley Royal Regatta]].\n\nAfter college, Parker began to scull competitively.  He won the single scull (one man boat) at the 1959 [[Pan American Games]].  In 1959, Parker also competed in the Diamond Scull event at the [[Henley Royal Regatta]] finishing second to six-time champion [[Stuart MacKenzie]].\n\nIn 1960, he won the U.S. [[Olympic games|Olympic]] trials in the single scull.  At the [[1960 Summer Olympics]] in Rome, Parker made the finals and finished fifth.\n\n== Coaching career ==\n\nDuring his training for the national team, Parker's name was forwarded to the athletic director at [[Harvard]], Tom Bolles, who appointed the 27-year-old oarsman as the freshman coach in 1961.  When Harvard's varsity coach, Harvey Love, died suddenly of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in the spring of 1963, Parker was promoted to the varsity level, purely on an interim basis.  The crew had an uneven spring, and performed poorly at the [[Eastern Sprints]] (the league championship for the EARC).  The annual highpoint of the Harvard rowing season is the [[Harvard\u2013Yale Regatta|Harvard-Yale race]] (the oldest and longest-running intercollegiate sporting event in the United States) held in June. Parker meticulously prepared his crew for their biggest race of the year.  Heavy underdogs against the favored Yale crew, the Harvard varsity pulled off an upset.  Parker was appointed permanent coach of the varsity crew. Harvard would not lose to Yale until 1981.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Parker SI.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Parker on Sports Illustrated Cover]] -->Parker's success was immediate and unprecedented. His crews won the Eastern Sprints every year between 1964 and 1970.  Parker coached a Harvard four man boat (4+) at the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in [[Tokyo]].  Parker and the Harvard crew made the cover of [[Sports Illustrated]] in 1965. Parker's crews won the 1967 [[Pan American Games]], and finished second at the 1967 European Championships.  Parker's 1968 crew earned the right to represent the United States at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]]\u2014the last collegiate crew ever to do so.  The Harvard 8 narrowly won the Olympic trials by 5/100th of a second over of a powerful University of Pennsylvania crew \u2013 a race that pitted Parker against his mentor Joe Burk.\n\nIn Mexico, one of Harvard's rowers became ill and had to be replaced.  Harvard made the finals and finished sixth.  Several members of the crew were involved in the political turmoil which swept over the games.<ref>[http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/documents/olyhmeight.asp \"Olympics '68: The Politics of Hypocrisy\"]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050103121537/http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/documents/olyhmeight.asp |date=January 3, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nHarvard was the last non-national team crew to represent the United States in the Olympics in the 8+ man event.  Until 1960, the United States, using a trial system where the best 8 man crew went to the Olympics, had won every gold medal.  But the rest of the world had caught up and was surpassing the USA. In particular, [[Karl Adam, Rowing Coach|Karl Adam]] and his Ratzeburg crews from West Germany had become the team to beat. (Parker was one of the first US coaches to adopt Adam's methods). In 1972, the NAAO, the then governing organization for rowing in the United States, put together a national camp system to help ensure that the best rowers were in the national boat.  Parker was named head coach. With Parker at the helm and with numerous former Harvard oarsmen in the boat, Team USA finished second to New Zealand earning a silver medal in the 8+ at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in Munich.\nIn the 1970s, Parker's Harvard crews continued to be successful.  They did not win the Sprints in the years 1971\u20131973, but the losses were close.  Then came the 1974 and 1975 Harvard varsities which are considered{{By whom|date=January 2012}} to be among the greatest in the history of the sport. They swept the collegiate competition, including dual races each year against the undefeated west coast champions [[University of Washington|Washington]]. Numerous team members went on to row for the national team. Post-season, the 1975 crew went to England to race at the [[Henley Royal Regatta]].  They finished second in the premier event of the regatta, the Grand Challenge Cup, losing to the [[England|British]] national team by two lengths.\n\nParker was also a path-breaking coach: he was the first women's national team coach in 1975. That eight went on to win a silver medal at the World Rowing Championships (the so-called Red Rose Crew).  Parker would go on to coach the USA women's eight (8+) at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in [[Montreal]] where they earned a Bronze medal.\n\nParker's crews continued to be formidable in the mid and late 1970s, winning the Eastern Sprints in 1975, 1976, 1977 and 1980.  But Yale was on the rise; it won the Eastern Sprints in 1978 and 1979 and beat Harvard in doing so.  Still, Harvard continued to win the Harvard-Yale race. Parker ran his streak to 18 years.  Finally, in 1981, Yale ended the streak and would go on to win the next three races.\n[[File:Harvard Rowing Crew at Henley 2004 -2.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Harvard men's eight at Henley, 2004]]\n\nIn 1983, Harvard won the Eastern Sprints, and in one of the best collegiate races ever,{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} snatched the inaugural [[National Collegiate Rowing Championship]] by coming from a length down with 500 meters to go and catching a super-fast [[University of Washington|Washington]] boat at the line. Parker's 1985 Harvard varsity \u2013 after some early-season losses \u2013 won the Eastern Sprints, the National Collegiate Rowing Championship and the Grand Challenge Cup at the [[Henley Royal Regatta]].\n\nThrough the late 1980s and early 1990s, Harvard continued to be a dominating presence in rowing.  Parker's crews won the national championship in 1983, 1985, 1987, 1988, 1989  and 1992, and they were Eastern Sprints champions in 1988, 1989, and 1990.\n\nThe national championship race was disbanded in 1996, following which the [[Intercollegiate Rowing Association]] Championship, also known as the IRA, became the ''de facto'' national championship. Harvard had never gone to the IRAs during Parker's tenure, but in 2003, after a decade of good showings but no championships, Parker's varsity won the Eastern Sprints and decided to go to the IRA, which they also won.  They continued the streak by winning both the Eastern Sprints and the IRAs in 2004 and 2005.\n\nThe 2004 crew may have been Harvard's fastest crew ever. National team crews are older and more experienced than college oarsmen, and are far better prepared than when Harvard raced in the 1968 Summer Olympics.  Following the 2004 season, the Harvard varsity went to Europe, where it rowed in the World Cup in [[Lucerne]] which was a tune-up for most of the national teams competing in the Olympics. In an upset,{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Harvard made the finals at Lucerne by defeating the [[Great Britain|British]] and [[France|French]] Olympic squads. Harvard lost to the five national teams in the finals at Lucerne, which included four of the top six finishers at the [[2004 Summer Olympics|Olympic games]]\u2014but they were competitive for the length of the course. Harvard then competed in the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley, losing in the finals to the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Olympic 8+, which was also an Olympic finalist.\n\nHarry coached many entrances in the Henley Royal Regatta. His last attendance of the regatta, in 2012, saw his Varsity win by a foot over Leander in the Ladies' Plate. In 2013, two weeks after Harry's death, four members of his final varsity, coached by Bill Manning, broke the record in the Visitor's Challenge Cup.\n\nParker has nine official (or quasi-official) national championships, which is the second most among active coaches. Parker's crews from the 1960s and 1970s won several unofficial titles.\n\nHe completed 51 seasons at the helm, having confirmed his place as the most significant American coach of the latter half of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hewitt |first=Ed |title=Harry Parker has passed; a remembrance, 1935\u20132013 |url=http://www.row2k.com/features/744/Harry-Parker-has-passed--a-remembrance--1935-2013/#.UcyjzuD-hdZ |publisher=Row2k |accessdate=June 27, 2013 |date=June 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Harry Parker Boathouse ==\nOn September 10, 2008, [[Community Rowing, Inc.]] announced that it would name its new boathouse after Harry Parker.

Techniques such as [[Screen scraping]] and [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] reduced rekeying. Mainframe products such as [[FOCUS]] were ported to the PC, and [[Business Intelligence]] (BI) software became more widespread.\n\nCompanies large enough to have mainframes and use BI, having departments with analysts and other specialists, have people doing this work full-time.  Selfsourcing, in such situations,<ref name=MLO.self/> is taking people away from their main job (such as designing ads, creating surveys, planning advertising campaigns); pairs of people, one from an analysis group and another from a \"user\" group, is the way the company wants to operate.

Software was for do-it-yourself/selfsourcing, including [[spreadsheet]]s, programs written in [[DOS-BASIC]] or, somewhat later, [[dBASE]]. Use of spreadsheets, the most popular End-user development tool,<ref name=EUD.BurnScaf/><ref>{{cite web\n   |url=http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2009/08/empowering-users-to-create-their-own-software.php\n   |title=Empowering Users to Create Their Own Software\n   |first=Peter |last=Hornsby |date=August 3, 2009}}</ref> was estimated in 2005 to done by 13 million American employees.<ref name=EUD.BurnScaf/>\n\nSome data became [[information silo|siloed]]<ref>{{cite web\n  |title=data silo Definition from PC Magazine Encyclopedia\n  |url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/57734/data-silo}}</ref> Once [[terminal emulation]] arrived, more data was available, and it was more current.  Techniques such as [[Screen scraping]] and [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] reduced rekeying. Mainframe products such as [[FOCUS]] were ported to the PC, and [[Business Intelligence]] (BI) software became more widespread.\n\nCompanies large enough to have mainframes and use BI, having departments with analysts and other specialists, have people doing this work full-time.  Selfsourcing, in such situations,<ref name=MLO.self/> is taking people away from their main job (such as designing ads, creating surveys, planning advertising campaigns); pairs of people, one from an analysis group and another from a \"user\" group, is the way the company wants to operate.  Selfsourcing is not viewed as an improvement.\n\n''Data warehouse'' was an earlier term in this space.<ref>{{cite book\n   |title=Data Management, Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence\n   |url=https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/dama-dmbok-data-management/9781634622479/Chapters-13.xhtml}}</ref>\n\n====Issues====\nIt is crucial for the system's purposes and goals to be aligned with that of the organizational goals.<ref name=OrGoals.Lack>{{cite web\n   |url=https://www.slideshare.net/sanmitrbhatkar/end-user-development-73573444\n   |quote=Inadequate expertise leads to underdeveloped systems ...
