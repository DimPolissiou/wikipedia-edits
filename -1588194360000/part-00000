Trucks vary greatly in size, power, and configuration; smaller varieties may be mechanically similar to some [[automobile]]s. Commercial trucks can be very large and powerful and may be configured to be mounted with specialized equipment, such as in the case of [[refuse truck]]s, [[fire truck]]s, [[concrete mixer]]s, and [[suction excavator]]s. In American English, a commercial vehicle without a trailer or other articulation is formally a \"straight truck\" while one designed specifically to pull a trailer is not a truck but a \"tractor\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.trucking.org/ATA%20Docs/What%20We%20Do/Image%20and%20Outreach%20Programs/STR/Trucking%20Glossary.pdf |title=Glossary |website=www.trucking.org |format=PDF |access-date=12 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191129105447/https://www.trucking.org/ATA%20Docs/What%20We%20Do/Image%20and%20Outreach%20Programs/STR/Trucking%20Glossary.pdf |archive-date=29 November 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nModern trucks are largely powered by [[diesel engine]]s, although small to medium size trucks with [[gasoline engine]]s exist in the US, Canada, and Mexico. In the European Union, vehicles with a [[gross combination mass]] of up to {{convert|3.5|t|lbs|-2|abbr=on}} are known as [[light commercial vehicle]]s, and those over as [[large goods vehicle]]s.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Steam wagons===\n{{Main|Steam wagon}}\nTrucks and cars have a common ancestor: the steam-powered ''fardier'' [[Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot]] built in 1769.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} However, [[steam wagon]]s were not common until the mid-19th century. The roads of the time, built for horse and carriages, limited these vehicles to very short hauls, usually from a factory to the nearest railway station. The first [[Semi-trailer truck|semi-trailer]] appeared in 1881,{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} towed by a [[steam tractor]] manufactured by [[De Dion-Bouton]]. Steam-powered wagons were sold in France and the United States until the eve of [[World War I]], and 1935 in the United Kingdom, when a change in road tax rules made them uneconomic against the new diesel lorries.\n\n===Internal combustion===\n[[File:DMG-Lastwagen von 1896.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Daimler Motor-Lastwagen from 1898]]\nIn 1895 [[Karl Benz]] designed and built the first truck in history using the [[internal combustion]] engine. Later that year some of Benz's trucks were modified to become the first bus by the ''Netphener'', the first motorbus company in history. A year later, in 1896, another internal combustion engine truck was built by [[Gottlieb Daimler]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Truck History|url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/bltruck.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=6 September 2008}}</ref> Other companies, such as [[Peugeot]], [[Renault]] and [[B\u00fcssing]], also built their own versions. The first truck in the United States was built by [[Autocar Company|Autocar]] in 1899 and was available with optional 5 or 8 horsepower motors.<ref>{{cite web|title=Autocar, Always up, Our History|url=http://www.autocartruck.com/history|publisher=Autocar, LLC|accessdate=21 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nTrucks of the era mostly used [[Straight engine|two-cylinder]] engines and had a carrying capacity of {{convert|1.5|to|2|t|lbs|-2|order=flip|abbr=on}}. In 1904, 700 heavy trucks were built in the United States, 1000 in 1907, 6000 in 1910, and 25000 in 1914.\n\nAfter World War I, several advances were made: pneumatic [[tire]]s replaced the previously common full rubber versions. [[Starter motor|electric starters]], power [[brake]]s, 4, 6, and 8 cylinder engines, closed [[#Cabs|cabs]], and electric lighting followed. The first modern semi-trailer trucks also appeared. Touring car builders such as [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and Renault entered the heavy truck market.\n\n===Diesel engines===\nAlthough it had been invented in 1897, the [[diesel engine]] did not appear in production trucks until Benz introduced it in 1923.<ref>{{cite web |title=Debut of diesel engines in tractors and trucks |url=https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Debut-of-diesel-engines-in-tractors-and-trucks.xhtml?oid=9361501 |publisher=Daimler AG |accessdate=27 September 2018}}</ref>\nThe diesel engine was not common in trucks in Europe until the 1930s. In the United States, Autocar introduced diesel engines for heavy applications in the mid-1930s. Demand was high enough that Autocar launched the \"DC\" model (diesel conventional) in 1939. However, it took much longer for diesel engines to be broadly accepted in the US: gasoline engines were still in use on heavy trucks in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Peter J.|title=The World Encyclopedia of Trucks|year=2000|publisher=Lorenz Books|isbn=0-7548-0518-2|pp=20\u201321, 114, 118, 160, 204|ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Motor's Truck and Diesel Repair Manual|edition=26|year=1973|publisher=Motor|isbn=0-910992-16-9|pages=530, 1035}}</ref>\n\n===Etymology===\n{{original research section|date=February 2020}}\n''Truck'' is used in [[American English]], and is common in [[Canadian English|Canada]], [[Australian English|Australia]], [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]], [[Pakistani English|Pakistan]] and [[South African English|South Africa]], while  ''lorry'' is the equivalent in [[British English]], and is the usual term in countries like [[Hiberno-English|Ireland]], [[Malaysian English|Malaysia]], [[Singaporean English|Singapore]] and [[Indian English|India]].{{Original research inline|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe first known usage of \"truck\" was in 1611, when it referred to the small strong wheels on ships' cannon carriages. In its extended usage it came to refer to carts for carrying heavy loads, a meaning known since 1771. Its expanded application to \"motor-powered load carrier\" has been in usage since 1930, shortened from \"motor truck\", which dates back to 1901.<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/truck?show=2&t=1284721768 \"Truck\"] Merriam-Webster Dictionary</ref><ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=truck&searchmode=none \"Truck\"] ''Online Etymology Dictionary'' 16 September 2010</ref>\n\n\"Lorry\" has a more uncertain origin, but probably has its roots in the [[rail transport]] industry, where the word is known to have been used in 1838 to refer to a type of truck (a [[Railroad car|goods wagon]] as in British usage, not a [[bogie]] as in the American), specifically a large flat wagon. It might derive from the verb ''lurry'' (to carry or drag along; or to lug) which was in use as early as 1664, but that association is not definitive.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oed.com//view/Entry/111334|title=lurry, v.|last=|first=|date=September 2019|website=Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|access-date=1 December 2019}}</ref>  The expanded meaning of ''lorry'', \"self-propelled vehicle for carrying goods\", has been in usage since 1911.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=lorry&searchmode=none \"Lorry\"] ''Online Etymology Dictionary'' 16 September 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lorry \"Lorry\"] Merriam-Webster Dictionary</ref>\n\n===International variance===\n{{Details|List of truck types}}\nIn the United States, Canada, and the Philippines \"truck\" is usually reserved for commercial vehicles larger than normal cars, and includes pickups and other vehicles having an open load bed. In Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the word \"truck\" is mostly reserved for larger vehicles; in Australia and New Zealand, a pickup truck is usually called a [[ute (vehicle)|''ute'']] (short for \"utility\"),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/onairhighlights/the-first-ute|title=The First Ute|publisher=ABC \u2013 Radio Australia|accessdate=15 June 2012}}</ref> while in South Africa it is called a ''bakkie'' ([[Afrikaans]]: \"small open container\"). In the United Kingdom, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Ireland, and [[Hong Kong]] ''lorry'' is used instead of ''truck'', but only for the medium and heavy types, while ''truck'' is used almost exclusively to refer to [[pickup truck|pickup]]s.\n\n==Types by size==\n{{see also|Truck classification|List of truck types}}\n\n===Ultra light===\n[[File:Might-E Truck.jpg|thumb|[[Might-E Truck]] from [[Canadian Electric Vehicles]]]]\nOften produced as variations of [[golf car]]s, with internal combustion or [[battery electric vehicle|battery electric drive]], these are used typically for off-highway use on estates, golf courses, and parks. While not suitable for highway use some variations may be licensed as slow speed vehicles for operation on streets, generally as a body variation of a [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]. A few manufactures produce specialized chassis for this type of vehicle, while [[Zap Motors]] markets a version of their xebra electric tricycle (licensable in the U.S. as a motorcycle).\n\n===Very light===\n[[Image:PiaggioTruckMikinos06473.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Piaggio Porter]]]]\n[[Image:Ashok Leyland Dost (1).JPG|thumb|[[Ashok Leyland]] Dost in Tamil Nadu in India]]\nPopular in Europe and Asia, many mini trucks are factory redesigns of light automobiles, usually with [[monocoque]] bodies. Specialized designs with substantial frames such as the Italian Piaggio shown here are based upon Japanese designs (in this case by [[Daihatsu]]) and are popular for use in \"old town\" sections of European cities that often have very narrow alleyways.\n\nRegardless of name, these small trucks serve a wide range of uses. In Japan, they are regulated under the [[Kei car]] laws, which allow vehicle owners a break in taxes for buying a smaller and less-powerful vehicle (currently, the engine is limited to 660 cc displacement). These vehicles are used as on-road utility vehicles in Japan. These Japanese-made mini trucks that were manufactured for on-road use are competing with off-road ATVs in the United States, and import regulations require that these mini trucks have a {{convert|25|mph|abbr=on}} speed governor as they are classified as low speed vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrruletext.asp?rule_toc=777&section=571.3&section_toc=2060|title=49CFR571|accessdate=31 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922163045/http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrruletext.asp?rule_toc=777&section=571.3&section_toc=2060|archive-date=22 September 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> These vehicles have found uses in construction, large campuses (government, university, and industrial), agriculture, cattle ranches, amusement parks, and replacements for golf carts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.best-used-tractors.com/contact/|title=\u304a\u554f\u3044\u5408\u308f\u305b}}</ref>\n\n'''Major mini truck manufacturers and their brands:'''\n* [[Daihatsu Hijet]]\n* [[Honda Acty]]\n* [[Tata Ace]]\n* [[Mazda Scrum]]\n* [[Mitsubishi Minicab]]\n* [[Subaru Sambar]]\n* [[Suzuki Carry]]\n{{clear}}\n\n===Light===\n[[File:Dongfeng Rich II China 2016-04-07.jpg|thumb|Dongfeng pickup]]\nLight trucks are car-sized (in the US, no more than {{convert|6.3|t|lbs|-2|order=flip|abbr=on}}) and are used by individuals and businesses alike.

A \"sleeper\" is a compartment attached to or integral with the cab where the driver can rest while not driving, sometimes seen in semi-trailer trucks.\n\nThere are several possible cab configurations:\n* \"[[Cab over]] engine\" (COE) or \"flat nose\"; where the driver is seated above the front axle and the [[internal combustion engine|engine]]. This design is almost ubiquitous in Europe, where overall truck lengths are strictly regulated, but widely used in the rest of the world as well. They were common in North American heavy-duty trucks, but lost prominence when permitted length was extended in the early 1980s. Nevertheless, this design is still popular in North America among medium- and light-duty trucks. To reach the engine, the whole cab tilts forward, earning this design the name of \"tilt-cab\". This type of cab is especially suited to the delivery conditions in Europe where many roads follow the layout of much more ancient paths and trackways which require the additional turning capability given by the short wheelbase of the cab over engine type.{{sfnp|Davies|2000|pp=58\u201361}} The COE design was invented by [[Viktor Schreckengost]].<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/28/AR2008012802613.html | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | title=Viktor Schreckengost; Designed Bicycles, Dinnerware and More | first=Adam | last=Bernstein | date=29 January 2008 | accessdate=26 May 2010}}</ref>\n* \"Conventional\" cabs are the most common in North America and Australia, and are known in the UK as \"American cabs\" and in the Netherlands as \"torpedo cabs\". The driver is seated behind the engine, as in most passenger cars or pickup trucks. Many new cabs are very [[m:wikt:streamline|streamlined]], with a sloped hood and other features to lower drag.\n* \"Cab beside engine\" designs also exist, but are rather rare and are mainly used inside [[shipyard|shipping yard]]s, or other specialist uses that require the vehicle to carry long loads such as pipes, metal rods, flat iron and other construction materials. This type is often custom made from a regular cabover truck that gets the upper half of its cab removed on the passenger side and replaced by an extended section of the bed.\nA further step from this is the side loading [[forklift]] that can be described as a specially fabricated vehicle with the same properties as a truck of this type, in addition to the ability to pick up its own load.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Engines and motors===\n[[File:Cummins Engine (LKW).jpg|thumb|[[Cummins B Series engine#B6.7|Cummins ISB]] 6.7L medium duty truck diesel engine]]\nMost small trucks such as [[sport utility vehicle]]s (SUVs) or [[pickup truck|pickups]], and even light medium-duty trucks in North America, China, and Russia use [[gasoline engine]]s (petrol engines), but many [[diesel engine]]d models are now being produced. Most of the heavier trucks use [[four stroke cycle|four-stroke]] diesel engines with a [[turbocharger]] and [[intercooler]]. Huge off-highway trucks use locomotive-type engines such as a [[V12 engine|V12]] [[Detroit Diesel]] [[two stroke cycle|two stroke]] engine.

Bigger trucks often use manual transmissions without synchronizers, saving bulk and weight, although synchromesh transmissions are used in larger trucks as well. Transmissions without synchronizers, known as \"crash boxes\", require [[double-clutching]] for each shift, (which can lead to repetitive motion injuries), or a technique known colloquially as \"floating\", a method of changing gears which doesn't use the clutch, except for starts and stops, due to the physical effort of double clutching, especially with non-power-assisted clutches, faster shifts, and less clutch wear.\n\nDouble-clutching allows the driver to control the engine and transmission revolutions to synchronize, so that a smooth shift can be made; for example, when upshifting, the accelerator pedal is released and the clutch pedal is depressed while the gear lever is moved into neutral, the clutch pedal is then released and quickly pushed down again while the gear lever is moved to the next higher gear. Finally, the clutch pedal is released and the accelerator pedal pushed down to obtain required engine speed. Although this is a relatively fast movement, perhaps a second or so while transmission is in neutral, it allows the engine speed to drop and synchronize engine and transmission revolutions relative to the road speed. Downshifting is performed in a similar fashion, except the engine speed is now required to increase (while transmission is in neutral) just the right amount in order to achieve the synchronization for a smooth, non-collision gear change. \"Skip changing\" is also widely used; in principle operation is the same as double-clutching, but it requires neutral be held slightly longer than a single-gear change.\n\nCommon North American setups include 9, 10, 13, 15, and 18&nbsp;speeds. [[automatic transmission|Automatic]] and [[semi-automatic transmission]]s for heavy trucks are becoming more and more common, due to advances both in transmission and engine power. In Europe, 8, 10, 12 and 16&nbsp;gears are common on larger trucks with manual transmission, while automatic or semi-automatic transmissions would have anything from 5 to 12 gears. Almost all heavy truck transmissions are of the \"range and split\" (double H shift pattern) type, where range change and so\u2011called half gears or splits are air operated and always preselected before the main gear selection.\n\n===Frame===\n[[File:A truck chassis section.jpg|thumb|A truck rear frame (chassis) section view]]\n[[File:ToyotaTundraChassis.jpg|thumb|Pickup truck frame (right rear view)]]\nA truck [[frame (vehicle)|frame]] consists of two parallel boxed (tubular) or C\u2011shaped rails, or beams, held together by [[crossmember]]s. These frames are referred to as [[ladder frame]]s due to their resemblance to a ladder if tipped on end. The rails consist of a tall vertical section (two if boxed) and two shorter horizontal flanges. The height of the vertical section provides opposition to vertical flex when weight is applied to the top of the frame (beam resistance). Though typically flat the whole length on heavy duty trucks, the rails may sometimes be tapered or arched for clearance around the engine or over the axles. The holes in rails are used either for mounting vehicle components and running wires and hoses, or measuring and adjusting the orientation of the rails at the factory or repair shop.\n\nThe frame is usually made of [[steel]], but can be made (whole or in part) of [[aluminum]] for a lighter weight. A [[Drawbar (haulage)|tow bar]] may be found attached at one or both ends, but heavy tractors almost always make use of a [[fifth wheel]] hitch.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}<!-- One out of five heavy trucks (16 tonnes and above) in Sweden are tractors. http://www.vbg.se/sv/support/lfg_statistik/30.-Lastbilar_over_16_ton_1988-.pdf Virtually all other heavy trucks, the majority of the heavy trucks, have a bolt couplings (such as a [[Ringfeder]]). -->\n\n===Body types===\n'''[[Refrigerator truck]]s''' have insulated panels as walls and a roof and floor, used for transporting fresh and frozen cargo such as ice cream, food, vegetables, and prescription drugs.

Less frequent noises, but perhaps more noticeable, are things like the repeated sharp-pitched whistle of a [[turbocharger]] on acceleration, or the abrupt blare of an [[exhaust brake]] [[retarder (mechanical engineering)|retarder]] when traversing a downgrade. There has been [[noise regulation]] put in place to help control where and when the use of [[engine braking]] retarders are allowed.\n\nConcerns have been raised about the effect of trucking on the environment, particularly as part of the debate on [[global warming]], so many countries are lowering limits on truck CO2 emissions.<ref>{{cite news |title=EU countries agree to 30 percent cut in truck CO2 emissions |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-autos-emissions/eu-countries-agree-to-30-percent-cut-in-truck-co2-emissions-idUSKCN1OJ1ZC |agency=Reuters |date=20 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a 1995 U.S.&nbsp;government estimate, the energy cost of carrying one [[ton]] of freight a distance of one kilometer averages 337&nbsp;kJ for water, 221&nbsp;kJ for rail, 2,000&nbsp;kJ for trucks, and nearly 13,000&nbsp;kJ for air transport.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Domestic Freight Transportation|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/efficiency/ee_ch5.htm|publisher=[[United States Department of Energy]]|accessdate=6 September 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922145824/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/efficiency/ee_ch5.htm|archivedate=22 September 2008}}</ref> Many environmental organizations favor laws and incentives to encourage the switch from road to rail, especially in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|title=How Government policy can realize rail freight's role in reducing carbon emissions|url=http://www.freightonrail.org.uk/ConsultationsEnvironmentalAuditCommittee.htm|publisher=FreightOnRail.org.uk|accessdate=6 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe [[European Parliament]] is moving to ensure that charges on heavy-goods vehicles should be based in part on the air and noise pollution they produce and the congestion they cause, according to legislation approved by the Transport Committee.<ref>[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/062-48814-040-02-07-910-20090209IPR48793-09-02-2009-2009-false/default_en.htm MEPs push for green tolls] Last retrieved 11-02-09</ref> The [[Eurovignette]] scheme has been proposed, whereby new charges would be potentially levied against things such as noise and air pollution and also weight related damages from the lorries themselves.<ref>[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/public/story_page/062-48727-040-02-07-910-20090205STO48540-2009-09-02-2009/default_en.htm European Parliament discuss Eurovignette scheme] Last retrieved 10-02-09</ref>\n\nA 60-ton tractor & trailer at 80&nbsp;km/h needs 168&nbsp;kW : 41% (68&nbsp;kW) to overcome the [[rolling resistance]], 38% (64&nbsp;kW) for the [[aerodynamic drag]],  9% (15&nbsp;kW) for the auxiliaries, 7% (12&nbsp;kW) for the [[driveline]] & [[tire]] and 6% (10&nbsp;kW) is lost in uphill/downhill [[hysteresis]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.iea.org/media/workshops/2013/egrdmobility/Nylund_Vehicle_energy_efficiencies.pdf |title= Vehicle energy efficiencies |author= Nils-Olof Nylund |publisher= VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland |date= 2013 |access-date= 1 October 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180818064927/http://www.iea.org/media/workshops/2013/egrdmobility/nylund_vehicle_energy_efficiencies.pdf |archive-date= 18 August 2018 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n\n== Operator health and safety ==\n[[File:Truck cab filters.png|alt=An orange metal housing with an open panel containing three horizontal stacked filters|thumb|Truck cab filter housing using a contiguous series of pre-, HEPA, and charcoal panel filters]]\nA truck cab is a [[Hierarchy of hazard controls|hazard control]] that protects the truck operator from hazardous airborne pollutants.

Rules on use taxes differ among jurisdictions.\n\n===Damage to pavement===\nThe life of a pavement is measured by the number of passes of a vehicle axle. It may be evaluated using the Load Equivalency Factor,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nvfnorden.org/lisalib/getfile.aspx?itemid=261|title=Road wear from heavy vehicles \u2013 an overview|publisher=NVF committee Vehicles and Transports|date=August 2008|accessdate=27 September 2016|format=PDF}}</ref> which states that the damage by the pass of a vehicle axle is proportional to the 4th power of the weight, so a ten-ton axle consumes 10,000 times the life of the pavement as a one-ton axle. For that reason, loaded trucks cost the same as thousands of cars in pavement costs, and are subject to higher taxes and highway tolls.<ref name=\"Chatti\"/><ref name=\"FHA\"/>\n\n===Commercial insurance===\nPrimary liability insurance coverage protects the truck from damage or injuries to other people as a result of a truck accident. This truck insurance coverage is mandated by U.S.&nbsp;state and federal agencies, and proof of coverage is required to be sent to them. Interstate trucks in the U.S. are required to have a minimum of $75,000 in liability insurance. This includes motor carriers operating vehicles with a gross weight rating in excess of {{convert|10000|lb|t|1|abbr=on}} (which transport non-hazardous materials). All motor carriers operating vehicles transporting materials classified as hazardous, and which have a gross weight rating in excess of {{convert|10000|lb|t|1|abbr=on}} must have a minimum of $1,000,000 in liability insurance. All motor carriers operating vehicles such as hopper-type cargo vehicles or tankers with a capacity in excess of {{convert|3500|usgal|l|abbr=on}} must have a minimum of $5,000,000 in liability insurance. Pricing is dependent on region, driving records, and history of the trucking operation.\n\nMotor truck cargo insurance protects the transporter for his responsibility in the event of damaged or lost freight. The policy is purchased with a maximum load limit per vehicle. Cargo insurance coverage limits can range from $10,000 to $100,000 or more. Pricing for this insurance is mainly dependent on the type of cargo being hauled.\n\n===Trucking accidents===\n[[File:Elst (Overbetuwe) 2012-03-23 Trucking accident (1).JPG|thumb|Trucking accident at [[Elst, Overbetuwe|Elst (Netherlands)]] 2012-03-23]]\nIn 2002 and 2004, there were over 5,000 fatalities related to trucking accidents in the United States. The trucking industry has since made significant efforts in increasing safety regulations. In 2008 the industry had successfully lowered the fatality rate to just over 4,000 deaths. But trucking accidents are still an issue that causes thousands of deaths and injuries each year. Approximately 6,000 trucking accident fatalities occur annually in the United States. Fatalities are not the only issue caused by trucking accidents. Here are some of the environmental issues that arise with trucking accidents:\n* 14.4% of trucking accidents cause cargo to spill\n* 6.5% cause open flames\n\nFollowing increased pressure from ''The Times'' \"Cities Fit For Cycling\" campaign and from other media in Spring 2012, warning signs are now displayed on the backs of many [[Large goods vehicle|HGVs]]. These signs are directed against a common type of accident which occurs when the large vehicle turns left at a junction: a cyclist trying to pass on the nearside can be crushed against the HGV's wheels, especially if the driver cannot see the [[cyclist]]. The signs, such as the winning design of the [http://www.intandemcompetition.com InTANDEM road safety competition] launched in March 2012, advocate extra care when passing a large vehicle on the nearside.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Transport|Cars}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Animal transporter]]\n* [[Articulated hauler]]\n* [[Driverless truck|Autonomous truck]]\n* [[Ballast tractor]]\n* [[Campervan]]\n* [[Cutaway van chassis]]\n* [[Dekotora]], Japanese decorated trucks\n* [[Food truck]]\n* [[Glossary of the American trucking industry]]\n* [[Great West Truck Show]]\n* [[Hand truck]]\n* [[Haul truck]]\n* [[Kei truck]]\n* [[List of military trucks]]\n* [[List of pickup trucks]]\n* [[List of trucks]]\n* [[Logging truck]]\n* [[Multi-stop truck]]\n* [[Roll-off (dumpster)|Roll-off truck]]\n* [[Tail lift]]\n* [[Traffic congestion]]\n* [[Truck art in South Asia]]\n* [[Truck classification]]\n* [[Truck hijacking]]\n* [[Truck scale]]\n* [[Truck stop]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=upper-alpha}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons}}\n* {{Britannica|606963|Truck (vehicle)}}\n* {{curlie|Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Trucking/}}\n* [http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/ Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration]\n* [http://www.returnloads.net/Industry-Info/General/Haulage-Courier-vehicle-types-and-weights Different sizes and classes of trucks in the UK]\n* {{Cite journal|last=Hutchinson |first=Rollin W., Jr.|date=January 1912|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv--PfedzLAC&pg=PA268|title=Motor Trucks \u2013 The New Freighters: Quicker and More Reliable Service, Cleaner and Less Congested Cities, Concrete Examples of Saving|journal=[[World's Work|The World's Work: A History of Our Time]]|volume=XXIII|pages=268\u2013187|accessdate=10 July 2009}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Trucks| ]]\n[[Category:Carriages and mountings]]\n[[Category:Vehicles introduced in 1896]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Freight motor vehicle}}\n{{Redirect|Trucks|other uses|Truck (disambiguation)}}\n{{Redirect|Lorry}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n[[File:Freightliner_M2_106_6x4_2014_(14240376744).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Freightliner Trucks|Freightliner]] M2 dump truck]]\n[[File:Road train-cropped.jpg|thumb|A [[Mack Titan]] [[road train]] in Australia|upright=1.3]]\n[[Image:Liebherr T282.jpg|thumb|[[Liebherr T 282B]] mining truck]]\n[[File:SNVI_truck_TC260.jpg|thumb|[[SNVI]] made in Algeria]]\n\nA '''truck''' or '''lorry''' is a [[motor vehicle]] designed to transport [[cargo]].

The first [[Semi-trailer truck|semi-trailer]] appeared in 1881,{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} towed by a [[steam tractor]] manufactured by [[De Dion-Bouton]].

[[Pneumatic]], [[hydraulic]], [[Engine cooling|water]], and [[electrical]] systems may also be present. Many also tow one or more [[trailer (vehicle)|trailers]] or semi-trailers.\n\n===Cab===\n[[File:Scania R470 topline.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Scania R-series|Scania R&nbsp;470]] flat nose truck]][[File:Kenworth_T2000,_Kenworth_Dealer_Hall_of_Fame,_2015.JPG|thumb|Streamlined conventional cab]]\n[[File:Kuwaiti BM-30 Smerch.jpg|thumb|upright|Cab beside engine]]\n\nThe \"cab\" is an enclosed space where the driver is seated. A \"sleeper\" is a compartment attached to or integral with the cab where the driver can rest while not driving, sometimes seen in semi-trailer trucks.\n\nThere are several possible cab configurations:\n* \"[[Cab over]] engine\" (COE) or \"flat nose\"; where the driver is seated above the front axle and the [[internal combustion engine|engine]]. This design is almost ubiquitous in Europe, where overall truck lengths are strictly regulated, but widely used in the rest of the world as well. They were common in North American heavy-duty trucks, but lost prominence when permitted length was extended in the early 1980s. Nevertheless, this design is still popular in North America among medium- and light-duty trucks. To reach the engine, the whole cab tilts forward, earning this design the name of \"tilt-cab\". This type of cab is especially suited to the delivery conditions in Europe where many roads follow the layout of much more ancient paths and trackways which require the additional turning capability given by the short wheelbase of the cab over engine type.{{sfnp|Davies|2000|pp=58\u201361}} The COE design was invented by [[Viktor Schreckengost]].<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/28/AR2008012802613.html | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | title=Viktor Schreckengost; Designed Bicycles, Dinnerware and More | first=Adam | last=Bernstein | date=29 January 2008 | accessdate=26 May 2010}}</ref>\n* \"Conventional\" cabs are the most common in North America and Australia, and are known in the UK as \"American cabs\" and in the Netherlands as \"torpedo cabs\". The driver is seated behind the engine, as in most passenger cars or pickup trucks. Many new cabs are very [[m:wikt:streamline|streamlined]], with a sloped hood and other features to lower drag.\n* \"Cab beside engine\" designs also exist, but are rather rare and are mainly used inside [[shipyard|shipping yard]]s, or other specialist uses that require the vehicle to carry long loads such as pipes, metal rods, flat iron and other construction materials. This type is often custom made from a regular cabover truck that gets the upper half of its cab removed on the passenger side and replaced by an extended section of the bed.\nA further step from this is the side loading [[forklift]] that can be described as a specially fabricated vehicle with the same properties as a truck of this type, in addition to the ability to pick up its own load.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Engines and motors===\n[[File:Cummins Engine (LKW).jpg|thumb|[[Cummins B Series engine#B6.7|Cummins ISB]] 6.7L medium duty truck diesel engine]]\nMost small trucks such as [[sport utility vehicle]]s (SUVs) or [[pickup truck|pickups]], and even light medium-duty trucks in North America, China, and Russia use [[gasoline engine]]s (petrol engines), but many [[diesel engine]]d models are now being produced. Most of the heavier trucks use [[four stroke cycle|four-stroke]] diesel engines with a [[turbocharger]] and [[intercooler]]. Huge off-highway trucks use locomotive-type engines such as a [[V12 engine|V12]] [[Detroit Diesel]] [[two stroke cycle|two stroke]] engine. Diesel engines are becoming the engine of choice for trucks ranging from class&nbsp;3 to 8 GVWs.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} A large proportion of refuse trucks in the United States employ [[CNG]] (compressed natural gas) engines for their low fuel cost and reduced carbon emissions.\n\nA significant proportion of North American manufactured trucks use an engine built by the last remaining major independent engine manufacturer ([[Cummins]]) but most global OEMs such as [[Volvo Trucks]] and [[Daimler AG]] promote their own \"captive\" engines.<ref>{{cite book|title=Operators Handbook-DM, DMM, U Series|year=1988|publisher=[[Mack Trucks]]|pages=62\u201364}}</ref>\n\nIn the European Union, all new truck engines must comply with [[European emission standards|Euro&nbsp;VI]] emission regulations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dieselnet.com/standards/eu/hd.php|title=EU: Heavy-Duty Truck and Bus Engines|date=November 2016|website=DieselNet|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2019}} several alternative technologies are competing to displace the use of diesel engines in heavy trucks. CNG engines are widely used in the US refuse industry and in concrete mixers, among other short-range vocations, but range limitations have prevented their broader uptake in freight hauling applications. Heavy [[electric truck]]s and [[Hydrogen vehicle#Heavy trucks|hydrogen-powered trucks]] are still in the prototype and field-testing stages, although media reports indicate that there is substantial interest in them from major freight haulers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Want a Nikola hydrogen-electric truck?

Bigger trucks often use manual transmissions without synchronizers, saving bulk and weight, although synchromesh transmissions are used in larger trucks as well. Transmissions without synchronizers, known as \"crash boxes\", require [[double-clutching]] for each shift, (which can lead to repetitive motion injuries), or a technique known colloquially as \"floating\", a method of changing gears which doesn't use the clutch, except for starts and stops, due to the physical effort of double clutching, especially with non-power-assisted clutches, faster shifts, and less clutch wear.\n\nDouble-clutching allows the driver to control the engine and transmission revolutions to synchronize, so that a smooth shift can be made; for example, when upshifting, the accelerator pedal is released and the clutch pedal is depressed while the gear lever is moved into neutral, the clutch pedal is then released and quickly pushed down again while the gear lever is moved to the next higher gear. Finally, the clutch pedal is released and the accelerator pedal pushed down to obtain required engine speed. Although this is a relatively fast movement, perhaps a second or so while transmission is in neutral, it allows the engine speed to drop and synchronize engine and transmission revolutions relative to the road speed. Downshifting is performed in a similar fashion, except the engine speed is now required to increase (while transmission is in neutral) just the right amount in order to achieve the synchronization for a smooth, non-collision gear change. \"Skip changing\" is also widely used; in principle operation is the same as double-clutching, but it requires neutral be held slightly longer than a single-gear change.\n\nCommon North American setups include 9, 10, 13, 15, and 18&nbsp;speeds. [[automatic transmission|Automatic]] and [[semi-automatic transmission]]s for heavy trucks are becoming more and more common, due to advances both in transmission and engine power. In Europe, 8, 10, 12 and 16&nbsp;gears are common on larger trucks with manual transmission, while automatic or semi-automatic transmissions would have anything from 5 to 12 gears. Almost all heavy truck transmissions are of the \"range and split\" (double H shift pattern) type, where range change and so\u2011called half gears or splits are air operated and always preselected before the main gear selection.\n\n===Frame===\n[[File:A truck chassis section.jpg|thumb|A truck rear frame (chassis) section view]]\n[[File:ToyotaTundraChassis.jpg|thumb|Pickup truck frame (right rear view)]]\nA truck [[frame (vehicle)|frame]] consists of two parallel boxed (tubular) or C\u2011shaped rails, or beams, held together by [[crossmember]]s. These frames are referred to as [[ladder frame]]s due to their resemblance to a ladder if tipped on end. The rails consist of a tall vertical section (two if boxed) and two shorter horizontal flanges. The height of the vertical section provides opposition to vertical flex when weight is applied to the top of the frame (beam resistance). Though typically flat the whole length on heavy duty trucks, the rails may sometimes be tapered or arched for clearance around the engine or over the axles. The holes in rails are used either for mounting vehicle components and running wires and hoses, or measuring and adjusting the orientation of the rails at the factory or repair shop.\n\nThe frame is usually made of [[steel]], but can be made (whole or in part) of [[aluminum]] for a lighter weight. A [[Drawbar (haulage)|tow bar]] may be found attached at one or both ends, but heavy tractors almost always make use of a [[fifth wheel]] hitch.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}<!-- One out of five heavy trucks (16 tonnes and above) in Sweden are tractors. http://www.vbg.se/sv/support/lfg_statistik/30.-Lastbilar_over_16_ton_1988-.pdf Virtually all other heavy trucks, the majority of the heavy trucks, have a bolt couplings (such as a [[Ringfeder]]). -->\n\n===Body types===\n'''[[Refrigerator truck]]s''' have insulated panels as walls and a roof and floor, used for transporting fresh and frozen cargo such as ice cream, food, vegetables, and prescription drugs.

The requirements and limitations vary with each different jurisdiction.\n\n===Australia===\n[[File:Inside Mack Granite.JPG|thumb|Inside a Mack truck]]\nIn Australia, a [[truck driver]]'s license is required for any motor vehicle with a [[Gross Vehicle Mass]] (GVM) exceeding {{convert|4.5|t|lbs|abbr=on}}. The motor vehicles classes are further expanded as:\n;Combination\n* '''HC''': Heavy Combination, a typical prime mover plus semi-trailer combination.\n* '''MC''': Multi Combination, e.g.,&nbsp;B&nbsp;Doubles/road trains\n\n; Rigid\n* '''LR''': Light rigid: a rigid vehicle with a GVM of more than {{convert|4.5|t|lbs|-2|abbr=on}} but not more than {{convert|8|t|lbs|-2|abbr=on}}. Any towed trailer must not weigh more than {{convert|9|t|lbs||abbr=on}} GVM.\n* '''MR''': Medium rigid: a rigid vehicle with 2&nbsp;axles and a GVM of more than {{convert|8|t|lbs|-2|abbr=on}}. Any towed trailer must not weigh more than {{convert|9|t|lbs|abbr=on}} GVM. Also includes vehicles in class ''LR''.\n* '''HR''': Heavy Rigid: a rigid vehicle with three or more axles and a GVM of more than {{convert|8|t|lbs|abbr=on}}. Any towed trailer must not weigh more than {{convert|9|t|lbs|abbr=on}} GVM. Also includes articulated buses and vehicles in class&nbsp;''MR''.\n\n;Heavy vehicle transmission\nThere is also a heavy vehicle transmission condition for a license class ''HC'', ''HR'', or ''MC'' test passed in a vehicle fitted with an automatic or synchromesh transmission; a driver's license will be restricted to vehicles of that class fitted with a synchromesh or automatic transmission. To have the condition removed, a person needs to pass a practical driving test in a vehicle with non-synchromesh transmission (constant mesh or crash box).<ref>{{cite web|title=South Australia License class information|url=http://www.sa.gov.au/topics/transport-travel-and-motoring|publisher=Gov't of South Australia|accessdate=28 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:Mercedes-Benz LKW Lenkrad.jpg|thumb|Inside a Mercedes-Benz truck]]\nDriving licensing has been harmonized throughout the European Union (and practically all European non-member states), so that common rules apply within Europe (see [[European driving licence]]). As an overview, to drive a vehicle weighing more than {{convert|7.5|t|lbs|-2|abbr=on}} for commercial purposes requires a specialist license (the type varies depending on the use of the vehicle and number of seats).

This is indicated with the letter \"E\" prefixing the license code.\n\nIn addition, any vehicle designed to carry goods or passengers may only be driven by a driver possessing a Public Driver's Permit, (or PrDP) of the applicable type.  This is an additional license that is added to the DL card of the operator and subject to annual renewal unlike the five-year renewal period of a normal license.\n\nThe requirements for obtaining the different classes are below.\n\n* \"G\": Required for the transport of general goods, requires a criminal record check and a fee on issuing and renewal.\n* \"P\": Required for the transport of paying passengers, requires a more stringent criminal record check on, additionally the driver must be over the age of 21 at time of issue.

Rules on use taxes differ among jurisdictions.\n\n===Damage to pavement===\nThe life of a pavement is measured by the number of passes of a vehicle axle. It may be evaluated using the Load Equivalency Factor,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nvfnorden.org/lisalib/getfile.aspx?itemid=261|title=Road wear from heavy vehicles \u2013 an overview|publisher=NVF committee Vehicles and Transports|date=August 2008|accessdate=27 September 2016|format=PDF}}</ref> which states that the damage by the pass of a vehicle axle is proportional to the 4th power of the weight, so a ten-ton axle consumes 10,000 times the life of the pavement as a one-ton axle. For that reason, loaded trucks cost the same as thousands of cars in pavement costs, and are subject to higher taxes and highway tolls.<ref name=\"Chatti\"/><ref name=\"FHA\"/>\n\n===Commercial insurance===\nPrimary liability insurance coverage protects the truck from damage or injuries to other people as a result of a truck accident. This truck insurance coverage is mandated by U.S.&nbsp;state and federal agencies, and proof of coverage is required to be sent to them. Interstate trucks in the U.S. are required to have a minimum of $75,000 in liability insurance. This includes motor carriers operating vehicles with a gross weight rating in excess of {{convert|10000|lb|t|1|abbr=on}} (which transport non-hazardous materials). All motor carriers operating vehicles transporting materials classified as hazardous, and which have a gross weight rating in excess of {{convert|10000|lb|t|1|abbr=on}} must have a minimum of $1,000,000 in liability insurance. All motor carriers operating vehicles such as hopper-type cargo vehicles or tankers with a capacity in excess of {{convert|3500|usgal|l|abbr=on}} must have a minimum of $5,000,000 in liability insurance. Pricing is dependent on region, driving records, and history of the trucking operation.\n\nMotor truck cargo insurance protects the transporter for his responsibility in the event of damaged or lost freight. The policy is purchased with a maximum load limit per vehicle. Cargo insurance coverage limits can range from $10,000 to $100,000 or more. Pricing for this insurance is mainly dependent on the type of cargo being hauled.\n\n===Trucking accidents===\n[[File:Elst (Overbetuwe) 2012-03-23 Trucking accident (1).JPG|thumb|Trucking accident at [[Elst, Overbetuwe|Elst (Netherlands)]] 2012-03-23]]\nIn 2002 and 2004, there were over 5,000 fatalities related to trucking accidents in the United States. The trucking industry has since made significant efforts in increasing safety regulations. In 2008 the industry had successfully lowered the fatality rate to just over 4,000 deaths. But trucking accidents are still an issue that causes thousands of deaths and injuries each year. Approximately 6,000 trucking accident fatalities occur annually in the United States. Fatalities are not the only issue caused by trucking accidents. Here are some of the environmental issues that arise with trucking accidents:\n* 14.4% of trucking accidents cause cargo to spill\n* 6.5% cause open flames\n\nFollowing increased pressure from ''The Times'' \"Cities Fit For Cycling\" campaign and from other media in Spring 2012, warning signs are now displayed on the backs of many [[Large goods vehicle|HGVs]]. These signs are directed against a common type of accident which occurs when the large vehicle turns left at a junction: a cyclist trying to pass on the nearside can be crushed against the HGV's wheels, especially if the driver cannot see the [[cyclist]]. The signs, such as the winning design of the [http://www.intandemcompetition.com InTANDEM road safety competition] launched in March 2012, advocate extra care when passing a large vehicle on the nearside.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Transport|Cars}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Animal transporter]]\n* [[Articulated hauler]]\n* [[Driverless truck|Autonomous truck]]\n* [[Ballast tractor]]\n* [[Campervan]]\n* [[Cutaway van chassis]]\n* [[Dekotora]], Japanese decorated trucks\n* [[Food truck]]\n* [[Glossary of the American trucking industry]]\n* [[Great West Truck Show]]\n* [[Hand truck]]\n* [[Haul truck]]\n* [[Kei truck]]\n* [[List of military trucks]]\n* [[List of pickup trucks]]\n* [[List of trucks]]\n* [[Logging truck]]\n* [[Multi-stop truck]]\n* [[Roll-off (dumpster)|Roll-off truck]]\n* [[Tail lift]]\n* [[Traffic congestion]]\n* [[Truck art in South Asia]]\n* [[Truck classification]]\n* [[Truck hijacking]]\n* [[Truck scale]]\n* [[Truck stop]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=upper-alpha}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons}}\n* {{Britannica|606963|Truck (vehicle)}}\n* {{curlie|Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Trucking/}}\n* [http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/ Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration]\n* [http://www.returnloads.net/Industry-Info/General/Haulage-Courier-vehicle-types-and-weights Different sizes and classes of trucks in the UK]\n* {{Cite journal|last=Hutchinson |first=Rollin W., Jr.|date=January 1912|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv--PfedzLAC&pg=PA268|title=Motor Trucks \u2013 The New Freighters: Quicker and More Reliable Service, Cleaner and Less Congested Cities, Concrete Examples of Saving|journal=[[World's Work|The World's Work: A History of Our Time]]|volume=XXIII|pages=268\u2013187|accessdate=10 July 2009}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Trucks| ]]\n[[Category:Carriages and mountings]]\n[[Category:Vehicles introduced in 1896]]\n", "name_user": "Lunaloop", "label": "safe", "comment": "added a picture of an important country specific truck type", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck"}

The area was known as ''Jan the Lacher's Hook'', so called for the man who was the [[Homestead (buildings)|bowery's]] second superintendent, [[Jan Everts Bout]]. For many years, the village, often referred to by [[Washington Irving]], existed where the [[Liberty Science Center]] now stands. For hundreds of years it was a [[ferry]] port for local communities of [[Bergen, New Netherland|Bergen]], [[Bergen Township, New Jersey (pre-1862)|Bergen Township]], and [[Hudson County]], as well suburban and long-distance travelers to [[Manhattan]].\n\nIn the latter half of 19th century, a small island named [[Black Tom explosion#Black Tom Island|Black Tom]] was joined via landfill with the mainland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/dep/parksandforests/parks/liberty_state_park/liberty_blacktomexplosion.html|title=Liberty State Park: Black Tom Explosion|publisher=State of New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection|date=January 26, 2005|access-date=April 8, 2014}}</ref> It became a major shipping, manufacturing, and transportation hub within [[Port of New York and New Jersey]], leading to the construction of [[Communipaw Terminal]]. It was from this ferry/train station that many immigrants arriving at [[Ellis Island]] spread out across the USA. In 1916, on what is now the southeastern corner of the park, the Black Tom explosion killed as many as seven people, caused $20 million in property damage, and was felt throughout the [[Tri-State Region]].\n[[File:LibertyStatePark(pre1976).tif|thumb|left|Before opening, LSP was the site of abandoned rail facilities built on landfills]]\nConstruction of the [[North River Tunnels]], [[containerization]], and the [[Interstate Highway System]], made the area less viable. The decline of industry, deterioration of rail and maritime infrastructure, and toxic waste, eventually made the area obsolete.

The area was known as ''Jan the Lacher's Hook'', so called for the man who was the [[Homestead (buildings)|bowery's]] second superintendent, [[Jan Everts Bout]]. For many years, the village, often referred to by [[Washington Irving]], existed where the [[Liberty Science Center]] now stands. For hundreds of years it was a [[ferry]] port for local communities of [[Bergen, New Netherland|Bergen]], [[Bergen Township, New Jersey (pre-1862)|Bergen Township]], and [[Hudson County]], as well suburban and long-distance travelers to [[Manhattan]].\n\nIn the latter half of 19th century, a small island named [[Black Tom explosion#Black Tom Island|Black Tom]] was joined via landfill with the mainland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.nj.us/dep/parksandforests/parks/liberty_state_park/liberty_blacktomexplosion.html|title=Liberty State Park: Black Tom Explosion|publisher=State of New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection|date=January 26, 2005|access-date=April 8, 2014}}</ref> It became a major shipping, manufacturing, and transportation hub within [[Port of New York and New Jersey]], leading to the construction of [[Communipaw Terminal]]. It was from this ferry/train station that many immigrants arriving at [[Ellis Island]] spread out across the USA. In 1916, on what is now the southeastern corner of the park, the Black Tom explosion killed as many as seven people, caused $20 million in property damage, and was felt throughout the [[Tri-State Region]].\n[[File:LibertyStatePark(pre1976).tif|thumb|left|Before opening, LSP was the site of abandoned rail facilities built on landfills]]\nConstruction of the [[North River Tunnels]], [[containerization]], and the [[Interstate Highway System]], made the area less viable. The decline of industry, deterioration of rail and maritime infrastructure, and toxic waste, eventually made the area obsolete.

Attracted to politics at a young age, he became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Martin Van Buren]], the eighth [[President of the United States]]. After studying at [[Yale University]] and [[New York University School of Law]], Tilden began a legal career in [[New York City]], becoming a noted corporate lawyer. He served in the [[New York State Assembly]] and helped launch Van Buren's [[third party (United States)|third party]], anti-[[slavery in the United States|slavery]] candidacy in the [[1848 United States presidential election|1848 presidential election]]. Though he opposed the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1860, Tilden supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] during the [[American Civil War]]. After the Civil War, Tilden was selected as the chairman of the [[New York State Democratic Committee]], and he managed Democratic nominee [[Horatio Seymour]]'s campaign in the [[1868 United States presidential election|1868 presidential election]]. \n\nTilden initially cooperated with the state party's [[Tammany Hall]] faction, but he broke with them in 1871 due to boss [[William M. Tweed]]'s rampant corruption. Tilden won election as [[Governor of New York]] in 1874, and in that office he helped break up the \"[[Canal Ring (New York)|Canal Ring]].\" Tilden's battle against public corruption, along with his personal fortune and electoral success in the country's most populous state, made him the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for president in 1876. Tilden was selected as the nominee on the second ballot of the [[1876 Democratic National Convention]]. In the general election, Tilden faced [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], another governor with reform credentials. Tilden focused his campaign on civil service reform, support for the [[gold standard]], and opposition to high taxes, but many of his supporters were more concerned with ending [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] in the South.\n\nMost observers initially believed that Tilden had won the election, but disputes in four states left both Tilden and Hayes without a majority of the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]]. As Tilden had won 184 electoral votes, one vote shy of a majority, a Hayes victory required that he sweep all of the disputed electoral votes. Against Tilden's wishes, Congress appointed the bipartisan [[Electoral Commission (United States)|Electoral Commission]] to settle the controversy. Republicans had a one-seat advantage on the Electoral Commission, and in a series of party-line rulings, ruled that Hayes had won all of the disputed electoral votes. In the [[Compromise of 1877]], Democratic leaders agreed to accept Hayes as the victor in return for the end of Reconstruction. Tilden was a major contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in the [[1880 United States presidential election|1880]] and [[1884 United States presidential election|1884 presidential elections]], but declined to run.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[Image:SamuelJTilden.jpeg|thumb|Samuel Tilden as a young man]]\n\nTilden was born in [[New Lebanon, New York]], the youngest son of Elam Tilden and Polly Jones Tilden.<ref>Bigelow (2009), pp. 12\u201315</ref> He was descended from [[Tylden (family)|Nathaniel Tilden]], an early [[English people|English]] settler who came to [[North America]] in 1634.

Like other Barnburners, Tilden sought to prevent the spread of slavery into the [[Mexican cession|land acquired from Mexico]] in the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]. He helped organize the 1848 [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]] Convention, which nominated Van Buren for president. Van Buren's candidacy in the [[1848 United States presidential election|1848 presidential election]] may have played a role in the victory of Whig nominee [[Zachary Taylor]] over Democratic nominee [[Lewis Cass]]. Unlike many other anti-slavery Democrats, Tilden did not join the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in the 1850s, but he did not have close relations with Democratic presidents [[Franklin Pierce]] and [[James Buchanan]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 94\u201395</ref> In [[New York state election, 1855|1855]], Tilden was the unsuccessful [[New York State Attorney General|state attorney general]] candidate of the \"[[Hunkers and Barnburners|Soft]]\" faction of Barnburners, which favored compromise and reconciliation with the Democratic Party.<ref>Robinson (2001), p. 85</ref> In [[New York state election, 1859|1859]], after he lost an election to serve as New York City's corporation counsel, Tilden announced that he was \"out of politics.\"<ref>Morris (2003), p. 95</ref>\n\nIn the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]], Tilden strongly opposed the candidacy of Republican presidential nominee [[Abraham Lincoln]].

Grant]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 97\u201398</ref> After the election, Tilden broke with [[William M. Tweed]], the leader of the [[Tammany Hall]] [[political machine]]. Through bribery, patronage, and control of [[Irish-American]] voters, Tweed and his allies had become the dominant power in both New York City and the state of New York.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 99\u2013102</ref> In 1871, former Tammany associate [[James O'Brien (U.S. Congressman)|James O'Brien]] leaked Tweed's account books to the ''[[New York Times]]''. The ''Times'' subsequently began a public crusade against Tammany Hall, and Tilden launched an investigation into Tweed's bank records. Tilden ran for the New York State Assembly as part of a slate of anti-Tammany Democrats; at the state party convention, he declared that it was \"time to proclaim that whoever plunders the people, though he steal the livery of heaven to serve the devil in, is no Democrat.\" The anti-Tammany Democrats, including Tilden, won a major victory in the [[New York state election, 1871|1871 state elections]], and Tweed was indicted on 120 counts of fraud and other violations. After the election, Tweed fled the state, but he was eventually extradited back to New York, where he died in prison in 1878.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 103\u2013104</ref>\n\nTilden's role in taking down Tweed bolstered his popularity, and he was elected Governor of New York in [[New York state election, 1874|1874]]. As governor, he continued to focus on rooting out corruption. He helped to break up the \"[[Canal Ring (New York)|Canal Ring]],\" a bipartisan group of state and local officials who had enriched themselves by overcharging for the maintenance of the [[New York State Canal System]]. Tilden gained a national reputation as a reform governor, a valuable asset given the number of [[Grant administration scandals|scandals]] that had come into public view during the [[presidency of Ulysses S. Grant]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 104\u2013105</ref>\n\nIn 1875, Tilden received an honorary LL.D. from [[Yale University]].<ref name=Yale_Catalogue>{{cite book |last=Yale University |date=1877 |title=Catalogue of the Officers and Graduates of Yale University |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=UahGAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA51 |location=New Haven, CT |publisher=Morehouse and Taylor |page=51}}</ref> At the same time, Yale also enrolled him as a graduate of the Class of 1837 and he received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree.<ref name=\"Yale_Catalogue\"/>\n\n==Presidential election of 1876==\n{{See also|Samuel Tilden presidential campaign, 1876}}\n\n===Democratic nomination===\n[[Image:Tilden and Hendricks campaign poster.jpg|thumb|Campaign poster for the election of 1876]]\n\nBy the time of the June [[1876 Democratic National Convention]], Tilden had emerged as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in the [[1876 United States presidential election|1876 presidential election]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 106</ref> Tilden's appeal to the national party was based on his reputation for reform and his electoral success in the country's most populous state. He was also a skilled organizer whose canvassing system and field knowledge was so thorough that, months before the 1874 election, he'd predicted his own winning margin accurately to within 300 votes.<ref>Holt (2008), p. 100</ref> Tilden further bolstered his presidential candidacy through a nationwide newspaper advertising campaign. As many Democrats expected that their party would win the 1876 presidential elections, Tilden faced competition from some of the party's most prominent leaders, including [[Thomas F. Bayard]], [[Allen G. Thurman]], [[Thomas A. Hendricks]], and General [[Winfield Scott Hancock]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nDuring the difficult economic times of the [[Panic of 1873]], the major ideological divide in the Democratic Party concerned the issue of [[History of monetary policy in the United States|currency]]. Many \"soft money\" Democrats wanted Congress to repeal the [[Specie Payment Resumption Act]] and authorize the printing of more [[greenback (money)|greenback]]s, [[banknotes]] that had first been printed during the Civil War. The printing of more greenbacks would result in [[inflation]] and potentially benefit farmers by raising prices and helping them pay down their debts. Like most Republicans and \"hard money\" members of the conservative business establishment, Tilden believed that the termination of greenback circulation (which would return the country to the [[gold standard]]) was the best way to solve the ongoing economic crisis. Tilden's lieutenants at the Democratic National Convention emphasized Tilden's reform credentials above all else, but they also ensured that the party platform endorsed Tilden's hard money views.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 108\u2013109, 112\u2013114</ref> \n\nTilden won a majority of the votes cast on the first presidential ballot of the convention, but fell short of the two-thirds majority required to win the Democratic presidential nomination. His closest rival was Hendricks, who had the support of New York party boss [[John Kelly (New York politician)|John Kelly]] and the soft money faction of Democrats. Tilden won the necessary two-thirds majority on the second presidential ballot, and the convention then voted to make his nomination unanimous. Delegates unanimously chose Hendricks as Tilden's running mate, providing a balance between the hard money and soft money factions.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 115\u2013117</ref> Though the Republicans had nominated a ticket led by [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] of Ohio, another governor who had established a reputation for honest governance, Tilden was widely regarded as the favorite in the general election.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 80\u201383, 122</ref>\n\n===General election===\n[[File:1876 U.S. presidential election, contested states.png|thumb|upright=1.5|In the aftermath of the [[1876 United States presidential election|1876 presidential election]], the electoral votes of four states were disputed.]]\n\nPer tradition, both Tilden and Hayes avoided publicly campaigning for president, leaving that task to their supporters; Tilden appointed [[Abram Hewitt]] to lead his campaign.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 123, 131\u2013132</ref> The Republican campaign established a major cash advantage, partly because Tilden refused to contribute much of his personal fortune to the campaign.<ref>Morris (2003), p. 121</ref> The Democrats campaigned on the theme of \"retrenchment and reform\" and attacked the \"corrupt centralism\" of the Grant administration.<ref name=\"morris118120\"/> Tilden blamed high taxes and the Grant administration for the economic downturn, and, like Hayes, promised [[U.S. Civil Service Reform|civil service reform]] and hard money policies.<ref>White (2017), pp. 328\u2013330</ref> Republicans, meanwhile, focused on their party's identification with Lincoln and the Union cause in the Civil War; many Republicans still associated the Democratic Party with slavery and disunion.<ref name=\"morris118120\">Morris (2003), pp. 118\u2013120</ref> Rebutting Republican charges, Tilden categorically denied that he had any intention of compensating the South for any slaves emancipated or losses suffered during the Civil War.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 161\u2013162</ref> For their part, many Democrats cared little for Tilden's emphasis on reform, and were instead focused on ending sixteen years of Republican leadership. Southern Democrats especially hoped to end [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] and gain control of South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana, the last three \"[[Redeemers|unredeemed]]\" Southern states.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 125\u2013126, 146</ref> Southern whites, who overwhelmingly favored Tilden, used violence and intimidation to suppress the turnout of Republican-leaning [[African-American]] voters.<ref>White (2017), pp. 330\u2013331</ref> Tilden worked to distance himself from violent encounters like the [[Hamburg massacre]], in which disgruntled Southern whites clashed with the Republican-led government of South Carolina.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 129\u2013131</ref>\n\nBoth campaigns considered New York, Ohio, and Indiana to be the key [[swing states]], but the campaigns also focused on several smaller states, including the three unredeemed Southern states.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 155\u2013156</ref> Ultimately, Hayes swept the West and won much of the North, but Tilden carried the closely contested Northern states of New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut, swept the [[border states (American Civil War)|border states]], and carried most of the South. He had won a majority of the popular vote and tallied clear victories in seventeen states, leaving him one [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]] short of a majority. On November 6, the day after election day, most major newspapers reported that Tilden had won the election; however, Hayes still had a narrow path to victory if he could sweep the electoral votes of Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 164\u2013166</ref> Hayes refused to formally concede, but told members of the press that he was \"of the opinion that the Democrats have carried the country and elected Tilden.\"<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 167\u2013171</ref> Tilden, meanwhile, urged his alarmed followers, many of whom believed that the Republicans were attempting to steal the election, to remain calm and refrain from violence. Both parties feared the possibility that a dispute over the election would lead to armed conflict; Tilden discussed appointing General [[George B. McClellan]] as his military assistant, while President Grant ordered army and naval units to reinforce Washington.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 172\u2013174</ref>\n\n===Post-election controversy===\n[[Image:SJTilden of NY.jpg|thumb|right|Samuel Jones Tilden]]\n\nWith the election in doubt, each party sent some of their most prominent leaders to monitor the election process in the three disputed Southern states. Initial election returns showed that Hayes had carried South Carolina by several hundred votes, but that Tilden had won Florida by 91 votes and Louisiana by over 6000 votes. Republicans controlled the bodies charged with determining the validity of election results in all three states.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 174\u2013178</ref> On November 22, the South Carolina canvassing board adjourned after declaring that Hayes had won the state's electoral votes.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 180\u2013182</ref> On December 4, the Louisiana canvassing board announced that it had thrown out 15,623 votes due to \"systemic intimidation,\" leaving Hayes as the winner of all of the state's electoral votes.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 191\u2013192</ref> Early on the morning of December 6, the day the Electoral College was scheduled to convene, the Florida canvassing board announced that Hayes had won the state by a margin of 924 votes.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 193\u2013197</ref> Democrats challenged the results in all three contested Southern states. Meanwhile, another controversy had arisen in Oregon, where a Hayes elector, John Watts, resigned because his simultaneous service as a presidential elector and as a low-ranking official in the [[United States Post Office Department|Post Office]] violated the [[United States Constitution]]. After Watts resigned, the state's Democratic governor appointed an elector to fill the vacancy, while, separately, the state's two remaining Hayes electors chose a third elector to fill the vacancy caused by Watts's resignation.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 183\u2013185, 197\u2013198</ref>\n\nOn December 6, the members of the Electoral College met in Washington, D.C., but the disputes in four states prevented a conclusive vote for president.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 197\u2013198</ref> With the Electoral College unable to select a president, the disputed election became an issue for Congress to settle; Republicans controlled the Senate, while Democrats controlled the House. The vague wording of the Constitution gave rise to further controversy, as Republicans held that [[Thomas W. Ferry]], a Republican senator from Michigan and the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore]] of the [[United States Senate]], could determine the validity of the disputed electoral votes. Democrats argued that Ferry could only count the votes that were not disputed; in such a scenario, neither candidate would have an electoral vote majority, necessitating a [[contingent election]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Since Democrats controlled a majority of the state delegations in the House, they would be able to elect Tilden as president in a contingent election.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 200\u2013201</ref> In response to the controversy, Tilden compiled his own study of electoral procedures in the previous 22 presidential elections. He delivered the study to every sitting member of Congress, but congressional Republicans were not swayed by Tilden's argument that history supported the Democratic position on the election returns.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 203\u2013204</ref> He continued to call for calm, and rejected Abram Hewitt's suggestion that he ask his supporters to engage in mass public demonstrations.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 206\u2013207, 214</ref>\n\n===Electoral Commission===\n[[File:President Rutherford Hayes 1870 - 1880 Restored.jpg|thumb|upright=1|[[Rutherford B. Hayes]] defeated Tilden in the 1876 election.]]\n\nOn January 26, both houses of Congress agreed to establish the 15-member [[Electoral Commission (United States)|Electoral Commission]] to settle the dispute over the contested electoral votes. The commission consisted of five Democratic members of Congress, five Republican members of Congress, and five justices of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. Of the Supreme Court justices, two were to be Democrats, two were to be Republicans, and the fifth justice would be selected by the other four justices. Tilden opposed the creation of the Electoral Commission because he still hoped to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives, but he was unable to prevent Democratic congressmen from voting for the establishment of the commission. Most had expected that the fifth justice on the commission would be Associate Justice [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]], a [[political independent]], but Davis refused to serve on the commission after he accepted election to the Senate. Another associate justice, Republican [[Joseph P. Bradley]], was instead chosen as the fifth justice on the Electoral Commission.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 216\u2013219</ref> In a series of 8-to-7, party-line decisions, the Electoral Commission voted to award all of the contested electoral votes to Hayes.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 222\u2013235</ref>\n\nEven after the Electoral Commission delivered its rulings, the House of Representatives could have blocked the inauguration of Hayes by refusing to certify the election results.<ref>White (2017), p. 332</ref> Though some House Democrats hoped to do just that, they were unable to prevent the House of Representatives from blocking certification, as many House Democrats joined with their Republican colleagues in accepting the results.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 235\u2013236</ref> During the proceedings of the Electoral Commission, high-ranking members of both parties had discussed the possibility of declaring Hayes the winner in exchange for the removal of all federal troops from the South. The [[Compromise of 1877]], as it became known, may have played a role in preventing the House from challenging the Electoral Commission's rulings, although author Roy Morris, Jr. argues that the compromise \"was more a mutual concession of the obvious than a device for controlling larger events.\"<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 232\u2013234</ref> Some other historians, including [[C.

Potter was appointed as the head of the commission, which Democrats hoped would implicate Hayes and damage the Republican Party in the next presidential election.<ref>Guenther (1983), 284\u2013285</ref> Rather than produce conclusive evidence of Republican malfeasance, the committee uncovered conflicting evidence that reflected poorly on election and campaign officials of both parties. For ten months beginning in May 1878, the Potter Committee subpoenaed all telegrams sent by political operatives during the election dispute. 29,275 telegrams had been sent, but all save 641 had been routinely destroyed by [[Western Union]]. The remaining telegrams were in cipher, as was common with business and political communication in the telegraph era. ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' editor [[Whitelaw Reid]] obtained and deciphered many of the telegrams and, in October 1878, he published the story of the Democratic efforts to sway election officials through bribery and other means.

Attracted to politics at a young age, he became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Martin Van Buren]], the eighth [[President of the United States]]. After studying at [[Yale University]] and [[New York University School of Law]], Tilden began a legal career in [[New York City]], becoming a noted corporate lawyer. He served in the [[New York State Assembly]] and helped launch Van Buren's [[third party (United States)|third party]], anti-[[slavery in the United States|slavery]] candidacy in the [[1848 United States presidential election|1848 presidential election]]. Though he opposed the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1860, Tilden supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] during the [[American Civil War]]. After the Civil War, Tilden was selected as the chairman of the [[New York State Democratic Committee]], and he managed Democratic nominee [[Horatio Seymour]]'s campaign in the [[1868 United States presidential election|1868 presidential election]]. \n\nTilden initially cooperated with the state party's [[Tammany Hall]] faction, but he broke with them in 1871 due to boss [[William M. Tweed]]'s rampant corruption. Tilden won election as [[Governor of New York]] in 1874, and in that office he helped break up the \"[[Canal Ring (New York)|Canal Ring]].\" Tilden's battle against public corruption, along with his personal fortune and electoral success in the country's most populous state, made him the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for president in 1876. Tilden was selected as the nominee on the second ballot of the [[1876 Democratic National Convention]]. In the general election, Tilden faced [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], another governor with reform credentials. Tilden focused his campaign on civil service reform, support for the [[gold standard]], and opposition to high taxes, but many of his supporters were more concerned with ending [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] in the South.\n\nMost observers initially believed that Tilden had won the election, but disputes in four states left both Tilden and Hayes without a majority of the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]]. As Tilden had won 184 electoral votes, one vote shy of a majority, a Hayes victory required that he sweep all of the disputed electoral votes. Against Tilden's wishes, Congress appointed the bipartisan [[Electoral Commission (United States)|Electoral Commission]] to settle the controversy. Republicans had a one-seat advantage on the Electoral Commission, and in a series of party-line rulings, ruled that Hayes had won all of the disputed electoral votes. In the [[Compromise of 1877]], Democratic leaders agreed to accept Hayes as the victor in return for the end of Reconstruction. Tilden was a major contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in the [[1880 United States presidential election|1880]] and [[1884 United States presidential election|1884 presidential elections]], but declined to run.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[Image:SamuelJTilden.jpeg|thumb|Samuel Tilden as a young man]]\n\nTilden was born in [[New Lebanon, New York]], the youngest son of Elam Tilden and Polly Jones Tilden.<ref>Bigelow (2009), pp. 12\u201315</ref> He was descended from [[Tylden (family)|Nathaniel Tilden]], an early [[English people|English]] settler who came to [[North America]] in 1634.

Like other Barnburners, Tilden sought to prevent the spread of slavery into the [[Mexican cession|land acquired from Mexico]] in the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]. He helped organize the 1848 [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]] Convention, which nominated Van Buren for president. Van Buren's candidacy in the [[1848 United States presidential election|1848 presidential election]] may have played a role in the victory of Whig nominee [[Zachary Taylor]] over Democratic nominee [[Lewis Cass]]. Unlike many other anti-slavery Democrats, Tilden did not join the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in the 1850s, but he did not have close relations with Democratic presidents [[Franklin Pierce]] and [[James Buchanan]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 94\u201395</ref> In [[New York state election, 1855|1855]], Tilden was the unsuccessful [[New York State Attorney General|state attorney general]] candidate of the \"[[Hunkers and Barnburners|Soft]]\" faction of Barnburners, which favored compromise and reconciliation with the Democratic Party.<ref>Robinson (2001), p. 85</ref> In [[New York state election, 1859|1859]], after he lost an election to serve as New York City's corporation counsel, Tilden announced that he was \"out of politics.\"<ref>Morris (2003), p. 95</ref>\n\nIn the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]], Tilden strongly opposed the candidacy of Republican presidential nominee [[Abraham Lincoln]]. He warned that the election of Lincoln could lead to the secession of the South and a subsequent civil war.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 95\u201396</ref> Tilden initially opposed using force to prevent secession, but he supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] after the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]]. Tilden served as the manager of [[Horatio Seymour]]'s successful 1862 campaign for governor, and played a key role in securing the nomination of [[George B.

He served as Seymour's campaign chairman in the [[1868 United States presidential election|1868 presidential election]], but Seymour lost the election to Republican nominee [[Ulysses S. Grant]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 97\u201398</ref> After the election, Tilden broke with [[William M. Tweed]], the leader of the [[Tammany Hall]] [[political machine]]. Through bribery, patronage, and control of [[Irish-American]] voters, Tweed and his allies had become the dominant power in both New York City and the state of New York.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 99\u2013102</ref> In 1871, former Tammany associate [[James O'Brien (U.S. Congressman)|James O'Brien]] leaked Tweed's account books to the ''[[New York Times]]''. The ''Times'' subsequently began a public crusade against Tammany Hall, and Tilden launched an investigation into Tweed's bank records. Tilden ran for the New York State Assembly as part of a slate of anti-Tammany Democrats; at the state party convention, he declared that it was \"time to proclaim that whoever plunders the people, though he steal the livery of heaven to serve the devil in, is no Democrat.\" The anti-Tammany Democrats, including Tilden, won a major victory in the [[New York state election, 1871|1871 state elections]], and Tweed was indicted on 120 counts of fraud and other violations. After the election, Tweed fled the state, but he was eventually extradited back to New York, where he died in prison in 1878.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 103\u2013104</ref>\n\nTilden's role in taking down Tweed bolstered his popularity, and he was elected Governor of New York in [[New York state election, 1874|1874]]. As governor, he continued to focus on rooting out corruption. He helped to break up the \"[[Canal Ring (New York)|Canal Ring]],\" a bipartisan group of state and local officials who had enriched themselves by overcharging for the maintenance of the [[New York State Canal System]]. Tilden gained a national reputation as a reform governor, a valuable asset given the number of [[Grant administration scandals|scandals]] that had come into public view during the [[presidency of Ulysses S. Grant]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 104\u2013105</ref>\n\nIn 1875, Tilden received an honorary LL.D. from [[Yale University]].<ref name=Yale_Catalogue>{{cite book |last=Yale University |date=1877 |title=Catalogue of the Officers and Graduates of Yale University |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=UahGAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA51 |location=New Haven, CT |publisher=Morehouse and Taylor |page=51}}</ref> At the same time, Yale also enrolled him as a graduate of the Class of 1837 and he received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree.<ref name=\"Yale_Catalogue\"/>\n\n==Presidential election of 1876==\n{{See also|Samuel Tilden presidential campaign, 1876}}\n\n===Democratic nomination===\n[[Image:Tilden and Hendricks campaign poster.jpg|thumb|Campaign poster for the election of 1876]]\n\nBy the time of the June [[1876 Democratic National Convention]], Tilden had emerged as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in the [[1876 United States presidential election|1876 presidential election]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 106</ref> Tilden's appeal to the national party was based on his reputation for reform and his electoral success in the country's most populous state. He was also a skilled organizer whose canvassing system and field knowledge was so thorough that, months before the 1874 election, he'd predicted his own winning margin accurately to within 300 votes.<ref>Holt (2008), p. 100</ref> Tilden further bolstered his presidential candidacy through a nationwide newspaper advertising campaign. As many Democrats expected that their party would win the 1876 presidential elections, Tilden faced competition from some of the party's most prominent leaders, including [[Thomas F. Bayard]], [[Allen G. Thurman]], [[Thomas A. Hendricks]], and General [[Winfield Scott Hancock]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nDuring the difficult economic times of the [[Panic of 1873]], the major ideological divide in the Democratic Party concerned the issue of [[History of monetary policy in the United States|currency]]. Many \"soft money\" Democrats wanted Congress to repeal the [[Specie Payment Resumption Act]] and authorize the printing of more [[greenback (money)|greenback]]s, [[banknotes]] that had first been printed during the Civil War. The printing of more greenbacks would result in [[inflation]] and potentially benefit farmers by raising prices and helping them pay down their debts. Like most Republicans and \"hard money\" members of the conservative business establishment, Tilden believed that the termination of greenback circulation (which would return the country to the [[gold standard]]) was the best way to solve the ongoing economic crisis. Tilden's lieutenants at the Democratic National Convention emphasized Tilden's reform credentials above all else, but they also ensured that the party platform endorsed Tilden's hard money views.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 108\u2013109, 112\u2013114</ref> \n\nTilden won a majority of the votes cast on the first presidential ballot of the convention, but fell short of the two-thirds majority required to win the Democratic presidential nomination. His closest rival was Hendricks, who had the support of New York party boss [[John Kelly (New York politician)|John Kelly]] and the soft money faction of Democrats. Tilden won the necessary two-thirds majority on the second presidential ballot, and the convention then voted to make his nomination unanimous. Delegates unanimously chose Hendricks as Tilden's running mate, providing a balance between the hard money and soft money factions.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 115\u2013117</ref> Though the Republicans had nominated a ticket led by [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] of Ohio, another governor who had established a reputation for honest governance, Tilden was widely regarded as the favorite in the general election.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 80\u201383, 122</ref>\n\n===General election===\n[[File:1876 U.S. presidential election, contested states.png|thumb|upright=1.5|In the aftermath of the [[1876 United States presidential election|1876 presidential election]], the electoral votes of four states were disputed.]]\n\nPer tradition, both Tilden and Hayes avoided publicly campaigning for president, leaving that task to their supporters; Tilden appointed [[Abram Hewitt]] to lead his campaign.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 123, 131\u2013132</ref> The Republican campaign established a major cash advantage, partly because Tilden refused to contribute much of his personal fortune to the campaign.<ref>Morris (2003), p. 121</ref> The Democrats campaigned on the theme of \"retrenchment and reform\" and attacked the \"corrupt centralism\" of the Grant administration.<ref name=\"morris118120\"/> Tilden blamed high taxes and the Grant administration for the economic downturn, and, like Hayes, promised [[U.S. Civil Service Reform|civil service reform]] and hard money policies.<ref>White (2017), pp. 328\u2013330</ref> Republicans, meanwhile, focused on their party's identification with Lincoln and the Union cause in the Civil War; many Republicans still associated the Democratic Party with slavery and disunion.<ref name=\"morris118120\">Morris (2003), pp. 118\u2013120</ref> Rebutting Republican charges, Tilden categorically denied that he had any intention of compensating the South for any slaves emancipated or losses suffered during the Civil War.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 161\u2013162</ref> For their part, many Democrats cared little for Tilden's emphasis on reform, and were instead focused on ending sixteen years of Republican leadership. Southern Democrats especially hoped to end [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] and gain control of South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana, the last three \"[[Redeemers|unredeemed]]\" Southern states.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 125\u2013126, 146</ref> Southern whites, who overwhelmingly favored Tilden, used violence and intimidation to suppress the turnout of Republican-leaning [[African-American]] voters.<ref>White (2017), pp. 330\u2013331</ref> Tilden worked to distance himself from violent encounters like the [[Hamburg massacre]], in which disgruntled Southern whites clashed with the Republican-led government of South Carolina.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 129\u2013131</ref>\n\nBoth campaigns considered New York, Ohio, and Indiana to be the key [[swing states]], but the campaigns also focused on several smaller states, including the three unredeemed Southern states.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 155\u2013156</ref> Ultimately, Hayes swept the West and won much of the North, but Tilden carried the closely contested Northern states of New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut, swept the [[border states (American Civil War)|border states]], and carried most of the South. He had won a majority of the popular vote and tallied clear victories in seventeen states, leaving him one [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]] short of a majority. On November 6, the day after election day, most major newspapers reported that Tilden had won the election; however, Hayes still had a narrow path to victory if he could sweep the electoral votes of Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 164\u2013166</ref> Hayes refused to formally concede, but told members of the press that he was \"of the opinion that the Democrats have carried the country and elected Tilden.\"<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 167\u2013171</ref> Tilden, meanwhile, urged his alarmed followers, many of whom believed that the Republicans were attempting to steal the election, to remain calm and refrain from violence. Both parties feared the possibility that a dispute over the election would lead to armed conflict; Tilden discussed appointing General [[George B. McClellan]] as his military assistant, while President Grant ordered army and naval units to reinforce Washington.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 172\u2013174</ref>\n\n===Post-election controversy===\n[[Image:SJTilden of NY.jpg|thumb|right|Samuel Jones Tilden]]\n\nWith the election in doubt, each party sent some of their most prominent leaders to monitor the election process in the three disputed Southern states. Initial election returns showed that Hayes had carried South Carolina by several hundred votes, but that Tilden had won Florida by 91 votes and Louisiana by over 6000 votes. Republicans controlled the bodies charged with determining the validity of election results in all three states.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 174\u2013178</ref> On November 22, the South Carolina canvassing board adjourned after declaring that Hayes had won the state's electoral votes.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 180\u2013182</ref> On December 4, the Louisiana canvassing board announced that it had thrown out 15,623 votes due to \"systemic intimidation,\" leaving Hayes as the winner of all of the state's electoral votes.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 191\u2013192</ref> Early on the morning of December 6, the day the Electoral College was scheduled to convene, the Florida canvassing board announced that Hayes had won the state by a margin of 924 votes.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 193\u2013197</ref> Democrats challenged the results in all three contested Southern states. Meanwhile, another controversy had arisen in Oregon, where a Hayes elector, John Watts, resigned because his simultaneous service as a presidential elector and as a low-ranking official in the [[United States Post Office Department|Post Office]] violated the [[United States Constitution]]. After Watts resigned, the state's Democratic governor appointed an elector to fill the vacancy, while, separately, the state's two remaining Hayes electors chose a third elector to fill the vacancy caused by Watts's resignation.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 183\u2013185, 197\u2013198</ref>\n\nOn December 6, the members of the Electoral College met in Washington, D.C., but the disputes in four states prevented a conclusive vote for president.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 197\u2013198</ref> With the Electoral College unable to select a president, the disputed election became an issue for Congress to settle; Republicans controlled the Senate, while Democrats controlled the House. The vague wording of the Constitution gave rise to further controversy, as Republicans held that [[Thomas W. Ferry]], a Republican senator from Michigan and the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore]] of the [[United States Senate]], could determine the validity of the disputed electoral votes. Democrats argued that Ferry could only count the votes that were not disputed; in such a scenario, neither candidate would have an electoral vote majority, necessitating a [[contingent election]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Since Democrats controlled a majority of the state delegations in the House, they would be able to elect Tilden as president in a contingent election.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 200\u2013201</ref> In response to the controversy, Tilden compiled his own study of electoral procedures in the previous 22 presidential elections. He delivered the study to every sitting member of Congress, but congressional Republicans were not swayed by Tilden's argument that history supported the Democratic position on the election returns.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 203\u2013204</ref> He continued to call for calm, and rejected Abram Hewitt's suggestion that he ask his supporters to engage in mass public demonstrations.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 206\u2013207, 214</ref>\n\n===Electoral Commission===\n[[File:President Rutherford Hayes 1870 - 1880 Restored.jpg|thumb|upright=1|[[Rutherford B. Hayes]] defeated Tilden in the 1876 election.]]\n\nOn January 26, both houses of Congress agreed to establish the 15-member [[Electoral Commission (United States)|Electoral Commission]] to settle the dispute over the contested electoral votes. The commission consisted of five Democratic members of Congress, five Republican members of Congress, and five justices of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. Of the Supreme Court justices, two were to be Democrats, two were to be Republicans, and the fifth justice would be selected by the other four justices. Tilden opposed the creation of the Electoral Commission because he still hoped to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives, but he was unable to prevent Democratic congressmen from voting for the establishment of the commission. Most had expected that the fifth justice on the commission would be Associate Justice [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]], a [[political independent]], but Davis refused to serve on the commission after he accepted election to the Senate. Another associate justice, Republican [[Joseph P. Bradley]], was instead chosen as the fifth justice on the Electoral Commission.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 216\u2013219</ref> In a series of 8-to-7, party-line decisions, the Electoral Commission voted to award all of the contested electoral votes to Hayes.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 222\u2013235</ref>\n\nEven after the Electoral Commission delivered its rulings, the House of Representatives could have blocked the inauguration of Hayes by refusing to certify the election results.<ref>White (2017), p. 332</ref> Though some House Democrats hoped to do just that, they were unable to prevent the House of Representatives from blocking certification, as many House Democrats joined with their Republican colleagues in accepting the results.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 235\u2013236</ref> During the proceedings of the Electoral Commission, high-ranking members of both parties had discussed the possibility of declaring Hayes the winner in exchange for the removal of all federal troops from the South. The [[Compromise of 1877]], as it became known, may have played a role in preventing the House from challenging the Electoral Commission's rulings, although author Roy Morris, Jr. argues that the compromise \"was more a mutual concession of the obvious than a device for controlling larger events.\"<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 232\u2013234</ref> Some other historians, including [[C. Vann Woodward]], have argued that the Compromise of 1877 played the decisive role in determining the outcome of the election.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kleinfeld |first1=N.

Potter was appointed as the head of the commission, which Democrats hoped would implicate Hayes and damage the Republican Party in the next presidential election.<ref>Guenther (1983), 284\u2013285</ref> Rather than produce conclusive evidence of Republican malfeasance, the committee uncovered conflicting evidence that reflected poorly on election and campaign officials of both parties. For ten months beginning in May 1878, the Potter Committee subpoenaed all telegrams sent by political operatives during the election dispute. 29,275 telegrams had been sent, but all save 641 had been routinely destroyed by [[Western Union]]. The remaining telegrams were in cipher, as was common with business and political communication in the telegraph era. ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' editor [[Whitelaw Reid]] obtained and deciphered many of the telegrams and, in October 1878, he published the story of the Democratic efforts to sway election officials through bribery and other means. The revelation of the bribery attempts undercut the Democratic Party's argument that Tilden had been cheated out of the presidency.<ref>Kahn (1996), pp. 221\u2013229</ref> Tilden was not implicated in any wrongdoing, but the investigation into the Cipher Telegrams damaged his national standing.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 250\u2013251</ref>\n\n===Election of 1880===\n\nAfter the controversy over the election of 1876, Tilden became the presumptive Democratic candidate in [[1880 United States presidential election|1880 presidential election]]. He declined to run for another term as governor in 1879, focusing instead on building support for the 1880 presidential nomination.<ref>Clancy (1958), p. 52</ref> The revelations of the Potter Committee, along with Tilden's persistent health issues, both damaged Tilden's national standing, but his superior political organization and personal fortune ensured that he remained a serious contender for the Democratic nomination.<ref>Clancy (1958), pp. 56\u201357</ref> Tilden's standing with the party slipped further following the Republican victory in the [[New York state election, 1879|New York gubernatorial election in 1879]].

{"title_page": "List of My Name Is Earl characters", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE: List of ''My Name Is Earl'' characters}}\nThe [[NBC]] sitcom television series ''[[My Name Is Earl]]'' created by [[Greg Garcia (producer)|Greg Garcia]] features a variety of characters, most of whom live in the fictional town of Camden and Camden County. The show centers around Earl Hickey, a small-time crook who after an epiphany involving [[karma]], makes a list of items in which he had done wrong to others, and proceeds to make amends to the people involved. The characters listed include Earl's immediate family, friends and acquaintances, as well as general townsfolk who have appeared over multiple episodes and storylines.\n\n==Main characters==\n===Earl Hickey===\n[[File:Jason Lee.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]] portrayed Earl Hickey on the series]]\nEarl Jehosephat Hickey<ref name=\"probe1\" group=\"lower-alpha\">{{cite episode|title=Inside Probe, Part 1|series=My Name Is Earl|credits=|network=NBC|airdate=April 30, 2009|season=4|number=25}}</ref> (played by [[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]]){{efn-lr|Earl as a kid is played by  [[Noah Crawford]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsok.com/article/3662621|title=Noah Crawford talks about Nickelodeon's 'How to Rock' and the importance of persistence in forging an acting career|author=|date=April 2, 2012|website=newsok.com|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref><!-- also closing credits on some episodes -->}} {{mdash}} The titular and [[viewpoint character]], he has a long history of petty crimes and other repugnant acts of bullying classmates and taking advantage of others. In the opening episode, he wins a [[Scratchcard|lottery scratcher]] but is immediately hit by a car; during his recovery where he watches a [[Carson Daly]] interview where the latter talks about [[karma]], he [[Epiphany (feeling)|realizes]] he has been a bad person and tries to turn his life around by making a list of all the bad things he has done and doing the good deeds to cross them off the list. He discovers that when he does good things, he is rewarded by karma, first by getting the lottery ticket back. But when he ignores the list, as especially demonstrated in the episode \"The Professor\", bad things continue to happen. One of the [[recurring gag]]s regarding Earl is that he always has his eyes closed when his picture is taken. He has a mustache and tends to wear [[flannel shirts]], although in his past, he also wears concert T-shirts from [[classic rock]] bands. He drives a 1973 red [[Chevrolet El Camino|El Camino]]<ref>https://www.torquenews.com/1081/my-name-earl\u2019s-1973-chevrolet-el-camino-auction</ref> that once belonged to his friend Frank: it has a blue driver's side door, found in a tornado. Earl's father Carl intended to name him after himself, but put in an extra loop on his cursive letter 'C' on the birth certificate.\n\nIn Season 4, it is discovered that Earl was always the biological father of Joy's oldest son Dodge. He attended a party dressed as a skeleton and slept with Joy after both were drunk at the time.\n\n===Randy Hickey===\n[[File:Ethan Suplee cropped.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Ethan Suplee]] portrayed Randy Hickey on the series]]\nRandall Doo Hickey<ref name=\"probe1\" group=\"lower-alpha\"/><!-- ep 4-7 quit your snitchin' randall --> (played by [[Ethan Suplee]]){{efn-lr|Randy as a kid is played by Ryan Armstrong.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/my-name-is-earl/episode-11-season-1/barn-burner/192266/|title=My Name Is Earl|author=|date=|website=TVGuide.com|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref>}} &ndash; Earl's younger brother. He and Earl used to commit a bunch of crimes together, but he goes along with Earl on his list. In \"Monkeys in Space\", when he tries to get a job, Earl finds that he is unable to fulfill his list item in time until Randy helps him.  In the episode \"Number One\", he breaks down and questions the entire process. His character was initially described as equally nasty and tough but after Earl started working on the list, he becomes naive, childlike, and simplistic.<ref name=\"whatculture randy\">{{cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/tv/10-famous-tv-characters-randomly-changed-personalities?page=6|title=10 Famous TV Characters Who Randomly Changed Personalities|author=|date=February 10, 2014|website=whatculture.com|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref> In \"Harassed a Reporter\" he is upset that the reporter portrayed him as mentally retarded, but when she mentions that it could be karma, he is happy that karma noticed him and considered him important.\n\nRandy has a crush on Catalina, calling [[wikt:dibs|dibs]] on her when they first met. He dated a woman who liked cats in the episode \"Larceny of a Kitty Cat\", despite being allergic to them. Although he is afraid of birds, especially chickens, he is willing to forgo that for love as shown in \"South of the Border (Part 1)\", and in part 2, they get married at Catalina's village. In the episode \"Foreign Exchange Student\" he finally tells Catalina he loves her, but Catalina intentionally makes herself repulsive when they consummate the marriage later that night, after which Randy doesn't want to live with her anymore and just keeps it a [[green card marriage]].\n\nIn season 3, after finding that he is unable to function independently, he gets a job as a guard at the same state prison so he can hang out with Earl.  In the episode \"Creative Writing\", Earl remarks that a psychologist had called Randy [[Autism|\"borderline artistic\"]]. In the \"Inside Probe\" episodes, [[Geraldo Rivera]] describes him as the town [[wikt:simpleton|simpleton]] and reveals he has 77 misdemeanors like his brother.\n\n===Joy Turner===\n[[File:Jaime Pressly LF.JPG|thumb|120px|[[Jaime Pressly]] portrayed Joy Turner on the series]]\nJoy Farrah Turner ({{nee|Darville}}, also Joy Hickey)<!-- middle name as stated in episode 'Born a Gamblin' Man\" and \"inside probe\" --> (played by [[Jaime Pressly]]) is Earl's ex-wife who divorces him in the first episode and then marries his friend Darnell during the first season of the series. She is pessimistic, cold-hearted, stubborn and vain.  Joy is the mother of two boys, Dodge and Earl Jr. She drives a [[Subaru BRAT]] painted with the American flag.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mecum.com/lots/SC0510-92839/1985-subaru-brat-pickup/|title=1985 Subaru BRAT Pickup - W223 - Indianapolis 2010 - Mecum Auctions|author=|date=|website=Mecum Auctions|accessdate=August 3, 2017}}</ref><!-- coma episode they mentioned the BRAT by name and multiple episodes in season 4 --> Her [[catchphrase]]s are \"Oh, snap!\", \"What the hell\", and she frequently calls both Earl and Randy \"Dummy\". She is openly scornful of Earl's List, and has a strong dislike for Catalina, although she ends up saving her life in the fourth season.\n\nThe episodes \"The Bounty Hunter\" and \"Guess Who's Coming Out of Joy\" cover parts of Joy's past. When she was pregnant with her first child, she was kicked out of her parents' house in the neighboring town of Nathanville. She looked for a [[sugar daddy (slang term)|sugar daddy]], dating local celebrity [[#TV's Tim Stack|TV's Tim Stack]] briefly. She and her friends get Earl drunk, after which they have a [[shotgun wedding]] in Las Vegas and move into a trailer at the Pimmit Hills Trailer Park. She would often go along with Earl, Randy, Ralph, Donny and others on their crime sprees. She has an affair with Darnell but when she becomes pregnant with her second child, she convinces Earl that he is the father. Some years later, at the start of the series, she and Earl divorce, but after he signs the papers, he wins the lottery money.  Joy then tries some schemes to get her share, but eventually gives up. She then marries Darnell in the episode \"Joy's Wedding\". Although she is rather selfish and frugal, she cares deeply for her boys.\n\nIn the second season, Joy gets in trouble with the law when she was trying to return an entertainment system cabinet and ended up stealing a truck with a store employee in it. Her charges of grand theft auto, kidnapping, and assault would count as the [[Three-strikes law|third strike]], which would put her in prison for life. She is appointed a deaf lawyer ([[Marlee Matlin]]), who gets her involved with an [[addiction recovery group]] for her anger, and also prescribes happy pills. Hoping to evoke sympathy from the jury, Joy agrees to be a [[surrogate mother]] for her half-sister Liberty. The trial goes well until Earl's 911 calls are presented. However, Earl then confesses to all the crimes and takes the punishment.\n\nThe third season has Joy being pregnant while taking care of Randy until the latter becomes a guard at the prison that Earl is staying. She gives birth to the baby for Liberty and Ray Ray's family. Joy believed throughout the show that Little Chubby was the father of Dodge and Darnell was the father of Earl Jr. It is revealed in \"Dodges Dad\" that Earl is the biological father of Dodge, but Earl Jr.'s father is never named because of the shows cancellation.\n\n===Catalina {{anchor|Catalina Aruca}} ===\n<!-- per common name, use Catalina for the header -->\n[[File:Nadine Velazquez.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Nadine Velazquez]] portrayed Catalina Aruca on the series]]\nCatalina Rana Aruca{{efn-lr|Catalina's last name is mentioned multiple times in the season 3 \"Creative Writing\" episode. Her middle name is first mentioned in the season 4 \"Inside Probe\" episode}} (played by [[Nadine Velazquez]]){{mdash}}The beautiful housekeeper at Earl and Randy's motel. Randy has a major crush on Catalina, immediately calling [[wikt:dibs|dibs]] on her when they first met. She was the top dancer at Club Chubby for about a month, where her routine simply consisted of jumping in place to [[House of Pain]]'s \"[[Jump Around]]\" song, until one of the patrons died, at which she vowed never to dance again. She dislikes Joy, but later returns to Club Chubby in the season 2 episode \"Jump for Joy\" when she sees how Earl tries hard to make things better. She also helps Earl on one of the items on his list in the episode \"Mailbox\". Season 2 features a story arc where Catalina is arrested for speeding and deported to her village. When Earl and Randy arrive, she gets news that Earl has agreed to marry her, but Earl lets Randy do it. In the \"Foreign Exchange Student\" episode, Randy and Catalina rent an apartment in order to [[green card marriage|keep up appearances]], but when Randy tells her he loves her, Catalina tells Earl she only wants to be friends with Randy. She takes actions to be as physically repulsive as possible when Randy and she consummate their marriage, but afterwards regrets it as she finds that Randy is the best lover she's had. In the season 3 episode \"Love Octagon\", she declares that she is a new lesbian, but her attempts to woo [[#Billie Cunningham|Billie Cunningham]] fail. However, she reconciles with her former boyfriend Paco who previously tried to catch her attention in the years past but finally caught her.\n\nCatalina was born in the small town of Guadalatucky,<ref name=\"probe1\" group=\"lower-alpha\"/> a Latin American village stricken with violence and poverty.<!-- inside probe episode -->  She was prompted by her lover [[#Paco|Paco]] to come to America. She is placed in a crate and inside a car. In the season 4 flashback episode, \"Earl and Joy's Anniversary\", when she was trapped in the phone booth with some Africanized bees outside, she said she was from [[La Paz]], and lost her virginity in a [[foursome (group sex)|foursome]] with Darnell, Patty, and Kenny. She occasionally wires money to her family in the village. In the episode \"Kept a Guy Locked in a Truck\", it is revealed she lives in a shared laundry room at the motel.<!-- laundry room is from the motel as per season 3 coma episode, and later episodes have earl sharing the motel floor space -->.\n\nIn some episodes, Catalina breaks the [[fourth wall]] with her Spanish lines: In the episode \"[[My Name Is Earl (season 1)#ep11|Barn Burner]]\", she thanks the Latino audience for turning in every week;<ref name=\"episode1-11\" group=lower-alpha>{{cite episode | series=My Name is Earl | serieslink=My Name is Earl | title=Barn Burner | season=1 | number=11 | episodelink= My Name Is Earl (season 1)#ep11  | quote=Quiero agradecer al p\u00fablico latino que nos acompa\u00f1a cada semana.

He now acts as \"New Daddy\" to Joy's two sons.  He works in the local dive, \"The Crab Shack\". Whenever Earl greets Darnell, he calls him \"Crab Man\" (or \"Crabman\"), and he has a generally friendly disposition. In the episode \"[[Y2K (My Name Is Earl)|Y2K]]\", it is revealed that he used to go by the name Harry Monroe, until he was placed in a [[witness protection program]] where he was to assume his new identity of Darnell Turner and was told to avoid liking cheese (which he still likes). He has a pet tortoise whom he calls Mr. Turtle.\n\nPart of the season 4 episodes go into Darnell's history where he was raised and trained by his father Thomas Monroe (played by [[Danny Glover]]) in a secret government agency, and had developed the skills to be a top secret agent. However, when he refused to kill a nine-year-old leader of a socialist nation, and after testifying in court against his former employers, the government had to place him in witness protection from the agency. His cover is blown when he was shown on national television restraining Joy at a game show audition, so he, Joy, and their kids had to go under protection and assume other identities and live elsewhere. He agrees to join his father on one more mission, taking along Earl and sedating him multiple times, to free himself from having to need protection.\n\nIn the episode \"[[List of My Name Is Earl episodes|Our 'Cops' Is On]]\" it is shown that he used to live with his supposed grandmother and grew and sold marijuana in his bedroom. In \"Buried Treasure\", he narrates that he graduated from college at age 14, was a virtuoso cellist, and could identify 254 varieties of cheese. Darnell speaks multiple languages: In \"The Frank Factor\" he tells Catalina that he speaks French, Russian and Arabic. He is also seen reading a newspaper printed in another language. In \"My Name Is Alias\", Joy remarks that he knows 7 different languages, and 3 combat sports that ends in \"do.\" Occasionally, Darnell's afro is shown to hide cell phones which self-destruct after use. It is mentioned in season 4 he might have had a brother, and that his sister Pam died.\n\nIt is revealed in the very last episode of the show that Earl Jr., generally believed to be his son, is not.\n\n==Relatives of the protagonists==\n===Dodge Hickey===\nDodge Hickey (played by Louis T. Moyle) is Joy's oldest son. Joy was six months pregnant with him when she and Earl got married the day after they met. In the pilot, Earl tells us \"Joy didn't remember much about the boy's real father, except that he drove a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. So we named him [[Dodge]].\" His middle name is Chaz, named after Earl's childhood hero, astronaut Chaz Dalton. His biological father was the subject of several episodes: Frank was a possibility in \"[[The Frank Factor]]\", and in the season 4 finale \"Dodge's Dad\", Camden's biggest business owner Little Chubby was another possibility, but DNA tests later revealed Earl to be the biological father. It was revealed Joy hooked up with Earl at a Halloween party where he and Little Chubby wore the same costume in drunkenly had a one night stand.\n\n===Earl Hickey, Jr.===\nEarl Hickey, Jr. (played by Trey Carlisle) is Joy and Darnell's son. After introducing Dodge in the pilot, Earl explains, \"A few years later we were having our first child from my own personal seed. Doctors had already told us he was going to come out a boy, so we went ahead and named him.\" But as the doctor holds up a newborn [[Multiracial|mixed-race]] baby, Earl gets a confused look on his face and finishes: \"There he was \u2014 Earl Junior.\" He has a huge [[afro]] and is frequently seen playing rambunctiously with his half-brother, Dodge. Originally thought to be Darnell's child, a DNA test in the season 4 finale \"Dodge's Dad\" revealed that Darnell was not Earl Jr.'s father. Greg Garcia said that he and the writers had planned to make Earl Jr's dad someone famous, but because the show was cancelled, they never got a chance to figure it out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/watch_with_kristin/jason_lee_on_my_name_earl_movie_its_time/270861 |title=Jason Lee on My Name Is Earl Movie: \"It's Time!\" |publisher=E!

He first appears in \"[[My Name Is Earl (season 1)#ep9|Cost Dad the Election]]\" where he had run for mayor but lost because of Earl's shenanigans that got the latter arrested. He originally ran for mayor because of the airport flight path was directed over his residential area, causing his entire house to vibrate several times a day, which angers him very much. He is sorely disappointed in his sons and refused to have anything to do with Earl. However, he gradually realizes his son's efforts to improve his life were sincere and he and Earl are able to mend their relationship. In the episode \"Dad's Car\", he says that he had originally planned to name Earl after himself, but had put in an extra loop on the \"C\" when using [[cursive writing]] on the birth certificate.\n\n===Kay Hickey {{anchor|Katherine Hickey}} ===\nKatherine \"Kay\" Hickey (played by [[Nancy Lenehan]]) is Earl and Randy's mother.  She was also disappointed in Earl initially but is more tolerant than Carl. She is happy to see that Earl is now trying to turn his life around and eventually makes up with him for letting her down. She spends a lot of time dealing with Carl's battered ego. Earl's friend Ralph attempted unsuccessfully to come on to her after learning Earl had slept with Ralph's mother.\n\n===Liberty Washington===\nLiberty Washington (played by [[Tamala Jones]]) is Joy's mixed race half-sister, introduced in the season 2 episode \"Blow\". They had hated each other since grade school. She aspires to be a pro wrestler. She is married to Ray Ray. She and Joy eventually bond to the point where Joy became a [[surrogate mother]] for Liberty and her husband Ray Ray's baby. She and Ray Ray insist that Joy follow certain dietary restrictions and have a [[natural childbirth]].\n\n===Ray Ray Washington===\nRay Ray Washington (played by [[DJ Qualls]]) is Liberty's husband, who shares many character traits with Darnell. He owns a [[bearded dragon]] named \"Mr. Bearded Dragon\" whom he treats in the same fatherly manner that Darnell treats Mr. Turtle. His father's name was \"Ray\" and named him \"Ray-Ray\", that is why he would like to name his unborn child \"Ray-Ray-Ray\". In 'Midnight Bun', Joy gives birth to their daughter Ray Ray Ray Anne, after she acts as a surrogate for Liberty and Ray Ray due to Liberty wanting to have a wrestling career.\n\n===Billie Cunningham===\n[[File:Alyssa Milano.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Alyssa Milano]] in 2008. She played Billie Cunningham in the third season]]\n\nBillie Cunningham (played by [[Alyssa Milano]]) is a young woman who first appears in the season 3 episode \"Frank's Girl\". She had graduated from community college when she met [[#Frank Stump|Frank Stump]] and joined Frank in a life of crime, robbing stores and other places. During a [[conjugal visit]], Earl informs her that Frank got placed in [[solitary confinement]] again, which prompts her to break up with Frank, especially when she finds out he had shared with Earl a nude picture of her. Earl convinces Billie to give Frank a second chance, but learns that since Frank has been in prison, Billie has been getting her life back together and enrolled in nursing school. Not wanting her to be sabotaged by the relationship, Earl has Frank break up with her.\n\nIt was later revealed that Billie had gone back to her criminal ways, quitting nursing school, stealing her cousin's rent money and gas, and robbing a liquor store. She crashes into Earl with her car but then gets hit by a car herself when going for help. After some time in the hospital, Officer Stuart Daniels, who had hit her with the car, looks after her, telling her that she had killed Earl and needed to lay low at his place. While Earl is in a coma, he imagines Billie as his loving housewife in a television sitcom called ''The Hickeys''.

In the episode \"Creative Writing\", Earl remarks that a psychologist had called Randy [[Autism|\"borderline artistic\"]]. In the \"Inside Probe\" episodes, [[Geraldo Rivera]] describes him as the town [[wikt:simpleton|simpleton]] and reveals he has 77 misdemeanors like his brother.\n\n===Joy Turner===\n[[File:Jaime Pressly LF.JPG|thumb|120px|[[Jaime Pressly]] portrayed Joy Turner on the series]]\nJoy Farrah Turner ({{nee|Darville}}, also Joy Hickey)<!-- middle name as stated in episode 'Born a Gamblin' Man\" and \"inside probe\" --> (played by [[Jaime Pressly]]) is Earl's ex-wife who divorces him in the first episode and then marries his friend Darnell during the first season of the series. She is pessimistic, cold-hearted, stubborn and vain.  Joy is the mother of two boys, Dodge and Earl Jr. She drives a [[Subaru BRAT]] painted with the American flag.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mecum.com/lots/SC0510-92839/1985-subaru-brat-pickup/|title=1985 Subaru BRAT Pickup - W223 - Indianapolis 2010 - Mecum Auctions|author=|date=|website=Mecum Auctions|accessdate=August 3, 2017}}</ref><!-- coma episode they mentioned the BRAT by name and multiple episodes in season 4 --> Her [[catchphrase]]s are \"Oh, snap!\", \"What the hell\", and she frequently calls both Earl and Randy \"Dummy\". She is openly scornful of Earl's List, and has a strong dislike for Catalina, although she ends up saving her life in the fourth season.\n\nThe episodes \"The Bounty Hunter\" and \"Guess Who's Coming Out of Joy\" cover parts of Joy's past. When she was pregnant with her first child, she was kicked out of her parents' house in the neighboring town of Nathanville. She looked for a [[sugar daddy (slang term)|sugar daddy]], dating local celebrity [[#TV's Tim Stack|TV's Tim Stack]] briefly. She and her friends get Earl drunk, after which they have a [[shotgun wedding]] in Las Vegas and move into a trailer at the Pimmit Hills Trailer Park. She would often go along with Earl, Randy, Ralph, Donny and others on their crime sprees. She has an affair with Darnell but when she becomes pregnant with her second child, she convinces Earl that he is the father. Some years later, at the start of the series, she and Earl divorce, but after he signs the papers, he wins the lottery money.  Joy then tries some schemes to get her share, but eventually gives up. She then marries Darnell in the episode \"Joy's Wedding\". Although she is rather selfish and frugal, she cares deeply for her boys.\n\nIn the second season, Joy gets in trouble with the law when she was trying to return an entertainment system cabinet and ended up stealing a truck with a store employee in it. Her charges of grand theft auto, kidnapping, and assault would count as the [[Three-strikes law|third strike]], which would put her in prison for life. She is appointed a deaf lawyer ([[Marlee Matlin]]), who gets her involved with an [[addiction recovery group]] for her anger, and also prescribes happy pills. Hoping to evoke sympathy from the jury, Joy agrees to be a [[surrogate mother]] for her half-sister Liberty. The trial goes well until Earl's 911 calls are presented. However, Earl then confesses to all the crimes and takes the punishment.\n\nThe third season has Joy being pregnant while taking care of Randy until the latter becomes a guard at the prison that Earl is staying. She gives birth to the baby for Liberty and Ray Ray's family. Joy believed throughout the show that Little Chubby was the father of Dodge and Darnell was the father of Earl Jr. It is revealed in \"Dodges Dad\" that Earl is the biological father of Dodge, but Earl Jr.'s father is never named because of the shows cancellation.\n\n===Catalina {{anchor|Catalina Aruca}} ===\n<!-- per common name, use Catalina for the header -->\n[[File:Nadine Velazquez.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Nadine Velazquez]] portrayed Catalina Aruca on the series]]\nCatalina Rana Aruca{{efn-lr|Catalina's last name is mentioned multiple times in the season 3 \"Creative Writing\" episode.

Randy has a major crush on Catalina, immediately calling [[wikt:dibs|dibs]] on her when they first met. She was the top dancer at Club Chubby for about a month, where her routine simply consisted of jumping in place to [[House of Pain]]'s \"[[Jump Around]]\" song, until one of the patrons died, at which she vowed never to dance again. She dislikes Joy, but later returns to Club Chubby in the season 2 episode \"Jump for Joy\" when she sees how Earl tries hard to make things better. She also helps Earl on one of the items on his list in the episode \"Mailbox\". Season 2 features a story arc where Catalina is arrested for speeding and deported to her village. When Earl and Randy arrive, she gets news that Earl has agreed to marry her, but Earl lets Randy do it. In the \"Foreign Exchange Student\" episode, Randy and Catalina rent an apartment in order to [[green card marriage|keep up appearances]], but when Randy tells her he loves her, Catalina tells Earl she only wants to be friends with Randy. She takes actions to be as physically repulsive as possible when Randy and she consummate their marriage, but afterwards regrets it as she finds that Randy is the best lover she's had. In the season 3 episode \"Love Octagon\", she declares that she is a new lesbian, but her attempts to woo [[#Billie Cunningham|Billie Cunningham]] fail. However, she reconciles with her former boyfriend Paco who previously tried to catch her attention in the years past but finally caught her.\n\nCatalina was born in the small town of Guadalatucky,<ref name=\"probe1\" group=\"lower-alpha\"/> a Latin American village stricken with violence and poverty.<!-- inside probe episode -->  She was prompted by her lover [[#Paco|Paco]] to come to America.

She occasionally wires money to her family in the village. In the episode \"Kept a Guy Locked in a Truck\", it is revealed she lives in a shared laundry room at the motel.<!-- laundry room is from the motel as per season 3 coma episode, and later episodes have earl sharing the motel floor space -->.\n\nIn some episodes, Catalina breaks the [[fourth wall]] with her Spanish lines: In the episode \"[[My Name Is Earl (season 1)#ep11|Barn Burner]]\", she thanks the Latino audience for turning in every week;<ref name=\"episode1-11\" group=lower-alpha>{{cite episode | series=My Name is Earl | serieslink=My Name is Earl | title=Barn Burner | season=1 | number=11 | episodelink= My Name Is Earl (season 1)#ep11  | quote=Quiero agradecer al p\u00fablico latino que nos acompa\u00f1a cada semana.

He now acts as \"New Daddy\" to Joy's two sons.  He works in the local dive, \"The Crab Shack\". Whenever Earl greets Darnell, he calls him \"Crab Man\" (or \"Crabman\"), and he has a generally friendly disposition. In the episode \"[[Y2K (My Name Is Earl)|Y2K]]\", it is revealed that he used to go by the name Harry Monroe, until he was placed in a [[witness protection program]] where he was to assume his new identity of Darnell Turner and was told to avoid liking cheese (which he still likes). He has a pet tortoise whom he calls Mr. Turtle.\n\nPart of the season 4 episodes go into Darnell's history where he was raised and trained by his father Thomas Monroe (played by [[Danny Glover]]) in a secret government agency, and had developed the skills to be a top secret agent. However, when he refused to kill a nine-year-old leader of a socialist nation, and after testifying in court against his former employers, the government had to place him in witness protection from the agency. His cover is blown when he was shown on national television restraining Joy at a game show audition, so he, Joy, and their kids had to go under protection and assume other identities and live elsewhere. He agrees to join his father on one more mission, taking along Earl and sedating him multiple times, to free himself from having to need protection.\n\nIn the episode \"[[List of My Name Is Earl episodes|Our 'Cops' Is On]]\" it is shown that he used to live with his supposed grandmother and grew and sold marijuana in his bedroom. In \"Buried Treasure\", he narrates that he graduated from college at age 14, was a virtuoso cellist, and could identify 254 varieties of cheese.

So we named him [[Dodge]].\" His middle name is Chaz, named after Earl's childhood hero, astronaut Chaz Dalton. His biological father was the subject of several episodes: Frank was a possibility in \"[[The Frank Factor]]\", and in the season 4 finale \"Dodge's Dad\", Camden's biggest business owner Little Chubby was another possibility, but DNA tests later revealed Earl to be the biological father. It was revealed Joy hooked up with Earl at a Halloween party where he and Little Chubby wore the same costume in drunkenly had a one night stand.\n\n===Earl Hickey, Jr.===\nEarl Hickey, Jr. (played by Trey Carlisle) is Joy and Darnell's son.

Originally thought to be Darnell's child, a DNA test in the season 4 finale \"Dodge's Dad\" revealed that Darnell was not Earl Jr.'s father. Greg Garcia said that he and the writers had planned to make Earl Jr's dad someone famous, but because the show was cancelled, they never got a chance to figure it out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/watch_with_kristin/jason_lee_on_my_name_earl_movie_its_time/270861 |title=Jason Lee on My Name Is Earl Movie: \"It's Time!\" |publisher=E!

At one point he accidentally admits to the press that his wife the Governor has a sexual addiction and that they are also having problems in their marriage and having marriage counseling.

He began writing it in the summer of 1974, after his [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|comeback tour]] with [[The Band]]. Dylan recorded the song in September&nbsp;1974 and re-recorded it in December&nbsp;1974 along with some other from ''Blood on the Tracks''. Between the recordings, he often reworked the lyrics. A live version of the song was released on Dylan's 1976 album ''[[Hard Rain (Bob Dylan album)|Hard Rain]]'', and all of the studio outtakes from the September sessions were released on the deluxe edition of ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 14: More Blood, More Tracks]]'' in 2018. Some reviewers have speculated that the song is a reflection on Dylan's personal life, and in particular on his deteriorating relationship with his wife [[Sara Dylan]], whilst Dylan has denied that it is autobiographical.\n\n== Background and recording ==\nThe song was written, or at least begun, in the summer of 1974, after Dylan's [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|comeback tour]] with [[The Band]] that year and a separation from [[Sara Dylan]], who he had married in 1965. Dylan had moved to a farm in Minnesota with his brother, David Zimmerman, and there started to write the songs that were recorded for his album ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]''.<ref name=\"UNCUT\">{{cite web |url=https://www.uncut.co.uk/features/shelter-from-the-storm-the-inside-story-of-bob-dylan-s-blood-on-the-tracks-15656/ |title=Shelter From The Storm \u2013 the inside story of Bob Dylan's Blood on the Tracks |last=Hasted |first=Nick |date=15 November 2013 | orig-year=2005 | work=Uncut |access-date=6 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715011356/https://www.uncut.co.uk/features/shelter-from-the-storm-the-inside-story-of-bob-dylan-s-blood-on-the-tracks-15656 |archive-date=15 July 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1974, Dylan had taken art classes at [[Carnegie Hall]] and was influenced by his tutor [[Norman Raeben]].<ref name=\"UNCUT\" /><ref name=\"Rogovoy2009\">{{cite book|author=Seth Rogovoy|title=Bob Dylan: Prophet, Mystic, Poet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IdbgeObYgIkC&pg=PA160|date=24 November 2009|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4165-5983-2}}</ref>{{rp|160}} and, in particular, Raeben's view of [[time]].<ref name=\"GillOdegard2004\">{{cite book|author1=Andy Gill|author2=Kevin Odegard|title=A Simple Twist of Fate: Bob Dylan and the Making of Blood on the Tracks|url=https://archive.org/details/simpletwistoffat00gill|url-access=registration|date=January 2004|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-81231-6|page=148}}</ref> Dylan was later to say that \"Idiot Wind\" was \"a song I wanted to make as a painting\".<ref name=\"Flanagan2010\">{{cite book|author=Bill Flanagan|title=Written in My Soul: Conversations with Rock's Great Songwriters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BUAqAAAAQBAJ|date=1 April 2010|publisher=RosettaBooks|isbn=978-0-7953-1081-2|access-date=6 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506011534/https://books.google.com/books?id=BUAqAAAAQBAJ|archive-date=6 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> \"Idiot Wind\" was a derogatory phrase employed by Raeben and this may have inspired Dylan's use of it, although the term also appears in the poem ''June&nbsp;1940'' by [[Weldon Kees]] and that may have been the reference point.<ref name=\"Wilentz2011\">{{cite book|author=Sean Wilentz|title=Bob Dylan in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sb5UygkZlH0C&pg=PA140|date=15 February 2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4070-7411-5|}}{{rp|140-141}}</ref>\n\nDylan first recorded \"Idiot Wind\" in New York City on 16&nbsp;September 1974 during the initial ''Blood on the Tracks'' sessions at [[A & R Recording|A&R Studios]].
