An all-rounder who bats left-handed in the middle order and bowls [[slow left-arm orthodox]], Yuvraj is the son of former Indian fast bowler and Punjabi actor [[Yograj Singh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.sportskeeda.com/player/yuvraj-singh|title=Yuvraj Singh in Sportskeeda |work=Sportskeeda|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref> One of the greatest limited over players to play for India, Yuvraj was particularly noted for his aggressive stroke play of the ball and his fielding.\n\nYuvraj was a member of the Indian cricket team in One Day Internationals (ODIs) between 2000 and 2017 and played his first Test match in October 2003. He was the vice-captain of the Indian ODI team between 2007 and 2008. He was the Man of the Tournament in the [[2011 ICC Cricket World Cup]], and one of the top performers at the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20|2007 ICC World T20]], both of which India won. In a match against [[England cricket team|England]] at the 2007 World T20, he famously hit six [[Boundary (cricket)|sixes]] in one over bowled by [[Stuart Broad]] \u2014 a feat performed only three times previously in any form of senior cricket, and never in an international match between two teams with [[Test cricket|Test match status]]. In the same match, he set the record for the fastest fifty in Twenty20 Internationals and in all T20 cricket, reaching 50 runs in 12 balls. During the 2011 World Cup, he became the first player to take a 5-wicket haul and score a 50 in the same [[Cricket World Cup|World Cup]] match.\n\nIn 2011, Yuvraj was diagnosed with a [[cancerous]] [[tumor]] in his left lung and underwent [[chemotherapy]] treatment in Boston and Indianapolis.<ref name=\"indianexpress.com\">{{citation|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/tumour-cancerous-yuvi-undergoes-chemo/908423/|title=\"Tumour Cancerous, Yuvi Undergoes Chemo\" \u2013 Indian Express.}}</ref> In March 2012, he was discharged from the hospital after completing the third and final cycle of chemotherapy and returned to India in April. He made his international comeback in a Twenty20 match in September against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] shortly before the [[2012 ICC World Twenty20|2012 World Twenty20]].\n\nIn 2012, Yuvraj was conferred with the [[Arjuna Award]], India's second highest sporting award by the [[Government of India]]. In 2014, he was awarded the [[Padma Shri]], India's fourth highest civilian honour. At the 2014 [[Indian Premier League|IPL]] auction [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]] bought Yuvraj for an all-time high price of {{INR}}14 [[crore]] and, in 2015, the [[Delhi Daredevils]] bought him for {{INR}}16 crore making him the most expensive player ever to be sold in the IPL.\n\nOn 10 June 2019, Yuvraj announced his retirement from all forms of International cricket.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/108416/yuvraj-singh-announces-retirement-from-international-cricket|title=Yuvraj Singh announces retirement from all forms of cricket |work=Cricbuzz |accessdate=10 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/yuvraj-singh-retires-indian-cricket-team-world-cup-2011-hero-cancer-battle-1545861-2019-06-10|title=Yuvraj Singh, hero of India's 2011 World Cup triumph, retires from international cricket |work=India Today |accessdate=10 June 2019}}</ref> He last represented India in June 2017, [[Indian cricket team in the West Indies in 2017|against the West Indies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/26939331/i-decided-move-yuvraj-singh-announces-international-ipl-retirement |title='I have decided to move on' yuvraj has been retired from international cricket on 10th June 2019 probably a sad day for his fans- Yuvraj Singh announces international, IPL retirement |work=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=10 June 2019|date=10 June 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==Early years and personal life==\nSingh was born in a [[Punjabis|Punjabi]] [[Sikh]] family to [[Yograj Singh]], a former India cricketer, and Shabnam Singh.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/news/item/188217-my-son-has-come-back-as-a-winner-says-yuvraj-singhs-father |title=My son has come back as a winner, says Yuvraj Singh's father |publisher=NDTV.com |date=6 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626064524/http://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/news/item/188217-my-son-has-come-back-as-a-winner-says-yuvraj-singhs-father|archive-date=26 June 2012|accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Dani |first1=Bipin |title=Yuvraj Singh's father not pleased with Hazel Keech's reported name change |url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/sports/cricket/141216/yuvraj-singhs-father-not-pleased-with-hazel-keechs-reported-name-change.html |accessdate=9 March 2020 |work=Deccan Chronicle |date=14 December 2016 |language=en}}</ref> [[Tennis]] and [[roller skating]] were Yuvraj's favourite sports during his childhood and he was quite good at both.

An all-rounder who bats left-handed in the middle order and bowls [[slow left-arm orthodox]], Yuvraj is the son of former Indian fast bowler and Punjabi actor [[Yograj Singh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.sportskeeda.com/player/yuvraj-singh|title=Yuvraj Singh in Sportskeeda |work=Sportskeeda|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref> One of the greatest limited over players to play for India, Yuvraj was particularly noted for his aggressive stroke play of the ball and his fielding.\n\nYuvraj was a member of the Indian cricket team in One Day Internationals (ODIs) between 2000 and 2017 and played his first Test match in October 2003. He was the vice-captain of the Indian ODI team between 2007 and 2008. He was the Man of the Tournament in the [[2011 ICC Cricket World Cup]], and one of the top performers at the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20|2007 ICC World T20]], both of which India won. In a match against [[England cricket team|England]] at the 2007 World T20, he famously hit six [[Boundary (cricket)|sixes]] in one over bowled by [[Stuart Broad]] \u2014 a feat performed only three times previously in any form of senior cricket, and never in an international match between two teams with [[Test cricket|Test match status]]. In the same match, he set the record for the fastest fifty in Twenty20 Internationals and in all T20 cricket, reaching 50 runs in 12 balls. During the 2011 World Cup, he became the first player to take a 5-wicket haul and score a 50 in the same [[Cricket World Cup|World Cup]] match.\n\nIn 2011, Yuvraj was diagnosed with a [[cancerous]] [[tumor]] in his left lung and underwent [[chemotherapy]] treatment in Boston and Indianapolis.<ref name=\"indianexpress.com\">{{citation|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/tumour-cancerous-yuvi-undergoes-chemo/908423/|title=\"Tumour Cancerous, Yuvi Undergoes Chemo\" \u2013 Indian Express.}}</ref> In March 2012, he was discharged from the hospital after completing the third and final cycle of chemotherapy and returned to India in April. He made his international comeback in a Twenty20 match in September against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] shortly before the [[2012 ICC World Twenty20|2012 World Twenty20]].\n\nIn 2012, Yuvraj was conferred with the [[Arjuna Award]], India's second highest sporting award by the [[Government of India]]. In 2014, he was awarded the [[Padma Shri]], India's fourth highest civilian honour. At the 2014 [[Indian Premier League|IPL]] auction [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]] bought Yuvraj for an all-time high price of {{INR}}14 [[crore]] and, in 2015, the [[Delhi Daredevils]] bought him for {{INR}}16 crore making him the most expensive player ever to be sold in the IPL.\n\nOn 10 June 2019, Yuvraj announced his retirement from all forms of International cricket.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/108416/yuvraj-singh-announces-retirement-from-international-cricket|title=Yuvraj Singh announces retirement from all forms of cricket |work=Cricbuzz |accessdate=10 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/yuvraj-singh-retires-indian-cricket-team-world-cup-2011-hero-cancer-battle-1545861-2019-06-10|title=Yuvraj Singh, hero of India's 2011 World Cup triumph, retires from international cricket |work=India Today |accessdate=10 June 2019}}</ref> He last represented India in June 2017, [[Indian cricket team in the West Indies in 2017|against the West Indies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/26939331/i-decided-move-yuvraj-singh-announces-international-ipl-retirement |title='I have decided to move on' yuvraj has been retired from international cricket on 10th June 2019 probably a sad day for his fans- Yuvraj Singh announces international, IPL retirement |work=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=10 June 2019|date=10 June 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==Early years and personal life==\nSingh was born in a [[Punjabis|Punjabi]] [[Sikh]] family to [[Yograj Singh]], a former India cricketer, and Shabnam Singh.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/news/item/188217-my-son-has-come-back-as-a-winner-says-yuvraj-singhs-father |title=My son has come back as a winner, says Yuvraj Singh's father |publisher=NDTV.com |date=6 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626064524/http://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/news/item/188217-my-son-has-come-back-as-a-winner-says-yuvraj-singhs-father|archive-date=26 June 2012|accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Dani |first1=Bipin |title=Yuvraj Singh's father not pleased with Hazel Keech's reported name change |url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/sports/cricket/141216/yuvraj-singhs-father-not-pleased-with-hazel-keechs-reported-name-change.html |accessdate=9 March 2020 |work=Deccan Chronicle |date=14 December 2016 |language=en}}</ref> [[Tennis]] and [[roller skating]] were Yuvraj's favourite sports during his childhood and he was quite good at both.

A [[Cricinfo]] report published in late 2005 showed that since 1999, he was the fourth most prolific fielder in affecting [[One Day International|ODI]] [[run out]]s, and of those on the list of prolific fielders, he had the second highest rate of effecting a run out.<ref>{{cite web| title = Statistics \u2013 Run outs in ODIs | last = Basevi| first = Trevor| url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/224487.html| date= 8 November 2005| access-date =5 February 2007| publisher= [[Cricinfo]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Yuvraj speaks highly of Sourav's support| url= http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/105607.html| publisher=[[Cricinfo]]| date = 28 March 2001| accessdate =5 February 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Achievements and honours==\n\n*In a [[2007 ICC World Twenty20]] match, he hit six [[Six (cricket)|sixes]] in a single over.\n*He holds the record for fastest T20 fifty by scoring it in 12 balls against [[England national cricket team]] during the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20]]\n*He became the first all-rounder to score 300 plus runs and to take 15 wickets in a single World Cup.\n*He was the Man of the Tournament in the [[ICC Cricket World Cup 2011]].\n*He was awarded with the [[Arjuna Award]] (India's second highest, Sporting Award) in 2012 by the President of India.\n*In 2014, he was awarded with the [[Padma Shri Award]].\n*In February 2014, he was honoured with [[FICCI]] Most Inspiring Sportsperson of the Year Award.<ref>{{cite web|title=FICCI announces the Winners of India Sports Awards for 2014|url=http://news.biharprabha.com/2014/02/ficci-announces-the-winners-of-india-sports-awards-for-2014/|work=IANS|date=13 February 2014|publisher=news.biharprabha.com|accessdate=14 February 2014}}</ref>\n*In August 2018 Power Brands awarded Yuvraj Singh the Bharatiya Manavata Vikas Puraskar for being an impact player on the field and off it, for demonstrating humility in greatness and for leading the charge in the battle against cancer, reinforcing the belief that together,  YUWECAN!<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.centralchronicle.com/daily-india-media-recognizes-13-indian-stalwarts-with-bharatiya-manavata-vikas-puraskar-2018.html|title=Daily India media recognizes 13 Indian stalwarts with Bharatiya Manavata Vikas Puraskar 2018|date=5 September 2018|website=Central Chronicle - Central India's Premier English Daily|language=en-US|access-date=16 May 2019}}\n</ref>\n\n==Outside cricket==\n\n===Charity and commercial interests===\n[[File:Yuvraj-Singh.jpg|thumb|right|Singh shooting for [[Ulysse Nardin]] watches as Ambassador]]\nYuvraj was signed by [[Microsoft]] to be a brand ambassador for the [[Xbox 360]] video game console when it was launched in India in 2006.
