For example, suppose we are evaluating the effect of a medical treatment, and we enroll 100&nbsp;subjects into our study, then randomly assign 50&nbsp;subjects to the treatment group and 50&nbsp;subjects to the control group. In this case, we have two independent samples and would use the unpaired form of the ''t''-test.\n\n===Paired samples===\n{{Main|Paired difference test}}\n\nPaired samples ''t''-tests typically consist of a sample of matched pairs of similar [[unit (statistics)|units]], or one group of units that has been tested twice (a \"repeated measures\" ''t''-test).\n\nA typical example of the repeated measures ''t''-test would be where subjects are tested prior to a treatment, say for high blood pressure, and the same subjects are tested again after treatment with a blood-pressure-lowering medication. By comparing the same patient's numbers before and after treatment, we are effectively using each patient as their own control. That way the correct rejection of the null hypothesis (here: of no difference made by the treatment) can become much more likely, with statistical power increasing simply because the random interpatient variation has now been eliminated. However, an increase of statistical power comes at a price: more tests are required, each subject having to be tested twice. Because half of the sample now depends on the other half, the paired version of Student's ''t''-test has only {{math|{{sfrac|''n''|2}} \u2212 1}} degrees of freedom (with {{math|''n''}} being the total number of observations).{{citation needed|reason=many references says n-1, like http://www.statsdirect.com/help/Default.htm#parametric_methods/paired_t.htm|date=February 2016}} Pairs become individual test units, and the sample has to be doubled to achieve the same number of degrees of freedom. Normally, there are {{math|''n'' \u2212 1}} degrees of freedom (with {{math|''n''}} being the total number of observations).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Weisstein|first1=Eric|title=Student's t-Distribution|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Studentst-Distribution.html|website=mathworld.wolfram.com}}</ref>\n\nA paired samples ''t''-test based on a \"matched-pairs sample\" results from an unpaired sample that is subsequently used to form a paired sample, by using additional variables that were measured along with the variable of interest.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=David |first1=H.&nbsp;A. |last2=Gunnink |first2=Jason L. |year=1997 |title=The Paired ''t'' Test Under Artificial Pairing |journal=The American Statistician |volume=51 |pages=9\u201312 |jstor=2684684 |doi=10.2307/2684684 |issue=1}}</ref> The matching is carried out by identifying pairs of values consisting of one observation from each of the two samples, where the pair is similar in terms of other measured variables. This approach is sometimes used in observational studies to reduce or eliminate the effects of confounding factors.\n\nPaired samples ''t''-tests are often referred to as \"dependent samples ''t''-tests\".\n\n==Calculations==\nExplicit expressions that can be used to carry out various ''t''-tests are given below.  In each case, the formula for a test statistic that either exactly follows or closely approximates a ''t''-distribution under the null hypothesis is given.  Also, the appropriate [[degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] are given in each case.  Each of these statistics can be used to carry out either a [[One-tailed test|one-tailed or two-tailed test]].\n\nOnce the ''t'' value and degrees of freedom are determined, a [[p-value|''p''-value]] can be found using a [[Student's t-distribution#Table of selected values|table of values from Student's ''t''-distribution]].  If the calculated ''p''-value is below the threshold chosen for [[statistical significance]] (usually the 0.10, the 0.05, or 0.01 level), then the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n\n===One-sample ''t''-test===\nIn testing the null hypothesis that the population mean is equal to a specified value {{math|''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>}}, one uses the statistic\n\n:<math> t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_0}{s/\\sqrt{n}} </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\bar x</math> is the sample mean, {{math|''s''}} is the [[Standard deviation#Estimation|sample standard deviation]] and {{math|''n''}} is the sample size. The degrees of freedom used in this test are {{math|''n'' \u2212 1}}. \nAlthough the parent population does not need to be normally distributed, the distribution of the population of sample means <math>\\bar x</math> is assumed to be normal.\n\nBy the [[central limit theorem]], if the observations are independent and the second moment exists, then <math>t</math> will be approximately normal N(0;1).\n\n===Slope of a regression line===\nSuppose one is fitting the model\n\n: <math> Y = \\alpha + \\beta x + \\varepsilon </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''x''}} is known, {{math|''\u03b1''}} and {{math|''\u03b2''}} are unknown, {{math|''\u03b5''}} is a normally distributed random variable with mean 0 and unknown variance {{math|''\u03c3''<sup>2</sup>}}, and {{math|''Y''}} is the outcome of interest. We want to test the null hypothesis that the slope {{math|''\u03b2''}} is equal to some specified value {{math|''\u03b2''<sub>0</sub>}} (often taken to be 0, in which case the null hypothesis is that {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} are uncorrelated).\n\nLet\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\widehat\\alpha, \\widehat\\beta & = \\text{least-squares estimators}, \\\\\nSE_{\\widehat\\alpha}, SE_{\\widehat\\beta} & = \\text{the standard errors of least-squares estimators}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThen\n\n:<math>\nt_\\text{score} = \\frac{\\widehat\\beta - \\beta_0}{ SE_{\\widehat\\beta} }\\sim\\mathcal{T}_{n-2}\n</math>\n\nhas a ''t''-distribution with {{math|''n'' \u2212 2}} degrees of freedom if the null hypothesis is true.

The denominator of {{math|''t''}} is the [[Standard error (statistics)|standard error]] of the difference between two means.\n\nFor significance testing, the [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] for this test is {{math|2''n'' \u2212 2}} where {{math|''n''}} is the number of participants in each group.\n\n====Equal or unequal sample sizes, similar variances ( <math>\\frac{1}{2}</math> < <math>\\frac{s_{X_1}}{s_{X_2}}</math> < 2)====\nThis test is used only when it can be assumed that the two distributions have the same variance. (When this assumption is violated, see below.) \nThe previous formulae are a special case of the formulae below, one recovers them when both samples are equal in size: {{math|1=''n'' = ''n''<sub>1</sub> = ''n''<sub>2</sub>}}.\n\nThe {{math|''t''}} statistic to test whether the means are different can be calculated as follows:\n:<math>t = \\frac{\\bar {X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2}{s_p \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1}+\\frac{1}{n_2}}}</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math> s_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\left(n_1-1\\right)s_{X_1}^2+\\left(n_2-1\\right)s_{X_2}^2}{n_1+n_2-2}}</math>\n\nis an estimator of the [[pooled standard deviation]] of the two samples: it is defined in this way so that its square is an [[unbiased estimator]] of the common variance whether or not the population means are the same. In these formulae, {{math|''n<sub>i</sub>'' \u2212 1}} is the number of degrees of freedom for each group, and the total sample size minus two (that is, {{math|''n''<sub>1</sub> + ''n''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 2}}) is the total number of degrees of freedom, which is used in significance testing.\n\n==== Equal or unequal sample sizes, unequal variances ( <math>s_{X_1} > 2s_{X_2}</math> or <math>s_{X_2} > 2s_{X_1}</math>) ====\n{{main|Welch's t test{{!}}Welch's t-test}}\nThis test, also known as Welch's ''t''-test, is used only when the two population variances are not assumed to be equal (the two sample sizes may or may not be equal) and hence must be estimated separately. The {{math|''t''}} statistic to test whether the population means are different is calculated as:\n\n:<math>t = \\frac{\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2}{s_{\\bar\\Delta}}</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>s_{\\bar\\Delta} = \\sqrt{\\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}.\n</math>\n\nHere {{math|''s<sub>i</sub>''<sup>2</sup>}} is the [[unbiased estimator]] of the [[variance]] of each of the two samples with {{math|''n<sub>i</sub>''}} = number of participants in group {{math|''i''}} (1 or 2). In this case {{math|''s''{{su|p=2|b={{overline|\u0394}}}}}} is not a pooled variance. For use in significance testing, the distribution of the test statistic is approximated as an ordinary Student's ''t''-distribution with the degrees of freedom calculated using\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{d.f.} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}\\right)^2}{\\frac{\\left(s_1^2/n_1\\right)^2}{n_1-1} + \\frac{\\left(s_2^2/n_2\\right)^2}{n_2-1}}.\n</math>\n\nThis is known as the [[Welch\u2013Satterthwaite equation]]. The true distribution of the test statistic actually depends (slightly) on the two unknown population variances (see [[Behrens\u2013Fisher problem]]).\n\n===Dependent ''t''-test for paired samples===\nThis test is used when the samples are dependent; that is, when there is only one sample that has been tested twice (repeated measures) or when there are two samples that have been matched or \"paired\". This is an example of a [[paired difference test]]. The ''t'' statistic is calculated as\n\n:<math>t = \\frac{\\bar{X}_D - \\mu_0}{s_D/\\sqrt n} </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\bar{X}_D</math> and <math>s_D</math> are the average and standard deviation of the differences between all pairs. The pairs are e.g. either one person's pre-test and post-test scores or between-pairs of persons matched into meaningful groups (for instance drawn from the same family or age group: see table). The constant {{math|''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>}} is zero if we want to test whether the average of the difference is significantly different. The degree of freedom used is {{math|''n'' \u2212 1}}, where {{math|''n''}} represents the number of pairs.\n\n:{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" align=\"right\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Example of repeated measures\n|-\n!

([[Welch's t-test|Welch's ''t''-test]] is a nearly exact test for the case where the data are normal but the variances may differ.)

It will also have power in detecting an alternative by which group B has the same distribution as A but after some shift by a constant (in which case there would indeed be a difference in the means of the two groups). However, there could be cases where group A and B will have different distributions but with the same means (such as two distributions, one with positive skewness and the other with a negative one, but shifted so to have the same means). In such cases, MW could have more than alpha level power in rejecting the Null hypothesis but attributing the interpretation of difference in means to such a result would be incorrect.\n\nIn the presence of an [[outlier]], the t-test is not robust.

For instance, a researcher might submit a number of subjects to a personality test consisting of multiple personality scales (e.g. the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]]). Because measures of this type are usually positively correlated, it is not advisable to conduct separate univariate ''t''-tests to test hypotheses, as these would neglect the covariance among measures and inflate the chance of falsely rejecting at least one hypothesis ([[Type I error]]). In this case a single multivariate test is preferable for hypothesis testing. [[Fisher's Method#Limitations of independent assumption|Fisher's Method]] for combining multiple tests with ''[[Type I and type II errors#Type I error|alpha]]'' reduced for positive correlation among tests is one. Another is Hotelling's ''T''{{isup|2}} statistic follows a ''T''{{isup|2}} distribution. However, in practice the distribution is rarely used, since tabulated values for ''T''{{isup|2}} are hard to find. Usually, ''T''{{isup|2}} is converted instead to an ''F'' statistic.\n\nFor a one-sample multivariate test, the hypothesis is that the mean vector ({{math|'''\u03bc'''}}) is equal to a given vector ({{math|'''\u03bc'''<sub>0</sub>}}). The test statistic is [[Hotelling's t-squared statistic|Hotelling's ''t''{{isup|2}}]]:\n\n:<math>\nt^2=n(\\bar{\\mathbf x}-{\\boldsymbol\\mu_0})'{\\mathbf S}^{-1}(\\bar{\\mathbf x}-{\\boldsymbol\\mu_0})\n</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''n''}} is the sample size, {{math|{{overline|'''x'''}}}} is the vector of column means and {{math|'''S'''}} is an {{math|''m'' \u00d7 ''m''}} [[sample covariance matrix]].\n\nFor a two-sample multivariate test, the hypothesis is that the mean vectors ({{math|'''\u03bc'''<sub>1</sub>, '''\u03bc'''<sub>2</sub>}}) of two samples are equal. The test statistic is [[Hotelling's two-sample t-squared statistic|Hotelling's two-sample ''t''{{isup|2}}]]:\n\n:<math>t^2 = \\frac{n_1 n_2}{n_1+n_2}\\left(\\bar{\\mathbf x}_1-\\bar{\\mathbf x}_2\\right)'{\\mathbf S_\\text{pooled}}^{-1}\\left(\\bar{\\mathbf x}_1-\\bar{\\mathbf x}_2\\right).</math>\n\n==Software implementations==\nMany [[spreadsheet]] programs and statistics packages, such as [[QtiPlot]], [[LibreOffice Calc]], [[Microsoft Excel]], [[SAS (software)|SAS]], [[SPSS]], [[Stata]], [[DAP (software)|DAP]], [[gretl]], [[R (programming language)|R]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[PSPP]], [[Matlab]] and [[Minitab]], include implementations of Student's ''t''-test.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

For example, suppose we are evaluating the effect of a medical treatment, and we enroll 100&nbsp;subjects into our study, then randomly assign 50&nbsp;subjects to the treatment group and 50&nbsp;subjects to the control group. In this case, we have two independent samples and would use the unpaired form of the ''t''-test.\n\n===Paired samples===\n{{Main|Paired difference test}}\n\nPaired samples ''t''-tests typically consist of a sample of matched pairs of similar [[unit (statistics)|units]], or one group of units that has been tested twice (a \"repeated measures\" ''t''-test).\n\nA typical example of the repeated measures ''t''-test would be where subjects are tested prior to a treatment, say for high blood pressure, and the same subjects are tested again after treatment with a blood-pressure-lowering medication. By comparing the same patient's numbers before and after treatment, we are effectively using each patient as their own control. That way the correct rejection of the null hypothesis (here: of no difference made by the treatment) can become much more likely, with statistical power increasing simply because the random interpatient variation has now been eliminated. However, an increase of statistical power comes at a price: more tests are required, each subject having to be tested twice. Because half of the sample now depends on the other half, the paired version of Student's ''t''-test has only {{math|{{sfrac|''n''|2}} \u2212 1}} degrees of freedom (with {{math|''n''}} being the total number of observations).{{citation needed|reason=many references says n-1, like http://www.statsdirect.com/help/Default.htm#parametric_methods/paired_t.htm|date=February 2016}} Pairs become individual test units, and the sample has to be doubled to achieve the same number of degrees of freedom. Normally, there are {{math|''n'' \u2212 1}} degrees of freedom (with {{math|''n''}} being the total number of observations).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Weisstein|first1=Eric|title=Student's t-Distribution|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Studentst-Distribution.html|website=mathworld.wolfram.com}}</ref>\n\nA paired samples ''t''-test based on a \"matched-pairs sample\" results from an unpaired sample that is subsequently used to form a paired sample, by using additional variables that were measured along with the variable of interest.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=David |first1=H.&nbsp;A. |last2=Gunnink |first2=Jason L. |year=1997 |title=The Paired ''t'' Test Under Artificial Pairing |journal=The American Statistician |volume=51 |pages=9\u201312 |jstor=2684684 |doi=10.2307/2684684 |issue=1}}</ref> The matching is carried out by identifying pairs of values consisting of one observation from each of the two samples, where the pair is similar in terms of other measured variables. This approach is sometimes used in observational studies to reduce or eliminate the effects of confounding factors.\n\nPaired samples ''t''-tests are often referred to as \"dependent samples ''t''-tests\".\n\n==Calculations==\nExplicit expressions that can be used to carry out various ''t''-tests are given below.  In each case, the formula for a test statistic that either exactly follows or closely approximates a ''t''-distribution under the null hypothesis is given.  Also, the appropriate [[degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] are given in each case.  Each of these statistics can be used to carry out either a [[One-tailed test|one-tailed or two-tailed test]].\n\nOnce the ''t'' value and degrees of freedom are determined, a [[p-value|''p''-value]] can be found using a [[Student's t-distribution#Table of selected values|table of values from Student's ''t''-distribution]].  If the calculated ''p''-value is below the threshold chosen for [[statistical significance]] (usually the 0.10, the 0.05, or 0.01 level), then the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n\n===One-sample ''t''-test===\nIn testing the null hypothesis that the population mean is equal to a specified value {{math|''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>}}, one uses the statistic\n\n:<math> t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_0}{s/\\sqrt{n}} </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\bar x</math> is the sample mean, {{math|''s''}} is the [[Standard deviation#Estimation|sample standard deviation]] and {{math|''n''}} is the sample size. The degrees of freedom used in this test are {{math|''n'' \u2212 1}}. \nAlthough the parent population does not need to be normally distributed, the distribution of the population of sample means <math>\\bar x</math> is assumed to be normal.\n\nBy the [[central limit theorem]], if the observations are independent and the second moment exists, then <math>t</math> will be approximately normal N(0;1).\n\n===Slope of a regression line===\nSuppose one is fitting the model\n\n: <math> Y = \\alpha + \\beta x + \\varepsilon </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''x''}} is known, {{math|''\u03b1''}} and {{math|''\u03b2''}} are unknown, {{math|''\u03b5''}} is a normally distributed random variable with mean 0 and unknown variance {{math|''\u03c3''<sup>2</sup>}}, and {{math|''Y''}} is the outcome of interest. We want to test the null hypothesis that the slope {{math|''\u03b2''}} is equal to some specified value {{math|''\u03b2''<sub>0</sub>}} (often taken to be 0, in which case the null hypothesis is that {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} are uncorrelated).\n\nLet\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\widehat\\alpha, \\widehat\\beta & = \\text{least-squares estimators}, \\\\\nSE_{\\widehat\\alpha}, SE_{\\widehat\\beta} & = \\text{the standard errors of least-squares estimators}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThen\n\n:<math>\nt_\\text{score} = \\frac{\\widehat\\beta - \\beta_0}{ SE_{\\widehat\\beta} }\\sim\\mathcal{T}_{n-2}\n</math>\n\nhas a ''t''-distribution with {{math|''n'' \u2212 2}} degrees of freedom if the null hypothesis is true.

(When this assumption is violated, see below.) \nThe previous formulae are a special case of the formulae below, one recovers them when both samples are equal in size: {{math|1=''n'' = ''n''<sub>1</sub> = ''n''<sub>2</sub>}}.\n\nThe {{math|''t''}} statistic to test whether the means are different can be calculated as follows:\n:<math>t = \\frac{\\bar {X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2}{s_p \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1}+\\frac{1}{n_2}}}</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math> s_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\left(n_1-1\\right)s_{X_1}^2+\\left(n_2-1\\right)s_{X_2}^2}{n_1+n_2-2}}</math>\n\nis an estimator of the [[pooled standard deviation]] of the two samples: it is defined in this way so that its square is an [[unbiased estimator]] of the common variance whether or not the population means are the same. In these formulae, {{math|''n<sub>i</sub>'' \u2212 1}} is the number of degrees of freedom for each group, and the total sample size minus two (that is, {{math|''n''<sub>1</sub> + ''n''<sub>2</sub> \u2212 2}}) is the total number of degrees of freedom, which is used in significance testing.\n\n==== Equal or unequal sample sizes, unequal variances ( <math>s_{X_1} > 2s_{X_2}</math> or <math>s_{X_2} > 2s_{X_1}</math>) ====\n{{main|Welch's t test{{!}}Welch's t-test}}\nThis test, also known as Welch's ''t''-test, is used only when the two population variances are not assumed to be equal (the two sample sizes may or may not be equal) and hence must be estimated separately. The {{math|''t''}} statistic to test whether the population means are different is calculated as:\n\n:<math>t = \\frac{\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2}{s_{\\bar\\Delta}}</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>s_{\\bar\\Delta} = \\sqrt{\\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}.\n</math>\n\nHere {{math|''s<sub>i</sub>''<sup>2</sup>}} is the [[unbiased estimator]] of the [[variance]] of each of the two samples with {{math|''n<sub>i</sub>''}} = number of participants in group {{math|''i''}} (1 or 2). In this case {{math|''s''{{su|p=2|b={{overline|\u0394}}}}}} is not a pooled variance. For use in significance testing, the distribution of the test statistic is approximated as an ordinary Student's ''t''-distribution with the degrees of freedom calculated using\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{d.f.} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}\\right)^2}{\\frac{\\left(s_1^2/n_1\\right)^2}{n_1-1} + \\frac{\\left(s_2^2/n_2\\right)^2}{n_2-1}}.\n</math>\n\nThis is known as the [[Welch\u2013Satterthwaite equation]]. The true distribution of the test statistic actually depends (slightly) on the two unknown population variances (see [[Behrens\u2013Fisher problem]]).\n\n===Dependent ''t''-test for paired samples===\nThis test is used when the samples are dependent; that is, when there is only one sample that has been tested twice (repeated measures) or when there are two samples that have been matched or \"paired\". This is an example of a [[paired difference test]]. The ''t'' statistic is calculated as\n\n:<math>t = \\frac{\\bar{X}_D - \\mu_0}{s_D/\\sqrt n} </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\bar{X}_D</math> and <math>s_D</math> are the average and standard deviation of the differences between all pairs. The pairs are e.g. either one person's pre-test and post-test scores or between-pairs of persons matched into meaningful groups (for instance drawn from the same family or age group: see table). The constant {{math|''\u03bc''<sub>0</sub>}} is zero if we want to test whether the average of the difference is significantly different. The degree of freedom used is {{math|''n'' \u2212 1}}, where {{math|''n''}} represents the number of pairs.\n\n:{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" align=\"right\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Example of repeated measures\n|-\n!

([[Welch's t-test|Welch's ''t''-test]] is a nearly exact test for the case where the data are normal but the variances may differ.)

It will also have power in detecting an alternative by which group B has the same distribution as A but after some shift by a constant (in which case there would indeed be a difference in the means of the two groups). However, there could be cases where group A and B will have different distributions but with the same means (such as two distributions, one with positive skewness and the other with a negative one, but shifted so to have the same means). In such cases, MW could have more than alpha level power in rejecting the Null hypothesis but attributing the interpretation of difference in means to such a result would be incorrect.\n\nIn the presence of an [[outlier]], the t-test is not robust. For example, for two independent samples when the data distributions are asymmetric  (that is, the distributions are [[skewness|skewed]]) or the distributions have large tails, then the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (also known as the [[Mann\u2013Whitney U test|Mann\u2013Whitney ''U'' test]]) can have three to four times higher power than the ''t''-test.<ref name=\"Sawilowsky-Blair\"/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blair |first1=R.

For instance, a researcher might submit a number of subjects to a personality test consisting of multiple personality scales (e.g. the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]]). Because measures of this type are usually positively correlated, it is not advisable to conduct separate univariate ''t''-tests to test hypotheses, as these would neglect the covariance among measures and inflate the chance of falsely rejecting at least one hypothesis ([[Type I error]]). In this case a single multivariate test is preferable for hypothesis testing. [[Fisher's Method#Limitations of independent assumption|Fisher's Method]] for combining multiple tests with ''[[Type I and type II errors#Type I error|alpha]]'' reduced for positive correlation among tests is one. Another is Hotelling's ''T''{{isup|2}} statistic follows a ''T''{{isup|2}} distribution. However, in practice the distribution is rarely used, since tabulated values for ''T''{{isup|2}} are hard to find. Usually, ''T''{{isup|2}} is converted instead to an ''F'' statistic.\n\nFor a one-sample multivariate test, the hypothesis is that the mean vector ({{math|'''\u03bc'''}}) is equal to a given vector ({{math|'''\u03bc'''<sub>0</sub>}}). The test statistic is [[Hotelling's t-squared statistic|Hotelling's ''t''{{isup|2}}]]:\n\n:<math>\nt^2=n(\\bar{\\mathbf x}-{\\boldsymbol\\mu_0})'{\\mathbf S}^{-1}(\\bar{\\mathbf x}-{\\boldsymbol\\mu_0})\n</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''n''}} is the sample size, {{math|{{overline|'''x'''}}}} is the vector of column means and {{math|'''S'''}} is an {{math|''m'' \u00d7 ''m''}} [[sample covariance matrix]].\n\nFor a two-sample multivariate test, the hypothesis is that the mean vectors ({{math|'''\u03bc'''<sub>1</sub>, '''\u03bc'''<sub>2</sub>}}) of two samples are equal. The test statistic is [[Hotelling's two-sample t-squared statistic|Hotelling's two-sample ''t''{{isup|2}}]]:\n\n:<math>t^2 = \\frac{n_1 n_2}{n_1+n_2}\\left(\\bar{\\mathbf x}_1-\\bar{\\mathbf x}_2\\right)'{\\mathbf S_\\text{pooled}}^{-1}\\left(\\bar{\\mathbf x}_1-\\bar{\\mathbf x}_2\\right).</math>\n\n==Software implementations==\nMany [[spreadsheet]] programs and statistics packages, such as [[QtiPlot]], [[LibreOffice Calc]], [[Microsoft Excel]], [[SAS (software)|SAS]], [[SPSS]], [[Stata]], [[DAP (software)|DAP]], [[gretl]], [[R (programming language)|R]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[PSPP]], [[Matlab]] and [[Minitab]], include implementations of Student's ''t''-test.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The northern and southern parts of the original province separated in 1729. Originally settled by small farmers, sometimes having a few slaves, who were oriented toward subsistence agriculture, the colony lacked cities or towns. [[Piracy|Pirates]] menaced the coastal settlements, but by 1718 the pirates had been captured and killed. Growth was strong in the middle of the 18th century, as the economy attracted [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]], [[Quaker]], [[English American|English]] and [[German American|German]] [[immigrants]]. A majority of the colonists generally supported the [[American Revolution]], and a smaller number of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] than in some other colonies such as Georgia, South Carolina, Delaware, New York.\n\nDuring colonial times, [[Edenton, North Carolina|Edenton]] served as the state capital beginning in 1722, and [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]] was selected as the capital in 1766. Construction of [[Governor's Palace, New Bern|Tryon Palace]], which served as the residence and offices of the provincial governor [[William Tryon]], began in 1767 and was completed in 1771. In 1788 [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] was chosen as the site of the new capital, as its central location protected it from coastal attacks. Officially established in 1792 as both county seat and state capital, the city was named after Sir [[Walter Raleigh]], sponsor of [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]], the \"lost colony\" on [[Roanoke Island]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nchistoricsites.org/capitol/stat_cap/ |title=Capitol History |accessdate=May 16, 2013 |author=North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200430/http://www.nchistoricsites.org/capitol/stat_cap/ |archive-date=October 29, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The population of the colony more than quadrupled from 52,000 in 1740 to 270,000 in 1780 from high immigration from Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania plus immigrants from abroad.<ref>Wiki Article Historical Demography of the United States.</ref>\n\nNorth Carolina made the smallest per-capita contribution to the war of any state, as only 7,800 men joined the [[Continental Army]] under General [[George Washington]]; an additional 10,000 served in local militia units under such leaders as General [[Nathanael Greene]].<ref>Milton Ready, ''The Tar Heel State: A History of North Carolina'' (U. of South Carolina Press, 2005), pp. 116, 120.</ref> There was some military action, especially in 1780\u201381. Many Carolinian frontiersmen had moved west over the mountains, into the [[Washington District, North Carolina|Washington District]] (later known as [[Tennessee]]), but in 1789, following the Revolution, the state was persuaded to relinquish its claim to the western lands. It ceded them to the national government so the [[Northwest Territory]] could be organized and managed nationally.\n\nAfter 1800, cotton and [[tobacco]] became important export crops. The eastern half of the state, especially the [[Tidewater (geographic term)|Tidewater]] region, developed a slave society based on a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] system and [[slavery|slave]] labor. Many [[free people of color]] migrated to the frontier along with their European-American neighbors, where the social system was looser. By 1810, nearly three percent of the free population consisted of free people of color, who numbered slightly more than ten thousand. The western areas were dominated by white families, especially Scots-Irish, who operated small subsistence farms. In the early national period, the state became a center of [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian]] and [[Jacksonian democracy]], with a strong [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] presence, especially in the West. After [[Nat Turner]]'s slave uprising in 1831, North Carolina and other southern states reduced the rights of free blacks. In 1835 the legislature withdrew their right to vote.\n\nOn May 20, 1861, North Carolina was the last of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate states]] to declare [[secession]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], 13 days after the Tennessee legislature voted for secession. Some 125,000 North Carolinians served in the military; 20,000 were killed in battle, the most of any state in the Confederacy, and 21,000 died of disease. The state government was reluctant to support the demands of the national government in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], and the state was the scene of only small battles.\n\nWith the defeat of the Confederacy in 1865, the [[Reconstruction Era]] began. The United States abolished slavery without compensation to slaveholders or reparations to [[freedmen]]. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] coalition of black freedmen, northern [[carpetbagger]]s and local [[scalawag]]s controlled state government for three years. The white conservative Democrats regained control of the state legislature in 1870, in part by [[Ku Klux Klan]] violence and terrorism at the polls, to suppress black voting. Republicans were elected to the governorship until 1876, when the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], a paramilitary organization that arose in 1874 and was allied with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], helped suppress black voting. More than 150 black Americans were murdered in electoral violence in 1876.\n\nPost civil war-debt cycles pushed people to switch from subsistence agriculture to commodity agriculture. Among this time the notorious Crop-Lien system developed and was financially difficult on landless whites and blacks, due to high amounts of usury. Also due to the push for commodity agriculture, the free range was ended. Prior to this time people fenced in their crops and had their livestock feeding on the free range areas. After the ending of the free range people now fenced their animals and had their crops in the open.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nDemocrats were elected to the legislature and governor's office, but the [[People's Party (United States)|Populists]] attracted voters displeased with them. In 1896 a biracial, Populist-Republican Fusionist coalition gained the governor's office and passed laws that would extend the voting franchise to blacks and poor whites. The Democrats regained control of the legislature in 1896 and passed laws to impose [[Jim Crow]] and [[racial segregation]] of public facilities. Voters of North Carolina's 2nd congressional district elected a total of four African-American [[United States Congress|congressmen]] through these years of the late 19th century.\n\nPolitical tensions ran so high that a small group of white Democrats in 1898 planned to take over the [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] government if their candidates were not elected. In the [[Wilmington Insurrection of 1898]], more than 1,500 white men attacked the black newspaper and neighborhood, killed numerous men, and ran off the white Republican mayor and aldermen. They installed their own people and elected [[Alfred M. Waddell]] as mayor, in the only [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] in United States history.<ref>[http://www.history.ncdcr.gov/1898-wrrc/report/Chapter5.pdf \"Chapter 5\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321002041/http://www.history.ncdcr.gov/1898-wrrc/report/Chapter5.pdf |date=March 21, 2009 }}, ''1898 Wilmington Race Riot Commission Report'', North Carolina Dept. of Cultural Resources.</ref>\n\nIn 1899 the state legislature passed a new constitution, with requirements for [[tax per head|poll taxes]] and [[literacy test]]s for voter registration which [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised]] most black Americans in the state.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H.

It was not until 1992 that another [[African American]] was elected as a U.S. Representative from North Carolina.\n\nAs in the rest of the former Confederacy, North Carolina had become a one-party state, dominated by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Impoverished by the Civil War and vicious debt cycles, the state continued with an economy based on [[tobacco]], cotton textiles and commodity agriculture. Towns and cities remained few in the east. A major industrial base emerged in the late 19th century in the counties of the [[Piedmont Triad]], based on cotton mills established at the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]]. Railroads were built to connect the new industrializing cities. The state was the site of the first successful controlled, powered and sustained heavier-than-air flight, by the [[Wright brothers]], near [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina|Kitty Hawk]] on December 17, 1903. In the first half of the 20th century, many African Americans left the state to go North for better opportunities, in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. Their departure changed the demographic characteristics of many areas.\n\nNorth Carolina was hard hit by the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], but the [[New Deal]] programs of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] for cotton and tobacco significantly helped the farmers. After World War II, the state's economy grew rapidly, highlighted by the growth of such cities as Charlotte, Raleigh, and Durham in the Piedmont. Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill form the [[Research Triangle]], a major area of universities and advanced scientific and technical research. In the 1990s, Charlotte became a major regional and national banking center. Tourism has also been a boon for the North Carolina economy as people flock to the Outer Banks coastal area and the Appalachian Mountains anchored by [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]].\n\nBy the 1970s, spurred in part by the increasingly leftward tilt of national Democrats, conservative whites began to vote for Republican national candidates and gradually for more Republicans locally. The [[Greensboro sit-ins|Greensboro Sit-ins]] played a crucial role in the Civil Rights Movement to bring full equality to American blacks.\n\n===Native Americans, lost colonies, and permanent settlement===\n\n{{See also|Native Americans in the United States|Joara|Roanoke Island|Fort Raleigh National Historic Site}}\n[[File:The Carte of all the Coast of Virginia by Theodor de Bry 1585 1586.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the coast of [[Virginia]] and North Carolina, drawn 1585\u20131586 by [[Theodor de Bry]], based on map by [[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]] of the [[Roanoke Colony]]]]\n\nNorth Carolina was inhabited for at least ten thousand years by succeeding [[prehistoric]] [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] cultures. The [[Hardaway Site]] saw major periods of occupation as far back as 10,000 years. Before 200 AD, they were building [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork mounds]], which were used for ceremonial and religious purposes. Succeeding peoples, including those of the ancient [[Mississippian culture]] established by 1000 AD in the Piedmont, continued to build or add on to such mounds. In the 500\u2013700 years preceding European contact, the Mississippian culture built large, complex cities and maintained far-flung regional trading networks. Its largest city was [[Cahokia]], located in present-day Illinois near the Mississippi River.\n\nHistorically documented tribes in the North Carolina region include the [[Carolina Algonquian]]-speaking tribes of the coastal areas, such as the [[Chowanoke]], [[Roanoke (tribe)|Roanoke]], [[Pamlico]], [[Machapunga]], [[Coree]], and [[Cape Fear Indians]], who were the first encountered by the English; the [[Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Meherrin]], [[Cherokee]], and [[Tuscarora (tribe)|Tuscarora]] of the interior; and Southeastern [[Siouan]] tribes, such as the [[Cheraw (tribe)|Cheraw]], [[Waxhaws|Waxhaw]], [[Saponi]], [[Waccamaw Siouan|Waccamaw]], and [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]].\n\nSpanish [[explorer]]s traveling inland in the 16th century met [[Mississippian culture]] people at [[Joara]], a regional [[chiefdom]] near present-day [[Morganton, North Carolina|Morganton]]. Records of [[Hernando de Soto]] attested to his meeting with them in 1540. In 1567 Captain [[Juan Pardo (explorer)|Juan Pardo]] led an expedition to claim the area for the Spanish colony and to establish another route to protect silver mines in Mexico. Pardo made a winter base at Joara, which he renamed ''Cuenca''. His expedition built Fort San Juan and left a contingent of 30 men there, while Pardo traveled further, and built and garrisoned five other forts. He returned by a different route to [[Mission Santa Elena|Santa Elena]] on [[Parris Island, South Carolina]], then a center of [[Spanish Florida]]. In the spring of 1568, natives killed all but one of the soldiers and burned the six forts in the interior, including the one at Fort San Juan. Although the Spanish never returned to the interior, this effort marked the first European attempt at colonization of the interior of what became the United States. A 16th-century journal by Pardo's scribe Bandera and [[archaeological]] findings since 1986 at Joara have confirmed the settlement.<ref name=richards/><ref>{{cite web|author1=Patrick Gibbs |url=http://antiquity.ac.uk/ProjGall/moore/index.html |first2=David G. |last2=Moore |first3=Robin A. |last3=Beck Jr. |first4=Christopher B. |last4=Rodning |title=Joara and Fort San Juan: culture contact at the edge of the world |volume=78 |issue=229 |publisher=Antiquity.ac.uk |date=March 2004 |accessdate=July 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724171011/http://antiquity.ac.uk/ProjGall/moore/index.html |archivedate=July 24, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n[[File:Croatoan.jpg|thumb|right|[[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]] returns to find the colony abandoned]]\n\nIn 1584, [[Elizabeth I]] granted a charter to [[Sir Walter Raleigh]], for whom the state capital is named, for land in present-day North Carolina (then part of the territory of [[Virginia]]).<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Randinelli\n|first=Tracey\n|title=Tanglewood Park\n|publisher=Harcourt\n|location=Orlando, Florida\n|page=16\n|url=\n|id=\n|isbn=978-0-15-333476-4 }}</ref> It was the second American territory which the English attempted to colonize.

The English, Welsh, Scots-Irish, and German settlers of western North Carolina tended to favor American independence from Britain.\n\nMost of the English colonists had arrived as [[indentured servant]]s, hiring themselves out as laborers for a fixed period to pay for their passage. In the early years the line between indentured servants and African [[slave]]s or laborers was fluid. Some Africans were allowed to earn their freedom before slavery became a lifelong status. Most of the [[free people of color|free colored]] families formed in North Carolina before the Revolution were descended from unions or marriages between free white women and enslaved or free African or African-American men.

The economy's growth and prosperity was based on slave labor, devoted primarily to the production of tobacco.\n\nOn April 12, 1776, the colony became the first to instruct its delegates to the [[Continental Congress]] to vote for independence from the British Crown, through the [[Halifax Resolves]] passed by the [[North Carolina Provincial Congress]]. The date of this event is memorialized on the [[Flag of North Carolina|state flag]] and [[Seal of North Carolina|state seal]]. Throughout the Revolutionary War, fierce [[guerrilla warfare]] erupted between bands of pro-independence and pro-British colonists. In some cases the war was also an excuse to settle private grudges and rivalries. A major American victory in the war took place at [[King's Mountain]] along the North Carolina\u2013South Carolina border; on October 7, 1780, a force of 1000 mountain men from western North Carolina (including what is today the state of [[Tennessee]]) and [[southwest Virginia]] overwhelmed a force of some 1000 British troops led by Major [[Patrick Ferguson]]. Most of the soldiers fighting for the British side in this battle were Carolinians who had remained loyal to the Crown (they were called \"Tories\" or Loyalists). The American victory at Kings Mountain gave the advantage to colonists who favored American independence, and it prevented the British Army from recruiting new soldiers from the Tories.\n[[File:Battle of Guiliford Courthouse 15 March 1781.jpg|thumb|left|1st Maryland Regiment holding the line at the [[Battle of Guilford]]]]\n\nThe road to [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] and America's independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] led through North Carolina. As the [[British Army]] moved north from victories in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] and [[Camden, South Carolina]], the Southern Division of the [[Continental Army]] and local militia prepared to meet them. Following General [[Daniel Morgan]]'s victory over the British Cavalry Commander [[Banastre Tarleton]] at the [[Battle of Cowpens]] on January 17, 1781, southern commander [[Nathanael Greene]] led British Lord [[Charles Cornwallis]] across the heartland of North Carolina, and away from the latter's base of supply in Charleston, South Carolina.

Generals Greene and Cornwallis finally met at the [[Battle of Guilford Courthouse]] in present-day [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]] on March 15, 1781. Although the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] troops held the field at the end of the battle, their casualties at the hands of the numerically superior Continental Army were crippling. Following this \"[[Pyrrhic victory]]\", Cornwallis chose to move to the Virginia coastline to get reinforcements, and to allow the [[Royal Navy]] to protect his battered army. This decision would result in Cornwallis' eventual defeat at [[Yorktown, Virginia]], later in 1781. The Patriots' victory there guaranteed American independence.\n\n===Antebellum period===\n\n{{Main|Constitutional Convention (United States)|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n\nOn November 21, 1789, North Carolina became the twelfth state to ratify the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. In 1840, it completed the [[North Carolina State Capitol|state capitol]] building in Raleigh, still standing today. Most of North Carolina's slave owners and large [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] were located in the eastern portion of the state. Although North Carolina's plantation system was smaller and less cohesive than that of [[Virginia]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], or [[South Carolina]], significant numbers of planters were concentrated in the counties around the port cities of Wilmington and Edenton, as well as suburban planters around the cities of Raleigh, Charlotte, and [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]] in the Piedmont. Planters owning large estates wielded significant political and socio-economic power in antebellum North Carolina, which was a slave society. They placed their interests above those of the generally non-slave-holding \"yeoman\" farmers of western North Carolina. In mid-century, the state's rural and commercial areas were connected by the construction of a {{convert|129|mi|adj=on|abbr=on}} wooden plank road, known as a \"farmer's railroad\", from [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]] in the east to [[Bethania, North Carolina|Bethania]] (northwest of [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]]).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n[[File:Map North Carolina roads and railroads 1854.jpg|thumb|[[Map]] of the roads and railroads of North Carolina, 1854]]\n\nBesides slaves, there were a number of [[free people of color]] in the state.

Two additional Union Army regiments were raised in the coastal areas of the state, which were occupied by Union forces in 1862 and 1863. Numerous slaves escaped to Union lines, where they became essentially free.\n\nConfederate troops from all parts of North Carolina served in virtually all the major battles of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]], the Confederacy's most famous army. The largest battle fought in North Carolina was at [[Battle of Bentonville|Bentonville]], which was a futile attempt by Confederate General [[Joseph E.

At the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in July 1863, the 26th North Carolina Regiment participated in [[Pickett's Charge|Pickett/Pettigrew's Charge]] and advanced the farthest into the Northern lines of any Confederate regiment.

In order to earn back its rights, the state had to make concessions to Washington, one of which was the ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] that was followed through by the [[North Carolina Supreme Court]] on December 4, 1865. Congressional Republicans during the Reconstruction, commonly referred to as \"[[radical Republicans]]\", constantly pushed for new constitutions for each of the Southern states that emphasized on equal rights for African-Americans. In 1868, a constitutional convention restored the state government of North Carolina. Though the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] was also adopted that same year, it remained [[Jim Crow laws|in most cases]] ineffective for almost a century\u2014not to mention paramilitary groups and their [[lynching in the United States|lynching]] with impunity.\n\nThe elections in April 1868 following the constitutional convention led to a narrow victory for a Republican-dominated government, with 19 African-Americans holding positions in the [[North Carolina State Legislature]].

The coastal plain consists of more specifically-defined areas known as the [[Outer Banks]], a string of sandy, narrow [[barrier islands]] separated from the mainland by sounds or inlets, including [[Albemarle Sound]] and [[Pamlico Sound]], the [[Tidewater (geographic term)|tidewater]] region, the native home of the [[venus flytrap]], and the inner coastal plain, where [[longleaf pine]] trees are native.\n\nSo many ships have been lost off [[Cape Hatteras]] that the area is known as the \"[[Graveyard of the Atlantic]]\"; more than a thousand ships have sunk in these waters since records began in 1526. The most famous of these is the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'' (flagship of the pirate [[Blackbeard]]), which went aground in Beaufort Inlet in 1718.<ref>{{cite web| title=Blackbeard's Queen Anne's Revenge Coming Back to Beaufort| website=Beach Carolina Magazine| date=March 30, 2011| url=http://beachcarolina.com/2011/03/30/blackbeards-queen-annes-revenge-coming-back-to-beaufort/| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221030139/http://beachcarolina.com/2011/03/30/blackbeards-queen-annes-revenge-coming-back-to-beaufort/| archivedate=February 21, 2013| df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe coastal plain transitions to the Piedmont region along the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line]], the elevation at which waterfalls first appear on streams and rivers.

Tornadoes from thunderstorms are a risk, especially in the eastern part of the state. Western Piedmont is often protected by the mountains, which tend to break up storms as they try to cross over; the storms will often re-form farther east. A phenomenon known as \"[[cold-air damming]]\" often occurs in the northwestern part of the state, which can weaken storms but can also lead to major ice events in winter.<ref>{{cite web|title=NOAA National Climatic Data Center|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|accessdate=October 24, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016174155/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|archive-date=October 16, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2011, [[Tornado outbreak of April 14\u201316, 2011|the worst tornado outbreak]] in North Carolina's history occurred.

Before the Civil War, the Baptists split into regional associations of the North and South, over the issue of slavery.\n\nBy the late 19th century, the largest Protestant denomination in North Carolina was the [[Baptist]], when both whites and blacks were considered, but the latter people had set up their own organizations. After [[emancipation]], black Baptists quickly set up their own independent congregations in North Carolina and other states of the South, as they wanted to be free of white supervision.<ref name=\"brooks\">{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FEKdAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA11#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Evolution of the Negro Baptist Church|last=Brooks|first=Walter Henderson (1851\u20131945)|journal=Journal of Negro History|volume=7|number=1|date=January 1922|pages=11\u201322|access-date=19 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190830234438/https://books.google.com/books?id=FEKdAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA11#v=onepage&q&f=false|archive-date=August 30, 2019|url-status=live|doi=10.2307/2713578|jstor=2713578}}</ref><ref name=\"raboteau\"/><ref>Wilson Fallin Jr., ''Uplifting the People: Three Centuries of Black Baptists in Alabama'' (2007) pp. 52\u201353</ref> Black Baptists developed their own state and national associations, such as the [[National Baptist Convention USA, Inc.]].<ref name=\"raboteau\">Albert J.

The third was the Roman Catholic Church, with 428,000 members in 190 congregations.

[[Presbyterians]], historically Scots-Irish, have had a strong presence in [[Charlotte]] and in [[Scotland County, North Carolina|Scotland County]].\n\nCurrently, the rapid influx of [[Northern United States|northerners]] and immigrants from Latin America is steadily increasing ethnic and religious diversity: the number of [[Roman Catholics]] and [[Judaism|Jews]] in the state has increased, as well as general religious diversity. The second-largest Protestant denomination in North Carolina after Baptist traditions is [[Methodism]], which is strong in the northern Piedmont, especially in populous [[Guilford County]].

According to one estimate, one-half of North Carolina's 100 counties have lost population since 2010, primarily due to the poor economy in many of North Carolina's rural areas.

These consist of the [[North Carolina Council of State|Council of State]] (led by the [[Governor of North Carolina|Governor]]), the [[bicameral]] legislature (called the [[North Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]]), and the state court system (headed by the [[North Carolina Supreme Court]]). The [[Constitution of North Carolina|state constitution]] delineates the structure and function of the state government. North Carolina has 13 seats in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] and two seats in the [[U.S. Senate]].\n\nNorth Carolina's party loyalties have undergone a series of important shifts in the last few years: While the 2010 midterms saw [[Tar Heel]] voters elect a bicameral [[North Carolina Republican Party|Republican]] majority legislature for the first time in more than a century, North Carolina has also become a Southern [[swing state]] in presidential races. Since Southern Democrat [[Jimmy Carter]]'s comfortable victory in the state [[1976 United States presidential election in North Carolina|in 1976]], the state had consistently leaned Republican in presidential elections until Democrat [[Barack Obama]] narrowly won the state [[2008 United States presidential election in North Carolina|in 2008]]. In the 1990s, Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] came within a point of winning the state [[1992 United States presidential election in North Carolina|in 1992]] and also only narrowly lost the state [[1996 United States presidential election in North Carolina|in 1996]]. In the early 2000s, Republican [[George W. Bush]] easily won the state by more than 12 points.\n\nBy 2008, demographic shifts, population growth, and increased liberalization in densely populated areas such as the [[Research Triangle]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]], [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]], and [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]], propelled Barack Obama to victory in North Carolina, the first Democrat to win the state since 1976. In [[2012 United States presidential election in North Carolina|2012]], North Carolina was again considered a competitive swing state, with the Democrats even holding their [[2012 Democratic National Convention]] in Charlotte. However, Republican [[Mitt Romney]] ultimately eked out a two-point win in North Carolina, the only 2012 swing state that Obama lost, and one of only two states (along with [[2012 United States presidential election in Indiana|Indiana]]) to flip from Obama in 2008 to the GOP in 2012.\n\nIn 2012, the state elected a Republican Governor ([[Pat McCrory]]) and Lieutenant Governor ([[Dan Forest]]) for the first time in more than two decades, while also giving the Republicans veto-proof majorities in both the State House of Representatives and the State Senate.\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em\"\n! colspan = 6 | North Carolina registered voters {{as of|2019|November|16|lc=y|df=US}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vt.ncsbe.gov/RegStat/Stats?Date=11/16/2019&CountyName=Totals|title=Voter Registration Statistics|publisher=[[North Carolina State Board of Elections]]}}</ref>\n|-\n! colspan = 2 | Party\n!

The northern and southern parts of the original province separated in 1729. Originally settled by small farmers, sometimes having a few slaves, who were oriented toward subsistence agriculture, the colony lacked cities or towns. [[Piracy|Pirates]] menaced the coastal settlements, but by 1718 the pirates had been captured and killed. Growth was strong in the middle of the 18th century, as the economy attracted [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]], [[Quaker]], [[English American|English]] and [[German American|German]] [[immigrants]]. A majority of the colonists generally supported the [[American Revolution]], and a smaller number of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] than in some other colonies such as Georgia, South Carolina, Delaware, New York.\n\nDuring colonial times, [[Edenton, North Carolina|Edenton]] served as the state capital beginning in 1722, and [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]] was selected as the capital in 1766. Construction of [[Governor's Palace, New Bern|Tryon Palace]], which served as the residence and offices of the provincial governor [[William Tryon]], began in 1767 and was completed in 1771. In 1788 [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] was chosen as the site of the new capital, as its central location protected it from coastal attacks. Officially established in 1792 as both county seat and state capital, the city was named after Sir [[Walter Raleigh]], sponsor of [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]], the \"lost colony\" on [[Roanoke Island]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nchistoricsites.org/capitol/stat_cap/ |title=Capitol History |accessdate=May 16, 2013 |author=North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200430/http://www.nchistoricsites.org/capitol/stat_cap/ |archive-date=October 29, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The population of the colony more than quadrupled from 52,000 in 1740 to 270,000 in 1780 from high immigration from Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania plus immigrants from abroad.<ref>Wiki Article Historical Demography of the United States.</ref>\n\nNorth Carolina made the smallest per-capita contribution to the war of any state, as only 7,800 men joined the [[Continental Army]] under General [[George Washington]]; an additional 10,000 served in local militia units under such leaders as General [[Nathanael Greene]].<ref>Milton Ready, ''The Tar Heel State: A History of North Carolina'' (U. of South Carolina Press, 2005), pp. 116, 120.</ref> There was some military action, especially in 1780\u201381. Many Carolinian frontiersmen had moved west over the mountains, into the [[Washington District, North Carolina|Washington District]] (later known as [[Tennessee]]), but in 1789, following the Revolution, the state was persuaded to relinquish its claim to the western lands. It ceded them to the national government so the [[Northwest Territory]] could be organized and managed nationally.\n\nAfter 1800, cotton and [[tobacco]] became important export crops. The eastern half of the state, especially the [[Tidewater (geographic term)|Tidewater]] region, developed a slave society based on a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] system and [[slavery|slave]] labor. Many [[free people of color]] migrated to the frontier along with their European-American neighbors, where the social system was looser. By 1810, nearly three percent of the free population consisted of free people of color, who numbered slightly more than ten thousand. The western areas were dominated by white families, especially Scots-Irish, who operated small subsistence farms. In the early national period, the state became a center of [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian]] and [[Jacksonian democracy]], with a strong [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] presence, especially in the West. After [[Nat Turner]]'s slave uprising in 1831, North Carolina and other southern states reduced the rights of free blacks. In 1835 the legislature withdrew their right to vote.\n\nOn May 20, 1861, North Carolina was the last of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate states]] to declare [[secession]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], 13 days after the Tennessee legislature voted for secession. Some 125,000 North Carolinians served in the military; 20,000 were killed in battle, the most of any state in the Confederacy, and 21,000 died of disease. The state government was reluctant to support the demands of the national government in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], and the state was the scene of only small battles.\n\nWith the defeat of the Confederacy in 1865, the [[Reconstruction Era]] began. The United States abolished slavery without compensation to slaveholders or reparations to [[freedmen]]. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] coalition of black freedmen, northern [[carpetbagger]]s and local [[scalawag]]s controlled state government for three years. The white conservative Democrats regained control of the state legislature in 1870, in part by [[Ku Klux Klan]] violence and terrorism at the polls, to suppress black voting. Republicans were elected to the governorship until 1876, when the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], a paramilitary organization that arose in 1874 and was allied with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], helped suppress black voting. More than 150 black Americans were murdered in electoral violence in 1876.\n\nPost civil war-debt cycles pushed people to switch from subsistence agriculture to commodity agriculture. Among this time the notorious Crop-Lien system developed and was financially difficult on landless whites and blacks, due to high amounts of usury. Also due to the push for commodity agriculture, the free range was ended. Prior to this time people fenced in their crops and had their livestock feeding on the free range areas. After the ending of the free range people now fenced their animals and had their crops in the open.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nDemocrats were elected to the legislature and governor's office, but the [[People's Party (United States)|Populists]] attracted voters displeased with them. In 1896 a biracial, Populist-Republican Fusionist coalition gained the governor's office and passed laws that would extend the voting franchise to blacks and poor whites. The Democrats regained control of the legislature in 1896 and passed laws to impose [[Jim Crow]] and [[racial segregation]] of public facilities. Voters of North Carolina's 2nd congressional district elected a total of four African-American [[United States Congress|congressmen]] through these years of the late 19th century.\n\nPolitical tensions ran so high that a small group of white Democrats in 1898 planned to take over the [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] government if their candidates were not elected. In the [[Wilmington Insurrection of 1898]], more than 1,500 white men attacked the black newspaper and neighborhood, killed numerous men, and ran off the white Republican mayor and aldermen. They installed their own people and elected [[Alfred M. Waddell]] as mayor, in the only [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] in United States history.<ref>[http://www.history.ncdcr.gov/1898-wrrc/report/Chapter5.pdf \"Chapter 5\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321002041/http://www.history.ncdcr.gov/1898-wrrc/report/Chapter5.pdf |date=March 21, 2009 }}, ''1898 Wilmington Race Riot Commission Report'', North Carolina Dept. of Cultural Resources.</ref>\n\nIn 1899 the state legislature passed a new constitution, with requirements for [[tax per head|poll taxes]] and [[literacy test]]s for voter registration which [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised]] most black Americans in the state.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H.

It was not until 1992 that another [[African American]] was elected as a U.S. Representative from North Carolina.\n\nAs in the rest of the former Confederacy, North Carolina had become a one-party state, dominated by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Impoverished by the Civil War and vicious debt cycles, the state continued with an economy based on [[tobacco]], cotton textiles and commodity agriculture. Towns and cities remained few in the east. A major industrial base emerged in the late 19th century in the counties of the [[Piedmont Triad]], based on cotton mills established at the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]]. Railroads were built to connect the new industrializing cities. The state was the site of the first successful controlled, powered and sustained heavier-than-air flight, by the [[Wright brothers]], near [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina|Kitty Hawk]] on December 17, 1903. In the first half of the 20th century, many African Americans left the state to go North for better opportunities, in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. Their departure changed the demographic characteristics of many areas.\n\nNorth Carolina was hard hit by the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], but the [[New Deal]] programs of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] for cotton and tobacco significantly helped the farmers. After World War II, the state's economy grew rapidly, highlighted by the growth of such cities as Charlotte, Raleigh, and Durham in the Piedmont. Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill form the [[Research Triangle]], a major area of universities and advanced scientific and technical research. In the 1990s, Charlotte became a major regional and national banking center. Tourism has also been a boon for the North Carolina economy as people flock to the Outer Banks coastal area and the Appalachian Mountains anchored by [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]].\n\nBy the 1970s, spurred in part by the increasingly leftward tilt of national Democrats, conservative whites began to vote for Republican national candidates and gradually for more Republicans locally. The [[Greensboro sit-ins|Greensboro Sit-ins]] played a crucial role in the Civil Rights Movement to bring full equality to American blacks.\n\n===Native Americans, lost colonies, and permanent settlement===\n\n{{See also|Native Americans in the United States|Joara|Roanoke Island|Fort Raleigh National Historic Site}}\n[[File:The Carte of all the Coast of Virginia by Theodor de Bry 1585 1586.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the coast of [[Virginia]] and North Carolina, drawn 1585\u20131586 by [[Theodor de Bry]], based on map by [[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]] of the [[Roanoke Colony]]]]\n\nNorth Carolina was inhabited for at least ten thousand years by succeeding [[prehistoric]] [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] cultures. The [[Hardaway Site]] saw major periods of occupation as far back as 10,000 years. Before 200 AD, they were building [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork mounds]], which were used for ceremonial and religious purposes. Succeeding peoples, including those of the ancient [[Mississippian culture]] established by 1000 AD in the Piedmont, continued to build or add on to such mounds. In the 500\u2013700 years preceding European contact, the Mississippian culture built large, complex cities and maintained far-flung regional trading networks. Its largest city was [[Cahokia]], located in present-day Illinois near the Mississippi River.\n\nHistorically documented tribes in the North Carolina region include the [[Carolina Algonquian]]-speaking tribes of the coastal areas, such as the [[Chowanoke]], [[Roanoke (tribe)|Roanoke]], [[Pamlico]], [[Machapunga]], [[Coree]], and [[Cape Fear Indians]], who were the first encountered by the English; the [[Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Meherrin]], [[Cherokee]], and [[Tuscarora (tribe)|Tuscarora]] of the interior; and Southeastern [[Siouan]] tribes, such as the [[Cheraw (tribe)|Cheraw]], [[Waxhaws|Waxhaw]], [[Saponi]], [[Waccamaw Siouan|Waccamaw]], and [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]].\n\nSpanish [[explorer]]s traveling inland in the 16th century met [[Mississippian culture]] people at [[Joara]], a regional [[chiefdom]] near present-day [[Morganton, North Carolina|Morganton]]. Records of [[Hernando de Soto]] attested to his meeting with them in 1540. In 1567 Captain [[Juan Pardo (explorer)|Juan Pardo]] led an expedition to claim the area for the Spanish colony and to establish another route to protect silver mines in Mexico. Pardo made a winter base at Joara, which he renamed ''Cuenca''. His expedition built Fort San Juan and left a contingent of 30 men there, while Pardo traveled further, and built and garrisoned five other forts. He returned by a different route to [[Mission Santa Elena|Santa Elena]] on [[Parris Island, South Carolina]], then a center of [[Spanish Florida]]. In the spring of 1568, natives killed all but one of the soldiers and burned the six forts in the interior, including the one at Fort San Juan. Although the Spanish never returned to the interior, this effort marked the first European attempt at colonization of the interior of what became the United States. A 16th-century journal by Pardo's scribe Bandera and [[archaeological]] findings since 1986 at Joara have confirmed the settlement.<ref name=richards/><ref>{{cite web|author1=Patrick Gibbs |url=http://antiquity.ac.uk/ProjGall/moore/index.html |first2=David G. |last2=Moore |first3=Robin A. |last3=Beck Jr. |first4=Christopher B. |last4=Rodning |title=Joara and Fort San Juan: culture contact at the edge of the world |volume=78 |issue=229 |publisher=Antiquity.ac.uk |date=March 2004 |accessdate=July 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724171011/http://antiquity.ac.uk/ProjGall/moore/index.html |archivedate=July 24, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n[[File:Croatoan.jpg|thumb|right|[[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]] returns to find the colony abandoned]]\n\nIn 1584, [[Elizabeth I]] granted a charter to [[Sir Walter Raleigh]], for whom the state capital is named, for land in present-day North Carolina (then part of the territory of [[Virginia]]).<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Randinelli\n|first=Tracey\n|title=Tanglewood Park\n|publisher=Harcourt\n|location=Orlando, Florida\n|page=16\n|url=\n|id=\n|isbn=978-0-15-333476-4 }}</ref> It was the second American territory which the English attempted to colonize.

The economy's growth and prosperity was based on slave labor, devoted primarily to the production of tobacco.\n\nOn April 12, 1776, the colony became the first to instruct its delegates to the [[Continental Congress]] to vote for independence from the British Crown, through the [[Halifax Resolves]] passed by the [[North Carolina Provincial Congress]]. The date of this event is memorialized on the [[Flag of North Carolina|state flag]] and [[Seal of North Carolina|state seal]]. Throughout the Revolutionary War, fierce [[guerrilla warfare]] erupted between bands of pro-independence and pro-British colonists. In some cases the war was also an excuse to settle private grudges and rivalries. A major American victory in the war took place at [[King's Mountain]] along the North Carolina\u2013South Carolina border; on October 7, 1780, a force of 1000 mountain men from western North Carolina (including what is today the state of [[Tennessee]]) and [[southwest Virginia]] overwhelmed a force of some 1000 British troops led by Major [[Patrick Ferguson]]. Most of the soldiers fighting for the British side in this battle were Carolinians who had remained loyal to the Crown (they were called \"Tories\" or Loyalists). The American victory at Kings Mountain gave the advantage to colonists who favored American independence, and it prevented the British Army from recruiting new soldiers from the Tories.\n[[File:Battle of Guiliford Courthouse 15 March 1781.jpg|thumb|left|1st Maryland Regiment holding the line at the [[Battle of Guilford]]]]\n\nThe road to [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] and America's independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] led through North Carolina. As the [[British Army]] moved north from victories in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] and [[Camden, South Carolina]], the Southern Division of the [[Continental Army]] and local militia prepared to meet them. Following General [[Daniel Morgan]]'s victory over the British Cavalry Commander [[Banastre Tarleton]] at the [[Battle of Cowpens]] on January 17, 1781, southern commander [[Nathanael Greene]] led British Lord [[Charles Cornwallis]] across the heartland of North Carolina, and away from the latter's base of supply in Charleston, South Carolina. This campaign is known as \"The Race to the Dan\" or \"The Race for the River\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nIn the [[Battle of Cowan's Ford]], Cornwallis met resistance along the banks of the [[Catawba River]] at Cowan's Ford on February 1, 1781, in an attempt to engage General Morgan's forces during a tactical withdrawal.<ref>Stonestreet, Ottis C.

Generals Greene and Cornwallis finally met at the [[Battle of Guilford Courthouse]] in present-day [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]] on March 15, 1781. Although the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] troops held the field at the end of the battle, their casualties at the hands of the numerically superior Continental Army were crippling. Following this \"[[Pyrrhic victory]]\", Cornwallis chose to move to the Virginia coastline to get reinforcements, and to allow the [[Royal Navy]] to protect his battered army. This decision would result in Cornwallis' eventual defeat at [[Yorktown, Virginia]], later in 1781. The Patriots' victory there guaranteed American independence.\n\n===Antebellum period===\n\n{{Main|Constitutional Convention (United States)|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n\nOn November 21, 1789, North Carolina became the twelfth state to ratify the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. In 1840, it completed the [[North Carolina State Capitol|state capitol]] building in Raleigh, still standing today. Most of North Carolina's slave owners and large [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] were located in the eastern portion of the state. Although North Carolina's plantation system was smaller and less cohesive than that of [[Virginia]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], or [[South Carolina]], significant numbers of planters were concentrated in the counties around the port cities of Wilmington and Edenton, as well as suburban planters around the cities of Raleigh, Charlotte, and [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]] in the Piedmont. Planters owning large estates wielded significant political and socio-economic power in antebellum North Carolina, which was a slave society. They placed their interests above those of the generally non-slave-holding \"yeoman\" farmers of western North Carolina. In mid-century, the state's rural and commercial areas were connected by the construction of a {{convert|129|mi|adj=on|abbr=on}} wooden plank road, known as a \"farmer's railroad\", from [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]] in the east to [[Bethania, North Carolina|Bethania]] (northwest of [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]]).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n[[File:Map North Carolina roads and railroads 1854.jpg|thumb|[[Map]] of the roads and railroads of North Carolina, 1854]]\n\nBesides slaves, there were a number of [[free people of color]] in the state.

During the Civil War, the Wilmington-to-Raleigh stretch of the railroad would be vital to the Confederate war effort; supplies shipped into Wilmington would be moved by rail through Raleigh to the Confederate capital of [[Richmond, Virginia]].\n\nDuring the antebellum period, North Carolina was an overwhelmingly rural state, even by Southern standards. In 1860 only one North Carolina town, the port city of [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]], had a population of more than 10,000. [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], the state capital, had barely more than 5,000 residents.\n\nWhile slaveholding was slightly less concentrated than in some Southern states, according to the 1860 census, more than 330,000 people, or 33% of the population of 992,622, were enslaved African Americans.<ref name=census>{{cite web|title=Historical Census Browser:Census Data for Year 1860 |date=2004 |accessdate=June 26, 2014 |website=University of Virginia Library |url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/php/start.php?year=V1860 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011024040/http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/php/start.php?year=V1860 |archivedate=October 11, 2014 |df= }}</ref> They lived and worked chiefly on plantations in the eastern [[Tidewater (geographic term)|Tidewater]].

Some of the yeoman farmers in the state's mountains and western Piedmont region remained neutral during the Civil War, while some covertly supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] cause during the conflict. Approximately 2,000 North Carolinians from western North Carolina enlisted in the [[Union Army]] and fought for the North in the war. Two additional Union Army regiments were raised in the coastal areas of the state, which were occupied by Union forces in 1862 and 1863. Numerous slaves escaped to Union lines, where they became essentially free.\n\nConfederate troops from all parts of North Carolina served in virtually all the major battles of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]], the Confederacy's most famous army. The largest battle fought in North Carolina was at [[Battle of Bentonville|Bentonville]], which was a futile attempt by Confederate General [[Joseph E. Johnston|Joseph Johnston]] to slow Union General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s advance through the Carolinas in the spring of 1865.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> In April 1865, after losing the [[Battle of Morrisville]], Johnston surrendered to Sherman at [[Bennett Place]], in what is today [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]]. North Carolina's port city of [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] was the last Confederate port to fall to the Union, in February 1865, after the Union won the nearby [[Second Battle of Fort Fisher]], its major defense downriver.\n[[File:2008-08-16 Bennett Place historic site.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bennett Place]] historic site in [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]]]]\n\nThe first Confederate soldier to be killed in the Civil War was Private Henry Wyatt from North Carolina, in the [[Battle of Big Bethel]] in June 1861. At the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in July 1863, the 26th North Carolina Regiment participated in [[Pickett's Charge|Pickett/Pettigrew's Charge]] and advanced the farthest into the Northern lines of any Confederate regiment. During the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], the 58th North Carolina Regiment advanced farther than any other regiment on Snodgrass Hill to push back the remaining Union forces from the battlefield. At [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox Court House]] in Virginia in April 1865, the 75th North Carolina Regiment, a cavalry unit, fired the last shots of the Confederate [[Army of Northern Virginia]] in the Civil War. For many years, North Carolinians proudly boasted that they had been \"First at Bethel, Farthest at Gettysburg and Chickamauga, and Last at Appomattox\".\n\n===Reconstruction===\n\n{{Main|Reconstruction era}}\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Confederacy in 1865, North Carolina, along with the rest of the former Confederate States, was put under direct control by the [[U.S. military]] and was relieved of its [[Constitution of North Carolina|constitutional government]] and representation within the [[United States Congress]] in what is now referred to as the [[Reconstruction era]]. In order to earn back its rights, the state had to make concessions to Washington, one of which was the ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] that was followed through by the [[North Carolina Supreme Court]] on December 4, 1865. Congressional Republicans during the Reconstruction, commonly referred to as \"[[radical Republicans]]\", constantly pushed for new constitutions for each of the Southern states that emphasized on equal rights for African-Americans. In 1868, a constitutional convention restored the state government of North Carolina. Though the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] was also adopted that same year, it remained [[Jim Crow laws|in most cases]] ineffective for almost a century\u2014not to mention paramilitary groups and their [[lynching in the United States|lynching]] with impunity.\n\nThe elections in April 1868 following the constitutional convention led to a narrow victory for a Republican-dominated government, with 19 African-Americans holding positions in the [[North Carolina State Legislature]]. In attempt to put the reforms into effect, the new Republican Governor [[William W.

While North Carolina's urban areas have enjoyed a prosperous economy with steady job growth, low unemployment, and rising wages, many of the state's rural counties have suffered from job loss, rising levels of poverty, and population loss as their manufacturing base has declined. According to one estimate, one-half of North Carolina's 100 counties have lost population since 2010, primarily due to the poor economy in many of North Carolina's rural areas.

These consist of the [[North Carolina Council of State|Council of State]] (led by the [[Governor of North Carolina|Governor]]), the [[bicameral]] legislature (called the [[North Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]]), and the state court system (headed by the [[North Carolina Supreme Court]]). The [[Constitution of North Carolina|state constitution]] delineates the structure and function of the state government. North Carolina has 13 seats in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] and two seats in the [[U.S. Senate]].\n\nNorth Carolina's party loyalties have undergone a series of important shifts in the last few years: While the 2010 midterms saw [[Tar Heel]] voters elect a bicameral [[North Carolina Republican Party|Republican]] majority legislature for the first time in more than a century, North Carolina has also become a Southern [[swing state]] in presidential races. Since Southern Democrat [[Jimmy Carter]]'s comfortable victory in the state [[1976 United States presidential election in North Carolina|in 1976]], the state had consistently leaned Republican in presidential elections until Democrat [[Barack Obama]] narrowly won the state [[2008 United States presidential election in North Carolina|in 2008]]. In the 1990s, Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] came within a point of winning the state [[1992 United States presidential election in North Carolina|in 1992]] and also only narrowly lost the state [[1996 United States presidential election in North Carolina|in 1996]]. In the early 2000s, Republican [[George W. Bush]] easily won the state by more than 12 points.\n\nBy 2008, demographic shifts, population growth, and increased liberalization in densely populated areas such as the [[Research Triangle]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]], [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], [[Fayetteville, North Carolina|Fayetteville]], and [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]], propelled Barack Obama to victory in North Carolina, the first Democrat to win the state since 1976. In [[2012 United States presidential election in North Carolina|2012]], North Carolina was again considered a competitive swing state, with the Democrats even holding their [[2012 Democratic National Convention]] in Charlotte. However, Republican [[Mitt Romney]] ultimately eked out a two-point win in North Carolina, the only 2012 swing state that Obama lost, and one of only two states (along with [[2012 United States presidential election in Indiana|Indiana]]) to flip from Obama in 2008 to the GOP in 2012.\n\nIn 2012, the state elected a Republican Governor ([[Pat McCrory]]) and Lieutenant Governor ([[Dan Forest]]) for the first time in more than two decades, while also giving the Republicans veto-proof majorities in both the State House of Representatives and the State Senate.\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em\"\n! colspan = 6 | North Carolina registered voters {{as of|2019|November|16|lc=y|df=US}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vt.ncsbe.gov/RegStat/Stats?Date=11/16/2019&CountyName=Totals|title=Voter Registration Statistics|publisher=[[North Carolina State Board of Elections]]}}</ref>\n|-\n! colspan = 2 | Party\n!

The Yadkin Valley in particular has become a strengthening market for grape production, while [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]] recently won the recognition of being named 'Beer City USA'. [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]] boasts the largest [[North Carolina breweries#Breweries|breweries]] per capita of any city in the United States.

Research Triangle Park, a large industrial complex located in the Raleigh-Durham area, is one of the major centers in the country for electronics and medical research.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n[[Tobacco]] was one of the first major industries to develop after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Many farmers grew some tobacco, and the invention of the cigarette made the product especially popular. Winston-Salem is the birthplace of [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]] (RJR), founded by [[R. J. Reynolds]] in 1874 as one of 16 tobacco companies in the town. By 1914 it was selling 425 million packs of Camels a year. Today it is the second-largest tobacco company in the U.S. (behind [[Altria Group]]). RJR is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Reynolds American Inc., which in turn is 42% owned by [[British American Tobacco]].<ref>Nannie M. Tilley, ''The R.J.

In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct [[Indian Removal]] of the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]s, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the [[Seminole Wars]], planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.\n\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the \"cotton kingdom\" of the Deep South. It ranked fifth of all [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties in the production of cotton from the 20 major plantations. Uniquely among Confederate capitals east of the [[Mississippi River]], in the [[American Civil War]] Tallahassee was never captured by Union forces. No Union soldiers set foot in Leon County until the [[Reconstruction Era]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|702|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|667|sqmi}} are land and {{convert|35|sqmi}} (5.0%) are water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Unlike much of Florida, most of Leon County has rolling hills, part of north Florida's [[Red Hills Region]].

According to an article written in Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, The library was built on the campus of Florida A&M University because the city refused the donation based on the fact that it would have to serve the black citizens.  \"The facility boasted modern amenities such as electricity, indoor plumbing and water supplied by the city. In later years, the Library served as an art gallery, religious center, and in 1976, became the founding home of the Black Archives Research Center and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and Museum.

According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954.  The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" <ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\">Leon County.

Retrieved April 09, 2018, from Leon County Florida Government: http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/Library-History</ref>  One year later, the library was established in May by legislative action and was developed by citizens and civic groups.  In 1956 the first Leon County free public library opened on March 21.  The first building used to house the library was The Columns, one of the  oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area located at Park Avenue and Adams street (the building today is home of the James Madison Institute).\n\nIn order to expand library services the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a bookmobile to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddy wagon for its Road Prison.\nIn 1962 the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee was desegregated by 1958, yet it would several more years before the public library system would experience integration.\n\nIn the early 70's Jefferson and Wakulla counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's web site, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  In 1975 the system started a branch library in the Bond community, a predominantly black community on the city's Southside. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to a location in Tallahassee's Northwood Mall.  Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library.  In 1989 \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N. Duval.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  The new library had its grand opening in 1991 and was renamed in 1993 in honor of former Governor LeRoy Collins.\n\n==Points of interest==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alfred B.

In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct [[Indian Removal]] of the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]s, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the [[Seminole Wars]], planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.\n\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the \"cotton kingdom\" of the Deep South. It ranked fifth of all [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties in the production of cotton from the 20 major plantations. Uniquely among Confederate capitals east of the [[Mississippi River]], in the [[American Civil War]] Tallahassee was never captured by Union forces. No Union soldiers set foot in Leon County until the [[Reconstruction Era]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|702|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|667|sqmi}} are land and {{convert|35|sqmi}} (5.0%) are water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Unlike much of Florida, most of Leon County has rolling hills, part of north Florida's [[Red Hills Region]].

This library was the first and only public library in the city of Tallahassee until 1955.  The philanthropist, Andrew Carnegie offered the city of Tallahassee money to build a public library in 1906. According to an article written in Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, The library was built on the campus of Florida A&M University because the city refused the donation based on the fact that it would have to serve the black citizens.  \"The facility boasted modern amenities such as electricity, indoor plumbing and water supplied by the city. In later years, the Library served as an art gallery, religious center, and in 1976, became the founding home of the Black Archives Research Center and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and social groups, as well as, public and private businesses throughout Florida and the nation.\"<ref>{{cite journal |title=Carrie Meek - James N.

On November 17, 1978, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Carnegie Library of Tallahassee which only served the black community became the only free public library in the city until 1955.  According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954.  The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" <ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\">Leon County. (2002-2016). Library History. Retrieved April 09, 2018, from Leon County Florida Government: http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/Library-History</ref>  One year later, the library was established in May by legislative action and was developed by citizens and civic groups.  In 1956 the first Leon County free public library opened on March 21.  The first building used to house the library was The Columns, one of the  oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area located at Park Avenue and Adams street (the building today is home of the James Madison Institute).\n\nIn order to expand library services the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a bookmobile to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddy wagon for its Road Prison.\nIn 1962 the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee was desegregated by 1958, yet it would several more years before the public library system would experience integration.\n\nIn the early 70's Jefferson and Wakulla counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's web site, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  In 1975 the system started a branch library in the Bond community, a predominantly black community on the city's Southside. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to a location in Tallahassee's Northwood Mall.  Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library.  In 1989 \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N. Duval.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  The new library had its grand opening in 1991 and was renamed in 1993 in honor of former Governor LeRoy Collins.\n\n==Points of interest==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alfred B.
