The team is controlled by the governing body of football and futsal in Bhutan, the [[Bhutan Football Federation]], which is currently a member of the [[Asian Football Federation]] and the regional body the [[South Asian Football Federation]]. [[Futsal]] used to be very much in an embryonic stage of development in Bhutan, with the team only having played eight competitive matches.  A national team was selected at very short notice for the [[2013 Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games|fourth Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games]] held in [[Incheon]], [[South Korea|Korea]], in 2013. In their first game, they were soundly beaten 29-1 by [[Thailand national futsal team|Thailand]], despite scoring through Dawa Dhendup in the first minute. The team is currently ranked 150th and last in the world futsal rankings.\nBy establishing National League and investing in futsal infrastructure, conditions have significantly improved since then.\n\n==History==\nBhutan first entered an international futsal competition in 2005 when they took part in the [[2005 AFC Futsal Championship]] preliminary round.<ref name=\"RSSSF\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesf/futsal-as.html#05|title=Asian Futsal Championship Overview|last=De Bock|first=Christofhe|last2=Garin|first2=Erik|last3=Burkurt|first3=Sturmius|last4=Bobrowsky|first4=Josef|date=22 August 2008|website=www.rsssf.com|publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]]|accessdate=27 June 2014}}</ref> Travelling to [[Ho Chi Minh City]] in [[Vietnam]], they were drawn in Group C for the preliminary round along with [[Iran national futsal team|Iran]], [[Kuwait national futsal team|Kuwait]] and [[Lebanon national futsal team|Lebanon]].

The team is controlled by the governing body of football and futsal in Bhutan, the [[Bhutan Football Federation]], which is currently a member of the [[Asian Football Federation]] and the regional body the [[South Asian Football Federation]]. [[Futsal]] used to be very much in an embryonic stage of development in Bhutan, with the team only having played eight competitive matches.  A national team was selected at very short notice for the [[2013 Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games|fourth Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games]] held in [[Incheon]], [[South Korea|Korea]], in 2013. In their first game, they were soundly beaten 29-1 by [[Thailand national futsal team|Thailand]], despite scoring through Dawa Dhendup in the first minute. The team is currently ranked 150th and last in the world futsal rankings.\nBy establishing National League and investing in futsal infrastructure, conditions have significantly improved since then.\n\n==History==\nBhutan first entered an international futsal competition in 2005 when they took part in the [[2005 AFC Futsal Championship]] preliminary round.<ref name=\"RSSSF\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesf/futsal-as.html#05|title=Asian Futsal Championship Overview|last=De Bock|first=Christofhe|last2=Garin|first2=Erik|last3=Burkurt|first3=Sturmius|last4=Bobrowsky|first4=Josef|date=22 August 2008|website=www.rsssf.com|publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]]|accessdate=27 June 2014}}</ref> Travelling to [[Ho Chi Minh City]] in [[Vietnam]], they were drawn in Group C for the preliminary round along with [[Iran national futsal team|Iran]], [[Kuwait national futsal team|Kuwait]] and [[Lebanon national futsal team|Lebanon]].

Selection of epoxies is based on their superior adhesion, permeability, purity, and corrosion- and stress-resistance properties.}}</ref> Epoxy resins, also known as '''polyepoxides''', are a class of reactive [[prepolymer]]s and [[polymer]]s which contain epoxide groups.\n\nEpoxy resins may be reacted ([[cross-linked]]) either with themselves through catalytic homopolymerisation, or with a wide range of co-reactants including polyfunctional amines, acids (and [[acid anhydride]]s), phenols, alcohols and [[thiols]] (usually called mercaptans). These co-reactants are often referred to as hardeners or curatives, and the cross-linking reaction is commonly referred to as curing.\n\nReaction of polyepoxides with themselves or with polyfunctional hardeners forms a [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset]]ting [[polymer]], often with favorable mechanical properties and high thermal and chemical resistance. Epoxy has a wide range of applications, including metal coatings, use in electronics/electrical components/LEDs, high tension electrical insulators, paint brush manufacturing, [[fibre-reinforced plastic|fiber-reinforced plastic]] materials, and [[adhesive]]s for structural and other purposes.\n\n== Epoxy resins (prepolymers and monomers) ==\nMost of the commercially used epoxy monomers are produced by the reaction of a compound with [[Hydroxy group|acidic hydroxy groups]] and [[epichlorohydrin]]:\n\n:[[File:Synthesis epoxide Epichlorohydrin.svg|400px|First the hydroxy group reacts in a coupling reaction with epichlorohydrin, followed by dehydrohalogenation.]]\n:<small>First a hydroxy group reacts in a coupling reaction with epichlorohydrin, followed by [[dehydrohalogenation]].</small>\n\nEpoxy resins produced from such epoxy monomers are called [[Glycidol|glycidyl]]-based epoxy resins. The hydroxy group may be derived from [[aliphatic diol]]s, [[polyol]]s (polyether polyols), [[phenolic compounds]] or [[dicarboxylic acid]]s. Phenols can be compounds such as [[bisphenol A]] and [[novolak]]. Polyols can be compounds such as [[1,4-Butanediol|1,4-butanediol]]. Di- and polyols lead to diglycid polyethers. Dicarboxylic acids such as hexahydrophthalic acid are used for diglycide ester resins. Instead of a hydroxy group, also the nitrogen atom of an [[amine]] or [[amide]] can be  reacted with epichlorohydrin.\n\nThe other production route for epoxy resins is the conversion of [[Aliphatic alkene|aliphatic]] or [[cycloaliphatic alkene]]s with [[peracid]]s:<ref name=\"Ullmann\" /><ref name=\"KunstChem\">[[Wolfgang Kaiser (Chemiker)|Wolfgang Kaiser]]: ''Kunststoffchemie f\u00fcr Ingenieure.'' 3. Aufl.

Bisphenol A-based resins are the most widely commercialised resins but also other [[Bisphenol|bisphenols]] are analogously reacted with epichlorohydrin, for example [[Bisphenol F]].\n\n:[[File:Diglycidether.svg|400px|Synthesis of bisphenol A diglycidyl ether.]]\n:<small>In this two-stage reaction, epichlorohydrin is first added to bisphenol A (bis(3-chloro-2-hydroxy-propoxy)bisphenol A is formed), then a bisepoxide is formed in a condensation reaction with a stoichiometric amount of sodium hydroxide. The chlorine atom is released as [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl), the hydrogen atom as of water.</small>\n\nHigher molecular weight diglycidyl ethers (n \u2265 1) are formed by the reaction of the bisphenol A diglycidyl ether formed with further bisphenol A, this is called prepolymerization:\n\n:[[File:Synthesis Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether higher Mw.svg|600px|Synthesis of bisphenol-A-diglycidyl ether with a high [[molar mass]].]]\n\nA product comprising a few repeat units (''n'' = 1 to 2) is a viscous, clear liquid; this is called a liquid epoxy resin. A product comprising more repeating units (''n'' = 2 to 30) is at room temperature a colourless solid, which is correspondingly referred to as solid epoxy resin.\n\nInstead of bisphenol A, other bisphenols (especially [[bisphenol F]]) or brominated bisphenols (e. g. [[tetrabromobisphenol A]]) can be used for the said [[epoxidation]] and prepolymerisation. [[Bisphenol F]] may undergo epoxy resin formation in a similar fashion to bisphenol A. These resins typically have lower viscosity and a higher mean epoxy content per gram than bisphenol A resins, which (once cured) gives them increased chemical resistance.\n\nImportant epoxy resins are produced from combining [[epichlorohydrin]] and [[bisphenol A]] to give [[bisphenol A diglycidyl ether]]s.\n[[File:Epoxy prepolymer chemical structure.png|thumb|300px|Structure of bisphenol-A diglycidyl ether epoxy resin: ''n'' denotes the number of polymerized subunits and is typically in the range from 0 to 25]]\nIncreasing the ratio of bisphenol A to epichlorohydrin during manufacture produces higher molecular weight linear polyethers with glycidyl end groups, which are semi-solid to hard crystalline materials at room temperature depending on the molecular weight achieved. This route of synthesis is known as the \"taffy\" process. More modern manufacturing methods of higher molecular weight epoxy resins is to start with liquid epoxy resin (LER) and add a calculated amount of bisphenol A and then a catalyst is added and the reaction heated to circa {{convert|160|C|F}}. This process is known as \"advancement\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5521261.pdf |title=Epoxy resin mixtures containing advancement catalysts |website=freepatentsonline.com |language=en |access-date=2018-08-29}}</ref>  As the molecular weight of the resin increases, the epoxide content reduces and the material behaves more and more like a [[thermoplastic]]. Very high molecular weight polycondensates (ca. 30 000 \u2013 70 000 g/mol) form a class known as phenoxy resins and contain virtually no epoxide groups (since the terminal epoxy groups are insignificant compared to the total size of the molecule). These resins do however contain hydroxyl groups throughout the backbone, which may also undergo other cross-linking reactions, e.g. with aminoplasts, phenoplasts and [[isocyanate]]s.\n\nEpoxy resins are polymeric or semi-polymeric materials or an [[oligomer]], and as such rarely exist as pure substances, since variable chain length results from the polymerisation reaction used to produce them. High purity grades can be produced for certain applications, e.g. using a distillation purification process. One downside of high purity liquid grades is their tendency to form crystalline solids due to their highly regular structure, which then require melting to enable processing.\n\nAn important criterion for epoxy resins is the epoxide group content. This is expressed as the \"'''epoxide equivalent weight'''\", which is the ratio between the molecular weight of the monomer and the number of epoxide groups.\nThis parameter is used to calculate the mass of co-reactant (hardener) to use when curing epoxy resins. Epoxies are typically cured with [[stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] or near-stoichiometric quantities of hardener to achieve the best physical properties.\n\n===Novolac epoxy resin===\n[[File:Epoxyphenol-Novolak.svg|thumb|General structure of epoxyphenol novolak with ''n'' usually in the range from 0 to 4. The compound is present in the form of various [[Structural isomer|constitutional isomers]].]]\n\nNovolaks are produced by reacting [[phenol]] with [[methanal]] (formaldehyde). The reaction of [[epichlorohydrin]] and [[novolak]]s produces novolaks with [[Glycidol|glycidyl residues]], such as epoxyphenol novolak (EPN) or epoxycresol novolak (ECN). These highly viscous to solid resins typically carry 2 to 6 epoxy groups per molecule. By curing, highly cross-linked polymers with high temperature and chemical resistance but low mechanical flexibility are formed due to the high functionality of these resins.<ref name=\"Ullmann\">{{cite journal |author = Ha Q.

They are produced by the reaction of a cyclic alkene with a [[peracid]] (see above).<ref>L. Hammerton, ed. by Rebecca Dolbey: ''Recent Developments in Epoxy Resins.'' RAPRA Review Reports, 1996, {{ISBN|978-1-85957-083-8}}, S.&nbsp;8.</ref>  Cycloaliphatic epoxides are characterised by their aliphatic structure, high oxirane content and the absence of chlorine, which results in low viscosity and (once cured) good weather resistance, low dielectric constants and high [[Glass transition|T<sub>g</sub>]]. However, aliphatic epoxy resins polymerize very slowly at room temperature, so higher temperatures and suitable accelerators are usually required. Because aliphatic epoxies have a lower electron density than aromatics, cycloaliphatic epoxies react less readily with nucleophiles than bisphenol A-based epoxy resins (which have aromatic ether groups). This means that conventional nucleophilic hardeners such as amines are hardly suitable for crosslinking. Cycloaliphatic epoxides are therefore usually homopolymerized thermally or UV-initiated in an electrophilic or cationic reaction. Due to the low dielectric constants and the absence of chlorine, cycloaliphatic epoxides are often used to encapsulate electronic systems, such as microchips or LEDs. They are also used for radiation-cured paints and varnishes. Due to their high price, however, their use has so far been limited to such applications.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nEpoxidized vegetable oils are formed by epoxidation of [[unsaturated fatty acids]] by reaction with peracids. In this case, the peracids can also be formed in situ by reacting carboxylic acids with hydrogen peroxide. Compared with LERs (liquid epoxy resins) they have very low viscosities. If, however, they are used in larger proportions as [[reactive diluent]]s, this often leads to reduced chemical and thermal resistance and to poorer mechanical properties of the cured epoxides. Large scale epoxidized vegetable oils such as epoxidized soy and lens oils are used to a large extent as secondary plasticizers and cost stabilizers for [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]].<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nAliphatic glycidyl epoxy resins of low molar mass (mono-, bi- or polyfunctional) are formed by the reaction of epichlorohydrin with aliphatic alcohols or polyols (glycidyl ethers are formed) or with aliphatic carboxylic acids (glycidyl esters are formed). The reaction is carried out in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide, analogous to the formation of bisphenol A-diglycidyl ether. Also aliphatic glycidyl epoxy resins usually have a low viscosity compared to aromatic epoxy resins. They are therefore added to other epoxy resins as [[reactive diluent]]s or as [[adhesion promoter]]s. Epoxy resins made of (long-chain) polyols are also added to improve tensile strength and impact strength.\n\nA related class is cycloaliphatic epoxy resin, which contains one or more cycloaliphatic rings in the molecule (e.g. 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3,4-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate). This class also displays lower viscosity at room temperature, but offers significantly higher temperature resistance than the aliphatic epoxy diluents. However, reactivity is rather low compared to other classes of epoxy resin, and high temperature curing using suitable accelerators is normally required. As aromaticity is not present in these materials as it is in Bisphenol A and F resins, the UV stability is considerably improved.\n\n=== Halogenated epoxy resins ===\nHalogenated epoxy resins are admixed for special properties, in particular brominated and fluorinated epoxy resins are used.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nBrominated bisphenol A is used when flame retardant properties are required, such as in some electrical applications (e.g. [[printed circuit board]]s). The tetrabrominated bisphenol A (TBBPA, 2,2-bis(3,5-dibromophenyl)propane) or its diglycidyl ether, 2,2-bis[3,5-dibromo-4-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)phenyl]propane, can be added to the epoxy [[formulation]]. The formulation may then be reacted in the same way as pure bisphenol A. Some (non-crosslinked) epoxy resins with very high molar mass are added to engineering thermoplastics, again to achieve flame retardant properties.\n\nFluorinated epoxy resins have been investigated for some [[High-performance plastics|high performance applications]], such as the fluorinated diglycidether 5-heptafluoropropyl-1,3-bis[2-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)hexafluoro-2-propyl]benzene. As it has a low surface tension, it is added as a wetting agent (surfactant) for contact with glass fibres. Its reactivity to hardeners is comparable to that of bisphenol A. When cured, the epoxy resin leads to a thermosetting plastic with high chemical resistance and low water absorption. However, the commercial use of fluorinated epoxy resins is limited by their high cost and low T<sub>g</sub>.\n\n===Epoxy resin diluents===\nEpoxy resins diluents are typically formed by glycidylation of aliphatic alcohols or polyols. The resulting materials may be monofunctional (e.g. dodecanol glycidyl ether), difunctional (butanediol diglycidyl ether), or higher functionality (e.g. trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether). These resins typically display low viscosity at room temperature (10-200 mPa.s) and are often referred to as [[reactive diluent]]s. They are rarely used alone, but are rather employed to modify (reduce) the viscosity of other epoxy resins. This has led to the term \u2018modified epoxy resin\u2019 to denote those containing viscosity-lowering reactive diluents.\n\n===Glycidylamine epoxy resin===\nGlycidylamine epoxy resins are higher functionality epoxies which are formed when aromatic amines are reacted with epichlorohydrin. Important industrial grades are triglycidyl-''p''-aminophenol (functionality 3) and ''N'',''N'',''N''\u2032,''N''\u2032-tetraglycidyl-bis-(4-aminophenyl)-methane (functionality 4). The resins are low to medium viscosity at room temperature, which makes them easier to process than EPN or ECN resins. This coupled with high reactivity, plus high temperature resistance and mechanical properties of the resulting cured network makes them important materials for aerospace composite applications.\n\n==Curing epoxy resins==\n[[File:VernetzteEpoxidharze.svg|thumb|320px|right|Structure of a cured epoxy glue. The triamine hardener is shown in red, the resin in black. The resin's epoxide groups have reacted with the hardener and are not present anymore. The material is highly [[crosslink]]ed and contains many OH groups, which confer adhesive properties.]]\nIn general, uncured epoxy resins have only poor mechanical, chemical and heat resistance properties. However, good properties are obtained by reacting the linear epoxy resin with suitable curatives to form three-dimensional cross-linked thermoset structures. This process is commonly referred to as curing or gelation process.<ref name=\"onepetro.org\">Hakiki, Farizal et al. (2015).

SPE/IATMI Asia Pacific Oil & Gas Conference and Exhibition, 20\u201322 October, Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia. doi: [https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-176457-MS 10.2118/176457-MS]</ref> Curing of epoxy resins is an [[exothermic reaction]] and in some cases produces sufficient heat to cause thermal degradation if not controlled.\n\nCuring may be achieved by reacting an epoxy with itself (homopolymerisation) or by forming a [[copolymer]] with polyfunctional curatives or '''hardeners'''. In principle, any molecule containing a reactive hydrogen may react with the epoxide groups of the epoxy resin. Common classes of hardeners for epoxy resins include amines, acids, acid anhydrides, phenols, alcohols and thiols. Relative reactivity (lowest first) is approximately in the order: phenol < anhydride < aromatic amine < cycloaliphatic amine < aliphatic amine < thiol.\n\nWhile some epoxy resin/ hardener combinations will cure at ambient temperature, many require heat, with temperatures up to {{cvt|150|C}} being common, and up to {{cvt|200|C}} for some specialist systems. Insufficient heat during cure will result in a network with incomplete polymerisation, and thus reduced mechanical, chemical and heat resistance. Cure temperature should typically attain the [[glass transition]] temperature (Tg) of the fully cured network in order to achieve maximum properties. Temperature is sometimes increased in a step-wise fashion to control the rate of curing and prevent excessive heat build-up from the exothermic reaction.\n\nHardeners which show only low or limited reactivity at ambient temperature, but which react with epoxy resins at elevated temperature are referred to as '''latent hardeners'''. When using latent hardeners, the epoxy resin and hardener may be mixed and stored for some time prior to use, which is advantageous for many industrial processes. Very latent hardeners enable one-component (1K) products to be produced, whereby the resin and hardener are supplied pre-mixed to the end user and only require heat to initiate curing. One-component products generally have shorter shelf-lives than standard 2-component systems, and products may require cooled storage and transport.\n\nThe epoxy curing reaction may be accelerated by addition of small quantities of [[accelerant|accelerators]]. Tertiary amines, carboxylic acids and alcohols (especially phenols) are effective accelerators. Bisphenol A is a highly effective and widely used accelerator, but is now increasingly replaced due to health concerns with this substance.\n\n===Homopolymerisation===\nEpoxy resin may be reacted with itself in the presence of an anionic catalyst (a Lewis base such as tertiary amines or imidazoles) or a cationic catalyst (a Lewis acid such as a boron trifluoride complex) to form a cured network. This process is known as catalytic homopolymerisation. The resulting network contains only ether bridges, and exhibits high thermal and chemical resistance, but is brittle and often requires elevated temperature for the curing process, so finds only niche applications industrially.\nEpoxy homopolymerisation is often used when there is a requirement for UV curing, since cationic UV catalysts may be employed (e.g. for [[UV coating]]s).\n\n===Amines===\nPolyfunctional primary amines form an important class of epoxy hardeners. Primary amines undergo an [[addition reaction]] with the epoxide group to form a hydroxyl group and a secondary amine. The secondary amine can further react with an epoxide to form a tertiary amine and an additional hydroxyl group. Kinetic studies have shown the reactivity of the primary amine to be approximately double that of the secondary amine. Use of a difunctional or polyfunctional amine forms a three-dimensional cross-linked network.\nAliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic amines are all employed as epoxy hardeners. Amine type hardeners will alter both the processing properties (viscosity, reactivity) and the final properties (mechanical, temperature and heat resistance) of the cured copolymer network. Thus amine structure is normally selected according to the application. Overall reactivity potential for different hardeners can roughly be ordered; aliphatic amines > cycloaliphatic amines > aromatic amines, though aliphatic amines with steric hindrance near the amino groups may react as slowly as some of the aromatic amines. Slower reactivity allows longer working times for processors. Temperature resistance generally increases in the same order, since aromatic amines form much more rigid structures than aliphatic amines. Aromatic amines were widely used as epoxy resin hardeners, due to the excellent end properties when mixed with a parent resin. Over the past few decades concern about the possible adverse health effects of many aromatic amines has led to increased use of aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amine alternatives. Amines are also blended, adducted and reacted to alter properties and these amine resins are more often used to cure epoxy resins than a pure amine such as TETA. increasingly, WATER BASED polyamines are also used to help reduce the toxicity profile among other reasons. \n[[File:N1,N1'-(ethane-1,2-diyl)bis(ethane-1,2-diamine) 200.svg|thumb|150px|Structure of [[Triethylenetetramine|TETA]], a typical hardener. The amine (NH2) groups react with the epoxide groups of the resin during polymerisation.]]\n\n===Anhydrides===\nEpoxy resins may be cured with cyclic anhydrides at elevated temperatures. Reaction occurs only after opening of the anhydride ring, e.g. by secondary hydroxyl groups in the epoxy resin. A possible side reaction may also occur between the epoxide and hydroxyl groups, but this may suppressed by addition of tertiary amines.\nThe low viscosity and high latency of anhydride hardeners makes them suitable for processing systems which require addition of mineral fillers prior to curing, e.g. for high voltage electrical insulators.\n\n===Phenols===\nPolyphenols, such as bisphenol A or novolacs can react with epoxy resins at elevated temperatures ({{cvt|130|-|180|C|disp=comma}}), normally in the presence of a catalyst. The resulting material has ether linkages and displays higher chemical and oxidation resistance than typically obtained by curing with amines or anhydrides. Since many novolacs are solids, this class of hardeners is often employed for [[powder coating]]s.\n\n===Thiols===\nAlso known as mercaptans, thiols contain a sulfur which reacts very readily with the epoxide group, even at ambient or sub-ambient temperatures. While the resulting network does not typically display high temperature or chemical resistance, the high reactivity of the thiol group makes it useful for applications where heated curing is not possible, or very fast cure is required e.g. for domestic DIY adhesives and chemical [[rock bolt]] [[Anchor bolt|anchors]]. Thiols have a characteristic odour, which can be detected in many two-component household adhesives.\n\n==History==\nCondensation of epoxides and amines was first reported and patented by Paul Schlack of Germany in 1934.<ref>P. Schlack, I. G. Farbenindustrie, German Patent 676 117 (1938), US Patent 2 136 928 (1938).</ref> Claims of discovery of bisphenol-A-based epoxy resins include [[Pierre Castan]]<ref>{{cite patent |country= US |inventor= Pierre Castan |assignee= DeVoe&nbsp;&&nbsp;Raynolds |number= 2444333 |gdate= 1948-06-29 |title= Process for the manufacture of thermosetting synthetic resins by the polymerization of alkylene oxide derivatives }}</ref> in 1943. Castan's work was licensed by [[Ciba Specialty Chemicals|Ciba]], Ltd. of Switzerland, which went on to become one of the three major epoxy resin producers worldwide. Ciba's epoxy business was spun off as Vantico in the late 1990s, which was subsequently sold in 2003 and became the Advanced Materials [[strategic business unit|business unit]] of [[Huntsman Corporation]] of the United States. In 1946, Sylvan Greenlee, working for the Devoe&nbsp;&&nbsp;Raynolds Company, patented resin derived from bisphenol-A and epichlorohydrin.<ref>{{cite patent |country= US |inventor= Sylvan Owen Greenlee |assignee= DeVoe&nbsp;&&nbsp;Raynolds |number= 2456408 |gdate= 1948-12-14 |title= Synthetic drying compositions }}</ref> Devoe&nbsp;&&nbsp;Raynolds, which was active in the early days of the epoxy resin industry, was sold to [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell Chemical]]; the division involved in this work was eventually sold, and via a series of other corporate transactions is now part of [[Hexion Inc.]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://epoxyflooringtech.com/history-of-epoxy-resin/|title=History of Epoxy Resin|website=epoxyflooringtech.com}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nThe applications for epoxy-based materials are extensive and include coatings, [[adhesive]]s and [[composite material]]s such as those using [[carbon fiber]] and [[fiberglass]] reinforcements (although [[polyester]], [[vinyl ester resin|vinyl ester]], and other [[thermosetting polymer|thermosetting]] [[resin]]s are also used for glass-reinforced plastic). The chemistry of epoxies and the range of commercially available variations allows cure polymers to be produced with a very broad range of properties. In general, epoxies are known for their excellent adhesion, chemical and heat resistance, good-to-excellent mechanical properties and very good [[Insulator (electrical)|electrical insulating]] properties. Many properties of epoxies can be modified (for example [[silver]]-filled epoxies with good [[electrical conductivity]] are available, although epoxies are typically electrically insulating). Variations offering high thermal insulation, or thermal conductivity combined with high electrical resistance for electronics applications, are available.<ref>{{cite book|last=May |first=Clayton A. |title=Epoxy Resins: Chemistry and Technology|publisher=Marcel Dekker Inc|location=New York|date=1987-12-23|edition=Second|page=794|isbn=0-8247-7690-9}}</ref>\n\nAs with other classes of thermoset polymer materials, blending different grades of epoxy resin, as well as use of additives, plasticizers or fillers is common to achieve the desired processing or final properties, or to reduce cost. Use of blending, additives and fillers is often referred to as '''formulating''' (see: [[formulation]].\n\n=== Paints and coatings ===\nTwo part epoxy coatings were developed for heavy duty service on metal substrates and use less energy than heat-cured [[powder coating]]s. These systems provide a tough, protective coating with excellent hardness. One part epoxy coatings are formulated as an emulsion in water, and can be cleaned up without solvents.\n\nEpoxy coatings are often used in industrial and automotive applications since they are more heat resistant than latex-based and alkyd-based paints. Epoxy paints tend to deteriorate, known as \"chalking out\", due to UV exposure.<ref>{{cite book|last= Bayliss |first= D.A. |title= Steelwork corrosion control |year= 2002 |publisher= Spon |location= London |isbn= 978-0-415-26101-2 |pages= 13.6.6 Chalking |edition= 2nd |author2=Deacon, D.H.}}</ref>\n\n[[Polyester]] epoxies are used as [[powder coating]]s for washers, driers and other \"white goods\". [[Fusion bonded epoxy coating|Fusion Bonded Epoxy Powder Coatings]] (FBE) are extensively used for corrosion protection of steel pipes and fittings used in the oil and gas industry, potable water transmission pipelines (steel), and concrete reinforcing [[rebar]]. Epoxy coatings are also widely used as [[Primer (paint)|primers]] to improve the adhesion of automotive and marine paints especially on metal surfaces where [[corrosion]] (rusting) resistance is important. Metal cans and containers are often coated with epoxy to prevent rusting, especially for foods like tomatoes that are [[acid]]ic. Epoxy resins are also used for decorative flooring applications such as [[terrazzo]] flooring, chip flooring, and colored aggregate flooring.\nEpoxies were modified in a variety of ways, Reacted with fatty acids derived from oils to yield epoxy esters, which were cured the same way as alkyds . Typical ones were L8(80% linseed, D4 (40% Dehydrated castor oil). These were often reacted with styrene to make styrenated epoxy esters, used as primers. Curing with phenolics to make drum linings, curing esters with amine resins and pre-curing epoxies with amino resins to make resistant top coats. \nOne of the best examples was a system of using solvent free epoxies for priming ships during construction, this used a system of hot airless spray with premixing at the head. This obviated the problem of solvent retention under the film, which caused adhesion problems later on.\n\n=== Adhesives ===<!-- [[Epoxy adhesive]] redirects here -->\n[[File:Titan epoxy.jpg|thumb|right|Special epoxy is strong enough to withstand the forces between a [[surfboard]] fin and the fin mount. This epoxy is waterproof and capable of [[Curing (chemistry)|curing]] underwater. The blue-coloured epoxy on the left is still undergoing curing.]]\n\nEpoxy [[adhesive]]s are a major part of the class of adhesives called \"structural adhesives\" or \"engineering adhesives\" (that includes [[polyurethane]], [[Acryloyl group|acrylic]], [[cyanoacrylate]], and other chemistries.) These high-performance adhesives are used in the construction of aircraft, automobiles, bicycles, boats, golf clubs, skis, snowboards, and other applications where high strength bonds are required. Epoxy adhesives can be developed to suit almost any application. They can be used as adhesives for wood, metal, glass, stone, and some plastics. They can be made flexible or rigid, [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] or [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]]/colored, fast setting or slow setting. Epoxy adhesives are better in heat and chemical resistance than other common adhesives. In general, epoxy adhesives cured with heat will be more heat- and chemical-resistant than those cured at room temperature. The strength of epoxy adhesives is degraded at temperatures above {{convert|350|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}.<ref name='jjmorena'>{{cite book|last=Morena |first=John J |title=Advanced Composite Mold Making|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold Co.

Such epoxies are commonly used in [[optics]], [[optical fiber|fiber optics]], and [[optoelectronics]].\n\n=== Industrial tooling and composites ===\nEpoxy systems are used in industrial tooling applications to produce [[Molding (process)|molds]], master models, [[laminate]]s, [[casting]]s, [[Fixture (tool)|fixtures]], and other industrial production aids. This \"plastic tooling\" replaces metal, wood and other traditional materials, and generally improves the efficiency and either lowers the overall cost or shortens the lead-time for many industrial processes. Epoxies are also used in producing fiber-reinforced or composite parts. They are more expensive than polyester resins and [[vinyl ester resin]]s, but usually produce stronger and more temperature-resistant [[thermoset polymer matrix]] composite parts.\n\n=== Wind Turbine Technology composites ===\nEpoxy resins are used as bonding matrix along with glass or carbon fiber fabrics to produce composites with very high strength to weight characteristics, allowing longer and more efficient rotor blades to be produced. In addition, for offshore and onshore wind energy installations, epoxy resins are used as protective coatings on steel towers, base struts and concrete foundations. Aliphatic polyurethane top coats are applied on top to ensure full UV protection, prolong operational lifetimes and lowering maintenance costs. Electric generators, connected via the drivetrain with the rotor blades, convert mechanical wind energy in usable electric energy, and rely on epoxies electrical insulation and high thermal resistance properties. The same applies to transformers, bushings, spacers, and composites cables connecting the windmills to the grid In Europe, wind energy components account for the largest segment of epoxy applications, about 27% of the market.<ref name=socio2013>[https://epoxy-europe.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Epoxy_Socioeconomic_Study_Main_Findings_August-2017.pdf Epoxy Resins Committee > Socioeconomic Analysis] 2013</ref>\n\n=== Electrical systems and electronics ===\n[[File:Hybridcircuit.jpg|thumb|An epoxy [[conformal coating|encapsulated]] [[hybrid circuit]] on a [[printed circuit board]].]]\n[[File:Citizen se-733 int 1ac.jpg|thumb|The interior of a pocket calculator. The dark lump of epoxy in the center covers the processor chip]]\n\nEpoxy resin formulations are important in the electronics industry, and are employed in motors, generators, transformers, switchgear, bushings, insulators, printed wiring boards (PWB), and semiconductor encapsulants. Epoxy resins are excellent electrical insulators and protect electrical components from short circuiting, dust and moisture. In the electronics industry epoxy resins are the primary resin used in overmolding [[integrated circuit]]s, [[transistor]]s and [[hybrid circuit]]s, and making [[printed circuit boards]]. The largest volume type of circuit board\u2014an \"[[FR-4]] board\"\u2014is a sandwich of layers of glass cloth bonded into a composite by an epoxy resin. Epoxy resins are used to bond copper foil to circuit board substrates, and are a component of the solder mask on many circuit boards.\n\nFlexible epoxy resins are used for [[Potting (electronics)|potting]] transformers and inductors. By using vacuum impregnation on uncured epoxy, winding-to-winding, winding-to-core, and winding-to-insulator air voids are eliminated. The cured epoxy is an electrical insulator and a much better conductor of heat than air. Transformer and inductor hot spots are greatly reduced, giving the component a stable and longer life than unpotted product.\n\nEpoxy resins are applied using the technology of [[resin dispensing]].\n\n=== Petroleum & petrochemical ===\nEpoxies can be used to plug selective layers in a reservoir which are producing excessive brine. The technique is named \"water shut-off treatment\".<ref name=\"onepetro.org\"/>\n\n=== Consumer and marine applications ===\nEpoxies are sold in hardware stores, typically as a pack containing separate resin and hardener, which must be mixed immediately before use. They are also sold in boat shops as repair resins for marine applications. Epoxies typically are not used in the outer layer of a boat because they deteriorate by exposure to [[UV]] light. They are often used during boat repair and assembly, and then over-coated with conventional or two-part polyurethane paint or marine-varnishes that provide UV protection.\n\nThere are two main areas of marine use. Because of the better mechanical properties relative to the more common [[polyester resins]], epoxies are used for commercial manufacture of components where a high strength/weight ratio is required. The second area is that their strength, gap filling properties and excellent adhesion to many materials including timber have created a boom in amateur building projects including aircraft and boats.\n\nNormal [[gelcoat]] formulated for use with [[polyester]] resins and vinylester resins does not adhere to epoxy surfaces, though epoxy adheres very well if applied to polyester resin surfaces. \"Flocoat\" that is normally used to coat the interior of polyester fibreglass yachts is also compatible with epoxies.\n\nEpoxy materials tend to harden somewhat more gradually, while polyester materials tend to harden quickly, particularly if a lot of catalyst is used.<ref>Hakiki, F., Nuraeni, N., Salam, D.D., Aditya, W., Akbari, A., Mazrad, Z.A.I. and Siregar, S. [http://archives.datapages.com/data/ipa_pdf/2015/ipa15-se-025.htm Preliminary Study on Epoxy-Based Polymer for Water Shut-Off Application]. Paper IPA15-SE-025. Proceeding of The 39th IPA Conference and Exhibition, Jakarta, Indonesia, May 2015.</ref> The chemical reactions in both cases are exothermic. Large quantities of mix will generate their own heat and greatly speed the reaction, so it is usual to mix small amounts which can be used quickly.\n\nWhile it is common to associate polyester resins and epoxy resins, their properties are sufficiently different that they are properly treated as distinct materials. Polyester resins are typically low strength unless used with a reinforcing material like glass fibre, are relatively brittle unless reinforced, and have low adhesion. Epoxies, by contrast, are inherently strong, somewhat flexible and have excellent adhesion. However, polyester resins are much cheaper.\n\nEpoxy resins typically require a precise mix of two components which form a third chemical. Depending on the properties required, the ratio may be anything from 1:1 or over 10:1, but in every case they must be mixed exactly. The final product is then a precise thermo-setting plastic. Until they are mixed the two elements are relatively inert, although the 'hardeners' tend to be more chemically active and should be protected from the atmosphere and moisture. The rate of the reaction can be changed by using different hardeners, which may change the nature of the final product, or by controlling the temperature.\n\nBy contrast, polyester resins are usually made available in a 'promoted' form, such that the progress of previously-mixed resins from liquid to solid is already underway, albeit very slowly. The only variable available to the user is to change the rate of this process using a catalyst, often Methyl-Ethyl-Ketone-Peroxide ([[MEKP]]), which is very toxic. The presence of the catalyst in the final product actually detracts from the desirable properties, so that small amounts of catalyst are preferable, so long as the hardening proceeds at an acceptable pace. The rate of cure of polyesters can therefore be controlled by the amount and type of catalyst as well as by the temperature.\n\nAs adhesives, epoxies bond in three ways: a) Mechanically, because the bonding surfaces are roughened; b) by proximity, because the cured resins are physically so close to the bonding surfaces that they are hard to separate; c) ionically, because the epoxy resins form ionic bonds at an atomic level with the bonding surfaces. This last is substantially the strongest of the three. By contrast, polyester resins can only bond using the first two of these, which greatly reduces their utility as adhesives and in marine repair.\n\n=== Aerospace applications ===\nIn the aerospace industry, epoxy is used as a structural matrix material which is then reinforced by fiber. Typical fiber reinforcements include [[glass]], [[carbon]], [[Kevlar]], and [[boron]].\nEpoxies are also used as a structural [[glue]]. Materials like [[wood]], and others that are 'low-tech' are glued with epoxy resin. Epoxies generally out-perform most other resin types in terms of mechanical properties and resistance to environmental degradation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://netcomposites.com/guide/resin-systems/epoxy-resins/ |title=Epoxy Resins |website=netcomposites.com |language=en |access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Biology ===\nWater-soluble epoxies such as [[Durcupan]]<ref>{{cite journal\n |title=A new embedding technique for electron microscopy, combining a water-soluble epoxy resin (Durcupan) with water-insoluble Araldite\n |author=St\u00e4ubli, W.\n |journal=The Journal of Cell Biology\n |volume=16\n |issue=1\n |pages=197\n |year=1963\n |publisher=Rockefeller Univ Press\n |url=http://jcb.rupress.org/content/16/1/197.full.pdf\n |doi=10.1083/jcb.16.1.197|pmc=2106182\n |pmid=13978678\n }}\n</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n |title=A Modification of the Water-miscible Epoxy Resin \"Durcupan\" Embedding Method for Ultrathin Sectioning\n |author=Kushida, H.\n |journal=Journal of Electron Microscopy\n |volume=12\n |issue=1\n |pages=72\n |year=1963\n |publisher=Japan Society Microscopy\n |url=http://jmicro.oxfordjournals.org/content/12/1/72.extract }}\n</ref>\nare commonly used for [[electron microscope#Sample preparation|embedding]]\n[[electron microscope]] samples in plastic so they may be sectioned (sliced thin) with a [[microtome]] and then imaged.<ref>{{Cite news\n |title=Improvements in epoxy resin embedding methods\n |author=Luft, J.H.\n |journal=The Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology\n |volume=9\n |issue=2\n |pages=409\n |year=1961\n |publisher=Rockefeller Univ Press\n |url=http://jcb.rupress.org/content/9/2/409.full.pdf }}\n</ref>\n\n===Art===\nEpoxy resin, mixed with [[pigment]], may be used as a painting [[Media (arts)#Painting|medium]], by pouring layers on top of each other to form a complete picture.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCreight|first1=Tim|last2=Bsullak|first2=Nicole|title=Color on Metal: 50 Artists Share Insights and Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7nBQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PP1|year=2001|publisher=Guild Pub.|isbn=978-1-893164-06-2}}</ref> It is also used in jewelry, as a doming resin for decorations and labels, and in decoupage type applications for art, countertops, and tables.\n\n== Industry ==\nThe global epoxy resin market was valued at approximately $8 billion in 2016. The epoxy resin market is dominated by the Asia-Pacific region, which contributes 55.2% of the total market share. China is the major producer and consumer globally, consuming almost 35% of the global resin production. The global market is made up of approximately 50\u2013100 manufacturers of basic or commodity epoxy resins and hardeners. In Europe, about 323,000 tonnes of epoxy resin were manufactured in 2017 generating some \u20ac1,055 million in sales. Germany <ref name=socio2013 />  is the largest market for epoxy resins in Europe, followed by Italy, France, the UK, Spain, the Netherlands and Austria.\n\nThese commodity epoxy [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]] mentioned above typically do not sell epoxy resins in a form usable to smaller end users, so there is another group of companies that purchase epoxy raw materials from the major producers and then compounds (blends, modifies, or otherwise customizes) epoxy systems from these [[raw material]]s. These companies are known as \"formulators\". The majority of the epoxy systems sold are produced by these formulators and they comprise over 60% of the dollar value of the epoxy market. There are hundreds of ways that these formulators can modify epoxies\u2014by adding [[mineral]] fillers ([[talc]], [[silica]], [[alumina]], etc.), by adding flexibilizers, [[viscosity]] reducers, [[colorant]]s, thickeners, accelerators, [[adhesion]] promoters, etc. These modifications are made to reduce costs, to improve performance, and to improve processing convenience. As a result, a typical formulator sells dozens or even thousands of formulations\u2014each tailored to the requirements of a particular application or market.\n\nThe raw materials for epoxy resin production are today largely [[petroleum]] derived, although some plant derived sources are now becoming commercially available (e.g. plant derived glycerol used to make [[epichlorohydrin]]).\n\n== Health risks ==\nThe primary risk associated with epoxy use is often related to the hardener component and not to the epoxy resin itself. Amine hardeners in particular are generally [[corrosive]], but may also be classed as [[toxic]] or [[carcinogenic]]/[[mutagenic]]. Aromatic amines present a particular health hazard (most are known or suspected carcinogens), but their use is now restricted to specific industrial applications, and safer aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amines are commonly employed.\n\nLiquid epoxy resins in their uncured state are mostly classed as [[Irritation|irritant]] to the eyes and skin, as well as toxic to aquatic organisms. Solid epoxy resins are generally safer than liquid epoxy resins, and many are classified non-hazardous materials. One particular risk associated with epoxy resins is sensitization. The risk has been shown to be more pronounced in epoxy resins containing low molecular weight epoxy diluents.<ref>[http://www.hse.gov.uk/research/rrpdf/rr079.pdf] An assessment of skin sensitisation by the use of epoxy resin in the construction industry, 2003</ref> Exposure to epoxy resins can, over time, induce an [[Allergy|allergic reaction]]. Sensitization generally occurs due to repeated exposure (e.g. through poor working hygiene or lack of protective equipment) over a long period of time. Allergic reaction sometimes occurs at a time which is delayed several days from the exposure. Allergic reaction is often visible in the form of [[dermatitis]], particularly in areas where the exposure has been highest (commonly hands and forearms). Epoxy use is a main source of [[occupational asthma]] among users of plastics.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/occupational-asthma/DS00591/DSECTION=risk-factors MayoClinic --> Occupational asthma] May 23, 2009</ref> [[Bisphenol A]], which is used to manufacture a common class of epoxy resins, is a known [[endocrine disruptor]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Thermosetting polymer]]\n* [[Thermoset polymer matrix]]\n* [[Plastic]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wiktionary}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060220105252/http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ohb/HESIS/epoxy.htm Epoxy Resin health hazards] (California Department of Health Services) 21 April 2008 @ [[Wayback Machine]] [https://epoxi.es/2HfHeiX https://web.archive.org/web/20080421095718/http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ohb/HESIS/epoxy.htm]\n* [http://pslc.ws/macrog/epoxy.htm The chemistry of epoxide], simple to understand\n\n<!-- LocalWords: catalyzing epoxies -->\n\n[[Category:Organic polymers]]\n[[Category:Adhesives]]\n[[Category:Synthetic resins]]\n[[Category:Thermosetting plastics]]\n\n[[da:Kunstharpiks]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the thermoset plastic materials|the chemical group|epoxide}}\n{{citations needed|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:FiveMinEpoxy.jpg|thumb|A syringe of \"5-minute\" epoxy glue, containing separate compartments for the epoxy resin and the hardener.]]\n[[File:Epoxide_generic.png|thumb|Structure of the epoxide group, a reactive functional group present in all epoxy resins.]]\n'''Epoxy''' refers to any of the basic components or [[Curing (chemistry)|cured]] end products of '''epoxy resins''', as well as a colloquial name for the [[epoxide]] functional group.<ref name=\"May2018\">{{cite book |author=Clayton May |title=Epoxy Resins: Chemistry and Technology (Second Edition) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1XlaDwAAQBAJ&pg=RA2-PA64&lpg=RA2-PA64&focus=viewport&vq=%22Epoxies+are+the+resins+most+commonly+employed%22&dq=may+Epoxy+Resins:+Chemistry+and+Technology+Second+Edition,+%22Epoxies+are+the+resins+most+commonly+employed+for+electrical+and+electronic+applications%22#v=onepage&q=%22Epoxies%20are%20the%20resins%20most%20commonly%20employed%22&f=false |date=11 May 2018 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-1-351-44995-3 |page=65 |quote=Epoxies are the resins most commonly employed for electrical and electronic applications.

These co-reactants are often referred to as hardeners or curatives, and the cross-linking reaction is commonly referred to as curing.\n\nReaction of polyepoxides with themselves or with polyfunctional hardeners forms a [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset]]ting [[polymer]], often with favorable mechanical properties and high thermal and chemical resistance. Epoxy has a wide range of applications, including metal coatings, use in electronics/electrical components/LEDs, high tension electrical insulators, paint brush manufacturing, [[fibre-reinforced plastic|fiber-reinforced plastic]] materials, and [[adhesive]]s for structural and other purposes.\n\n== Epoxy resins (prepolymers and monomers) ==\nMost of the commercially used epoxy monomers are produced by the reaction of a compound with [[Hydroxy group|acidic hydroxy groups]] and [[epichlorohydrin]]:\n\n:[[File:Synthesis epoxide Epichlorohydrin.svg|400px|First the hydroxy group reacts in a coupling reaction with epichlorohydrin, followed by dehydrohalogenation.]]\n:<small>First a hydroxy group reacts in a coupling reaction with epichlorohydrin, followed by [[dehydrohalogenation]].</small>\n\nEpoxy resins produced from such epoxy monomers are called [[Glycidol|glycidyl]]-based epoxy resins. The hydroxy group may be derived from [[aliphatic diol]]s, [[polyol]]s (polyether polyols), [[phenolic compounds]] or [[dicarboxylic acid]]s. Phenols can be compounds such as [[bisphenol A]] and [[novolak]]. Polyols can be compounds such as [[1,4-Butanediol|1,4-butanediol]]. Di- and polyols lead to diglycid polyethers. Dicarboxylic acids such as hexahydrophthalic acid are used for diglycide ester resins. Instead of a hydroxy group, also the nitrogen atom of an [[amine]] or [[amide]] can be  reacted with epichlorohydrin.\n\nThe other production route for epoxy resins is the conversion of [[Aliphatic alkene|aliphatic]] or [[cycloaliphatic alkene]]s with [[peracid]]s:<ref name=\"Ullmann\" /><ref name=\"KunstChem\">[[Wolfgang Kaiser (Chemiker)|Wolfgang Kaiser]]: ''Kunststoffchemie f\u00fcr Ingenieure.'' 3.

Bisphenol A-based resins are the most widely commercialised resins but also other [[Bisphenol|bisphenols]] are analogously reacted with epichlorohydrin, for example [[Bisphenol F]].\n\n:[[File:Diglycidether.svg|400px|Synthesis of bisphenol A diglycidyl ether.]]\n:<small>In this two-stage reaction, epichlorohydrin is first added to bisphenol A (bis(3-chloro-2-hydroxy-propoxy)bisphenol A is formed), then a bisepoxide is formed in a condensation reaction with a stoichiometric amount of sodium hydroxide. The chlorine atom is released as [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl), the hydrogen atom as of water.</small>\n\nHigher molecular weight diglycidyl ethers (n \u2265 1) are formed by the reaction of the bisphenol A diglycidyl ether formed with further bisphenol A, this is called prepolymerization:\n\n:[[File:Synthesis Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether higher Mw.svg|600px|Synthesis of bisphenol-A-diglycidyl ether with a high [[molar mass]].]]\n\nA product comprising a few repeat units (''n'' = 1 to 2) is a viscous, clear liquid; this is called a liquid epoxy resin. A product comprising more repeating units (''n'' = 2 to 30) is at room temperature a colourless solid, which is correspondingly referred to as solid epoxy resin.\n\nInstead of bisphenol A, other bisphenols (especially [[bisphenol F]]) or brominated bisphenols (e. g. [[tetrabromobisphenol A]]) can be used for the said [[epoxidation]] and prepolymerisation. [[Bisphenol F]] may undergo epoxy resin formation in a similar fashion to bisphenol A. These resins typically have lower viscosity and a higher mean epoxy content per gram than bisphenol A resins, which (once cured) gives them increased chemical resistance.\n\nImportant epoxy resins are produced from combining [[epichlorohydrin]] and [[bisphenol A]] to give [[bisphenol A diglycidyl ether]]s.\n[[File:Epoxy prepolymer chemical structure.png|thumb|300px|Structure of bisphenol-A diglycidyl ether epoxy resin: ''n'' denotes the number of polymerized subunits and is typically in the range from 0 to 25]]\nIncreasing the ratio of bisphenol A to epichlorohydrin during manufacture produces higher molecular weight linear polyethers with glycidyl end groups, which are semi-solid to hard crystalline materials at room temperature depending on the molecular weight achieved. This route of synthesis is known as the \"taffy\" process. More modern manufacturing methods of higher molecular weight epoxy resins is to start with liquid epoxy resin (LER) and add a calculated amount of bisphenol A and then a catalyst is added and the reaction heated to circa {{convert|160|C|F}}. This process is known as \"advancement\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5521261.pdf |title=Epoxy resin mixtures containing advancement catalysts |website=freepatentsonline.com |language=en |access-date=2018-08-29}}</ref>  As the molecular weight of the resin increases, the epoxide content reduces and the material behaves more and more like a [[thermoplastic]]. Very high molecular weight polycondensates (ca. 30 000 \u2013 70 000 g/mol) form a class known as phenoxy resins and contain virtually no epoxide groups (since the terminal epoxy groups are insignificant compared to the total size of the molecule). These resins do however contain hydroxyl groups throughout the backbone, which may also undergo other cross-linking reactions, e.g. with aminoplasts, phenoplasts and [[isocyanate]]s.\n\nEpoxy resins are polymeric or semi-polymeric materials or an [[oligomer]], and as such rarely exist as pure substances, since variable chain length results from the polymerisation reaction used to produce them. High purity grades can be produced for certain applications, e.g. using a distillation purification process. One downside of high purity liquid grades is their tendency to form crystalline solids due to their highly regular structure, which then require melting to enable processing.\n\nAn important criterion for epoxy resins is the epoxide group content. This is expressed as the \"'''epoxide equivalent weight'''\", which is the ratio between the molecular weight of the monomer and the number of epoxide groups.\nThis parameter is used to calculate the mass of co-reactant (hardener) to use when curing epoxy resins. Epoxies are typically cured with [[stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] or near-stoichiometric quantities of hardener to achieve the best physical properties.\n\n===Novolac epoxy resin===\n[[File:Epoxyphenol-Novolak.svg|thumb|General structure of epoxyphenol novolak with ''n'' usually in the range from 0 to 4. The compound is present in the form of various [[Structural isomer|constitutional isomers]].]]\n\nNovolaks are produced by reacting [[phenol]] with [[methanal]] (formaldehyde). The reaction of [[epichlorohydrin]] and [[novolak]]s produces novolaks with [[Glycidol|glycidyl residues]], such as epoxyphenol novolak (EPN) or epoxycresol novolak (ECN). These highly viscous to solid resins typically carry 2 to 6 epoxy groups per molecule. By curing, highly cross-linked polymers with high temperature and chemical resistance but low mechanical flexibility are formed due to the high functionality of these resins.<ref name=\"Ullmann\">{{cite journal |author = Ha Q. Pham, Maurice J.

These are highly viscous to solid resins with typical mean epoxide functionality of around 2 to 6. The high epoxide functionality of these resins forms a highly crosslinked polymer network displaying high temperature and chemical resistance, but low flexibility.\n\n=== Aliphatic epoxy resins ===\nThere are two common types of aliphatic epoxy resins: those obtained by epoxidation of double bonds (cycloaliphatic epoxides and epoxidized vegetable oils) and those formed by reaction with epichlorohydrin (glycidyl ethers and esters).\n\n[[File:Diepoxyester.svg|thumb|Structural formula of [[3,4-Epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3\u2019,4\u2019-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate]]]]\n\nCycloaliphatic epoxides contain one or more aliphatic rings in the molecule on which the oxirane ring is contained (e.g. [[3,4-Epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3\u2019,4\u2019-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate|3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3',4'-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate]]). They are produced by the reaction of a cyclic alkene with a [[peracid]] (see above).<ref>L. Hammerton, ed. by Rebecca Dolbey: ''Recent Developments in Epoxy Resins.'' RAPRA Review Reports, 1996, {{ISBN|978-1-85957-083-8}}, S.&nbsp;8.</ref>  Cycloaliphatic epoxides are characterised by their aliphatic structure, high oxirane content and the absence of chlorine, which results in low viscosity and (once cured) good weather resistance, low dielectric constants and high [[Glass transition|T<sub>g</sub>]]. However, aliphatic epoxy resins polymerize very slowly at room temperature, so higher temperatures and suitable accelerators are usually required. Because aliphatic epoxies have a lower electron density than aromatics, cycloaliphatic epoxies react less readily with nucleophiles than bisphenol A-based epoxy resins (which have aromatic ether groups). This means that conventional nucleophilic hardeners such as amines are hardly suitable for crosslinking. Cycloaliphatic epoxides are therefore usually homopolymerized thermally or UV-initiated in an electrophilic or cationic reaction. Due to the low dielectric constants and the absence of chlorine, cycloaliphatic epoxides are often used to encapsulate electronic systems, such as microchips or LEDs. They are also used for radiation-cured paints and varnishes. Due to their high price, however, their use has so far been limited to such applications.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nEpoxidized vegetable oils are formed by epoxidation of [[unsaturated fatty acids]] by reaction with peracids. In this case, the peracids can also be formed in situ by reacting carboxylic acids with hydrogen peroxide. Compared with LERs (liquid epoxy resins) they have very low viscosities. If, however, they are used in larger proportions as [[reactive diluent]]s, this often leads to reduced chemical and thermal resistance and to poorer mechanical properties of the cured epoxides. Large scale epoxidized vegetable oils such as epoxidized soy and lens oils are used to a large extent as secondary plasticizers and cost stabilizers for [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]].<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nAliphatic glycidyl epoxy resins of low molar mass (mono-, bi- or polyfunctional) are formed by the reaction of epichlorohydrin with aliphatic alcohols or polyols (glycidyl ethers are formed) or with aliphatic carboxylic acids (glycidyl esters are formed). The reaction is carried out in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide, analogous to the formation of bisphenol A-diglycidyl ether. Also aliphatic glycidyl epoxy resins usually have a low viscosity compared to aromatic epoxy resins. They are therefore added to other epoxy resins as [[reactive diluent]]s or as [[adhesion promoter]]s. Epoxy resins made of (long-chain) polyols are also added to improve tensile strength and impact strength.\n\nA related class is cycloaliphatic epoxy resin, which contains one or more cycloaliphatic rings in the molecule (e.g. 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3,4-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate). This class also displays lower viscosity at room temperature, but offers significantly higher temperature resistance than the aliphatic epoxy diluents. However, reactivity is rather low compared to other classes of epoxy resin, and high temperature curing using suitable accelerators is normally required. As aromaticity is not present in these materials as it is in Bisphenol A and F resins, the UV stability is considerably improved.\n\n=== Halogenated epoxy resins ===\nHalogenated epoxy resins are admixed for special properties, in particular brominated and fluorinated epoxy resins are used.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nBrominated bisphenol A is used when flame retardant properties are required, such as in some electrical applications (e.g. [[printed circuit board]]s). The tetrabrominated bisphenol A (TBBPA, 2,2-bis(3,5-dibromophenyl)propane) or its diglycidyl ether, 2,2-bis[3,5-dibromo-4-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)phenyl]propane, can be added to the epoxy [[formulation]]. The formulation may then be reacted in the same way as pure bisphenol A. Some (non-crosslinked) epoxy resins with very high molar mass are added to engineering thermoplastics, again to achieve flame retardant properties.\n\nFluorinated epoxy resins have been investigated for some [[High-performance plastics|high performance applications]], such as the fluorinated diglycidether 5-heptafluoropropyl-1,3-bis[2-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)hexafluoro-2-propyl]benzene. As it has a low surface tension, it is added as a wetting agent (surfactant) for contact with glass fibres. Its reactivity to hardeners is comparable to that of bisphenol A. When cured, the epoxy resin leads to a thermosetting plastic with high chemical resistance and low water absorption. However, the commercial use of fluorinated epoxy resins is limited by their high cost and low T<sub>g</sub>.\n\n===Epoxy resin diluents===\nEpoxy resins diluents are typically formed by glycidylation of aliphatic alcohols or polyols. The resulting materials may be monofunctional (e.g. dodecanol glycidyl ether), difunctional (butanediol diglycidyl ether), or higher functionality (e.g. trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether). These resins typically display low viscosity at room temperature (10-200 mPa.s) and are often referred to as [[reactive diluent]]s. They are rarely used alone, but are rather employed to modify (reduce) the viscosity of other epoxy resins. This has led to the term \u2018modified epoxy resin\u2019 to denote those containing viscosity-lowering reactive diluents.\n\n===Glycidylamine epoxy resin===\nGlycidylamine epoxy resins are higher functionality epoxies which are formed when aromatic amines are reacted with epichlorohydrin. Important industrial grades are triglycidyl-''p''-aminophenol (functionality 3) and ''N'',''N'',''N''\u2032,''N''\u2032-tetraglycidyl-bis-(4-aminophenyl)-methane (functionality 4). The resins are low to medium viscosity at room temperature, which makes them easier to process than EPN or ECN resins. This coupled with high reactivity, plus high temperature resistance and mechanical properties of the resulting cured network makes them important materials for aerospace composite applications.\n\n==Curing epoxy resins==\n[[File:VernetzteEpoxidharze.svg|thumb|320px|right|Structure of a cured epoxy glue. The triamine hardener is shown in red, the resin in black. The resin's epoxide groups have reacted with the hardener and are not present anymore. The material is highly [[crosslink]]ed and contains many OH groups, which confer adhesive properties.]]\nIn general, uncured epoxy resins have only poor mechanical, chemical and heat resistance properties. However, good properties are obtained by reacting the linear epoxy resin with suitable curatives to form three-dimensional cross-linked thermoset structures. This process is commonly referred to as curing or gelation process.<ref name=\"onepetro.org\">Hakiki, Farizal et al. (2015).

SPE/IATMI Asia Pacific Oil & Gas Conference and Exhibition, 20\u201322 October, Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia. doi: [https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-176457-MS 10.2118/176457-MS]</ref> Curing of epoxy resins is an [[exothermic reaction]] and in some cases produces sufficient heat to cause thermal degradation if not controlled.\n\nCuring may be achieved by reacting an epoxy with itself (homopolymerisation) or by forming a [[copolymer]] with polyfunctional curatives or '''hardeners'''. In principle, any molecule containing a reactive hydrogen may react with the epoxide groups of the epoxy resin. Common classes of hardeners for epoxy resins include amines, acids, acid anhydrides, phenols, alcohols and thiols. Relative reactivity (lowest first) is approximately in the order: phenol < anhydride < aromatic amine < cycloaliphatic amine < aliphatic amine < thiol.\n\nWhile some epoxy resin/ hardener combinations will cure at ambient temperature, many require heat, with temperatures up to {{cvt|150|C}} being common, and up to {{cvt|200|C}} for some specialist systems. Insufficient heat during cure will result in a network with incomplete polymerisation, and thus reduced mechanical, chemical and heat resistance. Cure temperature should typically attain the [[glass transition]] temperature (Tg) of the fully cured network in order to achieve maximum properties. Temperature is sometimes increased in a step-wise fashion to control the rate of curing and prevent excessive heat build-up from the exothermic reaction.\n\nHardeners which show only low or limited reactivity at ambient temperature, but which react with epoxy resins at elevated temperature are referred to as '''latent hardeners'''. When using latent hardeners, the epoxy resin and hardener may be mixed and stored for some time prior to use, which is advantageous for many industrial processes. Very latent hardeners enable one-component (1K) products to be produced, whereby the resin and hardener are supplied pre-mixed to the end user and only require heat to initiate curing. One-component products generally have shorter shelf-lives than standard 2-component systems, and products may require cooled storage and transport.\n\nThe epoxy curing reaction may be accelerated by addition of small quantities of [[accelerant|accelerators]]. Tertiary amines, carboxylic acids and alcohols (especially phenols) are effective accelerators. Bisphenol A is a highly effective and widely used accelerator, but is now increasingly replaced due to health concerns with this substance.\n\n===Homopolymerisation===\nEpoxy resin may be reacted with itself in the presence of an anionic catalyst (a Lewis base such as tertiary amines or imidazoles) or a cationic catalyst (a Lewis acid such as a boron trifluoride complex) to form a cured network. This process is known as catalytic homopolymerisation. The resulting network contains only ether bridges, and exhibits high thermal and chemical resistance, but is brittle and often requires elevated temperature for the curing process, so finds only niche applications industrially.\nEpoxy homopolymerisation is often used when there is a requirement for UV curing, since cationic UV catalysts may be employed (e.g. for [[UV coating]]s).\n\n===Amines===\nPolyfunctional primary amines form an important class of epoxy hardeners. Primary amines undergo an [[addition reaction]] with the epoxide group to form a hydroxyl group and a secondary amine. The secondary amine can further react with an epoxide to form a tertiary amine and an additional hydroxyl group. Kinetic studies have shown the reactivity of the primary amine to be approximately double that of the secondary amine. Use of a difunctional or polyfunctional amine forms a three-dimensional cross-linked network.\nAliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic amines are all employed as epoxy hardeners. Amine type hardeners will alter both the processing properties (viscosity, reactivity) and the final properties (mechanical, temperature and heat resistance) of the cured copolymer network. Thus amine structure is normally selected according to the application. Overall reactivity potential for different hardeners can roughly be ordered; aliphatic amines > cycloaliphatic amines > aromatic amines, though aliphatic amines with steric hindrance near the amino groups may react as slowly as some of the aromatic amines. Slower reactivity allows longer working times for processors. Temperature resistance generally increases in the same order, since aromatic amines form much more rigid structures than aliphatic amines. Aromatic amines were widely used as epoxy resin hardeners, due to the excellent end properties when mixed with a parent resin. Over the past few decades concern about the possible adverse health effects of many aromatic amines has led to increased use of aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amine alternatives. Amines are also blended, adducted and reacted to alter properties and these amine resins are more often used to cure epoxy resins than a pure amine such as TETA. increasingly, WATER BASED polyamines are also used to help reduce the toxicity profile among other reasons. \n[[File:N1,N1'-(ethane-1,2-diyl)bis(ethane-1,2-diamine) 200.svg|thumb|150px|Structure of [[Triethylenetetramine|TETA]], a typical hardener. The amine (NH2) groups react with the epoxide groups of the resin during polymerisation.]]\n\n===Anhydrides===\nEpoxy resins may be cured with cyclic anhydrides at elevated temperatures. Reaction occurs only after opening of the anhydride ring, e.g. by secondary hydroxyl groups in the epoxy resin. A possible side reaction may also occur between the epoxide and hydroxyl groups, but this may suppressed by addition of tertiary amines.\nThe low viscosity and high latency of anhydride hardeners makes them suitable for processing systems which require addition of mineral fillers prior to curing, e.g. for high voltage electrical insulators.\n\n===Phenols===\nPolyphenols, such as bisphenol A or novolacs can react with epoxy resins at elevated temperatures ({{cvt|130|-|180|C|disp=comma}}), normally in the presence of a catalyst. The resulting material has ether linkages and displays higher chemical and oxidation resistance than typically obtained by curing with amines or anhydrides. Since many novolacs are solids, this class of hardeners is often employed for [[powder coating]]s.\n\n===Thiols===\nAlso known as mercaptans, thiols contain a sulfur which reacts very readily with the epoxide group, even at ambient or sub-ambient temperatures. While the resulting network does not typically display high temperature or chemical resistance, the high reactivity of the thiol group makes it useful for applications where heated curing is not possible, or very fast cure is required e.g. for domestic DIY adhesives and chemical [[rock bolt]] [[Anchor bolt|anchors]]. Thiols have a characteristic odour, which can be detected in many two-component household adhesives.\n\n==History==\nCondensation of epoxides and amines was first reported and patented by Paul Schlack of Germany in 1934.<ref>P.

The chemistry of epoxies and the range of commercially available variations allows cure polymers to be produced with a very broad range of properties. In general, epoxies are known for their excellent adhesion, chemical and heat resistance, good-to-excellent mechanical properties and very good [[Insulator (electrical)|electrical insulating]] properties. Many properties of epoxies can be modified (for example [[silver]]-filled epoxies with good [[electrical conductivity]] are available, although epoxies are typically electrically insulating). Variations offering high thermal insulation, or thermal conductivity combined with high electrical resistance for electronics applications, are available.<ref>{{cite book|last=May |first=Clayton A. |title=Epoxy Resins: Chemistry and Technology|publisher=Marcel Dekker Inc|location=New York|date=1987-12-23|edition=Second|page=794|isbn=0-8247-7690-9}}</ref>\n\nAs with other classes of thermoset polymer materials, blending different grades of epoxy resin, as well as use of additives, plasticizers or fillers is common to achieve the desired processing or final properties, or to reduce cost.

[[Fusion bonded epoxy coating|Fusion Bonded Epoxy Powder Coatings]] (FBE) are extensively used for corrosion protection of steel pipes and fittings used in the oil and gas industry, potable water transmission pipelines (steel), and concrete reinforcing [[rebar]]. Epoxy coatings are also widely used as [[Primer (paint)|primers]] to improve the adhesion of automotive and marine paints especially on metal surfaces where [[corrosion]] (rusting) resistance is important. Metal cans and containers are often coated with epoxy to prevent rusting, especially for foods like tomatoes that are [[acid]]ic. Epoxy resins are also used for decorative flooring applications such as [[terrazzo]] flooring, chip flooring, and colored aggregate flooring.\nEpoxies were modified in a variety of ways, Reacted with fatty acids derived from oils to yield epoxy esters, which were cured the same way as alkyds . Typical ones were L8(80% linseed, D4 (40% Dehydrated castor oil). These were often reacted with styrene to make styrenated epoxy esters, used as primers. Curing with phenolics to make drum linings, curing esters with amine resins and pre-curing epoxies with amino resins to make resistant top coats. \nOne of the best examples was a system of using solvent free epoxies for priming ships during construction, this used a system of hot airless spray with premixing at the head. This obviated the problem of solvent retention under the film, which caused adhesion problems later on.\n\n=== Adhesives ===<!-- [[Epoxy adhesive]] redirects here -->\n[[File:Titan epoxy.jpg|thumb|right|Special epoxy is strong enough to withstand the forces between a [[surfboard]] fin and the fin mount. This epoxy is waterproof and capable of [[Curing (chemistry)|curing]] underwater.

These high-performance adhesives are used in the construction of aircraft, automobiles, bicycles, boats, golf clubs, skis, snowboards, and other applications where high strength bonds are required. Epoxy adhesives can be developed to suit almost any application. They can be used as adhesives for wood, metal, glass, stone, and some plastics. They can be made flexible or rigid, [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] or [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]]/colored, fast setting or slow setting. Epoxy adhesives are better in heat and chemical resistance than other common adhesives. In general, epoxy adhesives cured with heat will be more heat- and chemical-resistant than those cured at room temperature. The strength of epoxy adhesives is degraded at temperatures above {{convert|350|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}.<ref name='jjmorena'>{{cite book|last=Morena |first=John J |title=Advanced Composite Mold Making|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold Co.

Such epoxies are commonly used in [[optics]], [[optical fiber|fiber optics]], and [[optoelectronics]].\n\n=== Industrial tooling and composites ===\nEpoxy systems are used in industrial tooling applications to produce [[Molding (process)|molds]], master models, [[laminate]]s, [[casting]]s, [[Fixture (tool)|fixtures]], and other industrial production aids. This \"plastic tooling\" replaces metal, wood and other traditional materials, and generally improves the efficiency and either lowers the overall cost or shortens the lead-time for many industrial processes. Epoxies are also used in producing fiber-reinforced or composite parts. They are more expensive than polyester resins and [[vinyl ester resin]]s, but usually produce stronger and more temperature-resistant [[thermoset polymer matrix]] composite parts.\n\n=== Wind Turbine Technology composites ===\nEpoxy resins are used as bonding matrix along with glass or carbon fiber fabrics to produce composites with very high strength to weight characteristics, allowing longer and more efficient rotor blades to be produced. In addition, for offshore and onshore wind energy installations, epoxy resins are used as protective coatings on steel towers, base struts and concrete foundations. Aliphatic polyurethane top coats are applied on top to ensure full UV protection, prolong operational lifetimes and lowering maintenance costs. Electric generators, connected via the drivetrain with the rotor blades, convert mechanical wind energy in usable electric energy, and rely on epoxies electrical insulation and high thermal resistance properties. The same applies to transformers, bushings, spacers, and composites cables connecting the windmills to the grid In Europe, wind energy components account for the largest segment of epoxy applications, about 27% of the market.<ref name=socio2013>[https://epoxy-europe.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Epoxy_Socioeconomic_Study_Main_Findings_August-2017.pdf Epoxy Resins Committee > Socioeconomic Analysis] 2013</ref>\n\n=== Electrical systems and electronics ===\n[[File:Hybridcircuit.jpg|thumb|An epoxy [[conformal coating|encapsulated]] [[hybrid circuit]] on a [[printed circuit board]].]]\n[[File:Citizen se-733 int 1ac.jpg|thumb|The interior of a pocket calculator. The dark lump of epoxy in the center covers the processor chip]]\n\nEpoxy resin formulations are important in the electronics industry, and are employed in motors, generators, transformers, switchgear, bushings, insulators, printed wiring boards (PWB), and semiconductor encapsulants. Epoxy resins are excellent electrical insulators and protect electrical components from short circuiting, dust and moisture. In the electronics industry epoxy resins are the primary resin used in overmolding [[integrated circuit]]s, [[transistor]]s and [[hybrid circuit]]s, and making [[printed circuit boards]]. The largest volume type of circuit board\u2014an \"[[FR-4]] board\"\u2014is a sandwich of layers of glass cloth bonded into a composite by an epoxy resin. Epoxy resins are used to bond copper foil to circuit board substrates, and are a component of the solder mask on many circuit boards.\n\nFlexible epoxy resins are used for [[Potting (electronics)|potting]] transformers and inductors. By using vacuum impregnation on uncured epoxy, winding-to-winding, winding-to-core, and winding-to-insulator air voids are eliminated. The cured epoxy is an electrical insulator and a much better conductor of heat than air. Transformer and inductor hot spots are greatly reduced, giving the component a stable and longer life than unpotted product.\n\nEpoxy resins are applied using the technology of [[resin dispensing]].\n\n=== Petroleum & petrochemical ===\nEpoxies can be used to plug selective layers in a reservoir which are producing excessive brine. The technique is named \"water shut-off treatment\".<ref name=\"onepetro.org\"/>\n\n=== Consumer and marine applications ===\nEpoxies are sold in hardware stores, typically as a pack containing separate resin and hardener, which must be mixed immediately before use. They are also sold in boat shops as repair resins for marine applications. Epoxies typically are not used in the outer layer of a boat because they deteriorate by exposure to [[UV]] light. They are often used during boat repair and assembly, and then over-coated with conventional or two-part polyurethane paint or marine-varnishes that provide UV protection.\n\nThere are two main areas of marine use. Because of the better mechanical properties relative to the more common [[polyester resins]], epoxies are used for commercial manufacture of components where a high strength/weight ratio is required. The second area is that their strength, gap filling properties and excellent adhesion to many materials including timber have created a boom in amateur building projects including aircraft and boats.\n\nNormal [[gelcoat]] formulated for use with [[polyester]] resins and vinylester resins does not adhere to epoxy surfaces, though epoxy adheres very well if applied to polyester resin surfaces. \"Flocoat\" that is normally used to coat the interior of polyester fibreglass yachts is also compatible with epoxies.\n\nEpoxy materials tend to harden somewhat more gradually, while polyester materials tend to harden quickly, particularly if a lot of catalyst is used.<ref>Hakiki, F., Nuraeni, N., Salam, D.D., Aditya, W., Akbari, A., Mazrad, Z.A.I. and Siregar, S. [http://archives.datapages.com/data/ipa_pdf/2015/ipa15-se-025.htm Preliminary Study on Epoxy-Based Polymer for Water Shut-Off Application]. Paper IPA15-SE-025. Proceeding of The 39th IPA Conference and Exhibition, Jakarta, Indonesia, May 2015.</ref> The chemical reactions in both cases are exothermic. Large quantities of mix will generate their own heat and greatly speed the reaction, so it is usual to mix small amounts which can be used quickly.\n\nWhile it is common to associate polyester resins and epoxy resins, their properties are sufficiently different that they are properly treated as distinct materials. Polyester resins are typically low strength unless used with a reinforcing material like glass fibre, are relatively brittle unless reinforced, and have low adhesion. Epoxies, by contrast, are inherently strong, somewhat flexible and have excellent adhesion. However, polyester resins are much cheaper.\n\nEpoxy resins typically require a precise mix of two components which form a third chemical. Depending on the properties required, the ratio may be anything from 1:1 or over 10:1, but in every case they must be mixed exactly. The final product is then a precise thermo-setting plastic. Until they are mixed the two elements are relatively inert, although the 'hardeners' tend to be more chemically active and should be protected from the atmosphere and moisture. The rate of the reaction can be changed by using different hardeners, which may change the nature of the final product, or by controlling the temperature.\n\nBy contrast, polyester resins are usually made available in a 'promoted' form, such that the progress of previously-mixed resins from liquid to solid is already underway, albeit very slowly. The only variable available to the user is to change the rate of this process using a catalyst, often Methyl-Ethyl-Ketone-Peroxide ([[MEKP]]), which is very toxic. The presence of the catalyst in the final product actually detracts from the desirable properties, so that small amounts of catalyst are preferable, so long as the hardening proceeds at an acceptable pace. The rate of cure of polyesters can therefore be controlled by the amount and type of catalyst as well as by the temperature.\n\nAs adhesives, epoxies bond in three ways: a) Mechanically, because the bonding surfaces are roughened; b) by proximity, because the cured resins are physically so close to the bonding surfaces that they are hard to separate; c) ionically, because the epoxy resins form ionic bonds at an atomic level with the bonding surfaces. This last is substantially the strongest of the three. By contrast, polyester resins can only bond using the first two of these, which greatly reduces their utility as adhesives and in marine repair.\n\n=== Aerospace applications ===\nIn the aerospace industry, epoxy is used as a structural matrix material which is then reinforced by fiber. Typical fiber reinforcements include [[glass]], [[carbon]], [[Kevlar]], and [[boron]].\nEpoxies are also used as a structural [[glue]]. Materials like [[wood]], and others that are 'low-tech' are glued with epoxy resin. Epoxies generally out-perform most other resin types in terms of mechanical properties and resistance to environmental degradation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://netcomposites.com/guide/resin-systems/epoxy-resins/ |title=Epoxy Resins |website=netcomposites.com |language=en |access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Biology ===\nWater-soluble epoxies such as [[Durcupan]]<ref>{{cite journal\n |title=A new embedding technique for electron microscopy, combining a water-soluble epoxy resin (Durcupan) with water-insoluble Araldite\n |author=St\u00e4ubli, W.\n |journal=The Journal of Cell Biology\n |volume=16\n |issue=1\n |pages=197\n |year=1963\n |publisher=Rockefeller Univ Press\n |url=http://jcb.rupress.org/content/16/1/197.full.pdf\n |doi=10.1083/jcb.16.1.197|pmc=2106182\n |pmid=13978678\n }}\n</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n |title=A Modification of the Water-miscible Epoxy Resin \"Durcupan\" Embedding Method for Ultrathin Sectioning\n |author=Kushida, H.\n |journal=Journal of Electron Microscopy\n |volume=12\n |issue=1\n |pages=72\n |year=1963\n |publisher=Japan Society Microscopy\n |url=http://jmicro.oxfordjournals.org/content/12/1/72.extract }}\n</ref>\nare commonly used for [[electron microscope#Sample preparation|embedding]]\n[[electron microscope]] samples in plastic so they may be sectioned (sliced thin) with a [[microtome]] and then imaged.<ref>{{Cite news\n |title=Improvements in epoxy resin embedding methods\n |author=Luft, J.H.\n |journal=The Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology\n |volume=9\n |issue=2\n |pages=409\n |year=1961\n |publisher=Rockefeller Univ Press\n |url=http://jcb.rupress.org/content/9/2/409.full.pdf }}\n</ref>\n\n===Art===\nEpoxy resin, mixed with [[pigment]], may be used as a painting [[Media (arts)#Painting|medium]], by pouring layers on top of each other to form a complete picture.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McCreight|first1=Tim|last2=Bsullak|first2=Nicole|title=Color on Metal: 50 Artists Share Insights and Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7nBQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PP1|year=2001|publisher=Guild Pub.|isbn=978-1-893164-06-2}}</ref> It is also used in jewelry, as a doming resin for decorations and labels, and in decoupage type applications for art, countertops, and tables.\n\n== Industry ==\nThe global epoxy resin market was valued at approximately $8 billion in 2016. The epoxy resin market is dominated by the Asia-Pacific region, which contributes 55.2% of the total market share. China is the major producer and consumer globally, consuming almost 35% of the global resin production. The global market is made up of approximately 50\u2013100 manufacturers of basic or commodity epoxy resins and hardeners. In Europe, about 323,000 tonnes of epoxy resin were manufactured in 2017 generating some \u20ac1,055 million in sales. Germany <ref name=socio2013 />  is the largest market for epoxy resins in Europe, followed by Italy, France, the UK, Spain, the Netherlands and Austria.\n\nThese commodity epoxy [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]] mentioned above typically do not sell epoxy resins in a form usable to smaller end users, so there is another group of companies that purchase epoxy raw materials from the major producers and then compounds (blends, modifies, or otherwise customizes) epoxy systems from these [[raw material]]s. These companies are known as \"formulators\". The majority of the epoxy systems sold are produced by these formulators and they comprise over 60% of the dollar value of the epoxy market. There are hundreds of ways that these formulators can modify epoxies\u2014by adding [[mineral]] fillers ([[talc]], [[silica]], [[alumina]], etc.), by adding flexibilizers, [[viscosity]] reducers, [[colorant]]s, thickeners, accelerators, [[adhesion]] promoters, etc. These modifications are made to reduce costs, to improve performance, and to improve processing convenience. As a result, a typical formulator sells dozens or even thousands of formulations\u2014each tailored to the requirements of a particular application or market.\n\nThe raw materials for epoxy resin production are today largely [[petroleum]] derived, although some plant derived sources are now becoming commercially available (e.g. plant derived glycerol used to make [[epichlorohydrin]]).\n\n== Health risks ==\nThe primary risk associated with epoxy use is often related to the hardener component and not to the epoxy resin itself. Amine hardeners in particular are generally [[corrosive]], but may also be classed as [[toxic]] or [[carcinogenic]]/[[mutagenic]]. Aromatic amines present a particular health hazard (most are known or suspected carcinogens), but their use is now restricted to specific industrial applications, and safer aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amines are commonly employed.\n\nLiquid epoxy resins in their uncured state are mostly classed as [[Irritation|irritant]] to the eyes and skin, as well as toxic to aquatic organisms. Solid epoxy resins are generally safer than liquid epoxy resins, and many are classified non-hazardous materials. One particular risk associated with epoxy resins is sensitization. The risk has been shown to be more pronounced in epoxy resins containing low molecular weight epoxy diluents.<ref>[http://www.hse.gov.uk/research/rrpdf/rr079.pdf] An assessment of skin sensitisation by the use of epoxy resin in the construction industry, 2003</ref> Exposure to epoxy resins can, over time, induce an [[Allergy|allergic reaction]]. Sensitization generally occurs due to repeated exposure (e.g. through poor working hygiene or lack of protective equipment) over a long period of time. Allergic reaction sometimes occurs at a time which is delayed several days from the exposure. Allergic reaction is often visible in the form of [[dermatitis]], particularly in areas where the exposure has been highest (commonly hands and forearms). Epoxy use is a main source of [[occupational asthma]] among users of plastics.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/occupational-asthma/DS00591/DSECTION=risk-factors MayoClinic --> Occupational asthma] May 23, 2009</ref> [[Bisphenol A]], which is used to manufacture a common class of epoxy resins, is a known [[endocrine disruptor]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Thermosetting polymer]]\n* [[Thermoset polymer matrix]]\n* [[Plastic]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wiktionary}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060220105252/http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ohb/HESIS/epoxy.htm Epoxy Resin health hazards] (California Department of Health Services) 21 April 2008 @ [[Wayback Machine]] [https://epoxi.es/2HfHeiX https://web.archive.org/web/20080421095718/http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ohb/HESIS/epoxy.htm]\n* [http://pslc.ws/macrog/epoxy.htm The chemistry of epoxide], simple to understand\n\n<!-- LocalWords: catalyzing epoxies -->\n\n[[Category:Organic polymers]]\n[[Category:Adhesives]]\n[[Category:Synthetic resins]]\n[[Category:Thermosetting plastics]]\n\n[[da:Kunstharpiks]]\n", "name_user": "HGChemEng", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoxy"}

In brutal fighting, the [[77th Indian Infantry Brigade|77th 'Chindit' Brigade]] under Brigadier [[Mike Calvert|Michael Calvert]], later assisted by [[Chinese Expeditionary Force|Chinese forces]] of Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]], fought-for and captured the town from the [[Japanese occupation of Burma|occupying forces]] of [[Imperial Japan]].\n\nThe battle was part of a major [[Chindit]] campaign called [[Chindits#Operation Thursday|Operation ''Thursday'']] which later amalgamated with the [[Siege of Myitkyina]] by Chinese and US forces led by [[Joseph Stilwell]] who was in overall command of the Chindits. The capture of Mogaung was the first place in Burma to be liberated from the Japanese, and it was the last major Chindit campaign of the war. Two [[Victoria Cross]]es were awarded during the battle.<ref name=\"Griffin163\">{{Harvnb|Griffin|2018|pp=163\u201364}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nIn 1943, Brigadier [[Orde Wingate]] led the Chindits behind Japanese lines for the first of their [[Long-range penetration]] operations with Operation ''Loincloth''. It resulted in little strategic success but it did prove that [[British Empire]] forces could fight on equal terms with the Japanese in the jungle. The following year General [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|William 'Bill' Slim]] leading the British [[Fourteenth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourteenth Army]] were engaged in a desperate struggle against the Japanese army who had launched [[Operation U-Go]] \u2013 the invasion of [[British India]] beginning in March 1944.<ref name=\"Fay262\">{{Harvnb|Fay|1993|p=265}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the Japanese invasion a second Chindit expedition was launched; Operation ''Thursday'' was much larger than the previous years' with six brigades. The aim was to harass the Japanese rear and supply lines as well as to relieve pressure on American General [[Joseph Stilwell|Vinegar 'Joe' Stilwell]]'s joint Chinese and US forces moving south into Northern Burma who were intending to take the strategic town of [[Myitkyina]]. The early operations of the Chindits were marred by the death of Wingate in an air crash. They then went under the command of Major General [[Walter Lentaigne]] but were eventually placed under the command of the [[Anglophobia|Anglophobe]] Stilwell.<ref name=\"McLynn361\">{{Harvnb|McLynn|2011|p=361}}</ref> Once the operation was underway in March, 77 Brigade having held off superior Japanese forces for two months from their stronghold of ''White City''.\n\n===Prelude===\nIn late May they were ordered north by Stilwell to the area of Mogaung to take the pressure off his Chinese forces as they were struggling in [[Siege of Myitkyina|besieging Myitkyina]]. Capturing Mogaung meant that the Japanese lifeline northward would be cut and Myitkyina would inevitably fall. At the end of May, Fourteenth Army intelligence, backed by hazardous patrols from 77 Brigade, found that the Japanese had reinforced the defenders of Mogaung with four battalions from Lieutenant-General Hisashi Takeda's [[53rd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|53rd Division]] to  just under 4,000 troops.<ref name=\"Allen369\">{{Harvnb|Allen |1998|p=369}}</ref> The 77th brigade consisted of four battalions; the [[Lancashire Fusiliers]], [[King's Regiment (Liverpool)|King's Regiment]], [[South Staffordshire Regiment|South Staffordshire's]] and [[6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles]]s.

There was no way of flying in and to the North of the town was the fast flowing Mogaung River and to the West diverging off was the Wetthauk Chaung river. The country to the East and South were interspersed by lakes, marshes with the only access being a two mile long Pinhmi road on a causeway.

Stilwell eventually sent the 1/114th Chinese Infantry Regiment from the 38th Division to support the Chindits.<ref name=\"Bidwell270\">{{Harvnb|Bidwell|1980|pp=270\u201371}}</ref> Calvert assessed the situation on June 12; many battalions were reduced to a company which meant the brigade total consisted of no more than 750 fit men. Calvert was concerned with the number of wounded and the sick having to endure the poor conditions \u2013 [[Defensive fighting position|slit trenches]] were impossible due to the wet conditions; men would have to lay face down in the mud if they were under shell fire. Many of the wounded however were determined to stay and fight rather than be flown out.<ref name=\"Rooney100\">{{Harvnb|Rooney|1990|pp=100\u201301}}</ref>\n\nOver the next few days conditions began to improve many of the wounded were flown out and supplies were brought in once more. On June 15 Calvert continued his attacks, fighting to secure a ridge closer to the town. The Court House was taken the next day, and the area extending to the Mogaung River and up to the outskirts of Natgyigon was cleared.<ref name=\"Kirby408\"/> Japanese mortar fire from the village of Naungkaiktaw was causing some grief upon the Chindits. At dawn on June 18 air attacks and a heavy mortar bombardment over the next few days followed by an assault by the Lancashire Fusiliers and the King's attacked using flamethrowers.<ref name=\"Diamond80\">{{Harvnb|Diamond|2016|p=80}}</ref> At the cost of some fifty casualties (some from friendly fire) they succeeded and drove around a hundred Japanese out of the village in addition to killing some seventy of them. Whilst consolidating their position in the village a Japanese patrol was ambushed and taken out; they had not realised the village had been in British hands.<ref name=\"Rooney100\"/>\n\nAround the same time Chinese troops began to arrive; Gurkhas made contact with them West of Lakum. Mogaung was then surrounded, with the Chinese in the South which totalled nearly three battalions. Crucially they had [[Bofors 75 mm mountain gun|75mm mountain guns]] which were established at Pinhmi, and they were able pound Japanese positions.<ref name=\"McLynn352\">{{Harvnb|McLynn|2011|pp=351\u201352}}</ref>\n\n===Mogaung===\n[[File:Gurkha Captain Michael Allmand VC.jpg|thumb|150px|Gurkha Captain Michael Allmand who won the VC during the Battle of Mogaung]]\nCalvert planned his next attack for 23 June towards Natyigon, a key position and the last outer bastion of Mogaung. At first light on that day the final assault was launched; every available fit man was called up; cooks, orderlies and even Headquarters personnel. The Chinese attacked towards the railway station along the railway embankment which was effectively a last line of defence. Despite a heavy bombardment the attack failed and the Chinese were held back with intense Japanese machine gun fire. The Chindits had no choice but to halt along this line for the remainder of the day.<ref name=\"Bidwell270\"/>\n\nEarlier reconnaissance had pin-pointed the 'Red House', a large bricked building. The following day after a heavy bombardment from the Chinese guns and British mortars as well as air attacks the British attacked from the North of the station. Once once more fighting was intense, the Japanese defending tenaciously despite the constant pounding. The building and surrounding positions were only taken after brutal fighting in which flamethrowers, grenades and PIATs were used.<ref name=\"GibbsRyan143\">{{Harvnb|Gibbs | Ryan|1955|pp=143\u201344}}</ref> One of the men involved was Rifleman [[Tulbahadur Pun]]; his single-handed gallantry as part of the Gurkhas attack on the 'Red House' earned him a nomination for the Victoria Cross. The other nomination fell to Michael Allmand who attacked a machine-gun position holding up his remaining company. He Knocked out the position with grenades but was mortally wounded in the process. The Chinese provided some fire support but did not take part in this attack, instead protecting the flanks and cutting off any Japanese escape attempt. The assault by the Gurkhas totally unbalanced the Japanese and Takeda had no other choice to withdraw or risk his battalions being destroyed.<ref name=\"Corrigan\">{{Harvnb|Corrigan|2010|pp=466\u201367}}</ref>\n\nThe final attack was on the railway station on June 25 \u2013 the Chinese attack from the South was postponed but the Lancashires and the South Staffordshires went in anyway and after more heavy fighting finally took the battered remains and met up with the Chinese.<ref name=\"Lunt39\">{{Harvnb|Lunt|1994|p=39}}</ref> With the British having major foothold in the town, the Japanese launched a number of counterattacks that night but they were beaten off. The following morning the Chindit and Chinese patrols found positions outside the town abandoned.<ref name=\"Smith277\"/> Any Japanese that escaped did so by using [[Drum (container)|oil drums]] in the hope they would make it downriver to Myitkyina. Many however were shot up by patrolling Chindits.<ref name=\"Bidwell273\">{{Harvnb|Bidwell|1980|pp=273\u201374}}</ref>\n\nWith the battle largely over the Chindits consolidated their position in Mogaung but they were physically and mentally exhausted. The brigade at the end of the battle only had less than 550 men left of fighting strength. The Lancashire Fusiliers, King's Regiment and South Staffordshire's between them could only muster 300 between them and the 3/6th Gurkhas had 230 left fit.<ref name=\"Calvert180\">{{Harvnb|Calvert|2004|p=180}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nOnce Mogaung had been captured the Gurkha's garrisoned the town preparing for further counterattacks from across the river but none was forthcoming; the Japanese had left the area completely.<ref name=\"McLynn352\"/> Whilst in Mogaung, the Gurkha's took the opportunity to hold a small ceremonial parade and hoisted the Union Jack on a large [[pagoda]], the most prominent building left standing. The Chindits remained in the area until July 5 and then withdrew to their base area at Pinhmi. They then had to march a further fifty miles to be flown back to India before leaving Mogaung in the hands of the Chinese.<ref name=\"Calvert180\"/>\n\nThe capture of Mogaung was the first place in Burma to be liberated from the Japanese, and it was the last major Chindit campaign of the war.<ref name=\"Griffin163\"/> The Japanese had lost heavily with nearly 1,600 casualties most of whom were dead and an unknown number of sick that evacuated.<ref name=\"Allen374\"/> The cost of taking Mogaung had been high \u2013 Calvert had lost 47 officers and 729 other ranks killed or wounded; which equated to around fifty percent casualties. Stilwell had used the Chindits in an unsuitable role of classic infantry, without the support of artillery and armour. He announced via the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] that Chinese troops of his [[Northern Combat Area Command]] had captured Mogaung but without referencing the British. The Chindits were outraged, and Calvert famously signalled to Stilwell's headquarters 'Chinese reported taking Mogaung. My Brigade now taking umbrage.' Stillwell's son who was the intelligence officer announced that 'Umbrage was so small that I can't find it on the map'.<ref name=\"Rooney105\">{{Harvnb|Rooney|1990|p=105}}</ref>\n\nFearing that they would then be ordered to join the siege of Myitkyina, Calvert shut down his radios and withdrew to [[Kamaing]], where Stilwell had his headquarters. A court-martial was likely until Stilwell and Calvert met in person, and the former finally appreciated the conditions under which the Chindits had been operating.<ref name=\"Allen374\"/> The siege of Myitkyina had already proved a thorn in Stilwell's side after a major Chinese assault had been repelled with heavy losses. The British capture of Mogaung did relieve pressure on Stilwell's troops besieging the town; the Japanese quit Myitkyina on 3 August.<ref name=\"MM\">{{cite book |last1=United States Government |title=Merrill's Marauders, February \u2013 May 1944 American forces in action series Volume 100, Issue 4 |date=1990 |publisher=Printing Office Center of Military History |page=113 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4aAfAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA113&dq=}}</ref>\n\nTwo Victoria Crosses were awarded during the battle \u2013 Michael Allmand received his [[Posthumous award|posthumously]], while Tul Bahadur Pun received his in November.<ref name=\"Griffin163\"/> In addition members of the Sixth Gurkhas also received two [[Distinguished Service Order|DSOs]], three\n[[Indian Order of Merit|IOMs]], six [[Military Cross|MCs]], four [[Indian Distinguished Service Medal|IDSMs]], twelve [[Military Medal|MMs]] and three [[Silver Star|US Silver Stars]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.6thgurkhas.org/theregiment_battles.shtml|title=The Battle for Mogaung|publisher=6th Gurkhas.org|accessdate=2009-05-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827235622/http://www.6thgurkhas.org/theregiment_battles.shtml|archive-date=2008-08-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> The South Staffordshires, Kings and Lancashire fusiliers also received many awards.

In brutal fighting, the [[77th Indian Infantry Brigade|77th 'Chindit' Brigade]] under Brigadier [[Mike Calvert|Michael Calvert]], later assisted by [[Chinese Expeditionary Force|Chinese forces]] of Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]], fought-for and captured the town from the [[Japanese occupation of Burma|occupying forces]] of [[Imperial Japan]].\n\nThe battle was part of a major [[Chindit]] campaign called [[Chindits#Operation Thursday|Operation ''Thursday'']] which later amalgamated with the [[Siege of Myitkyina]] by Chinese and US forces led by [[Joseph Stilwell]] who was in overall command of the Chindits. The capture of Mogaung was the first place in Burma to be liberated from the Japanese, and it was the last major Chindit campaign of the war. Two [[Victoria Cross]]es were awarded during the battle.<ref name=\"Griffin163\">{{Harvnb|Griffin|2018|pp=163\u201364}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nIn 1943, Brigadier [[Orde Wingate]] led the Chindits behind Japanese lines for the first of their [[Long-range penetration]] operations with Operation ''Loincloth''. It resulted in little strategic success but it did prove that [[British Empire]] forces could fight on equal terms with the Japanese in the jungle. The following year General [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|William 'Bill' Slim]] leading the British [[Fourteenth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourteenth Army]] were engaged in a desperate struggle against the Japanese army who had launched [[Operation U-Go]] \u2013 the invasion of [[British India]] beginning in March 1944.<ref name=\"Fay262\">{{Harvnb|Fay|1993|p=265}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the Japanese invasion a second Chindit expedition was launched; Operation ''Thursday'' was much larger than the previous years' with six brigades. The aim was to harass the Japanese rear and supply lines as well as to relieve pressure on American General [[Joseph Stilwell|Vinegar 'Joe' Stilwell]]'s joint Chinese and US forces moving south into Northern Burma who were intending to take the strategic town of [[Myitkyina]]. The early operations of the Chindits were marred by the death of Wingate in an air crash. They then went under the command of Major General [[Walter Lentaigne]] but were eventually placed under the command of the [[Anglophobia|Anglophobe]] Stilwell.<ref name=\"McLynn361\">{{Harvnb|McLynn|2011|p=361}}</ref> Once the operation was underway in March, 77 Brigade having held off superior Japanese forces for two months from their stronghold of ''White City''.\n\n===Prelude===\nIn late May they were ordered north by Stilwell to the area of Mogaung to take the pressure off his Chinese forces as they were struggling in [[Siege of Myitkyina|besieging Myitkyina]]. Capturing Mogaung meant that the Japanese lifeline northward would be cut and Myitkyina would inevitably fall. At the end of May, Fourteenth Army intelligence, backed by hazardous patrols from 77 Brigade, found that the Japanese had reinforced the defenders of Mogaung with four battalions from Lieutenant-General Hisashi Takeda's [[53rd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|53rd Division]] to  just under 4,000 troops.<ref name=\"Allen369\">{{Harvnb|Allen |1998|p=369}}</ref> The 77th brigade consisted of four battalions; the [[Lancashire Fusiliers]], [[King's Regiment (Liverpool)|King's Regiment]], [[South Staffordshire Regiment|South Staffordshire's]] and [[6th Queen Elizabeth's Own Gurkha Rifles]]s. Accompanying the brigade were [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] liaison officers who would need high ground for radio contact from which to bring in close air support.<ref name=\"Diamond74\">{{Harvnb|Diamond|2016|p=74}}</ref>\n\nGetting to Mogaung would be difficult for the brigade however. There was no way of flying in and to the North of the town was the fast flowing Mogaung River and to the West diverging off was the Wetthauk Chaung river. The country to the East and South were interspersed by lakes, marshes with the only access being a two mile long Pinhmi road on a causeway. The British would have to use this in order to get there and would come up against villages on the outskirts that had been heavily fortified \u2013 with bunkers being constructed under the buildings.<ref name=\"Towill113\">{{Harvnb|Towill| 2000|p=114}}</ref>\n\n==Battle==\nOn May 30 the brigade set off; the plan was to advance 160 miles to the town using the Pinhmi road as an axis. Their first priority was for the  need for an area for a small landing strip for evacuating the sick and wounded as well as an area for supplies to be dropped. Calvert had hoped to reach and even capture Mogaung by 5 June.<ref name=\"GibbsRyan141\">{{Harvnb |Gibbs |Ryan|1955|p=141}}</ref>\n\n===Lakum===\n[[File:Ledo and Sodiya, India- Myitkyina, Myanmar- Batang (Ba), Litang, Gyaltang, Kham, Tibet- Burma Road terminus at Kunming, China 1945 map detail, from- Allied Third Burma Campaign Apri 1-May 1945 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Location of Mogaung in Northern Burma]]\nThe march was difficult \u2013 thick jungle intersected by deep ravines and the occasional sporadic firefight with the Japanese. Nevertheless on 2 June the South Staffordshires and the Gurkhas captured the village of [[Lakum]] after a fierce encounter with the Japanese. The village was a low laying hill overlooking the plain two miles south west of Mogaung. On the following day, another series of bitter encounters forced the Japanese off the surrounding hills \u2013 the Gurkhas seized a hamlet, later dubbed 'Gurkha Village', after wiping out the forty strong garrison there. They captured intact a large [[ammunition dump]], fifteen lorries and a camouflaged hospital full of medical supplies, as well as many sick Japanese soldiers. Many of these tried to escape without success and many more committed suicide.<ref name=\"Calvert230\">{{Harvnb|Calvert|2004|p=230}}</ref>\n\nCalvert had his headquarters operational just south of Lakum and a small airstrip was hastily laid from which supplies were arranged to be flown in and dropped by [[C-47]]'s.

Calvert also built up a store of medical, food and military supplies before any major attack went in.

In Mogaung itself the courthouse and railway station were potential areas for heavy resistance as they were the two main all brick buildings. Over the next few days the brigade got supplied \u2013 they were delivered [[PIAT]] anti tank weapons as well as [[Flamethrower, Portable, No 2|flamethrowers]], [[ML 3-inch mortar|3 inch]] and [[ML 4.2-inch mortar|4.2 inch]] mortars with thousands of rounds as the only means of heavy fire support. Japanese artillery was causing casualties but Calvert was eventually able to call in [[P-51 Mustang]]s of 1st Air Commando in an attempt to silence the Japanese positions.<ref name=\"Smith277\">{{Harvnb|Smith|1994|p=277}}</ref>\n\n===Pinhmi bridge and outskirts===\nThe attack on the Pinhmi to Mogaung road where the vital Pinhmi bridge crossed the Wetthauk Chaung river began on 7 June. As they advanced closer to Mogaung the Staffordshires found and destroyed a Japanese ammunition dump and the Lancashire Fusiliers later captured the village of Pinhmi. An attempt on the bridge the following day however failed as the Lancashires were repelled from concealed Japanese positions which ranged along a fifteen foot high embankment incurring heavy casualties.<ref name=\"Kirby408\"/> Nevertheless a reconnaissance patrol found a ford further down the river and from this the Gurkhas and the Staffordshires attacked and secured the village of Mahaung. In addition they also secured the village of Ywathitgale taking out a Japanese administrative headquarters, and reached the Pinhmi\u2013Mogaung road outflanking a number of Japanese positions.<ref name=\"Rooney97\">{{Harvnb|Rooney|1990|pp=97\u201399}}</ref> They then launched a number of counterattacks but were driven off. On 10 June the Gurkha's attempted to take the bridge again; the first attempt ended in failure but the second in a wide flanking move succeeded in taking the bridge. Among them was Captain [[Michael Allmand]]'s heroic feat in ensuring the capture of the bridge. The attacks cost nearly 130 casualties but Calvert's brigade was securely established along the axis of the Pinhmi-Mogaung road.<ref name=\"Diamond70\">{{Harvnb|Diamond|2016|p=70}}</ref>\n\nThe [[monsoon]] then broke later that day and conditions were tough for the men of 77 Brigade; [[malaria]], [[trench foot]] and [[typhus]] were soon rife.<ref name=\"Allen371\">{{Harvnb|Allen|1998|p=371}}</ref> Calvert learnt that two more Japanese battalions arrived to reinforce Mogaung essentially replacing casualties, and seeing the difficulty he then sent a messenger to Stilwell to alert him to the situation; but was not received with any sympathy. Stilwell eventually sent the 1/114th Chinese Infantry Regiment from the 38th Division to support the Chindits.<ref name=\"Bidwell270\">{{Harvnb|Bidwell|1980|pp=270\u201371}}</ref> Calvert assessed the situation on June 12; many battalions were reduced to a company which meant the brigade total consisted of no more than 750 fit men. Calvert was concerned with the number of wounded and the sick having to endure the poor conditions \u2013 [[Defensive fighting position|slit trenches]] were impossible due to the wet conditions; men would have to lay face down in the mud if they were under shell fire. Many of the wounded however were determined to stay and fight rather than be flown out.<ref name=\"Rooney100\">{{Harvnb|Rooney|1990|pp=100\u201301}}</ref>\n\nOver the next few days conditions began to improve many of the wounded were flown out and supplies were brought in once more. On June 15 Calvert continued his attacks, fighting to secure a ridge closer to the town. The Court House was taken the next day, and the area extending to the Mogaung River and up to the outskirts of Natgyigon was cleared.<ref name=\"Kirby408\"/> Japanese mortar fire from the village of Naungkaiktaw was causing some grief upon the Chindits. At dawn on June 18 air attacks and a heavy mortar bombardment over the next few days followed by an assault by the Lancashire Fusiliers and the King's attacked using flamethrowers.<ref name=\"Diamond80\">{{Harvnb|Diamond|2016|p=80}}</ref> At the cost of some fifty casualties (some from friendly fire) they succeeded and drove around a hundred Japanese out of the village in addition to killing some seventy of them. Whilst consolidating their position in the village a Japanese patrol was ambushed and taken out; they had not realised the village had been in British hands.<ref name=\"Rooney100\"/>\n\nAround the same time Chinese troops began to arrive; Gurkhas made contact with them West of Lakum. Mogaung was then surrounded, with the Chinese in the South which totalled nearly three battalions. Crucially they had [[Bofors 75 mm mountain gun|75mm mountain guns]] which were established at Pinhmi, and they were able pound Japanese positions.<ref name=\"McLynn352\">{{Harvnb|McLynn|2011|pp=351\u201352}}</ref>\n\n===Mogaung===\n[[File:Gurkha Captain Michael Allmand VC.jpg|thumb|150px|Gurkha Captain Michael Allmand who won the VC during the Battle of Mogaung]]\nCalvert planned his next attack for 23 June towards Natyigon, a key position and the last outer bastion of Mogaung. At first light on that day the final assault was launched; every available fit man was called up; cooks, orderlies and even Headquarters personnel. The Chinese attacked towards the railway station along the railway embankment which was effectively a last line of defence. Despite a heavy bombardment the attack failed and the Chinese were held back with intense Japanese machine gun fire. The Chindits had no choice but to halt along this line for the remainder of the day.<ref name=\"Bidwell270\"/>\n\nEarlier reconnaissance had pin-pointed the 'Red House', a large bricked building. The following day after a heavy bombardment from the Chinese guns and British mortars as well as air attacks the British attacked from the North of the station. Once once more fighting was intense, the Japanese defending tenaciously despite the constant pounding. The building and surrounding positions were only taken after brutal fighting in which flamethrowers, grenades and PIATs were used.<ref name=\"GibbsRyan143\">{{Harvnb|Gibbs | Ryan|1955|pp=143\u201344}}</ref> One of the men involved was Rifleman [[Tulbahadur Pun]]; his single-handed gallantry as part of the Gurkhas attack on the 'Red House' earned him a nomination for the Victoria Cross. The other nomination fell to Michael Allmand who attacked a machine-gun position holding up his remaining company. He Knocked out the position with grenades but was mortally wounded in the process. The Chinese provided some fire support but did not take part in this attack, instead protecting the flanks and cutting off any Japanese escape attempt. The assault by the Gurkhas totally unbalanced the Japanese and Takeda had no other choice to withdraw or risk his battalions being destroyed.<ref name=\"Corrigan\">{{Harvnb|Corrigan|2010|pp=466\u201367}}</ref>\n\nThe final attack was on the railway station on June 25 \u2013 the Chinese attack from the South was postponed but the Lancashires and the South Staffordshires went in anyway and after more heavy fighting finally took the battered remains and met up with the Chinese.<ref name=\"Lunt39\">{{Harvnb|Lunt|1994|p=39}}</ref> With the British having major foothold in the town, the Japanese launched a number of counter attacks that night but they were beaten off.

The brigade at the end of the battle only had less than 550 men left of fighting strength. The Lancashire Fusiliers, King's Regiment and South Staffordshire's between them could only muster 300 between them and the 3/6th Gurkhas had 230 left fit.<ref name=\"Calvert180\">{{Harvnb|Calvert|2004|p=180}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nOnce Mogaung had been captured the Gurkha's garrisoned the town preparing for further counterattacks from across the river but none was forthcoming; the Japanese had left the area completely.<ref name=\"McLynn352\"/> Whilst in Mogaung, the Gurkha's took the opportunity to hold a small ceremonial parade and hoisted the Union Jack on a large [[pagoda]], the most prominent building left standing. The Chindits remained in the area until July 5 and then withdrew to their base area at Pinhmi. They then had to march a further fifty miles to be flown back to India before leaving Mogaung in the hands of the Chinese.<ref name=\"Calvert180\"/>\n\nThe capture of Mogaung was the first place in Burma to be liberated from the Japanese, and it was the last major Chindit campaign of the war.<ref name=\"Griffin163\"/> The Japanese had lost heavily with nearly 1,600 casualties most of whom were dead and and an unknown number of sick that evacuated.<ref name=\"Allen374\"/> The cost of taking Mogaung had been high \u2013 Calvert had lost 47 officers and 729 other ranks killed or wounded; which equated to around fifty percent casualties. Stilwell had used the Chindits in an unsuitable role of classic infantry, without the support of artillery and armour. He announced via the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] that Chinese troops of his [[Northern Combat Area Command]] had captured Mogaung but without referencing the British. The Chindits were outraged, and Calvert famously signalled to Stilwell's headquarters 'Chinese reported taking Mogaung. My Brigade now taking umbrage.' Stillwell's son who was the intelligence officer announced that 'Umbrage was so small that I can't find it on the map'.<ref name=\"Rooney105\">{{Harvnb|Rooney|1990|p=105}}</ref>\n\nFearing that they would then be ordered to join the siege of Myitkyina, Calvert shut down his radios and withdrew to [[Kamaing]], where Stilwell had his headquarters. A court-martial was likely until Stilwell and Calvert met in person, and the former finally appreciated the conditions under which the Chindits had been operating.<ref name=\"Allen374\"/> The siege of Myitkyina had already proved a thorn in Stilwell's side after a major Chinese assault had been repelled with heavy losses. The British capture of Mogaung did relieve pressure on Stilwell's troops besieging the town; the Japanese quit Myitkyina on 3 August.<ref name=\"MM\">{{cite book |last1=United States Government |title=Merrill's Marauders, February \u2013 May 1944 American forces in action series Volume 100, Issue 4 |date=1990 |publisher=Printing Office Center of Military History |page=113 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4aAfAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA113&dq=}}</ref>\n\nTwo Victoria Crosses were awarded during the battle \u2013 Michael Allmand received his [[Posthumous award|posthumously]], while Tul Bahadur Pun received his in November.<ref name=\"Griffin163\"/> In addition members of the Sixth Gurkhas also received two [[Distinguished Service Order|DSOs]], three\n[[Indian Order of Merit|IOMs]], six [[Military Cross|MCs]], four [[Indian Distinguished Service Medal|IDSMs]], twelve [[Military Medal|MMs]] and three [[Silver Star|US Silver Stars]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.6thgurkhas.org/theregiment_battles.shtml|title=The Battle for Mogaung|publisher=6th Gurkhas.org|accessdate=2009-05-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827235622/http://www.6thgurkhas.org/theregiment_battles.shtml|archive-date=2008-08-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> The South Staffordshires, Kings and Lancashire fusiliers also received many awards.

electoral [[Riding (division)|riding]] in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. In 1902 the riding was created as Port Arthur and Rainy River. Six years later it was split into two ridings: Port Arthur and [[Rainy River (electoral district)|Rainy River]]. In 1996, it was merged with the riding of [[Nipigon (provincial electoral district)|Nipigon]] to form [[Thunder Bay\u2014Superior North (provincial electoral district)|Thunder Bay\u2014Superior North]].\n\nWhen the city of Port Arthur merged with the neighbouring city of [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]] in 1970 to create the current city of [[Thunder Bay]], the riding of Port Arthur

In early 1968 the U.S. Army\u2019s [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] moved to [[I Corps (South Vietnam)|I Corps]] to conduct [[Operation Jeb Stuart]] and to participate in [[Battle of Khe Sanh#Operation Pegasus|Operation Pegasus]], the relief of [[Khe Sanh Combat Base]]. On 27 January 1968 [[COMUSMACV]] General [[William Westmoreland]] ordered the establishment of a new [[MACV]]/ARVN headquarters (known as MACV Forward) at [[Phu Bai Combat Base]] to control the war in Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb and [[Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean Province]]s. MACV Forward would be commanded by deputy COMUSMACV General [[Creighton Abrams]].
