As such, its presiding officer was called a \"provost\", and reported to the main campus in Berkeley. In 1951, UCLA was formally elevated to co-equal status with UC Berkeley, and its presiding officer [[Raymond B. Allen]] was the first chief executive to be granted the title of chancellor. The appointment of [[Franklin David Murphy]] to the position of Chancellor in 1960 helped spark an era of tremendous growth of facilities and faculty honors. By the end of the decade, UCLA had achieved distinction in a wide range of subjects. This era also secured UCLA's position as a proper university and not simply a branch of the UC system. This change is exemplified by an incident involving Chancellor Murphy, which was described by him:\n\n<blockquote>\nI picked up the telephone and called in from somewhere, and the phone operator said, \"University of California.\" And I said, \"Is this Berkeley?\" She said, \"No.\" I said, \"Well, who have I gotten to?\" \"UCLA.\" I said, \"Why didn't you say UCLA?\" \"Oh\", she said, \"we're instructed to say University of California.\" So the next morning I went to the office and wrote a memo; I said, \"Will you please instruct the operators, as of noon today, when they answer the phone to say, 'UCLA.{{'\"}} And they said, \"You know they won't like it at Berkeley.\" And I said, \"Well, let's just see.

In January 2009, the Bollywood movie ''[[My Name is Khan]]'' (2010) was shot on campus. UCLA is also often cast as Stanford in television shows such as ''[[The Mindy Project]]'' and ''[[Chuck (TV series)|Chuck]]''.

In addition to the student members, there are representatives appointed by the administration, the academic senate, and the alumni association. The \"services and enterprises\" portion of ASUCLA is run by a professional executive director who oversees some 300 staff and 2,000 student employees.\n\nThe Graduate Students Association is the governing body for approximately 13,000 graduate and professional students at UCLA.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gsa.asucla.ucla.edu/ |title=UCLA Graduate Student Association |publisher=Gsa.asucla.ucla.edu |date=February 2, 2010 |accessdate=May 23, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610183026/http://gsa.asucla.ucla.edu/ |archive-date=June 10, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe Undergraduate Students Association Council (USAC) is the governing body of the Undergraduate Students Association (USA) whose membership comprises every UCLA undergraduate student.<ref name=usac>{{cite web |url=https://www.usac.ucla.edu/about/usac.php |title=UCLA Undergraduate Students Association |publisher=UCLA |accessdate=September 11, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720073752/http://www.usac.ucla.edu/about/usac.php |archivedate=July 20, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  {{as of|2015}}, the student body had two major political slates: Bruins United and Let's Act.

All members of USAC may participate fully in Council deliberations, but only the elected officers, minus the USAC President may vote.\n\nAlong with the council, the student government also includes a seven-member Judicial Board, which similar to the Supreme Court, serves as the judicial branch of government and reviews actions of the council. These seven students are appointed by the student body president and confirmed by the council.\n\nUSAC's programs offers additional services to the campus and surrounding communities. For example, each year approximately 40,000 students, faculty and staff attend programs of the [[UCLA Campus Events Commission|Campus Events Commission]], including a low-cost film program, a speakers program which presents leading figures from a wide range of disciplines, and performances by dozens of entertainers.

As such, its presiding officer was called a \"provost\", and reported to the main campus in Berkeley. In 1951, UCLA was formally elevated to co-equal status with UC Berkeley, and its presiding officer [[Raymond B. Allen]] was the first chief executive to be granted the title of chancellor. The appointment of [[Franklin David Murphy]] to the position of Chancellor in 1960 helped spark an era of tremendous growth of facilities and faculty honors. By the end of the decade, UCLA had achieved distinction in a wide range of subjects. This era also secured UCLA's position as a proper university and not simply a branch of the UC system. This change is exemplified by an incident involving Chancellor Murphy, which was described by him:\n\n<blockquote>\nI picked up the telephone and called in from somewhere, and the phone operator said, \"University of California.\" And I said, \"Is this Berkeley?\" She said, \"No.\" I said, \"Well, who have I gotten to?\" \"UCLA.\" I said, \"Why didn't you say UCLA?\" \"Oh\", she said, \"we're instructed to say University of California.\" So the next morning I went to the office and wrote a memo; I said, \"Will you please instruct the operators, as of noon today, when they answer the phone to say, 'UCLA.{{'\"}} And they said, \"You know they won't like it at Berkeley.\" And I said, \"Well, let's just see.

In addition to the student members, there are representatives appointed by the administration, the academic senate, and the alumni association. The \"services and enterprises\" portion of ASUCLA is run by a professional executive director who oversees some 300 staff and 2,000 student employees.\n\nThe Graduate Students Association is the governing body for approximately 13,000 graduate and professional students at UCLA.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gsa.asucla.ucla.edu/ |title=UCLA Graduate Student Association |publisher=Gsa.asucla.ucla.edu |date=February 2, 2010 |accessdate=May 23, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610183026/http://gsa.asucla.ucla.edu/ |archive-date=June 10, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe Undergraduate Students Association Council (USAC) is the governing body of the Undergraduate Students Association (USA) whose membership comprises every UCLA undergraduate student.<ref name=usac>{{cite web |url=https://www.usac.ucla.edu/about/usac.php |title=UCLA Undergraduate Students Association |publisher=UCLA |accessdate=September 11, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720073752/http://www.usac.ucla.edu/about/usac.php |archivedate=July 20, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  {{as of|2015}}, the student body had two major political slates: Bruins United and Let's Act.

All members of USAC may participate fully in Council deliberations, but only the elected officers, minus the USAC President may vote.\n\nAlong with the council, the student government also includes a seven-member Judicial Board, which similar to the Supreme Court, serves as the judicial branch of government and reviews actions of the council. These seven students are appointed by the student body president and confirmed by the council.\n\nUSAC's programs offers additional services to the campus and surrounding communities. For example, each year approximately 40,000 students, faculty and staff attend programs of the [[UCLA Campus Events Commission|Campus Events Commission]], including a low-cost film program, a speakers program which presents leading figures from a wide range of disciplines, and performances by dozens of entertainers.
