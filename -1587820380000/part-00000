The film takes the Harper family on a 23-year journey.\n\nEunice appeared occasionally on \"The Family\" skit's [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] sitcom ''[[Mama's Family]]''. As portrayed by Carol Burnett, Eunice was in five episodes of ''Mama's Family'', all of which were in the [[Mama's Family#First life of the sitcom (seasons 1, 2)|first life of ''Mama's Family'']] on [[NBC]]. Four of Burnett's five appearances were in season 1. The fifth episode of season 2 (\"Rashomama\"), which aired on November 3, 1983, was Burnett's final portrayal of Eunice. The character made two subsequent appearances in flashback episodes. Tanya Fenmore played Eunice as a child in the nineteenth episode of season 2 (\"Mama's Birthday).<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0640588/</ref> This marked the character's final appearance in the first life of the sitcom.\n\nEunice appeared only once during the [[Mama's Family#Second life of the sitcom (seasons 3-6)|second life of ''Mama's Family'']] (originally in [[Broadcast syndication#First-run syndication in the U.S.|first-run syndication]]). The character's final appearance was in the fourteenth episode of season 4 (\"The Sins of the Mother\"), portrayed as a teenager by Heather Kerr.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0640615/</ref> Eunice is presented once more in voice only in the final episode of season 4 (\"Pomp and Circumstance\"); Eunice, voiced by Phyllis Franklin, spoke to Mama over the phone to inform her that she couldn't attend her son Bubba's high school [[graduation]]. She declined to explain her reasons to Bubba, hanging up when Mama threatened to put him on the phone.\n\nAlways clad in a tattered green dress and wearing her hair in a 1940s-era perm, Eunice is a working-class homemaker married to Ed Higgins. Eunice had a stormy, irrepressible, browbeating persona, always going melodramatically out of control, ranting and raving. However, especially on ''The Family'' sketches, Eunice was beaten down by her tyrannical, emotionally-abusive mother, and her fits of rage were usually provoked by her mother's passive-aggressive comments. Her character was portrayed as a jealous antagonist in her appearances on ''Mama's Family'', much more so than her appearances on ''The Family'' sketches.

He and his wife [[Roberta Wohlstetter]], an accomplished historian and intelligence expert, received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] from [[Ronald Reagan]] on November 7, 1985.\n\n==Ancestry==\nAlbert Wohlstetter's paternal grandparents were cosmopolitan Jews who immigrated to the United States from the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Albert's father, Philip, was born in the United States about twenty years later.{{sfn|Charles Wohlstetter|1997|p=1}}\n\n==Early life and education==\nAlbert was born on 19 December 1913, the fourth and youngest child of Philip Wohlstetter and Nellie (n\u00e9e Friedman). Albert's older siblings were William (1902\u20131967), Helene (1906\u20131974) and [[Charles Wohlstetter|Charles]] (1910\u20131995). Albert's brother Charles was an accomplished businessman who would help Albert get his start as a young man. Charles also employed Helene at one of his companies, [[ConTel]], where she was killed in a shooting by a disgruntled employee in 1974.{{sfn|Zarate|2009|p=66}}\n\nThe Wohlstetters lived in the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] neighborhood of Manhattan. Philip Wohlstetter had attended City College of New York was an attorney and the Chief Legal Council to the [[Metropolitan Opera|Metropolitan Opera Company]]. In 1912, he founded one of the early phonograph companies, the [[Rex Records (1912)|Rex Talking Machine Corporation]]. Luminaries of the performance world were regular guests in the Wohlstetter home. The Rex company was taken over and its Wilmington, Delaware factory converted to war production during the First World War. Philip died of a heart attack in 1918 when Albert was four years old.{{sfn|Charles Wohlstetter|1997|p=2}}\n\n===City College of New York===\nWohlstetter started at [[City College of New York]] in 1931 through a scholarship in modern dance, earning a B.A. in 1934. At the time he was involved in radical politics, and was a member of the [[Fieldites|League for a Revolutionary Workers Party]], a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] splinter group, in the mid-1930s.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=GqZ_JSy-QOkC&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=%22Albert+Wohlstetter%22+revolutionary+workers#v=onepage |title = They Knew They Were Right: The Rise of the Neocons|isbn = 9780307472489|last1 = Heilbrunn|first1 = Jacob|date = 6 January 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Columbia University===\nWohlstetter started at [[Columbia Law School]] on a fellowship in 1934. It was in a class there that he met Roberta Morgan. Wohlstetter was bored by the law and left the program after only one year. But he stayed at Columbia to pursue a Ph.D. in [[mathematical logic]] and the [[philosophy of science]]. He studies under [[Abraham Wald]] where he was a peer of [[Jacob Wolfowitz]].{{sfn|Richardson|2009|p=98}} After a thesis titled ''Language and Empiricism'' earned him an M.A. in June 1937, several fellowships allowed him to work on is dissertation. He had a fellowship with the [[Social Science Research Council]] on a project to incorporate modern mathematical methods into economics and [[business cycle]] research. From 1941\u20131942 he was a research associate at the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]].{{sfn|Zarate|2009|p=8}}\n\nIn August 1942 the Wohlstetters vacationed with [[Dwight Macdonald]], one of the editors of ''[[Partisan Review]]'', and his wife, Nancy in Nantucket.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wreszin |first=Michael |date=1994 |title=A Rebel In Defense of Tradition: The Life and Politics of Dwight Macdonald |location=New York |publisher=HarperCollins |page=113 |isbn=0-465-01739-8}}</ref>\n\nHe left Columbia's graduate program when the Second World War started to work for the U.S. government on war planning and never completed his doctorate.\n\n==Early career==\nDuring the Second World War, Wohlstetter worked on problems of war production. He was first hired by the Planning Committee of the [[War Production Board]]. It is unclear how he ended up there. In an interview, Wohlstetter says that while on the Carnegie associateship with NBER, [[Simon Kuznets]] was hired by [[Robert R. Nathan]] and it was Kuznets who hired Wohlstetter.{{sfn|Wohlstetter|30 January 1986|p=1}} Albert's brother Charles recounts that it was [[Arthur F.

At the USHA Wohlstetter and Weidlinger worked on applying such principles to domestic residential buildings.{{sfn|Kaplan|1983|p=96}}\n\nDuring the 1937\u20131938 school year, Roberta had worked as a teaching assistant at the [[University of Southern California]], during which time she became enamored with the California lifestyle.{{sfn|Robin|2016|pp=47, 49}} At her urging, and with his brother Charles helping to secure a job for Albert, the Wohlstetters moved to Santa Monica in 1947. Albert went to work for the [[General Panel Corporation]] to \"tool up\" their industrial plant. General Panel Corporation was a company founded by [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Konrad Wachsmann]], two important figures in the [[Bauhaus]] movement.{{sfn|Wohlstetter|29 July 1987|p=2}}\n\n==RAND Corporation==\nWhile on a walk, Albert and Roberta ran into [[Meyer Abraham Girschick|Abe Girschick]], [[Olaf Helmer]] and [[J.C.C. McKinsey|Chen McKinsey]] on the street in Santa Monica. Albert knew the three from his days as a student and in government service.{{sfn|Kaplan|1983|p=97}} The three mathematicians \"... were overjoyed to see us.

There were only a little over a dozen mathematical logicians before the war in the United States ...\"{{sfn|Wohlstetter|29 July 1987|pp=1\u20132}} Girschick, Helmer and McKinsey were working at the recently formed [[RAND Corporation]]. With their help, [[Hans Speier]], the head of the RAND social science division, hired Roberta, initially to write book abstracts for circulation to the RAND staff.<ref>{{harvnb|Robin|2016|pp=50\u201353}}; {{harvnb|Abella|2008|pp=78\u201379}}</ref> When General Panel Corporation finally went out of business in 1951, Albert wanted to return to academia in the east, but Roberta was intent on remaining in California.{{sfn|Robin|2016|pp=50\u201351}} She set up a meeting between Albert and [[Charles J. Hitch]], the head of the RAND economics department. The two hit it off and Wohlstetter was brought on as a consultant to the Mathematics Department.{{sfn|Zarate|2009|p=9}}\n\nWohlstetter remained a consultant with RAND for the first few years. It was not until June or July 1953, a few months after he began briefing ''Selection and Use of Strategic Air Bases'' to the Air Force that Hitch finally insisted that his consultant status was \"absurd\" and that he join the permanent staff.{{sfn|Wohlstetter|29 July 1987|p=4}}\n\nAt RAND, he researched how to posture and operate U.S. strategic nuclear forces to deter plausible forms of Soviet nuclear-armed aggression in way that was credible, cost-effective and controllable.<ref>See Albert Wohlstetter, et al., [https://www.rand.org/pubs/reports/R0266/ ''Selection and the Use of Strategic Air Bases''], a report prepared for United States Air Force Project RAND, R-266 (Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, April 1954); Wohlstetter, et al., [http://www.albertwohlstetter.com/writings/R290''Protecting U.S. Power to Strike Back in the 1950s and 1960s''], staff report, R-290 (Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, September 1, 1956); and Wohlstetter, [http://www.albertwohlstetter.com/writings/DBOT \"The Delicate Balance of Terror,\"] ''Foreign Affairs'', Vol. 37, No. 2 (January 1959), pp. 211-234.</ref>\n\nWohlstetter's 1958 'The Delicate Balance of Terror' was highly influential in shaping the thinking of the Washington foreign policy establishment, particularly in its emphasis on the looming threat of Soviet attack.<ref>Andrew Bacevich, 'Tailors to the Emperor', New Left Review 69, May\u2013June 2011, p. 108 [http://www.newleftreview.org/?page=article&view=2901]</ref>\n\nThe relationship between Bernard Brodie and Wohlstetter grew increasingly acrimonious and personal. In 1963, Brodie accused Wohlstetter of a security violation and financial malfeasance. Wohlstetter had shared a draft RAND paper by [[Constantin Melnik]] with Henry Rowen, then one of the [[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Whiz Kids]] working as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs at McNamara's Pentagon. Brodie also claimed that Wohlstetter was extravagant in wining and dining clients and colleagues using RAND funds. Wohlstetter defended himself by pointing out that the Melnik paper was only a \"D\" designated document, RAND's lowest level classification, and as a former RAND employee who had collaborated extensively with Wohlstetter on some of his most important studies, Rowen was authorized to receive the paper. Nevertheless, RAND Director [[Frank Collbohm]] demanded that Wohlstetter submit his resignation. When Wohlstetter refused, Collbohm fired him, but agreed to let Wohlstetter stay on at RAND long enough to find another job.<ref>{{harvnb|Robin|2016|p=97}}; {{harvnb|Abella|2008|pp=196\u2013194}}</ref>\n\n==University of Chicago==\nAt the suggestion of [[Hans Morgenthau]] and with his help, Wohlstetter secured a position as a professor of political science at the University of Chicago.{{sfn|Zarate|2009|p=31}}\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, he expanded the scope of his research to include alliance policy and nuclear nonproliferation,<ref>See Albert Wohlstetter, [http://www.albertwohlstetter.com/writings/NuclearSharing \"Nuclear Sharing: NATO and the N+1 Country,\"] Foreign Affairs, Vol. 39, No. 3 (April 1961), pp. 355-387.</ref> ballistic missile defense,<ref>See Albert Wohlstetter, \"The Case for Strategic Force Defense,\" in Johan J\u00f8rgen Holst and William Schneider, Jr., eds., ''Why ABM?

They wrote that Wohlstetter:  {{quote|was at the origin of the rethinking of the traditional doctrine known as '[[mutual assured destruction]]' (MAD, in its [[English language|English]] acronym), which was the basis for nuclear deterrence.  According to this theory, two blocs capable of inflicting upon each other irreparable damages would cause leaders to hesitate to unleash the nuclear fire. For Wohlstetter and his pupils, MAD was both immoral -- because of the destruction inflicted on civilian populations -- and ineffective: it led to the mutual neutralization of nuclear arsenals. No statesman endowed with reason, and in any case no American president, would decide on 'reciprocal suicide.' Wohlstetter proposed on the contrary a 'graduated deterrence,' i.e. the acceptance of limited wars, possibly using tactical nuclear arms, together with 'smart' precision-guided weapons capable of hitting the enemy's military apparatus. He criticized the politics of [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|nuclear arms limitations]] conducted together with [[Moscow]]. It amounted, according to him, to constraining the technological creativity of the [[United States]] in order to maintain an artificial equilibrium with the [[USSR]].}}</ref>\n\nWohlstetter and his wife, [[Roberta Wohlstetter]], also counseled both Democratic and Republican administrations, including advisers to President [[John F.

From 1964 to 1980, he taught in the political science department of the [[University of Chicago]], and chaired the dissertation committees of [[Paul Wolfowitz]], Efraim Inbar and [[Zalmay Khalilzad]].

He and Roberta thought he was just ill or having an asthma attack. Over the telephone from New York their daughter Joan reviewed the symptoms for a heart attack and told Roberta to call an ambulance. Albert made a fuss, not wanting to go to the emergency room. At the hospital he was diagnosed as having had a serious heart attack and was discharged home with around-the-clock nursing care. In the living room he set up a makeshift chair  that allowed him to partially recline so he could continue to work. A month later, on 10 January 1997, Wohlstetter died at his [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles|Laurel Canyon]] home.<ref>{{harvnb|Abella|2008|pp=301\u2013302}}; {{harvnb|Pace|14 January 1997}}</ref>\n\nA memorial was held at the office of the RAND Corporation{{sfn|Abella|2008|p=302}} and a month later Senator [[Jon Kyl]] and special guest Richard Perle conducted a brief remembrance in the Senate chamber.{{sfn|Kyl|Perle|6 February 1997}} Albert Wohlstetter is buried at [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]] in Los Angeles.

In 1962, Kubrick was looking for his next project after ''Lolita'' and started reading intensively on nuclear issues. One of Kubrick's early ideas was to make a realistic thriller, titled after Wohlstetter's \"Delicate Balance of Terror\". But Kubrick could not conceive of a realistic scenario for an accidental nuclear war, so turned instead to the idea of making a comedy. While the character of Dr. Stragelove is a composite of numerous people associated with RAND (Dr. Strangelove confesses to the president having commissioned a study by \"the Bland Corporation\" of the possibility of a doomsday device) in the movie that was made, he is mostly based on [[Herman Kahn]], [[John von Neumann]], [[Wernher von Braun]] and [[Edward Teller]].{{sfn|Menand|27 June 2005}}\n\n==References==\n\n<references/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n{{colbegin}}\n\n===Works by Wohlstetter===\n\nFor a more complete list of the works of Albert Wohlstetter, see the [http://albertwohlstetter.nuclearpolicy101.org/albert-wohlstetter-bibliography/ Albert Wohlstetter Bibliography] at the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center's AlbertWohlstetter.com website.\n\n;Government and research institute reports\n* {{cite report |last1=Wohlstetter |first1=Albert J. |last2=Hoffman |first2=Fred S. |last3=Lutz |first3=R.

He and his wife [[Roberta Wohlstetter]], an accomplished historian and intelligence expert, received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] from [[Ronald Reagan]] on November 7, 1985.\n\n==Ancestry==\nAlbert Wohlstetter's paternal grandparents were cosmopolitan Jews who immigrated to the United States from the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Albert's father, Philip, was born in the United States about twenty years later.{{sfn|Charles Wohlstetter|1997|p=1}}\n\n==Early life and education==\nAlbert was born on 19 December 1913, the fourth and youngest child of Philip Wohlstetter and Nellie (n\u00e9e Friedman). Albert's older siblings were William (1902\u20131967), Helene (1906\u20131974) and [[Charles Wohlstetter|Charles]] (1910\u20131995). Albert's brother Charles was an accomplished businessman who would help Albert get his start as a young man. Charles also employed Helene at one of his companies, [[ConTel]], where she was killed in a shooting by a disgruntled employee in 1974.{{sfn|Zarate|2009|p=66}}\n\nThe Wohlstetters lived in the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] neighborhood of Manhattan. Philip Wohlstetter had attended City College of New York was an attorney and the Chief Legal Council to the [[Metropolitan Opera|Metropolitan Opera Company]]. In 1912, he founded one of the early phonograph companies, the [[Rex Records (1912)|Rex Talking Machine Corporation]]. Luminaries of the performance world were regular guests in the Wohlstetter home. The Rex company was taken over and its Wilmington, Delaware factory converted to war production during the First World War. Philip died of a heart attack in 1918 when Albert was four years old.{{sfn|Charles Wohlstetter|1997|p=2}}\n\n===City College of New York===\nWohlstetter started at [[City College of New York]] in 1931 through a scholarship in modern dance, earning a B.A. in 1934. At the time he was involved in radical politics, and was a member of the [[Fieldites|League for a Revolutionary Workers Party]], a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] splinter group, in the mid-1930s.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=GqZ_JSy-QOkC&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=%22Albert+Wohlstetter%22+revolutionary+workers#v=onepage |title = They Knew They Were Right: The Rise of the Neocons|isbn = 9780307472489|last1 = Heilbrunn|first1 = Jacob|date = 6 January 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Columbia University===\nWohlstetter started at [[Columbia Law School]] on a fellowship in 1934. It was in a class there that he met Roberta Morgan. Wohlstetter was bored by the law and left the program after only one year. But he stayed at Columbia to pursue a Ph.D. in [[mathematical logic]] and the [[philosophy of science]]. He studies under [[Abraham Wald]] where he was a peer of [[Jacob Wolfowitz]].{{sfn|Richardson|2009|p=98}} After a thesis titled ''Language and Empiricism'' earned him an M.A. in June 1937, several fellowships allowed him to work on is dissertation. He had a fellowship with the [[Social Science Research Council]] on a project to incorporate modern mathematical methods into economics and [[business cycle]] research. From 1941\u20131942 he was a research associate at the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]].{{sfn|Zarate|2009|p=8}}\n\nIn August 1942 the Wohlstetters vacationed with [[Dwight Macdonald]], one of the editors of ''[[Partisan Review]]'', and his wife, Nancy in Nantucket.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wreszin |first=Michael |date=1994 |title=A Rebel In Defense of Tradition: The Life and Politics of Dwight Macdonald |location=New York |publisher=HarperCollins |page=113 |isbn=0-465-01739-8}}</ref>\n\nHe left Columbia's graduate program when the Second World War started to work for the U.S. government on war planning and never completed his doctorate.\n\n==Early career==\nDuring the Second World War, Wohlstetter worked on problems of war production. He was first hired by the Planning Committee of the [[War Production Board]]. It is unclear how he ended up there. In an interview, Wohlstetter says that while on the Carnegie associateship with NBER, [[Simon Kuznets]] was hired by [[Robert R. Nathan]] and it was Kuznets who hired Wohlstetter.{{sfn|Wohlstetter|30 January 1986|p=1}} Albert's brother Charles recounts that it was [[Arthur F. Burns]] who gave Albert the job.{{sfn|Charles Wohlstetter|1997|p=116}}\n\nLater he worked at [[Atlas Aircraft Products Company]].\n\nAfter the war, Wohlstetter worked briefly in business in New York.{{sfn|Kaplan|1983|p=96}} He moved back to Washington, D.C. to serve as the Director of Programs for the [[United States Housing Authority|National Housing Agency]] (USHA) in 1946 and 1947, the only time in his career he was a federal employee.<ref>{{harvnb|Mukherjee|Jacobs|Porfirenko|Bulatoff|2001|p=3}}; {{harvnb|Zarate|2009|p=66}}; {{harvnb|Herken|1985|p=89}}</ref> At the USHA Wohlstetter worked with [[Paul Weidlinger]], an engineer who had worked during the war for an aircraft company owned by Albert's brother, Charles, designing modular buildings such as airplane hangars that could be assembled quickly. At the USHA Wohlstetter and Weidlinger worked on applying such principles to domestic residential buildings.{{sfn|Kaplan|1983|p=96}}\n\nDuring the 1937\u20131938 school year, Roberta had worked as a teaching assistant at the [[University of Southern California]], during which time she became enamored with the California lifestyle.{{sfn|Robin|2016|pp=47, 49}} At her urging, and with his brother Charles helping to secure a job for Albert, the Wohlstetters moved to Santa Monica in 1947. Albert went to work for the [[General Panel Corporation]] to \"tool up\" their industrial plant. General Panel Corporation was a company founded by [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Konrad Wachsmann]], two important figures in the [[Bauhaus]] movement.{{sfn|Wohlstetter|29 July 1987|p=2}}\n\n==RAND Corporation==\nWhile on a walk, Albert and Roberta ran into [[Meyer Abraham Girschick|Abe Girschick]], [[Olaf Helmer]] and [[J.C.C. McKinsey|Chen McKinsey]] on the street in Santa Monica. Albert knew the three from his days as a student and in government service.{{sfn|Kaplan|1983|p=97}} The three mathematicians \"... were overjoyed to see us. Mathematical logic was a very, very small world. There were only a little over a dozen mathematical logicians before the war in the United States ...\"{{sfn|Wohlstetter|29 July 1987|pp=1\u20132}} Girschick, Helmer and McKinsey were working at the recently formed [[RAND Corporation]]. With their help, [[Hans Speier]], the head of the RAND social science division, hired Roberta, initially to write book abstracts for circulation to the RAND staff.<ref>{{harvnb|Robin|2016|pp=50\u201353}}; {{harvnb|Abella|2008|pp=78\u201379}}</ref> When General Panel Corporation finally went out of business in 1951, Albert wanted to return to academia in the east, but Roberta was intent on remaining in California.{{sfn|Robin|2016|pp=50\u201351}} She set up a meeting between Albert and [[Charles J. Hitch]], the head of the RAND economics department. The two hit it off and Wohlstetter was brought on as a consultant to the Mathematics Department.{{sfn|Zarate|2009|p=9}}\n\nWohlstetter remained a consultant with RAND for the first few years. It was not until June or July 1953, a few months after he began briefing ''Selection and Use of Strategic Air Bases'' to the Air Force that Hitch finally insisted that his consultant status was \"absurd\" and that he join the permanent staff.{{sfn|Wohlstetter|29 July 1987|p=4}}\n\nAt RAND, he researched how to posture and operate U.S. strategic nuclear forces to deter plausible forms of Soviet nuclear-armed aggression in way that was credible, cost-effective and controllable.<ref>See Albert Wohlstetter, et al., [https://www.rand.org/pubs/reports/R0266/ ''Selection and the Use of Strategic Air Bases''], a report prepared for United States Air Force Project RAND, R-266 (Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, April 1954); Wohlstetter, et al., [http://www.albertwohlstetter.com/writings/R290''Protecting U.S. Power to Strike Back in the 1950s and 1960s''], staff report, R-290 (Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, September 1, 1956); and Wohlstetter, [http://www.albertwohlstetter.com/writings/DBOT \"The Delicate Balance of Terror,\"] ''Foreign Affairs'', Vol. 37, No. 2 (January 1959), pp. 211-234.</ref>\n\nWohlstetter's 1958 'The Delicate Balance of Terror' was highly influential in shaping the thinking of the Washington foreign policy establishment, particularly in its emphasis on the looming threat of Soviet attack.<ref>Andrew Bacevich, 'Tailors to the Emperor', New Left Review 69, May\u2013June 2011, p. 108 [http://www.newleftreview.org/?page=article&view=2901]</ref>\n\nThe relationship between Bernard Brodie and Wohlstetter grew increasingly acrimonious and personal. In 1963, Brodie accused Wohlstetter of a security violation and financial malfeasance. Wohlstetter had shared a draft RAND paper by [[Constantin Melnik]] with Henry Rowen, then one of the [[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Whiz Kids]] working as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs at McNamara's Pentagon. Brodie also claimed that Wohlstetter was extravagant in wining and dining clients and colleagues using RAND funds. Wohlstetter defended himself by pointing out that the Melnik paper was only a \"D\" designated document, RAND's lowest level classification, and as a former RAND employee who had collaborated extensively with Wohlstetter on some of his most important studies, Rowen was authorized to receive the paper. Nevertheless, RAND Director [[Frank Collbohm]] demanded that Wohlstetter submit his resignation. When Wohlstetter refused, Collbohm fired him, but agreed to let Wohlstetter stay on at RAND long enough to find another job.<ref>{{harvnb|Robin|2016|p=97}}; {{harvnb|Abella|2008|pp=196\u2013194}}</ref>\n\n==University of Chicago==\nAt the suggestion of [[Hans Morgenthau]] and with his help, Wohlstetter secured a position as a professor of political science at the University of Chicago.{{sfn|Zarate|2009|p=31}}\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, he expanded the scope of his research to include alliance policy and nuclear nonproliferation,<ref>See Albert Wohlstetter, [http://www.albertwohlstetter.com/writings/NuclearSharing \"Nuclear Sharing: NATO and the N+1 Country,\"] Foreign Affairs, Vol. 39, No. 3 (April 1961), pp. 355-387.</ref> ballistic missile defense,<ref>See Albert Wohlstetter, \"The Case for Strategic Force Defense,\" in Johan J\u00f8rgen Holst and William Schneider, Jr., eds., ''Why ABM?

They wrote that Wohlstetter:  {{quote|was at the origin of the rethinking of the traditional doctrine known as '[[mutual assured destruction]]' (MAD, in its [[English language|English]] acronym), which was the basis for nuclear deterrence.  According to this theory, two blocs capable of inflicting upon each other irreparable damages would cause leaders to hesitate to unleash the nuclear fire. For Wohlstetter and his pupils, MAD was both immoral -- because of the destruction inflicted on civilian populations -- and ineffective: it led to the mutual neutralization of nuclear arsenals. No statesman endowed with reason, and in any case no American president, would decide on 'reciprocal suicide.' Wohlstetter proposed on the contrary a 'graduated deterrence,' i.e. the acceptance of limited wars, possibly using tactical nuclear arms, together with 'smart' precision-guided weapons capable of hitting the enemy's military apparatus. He criticized the politics of [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|nuclear arms limitations]] conducted together with [[Moscow]]. It amounted, according to him, to constraining the technological creativity of the [[United States]] in order to maintain an artificial equilibrium with the [[USSR]].}}</ref>\n\nWohlstetter and his wife, [[Roberta Wohlstetter]], also counseled both Democratic and Republican administrations, including advisers to President [[John F.

From 1964 to 1980, he taught in the political science department of the [[University of Chicago]], and chaired the dissertation committees of [[Paul Wolfowitz]], Efraim Inbar and [[Zalmay Khalilzad]].

He and Roberta thought he was just ill or having an asthma attack. Over the telephone from New York their daughter Joan reviewed the symptoms for a heart attack and told Roberta to call an ambulance. Albert made a fuss, not wanting to go to the emergency room. At the hospital he was diagnosed as having had a serious heart attack and was discharged home with around-the-clock nursing care. In the living room he set up a makeshift chair  that allowed him to partially recline so he could continue to work. A month later, on 10 January 1997, Wohlstetter died at his [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles|Laurel Canyon]] home.<ref>{{harvnb|Abella|2008|pp=301\u2013302}}; {{harvnb|Pace|14 January 1997}}</ref>\n\nA memorial was held at the office of the RAND Corporation{{sfn|Abella|2008|p=302}} and a month later Senator [[Jon Kyl]] and special guest Richard Perle conducted a brief remembrance in the Senate chamber.{{sfn|Kyl|Perle|6 February 1997}} Albert Wohlstetter is buried at [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]] in Los Angeles.

In 1962, Kubrick was looking for his next project after ''Lolita'' and started reading intensively on nuclear issues. One of Kubrick's early ideas was to make a realistic thriller, titled after Wohlstetter's \"Delicate Balance of Terror\". But Kubrick could not conceive of a realistic scenario for an accidental nuclear war, so turned instead to the idea of making a comedy. While the character of Dr. Stragelove is a composite of numerous people associated with RAND (Dr. Strangelove confesses to the president having commissioned a study by \"the Bland Corporation\" of the possibility of a doomsday device) in the movie that was made, he is mostly based on [[Herman Kahn]], [[John von Neumann]], [[Wernher von Braun]] and [[Edward Teller]].{{sfn|Menand|27 June 2005}}\n\n==References==\n\n<references/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n{{colbegin}}\n\n===Works by Wohlstetter===\n\nFor a more complete list of the works of Albert Wohlstetter, see the [http://albertwohlstetter.nuclearpolicy101.org/albert-wohlstetter-bibliography/ Albert Wohlstetter Bibliography] at the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center's AlbertWohlstetter.com website.\n\n;Government and research institute reports\n* {{cite report |last1=Wohlstetter |first1=Albert J. |last2=Hoffman |first2=Fred S. |last3=Lutz |first3=R.
