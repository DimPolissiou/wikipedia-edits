He was first [[2006 Massachusetts gubernatorial election|elected in 2006]], succeeding [[Mitt Romney]], who chose not to run for reelection to focus on his presidential campaign. He was [[2010 Massachusetts gubernatorial election|reelected in 2010]]. He was the first [[African Americans|African American]] Governor of Massachusetts. A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], Patrick served from 1994 to 1997 as the [[United States Assistant Attorney General]] for the [[United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division|Civil Rights Division]] under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]]. He was briefly a candidate for President of the United States in the [[2020 U.S. presidential election]].\n\nRaised largely by a single mother on the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]] of [[Chicago]], Patrick earned a scholarship to [[Milton Academy]] in [[Milton, Massachusetts]] in the eighth grade. He went on to attend [[Harvard College]] and [[Harvard Law School]], where he was president of the [[Harvard Legal Aid Bureau]]. After graduating, he practiced law with the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] and later joined a [[Boston]] law firm, where he was named a partner at age 34. In 1994, Bill Clinton appointed him as the United States assistant attorney general for the civil rights division of the [[United States Department of Justice]], where he worked on issues including [[racial profiling]] and [[police misconduct]].\n\nDuring his governorship, Patrick oversaw the implementation of the state's [[Massachusetts health care reform|2006 health care reform]] program which had been enacted under Mitt Romney, increased funding to education and life sciences, won a federal [[Race to the Top]] education grant, passed an overhaul of governance of the state transportation function, signing a law to create the [[Massachusetts Department of Transportation]], increased the state sales tax from 5% to 6.25%, raised the state's [[minimum wage]] from $8 per hour to $11 by 2017, and planned the introduction of [[casino]]s to the state.

During the meeting, however, FA secretary [[Ebenezer Morley]] brought the delegates' attention to a [[Cambridge rules#Cambridge Rules of 1863|recently published set of football laws from Cambridge University]] which banned carrying and hacking.

The original 1863 laws had permitted a goal to be scored at any height between two posts eight yards apart. Pember urged that a tape be strung between the posts, with a goal counting only if the ball went below the tape. The meeting agreed to make this change, setting the height of the tape at 8 feet. The dimensions of the goal have remained the same ever since, with the tape subsequently replaced by a crossbar.<ref name=\"fa_1866\">{{cite news |work=Bell's Life in London |issue=2288 |page=7 |date=1866-02-24 |title=The Football Association |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Football_Association_(Bell%27s_Life_in_London)_1866-02-24.png}}</ref>\nPember also \"strongly objected\" to the practice of striking the ball with the hands, at that time allowed by the FA laws, saying that it was \"not football, as the game had to be played with the feet, and not with the hands\":<ref name=\"fa_1866\"/> \"knocking on\" was subsequently outlawed in 1867.\n\nAt the same meeting, Pember accepted an invitation from [[Sheffield FC]] to a match under Association rules, and captained the victorious London team in the ensuing [[London v Sheffield (1866)|London v Sheffield]] match, played in March 1866.

During the meeting, however, FA secretary [[Ebenezer Morley]] brought the delegates' attention to a [[Cambridge_rules#Cambridge_Rules_of_1863|recently-published set of football laws from Cambridge University]] which banned carrying and hacking.  Discussion of the Cambridge rules, and suggestions for possible communication with Cambridge on the subject, served to delay the final \"settlement\" of the laws to a further meeting, on December 1st.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Football Association |work=Bell's Life in London |date=1863-11-28 |page=6 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Football_Association_(Bells_Life_in_London)_1863-11-28.png |quote=The {{sc|President}} pointed out that the vote just passed to all intents and purposes annulled the business of the evening, whereupon Mr. {{sc|Alcock}} said it was too late to proceed further, and moved that the meeting do adjourn till Tuesday next, Dec. 1, and it was so resolved.}}</ref><ref name=\"dec_1\"/>  A number of representatives who supported rugby-style football did not attend this additional meeting,<ref>Harvey (2005), pp. 144-145</ref> resulting in hacking and carrying being banned.<ref name=\"dec_1\">{{cite news |title=The Football Association |work=Supplement to Bell's Life in London |date=1863-12-05 |page=1 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Football_Association_(Bell%27s_Life_in_London),_1863-12-05.png}}</ref>\n\n[[Francis Maule Campbell|Francis Campbell]] of [[Blackheath FC|Blackheath]], the most prominent \"hacking\" club, accused Pember of managing the 24 November meeting improperly in order to prevent the \"pro-hacking\" laws from being adopted.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Football Association |work=Supplement to Bell's Life in London |date=1863-12-05 |page=1 |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Football_Association_(Bell%27s_Life_in_London),_1863-12-05.png |quote={{sc|Mr Campbell}}: [...] When the last meeting was held for the express purpose [...] of settling the proposed laws, they ought to have gone on with the rules as proposed by the association, and not taken the course they did as to the Cambridge rules, but the resolution and amendments had been proposed and passed in the way they had been without being properly put to the meeting, because it was found that the \"hacking\" party were too strong}}</ref> Pember strongly denied such an \"accusation of ungentlemanly conduct\".

The original 1863 laws had permitted a goal to be scored at any height between two posts eight yards apart.  Pember urged that a tape be strung between the posts, with a goal counting only if the ball went below the tape.  The meeting agreed to make this change, setting the height of the tape at 8 feet.  The dimensions of the goal have remained the same ever since, with the tape subsequently replaced by a crossbar.<ref name=\"fa_1866\">{{cite news |work=Bell's Life in London |issue=2288 |page=7 |date=1866-02-24 |title=The Football Association |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Football_Association_(Bell%27s_Life_in_London)_1866-02-24.png}}</ref>\nPember also \"strongly objected\" to the practice of striking the ball with the hands, at that time allowed by the FA laws, saying that it was \"not football, as the game had to be played with the feet, and not with the hands\":<ref name=\"fa_1866\"/> \"knocking on\" was subsequently outlawed in 1867.\n\nAt the same meeting, Pember accepted an invitation from [[Sheffield FC]] to a match under Association rules, and captained the victorious London team in the ensuing [[London v Sheffield (1866)|London v Sheffield]] match, played in March 1866.

In the 1930s, his orchestra toured in Europe. Although widely considered to have been a pivotal figure in the history of jazz, Ellington embraced the phrase \"beyond category\" as a liberating principle and referred to his music as part of the more general category of American Music rather than to a musical genre such as [[jazz]].<ref name=\"Tucker-1\">{{Harvnb|Tucker|1995|p=6}} writes: \"He tried to avoid the word 'jazz' preferring 'Negro' or 'American' music. He claimed there were only two types of music, 'good' and 'bad' ... And he embraced a phrase coined by his colleague [[Billy Strayhorn]] \u2013 'beyond category' \u2013 as a liberating principle.\"</ref>\n\nSome of the jazz musicians who were members of Ellington's orchestra, such as saxophonist [[Johnny Hodges]], are considered to be among the best players in the idiom. Ellington melded them into the best-known orchestral unit in the history of jazz. Some members stayed with the orchestra for several decades. A master at writing miniatures for the three-minute 78 rpm recording format, Ellington wrote more than one thousand compositions; his extensive body of work is the largest recorded personal jazz legacy, with many of his pieces having become [[Standard (music)|standards]]. Ellington also recorded songs written by his bandsmen, for example [[Juan Tizol]]'s \"[[Caravan (1937 song)|Caravan]]\", and \"[[Perdido (song)|Perdido]]\", which brought a [[Spanish tinge]] to big band jazz. In the early 1940s, Ellington began a nearly thirty-year collaboration with composer-arranger-pianist [[Billy Strayhorn]], whom he called his writing and arranging companion.<ref>Hajdu, David (1996), ''Lush Life: A Biography of Billy Strayhorn'', New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, {{ISBN|978-0-86547-512-0}}, p. 170.</ref> With Strayhorn, he composed many extended compositions, or suites, as well as additional short pieces. Following an appearance at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]], in July 1956, Ellington and his orchestra enjoyed a major revival and embarked on world tours. Ellington recorded for most American record companies of his era, performed in several films, scored several, and composed a handful of stage musicals.\n\nEllington was noted for his inventive use of the orchestra, or big band, and for his eloquence and charisma. His reputation continued to rise after he died, and he was awarded a posthumous [[Pulitzer Prize Special Citations and Awards|Pulitzer Prize Special Award]] for music in 1999.<ref name=pulitzer/>\n\n==Early life and education==\nEllington was born on April 29, 1899, to James Edward Ellington and Daisy (Kennedy) Ellington in Washington, D.C. Both his parents were pianists. Daisy primarily played [[parlor song]]s, and James preferred operatic [[aria]]s. They lived with  Daisy's parents at 2129 Ida Place (now Ward Place), NW, in D.C.'s [[West End, Washington, D.C.|West End]] neighborhood.<ref name=\"Lawrence-1\">{{Harvnb|Lawrence|2001|p=1}}.</ref> Duke's father was born in [[Lincolnton, North Carolina]], on April 15, 1879, and moved to D.C. in 1886 with his parents.<ref name=\"Lawrence-2\">{{Harvnb|Lawrence|2001|p=2}}.</ref> Daisy Kennedy was born in Washington, D.C., on January 4, 1879, the daughter of a former American [[slave]]<!-- which parent?-->.<ref name=\"Lawrence-1\" /><ref>{{Harvnb|Hasse|1995|p=21}}.</ref> James Ellington made [[wikt:blueprint|blueprint]]s for the [[United States Navy]].\n\nWhen Edward Ellington was a child, his family showed racial pride and support in their home, as did many other families. African Americans in D.C. worked to protect their children from the era's [[Jim Crow]] laws.<ref>{{cite web |last1= Cohen|first1=Harvey|title=An excerpt from Duke Ellington's America |url= http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/112633.html|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=2010}}</ref>\n\nAt age seven, Ellington began taking piano lessons from Marietta Clinkscales. Daisy surrounded her son with dignified women to reinforce his manners and teach him elegance. His childhood friends noticed that his casual, offhand manner and dapper dress gave him the bearing of a young nobleman,<ref name= \"Terkel\">{{Harvnb|Terkel|2002}}.</ref> so they began calling him \"Duke\". Ellington credited his friend Edgar McEntree for the nickname. \"I think he felt that in order for me to be eligible for his constant companionship, I should have a title. So he called me Duke.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Ellington|1976|p=20}}.</ref>\n\nThough Ellington took piano lessons, he was more interested in baseball. \"[[Teddy Roosevelt|President Roosevelt (Teddy)]] would come by on his horse sometimes, and stop and watch us play\", he recalled.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ellington|1976|p=10}}.</ref> Ellington went to [[Armstrong High School (Washington, D.C.)|Armstrong Technical High School]] in Washington, D.C. His first job was selling peanuts at [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]] baseball games.\n\nEllington started sneaking into Frank Holiday's Poolroom at age fourteen. Hearing the music of the poolroom pianists ignited Ellington's love for the instrument, and he began to take his piano studies seriously. Among the many piano players he listened to were Doc Perry, Lester Dishman, Louis Brown, [[Turner Layton]], Gertie Wells, Clarence Bowser, Sticky Mack, Blind Johnny, [[Cliff Jackson (musician)|Cliff Jackson]], [[Claude Hopkins]], Phil Wurd, Caroline Thornton, [[Luckey Roberts]], [[Eubie Blake]], Joe Rochester, and Harvey Brooks.<ref name=\"Music on My Mind\">{{cite book |last=Smith|first=Willie the Lion| title= Music on My Mind: The Memoirs of an American Pianist, Foreword by Duke Ellington|year=1964|pages=ix|publisher=Doubleday & Company Inc |location=New York City|isbn=}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1914, while working as a [[soda jerk]] at the Poodle Dog Caf\u00e9, Ellington wrote his first composition, \"Soda Fountain [[ragtime|Rag]]\" (also known as the \"Poodle Dog Rag\"). He created the piece by ear, as he had not yet learned to read and write music. \"I would play the 'Soda Fountain Rag' as a [[one-step]], [[two-step (dance move)|two-step]], [[waltz]], [[tango]], and [[fox trot]]\", Ellington recalled. \"Listeners never knew it was the same piece.

Wilson Company| year= 1970}}</ref> In his autobiography, ''Music is my Mistress'' (1973), Ellington wrote that he missed more lessons than he attended, feeling at the time that playing the piano was not his talent.\n\nEllington continued listening to, watching, and imitating [[ragtime]] pianists, not only in Washington, D.C., but in [[Philadelphia]] and [[Atlantic City]], where he vacationed with his mother during the summer.<ref name=\"current\"/>  He would sometimes hear strange music played by those who could not afford much sheet music, so for variations, they played the sheets upside down.<ref>[[Mercer Ellington]] to [[Marian McPartland]], on ''Piano Jazz'', rebroadcast on ''Hot Jazz Saturday Night'', [[WAMU]], 2018 April 28.</ref> Henry Lee Grant, a [[Dunbar High School (Washington, D.C.)|Dunbar High School]] music teacher, gave him private lessons in harmony. With the additional guidance of Washington pianist and band leader Oliver \"Doc\" Perry, Ellington learned to read [[sheet music]], project a professional style, and improve his technique. Ellington was also inspired by his first encounters with [[Stride (music)|stride pianists]] [[James P. Johnson]] and Luckey Roberts. Later in New York he took advice from [[Will Marion Cook]], [[Fats Waller]], and [[Sidney Bechet]]. Ellington started to play gigs in caf\u00e9s and clubs in and around Washington, D.C. His attachment to music was so strong that in 1916 he turned down an art scholarship to the [[Pratt Institute]] in Brooklyn. Three months before graduating he dropped out of Armstrong Manual Training School, where he was studying commercial art.<ref name= \"simmonds\">{{cite news |url= http://www.lasentinel.net/Duke-Ellington.html| title=Duke Ellington |last= Simmonds |first=Yussuf|date=September 11, 2008 |work=[[Los Angeles Sentinel]] |accessdate= July 14, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early career===\nWorking as a freelance sign-painter from 1917, Ellington began assembling groups to play for dances. In 1919 he met drummer [[Sonny Greer]] from New Jersey, who encouraged Ellington's ambition to become a professional musician. Ellington built his music business through his day job: when a customer asked him to make a sign for a dance or party, he would ask if they had musical entertainment; if not, Ellington would offer to play for the occasion. He also had a messenger job with the U.S. Navy and State departments, where he made a wide range of contacts.\n\nEllington moved out of his parents' home and bought his own as he became a successful pianist. At first, he played in other ensembles, and in late 1917 formed his first group, \"The Duke's Serenaders\" (\"Colored Syncopators\", his telephone directory advertising proclaimed).<ref name= \"simmonds\"/> He was also the group's booking agent. His first play date was at the True Reformer's Hall, where he took home 75 cents.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hasse|1993|p=45}}.</ref>\n\nEllington played throughout the D.C. area and into [[Virginia]] for private society balls and embassy parties. The band included childhood friend [[Otto Hardwick]], who began playing the string bass, then moved to C-melody sax and finally settled on alto saxophone; [[Arthur Whetsol]] on trumpet; [[Elmer Snowden]] on banjo; and Sonny Greer on drums. The band thrived, performing for both African-American and white audiences, a rarity in the [[Racial segregation|segregated]] society of the day.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Cohen| first= Harvey G.|date=Autumn 2004 |title=The Marketing of Duke Ellington: Setting the Strategy for an African American Maestro |journal=The Journal of African American History |volume= 89|issue=4|pages=291\u2013315 |jstor=4134056|doi=10.2307/4134056}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Duke Ellington St. Louis Toodle-Oo.jpg|thumb|British pressing of \"East St. Louis Toodle-Oo\" (1927)]]\n\nWhen his drummer Sonny Greer was invited to join the [[Wilber Sweatman]] Orchestra in New York City, Ellington left his successful career in D.C. and moved to [[Harlem]], ultimately becoming part of the [[Harlem Renaissance]]. New dance crazes such as the [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]] emerged in Harlem, as well as African-American [[musical theater]], including [[Eubie Blake]]'s ''[[Shuffle Along]]''. After the young musicians left the Sweatman Orchestra to strike out on their own, they found an emerging jazz scene that was highly competitive with difficult inroad. They [[pool hustling|hustled pool]] by day and played whatever gigs they could find. The young band met stride pianist [[Willie \"The Lion\" Smith]], who introduced them to the scene and gave them some money. They played at [[Rent party|rent-house parties]] for income. After a few months, the young musicians returned to Washington, D.C., feeling discouraged.\n\nIn June 1923, a gig in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]],  another at the prestigious Exclusive Club in Harlem. This was followed in September 1923 by a move to the Hollywood Club (at 49th and Broadway) and a four-year engagement, which gave Ellington a solid artistic base. He was known to play the [[bugle]] at the end of each performance. The group was initially called Elmer Snowden and his Black Sox Orchestra and had seven members, including trumpeter [[James \"Bubber\" Miley]]. They renamed themselves The Washingtonians. Snowden left the group in early 1924 and Ellington took over as bandleader. After a fire, the club was re-opened as the Club Kentucky (often referred to as the Kentucky Club).\n\nEllington then made eight records in 1924, receiving composing credit on three including \"Choo Choo\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hasse|1993|p= 79}}.</ref> In 1925, Ellington contributed four songs to ''[[Chocolate Kiddies]]'' starring Lottie Gee and [[Adelaide Hall]],<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.myspace.com/adelaidehall/photos/albums/chocolate-kiddies-european-tour-1925/2789756 |title= Adelaide Hall &#124; CHOCOLATE KIDDIES EUROPEAN TOUR 1925 Photo Album |via= Myspace.com |accessdate= February 2, 2013}}</ref> an all-African-American revue which introduced European audiences to African-American styles and performers. Duke Ellington and his Kentucky Club Orchestra grew to a group of ten players; they developed their own sound by displaying the non-traditional expression of Ellington's arrangements, the street rhythms of Harlem, and the exotic-sounding trombone growls and wah-wahs, high-squealing trumpets, and saxophone blues licks of the band members. For a short time, soprano saxophonist [[Sidney Bechet]] played with them, imparting his propulsive [[Swing (jazz performance style)|swing]] and superior musicianship to the young band members.\n\n===Cotton Club engagement===\nIn October 1926, Ellington made an agreement with agent-publisher [[Irving Mills]],<ref>Gary Giddins ''Visions of Jazz: The First Century'', New York & Oxford, 1998, pp. 112\u201313.</ref> giving Mills a 45% interest in Ellington's future.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hasse|1993|p=90}}.</ref> Mills had an eye for new talent and published compositions by [[Hoagy Carmichael]], [[Dorothy Fields]], and [[Harold Arlen]] early in their careers. After recording a handful of acoustic titles during 1924\u201326, Ellington's signing with Mills allowed him to record prolifically, although sometimes he recorded different versions of the same tune. Mills often took a co-composer credit. From the beginning of their relationship, Mills arranged recording sessions on nearly every label including [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]], [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]], [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], [[Okeh Records|OKeh]], [[Pathe Records|Path\u00ea]] (and its Perfect label), the ARC/Plaza group of labels (Oriole, Domino, Jewel, Banner) and their dime-store labels (Cameo, Lincoln, Romeo), Hit of the Week, and Columbia's cheaper labels (Harmony, Diva, Velvet Tone, Clarion) labels which gave Ellington popular recognition. On OKeh, his records were usually issued as The Harlem Footwarmers, while the Brunswick's were usually issued as The Jungle Band. Whoopee Makers and the Ten Black Berries were other pseudonyms.\n\nIn September 1927, [[King Oliver]] turned down a regular booking for his group as the house band at Harlem's [[Cotton Club]];<ref>A.

At the Cotton Club, Ellington's group performed all the music for the revues, which mixed comedy, dance numbers, vaudeville, burlesque, music, and [[Prohibition in the United States|illicit alcohol]]. The musical numbers were composed by Jimmy McHugh and the lyrics by Dorothy Fields (later Harold Arlen and [[Ted Koehler]]), with some Ellington originals mixed in. (Here he moved in with a dancer, his second wife [[Mildred Dixon]]). Weekly radio broadcasts from the club gave Ellington national exposure, while Ellington also recorded Fields-JMcHugh and [[Fats Waller]]\u2013[[Andy Razaf]] songs.\n\n[[File:Vu (magazine) N\u00b077.JPG|thumb|Adelaide Hall - [[Adelaide Hall]], recorded [[Creole Love Call]] with Ellington in 1927.

In October 1927, Ellington and his Orchestra recorded several compositions with [[Adelaide Hall]]. One side in particular, \"[[Creole Love Call]]\", became a worldwide sensation and gave both Ellington and Hall their first hit record.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjI1tbAXO2w |title=Adelaide Hall talks about 1920s Harlem and Creole Love Call |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref><ref>Williams, Iain Cameron, [http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/underneath-a-harlem-moon-9780826458933/ ''Underneath a Harlem Moon ...

An alcoholic, Miley had to leave the band before they gained wider fame. He died in 1932 at the age of 29, but he was an important influence on [[Cootie Williams]], who replaced him.\n\nIn 1929, the Cotton Club Orchestra appeared on stage for several months in [[Florenz Ziegfeld]]'s Show Girl, along with vaudeville stars [[Jimmy Durante]], [[Eddie Foy, Jr.]], [[Ruby Keeler]], and with music and lyrics by [[George Gershwin]] and [[Gus Kahn]]. [[Will Vodery]], Ziegfeld's musical supervisor, recommended Ellington for the show, and, according to John Hasse's ''Beyond Category: The Life and Genius of Duke Ellington'', \"Perhaps during the run of Show Girl, Ellington received what he later termed 'valuable lessons in orchestration\u2019 from Will Vodery.\u201d In his 1946 biography, ''Duke Ellington'', [[Barry Ulanov]] wrote:\n\n{{quote|From Vodery, as he (Ellington) says himself, he drew his [[chromatic scale|chromatic]] convictions, his uses of the tones ordinarily extraneous to the [[diatonic scale]], with the consequent alteration of the harmonic character of his music, its broadening, The deepening of his resources.

Actually his serious appreciation of those and other modern composers, came after his meeting with Vodery.<ref>Ulanov, Barry. ''Duke Ellington'', Creative Age Press, 1946.</ref>}}\n\nEllington's film work began with ''[[Black and Tan (film)|Black and Tan]]'' (1929), a 19-minute all-African-American [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] short<ref>Stratemann, Dr. Klaus. ''Duke Ellington: Day by Day and Film by Film'', 1992. {{ISBN|87-88043-34-7}}</ref> in which he played the hero \"Duke\". He also appeared in the [[Amos 'n' Andy]] film ''[[Check and Double Check]]'', released in 1930. That year, Ellington and his Orchestra connected with a whole different audience in a concert with [[Maurice Chevalier]] and they also performed at the [[Roseland Ballroom]], \"America's foremost ballroom\". Australian-born composer [[Percy Grainger]] was an early admirer and supporter. He wrote \"The three greatest composers who ever lived are [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Frederick Delius|Delius]] and Duke Ellington. Unfortunately Bach is dead, Delius is very ill but we are happy to have with us today The Duke\".<ref>John Bird, ''Percy Grainger''.</ref> Ellington's first period at the Cotton Club concluded in 1931.\n\n===The early 1930s===\nEllington led the orchestra by conducting from the keyboard using piano cues and visual gestures; very rarely did he conduct using a baton. By 1932 his orchestra consisted of six brass instruments, four reeds, and a four-man rhythm section.<ref name=\"Hodeir\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/08731|title=Ellington, Duke|last=Hodeir|first=Andr\u00e9|date=|website=Oxford Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|access-date=September 15, 2016}}</ref> As a bandleader, Ellington was not a strict disciplinarian; he maintained control of his orchestra with a combination of charm, humor, flattery and astute psychology. A complex, private person, he revealed his feelings to only his closest intimates and effectively used his public persona to deflect attention away from himself.\n\nEllington signed exclusively to Brunswick in 1932 and stayed with them through late 1936 (albeit with a short-lived 1933\u201334 switch to Victor when Irving Mills temporarily moved him and his other acts from Brunswick).\n\nAs the Depression worsened, the recording industry was in crisis, dropping over 90% of its artists by 1933.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hasse|1993|p=166}}.</ref> [[Ivie Anderson]] was hired as the Ellington Orchestra's featured vocalist in 1931. She is the vocalist on \"[[It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)]]\" (1932) among other recordings. Sonny Greer had been providing occasional vocals and continued to do in a cross-talk feature with Anderson. Radio exposure helped maintain Ellington's public profile as his orchestra began to tour. The other records of this era include: \"[[Mood Indigo]]\" (1930), \"[[Sophisticated Lady]]\" (1933), \"[[(In My) Solitude|Solitude]]\" (1934), and \"[[In a Sentimental Mood]]\" (1935)\n\nWhile the band's United States audience remained mainly African-American in this period, the Ellington orchestra had a significant following overseas, exemplified by the success of their trip to England and Scotland in 1933 and their 1934 visit to the European mainland. The British visit saw Ellington win praise from members of the serious music community, including composer [[Constant Lambert]], which gave a boost to Ellington's interest in composing longer works.\n\nThose longer pieces had already begun to appear. He had composed and recorded \"Creole Rhapsody\" as early as 1931 (issued as both sides of a 12\" record for Victor and both sides of a 10\" record for Brunswick), and a tribute to his mother, \"Reminiscing in Tempo\", took four 10\" record sides to record in 1935 after her death in that year. ''[[Symphony in Black]]'' (also 1935), a short film, featured his extended piece 'A Rhapsody of Negro Life'. It introduced [[Billie Holiday]], and won an [[Academy Award]] as the best musical short subject.<ref>Schuller, 1989, p. 94.</ref> Ellington and his Orchestra also appeared in the features ''[[Murder at the Vanities]]'' and ''[[Belle of the Nineties]]'' (both 1934).\n\nFor agent Mills the attention was a publicity triumph, as Ellington was now internationally known. On the band's tour through the segregated South in 1934, they avoided some of the traveling difficulties of African-Americans by touring in private railcars. These provided easy accommodations, dining, and storage for equipment while avoiding the indignities of segregated facilities.\n\nCompetition was intensifying, though, as swing bands like [[Benny Goodman]]'s began to receive popular attention. Swing dancing became a youth phenomenon, particularly with white college audiences, and danceability drove record sales and bookings. [[Jukebox]]es proliferated nationwide, spreading the gospel of swing. Ellington's band could certainly swing, but their strengths were mood, nuance, and richness of composition, hence his statement \"jazz is music, swing is business\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hasse|1993|p=203}}.</ref>\n\n===The later 1930s===\nFrom 1936, Ellington began to make recordings with smaller groups (sextets, octets, and nonets) drawn from his then-15-man orchestra and he composed pieces intended to feature a specific instrumentalist, as with \"Jeep's Blues\" for [[Johnny Hodges]], \"Yearning for Love\" for [[Lawrence Brown (jazz trombonist)|Lawrence Brown]], \"Trumpet in Spades\" for [[Rex Stewart]], \"[[Echoes of Harlem]]\" for [[Cootie Williams]] and \"Clarinet Lament\" for [[Barney Bigard]]. In 1937, Ellington returned to the Cotton Club, which had relocated to the mid-town [[Theater District]]. In the summer of that year, his father died, and due to many expenses, Ellington's finances were tight, although his situation improved the following year.\n\nAfter leaving agent Irving Mills, he signed on with the [[William Morris Agency]]. Mills though continued to record Ellington. After only a year, his Master and Variety labels (the small groups had recorded for the latter), collapsed in late 1937, Mills placed Ellington back on Brunswick and those small group units on Vocalion through to 1940. Well known sides continued to be recorded, \"[[Caravan (1937 song)|Caravan]]\" in 1937, and \"I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart\" the following year.\n\n[[File:Duke Ellington in ons land.ogv|thumb|Ellington in 1939]]\n[[Billy Strayhorn]], originally hired as a lyricist, began his association with Ellington in 1939.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billystrayhorn.com/biography.htm |title=WILLIAM THOMAS STRAYHORN |last=Stone |first=Sonjia (ed) |year=1983 |work=Billy Strayhorn Songs |publisher=University of North Carolina \u2013 Chapel Hill |accessdate=July 14, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622191412/http://www.billystrayhorn.com/biography.htm |archivedate=June 22, 2009 }}</ref> Nicknamed \"Swee' Pea\" for his mild manner, Strayhorn soon became a vital member of the Ellington organization.

The short-lived [[Jimmy Blanton]] transformed the use of double bass in jazz, allowing it to function as a solo/melodic instrument rather than a rhythm instrument alone. Terminal illness forced him to leave by late 1941 after only about two years. [[Ben Webster]], the Orchestra's first regular tenor saxophonist, whose main tenure with Ellington spanned 1939 to 1943, started a rivalry with Johnny Hodges as the Orchestra's foremost voice in the sax section.\n\nTrumpeter [[Ray Nance]] joined, replacing [[Cootie Williams]] who had defected to [[Benny Goodman]]. Additionally, Nance added violin to the instrumental colors Ellington had at his disposal. Recordings exist of Nance's first concert date on November 7, 1940, at [[Fargo, North Dakota]]. Privately made by [[Jack Towers]] and Dick Burris, these recordings were first legitimately issued in 1978 as ''[[Duke Ellington at Fargo, 1940 Live]]''; they are among the earliest of innumerable live performances which survive. Nance was also an occasional vocalist, although [[Herb Jeffries]] was the main male vocalist in this era (until 1943) while [[Al Hibbler]] (who replaced Jeffries in 1943) continued until 1951. Ivie Anderson left in 1942 for health reasons after eleven years: the longest term of any of Ellington's vocalists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musicians.allaboutjazz.com/musician.php?id=3424 |title=Musician Ivie Anderson (Vocal) @ All About Jazz |publisher=Musicians.allaboutjazz.com |accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOnce again recording for Victor (from 1940), with the small groups recording for their [[Bluebird Records|Bluebird]] label, three-minute masterpieces on [[Gramophone record|78 rpm record]] sides continued to flow from Ellington, Billy Strayhorn, Ellington's son [[Mercer Ellington]], and members of the Orchestra. \"[[Cotton Tail]]\", \"Main Stem\", \"[[Harlem Air Shaft]]\", \"Jack the Bear\", and dozens of others date from this period. Strayhorn's \"[[Take the \"A\" Train]]\" a hit in 1941, became the band's theme, replacing \"[[East St. Louis Toodle-Oo]]\".

In this, he was helped by Strayhorn, who had enjoyed a more thorough training in the forms associated with classical music than Ellington. The first of these, ''[[Black, Brown and Beige]]'' (1943), was dedicated to telling the story of African-Americans, and the place of slavery and the church in their history. ''Black, Brown and Beige'' debuted at [[Carnegie Hall]] on January 23, 1943, beginning an annual series of Ellington concerts at the venue over the next four years. While some jazz musicians had played at Carnegie Hall before, none had performed anything as elaborate as Ellington's work. Unfortunately, starting a regular pattern, Ellington's longer works were generally not well received.\n\nA partial exception was ''Jump for Joy'', a full-length musical based on themes of African-American identity, debuted on July 10, 1941, at the [[Mayan Theater]] in Los Angeles. Hollywood luminaries such as actors [[John Garfield]] and [[Mickey Rooney]] invested in the production, and [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Orson Welles]] offered to direct.<ref>Harvey G. Cohen, ''Duke Ellington's America'', Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 2010, p. 189.</ref> At one performance though, Garfield insisted Herb Jeffries, who was light-skinned, should wear make-up. Ellington objected in the interval, and compared Jeffries to [[Al Jolson]]. The change was reverted, and the singer later commented that the audience must have thought he was an entirely different character in the second half of the show.<ref>Cohen 2010, pp. 190\u201391.</ref>\n\nAlthough it had sold-out performances, and received positive reviews,<ref>Cohen 2010, pp. 191\u201392.</ref> it ran for only 122 performances until September 29, 1941, with a brief revival in November of that year. Its subject matter did not make it appealing to Broadway; Ellington had unfulfilled plans to take it there.<ref>{{cite web|last=Brent |first=David |url=http://indianapublicmedia.org/nightlights/jump-for-joy-duke-ellingtons-celebratory-musical/ |title=Jump For Joy: Duke Ellington's Celebratory Musical &#124; Night Lights Classic Jazz \u2013 WFIU Public Radio |publisher=Indianapublicmedia.org |date=February 6, 2008 |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref> Despite this disappointment, a Broadway production of Ellington's ''[[Beggar's Holiday]]'', his sole book musical, premiered on December 23, 1946.<ref>Lawrence, 2001, p. 287.</ref> under the direction of [[Nicholas Ray]].\n\nThe settlement of the [[1942-43 musicians' strike|first recording ban of 1942\u201343]], leading to an increase in royalties paid to musicians, had a serious effect on the financial viability of the big bands, including Ellington's Orchestra. His income as a songwriter ultimately subsidized it. Although he always spent lavishly and drew a respectable income from the Orchestra's operations, the band's income often just covered expenses.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hasse|1993|p=274}}.</ref>\n\n===Early post-war years===\nMusicians enlisting in the military and travel restrictions made touring difficult for the big bands and dancing became subject to a new tax, which continued for many years, affecting the choices of club owners. By the time World War II ended, the focus of popular music was shifting towards singing crooners such as [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Jo Stafford]]. As the cost of hiring big bands had increased, club owners now found smaller jazz groups more cost-effective. Some of Ellington's new works, such as the wordless vocal feature \"Transblucency\" (1946) with [[Kay Davis]], was not going to have a similar reach as the newly emerging stars. \n[[File:Jazz musician Duke Ellington.JPEG|thumb|Ellington poses with his piano at the KFG Radio Studio November 3, 1954.]]\n\nEllington continued on his own course through these tectonic shifts. While [[Count Basie]] was forced to disband his whole ensemble and work as an octet for a time, Ellington was able to tour most of Western Europe between April 6 and June 30, 1950, with the orchestra playing 74 dates over 77 days.<ref name=\"Lawrence291\">Lawrence, 2001, p. 291.</ref> During the tour, according to Sonny Greer, the newer works were not performed, though Ellington's extended composition, ''[[Harlem (Ellington)|Harlem]]'' (1950) was in the process of being completed at this time. Ellington later presented its score to music-loving President [[Harry Truman]]. Also during his time in Europe, Ellington would compose the music for a stage production by [[Orson Welles]]. Titled ''Time Runs'' in Paris<ref>{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/3965054/Eartha-Kitt.html|title=Eartha Kitt: Singer who rose from poverty to captivate audiences around the world with her purring voice|date=December 26, 2008|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=December 14, 2014}}</ref> and ''An Evening With Orson Welles'' in [[Frankfurt]], the variety show also featured a newly discovered [[Eartha Kitt]], who performed Ellington's original song \"Hungry Little Trouble\" as [[Helen of Troy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/eartha-kitt-wins-raves-in-welles-show-at-frankfurt-1.16046|title=Eartha Kitt wins raves in Welles' show at Frankfurt|author=Win Fanning |date=August 13, 1950|work=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]|accessdate=December 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1951, Ellington suffered a significant loss of personnel: Sonny Greer, Lawrence Brown and, most importantly, [[Johnny Hodges]] left to pursue other ventures, although only Greer was a permanent departee. Drummer [[Louie Bellson]] replaced Greer, and his \"Skin Deep\" was a hit for Ellington. Tenor player [[Paul Gonsalves]] had joined in December 1950<ref name=\"Lawrence291\"/> after periods with [[Count Basie]] and [[Dizzy Gillespie]] and stayed for the rest of his life, while [[Clark Terry]] joined in November 1951.<ref>Ken Vail ''Duke's Diary: The Life of Duke Ellington'', Lanham, Maryland & Oxford, UK: Scarecrow Press, 2002, p. 28.</ref>\n\nDuring the early 1950s, Ellington's career was at a low point with his style being generally seen as outmoded, but his reputation did not suffer as badly as some artists. [[Andr\u00e9 Previn]] said in 1952: \"You know, [[Stan Kenton]] can stand in front of a thousand fiddles and a thousand brass and make a dramatic gesture and every studio arranger can nod his head and say, ''Oh, yes, that's done like this.'' But Duke merely lifts his finger, three horns make a sound, and I don\u2019t know what it is!\"<ref>[[Ralph J. Gleason]] \"Duke Excites, Mystifies Without Any Pretension\", ''Down Beat'', November 5, 1952, reprinted in ''Jazz Perspectives'' Vol. 2, No. 2, July 2008, pp. 215\u201349.</ref> However, by 1955, after three years of recording for [[Capitol Records|Capitol]], Ellington lacked a regular recording affiliation.\n\n===Career revival===\nEllington's appearance at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]] on July 7, 1956 returned him to wider prominence and introduced him to a new generation of fans. The feature \"[[Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue]]\" comprised two tunes that had been in the band's book since 1937 but largely forgotten until Ellington, who had abruptly ended the band's scheduled set because of the late arrival of four key players, called the two tunes as the time was approaching midnight. Announcing that the two pieces would be separated by an interlude played by tenor saxophonist [[Paul Gonsalves]], Ellington proceeded to lead the band through the two pieces, with Gonsalves' 27-chorus marathon solo whipping the crowd into a frenzy, leading the Maestro to play way beyond the curfew time despite urgent pleas from festival organizer [[George Wein]] to bring the program to an end.\n\nThe concert made international headlines, led to one of only five ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover stories dedicated to a jazz musician,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19560820,00.html |title=Jazzman Duke Ellington|work=TIME |date=August 20, 1956 |accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref> and resulted in an album produced by [[George Avakian]] that would become the best-selling LP of Ellington's career.<ref name=\"Sohmer\">Jack Sohmer [http://jazztimes.com/articles/10496-ellington-at-newport-1956-complete-duke-ellington \"Duke Ellington: ''Ellington at Newport 1956'' (Complete)\"] ''JazzTimes'', October 1999.</ref> Much of the music on the vinyl LP was, in effect, simulated, with only about 40% actually from the concert itself. According to Avakian, Ellington was dissatisfied with aspects of the performance and felt the musicians had been under rehearsed.<ref name=\"Sohmer\"/> The band assembled the next day to re-record several of the numbers with the addition of artificial crowd noise, none of which was disclosed to purchasers of the album. Not until 1999 was the concert recording properly released for the first time. The revived attention brought about by the Newport appearance should not have surprised anyone, Johnny Hodges had returned the previous year, and Ellington's collaboration with Strayhorn had been renewed around the same time, under terms more amenable to the younger man.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe original ''[[Ellington at Newport]]'' album was the first release in a new recording contract with [[Columbia Records]] which yielded several years of recording stability, mainly under producer [[Irving Townsend]], who coaxed both commercial and artistic productions from Ellington.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wein|first=George|title=Myself Among Others: A Life in Music|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2003}}</ref>\n\nIn 1957, [[CBS]] (Columbia Records' parent corporation) aired a live television production of ''[[A Drum Is a Woman]]'', an allegorical suite which received mixed reviews. His hope that television would provide a significant new outlet for his type of jazz was not fulfilled. Tastes and trends had moved on without him. Festival appearances at the new [[Monterey Jazz Festival]] and elsewhere provided venues for live exposure, and a European tour in 1958 was well received. ''[[Such Sweet Thunder]]'' (1957), based on [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] plays and characters, and ''[[The Ellington Suites|The Queen's Suite]]'' (1958), dedicated to Britain's [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], were products of the renewed impetus which the Newport appearance helped to create, although the latter work was not commercially issued at the time. The late 1950s also saw [[Ella Fitzgerald]] record her ''[[Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Duke Ellington Songbook|Duke Ellington Songbook]]'' (Verve) with Ellington and his orchestra\u2014a recognition that Ellington's songs had now become part of the cultural canon known as the '[[Great American Songbook]]'.\n\n[[File:James Stewart-Duke Ellington in Anatomy of a Murder trailer.jpg|thumb|[[Jimmy Stewart]] and Ellington in ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]''.]]\nAround this time Ellington and Strayhorn began to work on film soundtrack [[Film score|scoring]]. The first of these was ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]'' (1959),<ref name=\"Hodeir\"/> a courtroom drama directed by [[Otto Preminger]] and featuring [[James Stewart]], in which Ellington appeared fronting a roadhouse combo. This was followed by ''[[Paris Blues]]'' (1961), which featured [[Paul Newman]] and [[Sidney Poitier]] as jazz musicians.

The Ellington and [[Count Basie]] orchestras recorded together with the album ''[[First Time! The Count Meets the Duke]]'' (1961). During a period when Ellington was between recording contracts, he made records with [[Louis Armstrong]] ([[Roulette Records|Roulette]]), [[Coleman Hawkins]], [[John Coltrane]] (both for [[Impulse! Records|Impulse]]) and participated in a session with [[Charles Mingus]] and [[Max Roach]] which produced the ''[[Money Jungle]]'' ([[United Artists Records|United Artists]]) album. He signed to [[Frank Sinatra]]'s new [[Reprise Records|Reprise label]], but the association with the label was short-lived.\n\nMusicians who had previously worked with Ellington returned to the Orchestra as members: Lawrence Brown in 1960 and [[Cootie Williams]] in 1962.\n\n<blockquote>The writing and playing of music is a matter of intent.... You can't just throw a paint brush against the wall and call whatever happens art. My music fits the tonal personality of the player. I think too strongly in terms of altering my music to fit the performer to be impressed by accidental music. You can't take doodling seriously.<ref name=\"current\"/></blockquote>\n\nHe was now performing all over the world; a significant part of each year was spent on overseas tours. As a consequence, he formed new working relationships with artists from around the world, including the Swedish vocalist [[Alice Babs]], and the South African musicians [[Abdullah Ibrahim|Dollar Brand]] and [[Sathima Bea Benjamin]] (''A Morning in Paris'', 1963/1997).\n\nEllington wrote an original score for director [[Michael Langham]]'s production of Shakespeare's ''[[Timon of Athens]]'' at the [[Stratford Shakespeare Festival|Stratford Festival]] in Ontario, Canada which opened on July 29, 1963. Langham has used it for several subsequent productions, including a much later adaptation by [[Stanley Silverman]] which expands the score with some of Ellington's best-known works.\n\n===Last years===\n[[File:Richard Nixon and Duke Ellington 1969.jpg|thumb|Ellington receiving the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] from [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]], 1969.]]\n\nEllington was shortlisted for the [[Pulitzer Prize for Music]] in 1965 but no prize was ultimately awarded that year.<ref name=Giddins>[[Gary Giddins]], \"How Come Jazz Isn't Dead\", pp. 39\u201355 in {{Harvnb|Weisbard|2004|pp=41\u201342}}.

In the 1930s, his orchestra toured in Europe. Although widely considered to have been a pivotal figure in the history of jazz, Ellington embraced the phrase \"beyond category\" as a liberating principle and referred to his music as part of the more general category of American Music rather than to a musical genre such as [[jazz]].<ref name=\"Tucker-1\">{{Harvnb|Tucker|1995|p=6}} writes: \"He tried to avoid the word 'jazz' preferring 'Negro' or 'American' music. He claimed there were only two types of music, 'good' and 'bad' ... And he embraced a phrase coined by his colleague [[Billy Strayhorn]] \u2013 'beyond category' \u2013 as a liberating principle.\"</ref>\n\nSome of the jazz musicians who were members of Ellington's orchestra, such as saxophonist [[Johnny Hodges]], are considered to be among the best players in the idiom. Ellington melded them into the best-known orchestral unit in the history of jazz. Some members stayed with the orchestra for several decades. A master at writing miniatures for the three-minute 78 rpm recording format, Ellington wrote more than one thousand compositions; his extensive body of work is the largest recorded personal jazz legacy, with many of his pieces having become [[Standard (music)|standards]]. Ellington also recorded songs written by his bandsmen, for example [[Juan Tizol]]'s \"[[Caravan (1937 song)|Caravan]]\", and \"[[Perdido (song)|Perdido]]\", which brought a [[Spanish tinge]] to big band jazz. In the early 1940s, Ellington began a nearly thirty-year collaboration with composer-arranger-pianist [[Billy Strayhorn]], whom he called his writing and arranging companion.<ref>Hajdu, David (1996), ''Lush Life: A Biography of Billy Strayhorn'', New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, {{ISBN|978-0-86547-512-0}}, p. 170.</ref> With Strayhorn, he composed many extended compositions, or suites, as well as additional short pieces. Following an appearance at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]], in July 1956, Ellington and his orchestra enjoyed a major revival and embarked on world tours. Ellington recorded for most American record companies of his era, performed in several films, scored several, and composed a handful of stage musicals.\n\nEllington was noted for his inventive use of the orchestra, or big band, and for his eloquence and charisma. His reputation continued to rise after he died, and he was awarded a posthumous [[Pulitzer Prize Special Citations and Awards|Pulitzer Prize Special Award]] for music in 1999.<ref name=pulitzer/>\n\n==Early life and education==\nEllington was born on April 29, 1899, to James Edward Ellington and Daisy (Kennedy) Ellington in Washington, D.C. Both his parents were pianists. Daisy primarily played [[parlor song]]s, and James preferred operatic [[aria]]s. They lived with  Daisy's parents at 2129 Ida Place (now Ward Place), NW, in D.C.'s [[West End, Washington, D.C.|West End]] neighborhood.<ref name=\"Lawrence-1\">{{Harvnb|Lawrence|2001|p=1}}.</ref> Duke's father was born in [[Lincolnton, North Carolina]], on April 15, 1879, and moved to D.C. in 1886 with his parents.<ref name=\"Lawrence-2\">{{Harvnb|Lawrence|2001|p=2}}.</ref> Daisy Kennedy was born in Washington, D.C., on January 4, 1879, the daughter of a former American [[slave]]<!-- which parent?-->.<ref name=\"Lawrence-1\" /><ref>{{Harvnb|Hasse|1995|p=21}}.</ref> James Ellington made [[wikt:blueprint|blueprint]]s for the [[United States Navy]].\n\nWhen Edward Ellington was a child, his family showed racial pride and support in their home, as did many other families. African Americans in D.C. worked to protect their children from the era's [[Jim Crow]] laws.<ref>{{cite web |last1= Cohen|first1=Harvey|title=An excerpt from Duke Ellington's America |url= http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/112633.html|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=2010}}</ref>\n\nAt age seven, Ellington began taking piano lessons from Marietta Clinkscales. Daisy surrounded her son with dignified women to reinforce his manners and teach him elegance. His childhood friends noticed that his casual, offhand manner and dapper dress gave him the bearing of a young nobleman,<ref name= \"Terkel\">{{Harvnb|Terkel|2002}}.</ref> so they began calling him \"Duke\". Ellington credited his friend Edgar McEntree for the nickname. \"I think he felt that in order for me to be eligible for his constant companionship, I should have a title. So he called me Duke.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Ellington|1976|p=20}}.</ref>\n\nThough Ellington took piano lessons, he was more interested in baseball. \"[[Teddy Roosevelt|President Roosevelt (Teddy)]] would come by on his horse sometimes, and stop and watch us play\", he recalled.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ellington|1976|p=10}}.</ref> Ellington went to [[Armstrong High School (Washington, D.C.)|Armstrong Technical High School]] in Washington, D.C. His first job was selling peanuts at [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]] baseball games.\n\nEllington started sneaking into Frank Holiday's Poolroom at age fourteen. Hearing the music of the poolroom pianists ignited Ellington's love for the instrument, and he began to take his piano studies seriously. Among the many piano players he listened to were Doc Perry, Lester Dishman, Louis Brown, [[Turner Layton]], Gertie Wells, Clarence Bowser, Sticky Mack, Blind Johnny, [[Cliff Jackson (musician)|Cliff Jackson]], [[Claude Hopkins]], Phil Wurd, Caroline Thornton, [[Luckey Roberts]], [[Eubie Blake]], Joe Rochester, and Harvey Brooks.<ref name=\"Music on My Mind\">{{cite book |last=Smith|first=Willie the Lion| title= Music on My Mind: The Memoirs of an American Pianist, Foreword by Duke Ellington|year=1964|pages=ix|publisher=Doubleday & Company Inc |location=New York City|isbn=}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1914, while working as a [[soda jerk]] at the Poodle Dog Caf\u00e9, Ellington wrote his first composition, \"Soda Fountain [[ragtime|Rag]]\" (also known as the \"Poodle Dog Rag\"). He created the piece by ear, as he had not yet learned to read and write music. \"I would play the 'Soda Fountain Rag' as a [[one-step]], [[two-step (dance move)|two-step]], [[waltz]], [[tango]], and [[fox trot]]\", Ellington recalled. \"Listeners never knew it was the same piece.

Ellington was also inspired by his first encounters with [[Stride (music)|stride pianists]] [[James P. Johnson]] and Luckey Roberts. Later in New York he took advice from [[Will Marion Cook]], [[Fats Waller]], and [[Sidney Bechet]]. Ellington started to play gigs in caf\u00e9s and clubs in and around Washington, D.C. His attachment to music was so strong that in 1916 he turned down an art scholarship to the [[Pratt Institute]] in Brooklyn. Three months before graduating he dropped out of Armstrong Manual Training School, where he was studying commercial art.<ref name= \"simmonds\">{{cite news |url= http://www.lasentinel.net/Duke-Ellington.html| title=Duke Ellington |last= Simmonds |first=Yussuf|date=September 11, 2008 |work=[[Los Angeles Sentinel]] |accessdate= July 14, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early career===\nWorking as a freelance sign-painter from 1917, Ellington began assembling groups to play for dances. In 1919 he met drummer [[Sonny Greer]] from New Jersey, who encouraged Ellington's ambition to become a professional musician. Ellington built his music business through his day job: when a customer asked him to make a sign for a dance or party, he would ask if they had musical entertainment; if not, Ellington would offer to play for the occasion. He also had a messenger job with the U.S. Navy and State departments, where he made a wide range of contacts.\n\nEllington moved out of his parents' home and bought his own as he became a successful pianist. At first, he played in other ensembles, and in late 1917 formed his first group, \"The Duke's Serenaders\" (\"Colored Syncopators\", his telephone directory advertising proclaimed).<ref name= \"simmonds\"/> He was also the group's booking agent. His first play date was at the True Reformer's Hall, where he took home 75 cents.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hasse|1993|p=45}}.</ref>\n\nEllington played throughout the D.C. area and into [[Virginia]] for private society balls and embassy parties. The band included childhood friend [[Otto Hardwick]], who began playing the string bass, then moved to C-melody sax and finally settled on alto saxophone; [[Arthur Whetsol]] on trumpet; [[Elmer Snowden]] on banjo; and Sonny Greer on drums. The band thrived, performing for both African-American and white audiences, a rarity in the [[Racial segregation|segregated]] society of the day.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Cohen| first= Harvey G.|date=Autumn 2004 |title=The Marketing of Duke Ellington: Setting the Strategy for an African American Maestro |journal=The Journal of African American History |volume= 89|issue=4|pages=291\u2013315 |jstor=4134056|doi=10.2307/4134056}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Duke Ellington St. Louis Toodle-Oo.jpg|thumb|British pressing of \"East St. Louis Toodle-Oo\" (1927)]]\n\nWhen his drummer Sonny Greer was invited to join the [[Wilber Sweatman]] Orchestra in New York City, Ellington left his successful career in D.C. and moved to [[Harlem]], ultimately becoming part of the [[Harlem Renaissance]]. New dance crazes such as the [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]] emerged in Harlem, as well as African-American [[musical theater]], including [[Eubie Blake]]'s ''[[Shuffle Along]]''. After the young musicians left the Sweatman Orchestra to strike out on their own, they found an emerging jazz scene that was highly competitive with difficult inroad. They [[pool hustling|hustled pool]] by day and played whatever gigs they could find. The young band met stride pianist [[Willie \"The Lion\" Smith]], who introduced them to the scene and gave them some money. They played at [[Rent party|rent-house parties]] for income. After a few months, the young musicians returned to Washington, D.C., feeling discouraged.\n\nIn June 1923, a gig in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]],  another at the prestigious Exclusive Club in Harlem. This was followed in September 1923 by a move to the Hollywood Club (at 49th and Broadway) and a four-year engagement, which gave Ellington a solid artistic base. He was known to play the [[bugle]] at the end of each performance. The group was initially called Elmer Snowden and his Black Sox Orchestra and had seven members, including trumpeter [[James \"Bubber\" Miley]]. They renamed themselves The Washingtonians. Snowden left the group in early 1924 and Ellington took over as bandleader. After a fire, the club was re-opened as the Club Kentucky (often referred to as the Kentucky Club).\n\nEllington then made eight records in 1924, receiving composing credit on three including \"Choo Choo\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hasse|1993|p= 79}}.</ref> In 1925, Ellington contributed four songs to ''[[Chocolate Kiddies]]'' starring Lottie Gee and [[Adelaide Hall]],<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.myspace.com/adelaidehall/photos/albums/chocolate-kiddies-european-tour-1925/2789756 |title= Adelaide Hall &#124; CHOCOLATE KIDDIES EUROPEAN TOUR 1925 Photo Album |via= Myspace.com |accessdate= February 2, 2013}}</ref> an all-African-American revue which introduced European audiences to African-American styles and performers. Duke Ellington and his Kentucky Club Orchestra grew to a group of ten players; they developed their own sound by displaying the non-traditional expression of Ellington's arrangements, the street rhythms of Harlem, and the exotic-sounding trombone growls and wah-wahs, high-squealing trumpets, and saxophone blues licks of the band members. For a short time, soprano saxophonist [[Sidney Bechet]] played with them, imparting his propulsive [[Swing (jazz performance style)|swing]] and superior musicianship to the young band members.\n\n===Cotton Club engagement===\nIn October 1926, Ellington made an agreement with agent-publisher [[Irving Mills]],<ref>Gary Giddins ''Visions of Jazz: The First Century'', New York & Oxford, 1998, pp. 112\u201313.</ref> giving Mills a 45% interest in Ellington's future.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hasse|1993|p=90}}.</ref> Mills had an eye for new talent and published compositions by [[Hoagy Carmichael]], [[Dorothy Fields]], and [[Harold Arlen]] early in their careers. After recording a handful of acoustic titles during 1924\u201326, Ellington's signing with Mills allowed him to record prolifically, although sometimes he recorded different versions of the same tune. Mills often took a co-composer credit. From the beginning of their relationship, Mills arranged recording sessions on nearly every label including [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]], [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]], [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], [[Okeh Records|OKeh]], [[Pathe Records|Path\u00ea]] (and its Perfect label), the ARC/Plaza group of labels (Oriole, Domino, Jewel, Banner) and their dime-store labels (Cameo, Lincoln, Romeo), Hit of the Week, and Columbia's cheaper labels (Harmony, Diva, Velvet Tone, Clarion) labels which gave Ellington popular recognition. On OKeh, his records were usually issued as The Harlem Footwarmers, while the Brunswick's were usually issued as The Jungle Band. Whoopee Makers and the Ten Black Berries were other pseudonyms.\n\nIn September 1927, [[King Oliver]] turned down a regular booking for his group as the house band at Harlem's [[Cotton Club]];<ref>A.

The musical numbers were composed by Jimmy McHugh and the lyrics by Dorothy Fields (later Harold Arlen and [[Ted Koehler]]), with some Ellington originals mixed in. (Here he moved in with a dancer, his second wife [[Mildred Dixon]]).

An alcoholic, Miley had to leave the band before they gained wider fame. He died in 1932 at the age of 29, but he was an important influence on [[Cootie Williams]], who replaced him.\n\nIn 1929, the Cotton Club Orchestra appeared on stage for several months in [[Florenz Ziegfeld]]'s Show Girl, along with vaudeville stars [[Jimmy Durante]], [[Eddie Foy, Jr.]], [[Ruby Keeler]], and with music and lyrics by [[George Gershwin]] and [[Gus Kahn]]. [[Will Vodery]], Ziegfeld's musical supervisor, recommended Ellington for the show, and, according to John Hasse's ''Beyond Category: The Life and Genius of Duke Ellington'', \"Perhaps during the run of Show Girl, Ellington received what he later termed 'valuable lessons in orchestration\u2019 from Will Vodery.\u201d In his 1946 biography, ''Duke Ellington'', [[Barry Ulanov]] wrote:\n\n{{quote|From Vodery, as he (Ellington) says himself, he drew his [[chromatic scale|chromatic]] convictions, his uses of the tones ordinarily extraneous to the [[diatonic scale]], with the consequent alteration of the harmonic character of his music, its broadening, The deepening of his resources.

Actually his serious appreciation of those and other modern composers, came after his meeting with Vodery.<ref>Ulanov, Barry.

''Duke Ellington: Day by Day and Film by Film'', 1992. {{ISBN|87-88043-34-7}}</ref> in which he played the hero \"Duke\". He also appeared in the [[Amos 'n' Andy]] film ''[[Check and Double Check]]'', released in 1930. That year, Ellington and his Orchestra connected with a whole different audience in a concert with [[Maurice Chevalier]] and they also performed at the [[Roseland Ballroom]], \"America's foremost ballroom\". Australian-born composer [[Percy Grainger]] was an early admirer and supporter. He wrote \"The three greatest composers who ever lived are [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], [[Frederick Delius|Delius]] and Duke Ellington. Unfortunately Bach is dead, Delius is very ill but we are happy to have with us today The Duke\".<ref>John Bird, ''Percy Grainger''.</ref> Ellington's first period at the Cotton Club concluded in 1931.\n\n===The early 1930s===\nEllington led the orchestra by conducting from the keyboard using piano cues and visual gestures; very rarely did he conduct using a baton. By 1932 his orchestra consisted of six brass instruments, four reeds, and a four-man rhythm section.<ref name=\"Hodeir\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/08731|title=Ellington, Duke|last=Hodeir|first=Andr\u00e9|date=|website=Oxford Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|access-date=September 15, 2016}}</ref> As a bandleader, Ellington was not a strict disciplinarian; he maintained control of his orchestra with a combination of charm, humor, flattery and astute psychology. A complex, private person, he revealed his feelings to only his closest intimates and effectively used his public persona to deflect attention away from himself.\n\nEllington signed exclusively to Brunswick in 1932 and stayed with them through late 1936 (albeit with a short-lived 1933\u201334 switch to Victor when Irving Mills temporarily moved him and his other acts from Brunswick).\n\nAs the Depression worsened, the recording industry was in crisis, dropping over 90% of its artists by 1933.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hasse|1993|p=166}}.</ref> [[Ivie Anderson]] was hired as the Ellington Orchestra's featured vocalist in 1931. She is the vocalist on \"[[It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)]]\" (1932) among other recordings. Sonny Greer had been providing occasional vocals and continued to do in a cross-talk feature with Anderson. Radio exposure helped maintain Ellington's public profile as his orchestra began to tour. The other records of this era include: \"[[Mood Indigo]]\" (1930), \"[[Sophisticated Lady]]\" (1933), \"[[(In My) Solitude|Solitude]]\" (1934), and \"[[In a Sentimental Mood]]\" (1935)\n\nWhile the band's United States audience remained mainly African-American in this period, the Ellington orchestra had a significant following overseas, exemplified by the success of their trip to England and Scotland in 1933 and their 1934 visit to the European mainland. The British visit saw Ellington win praise from members of the serious music community, including composer [[Constant Lambert]], which gave a boost to Ellington's interest in composing longer works.\n\nThose longer pieces had already begun to appear. He had composed and recorded \"Creole Rhapsody\" as early as 1931 (issued as both sides of a 12\" record for Victor and both sides of a 10\" record for Brunswick), and a tribute to his mother, \"Reminiscing in Tempo\", took four 10\" record sides to record in 1935 after her death in that year. ''[[Symphony in Black]]'' (also 1935), a short film, featured his extended piece 'A Rhapsody of Negro Life'. It introduced [[Billie Holiday]], and won an [[Academy Award]] as the best musical short subject.<ref>Schuller, 1989, p. 94.</ref> Ellington and his Orchestra also appeared in the features ''[[Murder at the Vanities]]'' and ''[[Belle of the Nineties]]'' (both 1934).\n\nFor agent Mills the attention was a publicity triumph, as Ellington was now internationally known. On the band's tour through the segregated South in 1934, they avoided some of the traveling difficulties of African-Americans by touring in private railcars. These provided easy accommodations, dining, and storage for equipment while avoiding the indignities of segregated facilities.\n\nCompetition was intensifying, though, as swing bands like [[Benny Goodman]]'s began to receive popular attention. Swing dancing became a youth phenomenon, particularly with white college audiences, and danceability drove record sales and bookings. [[Jukebox]]es proliferated nationwide, spreading the gospel of swing. Ellington's band could certainly swing, but their strengths were mood, nuance, and richness of composition, hence his statement \"jazz is music, swing is business\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hasse|1993|p=203}}.</ref>\n\n===The later 1930s===\nFrom 1936, Ellington began to make recordings with smaller groups (sextets, octets, and nonets) drawn from his then-15-man orchestra and he composed pieces intended to feature a specific instrumentalist, as with \"Jeep's Blues\" for [[Johnny Hodges]], \"Yearning for Love\" for [[Lawrence Brown (jazz trombonist)|Lawrence Brown]], \"Trumpet in Spades\" for [[Rex Stewart]], \"[[Echoes of Harlem]]\" for [[Cootie Williams]] and \"Clarinet Lament\" for [[Barney Bigard]]. In 1937, Ellington returned to the Cotton Club, which had relocated to the mid-town [[Theater District]]. In the summer of that year, his father died, and due to many expenses, Ellington's finances were tight, although his situation improved the following year.\n\nAfter leaving agent Irving Mills, he signed on with the [[William Morris Agency]]. Mills though continued to record Ellington. After only a year, his Master and Variety labels (the small groups had recorded for the latter), collapsed in late 1937, Mills placed Ellington back on Brunswick and those small group units on Vocalion through to 1940. Well known sides continued to be recorded, \"[[Caravan (1937 song)|Caravan]]\" in 1937, and \"I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart\" the following year.\n\n[[File:Duke Ellington in ons land.ogv|thumb|Ellington in 1939]]\n[[Billy Strayhorn]], originally hired as a lyricist, began his association with Ellington in 1939.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billystrayhorn.com/biography.htm |title=WILLIAM THOMAS STRAYHORN |last=Stone |first=Sonjia (ed) |year=1983 |work=Billy Strayhorn Songs |publisher=University of North Carolina \u2013 Chapel Hill |accessdate=July 14, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622191412/http://www.billystrayhorn.com/biography.htm |archivedate=June 22, 2009 }}</ref> Nicknamed \"Swee' Pea\" for his mild manner, Strayhorn soon became a vital member of the Ellington organization.

The short-lived [[Jimmy Blanton]] transformed the use of double bass in jazz, allowing it to function as a solo/melodic instrument rather than a rhythm instrument alone. Terminal illness forced him to leave by late 1941 after only about two years. [[Ben Webster]], the Orchestra's first regular tenor saxophonist, whose main tenure with Ellington spanned 1939 to 1943, started a rivalry with Johnny Hodges as the Orchestra's foremost voice in the sax section.\n\nTrumpeter [[Ray Nance]] joined, replacing [[Cootie Williams]] who had defected to [[Benny Goodman]]. Additionally, Nance added violin to the instrumental colors Ellington had at his disposal. Recordings exist of Nance's first concert date on November 7, 1940, at [[Fargo, North Dakota]]. Privately made by [[Jack Towers]] and Dick Burris, these recordings were first legitimately issued in 1978 as ''[[Duke Ellington at Fargo, 1940 Live]]''; they are among the earliest of innumerable live performances which survive. Nance was also an occasional vocalist, although [[Herb Jeffries]] was the main male vocalist in this era (until 1943) while [[Al Hibbler]] (who replaced Jeffries in 1943) continued until 1951. Ivie Anderson left in 1942 for health reasons after eleven years: the longest term of any of Ellington's vocalists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musicians.allaboutjazz.com/musician.php?id=3424 |title=Musician Ivie Anderson (Vocal) @ All About Jazz |publisher=Musicians.allaboutjazz.com |accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOnce again recording for Victor (from 1940), with the small groups recording for their [[Bluebird Records|Bluebird]] label, three-minute masterpieces on [[Gramophone record|78 rpm record]] sides continued to flow from Ellington, Billy Strayhorn, Ellington's son [[Mercer Ellington]], and members of the Orchestra. \"[[Cotton Tail]]\", \"Main Stem\", \"[[Harlem Air Shaft]]\", \"Jack the Bear\", and dozens of others date from this period. Strayhorn's \"[[Take the \"A\" Train]]\" a hit in 1941, became the band's theme, replacing \"[[East St. Louis Toodle-Oo]]\".

In this, he was helped by Strayhorn, who had enjoyed a more thorough training in the forms associated with classical music than Ellington. The first of these, ''[[Black, Brown and Beige]]'' (1943), was dedicated to telling the story of African-Americans, and the place of slavery and the church in their history. ''Black, Brown and Beige'' debuted at [[Carnegie Hall]] on January 23, 1943, beginning an annual series of Ellington concerts at the venue over the next four years. While some jazz musicians had played at Carnegie Hall before, none had performed anything as elaborate as Ellington's work. Unfortunately, starting a regular pattern, Ellington's longer works were generally not well received.\n\nA partial exception was ''Jump for Joy'', a full-length musical based on themes of African-American identity, debuted on July 10, 1941, at the [[Mayan Theater]] in Los Angeles. Hollywood luminaries such as actors [[John Garfield]] and [[Mickey Rooney]] invested in the production, and [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Orson Welles]] offered to direct.<ref>Harvey G. Cohen, ''Duke Ellington's America'', Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 2010, p. 189.</ref> At one performance though, Garfield insisted Herb Jeffries, who was light-skinned, should wear make-up. Ellington objected in the interval, and compared Jeffries to [[Al Jolson]]. The change was reverted, and the singer later commented that the audience must have thought he was an entirely different character in the second half of the show.<ref>Cohen 2010, pp. 190\u201391.</ref>\n\nAlthough it had sold-out performances, and received positive reviews,<ref>Cohen 2010, pp. 191\u201392.</ref> it ran for only 122 performances until September 29, 1941, with a brief revival in November of that year.

His income as a songwriter ultimately subsidized it. Although he always spent lavishly and drew a respectable income from the Orchestra's operations, the band's income often just covered expenses.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hasse|1993|p=274}}.</ref>\n\n===Early post-war years===\nMusicians enlisting in the military and travel restrictions made touring difficult for the big bands and dancing became subject to a new tax, which continued for many years, affecting the choices of club owners. By the time World War II ended, the focus of popular music was shifting towards singing crooners such as [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Jo Stafford]]. As the cost of hiring big bands had increased, club owners now found smaller jazz groups more cost-effective. Some of Ellington's new works, such as the wordless vocal feature \"Transblucency\" (1946) with [[Kay Davis]], was not going to have a similar reach as the newly emerging stars. \n[[File:Jazz musician Duke Ellington.JPEG|thumb|Ellington poses with his piano at the KFG Radio Studio November 3, 1954.]]\n\nEllington continued on his own course through these tectonic shifts. While [[Count Basie]] was forced to disband his whole ensemble and work as an octet for a time, Ellington was able to tour most of Western Europe between April 6 and June 30, 1950, with the orchestra playing 74 dates over 77 days.<ref name=\"Lawrence291\">Lawrence, 2001, p. 291.</ref> During the tour, according to Sonny Greer, the newer works were not performed, though Ellington's extended composition, ''[[Harlem (Ellington)|Harlem]]'' (1950) was in the process of being completed at this time. Ellington later presented its score to music-loving President [[Harry Truman]]. Also during his time in Europe, Ellington would compose the music for a stage production by [[Orson Welles]].

Drummer [[Louie Bellson]] replaced Greer, and his \"Skin Deep\" was a hit for Ellington.

[[Andr\u00e9 Previn]] said in 1952: \"You know, [[Stan Kenton]] can stand in front of a thousand fiddles and a thousand brass and make a dramatic gesture and every studio arranger can nod his head and say, ''Oh, yes, that's done like this.'' But Duke merely lifts his finger, three horns make a sound, and I don\u2019t know what it is!\"<ref>[[Ralph J.

The feature \"[[Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue]]\" comprised two tunes that had been in the band's book since 1937 but largely forgotten until Ellington, who had abruptly ended the band's scheduled set because of the late arrival of four key players, called the two tunes as the time was approaching midnight. Announcing that the two pieces would be separated by an interlude played by tenor saxophonist [[Paul Gonsalves]], Ellington proceeded to lead the band through the two pieces, with Gonsalves' 27-chorus marathon solo whipping the crowd into a frenzy, leading the Maestro to play way beyond the curfew time despite urgent pleas from festival organizer [[George Wein]] to bring the program to an end.\n\nThe concert made international headlines, led to one of only five ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover stories dedicated to a jazz musician,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19560820,00.html |title=Jazzman Duke Ellington|work=TIME |date=August 20, 1956 |accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref> and resulted in an album produced by [[George Avakian]] that would become the best-selling LP of Ellington's career.<ref name=\"Sohmer\">Jack Sohmer [http://jazztimes.com/articles/10496-ellington-at-newport-1956-complete-duke-ellington \"Duke Ellington: ''Ellington at Newport 1956'' (Complete)\"] ''JazzTimes'', October 1999.</ref> Much of the music on the vinyl LP was, in effect, simulated, with only about 40% actually from the concert itself. According to Avakian, Ellington was dissatisfied with aspects of the performance and felt the musicians had been under rehearsed.<ref name=\"Sohmer\"/> The band assembled the next day to re-record several of the numbers with the addition of artificial crowd noise, none of which was disclosed to purchasers of the album. Not until 1999 was the concert recording properly released for the first time. The revived attention brought about by the Newport appearance should not have surprised anyone, Johnny Hodges had returned the previous year, and Ellington's collaboration with Strayhorn had been renewed around the same time, under terms more amenable to the younger man.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe original ''[[Ellington at Newport]]'' album was the first release in a new recording contract with [[Columbia Records]] which yielded several years of recording stability, mainly under producer [[Irving Townsend]], who coaxed both commercial and artistic productions from Ellington.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wein|first=George|title=Myself Among Others: A Life in Music|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2003}}</ref>\n\nIn 1957, [[CBS]] (Columbia Records' parent corporation) aired a live television production of ''[[A Drum Is a Woman]]'', an allegorical suite which received mixed reviews. His hope that television would provide a significant new outlet for his type of jazz was not fulfilled. Tastes and trends had moved on without him. Festival appearances at the new [[Monterey Jazz Festival]] and elsewhere provided venues for live exposure, and a European tour in 1958 was well received. ''[[Such Sweet Thunder]]'' (1957), based on [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] plays and characters, and ''[[The Ellington Suites|The Queen's Suite]]'' (1958), dedicated to Britain's [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], were products of the renewed impetus which the Newport appearance helped to create, although the latter work was not commercially issued at the time. The late 1950s also saw [[Ella Fitzgerald]] record her ''[[Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Duke Ellington Songbook|Duke Ellington Songbook]]'' (Verve) with Ellington and his orchestra\u2014a recognition that Ellington's songs had now become part of the cultural canon known as the '[[Great American Songbook]]'.\n\n[[File:James Stewart-Duke Ellington in Anatomy of a Murder trailer.jpg|thumb|[[Jimmy Stewart]] and Ellington in ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]''.]]\nAround this time Ellington and Strayhorn began to work on film soundtrack [[Film score|scoring]]. The first of these was ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]'' (1959),<ref name=\"Hodeir\"/> a courtroom drama directed by [[Otto Preminger]] and featuring [[James Stewart]], in which Ellington appeared fronting a roadhouse combo. This was followed by ''[[Paris Blues]]'' (1961), which featured [[Paul Newman]] and [[Sidney Poitier]] as jazz musicians. In 2009 ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' music critic Mark Stryker wrote that Ellington and Strayhorn's work in ''Anatomy of a Murder'' , is \"indispensable, [although] . . . too sketchy to rank in the top echelon among Ellington-Strayhorn masterpiece suites like ''[[Such Sweet Thunder]]'' and ''[[The Far East Suite]]'', but its most inspired moments are their equal.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=200990120016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212210625/http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=200990120016|archivedate=February 12, 2009|last=Stryker|first=Mark|title=Ellington's score still celebrated|date=January 20, 2009|work=[[Detroit Free Press]]|accessdate=February 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFilm historians have recognized the soundtrack \"as a landmark \u2013 the first significant Hollywood film music by African Americans comprising [[Diegetic#Film sound and music|non-diegetic]] music, that is, music whose source is not visible or implied by action in the film, like an on-screen band.\" The score avoided the cultural [[stereotypes]] which previously characterized jazz scores and rejected a strict adherence to visuals in ways that presaged the [[French New Wave|New Wave]] cinema of the '60s\".<ref>Mark Stryker, \"Ellington's score still celebrated\", ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'', January 20, 2009; Mervyn Cooke, ''History of Film Music'', 2008, Cambridge University Press.</ref> Ellington and Strayhorn, always looking for new musical territory, produced suites for [[John Steinbeck]]'s novel ''Sweet Thursday'', [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''Nutcracker Suite'' and [[Edvard Grieg]]'s ''Peer Gynt''.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Ellington embraced recording with artists who had been friendly rivals in the past, or were younger musicians who focused on later styles. The Ellington and [[Count Basie]] orchestras recorded together with the album ''[[First Time! The Count Meets the Duke]]'' (1961). During a period when Ellington was between recording contracts, he made records with [[Louis Armstrong]] ([[Roulette Records|Roulette]]), [[Coleman Hawkins]], [[John Coltrane]] (both for [[Impulse! Records|Impulse]]) and participated in a session with [[Charles Mingus]] and [[Max Roach]] which produced the ''[[Money Jungle]]'' ([[United Artists Records|United Artists]]) album. He signed to [[Frank Sinatra]]'s new [[Reprise Records|Reprise label]], but the association with the label was short-lived.\n\nMusicians who had previously worked with Ellington returned to the Orchestra as members: Lawrence Brown in 1960 and [[Cootie Williams]] in 1962.\n\n<blockquote>The writing and playing of music is a matter of intent.... You can't just throw a paint brush against the wall and call whatever happens art. My music fits the tonal personality of the player. I think too strongly in terms of altering my music to fit the performer to be impressed by accidental music. You can't take doodling seriously.<ref name=\"current\"/></blockquote>\n\nHe was now performing all over the world; a significant part of each year was spent on overseas tours. As a consequence, he formed new working relationships with artists from around the world, including the Swedish vocalist [[Alice Babs]], and the South African musicians [[Abdullah Ibrahim|Dollar Brand]] and [[Sathima Bea Benjamin]] (''A Morning in Paris'', 1963/1997).\n\nEllington wrote an original score for director [[Michael Langham]]'s production of Shakespeare's ''[[Timon of Athens]]'' at the [[Stratford Shakespeare Festival|Stratford Festival]] in Ontario, Canada which opened on July 29, 1963. Langham has used it for several subsequent productions, including a much later adaptation by [[Stanley Silverman]] which expands the score with some of Ellington's best-known works.\n\n===Last years===\n[[File:Richard Nixon and Duke Ellington 1969.jpg|thumb|Ellington receiving the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] from [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]], 1969.]]\n\nEllington was shortlisted for the [[Pulitzer Prize for Music]] in 1965 but no prize was ultimately awarded that year.<ref name=Giddins>[[Gary Giddins]], \"How Come Jazz Isn't Dead\", pp. 39\u201355 in {{Harvnb|Weisbard|2004|pp=41\u201342}}.

This concert was followed by two others of the same type in 1968 and 1973, known as the Second and Third Sacred Concerts. These generated controversy in what was already a tumultuous time in the United States.

Started in 1996 at [[Jazz at Lincoln Center]], the festival is named after Ellington because of the large focus that the festival places on his works.\n\n===Tributes===\nAfter Duke died, his son Mercer took over leadership of the orchestra, continuing until his own death in 1996. Like the [[Count Basie Orchestra]], this \"ghost band\" continued to release albums for many years. ''[[Digital Duke]]'', credited to The Duke Ellington Orchestra, won the 1988 [[Grammy Award for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album]]. Mercer Ellington had been handling all administrative aspects of his father's business for several decades. Mercer's children continue a connection with their grandfather's work.\n\n[[Gunther Schuller]] wrote in 1989:\n\n<blockquote>Ellington composed incessantly to the very last days of his life. Music was indeed his mistress; it was his total life and his commitment to it was incomparable and unalterable. In jazz he was a giant among giants. And in twentieth century music, he may yet one day be recognized as one of the half-dozen greatest masters of our time.<ref>Schuller, Gunther, ''The Swing Era'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, {{ISBN|0-19-504312-X}}, p. 157.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Martin Williams (writer)|Martin Williams]] said: \"Duke Ellington lived long enough to hear himself named among our best composers. And since his death in 1974, it has become not at all uncommon to see him named, along with [[Charles Ives]], as the greatest composer we have produced, regardless of category.\"<ref>Martin Williams, liner notes, ''Duke Ellington's Symphony in Black'', The Smithsonian Jazz Repertory Ensemble conducted by [[Gunther Schuller]], The [[Smithsonian]] Collections recording, 1980.</ref>\n\nIn the opinion of Bob Blumenthal of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' in 1999: \"[i]n the century since his birth, there has been no greater composer, American or otherwise, than Edward Kennedy Ellington.\"<ref>''Boston Globe'', April 25, 1999.</ref>\n\nIn 2002, scholar [[Molefi Kete Asante]] listed Duke Ellington on his list of [[100 Greatest African Americans]].<ref>Asante, Molefi Kete (2002).

The album ''[[The Real Ambassadors]]'' has a vocal version of this piece, \"You Swing Baby (The Duke)\", with lyrics by Iola Brubeck, Dave Brubeck's wife. It is performed as a duet between [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Carmen McRae]]. It is also dedicated to Duke Ellington.\n*[[Miles Davis]] created his half-hour [[dirge]] \"He Loved Him Madly\" (on ''[[Get Up with It]]'') as a tribute to Ellington one month after his death.\n*[[Charles Mingus]], who had been fired by Ellington decades earlier, wrote the elegy \"Duke Ellington's Sound Of Love\" in 1974, a few months after Ellington's death.\n*[[Stevie Wonder]] wrote the song \"[[Sir Duke]]\" as a tribute to Ellington which appeared on his album ''[[Songs in the Key of Life]]'' released in 1976.\n\nThere are hundreds of albums dedicated to the music of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn by artists famous and obscure. ''[[Sophisticated Ladies]]'', an award-winning 1981 musical revue, incorporated many tunes from Ellington's repertoire. A second Broadway musical interpolating Ellington's music, ''[[Play On (musical)|Play On!]]'', debuted in 1997.\n\n===Loss of material===\nOn June 25, 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Duke Ellington among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name=\"Rosen2\">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=June 28, 2019 |date=June 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Duke Ellington discography}}\n\n==Awards and honors==\n*1960, [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], contribution to recording industry\n*1966, [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].<ref name=\"pulitzer\"/> \n*1969, the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the highest civilian award in the US<ref name=\"pulitzer\"/>\n*1971, an Honorary PhD from the [[Berklee College of Music]]<ref name=\"pulitzer\"/>\n*1973, the [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur|Legion of Honor]] by France, its highest civilian honors.<ref name=\"pulitzer\"/>\n*1999, posthumous Special [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his lifetime contributions to music and culture\n\n===Grammy Awards===\nEllington earned 14 Grammy awards from 1959 to 2000, three of which were posthumous and a total of 24 nominations\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | '''Duke Ellington [[Grammy Award]] History'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/factsheets/awardsdb/env-awards-db-search,0,7169155.htmlstory?searchtype=all&query=Duke+Ellington&x=8&y=6 |title=Entertainment Awards Database |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GRAMMYs\"/>\n|-\n!
