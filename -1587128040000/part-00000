Previously this action was permitted as long as the leaper or hurdler did not land on other players.\n* Include in the definition of a \"defenseless player\" receivers tracking the quarterback or looking back for the ball, including inside the legal contact (5 yards from the line of scrimmage) zone.\n* Egregious hits to the head (similar to the \"targeting\" rule in NCAA football) will cause the player to risk immediate disqualification.\n* The replay control center will make the final ruling on reviewed plays instead of the game referee, although the referee can still provide input on reviewable plays.\n* The sideline replay monitor (the \"hood\") will be eliminated and replaced with a tablet on the field for the referee to review with the replay control center.\n* [[Crackback]] blocks are now prohibited by a backfield player in motion, even if he is not more than two yards outside the [[tackle box (American football)|tackle box]] when the ball is snapped.\n* Make permanent the rule that players who commit two certain types of unsportsmanlike conduct penalties (throwing punches/forearms/kicking, even if they do not connect, directing abusive, threatening, or insulting language toward opponents, teammates, game officials or league officials, and using baiting or taunting acts or words that may engender ill will between teams) in the same game risk automatic disqualification.\n* Extend for a second season the change in the touchback spot after a kickoff or safety free kick to the 25-yard line.\n* Make illegal actions that would conserve time penalized by the option for a 10-second runoff inside of the two-minute warning of each half or overtime (previously this only applied in the final minute of each half or overtime).\n* If a team commits multiple fouls on the same down with the intent of manipulating the game clock, the team will be penalized 15 yards for unsportsmanlike conduct and the game clock will be reset. This change was made in response to both the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and the [[Baltimore Ravens]] employing this strategy by intentionally holding the defensive players to allow the game clock to run down or run out (in the case of the Ravens' game vs. the [[Cincinnati Bengals]]) during the previous season. A team may NOT be disqualified if it is their second unsportsmanlike conduct penalty against them.\n* In response to the move of [[Sarah Thomas (American football official)|Sarah Thomas]] from line judge to head linesman for the 2017 season, the NFL renamed the officiating position of the head linesman to \"down judge\".\n\nThe following rule changes were approved for the 2017 NFL season at the NFL Spring League meeting on May 23, 2017:<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Jeanna|title=NFL voted on rule changes for the 2017 season, and we graded each one|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2017/5/23/15681012/nfl-rule-changes-2017-grades-touchdown-celebrations-shorter-overtime|website=SBNation.com|access-date=May 23, 2017|date=May 23, 2017}}</ref>\n* Overtime has been shortened from 15 minutes to 10 minutes for preseason and regular season games.

One particular scenario the league sought to eliminate is the \"double-up,\" in which a network cuts to a commercial after a scoring play, then airs the kickoff, and again goes to commercial before play from scrimmage resumes. Under the proposal, the league will allow networks to cut to commercial during [[instant replay]] reviews, which it had not been allowed to do before. Commissioner Roger Goodell stated that the changes are being made in an attempt to consolidate downtime between the actual game play so that there are fewer and less noticeable interruptions; he does not expect the changes to have an appreciable impact on the real-time length of a game, which currently clocks in at slightly over three hours.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/03/22/roger-goodell-plans-to-speed-up-pace-nfl-games-2017/99491048/#|title=Exclusive: Roger Goodell says changes coming to quicken NFL games in 2017|work=USA Today|first=Tom|last=Pelissero|date=March 24, 2017|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe NFL has also, as a trial, lifted its ban on the broadcast of commercials for [[distilled spirits]] during its telecasts.

Previously this action was permitted as long as the leaper or hurdler did not land on other players.\n* Include in the definition of a \"defenseless player\" receivers tracking the quarterback or looking back for the ball, including inside the legal contact (5 yards from the line of scrimmage) zone.\n* Egregious hits to the head (similar to the \"targeting\" rule in NCAA football) will cause the player to risk immediate disqualification.\n* The replay control center will make the final ruling on reviewed plays instead of the game referee, although the referee can still provide input on reviewable plays.\n* The sideline replay monitor (the \"hood\") will be eliminated and replaced with a tablet on the field for the referee to review with the replay control center.\n* [[Crackback]] blocks are now prohibited by a backfield player in motion, even if he is not more than two yards outside the [[tackle box (American football)|tackle box]] when the ball is snapped.\n* Make permanent the rule that players who commit two certain types of unsportsmanlike conduct penalties (throwing punches/forearms/kicking, even if they do not connect, directing abusive, threatening, or insulting language toward opponents, teammates, game officials or league officials, and using baiting or taunting acts or words that may engender ill will between teams) in the same game risk automatic disqualification.\n* Extend for a second season the change in the touchback spot after a kickoff or safety free kick to the 25-yard line.\n* Make illegal actions that would conserve time penalized by the option for a 10-second runoff inside of the two-minute warning of each half or overtime (previously this only applied in the final minute of each half or overtime).\n* If a team commits multiple fouls on the same down with the intent of manipulating the game clock, the team will be penalized 15 yards for unsportsmanlike conduct and the game clock will be reset. This change was made in response to both the [[San Francisco 49ers]] and the [[Baltimore Ravens]] employing this strategy by intentionally holding the defensive players to allow the game clock to run down or run out (in the case of the Ravens' game vs. the [[Cincinnati Bengals]]) during the previous season. A team may NOT be disqualified if it is their second unsportsmanlike conduct penalty against them.\n* In response to the move of [[Sarah Thomas (American football official)|Sarah Thomas]] from line judge to head linesman for the 2017 season, the NFL renamed the officiating position of the head linesman to \"down judge\".\n\nThe following rule changes were approved for the 2017 NFL season at the NFL Spring League meeting on May 23, 2017:<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Jeanna|title=NFL voted on rule changes for the 2017 season, and we graded each one|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2017/5/23/15681012/nfl-rule-changes-2017-grades-touchdown-celebrations-shorter-overtime|website=SBNation.com|access-date=May 23, 2017|date=May 23, 2017}}</ref>\n* Overtime has been shortened from 15 minutes to 10 minutes for preseason and regular season games.

One particular scenario the league sought to eliminate is the \"double-up,\" in which a network cuts to a commercial after a scoring play, then airs the kickoff, and again goes to commercial before play from scrimmage resumes. Under the proposal, the league will allow networks to cut to commercial during [[instant replay]] reviews, which it had not been allowed to do before. Commissioner Roger Goodell stated that the changes are being made in an attempt to consolidate downtime between the actual game play so that there are fewer and less noticeable interruptions; he does not expect the changes to have an appreciable impact on the real-time length of a game, which currently clocks in at slightly over three hours.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/03/22/roger-goodell-plans-to-speed-up-pace-nfl-games-2017/99491048/#|title=Exclusive: Roger Goodell says changes coming to quicken NFL games in 2017|work=USA Today|first=Tom|last=Pelissero|date=March 24, 2017|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe NFL has also, as a trial, lifted its ban on the broadcast of commercials for [[distilled spirits]] during its telecasts. However, they are subject to restrictions; a maximum of four liquor ads may be broadcast per-game, along with two per-pregame and postgame show. These ads may not contain football-related themes or target underage viewers, and must contain a \"prominent social responsibility message\".<ref name=\"br-liqour\">{{cite web|title=NFL to Allow Liquor Advertising During Games Next Season|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2713387-nfl-to-allow-liquor-advertising-during-games-next-season|website=Bleacher Report|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"wsj-liquorads\">{{cite web|title=NFL Adds Liquor to Menu of Advertisers|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/nfl-adds-liquor-to-menu-of-advertisers-1496441710|website=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}{{subscription required}}</ref>\n\n===Personnel changes===\n[[Tony Romo]], who announced his retirement as a player on April 4, 2017, joined CBS, where he replaced [[Phil Simms]] as lead color commentator.

Devraj, the son of a former crime boss, declares himself the next leader of the crime syndicate; he is supported by some members but opposed by the rest. Ibrahim reveals to Kalki, legal advisor of the Roy group that Roy's family has been killed and he has been raising a secret for 25 years when he was alive. The secret was that he had a son who survived named Vishwank. Vishwank foils Devraj's plans by succeeding his father as the next boss. Vishwank is also determined to unmask his father's murderer and sets out to lead Waaji City.\n\nRoy had to set up a [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] plant in India but was opposed by the external affairs minister of India. However, he manages to get the permission signature on a letter from him. Then, the gangsters' money is on a ship that gets destroyed in a bomb blast.\n\nThe story then turns to India, where a mastermind steals about two trillion [[Indian rupee|rupees]] with ease. A nationwide manhunt ensues to find the culprit. Undercover agent Ashok Chakravarthy is assigned as head of the manhunt task-force. Although he initially refuses, he relents after finding out that Amritha Nair, a woman whom he is [[infatuation|infatuated]] with, will also be on the task-force. The task-force uncovers the whereabouts of a thief named Jai and traps him during his next robbery, after Amritha and Ashok fall in love. They let Jai take a black box that Vishwank introduces to Kalki and others and that can open his locker containing treasures at a secure building in Waaji City.\n\nLater, there is a chase in which Amritha, Ashok, and David (a hacker) confront Jai at a bridge. It is then revealed that the thief was real Ashok and the officer who was with them is  Saaho, who is the actual person committing the robberies and Jai was actually the undercover police officer Ashok Chakravarthy. As Saaho escapes with his partner David, Amritha, along with the entire Indian police department, is stunned.\n\nAfterward, it is revealed that Devraj killed Roy in order to gain power and that the money of the gangsters is with him and that he was the one who planned the blast. Amritha then tracks Saaho and pretends that she is still in love with him but is actually helping Ashok. Meanwhile, Amritha actually falls for Saaho and betrays Ashok. Saaho takes Amritha to different places, which are nothing but the drawings in Amrita's book which Saaho saw when they were in [[Mumbai]]. Even after this, Amrita feels that they are opposite and can never be one but Saaho clears that and when he tries to kiss her, she is shot and taken away by Devraj. Saaho is forced by Devraj to give him the black box but later betrays him as he strikes a deal and gives the black box to Vishwank. Saaho also destroys Devraj's building and steals the money that he had with him. Amritha is then subsequently saved by Ibrahim, one of Vishwank's associates. Saaho is then chased by Ashok and the police, with Amritha in a helicopter with a sniper. As the sniper is shooting him, Amritha tries to save Saaho by distracting the sniper, but the sniper pushes her towards the very end of the helicopter. Saaho saves her with a [[jet pack]] but is later arrested by the police.\n\nKalki who was with Vishwank the whole time is revealed to be on Devraj's side. She goes to the vault and opens it with Vishwank's fingerprint which she had stolen it earlier. She accesses the vault with the black box and finds pictures of Roy and his son. She also finds a copy of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', thus revealing Roy's two most precious things in the vault, meanwhile Amritha locates and chases Alex, a man who ran away seeing her in a bar in [[Mumbai]]  and Ashok meets up with Vishwank.\n\nSaaho is taken to Karana village by Shinde, where he battles with Devraj's goons and defeats them easily. Devraj arrives, and Saaho reveals to him that he is Siddhant Nandan Saaho, the real son of Roy. He also reveals to Devraj that he did this to avenge his father's death. Vishwank and Alex also reveal this to Ashok and Amritha, respectively. Kalki also witnesses a portrait of Roy and Saaho inside the vault, thereby shocking all of them. After all of this, Saaho kills Devraj, thereby avenging Roy's death.\n\nIbrahim reveals that Vishwank was not Roy's son, but was his own son and his real name was Iqbal. He then tells them that Iqbal was there to save Roy's throne. He also reveals Saaho's real identity to the gang members, and Saaho becomes the next king of the underworld. Months later, Saaho locates Amritha in [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]] and confesses his love for her; they share a kiss and hug each other. In a distance, a sniper aims at Saaho as he opens his eye to the danger, hinting at a potential sequel for the movie.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Prabhas]] as Ashok Chakravarthy/Siddhant Nandan Saaho\n* [[Shraddha Kapoor]] as Amritha Nair\n* [[Jackie Shroff]] as Narantak Roy \n* [[Neil Nitin Mukesh]] as Jai/Ashok Chakravarthy \n* [[Arun Vijay]] as Vishwank Roy/Iqbal\n* [[Chunky Pandey]] as Devraj \n* [[Vennela Kishore]] as Goswami\n* [[Murali Sharma]] as David\n* [[Lal (actor)|Lal]] as Ibrahim\n* [[Supreeth]] as Alex Fernandes\n* [[Mandira Bedi]] as Kalki\n* [[Prakash Belawadi]] as Shinde\n* [[Evelyn Sharma]] as Jennifer\n* [[Mahesh Manjrekar]] as Prince \n* [[Tinnu Anand]] as Prithviraj \n* [[Ravi Varma (actor)|Ravi Varma]] as Ajay\n* [[Devan (actor)|Devan]] as IG\n* [[Sharath Lohitashwa]] as Mani\n* Sasha Chettri\n* Girish Garladinne\n* Damini Chopra<ref>{{cite news |title= Saaho actress Damini Chopra's gorgeous looks|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/gorgeous-alert-saaho-debutante-damini-chopra-is-a-dazzling-bombshell-on-instagram/photostory/68080477.cms|accessdate=20 February 2019 |work=Times of India |date=20 February 2019 |language=english}}</ref>\n* Kumar Raja Venati\n* Naveen Varma Ganapathiraju\n* [[Jacqueline Fernandez]] as an item number in the song \"Bad Boy\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Jacqueline and Prabhas sizzle in Saaho's Bad Boy|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/jacqueline-and-prabhas-sizzle-in-saahos-bad-boy/articleshow/70723531.cms|accessdate=19 August 2019 |work=Times of India |date=19 August 2019 |language=english}}</ref>\n* [[Tanikella Bharani]] as Indian external affairs minister Ramaswamy Allagadda (cameo)\n{{colend}}\n* [[Duvvasi Mohan]] as sub police\n\n==Production==\nThe film was produced on a budget of {{INR}}350 [[crore]].<ref name=\"Budget\"/> The film was shot in [[Austria]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Mumbai]], [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Dubai]], [[Romania]], and other parts of [[Europe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://e.telugurajyam.com/team-saaho-lands-in-austria-for-crucial-scenes/|title=Team Saaho lands in Austria for crucial scenes|date=17 June 2019|website=telugurajyam|language=en-US|access-date=23 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/regional-cinema/story/saaho-prabhas-and-shraddha-kapoor-chill-in-austria-after-shoot-see-viral-pics-1555557-2019-06-25|title=Saaho: Prabhas and Shraddha Kapoor chill in Austria after shoot.

Devraj, the son of a former crime boss, declares himself the next leader of the crime syndicate; he is supported by some members but opposed by the rest. Ibrahim reveals to Kalki, legal advisor of the Roy group that Roy's family has been killed and he has been raising a secret for 25 years when he was alive. The secret was that he had a son who survived named Vishwank. Vishwank foils Devraj's plans by succeeding his father as the next boss. Vishwank is also determined to unmask his father's murderer and sets out to lead Waaji City.\n\nRoy had to set up a [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] plant in India but was opposed by the external affairs minister of India. However, he manages to get the permission signature on a letter from him. Then, the gangsters' money is on a ship that gets destroyed in a bomb blast.\n\nThe story then turns to India, where a mastermind steals about two trillion [[Indian rupee|rupees]] with ease. A nationwide manhunt ensues to find the culprit. Undercover agent Ashok Chakravarthy is assigned as head of the manhunt task-force. Although he initially refuses, he relents after finding out that Amritha Nair, a woman whom he is [[infatuation|infatuated]] with, will also be on the task-force. The task-force uncovers the whereabouts of a thief named Jai and traps him during his next robbery, after Amritha and Ashok fall in love. They let Jai take a black box that Vishwank introduces to Kalki and others and that can open his locker containing treasures at a secure building in Waaji City.\n\nLater, there is a chase in which Amritha, Ashok, and David (a hacker) confront Jai at a bridge. It is then revealed that the thief was real Ashok and the officer who was with them is  Saaho, who is the actual person committing the robberies and Jai was actually the undercover police officer Ashok Chakravarthy. As Saaho escapes with his partner David, Amritha, along with the entire Indian police department, is stunned.\n\nAfterward, it is revealed that Devraj killed Roy in order to gain power and that the money of the gangsters is with him and that he was the one who planned the blast. Amritha then tracks Saaho and pretends that she is still in love with him but is actually helping Ashok. Meanwhile, Amritha actually falls for Saaho and betrays Ashok. Saaho takes Amritha to different places, which are nothing but the drawings in Amrita's book which Saaho saw when they were in [[Mumbai]]. Even after this, Amrita feels that they are opposite and can never be one but Saaho clears that and when he tries to kiss her, she is shot and taken away by Devraj. Saaho is forced by Devraj to give him the black box but later betrays him as he strikes a deal and gives the black box to Vishwank. Saaho also destroys Devraj's building and steals the money that he had with him. Amritha is then subsequently saved by Ibrahim, one of Vishwank's associates. Saaho is then chased by Ashok and the police, with Amritha in a helicopter with a sniper. As the sniper is shooting him, Amritha tries to save Saaho by distracting the sniper, but the sniper pushes her towards the very end of the helicopter. Saaho saves her with a [[jet pack]] but is later arrested by the police.\n\nKalki who was with Vishwank the whole time is revealed to be on Devraj's side. She goes to the vault and opens it with Vishwank's fingerprint which she had stolen it earlier. She accesses the vault with the black box and finds pictures of Roy and his son. She also finds a copy of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', thus revealing Roy's two most precious things in the vault, meanwhile Amritha locates and chases Alex, a man who ran away seeing her in a bar in [[Mumbai]]  and Ashok meets up with Vishwank.\n\nSaaho is taken to Karana village by Shinde, where he battles with Devraj's goons and defeats them easily. Devraj arrives, and Saaho reveals to him that he is Siddhant Nandan Saaho, the real son of Roy. He also reveals to Devraj that he did this to avenge his father's death. Vishwank and Alex also reveal this to Ashok and Amritha, respectively. Kalki also witnesses a portrait of Roy and Saaho inside the vault, thereby shocking all of them. After all of this, Saaho kills Devraj, thereby avenging Roy's death.\n\nIbrahim reveals that Vishwank was not Roy's son, but was his own son and his real name was Iqbal. He then tells them that Iqbal was there to save Roy's throne. He also reveals Saaho's real identity to the gang members, and Saaho becomes the next king of the underworld. Months later, Saaho locates Amritha in [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]] and confesses his love for her; they share a kiss and hug each other. In a distance, a sniper aims at Saaho as he opens his eye to the danger, hinting at a potential sequel for the movie.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Prabhas]] as Ashok Chakravarthy/Siddhant Nandan Saaho\n* [[Shraddha Kapoor]] as Amritha Nair\n* [[Jackie Shroff]] as Narantak Roy \n* [[Neil Nitin Mukesh]] as Jai/Ashok Chakravarthy \n* [[Arun Vijay]] as Vishwank Roy/Iqbal\n* [[Chunky Pandey]] as Devraj \n* [[Vennela Kishore]] as Goswami\n* [[Murali Sharma]] as David\n* [[Lal (actor)|Lal]] as Ibrahim\n* [[Supreeth]] as Alex Fernandes\n* [[Mandira Bedi]] as Kalki\n* [[Prakash Belawadi]] as Shinde\n* [[Evelyn Sharma]] as Jennifer\n* [[Mahesh Manjrekar]] as Prince \n* [[Tinnu Anand]] as Prithviraj \n* [[Ravi Varma (actor)|Ravi Varma]] as Ajay\n* [[Devan (actor)|Devan]] as IG\n* [[Sharath Lohitashwa]] as Mani\n* Sasha Chettri\n* Girish Garladinne\n* Damini Chopra<ref>{{cite news |title= Saaho actress Damini Chopra's gorgeous looks|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/telugu/movies/news/gorgeous-alert-saaho-debutante-damini-chopra-is-a-dazzling-bombshell-on-instagram/photostory/68080477.cms|accessdate=20 February 2019 |work=Times of India |date=20 February 2019 |language=english}}</ref>\n* Kumar Raja Venati\n* Naveen Varma Ganapathiraju\n* [[Jacqueline Fernandez]] as an item number in the song \"Bad Boy\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Jacqueline and Prabhas sizzle in Saaho's Bad Boy|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/jacqueline-and-prabhas-sizzle-in-saahos-bad-boy/articleshow/70723531.cms|accessdate=19 August 2019 |work=Times of India |date=19 August 2019 |language=english}}</ref>\n* [[Tanikella Bharani]] as Indian external affairs minister Ramaswamy Allagadda (cameo)\n{{colend}}\n* [[Duvvasi Mohan]] as sub police\n\n==Production==\nThe film was produced on a budget of {{INR}}350 [[crore]].<ref name=\"Budget\"/> The film was shot in [[Austria]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Mumbai]], [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Dubai]], [[Romania]], and other parts of [[Europe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://e.telugurajyam.com/team-saaho-lands-in-austria-for-crucial-scenes/|title=Team Saaho lands in Austria for crucial scenes|date=17 June 2019|website=telugurajyam|language=en-US|access-date=23 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/regional-cinema/story/saaho-prabhas-and-shraddha-kapoor-chill-in-austria-after-shoot-see-viral-pics-1555557-2019-06-25|title=Saaho: Prabhas and Shraddha Kapoor chill in Austria after shoot.
