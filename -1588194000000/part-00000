{"title_page": "Goblet word", "text_new": "{{Use Harvard referencing|date=April 2020}}\n'''''Zh\u012by\u00e1n''''' (\u536e\u8a00, literally \"goblet words\") is an ancient Chinese [[rhetorical device]], supposedly named in analogy with a type of ''zhi'' [[Chinese ritual bronzes#Wine vessels|wine vessel]] that tilts over when full and rights itself when empty. The [[Daoist]] classic ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' first recorded this term for a mystical [[Language ideology|linguistic ideology]], which is generally interpreted to mean fluid language that maintains its equilibrium through shifting meanings and viewpoints, thus enabling one to spontaneously go along with all sides of an argument.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe ''Zhuangzi'' text contains [[neologisms]] for three [[figure of speech|figures of speech]]: ''y\u00f9y\u00e1n'' (\u5bd3\u8a00, lit. \"lodged words\"), ''ch\u00f3ngy\u00e1n'' (\u91cd\u8a00, \"repeated words\") or ''zh\u00f2ngy\u00e1n'' (\u91cd\u8a00, \"weighted words\"), and ''zh\u012by\u00e1n'' (\u536e\u8a00, \"goblet words\")\u2014later referred to as the ''s\u0101ny\u00e1n'' (\u4e09\u8a00, \"three [kinds of] words\") (Guo and Zhang 2018). These terms [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] ''y\u00e1n'' ([[wikt:\u8a00|\u8a00]], \"speech, talk; sayings; words\") with ''y\u00f9'' ([[wikt:\u5bd3|\u5bd3]], \"lodge, reside; dwell, sojourn; entrust; imply, contain\"), ''ch\u00f3ng'' ([[wikt:\u91cd|\u91cd]], \"double, multiple; duplicate, repeat; accumulate\") or ''zh\u00f2ng'' (\u91cd, \"heavy; weight, weighty, important; serious\"), and ''zh\u012b'' ([[wikt:\u536e|\u536e]] or [[wikt:\u5df5|\u5df5]], \"ancient wine goblet\"). All three of these ancient Zhuangzian terms became part of modern [[Standard Chinese]] vocabulary; ''yuyan'' is a common word meaning \"fable; allegory; parable\", ''chongyan'' is a specialized linguistic term for \"[[reduplication]], reduplicated word/morpheme\", and ''zhiyan'' is a [[literary Chinese|literary]] reference to ''Zhuangzi'', sometimes used in self-deprecatory titles, such as Wang Shizhen's (\u738b\u4e16\u8c9e) 1558 ''Y\u00ecyuan zhiyan'' ([https://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hant/%E8%97%9D%E8%8B%91%E5%8D%AE%E8%A8%80 \u85dd\u82d1\u536e\u8a00], Goblet Words on Art and Literature).\n\nThe first [[Chinese dictionary]] of characters, [[Xu Shen]]'s c. 121 CE ''[[Shuowen jiezi]]'', provides a representative set of ancient [[Han dynasty]] \"wine vessel\" names. ''Zh\u012b'' (\u536e or \u5df5) is defined as \"a round vessel (\u571c\u5668), also called ''d\u00e0n'' ([[wikt:\u89db|\u89db]]), used to regulate drinking and eating (\u7bc0\u98f2\u98df)\", which is a classical allusion to the ''[[Yijing]]'' (27). ''D\u00e0n'' (\u89db) is in turn defined as a \"small ''zh\u00ec'' (\u5c0f\u89f6), and the ''sh\u0101ng'' ([[wikt:\u89f4|\u89f4]], \"wine-drinking cup\") definition says ''sh\u0101ng'' refers to a full ''zh\u00ec'' ([[wikt:\u89f6|\u89f6]]) and ''zh\u00ec'' to an empty one. The ''Shuowen'' defines ''zh\u00ec'' (\u89f6) as a \"ceremonial wine-drinking horn used in the countryside (\u9109\u98f2\u9152\u89d2)\", cites the ''[[Yili]]'' \"The host then sits, takes the goblet, and washes it. (\u4e00\u4eba\u6d17\u8209\u89f6)\" (tr. Steele 1917: 79), and notes that one ''zhi'' was a liquid measure equivalent to four ''sh\u0113ng'' ([[Chinese units of measurement#Volume|\u5347]], about half a gallon). ''Zhu\u01cen'' ([[wikt:\ud859\udcdd|\ud859\udcdd]]) is defined as a \"small ''zhi'' goblet\" (\u5c0f\u5df5), and ''shu\u00e0n'' ([[wikt:\ud846\udf50|\ud846\udf50]]) as a \"small ''zhi'' goblet with handles and a cover\" (\u5c0f\u5df5\u6709\u8033\u84cb\u8005).\n\nAnother Han scholar [[Ying Shao]] (140-206) said ''zh\u012b'' (\u536e) and ''zh\u00ec'' (\u89f6) refer to the same object, \"A regional drinking-vessel for ritual use; formerly made holding four ''sheng''; formerly the word ''zhi'' (\u536e ) was written ''zhi'' (\u89f6) or [also pronounced ''di''] ([[wikt:\u89dd|\u89dd]])\" (tr. Fried 2007: 154). Lin Shuen-fu disagrees with Ying and suggests ''zh\u012b'' (\u536e) and ''zh\u00ec'' (\u89f6) denote different sizes vessels of the same type and function, specifically the type of wine goblets that have a \"round, column-like body, a slightly flaring mouth, and a ring foot\" (1994: 62).\n\nThe historian [[Wang Guowei]] linguistically equated the ''zh\u012b'' (\u536e) goblet with four ancient wine vessels: ''zh\u00ec'' (\u89f6), ''d\u00e0n'' (\u89db), ''shu\u00e0n'' (\ud846\udf50), and ''zhu\u01cen'' (\ud859\udcdd) (1923, 6: 291-3). The former two are written with the standard \"[[Radical 148|horn radical]]\" ([[wikt:\u89d2|\u89d2]]; no. 148 in the [[Kangxi radical|''Kangxi'' radicals]]); and the latter two with the ancient \"goblet radical\" ([[wikt:\u536e|\u536e]]; no. 337 in the [[List of Shuowen Jiezi radicals|''Shuowen Jiezi'' radicals]]), a lexicographic category with only these two rare characters.\n\nThe Chinese [[Epigraphy|epigrapher]] Rong Geng (\u5bb9\u5e9a) archaeologically concluded that the original denotations of ''zh\u00ec'' or ''zh\u012b'' are uncertain (1941: 404). Within the [[Chinese ritual bronzes|Chinese ritual bronze]] terminology of [[Song dynasty]] (960-1127) [[Song dynasty#Archaeology|antiquarians]], ''zh\u00ec'' (\u89f6) was a common [[Western Zhou]] era (c. 1045-771 BCE) [[Chinese ritual bronzes#Wine vessels|wine vessel]] with a small, oval cross section, ring-feet, slender S-shaped profile, and often a cover; and ''zh\u012b'' (\u536e or \u5df5) was a rare [[Spring and Autumn period]] (771-476 BCE) wine drinking vessel with a squat oval cross-section, ring-feet, and annular handles.\n\n'''Chinese [[Chinese ritual bronzes#Wine vessels|ritual bronze wine vessels]] associated with ''zh\u012b'' (\u536e) goblets'''\n<gallery>\nFile:Chinese - Wine Vessel - Walters 542184.jpg|'''''Ju\u00e9''''' (\u7235) tripod wine flagon, [[Shang dynasty]], c. 12th century BCE\nFile:\u897f\u5468\u201c\u7236\u4e01\u201d\u6709\u76d6\u94dc\u89d21.jpg|'''''Ju\u00e9''''' (\u89d2) tripod wine flagon, [[Western Zhou]], c. 7th century BCE\nFile:Chinese - Wine beaker - Walters 541237.jpg|'''''G\u016b''''' (\u89da) tall wine beaker, Shang dynasty, c. 13th century BCE\nFile:Ritual Wine Vessel (Guang), 13th-11th century B.C.E.

Both passages give [[metadiscourse|metadiscursive]] analyses of the language used in ''Zhuangzi'', namely, the ''sanyan'' three [kinds of] words, ''y\u00f9y\u00e1n'' (\u5bd3\u8a00, \"metaphors\"), ''ch\u00f3ngy\u00e1n'' (\u91cd\u8a00, \"quotations\"), and ''zh\u012by\u00e1n'' (\u536e\u8a00, \"impromptu words\"). Note that unless otherwise identified, translations are by [[Victor H. Mair]] (1994).\n\n===Passages===\nChapter 27 ''Y\u00f9y\u00e1n'' (\u5bd3\u8a00, \"Metaphors\") mentions ''zh\u012by\u00e1n'' (\u536e\u8a00) three times in the phrase \"impromptu words pour forth every day and harmonize within the framework of nature\" (''Zh\u012by\u00e1n r\u00ecch\u016b h\u00e9 y\u01d0 ti\u0101nn\u00ed'' \u536e\u8a00\u65e5\u51fa \u548c\u4ee5\u5929\u502a) ), and these passages are described as \"the most difficult in the entire chapter\" (Lin 1994: 61). First, the lead (27/1) introduces this phrase, which two parallel passages repeat and describe how using impromptu goblet words can result in longevity. Second, the ''Zhuangzi'' (27/5) says, \"Consequently, there is effusive elaboration [''m\u00e0ny\u01cen'' ([[wikt:\u66fc\u884d|\u66fc\u884d]], \"spread out far and wide\")] so that they may live out their years\" (\u536e\u8a00\u65e5\u51fa \u548c\u4ee5\u5929\u502a \u56e0\u4ee5\u66fc\u884d \u6240\u4ee5\u7aae\u5e74). Third, the context (27/9) asks a ''f\u0113i'' ([[wikt:\u975e|\u975e]], \"not\") negative [[Conditional sentence|conditional]] question, \"If it were not for the impromptu words that pour forth every day and harmonize within the framework of nature, who could last long?\" (\u975e\u536e\u8a00\u65e5\u51fa \u548c\u4ee5\u5929\u502a \u5b70\u5f97\u5176\u4e45).\n<blockquote>Metaphors are effective nine times out of ten and quotations seven times out of ten, but impromptu words come forth every day and harmonize within the framework of nature [\u536e\u8a00\u65e5\u51fa \u548c\u4ee5\u5929\u502a]. \nMetaphors are effective nine times out of ten because they borrow externals to discuss something. A father does not act as a matchmaker for his son. It's better for someone who is not the father to praise the son than for the father himself to do so. Then it won't be his own fault, but somebody else's fault. If someone agrees with oneself, one responds favorably, but if someone does not agree with oneself, one opposes them. One considers to be right those who agree with oneself and considers to be wrong those who disagree with oneself\n\nQuotations are effective seven times out of ten because their purpose is to stop speech. They are from our elders, those who precede us in years. But those who fill up the years of their old age without grasping what is significant and what is rudimentary are not really our predecessors. If a man has not that whereby he precedes others, he lacks the way of humanity. If a man lacks the way of humanity, he may be called a stale person.\n\nImpromptu words pour forth every day and harmonize within the framework of nature [\u536e\u8a00\u65e5\u51fa \u548c\u4ee5\u5929\u502a]. Consequently, there is effusive elaboration so that they may live out their years [\u56e0\u4ee5\u66fc\u884d \u6240\u4ee5\u7aae\u5e74]. Without speech, there is equality. Equality plus speech yields inequality; speech plus equality yields inequality. Therefore, it is said, \"Speak nonspeech.\" If you speak nonspeech, you may speak till the end of your life without ever having spoken. If till the end of your life you do not speak, you will never have failed to speak. There are grounds for affirmation and there are grounds for denial. There are grounds for saying that something is so and there are grounds for saying that something is not so. Why are things so? They are so because we declare them to be so. Why are things not so? They are not so because we declare that to be not so. Wherein lies affirmation? Affirmation lies in our affirming. Wherein lies denial? Denial lies in our denying. All things are possessed of that which we may say is so; all things are possessed of that which we may affirm. There is no thing that is not so; there is no thing that is not affirmable. If it were not for the impromptu words that pour forth every day and harmonize within the framework of nature, who could last long [\u975e\u536e\u8a00\u65e5\u51fa \u548c\u4ee5\u5929\u502a \u5b70\u5f97\u5176\u4e45]?\n\nThe myriad things are all from seeds, and they succeed each other because of their different forms [\u842c\u7269\u7686\u7a2e\u4e5f \u4ee5\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u76f8\u79aa]. From start to finish it is like a circle whose seam is not to be found [\u59cb\u5352\u82e5\u74b0 \u83ab\u5f97\u5176\u502b]. This is called the celestial potter's wheel, and the celestial potter's wheel is the framework of nature [\u662f\u8b02\u5929\u5747 \u5929\u5747\u8005 \u5929\u502a\u4e5f]. (27/1-10, tr. Mair 1994: 278-9) </blockquote>\nThe last part of this passage (27/10) equates ''ti\u0101nn\u00ed'' (\u5929\u502a, tr. \"framework of nature\") with the word ''ti\u0101nj\u016bn'' (\u5929\u5747, \"celestial potter's wheel\") that occurs in two other ''Zhuangzi'' contexts. These interchangeable [[Chinese character classification#Rebus (phonetic loan) characters|phonetic loan characters]] are ''j\u016bn'' ([[wikt:\u5747|\u5747]], \"well balanced; equal; even; uniform; potter's wheel\") and ''j\u016bn'' ([[wikt:\u921e|\u921e]], \"potter's wheel; ancient unit of weight [approx. 15 kilos]; balance, harmonize\") are graphically differentiated by the \"[[Radical 32|earth]]\" and \"[[Radical 167|metal]]\" radicals. The former context says, \"the sage harmonizes the right and wrong of things and rests at the center of the celestial potter's wheel\", and the latter, \"Knowledge that stops at what it cannot know is the ultimate. If someone does not subscribe to this, he will be worn down by the celestial potter's wheel\" (2/40 and 23/45, Mair 1994: 17 and 231).\n\nThe final ''Zhuangzi'' chapter 33 ''Ti\u0101nxi\u00e0'' (\u5929\u4e0b, \"[All] Under Heaven\"), which summarizes early Chinese philosophy, reiterates and rearranges ''yuyan'' \"lodged words,\" ''chongyan'' \"repeated words,\" and ''zhiyan'' \"goblet words\" in a context describing Zhuangzi's delight upon hearing ancient Daoist teachings.\n<blockquote>With absurd expressions, extravagant words, and unbounded phrases [\u4ee5\u8b2c\u60a0\u4e4b\u8aaa \u8352\u5510\u4e4b\u8a00 \u7121\u7aef\u5d16\u4e4b\u8fad], he often gave rein to his whims but was not presumptuous and did not look at things from one angle only. Believing that all under heaven were sunk in stupidity and could not be talked to seriously, he used impromptu words for his effusive elaboration, quotations for the truth, and metaphors for breadth [\u4ee5\u5df5\u8a00\u70ba\u66fc\u884d \u4ee5\u91cd\u8a00\u70ba\u771f \u4ee5\u5bd3\u8a00\u70ba\u5ee3]. Alone, he came and went with the essential spirits of heaven and earth but was not arrogant toward the myriad things. (33/64-6, tr. Mair 343) </blockquote>\nThis word ''m\u00e0ny\u01cen'' (\u66fc\u884d, tr. \"effusive elaboration\") was also used with \"goblet words\" above (27/5), \"Consequently, there is effusive elaboration so that they may live out their years\"\n\n===Commentaries===\nChinese scholarly [[Commentary (philology)|commentaries]] on the ''Zhuangzi'', dating back to [[Guo Xiang]] (252-312 CE), the earliest [[redaction|redactor]] and editor of the text, provide invaluable information on understanding ''zh\u012by\u00e1n'' (\u536e\u8a00, \"goblet words\"). For semantic perspective, summaries of how major commentators explain the related terms ''y\u00f9y\u00e1n'' (\u5bd3\u8a00, \"lodged words\") and ''zh\u00f2ngy\u00e1n'' (\u91cd\u8a00, \"weighted words\") or ''ch\u00f3ngy\u00e1n'' (\u91cd\u8a00, \"repeated words\") will be presented first.\n\n'''''Y\u00f9y\u00e1n'''''. Guo Xiang notes that ''y\u00f9'' (\u5bd3, \"lodge; reside; relocate\") means ''j\u00ec'' ([[wikt:\u5bc4|\u5bc4]], \"lodge at temporarily; stop over; entrust to; confide in\") [the words of] another person (\u5bc4\u4e4b\u4ed6\u4eba). [[Lu Deming]]'s c. 583 [[exegetical]] ''[[Jingdian Shiwen]]'' (Textual Explanations of Classics and Canons) glosses ''y\u00f9'' as ''tu\u014d'' ([[wikt:\u8a17|\u8a17]], \"entrust to; confide to; commit to the care of; rely on\"). The subcommentary by Daoist [[Chongxuan School]] master [[Cheng Xuanying]] (fl. 631-655) explains that although common people are stupid, unreasonable, and suspicious of Daoist teachings (\u4e16\u4eba\u611a\u8ff7\u5984\u70ba\u731c\u5fcc\u805e\u9053\u5df1\u8aaa\u5247\u8d77\u5acc\u7591), using ''y\u00f9y\u00e1n'' to lodge in their viewpoints will enable them to understand, as exemplified by ''Zhuangzi'''s famous allegorical characters such as [[Hong Meng]] (Vast Obscurity) and [[Hong Meng#Zhuangzi|Yun Jiang]] (Cloud General).\n\n'''''Zh\u00f2ngy\u00e1n''''' (\u91cd\u8a00, \"weighted/weighty words) or '''''ch\u00f3ngy\u00e1n''''' (\u91cd\u8a00, \"repeated words\") are two main alternate readings. Guo Xiang implied that the ''Zhuangzi'' term should be read ''zhongyan'', \"the weighty authorities of the time\" (\u4e16\u4e4b\u6240\u91cd) while Guo Qingfan (\u90ed\u6176\u85e9, 1844-1896) said it should be read ''chongyan'', meaning \"repetitions of words\" (Guo and Zhang 2018: 52). Cheng's subcommentary says it refers to ancient sayings of respected (''z\u016bnzh\u00f2ng'' \u5c0a\u91cd) local elders, personages such as the [[Yellow Emperor]] and [[Confucius]].\n\n'''''Zhiyan''''' (\u536e\u8a00, \"goblet words\") occur three times in chapter 27. For the first statement (27/1) that \"impromptu words pour forth every day and harmonize within the framework of nature\", Guo Xiang explains how \"goblet words\" ''su\u00ed'' ([[wikt:\u96a8|\u96a8]], \"follow after; pursue; go along with; naturally adjust to\") the changing meanings of their [[referent]]s like a self-righting ''zhi'' goblet. \n<blockquote>A goblet when full gets tipped and when empty is set upright [\u592b\u5df5 \u6eff\u5247\u50be \u7a7a\u5247\u4ef0]\u2014it does not just stay the same. How much the more this is true of words, for they change [\u96a8] according to what they refer to. Since they but follow them (their referents), this is why the text says they \"appear day by day\" [''r\u00ecch\u016b'' \u65e5\u51fa, \"sunrise\"]. \"Appear day by day\" means \"new each day\" [''r\u00ecx\u012bn'' \u65e5\u65b0, \"daily renewal\"]. Since they are new each day, they fulfill what is naturally allotted to them [''z\u00ecr\u00e1n zh\u012b f\u0113n'' \u81ea\u7136\u4e4b\u5206, \"natural boundaries\"], and because their natural allotments are thus fulfilled, they operate harmoniously. (tr. Moeller and Wohlfart 2014: 67). </blockquote>\nCheng Xuanying notes a ''zhi'' goblet is a \"wine vessel\" (\u9152\u5668), and glosses ''zhiyan'' as words spoken ''[[Mushin (mental state)|wuxin]]'' ([[wikt:\u7121|\u7121]]\u5fc3, lit. \"not heart-mind\", \"unwittingly; unintentionally; unconsciously\") that go along with either side of an argument. \n<blockquote>A goblet when full gets tipped and when empty is set upright [\u592b\u5df5 \u6eff\u5247\u50be \u5df5\u7a7a\u5247\u4ef0]. Whether it is tipped or set upright depends on [\u96a8] someone. Words uttered unconsciously [\u7121\u5fc3\u4e4b\u8a00], this is what \"goblet words\" are. Therefore, one either does not speak or one's speech is done without any \"tipping\" or \"being set upright.\" Only then do words match what is naturally allotted to them. (tr. Moeller and Wohlfart 2014: 67). </blockquote>\nCheng cites the alternate interpretation of Guo's contemporary [[Sima Biao]] (c. 238-306) that the text used ''zh\u012b'' (\u536e, \"goblet\") as a pun on the phonetic loan character ''zh\u012b'' ([[wikt:\u652f|\u652f]], \"divergent; different\") in ''zh\u012bl\u00ed'' ([[wikt:\u652f\u96e2|\u652f\u96e2]], \"fragmented; disorganized; jumbled\"), taking ''zhiyan'' (\u536e\u8a00) to mean \"words that are irregular, uneven, and jumbled, having neither a head nor a tail\" (tr. Lin 1994: 62).\n\nFor the second occurrence of \"goblet words\" in the statement that \"Consequently, there is effusive elaboration so that they may live out their years\" (27/5), Guo's commentary says that since \"natural boundaries\" (\u81ea\u7136\u4e4b\u5206) are dominated by neither right nor wrong and \"effusively elaborate\" (\u66fc\u884d), no one can determine which is right. Thus, one can be in a worry-free state of mind and live out one's natural lifespan. Cheng Xuanying defines ''m\u00e0ny\u01cen'' (\u66fc\u884d, tr. \"effusive elaboration\") as ''wuxin'' (\u7121\u5fc3, \"unconsciously; unintentionally\"), which he uses above (27/1) to define ''zhiyan'', and explains that by following (\u96a8) the changes of each new day and harmonizing with natural boundaries, one can abide with the universal and instinctively deal with everything.\n\nThird, Zhuangzi (27/9) rhetorically questions \"If it were not for the impromptu words that pour forth every day and harmonize within the framework of nature, who could last long?\" Guo Xiang points out that we can avoid problems if our words follow (\u96a8) the ''zh\u00ec'' ([[wikt:\u5236|\u5236]], \"cut; design\") of things and conform to (\u5929\u7136\u4e4b\u5206) \"natural boundaries\", replacing his above ''z\u00ecr\u00e1n'' ([[wikt:\u81ea\u7136|\u81ea\u7136]], lit. \"self-so\", \"nature; natural\") with the near-synonym ''[[Ziran#Additional information|ti\u0101nr\u00e1n]]'' ([[wikt:\u5929\u7136|\u5929\u7136]], lit. \"heaven-so\", \"natural, not artificial; innate\"). Cheng's subcommentary says the only way to achieve Daoist longevity is by following (''sui'' \u96a8) daily changes and having regard for natural principles.\n\nGuo does not comment on chapter 33's \"he used impromptu words for his effusive elaboration, quotations for the truth, and metaphors for breadth\". However, Cheng glosses ''zhiyan'' goblet words as ''b\u00f9d\u00ecng'' (\u4e0d\u5b9a, \"not sure; uncertain; indefinite\") and repeats his (27/5) gloss of ''m\u00e0ny\u01cen'' (\u66fc\u884d) as ''w\u00fax\u012bn'' (\u7121\u5fc3, \"unconsciously\"), which differs from his (27/1) gloss of ''zhiyan'' as ''w\u00fax\u012bn zh\u012b y\u00e1n'' (\u7121\u5fc3\u4e4b\u8a00, \"words uttered unconsciously\").\n\n===Translations===\nDescribing the crosslinguistic difficulties of deciphering the ''Zhuangzi'', the translator [[A. C. Graham]] said it perfectly illustrates \"the kind of battering which a text may suffer between being written in one language and being transferred to another at the other end of the world some two thousand years later\" (1981: 277). Translating the [[Old Chinese]] word ''zhiyan'' (\u536e\u8a00, lit. \"goblet word/saying\") into English exemplifies these problems.\n\nCompare how some [[Zhuangzi (book)#Notable translations|notable translations]] of the ''Zhuangzi'' render the ''sanyan'' (\u4e09\u8a00) contexts. In cases where translations have internal inconsistencies, the most common one is cited; take Legge for instance, \"words are like the water that daily fills the cup\", \"Words like the water that daily issues from the cup\", \"words of the (water-)cup\", \" and \"words of the cup\" (1891: 142, 143, 143, 228).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ English translations of ''Zhuangzi'''s \"Three [Kinds of] Words\"\n|-\n!

Watson explains his \"imputed\" translation to mean \"words put into the mouth of historical or fictional persons to make them more compelling\" (1968: 303), which Ziporyn adapts. Following Guo Xiang's commentary that ''y\u00f9'' (\u5bd3, \"lodge\") means ''j\u00ec'' (\u5bc4, \"lodge temporarily; impart\" metaphorical meaning), Graham translates ''yuyan'' as \"saying from a lodging-place\", meaning the \"temporary standpoints between which the sage circulates as the situation changes\", and concludes, \"the lodging-place is the standpoint of the other party in the debate. Although nothing can be settled by disputation, in which everyone has started from his own choice of names, it is possible to convince a man by temporarily assuming his standpoint and arguing from it\" (1981: 107).\n\nThe present sample of ''Zhuangzi'' translators are divided between parsing as '''''ch\u00f3ngy\u00e1n''''' (\u91cd\u8a00, \"repeated words\") or '''''zh\u00f2ngy\u00e1n''''' (\u91cd\u8a00, \"weighty/weighted words). The former is evident in \"quotations\" (Balfour, Ware, Mair), \"illustrations taken from valued writers\" (Legge), and literally translated \"repeated words\" (Watson), who notes \"words of the wise old men of the past which are 'repeated' or quoted to give authority to the argument\" (1968: 303). The latter interpretation appears in \"language based upon weighty authority\" (Giles), and \"'weighty' saying\" (Graham), remarking that \"Weighted saying is the aphorism with the weight of the speaker's experience behind it.\" (1981: 106). Ziporyn's \"citations from weighty ancient authorities\" translation splits the difference.\n\nSeveral authors explain their translations of the semantically obscure word '''''zhiyan''''' (\u536e\u8a00). Giles notes that it refers to the \"natural overflowings of the heart.\" (1926: 363). [[Burton Watson]] says that \"goblet words\" are words that \"adapt to and follow along with the fluctuating nature of the world and thus achieve a state of harmony\" (1968: 303). Graham gives two explanations of \"'spillover' sayings\". \n<blockquote>We are told that it is for daily use, says most when it says least and least when it says most, that it shifts freely from one standpoint to another, and that we cannot prolong discourse or live out our lives without it. Presumably this is the ordinary language in which meanings fluctuate but right themselves in the spontaneous flow in discourse, providing that the speaker has the knack of using words, can 'smooth it out on the whetstone of Heaven.' (1981: 26) </blockquote>\nAnd it is \"speech characterised by the intelligent spontaneity of Taoist behaviour in general, a fluid language which keeps its equilibrium through changing meanings and viewpoints\" (1981: 107). Watson says \"goblet words\" \"adapt to and follow along with the fluctuating nature of the world and thus achieve a state of harmony\" (1968: 303). Acknowledging the \"enormous variety of speculative opinion\" about the meaning of ''zhiyan'' \"goblet words\", Mair suggests it is \"language that pours forth unconsciously and unpremeditatedly\" (1994: 376).\n\nThe ''Zhuangzi'' commentary of Wang Xianqian (\u738b\u5148\u8b19, 1842-1917) says liquids adjust to a goblet's shape like goblet words follow individual semantics, and advises us to think flexibly and agree with the inconsistencies of what people say.\n\nZhang Mosheng (\u5f35\u9ed8\u751f, 1895-1979) described ''zhiyan'' as language without any fixed opinion, like a ''l\u00f2ud\u01d2u'' ([[wikt:\u6f0f\u6597|\u6f0f\u6597]], \"funnel\") simply channeling the sound; \"The ''zhi'' is a funnel, and ''zhiyan'' is funnel-like language. A funnel is hollow and bottomless, so that if one pours in water, it immediately leaks out.\" (tr. Fried 2007: 149).\n\n==See also==\n[[File:Higashiyama Botanical Garden Shishiodoshi 20170617.gif|thumb|A self-tipping and self-righting ''[[shishi-odoshi]]'' breaks the quietness of a Japanese garden with the sound of a bamboo container hitting a rock.]]\n*[[Dribble glass]], a prank drinking glass with hidden holes that spill the drink when tilted\n*[[Fuddling cup]], a three-dimensional puzzle drinking vessel made of multiple cups linked together by holes and tubes, making it difficult to drink from without spilling\n*[[Puzzle jug]], a practical-joke vessel with pierced holes around its neck, challenging users to drink without spilling the contents on themselves\n*[[Pythagorean cup]], a practical-joke drinking cup, which when filled beyond a certain point, a siphoning effect causes the cup to drain its entire contents through the base\n*''[[Shishi-odoshi]]'' (lit. \"animal scarer\") a traditional device found in Japanese gardens, with a bamboo tube that gradually fills with water and then tilts to drain, making a clanking sound to scare away any crop-eating animals\n\n==References==\n*Anderson, E.

The [[Daoist]] classic ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' first recorded this term for a mystical [[Language ideology|linguistic ideology]], which is generally interpreted to mean fluid language that maintains its equilibrium through shifting meanings and viewpoints, thus enabling one to spontaneously go along with all sides of an argument.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe ''Zhuangzi'' text contains [[neologisms]] for three [[figure of speech|figures of speech]]: ''y\u00f9y\u00e1n'' (\u5bd3\u8a00, lit. \"lodged words\"), ''ch\u00f3ngy\u00e1n'' (\u91cd\u8a00, \"repeated words\") or ''zh\u00f2ngy\u00e1n'' (\u91cd\u8a00, \"weighted words\"), and ''zh\u012by\u00e1n'' (\u536e\u8a00, \"goblet words\")\u2014later referred to as the ''s\u0101ny\u00e1n'' (\u4e09\u8a00, \"three [kinds of] words\") (Guo and Zhang 2018). These terms [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] ''y\u00e1n'' ([[wikt:\u8a00|\u8a00]], \"speech, talk; sayings; words\") with ''y\u00f9'' ([[wikt:\u5bd3|\u5bd3]], \"lodge, reside; dwell, sojourn; entrust; imply, contain\"), ''ch\u00f3ng'' ([[wikt:\u91cd|\u91cd]], \"double, multiple; duplicate, repeat; accumulate\") or ''zh\u00f2ng'' (\u91cd, \"heavy; weight, weighty, important; serious\"), and ''zh\u012b'' ([[wikt:\u536e|\u536e]] or [[wikt:\u5df5|\u5df5]], \"ancient wine goblet\"). All three of these ancient Zhuangzian terms became part of modern [[Standard Chinese]] vocabulary; ''yuyan'' is a common word meaning \"fable; allegory; parable\", ''chongyan'' is a specialized linguistic term for \"[[reduplication]], reduplicated word/morpheme\", and ''zhiyan'' is a [[literary Chinese|literary]] reference to ''Zhuangzi'', sometimes used in self-deprecatory titles, such as Wang Shizhen's (\u738b\u4e16\u8c9e) 1558 ''Y\u00ecyuan zhiyan'' ([https://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hant/%E8%97%9D%E8%8B%91%E5%8D%AE%E8%A8%80 \u85dd\u82d1\u536e\u8a00], Goblet Words on Art and Literature).\n\nThe first [[Chinese dictionary]] of characters, [[Xu Shen]]'s c. 121 CE ''[[Shuowen jiezi]]'', provides a representative set of ancient [[Han dynasty]] \"wine vessel\" names. ''Zh\u012b'' (\u536e or \u5df5) is defined as \"a round vessel (\u571c\u5668), also called ''d\u00e0n'' ([[wikt:\u89db|\u89db]]), used to regulate drinking and eating (\u7bc0\u98f2\u98df)\", which is a classical allusion to the ''[[Yijing]]'' (27). ''D\u00e0n'' (\u89db) is in turn defined as a \"small ''zh\u00ec'' (\u5c0f\u89f6), and the ''sh\u0101ng'' ([[wikt:\u89f4|\u89f4]], \"wine-drinking cup\") definition says ''sh\u0101ng'' refers to a full ''zh\u00ec'' ([[wikt:\u89f6|\u89f6]]) and ''zh\u00ec'' to an empty one. The ''Shuowen'' defines ''zh\u00ec'' (\u89f6) as a \"ceremonial wine-drinking horn used in the countryside (\u9109\u98f2\u9152\u89d2)\", cites the ''[[Yili]]'' \"The host then sits, takes the goblet, and washes it. (\u4e00\u4eba\u6d17\u8209\u89f6)\" (tr. Steele 1917: 79), and notes that one ''zhi'' was a liquid measure equivalent to four ''sh\u0113ng'' ([[Chinese units of measurement#Volume|\u5347]], about half a gallon). ''Zhu\u01cen'' ([[wikt:\ud859\udcdd|\ud859\udcdd]]) is defined as a \"small ''zhi'' goblet\" (\u5c0f\u5df5), and ''shu\u00e0n'' ([[wikt:\ud846\udf50|\ud846\udf50]]) as a \"small ''zhi'' goblet with handles and a cover\" (\u5c0f\u5df5\u6709\u8033\u84cb\u8005).\n\nAnother Han scholar [[Ying Shao]] (140-206) said ''zh\u012b'' (\u536e) and ''zh\u00ec'' (\u89f6) refer to the same object, \"A regional drinking-vessel for ritual use; formerly made holding four ''sheng''; formerly the word ''zhi'' (\u536e ) was written ''zhi'' (\u89f6) or [also pronounced ''di''] ([[wikt:\u89dd|\u89dd]])\" (tr. Fried 2007: 154). Lin Shuen-fu disagrees with Ying and suggests ''zh\u012b'' (\u536e) and ''zh\u00ec'' (\u89f6) denote different sizes vessels of the same type and function, specifically the type of wine goblets that have a \"round, column-like body, a slightly flaring mouth, and a ring foot\" (1994: 62).\n\nThe historian [[Wang Guowei]] linguistically equated the ''zh\u012b'' (\u536e) goblet with four ancient wine vessels: ''zh\u00ec'' (\u89f6), ''d\u00e0n'' (\u89db), ''shu\u00e0n'' (\ud846\udf50), and ''zhu\u01cen'' (\ud859\udcdd) (1923, 6: 291-3). The former two are written with the standard \"[[Radical 148|horn radical]]\" ([[wikt:\u89d2|\u89d2]]; no. 148 in the [[Kangxi radical|''Kangxi'' radicals]]); and the latter two with the ancient \"goblet radical\" ([[wikt:\u536e|\u536e]]; no. 337 in the [[List of Shuowen Jiezi radicals|''Shuowen Jiezi'' radicals]]), a lexicographic category with only these two rare characters.\n\nThe Chinese [[Epigraphy|epigrapher]] Rong Geng (\u5bb9\u5e9a) archaeologically concluded that the original denotations of ''zh\u00ec'' or ''zh\u012b'' are uncertain (1941: 404). Within the [[Chinese ritual bronzes|Chinese ritual bronze]] terminology of [[Song dynasty]] (960-1127) [[Song dynasty#Archaeology|antiquarians]], ''zh\u00ec'' (\u89f6) was a common [[Western Zhou]] era (c. 1045-771 BCE) [[Chinese ritual bronzes#Wine vessels|wine vessel]] with a small, oval cross section, ring-feet, slender S-shaped profile, and often a cover; and ''zh\u012b'' (\u536e or \u5df5) was a rare [[Spring and Autumn period]] (771-476 BCE) wine drinking vessel with a squat oval cross-section, ring-feet, and annular handles. \n\n'''Chinese [[Chinese ritual bronzes#Wine vessels|ritual bronze wine vessels]] associated with ''zh\u012b'' (\u536e) goblets'''\n<gallery>\nFile:Chinese - Wine Vessel - Walters 542184.jpg|'''''Ju\u00e9''''' (\u7235) tripod wine flagon, [[Shang dynasty]], c. 12th century BCE\nFile:\u897f\u5468\u201c\u7236\u4e01\u201d\u6709\u76d6\u94dc\u89d21.jpg|'''''Ju\u00e9''''' (\u89d2) tripod wine flagon, [[Western Zhou]], c. 7th century BCE\nFile:Chinese - Wine beaker - Walters 541237.jpg|'''''G\u016b''''' (\u89da) tall wine beaker, Shang dynasty, c. 13th century BCE\nFile:Ritual Wine Vessel (Guang), 13th-11th century B.C.E.

Both passages give [[metadiscourse|metadiscursive]] analyses of the language used in ''Zhuangzi'', namely, the ''sanyan'' three [kinds of] words, ''y\u00f9y\u00e1n'' (\u5bd3\u8a00, \"metaphors\"), ''ch\u00f3ngy\u00e1n'' (\u91cd\u8a00, \"quotations\"), and ''zh\u012by\u00e1n'' (\u536e\u8a00, \"impromptu words\"). Note that unless otherwise identified, translations are by [[Victor H. Mair]] (1994).\n\n===Passages===\nChapter 27 ''Y\u00f9y\u00e1n'' (\u5bd3\u8a00, \"Metaphors\") mentions ''zh\u012by\u00e1n'' (\u536e\u8a00) three times in the phrase \"impromptu words pour forth every day and harmonize within the framework of nature\" (''Zh\u012by\u00e1n r\u00ecch\u016b h\u00e9 y\u01d0 ti\u0101nn\u00ed'' \u536e\u8a00\u65e5\u51fa \u548c\u4ee5\u5929\u502a) ), and these passages are described as \"the most difficult in the entire chapter\" (Lin 1994: 61). First, the lead (27/1) introduces this phrase, which two parallel passages repeat and describe how using impromptu goblet words can result in longevity. Second, the ''Zhuangzi'' (27/5) says, \"Consequently, there is effusive elaboration [''m\u00e0ny\u01cen'' ([[wikt:\u66fc\u884d|\u66fc\u884d]], \"spread out far and wide\")] so that they may live out their years\" (\u536e\u8a00\u65e5\u51fa \u548c\u4ee5\u5929\u502a \u56e0\u4ee5\u66fc\u884d \u6240\u4ee5\u7aae\u5e74). Third, the context (27/9) asks a ''f\u0113i'' ([[wikt:\u975e|\u975e]], \"not\") negative [[Conditional sentence|conditional]] question, \"If it were not for the impromptu words that pour forth every day and harmonize within the framework of nature, who could last long?\" (\u975e\u536e\u8a00\u65e5\u51fa \u548c\u4ee5\u5929\u502a \u5b70\u5f97\u5176\u4e45).\n<blockquote>Metaphors are effective nine times out of ten and quotations seven times out of ten, but impromptu words come forth every day and harmonize within the framework of nature [\u536e\u8a00\u65e5\u51fa \u548c\u4ee5\u5929\u502a]. \nMetaphors are effective nine times out of ten because they borrow externals to discuss something. A father does not act as a matchmaker for his son. It's better for someone who is not the father to praise the son than for the father himself to do so. Then it won't be his own fault, but somebody else's fault. If someone agrees with oneself, one responds favorably, but if someone does not agree with oneself, one opposes them. One considers to be right those who agree with oneself and considers to be wrong those who disagree with oneself\n\nQuotations are effective seven times out of ten because their purpose is to stop speech. They are from our elders, those who precede us in years. But those who fill up the years of their old age without grasping what is significant and what is rudimentary are not really our predecessors. If a man has not that whereby he precedes others, he lacks the way of humanity. If a man lacks the way of humanity, he may be called a stale person.\n\nImpromptu words pour forth every day and harmonize within the framework of nature [\u536e\u8a00\u65e5\u51fa \u548c\u4ee5\u5929\u502a]. Consequently, there is effusive elaboration so that they may live out their years [\u56e0\u4ee5\u66fc\u884d \u6240\u4ee5\u7aae\u5e74]. Without speech, there is equality. Equality plus speech yields inequality; speech plus equality yields inequality. Therefore, it is said, \"Speak nonspeech.\" If you speak nonspeech, you may speak till the end of your life without ever having spoken. If till the end of your life you do not speak, you will never have failed to speak. There are grounds for affirmation and there are grounds for denial. There are grounds for saying that something is so and there are grounds for saying that something is not so. Why are things so? They are so because we declare them to be so. Why are things not so? They are not so because we declare that to be not so. Wherein lies affirmation? Affirmation lies in our affirming. Wherein lies denial? Denial lies in our denying. All things are possessed of that which we may say is so; all things are possessed of that which we may affirm. There is no thing that is not so; there is no thing that is not affirmable. If it were not for the impromptu words that pour forth every day and harmonize within the framework of nature, who could last long [\u975e\u536e\u8a00\u65e5\u51fa \u548c\u4ee5\u5929\u502a \u5b70\u5f97\u5176\u4e45]?\n\nThe myriad things are all from seeds, and they succeed each other because of their different forms [\u842c\u7269\u7686\u7a2e\u4e5f \u4ee5\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u76f8\u79aa]. From start to finish it is like a circle whose seam is not to be found [\u59cb\u5352\u82e5\u74b0 \u83ab\u5f97\u5176\u502b]. This is called the celestial potter's wheel, and the celestial potter's wheel is the framework of nature [\u662f\u8b02\u5929\u5747 \u5929\u5747\u8005 \u5929\u502a\u4e5f]. (27/1-10, tr. Mair 1994: 278-9) </blockquote>\nThe last part of this passage (27/10) equates ''ti\u0101nn\u00ed'' (\u5929\u502a, tr. \"framework of nature\") with the word ''ti\u0101nj\u016bn'' (\u5929\u5747, \"celestial potter's wheel\") that occurs in two other ''Zhuangzi'' contexts. These interchangeable [[Chinese character classification#Rebus (phonetic loan) characters|phonetic loan characters]] are ''j\u016bn'' ([[wikt:\u5747|\u5747]], \"well balanced; equal; even; uniform; potter's wheel\") and ''j\u016bn'' ([[wikt:\u921e|\u921e]], \"potter's wheel; ancient unit of weight [approx. 15 kilos]; balance, harmonize\") are graphically differentiated by the \"[[Radical 32|earth]]\" and \"[[Radical 167|metal]]\" radicals. The former context says, \"the sage harmonizes the right and wrong of things and rests at the center of the celestial potter's wheel\", and the latter, \"Knowledge that stops at what it cannot know is the ultimate. If someone does not subscribe to this, he will be worn down by the celestial potter's wheel\" (2/40 and 23/45, Mair 1994: 17 and 231).\n\nThe final ''Zhuangzi'' chapter 33 ''Ti\u0101nxi\u00e0'' (\u5929\u4e0b, \"[All] Under Heaven\"), which summarizes early Chinese philosophy, reiterates and rearranges ''yuyan'' \"lodged words,\" ''chongyan'' \"repeated words,\" and ''zhiyan'' \"goblet words\" in a context describing Zhuangzi's delight upon hearing ancient Daoist teachings.\n<blockquote>With absurd expressions, extravagant words, and unbounded phrases [\u4ee5\u8b2c\u60a0\u4e4b\u8aaa \u8352\u5510\u4e4b\u8a00 \u7121\u7aef\u5d16\u4e4b\u8fad], he often gave rein to his whims but was not presumptuous and did not look at things from one angle only. Believing that all under heaven were sunk in stupidity and could not be talked to seriously, he used impromptu words for his effusive elaboration, quotations for the truth, and metaphors for breadth [\u4ee5\u5df5\u8a00\u70ba\u66fc\u884d \u4ee5\u91cd\u8a00\u70ba\u771f \u4ee5\u5bd3\u8a00\u70ba\u5ee3]. Alone, he came and went with the essential spirits of heaven and earth but was not arrogant toward the myriad things. (33/64-6, tr. Mair 343) </blockquote>\nThis word ''m\u00e0ny\u01cen'' (\u66fc\u884d, tr. \"effusive elaboration\") was also used with \"goblet words\" above (27/5), \"Consequently, there is effusive elaboration so that they may live out their years\"\n\n===Commentaries===\nChinese scholarly [[Commentary (philology)|commentaries]] on the ''Zhuangzi'', dating back to [[Guo Xiang]] (252-312 CE), the earliest [[redaction|redactor]] and editor of the text, provide invaluable information on understanding ''zh\u012by\u00e1n'' (\u536e\u8a00, \"goblet words\"). For semantic perspective, summaries of how major commentators explain the related terms ''y\u00f9y\u00e1n'' (\u5bd3\u8a00, \"lodged words\") and ''zh\u00f2ngy\u00e1n'' (\u91cd\u8a00, \"weighted words\") or ''ch\u00f3ngy\u00e1n'' (\u91cd\u8a00, \"repeated words\") will be presented first.\n\n'''''Y\u00f9y\u00e1n'''''. Guo Xiang notes that ''y\u00f9'' (\u5bd3, \"lodge; reside; relocate\") means ''j\u00ec'' ([[wikt:\u5bc4|\u5bc4]], \"lodge at temporarily; stop over; entrust to; confide in\") [the words of] another person (\u5bc4\u4e4b\u4ed6\u4eba). [[Lu Deming]]'s c. 583 [[exegetical]] ''[[Jingdian Shiwen]]'' (Textual Explanations of Classics and Canons) glosses ''y\u00f9'' as ''tu\u014d'' ([[wikt:\u8a17|\u8a17]], \"entrust to; confide to; commit to the care of; rely on\"). The subcommentary by Daoist [[Chongxuan School]] master [[Cheng Xuanying]] (fl. 631-655) explains that although common people are stupid, unreasonable, and suspicious of Daoist teachings (\u4e16\u4eba\u611a\u8ff7\u5984\u70ba\u731c\u5fcc\u805e\u9053\u5df1\u8aaa\u5247\u8d77\u5acc\u7591), using ''y\u00f9y\u00e1n'' to lodge in their viewpoints will enable them to understand, as exemplified by ''Zhuangzi'''s famous allegorical characters such as [[Hong Meng]] (Vast Obscurity) and [[Hong_Meng#Zhuangzi|Yun Jiang]] (Cloud General). \n\n'''''Zh\u00f2ngy\u00e1n''''' (\u91cd\u8a00, \"weighted/weighty words) or '''''ch\u00f3ngy\u00e1n''''' (\u91cd\u8a00, \"repeated words\") are two main alternate readings. Guo Xiang implied that the ''Zhuangzi'' term should be read ''zhongyan'', \"the weighty authorities of the time\" (\u4e16\u4e4b\u6240\u91cd) while Guo Qingfan (\u90ed\u6176\u85e9, 1844-1896) said it should be read ''chongyan'', meaning \"repetitions of words\" (Guo and Zhang 2018: 52). Cheng's subcommentary says it refers to ancient sayings of respected (''z\u016bnzh\u00f2ng'' \u5c0a\u91cd) local elders, personages such as the [[Yellow Emperor]] and [[Confucius]].\n\n'''''Zhiyan''''' (\u536e\u8a00, \"goblet words\") occur three times in chapter 27. For the first statement (27/1) that \"impromptu words pour forth every day and harmonize within the framework of nature\", Guo Xiang explains how \"goblet words\" ''su\u00ed'' ([[wikt:\u96a8|\u96a8]], \"follow after; pursue; go along with; naturally adjust to\") the changing meanings of their [[referent]]s like a self-righting ''zhi'' goblet. \n<blockquote>A goblet when full gets tipped and when empty is set upright [\u592b\u5df5 \u6eff\u5247\u50be \u7a7a\u5247\u4ef0]\u2014it does not just stay the same. How much the more this is true of words, for they change [\u96a8] according to what they refer to. Since they but follow them (their referents), this is why the text says they \"appear day by day\" [''r\u00ecch\u016b'' \u65e5\u51fa, \"sunrise\"]. \"Appear day by day\" means \"new each day\" [''r\u00ecx\u012bn'' \u65e5\u65b0, \"daily renewal\"]. Since they are new each day, they fulfill what is naturally allotted to them [''z\u00ecr\u00e1n zh\u012b f\u0113n'' \u81ea\u7136\u4e4b\u5206, \"natural boundaries\"], and because their natural allotments are thus fulfilled, they operate harmoniously. (tr. Moeller and Wohlfart 2014: 67). </blockquote>\nCheng Xuanying notes a ''zhi'' goblet is a \"wine vessel\" (\u9152\u5668), and glosses ''zhiyan'' as words spoken ''[[Mushin (mental state)|wuxin]]'' ([[wikt:\u7121|\u7121]]\u5fc3, lit. \"not heart-mind\", \"unwittingly; unintentionally; unconsciously\") that go along with either side of an argument. \n<blockquote>A goblet when full gets tipped and when empty is set upright [\u592b\u5df5 \u6eff\u5247\u50be \u5df5\u7a7a\u5247\u4ef0]. Whether it is tipped or set upright depends on [\u96a8] someone. Words uttered unconsciously [\u7121\u5fc3\u4e4b\u8a00], this is what \"goblet words\" are. Therefore, one either does not speak or one's speech is done without any \"tipping\" or \"being set upright.\" Only then do words match what is naturally allotted to them. (tr. Moeller and Wohlfart 2014: 67). </blockquote>\nCheng cites the alternate interpretation of Guo's contemporary [[Sima Biao]] (c. 238-306) that the text used ''zh\u012b'' (\u536e, \"goblet\") as a pun on the phonetic loan character ''zh\u012b'' ([[wikt:\u652f|\u652f]], \"divergent; different\") in ''zh\u012bl\u00ed'' ([[wikt:\u652f\u96e2|\u652f\u96e2]], \"fragmented; disorganized; jumbled\"), taking ''zhiyan'' (\u536e\u8a00) to mean \"words that are irregular, uneven, and jumbled, having neither a head nor a tail\" (tr. Lin 1994: 62).\n\nFor the second occurrence of \"goblet words\" in the statement that \"Consequently, there is effusive elaboration so that they may live out their years\" (27/5), Guo's commentary says that since \"natural boundaries\" (\u81ea\u7136\u4e4b\u5206) are dominated by neither right nor wrong and \"effusively elaborate\" (\u66fc\u884d), no one can determine which is right. Thus, one can be in a worry-free state of mind and live out one's natural lifespan. Cheng Xuanying defines ''m\u00e0ny\u01cen'' (\u66fc\u884d, tr. \"effusive elaboration\") as ''wuxin'' (\u7121\u5fc3, \"unconsciously; unintentionally\"), which he uses above (27/1) to define ''zhiyan'', and explains that by following (\u96a8) the changes of each new day and harmonizing with natural boundaries, one can abide with the universal and instinctively deal with everything.\n\nThird, Zhuangzi (27/9) rhetorically questions \"If it were not for the impromptu words that pour forth every day and harmonize within the framework of nature, who could last long?\" Guo Xiang points out that we can avoid problems if our words follow (\u96a8) the ''zh\u00ec'' ([[wikt:\u5236|\u5236]], \"cut; design\") of things and conform to (\u5929\u7136\u4e4b\u5206) \"natural boundaries\", replacing his above ''z\u00ecr\u00e1n'' ([[wikt:\u81ea\u7136|\u81ea\u7136]], lit. \"self-so\", \"nature; natural\") with the near-synonym ''[[Ziran#Additional information|ti\u0101nr\u00e1n]]'' ([[wikt:\u5929\u7136|\u5929\u7136]], lit. \"heaven-so\", \"natural, not artificial; innate\"). Cheng's subcommentary says the only way to achieve Daoist longevity is by following (''sui'' \u96a8) daily changes and having regard for natural principles.\n\nGuo does not comment on chapter 33's \"he used impromptu words for his effusive elaboration, quotations for the truth, and metaphors for breadth\". However, Cheng glosses ''zhiyan'' goblet words as ''b\u00f9d\u00ecng'' (\u4e0d\u5b9a, \"not sure; uncertain; indefinite\") and repeats his (27/5) gloss of ''m\u00e0ny\u01cen'' (\u66fc\u884d) as ''w\u00fax\u012bn'' (\u7121\u5fc3, \"unconsciously\"), which differs from his (27/1) gloss of ''zhiyan'' as ''w\u00fax\u012bn zh\u012b y\u00e1n'' (\u7121\u5fc3\u4e4b\u8a00, \"words uttered unconsciously\").\n\n===Translations===\nDescribing the crosslinguistic difficulties of deciphering the ''Zhuangzi'', the translator [[A. C. Graham]] said it perfectly illustrates \"the kind of battering which a text may suffer between being written in one language and being transferred to another at the other end of the world some two thousand years later\" (1981: 277). Translating the [[Old Chinese]] word ''zhiyan'' (\u536e\u8a00, lit. \"goblet word/saying\") into English exemplifies these problems.\n\nCompare how some [[Zhuangzi (book)#Notable translations|notable translations]] of the ''Zhuangzi'' render the ''sanyan'' (\u4e09\u8a00) contexts. In cases where translations have internal inconsistencies, the most common one is cited; take Legge for instance, \"words are like the water that daily fills the cup\", \"Words like the water that daily issues from the cup\", \"words of the (water-)cup\", \" and \"words of the cup\" (1891: 142, 143, 143, 228).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ English translations of ''Zhuangzi'''s \"Three [Kinds of] Words\"\n|-\n!

Watson explains his \"imputed\" translation to mean \"words put into the mouth of historical or fictional persons to make them more compelling\" (1968: 303), which Ziporyn adapts. Following Guo Xiang's commentary that ''y\u00f9'' (\u5bd3, \"lodge\") means ''j\u00ec'' (\u5bc4, \"lodge temporarily; impart\" metaphorical meaning), Graham translates ''yuyan'' as \"saying from a lodging-place\", meaning the \"temporary standpoints between which the sage circulates as the situation changes\", and concludes, \"the lodging-place is the standpoint of the other party in the debate. Although nothing can be settled by disputation, in which everyone has started from his own choice of names, it is possible to convince a man by temporarily assuming his standpoint and arguing from it\" (1981: 107).\n\nThe present sample of ''Zhuangzi'' translators are divided between parsing as '''''ch\u00f3ngy\u00e1n''''' (\u91cd\u8a00, \"repeated words\") or '''''zh\u00f2ngy\u00e1n''''' (\u91cd\u8a00, \"weighty/weighted words). The former is evident in \"quotations\" (Balfour, Ware, Mair), \"illustrations taken from valued writers\" (Legge), and literally translated \"repeated words\" (Watson), who notes \"words of the wise old men of the past which are 'repeated' or quoted to give authority to the argument\" (1968: 303). The latter interpretation appears in \"language based upon weighty authority\" (Giles), and \"'weighty' saying\" (Graham), remarking that \"Weighted saying is the aphorism with the weight of the speaker's experience behind it.\" (1981: 106). Ziporyn's \"citations from weighty ancient authorities\" translation splits the difference.\n\nSeveral authors explain their translations of the semantically obscure word '''''zhiyan''''' (\u536e\u8a00). Giles notes that it refers to the \"natural overflowings of the heart.\" (1926: 363). [[Burton Watson]] says that \"goblet words\" are words that \"adapt to and follow along with the fluctuating nature of the world and thus achieve a state of harmony\" (1968: 303). Graham gives two explanations of \"'spillover' sayings\". \n<blockquote>We are told that it is for daily use, says most when it says least and least when it says most, that it shifts freely from one standpoint to another, and that we cannot prolong discourse or live out our lives without it. Presumably this is the ordinary language in which meanings fluctuate but right themselves in the spontaneous flow in discourse, providing that the speaker has the knack of using words, can 'smooth it out on the whetstone of Heaven.' (1981: 26) </blockquote>\nAnd it is \"speech characterised by the intelligent spontaneity of Taoist behaviour in general, a fluid language which keeps its equilibrium through changing meanings and viewpoints\" (1981: 107). Watson says \"goblet words\" \"adapt to and follow along with the fluctuating nature of the world and thus achieve a state of harmony\" (1968: 303). Acknowledging the \"enormous variety of speculative opinion\" about the meaning of ''zhiyan'' \"goblet words\", Mair suggests it is \"language that pours forth unconsciously and unpremeditatedly\" (1994: 376).\n\nThe ''Zhuangzi'' commentary of Wang Xianqian (\u738b\u5148\u8b19, 1842-1917) says liquids adjust to a goblet's shape like goblet words follow individual semantics, and advises us to think flexibly and agree with the inconsistencies of what people say. \n\nZhang Mosheng (\u5f35\u9ed8\u751f, 1895-1979) described ''zhiyan'' as language without any fixed opinion, like a ''l\u00f2ud\u01d2u'' ([[wikt:\u6f0f\u6597|\u6f0f\u6597]], \"funnel\") simply channeling the sound; \"The ''zhi'' is a funnel, and ''zhiyan'' is funnel-like language. A funnel is hollow and bottomless, so that if one pours in water, it immediately leaks out.\" (tr. Fried 2007: 149).\n\n==See also==\n[[File:Higashiyama Botanical Garden Shishiodoshi 20170617.gif|thumb|A self-tipping and self-righting ''[[shishi-odoshi]]'' breaks the quietness of a Japanese garden with the sound of a bamboo container hitting a rock.]]\n*[[Dribble glass]], a prank drinking glass with hidden holes that spill the drink when tilted\n*[[Fuddling cup]], a three-dimensional puzzle drinking vessel made of multiple cups linked together by holes and tubes, making it difficult to drink from without spilling\n*[[Puzzle jug]], a practical-joke vessel with pierced holes around its neck, challenging users to drink without spilling the contents on themselves\n*[[Pythagorean cup]], a practical-joke drinking cup, which when filled beyond a certain point, a siphoning effect causes the cup to drain its entire contents through the base\n*''[[Shishi-odoshi]]'' (lit. \"animal scarer\") a traditional device found in Japanese gardens, with a bamboo tube that gradually fills with water and then tilts to drain, making a clanking sound to scare away any crop-eating animals\n\n==References==\n*Anderson, E.

2]]''. [[Vulture magazine|Vulture]], in writing a summation review, described the season as \"truly one of the roughest seasons of the show ever. After a stellar, jaw-unhingingly good ''All Stars 2'', this season felt more like an embarrassing cousin you brought to gay happy hour who wears double polos\".<ref>http://www.vulture.com/2018/03/rupauls-drag-race-where-did-it-go-wrong-this-season.html</ref> [[The A.V. Club]] similarly described the season as disappointing; in their final review of the season, they wrote, \"I should be celebrating the crowning of a new queen in the Drag Race hall of fame, but Drag Race All Stars season three has left me feeling totally underwhelmed and wondering, ''What\u2019s the point''?\"<ref>https://www.avclub.com/a-mediocre-season-of-rupaul-s-drag-race-all-stars-ends-1823821936</ref>\n\n[[Vulture magazine|Vulture]] did however make the point that although the season did not live up to expectations, \"even at its worst, it\u2019s still one of the best, if not the best goddamn reality competition show on television\".<ref>http://www.vulture.com/2018/03/rupauls-drag-race-where-did-it-go-wrong-this-season.html</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External Links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.vh1.com/shows/rupauls-drag-race-all-stars}}\n\n{{RuPaul's Drag Race}}\n\n[[Category:2018 American television seasons]]\n[[Category:RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars seasons]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Third season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars}}\n{{Infobox reality talent competition\n|name          = RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars\n|season        = 3\n|first_aired   = {{Start date|mf=yes|2018|1|25}}\n|last_aired    = {{End date|mf=yes|2018|3|15}}\n|judges        = {{Plainlist|\n* [[RuPaul]]\n* [[Michelle Visage]]\n* [[Carson Kressley]]\n* [[Ross Mathews]]\n}}\n|host          = [[RuPaul]]\n|competitors   = 10\n|broadcaster   = [[VH1]]\n|winner-name   = [[Trixie Mattel]]\n|image              = [[File:Trixie Mattel performing in Helsinki, April 2017.jpg|225px]]\n|winner-origin = Milwaukee, Wisconsin\n|runner-name   = [[Kennedy Davenport]]\n|last          = RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars (season 2)\n|next          = RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars (season 4)\n|year          = Season 3\n}}\nThe third season of ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars]]'' began airing on January 25, 2018.

A new twist on how the top queens of the season were chosen was revealed in the season's last episode. The previously eliminated queens returned in the finale and voted for the top two out of the remaining top four finalists, from there on the two queens with the most votes advanced while the other two were subsequently eliminated. The prizes for the winner of the competition are a one-year supply of [[Anastasia Beverly Hills]] cosmetics and a cash prize of $100,000.\n\nThe winner of the third season of ''RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars'' was [[Trixie Mattel]], with [[Kennedy Davenport]] being the runner-up.\n\n== Contestants ==\n{{See also|List of RuPaul's Drag Race contestants}}\nThe drag queens that competed are:<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/10/20/rupauls-drag-race-all-stars-season-3-cast-announced/amp/|title='RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars' season 3 queens announced: See an exclusive cast photo|date=2017-10-21|work=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=2017-10-21|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n''(Ages and names stated are at time of contest.)''\n\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"2\"  style=\"text-align:center;font-size:96%\"\n|-\n!

2]]''. [[Vulture magazine|Vulture]], in writing a summation review, described the season as \"truly one of the roughest seasons of the show ever. After a stellar, jaw-unhingingly good ''All Stars 2'', this season felt more like an embarrassing cousin you brought to gay happy hour who wears double polos\".<ref>http://www.vulture.com/2018/03/rupauls-drag-race-where-did-it-go-wrong-this-season.html</ref> [[The A.V. Club]] similarly described the season as disappointing; in their final review of the season, they wrote, \"I should be celebrating the crowning of a new queen in the Drag Race hall of fame, but Drag Race All Stars season three has left me feeling totally underwhelmed and wondering, ''What\u2019s the point''?\"<ref>https://www.avclub.com/a-mediocre-season-of-rupaul-s-drag-race-all-stars-ends-1823821936</ref>\n\n[[Vulture magazine|Vulture]] did however make the point that although the season did not live up to expectations, \"even at its worst, it\u2019s still one of the best, if not the best goddamn reality competition show on television\".<ref>http://www.vulture.com/2018/03/rupauls-drag-race-where-did-it-go-wrong-this-season.html</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External Links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.vh1.com/shows/rupauls-drag-race-all-stars}}\n\n{{RuPaul's Drag Race}}\n\n[[Category:2018 American television seasons]]\n[[Category:RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars seasons]]\n", "name_user": "24.183.100.236", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuPaul%27s_Drag_Race_All_Stars_(season_3)"}
