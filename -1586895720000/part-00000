On 6 April he was brought up on a writ of habeas corpus before Lord Mansfield, who declined to interfere, as parliament was still sitting.

Though formerly an active supporter of [[John Wilkes|Wilkes]], Oliver refused to serve as [[Sheriffs of the City of London|sheriff]] with him in 1771 (Gent.

His name appears for the last time in the 'Parliamentary History' on 10 May 1776, when he seconded Sawbridge's resolution that the American colonies should 'be continued upon the same footing of giving and granting their money^ as his Majesty's subjects in Ireland are, by their own representatives' (ib. xviii. 1353). In September 1778 Oliver sent a letter to the livery of London declining being a candidate  for [[Lord Mayor of London]] and on 25 November 1778 resigned as an alderman.
