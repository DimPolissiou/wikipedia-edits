In Thiruvalla, 10% of the population is under 6 years of age. Thiruvalla has a large [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Non-Resident Indian Community]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nOld tradition tells that the name Thiruvalla comes from the word \"''Valla Vaay''\", named after the river Manimala which was known as ''Vallay\u0101r'' in ancient times. Before roads were developed,Thiruvalla village developed at the mouth of river Vallayar,connected far and near places through waterways, hence known as ''Valla v\u0101i''(v\u0101y in old Malayalam means mouth of river).<ref name=\":0\" /> Later the Dravidian Prefix 'Thiru (means holy /revered) attached to it and became Thiruvalla.\n\nAt the time of Aryan migration to south India it became one of the 64 Brahmin settlements. They correlated the name to \"Sree Vallabha\" means Husband of Lakshmi Devi. Sree Vallabha is the presiding deity of the Thiruvalla Temple and argues that shreevallabha Puram (Land of Vallabhan) became Thiruvalla.<ref name=\":0\" /> Thiruvalla as per the Sanskrit work \"\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0935\u0932\u094d\u0932\u092d \u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u092e\u093e\u0939\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u094d\u092f\u092e\u094d\" (\u0d36\u0d4d\u0d30\u0d40\u0d35\u0d32\u0d4d\u0d32\u0d2d \u0d15\u0d4d\u0d37\u0d47\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d30 \u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d39\u0d3e\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d2e\u0d4d\u0d2f\u0d02) (\u015br\u012bvallabha k\u1e63\u0113tra m\u0101h\u0101tmya\u1e41) is \"\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0935\u0932\u094d\u0932\u092d\u092a\u0941\u0930\u092e\u094d\" (\u0d36\u0d4d\u0d30\u0d40\u0d35\u0d32\u0d4d\u0d32\u0d2d\u0d2a\u0d41\u0d30\u0d02)(\u015br\u012bvallabhapura\u1e41).

Thiruvalla is dotted with several natural canal streams (called \"thodu\" in Malayalam) like Chanthathodu, Manippuzha, Mullelithodu, and several others. The city area has riverine alluvial soil, and eastern parts have a laterite loam kind of soil classified under \"Southern Midlands\" agro-ecological zone, while the western suburbs like Niranam have a more sandy type of soil that resembles beaches.

Before roads were developed,Thiruvalla village developed at the mouth of river Vallayar,connected far and near places through waterways, hence known as ''Valla v\u0101i''(v\u0101y in old Malayalam means mouth of river).<ref name=\":0\" /> Later the Dravidian Prefix 'Thiru (means holy /revered) attached to it and became Thiruvalla.\n\nAt the time of Aryan migration to south India it became one of the 64 Brahmin settlements. They correlated the name to \"Sree Vallabha\" means Husband of Lakshmi Devi.
