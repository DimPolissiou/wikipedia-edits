They also enjoyed a regular season streak of 49 consecutive wins ({{Steelers season|1971}}\u2013{{Steelers season|1979}}) against teams that would finish with a losing record that year.\n\nThe [[1980 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]] suffered a rash of injuries in the [[1980 NFL season|1980 season]] and missed the playoffs with a 9\u20137 record. The [[1981 NFL season|1981 season]] was no better, with an 8\u20138 showing. The team was then hit with the retirements of all their key players from the Super Bowl years. \"Mean\" Joe Greene retired after the [[1981 NFL season|1981 season]], Lynn Swann and Jack Ham after [[1982 NFL season|1982]]'s playoff berth, Terry Bradshaw and Mel Blount after [[1983 NFL season|1983]]'s divisional championship, and Jack Lambert after [[1984 NFL season|1984]]'s AFC Championship Game appearance.\n\nAfter those retirements, the franchise skidded to its first losing seasons since 1971.

In those first six seasons, Cowher coached them as deep as the [[AFC Championship Game]] three times and following the [[1995 NFL season|1995 season]] an appearance in [[Super Bowl XXX]] on the strength of the \"Blitzburgh\" defense. However, the Steelers lost to the [[1995 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] in Super Bowl XXX, two weeks after a thrilling [[1995 AFC Championship game|AFC Championship]] victory over the [[1995 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]]. Cowher produced the franchise's record-tying fifth Super Bowl win in [[Super Bowl XL]] over the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] champion [[2005 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] ten years later. With that victory, the Steelers became the third team to win five Super Bowls, and the first sixth-seeded playoff team to reach and win the Super Bowl since the NFL expanded to a 12-team post-season tournament in 1990.  He coached through the 2006 season which ended with an 8\u20138 record, just short of the playoffs.

Tomlin became the third consecutive Steelers Head Coach to go to the Super Bowl, equaling the Dallas Cowboys (Tom Landry, Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer) in this achievement. He was named the Motorola 2008 Coach of the Year. On February 1, 2009, Tomlin led the Steelers to their second Super Bowl of this decade, and went on to win 27\u201323 against the [[2008 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]]. At age 36, he was the youngest head coach to ever win the Super Bowl, and he is only the second African-American coach to ever win the Super Bowl ([[Tony Dungy]] was the first). The 2010 season made Tomlin the only coach to reach the Super Bowl twice before the age of 40.  Tomlin led the team to his second Super Bowl ([[Super Bowl XLV]]) on February 6, 2011. However, the Steelers were defeated in their eighth Super Bowl appearance by the Green Bay Packers by the score of 31\u201325.

Originally, the team wore solid gold-colored helmets and black jerseys. The Steelers' black and gold colors are now shared by all major professional teams in the city, including the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in baseball and the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] in ice hockey, and also the [[Pittsburgh Power]] of the re-formed [[Arena Football League]], and the [[Pittsburgh Passion]] of the [[Independent Women's Football League]]. The shade of gold differs slightly among teams: the Penguins have previously used \"Vegas Gold\", a color similar to metallic gold, and the Pirates' gold is a darker mustard yellow-gold, while the Steelers \"gold\" is more of a bright canary yellow.  Black and gold are also the colors of the [[Flag of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|city's official flag]].\n\nThe Steelers logo was introduced in 1962 and is based on the \"[[Steelmark]]\", originally designed by Pittsburgh's [[U.S. Steel]] and now owned by the [[American Iron and Steel Institute]] (AISI). In fact, it was [[Cleveland]]-based [[Republic Steel]] that suggested the Steelers adopt the industry logo. It consists of the word \"Steelers\" surrounded by three [[astroid]]s ([[hypocycloid]]s of four [[cusp (singularity)|cusps]]). The original meanings behind the astroids were, \"Steel lightens your work, brightens your leisure, and widens your world.\" Later, the colors came to represent the ingredients used in the steel-making process: yellow for coal, red for iron ore, and blue for scrap steel.<ref>{{cite web|title=What Is the Story Behind the Symbol on the Headgear of the Pittsburgh Steelers?|url=http://www.steel.org/Global/document-types/news/2011/what-is-the-story-behind-the-symbol-on-the-headgear-of-the-pittsburgh-steelers.aspx?siteLocation=17d77c91-adc3-4c5b-9158-056d31998ed9|publisher=[[American Iron and Steel Institute]]|date=February 2, 2011|accessdate=May 30, 2016}}</ref> While the formal Steelmark logo contains only the word \"Steel\", the team was given permission to add \"ers\" in 1963 after a petition to AISI.\n\nThe Steelers are the only NFL team that puts its logo on only one side of the helmet (the right side).

In {{Steelers season|1997}}, the team switched to rounded numbers on the jersey to match the number font ([[Futura Condensed]]) on the helmets, and a Steelers logo was added to the left side of the jersey.\n\nThe 2007\u20132011 third uniform, consisting of a black jersey with gold lettering, white pants with black and gold stripes, and a gold helmet were first used during the Steelers' 75th anniversary season in {{Steelers season|2007}}. They were meant to evoke the memory of the {{Steelers season|1963}}\u2013{{Steelers season|1964}} era uniforms. The uniforms were so popular among fans that the Steelers' organization decided to keep them and use them as a third option during home games only.\n\nIn 2012, the Steelers introduced a new third uniform, consisting of a yellow jersey with black horizontal lines (making a bumble bee like pattern) with black lettering and black numbers placed inside a white box, to represent the jerseys worn by the Steelers in their [[1934 Pittsburgh Pirates (NFL) season|1934 season]]. The rest of the uniform consists of beige pants, yellow with black horizontal stripped socks, and the Steelers regular black helmet. The uniforms were used for the Steelers' 80th anniversary season. Much like the previous alternate these jerseys were so popular that they were used up through the 2016 season. The jerseys were nicknamed the \"bumblebee jerseys\" due to looking like the pattern of a bumble bee. The jerseys were retired after the 2016 season.\n\nIn 2018, the Steelers unveiled a third uniform based on those worn by the Steel Curtain teams of the 1970s.

Former Steelers head coach [[Bill Cowher]] coached the Browns special teams and secondary before following [[Marty Schottenheimer]] for a brief tenure as [[Kansas City Chiefs]] defensive coordinator, and then hired by Pittsburgh. This has only intensified the rivalry. The teams have met twice in the postseason (1994 and 2002) with the Steelers winning both meetings.\n*The [[Ravens\u2013Steelers rivalry|Baltimore Ravens and the Steelers]] have had several memorable match-ups and have a bitter divisional rivalry. Both teams handed the other their first losses at their current home fields. The Steelers won the inaugural game played at [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore's]] [[M&T Bank Stadium]] in {{nfly|1998}}, 20\u201313, and three years later the [[Baltimore Ravens|Ravens]] handed the Steelers their first-ever loss at [[Heinz Field]], 13\u201310. Later that season ({{nfly|2001}}) Pittsburgh won a [[2001\u201302 NFL playoffs#AFC: Pittsburgh Steelers 27, Baltimore Ravens 10|divisional playoff game]] 27\u201310 against Baltimore, who was the [[Super Bowl XXXV|defending Super Bowl champion]]. During their NFL championship season in [[2000 Baltimore Ravens season|2000]], the Ravens defeated the Steelers [[Three Rivers Stadium|in Pittsburgh]], 16\u20130, in the season opener with the Steelers later exacting revenge, 9\u20136, in Baltimore (the Ravens' final loss of the season). During the Steelers 2008 Championship run, they beat the Ravens three times, including a win in the AFC Championship game. The two teams complement each other by consistently fielding strong defenses. The Steelers lead the all-time series (including playoffs), 28\u201324.  The teams have met four times in the postseason, with the Steelers owning a 3\u20131 record.\n*The [[Bengals\u2013Steelers rivalry|Steelers' rivalry with the Cincinnati Bengals]] dates from the {{Steelers season|1970}} season, when the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]] was completed. In {{Steelers season|1976}}, the Steelers kept their playoff hopes alive (they later won the division) with a late-season 7\u20133 win in snowy Cincinnati. One of the most memorable games was the [[2005\u201306 NFL playoffs#AFC: Pittsburgh Steelers 31, Cincinnati Bengals 17|2005 AFC Wildcard playoff game]], in which the Steelers, en route to a [[Super Bowl XL|Super Bowl title]], won a 31\u201317 come-from-behind victory after [[Cincinnati Bengals|Bengals]] QB [[Carson Palmer]] was forced to leave the game with a knee injury. The injury happened when nose tackle [[Kimo von Oelhoffen]] contacted Palmer's knee during a passing play.  The Bengals players called this a dirty play; the NFL ruled that it was accidental and did not fine von Oelhoffen for the hit.  The incident led to an intensifying of the rivalry. The Bengals beat the Steelers in Week 13 of the {{Steelers season|2005}} season 38\u201331, and wide receiver [[T. J. Houshmandzadeh]] used a [[Terrible Towel]] to polish his cleats while walking up the tunnel after the game, fueling the rivalry. The Steelers and Bengals finished {{nfly|2005}} and {{nfly|2006}} with identical records (11\u20135 and 8\u20138 respectively), splitting both regular-season series, the Bengals winning the tiebreaker both years due to having a superior division record. The Steelers also are responsible for ending the Bengals' season in Cincinnati two years in a row, eliminating them from the playoffs in {{Steelers season|2005}} and taking them out of contention in {{Steelers season|2006}}. The rivalry has become more intense again since the {{Steelers season|2015}} season. A central figure is Bengals linebacker [[Vontaze Burfict]], often inflicting brutal hits, resulting in serious injuries to several Steelers on multiple occasions. In the 2015 Wild Card playoff game in Cincinnati, Burfict was the culprit of a late penalty directly responsible for an extremely unlikely 18-16 Steelers comeback victory. The Steelers lead the all-time series, 63\u201335.  The teams have met twice in the postseason, with the Steelers winning both times.\n\n=== Historic rivals ===\n====Oakland Raiders====\nThe [[Raiders\u2013Steelers rivalry]] was one of the most heated of the 1970s and early to mid-1980s. The Steelers' first playoff win was a 13\u20137 victory over the Raiders by way of [[Franco Harris]]'s [[Immaculate Reception]] on December 23, 1972. The wild card Pittsburgh football team was knocked out of the playoffs the following year by the Raiders in the 1973 AFC Divisional round 33\u201314, but fired back with two straight AFC Championships in {{nfly|1974}} 24\u201313 and {{nfly|1975}} 16\u201310 over Oakland. Oakland responded with a victory over Pittsburgh in the {{nfly|1976}} AFC Championship game 24\u20137 (the third consecutive AFC title game between the two teams), but not before [[Chuck Noll]] referred to Oakland's [[George Atkinson (safety)|George Atkinson]] as part of the NFL's \"criminal element\" after his alleged cheap-shot on [[Lynn Swann]] during a regular-season matchup. Atkinson and the Raiders later filed a [[defamation of character]] [[lawsuit]] against Noll, but lost. Following the 1983 regular season, the Los Angeles Raiders defeated the Steelers 38\u201310 in the AFC Divisional round which turned out to be the last NFL game for Steeler Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw who did not play due to injury.\n\nWhile the rivalry has dissipated over the years (mostly due to Oakland's decline after [[2002 Oakland Raiders season|2002]]), the teams have had notable games against each other including an upset Steelers victory towards the end of the {{Steelers season|2000}} season to prevent the Raiders from obtaining homefield advantage in the playoffs, and an upset Raiders victory in week 8 of the [[2006 NFL season]] (20\u201313), which helped cost the Steelers a playoff berth. In Week 13 of the 2009 season, another Raiders upset victory happened; the game lead changed five times on five touchdowns in the fourth quarter until Raiders QB [[Bruce Gradkowski]]'s third touchdown of the quarter won it with nine seconds to go. The 27\u201324 loss cost the Steelers another playoff run. The teams met at [[Heinz Field|Pittsburgh]] in {{Steelers season|2010}}, where the Steelers blew out the Raiders 35\u20133, and ended their 3-game winning streak; the game was further notable for a punch thrown by [[Richard Seymour]] of the Raiders against Steelers quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]]. The Raiders then hosted the Steelers in [[2012 Oakland Raiders season|2012]] and erased a 31\u201321 gap to win 34\u201331. The two clubs met again in [[2013 NFL season|2013]] and the Raiders won again, 21\u201318. In 2015, the Steelers defeated the Raiders 38\u201335 at Heinz Field. The Steelers trail the all-time series 16\u201313 (13\u201310 in regular season). In their most recent matchup, the Raiders defeated the Steelers 24\u201321 on December 9, 2018 in Oakland, which, ironically, would cost Pittsburgh another playoff berth.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2018/12/09/raiders-block-fg-to-finish-dramatic-upset-of-steelers-24-21/ | title=Raiders Block FG To Finish Dramatic Upset Of Steelers, 24-21 | publisher=CBS San Francisco | work=The Associated Press | date=9 December 2018 | accessdate=19 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Dallas Cowboys====\nThe [[Cowboys\u2013Steelers rivalry]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/dallas-cowboys/post/_/id/4755558/cowboys-steelers-rivalry-has-been-one-for-the-ages|title=Cowboys, Steelers rivalry has been one for the ages|newspaper=ESPN.com|access-date=January 20, 2017}}</ref> started with the Cowboys' first game as a franchise in {{nfly|1960}} (against the Steelers) at the [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|Cotton Bowl]] with the Steelers coming away with a 35\u201328 victory. These teams hold a record for the most times (three) that two teams have met in a [[Super Bowl]]. The first two times the favored Steelers and Cowboys met came with Pittsburgh victories in the Orange Bowl [[Super Bowl X]] 21\u201317 and [[Super Bowl XIII]] 35\u201331. The Cowboys never won a regular season game in the Orange Bowl and lost three Super Bowl games (once to the Baltimore Colts and twice to the Steelers). Between the Cowboys and Steelers, Super Bowl XIII had the greatest number of future Pro Football Hall of Fame players participating, which as of 2010 numbered 20&nbsp;\u2013 14 players and six coaches/front office, including [[Ernie Stautner]], [[defensive coordinator]] for the Cowboys who was a HoF [[defensive tackle]] for the Steelers. The teams featured an all-star matchup at quarterback between the Steelers' [[Terry Bradshaw]] and the Cowboys' [[Roger Staubach]], both of whom are in the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]]. In {{nfly|1977}}, Staubach and the Cowboys won [[Super Bowl XII]], their second and last loss of their season being inflicted by Bradshaw and the Steelers, 28\u201313 at Three Rivers Stadium in November. In {{nfly|1979}}, Staubach's final season, the two defending conference champs met again at Three Rivers, the Steelers winning 14\u20133 en route to winning their [[Super Bowl XIV|fourth Super Bowl title]]. The Steelers won six of eight meetings during the 1970s and 80s, before the Cowboys won all four meetings during the 1990s, including the teams' record third Super Bowl meeting in [[Super Bowl XXX|1996]], as this time the heavily favored Cowboys beat the Steelers 27\u201317. Dallas cornerback [[Larry Brown (cornerback)|Larry Brown]] intercepted Pittsburgh quarterback [[Neil O'Donnell]] twice and was named the game's MVP. The teams' first two meetings of the 21st century ({{nfly|2004}} and {{nfly|2008}}) were won by the Steelers, including a come from behind victory December 7, 2008 in Pittsburgh, when the Steelers drove the length of the field to tie the game 13\u201313, then [[cornerback]] [[Deshea Townsend]] returned an intercepted pass from [[Tony Romo]] for the game's final score, Steelers 20, Cowboys 13. The Cowboys won on December 16, 2012, at Cowboys Stadium by a 27\u201324 margin in overtime and won 35-30 at [[Heinz Field]] on November 13, 2016. The all-time series is led by the Dallas Cowboys, 17\u201315. The Pittsburgh/Dallas rivalry served as a backdrop to the 1977 film ''[[Black Sunday (1977 film)|Black Sunday]]'', parts of which were filmed during Super Bowl X. The teams will next play in the regular season in Dallas in 2020.\n\n====Denver Broncos====\nThe [[Denver Broncos]] in 2011 broke a tie with the [[Oakland Raiders]] for the most playoff meetings versus the Steelers and added yet another meeting in 2015 (the Broncos have met Pittsburgh eight times to Oakland's six). The rivalry dates from {{Steelers season|1970}}, but the first notable contest came in {{Steelers season|1973}}, when Denver dealt Pittsburgh its first regular-season defeat at [[Three Rivers Stadium]], 23\u201313. The following year, they met in the NFL's first regular-season overtime game, which ended in a 35\u201335 tie. Denver's first playoff game had them hosting the Steelers in the 1977 divisional round; the Broncos won 34\u201321. The following year, the Steelers hosted and defeated Denver 33\u201310 in the divisional round. Their next playoff matchup was the 1984 divisional round in [[Mile High Stadium]]; the Steelers pulled the upset 24\u201317. They nearly pulled the upset again 5 years later in Denver, but the Broncos prevailed in the divisional playoff, 24\u201323.\n\nIn 1997, the two teams met in [[Pittsburgh]] for the [[AFC Championship Game]], where Denver squeaked out at 24\u201321 win. Eight years later, the Steelers advanced to [[Super Bowl XL]] by beating Denver 34\u201317 in Colorado. In 2011, after appearing in [[Super Bowl XLV]], the Steelers had their campaign to repeat as [[American Football Conference|AFC Champions]] dashed in Denver after a stunning overtime upset by the [[Tim Tebow]]-led Broncos in January 2012, in what would become known as the \"316 game\". The following September the Steelers were defeated in Denver 31\u201319 in [[Peyton Manning]]'s [[2012 Denver Broncos season|debut as Broncos quarterback]]. The two clubs met twice in [[2015 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2015]], as the Steelers defeated the Broncos in the regular season but fell in the Divisional Round of the AFC playoffs; Denver presently leads the series 20\u201311\u20131, including 5\u20133 in the playoffs. Neither team has beaten the other more than three times in a row. In their last matchup, the Broncos beat the Steelers on November 25, 2018 in Denver by the score of 24\u201317.\n\n====New England Patriots====\nThe [[New England Patriots]] emerged as a prominent rival in league circles when the Patriots upset the Steelers in the 2001 [[AFC Championship Game]] at [[Heinz Field]], though the two teams had met in the postseason twice before; the Patriots defeated the Steelers in [[1996 New England Patriots season|1996]] 28-3 while the Steelers won 7-6 in [[1997 Pittsburgh Steelers season|1997]]; both times, the Patriots fielded players with Pittsburgh-area roots in [[Ty Law]] and [[Curtis Martin]]. Martin's final game with the Patriots was in the 1997 playoffs before he departed to the rival [[1998 New York Jets season|New York Jets]]. Following the 2001 AFC title upset, the Patriots defeated the Steelers 30-14 at the start of the 2002 season. Pittsburgh did not exact revenge for the two losses until ending the Patriots' record-setting 21-game winning streak in week 6 of the [[2004 NFL season]]. Later that season, the Steelers lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Patriots in the AFC Championship game after a 15\u20131 regular season.\n\nThe Patriots won six of seven meetings over a ten-year period ({{nfly|1998}}\u2013{{nfly|2007}}) before the Steelers broke through with a 33\u201310 victory at [[Gillette Stadium|Foxborough]] in {{nfly|2008}}, after [[Matt Cassel]] turned the ball over five times. The Patriots in [[2013 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2013]] then made history by becoming the first opponent to score 55 points on the Steelers, winning 55\u201331. The Patriots won again in 2015 (28-21) and 2016's regular season (27-16), and then won 36-17 in the 2016 [[AFC Championship Game]]. They also won in 2017 when a go-ahead touchdown reception by Steelers' tight end [[Jesse James (tight end)|Jesse James]] was controversially called back.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/jesse-james-overturned-touchdown-latest-example-of-why-fans-hate-nfls-catch-rule/|title = Jesse James' overturned touchdown latest example of why fans hate NFL's catch rule|first = Ryan|last = Wilson|publisher = CBS Sports|date = December 18, 2017|accessdate = July 31, 2018}}</ref> Though they ultimately missed the playoffs, the Steelers defeated the Patriots by a score of 17\u201310 on December 16, 2018 in Pittsburgh.\n\nIn the postseason, the Patriots have outscored the Steelers 135\u201375, with the Patriots maintaining a 4\u20131 record. The only other franchises with winning AFC playoff records against Steelers include the [[Los Angeles Chargers]] (2\u20131), the [[2007 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jacksonville Jaguars]] (2\u20130), and the Broncos (5\u20133). The Steelers have an all-time regular-season record of 15\u201313 against the Patriots. In the [[Bill Belichick]] era, the main period of the rivalry, the Patriots have a 12\u20134 record against the Steelers. In their last matchup, the Patriots beat the Steelers 33\u20133 on [[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]].\n\n====Tennessee Titans====\nLess well known is Pittsburgh's [[Steelers\u2013Titans rivalry|rivalry]] with the [[Tennessee Titans|Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans]] franchise. The Oilers were aligned into the [[AFC Central]] with the Steelers in 1970 and were division rivals for 32 seasons. The Steelers dominated the rivalry during the Houston era and defeated the Oilers in all three of their playoff matchups. However, since the franchise moved to Tennessee in 1997, the rivalry shifted, with the Titans winning 13 of 22 meetings (including a bitter 34\u201331 playoff showdown in [[2002 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2002]]); the Titans won seven in a row in the 1997\u20132001 period, the longest win streak by either team in the series. The Steelers have won 46 of 78 career meetings following their 40\u201317 win at Heinz Field in 2017. The teams' next regular season match-up will take place in Tennessee in 2020.\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Mascot ===\n[[File:SteelyMcBeam.jpg|thumb|right|Steely McBeam signing autographs for fans at Steelers training camp on August 2, 2007]]\nPrior to the {{Steelers season|2007}} season, the Steelers introduced Steely McBeam as their official mascot.<ref name=\"CatchingUp\">{{cite news |first= Robert |last= Dvorchak|title= Catching up with their competitors, the Steelers christen a mascot|url= http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07221/808167-66.stm |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date= August 9, 2007|accessdate=April 27, 2008 }}</ref> As part of the 75th anniversary celebrations of the team, his name was selected from a pool of 70,000 suggestions submitted by fans of the team.<ref name=\"CatchingUp\" /> Diane Roles of [[Middlesex Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania|Middlesex Township]], submitted the winning name which was \"meant to represent steel for Pittsburgh's industrial heritage, \"Mc\" for the Rooney family's Irish roots, and Beam for the steel beams produced in Pittsburgh, as well as for [[Jim Beam]], her husband's favorite alcoholic beverage.\"<ref name=\"Name\">{{cite news |first= Maureen |last= Byko|title= Middlesex grandmother won Steelers 'Name the Mascot' contest|url= http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07231/810067-54.stm|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date= August 19, 2007 |accessdate=April 27, 2008 }}</ref> Steely McBeam is visible at all home games and participates in the team's charitable programs and other club-sponsored events.<ref name=\"CatchingUp\" /> Steely's autograph is known to be drawn with an oversized ''S'', and the ''L'' is drawn to look like a beam of steel.<ref name=\"CatchingUp\" />\n\n=== Fanbase ===\n{{Main|Steeler Nation}}\nThe Steelers have a tradition of having a large fanbase, which has spread from Pittsburgh.

In 1958, though they started splitting their home games at [[Pitt Stadium]] three blocks away at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. From 1964 to 1969, the Steelers played exclusively at the on campus facility before moving with the Pirates to [[Three Rivers Stadium]] on the city's [[Northside (Pittsburgh)|Northside]].

However, the Steelers lost to the [[1995 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] in Super Bowl XXX, two weeks after a thrilling [[1995 AFC Championship game|AFC Championship]] victory over the [[1995 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]]. Cowher produced the franchise's record-tying fifth Super Bowl win in [[Super Bowl XL]] over the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] champion [[2005 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] ten years later.

In recent seasons the Steelers have generally performed well, qualifying for the playoffs six times in the past ten seasons and winning the Super Bowl twice since {{Steelers season|2005}}.<ref name=\"FranchiseEncyclopedia\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/pit/|title=Pittsburgh Steelers Franchise Encyclopedia|publisher=[[Pro Football Reference]]|accessdate=April 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn the NFL's \"modern era\" (since the AFL\u2013NFL merger in 1970) the Steelers have posted the best record in the league.  The franchise has won the most regular season games, the most playoff games (33 playoff wins; the Dallas Cowboys are second with 32), won the most divisional titles (20), has played in the most conference championship games\n(15), hosted the most conference championship games (11), and is tied with the Dallas Cowboys, the Denver Broncos and the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl appearances (8). The Steelers have the best winning percentage (including every expansion team), earned the most All-Pro nominations, and have accumulated the most Super Bowl wins (6) since the modern game started in 1970. Since the merger, the team's playoff record is 33\u201319 (.635), which is second best in terms of playoff winning percentage behind the [[Green Bay Packers]]' playoff record of 28\u201316 (.636), through January 23, 2011. {{citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n=== Civil rights advocacy ===\nThe franchise, along with the Rooney family have for generations been strong advocates for equality of opportunity for both minorities and women.  Among these achievements of the Steelers was the first to hire an African-American assistant coach (September 29, 1957 with [[Lowell Perry]]), the first to start an African-American quarterback (December 3, 1973 with [[Joe Gilliam]]), the first team to boast of an African-American Super Bowl MVP (January 12, 1975 with [[Franco Harris]]), the first to hire an African-American Coordinator (September 2, 1984 with [[Tony Dungy]]), the first owner to push for passage of an \"equal opportunity\" mandating that at least one minority candidate is given an interview in all head coach hiring decisions throughout the league (the Rooney Rule in the early 2000s), and the first to hire a female as full-time athletic trainer ([[Ariko Iso]] on July 24, 2002).<br />{{small|Note: Although [[Marlin Briscoe]] is sometimes erroneously cited as the first African-American starting quarterback in 1968, this was not for an NFL team and not in an NFL game (the Denver Broncos, for which Briscoe played, were an American Football League team then), additionally the vast majority of Briscoe's career was not as quarterback.}}\n\n== Logo and uniforms ==\n<!--NOTE:This is a basic summary of the Steelers' logo and uniforms. If you wish to add information, please visit the Logos and uniforms of the Pittsburgh Steelers article.-->{{details|Logos and uniforms of the Pittsburgh Steelers}}\n[[File:US Airways Steelers.jpg|thumb|US Airways logo jet featuring the colors of the Pittsburgh Steelers]]\n[[File:Pittsburgh Steelers Script.svg|right|thumb|150px|The script logo.]]The Steelers have used black and gold as their colors since the club's inception, the lone exception being the 1943 season when they merged with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and formed the \"[[Steagles]]\"; the team's colors at that time were green and white as a result of wearing Eagles uniforms. Originally, the team wore solid gold-colored helmets and black jerseys. The Steelers' black and gold colors are now shared by all major professional teams in the city, including the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in baseball and the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] in ice hockey, and also the [[Pittsburgh Power]] of the re-formed [[Arena Football League]], and the [[Pittsburgh Passion]] of the [[Independent Women's Football League]]. The shade of gold differs slightly among teams: the Penguins have previously used \"Vegas Gold\", a color similar to metallic gold, and the Pirates' gold is a darker mustard yellow-gold, while the Steelers \"gold\" is more of a bright canary yellow.  Black and gold are also the colors of the [[Flag of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|city's official flag]].\n\nThe Steelers logo was introduced in 1962 and is based on the \"[[Steelmark]]\", originally designed by Pittsburgh's [[U.S. Steel]] and now owned by the [[American Iron and Steel Institute]] (AISI). In fact, it was [[Cleveland]]-based [[Republic Steel]] that suggested the Steelers adopt the industry logo. It consists of the word \"Steelers\" surrounded by three [[astroid]]s ([[hypocycloid]]s of four [[cusp (singularity)|cusps]]). The original meanings behind the astroids were, \"Steel lightens your work, brightens your leisure, and widens your world.\" Later, the colors came to represent the ingredients used in the steel-making process: yellow for coal, red for iron ore, and blue for scrap steel.<ref>{{cite web|title=What Is the Story Behind the Symbol on the Headgear of the Pittsburgh Steelers?|url=http://www.steel.org/Global/document-types/news/2011/what-is-the-story-behind-the-symbol-on-the-headgear-of-the-pittsburgh-steelers.aspx?siteLocation=17d77c91-adc3-4c5b-9158-056d31998ed9|publisher=[[American Iron and Steel Institute]]|date=February 2, 2011|accessdate=May 30, 2016}}</ref> While the formal Steelmark logo contains only the word \"Steel\", the team was given permission to add \"ers\" in 1963 after a petition to AISI.\n\nThe Steelers are the only NFL team that puts its logo on only one side of the helmet (the right side). Longtime field and equipment manager Jack Hart was instructed to do this by Art Rooney as a test to see how the logo appeared on the gold helmets; however, its popularity led the team to leave it that way permanently.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Steelers Logo|url=http://www.steelers.com/history/logo-history.html|publisher=Pittsburgh Steelers|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514184837/http://www.steelers.com/history/logo-history.html|archivedate=May 14, 2018|accessdate=May 18, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> A year after introducing the logo, they switched to black helmets to make it stand out more.\n\nThe Steelers, along with the [[New York Giants]], are one of only two teams in the [[National Football League]] to have the players' uniform numbers on both the front and back of the helmets.\n\nThe current uniform designs were introduced in {{Steelers season|1968}}. The design consists of gold pants and either black jerseys or white jerseys, except for the {{Steelers season|1970}} and {{Steelers season|1971}} seasons when the Steelers wore white pants with their white jerseys. In {{Steelers season|1997}}, the team switched to rounded numbers on the jersey to match the number font ([[Futura Condensed]]) on the helmets, and a Steelers logo was added to the left side of the jersey.\n\nThe 2007\u20132011 third uniform, consisting of a black jersey with gold lettering, white pants with black and gold stripes, and a gold helmet were first used during the Steelers' 75th anniversary season in {{Steelers season|2007}}. They were meant to evoke the memory of the {{Steelers season|1963}}\u2013{{Steelers season|1964}} era uniforms. The uniforms were so popular among fans that the Steelers' organization decided to keep them and use them as a third option during home games only.\n\nIn 2012, the Steelers introduced a new third uniform, consisting of a yellow jersey with black horizontal lines (making a bumble bee like pattern) with black lettering and black numbers placed inside a white box, to represent the jerseys worn by the Steelers in their [[1934 Pittsburgh Pirates (NFL) season|1934 season]]. The rest of the uniform consists of beige pants, yellow with black horizontal stripped socks, and the Steelers regular black helmet. The uniforms were used for the Steelers' 80th anniversary season. Much like the previous alternate these jerseys were so popular that they were used up through the 2016 season. The jerseys were nicknamed the \"bumblebee jerseys\" due to looking like the pattern of a bumble bee. The jerseys were retired after the 2016 season.\n\nIn 2018, the Steelers unveiled a third uniform based on those worn by the Steel Curtain teams of the 1970s. It is similar to the current uniforms but without the Steelers logo on the left chest and use block lettering and numbers in place of Futura Condensed.\n\nIn {{Steelers season|2008}}\u20132009, the Steelers became the first team in NFL history to defeat an opponent three times in a single season using three different uniforms.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} They defeated the Baltimore Ravens in Pittsburgh in Week 4 in their third jerseys, again Week 15 in Baltimore in their road whites, and a final time in the AFC Championship in Pittsburgh in their home black jerseys.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baltimoreravens.com/photos/looking-back-on-ravens-steelers-matchups-over-the-years-14123976?campaign=sf:fanshare:facebook|title=Looking Back On Ravens-Steelers Matchups Over The Years|website=www.baltimoreravens.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-26}}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, the team owners were approached by then-[[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa Hawkeyes]] Head Coach [[Hayden Fry]] about designing his fading college team's uniforms in the image of the Steelers. Three days later, the owners sent Fry the reproduction jerseys (home and away versions) of then quarterback [[Terry Bradshaw]]. Today, the Hawkeyes still retain the 1979 Steelers uniforms as their home, and away colors.\n\n== Rivals ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers have three primary rivals, all within their division: ([[Cleveland Browns]], [[Baltimore Ravens]], and [[Cincinnati Bengals]]). They also have rivalries with other teams that arose from post-season battles in the past, most notably the [[New England Patriots]], [[Oakland Raiders]], [[Tennessee Titans]] and [[Dallas Cowboys]]. They also have an intrastate [[Eagles\u2013Steelers rivalry|rivalry]] with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], but under the current scheduling the teams play each other only once every four years.\n\n=== Divisional rivals ===\n*The [[Browns\u2013Steelers rivalry|Cleveland Browns and the Steelers]] have been divisional rivals since the two cities' teams began playing against each other in 1950. After posting a 9\u201331 record in the first 40 games of the series between the two cities, the Steelers have gone 66\u201327\u20131 (including 42\u20136 in games played in Pittsburgh) since 1970 and currently lead the series 75\u201358\u20131; The Steelers have particularly dominated the Browns since their return to the NFL in 1999 and won twelve straight meetings between 2003 and 2009.  Additionally, the Browns posted losing streaks of 16 (1970\u201385) and 15 (2004\u2013present) games in Pittsburgh. Former Steelers head coach [[Bill Cowher]] coached the Browns special teams and secondary before following [[Marty Schottenheimer]] for a brief tenure as [[Kansas City Chiefs]] defensive coordinator, and then hired by Pittsburgh. This has only intensified the rivalry. The teams have met twice in the postseason (1994 and 2002) with the Steelers winning both meetings.\n*The [[Ravens\u2013Steelers rivalry|Baltimore Ravens and the Steelers]] have had several memorable match-ups and have a bitter divisional rivalry. Both teams handed the other their first losses at their current home fields. The Steelers won the inaugural game played at [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore's]] [[M&T Bank Stadium]] in {{nfly|1998}}, 20\u201313, and three years later the [[Baltimore Ravens|Ravens]] handed the Steelers their first-ever loss at [[Heinz Field]], 13\u201310. Later that season ({{nfly|2001}}) Pittsburgh won a [[2001\u201302 NFL playoffs#AFC: Pittsburgh Steelers 27, Baltimore Ravens 10|divisional playoff game]] 27\u201310 against Baltimore, who was the [[Super Bowl XXXV|defending Super Bowl champion]]. During their NFL championship season in [[2000 Baltimore Ravens season|2000]], the Ravens defeated the Steelers [[Three Rivers Stadium|in Pittsburgh]], 16\u20130, in the season opener with the Steelers later exacting revenge, 9\u20136, in Baltimore (the Ravens' final loss of the season). During the Steelers 2008 Championship run, they beat the Ravens three times, including a win in the AFC Championship game. The two teams complement each other by consistently fielding strong defenses. The Steelers lead the all-time series (including playoffs), 28\u201324.  The teams have met four times in the postseason, with the Steelers owning a 3\u20131 record.\n*The [[Bengals\u2013Steelers rivalry|Steelers' rivalry with the Cincinnati Bengals]] dates from the {{Steelers season|1970}} season, when the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]] was completed. In {{Steelers season|1976}}, the Steelers kept their playoff hopes alive (they later won the division) with a late-season 7\u20133 win in snowy Cincinnati. One of the most memorable games was the [[2005\u201306 NFL playoffs#AFC: Pittsburgh Steelers 31, Cincinnati Bengals 17|2005 AFC Wildcard playoff game]], in which the Steelers, en route to a [[Super Bowl XL|Super Bowl title]], won a 31\u201317 come-from-behind victory after [[Cincinnati Bengals|Bengals]] QB [[Carson Palmer]] was forced to leave the game with a knee injury. The injury happened when nose tackle [[Kimo von Oelhoffen]] contacted Palmer's knee during a passing play.  The Bengals players called this a dirty play; the NFL ruled that it was accidental and did not fine von Oelhoffen for the hit.  The incident led to an intensifying of the rivalry. The Bengals beat the Steelers in Week 13 of the {{Steelers season|2005}} season 38\u201331, and wide receiver [[T. J. Houshmandzadeh]] used a [[Terrible Towel]] to polish his cleats while walking up the tunnel after the game, fueling the rivalry. The Steelers and Bengals finished {{nfly|2005}} and {{nfly|2006}} with identical records (11\u20135 and 8\u20138 respectively), splitting both regular-season series, the Bengals winning the tiebreaker both years due to having a superior division record. The Steelers also are responsible for ending the Bengals' season in Cincinnati two years in a row, eliminating them from the playoffs in {{Steelers season|2005}} and taking them out of contention in {{Steelers season|2006}}. The rivalry has become more intense again since the {{Steelers season|2015}} season. A central figure is Bengals linebacker [[Vontaze Burfict]], often inflicting brutal hits, resulting in serious injuries to several Steelers on multiple occasions. In the 2015 Wild Card playoff game in Cincinnati, Burfict was the culprit of a late penalty directly responsible for an extremely unlikely 18-16 Steelers comeback victory. The Steelers lead the all-time series, 63\u201335.  The teams have met twice in the postseason, with the Steelers winning both times.\n\n=== Historic rivals ===\n====Oakland Raiders====\nThe [[Raiders\u2013Steelers rivalry]] was one of the most heated of the 1970s and early to mid-1980s. The Steelers' first playoff win was a 13\u20137 victory over the Raiders by way of [[Franco Harris]]'s [[Immaculate Reception]] on December 23, 1972. The wild card Pittsburgh football team was knocked out of the playoffs the following year by the Raiders in the 1973 AFC Divisional round 33\u201314, but fired back with two straight AFC Championships in {{nfly|1974}} 24\u201313 and {{nfly|1975}} 16\u201310 over Oakland. Oakland responded with a victory over Pittsburgh in the {{nfly|1976}} AFC Championship game 24\u20137 (the third consecutive AFC title game between the two teams), but not before [[Chuck Noll]] referred to Oakland's [[George Atkinson (safety)|George Atkinson]] as part of the NFL's \"criminal element\" after his alleged cheap-shot on [[Lynn Swann]] during a regular-season matchup. Atkinson and the Raiders later filed a [[defamation of character]] [[lawsuit]] against Noll, but lost. Following the 1983 regular season, the Los Angeles Raiders defeated the Steelers 38\u201310 in the AFC Divisional round which turned out to be the last NFL game for Steeler Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw who did not play due to injury.\n\nWhile the rivalry has dissipated over the years (mostly due to Oakland's decline after [[2002 Oakland Raiders season|2002]]), the teams have had notable games against each other including an upset Steelers victory towards the end of the {{Steelers season|2000}} season to prevent the Raiders from obtaining homefield advantage in the playoffs, and an upset Raiders victory in week 8 of the [[2006 NFL season]] (20\u201313), which helped cost the Steelers a playoff berth. In Week 13 of the 2009 season, another Raiders upset victory happened; the game lead changed five times on five touchdowns in the fourth quarter until Raiders QB [[Bruce Gradkowski]]'s third touchdown of the quarter won it with nine seconds to go. The 27\u201324 loss cost the Steelers another playoff run. The teams met at [[Heinz Field|Pittsburgh]] in {{Steelers season|2010}}, where the Steelers blew out the Raiders 35\u20133, and ended their 3-game winning streak; the game was further notable for a punch thrown by [[Richard Seymour]] of the Raiders against Steelers quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]]. The Raiders then hosted the Steelers in [[2012 Oakland Raiders season|2012]] and erased a 31\u201321 gap to win 34\u201331. The two clubs met again in [[2013 NFL season|2013]] and the Raiders won again, 21\u201318. In 2015, the Steelers defeated the Raiders 38\u201335 at Heinz Field. The Steelers trail the all-time series 16\u201313 (13\u201310 in regular season). In their most recent matchup, the Raiders defeated the Steelers 24\u201321 on December 9, 2018 in Oakland, which, ironically, would cost Pittsburgh another playoff berth.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2018/12/09/raiders-block-fg-to-finish-dramatic-upset-of-steelers-24-21/ | title=Raiders Block FG To Finish Dramatic Upset Of Steelers, 24-21 | publisher=CBS San Francisco | work=The Associated Press | date=9 December 2018 | accessdate=19 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Dallas Cowboys====\nThe [[Cowboys\u2013Steelers rivalry]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/dallas-cowboys/post/_/id/4755558/cowboys-steelers-rivalry-has-been-one-for-the-ages|title=Cowboys, Steelers rivalry has been one for the ages|newspaper=ESPN.com|access-date=January 20, 2017}}</ref> started with the Cowboys' first game as a franchise in {{nfly|1960}} (against the Steelers) at the [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|Cotton Bowl]] with the Steelers coming away with a 35\u201328 victory. These teams hold a record for the most times (three) that two teams have met in a [[Super Bowl]]. The first two times the favored Steelers and Cowboys met came with Pittsburgh victories in the Orange Bowl [[Super Bowl X]] 21\u201317 and [[Super Bowl XIII]] 35\u201331. The Cowboys never won a regular season game in the Orange Bowl and lost three Super Bowl games (once to the Baltimore Colts and twice to the Steelers). Between the Cowboys and Steelers, Super Bowl XIII had the greatest number of future Pro Football Hall of Fame players participating, which as of 2010 numbered 20&nbsp;\u2013 14 players and six coaches/front office, including [[Ernie Stautner]], [[defensive coordinator]] for the Cowboys who was a HoF [[defensive tackle]] for the Steelers. The teams featured an all-star matchup at quarterback between the Steelers' [[Terry Bradshaw]] and the Cowboys' [[Roger Staubach]], both of whom are in the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]]. In {{nfly|1977}}, Staubach and the Cowboys won [[Super Bowl XII]], their second and last loss of their season being inflicted by Bradshaw and the Steelers, 28\u201313 at Three Rivers Stadium in November. In {{nfly|1979}}, Staubach's final season, the two defending conference champs met again at Three Rivers, the Steelers winning 14\u20133 en route to winning their [[Super Bowl XIV|fourth Super Bowl title]]. The Steelers won six of eight meetings during the 1970s and 80s, before the Cowboys won all four meetings during the 1990s, including the teams' record third Super Bowl meeting in [[Super Bowl XXX|1996]], as this time the heavily favored Cowboys beat the Steelers 27\u201317. Dallas cornerback [[Larry Brown (cornerback)|Larry Brown]] intercepted Pittsburgh quarterback [[Neil O'Donnell]] twice and was named the game's MVP. The teams' first two meetings of the 21st century ({{nfly|2004}} and {{nfly|2008}}) were won by the Steelers, including a come from behind victory December 7, 2008 in Pittsburgh, when the Steelers drove the length of the field to tie the game 13\u201313, then [[cornerback]] [[Deshea Townsend]] returned an intercepted pass from [[Tony Romo]] for the game's final score, Steelers 20, Cowboys 13. The Cowboys won on December 16, 2012, at Cowboys Stadium by a 27\u201324 margin in overtime and won 35-30 at [[Heinz Field]] on November 13, 2016. The all-time series is led by the Dallas Cowboys, 17\u201315. The Pittsburgh/Dallas rivalry served as a backdrop to the 1977 film ''[[Black Sunday (1977 film)|Black Sunday]]'', parts of which were filmed during Super Bowl X. The teams will next play in the regular season in Dallas in 2020.\n\n====Denver Broncos====\nThe [[Denver Broncos]] in 2011 broke a tie with the [[Oakland Raiders]] for the most playoff meetings versus the Steelers and added yet another meeting in 2015 (the Broncos have met Pittsburgh eight times to Oakland's six). The rivalry dates from {{Steelers season|1970}}, but the first notable contest came in {{Steelers season|1973}}, when Denver dealt Pittsburgh its first regular-season defeat at [[Three Rivers Stadium]], 23\u201313. The following year, they met in the NFL's first regular-season overtime game, which ended in a 35\u201335 tie. Denver's first playoff game had them hosting the Steelers in the 1977 divisional round; the Broncos won 34\u201321. The following year, the Steelers hosted and defeated Denver 33\u201310 in the divisional round. Their next playoff matchup was the 1984 divisional round in [[Mile High Stadium]]; the Steelers pulled the upset 24\u201317. They nearly pulled the upset again 5 years later in Denver, but the Broncos prevailed in the divisional playoff, 24\u201323.\n\nIn 1997, the two teams met in [[Pittsburgh]] for the [[AFC Championship Game]], where Denver squeaked out at 24\u201321 win. Eight years later, the Steelers advanced to [[Super Bowl XL]] by beating Denver 34\u201317 in Colorado. In 2011, after appearing in [[Super Bowl XLV]], the Steelers had their campaign to repeat as [[American Football Conference|AFC Champions]] dashed in Denver after a stunning overtime upset by the [[Tim Tebow]]-led Broncos in January 2012, in what would become known as the \"316 game\". The following September the Steelers were defeated in Denver 31\u201319 in [[Peyton Manning]]'s [[2012 Denver Broncos season|debut as Broncos quarterback]]. The two clubs met twice in [[2015 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2015]], as the Steelers defeated the Broncos in the regular season but fell in the Divisional Round of the AFC playoffs; Denver presently leads the series 20\u201311\u20131, including 5\u20133 in the playoffs. Neither team has beaten the other more than three times in a row. In their last matchup, the Broncos beat the Steelers on November 25, 2018 in Denver by the score of 24\u201317.\n\n====New England Patriots====\nThe [[New England Patriots]] emerged as a prominent rival in league circles when the Patriots upset the Steelers in the 2001 [[AFC Championship Game]] at [[Heinz Field]], though the two teams had met in the postseason twice before; the Patriots defeated the Steelers in [[1996 New England Patriots season|1996]] 28-3 while the Steelers won 7-6 in [[1997 Pittsburgh Steelers season|1997]]; both times, the Patriots fielded players with Pittsburgh-area roots in [[Ty Law]] and [[Curtis Martin]]. Martin's final game with the Patriots was in the 1997 playoffs before he departed to the rival [[1998 New York Jets season|New York Jets]]. Following the 2001 AFC title upset, the Patriots defeated the Steelers 30-14 at the start of the 2002 season. Pittsburgh did not exact revenge for the two losses until ending the Patriots' record-setting 21-game winning streak in week 6 of the [[2004 NFL season]]. Later that season, the Steelers lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Patriots in the AFC Championship game after a 15\u20131 regular season.\n\nThe Patriots won six of seven meetings over a ten-year period ({{nfly|1998}}\u2013{{nfly|2007}}) before the Steelers broke through with a 33\u201310 victory at [[Gillette Stadium|Foxborough]] in {{nfly|2008}}, after [[Matt Cassel]] turned the ball over five times. The Patriots in [[2013 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2013]] then made history by becoming the first opponent to score 55 points on the Steelers, winning 55\u201331. The Patriots won again in 2015 (28-21) and 2016's regular season (27-16), and then won 36-17 in the 2016 [[AFC Championship Game]]. They also won in 2017 when a go-ahead touchdown reception by Steelers' tight end [[Jesse James (tight end)|Jesse James]] was controversially called back.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/jesse-james-overturned-touchdown-latest-example-of-why-fans-hate-nfls-catch-rule/|title = Jesse James' overturned touchdown latest example of why fans hate NFL's catch rule|first = Ryan|last = Wilson|publisher = CBS Sports|date = December 18, 2017|accessdate = July 31, 2018}}</ref> Though they ultimately missed the playoffs, the Steelers defeated the Patriots by a score of 17\u201310 on December 16, 2018 in Pittsburgh.\n\nIn the postseason, the Patriots have outscored the Steelers 135\u201375, with the Patriots maintaining a 4\u20131 record. The only other franchises with winning AFC playoff records against Steelers include the [[Los Angeles Chargers]] (2\u20131), the [[2007 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jacksonville Jaguars]] (2\u20130), and the Broncos (5\u20133). The Steelers have an all-time regular-season record of 15\u201313 against the Patriots. In the [[Bill Belichick]] era, the main period of the rivalry, the Patriots have a 12\u20134 record against the Steelers. In their last matchup, the Patriots beat the Steelers 33\u20133 on [[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]].\n\n====Tennessee Titans====\nLess well known is Pittsburgh's [[Steelers\u2013Titans rivalry|rivalry]] with the [[Tennessee Titans|Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans]] franchise. The Oilers were aligned into the [[AFC Central]] with the Steelers in 1970 and were division rivals for 32 seasons. The Steelers dominated the rivalry during the Houston era and defeated the Oilers in all three of their playoff matchups. However, since the franchise moved to Tennessee in 1997, the rivalry shifted, with the Titans winning 13 of 22 meetings (including a bitter 34\u201331 playoff showdown in [[2002 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2002]]); the Titans won seven in a row in the 1997\u20132001 period, the longest win streak by either team in the series. The Steelers have won 46 of 78 career meetings following their 40\u201317 win at Heinz Field in 2017. The teams' next regular season match-up will take place in Tennessee in 2020.\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Mascot ===\n[[File:SteelyMcBeam.jpg|thumb|right|Steely McBeam signing autographs for fans at Steelers training camp on August 2, 2007]]\nPrior to the {{Steelers season|2007}} season, the Steelers introduced Steely McBeam as their official mascot.<ref name=\"CatchingUp\">{{cite news |first= Robert |last= Dvorchak|title= Catching up with their competitors, the Steelers christen a mascot|url= http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07221/808167-66.stm |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date= August 9, 2007|accessdate=April 27, 2008 }}</ref> As part of the 75th anniversary celebrations of the team, his name was selected from a pool of 70,000 suggestions submitted by fans of the team.<ref name=\"CatchingUp\" /> Diane Roles of [[Middlesex Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania|Middlesex Township]], submitted the winning name which was \"meant to represent steel for Pittsburgh's industrial heritage, \"Mc\" for the Rooney family's Irish roots, and Beam for the steel beams produced in Pittsburgh, as well as for [[Jim Beam]], her husband's favorite alcoholic beverage.\"<ref name=\"Name\">{{cite news |first= Maureen |last= Byko|title= Middlesex grandmother won Steelers 'Name the Mascot' contest|url= http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07231/810067-54.stm|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date= August 19, 2007 |accessdate=April 27, 2008 }}</ref> Steely McBeam is visible at all home games and participates in the team's charitable programs and other club-sponsored events.<ref name=\"CatchingUp\" /> Steely's autograph is known to be drawn with an oversized ''S'', and the ''L'' is drawn to look like a beam of steel.<ref name=\"CatchingUp\" />\n\n=== Fanbase ===\n{{Main|Steeler Nation}}\nThe Steelers have a tradition of having a large fanbase, which has spread from Pittsburgh.

In 1958, though they started splitting their home games at [[Pitt Stadium]] three blocks away at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. From 1964 to 1969, the Steelers played exclusively at the on campus facility before moving with the Pirates to [[Three Rivers Stadium]] on the city's [[Northside (Pittsburgh)|Northside]]. Three Rivers is remembered fondly by the Steeler Nation as where Chuck Noll and Dan Rooney turned the franchise into a powerhouse, winning four Super Bowls in just six seasons and making the playoffs 11 times in 13 seasons from 1972 to 1984, the AFC title game seven times.

The resulting partial differential equation is solved for the wave function, which contains information about the system.\n\n==={{anchor|Time independent equation}}Time-independent equation===\nThe time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation described above predicts that wave functions can form [[standing wave]]s, called [[stationary state]]s.<ref group=\"note\">In chemistry, stationary states are atomic and molecular orbitals.</ref> These states are particularly important as their individual study later simplifies the task of solving the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation for ''any'' state. Stationary states can also be described by a simpler form of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, the ''time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation'' (TISE).\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent=:\n|title='''Time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation''' (''general'')\n|equation=<math>\\operatorname{\\hat H}|\\Psi\\rangle = E |\\Psi\\rangle </math>\n|cellpadding\n|border\n|border colour = rgb(80,200,120)\n|background colour = rgb(80,200,120,10%)}}\n\nwhere <math>E</math> is a constant equal to the energy level of the system. This is only used when the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] itself is not dependent on time explicitly. However, even in this case the total wave function still has a time dependency.\n\nIn the language of [[linear algebra]], this equation is an [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalue equation]]. Therefore, the wave function is an [[eigenfunction]] of the Hamiltonian operator with corresponding eigenvalue(s) <math>E</math>.\n\nAs before, the most common manifestation is the [[relativistic quantum mechanics|nonrelativistic]] Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a single particle moving in an electric field (but not a magnetic field):\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent=:\n|title='''Time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation''' (''single nonrelativistic particle'')\n|equation=<math>\\left[ \\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2 + V(\\mathbf{r}) \\right] \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}) = E \\Psi(\\mathbf{r})</math>\n|cellpadding\n|border\n|border colour = rgb(0,115,207)\n|background colour = rgb(0,115,207,10%)}}\n\nwith definitions as above. Here, the form of the Hamiltonian operator comes from classical mechanics, where the Hamiltonian ''function'' is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies. That is, <math>H = T + V = \\frac{\\|\\mathbf{p}\\|^2}{2m} + V(x, y, z)</math> for a single particle in the non-relativistic limit.\n\nThe time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation is discussed further below.\n\n==Derivation==\nOne may derive the Schr\u00f6dinger equation starting from the [[Dirac-von Neumann axioms]]. Suppose the [[wave function]] <math>\\psi(t_0)</math> represents a unit vector defined on a complex [[Hilbert space]] at some initial time <math>t_0</math>. The [[Unitarity (physics)|unitarity principle]] requires that there must exist a linear operator, <math>\\hat{U}(t)</math>, such that for any time <math>t > t_0</math>,\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\psi(t) = \\hat{U}(t)\\psi(t_0).</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\nGiven that <math>\\psi(t)</math> must remain a unit vector, the operator <math>\\hat{U}(t)</math> must therefore be a [[Unitary transformation (quantum mechanics)|unitary transformation]]. As such, there exists an [[Exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] such that <math>\\hat{U}(t) = e^{-i\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}t}</math> where <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> is a [[Hermitian operator]] (given by the fact that the [[Lie algebra]] of the [[unitary group]] is generated by skew-[[Hermitian operators]], and if <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> is Hermitian, then <math>-i \\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> is skew-Hermitian). Therefore, the first-order Taylor expansion of <math>\\hat{U}(t)</math> centered at <math>t_0</math> takes the form\n:<math>\\hat{U}(t) \\approx 1 - i(t-t_0)\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}.</math>\n\nAnd so, substituting the above expansion into ({{EquationNote|1}}) thus yields\n:<math>\\psi(t) = \\psi(t_0) - i(t-t_0)\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}\\psi(t_0),</math>\n\nwhich, when rearranged and taken in the limit <math>t \\rightarrow t_0</math>, provides an equation of the same form as the Schr&ouml;dinger equation\n:<math>i\\frac{d\\psi}{dt} = \\hat{\\mathcal{H}}\\psi,</math>\n\nwhere the ordinary definition for the derivative was used. However, the operator <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> used here denotes an ''arbitrary'' Hermitian operator. Nonetheless, by using the [[correspondence principle]] it is possible to show that in the classical limit, using appropriate units, the expectation value of <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> indeed corresponds to the Hamiltonian of the system.<ref>{{cite book|title=Modern Quantum Mechanics|last1=Sakurai|first1=J. J.|date=1995|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Massachusetts|page=68}}</ref>\n\n==Implications==\n===Energy===\nThe Hamiltonian is constructed in the same manner as in classical mechanics. However, in classical mechanics, the Hamiltonian is a scalar-valued function, whereas in quantum mechanics, it is an operator on a space of functions. It is not surprising that the [[eigenvalues]] of <math>\\hat{H}</math> are the energy levels of the system.\n\n===Quantization===\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation predicts that if certain properties of a system are measured, the result may be ''quantized'', meaning that only specific discrete values can occur. One example is ''energy quantization'': the energy of an electron in an atom is always one of the [[Energy level|quantized energy levels]], a fact discovered via [[atomic spectroscopy]]. (Energy quantization is discussed [[#Time-independent|below]].) Another example is [[angular momentum operator|quantization of angular momentum]]. This was an ''assumption'' in the earlier [[Bohr model|Bohr model of the atom]], but it is a ''prediction'' of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\n\nAnother result of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is that not every measurement gives a quantized result in quantum mechanics. For example, position, momentum, time, and (in some situations) energy can have any value across a continuous range.<ref name=\"Zettili2009\">{{cite book|author=Nouredine Zettili|title=Quantum Mechanics: Concepts and Applications|date=17 February 2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-02678-6}}</ref>{{rp|165\u2013167}}\n\n===Quantum tunneling===\n{{main|Quantum tunneling}}\n[[File:TunnelEffektKling1.png|width = 300px|thumb|[[Quantum tunneling]] through a barrier. A particle coming from the left does not have enough energy to climb the barrier. However, it can sometimes \"tunnel\" to the other side. ]]\n\nIn classical physics, when a ball is rolled slowly up a large hill, it will come to a stop and roll back, because it doesn't have enough energy to get over the top of the hill to the other side. However, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation predicts that there is a small probability that the ball will get to the other side of the hill, even if it has too little energy to reach the top. This is called [[quantum tunneling]]. It is related to the distribution of energy: although the ball's assumed position seems to be on one side of the hill, there is a chance of finding it on the other side.\n\n===Particles as waves===\n{{main|Matter wave|Wave\u2013particle duality|Double-slit experiment}}\n\n[[File:Double-slit experiment results Tanamura 2.jpg|175px|thumb|A double slit experiment showing the accumulation of electrons on a screen as time passes.]]\n\nThe nonrelativistic Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a type of [[partial differential equation]] called a [[wave equation]]. Therefore, it is often said particles can exhibit behavior usually attributed to waves. In some modern interpretations this description is reversed \u2013 the quantum state, i.e. wave, is the only genuine physical reality, and under the appropriate conditions it can show features of particle-like behavior. However, Ballentine<ref name=Ballentine>{{citation|last=Ballentine|first=Leslie|title=Quantum Mechanics: A Modern Development | publisher=World Scientific Publishing Co.|year=1998| isbn = 978-9810241056}}</ref>{{rp|Chapter 4, p.99}} shows that such an interpretation has problems. Ballentine points out that whilst it is arguable to associate a physical wave with a single particle, there is still only ''one'' Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation for many particles. He points out:\n:''\"If a physical wave field were associated with a particle, or if a particle were identified with a wave packet, then corresponding to N interacting particles there should be N interacting waves in ordinary three-dimensional space. But according to (4.6) that is not the case; instead there is one \"wave\" function in an abstract 3N-dimensional configuration space. The misinterpretation of psi as a physical wave in ordinary space is possible only because the most common applications of quantum mechanics are to one-particle states, for which configuration space and ordinary space are isomorphic.\"''\n\n[[Double-slit experiment|Two-slit diffraction]] is a famous example of the strange behaviors that waves regularly display, that are not intuitively associated with particles. The overlapping waves from the two slits cancel each other out in some locations, and reinforce each other in other locations, causing a complex pattern to emerge. Intuitively, one would not expect this pattern from firing a single particle at the slits, because the particle should pass through one slit or the other, not a complex overlap of both.\n\nHowever, since the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a [[wave equation]], a single particle fired through a double-slit ''does'' show this same pattern (figure on right). The experiment must be repeated many times for the complex pattern to emerge. Although this is counterintuitive, the prediction is correct; in particular, [[electron diffraction]] and [[neutron diffraction]] are well understood and widely used in science and engineering.\n\nRelated to [[diffraction]], particles also display [[Superposition principle#Application to waves|superposition]] and [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]].\n\nThe superposition property allows the particle to be in a [[quantum superposition]] of two or more quantum states at the same time. However, a \"quantum state\" in quantum mechanics means the ''probability'' that a system will be, for example at a position {{math|''x''}}, not that the system will actually be at position {{math|''x''}}. It does not imply that the particle itself may be in two classical states at once. Indeed, quantum mechanics is generally unable to assign values for properties prior to measurement at all.\n\n====Measurement and uncertainty====\n{{main|Measurement in quantum mechanics|Heisenberg uncertainty principle|Interpretations of quantum mechanics}}\nIn classical mechanics, a particle has, at every moment, an exact position and an exact momentum. These values change [[determinism|deterministically]] as the particle moves according to [[Newton's laws]]. Under the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, particles do not have exactly determined properties, and when they are measured, the result is randomly drawn from a [[probability distribution]]. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation predicts what the probability distributions are, but fundamentally cannot predict the exact result of each measurement.\n\nThe [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] is one statement of the inherent measurement uncertainty in quantum mechanics. It states that the more precisely a particle's position is known, the less precisely its momentum is known, and vice versa.\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation describes the (deterministic) evolution of the [[wave function]] of a particle. However, even if the wave function is known exactly, the result of a specific measurement on the wave function is uncertain.\n\n==Interpretation of the wave function==\n{{main|Interpretations of quantum mechanics}}\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation provides a way to calculate the wave function of a system and how it changes dynamically in time. However, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation does not directly say ''what'', exactly, the wave function is. [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics]] address questions such as what the relation is between the wave function, the underlying reality, and the results of experimental measurements.\n\nAn important aspect is the relationship between the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and [[wave function collapse]]. In the oldest [[Copenhagen interpretation]], particles follow the Schr\u00f6dinger equation ''except'' during wave function collapse, during which they behave entirely differently. The advent of [[quantum decoherence|quantum decoherence theory]] allowed alternative approaches (such as the [[Everett many-worlds interpretation]] and [[consistent histories]]), wherein the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is ''always'' satisfied, and wave function collapse should be explained as a consequence of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\n\nIn 1952, [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] gave a lecture during which he commented,\n:Nearly every result [a quantum theorist] pronounces is about the probability of this ''or'' that or that ... happening\u2014with usually a great many alternatives. The idea that they be not alternatives but ''all'' really happen simultaneously seems lunatic to him, just ''impossible.''<ref>{{cite book|last=Schr\u00f6dinger |first=Erwin |authorlink=Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger|title=The interpretation of quantum mechanics: Dublin seminars (1949\u20131955) and other unpublished essays |year=1995 |publisher=Ox Bow Press |isbn=9781881987086}}</ref>\n\n[[David Deutsch]] regarded this as the earliest known reference to a many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, an interpretation generally credited to [[Hugh Everett III]],<ref>David Deutsch, ''The Beginning of Infinity'', page 310</ref> while [[Jeffrey A.

Since energy and [[momentum]] are related in the same way as [[frequency]] and [[wavenumber|wave number]] in [[special relativity]], it followed that the momentum <math>p</math> of a photon is inversely proportional to its [[wavelength]] <math>\\lambda</math>, or proportional to its wave number <math>k</math>:\n\n:<math>p = \\frac{h}{\\lambda} = \\hbar k,</math>\n\nwhere <math>h</math> is [[Planck's constant]] and <math>\\hbar = {h}/{2\\pi}</math> is the reduced Planck constant (or the Dirac constant). [[Louis de Broglie]] hypothesized that this is true for all particles, even particles which have mass such as electrons. He showed that, assuming that the matter waves propagate along with their particle counterparts, electrons form [[standing wave]]s, meaning that only certain discrete rotational frequencies about the nucleus of an atom are allowed.<ref>\n{{Cite journal\n |last        = de Broglie\n |first       = L.\n |year        = 1925\n |title       = Recherches sur la th\u00e9orie des quanta\n |trans-title = On the Theory of Quanta\n |url         = http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/04/70/78/PDF/tel-00006807.pdf\n |journal     = [[Annales de Physique]]\n |volume      = 10\n |issue       = 3\n |pages       = 22\u2013128\n |doi         = 10.1051/anphys/192510030022\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090509012910/http://www.ensmp.fr/aflb/LDB-oeuvres/De_Broglie_Kracklauer.pdf\n |archivedate = 9 May 2009\n |df          = dmy-all\n|bibcode       = 1925AnPh...10...22D\n }} .</ref>\nThese quantized orbits correspond to discrete [[energy level]]s, and de Broglie reproduced the [[Bohr model]] formula for the energy levels.

Solving the equation for {{math|''\u03c8''}} can be used to predict how the particles will behave under the influence of the specified potential and with each other.\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation was developed principally from the [[De Broglie hypothesis]], a wave equation that would describe particles,<ref name=\"Quanta 1974\">''Quanta: A handbook of concepts'', P. W. Atkins, Oxford University Press, 1974, {{isbn|0-19-855493-1}}</ref> and can be constructed as shown informally in the following sections.<ref name=\"Molecules, B.H.

However, there can be [[interactions#Physics|interactions]] between the particles (an [[many body problem|{{math|''N''}}-body problem]]), so the potential energy {{math|''V''}} can change as the spatial configuration of particles changes, and possibly with time. The potential energy, in general, is ''not'' the sum of the separate potential energies for each particle, it is a function of all the spatial positions of the particles. Explicitly:\n\n:<math>E=\\sum_{n=1}^N \\frac{\\mathbf{p}_n\\cdot\\mathbf{p}_n}{2m_n} + V(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2,\\ldots,\\mathbf{r}_N,t) = H \\,\\!</math>\n\n=== Linearity ===\nThe simplest wave function is a [[plane wave]] of the form:\n\n:<math> \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t) = A e^{i(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-\\omega t)}</math>\n\nwhere the {{math|''A''}} is the amplitude, {{math|'''k'''}} the wave vector, and <math>\\omega</math> the angular frequency, of the plane wave. In general, physical situations are not purely described by plane waves, so for generality the [[superposition principle]] is required; any wave can be made by superposition of sinusoidal plane waves. So if the equation is linear, a [[linear combination]] of plane waves is also an allowed solution. Hence a necessary and separate requirement is that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a [[linear differential equation]].\n\nFor discrete <math>\\mathbf{k}</math> the sum is a [[superposition principle#Application to waves|superposition]] of plane waves:\n\n:<math> \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty A_n e^{i(\\mathbf{k}_n\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-\\omega_n t)} \\,\\!</math>\n\nfor some real amplitude coefficients <math>A_n</math>, and for continuous <math>\\mathbf{k}</math> the sum becomes an integral, the [[Fourier transform]] of a momentum space wave function:<ref name=\"Quantum Mechanics Demystified 2006\">''Quantum Mechanics Demystified'', D.

The momentum wave function <math>\\Phi (\\mathbf{k})</math> arises in the integrand since the position and momentum space wave functions are Fourier transforms of each other.\n\n=== Consistency with the de Broglie relations ===\n[[File:Wavefunction values.svg|300px|thumb|Diagrammatic summary of the quantities related to the wave function, as used in De broglie's hypothesis and development of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.<ref name=\"Quanta 1974\"/>]]\n\n[[Photoelectric effect|Einstein's light quanta hypothesis]] (1905) states that the energy {{math|''E''}} of a quantum of light or photon is proportional to its [[frequency]] <math>\\nu</math> (or [[angular frequency]], <math>\\omega = 2\\pi \\nu</math>)\n:<math>E = h\\nu = \\hbar \\omega \\,\\!</math>\nLikewise [[Matter wave|De Broglie's hypothesis]] (1924) states that any particle can be associated with a wave, and that the momentum <math>p</math> of the particle is inversely proportional to the [[wavelength]] <math>\\lambda</math> of such a wave (or proportional to the [[wavenumber]], <math>k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}</math>), in one dimension, by:\n:<math>p = \\frac{h}{\\lambda} =  \\hbar k\\;,</math>\nwhile in three dimensions, wavelength {{math|''\u03bb''}} is related to the magnitude of the [[wavevector]] {{math|'''k'''}}:\n:<math>\\mathbf{p} = \\hbar \\mathbf{k}\\,,\\quad |\\mathbf{k}| = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} \\,. </math>\n\nThe Planck\u2013Einstein and de Broglie relations illuminate the deep connections between energy with time, and space with momentum, and express [[wave\u2013particle duality]]. In practice, [[natural units]] comprising <math>\\hbar = 1</math> are used, as the De Broglie ''equations'' reduce to ''identities'': allowing momentum, wave number, energy and frequency to be used interchangeably, to prevent duplication of quantities, and reduce the number of dimensions of related quantities. For familiarity SI units are still used in this article.\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger's insight,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} late in 1925, was to express the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of a [[plane wave]] as a [[complex number|complex]] [[phase factor]] using these relations:\n\n:<math>\\Psi = Ae^{i(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-\\omega t)} = Ae^{i(\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-Et)/\\hbar} </math>\n\nand to realize that the first order [[partial derivatives]] with respect to space were\n\n:<math> \\nabla\\Psi = \\dfrac{i}{\\hbar}\\mathbf{p}Ae^{i(\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-Et)/\\hbar} = \\dfrac{i}{\\hbar}\\mathbf{p}\\Psi. </math>\n\nTaking partial derivatives with respect to time gives\n\n:<math> \\dfrac{\\partial \\Psi}{\\partial t} = -\\dfrac{i E}{\\hbar} Ae^{i(\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-Et)/\\hbar} = -\\dfrac{i E}{\\hbar} \\Psi. </math>\n\nAnother postulate of quantum mechanics is that all observables are represented by [[linear operator|linear]] [[Self-adjoint operator|Hermitian operators]] which act on the wave function, and the eigenvalues of the operator are the values the observable takes. The previous derivatives are consistent with the [[energy operator]] (or Hamiltonian operator), corresponding to the time derivative,\n\n:<math>\\hat{E} \\Psi = i\\hbar\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\Psi = E\\Psi  </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''E''}} are the energy [[eigenvalue]]s, and the [[momentum operator]], corresponding to the spatial derivatives (the [[del|gradient]] <math>\\nabla </math>),\n\n:<math>\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} \\Psi = -i\\hbar\\nabla \\Psi = \\mathbf{p} \\Psi </math>\n\nwhere {{math|'''p'''}} is a vector of the momentum eigenvalues. In the above, the \"[[circumflex|hats]]\" ( {{math|\u02c6}} ) indicate these observables are operators, not simply ordinary numbers or vectors. The energy and momentum operators are ''[[differential operators]]'', while the potential energy operator <math>V</math> is just a multiplicative factor.\n\nSubstituting the energy and momentum operators into the classical energy conservation equation obtains the operator:\n\n:<math>E= \\dfrac{\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{p}}{2m}+V \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\hat{E} = \\dfrac{\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}}{2m}  + V </math>\n\nso in terms of derivatives with respect to time and space, acting this operator on the wave function {{math|''\u03a8''}} immediately led Schr\u00f6dinger to his equation:{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n:<math>i\\hbar\\dfrac{\\partial \\Psi}{\\partial t}= -\\dfrac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2\\Psi +V\\Psi</math>\n\nWave\u2013particle duality can be assessed from these equations as follows. The kinetic energy {{math|''T''}} is related to the square of momentum {{math|'''p'''}}. As the particle's momentum increases, the kinetic energy increases more rapidly, but since the wave number {{math|{{!}}'''k'''{{!}}}} increases the wavelength {{math|''\u03bb''}} decreases. In terms of ordinary scalar and vector quantities (not operators):\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{p} \\propto \\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{k} \\propto T \\propto \\dfrac{1}{\\lambda^2}</math>\n\nThe kinetic energy is also proportional to the second spatial derivatives, so it is also proportional to the magnitude of the ''[[curvature]]'' of the wave, in terms of operators:\n\n:<math> \\hat{T} \\Psi = \\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla\\cdot\\nabla  \\Psi \\, \\propto \\, \\nabla^2 \\Psi \\,.</math>\n\nAs the curvature increases, the amplitude of the wave alternates between positive and negative more rapidly, and also shortens the wavelength. So the inverse relation between momentum and wavelength is consistent with the energy the particle has, and so the energy of the particle has a connection to a wave, all in the same mathematical formulation.<ref name=\"Quanta 1974\"/>\n\n===Wave and particle motion===\n {{multiple image\n   | align = right\n   | direction = horizontal\n   | image1    = Quantum mechanics travelling wavefunctions.svg\n   | caption1  = Increasing levels of [[wavepacket]] localization, meaning the particle has a more localized position.\n   | width1     = 400\n   | image2    = Perfect localization.svg\n   | caption2  = In the limit ''\u0127'' \u2192 0, the particle's position and momentum become known exactly.

Since, for a given spread in {{math|'''k'''}}, the spread in velocity is proportional to Planck's constant <math>\\hbar</math>, it is sometimes said that in the limit as <math>\\hbar</math> approaches zero, the equations of classical mechanics are restored from quantum mechanics.<ref name=\"Analytical Mechanics 2008\">''Analytical Mechanics'', L.

Using the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] for position and momentum, the products of uncertainty in position and momentum become zero as <math>\\hbar \\longrightarrow 0</math>:\n\n:<math> \\sigma(x) \\sigma(p_x) \\geqslant \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\sigma(x) \\sigma(p_x) \\geqslant 0 \\,\\!</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03c3''}} denotes the (root mean square) [[measurement uncertainty]] in {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''p<sub>x</sub>''}} (and similarly for the {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''z''}} directions) which implies the position and momentum can only be known to arbitrary precision in this limit.\n\nOne simple way to compare classical to quantum mechanics is to consider the time-evolution of the ''expected'' position and ''expected'' momentum, which can then be compared to the time-evolution of the ordinary position and momentum in classical mechanics. The quantum expectation values satisfy the [[Ehrenfest theorem]]. For a one-dimensional quantum particle moving in a potential <math>V</math>, the Ehrenfest theorem says<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Section 3.7.5</ref>\n:<math>m\\frac{d}{dt}\\langle x\\rangle = \\langle p\\rangle;\\quad \\frac{d}{dt}\\langle p\\rangle =  -\\left\\langle V'(X)\\right\\rangle .</math>\nAlthough the first of these equations is consistent with the classical behavior, the second is not: If the pair <math>(\\langle X\\rangle,\\langle P\\rangle)</math> were to satisfy Newton's second law, the right-hand side of the second equation would have to be\n:<math>-V'\\left(\\left\\langle X\\right\\rangle\\right)</math>,\nwhich is typically not the same as <math>-\\left\\langle V'(X)\\right\\rangle</math>. In the case of the quantum harmonic oscillator, however, <math>V'</math> is linear and this distinction disappears, so that in this very special case, the expected position and expected momentum do exactly follow the classical trajectories.\n\nFor general systems, the best we can hope for is that the expected position and momentum will ''approximately'' follow the classical trajectories. If the wave function is highly concentrated around a point <math>x_0</math>, then <math>V'\\left(\\left\\langle X\\right\\rangle\\right)</math> and <math>\\left\\langle V'(X)\\right\\rangle</math> will be ''almost'' the same, since both will be approximately equal to <math>V'(x_0)</math>. In that case, the expected position and expected momentum will remain very close to the classical trajectories, at least for as long as the wave function remains highly localized in position.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} p. 78</ref> When Planck's constant is small, it is possible to have a state that is well localized in ''both'' position and momentum. The small uncertainty in momentum ensures that the particle ''remains'' well localized in position for a long time, so that expected position and momentum continue to closely track the classical trajectories.\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation in its general form\n\n:<math> i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\Psi\\left(\\mathbf{r},t\\right) = \\hat{H} \\Psi\\left(\\mathbf{r},t\\right) \\,\\!</math>\n\nis closely related to the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation]] (HJE)\n\n:<math> -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} S(q_i,t) = H\\left(q_i,\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial q_i},t \\right) \\,\\!</math>\n\nwhere <math>S</math> is the classical [[action (physics)|action]] and <math>H</math> is the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian function]] (not operator). Here the [[generalized coordinates]] <math>q_i</math> for <math>i = 1, 2, 3</math> (used in the context of the HJE) can be set to the position in Cartesian coordinates as <math>\\mathbf{r} = (q_1, q_2, q_3) = (x, y, z)</math>.<ref name=\"Analytical Mechanics 2008\"/>\n\nSubstituting\n\n:<math> \\Psi = \\sqrt{\\rho(\\mathbf{r},t)} e^{iS(\\mathbf{r},t)/\\hbar}\\,\\!</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\rho</math> is the probability density, into the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and then taking the limit <math>\\hbar \\longrightarrow 0</math> in the resulting equation yield the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation.\n\nThe implications are as follows:\n\n* The motion of a particle, described by a (short-wavelength) wave packet solution to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, is also described by the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation of motion.\n* The Schr\u00f6dinger equation includes the wave function, so its wave packet solution implies the position of a (quantum) particle is fuzzily spread out in wave fronts. On the contrary, the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation applies to a (classical) particle of definite position and momentum, instead the position and momentum at all times (the trajectory) are deterministic and can be simultaneously known.\n\n==Nonrelativistic quantum mechanics==\nThe quantum mechanics of particles without accounting for the effects of [[special relativity]], for example particles propagating at speeds much less than [[speed of light|light]], is known as '''nonrelativistic quantum mechanics'''. Following are several forms of Schr\u00f6dinger's equation in this context for different situations: time independence and dependence, one and three spatial dimensions, and one and {{math|''N''}} particles.\n\nIn actuality, the particles constituting the system do not have the numerical labels used in theory. The language of mathematics forces us to label the positions of particles one way or another, otherwise there would be confusion between symbols representing which variables are for which particle.<ref name=\"Atoms, Molecules 1985\">''Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles'' (2nd Edition), R. Resnick, R. Eisberg, John Wiley & Sons, 1985, {{isbn|978-0-471-87373-0}}</ref>\n\n===Time-independent===\nIf the Hamiltonian is not an explicit function of time, the equation is [[Separation of variables|separable]] into a product of spatial and temporal parts. In general, the wave function takes the form:\n\n:<math>\\Psi(\\text{space coords},t)=\\psi(\\text{space coords})\\tau(t)\\,.</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03c8''(space coords)}} is a function of all the spatial coordinate(s) of the particle(s) constituting the system only, and {{math|''\u03c4''(''t'')}} is a function of time only.\n\nSubstituting for {{math|''&psi;''}} into the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the relevant number of particles in the relevant number of dimensions, solving by [[separation of variables]] implies the general solution of the time-dependent equation has the form:<ref name=\"verlagsgesellschaft1991\"/>\n\n:<math> \\Psi(\\text{space coords},t) = \\psi(\\text{space coords}) e^{-i{E t/\\hbar}} \\,.</math>\n\nSince the time dependent phase factor is always the same, only the spatial part needs to be solved for in time independent problems. Additionally, the energy operator {{math|''\u00ca'' {{=}} ''i\u0127''{{sfrac|\u2202|\u2202''t''}}}} can always be replaced by the energy eigenvalue {{math|''E''}}, thus the time independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation is an [[eigenvalue]] equation for the Hamiltonian operator:<ref name=Shankar1994/>{{rp|143ff}}\n:<math>\\hat{H} \\psi = E \\psi </math>\n\nThis is true for any number of particles in any number of dimensions (in a time independent potential). This case describes the [[standing wave]] solutions of the time-dependent equation, which are the states with definite energy (instead of a probability distribution of different energies). In physics, these standing waves are called \"[[stationary state]]s\" or \"[[energy eigenstate]]s\"; in chemistry they are called \"[[atomic orbital]]s\" or \"[[molecular orbital]]s\". Superpositions of energy eigenstates change their properties according to the relative phases between the energy levels.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues from this equation form a discrete [[Spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] of values, so mathematically energy must be quantized. More specifically, the energy eigenstates form a basis \u2013 any wave function may be written as a sum over the discrete energy states or an integral over continuous energy states, or more generally as an integral over a measure. This is the [[spectral theorem]] in mathematics, and in a finite state space it is just a statement of the completeness of the eigenvectors of a [[Hermitian matrix]].\n\n===One-dimensional examples===\nFor a particle in one dimension, the Hamiltonian is:\n \n:<math> \\hat{H} = \\frac{\\hat{p}^2}{2m} + V(x) \\,, \\quad \\hat{p} = -i\\hbar \\frac{d}{d x}  </math>\n\nand substituting this into the general Schr\u00f6dinger equation gives:\n\n:<math> \\left[-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2}{d x^2} + V(x) \\right]\\psi(x) = E\\psi(x) </math>\n\nThis is the only case the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is an [[ordinary derivative|ordinary]] differential equation, rather than a [[partial derivative|partial]] differential equation.

Oscillatory solutions have a classically allowed energy and correspond to actual classical motions, while the exponential solutions have a disallowed energy and describe a small amount of quantum bleeding into the classically disallowed region, due to [[quantum tunneling]]. If the potential {{math|''V''<sub>0</sub>}} grows to infinity, the motion is classically confined to a finite region.

Ultimately, these properties arise from the Hamiltonian used, and the solutions to the equation.\n\n===Linearity===\n{{See also|Linear differential equation}}\n\nIn the development above, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation was made to be linear for generality, though this has other implications. If two wave functions {{math|''\u03c8''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''\u03c8''<sub>2</sub>}} are solutions, then so is any [[linear combination]] of the two:\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\psi = a\\psi_1 + b \\psi_2 </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are any complex numbers (the sum can be extended for any number of wave functions). This property allows [[Quantum superposition|superpositions of quantum states]] to be solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Even more generally, it holds that a general solution to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be found by taking a weighted sum over all single state solutions achievable. For example, consider a wave function {{math|''\u03a8''(''x'', ''t'')}} such that the wave function is a product of two functions: one time independent, and one time dependent. If states of definite energy found using the time independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation are given by {{math|''\u03c8<sub>E</sub>''(''x'')}} with amplitude {{math|''A<sub>n</sub>''}} and time dependent phase factor is given by\n\n:<math>e^{{-iE_n t}/\\hbar}, </math>\n\nthen a valid general solution is\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\Psi(x,t) = \\sum\\limits_{n} A_n \\psi_{E_n}(x) e^{{-iE_n t}/\\hbar}. </math>\n\nAdditionally, the ability to scale solutions allows one to solve for a wave function without normalizing it first. If one has a set of normalized solutions {{math|''\u03c8<sub>n</sub>''}}, then\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\Psi = \\sum\\limits_{n} A_n \\psi_n </math>\n\ncan be normalized by ensuring that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\sum\\limits_{n}|A_n|^2 = 1. </math>\n\nThis is much more convenient than having to verify that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}|\\Psi(x)|^2\\,dx = \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\Psi(x)\\Psi^{*}(x)\\,dx = 1. </math>\n\n=== Momentum space Schr\u00f6dinger equation ===\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation <math>i\\hbar \\partial_t |\\psi\\rangle = \\hat{H}|\\psi \\rangle </math> is often presented in the position basis form <math>i\\hbar \\partial_t \\psi(x) = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2\\psi(x) + V(x)\\psi(x) </math> (with <math>\\langle x |\\psi\\rangle \\equiv \\psi(x) </math>). But as a vector operator equation it has a valid representation in any arbitrary complete basis of kets in [[Hilbert space]]. For example, in the momentum space basis the equation reads\n\n<math>\\displaystyle i\\hbar \\partial_t f(p) = \\frac{p^2}{2m}f(p) + (\\tilde{V}*f) (p) </math>\n\nwhere <math>|p\\rangle </math> is the plane wave state of definite momentum <math>p </math>, <math>\\langle p |\\psi\\rangle \\equiv f(p) = \\int \\psi(x)e^{-ipx}dx </math>, <math>\\tilde{V} </math> is the Fourier transform of <math>V </math>, and <math>* </math> denotes [[Convolution theorem|Fourier convolution]].\n\nIn the 1D example with absence of a potential, <math>\\tilde V = 0 </math> (or similarly <math>\\tilde V(k) \\propto \\delta(k) </math> in the case of a background potential constant throughout space), each stationary state of energy <math> \\hbar \\omega = q^2/2m </math> is of the form\n\n<math> f_q(p) = (c_{+}\\delta(p-q)+c_{-}\\delta(p+q))e^{-i\\omega t} </math>\n\nfor arbitrary complex coefficients <math> c_{\\pm} </math>. Such a wave function, as expected in free space, is a superposition of plane waves moving right and left with momenta <math> \\pm q </math>; upon momentum measurement the state would collapse to one of definite momentum <math> \\pm q </math> with probability <math> \\propto |c_{\\pm}|^2 </math>.\n\nA version of the momentum space Schr\u00f6dinger equation is often used in [[solid-state physics]], as [[Bloch's Theorem|Bloch's theorem]] ensures the periodic crystal lattice potential couples <math>f(p) </math> with <math>f(p+K) </math> for only discrete [[reciprocal lattice]] vectors <math>K </math>. This makes it convenient to solve the momentum space Schr\u00f6dinger equation at each [[Crystal momentum|point]] in the [[Brillouin zone]] independently of the other points in the Brillouin zone.\n\n=== Real energy eigenstates ===\nFor the time-independent equation, an additional feature of linearity follows: if two wave functions {{math|''\u03c8''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''&psi;''<sub>2</sub>}} are solutions to the time-independent equation with the same energy {{math|''E''}}, then so is any linear combination:\n\n:<math> \\hat H (a\\psi_1 + b \\psi_2 ) = a \\hat H \\psi_1 + b \\hat H \\psi_2 = E (a \\psi_1 + b\\psi_2). </math>\n\nTwo different solutions with the same energy are called ''degenerate''.<ref name=\"Quantum Mechanics Demystified 2006\"/>\n\nIn an arbitrary potential, if a wave function {{math|''\u03c8''}} solves the time-independent equation, so does its [[complex conjugate]], denoted {{math|''\u03c8''*}}. By taking linear combinations, the real and imaginary parts of {{math|''\u03c8''}} are each solutions. If there is no degeneracy they can only differ by a factor.\n\nIn the time-dependent equation, complex conjugate waves move in opposite directions. If {{math|''\u03a8''(''x'', ''t'')}} is one solution, then so is {{math|''\u03a8''*(''x'', \u2013''t'')}}. The symmetry of complex conjugation is called [[T-symmetry|time-reversal symmetry]].\n\n===Space and time derivatives===\n[[File:Wavefunction continuity space.svg|250px|thumb|Continuity of the wave function and its first spatial derivative (in the {{math|''x''}} direction, {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''z''}} coordinates not shown), at some time {{math|''t''}}.]]\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation is first order in time and second in space, which describes the time evolution of a quantum state (meaning it determines the future amplitude from the present).\n\nExplicitly for one particle in 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinates \u2013 the equation is\n\n:<math>i\\hbar{\\partial \\Psi \\over \\partial t} = - {\\hbar^2\\over 2m} \\left ( {\\partial^2 \\Psi \\over \\partial x^2} + {\\partial^2 \\Psi \\over \\partial y^2} + {\\partial^2 \\Psi \\over \\partial z^2} \\right ) + V(x,y,z,t)\\Psi.\\,\\!</math>\n\nThe first time partial derivative implies the initial value (at {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}) of the wave function\n\n:<math> \\Psi(x,y,z,0) \\,\\!</math>\n\nis an arbitrary constant. Likewise \u2013 the second order derivatives with respect to space implies the wave function ''and'' its first order spatial derivatives\n\n:<math> \\begin{align} \n& \\Psi(x_b,y_b,z_b,t) \\\\\n& \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\Psi(x_b,y_b,z_b,t) \\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\Psi(x_b,y_b,z_b,t) \\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\Psi(x_b,y_b,z_b,t) \n\\end{align} \\,\\!</math>\n\nare all arbitrary constants at a given set of points, where {{math|''x<sub>b</sub>''}}, {{math|''y<sub>b</sub>''}}, {{math|''z<sub>b</sub>''}} are a set of points describing boundary {{math|''b''}} (derivatives are evaluated at the boundaries). Typically there are one or two boundaries, such as the [[step potential]] and [[particle in a box]] respectively.\n\nAs the first order derivatives are arbitrary, the wave function can be a [[smooth function|continuously differentiable function]] of space, since at any boundary the gradient of the wave function can be matched.\n\nOn the contrary, wave equations in physics are usually ''second order in time'', notable are the family of classical [[wave equation]]s and the quantum [[Klein\u2013Gordon equation]].\n\n=== Local conservation of probability ===\n{{Main|Probability current|Continuity equation}}\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation is consistent with [[conservation of probability|probability conservation]]. Multiplying the Schr\u00f6dinger equation on the right by the complex conjugate wave function, and multiplying the wave function to the left of the complex conjugate of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and subtracting, gives the [[Continuity equation#Quantum mechanics|continuity equation]] for probability:<ref name=\"Quantum Mechanics 2004\">''Quantum Mechanics'', E. Abers, Pearson Ed., Addison Wesley, Prentice Hall Inc, 2004, {{isbn|978-0-13-146100-0}}</ref>\n:<math>{ \\partial \\over \\partial t} \\rho\\left(\\mathbf{r},t\\right) + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{j} = 0, </math>\nwhere \n:<math>\\rho=|\\Psi|^2=\\Psi^*(\\mathbf{r},t)\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)\\,\\!</math>\nis the [[probability density function|probability density]] (probability per unit volume, {{math|*}} denotes [[complex conjugate]]), and\n:<math> \\mathbf{j} = {1 \\over 2m} \\left( \\Psi^*\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\Psi  - \\Psi\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\Psi^* \\right)\\,\\!</math>\nis the [[probability current]] (flow per unit area).\n\nHence predictions from the Schr\u00f6dinger equation do not violate probability conservation.\n\n=== Positive energy ===\nIf the potential is bounded from below, meaning there is a minimum value of potential energy, the eigenfunctions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation have energy which is also bounded from below. This can be seen most easily by using the [[variational principle]], as follows. (See also below).\n\nFor any linear operator {{math|''\u00c2''}} [[Bounded operator|bounded]] from below, the eigenvector with the smallest eigenvalue is the vector {{math|''\u03c8''}} that minimizes the quantity\n\n:<math> \\langle \\psi |\\hat{A}|\\psi \\rangle </math>\n\nover all {{math|''\u03c8''}} which are [[normalizable wave function|normalized]].<ref name=\"Quantum Mechanics 2004\"/> In this way, the smallest eigenvalue is expressed through the [[variational principle]]. For the Schr\u00f6dinger Hamiltonian {{math|''\u0124''}} bounded from below, the smallest eigenvalue is called the ground state energy. That energy is the minimum value of\n\n:<math>\\langle \\psi|\\hat{H}|\\psi\\rangle = \\int \\psi^*(\\mathbf{r}) \\left[ - \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) + V(\\mathbf{r})\\psi(\\mathbf{r})\\right] d^3\\mathbf{r} = \\int \\left[ \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}|\\nabla\\psi|^2 + V(\\mathbf{r}) |\\psi|^2 \\right] d^3\\mathbf{r} = \\langle \\hat{H}\\rangle </math>\n\n(using [[integration by parts]]). Due to the [[Absolute value#Complex numbers|complex modulus]] of {{math|''\u03c8''<sup>2</sup>}} (which is positive definite), the right hand side is always greater than the lowest value of {{math|''V''(''x'')}}. In particular, the ground state energy is positive when {{math|''V''(''x'')}} is everywhere positive.\n\nFor potentials which are bounded below and are not infinite over a region, there is a ground state which minimizes the integral above. This lowest energy wave function is real and positive definite \u2013 meaning the wave function can increase and decrease, but is positive for all positions. It physically cannot be negative: if it were, smoothing out the bends at the sign change (to minimize the wave function) rapidly reduces the gradient contribution to the integral and hence the kinetic energy, while the potential energy changes linearly and less quickly. The kinetic and potential energy are both changing at different rates, so the total energy is not constant, which can't happen (conservation). The solutions are consistent with Schr\u00f6dinger equation if this wave function is positive definite.\n\nThe lack of sign changes also shows that the ground state is nondegenerate, since if there were two ground states with common energy {{math|''E''}}, not proportional to each other, there would be a linear combination of the two that would also be a ground state resulting in a zero solution.\n\n===Analytic continuation to diffusion===\n{{see also|path integral formulation#The Schr\u00f6dinger equation|label 1=Path integral formulation (The Schr\u00f6dinger equation)}}\n\nThe above properties (positive definiteness of energy) allow the [[analytic continuation]] of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to be identified as a [[stochastic process]].

However, since <math>\\hat{H}</math> for most physically reasonable Hamiltonians (e.g., the [[Laplace operator]], possibly modified by a potential) is unbounded in <math>L^2</math>, this shows that the semigroup flows lack Sobolev regularity in general. Instead, solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation satisfy a [[Strichartz estimate]].\n\n==Relativistic quantum mechanics==\n[[Relativistic quantum mechanics]] is obtained where quantum mechanics and [[special relativity]] simultaneously apply. In general, one wishes to build [[relativistic wave equations]] from the relativistic [[energy\u2013momentum relation]]\n\n:<math>E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2 \\, , </math>\n\ninstead of classical energy equations. The [[Klein\u2013Gordon equation]] and the [[Dirac equation]] are two such equations. The Klein\u2013Gordon equation,\n\n:<math> \\frac {1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} \\psi - \\nabla^2 \\psi + \\frac {m^2 c^2}{\\hbar^2} \\psi = 0. </math>,\n\nwas the first such equation to be obtained, even before the nonrelativistic one, and applies to massive spinless particles. The Dirac equation arose from taking the \"square root\" of the Klein\u2013Gordon equation by factorizing the entire relativistic wave operator into a product of two operators \u2013 one of these is the operator for the entire Dirac equation. Entire Dirac equation:\n:<math>\\left(\\beta mc^2 + c\\left(\\sum_{n \\mathop =1}^{3}\\alpha_n p_n\\right)\\right) \\psi = i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial\\psi }{\\partial t} </math>\n\nThe general form of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation remains true in relativity, but the Hamiltonian is less obvious. For example, the Dirac Hamiltonian for a particle of mass {{math|''m''}} and electric charge {{math|''q''}} in an electromagnetic field (described by the [[electromagnetic potential]]s {{math|''\u03c6''}} and {{math|'''A'''}}) is:\n\n:<math>\\hat{H}_{\\text{Dirac}}= \\gamma^0 \\left[c  \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}\\cdot\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} - q \\mathbf{A}\\right) + mc^2 + \\gamma^0q \\varphi \\right]\\,, </math>\n\nin which the {{math|'''\u03b3''' {{=}} (''\u03b3''<sup>1</sup>, ''\u03b3''<sup>2</sup>, ''\u03b3''<sup>3</sup>)}} and {{math|''\u03b3''<sup>0</sup>}} are the Dirac [[gamma matrices]] related to the spin of the particle. The Dirac equation is true for all {{nobreak|[[spin-1/2|spin-{{frac|2}}]]}} particles, and the solutions to the equation are {{nobreak|4-component}} [[spinor field]]s with two components corresponding to the particle and the other two for the [[antiparticle]].\n\nFor the Klein\u2013Gordon equation, the general form of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is inconvenient to use, and in practice the Hamiltonian is not expressed in an analogous way to the Dirac Hamiltonian. The equations for relativistic quantum fields can be obtained in other ways, such as starting from a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian density]] and using the [[Euler\u2013Lagrange equation]]s for fields, or use the [[representation theory of the Lorentz group]] in which certain representations can be used to fix the equation for a free particle of given spin (and mass).\n\nIn general, the Hamiltonian to be substituted in the general Schr\u00f6dinger equation is not just a function of the position and momentum operators (and possibly time), but also of spin matrices. Also, the solutions to a relativistic wave equation, for a massive particle of spin {{math|''s''}}, are complex-valued {{nobreak|{{math|2(2''s'' + 1)}}-component}} [[spinor field]]s.\n\n==Quantum field theory==\nThe general equation is also valid and used in [[quantum field theory]], both in relativistic and nonrelativistic situations. However, the solution {{math|''\u03c8''}} is no longer interpreted as a \"wave\", but should be interpreted as an operator acting on states existing in a [[Fock space]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==First order form==\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation can also be derived from a first order form<ref  name=\"one\">{{cite journal|last1=Ajaib|first1=Muhammad Adeel|title=A Fundamental Form of the Schr\u00f6dinger Equation|journal=Found.

As such, there exists an [[Exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] such that <math>\\hat{U}(t) = e^{-i\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}t}</math> where <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> is a [[Hermitian operator]] (given by the fact that the [[Lie algebra]] of the [[unitary group]] is generated by skew-[[Hermitian operators]], and if <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> is Hermitian, then <math>-i \\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> is skew-Hermitian). Therefore, the first-order Taylor expansion of <math>\\hat{U}(t)</math> centered at <math>t_0</math> takes the form\n:<math>\\hat{U}(t) \\approx 1 - i(t-t_0)\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}.</math>\n\nAnd so, substituting the above expansion into ({{EquationNote|1}}) thus yields\n:<math>\\psi(t) = \\psi(t_0) - i(t-t_0)\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}\\psi(t_0),</math>\n\nwhich, when rearranged and taken in the limit <math>t \\rightarrow t_0</math>, provides an equation of the same form as the Schr&ouml;dinger equation\n:<math>i\\frac{d\\psi}{dt} = \\hat{\\mathcal{H}}\\psi,</math>\n\nwhere the ordinary definition for the derivative was used. However, the operator <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> used here denotes an ''arbitrary'' Hermitian operator. Nonetheless, by using the [[correspondence principle]] it is possible to show that in the classical limit, using appropriate units, the expectation value of <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> indeed corresponds to the Hamiltonian of the system.<ref>{{cite book|title=Modern Quantum Mechanics|last1=Sakurai|first1=J. J.|date=1995|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Massachusetts|page=68}}</ref>\n\n==Implications==\n===Energy===\nThe Hamiltonian is constructed in the same manner as in classical mechanics. However, in classical mechanics, the Hamiltonian is a scalar-valued function, whereas in quantum mechanics, it is an operator on a space of functions. It is not surprising that the [[eigenvalues]] of <math>\\hat{H}</math> are the energy levels of the system.\n\n===Quantization===\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation predicts that if certain properties of a system are measured, the result may be ''quantized'', meaning that only specific discrete values can occur. One example is ''energy quantization'': the energy of an electron in an atom is always one of the [[Energy level|quantized energy levels]], a fact discovered via [[atomic spectroscopy]]. (Energy quantization is discussed [[#Time-independent|below]].) Another example is [[angular momentum operator|quantization of angular momentum]]. This was an ''assumption'' in the earlier [[Bohr model|Bohr model of the atom]], but it is a ''prediction'' of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\n\nAnother result of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is that not every measurement gives a quantized result in quantum mechanics. For example, position, momentum, time, and (in some situations) energy can have any value across a continuous range.<ref name=\"Zettili2009\">{{cite book|author=Nouredine Zettili|title=Quantum Mechanics: Concepts and Applications|date=17 February 2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-02678-6}}</ref>{{rp|165\u2013167}}\n\n===Quantum tunneling===\n{{main|Quantum tunneling}}\n[[File:TunnelEffektKling1.png|width = 300px|thumb|[[Quantum tunneling]] through a barrier. A particle coming from the left does not have enough energy to climb the barrier. However, it can sometimes \"tunnel\" to the other side. ]]\n\nIn classical physics, when a ball is rolled slowly up a large hill, it will come to a stop and roll back, because it doesn't have enough energy to get over the top of the hill to the other side. However, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation predicts that there is a small probability that the ball will get to the other side of the hill, even if it has too little energy to reach the top. This is called [[quantum tunneling]]. It is related to the distribution of energy: although the ball's assumed position seems to be on one side of the hill, there is a chance of finding it on the other side.\n\n===Particles as waves===\n{{main|Matter wave|Wave\u2013particle duality|Double-slit experiment}}\n\n[[File:Double-slit experiment results Tanamura 2.jpg|175px|thumb|A double slit experiment showing the accumulation of electrons on a screen as time passes.]]\n\nThe nonrelativistic Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a type of [[partial differential equation]] called a [[wave equation]]. Therefore, it is often said particles can exhibit behavior usually attributed to waves. In some modern interpretations this description is reversed \u2013 the quantum state, i.e. wave, is the only genuine physical reality, and under the appropriate conditions it can show features of particle-like behavior. However, Ballentine<ref name=Ballentine>{{citation|last=Ballentine|first=Leslie|title=Quantum Mechanics: A Modern Development | publisher=World Scientific Publishing Co.|year=1998| isbn = 978-9810241056}}</ref>{{rp|Chapter 4, p.99}} shows that such an interpretation has problems. Ballentine points out that whilst it is arguable to associate a physical wave with a single particle, there is still only ''one'' Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation for many particles. He points out:\n:''\"If a physical wave field were associated with a particle, or if a particle were identified with a wave packet, then corresponding to N interacting particles there should be N interacting waves in ordinary three-dimensional space. But according to (4.6) that is not the case; instead there is one \"wave\" function in an abstract 3N-dimensional configuration space. The misinterpretation of psi as a physical wave in ordinary space is possible only because the most common applications of quantum mechanics are to one-particle states, for which configuration space and ordinary space are isomorphic.\"''\n\n[[Double-slit experiment|Two-slit diffraction]] is a famous example of the strange behaviors that waves regularly display, that are not intuitively associated with particles. The overlapping waves from the two slits cancel each other out in some locations, and reinforce each other in other locations, causing a complex pattern to emerge. Intuitively, one would not expect this pattern from firing a single particle at the slits, because the particle should pass through one slit or the other, not a complex overlap of both.\n\nHowever, since the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a [[wave equation]], a single particle fired through a double-slit ''does'' show this same pattern (figure on right). The experiment must be repeated many times for the complex pattern to emerge. Although this is counterintuitive, the prediction is correct; in particular, [[electron diffraction]] and [[neutron diffraction]] are well understood and widely used in science and engineering.\n\nRelated to [[diffraction]], particles also display [[Superposition principle#Application to waves|superposition]] and [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]].\n\nThe superposition property allows the particle to be in a [[quantum superposition]] of two or more quantum states at the same time. However, a \"quantum state\" in quantum mechanics means the ''probability'' that a system will be, for example at a position {{math|''x''}}, not that the system will actually be at position {{math|''x''}}. It does not imply that the particle itself may be in two classical states at once. Indeed, quantum mechanics is generally unable to assign values for properties prior to measurement at all.\n\n====Measurement and uncertainty====\n{{main|Measurement in quantum mechanics|Heisenberg uncertainty principle|Interpretations of quantum mechanics}}\nIn classical mechanics, a particle has, at every moment, an exact position and an exact momentum. These values change [[determinism|deterministically]] as the particle moves according to [[Newton's laws]]. Under the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, particles do not have exactly determined properties, and when they are measured, the result is randomly drawn from a [[probability distribution]]. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation predicts what the probability distributions are, but fundamentally cannot predict the exact result of each measurement.\n\nThe [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] is one statement of the inherent measurement uncertainty in quantum mechanics. It states that the more precisely a particle's position is known, the less precisely its momentum is known, and vice versa.\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation describes the (deterministic) evolution of the [[wave function]] of a particle. However, even if the wave function is known exactly, the result of a specific measurement on the wave function is uncertain.\n\n==Interpretation of the wave function==\n{{main|Interpretations of quantum mechanics}}\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation provides a way to calculate the wave function of a system and how it changes dynamically in time. However, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation does not directly say ''what'', exactly, the wave function is. [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics]] address questions such as what the relation is between the wave function, the underlying reality, and the results of experimental measurements.\n\nAn important aspect is the relationship between the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and [[wave function collapse]]. In the oldest [[Copenhagen interpretation]], particles follow the Schr\u00f6dinger equation ''except'' during wave function collapse, during which they behave entirely differently. The advent of [[quantum decoherence|quantum decoherence theory]] allowed alternative approaches (such as the [[Everett many-worlds interpretation]] and [[consistent histories]]), wherein the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is ''always'' satisfied, and wave function collapse should be explained as a consequence of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\n\nIn 1952, [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] gave a lecture during which he commented,\n:Nearly every result [a quantum theorist] pronounces is about the probability of this ''or'' that or that ... happening\u2014with usually a great many alternatives. The idea that they be not alternatives but ''all'' really happen simultaneously seems lunatic to him, just ''impossible.''<ref>{{cite book|last=Schr\u00f6dinger |first=Erwin |authorlink=Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger|title=The interpretation of quantum mechanics: Dublin seminars (1949\u20131955) and other unpublished essays |year=1995 |publisher=Ox Bow Press |isbn=9781881987086}}</ref>\n\n[[David Deutsch]] regarded this as the earliest known reference to a many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, an interpretation generally credited to [[Hugh Everett III]],<ref>David Deutsch, ''The Beginning of Infinity'', page 310</ref> while [[Jeffrey A.

Since energy and [[momentum]] are related in the same way as [[frequency]] and [[wavenumber|wave number]] in [[special relativity]], it followed that the momentum <math>p</math> of a photon is inversely proportional to its [[wavelength]] <math>\\lambda</math>, or proportional to its wave number <math>k</math>:\n\n:<math>p = \\frac{h}{\\lambda} = \\hbar k,</math>\n\nwhere <math>h</math> is [[Planck's constant]] and <math>\\hbar = {h}/{2\\pi}</math> is the reduced Planck constant (or the Dirac constant). [[Louis de Broglie]] hypothesized that this is true for all particles, even particles which have mass such as electrons. He showed that, assuming that the matter waves propagate along with their particle counterparts, electrons form [[standing wave]]s, meaning that only certain discrete rotational frequencies about the nucleus of an atom are allowed.<ref>\n{{Cite journal\n |last        = de Broglie\n |first       = L.\n |year        = 1925\n |title       = Recherches sur la th\u00e9orie des quanta\n |trans-title = On the Theory of Quanta\n |url         = http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/04/70/78/PDF/tel-00006807.pdf\n |journal     = [[Annales de Physique]]\n |volume      = 10\n |issue       = 3\n |pages       = 22\u2013128\n |doi         = 10.1051/anphys/192510030022\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090509012910/http://www.ensmp.fr/aflb/LDB-oeuvres/De_Broglie_Kracklauer.pdf\n |archivedate = 9 May 2009\n |df          = dmy-all\n|bibcode       = 1925AnPh...10...22D\n }} .</ref>\nThese quantized orbits correspond to discrete [[energy level]]s, and de Broglie reproduced the [[Bohr model]] formula for the energy levels.

Hence a necessary and separate requirement is that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a [[linear differential equation]].\n\nFor discrete <math>\\mathbf{k}</math> the sum is a [[superposition principle#Application to waves|superposition]] of plane waves:\n\n:<math> \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty A_n e^{i(\\mathbf{k}_n\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-\\omega_n t)} \\,\\!</math>\n\nfor some real amplitude coefficients <math>A_n</math>, and for continuous <math>\\mathbf{k}</math> the sum becomes an integral, the [[Fourier transform]] of a momentum space wave function:<ref name=\"Quantum Mechanics Demystified 2006\">''Quantum Mechanics Demystified'', D.

The momentum wave function <math>\\Phi (\\mathbf{k})</math> arises in the integrand since the position and momentum space wave functions are Fourier transforms of each other.\n\n=== Consistency with the de Broglie relations ===\n[[File:Wavefunction values.svg|300px|thumb|Diagrammatic summary of the quantities related to the wave function, as used in De broglie's hypothesis and development of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.<ref name=\"Quanta 1974\"/>]]\n\n[[Photoelectric effect|Einstein's light quanta hypothesis]] (1905) states that the energy {{math|''E''}} of a quantum of light or photon is proportional to its [[frequency]] <math>\\nu</math> (or [[angular frequency]], <math>\\omega = 2\\pi \\nu</math>)\n:<math>E = h\\nu = \\hbar \\omega \\,\\!</math>\nLikewise [[Matter wave|De Broglie's hypothesis]] (1924) states that any particle can be associated with a wave, and that the momentum <math>p</math> of the particle is inversely proportional to the [[wavelength]] <math>\\lambda</math> of such a wave (or proportional to the [[wavenumber]], <math>k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}</math>), in one dimension, by:\n:<math>p = \\frac{h}{\\lambda} =  \\hbar k\\;,</math>\nwhile in three dimensions, wavelength {{math|''\u03bb''}} is related to the magnitude of the [[wavevector]] {{math|'''k'''}}:\n:<math>\\mathbf{p} = \\hbar \\mathbf{k}\\,,\\quad |\\mathbf{k}| = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} \\,. </math>\n\nThe Planck\u2013Einstein and de Broglie relations illuminate the deep connections between energy with time, and space with momentum, and express [[wave\u2013particle duality]]. In practice, [[natural units]] comprising <math>\\hbar = 1</math> are used, as the De Broglie ''equations'' reduce to ''identities'': allowing momentum, wave number, energy and frequency to be used interchangeably, to prevent duplication of quantities, and reduce the number of dimensions of related quantities. For familiarity SI units are still used in this article.\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger's insight,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} late in 1925, was to express the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of a [[plane wave]] as a [[complex number|complex]] [[phase factor]] using these relations:\n\n:<math>\\Psi = Ae^{i(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-\\omega t)} = Ae^{i(\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-Et)/\\hbar} </math>\n\nand to realize that the first order [[partial derivatives]] with respect to space were\n\n:<math> \\nabla\\Psi = \\dfrac{i}{\\hbar}\\mathbf{p}Ae^{i(\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-Et)/\\hbar} = \\dfrac{i}{\\hbar}\\mathbf{p}\\Psi. </math>\n\nTaking partial derivatives with respect to time gives\n\n:<math> \\dfrac{\\partial \\Psi}{\\partial t} = -\\dfrac{i E}{\\hbar} Ae^{i(\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-Et)/\\hbar} = -\\dfrac{i E}{\\hbar} \\Psi. </math>\n\nAnother postulate of quantum mechanics is that all observables are represented by [[linear operator|linear]] [[Self-adjoint operator|Hermitian operators]] which act on the wave function, and the eigenvalues of the operator are the values the observable takes. The previous derivatives are consistent with the [[energy operator]] (or Hamiltonian operator), corresponding to the time derivative,\n\n:<math>\\hat{E} \\Psi = i\\hbar\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\Psi = E\\Psi  </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''E''}} are the energy [[eigenvalue]]s, and the [[momentum operator]], corresponding to the spatial derivatives (the [[del|gradient]] <math>\\nabla </math>),\n\n:<math>\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} \\Psi = -i\\hbar\\nabla \\Psi = \\mathbf{p} \\Psi </math>\n\nwhere {{math|'''p'''}} is a vector of the momentum eigenvalues. In the above, the \"[[circumflex|hats]]\" ( {{math|\u02c6}} ) indicate these observables are operators, not simply ordinary numbers or vectors. The energy and momentum operators are ''[[differential operators]]'', while the potential energy operator <math>V</math> is just a multiplicative factor.\n\nSubstituting the energy and momentum operators into the classical energy conservation equation obtains the operator:\n\n:<math>E= \\dfrac{\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{p}}{2m}+V \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\hat{E} = \\dfrac{\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}}{2m}  + V </math>\n\nso in terms of derivatives with respect to time and space, acting this operator on the wave function {{math|''\u03a8''}} immediately led Schr\u00f6dinger to his equation:{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n:<math>i\\hbar\\dfrac{\\partial \\Psi}{\\partial t}= -\\dfrac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2\\Psi +V\\Psi</math>\n\nWave\u2013particle duality can be assessed from these equations as follows. The kinetic energy {{math|''T''}} is related to the square of momentum {{math|'''p'''}}. As the particle's momentum increases, the kinetic energy increases more rapidly, but since the wave number {{math|{{!}}'''k'''{{!}}}} increases the wavelength {{math|''\u03bb''}} decreases. In terms of ordinary scalar and vector quantities (not operators):\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{p} \\propto \\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{k} \\propto T \\propto \\dfrac{1}{\\lambda^2}</math>\n\nThe kinetic energy is also proportional to the second spatial derivatives, so it is also proportional to the magnitude of the ''[[curvature]]'' of the wave, in terms of operators:\n\n:<math> \\hat{T} \\Psi = \\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla\\cdot\\nabla  \\Psi \\, \\propto \\, \\nabla^2 \\Psi \\,.</math>\n\nAs the curvature increases, the amplitude of the wave alternates between positive and negative more rapidly, and also shortens the wavelength. So the inverse relation between momentum and wavelength is consistent with the energy the particle has, and so the energy of the particle has a connection to a wave, all in the same mathematical formulation.<ref name=\"Quanta 1974\"/>\n\n===Wave and particle motion===\n {{multiple image\n   | align = right\n   | direction = horizontal\n   | image1    = Quantum mechanics travelling wavefunctions.svg\n   | caption1  = Increasing levels of [[wavepacket]] localization, meaning the particle has a more localized position.\n   | width1     = 400\n   | image2    = Perfect localization.svg\n   | caption2  = In the limit ''\u0127'' \u2192 0, the particle's position and momentum become known exactly.

Since, for a given spread in {{math|'''k'''}}, the spread in velocity is proportional to Planck's constant <math>\\hbar</math>, it is sometimes said that in the limit as <math>\\hbar</math> approaches zero, the equations of classical mechanics are restored from quantum mechanics.<ref name=\"Analytical Mechanics 2008\">''Analytical Mechanics'', L. N. Hand, J. D. Finch, Cambridge University Press, 2008, {{isbn|978-0-521-57572-0}}</ref> Great care is required in how that limit is taken, and in what cases.\n\nThe limiting short-wavelength is equivalent to <math>\\hbar</math> tending to zero because this is limiting case of increasing the wave packet localization to the definite position of the particle (see images right). Using the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] for position and momentum, the products of uncertainty in position and momentum become zero as <math>\\hbar \\longrightarrow 0</math>:\n\n:<math> \\sigma(x) \\sigma(p_x) \\geqslant \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\sigma(x) \\sigma(p_x) \\geqslant 0 \\,\\!</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03c3''}} denotes the (root mean square) [[measurement uncertainty]] in {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''p<sub>x</sub>''}} (and similarly for the {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''z''}} directions) which implies the position and momentum can only be known to arbitrary precision in this limit.\n\nOne simple way to compare classical to quantum mechanics is to consider the time-evolution of the ''expected'' position and ''expected'' momentum, which can then be compared to the time-evolution of the ordinary position and momentum in classical mechanics. The quantum expectation values satisfy the [[Ehrenfest theorem]]. For a one-dimensional quantum particle moving in a potential <math>V</math>, the Ehrenfest theorem says<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Section 3.7.5</ref>\n:<math>m\\frac{d}{dt}\\langle x\\rangle = \\langle p\\rangle;\\quad \\frac{d}{dt}\\langle p\\rangle =  -\\left\\langle V'(X)\\right\\rangle .</math>\nAlthough the first of these equations is consistent with the classical behavior, the second is not: If the pair <math>(\\langle X\\rangle,\\langle P\\rangle)</math> were to satisfy Newton's second law, the right-hand side of the second equation would have to be\n:<math>-V'\\left(\\left\\langle X\\right\\rangle\\right)</math>,\nwhich is typically not the same as <math>-\\left\\langle V'(X)\\right\\rangle</math>. In the case of the quantum harmonic oscillator, however, <math>V'</math> is linear and this distinction disappears, so that in this very special case, the expected position and expected momentum do exactly follow the classical trajectories.\n\nFor general systems, the best we can hope for is that the expected position and momentum will ''approximately'' follow the classical trajectories. If the wave function is highly concentrated around a point <math>x_0</math>, then <math>V'\\left(\\left\\langle X\\right\\rangle\\right)</math> and <math>\\left\\langle V'(X)\\right\\rangle</math> will be ''almost'' the same, since both will be approximately equal to <math>V'(x_0)</math>. In that case, the expected position and expected momentum will remain very close to the classical trajectories, at least for as long as the wave function remains highly localized in position.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} p. 78</ref> When Planck's constant is small, it is possible to have a state that is well localized in ''both'' position and momentum. The small uncertainty in momentum ensures that the particle ''remains'' well localized in position for a long time, so that expected position and momentum continue to closely track the classical trajectories.\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation in its general form\n\n:<math> i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\Psi\\left(\\mathbf{r},t\\right) = \\hat{H} \\Psi\\left(\\mathbf{r},t\\right) \\,\\!</math>\n\nis closely related to the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation]] (HJE)\n\n:<math> -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} S(q_i,t) = H\\left(q_i,\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial q_i},t \\right) \\,\\!</math>\n\nwhere <math>S</math> is the classical [[action (physics)|action]] and <math>H</math> is the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian function]] (not operator). Here the [[generalized coordinates]] <math>q_i</math> for <math>i = 1, 2, 3</math> (used in the context of the HJE) can be set to the position in Cartesian coordinates as <math>\\mathbf{r} = (q_1, q_2, q_3) = (x, y, z)</math>.<ref name=\"Analytical Mechanics 2008\"/>\n\nSubstituting\n\n:<math> \\Psi = \\sqrt{\\rho(\\mathbf{r},t)} e^{iS(\\mathbf{r},t)/\\hbar}\\,\\!</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\rho</math> is the probability density, into the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and then taking the limit <math>\\hbar \\longrightarrow 0</math> in the resulting equation yield the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation.\n\nThe implications are as follows:\n\n* The motion of a particle, described by a (short-wavelength) wave packet solution to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, is also described by the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation of motion.\n* The Schr\u00f6dinger equation includes the wave function, so its wave packet solution implies the position of a (quantum) particle is fuzzily spread out in wave fronts. On the contrary, the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation applies to a (classical) particle of definite position and momentum, instead the position and momentum at all times (the trajectory) are deterministic and can be simultaneously known.\n\n==Nonrelativistic quantum mechanics==\nThe quantum mechanics of particles without accounting for the effects of [[special relativity]], for example particles propagating at speeds much less than [[speed of light|light]], is known as '''nonrelativistic quantum mechanics'''. Following are several forms of Schr\u00f6dinger's equation in this context for different situations: time independence and dependence, one and three spatial dimensions, and one and {{math|''N''}} particles.\n\nIn actuality, the particles constituting the system do not have the numerical labels used in theory. The language of mathematics forces us to label the positions of particles one way or another, otherwise there would be confusion between symbols representing which variables are for which particle.<ref name=\"Atoms, Molecules 1985\">''Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles'' (2nd Edition), R. Resnick, R. Eisberg, John Wiley & Sons, 1985, {{isbn|978-0-471-87373-0}}</ref>\n\n===Time-independent===\nIf the Hamiltonian is not an explicit function of time, the equation is [[Separation of variables|separable]] into a product of spatial and temporal parts. In general, the wave function takes the form:\n\n:<math>\\Psi(\\text{space coords},t)=\\psi(\\text{space coords})\\tau(t)\\,.</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03c8''(space coords)}} is a function of all the spatial coordinate(s) of the particle(s) constituting the system only, and {{math|''\u03c4''(''t'')}} is a function of time only.\n\nSubstituting for {{math|''&psi;''}} into the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the relevant number of particles in the relevant number of dimensions, solving by [[separation of variables]] implies the general solution of the time-dependent equation has the form:<ref name=\"verlagsgesellschaft1991\"/>\n\n:<math> \\Psi(\\text{space coords},t) = \\psi(\\text{space coords}) e^{-i{E t/\\hbar}} \\,.</math>\n\nSince the time dependent phase factor is always the same, only the spatial part needs to be solved for in time independent problems. Additionally, the energy operator {{math|''\u00ca'' {{=}} ''i\u0127''{{sfrac|\u2202|\u2202''t''}}}} can always be replaced by the energy eigenvalue {{math|''E''}}, thus the time independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation is an [[eigenvalue]] equation for the Hamiltonian operator:<ref name=Shankar1994/>{{rp|143ff}}\n:<math>\\hat{H} \\psi = E \\psi </math>\n\nThis is true for any number of particles in any number of dimensions (in a time independent potential). This case describes the [[standing wave]] solutions of the time-dependent equation, which are the states with definite energy (instead of a probability distribution of different energies). In physics, these standing waves are called \"[[stationary state]]s\" or \"[[energy eigenstate]]s\"; in chemistry they are called \"[[atomic orbital]]s\" or \"[[molecular orbital]]s\". Superpositions of energy eigenstates change their properties according to the relative phases between the energy levels.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues from this equation form a discrete [[Spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] of values, so mathematically energy must be quantized. More specifically, the energy eigenstates form a basis \u2013 any wave function may be written as a sum over the discrete energy states or an integral over continuous energy states, or more generally as an integral over a measure. This is the [[spectral theorem]] in mathematics, and in a finite state space it is just a statement of the completeness of the eigenvectors of a [[Hermitian matrix]].\n\n===One-dimensional examples===\nFor a particle in one dimension, the Hamiltonian is:\n \n:<math> \\hat{H} = \\frac{\\hat{p}^2}{2m} + V(x) \\,, \\quad \\hat{p} = -i\\hbar \\frac{d}{d x}  </math>\n\nand substituting this into the general Schr\u00f6dinger equation gives:\n\n:<math> \\left[-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2}{d x^2} + V(x) \\right]\\psi(x) = E\\psi(x) </math>\n\nThis is the only case the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is an [[ordinary derivative|ordinary]] differential equation, rather than a [[partial derivative|partial]] differential equation.

Oscillatory solutions have a classically allowed energy and correspond to actual classical motions, while the exponential solutions have a disallowed energy and describe a small amount of quantum bleeding into the classically disallowed region, due to [[quantum tunneling]]. If the potential {{math|''V''<sub>0</sub>}} grows to infinity, the motion is classically confined to a finite region.

Ultimately, these properties arise from the Hamiltonian used, and the solutions to the equation.\n\n===Linearity===\n{{See also|Linear differential equation}}\n\nIn the development above, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation was made to be linear for generality, though this has other implications. If two wave functions {{math|''\u03c8''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''\u03c8''<sub>2</sub>}} are solutions, then so is any [[linear combination]] of the two:\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\psi = a\\psi_1 + b \\psi_2 </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are any complex numbers (the sum can be extended for any number of wave functions). This property allows [[Quantum superposition|superpositions of quantum states]] to be solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Even more generally, it holds that a general solution to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be found by taking a weighted sum over all single state solutions achievable. For example, consider a wave function {{math|''\u03a8''(''x'', ''t'')}} such that the wave function is a product of two functions: one time independent, and one time dependent. If states of definite energy found using the time independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation are given by {{math|''\u03c8<sub>E</sub>''(''x'')}} with amplitude {{math|''A<sub>n</sub>''}} and time dependent phase factor is given by\n\n:<math>e^{{-iE_n t}/\\hbar}, </math>\n\nthen a valid general solution is\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\Psi(x,t) = \\sum\\limits_{n} A_n \\psi_{E_n}(x) e^{{-iE_n t}/\\hbar}. </math>\n\nAdditionally, the ability to scale solutions allows one to solve for a wave function without normalizing it first. If one has a set of normalized solutions {{math|''\u03c8<sub>n</sub>''}}, then\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\Psi = \\sum\\limits_{n} A_n \\psi_n </math>\n\ncan be normalized by ensuring that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\sum\\limits_{n}|A_n|^2 = 1. </math>\n\nThis is much more convenient than having to verify that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}|\\Psi(x)|^2\\,dx = \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\Psi(x)\\Psi^{*}(x)\\,dx = 1. </math>\n\n=== Momentum space Schr\u00f6dinger equation ===\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation <math>i\\hbar \\partial_t |\\psi\\rangle = \\hat{H}|\\psi \\rangle </math> is often presented in the position basis form <math>i\\hbar \\partial_t \\psi(x) = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2\\psi(x) + V(x)\\psi(x) </math> (with <math>\\langle x |\\psi\\rangle \\equiv \\psi(x) </math>). But as a vector operator equation it has a valid representation in any arbitrary complete basis of kets in [[Hilbert space]]. For example, in the momentum space basis the equation reads\n\n<math>\\displaystyle i\\hbar \\partial_t f(p) = \\frac{p^2}{2m}f(p) + (\\tilde{V}*f) (p) </math>\n\nwhere <math>|p\\rangle </math> is the plane wave state of definite momentum <math>p </math>, <math>\\langle p |\\psi\\rangle \\equiv f(p) = \\int \\psi(x)e^{-ipx}dx </math>, <math>\\tilde{V} </math> is the Fourier transform of <math>V </math>, and <math>* </math> denotes [[Convolution theorem|Fourier convolution]].\n\nIn the 1D example with absence of a potential, <math>\\tilde V = 0 </math> (or similarly <math>\\tilde V(k) \\propto \\delta(k) </math> in the case of a background potential constant throughout space), each stationary state of energy <math> \\hbar \\omega = q^2/2m </math> is of the form\n\n<math> f_q(p) = (c_{+}\\delta(p-q)+c_{-}\\delta(p+q))e^{-i\\omega t} </math>\n\nfor arbitrary complex coefficients <math> c_{\\pm} </math>. Such a wave function, as expected in free space, is a superposition of plane waves moving right and left with momenta <math> \\pm q </math>; upon momentum measurement the state would collapse to one of definite momentum <math> \\pm q </math> with probability <math> \\propto |c_{\\pm}|^2 </math>.\n\nA version of the momentum space Schr\u00f6dinger equation is often used in [[solid-state physics]], as [[Bloch's Theorem|Bloch's theorem]] ensures the periodic crystal lattice potential couples <math>f(p) </math> with <math>f(p+K) </math> for only discrete [[reciprocal lattice]] vectors <math>K </math>. This makes it convenient to solve the momentum space Schr\u00f6dinger equation at each [[Crystal momentum|point]] in the [[Brillouin zone]] independently of the other points in the Brillouin zone.\n\n=== Real energy eigenstates ===\nFor the time-independent equation, an additional feature of linearity follows: if two wave functions {{math|''\u03c8''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''&psi;''<sub>2</sub>}} are solutions to the time-independent equation with the same energy {{math|''E''}}, then so is any linear combination:\n\n:<math> \\hat H (a\\psi_1 + b \\psi_2 ) = a \\hat H \\psi_1 + b \\hat H \\psi_2 = E (a \\psi_1 + b\\psi_2). </math>\n\nTwo different solutions with the same energy are called ''degenerate''.<ref name=\"Quantum Mechanics Demystified 2006\"/>\n\nIn an arbitrary potential, if a wave function {{math|''\u03c8''}} solves the time-independent equation, so does its [[complex conjugate]], denoted {{math|''\u03c8''*}}. By taking linear combinations, the real and imaginary parts of {{math|''\u03c8''}} are each solutions. If there is no degeneracy they can only differ by a factor.\n\nIn the time-dependent equation, complex conjugate waves move in opposite directions. If {{math|''\u03a8''(''x'', ''t'')}} is one solution, then so is {{math|''\u03a8''*(''x'', \u2013''t'')}}. The symmetry of complex conjugation is called [[T-symmetry|time-reversal symmetry]].\n\n===Space and time derivatives===\n[[File:Wavefunction continuity space.svg|250px|thumb|Continuity of the wave function and its first spatial derivative (in the {{math|''x''}} direction, {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''z''}} coordinates not shown), at some time {{math|''t''}}.]]\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation is first order in time and second in space, which describes the time evolution of a quantum state (meaning it determines the future amplitude from the present).\n\nExplicitly for one particle in 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinates \u2013 the equation is\n\n:<math>i\\hbar{\\partial \\Psi \\over \\partial t} = - {\\hbar^2\\over 2m} \\left ( {\\partial^2 \\Psi \\over \\partial x^2} + {\\partial^2 \\Psi \\over \\partial y^2} + {\\partial^2 \\Psi \\over \\partial z^2} \\right ) + V(x,y,z,t)\\Psi.\\,\\!</math>\n\nThe first time partial derivative implies the initial value (at {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}) of the wave function\n\n:<math> \\Psi(x,y,z,0) \\,\\!</math>\n\nis an arbitrary constant. Likewise \u2013 the second order derivatives with respect to space implies the wave function ''and'' its first order spatial derivatives\n\n:<math> \\begin{align} \n& \\Psi(x_b,y_b,z_b,t) \\\\\n& \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\Psi(x_b,y_b,z_b,t) \\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\Psi(x_b,y_b,z_b,t) \\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\Psi(x_b,y_b,z_b,t) \n\\end{align} \\,\\!</math>\n\nare all arbitrary constants at a given set of points, where {{math|''x<sub>b</sub>''}}, {{math|''y<sub>b</sub>''}}, {{math|''z<sub>b</sub>''}} are a set of points describing boundary {{math|''b''}} (derivatives are evaluated at the boundaries). Typically there are one or two boundaries, such as the [[step potential]] and [[particle in a box]] respectively.\n\nAs the first order derivatives are arbitrary, the wave function can be a [[smooth function|continuously differentiable function]] of space, since at any boundary the gradient of the wave function can be matched.\n\nOn the contrary, wave equations in physics are usually ''second order in time'', notable are the family of classical [[wave equation]]s and the quantum [[Klein\u2013Gordon equation]].\n\n=== Local conservation of probability ===\n{{Main|Probability current|Continuity equation}}\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation is consistent with [[conservation of probability|probability conservation]]. Multiplying the Schr\u00f6dinger equation on the right by the complex conjugate wave function, and multiplying the wave function to the left of the complex conjugate of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and subtracting, gives the [[Continuity equation#Quantum mechanics|continuity equation]] for probability:<ref name=\"Quantum Mechanics 2004\">''Quantum Mechanics'', E. Abers, Pearson Ed., Addison Wesley, Prentice Hall Inc, 2004, {{isbn|978-0-13-146100-0}}</ref>\n:<math>{ \\partial \\over \\partial t} \\rho\\left(\\mathbf{r},t\\right) + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{j} = 0, </math>\nwhere \n:<math>\\rho=|\\Psi|^2=\\Psi^*(\\mathbf{r},t)\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)\\,\\!</math>\nis the [[probability density function|probability density]] (probability per unit volume, {{math|*}} denotes [[complex conjugate]]), and\n:<math> \\mathbf{j} = {1 \\over 2m} \\left( \\Psi^*\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\Psi  - \\Psi\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\Psi^* \\right)\\,\\!</math>\nis the [[probability current]] (flow per unit area).\n\nHence predictions from the Schr\u00f6dinger equation do not violate probability conservation.\n\n=== Positive energy ===\nIf the potential is bounded from below, meaning there is a minimum value of potential energy, the eigenfunctions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation have energy which is also bounded from below. This can be seen most easily by using the [[variational principle]], as follows. (See also below).\n\nFor any linear operator {{math|''\u00c2''}} [[Bounded operator|bounded]] from below, the eigenvector with the smallest eigenvalue is the vector {{math|''\u03c8''}} that minimizes the quantity\n\n:<math> \\langle \\psi |\\hat{A}|\\psi \\rangle </math>\n\nover all {{math|''\u03c8''}} which are [[normalizable wave function|normalized]].<ref name=\"Quantum Mechanics 2004\"/> In this way, the smallest eigenvalue is expressed through the [[variational principle]]. For the Schr\u00f6dinger Hamiltonian {{math|''\u0124''}} bounded from below, the smallest eigenvalue is called the ground state energy. That energy is the minimum value of\n\n:<math>\\langle \\psi|\\hat{H}|\\psi\\rangle = \\int \\psi^*(\\mathbf{r}) \\left[ - \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) + V(\\mathbf{r})\\psi(\\mathbf{r})\\right] d^3\\mathbf{r} = \\int \\left[ \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}|\\nabla\\psi|^2 + V(\\mathbf{r}) |\\psi|^2 \\right] d^3\\mathbf{r} = \\langle \\hat{H}\\rangle </math>\n\n(using [[integration by parts]]). Due to the [[Absolute value#Complex numbers|complex modulus]] of {{math|''\u03c8''<sup>2</sup>}} (which is positive definite), the right hand side is always greater than the lowest value of {{math|''V''(''x'')}}. In particular, the ground state energy is positive when {{math|''V''(''x'')}} is everywhere positive.\n\nFor potentials which are bounded below and are not infinite over a region, there is a ground state which minimizes the integral above. This lowest energy wave function is real and positive definite \u2013 meaning the wave function can increase and decrease, but is positive for all positions. It physically cannot be negative: if it were, smoothing out the bends at the sign change (to minimize the wave function) rapidly reduces the gradient contribution to the integral and hence the kinetic energy, while the potential energy changes linearly and less quickly. The kinetic and potential energy are both changing at different rates, so the total energy is not constant, which can't happen (conservation). The solutions are consistent with Schr\u00f6dinger equation if this wave function is positive definite.\n\nThe lack of sign changes also shows that the ground state is nondegenerate, since if there were two ground states with common energy {{math|''E''}}, not proportional to each other, there would be a linear combination of the two that would also be a ground state resulting in a zero solution.\n\n===Analytic continuation to diffusion===\n{{see also|path integral formulation#The Schr\u00f6dinger equation|label 1=Path integral formulation (The Schr\u00f6dinger equation)}}\n\nThe above properties (positive definiteness of energy) allow the [[analytic continuation]] of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to be identified as a [[stochastic process]]. This can be interpreted as the [[Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle]] applied to De Broglie waves; the spreading wavefronts are diffusive probability amplitudes.<ref name=\"Quantum Mechanics 2004\"/> \nFor a free particle (not subject to a potential) in a [[random walk]], substituting {{math|''\u03c4'' {{=}} ''it''}} into the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation gives:<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.82.011132 |pmid=20866590|url=http://www.stt.msu.edu/~mcubed/Relativistic.pdf|title=Stochastic models for relativistic diffusion|journal=Physical Review E|volume=82|issue=1 Pt 1|pages=011132|year=2010|last1=Baeumer|first1=Boris|last2=Meerschaert|first2=Mark M.|last3=Naber|first3=Mark|bibcode=2010PhRvE..82a1132B}}</ref>\n\n:<math> {\\partial \\over \\partial \\tau} X(\\mathbf{r},\\tau) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2m} \\nabla ^2 X(\\mathbf{r},\\tau) \\, , \\quad X(\\mathbf{r},\\tau) = \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},\\tau/i)</math>\n\nwhich has the same form as the [[diffusion equation]], with diffusion coefficient {{math|{{sfrac|''\u0127''|2''m''}}}}.\n\n===Regularity===\nOn the space <math>L^2</math> of square-integrable densities, the Schr\u00f6dinger semigroup <math>e^{it\\hat{H}}</math> is a unitary evolution, and therefore surjective. The flows satisfy the Schr\u00f6dinger equation <math>i\\partial_t u = \\hat{H}u</math>, where the derivative is taken in the [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] sense. However, since <math>\\hat{H}</math> for most physically reasonable Hamiltonians (e.g., the [[Laplace operator]], possibly modified by a potential) is unbounded in <math>L^2</math>, this shows that the semigroup flows lack Sobolev regularity in general. Instead, solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation satisfy a [[Strichartz estimate]].\n\n==Relativistic quantum mechanics==\n[[Relativistic quantum mechanics]] is obtained where quantum mechanics and [[special relativity]] simultaneously apply. In general, one wishes to build [[relativistic wave equations]] from the relativistic [[energy\u2013momentum relation]]\n\n:<math>E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2 \\, , </math>\n\ninstead of classical energy equations. The [[Klein\u2013Gordon equation]] and the [[Dirac equation]] are two such equations. The Klein\u2013Gordon equation,\n\n:<math> \\frac {1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} \\psi - \\nabla^2 \\psi + \\frac {m^2 c^2}{\\hbar^2} \\psi = 0. </math>,\n\nwas the first such equation to be obtained, even before the nonrelativistic one, and applies to massive spinless particles. The Dirac equation arose from taking the \"square root\" of the Klein\u2013Gordon equation by factorizing the entire relativistic wave operator into a product of two operators \u2013 one of these is the operator for the entire Dirac equation. Entire Dirac equation:\n:<math>\\left(\\beta mc^2 + c\\left(\\sum_{n \\mathop =1}^{3}\\alpha_n p_n\\right)\\right) \\psi = i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial\\psi }{\\partial t} </math>\n\nThe general form of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation remains true in relativity, but the Hamiltonian is less obvious. For example, the Dirac Hamiltonian for a particle of mass {{math|''m''}} and electric charge {{math|''q''}} in an electromagnetic field (described by the [[electromagnetic potential]]s {{math|''\u03c6''}} and {{math|'''A'''}}) is:\n\n:<math>\\hat{H}_{\\text{Dirac}}= \\gamma^0 \\left[c  \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}\\cdot\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} - q \\mathbf{A}\\right) + mc^2 + \\gamma^0q \\varphi \\right]\\,, </math>\n\nin which the {{math|'''\u03b3''' {{=}} (''\u03b3''<sup>1</sup>, ''\u03b3''<sup>2</sup>, ''\u03b3''<sup>3</sup>)}} and {{math|''\u03b3''<sup>0</sup>}} are the Dirac [[gamma matrices]] related to the spin of the particle. The Dirac equation is true for all {{nobreak|[[spin-1/2|spin-{{frac|2}}]]}} particles, and the solutions to the equation are {{nobreak|4-component}} [[spinor field]]s with two components corresponding to the particle and the other two for the [[antiparticle]].\n\nFor the Klein\u2013Gordon equation, the general form of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is inconvenient to use, and in practice the Hamiltonian is not expressed in an analogous way to the Dirac Hamiltonian. The equations for relativistic quantum fields can be obtained in other ways, such as starting from a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian density]] and using the [[Euler\u2013Lagrange equation]]s for fields, or use the [[representation theory of the Lorentz group]] in which certain representations can be used to fix the equation for a free particle of given spin (and mass).\n\nIn general, the Hamiltonian to be substituted in the general Schr\u00f6dinger equation is not just a function of the position and momentum operators (and possibly time), but also of spin matrices. Also, the solutions to a relativistic wave equation, for a massive particle of spin {{math|''s''}}, are complex-valued {{nobreak|{{math|2(2''s'' + 1)}}-component}} [[spinor field]]s.\n\n==Quantum field theory==\nThe general equation is also valid and used in [[quantum field theory]], both in relativistic and nonrelativistic situations. However, the solution {{math|''\u03c8''}} is no longer interpreted as a \"wave\", but should be interpreted as an operator acting on states existing in a [[Fock space]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==First order form==\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation can also be derived from a first order form<ref  name=\"one\">{{cite journal|last1=Ajaib|first1=Muhammad Adeel|title=A Fundamental Form of the Schr\u00f6dinger Equation|journal=Found.

The memoir concerns Westover overcoming her survivalist [[Mormons|Mormon]] family to go to college. It details her journey from her isolated life in the mountains of [[Idaho]] to getting into the PhD program at [[Cambridge University]]. Westover describes her journey of having no formal education to suddenly being in college at the age of seventeen; as well as her struggles to fit into the world her radical survivalist father created for her and the world beyond the mountains.\n\nAs of February 2020, it has spent 100 weeks on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Non-Fiction Best Seller list]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2020/02/02/combined-print-and-e-book-nonfiction/ |title=Combined Print & E-Book Nonfiction - Best Sellers |date=February 2, 2020 |website=[[The New York Times Book Review]] |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=January 24, 2020}}</ref> It won a 2019 [[Alex Awards|Alex Award]] and was shortlisted for the 2019 [[PEN/Jean Stein Book Award]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe memoir is told in three parts. The first part describes Westover's birth on Buck's Peak, a mountain in rural [[Idaho]], until the point at which she was accepted at [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU). She describes being raised by her parents, Gene and Faye Westover ([[Pseudonym|pseudonyms]]), and how her father had a strong paranoia of hospitals, the [[Education in the United States|public school system]], and the [[United States federal government|government]] due to the events of [[Ruby Ridge]]. Convinced that the government used the public school system to brainwash children, Tara was [[homeschool]]ed by her mother and taught the \"rhythms of the mountain\" by her father. She also describes sneaking away to visit her paternal grandparents, how she did not receive a [[birth certificate]] until she was about nine, and how her mother received a serious brain injury that her father refused to get seen by a hospital. Her attempts to attend school or seek normalcy in her life were denied by her father, who would later become depressed when the [[Year 2000 problem|Y2K apocalypse]] did not occur and also would refuse to take Westover to the hospital after she received a neck injury from a car accident. Westover's injury is fixed by her estranged brother Shawn and the two initially grow closer, only for Shawn to start [[Physical abuse|physically abusing]] her and call her a \"whore\" when she begins growing close with Charles, a boy she met while performing in theater. The abuse is discovered by another of her brothers, Tyler, who encourages her to leave home and to take the [[ACT (test)|ACT]] so she could apply to BYU. She ultimately succeeds in getting into BYU, as well as growing close again with Shawn after he stands up to their father on her behalf and when she takes Shawn to the hospital after a serious motorcycle accident.\n\nPart two covers Westover's time in BYU until she begins attending school at [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]] and receives financial awards that will allow her to remain there. She describes the stress she felt from the pressure of having to maintain her grades in order to keep her scholarship, as well as the issues she runs into due to her [[Social alienation|alienation]] from the outside world and lack of formal schooling. She manages to get high enough grades to receive a half-scholarship and Westover reconnects with Charles, with whom she begins a relationship that she cannot act romantically/physically upon because of her conservative upbringing. She also begins to question the abuse she continues to receive from both her father and Shawn, abuse that results in breaking off her relationship with Charles. Meanwhile Shawn begins to date a younger girl, Emily. Westover discovers that one of her teeth is rotting, the pain from which causes her to fall behind in school. She initially refuses any financial assistance from her church and suggestions that she apply for government assistance but later chooses to seek out assistance after returning to Buck's Peak for Christmas. Westover eventually realizes that she no longer sees Buck's Peak as her home and also begins to suspect that her father has [[bipolar disorder]]. Attempts to talk to him end with Westover temporarily cutting ties with her father. They reconnect after her father gets into a potentially fatal accident and he expresses interest in her life at school; however, she's dismayed when Shawn proposes to and marries Emily, despite Emily's occasional fear of him. Though some of her more conservative friends discourage her from pursuing the fields of history and politics, Westover confides in her [[Jewish history]] professor Dr. Paul Kerry about her entire past. Dr. Kerry encourages her to apply for the study abroad program at the [[University of Cambridge]]. After arriving at [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]], Tara is assigned to work with Professor [[Jonathan Steinberg]] who, along with Dr. Kerry, encourages her to graduate school from either Cambridge or [[Harvard University|Harvard]], especially because Steinberg would take care of all her fees. Despite some initial self-doubt, Westover applies for and wins the [[Gates Cambridge Scholarship|Gates Scholarship]]. She also makes a temporary truce with her father, as the two had a falling out over how she spoke about her past to local newspapers and news outlets and choosing to go to school in [[England]]. Her father states that if/when the [[End Days]] arrive, her family wouldn't be able to save her if she was in England.\n\nPart three covers Westover's life in Cambridge and her life after successfully graduating with a PhD. During this time she becomes more interested in [[feminism]] and discovers [[Bob Marley and the Wailers|Bob Marley's]] \"[[Redemption Song]]\", which prompts her to learn that Marley died after refusing traditional medicine, which then convinces her to finally get her [[Vaccination|vaccinations]]. She occasionally returns to Buck's Peak, where she discovers that Shawn is still abusing Emily and that her sister Audrey was aware of her abuse, but that their mother did not believe her. This results in Westover and her mother emailing each other and her mother referencing the possibility that her father has a mental illness, as well as saying that she and her father are going to get help for Shawn. On another trip she learns that her mother's essential oil business, something she had gotten after her accident and believed was responsible for Westover's father surviving the near fatal accident, has grown large and powerful. Westover also learns from Audrey that no one believed them about Shawn's abuse and her sister begs her to stay, only for Westover to leave to resume school at Cambridge. On her next trip to see her family Shawn briefly shows signs that he could be changing, only for him to later accuse Audrey of lying and threatening to kill her. Westover's attempts to tell her parents about Shawn's threat on Audrey's life are not taken seriously. They inform her that Shawn wants to speak with her over what she's said and Shawn brings with him a bloody knife that Westover later discovers he used to kill his family's dog while his son watched. Terrified of what he would do, Westover lies and claims that her father lied about what was said. She also later realizes that her mother had never been on her or Audrey's side. After returning to England Shawn makes a threat to Westover's life and her parents begin to deny the existence of the knife. Her sister Audrey also cuts Tara out of her life, as she is now going to forgive Shawn and believes that Westover was being controlled by [[Satan]], making her realize that she has now lost her whole family. Eventually Westover begins school at Harvard and her parents briefly visit her, during which time they unsuccessfully try to re-convert her to their lifestyle. This causes her to enter a deep depression that causes her to skip classes and have night terrors, leading her to return to Buck's Peak. Once there she discovers a series of emails between her mother and one of Shawn's ex-girlfriends, whom Westover had spoken to while trying to come to terms with Shawn's abuse and believed to be supportive of her. The emails instead show that Westover is being delusional and demonizing Shawn, which cause her to realize that she is now completely different from her family. She returns to Harvard and eventually returns to England, where she has [[panic attack]]s and emails her parents stating that she was cutting them out of her life for a year till she got a handle again. She begins failing her PhD program, however a series of emails from her brother Tyler to Westover and their parents where he supports her and condemns their treatment cause her to get her life back together and successfully graduate with her PhD. Years later Westover returns to Idaho for her maternal grandmother's funeral, where she is reunited with Tyler and his wife, as well two of her maternal aunts. She is also reunited with her siblings, most of whom still take their father and Shawn's side. At the end of the book Westover states that she is only in contact with a few of her family members and that she has finally accepted that she needed to be away from the mountain to live in peace, as well as not feel guilty for taking care of herself over her family.\n\n== People featured in the book ==\n\n=== Westover Family===\n\n* Tara Westover: Writer of memoir and protagonist. Tara was born in Idaho, homeschooled till she was seventeen before she took the ACT and got into college.\n* Gene Westover (pseudonym): Tara's father, a man of paranoia. Although he encouraged his children to learn, he did not believe in the public education system or even doctors. He owns a scrapyard in Idaho that scraps for metals.\n* Faye Westover (pseudonym): Tara's mother, a midwife and herbal specialist. Faye was raised in a prim home and married Gene as a way to escape that lifestyle. She teaches her children at home.\n* Tyler Westover: Tara's older brother, the third brother of the seven siblings. Tyler is the first to go to college, and he is the one who encourages and convinces Tara to take the ACT. He is also the first of her family to stand firmly by her side against her parents and Shawn.\n* Shawn Westover (pseudonym): Tara's older brother, the second brother of the siblings. Shawn is overprotective of Tara's virtue and very similar to their father. Was physically, mentally and emotionally abusive towards Tara, and later on his wife. Suffered a major head injury.\n* Richard Westover: Tara's older brother, fifth of the brothers. Richard remains loyal to the Mormon religion, but eventually gives up his family's isolation and marries while pursuing a higher education.\n* Luke Westover: Tara's older brother, the fourth brother. Luke is depicted as the brother who caught fire in the scrapyard and Tara had to help her mother nurse him back to health.\n* Audrey Westover (pseudonym): Tara's only (older) sister. She helps her mother with her herbal business. Tara and Audrey were never very close, however, they both stand together when they tell their mother about Shawn's abuse he inflicted on both of them. Audrey later goes on to cut Tara out of her life so she doesn't get disowned by their parents.\n* Tony Westover: Tara's oldest brother, first of the siblings. Tony is not really mentioned in the memoir, except that he helps his father in the scrapyard.\n* Grandma-down-the-hill: Gene's mother. She often disagrees with Gene about how he is raising his children, she encourages Tara to get an education and to escape so she can live a normal life.\n* Grandma-over-in-town: Faye's mother. A very prim and proper woman who Tara didn't really connect with when she was growing up. She doesn't approve of Gene and had an estranged relationship with Faye after she married Gene.\n*Aunt Debbie: Faye's estranged sister. After Tara distanced herself from her family, Debbie accepted Tara and Tyler with open arms, and even helps Tara get her passport so she can study abroad.\n*Aunt Angie: Faye's other estranged sister. Angie was outcasted from the family after filing for unemployment from the government after being fired from the family business, this caused Gene to think that Angie was trying to put him on a government watchlist.\n\n=== Other major people ===\n\n* Charles: Tara's first \"boyfriend\". Clouded by Tara's fathers teachings, Tara is never able to get intimate with Charles. She ends up distancing herself from him when Shawn's abuse gets worse and he tries to tell her that Shawn's behavior wasn't normal. They remain friends to this day.\n*Drew: Tara's boyfriend during the third part of the memoir. He is the first boyfriend that she actually reveals the truth about her family and her upbringing.\n* Dr. Kerry: A professor of Tara's at BYU. He helps get Tara a spot in the study abroad program to Cambridge, and encourages/supports her in her academic career.\n*[[Jonathan Steinberg|Dr. Jonathan Steinberg]]: An advisor of Tara's at Cambridge. He is known for his writings on the Holocaust and takes an interest in Tara's education. \n* Erin: One of Shawn's ex-girlfriends. Tara reaches out to her in hopes she will help corroborate Tara's timeline of Shawn's abuse. While she \"helps\" Tara, she also is communicating with Faye about how Tara is \"demonizing\" Shawn.\n*Sadie: Another one of Shawn's ex-girlfriends. She is one of the first people mentioned in the memoir who experienced Shawn's psychological abuse. \n* Robin: Tara's second-year roommate.

The memoir concerns Westover overcoming her survivalist [[Mormons|Mormon]] family to go to college. It details her journey from her isolated life in the mountains of [[Idaho]] to getting into the PhD program at [[Cambridge University]]. Westover describes her journey of having no formal education to suddenly being in college at the age of seventeen; as well as her struggles to fit into the world her radical survivalist father created for her and the world beyond the mountains.\n\nAs of February 2020, it has spent 100 weeks on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Non-Fiction Best Seller list]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2020/02/02/combined-print-and-e-book-nonfiction/ |title=Combined Print & E-Book Nonfiction - Best Sellers |date=February 2, 2020 |website=[[The New York Times Book Review]] |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=January 24, 2020}}</ref> It won a 2019 [[Alex Awards|Alex Award]] and was shortlisted for the 2019 [[PEN/Jean Stein Book Award]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe memoir is told in three parts. The first part describes Westover's birth on Buck's Peak, a mountain in rural [[Idaho]], until the point at which she was accepted at [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU). She describes being raised by her parents, Gene and Faye Westover ([[Pseudonym|pseudonyms]]), and how her father had a strong paranoia of hospitals, the [[Education in the United States|public school system]], and the [[United States federal government|government]] due to the events of [[Ruby Ridge]]. Convinced that the government used the public school system to brainwash children, Tara was [[homeschool]]ed by her mother and taught the \"rhythms of the mountain\" by her father. She also describes sneaking away to visit her paternal grandparents, how she did not receive a [[birth certificate]] until she was about nine, and how her mother received a serious brain injury that her father refused to get seen by a hospital. Her attempts to attend school or seek normalcy in her life were denied by her father, who would later become depressed when the [[Year 2000 problem|Y2K apocalypse]] did not occur and also would refuse to take Westover to the hospital after she received a neck injury from a car accident. Westover's injury is fixed by her estranged brother Shawn and the two initially grow closer, only for Shawn to start [[Physical abuse|physically abusing]] her and call her a \"whore\" when she begins growing close with Charles, a boy she met while performing in theater. The abuse is discovered by another of her brothers, Tyler, who encourages her to leave home and to take the [[ACT (test)|ACT]] so she could apply to BYU. She ultimately succeeds in getting into BYU, as well as growing close again with Shawn after he stands up to their father on her behalf and when she takes Shawn to the hospital after a serious motorcycle accident.\n\nPart two covers Westover's time in BYU until she begins attending school at [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]] and receives financial awards that will allow her to remain there. She describes the stress she felt from the pressure of having to maintain her grades in order to keep her scholarship, as well as the issues she runs into due to her [[Social alienation|alienation]] from the outside world and lack of formal schooling. She manages to get high enough grades to receive a half-scholarship and Westover reconnects with Charles, with whom she begins a relationship that she cannot act romantically/physically upon because of her conservative upbringing. She also begins to question the abuse she continues to receive from both her father and Shawn, abuse that results in breaking off her relationship with Charles. Meanwhile Shawn begins to date a younger girl, Emily. Westover discovers that one of her teeth is rotting, the pain from which causes her to fall behind in school. She initially refuses any financial assistance from her church and suggestions that she apply for government assistance but later chooses to seek out assistance after returning to Buck's Peak for Christmas. Westover eventually realizes that she no longer sees Buck's Peak as her home and also begins to suspect that her father has [[bipolar disorder]]. Attempts to talk to him end with Westover temporarily cutting ties with her father. They reconnect after her father gets into a potentially fatal accident and he expresses interest in her life at school; however, she's dismayed when Shawn proposes to and marries Emily, despite Emily's occasional fear of him. Though some of her more conservative friends discourage her from pursuing the fields of history and politics, Westover confides in her [[Jewish history]] professor Dr. Paul Kerry about her entire past. Dr. Kerry encourages her to apply for the study abroad program at the [[University of Cambridge]]. After arriving at [[King's College]], Tara is assigned to work with Professor [[Jonathan Steinberg]] who, along with Dr. Kerry, encourages her to graduate school from either Cambridge or [[Harvard University|Harvard]], especially because Steinberg would take care of all her fees. Despite some initial self-doubt, Westover applies for and wins the [[Gates Cambridge Scholarship|Gates Scholarship]]. She also makes a temporary truce with her father, as the two had a falling out over how she spoke about her past to local newspapers and news outlets and choosing to go to school in [[England]]. Her father states that if/when the [[End Days]] arrive, her family wouldn't be able to save her if she was in England.\n\nPart three covers Westover's life in Cambridge and her life after successfully graduating with a PhD. During this time she becomes more interested in [[feminism]] and discovers [[Bob Marley and the Wailers|Bob Marley's]] \"[[Redemption Song]]\", which prompts her to learn that Marley died after refusing traditional medicine, which then convinces her to finally get her [[Vaccination|vaccinations]]. She occasionally returns to Buck's Peak, where she discovers that Shawn is still abusing Emily and that her sister Audrey was aware of her abuse, but that their mother did not believe her. This results in Westover and her mother emailing each other and her mother referencing the possibility that her father has a mental illness, as well as saying that she and her father are going to get help for Shawn. On another trip she learns that her mother's essential oil business, something she had gotten after her accident and believed was responsible for Westover's father surviving the near fatal accident, has grown large and powerful. Westover also learns from Audrey that no one believed them about Shawn's abuse and her sister begs her to stay, only for Westover to leave to resume school at Cambridge. On her next trip to see her family Shawn briefly shows signs that he could be changing, only for him to later accuse Audrey of lying and threatening to kill her. Westover's attempts to tell her parents about Shawn's threat on Audrey's life are not taken seriously. They inform her that Shawn wants to speak with her over what she's said and Shawn brings with him a bloody knife that Westover later discovers he used to kill his family's dog while his son watched. Terrified of what he would do, Westover lies and claims that her father lied about what was said. She also later realizes that her mother had never been on her or Audrey's side. After returning to England Shawn makes a threat to Westover's life and her parents begin to deny the existence of the knife. Her sister Audrey also cuts Tara out of her life, as she is now going to forgive Shawn and believes that Westover was being controlled by [[Satan]], making her realize that she has now lost her whole family. Eventually Westover begins school at Harvard and her parents briefly visit her, during which time they unsuccessfully try to re-convert her to their lifestyle. This causes her to enter a deep depression that causes her to skip classes and have night terrors, leading her to return to Buck's Peak. Once there she discovers a series of emails between her mother and one of Shawn's ex-girlfriends, whom Westover had spoken to while trying to come to terms with Shawn's abuse and believed to be supportive of her. The emails instead show that Westover is being delusional and demonizing Shawn, which cause her to realize that she is now completely different from her family. She returns to Harvard and eventually returns to England, where she has [[panic attack]]s and emails her parents stating that she was cutting them out of her life for a year till she got a handle again. She begins failing her PhD program, however a series of emails from her brother Tyler to Westover and their parents where he supports her and condemns their treatment cause her to get her life back together and successfully graduate with her PhD. Years later Westover returns to Idaho for her maternal grandmother's funeral, where she is reunited with Tyler and his wife, as well two of her maternal aunts. She is also reunited with her siblings, most of whom still take their father and Shawn's side. At the end of the book Westover states that she is only in contact with a few of her family members and that she has finally accepted that she needed to be away from the mountain to live in peace, as well as not feel guilty for taking care of herself over her family.\n\n== People featured in the book ==\n\n=== Westover Family===\n\n* Tara Westover: Writer of memoir and protagonist.

{"title_page": "Structural inequality", "text_new": "{{Globalize|date=November 2017}}\n\n'''Structural inequality''' is defined as a condition where one category of people are attributed an unequal status in relation to other categories of people. This relationship is perpetuated and reinforced by a confluence of unequal relations in roles, functions, decisions, rights, and opportunities.<ref>Dani, Anis A., and Arjan De. Haan, eds. Inclusive States: Social Policy and Structural Inequalities. Washington, D.C: World Bank, 2008. 3.</ref> As opposed to cultural inequality, which focuses on the individual decisions associated with these imbalances, structural inequality refers specifically to the inequalities that are systemically rooted in the normal operations of dominant social institutions, and can be divided into categories like [[residential segregation]] or healthcare, employment and  [[educational discrimination]].<ref>Royce, Edward Cary. Poverty and Power: the Problem of Structural Inequality. Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield, 2009. 217.</ref>\n\n[[Globalization]] has a complex association with development and inequality, and mandates a new framework to help describe its effects. On one level, global competition in production can lead to productivity improvements that lead to a situation where industrial employment falls behind industrial output in a local market.<ref name=\"Inequality 2010\">Combating Poverty and Inequality: Structural Change, Social Policy. Rep. no. 978-92-9085-076-2. Geneva: United Nations Research Institute for Social Development, 2010. Web. 3 Nov. 2011.</ref> This can have an enormous impact on developing economies that focus on industrialization. At the same time, the liberalization of trade policies may be the only method of securing growth for land-locked developing nations.<ref name=\"Collier, Paul 2007\">Collier, Paul. 2007. The Bottom Billion: Why the Poorest Countries are Failing and What Can Be Done About It. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nCombating structural inequality therefore often requires the broad, policy based [[structural change]] on behalf of government organizations, and is often a critical component of [[poverty reduction]].<ref name=\"Inequality 2010\"/> In many ways, a well-organized democratic government that can effectively combine moderate growth with redistributive policies stands the best chance of combating structural inequality.<ref name=\"Inequality 2010\"/>\n\n==Education==\nSee: [[Structural inequality in education]]<br />\nOne particularly influential form of structural inequality can be found in education, since education affects many other opportunities. Examples of institutionalized education-related racism include student tracking, access to college, access to technology, and school finance.\n\n==Spatial/regional==\nGlobally, the problem of spatial and regional segregation is largely a question between urban and rural disparities. A study commissioned by the United Nations University WIDER project has shown that for the twenty-six countries included in the study, spatial inequalities have been high and on the increase, especially for developing nations. Many of these inequalities were traced back to \u201csecond nature\u201d geographic forces that describe the infrastructure a society has in place for facilitating the trade of goods and employment between economic agents.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kanbur | first1 = Ravi | last2 = Venables | first2 = Tony | author-link1 = Ravi Kanbur | author-link2 = Anthony Venables | title = Spatial inequality and development | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | series = UNU-WIDER Studies in Development Economics | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780199278633 }}</ref> Another dominant and related factor is the ease of access to bodies of water and forms of long distance trade like ports. The discrepancies between the growth of communities close to these bodies of water  and those further away have been noted in cases between and within countries.<ref name=\"Collier, Paul 2007\"/> In the United States and many other developed countries, spatial inequality has developed into more specific forms described by residential segregation and housing discrimination. This has especially come into focus as education and employment are often tied into where a household is located relative to urban centers, and a variety of metrics, from education levels to welfare benefits have been correlated to spatial data.<ref>Adelman, Robert M., and Charles Jaret. \"Poverty, Race, and US Metropolitan Social and Economic Structure.\" Journal of Urban Affairs 21.1 (1999): Print.</ref>\n\n===Consequences===\nSpecifically, studies have identified a number of economic consequences of housing segregation. Perhaps the most obvious is the isolation of minorities, which creates a deficit in the potential for developing human capital. Second, many of the public schools that areas of low socioeconomic status have access to are underperforming, in part due to the limited budgeting the district receives from the limited tax base in the same area. Finally, another large factor is simply the wealth and security homeownership represents. Property values rarely increase in areas where poverty is high in the first place.<ref name=\"Massey\">Massey, Douglas S. 2004. \u201cThe New Geography of Inequality in Urban America,\u201c in C. Michael Henry, ed. Race, Poverty, and Domestic Policy. New Haven: Yale University Press.</ref>\n\n===Causes===\nThe causes of spatial inequality, however, are more complex. The mid-20th century phenomenon of the large-scale migration of white middle-class families from urban centers has coined the term [[white flight]]. While the current state of housing discrimination can be partly attributed to this phenomenon, a larger set of [[institutionalized discrimination]], like bias in loan and real estate industries and government policies, have helped to perpetuate the division created since then. These include bias found in the banking and real estate industries as well as discriminatory public policies that promote racial segregation.<ref>Massey 2004, p. 177.</ref> In addition, rising income inequality between blacks and whites since the 1970s have created affluent neighborhoods that tend to be composed of a homogeneous racial background of families within the same income bracket.<ref name=\"Massey 2004, p. 184\">Massey 2004, p. 184.</ref> A similar situation within the racial lines have helped to explain how more than 32% of blacks now live in suburbs. However, these new suburbs are often divided along racial lines, and a 1992 survey showed that 82% of blacks preferred to live a suburb where their race is in the majority.<ref>Cashin, Sheryll. \"Middle-Class Black Suburbs and the State of Integration: A Post-Integrationist Vision for Metropolitan America.\" (2001): 737.</ref> This is further aggravated by practices like [[racial steering]], in which realtors guide home buyers towards neighborhood based on race.\n\n===Transportation===\n{{see also|Transport divide}}\nGovernment policies that have tended to promote spatial inequalities include actions by the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA) in the United States in promoting [[redlining]], a practice where mortgages could be selectively administered while excluding certain urban neighborhood deemed risky, oftentimes because of race. Practices like this continued to prevent home buyers from getting mortgages in redlined areas until the 1960s, when the FHA discontinued the determination of restrictions based on racial composition.<ref>Wilson, William J. More than Just Race: Being Black and Poor in the Inner City. New York: Norton &, 2009. 28.</ref>\n\nThe advent of freeways also added a complex layer of incentives and barriers which helped to increase spatial inequalities. First, these new networks allowed for middle-class families to move out to the suburbs while retaining connections like employment to the urban center. Second, and perhaps more importantly, freeways were routed through minority neighborhoods, oftentimes creating barriers between these neighborhoods and central business districts and middle class areas. Highway plans often avoided a more direct route through upper or middle class neighbors because minorities did not have sufficient power to prevent such actions from happening.<ref>Wilson 2009, p. 29.</ref>\n\n===Solutions===\nMassey identifies three goals specifically for the United States to end residential segregation: reorganize the structure of metropolitan government, make greater investment in education, and finally open housing market so full participation<ref name=\"Massey 2004, p. 184\"/> More specifically, he advocates broader, metropolitan-wide units of taxation and governance where the tax base and decisions are made equally by both the urban and suburban population. Education is the key to closing employment inequalities in a post-manufacturing era. And finally, the federal government must take large strides towards enforcing the anti-segregation measures related to housing it has already put into place, like the [[Fair housing|Fair Housing Act]], the [[Home Mortgage Disclosure Act]], and the [[Community Reinvestment Act]].\nAnother set of divisions that may be useful in framing policy solutions include three categories: place-based policies, people-based policies, and indirect approaches.  Place-based policies include improving community facilities and services like schools and public safety in inner-city areas in an effort to appeal to middle-class families. These programs must be balanced with concerns of [[gentrification]]. People-based policies help increase access to credit for low-income families looking to move, and this sort of policy has been typified by the Community Reinvestment Act and its many revisions throughout its legislative history. Finally, indirect approaches often involve providing better transportation options to low-income areas, like public transit routes or subsidized car ownership. These approaches target the consequences rather than the causes of segregation, and rely on the assumption that one of the most harmful effects of spatial inequality is the lack of access to employment opportunities. In conclusion, a common feature in all of these is the investment in the capital and infrastructure of inner-city or neighborhood.<ref>\u201cRacial Residential Segregation in American Cities,\u201d in Oxford Handbook of Urban Economics and Planning, ed. Nancy Brooks and Gerrit-Jan Knaap (Oxford University Press, 2011), 318\u201339.</ref>\n\n==Healthcare==\nThe quality of healthcare that a patient receives strongly depends upon its accessibility. Kelley ''et al.'' define access to healthcare as \u201cthe timely use of personal health services to achieve the best health outcomes\u201d.<ref name=\"Kelley 2005\">Kelley, Ed, et al.  \"The National Healthcare Quality and Disparities Reports: An Overview.\" Medical Care 43.3 (2005): 13-18. JSTOR. Web. 2 Nov. 2011.</ref> [[Health disparities]], which are largely caused by unequal access to healthcare, can be defined as \u201ca difference in which disadvantaged social groups such as the poor, racial/ethnic minorities, women and other groups who have persistently experienced social disadvantage or discrimination systematically experience worse health or greater health risks than most advantaged social groups.\u201d <ref name=\"Kronenfeld, Jennie J. 2010\">Kronenfeld, Jennie J., ed. The Impact of Demographics on Health and Health Care: Race, Ethnicity and Other Social Factors. Bingley, UK: Emerald Group Limited, 2010. Print.</ref> Manifestations of inequality in healthcare appear throughout the world and are a topic of urgency in the United States. In fact, studies have shown that income-related inequality in healthcare expenditures favors the wealthy to a greater degree in the United States than most other Western nations.<ref>Chen, Alex Y., and Jos\u00e9 J. Escarce. \"Quantifying Income-Related Inequality in Healthcare Delivery in the United States.\" Medical Care 42.1 (2004): 38-47. JSTOR. Web. 2 Nov. 2011.</ref> The enormous costs of healthcare, coupled with the vast number of Americans lacking health insurance, indicate the severe inequality and serious problems that exist. The healthcare system in the United States perpetuates inequality by \u201crationing health care according to a person\u2019s ability to pay, by providing inadequate and inferior health care to poor people and persons of color, and by failing to establish structures that can meet the health needs of Americans\u201d.<ref>Aguirre Jr., Adalberto, and David V. Baker. Structured Inequality in the United States: Critical Discussions on the Continuing Significance of Race, Ethnicity, and Gender. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2008. Print.</ref>\n\n===Racial===\n[[Race and health|Racial disparity in access and quality of healthcare]] is a serious problem in the United States and is reflected by evidence such as the fact that African American life expectancies lag behind that of whites by over 5 years, and African Americans tend to experience more chronic conditions.  African Americans have a 30% higher death rate from cardiovascular disease and experience 50% more diabetic complications than their white counterparts.<ref name=\"Kronenfeld, Jennie J. 2010\"/> The [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] (AHRQ), directed by Congress, led an effort for the development of two annual reports by the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] (DHHS), the National Healthcare Quality Report and the National Healthcare Disparities Report, which tracked disparities in healthcare in relation to racial and socioeconomic factors. These reports developed about 140 measures of quality of care and about 100 measures of access to care, which were used to measure the healthcare disparities. The first reports, released in December 2003, found that blacks and Hispanics experienced poorer healthcare quality for about half of the quality measures reported in the NHQR and NDHR. Also, Hispanics and Asians experienced poorer access to care for about two thirds of the healthcare access measures.<ref name=\"Kelley 2005\"/> Recent studies on Medicare patients show that black patients receive poorer medical care than their white counterparts. Compared with white patients, blacks receive far fewer operations, tests, medications and other treatments, suffering greater illnesses and more deaths as a result.<ref>Aguirre and Baker</ref> Measures done by the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] (AHRQ) show that \u201cfewer than 20% of disparities faced by Blacks, AI/ANs and Hispanics showed evidence of narrowing.\u201d <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.ahrq.gov/research/findings/nhqrdr/nhqrdr10/minority.html|title=Disparities in Healthcare Quality Among Racial and Ethnic Minority Groups {{!}} AHRQ Archive|website=archive.ahrq.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-01-23}}</ref>\n\nOne specific study showed that African Americans are less likely than whites to be referred for cardiac catheterization and bypass grafting, prescription of analgesia for pain control, and surgical treatment of lung cancer. Both African Americans and Latinos also receive less pain medication than whites for long bone fractures and cancer. Other studies showed that African Americans are reported to receive fewer pediatric prescriptions, poorer quality of hospital care, fewer hospital admissions for chest pain, lower quality of prenatal care, and less appropriate management of congestive heart failure and pneumonia.<ref name=\"Wiliams, Richard A. 2007\">Wiliams, Richard A., ed. Eliminating Healthcare Disparities in America. Totowa, NJ: Humana, 2007. Print.</ref>\n\nLanguage-barriers became a large factor in the process of seeking healthcare due to the rise in minorities across the United States. In 2007, an estimate done by the Census Bureau stated that 33.6% of the United States belonged to racial ethnicities that were non-Hispanic whites. Of people within the United States during this time, 20% spoke a language different from English at home. Having a language-barrier can cause many hurdles when pertaining to healthcare: difficulty communicating with health professionals, sourcing/the funding of language assistance, having little to no access to translators, etc.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.ahrq.gov/research/findings/nhqrdr/nhqrdr10/minority.html|title=Disparities in Healthcare Quality Among Racial and Ethnic Minority Groups {{!}} AHRQ Archive|website=archive.ahrq.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-01-24}}</ref> A 2050 projection showed that over 50% of the United States would belong to a racial category other than non-Hispanic white. Thus, demonstrating the rapid increase of minorities over time within the United States and the importance of it.\n\n===Gender===\nIn addition to race, [[Gender disparities in health|healthcare inequality also manifests across gender lines]]. Though women tend to live longer than men, they tend to report poorer health status, more disabilities as they age, and tend to be higher utilizers of the healthcare system.<ref name=\"Bayne-Smith, Marcia 1996\">Bayne-Smith, Marcia, ed. Race, Gender, and Health. London: Sage Publications, 1996. Print.</ref> Healthcare disparities often put women at a disadvantage. Such time must be scheduled around work (whether formal or informal), child care needs, and the geography\u2014which increases the travel time necessary for those who do not live near healthcare facilities.<ref name=\"Bayne-Smith, Marcia 1996\"/> Furthermore, \u201cpoor women and their children tend to have inadequate housing, poor nutrition, poor sanitation, and high rates of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse.\u201d Since women and children constitute 80% of [[Poverty in the United States|the poor in the United States]], they are particularly susceptible to experiencing the negative impact of healthcare inequality.<ref name=\"Bayne-Smith, Marcia 1996\"/>\n\n===Spatial===\nSpatial distribution and geographic location also affect access and quality of healthcare. A study done by Rowland, Lyons, and Edwards (1988) found that rural patients were more likely to be poor and uninsured.<ref>Davis, Karen. \"Inequality and Access to Health Care.\" The Milbank Quarterly 69.2 (1991): 253-73. JSTOR. Web. 2 Nov. 2011.</ref> Because of the fewer healthcare resources available in rural areas, these patients received fewer medical services than urban patients.<ref name=\"Davis 1991\">Davis 1991</ref> Other studies showed that African Americans and Hispanics are more likely than whites to live in areas that are underserved by healthcare providers, forcing them to wait longer for care in crowded and/or understaffed facilities or traveling longer distances to receive care in other areas. This travel time often poses an obstacle to receiving medical care and often leads patients to delay care until later.<ref name=\"Kronenfeld, Jennie J. 2010\"/> In fact, African Americans and Hispanics are more likely than whites to delay seeking medical care until their condition becomes serious, rather than seeking regular medical care, because travel and wait times are both costly and an interference in other daily activities.<ref name=\"Kronenfeld, Jennie J. 2010\"/>\n\nAn individual's environment greatly impacts his or her health status. For example, three of the five largest landfills in the United States are situated in communities which are predominantly African American and Latino, contributing to some of the highest pediatric asthma rates in those groups.<ref name=\"Wiliams, Richard A. 2007\"/> Impoverished individuals who find themselves unable to leave their neighborhoods consequently are continuously exposed to the same harmful environment, which negatively impacts health.\n\n===Economic===\nSocioeconomic background is another source of inequality in healthcare. [[Diseases of poverty|Poverty significantly influences the production of disease]] since poverty increases the likelihood of having poor health in addition to decreasing the ability to afford preventative and routine healthcare.<ref name=\"Bayne-Smith, Marcia 1996\"/> Lack of access to healthcare has a significant negative impact on patients, especially those who are uninsured, since they are less likely to have a regular source of care, such as a [[primary care physician]], and are more likely to delay seeking care until their condition becomes life-threatening.<ref name=\"Wiliams, Richard A. 2007\"/>  Studies show that people with health insurance receive significantly more care than those who are uninsured, the most vulnerable groups being minorities, young adults, and low-income individuals. The same trend for uninsured versus insured patients holds true for children as well.<ref name=\"Davis 1991\"/>\n\nHadley, Steinberg, and Feder (1991) found that hospitalized patients who are not covered under health insurance are less likely to receive high-cost, specialized procedures and as a result, are more likely to die while hospitalized.<ref name=\"Davis 1991\"/> Feder, Hadley, and Mullner (1984) noticed that hospitals often ration free care by denying care to those who are unable to pay and cutting services commonly used by the uninsured poor.<ref name=\"Davis 1991\"/> Minorities are less likely to have health insurance because are less likely to occupy middle to upper income brackets, and therefore are incapable of purchasing health insurance, and also because they tend to hold low-paying jobs that do not provide health insurance as part of their job-related benefits. Census data show that 78.7% of whites are covered by private insurance compared with 54% of blacks and 51% of Hispanics. About 29% of Hispanics in the United States have neither private nor government health insurance of any kind.<ref name=\"Bayne-Smith, Marcia 1996\"/>\n\nA study done on Medicare recipients also showed that despite the uniform benefits offered, high-income elderly patients received 60% more physician services and 45% more days of hospital care than lower-income elderly patients not covered by Medicaid.<ref name=\"Davis 1991\"/> After adjustment for health status, people with higher incomes are shown to have higher expenditures, indicating that the wealthy are strongly favored in income-related inequality in medical care. However, this inequality differs across age groups. Inequality was shown to be greatest for senior citizens, then adults, and least for children. This pattern showed that financial resources and other associated attributes, such as educational attainment, were very influential in access and utilization of medical care.<ref>Chen and Escarce, 2004.</ref>\n\n===Solutions===\nThe acknowledgement that access to health services differed depending on race, geographic location, and socioeconomic background was an impetus in establishing health policies to benefit these vulnerable groups.<ref name=\"Davis 1991\"/> In 1965, specific programs, such as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]], were implemented in the United States in an attempt to extend health insurance to a greater portion of the population. Medicare is a federally funded program that provides health insurance for people aged 65 or older, people younger than 65 with certain disabilities, and people of any age who have End-Stage Renal Disease (ERSD). Medicaid, on the other hand, provides health coverage to certain low income people and families and is largely state-governed.<ref>\"Frequently Asked Questions About Medicare\" Medicare.gov. 26 Aug. 2008. Web. 2 Nov. 2011.</ref> However, studies have shown that for-profit hospitals tend to make healthcare less accessible to uninsured patients in addition to those under Medicaid in an effort to contain costs.<ref name=\"Davis 1991\"/> Another program, the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program|State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP) provides low cost health insurance to children in families who do not qualify for Medicaid but cannot afford private health insurance on their own.<ref>medicare.org</ref>\nThe necessity of achieving equity in quality of and access to healthcare is glaring and urgent. According to Fein (1972), this goal could include equal health outcomes for all by income group, equal expenditures per capita across income groups, or eliminating income as a healthcare rationing device. Some have proposed that a national health insurance plan with comprehensive benefits and no deductibles or other costs from the patients would provide the most equity.<ref name=\"Davis 1991\"/> Fein also stressed that healthcare reform was needed, specifically in eliminating financial assistance to treat patients that depended on patient income or the quantity of services given. He proposed instead paying physicians on a salaried basis.<ref name=\"Davis 1991\"/> \nAnother study, by Reynolds (1976), found that community health centers improved access to health care for many vulnerable groups, including youth, blacks, and people with serious diseases. The study indicated that community health centers provided more preventive care and greater continuity of care, though there were problems in obtaining adequate funding as well as adequate staffing.<ref name=\"Davis 1991\"/> Engaging the community to understand the link between social issues such as employment, education, and poverty can help motivate community members to advocate for policies that improve health status.<ref name=\"Wiliams, Richard A. 2007\"/>\n\nIncreasing the racial and ethnic diversity of healthcare providers can also serve as a potential solution. Racial and ethnic minority healthcare providers are much more likely than their white counterparts to serve minority communities, which can have many positive effects. Advocating for an increase in minority healthcare providers can help improve the quality of patient-physician communication as well as reduce the crowding in understaffed facilities in areas in which minorities reside. This can help decrease wait times as well as increase the likelihood that such patients will seek out nearby healthcare facilities rather than traveling farther distances as a last resort.<ref name=\"Wiliams, Richard A. 2007\"/>\n\nImplementing efforts to increase translation services can also improve quality of healthcare.<ref name=\"Bayne-Smith, Marcia 1996\"/> This means increased availability of bilingual and bicultural healthcare providers for non-English speakers. Studies show that non-English speaking patients self-reported better physical functioning, psychological well-being, health perceptions, and lower pain when receiving treatment from a physician who spoke their language. Hispanic patients specifically reported increased compliance to treatment plans when their physician spoke Spanish and also shared a similar background. Training programs to improve and broaden physicians\u2019 communication skills can increase patient satisfaction, patient compliance, patient participation in treatment decisions, and utilization of preventative care services <ref name=\"Wiliams, Richard A. 2007\"/>\n\nThe idea of [[universal health care]], which is implemented in many other countries, has been a subject of heated debate in the United States.\n\n==Employment==\nEmployment is a key source of income for a majority of the world's population, and therefore is the most direct method through which people can escape poverty. However, unequal access to decent work and persistent labor market inequalities frustrate efforts to reduce poverty.<ref>UNRISD 2004, p. 31.</ref> Studies have further divided employment segregation into two categories: first generation and second generation discrimination. First generation discrimination occurs as an overt bias displayed by employers, and since the end of the civil rights era has been on the decline. Second generation discrimination; on the other hand, is less direct and therefore much harder to legislate against. This helps explain the disparity between female hiring rates and male/female ratios, which have gone up recently, and the relative scarcity of women in upper-level management positions.<ref>Sturm, Susan. \"Second Generation Employment Discrimination: A Structural Approach.\" Columbia Law Review 101.3 (2001): 497.</ref> Therefore, while there is extensive legislation passed regarding employment discrimination, informal barriers still exist in the workplace. For instance, gender discrimination often takes the form of working hours and childcare-related benefits.<ref>Aguirre and Baker 2008, p. 200.</ref> In many cases, female professionals who must take maternity leave or single mothers who must care for their children often are at a disadvantage when it comes to promotions and advancement.\n\n===Education level===\n[[Employment discrimination]] is also closely linked to education and skills. One of the most important factors that can help describe employment disparities was that for much of the post-WWII-era, many Western countries began shedding the manufacturing jobs that provided relatively high-wage jobs to people with moderate to low job skills.<ref>Adelman p. 38.</ref> Starting from the 1960s, the United States began a shift away from low-wage jobs, especially in the manufacturing sector, towards technology-based or service-based employment.<ref>Wilson 2009, p. 70.</ref> This had an unbalanced effect of decreasing employment opportunities for the least educated in the labor force while at the same time increasing the productivity and therefore wages of the skilled labor force, increasing the level of inequality.<ref>Marshall, F. Ray. Back to Shared Prosperity: the Growing Inequality of Wealth and Income in America. Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, 2000. Print. 6.</ref> In addition, globalization has tended to compound this decrease in demand of domestic unskilled labor.\n\nFinally, weak labor market policies since the 70's and 80's have failed to address the income inequalities that those who are employed at lower income levels have to face. Namely, the union movement began to shrink, decreasing the power for employees to negotiate employment terms, and the minimum wage was prevented from increasing alongside inflation.<ref>Wilson 2009, p. 15</ref>\n\n===Racial===\nOther barriers include [[human capital]] occupations that require an extensive network for developing clientele, like lawyers, physicians, and salesmen. Studies have shown that for blacks and whites in the same occupation, whites can often benefit for a wealthier pool of clients and connections.<ref>Grodsky, Eric and Devah Pager. 2001. \u201cThe Structure of Disadvantage: Individual and Occupational Determinants of the Black-White Wage Gap.\u201d American Sociological Review:66(4):542-567.</ref> In addition, studies show that only a small percentage of low-skilled employees are hired through advertisements or cold calls, highlighting the importance of social connections with middle- and upper- class employers.<ref>Wilson 2009, p. 75.</ref>\n\n===Gender===\nThough women have become an increasing presence in the workforce, there currently exists a gender gap in earnings. Statistics show that women who work full-time year-round earn 75% of the income as their male counterparts.<ref>Jacobs, Jerry A. Gender Inequality at Work. London: Sage Publications, 1995. Print. 9.</ref> Part of the gender gap in employment earnings is due to women concentrating in different occupational fields than men, which is known as [[occupational segregation]].<ref>Reese, Laura. Equity in the Workplace: Gendering Workplace Policy Analysis. Ed. Heidi Gottfried. New York: Lexington, 2004. Print. 152.</ref> The 1990 Census data show that more than 50% of women would have to change jobs before women would be distributed in the same way as men within the job market, achieving complete gender integration.<ref>Jacobs 1995, p. 9.</ref> This can be attributed to the tendency of women to choose degrees that funnel into jobs that are less lucrative than those chosen by men.<ref>Jacobs 1995, p. 5.</ref>\n\nOther studies have shown that the Hay system, which evaluates jobs, undervalues the occupations that tend to be filled by women, which continues to bias wages against women's work.<ref>Jacobs 1995, p. 10.</ref> Once a certain job becomes associated with women, its social value decreases.  Almost all studies show that the percentage of women is correlated with lower earnings for both males and females even in fields that required significant job skills, which suggests a strong effect of gender composition on earnings.<ref>Jacobs 1995, p. 26.</ref>\nAdditionally, women tend to be hired into less desirable jobs than men and are denied access to more skilled jobs or jobs that place them in an authoritative role. In general, women tend to hold fewer positions of power when compared to men. A study done by Reskin and Ross (1982) showed that when tenure and productivity-related measurements were controlled, women had less authority and earned less than men of equal standing in their occupation.<ref>Jacobs 1995, p. 11.</ref> Exclusionary practices provide the most valuable job openings and career opportunities for members of groups of higher status which, in the United States, mostly means Caucasian males. Therefore, males are afforded more advantages than females and perpetuate this cycle while they still hold more social power, allocating lower-skilled and lower-paying jobs to females and minorities.<ref>Jacobs 1995, p. 29.</ref>\n\n===Inequality in investment of skills===\nAnother factor of the [[gender pay gap|gender earnings gap]] is reflected in the difference in job skills between women and men. Studies suggest that women invest less in their own occupational training because they stay in the workforce for a shorter period of time than men (because of marriage or rearing children) and therefore have a shorter time span to benefit from their extra efforts.<ref>Jacobs 1995, p. 6.</ref> However, there is also discrimination by the employer. Studies have shown that the earnings gap is also due to employers investing less money in training female employees, which leads to a gender disparity in accessing career development opportunities.<ref>Jacobs 1995, p. 7.</ref>\n\n===Prescribed gender roles===\nWomen tend to stay in the workforce for less time than men due to marriage or the time devoted to raising children. Consequently, men are typically viewed as the \u201cbreadwinners\u201d of the family, which is reflected in the employee benefits provided in careers that are traditionally occupied by males. A study done by Heidi M. Berggren, assessing the employee benefits provided to nurses (a traditional female career) and automobile mechanics and repairmen (a traditional male career), found that the latter provided more significant benefits such as health insurance and other medical emergency benefits whereas the former provided more access to sick leave with full pay.<ref>Gottfried and Reese 2004, p. 164.</ref> This outlines the roles allotted to women as the caregivers and the men as the providers of the family which subsequently encourages men to seek gainful employment while encouraging women to have a larger role at home than in the workplace. Many parental leave policies in the US are poorly developed and reinforce the roles of men as the breadwinner and women as the caregiver.<ref>Gottfried and Reese 2004, p. 207.</ref>\n\n===Glass ceiling===\nWomen have often described subtle gender barriers in career advancement, known as the [[glass ceiling]]. This refers to the limited mobility of women in the workforce due to social restrictions that limit their opportunities and affect their career decisions.<ref name=\"Gottfried and Reese 2004, p. 134\">Gottfried and Reese 2004, p. 134.</ref>\n\n===Solutions===\nA study done by Doorne-Huiskes, den Dulk, and Schippers (1999) showed that in countries with government policy addressing the balance between work and family life, women have high participation in the work force and there is a smaller gender wage gap, indicating that such policy could encourage mothers to stay in their occupations while also encouraging men to take on a greater child-rearing role. Such measure include mandating employers to provide paid parental leave for employees so that both parents can care for children without risk to their careers. Another suggested measure is government-provided day care for children aged 0\u20136 or financial support for employees to pay for their own child-care.<ref>Gottfried and Reese 2004, p. 184.</ref>\n\nIn 1978, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act was passed and amended [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. This act designated discrimination based on pregnancy, childbirth, or associated medical issues as illegal gender discrimination. The Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993, required employers to give up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and providing care for immediate family members who are ill. These two acts helped publicize the important role women play in caring for family members and gave women more opportunities to retain jobs that they would have previously lost.<ref name=\"Gottfried and Reese 2004, p. 134\"/> However, the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]] is limited in that only 60% of all employees in the U.S. are eligible for this leave since many small business are exempt from such coverage.<ref>Gottfried and Reese 2004, p. 205.</ref>\n\nThe fact that parental leave measures continue to enforce traditional division of labor between the genders indicates a need to reduce the stigma of male parenting as well as the stigma of parenthood on female employment opportunities. Some possible developments to improve parental leave include: offering job protection, full benefits, and substantial pay as a part of parental leave to heighten the social value of both parents caring for children, making parental leave more flexible so that both parents can take time off, reducing the negative impact of parental leave on job standing, and encouraging fathers to care for children by providing educational programs regarding pre-natal and post-natal care.<ref>Gottfried and Reese 2004, p. 209.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Sociological terminology]]\n[[Category:Social inequality]]\n", "text_old": "{{Globalize|date=November 2017}}\n\n'''Structural inequality''' is defined as a condition where one category of people are attributed an unequal status in relation to other categories of people. This relationship is perpetuated and reinforced by a confluence of unequal relations in roles, functions, decisions, rights, and opportunities.<ref>Dani, Anis A., and Arjan De. Haan, eds.

Poverty and Power: the Problem of Structural Inequality. Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield, 2009. 217.</ref>\n\n[[Globalization]] has a complex association with development and inequality, and mandates a new framework to help describe its effects. On one level, global competition in production can lead to productivity improvements that lead to a situation where industrial employment falls behind industrial output in a local market.<ref name=\"Inequality 2010\">Combating Poverty and Inequality: Structural Change, Social Policy.

Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nCombating structural inequality therefore often requires the broad, policy based [[structural change]] on behalf of government organizations, and is often a critical component of [[poverty reduction]].<ref name=\"Inequality 2010\"/> In many ways, a well-organized democratic government that can effectively combine moderate growth with redistributive policies stands the best chance of combating structural inequality.<ref name=\"Inequality 2010\"/>\n\n==Education==\nSee: [[Structural inequality in education]]<br />\nOne particularly influential form of structural inequality can be found in education, since education affects many other opportunities. Examples of institutionalized education-related racism include student tracking, access to college, access to technology, and school finance.\n\n==Spatial/regional==\nGlobally, the problem of spatial and regional segregation is largely a question between urban and rural disparities. A study commissioned by the United Nations University WIDER project has shown that for the twenty-six countries included in the study, spatial inequalities have been high and on the increase, especially for developing nations. Many of these inequalities were traced back to \u201csecond nature\u201d geographic forces that describe the infrastructure a society has in place for facilitating the trade of goods and employment between economic agents.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kanbur | first1 = Ravi | last2 = Venables | first2 = Tony | author-link1 = Ravi Kanbur | author-link2 = Anthony Venables | title = Spatial inequality and development | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | series = UNU-WIDER Studies in Development Economics | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780199278633 }}</ref> Another dominant and related factor is the ease of access to bodies of water and forms of long distance trade like ports. The discrepancies between the growth of communities close to these bodies of water  and those further away have been noted in cases between and within countries.<ref name=\"Collier, Paul 2007\"/> In the United States and many other developed countries, spatial inequality has developed into more specific forms described by residential segregation and housing discrimination. This has especially come into focus as education and employment are often tied into where a household is located relative to urban centers, and a variety of metrics, from education levels to welfare benefits have been correlated to spatial data.<ref>Adelman, Robert M., and Charles Jaret. \"Poverty, Race, and US Metropolitan Social and Economic Structure.\" Journal of Urban Affairs 21.1 (1999): Print.</ref>\n\n===Consequences===\nSpecifically, studies have identified a number of economic consequences of housing segregation. Perhaps the most obvious is the isolation of minorities, which creates a deficit in the potential for developing human capital. Second, many of the public schools that areas of low socioeconomic status have access to are underperforming, in part due to the limited budgeting the district receives from the limited tax base in the same area. Finally, another large factor is simply the wealth and security homeownership represents. Property values rarely increase in areas where poverty is high in the first place.<ref name=\"Massey\">Massey, Douglas S. 2004. \u201cThe New Geography of Inequality in Urban America,\u201c in C. Michael Henry, ed. Race, Poverty, and Domestic Policy. New Haven: Yale University Press.</ref>\n\n===Causes===\nThe causes of spatial inequality, however, are more complex. The mid-20th century phenomenon of the large-scale migration of white middle-class families from urban centers has coined the term [[white flight]]. While the current state of housing discrimination can be partly attributed to this phenomenon, a larger set of [[institutionalized discrimination]], like bias in loan and real estate industries and government policies, have helped to perpetuate the division created since then. These include bias found in the banking and real estate industries as well as discriminatory public policies that promote racial segregation.<ref>Massey 2004, p. 177.</ref> In addition, rising income inequality between blacks and whites since the 1970s have created affluent neighborhoods that tend to be composed of a homogeneous racial background of families within the same income bracket.<ref name=\"Massey 2004, p. 184\">Massey 2004, p. 184.</ref> A similar situation within the racial lines have helped to explain how more than 32% of blacks now live in suburbs. However, these new suburbs are often divided along racial lines, and a 1992 survey showed that 82% of blacks preferred to live a suburb where their race is in the majority.<ref>Cashin, Sheryll. \"Middle-Class Black Suburbs and the State of Integration: A Post-Integrationist Vision for Metropolitan America.\" (2001): 737.</ref> This is further aggravated by practices like [[racial steering]], in which realtors guide home buyers towards neighborhood based on race.\n\n===Transportation===\n{{see also|Transport divide}}\nGovernment policies that have tended to promote spatial inequalities include actions by the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA) in the United Sates in promoting [[redlining]], a practice where mortgages could be selectively administered while excluding certain urban neighborhood deemed risky, oftentimes because of race. Practices like this continued to prevent home buyers from getting mortgages in redlined areas until the 1960s, when the FHA discontinued the determination of restrictions based on racial composition.<ref>Wilson, William J. More than Just Race: Being Black and Poor in the Inner City. New York: Norton &, 2009. 28.</ref>\n\nThe advent of freeways also added a complex layer of incentives and barriers which helped to increase spatial inequalities. First, these new networks allowed for middle-class families to move out to the suburbs while retaining connections like employment to the urban center. Second, and perhaps more importantly, freeways were routed through minority neighborhoods, oftentimes creating barriers between these neighborhoods and central business districts and middle class areas. Highway plans often avoided a more direct route through upper or middle class neighbors because minorities did not have sufficient power to prevent such actions from happening.<ref>Wilson 2009, p. 29.</ref>\n\n===Solutions===\nMassey identifies three goals specifically for the United States to end residential segregation: reorganize the structure of metropolitan government, make greater investment in education, and finally open housing market so full participation<ref name=\"Massey 2004, p. 184\"/> More specifically, he advocates broader, metropolitan-wide units of taxation and governance where the tax base and decisions are made equally by both the urban and suburban population. Education is the key to closing employment inequalities in a post-manufacturing era. And finally, the federal government must take large strides towards enforcing the anti-segregation measures related to housing it has already put into place, like the [[Fair housing|Fair Housing Act]], the [[Home Mortgage Disclosure Act]], and the [[Community Reinvestment Act]].\nAnother set of divisions that may be useful in framing policy solutions include three categories: place-based policies, people-based policies, and indirect approaches.  Place-based policies include improving community facilities and services like schools and public safety in inner-city areas in an effort to appeal to middle-class families. These programs must be balanced with concerns of [[gentrification]]. People-based policies help increase access to credit for low-income families looking to move, and this sort of policy has been typified by the Community Reinvestment Act and its many revisions throughout its legislative history. Finally, indirect approaches often involve providing better transportation options to low-income areas, like public transit routes or subsidized car ownership. These approaches target the consequences rather than the causes of segregation, and rely on the assumption that one of the most harmful effects of spatial inequality is the lack of access to employment opportunities. In conclusion, a common feature in all of these is the investment in the capital and infrastructure of inner-city or neighborhood.<ref>\u201cRacial Residential Segregation in American Cities,\u201d in Oxford Handbook of Urban Economics and Planning, ed.

The healthcare system in the United States perpetuates inequality by \u201crationing health care according to a person\u2019s ability to pay, by providing inadequate and inferior health care to poor people and persons of color, and by failing to establish structures that can meet the health needs of Americans\u201d.<ref>Aguirre Jr., Adalberto, and David V. Baker. Structured Inequality in the United States: Critical Discussions on the Continuing Significance of Race, Ethnicity, and Gender. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2008. Print.</ref>\n\n===Racial===\n[[Race and health|Racial disparity in access and quality of healthcare]] is a serious problem in the United States and is reflected by evidence such as the fact that African American life expectancies lag behind that of whites by over 5 years, and African Americans tend to experience more chronic conditions.  African Americans have a 30% higher death rate from cardiovascular disease and experience 50% more diabetic complications than their white counterparts.<ref name=\"Kronenfeld, Jennie J. 2010\"/> The [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] (AHRQ), directed by Congress, led an effort for the development of two annual reports by the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] (DHHS), the National Healthcare Quality Report and the National Healthcare Disparities Report, which tracked disparities in healthcare in relation to racial and socioeconomic factors. These reports developed about 140 measures of quality of care and about 100 measures of access to care, which were used to measure the healthcare disparities. The first reports, released in December 2003, found that blacks and Hispanics experienced poorer healthcare quality for about half of the quality measures reported in the NHQR and NDHR. Also, Hispanics and Asians experienced poorer access to care for about two thirds of the healthcare access measures.<ref name=\"Kelley 2005\"/> Recent studies on Medicare patients show that black patients receive poorer medical care than their white counterparts. Compared with white patients, blacks receive far fewer operations, tests, medications and other treatments, suffering greater illnesses and more deaths as a result.<ref>Aguirre and Baker</ref> Measures done by the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] (AHRQ) show that \u201cfewer than 20% of disparities faced by Blacks, AI/ANs and Hispanics showed evidence of narrowing.\u201d <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.ahrq.gov/research/findings/nhqrdr/nhqrdr10/minority.html|title=Disparities in Healthcare Quality Among Racial and Ethnic Minority Groups {{!}} AHRQ Archive|website=archive.ahrq.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-01-23}}</ref>\n\nOne specific study showed that African Americans are less likely than whites to be referred for cardiac catheterization and bypass grafting, prescription of analgesia for pain control, and surgical treatment of lung cancer. Both African Americans and Latinos also receive less pain medication than whites for long bone fractures and cancer. Other studies showed that African Americans are reported to receive fewer pediatric prescriptions, poorer quality of hospital care, fewer hospital admissions for chest pain, lower quality of prenatal care, and less appropriate management of congestive heart failure and pneumonia.<ref name=\"Wiliams, Richard A. 2007\">Wiliams, Richard A., ed. Eliminating Healthcare Disparities in America. Totowa, NJ: Humana, 2007. Print.</ref>\n\nLanguage-barriers became a large factor in the process of seeking healthcare due to the rise in minorities across the United States. In 2007, an estimate done by the Census Bureau stated that 33.6% of the United States belonged to racial ethnicities that were non-Hispanic whites. Of people within the United States during this time, 20% spoke a language different from English at home. Having a language-barrier can cause many hurdles when pertaining to healthcare: difficulty communicating with health professionals, sourcing/the funding of language assistance, having little to no access to translators, etc.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.ahrq.gov/research/findings/nhqrdr/nhqrdr10/minority.html|title=Disparities in Healthcare Quality Among Racial and Ethnic Minority Groups {{!}} AHRQ Archive|website=archive.ahrq.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-01-24}}</ref> A 2050 projection showed that over 50% of the United States would belong to a racial category other than non-Hispanic white. Thus, demonstrating the rapid increase of minorities over time within the United States and the importance of it.\n\n===Gender===\nIn addition to race, [[Gender disparities in health|healthcare inequality also manifests across gender lines]]. Though women tend to live longer than men, they tend to report poorer health status, more disabilities as they age, and tend to be higher utilizers of the healthcare system.<ref name=\"Bayne-Smith, Marcia 1996\">Bayne-Smith, Marcia, ed. Race, Gender, and Health. London: Sage Publications, 1996. Print.</ref> Healthcare disparities often put women at a disadvantage. Such time must be scheduled around work (whether formal or informal), child care needs, and the geography\u2014which increases the travel time necessary for those who do not live near healthcare facilities.<ref name=\"Bayne-Smith, Marcia 1996\"/> Furthermore, \u201cpoor women and their children tend to have inadequate housing, poor nutrition, poor sanitation, and high rates of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse.\u201d Since women and children constitute 80% of [[Poverty in the United States|the poor in the United States]], they are particularly susceptible to experiencing the negative impact of healthcare inequality.<ref name=\"Bayne-Smith, Marcia 1996\"/>\n\n===Spatial===\nSpatial distribution and geographic location also affect access and quality of healthcare. A study done by Rowland, Lyons, and Edwards (1988) found that rural patients were more likely to be poor and uninsured.<ref>Davis, Karen. \"Inequality and Access to Health Care.\" The Milbank Quarterly 69.2 (1991): 253-73. JSTOR. Web. 2 Nov. 2011.</ref> Because of the fewer healthcare resources available in rural areas, these patients received fewer medical services than urban patients.<ref name=\"Davis 1991\">Davis 1991</ref> Other studies showed that African Americans and Hispanics are more likely than whites to live in areas that are underserved by healthcare providers, forcing them to wait longer for care in crowded and/or understaffed facilities or traveling longer distances to receive care in other areas. This travel time often poses an obstacle to receiving medical care and often leads patients to delay care until later.<ref name=\"Kronenfeld, Jennie J. 2010\"/> In fact, African Americans and Hispanics are more likely than whites to delay seeking medical care until their condition becomes serious, rather than seeking regular medical care, because travel and wait times are both costly and an interference in other daily activities.<ref name=\"Kronenfeld, Jennie J. 2010\"/>\n\nAn individual's environment greatly impacts his or her health status. For example, three of the five largest landfills in the United States are situated in communities which are predominantly African American and Latino, contributing to some of the highest pediatric asthma rates in those groups.<ref name=\"Wiliams, Richard A. 2007\"/> Impoverished individuals who find themselves unable to leave their neighborhoods consequently are continuously exposed to the same harmful environment, which negatively impacts health.\n\n===Economic===\nSocioeconomic background is another source of inequality in healthcare. [[Diseases of poverty|Poverty significantly influences the production of disease]] since poverty increases the likelihood of having poor health in addition to decreasing the ability to afford preventative and routine healthcare.<ref name=\"Bayne-Smith, Marcia 1996\"/> Lack of access to healthcare has a significant negative impact on patients, especially those who are uninsured, since they are less likely to have a regular source of care, such as a [[primary care physician]], and are more likely to delay seeking care until their condition becomes life-threatening.<ref name=\"Wiliams, Richard A. 2007\"/>  Studies show that people with health insurance receive significantly more care than those who are uninsured, the most vulnerable groups being minorities, young adults, and low-income individuals. The same trend for uninsured versus insured patients holds true for children as well.<ref name=\"Davis 1991\"/>\n\nHadley, Steinberg, and Feder (1991) found that hospitalized patients who are not covered under health insurance are less likely to receive high-cost, specialized procedures and as a result, are more likely to die while hospitalized.<ref name=\"Davis 1991\"/> Feder, Hadley, and Mullner (1984) noticed that hospitals often ration free care by denying care to those who are unable to pay and cutting services commonly used by the uninsured poor.<ref name=\"Davis 1991\"/> Minorities are less likely to have health insurance because are less likely to occupy middle to upper income brackets, and therefore are incapable of purchasing health insurance, and also because they tend to hold low-paying jobs that do not provide health insurance as part of their job-related benefits. Census data show that 78.7% of whites are covered by private insurance compared with 54% of blacks and 51% of Hispanics. About 29% of Hispanics in the United States have neither private nor government health insurance of any kind.<ref name=\"Bayne-Smith, Marcia 1996\"/>\n\nA study done on Medicare recipients also showed that despite the uniform benefits offered, high-income elderly patients received 60% more physician services and 45% more days of hospital care than lower-income elderly patients not covered by Medicaid.<ref name=\"Davis 1991\"/> After adjustment for health status, people with higher incomes are shown to have higher expenditures, indicating that the wealthy are strongly favored in income-related inequality in medical care. However, this inequality differs across age groups. Inequality was shown to be greatest for senior citizens, then adults, and least for children. This pattern showed that financial resources and other associated attributes, such as educational attainment, were very influential in access and utilization of medical care.<ref>Chen and Escarce, 2004.</ref>\n\n===Solutions===\nThe acknowledgement that access to health services differed depending on race, geographic location, and socioeconomic background was an impetus in establishing health policies to benefit these vulnerable groups.<ref name=\"Davis 1991\"/> In 1965, specific programs, such as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]], were implemented in the United States in an attempt to extend health insurance to a greater portion of the population. Medicare is a federally funded program that provides health insurance for people aged 65 or older, people younger than 65 with certain disabilities, and people of any age who have End-Stage Renal Disease (ERSD). Medicaid, on the other hand, provides health coverage to certain low income people and families and is largely state-governed.<ref>\"Frequently Asked Questions About Medicare\" Medicare.gov. 26 Aug. 2008. Web. 2 Nov. 2011.</ref> However, studies have shown that for-profit hospitals tend to make healthcare less accessible to uninsured patients in addition to those under Medicaid in an effort to contain costs.<ref name=\"Davis 1991\"/> Another program, the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program|State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP) provides low cost health insurance to children in families who do not qualify for Medicaid but cannot afford private health insurance on their own.<ref>medicare.org</ref>\nThe necessity of achieving equity in quality of and access to healthcare is glaring and urgent. According to Fein (1972), this goal could include equal health outcomes for all by income group, equal expenditures per capita across income groups, or eliminating income as a healthcare rationing device. Some have proposed that a national health insurance plan with comprehensive benefits and no deductibles or other costs from the patients would provide the most equity.<ref name=\"Davis 1991\"/> Fein also stressed that healthcare reform was needed, specifically in eliminating financial assistance to treat patients that depended on patient income or the quantity of services given. He proposed instead paying physicians on a salaried basis.<ref name=\"Davis 1991\"/> \nAnother study, by Reynolds (1976), found that community health centers improved access to health care for many vulnerable groups, including youth, blacks, and people with serious diseases. The study indicated that community health centers provided more preventive care and greater continuity of care, though there were problems in obtaining adequate funding as well as adequate staffing.<ref name=\"Davis 1991\"/> Engaging the community to understand the link between social issues such as employment, education, and poverty can help motivate community members to advocate for policies that improve health status.<ref name=\"Wiliams, Richard A. 2007\"/>\n\nIncreasing the racial and ethnic diversity of healthcare providers can also serve as a potential solution. Racial and ethnic minority healthcare providers are much more likely than their white counterparts to serve minority communities, which can have many positive effects. Advocating for an increase in minority healthcare providers can help improve the quality of patient-physician communication as well as reduce the crowding in understaffed facilities in areas in which minorities reside. This can help decrease wait times as well as increase the likelihood that such patients will seek out nearby healthcare facilities rather than traveling farther distances as a last resort.<ref name=\"Wiliams, Richard A. 2007\"/>\n\nImplementing efforts to increase translation services can also improve quality of healthcare.<ref name=\"Bayne-Smith, Marcia 1996\"/> This means increased availability of bilingual and bicultural healthcare providers for non-English speakers. Studies show that non-English speaking patients self-reported better physical functioning, psychological well-being, health perceptions, and lower pain when receiving treatment from a physician who spoke their language. Hispanic patients specifically reported increased compliance to treatment plans when their physician spoke Spanish and also shared a similar background. Training programs to improve and broaden physicians\u2019 communication skills can increase patient satisfaction, patient compliance, patient participation in treatment decisions, and utilization of preventative care services <ref name=\"Wiliams, Richard A. 2007\"/>\n\nThe idea of [[universal health care]], which is implemented in many other countries, has been a subject of heated debate in the United States.\n\n==Employment==\nEmployment is a key source of income for a majority of the world's population, and therefore is the most direct method through which people can escape poverty. However, unequal access to decent work and persistent labor market inequalities frustrate efforts to reduce poverty.<ref>UNRISD 2004, p. 31.</ref> Studies have further divided employment segregation into two categories: first generation and second generation discrimination. First generation discrimination occurs as an overt bias displayed by employers, and since the end of the civil rights era has been on the decline. Second generation discrimination; on the other hand, is less direct and therefore much harder to legislate against. This helps explain the disparity between female hiring rates and male/female ratios, which have gone up recently, and the relative scarcity of women in upper-level management positions.<ref>Sturm, Susan. \"Second Generation Employment Discrimination: A Structural Approach.\" Columbia Law Review 101.3 (2001): 497.</ref> Therefore, while there is extensive legislation passed regarding employment discrimination, informal barriers still exist in the workplace. For instance, gender discrimination often takes the form of working hours and childcare-related benefits.<ref>Aguirre and Baker 2008, p. 200.</ref> In many cases, female professionals who must take maternity leave or single mothers who must care for their children often are at a disadvantage when it comes to promotions and advancement.\n\n===Education level===\n[[Employment discrimination]] is also closely linked to education and skills. One of the most important factors that can help describe employment disparities was that for much of the post-WWII-era, many Western countries began shedding the manufacturing jobs that provided relatively high-wage jobs to people with moderate to low job skills.<ref>Adelman p. 38.</ref> Starting from the 1960s, the United States began a shift away from low-wage jobs, especially in the manufacturing sector, towards technology-based or service-based employment.<ref>Wilson 2009, p. 70.</ref> This had an unbalanced effect of decreasing employment opportunities for the least educated in the labor force while at the same time increasing the productivity and therefore wages of the skilled labor force, increasing the level of inequality.<ref>Marshall, F. Ray. Back to Shared Prosperity: the Growing Inequality of Wealth and Income in America. Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, 2000. Print. 6.</ref> In addition, globalization has tended to compound this decrease in demand of domestic unskilled labor.\n\nFinally, weak labor market policies since the 70's and 80's have failed to address the income inequalities that those who are employed at lower income levels have to face. Namely, the union movement began to shrink, decreasing the power for employees to negotiate employment terms, and the minimum wage was prevented from increasing alongside inflation.<ref>Wilson 2009, p. 15</ref>\n\n===Racial===\nOther barriers include [[human capital]] occupations that require an extensive network for developing clientele, like lawyers, physicians, and salesmen. Studies have shown that for blacks and whites in the same occupation, whites can often benefit for a wealthier pool of clients and connections.<ref>Grodsky, Eric and Devah Pager. 2001. \u201cThe Structure of Disadvantage: Individual and Occupational Determinants of the Black-White Wage Gap.\u201d American Sociological Review:66(4):542-567.</ref> In addition, studies show that only a small percentage of low-skilled employees are hired through advertisements or cold calls, highlighting the importance of social connections with middle- and upper- class employers.<ref>Wilson 2009, p. 75.</ref>\n\n===Gender===\nThough women have become an increasing presence in the workforce, there currently exists a gender gap in earnings. Statistics show that women who work full-time year-round earn 75% of the income as their male counterparts.<ref>Jacobs, Jerry A. Gender Inequality at Work. London: Sage Publications, 1995. Print. 9.</ref> Part of the gender gap in employment earnings is due to women concentrating in different occupational fields than men, which is known as [[occupational segregation]].<ref>Reese, Laura. Equity in the Workplace: Gendering Workplace Policy Analysis. Ed. Heidi Gottfried. New York: Lexington, 2004. Print. 152.</ref> The 1990 Census data show that more than 50% of women would have to change jobs before women would be distributed in the same way as men within the job market, achieving complete gender integration.<ref>Jacobs 1995, p. 9.</ref> This can be attributed to the tendency of women to choose degrees that funnel into jobs that are less lucrative than those chosen by men.<ref>Jacobs 1995, p. 5.</ref>\n\nOther studies have shown that the Hay system, which evaluates jobs, undervalues the occupations that tend to be filled by women, which continues to bias wages against women's work.<ref>Jacobs 1995, p. 10.</ref> Once a certain job becomes associated with women, its social value decreases.  Almost all studies show that the percentage of women is correlated with lower earnings for both males and females even in fields that required significant job skills, which suggests a strong effect of gender composition on earnings.<ref>Jacobs 1995, p. 26.</ref>\nAdditionally, women tend to be hired into less desirable jobs than men and are denied access to more skilled jobs or jobs that place them in an authoritative role. In general, women tend to hold fewer positions of power when compared to men. A study done by Reskin and Ross (1982) showed that when tenure and productivity-related measurements were controlled, women had less authority and earned less than men of equal standing in their occupation.<ref>Jacobs 1995, p. 11.</ref> Exclusionary practices provide the most valuable job openings and career opportunities for members of groups of higher status which, in the United States, mostly means Caucasian males. Therefore, males are afforded more advantages than females and perpetuate this cycle while they still hold more social power, allocating lower-skilled and lower-paying jobs to females and minorities.<ref>Jacobs 1995, p. 29.</ref>\n\n===Inequality in investment of skills===\nAnother factor of the [[gender pay gap|gender earnings gap]] is reflected in the difference in job skills between women and men. Studies suggest that women invest less in their own occupational training because they stay in the workforce for a shorter period of time than men (because of marriage or rearing children) and therefore have a shorter time span to benefit from their extra efforts.<ref>Jacobs 1995, p. 6.</ref> However, there is also discrimination by the employer. Studies have shown that the earnings gap is also due to employers investing less money in training female employees, which leads to a gender disparity in accessing career development opportunities.<ref>Jacobs 1995, p. 7.</ref>\n\n===Prescribed gender roles===\nWomen tend to stay in the workforce for less time than men due to marriage or the time devoted to raising children. Consequently, men are typically viewed as the \u201cbreadwinners\u201d of the family, which is reflected in the employee benefits provided in careers that are traditionally occupied by males. A study done by Heidi M. Berggren, assessing the employee benefits provided to nurses (a traditional female career) and automobile mechanics and repairmen (a traditional male career), found that the latter provided more significant benefits such as health insurance and other medical emergency benefits whereas the former provided more access to sick leave with full pay.<ref>Gottfried and Reese 2004, p. 164.</ref> This outlines the roles allotted to women as the caregivers and the men as the providers of the family which subsequently encourages men to seek gainful employment while encouraging women to have a larger role at home than in the workplace. Many parental leave policies in the US are poorly developed and reinforce the roles of men as the breadwinner and women as the caregiver.<ref>Gottfried and Reese 2004, p. 207.</ref>\n\n===Glass ceiling===\nWomen have often described subtle gender barriers in career advancement, known as the [[glass ceiling]]. This refers to the limited mobility of women in the workforce due to social restrictions that limit their opportunities and affect their career decisions.<ref name=\"Gottfried and Reese 2004, p. 134\">Gottfried and Reese 2004, p. 134.</ref>\n\n===Solutions===\nA study done by Doorne-Huiskes, den Dulk, and Schippers (1999) showed that in countries with government policy addressing the balance between work and family life, women have high participation in the work force and there is a smaller gender wage gap, indicating that such policy could encourage mothers to stay in their occupations while also encouraging men to take on a greater child-rearing role. Such measure include mandating employers to provide paid parental leave for employees so that both parents can care for children without risk to their careers. Another suggested measure is government-provided day care for children aged 0\u20136 or financial support for employees to pay for their own child-care.<ref>Gottfried and Reese 2004, p. 184.</ref>\n\nIn 1978, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act was passed and amended [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. This act designated discrimination based on pregnancy, childbirth, or associated medical issues as illegal gender discrimination. The Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993, required employers to give up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave for the birth or adoption of a child and providing care for immediate family members who are ill. These two acts helped publicize the important role women play in caring for family members and gave women more opportunities to retain jobs that they would have previously lost.<ref name=\"Gottfried and Reese 2004, p. 134\"/> However, the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]] is limited in that only 60% of all employees in the U.S. are eligible for this leave since many small business are exempt from such coverage.<ref>Gottfried and Reese 2004, p. 205.</ref>\n\nThe fact that parental leave measures continue to enforce traditional division of labor between the genders indicates a need to reduce the stigma of male parenting as well as the stigma of parenthood on female employment opportunities. Some possible developments to improve parental leave include: offering job protection, full benefits, and substantial pay as a part of parental leave to heighten the social value of both parents caring for children, making parental leave more flexible so that both parents can take time off, reducing the negative impact of parental leave on job standing, and encouraging fathers to care for children by providing educational programs regarding pre-natal and post-natal care.<ref>Gottfried and Reese 2004, p. 209.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Sociological terminology]]\n[[Category:Social inequality]]\n", "name_user": "WereSpielChequers", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTransportation:Typo fixing, replaced: United Sates \u2192 United States", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_inequality"}

Currently the institute is led by [[Muhammad Iqbal Choudhary]] as the director of the ICCBS. The HEJ Research Institute of Chemistry (HEJRIC) oversees Pakistan\u2019s largest doctoral program in a single field of interest. The main areas of student training and research include natural product, protein and synthetic organic chemistry, computational medicinal chemistry, pharmacology and plant biotechnology. Specific areas of research relate largely to pharmacological studies of novel natural products and protein chemistry.\n\n==Overview==\nOn the retirement of Professor [[Salimuzzaman Siddiqui]] (FRS) as Chairman PCSIR, his services were taken up by the University of Karachi and a \"Postgraduate Institute of Chemistry\" was established under his Directorship in 1967 in a wing of the Department of Chemistry. PCSIR provided the services of some of its staff (including Viqar Uddin Ahmad and Zafar H. Zaidi) and furniture during the initial phase of the establishment of this institute. [[Atta ur Rahman]] joined the Institute in March 1969 after obtaining Ph.D. from [[King's College, Cambridge|Kings College]], later he accepted a 4-year assignment as a Fellow of Kings College, Cambridge University. He was then sent by Cambridge University to the University of Karachi during 1971-74 to assist in the setting up of a modern postgraduate institute of chemistry, and he brought with donated equipment including a gas chromatograph, balances and a combustion microanalyser from Cambridge University.\n\nAtta-ur-Rahman succeeded in obtaining grants to acquire a new mass spectrometers and NMR spectrometers, both of which were installed in 1973, within a year of his return to Pakistan. He was appointed as the Co-Director in 1977. He succeeded in winning several major projects for the institute which established the institute in the field of Natural Product Chemistry. A generous donation was offered to the University for the Institute by [[Latif Ebrahim Jamal]] on behalf of the Husein Ebrahim Jamal Foundation in 1976, the largest donation at that time in the history of the country. The Institute was accordingly named as \"Husein Ebrahim Jamal Research Institute of Chemistry\", in the memory of late Husein Ebrahim Jamal.\n\nAtta-ur-Rahman was appointed as the Director in January 1990, while Viqar Uddin Ahmad took over as Co-Director in 1990. In 2000, Professor Bina S. Siddiqui was appointed as the Co-Director on the retirement of Professor Ahmad, while in 2002  M. Iqbal Choudhary was given the responsibilities of the Director (Acting) of ICCBS and Co-Director of Panjwani Center for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research. In September 2008, he was appointed as the Director of the ICCBS institutions. \n\nThe institute has organized a number of major international conferences and symposia on various aspects of Natural Product Chemistry, Spectroscopy and Protein Chemistry. The institute hosted the 19th IUPAC Symposium on Natural Product Chemistry in January 1994 in which over 500 scientists from 52 countries, including 4 Nobel Laureates participated.\n\nAdditionally the Institute has also been selected as one of the three library centers of the Third World Academy of Sciences (TWAS). The H.E.J. Institute has been designated as the W.H.O. Center for Pesticide Analysis for the Eastern Mediterranean Region. The institute is also a member of the IUCN-International, WAITRO, and COMSATS. More recently the institute is designated as the OIC Center of Excellence in Chemical Sciences. In 2001, the H.E.J. Research Institute became a constituent institution of the International Center for Chemical Sciences (later named as International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences).\n\nIn 2004, the H.E.J. Research Institute received the prestigious IDB (Islamic Development Bank) prize for the best science institution in the entire Islamic world. Recently, the IDB awarded the best science institution again to the H.E.J. Research Institute (second time), an unprecedented honor to any science institution in OIC region. {{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn August 2003, an Industrial Analytical Center was established as the service wing of H. E. J. Institute. Third World Center (TWC) Laboratory complex was formally inaugurated by the Prime Minister of Pakistan in 2005 as an extension of the H.E.J. Research Institute of Chemistry. The building of TWC was renamed to \"Atta-ur-Rahman Laboratories\" by the Executive Board in 2011, in recognition of the outstanding services of Atta-ur-Rahman (FRS) who is now serving the ICCBS institution as the Patron-in-chief.\n\nIn the year 2004, the Panjwani Center for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research (PCMD) was established through a generous donation and patronage of Nadira Panjwani (Chairperson, Panjwani Memorial Trust) in the memory of her father, Mohammad Hussain Panjwani, a leading scholar and philanthropist. The main objective of the center is to train highly qualified manpower in the emerging new fields of molecular medicine and drug development. The academicians, clinicians and pharmaceutical researchers are brought together to translate basic scientific discoveries into new therapies, vaccines and diagnostic tests. \n\nLate Mr. Latif Ebrahim Jamal, Chairman Ebrahim Jamal Foundation, continuing his patronage to the Institute, established the Latif Ebrahim Jamal National Science Information Center in 2005. The beautiful building of this one of the largest paperless libraries of the region was constructed under the direct supervision of Mr. Aziz Latif Jamal S.I. (Current Chairman Husein Ebrahim Jamal Foundation), able and committed son of (Late) Mr. Latif Ebrahim Jamal.\n\n==See also==\n* [[University of Karachi]]\n* [[Pakistan Academy of Sciences]]\n* [[Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]]\n* [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan]]\n* [[Pakistan Educational Research Network]]\n* [[Academy of Young Researchers and Scholars]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130328133800/http://www.iccs.edu/hej/index.php Profile at ICCS website]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/pages/HEJ-Research-Institute-of-Chemistry/355744354446164]\n\n{{University of Karachi}}\n{{Colleges and universities in Karachi}}\n\n{{coord missing|Karachi}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hussain Ebrahim Jamal Research Institute Of Chemistry}}\n[[Category:Research institutes in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Chemical research institutes]]\n[[Category:University of Karachi]]\n[[Category:Constituent institutions of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]]\n[[Category:Laboratories in Pakistan]]\n\n[[de:University of Karachi]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=September 2010}}\n{{ infobox| above       = International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences (ICCBS)\n| abovestyle  = background-color: green; color: white\n| headerstyle = background-color: green; color: white\n| header1     = Information:\n| image1      =\n| caption1    =\n| label2      = Established:\n| data2       = {{Start date and years ago|mf=no|1967|01|31}}\n| label3      = [[Director (education)|Director]]:\n| data3       = [[Muhammad Iqbal Choudhary]]\n| label4      = [[Emeritus Professor|Emeritus scientist]]:\n| data4       = [[Atta ur Rahman (scientist)|Atta ur Rahman]]\n| label5      = City/Location:\n| data5       =\tKarachi, Sindh, Pakistan\n| label6     = Budget:\n| data6       = Funding is done by [[Government of Pakistan]]\n| label7      = Type:\n| data7       = [[Science]] and [[Technology]] and [[fundamental science]]\n| label9      = Campus: \n| data9       =[[Karachi University]]\n| label21     = Website:\n| data21      = [http://www.iccs.edu/index.php HEJ Homepage]\n| label22     = Nicknames:\n| data22      =HEJ\n| label23     = Social Network:\n| data23      =H.E.J.

The beautiful building of this one of the largest paperless libraries of the region was constructed under the direct supervision of Mr. Aziz Latif Jamal S.I. (Current Chairman Husein Ebrahim Jamal Foundation), able and committed son of (Late) Mr. Latif Ebrahim Jamal.\n\n==See also==\n* [[University of Karachi]]\n* [[Pakistan Academy of Sciences]]\n* [[Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]]\n* [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan]]\n* [[Pakistan Educational Research Network]]\n* [[Academy of Young Researchers and Scholars]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130328133800/http://www.iccs.edu/hej/index.php Profile at ICCS website]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/pages/HEJ-Research-Institute-of-Chemistry/355744354446164]\n\n{{University of Karachi}}\n{{Colleges and universities in Karachi}}\n\n{{coord missing|Karachi}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hussain Ebrahim Jamal Research Institute Of Chemistry}}\n[[Category:Research institutes in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Chemical research institutes]]\n[[Category:University of Karachi]]\n[[Category:Constituent institutions of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]]\n[[Category:Laboratories in Pakistan]]\n\n[[de:University of Karachi]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toKing's College(link changed toKing's College, Cambridge) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussain_Ebrahim_Jamal_Research_Institute_of_Chemistry"}
