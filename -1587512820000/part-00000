He believes that the only thing keeping him safe is his house. When his parents decide to move, Willy isn't thrilled with the idea of going to a new school and living in a strange home. One day, Gooby, a teddy bear that Willy had as a little boy, arrives at the new home. This version of Gooby is nearly six feet tall, able to talk, and wants to help; Willy decides that the two will be friends, but he must hide Gooby from his parents.\n\nLeft alone for long hours while Willy goes to school, Gooby is frequently bored. He passes the time by causing trouble, convincing the nanny that there are critters inside the house, stealing cookies from the kitchen, ransacking the garage for parts to build Willy's fantasy racer and sneaking around Willy's school where anyone could see him. When Willy's teacher goes on maternity leave, she is replaced by Mr. Nerdlinger, a children's book writer who desperately wants to become famous. When he catches sight of Gooby, he becomes determined to photograph him. Willy has trouble making friends, and when Gooby's appearance outside Mr. Nerdlinger's class makes Willy freak out (earning him and three of his classmates two weeks of after school detention) his reputation at school is only worsened. On Halloween day, Willy and Gooby go out during daylight to have fun (Willy convinces Gooby to pretend to be Willy's father in a costume) and Willy makes friends with the most popular kids in school by having Gooby buy them all tickets to an R-rated action movie. Gooby becomes envious of Willy when he begins to spend more time with his newfound friends. The two get into an argument, resulting in Gooby running away.\n\nWilly's grades start to drop, and his parents begin to worry. When Gooby eventually returns one night, he convinces Willy to follow him to a surprise location. Willy's parents notice that their son is missing and call the police, but meanwhile Gooby shows Willy what he has discovered: his father's childhood home. While exploring it, Willy gets scared to the point of falling backwards, breaking through the floor and catching a metal pipe too far down for Gooby to help him up. Gooby uses Willy's cellphone to call his father, who comes to the rescue. After saving Willy, Gooby talks to Mr. Dandrige and reminds him of how when he was a child his father never spent enough time with him. Willy's mother and father decide to stop working so hard and focus more on their son. One day, while shopping for materials to build Willy a playhouse, the family foils Mr. Nerdlinger's attempt to get pictures of Gooby when Willy notices that Gooby has wandered off. Gooby explains to Willy that now that he is happy and no longer so alone (and afraid of imaginary creatures), it's time for Gooby to move on and help another child. Gooby transforms back into a teddy bear and Willy offers him to a little girl who is being ignored by her parents.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Robbie Coltrane]] as Gooby (voice)\n** Derek Scott as Gooby (performance)\n* [[David James Elliott]] as Jack Dandridge\n* [[Ingrid Kavelaars]] as Elize Dandridge\n* [[Matthew Knight]] as Willy Dandridge\n* [[Eugene Levy]] as Mr. Nerdlinger\n* Mary Haney as Mrs. Williams\n* Len Doncheff as Mr. Ogilvey\n* Paula Boudreau as Mrs. Deacon\n* Elle Downs as Mrs. Donnelly\n* Ricky Hegarty as Colin\n* [[Alexander Conti]] as Eric\n* [[Luke Bilyk]] as Cute Kid\n* [[Jack Duffy]] as Grocery Store Manager\n* [[Daniel DeSanto]] as Crane\n* Avery Bisbee as Little Girl\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|1132588|Gooby}}\n* {{Mojo title|gooby|Gooby}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gooby}}\n[[Category:2009 films]]\n[[Category:Canadian films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:2000s fantasy films]]\n[[Category:2000s children's fantasy films]]\n[[Category:Canadian children's films]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the children's film|the [[Disney]] character parodied in [[Internet meme]]s as \"Gooby\"|Goofy}}\n{{Italic title}}\n{{Refimprove|stub|date=September 2010}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Gooby\n| image          = Gooby.jpg\n| alt            = <!-- see WP:ALT -->\n| caption        = \n| director       = Wilson Coneybeare\n| producer       = Wilson Coneybeare\n| writer         = Wilson Coneybeare\n| starring       = {{Plainlist|<!--- Per billing block --->\n*[[Robbie Coltrane]]\n*[[David James Elliott]]\n*[[Matthew Knight]]\n*[[Ingrid Kavelaars]]\n*[[Eugene Levy]]}}\n| music          = {{Plainlist|\n*Kevin Lau\n*Ronald Royer}}\n| cinematography = Michael Storey\n| editing        = Ellen Fine\n| studio         = Coneybeare Stories Inc.\n| distributor    = [[E1 Entertainment]]\n| released       = {{Film date|2009|4|17|df=y}}\n| runtime        = 95 minutes\n| country        = Canada\n| language       = English\n| budget         = \n| gross          = $3,234\n}}\n'''''Gooby''''' (also known as '''''A Ted Named Gooby''''') is a 2009 Canadian [[Comedy film|comedy]] [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] [[drama film]] written and directed by Wilson Coneybeare featuring [[Robbie Coltrane]] as the voice of Gooby, a living [[teddy bear]], and [[Matthew Knight]] as Willy, an 11-year-old child who is scared of his new house.\n\nThe film was shot on a budget of $6.5 million.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] rates it 20% positive (\"rotten\") based on five reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gooby/ |title=Gooby Movie Reviews, Pictures |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=January 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nWilly is an 11-year-old boy who believes weird creatures are lurking, just waiting to attack him.

They represented a growing love for [[surf music]] and helped make the genre popular. Their debut album, ''[[Surfbeat]]'', was the biggest-selling surf album of all time and helped bring surf music from California to the rest of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-challengers-mn0000068584 |title=The Challengers |publisher=allmusic.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref>\n\n\n==Overview==\n\nThe band was formed out of the pioneer surf band called [[The Bel-Airs]]. The Bel-Airs were still in high school at the time, but scored a hit with an instrumental song titled \"Mr. Moto\". Their potential was cited by many, but it was an argument about use of the then new Fender reverb unit that led to their breakup. The Bel-Airs were originally formed by two guitarists, Eddie Bertrand and Paul Johnson, both 16 years old at the time they recorded \"Mr. Moto\". In early 1963, Eddie Bertrand heard [[Dick Dale]] using the [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] reverb unit and wanted to start incorporating heavy reverb into The Bel-Airs songs. He felt reverb was the sound that would come to define surf music. Even at 17, Johnson was something of an independent thinker and told Bertrand that The Bel-Airs had done quite well without [[Reverberation|reverb]] and he didn't see any reason at all to begin using it. The argument escalated until Bertrand finally left the band which then broke up for good shortly after. Johnson confirmed this story in the liner notes he contributed to The Bel-Airs reunion album released in 1986.\n\n==Early years==\n\nDuring their peak years, from late 1960 to Summer 1963, The Bel-Airs had two drummers who played gigs with the band alternately, original [[Mouseketeer]], Dick Dodd ([[Eddie & the Showmen]] and [[The Standells]]) and a local school friend named [[Richard Delvy]]. Delvy saw value in publishing, promoting and recording and began a career of managing and producing surf music. He then ultimately recorded numerous Southern California bands in the latter part of the 1960s. Since the 60's Delvy has produced many different musical artists and has made music management his lifelong passion.\n\nThe year before The Bel-Airs breakup, Richard Delvy left The Bel-Airs to form a new band called The Challengers. He brought in bassist [[Randy Nauert]] and keyboardist Jim Roberts who had played with The Bel-Airs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/191123945 |title=Amazing Interview |publisher=vimeo.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref> Delvy later brought in guitarist Art Fisher who had played with The Bel-Airs during the recording of The Challengers third album ''On The Move''. Delvy also recruited Glenn Grey (lead guitar), Don Landis (rhythm guitar) and Nick Hefner (saxophone). They played at many high schools and many local dances and clubs. They eventually earned enough money to rent a recording studio, \"World Pacific\" to start recording. In about three and a half hours, they had an album titled ''Surfbeat''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nauert.com/ransurf.htm |title=Surfbeat |publisher=nauert.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref> Saxophonist Nick Hefner played on only one track. \n\n''Surfbeat'' was released in January 1963 on [[Vault Records]] and quickly went up the charts. Just months earlier, [[The Beach Boys]] released a vocal single called \"Surfin' Safari\". Some months before The Challenger's ''Surfbeat'' release, surf music icon [[Dick Dale]]'s first album ''Surfers' Choice'' was released. ''Surfbeat'' contained songs that were early influences on surf rock, including songs first recorded by [[The Fireballs]] and [[Duane Eddy]]. In the early years [[Rick Griffin]] contributed cartoons of the band that appeared on their albums and a fan oriented \"Challengers Band Cartoon Book\". He later became well known for his work creating psychedelic poster art later in the 1960's.\n\nThe original group released a second album titled ''Lloyd Thaxton Goes Surfing With The Challengers'' with the benefit of being associated with the popular teen television show host [[Lloyd Thaxton]].\n\n==Years of success==\n\nThe Challengers moved on and continued to record albums. During the recording of their third album ''On The Move'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_m6pdkPIgzVrl41BETzxTPbc_P4s2JQTuA |title=On The Move |publisher=youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref> Hefner, Grey, Roberts and Landis all left the band. Richard Delvy and Randy Nauert remained. Art Fisher and Ed Fournier filled two guitar spots and Phil Pruden came in on saxophone. Delvy, Fisher and Fournier also contributed to song compositions for the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/the-best-surf-music-bands-ever |title=The Best Surf Music Bands Ever |publisher=surfertoday.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref>\n\nIn 1964, they released their hit album ''K-39''. The title track became a big hit and is one of their best known songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nC8pX10f1Disa9sDwhgbczcmIHPbLRLNo |title=K-39 |publisher=youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref> The group continued their successful career, recording several albums a year, shocking by today's \"one album every two years\" pattern. They also had their own TV show called \"Surf's Up!\" hosted by Stan Richards in 1965-66<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nwWV5iz4zwRLGh27wI9J8X-jKYzHra1MM |title=Surf's Up! TV Show |publisher=youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref> and appeared frequently on another dance show called \"[[Hollywood A Go-Go]]\" hosted by Sam Riddle in 1965-66.

By 1967, they had gone the way of most other surf bands and stopped performing live, but still continued recording and releasing albums.

That successful relationship lasted for over 20 years.\n\nIn 1994, after 24 years of no new recordings, The Challengers reunited with some new members to release the album ''New Wave'' produced by band leader and founder Richard Delvy. Paul Johnson graciously joined the group to play guitar and composed.

They were located in [[Los Angeles]]. They represented a growing love for [[surf music]] and helped make the genre popular. Their debut album, ''[[Surfbeat]]'', was the biggest-selling surf album of all time and helped bring surf music from California to the rest of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-challengers-mn0000068584 |title=The Challengers |publisher=allmusic.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref>\n\n\n==Overview==\n\nThe band was formed out of the pioneer surf band called [[The Bel-Airs]]. The Bel-Airs were still in high school at the time, but scored a hit with an instrumental song titled \"Mr. Moto\". Their potential was cited by many, but it was an argument about use of the then new Fender reverb unit that led to their breakup. The Bel-Airs were originally formed by two guitarists, Eddie Bertrand and Paul Johnson, both 16 years old at the time they recorded \"Mr. Moto\". In early 1963, Eddie Bertrand heard [[Dick Dale]] using the [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] reverb unit and wanted to start incorporating heavy reverb into The Bel-Airs songs. He felt reverb was the sound that would come to define surf music. Even at 17, Johnson was something of an independent thinker and told Bertrand that The Bel-Airs had done quite well without [[Reverberation|reverb]] and he didn't see any reason at all to begin using it. The argument escalated until Bertrand finally left the band which then broke up for good shortly after. Johnson confirmed this story in the liner notes he contributed to The Bel-Airs reunion album released in 1986.\n\n==Early years==\n\nDuring their peak years, from late 1960 to Summer 1963, The Bel-Airs had two drummers who played gigs with the band alternately, original [[Mouseketeer]], Dick Dodd ([[Eddie & the Showmen]] and [[The Standells]]) and a local school friend named [[Richard Delvy]]. Delvy saw value in publishing, promoting and recording and began a career of managing and producing surf music. He then ultimately recorded numerous Southern California bands in the latter part of the 1960s. Since the 60's Delvy has produced many different musical artists and has made music management his lifelong passion.\n\nThe year before The Bel-Airs breakup, Richard Delvy left The Bel-Airs to form a new band called The Challengers. He brought in bassist [[Randy Nauert]] and keyboardist Jim Roberts who had played with The Bel-Airs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/191123945 |title=Amazing Interview |publisher=vimeo.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref> Delvy later brought in guitarist Art Fisher who had played with The Bel-Airs during the recording of The Challengers third album ''On The Move''. Delvy also recruited Glenn Grey (lead guitar), Don Landis (rhythm guitar) and Nick Hefner (saxophone). They played at many high schools and many local dances and clubs. They eventually earned enough money to rent a recording studio, \"World Pacific\" to start recording. In about three and a half hours, they had an album titled ''Surfbeat''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nauert.com/ransurf.htm |title=Surfbeat |publisher=nauert.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref> Saxophonist Nick Hefner played on only one track. \n\n''Surfbeat'' was released in January 1963 on [[Vault Records]] and quickly went up the charts. Just months earlier, [[The Beach Boys]] released a vocal single called \"Surfin' Safari\". Some months before The Challenger's ''Surfbeat'' release, surf music icon [[Dick Dale]]'s first album ''Surfers' Choice'' was released. ''Surfbeat'' contained songs that were early influences on surf rock, including songs first recorded by [[The Fireballs]] and [[Duane Eddy]]. In the early years [[Rick Griffin]] contributed cartoons of the band that appeared on their albums and a fan oriented \"Challengers Band Cartoon Book\". He later became well known for his work creating psychedelic poster art later in the 1960's.\n\nThe original group released a second album titled ''Lloyd Thaxton Goes Surfing With The Challengers'' with the benefit of being associated with the popular teen television show host [[Lloyd Thaxton]].\n\n==Years of success==\n\nThe Challengers moved on and continued to record albums. During the recording of their third album ''On The Move'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_m6pdkPIgzVrl41BETzxTPbc_P4s2JQTuA |title=On The Move |publisher=youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref> Hefner, Grey, Roberts and Landis all left the band. Richard Delvy and Randy Nauert remained. Art Fisher and Ed Fournier filled two guitar spots and Phil Pruden came in on saxophone. Delvy, Fisher and Fournier also contributed to song compositions for the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/the-best-surf-music-bands-ever |title=The Best Surf Music Bands Ever |publisher=surfertoday.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref>\n\nIn 1964, they released their hit album ''K-39''. The title track became a big hit and is one of their best known songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nC8pX10f1Disa9sDwhgbczcmIHPbLRLNo |title=K-39 |publisher=youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref> The group continued their successful career, recording several albums a year, shocking by today's \"one album every two years\" pattern. They also had their own TV show called \"Surf's Up!\" hosted by Stan Richards in 1965-66<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nwWV5iz4zwRLGh27wI9J8X-jKYzHra1MM |title=Surf's Up!

The island was Christianised from the 5th century onward. Following the 12th century [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasion]], [[Kingdom of England|England]] claimed sovereignty. However, English rule did not extend over the whole island until the 16th\u201317th century [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor conquest]], which led to [[Plantation of Ireland|colonisation by settlers from Britain]]. In the 1690s, a system of [[Protestant Ascendancy|Protestant English rule]] was designed to materially disadvantage the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] majority and Protestant [[dissenters]], and was extended during the 18th century.

A [[Irish War of Independence|war of independence]] in the early 20th century was followed by the [[Partition of Ireland|partition of the island]], creating the [[Irish Free State]], which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades, and Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom.

This theory draws on the ''[[Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn]]'', a medieval Christian pseudo-history of Ireland along with the presence of Celtic culture, language and artifacts found in Ireland such as Celtic bronze spears, shields, torcs and other finely crafted Celtic associated possessions. The theory holds that there were four separate Celtic invasions of Ireland. The [[Priteni]] were said to be the first, followed by the [[Belgae]] from northern Gaul and Britain. Later, Laighin tribes from Armorica (present-day Brittany) were said to have invaded Ireland and Britain more or less simultaneously. Lastly, the [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesians]] ([[Gaels]]) were said to have reached Ireland from either northern Iberia or southern Gaul.<ref>''The Celts: A History'', by D\u00e1ith\u00ed \u00d3 h\u00d3g\u00e1in</ref> It was claimed that a second wave named the Euerni, belonging to the Belgae people of northern Gaul, began arriving about the sixth century BC.

Norman settlements were characterised by the establishment of baronies, manors, towns and the seeds of the modern county system.

The Norman rulers and the Gaelic Irish elites intermarried and the areas under Norman rule became [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]]. In some parts, a hybrid Hiberno-Norman culture emerged. In response, the [[Parliament of Ireland#Middle Ages|Irish parliament]] passed the [[Statutes of Kilkenny]] in 1367.

F. Foster (historian)|R. F. Foster]]  argues the cause was a combination of a new sense of initiative and the entry of American corporations. He concludes the chief factors were low taxation, pro-business regulatory policies, and a young, tech-savvy workforce. For many multinationals the decision to do business in Ireland was made easier still by generous incentives from the [[IDA Ireland|Industrial Development Authority]]. In addition [[European Union]] membership was helpful, giving the country lucrative access to markets that it had previously reached only through the United Kingdom, and pumping huge subsidies and investment capital into the Irish economy.<ref>R. F. Foster, ''Luck and the Irish: A Brief History of Change 1970-2000'' (2007), pp 7-36.</ref>\n\nModernisation brought secularisation in its wake. The traditionally high levels of religiosity have sharply declined. Foster points to three factors: Irish feminism, largely imported from America with liberal stances on contraception, abortion, and divorce undermined the authority of bishops and priests. Second, the mishandling of the pedophile scandals humiliated the Church, whose bishops seemed less concerned with the victims and more concerned with covering up for errant priests. Third, prosperity brought hedonism and materialism that undercut the ideals of saintly poverty.<ref>Foster, ''Luck and the Irish'' pp 37-66.</ref>\n\nThe [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|financial crisis]] that began in 2008 dramatically ended this period of boom.

Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom, was not neutral during the Second World War, and [[Belfast Blitz|Belfast suffered four bombing raids]] in 1941.

Nationalists, mainly Roman Catholic, wanted to unite Ireland as an independent republic, whereas unionists, mainly Protestant, wanted Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom. The Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland voted largely along [[sectarian]] lines, meaning that the government of Northern Ireland (elected by [[Plurality electoral system|\"first-past-the-post\"]] from 1929) was controlled by the [[Ulster Unionist Party]]. Over time, the minority Catholic community felt increasingly alienated with further disaffection fuelled by practices such as [[gerrymandering]] and discrimination in housing and employment.<ref name=whyte>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/discrimination/whyte.htm |chapter=How much discrimination was there under the Unionist regime, 1921\u20131968? |last=Whyte |first=John |editor-first1=Tom |editor-last1=Gallagher |editor-first2=James |editor-last2=O'Connell |title=Contemporary Irish Studies |isbn=0-7190-0919-7 |publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] |via=[[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] |year=1983 |access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url= http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/cmd380.htm |title=Fair Employment in Northern Ireland |isbn=0-10-103802-X |year= 1988 |access-date=23 October 2008 |author=Northern Ireland Office |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office |via=Conflict Archive on the Internet|author-link=Northern Ireland Office }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/crights/nicra/nicra78.htm |title='We Shall Overcome' ...

There were several unsuccessful attempts to end the Troubles politically, such as the [[Sunningdale Agreement]] of 1973. In 1998, following a ceasefire by the Provisional IRA and multi-party talks, the [[Good Friday Agreement]] was concluded as a treaty between the British and Irish governments, annexing the text agreed in the multi-party talks.\n\nThe substance of the Agreement (formally referred to as the Belfast Agreement) was later endorsed by referendums in both parts of Ireland. The Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of power-sharing in a regional [[Northern Ireland Executive|Executive]] drawn from the major parties in a new [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], with entrenched protections for the two main communities. The Executive is jointly headed by a [[First Minister and deputy First Minister]] drawn from the unionist and nationalist parties. Violence had decreased greatly after the Provisional IRA and loyalist ceasefires in 1994 and in 2005 the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and an [[Independent International Commission on Decommissioning|independent commission]] supervised its disarmament and that of other nationalist and unionist paramilitary organisations.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/peace/decommission/iicd190106.pdf |first=Tauno |last=Nieminen |first2=John |last2=de Chastelain |author3=Andrew D.

Overall, Ireland has a mild but changeable [[oceanic climate]] with few extremes. The climate is typically insular and is [[Temperate climate|temperate]], avoiding the extremes in temperature of many other areas in the world at similar latitudes.<ref name=\"MEclimate\">{{cite web |title=Climate of Ireland |website=Climate |publisher={{lang|ga|Met \u00c9ireann}}|url= http://www.met.ie/climate/climate-of-ireland.asp |access-date=11 November 2008}}</ref> This is a result of the moderating moist winds which ordinarily prevail from the southwestern Atlantic.\n\nPrecipitation falls throughout the year but is light overall, particularly in the east. The west tends to be wetter on average and prone to Atlantic storms, especially in the late autumn and winter months. These occasionally bring destructive winds and higher total rainfall to these areas, as well as sometimes snow and hail. The regions of north County Galway and east County Mayo have the highest incidents of recorded lightning annually for the island, with lightning occurring approximately five to ten days per year in these areas.<ref name=\"MErainfall\">{{cite web |title=Rainfall |website=Climate |publisher={{lang|ga|Met \u00c9ireann}} |url= http://www.met.ie/climate/rainfall.asp |access-date=5 November 2008}}</ref> [[Munster]], in the south, records the least snow whereas [[Ulster]], in the north, records the most.\n\nInland areas are warmer in summer and colder in winter. Usually around 40 days of the year are below freezing {{nowrap|0&nbsp;\u00b0C}} {{nowrap|(32&nbsp;\u00b0F)}} at inland [[weather station]]s, compared to 10 days at coastal stations.

Hedgerows, however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as a refuge for native wild flora. This ecosystem stretches across the countryside and acts as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island. Subsidies under the [[Common Agricultural Policy]], which supported agricultural practices that preserved hedgerow environments, are undergoing reforms. The Common Agricultural Policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices, for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides; but reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements.<ref name=\"cap_reforms\">{{cite web |title=CAP Reform \u2013 A Long-term Perspective for Sustainable Agriculture |website=Agriculture and Rural Development |publisher=European Commission |url= http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-post-2013/index_en.htm |access-date=30 July 2007}}</ref> 32% of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions are correlated to agriculture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.ie/irelandsenvironment/climate/|title=Climate Change Causes|date=2014|publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency (Ireland)]]|access-date=4 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nForested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates.

The population rebounded and multiplied over the next century, but the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of the 1840s caused one million deaths and forced over one million more to emigrate in its immediate wake. Over the following century, the population was reduced by over half, at a time when the general trend in European countries was for populations to rise by an average of three-fold.\n\nIreland's largest religious group is [[Christianity]].

As such, ''Ulster'' is often used as a synonym for Northern Ireland, although the two are not coterminous.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, counties form the basis of the system of local government. Counties [[County Dublin|Dublin]], [[County Cork|Cork]], [[County Limerick|Limerick]], [[County Galway|Galway]], [[County Waterford|Waterford]] and [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] have been broken up into smaller administrative areas.

However, by far the greater cause of population decline was the dire economic state of the country which led to an entrenched culture of emigration lasting until the 21st century.\n\nEmigration from Ireland in the 19th century contributed to the populations of England, the United States, Canada and Australia, in all of which a large [[Irish diaspora]] lives. {{As of|2006}}, 4.3 million Canadians, or 14% of the population, are of Irish descent,<ref>\"[http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/hlt/97-562/pages/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo=PR&Code=01&Table=2&Data=Count&StartRec=1&Sort=3&Display=All&CSDFilter=5000 Ethnic origins, 2006 counts, for Canada, provinces and territories \u2013 20% sample data]\".

Each language has produced noteworthy literature. Irish, though now only the language of a minority, was the vernacular of the Irish people for thousands of years and was possibly introduced during the [[Iron Age]]. It began to be written down after Christianisation in the 5th century and spread to Scotland and the Isle of Man, where it evolved into the [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Manx Language|Manx]] languages respectively.\n\nThe Irish language has a vast treasury of written texts from many centuries and is divided by linguists into [[Old Irish]] from the 6th to 10th century, [[Middle Irish]] from the 10th to 13th century, Early Modern Irish until the 17th century, and the Modern Irish spoken today. It remained the dominant language of Ireland for most of those periods, having influences from [[Latin Language|Latin]], [[Old Norse]], [[Anglo-Norman language|French]] and English. It declined under British rule but remained the majority tongue until the early 19th century, and since then has been a minority language.\n\nThe [[Gaelic Revival]] of the early 20th century has had a long-term influence. Irish is taught in mainstream Irish schools as a compulsory subject, but teaching methods have been criticised for their ineffectiveness, with the lack of level of ability after, typically, fourteen years of instruction cited.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://universitytimes.ie/?p=1707 |title=Head-to-Head: The Irish Language Debate |work=UniversityTimes.ie |date=21 February 2011 |access-date=31 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nThere is now an extensive network of urban Irish speakers in both the Republic and Northern Ireland, especially in Dublin and Belfast.

Poetry in Irish is among the oldest [[vernacular literature|vernacular poetry]] in Europe, with the earliest examples dating from the 6th century.\nIrish remained the dominant literary language down to the nineteenth century, despite the spread of English from the seventeenth century on. Prominent names from the medieval period and later include {{lang|ga|[[Gofraidh Fionn \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh]]}} (fourteenth century), {{lang|ga|[[D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Bruadair]]}} (seventeenth century) and [[Aog\u00e1n \u00d3 Rathaille]] (eighteenth century). {{lang|ga|[[Eibhl\u00edn Dubh N\u00ed Chonaill]]}} (c. 1743 \u2013 c. 1800) was an outstanding poet in the oral tradition. The latter part of the nineteenth century saw a rapid replacement of Irish by English. By 1900, however, cultural nationalists had begun the [[Gaelic revival]], which saw the beginnings of modern literature in Irish. This was to produce a number of notable writers, including {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Cadhain]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1ire Mhac an tSaoi]]}} and others. Irish-language publishers such as {{lang|ga|[[Coisc\u00e9im]]}} and {{lang|ga|[[Cl\u00f3 Iar-Chonnacht]]}} continue to produce scores of titles every year.\n\nIn English, [[Jonathan Swift]], often called the foremost [[satirist]] in the English language, gained fame for works such as ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and ''[[A Modest Proposal]]''. Other notable 18th-century writers of Irish origin included [[Oliver Goldsmith]] and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], though they spent most of their lives in England. The Anglo\u2013Irish novel came to the fore in the nineteenth century, featuring such writers as [[Charles Kickham]], [[William Carleton]], and (in collaboration) [[Edith Somerville]] and [[Violet Florence Martin]]. The playwright and poet [[Oscar Wilde]], noted for his epigrams, was born in Ireland.\n\nIn the 20th century, Ireland produced four winners of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]: [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[Seamus Heaney]]. Although not a [[Nobel Prize]] winner, [[James Joyce]] is widely considered to be one of the most significant writers of the 20th century. Joyce's 1922 novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' is considered one of the most important works of [[Modernist literature]] and his life is celebrated annually on 16 June in Dublin as \"[[Bloomsday]]\".<ref>{{cite web |title=What is Bloomsday? |publisher=James Joyce Centre |url= http://jamesjoyce.ie/what-is-bloomsday/ |access-date=4 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140916080551/http://jamesjoyce.ie/what-is-bloomsday/ |archive-date=16 September 2014}}</ref> A comparable writer in Irish is {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Cadhain]]}}, whose novel {{lang|ga|[[Cr\u00e9 na Cille]]}} is regarded as a modernist masterpiece and has been translated into several languages.\n\nModern Irish literature is often connected with its rural heritage<ref>{{Cite book |first=Andrew |last=Higgins Wyndham |title=Re-imagining Ireland |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville |date=2006}}</ref> through English-language writers such as [[John McGahern]] and [[Seamus Heaney]] and Irish-language writers such as {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Dire\u00e1in]]}} and others from the {{lang|ga|[[Gaeltacht]]}}.\n\n[[File:Revolutionary Joyce.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Joyce]] one of the most significant writers of the 20th century]]\n\n====Music====\nMusic has been in evidence in Ireland since prehistoric times.<ref>O'Dwyer, Simon: ''Prehistoric Music in Ireland'' (Stroud, Gloucestershire: Tempus Publishing, 2004), {{ISBN|0-7524-3129-3}}.</ref> Although in the early Middle Ages the church was \"quite unlike its counterpart in continental Europe\",<ref>Brannon, Patrick V.: \"Medieval Ireland: Music in Cathedral, Church and Cloister\", in: ''Early Music'' 28.2 (May 2000), p. 193.</ref> there was considerable interchange between monastic settlements in Ireland and the rest of Europe that contributed to what is known as [[Gregorian chant]]. Outside religious establishments, musical genres in early Gaelic Ireland are referred to as a triad of weeping music (''goltraige''), laughing music (''geantraige'') and sleeping music (''suantraige'').<ref>Buckley, Ann: \"Medieval Ireland, Music in\", in: ''The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'', ed. by [[Harry White (musicologist)|Harry White]] and Barra Boydell (Dublin: UCD Press, 2013), {{ISBN|978-1-906359-78-2}}, p. 659.</ref> Vocal and instrumental music (e.g. for the harp, pipes, and various [[string instrument]]s) was transmitted orally, but the [[Irish harp]], in particular, was of such significance that it became Ireland's national symbol. Classical music following European models first developed in urban areas, in establishments of Anglo-Irish rule such as [[Dublin Castle]], [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St Patrick's Cathedral]] and [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church]] as well as the country houses of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, with the first performance of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' (1742) being among the highlights of the baroque era. In the 19th century, public concerts provided access to classical music to all classes of society. Yet, for political and financial reasons Ireland has been too small to provide a living to many musicians, so the names of the better-known [[List of Irish classical composers|Irish composers]] of this time belong to emigrants.\n\nIrish [[folk music|traditional music]] and [[dance]] has seen a surge in popularity and global coverage since the 1960s.

Groups and musicians including [[Horslips]], [[Van Morrison]] and [[Thin Lizzy]] incorporated elements of Irish traditional music into contemporary [[rock music]] and, during the 1970s and 1980s, the distinction between traditional and rock musicians became blurred, with many individuals regularly crossing over between these styles of playing. This trend can be seen more recently in the work of artists like [[Enya]], [[The Saw Doctors]], [[The Corrs]], [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]], [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]], [[The Cranberries]] and [[The Pogues]] among others.\n\n====Art====\nThe earliest known Irish graphic art and sculpture are Neolithic carvings found at sites such as [[Newgrange]]<ref>{{Cite book |last1=O'Kelly |first1=Michael J. |last2=O'Kelly |first2=Claire |title=Newgrange: Archaeology Art and Legend |publisher=Thames and Hudson |date=1982 |location=London |url= https://books.google.com/?id=bGiMHQAACAAJ |isbn=978-0-500-27371-5}}</ref> and is traced through [[Bronze Age]] artefacts and the religious carvings and [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the medieval period.

The game has been played in an organised fashion in Ireland since the 1870s, with [[Cliftonville F.C.]] in Belfast being Ireland's oldest club. It was most popular, especially in its first decades, around Belfast and in Ulster. However, some clubs based outside Belfast thought that the IFA largely favoured Ulster-based clubs in such matters as selection for the national team. In 1921, following an incident in which, despite an earlier promise, the IFA moved an [[Irish Cup]] semi-final replay from Dublin to Belfast,<ref>{{cite web |title=FAI History: 1921\u20131930 |publisher=Football Association of Ireland |date=5 June 2009 |url= http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=222&Itemid=226 |access-date=30 December 2009}}</ref> Dublin-based clubs broke away to form the Football Association of the Irish Free State. Today the southern association is known as the [[Football Association of Ireland]] (FAI). Despite being initially blacklisted by the [[Home Nations]]' associations, the FAI was recognised by [[FIFA]] in 1923 and organised its first international fixture in 1926 (against [[Italy national football team|Italy]]). However, both the IFA and FAI continued to select their teams from the whole of Ireland, with some players earning international caps for matches with both teams. Both also referred to their respective teams as ''Ireland''.\n\n[[File:Paul O'Connell Ireland Rugby.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul O'Connell]] reaching for the ball during a [[Line-out (rugby union)|line out]] against [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] in 2007.]]\nIn 1950, FIFA directed the associations only to select players from within their respective territories and, in 1953, directed that the FAI's team be known only as \"[[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]\" and that the IFA's team be known as \"[[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]]\" (with certain exceptions). Northern Ireland qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] finals in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] (reaching the quarter-finals), [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] and the [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]] in [[UEFA Euro 2016|2016]].

Across Ireland, there is significant interest in the [[Premier League|English]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Scottish Premier League|Scottish]] soccer leagues.\n\nIreland fields a single [[Ireland national rugby union team|national rugby team]] and a single association, the [[Irish Rugby Football Union]], governs the sport across the island. The Irish rugby team have played in every [[Rugby World Cup]], making the quarter-finals in six of them. Ireland also hosted games during the [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]] and the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]]s (including a quarter-final). There are four professional Irish teams; all four play in the [[Pro14]] and at least three compete for the [[Heineken Cup]].

Donegal Bay is shaped like a funnel and catches west/south-west Atlantic winds, creating good surf, especially in winter. Since just before the year 2010, [[Bundoran]] has hosted European championship surfing. [[Scuba diving]] is increasingly popular in Ireland with clear waters and large populations of sea life, particularly along the western seaboard.

While [[salmon]] and [[trout]] fishing remain popular with anglers, salmon fishing in particular received a boost in 2006 with the closing of the salmon [[driftnet]] fishery. [[Coarse fishing]] continues to increase its profile. Sea angling is developed with many beaches mapped and signposted,<ref>{{cite web |title=Fishing in Ireland |publisher=Central and Regional Fisheries Boards |url= http://www.fishinginireland.info |access-date=26 March 2010}}</ref> and the range of sea angling species is around 80.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sea Fishing in Ireland |publisher=Central and Regional Fisheries Boards |url= http://www.fishinginireland.info/sea |access-date=26 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Food and drink===\n{{main|Irish cuisine}}\n[[File:Cheese 61 bg 080106.jpg|thumb|[[Gubbeen cheese]], an example of the resurgence in Irish cheese making]]\nFood and cuisine in Ireland takes its influence from the crops grown and animals farmed in the island's temperate climate and from the social and political circumstances of Irish history.

The island was Christianised from the 5th century onward. Following the 12th century [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasion]], [[Kingdom of England|England]] claimed sovereignty. However, English rule did not extend over the whole island until the 16th\u201317th century [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor conquest]], which led to [[Plantation of Ireland|colonisation by settlers from Britain]]. In the 1690s, a system of [[Protestant Ascendancy|Protestant English rule]] was designed to materially disadvantage the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] majority and Protestant [[dissenters]], and was extended during the 18th century. With the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] in 1801, Ireland became [[Countries of the United Kingdom|a part of]] the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. A [[Irish War of Independence|war of independence]] in the early 20th century was followed by the [[Partition of Ireland|partition of the island]], creating the [[Irish Free State]], which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades, and Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland saw much [[The Troubles|civil unrest from the late 1960s until the 1990s]]. This subsided following [[Good Friday Agreement|a political agreement]] in 1998. In 1973 the Republic of Ireland joined the [[European Economic Community]] while the United Kingdom, and Northern Ireland, as part of it, did the same.\n\n[[Irish culture]] has had a significant influence on other cultures, especially in the field of [[Irish literature|literature]].

This theory draws on the ''[[Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn]]'', a medieval Christian pseudo-history of Ireland along with the presence of Celtic culture, language and artifacts found in Ireland such as Celtic bronze spears, shields, torcs and other finely crafted Celtic associated possessions. The theory holds that there were four separate Celtic invasions of Ireland. The [[Priteni]] were said to be the first, followed by the [[Belgae]] from northern Gaul and Britain.

The pre-eminent Irish political figure after the Union was [[Daniel O'Connell]]. He was elected as Member of Parliament for [[Ennis (UK Parliament constituency)|Ennis]] in a surprise result and despite being unable to take his seat [[The Test Act|as a Roman Catholic]]. O'Connell spearheaded a vigorous campaign that was taken up by the Prime Minister, the Irish-born soldier and statesman, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. Steering the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Bill]] through Parliament, aided by future prime minister [[Robert Peel]], Wellington prevailed upon a reluctant [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] to sign the Bill and proclaim it into law. [[George III of the United Kingdom|George's father]] had opposed the plan of the earlier Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt the Younger]], to introduce such a bill following the Union of 1801, fearing [[Catholic Emancipation]] to be in conflict with the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].\n\nDaniel O'Connell led a subsequent campaign, for the repeal of the Act of Union, which failed. Later in the century, [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and others campaigned for autonomy within the Union, or \"[[Irish Home Rule Bills|Home Rule]]\". Unionists, especially those located in Ulster, were strongly opposed to Home Rule, which they thought would be dominated by Catholic interests.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kee |first=Robert |title=The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |date=1972 |location=London |pages=376\u2013400 |isbn=978-0-297-17987-0}}</ref> After several attempts to pass a Home Rule bill through parliament, it looked certain that one would finally pass in 1914.

The Act was passed but with the \"temporary\" exclusion of the six counties of Ulster that would become Northern Ireland. Before it could be implemented, however, the Act was suspended for the duration of the [[World War I|First World War]]. The Irish Volunteers split into two groups. The majority, approximately 175,000 in number, under [[John Redmond]], took the name [[National Volunteers]] and supported [[Ireland and World War I|Irish involvement]] in the war.

He concludes the chief factors were low taxation, pro-business regulatory policies, and a young, tech-savvy workforce. For many multinationals the decision to do business in Ireland was made easier still by generous incentives from the [[IDA Ireland|Industrial Development Authority]]. In addition [[European Union]] membership was helpful, giving the country lucrative access to markets that it had previously reached only through the United Kingdom, and pumping huge subsidies and investment capital into the Irish economy.<ref>R.

The traditionally high levels of religiosity have sharply declined. Foster points to three factors: Irish feminism, largely imported from America with liberal stances on contraception, abortion, and divorce undermined the authority of bishops and priests. Second, the mishandling of the pedophile scandals humiliated the Church, whose bishops seemed less concerned with the victims and more concerned with covering up for errant priests. Third, prosperity brought hedonism and materialism that undercut the ideals of saintly poverty.<ref>Foster, ''Luck and the Irish'' pp 37-66.</ref>\n\nThe [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|financial crisis]] that began in 2008 dramatically ended this period of boom.

Overall, Ireland has a mild but changeable [[oceanic climate]] with few extremes. The climate is typically insular and is [[Temperate climate|temperate]], avoiding the extremes in temperature of many other areas in the world at similar latitudes.<ref name=\"MEclimate\">{{cite web |title=Climate of Ireland |website=Climate |publisher={{lang|ga|Met \u00c9ireann}}|url= http://www.met.ie/climate/climate-of-ireland.asp |access-date=11 November 2008}}</ref> This is a result of the moderating moist winds which ordinarily prevail from the southwestern Atlantic.\n\nPrecipitation falls throughout the year but is light overall, particularly in the east. The west tends to be wetter on average and prone to Atlantic storms, especially in the late autumn and winter months. These occasionally bring destructive winds and higher total rainfall to these areas, as well as sometimes snow and hail. The regions of north County Galway and east County Mayo have the highest incidents of recorded lightning annually for the island, with lightning occurring approximately five to ten days per year in these areas.<ref name=\"MErainfall\">{{cite web |title=Rainfall |website=Climate |publisher={{lang|ga|Met \u00c9ireann}} |url= http://www.met.ie/climate/rainfall.asp |access-date=5 November 2008}}</ref> [[Munster]], in the south, records the least snow whereas [[Ulster]], in the north, records the most.\n\nInland areas are warmer in summer and colder in winter.

Hedgerows, however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as a refuge for native wild flora. This ecosystem stretches across the countryside and acts as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island. Subsidies under the [[Common Agricultural Policy]], which supported agricultural practices that preserved hedgerow environments, are undergoing reforms. The Common Agricultural Policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices, for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides; but reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements.<ref name=\"cap_reforms\">{{cite web |title=CAP Reform \u2013 A Long-term Perspective for Sustainable Agriculture |website=Agriculture and Rural Development |publisher=European Commission |url= http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-post-2013/index_en.htm |access-date=30 July 2007}}</ref> 32% of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions are correlated to agriculture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.ie/irelandsenvironment/climate/|title=Climate Change Causes|date=2014|publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency (Ireland)]]|access-date=4 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nForested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates.

Each language has produced noteworthy literature. Irish, though now only the language of a minority, was the vernacular of the Irish people for thousands of years and was possibly introduced during the [[Iron Age]]. It began to be written down after Christianisation in the 5th century and spread to Scotland and the Isle of Man, where it evolved into the [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Manx Language|Manx]] languages respectively.\n\nThe Irish language has a vast treasury of written texts from many centuries and is divided by linguists into [[Old Irish]] from the 6th to 10th century, [[Middle Irish]] from the 10th to 13th century, Early Modern Irish until the 17th century, and the Modern Irish spoken today. It remained the dominant language of Ireland for most of those periods, having influences from [[Latin Language|Latin]], [[Old Norse]], [[Anglo-Norman language|French]] and English. It declined under British rule but remained the majority tongue until the early 19th century, and since then has been a minority language.\n\nThe [[Gaelic Revival]] of the early 20th century has had a long-term influence. Irish is taught in mainstream Irish schools as a compulsory subject, but teaching methods have been criticised for their ineffectiveness, with the lack of level of ability after, typically, fourteen years of instruction cited.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://universitytimes.ie/?p=1707 |title=Head-to-Head: The Irish Language Debate |work=UniversityTimes.ie |date=21 February 2011 |access-date=31 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nThere is now an extensive network of urban Irish speakers in both the Republic and Northern Ireland, especially in Dublin and Belfast.

Poetry in Irish is among the oldest [[vernacular literature|vernacular poetry]] in Europe, with the earliest examples dating from the 6th century.\nIrish remained the dominant literary language down to the nineteenth century, despite the spread of English from the seventeenth century on. Prominent names from the medieval period and later include {{lang|ga|[[Gofraidh Fionn \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh]]}} (fourteenth century), {{lang|ga|[[D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Bruadair]]}} (seventeenth century) and [[Aog\u00e1n \u00d3 Rathaille]] (eighteenth century). {{lang|ga|[[Eibhl\u00edn Dubh N\u00ed Chonaill]]}} (c. 1743 \u2013 c. 1800) was an outstanding poet in the oral tradition. The latter part of the nineteenth century saw a rapid replacement of Irish by English. By 1900, however, cultural nationalists had begun the [[Gaelic revival]], which saw the beginnings of modern literature in Irish. This was to produce a number of notable writers, including {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Cadhain]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1ire Mhac an tSaoi]]}} and others. Irish-language publishers such as {{lang|ga|[[Coisc\u00e9im]]}} and {{lang|ga|[[Cl\u00f3 Iar-Chonnacht]]}} continue to produce scores of titles every year.\n\nIn English, [[Jonathan Swift]], often called the foremost [[satirist]] in the English language, gained fame for works such as ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and ''[[A Modest Proposal]]''. Other notable 18th-century writers of Irish origin included [[Oliver Goldsmith]] and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], though they spent most of their lives in England. The Anglo\u2013Irish novel came to the fore in the nineteenth century, featuring such writers as [[Charles Kickham]], [[William Carleton]], and (in collaboration) [[Edith Somerville]] and [[Violet Florence Martin]]. The playwright and poet [[Oscar Wilde]], noted for his epigrams, was born in Ireland.\n\nIn the 20th century, Ireland produced four winners of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]: [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[Seamus Heaney]]. Although not a [[Nobel Prize]] winner, [[James Joyce]] is widely considered to be one of the most significant writers of the 20th century. Joyce's 1922 novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' is considered one of the most important works of [[Modernist literature]] and his life is celebrated annually on 16 June in Dublin as \"[[Bloomsday]]\".<ref>{{cite web |title=What is Bloomsday? |publisher=James Joyce Centre |url= http://jamesjoyce.ie/what-is-bloomsday/ |access-date=4 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140916080551/http://jamesjoyce.ie/what-is-bloomsday/ |archive-date=16 September 2014}}</ref> A comparable writer in Irish is {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Cadhain]]}}, whose novel {{lang|ga|[[Cr\u00e9 na Cille]]}} is regarded as a modernist masterpiece and has been translated into several languages.\n\nModern Irish literature is often connected with its rural heritage<ref>{{Cite book |first=Andrew |last=Higgins Wyndham |title=Re-imagining Ireland |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville |date=2006}}</ref> through English-language writers such as [[John McGahern]] and [[Seamus Heaney]] and Irish-language writers such as {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Dire\u00e1in]]}} and others from the {{lang|ga|[[Gaeltacht]]}}.\n\n[[File:Revolutionary Joyce.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Joyce]] one of the most significant writers of the 20th century]]\n\n====Music====\nMusic has been in evidence in Ireland since prehistoric times.<ref>O'Dwyer, Simon: ''Prehistoric Music in Ireland'' (Stroud, Gloucestershire: Tempus Publishing, 2004), {{ISBN|0-7524-3129-3}}.</ref> Although in the early Middle Ages the church was \"quite unlike its counterpart in continental Europe\",<ref>Brannon, Patrick V.: \"Medieval Ireland: Music in Cathedral, Church and Cloister\", in: ''Early Music'' 28.2 (May 2000), p. 193.</ref> there was considerable interchange between monastic settlements in Ireland and the rest of Europe that contributed to what is known as [[Gregorian chant]]. Outside religious establishments, musical genres in early Gaelic Ireland are referred to as a triad of weeping music (''goltraige''), laughing music (''geantraige'') and sleeping music (''suantraige'').<ref>Buckley, Ann: \"Medieval Ireland, Music in\", in: ''The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'', ed. by [[Harry White (musicologist)|Harry White]] and Barra Boydell (Dublin: UCD Press, 2013), {{ISBN|978-1-906359-78-2}}, p. 659.</ref> Vocal and instrumental music (e.g. for the harp, pipes, and various [[string instrument]]s) was transmitted orally, but the [[Irish harp]], in particular, was of such significance that it became Ireland's national symbol. Classical music following European models first developed in urban areas, in establishments of Anglo-Irish rule such as [[Dublin Castle]], [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St Patrick's Cathedral]] and [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church]] as well as the country houses of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, with the first performance of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' (1742) being among the highlights of the baroque era. In the 19th century, public concerts provided access to classical music to all classes of society. Yet, for political and financial reasons Ireland has been too small to provide a living to many musicians, so the names of the better-known [[List of Irish classical composers|Irish composers]] of this time belong to emigrants.\n\nIrish [[folk music|traditional music]] and [[dance]] has seen a surge in popularity and global coverage since the 1960s. In the middle years of the 20th century, as Irish society was modernising, traditional music had fallen out of favour, especially in urban areas.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Geraghty |first=Des |title=Luke Kelly: A Memoir |publisher=Basement Press |date=1994 |pages=26\u201330 |isbn=978-1-85594-090-1}}</ref> However during the 1960s, there was a revival of interest in Irish traditional music led by groups such as [[The Dubliners]], [[The Chieftains]], [[The Wolfe Tones]], the [[Clancy Brothers]], [[Sweeney's Men]] and individuals like {{lang|ga|[[Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Riada]]}} and [[Christy Moore]]. Groups and musicians including [[Horslips]], [[Van Morrison]] and [[Thin Lizzy]] incorporated elements of Irish traditional music into contemporary [[rock music]] and, during the 1970s and 1980s, the distinction between traditional and rock musicians became blurred, with many individuals regularly crossing over between these styles of playing. This trend can be seen more recently in the work of artists like [[Enya]], [[The Saw Doctors]], [[The Corrs]], [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]], [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]], [[The Cranberries]] and [[The Pogues]] among others.\n\n====Art====\nThe earliest known Irish graphic art and sculpture are Neolithic carvings found at sites such as [[Newgrange]]<ref>{{Cite book |last1=O'Kelly |first1=Michael J. |last2=O'Kelly |first2=Claire |title=Newgrange: Archaeology Art and Legend |publisher=Thames and Hudson |date=1982 |location=London |url= https://books.google.com/?id=bGiMHQAACAAJ |isbn=978-0-500-27371-5}}</ref> and is traced through [[Bronze Age]] artefacts and the religious carvings and [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the medieval period.

The game has been played in an organised fashion in Ireland since the 1870s, with [[Cliftonville F.C.]] in Belfast being Ireland's oldest club. It was most popular, especially in its first decades, around Belfast and in Ulster. However, some clubs based outside Belfast thought that the IFA largely favoured Ulster-based clubs in such matters as selection for the national team. In 1921, following an incident in which, despite an earlier promise, the IFA moved an [[Irish Cup]] semi-final replay from Dublin to Belfast,<ref>{{cite web |title=FAI History: 1921\u20131930 |publisher=Football Association of Ireland |date=5 June 2009 |url= http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=222&Itemid=226 |access-date=30 December 2009}}</ref> Dublin-based clubs broke away to form the Football Association of the Irish Free State. Today the southern association is known as the [[Football Association of Ireland]] (FAI). Despite being initially blacklisted by the [[Home Nations]]' associations, the FAI was recognised by [[FIFA]] in 1923 and organised its first international fixture in 1926 (against [[Italy national football team|Italy]]). However, both the IFA and FAI continued to select their teams from the whole of Ireland, with some players earning international caps for matches with both teams. Both also referred to their respective teams as ''Ireland''.\n\n[[File:Paul O'Connell Ireland Rugby.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul O'Connell]] reaching for the ball during a [[Line-out (rugby union)|line out]] against [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] in 2007.]]\nIn 1950, FIFA directed the associations only to select players from within their respective territories and, in 1953, directed that the FAI's team be known only as \"[[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]\" and that the IFA's team be known as \"[[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]]\" (with certain exceptions). Northern Ireland qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] finals in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] (reaching the quarter-finals), [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] and the [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]] in [[UEFA Euro 2016|2016]].

Completed in 1916, she was assigned to the [[Dover Patrol]] where her primary duties involved bombarding German targets on the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|Belgian coast]], particularly at the ports of [[Zeebrugge]] and [[Ostend]]. In October 1917 ''Terror'' was hit by three torpedoes, taking severe damage to the bow and had to be towed into [[Portsmouth]] for repair. In April 1918 she participated in the [[Zeebrugge raid]] and provided gunnery support for the [[Fifth Battle of Ypres]] in September of the same year.\n\nAfter the war the monitor was attached to [[HMS Excellent (shore establishment)|HMS ''Excellent'']], the Royal Navy's gunnery school in Portsmouth and participated in gunnery trials in the 1920s. In January 1934 ''Terror'' became the base ship at [[Singapore Naval Base|Sembawang Naval Base]] in [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]] where she remained for the rest of the decade. From May 1939 to the end of the year she underwent an extensive refit in Singapore's dockyards.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Second World War and the completion of her refit, ''Terror'' was ordered home to Europe in January 1940. From early March the monitor served in the Mediterranean where she defended [[Siege of Malta (1940)|Malta]] from Italian air raids before supporting the land-based assault of Italian positions in North Africa at the end of the year. In January 1941 the ship assisted with the capture of [[Bardia]] and [[Tobruk]] before she attempted to defend [[Benghazi]] from German air attacks in February. Suffering damage from two air attacks and two mines on 22 and 23 February, ''Terror'' was [[scuttled]] off the coast of [[Italian Libya|Libya]] in the early hours of 24 February. The crew were evacuated to the [[minesweeper]] {{HMS|Fareham|J89|2}} and [[corvette]] {{HMS|Salvia|K97|2}} prior to her sinking.\n\n==Background==\nDuring the First World War, the Royal Navy developed several classes of ships which were designed to give close support to troops ashore through the use of [[Naval Gunfire Support|naval bombardment]].<ref>Crossley 2013 c. 1; Buxton 2008 c. 1</ref> Termed [[Monitor (warship)|monitors]], they owed little to the monitors of the 19th century, though they shared the characteristics of poor seaworthiness, shallow [[Draft (hull)|draught]] and heavy armament in turrets. The size of the various monitor classes of the Royal Navy and their armaments varied greatly. The {{sclass-|Marshal Ney|monitor|4}} was the United Kingdom's first attempt at a monitor carrying {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} guns.<ref>Crossley 2013 c. 2, para. 24</ref> Following construction of the first two of the ''Marshall Ney-class'', another four were ordered in May 1915, with the [[Harland and Wolff]] [[shipyard]] at [[Govan]] receiving a contract to construct two hulls, which were given [[yard number]]s 492 and 493. However, all four were cancelled in June when it was realised that there were insufficient gun turrets to complete both the [[battleship]], {{HMS|Royal Oak|08|2}}, and the monitors before 1917.<ref>Buxton 2008 c. 8.1</ref>\n\nBy August 1915, {{HMS|Marshal Ney||2}}, the first of its class, had revealed a very poor performance in its sea trials. Its engines would not start reliably and were prone to stalling,<ref>Crossley 2013 c. 2, para. 25</ref> making it impossible for the ship to achieve even the minimum standard for the trial of four hours of continuous sailing at full power. The vessel was also difficult to steer.<ref>Buxton 2008 c. 4.2, para. 3</ref> Disappointed by the failure, the [[Admiralty]] began the design of a replacement class on 6 September, which incorporated lessons learned from all of the previous classes of monitor commissioned during the war. Some of the main modifications were an increase in the power supply to guarantee a speed of {{convert|12|kn}} and a change to the angles and lines of the hull to improve steering. Another significant change was to raise the top of the [[anti-torpedo bulge]] above the waterline and reduce its width; both changes would improve the stability and maneuverability of the ship at sea. The bulge was fitted along each side of the ship and was intended to absorb the impact of any explosions. To maintain protection while reducing the bulge's width, its inner compartment was made water tight and filled with 70 steel tubes, rather than leaving the inner compartment open to the sea as in previous designs.<ref name=\"Brown1999p148\">Brown 1999 p. 148</ref><ref name=\"Buxton8.2p2\">Buxton 2008 c. 8.2</ref>\n\n==Design and construction==\nThe new design, which would later be named the ''Erebus''-class, was for a vessel {{convert|405|ft|m|abbr=on|lk=on|1}} long, {{convert|88|ft|2|in|m|abbr=on|1}} [[Beam (nautical)|wide]] with a draught of {{convert|11|ft|8|in|m|abbr=on|1}}.

''Terror'' was [[laid down]] at Harland and Wolff's shipyard in Belfast, Northern Ireland on 26 October 1915 and [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 18 May 1916.<ref name=\"BelfastConstruct\">Buxton 2008 c. 8.3</ref>\n\nThe ship's main armament consisted of two [[BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun|BL 15{{&nbsp}}in Mk I naval guns]] in a single forward [[Gun turret|turret]]. ''Terror's'' turret had belonged to ''Marshal Ney'', which had been rearmed with smaller guns following its poor sea trials.<ref>Crossley 2013 c. 2, para. 29</ref>{{efn-lr|There is some confusion in the sources as to the fate of ''Marshall Ney's'' turret. Jane's Fighting Ships (1919) states that it was fitted to ''Erebus''.<ref name=\"Janes1919\">Parkes & Prendergast 1919 p. 90</ref> However Buxton (2008) and Crossley (2013) both agree that ''Ney's'' turret was fitted to ''Terror'' in Belfast while ''Erebus'' received at [[Clydebank]] a gun originally intended as a spare for {{HMS|Furious|47|2}}.}} Learning from the earlier experience with ''Ney'', the turrets were adjusted to increase elevation to 30 degrees, which would add greater firing range.<ref name=\"BelfastConstruct\"/> Unlike her sister, ''Terror'' was launched with a minimal secondary armament of one {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] gun and two 12 [[Caliber#Pounds as a measure of cannon bore|pdr]], {{cvt|3|in|mm}} guns, which fired projectiles weighing {{convert|12.5|lb|kg|lk=on}}.{{efn-lr|Sources are unclear on the type of 12{{&nbsp}}pdr guns installed on ''Terror'', but two models commonly used by the Royal Navy at the time were the [[QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun|QF 12{{&nbsp}}pdr, 12 cwt]] and [[QF 12-pounder 18 cwt naval gun|QF 12{{&nbsp}}pdr, 18 cwt]] naval guns.}}<ref name=\"Buxtonc8.8para1\">Buxton 2008 c. 8.8, para. 1</ref><ref name=\"Janes1919\"/>\n\n''Terror'' was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 22 July 1916 before conducting [[sea trial]]s, during which the ship was slower than her sister at {{convert|13.1|kn}} compared to {{convert|14.1|kn}} for ''Erebus''. However, under service conditions the maximum speed that could be achieved for both vessels was 13{{&nbsp}}knots with a clean hull or 12{{&nbsp}}knots with a [[Fouling|fouled]] hull. ''Terror'' was recorded as officially completed on 6 August.<ref>Buxton 2008 c. 8.3, para. 3 & c. 8.9</ref>\n\n===Modifications===\nWithin a few months of launch, ''Terror's'' armament was supplemented by two [[QF 6-inch naval gun|QF 6{{&nbsp}}in naval guns]] with a second 3{{&nbsp}}in gun following soon after. Additional guns were fitted while her bow was being repaired from October 1917; two more 6{{&nbsp}}in guns and two [[QF 2-pounder naval gun|2 pdr, {{cvt|1.6|in|mm}} pom-poms]], which fired projectiles weighing {{convert|2|lb|kg}}. In the summer of 1918 the 6{{&nbsp}}in guns were replaced with eight [[BL 4-inch Mk IX naval gun|BL 4{{&nbsp}}in Mk IX naval guns]].<ref name=\"Buxtonc8.8para1\"/><ref name=\"Janes1919\"/> During the early 1920's, the monitor's armaments were modified temporarily while the ship took part in gunnery trials to test new types of shells and armour.<ref name=\"Buxton2008c8.5\">Buxton 2008 c. 8.5, para. 9-10</ref>\n\nThe 12{{&nbsp}}pdr and 2{{&nbsp}}pdr guns were removed during ''Terror's'' 1933 refit while the ship's capacity for oil and ammunition reserves were increased for her journey to [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]]. During ''Terror's'' 1939 refit her eight 4{{&nbsp}}in guns were replaced with six [[QF 4-inch naval gun Mk V|QF 4{{&nbsp}}in Mk V naval guns]] and the 3{{&nbsp}}in anti-aircraft guns were replaced by eight [[Vickers .50 machine gun|Vickers {{convert|0.5|in|mm|abbr=on|1}} machine guns]] in two quadruple mounts. At Malta in 1940 the monitor had a further refit to increase her deck armour.<ref>Buxton 2008 c. 8.8, para. 3</ref>\n\n==Service history==\n\n===First World War===\n\n[[File:HMS Terror 15 inch guns 1915 IWM SP 1612.jpg|thumb|left|The turret and main armament of ''Terror'', 1915]] On completion, ''Terror'' immediately departed Belfast and joined the [[Dover Patrol]] on 8 August.<ref>Prince 2012 p. 36</ref> In August and September she joined with other members of the patrol to bombard minor targets in occupied Belgium. However, the new monitor only fired a small number of shots, as it was felt wiser to conserve her guns for more important targets. On 24 September the ship made an attempt to bombard the port of [[Zeebrugge]] but this was soon aborted when the weather conditions prevented the accurate observation of [[Indirect fire|fall of shot]] and any subsequent correction of trajectory. Poor weather conditions continued for the rest of 1916 and the patrol made no further attempts that year to bombard the Belgian coast. During the winter of 1916 and 1917, ''Terror'' acted as a guard boat for ships anchored at [[The Downs (ship anchorage)|The Downs]], following a spate of attacks by German destroyers.<ref name=\"Buxton8.4\">Buxton 2008 Chapter 8.4</ref>\n\nIn early 1917, ''Terror'' and the rest of the patrol made several aborted attempts to bombard the [[lock gate]]s of the Bruges Canal at Zeebrugge but the operation had to be postponed each time. Reasons for postponement included snapped towlines and poor weather conditions. However, the operation eventually commenced on the evening of 11 May with ''Terror'' acting as flagship for Vice-Admiral [[Reginald Bacon]]. The flotilla anchored off Zeebrugge and began their bombardment at around 05:00 on 12 May, with the monitors {{HMS|Marshal Soult||2}} and ''Terror'' concentrating on the south lock gate and her sister ship ''Erebus'' concentrating on the north gate. Poor visibility and problems with [[Air Observation Post|spotting aircraft]] meant that the fall of shot couldn't be fully observed or their trajectories corrected. The German shore battery began to return fire but ceased after four rounds due to the same poor visibility, enhanced by a British [[smoke screen]]. The British bombardment was called off at 06:00 due to a change in the wind direction clearing their smoke screen and making their ships visible from the shore. The flotilla withdrew to Dover, in the mistaken belief that their bombardment had been successful. Subsequent aerial reconnaissance revealed damage to the surrounding area but the lock gates, the primary targets, were untouched.<ref>Buxton 2008 Chapter 4.3</ref><ref>Dunn, Chapter 14, Section: \"The bombardment of Zeebrugge, 12 May 1917\"</ref>\n\nA bombardment of [[Ostend]] on 5 June by ''Erebus'' and ''Terror'' was more successful, destroying or damaging several vessels and damaging the dockyard.<ref>Dunn 2017 chapter 17, section \"The bombardment of Ostend, 5 June 1957\"</ref>{{efn-lr|Crossley (2013) makes the claim that [[SM UC-70|U-boat UC.70]] was destroyed in the 5 June attack. However, Dunn (2017) observes that UC.70 was not destroyed until 1918 and he can find no corresponding record of a U-boat being destroyed on that day. Buxton (2008) clarifies that the U-boat was sunk in the attack but subsequently refloated and repaired.<ref name=\"Buxton8.4\"/>}} However, the [[Dry dock#Floating|floating dock]]s were not affected until a subsequent bombardment by ''Terror'' on 22 September caused severe damage to both the dockyard and the floating docks.<ref name=\"Crossley2013c5\">Crossley 2013 Chapter 5</ref>\n\nOn 19 October, in an encounter with three [[A-class torpedo boat|German motor torpedo boats]] (''A59'', ''A60'' and ''A61'')<ref name=\"Buxton8.4\"/> off Dunkirk, ''Terror'' was hit by three {{convert|17.7|inch|mm|abbr=on}} torpedoes. Two impacted on the right forward, creating a {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} long hole in the bow, while the other hit the anti-torpedo bulge further aft, which absorbed the damage.<ref name=\"Brown1999p148\"/>{{efn-lr|Brown, D. K. credits the anti-torpedo bulges as being responsible for protecting ''Terror'' from more severe damage to the main hull.<ref>Brown 1999 p. 164</ref> However, Crossly observes that the bulges only protected the ship from the hit further aft and it was the watertight doors that saved the ship by restricting flood water to the forward compartments only.<ref name=\"Crossley2013c5\"/>}} There were no casualties and the ship was beached before being refloated and towed into Dunkirk harbour for temporary repairs. Captain Bruton was advised by a salvage expert to sail the ship stern-first to Portsmouth to reduce pressure on the bow but chose to disregard the advice. The ship sailed first to Dover on 21 October but on the next leg of the journey to Portsmouth two days later, in heavy seas, a major leak developed off [[Hastings]]. The crew evacuated while a tug boat maintained a line to the ship. They were able to reboard ''Terror'' the next day and brought her back into Dover harbour. During the second attempt to reach Portsmouth on 27 October, Bruton again refused to sail the ship backwards but changed his mind after the salvage expert left the ship. She was then towed backwards to Portsmouth, where it took until early January to repair the damage.<ref>Dunn, Chapter 13, Section: \"New monitors\"</ref>  A [[Court-martial|Court of Inquiry]] was called into the 23 October abandonment. Bacon supported Bruton's decision to leave the vessel and the salvage expert was not called to give evidence.

Haynes protested the lack of air support to Cunningham along with the dangers of remaining at anchor, stating that it was only a matter of time before ''Terror'' received a direct hit. Accepting this assessment, Cunningham ordered the ship to sail for Tobruk on the evening tide with ''Fareham'' and ''Salvia''.<ref>Brown 2013 p. 64</ref> As they were exiting the harbour the monitor triggered two magnetic mines in the previously cleared channel; although again not a direct hit, the explosions in close proximity caused further damage and flooding.<ref>Bechthold 2017 p. 129</ref> On the evening of 23 February she was attacked once more by German [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'' dive-bombers from III/[[StG 2]] under the command of [[Helmut Mahlke]].

Completed in 1916, she was assigned to the [[Dover Patrol]] where her primary duties involved bombarding German targets on the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|Belgian coast]], particularly at the ports of [[Zeebrugge]] and [[Ostend]]. In October 1917 ''Terror'' was hit by three torpedoes, taking severe damage to the bow and had to be towed into [[Portsmouth]] for repair. In April 1918 she participated in the [[Zeebrugge raid]] and provided gunnery support for the [[Fifth Battle of Ypres]] in September of the same year.\n\nAfter the war the monitor was attached to [[HMS Excellent (shore establishment)|HMS ''Excellent'']], the Royal Navy's gunnery school in Portsmouth and participated in gunnery trials in the 1920s. In January 1934 ''Terror'' became the base ship at [[Singapore Naval Base|Sembawang Naval Base]] in [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]] where she remained for the rest of the decade. From May 1939 to the end of the year she underwent an extensive refit in Singapore's dockyards.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Second World War and the completion of her refit, ''Terror'' was ordered home to Europe in January 1940. From early March the monitor served in the Mediterranean where she defended [[Siege of Malta (1940)|Malta]] from Italian air raids before supporting the land-based assault of Italian positions in North Africa at the end of the year. In January 1941 the ship assisted with the capture of [[Bardia]] and [[Tobruk]] before she attempted to defend [[Benghazi]] from German air attacks in February. Suffering damage from two air attacks and two mines on 22 and 23 February, ''Terror'' was [[scuttled]] off the coast of [[Italian Libya|Libya]] in the early hours of 24 February. The crew were evacuated to the [[minesweeper]] {{HMS|Fareham|J89|2}} and [[corvette]] {{HMS|Salvia|K97|2}} prior to her sinking.\n\n==Background==\nDuring the First World War, the Royal Navy developed several classes of ships which were designed to give close support to troops ashore through the use of [[Naval Gunfire Support|naval bombardment]].<ref>Crossley 2013 c. 1; Buxton 2008 c. 1</ref> Termed [[Monitor (warship)|monitors]], they owed little to the monitors of the 19th century, though they shared the characteristics of poor seaworthiness, shallow [[Draft (hull)|draught]] and heavy armament in turrets. The size of the various monitor classes of the Royal Navy and their armaments varied greatly. The {{sclass-|Marshal Ney|monitor|4}} was the United Kingdom's first attempt at a monitor carrying {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} guns.<ref>Crossley 2013 c. 2, para. 24</ref> Following construction of the first two of the ''Marshall Ney-class'', another four were ordered in May 1915, with the [[Harland and Wolff]] [[shipyard]] at [[Govan]] receiving a contract to construct two hulls, which were given [[yard number]]s 492 and 493. However, all four were cancelled in June when it was realised that there were insufficient gun turrets to complete both the [[battleship]], {{HMS|Royal Oak|08|2}}, and the monitors before 1917.<ref>Buxton 2008 c. 8.1</ref>\n\nBy August 1915, {{HMS|Marshal Ney||2}}, the first of its class, had revealed a very poor performance in its sea trials. Its engines would not start reliably and were prone to stalling,<ref>Crossley 2013 c. 2, para. 25</ref> making it impossible for the ship to achieve even the minimum standard for the trial of four hours of continuous sailing at full power. The vessel was also difficult to steer.<ref>Buxton 2008 c. 4.2, para. 3</ref> Disappointed by the failure, the [[Admiralty]] began the design of a replacement class on 6 September, which incorporated lessons learned from all of the previous classes of monitor commissioned during the war. Some of the main modifications were an increase in the power supply to guarantee a speed of {{convert|12|kn}} and a change to the angles and lines of the hull to improve steering. Another significant change was to raise the top of the [[anti-torpedo bulge]] above the waterline and reduce its width; both changes would improve the stability and maneuverability of the ship at sea. The bulge was fitted along each side of the ship and was intended to absorb the impact of any explosions. To maintain protection while reducing the bulge's width, its inner compartment was made water tight and filled with 70 steel tubes, rather than leaving the inner compartment open to the sea as in previous designs.<ref name=\"Brown1999p148\">Brown 1999 p. 148</ref><ref name=\"Buxton8.2p2\">Buxton 2008 c. 8.2</ref>\n\n==Design and construction==\nThe new design, which would later be named the ''Erebus''-class, was for a vessel {{convert|405|ft|m|abbr=on|lk=on|1}} long, {{convert|88|ft|2|in|m|abbr=on|1}} [[Beam (nautical)|wide]] with a draught of {{convert|11|ft|8|in|m|abbr=on|1}}. It would have {{convert|8,450|LT|t|lk=on|abbr=on}} [[Displacement (ship)#Loaded displacement|loaded displacement]],<ref name=\"Buxtonc8.3para2\">Buxton 2008 c. 8.3 para. 2</ref>{{efn-lr|Official figures for displacement on completion were not recorded for either vessel of the ''Erebus''-class, leading to historians estimating the true displacement from the completed design and manifest.

Power would be provided by four [[Water-tube boiler#Babcock & Wilcox boiler|Babcock & Wilcox water-tube boilers]], which would generate a combined {{convert|6000|ihp|kW|lk=on|abbr=on}}. The monitors would have an operational range of {{cvt|2480|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of 12{{&nbsp}}knots.<ref name=\"Buxton8.9\"/> \n\nThe ships would be armoured to a similar standard to the {{sclass-|Abercrombie|monitor|4}}, which were launched in April 1915.<ref name=\"Buxton8.9\"/> Deck armour would range from {{convert|1|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} on the [[forecastle]], through {{convert|2|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} on the upper deck and {{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} over the [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]] and [[Belt armor|belt]].<ref name=\"Buxton8.2p4\">Buxton 2008 c. 8.2, para. 4</ref> With the main 15 in guns being originally intended for use on a battleship, the armour for the [[Gun turret|turret]] was substantially thicker than elsewhere in the design; with {{convert|13|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} on the front, {{convert|11|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} on the other sides and {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} on the roof.<ref name=\"Buxton8.2p4\"/><ref name=\"Buxton8.9\"/> The main gun's [[barbette]] would be protected by {{convert|8|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} of armour.<ref name=\"Buxton2.2\">Buxton 2008 c. 2.2, para. 1</ref> The [[conning tower]] was protected by {{convert|6|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} of armour on the sides and {{convert|2.5|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} on the roof.<ref>Buxton 2008 c. 2.11</ref> Each anti-torpedo bulge was {{convert|13|ft|abbr=on|0}} wide with an outer air-filled compartment {{convert|9|ft|abbr=on}} wide and an inner compartment {{convert|4|ft|abbr=on}} wide containing the steel tubes.<ref name=\"Buxton8.2p2\"/>\n\nOrders for two vessels of the new design were placed with Harland and Wolff on 29 September with reinstated yard numbers 492 and 493, which were renamed respectively {{HMS|Erebus|I02|2}} and ''Terror'' on 13 October. ''Terror'' was [[laid down]] at Harland and Wolff's shipyard in Belfast, Northern Ireland on 26 October 1915 and [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 18 May 1916.<ref name=\"BelfastConstruct\">Buxton 2008 c. 8.3</ref>\n\nThe ship's main armament consisted of two [[BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun|BL 15{{&nbsp}}in Mk I naval guns]] in a single forward [[Gun turret|turret]]. ''Terror's'' turret had belonged to ''Marshal Ney'', which had been rearmed with smaller guns following its poor sea trials.<ref>Crossley 2013 c. 2, para. 29</ref>{{efn-lr|There is some confusion in the sources as to the fate of ''Marshall Ney's'' turret. Jane's Fighting Ships (1919) states that it was fitted to ''Erebus''.<ref name=\"Janes1919\">Parkes & Prendergast 1919 p. 90</ref> However Buxton (2008) and Crossley (2013) both agree that ''Ney's'' turret was fitted to ''Terror'' in Belfast while ''Erebus'' received at [[Clydebank]] a gun originally intended as a spare for {{HMS|Furious|47|2}}.}} Learning from the earlier experience with ''Ney'', the turrets were adjusted to increase elevation to 30 degrees, which would add greater firing range.<ref name=\"BelfastConstruct\"/> Unlike her sister, ''Terror'' was launched with a minimal secondary armament of one {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on|0}} [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] gun and two 12 [[Caliber#Pounds as a measure of cannon bore|pdr]], {{cvt|3|in|mm}} guns, which fired projectiles weighing {{convert|12.5|lb|kg|lk=on}}.{{efn-lr|Sources are unclear on the type of 12{{&nbsp}}pdr guns installed on ''Terror'', but two models commonly used by the Royal Navy at the time were the [[QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun|QF 12{{&nbsp}}pdr, 12 cwt]] and [[QF 12-pounder 18 cwt naval gun|QF 12{{&nbsp}}pdr, 18 cwt]] naval guns.}}<ref name=\"Buxtonc8.8para1\">Buxton 2008 c. 8.8, para. 1</ref><ref name=\"Janes1919\"/>\n\n''Terror'' was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 22 July 1916 before conducting [[sea trial]]s, during which the ship was slower than her sister at {{convert|13.1|kn}} compared to {{convert|14.1|kn}} for ''Erebus''. However, under service conditions the maximum speed that could be achieved for both vessels was 13{{&nbsp}}knots with a clean hull or 12{{&nbsp}}knots with a [[Fouling|fouled]] hull. ''Terror'' was recorded as officially completed on 6 August.<ref>Buxton 2008 c. 8.3, para. 3 & c. 8.9</ref>\n\n===Modifications===\nWithin a few months of launch, ''Terror's'' armament was supplemented by two [[QF 6-inch naval gun|QF 6{{&nbsp}}in naval guns]] with a second 3{{&nbsp}}in gun following soon after. Additional guns were fitted while her bow was being repaired from October 1917; two more 6{{&nbsp}}in guns and two [[QF 2-pounder naval gun|2 pdr, {{cvt|1.6|in|mm}} pom-poms]], which fired projectiles weighing {{convert|2|lb|kg}}. In the summer of 1918 the 6{{&nbsp}}in guns were replaced with eight [[BL 4-inch Mk IX naval gun|BL 4{{&nbsp}}in Mk IX naval guns]].<ref name=\"Buxtonc8.8para1\"/><ref name=\"Janes1919\"/> The monitor's armaments were modified temporarily during the early 1920's while the ship took part in gunnery trials to test new types of shells and armour.<ref name=\"Buxton2008c8.5\">Buxton 2008 c. 8.5, para. 9-10</ref>\n\nThe 12{{&nbsp}}pdr and 2{{&nbsp}}pdr guns were removed during ''Terror's'' 1933 refit while the ship's capacity for oil and ammunition reserves were increased for her journey to [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]]. During ''Terror's'' 1939 refit her eight 4{{&nbsp}}in guns were replaced with six [[QF 4-inch naval gun Mk V|QF 4{{&nbsp}}in Mk V naval guns]] and the 3{{&nbsp}}in anti-aircraft guns were replaced by eight [[Vickers .50 machine gun|Vickers {{convert|0.5|in|mm|abbr=on|1}} machine guns]] in two quadruple mounts. At Malta in 1940 the monitor had a further refit to increase her deck armour.<ref>Buxton 2008 c. 8.8, para. 3</ref>\n\n==Service history==\n\n===First World War===\n\n[[File:HMS Terror 15 inch guns 1915 IWM SP 1612.jpg|thumb|left|The turret and main armament of ''Terror'', 1915]] On completion, ''Terror'' immediately departed Belfast and joined the [[Dover Patrol]] on 8 August.<ref>Prince 2012 p. 36</ref> In August and September she joined with other members of the patrol to bombard minor targets in occupied Belgium. However, the new monitor only fired a small number of shots, as it was felt wiser to conserve her guns for more important targets. On 24 September the ship made an attempt to bombard the port of [[Zeebrugge]] but this was soon aborted when the weather conditions prevented the accurate observation of [[Indirect fire|fall of shot]] and any subsequent correction of trajectory. Poor weather conditions continued for the rest of 1916 and the patrol made no further attempts that year to bombard the Belgian coast. During the winter of 1916 and 1917, ''Terror'' acted as a guard boat for ships anchored at [[The Downs (ship anchorage)|The Downs]], following a spate of attacks by German destroyers.<ref name=\"Buxton8.4\">Buxton 2008 Chapter 8.4</ref>\n\nIn early 1917, ''Terror'' and the rest of the patrol made several aborted attempts to bombard the [[lock gate]]s of the Bruges Canal at Zeebrugge but the operation had to be postponed each time. Reasons for postponement included snapped towlines and poor weather conditions. However, the operation eventually commenced on the evening of 11 May with ''Terror'' acting as flagship for Vice-Admiral [[Reginald Bacon]]. The flotilla anchored off Zeebrugge and began their bombardment at around 05:00 on 12 May, with the monitors {{HMS|Marshal Soult||2}} and ''Terror'' concentrating on the south lock gate and her sister ship ''Erebus'' concentrating on the north gate. Poor visibility and problems with [[Air Observation Post|spotting aircraft]] meant that the fall of shot couldn't be fully observed or their trajectories corrected. The German shore battery began to return fire but ceased after four rounds due to the same poor visibility, enhanced by a British [[smoke screen]]. The British bombardment was called off at 06:00 due to a change in the wind direction clearing their smoke screen and making their ships visible from the shore. The flotilla withdrew to Dover, in the mistaken belief that their bombardment had been successful. Subsequent aerial reconnaissance revealed damage to the surrounding area but the lock gates, the primary targets, were untouched.<ref>Buxton 2008 Chapter 4.3</ref><ref>Dunn, Chapter 14, Section: \"The bombardment of Zeebrugge, 12 May 1917\"</ref>\n\nA bombardment of [[Ostend]] on 5 June by ''Erebus'' and ''Terror'' was more successful, destroying or damaging several vessels and damaging the dockyard.<ref>Dunn 2017 chapter 17, section \"The bombardment of Ostend, 5 June 1957\"</ref>{{efn-lr|Crossley (2013) makes the claim that [[SM UC-70|U-boat UC.70]] was destroyed in the 5 June attack. However, Dunn (2017) observes that UC.70 was not destroyed until 1918 and he can find no corresponding record of a U-boat being destroyed on that day. Buxton (2008) clarifies that the U-boat was sunk in the attack but subsequently refloated and repaired.<ref name=\"Buxton8.4\"/>}} However, the [[Dry dock#Floating|floating dock]]s were not affected until a subsequent bombardment by ''Terror'' on 22 September caused severe damage to both the dockyard and the floating docks.<ref name=\"Crossley2013c5\">Crossley 2013 Chapter 5</ref>\n\nOn 19 October, in an encounter with three [[A-class torpedo boat|German motor torpedo boats]] (''A59'', ''A60'' and ''A61'')<ref name=\"Buxton8.4\"/> off Dunkirk, ''Terror'' was hit by three {{convert|17.7|inch|mm|abbr=on}} torpedoes. Two impacted on the right forward, creating a {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} long hole in the bow, while the other hit the anti-torpedo bulge further aft, which absorbed the damage.<ref name=\"Brown1999p148\"/>{{efn-lr|Brown, D. K. credits the anti-torpedo bulges as being responsible for protecting ''Terror'' from more severe damage to the main hull.<ref>Brown 1999 p. 164</ref> However, Crossly observes that the bulges only protected the ship from the hit further aft and it was the watertight doors that saved the ship by restricting flood water to the forward compartments only.<ref name=\"Crossley2013c5\"/>}} There were no casualties and the ship was beached before being refloated and towed into Dunkirk harbour for temporary repairs. Captain Bruton was advised by a salvage expert to sail the ship stern-first to Portsmouth to reduce pressure on the bow but chose to disregard the advice. The ship sailed first to Dover on 21 October but on the next leg of the journey to Portsmouth two days later, in heavy seas, a major leak developed off [[Hastings]]. The crew evacuated while a tug boat maintained a line to the ship. They were able to reboard ''Terror'' the next day and brought her back into Dover harbour. During the second attempt to reach Portsmouth on 27 October, Bruton again refused to sail the ship backwards but changed his mind after the salvage expert left the ship. She was then towed backwards to Portsmouth, where it took until early January to repair the damage.<ref>Dunn, Chapter 13, Section: \"New monitors\"</ref>  A [[Court-martial|Court of Inquiry]] was called into the 23 October abandonment. Bacon supported Bruton's decision to leave the vessel and the salvage expert was not called to give evidence. The inquiry absolved Bruton and his officers of any blame over the incident.<ref name=\"Buxton8.4\"/>\n\n[[File:The Guns.

Haynes protested the lack of air support to Cunningham along with the dangers of remaining at anchor, stating that it was only a matter of time before ''Terror'' received a direct hit. Accepting this assessment, Cunningham ordered the ship to sail for Tobruk on the evening tide with ''Fareham'' and ''Salvia''.<ref>Brown 2013 p. 64</ref> As they were exiting the harbour the monitor triggered two magnetic mines in the previously cleared channel; although again not a direct hit, the explosions in close proximity caused further damage and flooding.<ref>Bechthold 2017 p. 129</ref> On the evening of 23 February she was attacked once more by German [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'' dive-bombers from III/[[StG 2]] under the command of [[Helmut Mahlke]].
