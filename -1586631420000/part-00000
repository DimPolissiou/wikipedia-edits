The company oversees the production, broadcasting and promotion of key Viacom brands outside of the United States. These brands include [[MTV]], [[VH1]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[Comedy Central]], [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]], [[VIVA (TV station)|VIVA]], [[Colors (TV channel)|Colors]] and [[Game One]].\n\nThe networks' headquarters are located in New York City and London. Other international offices are located in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Berlin]], Stockholm, [[Amsterdam]], [[Warsaw]], Madrid, [[Milan]], [[Mumbai]], Paris, Singapore, [[Budapest]] and Sydney amongst others. VIMN's first international offices opened in the late 1980s in London and Amsterdam with the launch of [[MTV Europe]]. VIMN was created from a rebrand of Viacom's MTV Networks, which included [[MTV]], [[VH1]] and [[Nickelodeon]], to include [[Comedy Central]]. [[Robert Bakish]] has been President of VIMN since 2011, having held various roles at Viacom since 1997.\n\n==Viacom International Media Networks divisions==\nViacom International Media Networks is currently split into 6 regional divisions. \n\n===India===\n{{Main|Viacom 18}}Viacom 18 manages the Viacom channels in India.

Since its inception on 1 January 1994, MTV Networks Asia Pacific has been providing localized channels for young audiences across Asia and Australia. Initially established as two MTV channels (MTV Asia and MTV Mandarin), MTV Networks businesses have crossed the continent and every delivery platform by catering to audiences with localized programming in eight different languages across ten MTV channels, eight Nickelodeon channels, four VH1 channels and numerous branded programming blocks across the Asia-Pacific region. The company's localization initiatives were pioneering and its rapid growth in Asia significantly contributed to MTV becoming the world's largest television network.\n\nMTV Networks Asia Pacific comprises 17 websites and 21 channels which are seen via 24-hour and programming blocks in various parts of Asia. Unlike the European and Latin American divisions, which are regulated by the headquarters' country main regulating body, the MTV Networks Asia channels are regulated by the individual country's regulation body.\n\n===Northern Europe===\n'''Viacom International Media Networks Northern Europe''' is a regional division of '''Viacom International Media Networks'''. It operates in the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] speaking part of the [[Benelux]] (Netherlands, [[Flanders]] in Belgium), Germany, Austria, German speaking part of Switzerland, the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden), the [[Baltic states|Baltic]] (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), Poland and Ukraine.\n\nThe Northern Europe division is run by four main offices: [[Amsterdam]], Berlin, [[Stockholm]] and [[Warsaw]]. The sales are still done locally.<ref name=\"broadbandtvnews\">{{cite web|last=Clover |first=Julian |url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2011/09/16/mtv-networks-north-reorganises/ |title=MTV Networks North reorganises |publisher=Broadband TV News |date=2011-09-16 |accessdate=2013-06-28}}</ref>\n\nOn September 16, 2011<ref name=\"broadbandtvnews\"/> it was confirmed by Viacom International Media Networks its operations in the Nordic countries, Benelux region and Germany would operate under Viacom International Media Networks Northern Europe. VIMN Northern Europe operates from its central offices in [[Amsterdam]], Stockholm and [[Berlin]]. Resulting in job losses at its offices at MTV Networks Benelux in Belgium and the Netherlands. The re-alignment will see all music programming come from its operations in Stockholm. Its Swedish offices operate local channels such as MTV and VH1 within VIMN North European's portfoilio of music channels. All kids and family programming operates from [[Berlin]] these include localized versions of [[Nickelodeon]], [[Nick Jr.]] and [[Kindernet]]. Whilst all the localized [[Comedy Central]] channels will be operated from [[Amsterdam]].  VIMN North European's portfolio includes the following territories: Austria, Belgium ([[Flanders]]), Denmark, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland (German speaking part). MTV's Amsterdam offices will remain open and will act as the technical play-out hub for the channels as well.<ref name=\"broadbandtvnews\"/>\n\n===Southern and Western Europe, Middle East and Africa===\nSee also [[Viacom International Media Networks Europe]].\n\n'''Viacom International Media Networks Africa''' (previously MTV Networks Africa) is a subsidiary of [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]].\n\nVIMN Africa includes the multimedia entertainment brands: [[MTV Africa|MTV]], [[MTV Base]], [[VH1 Europe|VH1]], [[VH1 Classic Europe|VH1 Classic]], [[Comedy Central]], [[Nickelodeon (Africa)|Nickelodeon]], [[Nicktoons]], [[Nick Jr.]] and [[BET International|BET]].\n\nSince 2006, MTV Networks Africa offices are located in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa.

The channel would broadcast along with [[MTV Europe]]. A programming block launched on July 1, 1999, here Nickelodeon shows aired on MNET's children's block K-TV. In 2005, K-TV decided to cease broadcasting Nickelodeon produced programming. In 2008, VIMN Africa decided to launch a 24-hour channel across Africa.\n\n* Since MTV's launch in Europe in the late 1980s, [[MTV Europe]] was made available in some territories across Africa primarily South Africa throughout the 1990s. Gradually, as MTV began to localize its brand in Europe, [[MTV France]] and [[MTV Portugal]] were added to the boutique of channels available across the African continent on major cable and digital television platforms.\n* In 2004, MTV Networks International announced it had plans to launch its 100th channel, in Africa with the launch of MTV Africa (proposed branding). In February 2005, MTV Networks International launched [[MTV Base]] Africa. The channel was launched as with a live music special with live performances from local African and international artists.\n* In 2008, MTV Networks Internationals subsidiary MTV Networks Africa launched its first awards show aptly titled [[MTV Africa Music Awards]]. The annual event celebrates the best in music from mainstream and unsigned artists from the African continent. The award show is hosted from a different African city each year similar to its counterpart the [[MTV Europe Music Awards]].\n* As of, July 1, 2009 [[MTV Base]] Africa utilizes the on-air and online branding of MTV's other 64 global channels globally share the same on-air branding. This branding makes the use of a standardised logo, idents and promos (except MTV US, MTV Canada and MTV Brazil). This is part of MTV Networks International's global branding initiative. The on-air branding titled '''Pop X1000''' reflects the changing nature of popular culture with MTV at the heart of these rapid changes. The branding was designed by MTV's design department '''World Design Studio''' in [[Milan]], with additional designs being added by other global departments throughout the year. The branding has been overseen by [[Universal Everything]]. This branding has been adopted by MTV Networks Europe, MTV Networks Asia, MTV Networks Africa and MTV Networks Latin America. As of November 8, 2010 MTV launched is third phase of idents.\nMTV Networks Africa also operates additional channels these include a localized version of [[Nickelodeon (Africa)|Nickelodeon]] and promotes the European versions of [[MTV Live HD]], [[VH1 Europe|VH1]], [[MTV Europe|MTV]], [[MTV Portugal]] and [[MTV France]].\n\n===The Americas===\n'''[[Viacom International Media Networks The Americas]]''' (VIMN The Americas, formerly '''MTV Networks Latin America,''' or MTVNLA) is a subsidiary of [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]]-owned Viacom International Media Networks.
