Khat has been grown for use as a stimulant for centuries in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. There, chewing khat predates the use of coffee and is used in a similar social context. In Uganda it is grown in the central region, especially in Kasenge (Wakiso), Butambala District, Mabira Forest, and in some parts of the western region of the country .<ref name=\"Kciy\"/> In Kenya it is grown in Meru County.\n\nAlthough the practice of khat-chewing is still primarily restricted to its original area of cultivation in the [[Red Sea]] area,<ref name=\"Kciy\"/> the khat plant has over the years found its way to [[Southern Africa]] as well as tropical areas, where it grows on rocky outcrops and in woodlands.

The leaves or the soft part of the stem can be chewed with either chewing gum or fried peanuts to make it easier to chew.

It may also be used by farmers and labourers for reducing physical fatigue or hunger, and by drivers and students for improving attention.\n\nIt takes seven to eight years for the khat plant to reach its full height. Other than access to sun and water, khat requires little maintenance. Ground water is often pumped from deep wells by diesel engines to irrigate the crops, or brought in by water trucks.

In 1975, the related alkaloid [[cathinone]] was isolated, and its [[absolute configuration]] was established in 1978. Cathinone is not very stable and breaks down to produce cathine and [[norephedrine]]. These chemicals belong to the [[phenylpropanolamine|PPA (phenylpropanolamine)]] family, a subset of the [[Substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamines]] related to [[amfetamine|amphetamines]] and the [[catecholamine]]s [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]].<ref name=\"drugs\">{{cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/npp/khat.html |title=Complete Khat Info |author=Drugs.com |date=1 January 2007}}</ref> In fact, cathinone and cathine have a very similar molecular structure to amphetamine.<ref name=\"cox2003\">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1192/apt.9.6.456 |title=Adverse effects of khat: a review |year=2003 |last1=Cox |first1=G. |journal=Advances in Psychiatric Treatment |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=456\u201363}}</ref> Khat is sometimes confused with [[methcathinone]] (also known as ''cat''), a [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Schedules of Controlled Substances|Schedule I]] substance that possesses a similar chemical structure to the khat plant's cathinone active component.

Thus, harvesters transport khat by packaging the fresh leaves and stems in plastic bags or wrapping them in banana leaves to preserve their moisture and keep the cathinone potent. It is also common for them to sprinkle the plant with water frequently or use refrigeration during transportation.\n\nWhen the khat leaves are chewed, cathine and cathinone are released and absorbed through the mucous membranes of the mouth as well as the lining of the stomach. The action of cathine and cathinone on the [[reuptake]] of [[epinephrine]] and norepinephrine has been demonstrated in lab animals, showing that one or both of these chemicals cause(s) the body to recycle these neurotransmitters more slowly, resulting in the wakefulness and insomnia associated with khat use.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ahmed |first1=M.B. |last2=El-Qirbi |first2=A.B. |title=Biochemical effects of Catha edulis, cathine and cathinone on adrenocortical functions |journal=J Ethnopharmacol |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=213\u201316 |date=August 1993 |pmid=7903110 |doi=10.1016/0378-8741(93)90039-8}}</ref>\n\nReceptors for [[serotonin]] show a high affinity for cathinone, suggesting this chemical is responsible for feelings of euphoria associated with chewing khat.

Khat has been grown for use as a stimulant for centuries in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. There, chewing khat predates the use of coffee and is used in a similar social context. In Uganda it is grown in the central region, especially in Kasenge (Wakiso), Butambala District, Mabira Forest, and in some parts of the western region of the country .<ref name=\"Kciy\"/> In Kenya it is grown in Meru County.\n\nAlthough the practice of khat-chewing is still primarily restricted to its original area of cultivation in the [[Red Sea]] area,<ref name=\"Kciy\"/> the khat plant has over the years found its way to [[Southern Africa]] as well as tropical areas, where it grows on rocky outcrops and in woodlands. The shrub is today scattered in the [[KwaZulu-Natal]], [[Eastern Cape]], [[Western Cape]] and [[Mpumalanga]] provinces of [[South Africa]], in addition to [[Swaziland]] and [[Mozambique]].<ref name=\"Pzce\">{{cite web|title=Catha edulis |url=http://www.plantzafrica.com/plantcd/cathedulis.htm |publisher=Plantzafrica |access-date=15 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIts fresh leaves and tops are chewed or, less frequently, dried and consumed as tea, to achieve a state of euphoria and stimulation; it also has [[anorectic]] (appetite-reducing) side effects. The leaves or the soft part of the stem can be chewed with either chewing gum or fried peanuts to make it easier to chew. In recent years, however, improved roads, off-road motor vehicles, and air transportation have increased the global distribution of this perishable commodity, and as a result, the plant has been reported in England, Wales, Rome, [[Amsterdam]], Canada, Israel, Australia, New Zealand,<ref name=\"NZ_Herald_10415187\">{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10415187 |title=Concerns over African methamphetamine-like drug in Hamilton |first=O'Rourke |last=Simon |date=13 December 2006 |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |access-date=12 October 2011}}</ref> and the United States.

It may also be used by farmers and labourers for reducing physical fatigue or hunger, and by drivers and students for improving attention.\n\nIt takes seven to eight years for the khat plant to reach its full height. Other than access to sun and water, khat requires little maintenance. Ground water is often pumped from deep wells by diesel engines to irrigate the crops, or brought in by water trucks. The plants are watered heavily starting around a month before they are harvested to make the leaves and stems soft and moist. A good khat plant can be harvested four times a year, providing a year-long source of income for the farmer.\n\nMore recently, in 2019, reports indicate that child soldiers in Yemen have been chewing khat in order to remain alert on the battlefield.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/yemen-crisis-meet-the-child-soldiers-who-have-forsaken-books-for-kalashnikovs-10187235.html |title = Yemen crisis: Meet the child soldiers who have forsaken books for|date = 19 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/world/middleeast/yemen-saudi-arabia-child-soldiers.html |title = For Yemen Child Soldiers, a Refuge Mixes Play with Saudi Propaganda|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 22 February 2019|last1 = Kirkpatrick|first1 = David D.}}</ref><ref>[https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2018/01/04/the-drug-that-is-starving-yemen.html]</ref>\n\n==Health effects==\n{{more medical citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Rational harm assessment of drugs radar plot.svg|thumb|Addiction experts in psychiatry, chemistry, pharmacology, forensic science, epidemiology, and the police and legal services engaged in [[Delphi method|delphic analysis]] regarding 20 popular recreational drugs.

These chemicals belong to the [[phenylpropanolamine|PPA (phenylpropanolamine)]] family, a subset of the [[Substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamines]] related to [[amfetamine|amphetamines]] and the [[catecholamine]]s [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]].<ref name=\"drugs\">{{cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/npp/khat.html |title=Complete Khat Info |author=Drugs.com |date=1 January 2007}}</ref> In fact, cathinone and cathine have a very similar molecular structure to amphetamine.<ref name=\"cox2003\">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1192/apt.9.6.456 |title=Adverse effects of khat: a review |year=2003 |last1=Cox |first1=G. |journal=Advances in Psychiatric Treatment |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=456\u201363}}</ref> Khat is sometimes confused with [[methcathinone]] (also known as ''cat''), a [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Schedules of Controlled Substances|Schedule I]] substance that possesses a similar chemical structure to the khat plant's cathinone active component.

Thus, harvesters transport khat by packaging the fresh leaves and stems in plastic bags or wrapping them in banana leaves to preserve their moisture and keep the cathinone potent. It is also common for them to sprinkle the plant with water frequently or use refrigeration during transportation.\n\nWhen the khat leaves are chewed, cathine and cathinone are released and absorbed through the mucous membranes of the mouth as well as the lining of the stomach. The action of cathine and cathinone on the [[reuptake]] of [[epinephrine]] and norepinephrine has been demonstrated in lab animals, showing that one or both of these chemicals cause(s) the body to recycle these neurotransmitters more slowly, resulting in the wakefulness and insomnia associated with khat use.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ahmed |first1=M.B. |last2=El-Qirbi |first2=A.B. |title=Biochemical effects of Catha edulis, cathine and cathinone on adrenocortical functions |journal=J Ethnopharmacol |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=213\u201316 |date=August 1993 |pmid=7903110 |doi=10.1016/0378-8741(93)90039-8}}</ref>\n\nReceptors for [[serotonin]] show a high affinity for cathinone, suggesting this chemical is responsible for feelings of euphoria associated with chewing khat.

At the time of discovery, a complete [[cervical vertebrae|cervical]] (neck vertebrae) series for ''Tyrannosaurus'' was not previously known, so it was this specimen that brought the short, stocky tyrannosaur neck to light. Compared to later specimens ([[British Museum of Natural History|BMNH]] R7994 and [[Field Museum of Natural History|FMNH]] PR2081, for instance) the cervical series of AMNH 5027 is much more gracile, so with later discoveries the distinction between tyrannosaurid necks and the necks of [[carnosauria|carnosaurs]] became more obvious.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Kenneth Carpenter]] & [[Philip J.

''Tyrannosaurus'' is now known to have lived approximately 66 million years ago.}}  A herbivorous dinosaur Trachodon venturing from the water for a breakfast of succulent vegetation has been caught and partly devoured by a giant flesh eating Tyrannosaurus. As this monster crouches over the carcass, busy dismembering it, another Tyrannosaurus is attracted to the scene. Approaching, it rises nearly to its full height to grapple the more fortunate hunter and dispute the prey. The crouching figure reluctantly stops eating and accepts the challenge, partly rising to spring on its adversary. The psychological moment of tense inertia before the combat was chosen to best show positions of the limbs and bodies, as well as to picture an incident in the life history of these giant reptiles.<ref name=brown1915 /></blockquote>\n\nHowever, technical difficulties prevented the mount from being executed. One obvious problem was that the Cretaceous Dinosaur Hall was too small to accommodate this dramatic display, and AMNH 5027 was already mounted by itself as the central attraction of the hall. The forearms of ''Tyrannosaurus'' were not well documented and the hands were unknown, so for the sake of the display, the forearms of AMNH 5027 were given three fingers, based on the forelimbs of ''[[Allosaurus]]'' (the more allosaur-like arms were replaced several years later when better fossils of [[tyrannosaurid]] arms were found).\n\nThe mount retained a rearing pose similar to the initial proposal. By the 1980s it was generally accepted that such a pose would have been anatomically impossible in life, and the skeleton was re-mounted in a more accurate, horizontal pose during a renovation of the museum's dinosaur halls in the early 1990s. The mount can still be seen on display on the fourth floor of the American Museum.<!-- Barnum Brown's Field notebook, 1907 and annual reports, 1908.

In 1966, a crew working for the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]] under the direction of Harley Garbani discovered another ''T. rex'' (LACM 23844) which included most of the skull of a very large, mature animal. When it was put on display in Los Angeles, LACM 23844 was the largest ''T. rex'' skull on exhibit anywhere. Garbani also discovered several other partial skeletons over the next decade (including LACM 23845, the holotype of \"Albertosaurus\" ''megagracilis''), some of which are maintained in the collections of the [[University of California Museum of Paleontology]] in [[Berkeley, California]].

This specimen, named \"Sue\" in honor of its discoverer, soon became embroiled in a legal battle over its ownership. The land on which the fossil was discovered was found to lie within the [[Cheyenne River Indian Reservation]] and is occupied by the family of Maurice Williams, a Native American of the [[Sioux]] [[tribe]]. In 1992, Williams claimed he still owned the fossil, for which the Black Hills Institute had paid him US$5,000. The local Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, of which Williams is a member, also claimed ownership. The fossil, as well as many thousands of pages of field notes and business records, were confiscated by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] in 1992 and held throughout the ensuing court proceedings. In 1997, the suit was settled in favor of Maurice Williams because his land is technically held in [[Trust law|trust]] for him by the United States government. Therefore, although the Black Hills Institute had paid Williams for the fossil, it was judged that the fossil could be considered \"land\" which Williams owned but could not legally sell without government permission. The fossil was returned to Williams' ownership and [[Peter Larson|Pete Larson]], vice-president of the Black Hills Institute, was sentenced to two years in federal prison for an unrelated customs violation discovered by the FBI while searching through his business records. Williams quickly offered up \"Sue\" for auction by [[Sotheby's]] in New York, where it was sold to the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in Chicago for US$8.4 million\u2014the highest price ever paid for a fossil.\n\nPreparation of \"Sue\" (FMNH PR2081) was completed at the Field Museum and the skeleton was placed on exhibit on 17 May 2000.<ref name=\"larson00\">[http://www.bhigr.com/pages/info/info_sue.htm \"The Story of a Dinosaur Named Sue\"] by Neal Larson.

Jane's skull is nearly identical to the skull of the original ''Nanotyrannus'' specimen, confirming that they belong to the same species. A conference was held at the Burpee museum in 2005, during which paleontologists debated whether these \"pygmy tyrants\" represented adult specimens of a small species, or juvenile specimens of ''Tyrannosaurus rex''. While there were a few dissenters,<ref name=\"larson2005\">Larson (2005). \"A case for ''Nanotyrannus''.\" In \"The origin, systematics, and paleobiology of Tyrannosauridae\", a symposium hosted jointly by Burpee Museum of Natural History and Northern Illinois University.</ref> a majority of paleontologists at the conference decided on the latter, and that both Jane and ''Nanotyrannus'' were juvenile ''T. rex''.<ref name=\"currieetal2005\">Currie, Henderson, Horner and Williams (2005). \"On tyrannosaur teeth, tooth positions and the taxonomic status of ''Nanotyrannus lancensis''.\" In \"The origin, systematics, and paleobiology of Tyrannosauridae\", a symposium hosted jointly by Burpee Museum of Natural History and Northern Illinois University.</ref><ref name=\"henderson2005\">Henderson (2005). \"Nano No More: The death of the pygmy tyrant.\" In \"The origin, systematics, and paleobiology of Tyrannosauridae\", a symposium hosted jointly by Burpee Museum of Natural History and Northern Illinois University.</ref> However, the Jane material has yet to be properly studied and described by scientists. Although Larson (2013) saw Jane as more identical to CMNH 7541 and LACM 28471 than to adult ''T. rex'' in having a higher tooth count, large pneumatic foramen on the center of the quadratojugal, T-shaped postorbital, and fused shoulder blade and pelvis,<ref>Larson, P.

The bone had been intentionally, though reluctantly, broken for shipping and then not preserved in the normal manner, specifically because Schweitzer was hoping to test it for soft tissue. Designated [[Museum of the Rockies|MOR]] 1125 (and known informally as B-rex), the dinosaur had been excavated from the [[Hell Creek Formation]]. Flexible, bifurcating [[blood vessel]]s and fibrous but elastic bone matrix tissue were recognized. In addition, microstructures resembling [[blood cell]]s were found inside the matrix and vessels. The structures bear resemblance to [[ostrich]] blood cells and vessels. However, since an unknown process distinct from normal fossilization seems to have preserved the material, the researchers are being careful not to claim that it is original material from the dinosaur.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Schweitzer | first1 = M.H. | last2 = Wittmeyer | first2 = J.L. | last3 = Horner | first3 = J.R. | last4 = Toporski | first4 = J.B.  | year = 2005 | title = Soft Tissue Vessels and Cellular Preservation in ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' | url = | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5717| pages = 1952\u20131955 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108397 | pmid=15790853 | bibcode=2005Sci...307.1952S}}</ref> If it is found to be original material, any surviving proteins may be used as a means of indirectly guessing some of the DNA content of the dinosaurs involved, because each protein is typically created by a specific gene. The absence of previous finds may merely be the result of assumptions that soft tissue could not be preserved, so that nobody had looked for it. Since the first, two more tyrannosaurs and a hadrosaur have also been found to have such tissue-like structures.<ref>{{cite web | title=Scientists recover ''T. rex'' soft tissue. | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7285683 | accessdate= 2006-03-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title= Dinosaur Shocker | url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/issues/2006/may/dinosaur.php | author = Fields, H | publisher = Smithsonian Magazine Online | accessdate= 2006-05-01}}</ref>\n\nPaleontologist Thomas Kaye of the University of Washington in Seattle has also hypothesized that the soft-tissue is [[Permineralization|permineralized]] biofilm created by bacteria while digesting and breaking down the original specimen. He has discovered this to be true in many specimens from the same area.<ref>{{cite news | title=  Scientists question dinosaur soft tissue find | url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUKN2933635420080730 | author = Fox, Maggie | publisher = Reuters | accessdate= 2008-07-30 | date=30 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, it was finally confirmed by Mary Higby Schweitzer and Lindsay Zanno ''et al'' that the soft tissue was medullary bone tissue, like that in modern birds when they are readying to lay eggs.

Detrich has been sharing his findings with other researchers, including the Smithsonian Institution.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nScientists are eager to learn more about the years before the carnivore reached its full size of about 40 feet from head to toe. Detrich estimates that Baby Bob was about half that size. \"We hardly know anything about how ''T.rex'' grew up,\" said [[Thomas Carr (paleontologist)|Thomas Carr]], director of the Carthage Institute of Paleontology at Carthage College in Kenosha, Wis. \"We really only have a handful of fossils of sub-adults and juveniles, so any additional fossils that can fill in that early end of the growth period is scientifically very important because most of the skeletons of rex that we have are from adults.\" [[Robert T. Bakker|Bob Bakker]], curator of paleontology at the [[Houston Museum of Natural Science]], said the scarcity of half-grown ''T. rex'' fossils has raised questions. Young ''T. rex'' may have stayed in the nest until they were almost grown, he said. \"If this is a really good genuine baby ''T.rex'', it could tell us whether it was fit to hunt on its own or whether it looks like it was designed to wait for mom and dad to come back,\" Bakker said. Another fossil, first described and named as ''[[Nanotyrannus|Nanotyrannus lancensis]]'' in 1946, also raises questions about whether or not it is a closely related [[Tyrannosauridae|tyrannosaur]] species or a juvenile ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''.\n\nBakker is among those certain there are two species, while Carr is part of another group that believes suspected ''Nanotyrannus''  fossils are actually juvenile ''T. rex'' remains. Another juvenile ''T. rex'' would give scientists something to use for comparison purposes. Baby Bob has been fully excavated, although it will take another year to clean. Detrich said the skull, which is about 75 percent complete, and most of the major skeletal elements were found strewn across a flood plain, although very few vertebra and ribs were found. \"This is so exciting,\" Detrich said. \"I can't even tell you the importance of this dinosaur.\" As a commercial fossil hunter, Detrich eventually plans to sell the fossil. He said most of his fossil finds have found homes in museums.

At the time of discovery, a complete [[cervical vertebrae|cervical]] (neck vertebrae) series for ''Tyrannosaurus'' was not previously known, so it was this specimen that brought the short, stocky tyrannosaur neck to light. Compared to later specimens ([[British Museum of Natural History|BMNH]] R7994 and [[Field Museum of Natural History|FMNH]] PR2081, for instance) the cervical series of AMNH 5027 is much more gracile, so with later discoveries the distinction between tyrannosaurid necks and the necks of [[carnosauria|carnosaurs]] became more obvious.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Kenneth Carpenter]] & [[Philip J.

Christman, the scene was to depict a rearing ''Tyrannosaurus'' (AMNH 5027) snapping at another cowering one (AMNH 973), as they fought over the remains of a [[Hadrosauridae|hadrosaur]], described at the time as ''[[Trachodon]]'':\n[[File:AMNH rex mount.png|thumb|right|Scale model of the never-completed ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' exhibit planned for the American Museum of Natural History by H.F. Osborn; AMNH 973 is the cowering individual, and AMNH 5027 is the other individual]]\n\n<blockquote>It is early morning along the shore of a Cretaceous lake four million years ago.{{refn|group=nb|Radiometric dating had not yet been developed at the time of this quote, so absolute ages of geologic events could only be estimated. ''Tyrannosaurus'' is now known to have lived approximately 66 million years ago.}}  A herbivorous dinosaur Trachodon venturing from the water for a breakfast of succulent vegetation has been caught and partly devoured by a giant flesh eating Tyrannosaurus. As this monster crouches over the carcass, busy dismembering it, another Tyrannosaurus is attracted to the scene. Approaching, it rises nearly to its full height to grapple the more fortunate hunter and dispute the prey. The crouching figure reluctantly stops eating and accepts the challenge, partly rising to spring on its adversary. The psychological moment of tense inertia before the combat was chosen to best show positions of the limbs and bodies, as well as to picture an incident in the life history of these giant reptiles.<ref name=brown1915 /></blockquote>\n\nHowever, technical difficulties prevented the mount from being executed. One obvious problem was that the Cretaceous Dinosaur Hall was too small to accommodate this dramatic display, and AMNH 5027 was already mounted by itself as the central attraction of the hall. The forearms of ''Tyrannosaurus'' were not well documented and the hands were unknown, so for the sake of the display, the forearms of AMNH 5027 were given three fingers, based on the forelimbs of ''[[Allosaurus]]'' (the more allosaur-like arms were replaced several years later when better fossils of [[tyrannosaurid]] arms were found).\n\nThe mount retained a rearing pose similar to the initial proposal. By the 1980s it was generally accepted that such a pose would have been anatomically impossible in life, and the skeleton was re-mounted in a more accurate, horizontal pose during a renovation of the museum's dinosaur halls in the early 1990s. The mount can still be seen on display on the fourth floor of the American Museum.<!-- Barnum Brown's Field notebook, 1907 and annual reports, 1908.

The skull of ''Nanotyrannus'', frequently considered to be a juvenile ''T. rex'', was recovered from Montana in 1942. In 1966, a crew working for the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]] under the direction of Harley Garbani discovered another ''T. rex'' (LACM 23844) which included most of the skull of a very large, mature animal. When it was put on display in Los Angeles, LACM 23844 was the largest ''T. rex'' skull on exhibit anywhere. Garbani also discovered several other partial skeletons over the next decade (including LACM 23845, the holotype of \"Albertosaurus\" ''megagracilis''), some of which are maintained in the collections of the [[University of California Museum of Paleontology]] in [[Berkeley, California]]. Other skulls and partial skeletons were discovered in [[South Dakota]] and [[Alberta]], Canada in the early 1980s.<ref name=\"hornerlessem93\">Horner, J.R. & Lessem, D. 1993.

This specimen, named \"Sue\" in honor of its discoverer, soon became embroiled in a legal battle over its ownership. The land on which the fossil was discovered was found to lie within the [[Cheyenne River Indian Reservation]] and is occupied by the family of Maurice Williams, a Native American of the [[Sioux]] [[tribe]]. In 1992, Williams claimed he still owned the fossil, for which the Black Hills Institute had paid him US$5,000. The local Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, of which Williams is a member, also claimed ownership. The fossil, as well as many thousands of pages of field notes and business records, were confiscated by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] in 1992 and held throughout the ensuing court proceedings. In 1997, the suit was settled in favor of Maurice Williams because his land is technically held in [[Trust law|trust]] for him by the United States government. Therefore, although the Black Hills Institute had paid Williams for the fossil, it was judged that the fossil could be considered \"land\" which Williams owned but could not legally sell without government permission. The fossil was returned to Williams' ownership and [[Peter Larson|Pete Larson]], vice-president of the Black Hills Institute, was sentenced to two years in federal prison for an unrelated customs violation discovered by the FBI while searching through his business records. Williams quickly offered up \"Sue\" for auction by [[Sotheby's]] in New York, where it was sold to the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in Chicago for US$8.4 million\u2014the highest price ever paid for a fossil.\n\nPreparation of \"Sue\" (FMNH PR2081) was completed at the Field Museum and the skeleton was placed on exhibit on 17 May 2000.<ref name=\"larson00\">[http://www.bhigr.com/pages/info/info_sue.htm \"The Story of a Dinosaur Named Sue\"] by Neal Larson.

Jane's skull is nearly identical to the skull of the original ''Nanotyrannus'' specimen, confirming that they belong to the same species. A conference was held at the Burpee museum in 2005, during which paleontologists debated whether these \"pygmy tyrants\" represented adult specimens of a small species, or juvenile specimens of ''Tyrannosaurus rex''. While there were a few dissenters,<ref name=\"larson2005\">Larson (2005). \"A case for ''Nanotyrannus''.\" In \"The origin, systematics, and paleobiology of Tyrannosauridae\", a symposium hosted jointly by Burpee Museum of Natural History and Northern Illinois University.</ref> a majority of paleontologists at the conference decided on the latter, and that both Jane and ''Nanotyrannus'' were juvenile ''T. rex''.<ref name=\"currieetal2005\">Currie, Henderson, Horner and Williams (2005). \"On tyrannosaur teeth, tooth positions and the taxonomic status of ''Nanotyrannus lancensis''.\" In \"The origin, systematics, and paleobiology of Tyrannosauridae\", a symposium hosted jointly by Burpee Museum of Natural History and Northern Illinois University.</ref><ref name=\"henderson2005\">Henderson (2005). \"Nano No More: The death of the pygmy tyrant.\" In \"The origin, systematics, and paleobiology of Tyrannosauridae\", a symposium hosted jointly by Burpee Museum of Natural History and Northern Illinois University.</ref> However, the Jane material has yet to be properly studied and described by scientists. Although Larson (2013) saw Jane as more identical to CMNH 7541 and LACM 28471 than to adult ''T. rex'' in having a higher tooth count, large pneumatic foramen on the center of the quadratojugal, T-shaped postorbital, and fused shoulder blade and pelvis,<ref>Larson, P.

The bone had been intentionally, though reluctantly, broken for shipping and then not preserved in the normal manner, specifically because Schweitzer was hoping to test it for soft tissue. Designated [[Museum of the Rockies|MOR]] 1125 (and known informally as B-rex), the dinosaur had been excavated from the [[Hell Creek Formation]]. Flexible, bifurcating [[blood vessel]]s and fibrous but elastic bone matrix tissue were recognized. In addition, microstructures resembling [[blood cell]]s were found inside the matrix and vessels. The structures bear resemblance to [[ostrich]] blood cells and vessels. However, since an unknown process distinct from normal fossilization seems to have preserved the material, the researchers are being careful not to claim that it is original material from the dinosaur.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Schweitzer | first1 = M.H. | last2 = Wittmeyer | first2 = J.L. | last3 = Horner | first3 = J.R. | last4 = Toporski | first4 = J.B.  | year = 2005 | title = Soft Tissue Vessels and Cellular Preservation in ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' | url = | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5717| pages = 1952\u20131955 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108397 | pmid=15790853 | bibcode=2005Sci...307.1952S}}</ref> If it is found to be original material, any surviving proteins may be used as a means of indirectly guessing some of the DNA content of the dinosaurs involved, because each protein is typically created by a specific gene.

Since the first, two more tyrannosaurs and a hadrosaur have also been found to have such tissue-like structures.<ref>{{cite web | title=Scientists recover ''T. rex'' soft tissue. | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7285683 | accessdate= 2006-03-28 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title= Dinosaur Shocker | url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/issues/2006/may/dinosaur.php | author = Fields, H | publisher = Smithsonian Magazine Online | accessdate= 2006-05-01}}</ref>\n\nPaleontologist Thomas Kaye of the University of Washington in Seattle has also hypothesized that the soft-tissue is [[Permineralization|permineralized]] biofilm created by bacteria while digesting and breaking down the original specimen.

Detrich has been sharing his findings with other researchers, including the Smithsonian Institution.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nScientists are eager to learn more about the years before the carnivore reached its full size of about 40 feet from head to toe. Detrich estimates that Baby Bob was about half that size. \"We hardly know anything about how T. rex grew up,\" said Thomas Carr, director of the Carthage Institute of Paleontology at Carthage College in Kenosha, Wis. \"We really only have a handful of fossils of sub-adults and juveniles, so any additional fossils that can fill in that early end of the growth period is scientifically very important because most of the skeletons of rex that we have are from adults.\" Bob Bakker, curator of paleontology at the Houston Museum of Natural Science, said the scarcity of half-grown T. rex fossils has raised questions. Young ''T. rex'' may have stayed in the nest until they were almost grown, he said. \"If this is a really good genuine baby T. rex, it could tell us whether it was fit to hunt on its own or whether it looks like it was designed to wait for mom and dad to come back,\" Bakker said. Another fossil, first described and named as ''[[Nanotyrannus]]'' in 1946, also raises questions about whether or not it is a closely related ''T. rex'' species or a juvenile ''T. rex''.\n\nBakker is among those certain there are two species, while Carr is part of another group that believes suspected nano fossils are actually juvenile ''T. rex'' remains. Another juvenile ''T. rex'' would give scientists something to use for comparison purposes. Baby Bob has been fully excavated, although it will take another year to clean. Detrich said the skull, which is about 75 percent complete, and most of the major skeletal elements were found strewn across a flood plain, although very few vertebra and ribs were found. \"This is so exciting,\" Detrich said. \"I can't even tell you the importance of this dinosaur.\" As a commercial fossil hunter, Detrich eventually plans to sell the fossil. He said most of his fossil finds have found homes in museums.

The bones were cleaned and assembled in a mount at Black Hills Institute's installations, with the help of both Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History and the Naturalis Leiden Museum. Chicago's Field museum sent digital models of their famous specimen, FMNH PR 2081 (Sue) to complete the cast and Naturalis museum replicated the bones using 3D-printing technology.\n\nThe specimen was named ''Trix'' after former Netherlands' [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix]]. At arrival in the Netherlands, it started touring on public display in an itinerant exhibition titled ''T. rex in Town''. The first exhibit spanned from 10 September 2016 to 5 June 2017 and was set at the only room of the Naturalis museum open to public at the time (the 17th-century building known as ''Pesthuis''), due to the fact that the museum was undergoing restoration. When the Netherlands exhibition ended, it continued travelling through other European countries in 2017, 2018 and 2019. As of August 2019, Trix was returned to display at the Naturalis museum where it is installed in a special room that was under construction during Trix's European tour.<ref name=\"dutchnews.nl\">{{cite web|url=https://www.dutchnews.nl/features/2016/09/trix-the-t-rex-makes-her-mark-on-leiden95266/|title=Trix the T Rex makes her mark on Leiden in new exhibition|author=|date=6 September 2019|website=DutchNews.nl|access-date=6 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Peter Larson, director of Black Hills Institute, Trix is among the most complete ''Tyrannosaurus'' found.

Two different methods were used for this: An [[x-ray]] [[microtomography]], which can be done without damaging the bones, and a small hole drilled in the [[fibula]] to allow comparison with the results of the x-ray-based technique. The growth lines were numerous, and difficult to distinguish. These facts alongside the roughness and [[rugosity]] of the skull are indications that this individual had reached an old age for a ''T. rex''; in this case at least thirty years, as opposed to Sue's 28 years old (Sue was the oldest ''T. rex'' found before Trix's discovery), making Trix the oldest ''Tyrannosaurus'' known along with Scotty.<ref name=\"naturalis.nl\" /><ref name=\"VUB-Today-Trix-Age\" />\n\n==\"Tufts-Love\": UWBM 99000==\n[[File:Tufts love rex.jpg|thumb|Tufts-Love T. rex|left]]In 2016 Greg Wilson, David DeMar, and a paleontology team from the [[Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture]], the [[University of Washington]], and the Dig Field school excavated the partial remains of a ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' from Montana. The partial skeleton was found by two Burke Museum volunteers, Jason Love and Luke Tufts, and was named the \"Tufts-Love\" rex.\n\nPaleontologists at the Burke Museum believe that the Tufts-Love rex was around 15 years old when it died. The skull is of average sized for an adult T. rex. The specimen was found in Late Cretaceous deposits and it is estimated to be 66.3 million years old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burkemuseum.org/blog/burke-museum-team-discovers-t-rex|title=Burke Museum team discovers a T. rex|author=|date=17 August 2016|website=Burke Museum|access-date=23 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Tufts-Love rex is undergoing preparation by Michael Holland and his team at the Burke Museum. The skeleton is estimated to be 30% complete, but it includes a complete (all of the bones of the skull and jaws are preserved) and mostly articulated skull.

After Elsa accidentally injures Anna with her magic, their parents, the King and Queen, take both siblings to a colony of trolls led by Grand Pabbie. He heals Anna, but alters her memories so that she forgets about Elsa's magic. Grand Pabbie warns Elsa that she must learn to control her powers, and that fear will be her greatest enemy. The King and Queen isolate both sisters within the castle, closing the castle gates to their subjects. In an effort to protect her sister from her increasingly unpredictable powers, Elsa ceases all contact with Anna, creating a rift between them. When the sisters are teenagers, their parents are lost at sea during a storm.\n\nFollowing her 21st birthday, Elsa is to be crowned queen of Arendelle. She is afraid that the kingdom's citizens might find out about her powers and fear her. The castle gates open to the public and visiting dignitaries for the first time in years. Among them are the scheming Duke of Weselton and the dashing [[Hans (Frozen)|Prince Hans]] of the Southern Isles, with whom Anna falls in love at first sight. Elsa's [[coronation]] takes place without incident, but she still remains distant from Anna. Anna and Hans develop a romantic connection during the coronation festivities, and he impulsively proposes to her, but Elsa objects when they seek her blessing. Hurt and confused, Anna protests, begging Elsa to explain her fear and isolation. The emotional strain causes Elsa to accidentally unleash her powers before the court. Branded a monster by the Duke, Elsa flees to the North Mountain, where she finally acknowledges her powers, building an ice palace in which to live a hermit life. In the process, her magic unintentionally engulfs Arendelle in an eternal winter.\n\nAnna ventures out to find Elsa and end the winter, leaving Hans in command. She gets lost, collecting supplies at Wandering Oaken's shop. She meets an iceman  named Kristoff  and his [[reindeer]], Sven, convincing them to take her to the mountains. An attack by [[Wolf|wolves]] leads to Kristoff's sleigh being destroyed. On foot, they meet Olaf, a cheerful snowman brought to life unknowingly by Elsa, who offers to lead them to her. When Anna's horse returns to Arendelle without her, Hans sets out to find Anna and Elsa, accompanied by the Duke's minions, who have secret orders to kill Elsa.\n\nReaching the ice palace, Anna meets Elsa. When Anna reveals what has become of Arendelle, a horrified Elsa confesses she does not know how to undo her magic. Her fear causes her powers to manifest themselves once more and she accidentally freezes Anna's heart, seriously injuring her. Elsa then creates a giant snow monster named Marshmallow, who chases Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf away. Realizing the effects of Elsa's spell on Anna, Kristoff takes her to the trolls, his adoptive family. Grand Pabbie reveals that Anna will freeze solid unless \"an act of true love\" reverses the spell.\n\nKristoff races Anna back home so Hans can give her true love's kiss. Hans and his men reach Elsa's palace, defeating Marshmallow and capturing Elsa. Anna is delivered to Hans, but rather than kissing her, Hans instead reveals that he has actually been plotting to seize the throne of Arendelle by eliminating both sisters. Hans locks Anna in a room to die, and then manipulates the dignitaries into believing that Elsa killed her, but not before they were married. He orders the queen's execution, only to discover she has escaped her detention cell.\n\nOlaf frees Anna, and they venture into the [[blizzard]] outside to meet Kristoff, who Olaf has revealed is in love with her. Hans confronts Elsa outside, claiming that she killed Anna, causing Elsa to break down and abruptly stop the storm. Anna spots Hans about to kill Elsa; she leaps in the way and freezes solid, stopping Hans. Devastated, Elsa hugs and mourns over her sister, who thaws out, her heroism constituting \"an act of true love\".\n\nRealizing that love is the key to controlling her magic, Elsa ends the winter and gives Olaf his own snow flurry to survive the warmer climate. Hans is arrested and exiled from the kingdom for his attempted assassination, while the Duke's trade links with Arendelle are cut off. Anna gives Kristoff a new sleigh and the two kiss. The sisters are reunited and Elsa promises never to lock the castle gates again.\n\nIn a post credits scene, Marshmallow finds Elsa's discarded crown. Marshmallow places the crown on top of its head and smiles.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n<!--Do not add voice actors without official sources or they will be removed -->\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2/3|total_width=320\n| image1 = Kristen Bell Frozen premiere 2013 (cropped).jpg|width1=2466|height1=2952\n| image2 = Idina Menzel Defense.gov Crop.png|width2=633|height2=829\n| image3 = Jonathan Groff at Outfest 2013.jpg|width3=2072|height3=2745\n| image4 = 41st Annie Awards, Josh Gad (crop).jpg|width4=3005|height4=4039\n| footer = Top row (L\u2013R): [[Kristen Bell]], [[Idina Menzel]]<br />Bottom row (L\u2013R): [[Jonathan Groff]], [[Josh Gad]]\n}}\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as [[Anna (Frozen)|Anna]], the 18-year-old{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=13}} Princess of Arendelle and Elsa's younger sister<ref name=\"Geeks\">{{cite news |last=Nachman |first=Brett |title=Disney In Depth: The Future Of Disney Animation (Frozen, Paperman, & Wreck-It Ralph)&nbsp;\u2013 A Recap Of D23's Destination D Event |url=http://www.geeksofdoom.com/2012/08/16/disney-in-depth-the-future-of-disney-animation-frozen-paperman-wreck-it-ralph-a-recap-of-d23s-destination-d-event/ |accessdate=August 17, 2012 |newspaper=Geeks of Doom |date=August 16, 2012}}{{Unreliable source?|certain=y|reason=Geeks of doom is a hobby site and the author of the sourced article is a journalism student.

For us the breakthrough came when we tried to give really human qualities to the Snow Queen. When we decided to make the Snow Queen Elsa and our protagonist Anna sisters, that gave a way to relate to the characters in a way that conveyed what each was going through and that would relate for today's audiences. This film has a lot of complicated characters and complicated relationships in it. There are times when Elsa does villainous things but because you understand where it comes from, from this desire to defend herself, you can always relate to her. 'Inspired by' means exactly that. There is snow and there is ice and there is a Queen, but other than that, we depart from it quite a bit. We do try to bring scope and the scale that you would expect but do it in a way that we can understand the characters and relate to them.\"\n|source=\u2013&nbsp;Producer [[Peter Del Vecho]], on the difficulties adapting ''The Snow Queen''<ref name=\"Connelly\">{{cite web |last=Connelly |first=Brendon |title=Inside The Research, Design, And Animation Of Walt Disney's Frozen With Producer Peter Del Vecho |url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/09/25/inside-the-research-design-and-animation-of-walt-disneys-frozen-with-producer-peter-del-vecho/ |work=Bleeding Cool |accessdate=October 22, 2013 |date=September 25, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013234112/http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/09/25/inside-the-research-design-and-animation-of-walt-disneys-frozen-with-producer-peter-del-vecho/ |archivedate=October 13, 2013 |df=}}</ref>\n|width=40%|align=left}}\n\nIn the late 1990s,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Harrison|first1=Mark|title=Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee interview: on making Frozen|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/frozen/28495/chris-buck-and-jennifer-lee-interview-on-making-frozen|date=December 6, 2013|work=Den of Geek!|publisher=Dennis Publishing|accessdate=December 25, 2017}}</ref> Walt Disney Feature Animation started developing a new adaptation of ''The Snow Queen'' after the tremendous success of their recent films during the [[Disney Renaissance]] era (1989\u20131999), but the project was scrapped completely in late 2002, when [[Glen Keane]] reportedly quit the project<ref name=\"sf\">{{cite news |last=Fischer |first=Russ |title=Disney's \"Frozen\", Formerly \"The Snow Queen\", Will Be CG Rather Than Hand-Drawn |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/disneys-frozen-the-snow-queen-cg-handdrawn/ |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |newspaper=Slash Film |date=January 11, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130105043849/http://www.slashfilm.com/disneys-frozen-the-snow-queen-cg-handdrawn/ |archivedate=January 5, 2013 |df=}}</ref> and went on to work on another project which became ''[[Tangled]]'' (2010).

From a design perspective, since I was stressing the horizontal and vertical aspects, and what the fjords provide, it was perfect. We encased the sibling story in scale.\" [[Ted D. McCord|Ted D.

reissued a $250 million box office gross prediction for North America.<ref name=\"NA-opng\" /> ''Box Office Mojo'' noted that it would be \"the exclusive choice for family audiences\" and attributed its successful opening to strong word-of-mouth and the studio's marketing, which highlighted the connection between ''Frozen'' and Disney's previous successful releases like ''Tangled'' and ''Wreck-It Ralph'', as well as the elements of humor.<ref name=\"NA-opng\" />\n\nWhen ''Frozen'' became a box office success, Bilge Ebiri of ''[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]'' analyzed the film's elements and suggested eight factors that might have led to its success. He thought ''Frozen'' managed to capture the spirit of the Disney Renaissance films and early Disney features such as ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' and ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''.<ref name=\"vulture\" /> He also wrote that the film has Olaf, a \"wisecracking, irreverent\" sidekick with mild humor which is \"a requirement of modern animated kids' movies,\" and its \"witty, catchy\" songs were \"pretty good.\"<ref name=\"vulture\" /> Furthermore, Ebiri noted that ''Frozen'' was a \"revisionist\" film that didn't \"have a typical villain\"; Elsa, the person who should be the villain didn't turn out to be a villain, but \"a girl who's having trouble.\" She was the one who \"[created] most of the challenges [for] the film's more typical heroes&nbsp;\u2013 Princess Anna.\"<ref name=\"vulture\" /> The story of two sisters who were separated as they grew up held real-life overtones for many audience members who had siblings, and the struggle of Elsa to overcome the shame and fear of her powers was also relatable.<ref name=\"vulture\" /> Finally, he identified several factors which he believed attracted female audiences: two strong female characters; a twist on the usual romantic subplot, when the traditional \"Prince Charming\"&nbsp;\u2013 Hans&nbsp;\u2013 turned out to be a gold-digging villain; and the \"act of true love\" which saved Anna was her own sacrifice in saving Elsa.<ref name=\"vulture\" />\n\nScott Davis of ''[[Forbes]]'' credited the film's commercial success to its marketing aimed at both sexes, and to the success of its soundtrack.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Davis |first1=Scott |title=What Marketers Should Learn From Disney's 'Frozen' |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottdavis/2014/01/15/what-marketers-should-learn-from-disneys-frozen/ |accessdate=January 15, 2014 |work=[[Forbes]] |date=January 15, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20140623043723/http://www.forbes.com/sites/scottdavis/2014/01/15/what-marketers-should-learn-from-disneys-frozen/ |archivedate=June 23, 2014 |df=}}</ref>\n\nThe commercial success of ''Frozen'' in Japan was considered to be a phenomenon<ref name=\"buckapr8\" /> which received widespread media coverage.

We also have some flawed characters, which is what Jen[nifer Lee] and I like to do&nbsp;\u2013 we essentially create two imperfect princesses.\"<ref name=\"buckapr8\" /> As ''Frozen'' approached the first anniversary of its release, Menzel mentioned the film's continuing popularity in an October 2014 interview: \"It's just a remarkable thing.

After Elsa accidentally injures Anna with her magic, their parents, the King and Queen, take both siblings to a colony of trolls led by Grand Pabbie. He heals Anna, but alters her memories so that she forgets about Elsa's magic. Grand Pabbie warns Elsa that she must learn to control her powers, and that fear will be her greatest enemy. The King and Queen isolate both sisters within the castle, closing the castle gates to their subjects. In an effort to protect her sister from her increasingly unpredictable powers, Elsa ceases all contact with Anna, creating a rift between them. When the sisters are teenagers, their parents are lost at sea during a storm.\n\nFollowing her 21st birthday, Elsa is to be crowned queen of Arendelle. She is afraid that the kingdom's citizens might find out about her powers and fear her. The castle gates open to the public and visiting dignitaries for the first time in years. Among them are the scheming Duke of Weselton and the dashing [[Hans (Frozen)|Prince Hans]] of the Southern Isles, with whom Anna falls in love at first sight. Elsa's [[coronation]] takes place without incident, but she still remains distant from Anna. Anna and Hans develop a romantic connection during the coronation festivities, and he impulsively proposes to her, but Elsa objects when they seek her blessing. Hurt and confused, Anna protests, begging Elsa to explain her fear and isolation. The emotional strain causes Elsa to accidentally unleash her powers before the court. Branded a monster by the Duke, Elsa flees to the North Mountain, where she finally acknowledges her powers, building an ice palace in which to live a hermit life. In the process, her magic unintentionally engulfs Arendelle in an eternal winter.\n\nAnna ventures out to find Elsa and end the winter, leaving Hans in command. She gets lost, collecting supplies at Wandering Oaken's shop. She meets an iceman  named Kristoff  and his [[reindeer]], Sven, convincing them to take her to the mountains. An attack by wolves leads to Kristoff's sleigh being destroyed. On foot, they meet Olaf, a cheerful snowman brought to life unknowingly by Elsa, who offers to lead them to her. When Anna's horse returns to Arendelle without her, Hans sets out to find Anna and Elsa, accompanied by the Duke's minions, who have secret orders to kill Elsa.\n\nReaching the ice palace, Anna meets Elsa. When Anna reveals what has become of Arendelle, a horrified Elsa confesses she does not know how to undo her magic. Her fear causes her powers to manifest themselves once more and she accidentally freezes Anna's heart, seriously injuring her. Elsa then creates a giant snow monster named Marshmallow, who chases Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf away. Realizing the effects of Elsa's spell on Anna, Kristoff takes her to the trolls, his adoptive family. Grand Pabbie reveals that Anna will freeze solid unless \"an act of true love\" reverses the spell.\n\nKristoff races Anna back home so Hans can give her true love's kiss. Hans and his men reach Elsa's palace, defeating Marshmallow and capturing Elsa. Anna is delivered to Hans, but rather than kissing her, Hans instead reveals that he has actually been plotting to seize the throne of Arendelle by eliminating both sisters. Hans locks Anna in a room to die, and then manipulates the dignitaries into believing that Elsa killed her, but not before they were married. He orders the queen's execution, only to discover she has escaped her detention cell.\n\nOlaf frees Anna, and they venture into the [[blizzard]] outside to meet Kristoff, who Olaf has revealed is in love with her. Hans confronts Elsa outside, claiming that she killed Anna, causing Elsa to break down and abruptly stop the storm. Anna spots Hans about to kill Elsa; she leaps in the way and freezes solid, stopping Hans. Devastated, Elsa hugs and mourns over her sister, who thaws out, her heroism constituting \"an act of true love\".\n\nRealizing that love is the key to controlling her magic, Elsa ends the winter and gives Olaf his own snow flurry to survive the warmer climate. Hans is arrested and exiled from the kingdom for his attempted assassination, while the Duke's trade links with Arendelle are cut off. Anna gives Kristoff a new sleigh and the two kiss. The sisters are reunited and Elsa promises never to lock the castle gates again.\n\nIn a post credits scene, Marshmallow finds Elsa's discarded crown.

For us the breakthrough came when we tried to give really human qualities to the Snow Queen. When we decided to make the Snow Queen Elsa and our protagonist Anna sisters, that gave a way to relate to the characters in a way that conveyed what each was going through and that would relate for today's audiences. This film has a lot of complicated characters and complicated relationships in it. There are times when Elsa does villainous things but because you understand where it comes from, from this desire to defend herself, you can always relate to her. 'Inspired by' means exactly that. There is snow and there is ice and there is a Queen, but other than that, we depart from it quite a bit. We do try to bring scope and the scale that you would expect but do it in a way that we can understand the characters and relate to them.\"\n|source=\u2013&nbsp;Producer [[Peter Del Vecho]], on the difficulties adapting ''The Snow Queen''<ref name=\"Connelly\">{{cite web |last=Connelly |first=Brendon |title=Inside The Research, Design, And Animation Of Walt Disney's Frozen With Producer Peter Del Vecho |url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/09/25/inside-the-research-design-and-animation-of-walt-disneys-frozen-with-producer-peter-del-vecho/ |work=Bleeding Cool |accessdate=October 22, 2013 |date=September 25, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013234112/http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/09/25/inside-the-research-design-and-animation-of-walt-disneys-frozen-with-producer-peter-del-vecho/ |archivedate=October 13, 2013 |df=}}</ref>\n|width=40%|align=left}}\n\nIn the late 1990s,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Harrison|first1=Mark|title=Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee interview: on making Frozen|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/frozen/28495/chris-buck-and-jennifer-lee-interview-on-making-frozen|date=December 6, 2013|work=Den of Geek!|publisher=Dennis Publishing|accessdate=December 25, 2017}}</ref> Walt Disney Feature Animation started developing a new adaptation of ''The Snow Queen'' after the tremendous success of their recent films during the [[Disney Renaissance]] era (1989\u20131999), but the project was scrapped completely in late 2002, when [[Glen Keane]] reportedly quit the project<ref name=\"sf\">{{cite news |last=Fischer |first=Russ |title=Disney's \"Frozen\", Formerly \"The Snow Queen\", Will Be CG Rather Than Hand-Drawn |url=http://www.slashfilm.com/disneys-frozen-the-snow-queen-cg-handdrawn/ |accessdate=January 12, 2012 |newspaper=Slash Film |date=January 11, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130105043849/http://www.slashfilm.com/disneys-frozen-the-snow-queen-cg-handdrawn/ |archivedate=January 5, 2013 |df=}}</ref> and went on to work on another project which became ''[[Tangled]]'' (2010).

From a design perspective, since I was stressing the horizontal and vertical aspects, and what the fjords provide, it was perfect. We encased the sibling story in scale.\" [[Ted D. McCord|Ted D.

reissued a $250 million box office gross prediction for North America.<ref name=\"NA-opng\" /> ''Box Office Mojo'' noted that it would be \"the exclusive choice for family audiences\" and attributed its successful opening to strong word-of-mouth and the studio's marketing, which highlighted the connection between ''Frozen'' and Disney's previous successful releases like ''Tangled'' and ''Wreck-It Ralph'', as well as the elements of humor.<ref name=\"NA-opng\" />\n\nWhen ''Frozen'' became a box office success, Bilge Ebiri of ''[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]'' analyzed the film's elements and suggested eight factors that might have led to its success. He thought ''Frozen'' managed to capture the spirit of the Disney Renaissance films and early Disney features such as ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' and ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]''.<ref name=\"vulture\" /> He also wrote that the film has Olaf, a \"wisecracking, irreverent\" sidekick with mild humor which is \"a requirement of modern animated kids' movies,\" and its \"witty, catchy\" songs were \"pretty good.\"<ref name=\"vulture\" /> Furthermore, Ebiri noted that ''Frozen'' was a \"revisionist\" film that didn't \"have a typical villain\"; Elsa, the person who should be the villain didn't turn out to be a villain, but \"a girl who's having trouble.\" She was the one who \"[created] most of the challenges [for] the film's more typical heroes&nbsp;\u2013 Princess Anna.\"<ref name=\"vulture\" /> The story of two sisters who were separated as they grew up held real-life overtones for many audience members who had siblings, and the struggle of Elsa to overcome the shame and fear of her powers was also relatable.<ref name=\"vulture\" /> Finally, he identified several factors which he believed attracted female audiences: two strong female characters; a twist on the usual romantic subplot, when the traditional \"Prince Charming\"&nbsp;\u2013 Hans&nbsp;\u2013 turned out to be a gold-digging villain; and the \"act of true love\" which saved Anna was her own sacrifice in saving Elsa.<ref name=\"vulture\" />\n\nScott Davis of ''[[Forbes]]'' credited the film's commercial success to its marketing aimed at both sexes, and to the success of its soundtrack.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Davis |first1=Scott |title=What Marketers Should Learn From Disney's 'Frozen' |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottdavis/2014/01/15/what-marketers-should-learn-from-disneys-frozen/ |accessdate=January 15, 2014 |work=[[Forbes]] |date=January 15, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20140623043723/http://www.forbes.com/sites/scottdavis/2014/01/15/what-marketers-should-learn-from-disneys-frozen/ |archivedate=June 23, 2014 |df=}}</ref>\n\nThe commercial success of ''Frozen'' in Japan was considered to be a phenomenon<ref name=\"buckapr8\" /> which received widespread media coverage.

We also have some flawed characters, which is what Jen[nifer Lee] and I like to do&nbsp;\u2013 we essentially create two imperfect princesses.\"<ref name=\"buckapr8\" /> As ''Frozen'' approached the first anniversary of its release, Menzel mentioned the film's continuing popularity in an October 2014 interview: \"It's just a remarkable thing.

The plant is part of the [[Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park]] and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. It currently houses the [[National Park Service]] visitor center, several private businesses and the '''Craneway Pavilion''', an event venue.\n\n==Construction==\nBuilt in 1930 during the [[Great Depression]], the assembly plant measures nearly 500,000 square feet (46,450&nbsp;m\u00b2). The factory was a major stimulant to the local and regional economy and was an important development in Richmond's inner harbor and port plan.<ref name=\"nps\"/> Ford became Richmond's third largest employer, behind [[Standard Oil]] and the [[Santa Fe Railroad]]. It is also an outstanding example of 20th-century industrial [[architecture]] designed by architect [[Albert Kahn (architect)|Albert Kahn]], known for his \"daylight factory\" design, which employed extensive window openings that became his trademark. The main building is composed of a two-story section, a single-story section, a [[craneway]], a [[boiler]] house and a shed canopy structure over the railroad track.\n\n==World War II==\nTo ensure that America prepared for total war by mobilizing all the industrial might of the United States, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] banned the production of civilian automobiles during World War II. The Richmond Ford Assembly Plant switched to assembling [[jeep]]s and to putting the finishing touches on [[tank]]s, half-tracked [[armored personnel carrier]]s, armored cars and other military vehicles destined for the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]]. By July 1942, military combat vehicles began flowing into the Richmond Ford plant to get final processing before being transported out the deep-water channel to the war zones. The \"Richmond Tank Depot\" (only one of three [[tank depot]]s in the country<ref name=\"roripdf\">{{cite web | url=http://www.nps.gov/rori/upload/RORI%20Self-Guided%20Auto%20Tour%209-15-06.pdf | title=Self-Guided Auto Tour | work=Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park | publisher=National Park Service | format=PDF | accessdate=2007-04-04}}</ref>) as the Ford plant was then called, helped keep American fighting men supplied with up-to-the-minute improvements in their battle equipment. Approximately 49,000 jeeps were assembled and 91,000 other military vehicles were processed here.<ref name=\"roripdf\"/>\n\nIn mobilizing the wartime production effort to its full potential, Federal military authorities and private industry began to work closely together on a scale never seen before in American history. This laid the groundwork for what became known as the \"[[military-industrial complex]]\" during the [[Cold War]] years.<ref name=\"nps\"/> This Assembly Plant was one cog in the mobilization of the \"[[Arsenal of Democracy]]\" and a historic part of what is today's industrial culture of the United States.\n\n==Post-war==\nAfter the war, the devastation to the local economy as a result of the closing of the [[Richmond Shipyards]] would have been crippling had it not been for the continued production of the Ford Plant. The last Ford was assembled in February 1953, with the plant being closed in 1956 and production transferred to the [[San Jose Assembly Plant]] because of the inability to accommodate increased productivity demands.\n\nThe plant was featured in the movie \"Tucker: The Man and His Dream.\" Principal photography started with first unit shooting on April 13, 1987 in the Ford Motor Company Assembly Plant in Richmond, California.\n\nIn 1989, the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]] severely damaged the plant. After the earthquake, the City of Richmond repaired and prepared the Ford Assembly building for rehabilitation and selected Orton Development as the developer of the rehabilitation project. In 2008, after the building's rehabilitation was completed, tenants including [[SunPower|SunPower Corporation]] and [[Mountain Hardwear]] made the building their new home.

The Richmond Ford Assembly Plant switched to assembling [[jeep]]s and to putting the finishing touches on [[tank]]s, half-tracked [[armored personnel carrier]]s, armored cars and other military vehicles destined for the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]]. By July 1942, military combat vehicles began flowing into the Richmond Ford plant to get final processing before being transported out the deep-water channel to the war zones. The \"Richmond Tank Depot\" (only one of three [[tank depot]]s in the country<ref name=\"roripdf\">{{cite web | url=http://www.nps.gov/rori/upload/RORI%20Self-Guided%20Auto%20Tour%209-15-06.pdf | title=Self-Guided Auto Tour | work=Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park | publisher=National Park Service | format=PDF | accessdate=2007-04-04}}</ref>) as the Ford plant was then called, helped keep American fighting men supplied with up-to-the-minute improvements in their battle equipment. Approximately 49,000 jeeps were assembled and 91,000 other military vehicles were processed here.<ref name=\"roripdf\"/>\n\nIn mobilizing the wartime production effort to its full potential, Federal military authorities and private industry began to work closely together on a scale never seen before in American history. This laid the groundwork for what became known as the \"[[military-industrial complex]]\" during the [[Cold War]] years.<ref name=\"nps\"/> This Assembly Plant was one cog in the mobilization of the \"[[Arsenal of Democracy]]\" and a historic part of what is today's industrial culture of the United States.\n\n==Post-war==\nAfter the war, the devastation to the local economy as a result of the closing of the [[Richmond Shipyards]] would have been crippling had it not been for the continued production of the Ford Plant. The last Ford was assembled in February 1953, with the plant being closed in 1956 and production transferred to the [[San Jose Assembly Plant]] because of the inability to accommodate increased productivity demands.\n\nThe plant was featured in the movie \"Tucker: The Man and His Dream.\" Principal photography started with first unit shooting on April 13, 1987 in the Ford Motor Company Assembly Plant in Richmond, California.\n\nIn 1989, the [[Loma Prieta earthquake]] severely damaged the plant. After the earthquake, the City of Richmond repaired and prepared the Ford Assembly building for rehabilitation and selected Orton Development as the developer of the rehabilitation project. In 2008, after the building's rehabilitation was completed, tenants including [[SunPower|SunPower Corporation]] and [[Mountain Hardwear]] made the building their new home.

The convention entered into force on 17 May 2004 with [[ratification]] by an initial 128 parties and 151 signatories. Co-signatories agree to outlaw nine of the dirty dozen chemicals, limit the use of [[DDT]] to [[malaria]] control, and curtail inadvertent production of dioxins and [[furan]]s.\n\nParties to the convention have agreed to a process by which persistent toxic compounds can be reviewed and added to the convention, if they meet certain criteria for persistence and transboundary threat. The first set of new chemicals to be added to the Convention were agreed at a conference in [[Geneva]] on 8 May 2009.\n\nAs of September 2019, there are 184 parties to the Convention (183 states and the [[European Union]]).<ref name=\"UNTC\" /> Notable non-ratifying states include the United States, Israel, Malaysia, and Italy.\n\nThe Stockholm Convention was adopted to [[European Union|EU]] legislation in Regulation (EC) No 850/2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:158:0007:0049:EN:PDF|title=REGULATION (EC) No 850/2004 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 29 April 2004 on persistent organic pollutants and amending Directive 79/117/EEC|author=|date=|website=europa.eu|accessdate=12 April 2018}}</ref> In 2019, the latter was replaced by Regulation (EU) 2019/1021.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R1021|title=REGULATION (EU) 2019/1021 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 20 June 2019 on persistent organic pollutants (recast)|author=|date=25 June 2019|website=europa.eu|accessdate=27 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Summary of provisions==\nKey elements of the Convention include the requirement that developed countries provide new and additional financial resources and measures to eliminate production and use of intentionally produced POPs, eliminate unintentionally produced POPs where feasible, and manage and dispose of POPs wastes in an environmentally sound manner. Precaution is exercised throughout the Stockholm Convention, with specific references in the preamble, the objective, and the provision on identifying new POPs.\n\n==Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee==\nWhen adopting the Convention, provision was made for a procedure to identify additional POPs and the criteria to be considered in doing so. At the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP1), held in Punta del Este, Uruguay from 2\u20136 May 2005, the POPRC was established to consider additional candidates nominated for listing under the Convention.\n\nThe Committee is composed of 31 experts nominated by parties from the five United Nations regional groups and reviews nominated chemicals in three stages. The Committee first determines whether the substance fulfills POP screening criteria detailed in Annex D of the Convention, relating to its persistence, bioaccumulation, potential for long-range environmental transport (LRET), and toxicity. If a substance is deemed to fulfill these requirements, the Committee then drafts a risk profile according to Annex E to evaluate whether the substance is likely, as a result of its LRET, to lead to significant adverse human health and/or environmental effects and therefore warrants global action. Finally, if the POPRC finds that global action is warranted, it develops a risk management evaluation, according to Annex F, reflecting socioeconomic considerations associated with possible control measures. Based on this, the POPRC decides to recommend that the COP list the substance under one or more of the annexes to the Convention. The POPRC has met annually in Geneva, Switzerland since its establishment. \n\t\nThe seventh meeting of the Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee (POPRC-7) of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) took place from 10\u201314 October 2011 in Geneva, Switzerland. POPRC-8 was held from 15\u201319 October 2012 in Geneva, POPRC-9 to POPRC-15 were held in Rome.\n\n== Listed substances ==\nThere were initially twelve distinct chemicals listed in three categories. Two chemicals, hexachlorobenzene and polychlorinated biphenyls, were listed in both categories A and C.<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Measures to reduce or eliminate POPs\n |author=Secretariat of the Stockholm Convention\n |location=Geneva\n |url=http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/docs/publications/sc_factsheet_001.pdf\n |accessdate=12 June 2009\n}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable toptextcells\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Annex\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Chemical\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[CAS number]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Year of listing decision\n! colspan=\"2\" | Specific exemptions or acceptable purposes\n|-\n!

naphthalene|chlorinated naphthalenes]] (CNs), [[hexachlorobutadiene]] (HCBD) and [[pentachlorophenol]] (PCP), its salts and esters. The proposal is the first stage of the POPRC's work in assessing a substance, and requires the POPRC to assess whether the proposed chemical satisfies the criteria in Annex D of the Convention. The criteria for forwarding a proposed chemical to the risk profile preparation stage are persistence, bioaccumulation, potential for long-range environmental transport (LRET), and adverse effects.\n\nPOPRC-8 proposed [[hexabromocyclododecane]] for listing in Annex A, with specific exemptions for production and use in expanded polystyrene and extruded polystyrene in buildings. This proposal was agreed at the sixth Conference of Parties on 28 April-10 May 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chm.pops.int/Convention/POPsReviewCommittee/LatestMeeting/POPRC8/POPRC8Followup/HBCDRecommendation/tabid/2912/Default.aspx|title=HBCD Recommendation|first=Stockholm|last=Convention|date=|website=chm.pops.int|accessdate=12 April 2018}}</ref><ref>http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/CN/2013/CN.934.2013-Eng.pdf</ref>\n\nPOPRC-9 proposed [[Polychlorinated naphthalene|di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, hepta- and octa-chlorinated napthalenes]], and hexachlorobutadiene for listing in Annexes A and C.

The convention entered into force on 17 May 2004 with [[ratification]] by an initial 128 parties and 151 signatories. Co-signatories agree to outlaw nine of the dirty dozen chemicals, limit the use of [[DDT]] to [[malaria]] control, and curtail inadvertent production of dioxins and [[furan]]s.\n\nParties to the convention have agreed to a process by which persistent toxic compounds can be reviewed and added to the convention, if they meet certain criteria for persistence and transboundary threat. The first set of new chemicals to be added to the Convention were agreed at a conference in [[Geneva]] on 8 May 2009.\n\nAs of September 2019, there are 184 parties to the Convention (183 states and the [[European Union]]).<ref name=\"UNTC\" /> Notable non-ratifying states include the United States, Israel, Malaysia, and Italy.\n\nThe Stockholm Convention was adopted to [[European Union|EU]] legislation in Regulation (EC) No 850/2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:158:0007:0049:EN:PDF|title=REGULATION (EC) No 850/2004 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 29 April 2004 on persistent organic pollutants and amending Directive 79/117/EEC|author=|date=|website=europa.eu|accessdate=12 April 2018}}</ref> In 2019, the latter was replaced by Regulation (EU) 2019/1021.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R1021|title=REGULATION (EU) 2019/1021 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 20 June 2019 on persistent organic pollutants (recast)|author=|date=25 June 2019|website=europa.eu|accessdate=27 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Summary of provisions==\nKey elements of the Convention include the requirement that developed countries provide new and additional financial resources and measures to eliminate production and use of intentionally produced POPs, eliminate unintentionally produced POPs where feasible, and manage and dispose of POPs wastes in an environmentally sound manner. Precaution is exercised throughout the Stockholm Convention, with specific references in the preamble, the objective, and the provision on identifying new POPs.\n\n==Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee==\nWhen adopting the Convention, provision was made for a procedure to identify additional POPs and the criteria to be considered in doing so. At the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP1), held in Punta del Este, Uruguay from 2\u20136 May 2005, the POPRC was established to consider additional candidates nominated for listing under the Convention.\n\nThe Committee is composed of 31 experts nominated by parties from the five United Nations regional groups and reviews nominated chemicals in three stages. The Committee first determines whether the substance fulfills POP screening criteria detailed in Annex D of the Convention, relating to its persistence, bioaccumulation, potential for long-range environmental transport (LRET), and toxicity. If a substance is deemed to fulfill these requirements, the Committee then drafts a risk profile according to Annex E to evaluate whether the substance is likely, as a result of its LRET, to lead to significant adverse human health and/or environmental effects and therefore warrants global action. Finally, if the POPRC finds that global action is warranted, it develops a risk management evaluation, according to Annex F, reflecting socioeconomic considerations associated with possible control measures. Based on this, the POPRC decides to recommend that the COP list the substance under one or more of the annexes to the Convention. The POPRC has met annually in Geneva, Switzerland since its establishment. \n\t\nThe seventh meeting of the Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee (POPRC-7) of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) took place from 10\u201314 October 2011 in Geneva, Switzerland. POPRC-8 was held from 15\u201319 October 2012 in Geneva, POPRC-9 to POPRC-15 were held in Rome.\n\n== Listed substances ==\nThere were initially twelve distinct chemicals listed in three categories. Two chemicals, hexachlorobenzene and polychlorinated biphenyls, were listed in both categories A and C.<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Measures to reduce or eliminate POPs\n |author=Secretariat of the Stockholm Convention\n |location=Geneva\n |url=http://chm.pops.int/Portals/0/docs/publications/sc_factsheet_001.pdf\n |accessdate=12 June 2009\n}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable toptextcells\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Annex\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Chemical\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[CAS number]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Year of listing decision\n! colspan=\"2\" | Specific exemptions or acceptable purposes\n|-\n!

naphthalene|chlorinated naphthalenes]] (CNs), [[hexachlorobutadiene]] (HCBD) and [[pentachlorophenol]] (PCP), its salts and esters. The proposal is the first stage of the POPRC's work in assessing a substance, and requires the POPRC to assess whether the proposed chemical satisfies the criteria in Annex D of the Convention. The criteria for forwarding a proposed chemical to the risk profile preparation stage are persistence, bioaccumulation, potential for long-range environmental transport (LRET), and adverse effects.\n\nPOPRC-8 proposed [[hexabromocyclododecane]] for listing in Annex A, with specific exemptions for production and use in expanded polystyrene and extruded polystyrene in buildings. This proposal was agreed at the sixth Conference of Parties on 28 April-10 May 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chm.pops.int/Convention/POPsReviewCommittee/LatestMeeting/POPRC8/POPRC8Followup/HBCDRecommendation/tabid/2912/Default.aspx|title=HBCD Recommendation|first=Stockholm|last=Convention|date=|website=chm.pops.int|accessdate=12 April 2018}}</ref><ref>http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/CN/2013/CN.934.2013-Eng.pdf</ref>\n\nPOPRC-9 proposed [[Polychlorinated naphthalene|di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa-, hepta- and octa-chlorinated napthalenes]], and hexachlorobutadiene for listing in Annexes A and C.
