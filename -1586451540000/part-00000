Kjellberg's channel was the [[List of most-subscribed YouTube channels|most-subscribed channel on YouTube]] for more than five years from 2013 to 2019.\n\nAfter registering his eponymous YouTube channel in 2010, Kjellberg primarily posted Let's Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel experienced substantial growth in popularity over the next two years and he reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012. Over time, his style of content diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos. \n\nKjellberg became the most-subscribed YouTuber on 15 August 2013 (being briefly surpassed in late 2013 by [[YouTube (channel)|YouTube Spotlight]]) and held the title until early 2019 when he [[PewDiePie vs T-Series|publicly vied for it]] with [[India]]n record label [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], until the latter established a significant lead in April that year.

His channel experienced substantial growth in popularity over the next two years and he reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012. Over time, his style of content diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos. \n\nKjellberg became the most-subscribed YouTuber on 15 August 2013 (being briefly surpassed in late 2013 by [[YouTube (channel)|YouTube Spotlight]]) and held the title until early 2019 when he [[PewDiePie vs T-Series|publicly vied for it]] with [[India]]n record label [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], until the latter established a significant lead in April that year.

He matriculated from a school in Sonpur and attended [[Vidyasagar College]] in Calcutta. He dropped out of college to join the Indian freedom movement.

The Congress Socialist Party, through a series of mergers became a part of the [[Praja Socialist Party]] (PSP). Das served as member of PSP's Bihar Provincial Executive Council. In 1968, he was elected as a Member of Bihar's legislative council and continued in this role until 1977.<ref name=\"Parl\"/> \n\nIn the [[1977 Bihar Legislative Assembly election]], that led to a decisive defeat of the ruling Indian National Congress at the hands of [[Janata party]], Das was elected as the MLA for [[Sonpur (Vidhan Sabha constituency)|Sonpur]]. Janata Party was a recent amalgam of disparate groups including [[Indian National Congress (Organisation)]], [[Charan Singh]]'s [[Bharatiya Lok Dal]] (BLD), Socialists and Hindu Nationalists of Jana Sangh. The sole purpose of these groups joining together was to defeat Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who had imposed a nationwide [[The Emergency (India)|emergency]] and curtailed many freedoms. There were also social cleavages with Socialists and BLD representing backward castes and Congress(O) and Jana Sangh the upper castes. <ref name=\"Parl\"/><ref name=\"sk\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IVxODwAAQBAJ&pg=PT48|title=Post-Mandal Politics in Bihar: Changing Electoral Patterns\n|author=Sanjay Kumar|pp=|year=2018|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn= 9789352805860}}</ref>\n\nInfighting in the party broke over the question of Chief Minister [[Karpoori Thakur]]'s decision to implement the Mungeri Lal Commission report, that recommended the institution of reservations for Backward Castes in government jobs. Upper caste members of Janata Party tried to water down the reservation policy by unseating Karpoori Thakur as Chief Minister. To wean away Dalit MLAs, Das, a Dalit himself, was nominated as the candidate. Karpoori Thakur resigned and Das became the [[Chief Minister of Bihar]] on 21 April 1979. The reservation law was weakened by allowing upper castes to obtain a greater percentage of government jobs.The internal tensions in Janata Party caused it to split into multiple factions which led to Congress to return to power in 1980. <ref name=\"sk\"/>  \n\nIn the late 1980s, some of the remnants of Janata Party had come together to form [[Janata Dal]], which formed a coalition government at the national level following the [[1989 Indian general election]]. In [[1990 Bihar Legislative Assembly election]], Janata Dal won the largest number of seats and sought to form government with the outside support of BJP and Communists. Das was a contender for Chief Ministership pitted against [[Raghunath Jha]] and [[Lalu Prasad Yadav]]. Yadav was supported by [[Devi Lal]] and [[Nitish Kumar]], Jha by [[Chandra Shekhar]] and Das by Prime Minister [[VP Singh]]. Yadav had compaigned heavily in favour of implementing Mandal Commission, which sought to reserve government jobs for backward castes in Central Government jobs. Das was less keen on this. VP Singh's support of Das was interpreted as a lack of enthusiasm for this form of social engineering. Nitish Kumar rallied backward caste MLAs towards Yadav. In the election, Yadav won narrowly over Das by a vote of 59 to 56. Jha won 12, mostly upper caste MLAs.<ref name=\"sk\"/>  \n\nHe was elected to the [[10th Lok Sabha]] from [[Hajipur (Lok Sabha constituency)|Hajipur constituency]] in [[Bihar]] in 1991.

In his political career, he was associated with a number of different parties including [[Praja Socialist Party]], [[Janata Party]], [[Janata Dal]] and [[Janata Dal (United)]]\n\n==Early life and family==\nDas was born on 9 January 1921 in Gangajal near [[Sonpur]], [[Saran District]] in Bihar. He matriculated from a school in Sonpur and attended [[Vidyasagar College]] in Calcutta. He dropped out of college to join the Indian freedom movement.

The Congress Socialist Party, through a series of mergers became a part of the [[Praja Socialist Party]] (PSP). Das served as member of PSP's Bihar Provincial Executive Council. In 1968, he was elected as a Member of Bihar's legislative council and continued in this role until 1977.<ref name=\"Parl\"/> \n\nIn the [[1977 Bihar Legislative Assembly election]], that led to a decisive defeat of the ruling Indian National Congress at the hands of [[Janata party]], Das was elected as the MLA for [[Sonpur (Vidhan Sabha constituency)|Sonpur]]. Janata Party was a recent amalgam of disparate groups including [[Indian National Congress (Organisation)]], [[Charan Singh]]'s [[Bharatiya Lok Dal]] (BLD), Socialists and Hindu Nationalists of Jana Sangh. The sole purpose of these groups joining together was to defeat Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who had imposed a nationwide [[The Emergency (India)|emergency]] and curtailed many freedoms. There were also social cleavages with Socialists and BLD representing backward castes and Congress(O) and Jana Sangh the upper castes. <ref name=\"Parl\"/><ref name=\"sk\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IVxODwAAQBAJ&pg=PT48|title=Post-Mandal Politics in Bihar: Changing Electoral Patterns\n|author=Sanjay Kumar|pp=|year=2018|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn= 9789352805860}}</ref>\n\nInfighting in the party broke over the question of Chief Minister [[Karpoori Thakur]]'s decision to implement the Mungeri Lal Commission report, that recommended the institution of reservations for Backward Castes in government jobs. Upper caste members of Janata Party tried to water down the reservation policy by unseating Karpoori Thakur as Chief Minister. To wean away Dalit MLAs, Das, a Dalit himself, was nominated as the candidate. Karpoori Thakur resigned and Das became the [[Chief Minister of Bihar]] on 21 April 1979. The reservation law was weakened by allowing upper castes to obtain a greater percentage of government jobs.The internal tensions in Janata Party caused it to split into multiple factions which led to Congress to return to power in 1980. <ref name=\"sk\"/>  \n\nIn the late 1980s, some of the remnants of Janata Party had come together to form [[Janata Dal]], which formed a coalition government at the national level following the [[1989 Indian general election]]. In [[1990 Bihar Legislative Assembly election]], Janata Dal won the largest number of seats and sought to form government with the outside support of BJP and Communists. Das was a contender for Chief Ministership pitted against [[Raghunath Jha]] and [[Lalu Prasad Yadav]]. Yadav was supported by [[Devi Lal]] and [[Nitish Kumar]], Jha by [[Chandra Shekhar]] and Das by Prime Minister [[VP Singh]]. Yadav had compaigned heavily in favour of implementing Mandal Commission, which sought to reserve government jobs for backward castes in Central Government jobs. Das was less keen on this. VP Singh's support of Das was interpreted as a lack of enthusiasm for this form of social engineering. Nitish Kumar rallied backward caste MLAs towards Yadav. In the election, Yadav won narrowly over Das by a vote of 86 to 83. Jha won 12, mostly upper caste MLAs.<ref name=\"sk\"/>  \n\nHe was elected to the [[10th Lok Sabha]] from [[Hajipur (Lok Sabha constituency)|Hajipur constituency]] in [[Bihar]] in 1991.

The game was also released in the portable console [[PlayStation Vita]] in 2015. The success of the title prompted Big Blue Bubble to create various spin-off apps including ''My Mammott'' and ''Furcorn's Jelly Dreams'' featuring popular characters from the ''My Singing Monsters'' franchise.\n\nIn September 2015, the company released the second official game of the series, ''My Singing Monsters: Dawn of Fire'' on iOS and Android.<ref name=\"msmdawnoffire-kotaku\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2015/10/they-made-a-sequel-to-my-singing-monsters-tell-my-kids-i-love-them/|title=They Made A Sequel To My Singing Monsters.

Each island possesses a unique set of available monsters that together play a certain musical theme. Monsters that are present on an island will generate various types of in-game currency which can in turn be used to acquire many decorations, remove obstacles, build structures, and buy food for the monsters to level up and generate more currency. There are also achievements and goals to direct gameplay, with in-game currency as rewards.<ref name=\"msminfo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mysingingmonsters.com/about-my-singing-monsters/ |title=About My Singing Monsters |work=MySingingMonsters.com |date=August 15, 2012 |accessdate=September 13, 2012 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312045751/http://www.mysingingmonsters.com/about-my-singing-monsters/|archivedate=March 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe distinction of ''My Singing Monsters'' from other simulation games is the \"building\" process of making music that is primarily driven by the use of the eponymous musical monsters. Players make their own decisions on what determines the \"perfect\" island by selectively picking monsters that they determine would improve their game overall by a combination of design and in-game currency generation. Some special monsters or decorations are more difficult to unlock, often requiring exclusive currencies, special occasions, or special methods in order to obtain or activate them. Monsters can also be bred together in a machine called the \"Breeding Structure\" to breed most types of monsters; monsters of lower rarity are easier to breed and thus easier to become created from the structure.\n\n==''My Singing Monsters: Dawn of Fire''==\n''My Singing Monsters: Dawn of Fire'' is a prequel of the original ''My Singing Monsters'', set in a time when the element of Fire was born. Unlike the original game, the main song is on \"Continent\", a supercontinent land that was formed similarly to [[Pangaea]]. Monsters in toddler form are initially raised on Continent, each of which play a unique tune that contributes to the musical theme. Each monster requests a unique set of \"crafting items\" that can be used to increase their level; filling these requests will reward in-game currency plus additional benefits that can unlock additional features of the game. At a certain monster level, toddler monsters are able to permanently teleport to additional islands known as \"Outer Islands\" as adult monsters, gaining new musical lines on an island with a unique group of musical monsters that produce an entirely different song theme.<ref name=\"mysingingmonstersdawnoffire-bbb\">{{Cite web |title=My Singing Monsters: Dawn of Fire |url=http://Mysingingingmonsters.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151116065534/http://www.mysingingmonsters.com/games/dawn-of-fire |archive-date=2015-11-16 }}</ref>\n\n==Notable collaborations==\nIn July 2013, [[Big Blue Bubble]] announced that they had collaborated with [[Grammy Award]]-winning artist [[Kristian Bush]] from [[United States of America|American]] [[country music]] duo [[Sugarland]] to create a new monster, the Shugabush.<ref name=\"msmkbush\">{{cite web|url=http://kristianbush.com/news/166583|title=Monster Monday: Kristian collaborates with My Singing Monsters to create the Shugabush.|work=KristianBush.com|date=July 29, 2013|accessdate=September 9, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805010340/http://kristianbush.com/news/166583/|archivedate=August 5, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"usa-today-shugabush\">{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2013/07/29/sugarland-kristian-bush-dons-my-singing-monsters-green-suit/2595775/|title=Sugarland's Kristian Bush dons green monster suit|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=26 December 2015}}</ref> Bush had been inspired to collaborate with My Singing Monsters when his 11-year-old son was playing the game.

The first game of the series was released in September 2012 for [[Apple, Inc.|Apple]] [[iOS]].<ref name=\"kotaku-sa\">{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5951778/a-delightfully-melodic-take-on-the-monster-breeding-game|title=A Delightfully Melodic Take on the Monster Breeding Game|work=kotaku.com|date=October 15, 2012|accessdate=October 19, 2015}}</ref> Ports of the game for other touchscreen [[smartphone]] operating systems were later released, including versions for [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] [[Kindle Fire]] tablet, [[Barnes & Noble Nook]]. The game was also released in the portable console [[PlayStation Vita]] in 2015. The success of the title prompted Big Blue Bubble to create various spin-off apps including ''My Mammott'' and ''Furcorn's Jelly Dreams'' featuring popular characters from the ''My Singing Monsters'' franchise.\n\nIn September 2015, the company released the second official game of the series, ''My Singing Monsters: Dawn of Fire'' on iOS and Android.<ref name=\"msmdawnoffire-kotaku\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2015/10/they-made-a-sequel-to-my-singing-monsters-tell-my-kids-i-love-them/|title=They Made A Sequel To My Singing Monsters.

Each island possesses a unique set of available monsters that together play a certain musical theme. Monsters that are present on an island will generate various types of in-game currency which can in turn be used to acquire many decorations, remove obstacles, build structures, and buy food for the monsters to level up and generate more currency. There are also achievements and goals to direct gameplay, with in-game currency as rewards.<ref name=\"msminfo\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mysingingmonsters.com/about-my-singing-monsters/ |title=About My Singing Monsters |work=MySingingMonsters.com |date=August 15, 2012 |accessdate=September 13, 2012 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312045751/http://www.mysingingmonsters.com/about-my-singing-monsters/|archivedate=March 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe distinction of ''My Singing Monsters'' from other simulation games is the \"building\" process of making music that is primarily driven by the use of the eponymous musical monsters. Players make their own decisions on what determines the \"perfect\" island by selectively picking monsters that they determine would improve their game overall by a combination of design and in-game currency generation. Some special monsters or decorations are more difficult to unlock, often requiring exclusive currencies, special occasions, or special methods in order to obtain or activate them. Monsters can also be bred together in a machine called the \"Breeding Structure\" to breed most types of monsters; monsters of lower rarity are easier to breed and thus easier to become created from the structure.\n\n==''My Singing Monsters: Dawn of Fire''==\n''My Singing Monsters: Dawn of Fire'' is a prequel of the original ''My Singing Monsters'', set in a time when the element of Fire was born. Unlike the original game, the main song is on \"Continent\", a supercontinent land that was formed similarly to [[Pangaea]]. Monsters in toddler form are initially raised on Continent, each of which play a unique tune that contributes to the musical theme. Each monster requests a unique set of \"crafting items\" that can be used to increase their level; filling these requests will reward in-game currency plus additional benefits that can unlock additional features of the game.
