Far too long.--> \nThe story portrays the lives of two orphan girls, Isha and Ira who do not give up despite facing many hardships in life. Their mother died, their father abandoned them, and they are left to fend for themselves. Their father has to give them up because he is marrying someone else. They are sent to live in an orphanage with Devki and her brother Bhola.\n\nAt first the kids don't like them because they escaped and they had to starve. But Isha comes back because Ira was sick and she sprained her leg. Devki is trying to separate Isha and Ira by telling Ira bad stuff about Isha. Also Isha finds out that Tinnu (a boy whom also escaped the orphanage and they helped him but got caught by Bhola) is in the dark room and he had to starve because he helped Isha escape. Meanwhile, Vrinda (the person in charge of everyone) hates Isha because she caused a lot of trouble for them. But one day when a guy named Arjun comes to deliver food, he meets Vrinda. They become friends and Arjun writes Vrinda letters. They both fall in love. Bhola finds out and warns Vrinda. To get revenge Vrinda mixes spices in Bhola's breakfast. Bhola tells Devki and threatens Isha to tell the truth. Devki says that she will accept any condition if she says who did it. Isha takes the blame and tells Devki to release Tinnu. Tinnu is really very sick. Thakur and Fatima likes Isha now but Vrinda and Cutting are still upset. Thakur, Fatima, and Isha try to take care of Tinnu but their efforts are in vain. Isha collects money and the kids help her. Vrinda comes and wants to help and prove she's better than Isha, so they tell Vrinda to try to convince Devki to get a doctor. The doctor comes and cures Tinnu.\n\nJust as relation was going to be fixed as Isha gives rice with milk to Vrinda. Devki comes in and degrades Vrinda while teasing her by announcing Isha is the new manager for the kids, causing Vrinda to hate her more. Arjun becomes a famous businessman that wants to adopt Vrinda. He talks to Vrinda alone and they both confess their love to each other. Bhola finds out that that man was Arjun and tells Devki. Isha warns Vrinda about it and Arjun leaves, she covers up the ordeal. Devki tells her men to check all of Vrinda's belongings. A letter that Arjun gave to Vrinda falls out and Bhola sees this. While Devki is trying to get it Isha took it and ate it. When she goes to beat Isha, Ira bites her arm. Devki tries to hit Ira bit Isha stops her. Isha tells her that while she is here she will change everything. Devki is embarrassed and leaves. Vrinda apologizes to Isha for being mean to her and they both are friends now.\n\nOutside Tinnu sees Bhola and Devki talking to a foreigner. After the foreigner leaves, Devki tells the kids that she is sorry and tells them that they could do whatever they want to. Tinnu suspects her and tells Isha and Vrinda about this. Isha follows Devki and Bhola and finds out that the foreigner is the owner of the biggest adoption center in America. He wants two little cute girls so he can take them to America and someone could adopt them. Devki wants to sell Ira and Chutki to the foreigner. Isha is shocked and tells Arjun, Vrinda and Tinnu. When Devki is giving Ira and Chutki to the foreigner, Chetna comes. Devki kicks the foreigner out immediately. Every one were confused. They think that Chetna will buy one of the kids but Isha finds out that Chetna is the real owner of the place. She is really nice to all the children, gives them new clothes, good food, and new toys. On the day of Isha's birthday, Chetna organises a party for her. But Isha, Tinnu, Vrinda and all the kids plan to get Devki and Bhola kicked out from the orphanage. Isha calls some people to buy a child. Chetna sees this and Devki blames it on Bhola, who is then kicked out.\n\nThey all celebrate Isha's birthday and everyone is happy. Later one day, Isha goes to buy groceries with Calender. She sees a boy asking everyone about an orphanage and thinks he is a pickpocket. When he comes to her, they both drop their papers. Isha's paper had the groceries list and items, and his has the address to the orphanage. They accidentally pick up the wrong paper and he follows her there. He comes to the orphanage and everyone finds out his name: Samarth or Sam. He came from America and is Chetna's grandson. He tells everyone to hide him from Chetna for two days so Chetna doesn't send him back. Chetna gets a phone call from his mom saying he was supposed to go to summer camp but he's not there. Chetna is really worried and Devki thinks it's a good opportunity to send Chetna back but Isha tells her the truth. Sam is mad at Isha for telling Chetna the truth. Sam convinces Chetna to go to America with him and she agrees. Everyone is upset while Devki is happy. Meanwhile, Tinnu and Sam constantly fight a lot and argue. They both hate each other. Chetna borrows a baby from one of the guards and tells everyone on the street that until she is not adopted she won't go anywhere. The kids are all happy. Chetna tells Isha; she did it all this so Sam could become a responsible person. She assigns Isha, Tinnu and Sam to take care of the baby. Sam and Tinnu try to get along but they still fight. Sam is changing. Chetna is proud of Isha. Devki in a fit of greed for money teams up with Sam's mother to burn the orphanage. This causes all of the kids to be separated from each other, even Isha and Ira.\n\n===Ten years later===\nIsha tries to find Ira with the help of Devki. Isha works at a radio station as DJ Palak and has to go by the name Palak. Her only aim in joining the radio station is to find her sister, Ira. She hopes and prays Ira will listen to her and recognize her.\n\nIra grows up to be a rich and a spoiled brat. However, there is a humane side to her too. She grows up hating Isha because she believes Isha chose Kuhu over her.\n\nAngry about her past, Ira erases all memories of her childhood and even assumes a new identity. She changes her name to Kajal Kaushal. However, destiny brings Isha and Ira together once again. Unaware of their shared past, the duo meet and become best friends, as Ira invites DJ Palak (Isha) to her 18th birthday party and Isha finds it awkward that Kajal and Ira's birthday is on the same day. Everyone is happy until police come and arrest everyone at the party because there was something wrong. Palak doesn't get arrested because she was from the radio station and she helps Kajal by saying that she works there to.\n\nFate brings Samarth Ojha and Isha together too when he joins Isha's radio station as a trainee. Samarth Ojha (Sam) has come from abroad and joins the radio as a trainee. But Isha and the whole office discover that Sam is actually the owner of the radio station, he joins as a trainee because he learns that there was a lot of mess and fraud in the radio station.\n\nIsha and Ira are reunited, but Ira still hates Isha. Revati (Samarth's mom) absolutely loathes Isha and fills Ira's heart with hate towards her sister. Isha and Sam are to be married and Ira and Revati conjure many plans to stop the wedding. Isha finds out that Ira still loves Sam and hates her. Isha lets Ira marry Sam, but instead she gets married to Shravan (One of Palak's fans and is in love with Isha) who tied Sam up. Shravan and Ira don't get on, and they make each other miserable. Revathi pushes Isha off the balcony and thinks Isha is dead. Later on IRA and Shravan fall in love, Ira also realises her mistakes and apologises to Isha. Isha is haunting Revathi, and Isha is revealed to be alive, with the help of the family Revathi is exposed and arrested. A young boy comes to the House which is later revealed to be the sisters younger half brother Govinda. Revathi escapes jail and kidnaps Govinda, but his family saves him. Revathi is arrested again. Isha and Ira are reunited with their father. Govinda draws a picture which he names Chhoti si Zindagi. The sisters have their happy ending.\n\n==Other telecasts==\nIt came back on 3 January 2012 on Disney Channel India.

Isha collects money and the kids help her. Vrinda comes and wants to help and prove she's better than Isha, so they tell Vrinda to try to convince Devki to get a doctor. The doctor comes and cures Tinnu.\n\nJust as relation was going to be fixed as Isha gives rice with milk to Vrinda. Devki comes in and degrades Vrinda while teasing her by announcing Isha is the new manager for the kids, causing Vrinda to hate her more. Arjun becomes a famous businessman that wants to adopt Vrinda. He talks to Vrinda alone and they both confess their love to each other. Bhola finds out that that man was Arjun and tells Devki. Isha warns Vrinda about it and Arjun leaves, she covers up the ordeal. Devki tells her men to check all of Vrinda's belongings. A letter that Arjun gave to Vrinda falls out and Bhola sees this. While Devki is trying to get it Isha took it and ate it. When she goes to beat Isha, Ira bites her arm. Devki tries to hit Ira bit Isha stops her. Isha tells her that while she is here she will change everything. Devki is embarrassed and leaves. Vrinda apologizes to Isha for being mean to her and they both are friends now.\n\nOutside Tinnu sees Bhola and Devki talking to a foreigner. After the foreigner leaves, Devki tells the kids that she is sorry and tells them that they could do whatever they want to. Tinnu suspects her and tells Isha and Vrinda about this. Isha follows Devki and Bhola and finds out that the foreigner is the owner of the biggest adoption center in America. He wants two little cute girls so he can take them to America and someone could adopt them. Devki wants to sell Ira and Chutki to the foreigner. Isha is shocked and tells Arjun, Vrinda and Tinnu. When Devki is giving Ira and Chutki to the foreigner, Chetna comes. Devki kicks the foreigner out immediately. Every one were confused. They think that Chetna will buy one of the kids but Isha finds out that Chetna is the real owner of the place. She is really nice to all the children, gives them new clothes, good food, and new toys. On the day of Isha's birthday, Chetna organises a party for her. But Isha, Tinnu, Vrinda and all the kids plan to get Devki and Bhola kicked out from the orphanage. Isha calls some people to buy a child. Chetna sees this and Devki blames it on Bhola, who is then kicked out.\n\nThey all celebrate Isha's birthday and everyone is happy. Later one day, Isha goes to buy groceries with Calender. She sees a boy asking everyone about an orphanage and thinks he is a pickpocket. When he comes to her, they both drop their papers. Isha's paper had the groceries list and items, and his has the address to the orphanage. They accidentally pick up the wrong paper and he follows her there. He comes to the orphanage and everyone finds out his name: Samarth or Sam. He came from America and is Chetna's grandson. He tells everyone to hide him from Chetna for 2 days so Chetna doesn't send him back. Chetna gets a phone call from his mom saying he was supposed to go to summer camp but he's not there. Chetna is really worried and Devki thinks it's a good opportunity to send Chetna back but Isha tells her the truth. Sam is mad at Isha for telling Chetna the truth. Sam convinces Chetna to go to America with him and she agrees. Everyone is upset while Devki is happy. Meanwhile, Tinnu and Sam constantly fight a lot and argue. They both hate each other. Chetna borrows a baby from one of the guards and tells everyone on the street that until she is not adopted she won't go anywhere. The kids are all happy. Chetna tells Isha; she did it all this so Sam could become a responsible person. She assigns Isha, Tinnu and Sam to take care of the baby. Sam and Tinnu try to get along but they still fight. Sam is changing. Chetna is proud of Isha. Devki in a fit of greed for money teams up with Sam's mother to burn the orphanage. This causes all of the kids to be separated from each other, even Isha and Ira.\n\n===10 years later===\nIsha tries to find Ira with the help of Devki. Isha works at a radio station as DJ Palak and has to go by the name Palak. Her only aim in joining the radio station is to find her sister, Ira. She hopes and prays Ira will listen to her and recognize her.\n\nIra grows up to be a rich and a spoiled brat. However, there is a humane side to her too. She grows up hating Isha because she believes Isha chose Kuhu over her.\n\nAngry about her past, Ira erases all memories of her childhood and even assumes a new identity. She changes her name to Kajal Kaushal. However, destiny brings Isha and Ira together once again. Unaware of their shared past, the duo meet and become best friends, as Ira invites DJ Palak (Isha) to her 18th birthday party and Isha finds it awkward that Kajal and Ira's birthday is on the same day. Everyone is happy until police come and arrest everyone at the party because there was something wrong. Palak doesn't get arrested because she was from the radio station and she helps Kajal by saying that she works there to.\n\nFate brings Samarth Ojha and Isha together too when he joins Isha's radio station as a trainee. Samarth Ojha (Sam) has come from abroad and joins the radio as a trainee. But Isha and the whole office discover that Sam is actually the owner of the radio station, he joins as a trainee because he learns that there was a lot of mess and fraud in the radio station.\n\nIsha and Ira are reunited, but Ira still hates Isha. Revati (Samarth's mom) absolutely loathes Isha and fills Ira's heart with hate towards her sister. Isha and Sam are to be married and Ira and Revati conjure many plans to stop the wedding. Isha finds out that Ira still loves Sam and hates her. Isha lets Ira get married to Sam, but instead she gets married to Shravan (One of Palak's fans and is in love with Isha) who tied Sam up. Shravan and Ira don't get on, and they make each other miserable. Revathi pushes Isha off the balcony and thinks Isha is dead. Later on IRA and Shravan fall in love, Ira also realises her mistakes and apologises to Isha. Isha is haunting Revathi, and Isha is revealed to be alive, with the help of the family Revathi is exposed and arrested. A young boy comes to the House which is later revealed to be the sisters younger half brother Govinda. Revathi escapes jail and kidnaps Govinda, but his family saves him. Revathi is arrested again. Isha and Ira are reunited with their father. Govinda draws a picture which he names Chhoti si Zindagi. The sisters have their happy ending.\n\n==Other telecasts==\nIt came back on 3 January 2012 on Disney Channel India.

It also provides a graphical user interface for simplifying the compilation and execution stage.\n\nThe Processing language and IDE were the precursor to other projects including [[Arduino]], [[Wiring (development platform)|Wiring]] and P5.js.\n\n==History==\nThe project was initiated in 2001 by [[Casey Reas]] and [[Ben Fry]], both formerly of the Aesthetics and Computation Group at the [[MIT Media Lab]]. In 2012, they started the Processing Foundation along with [[Daniel Shiffman]], who joined as a third project lead.

There are several variants and related projects:\n\n===Design By Numbers===\nProcessing was based on the original work done on [[Design By Numbers]] project at MIT. It shares many of the same ideas and is a direct child of that experiment.\n\n===Processing.js===\n{{Main|Processing.js}}\nIn 2008, [[John Resig]] ported Processing to [[JavaScript]] using the [[Canvas element]] for rendering,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ejohn.org/blog/processingjs/|title=John Resig - Processing.js<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref> allowing Processing to be used in modern web browsers without the need for a Java plugin. Since then, the open source community including students at [[Seneca College]] in Toronto have taken over the project.\n\nProcessing.js is also used to advocate very basic programming to Students of all ages on [[Khan Academy]] by creating drawings and animations. Learners showcase their creations to other learners.\n\n===P5js===\nIn 2013, [[Lauren McCarthy]] created P5.js (also referred to as p5.js), a native [[JavaScript]] alternative to Processing.js that has the official support of the Processing Foundation. McCarthy also teaches an introductory course to p5.js on [[Kadenze]].<ref>[https://www.kadenze.com/courses/introduction-to-programming-for-the-visual-arts-with-p5-js/info Introduction to Programming for the Visual Arts with p5.js on Kadenze]</ref>\n\n===Processing.py===\nPython Mode for Processing, or Processing.py is a Python interface to the underlying Java toolkit.

It also provides a graphical user interface for simplifying the compilation and execution stage.\n\nThe Processing language and IDE were the precursor to other projects including [[Arduino]], [[Wiring (development platform)|Wiring]] and [[P5.js]].\n\n==History==\nThe project was initiated in 2001 by [[Casey Reas]] and [[Ben Fry]], both formerly of the Aesthetics and Computation Group at the [[MIT Media Lab]]. In 2012, they started the Processing Foundation along with [[Daniel Shiffman]], who joined as a third project lead. [[Johanna Hedva]] joined the Foundation in 2014 as Director of Advocacy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://processingfoundation.org/people|title=People|website=processingfoundation.org|access-date=2017-04-24}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, Processing had the URL at proce55ing.net, because the ''processing'' domain was taken. Eventually Reas and Fry acquired the domain processing.org.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://processing.org/discourse/alpha/board_Collaboration_action_display_num_1074297082.html|title=Processing 1.0 _ALPHA_ - processing.org|website=processing.org}}</ref> Although the name had a combination of letters and numbers, it was still pronounced ''processing''. They do not prefer the environment being referred to as ''Proce55ing''. Despite the domain name change, Processing still uses the term ''p5'' sometimes as a shortened name (''p5'' specifically is used, not ''p55''), for example p5.js is a reference to that.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/2443|title=What means number 5 in name \"p5\"? \u00b7 Issue #2443 \u00b7 processing/p5.js|website=GitHub}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\n{{Infobox software\n| name = Processing IDE\n| logo = [[File:Processing 3 logo.png|80px|Processing logo]]\n| logo caption = \n| screenshot = ProcessingIDE english.png\n| screenshot size = 250px\n| caption = Screenshot of Processing's integrated development environment.\n| collapsible = \n| author = \n| developer = \n| released = <!-- {{Start date|YYYY|MM|DD|df=yes/no}} -->\n| discontinued = \n| latest release version = 3.4.0\n| latest release date = {{Start date and age|2018|07|26}}\n| latest preview version = \n| latest preview date = \n| status = \n| programming language = [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[GLSL]], [[JavaScript]]\n| operating system = [[Cross-platform]]\n| platform = \n| size = \n| language = \n| genre = [[Integrated development environment]]\n| license = \n| website = {{URL|//processing.org}}\n| frequently updated = <!-- DO NOT include this parameter unless you know what it does -->\n}}\nProcessing includes a ''sketchbook'', a minimal alternative to an [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) for organizing projects.<ref name=\"Greenberg2007\">{{cite book|author=Ira Greenberg|title=Processing: Creative Coding and Computational Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TKgfVpWPb0sC&pg=PA151|date=31 December 2007|publisher=Apress|isbn=978-1-4302-0310-0|pages=151\u2013}}</ref>\n\nEvery Processing sketch is actually a subclass of the <code>PApplet</code> [[Java class]] (formerly a subclass of Java's built-in Applet) which implements most of the Processing language's features.<ref name=\"Meyer2018\">{{cite book|author=Jeanine Meyer|title=Programming 101: The How and Why of Programming Revealed Using the Processing Programming Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yypgDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA121|date=15 June 2018|publisher=Apress|isbn=978-1-4842-3697-0|pages=121\u2013}}</ref>\n\nWhen programming in Processing, all additional classes defined will be treated as [[inner class]]es when the code is translated into pure Java before compiling.<ref name=\"Greenberg2010\">{{cite book|author=Ira Greenberg|title=The Essential Guide to Processing for Flash Developers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7pVhzd6h20IC&pg=PA412|date=25 March 2010|publisher=Apress|isbn=978-1-4302-1980-4|pages=412\u2013}}</ref> This means that the use of [[static variable]]s and [[Static methods|methods]] in classes is prohibited unless Processing is explicitly told to code in pure Java mode.\n\nProcessing also allows for users to create their own classes within the PApplet sketch. This allows for complex [[data types]] that can include any number of arguments and avoids the limitations of solely using standard data types such as: [[Integer (computer science)|int]] (integer), [[Character (computing)|char]] (character), [[Floating point|float]] (real number), and color (RGB, [[RGBA color space|RGBA]], hex).\n\n==Examples==\nThe simplest possible version of a \"Hello World\" program in Processing is:\n\n<source lang=\"arduino\">\n//This prints \"Hello World.\" to the IDE console.\nprintln(\"Hello World.\");\n</source>\n\nHowever, due to the more visually-oriented nature of Processing, the following code is a better example of the look and feel of the language.\n\n<source lang=\"arduino\">\n//Hello mouse.\nvoid setup() {\n  size(400, 400);\n  stroke(255);\n  background(192, 64, 0);\n}\n\nvoid draw() {\n  line(150, 25, mouseX, mouseY);\n}\n</source>\n\n==Awards==\nIn 2005 Reas and Fry won the Golden Nica award from [[Ars Electronica]] in its Net Vision category for their work on Processing.<ref name=\"Hoy2017\">{{cite book|author=Meredith Hoy|title=From Point to Pixel: A Genealogy of Digital Aesthetics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r0NwDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA142|date=3 January 2017|publisher=Dartmouth College Press|isbn=978-1-5126-0023-0|pages=142\u2013}}</ref>\n\nBen Fry won the 2011 National Design Award given by the [[Smithsonian Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum]] in the category of Interaction Design. The award statement says:\n\n<blockquote>\"Drawing on a background in graphic design and computer science, Ben Fry pursues a long-held fascination with visualizing data. As Principal of Fathom Information Design in Boston, Fry develops software, printed works, installations, and books that depict and explain topics from the human genome to baseball salaries to the evolution of text documents. With Casey Reas, he founded the Processing Project, an open-source programming environment for teaching computational design and sketching interactive-media software. It provides artists and designers with accessible means of working with code while encouraging engineers and computer scientists to think about design concepts.\"<ref>http://cdn.cooperhewitt.org/2011/05/26/Final%20-%20CHNDM%20NDA%202011%20Winner%20Release%205-26-11.pdf</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==License==\nProcessing's core libraries, the code included in exported applications and applets, is licensed under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]], allowing users to release their original code with a choice of license.\n\nThe IDE is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]].\n\n==Related projects==\n\nProcessing is not a single language, but rather, an arts-oriented approach to learning, teaching, and making things with code. There are several variants and related projects:\n\n===Design By Numbers===\nProcessing was based on the original work done on [[Design By Numbers]] project at MIT. It shares many of the same ideas and is a direct child of that experiment.\n\n===Processing.js===\n{{Main|Processing.js}}\nIn 2008, [[John Resig]] ported Processing to [[JavaScript]] using the [[Canvas element]] for rendering,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ejohn.org/blog/processingjs/|title=John Resig - Processing.js<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref> allowing Processing to be used in modern web browsers without the need for a Java plugin. Since then, the open source community including students at [[Seneca College]] in Toronto have taken over the project.\n\nProcessing.js is also used to advocate very basic programming to Students of all ages on [[Khan Academy]] by creating drawings and animations. Learners showcase their creations to other learners.\n\n===P5js===\nIn 2013, [[Lauren McCarthy]] created P5.js (also referred to as p5.js), a native [[JavaScript]] alternative to Processing.js that has the official support of the Processing Foundation. McCarthy also teaches an introductory course to p5.js on [[Kadenze]].<ref>[https://www.kadenze.com/courses/introduction-to-programming-for-the-visual-arts-with-p5-js/info Introduction to Programming for the Visual Arts with p5.js on Kadenze]</ref>\n\n===Processing.py===\nPython Mode for Processing, or Processing.py is a Python interface to the underlying Java toolkit. It was chiefly developed by Jonathan Feinberg starting in 2010, with contributions from James Gilles and Ben Alkov.<ref name=\"ParrishFry2016\">{{cite book|author1=Allison Parrish|author2=Ben Fry|author3=Casey Reas|title=Getting Started with Processing.py: Making Interactive Graphics with Processing's Python Mode|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ddYlDAAAQBAJ|date=11 May 2016|publisher=Maker Media, Incorporated|isbn=978-1-4571-8679-0}}</ref>\n\n===Wiring, Arduino, and Fritzing===\nProcessing has spawned another project, [[Wiring (development platform)|Wiring]], which uses the Processing IDE with a collection of libraries written in the [[C++]] language as a way to teach artists how to program [[microcontroller]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://circuitcellar.com/ee-tips/processing-wiring-and-arduino-ee-tip-101/|title=Processing, Wiring, and Arduino (EE Tip 101) - Circuit Cellar|date=18 September 2013|publisher=}}</ref> There are now two separate hardware projects, Wiring and [[Arduino]], using the Wiring environment and language.\n[[Fritzing]] is another software environment of the same sort, which helps designers and artists to document their interactive prototypes and to take the step from physical prototyping to actual product.\n\n===Mobile Processing===\nAnother spin-off project, now defunct, is Mobile Processing by Francis Li, which allowed software written using the Processing language and environment to run on Java powered mobile devices. Today some of the same functionality is provided by Processing itself.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Android - Processing\n| accessdate = 2013-06-03\n| url = http://wiki.processing.org/w/Android\n}}</ref>\n\n===iProcessing===\niProcessing was built to help people develop native [[iPhone]] applications using the Processing language. It is an integration of the Processing.js library and a Javascript application framework for iPhone.<ref>{{cite

Music|date=11 February 2010|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Spde===\nSpde (Scala Processing Development Environment) replaces Processing's reduced Java syntax and custom preprocessor with the off-the-shelf [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] programming language which also runs on the [[Java platform]] and enforces some of the same restrictions such as disallowing static methods, while also allowing more concise code, and supporting [[functional programming]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://technically.us/spde/About|title=Spde: Spde|publisher=Technically.us|accessdate=2013-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite

''ruby-processing'')  is a [[wrapper library|wrapper]] for Processing in the [[Ruby (language)|Ruby]] language, that runs on the Java platform using JRuby.\n\n===Quil===\nQuil is an interactive animation library for [[Clojure]] and ClojureScript based on Processing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.quil.info/|title=Quil: animation in Clojure}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |

Originally a modified version of the Firestreak, Red Top emerged as a much more capable weapon, with roughly double the range, a more sensitive seeker giving limited all-aspect capability, and an even larger warhead than the already-large one in Firestreak. Although much more powerful than Firestreak, both missiles remained in service until 1988 when the last of the [[English Electric Lightning]]s retired.\n\n==Development==\n===Improved Blue Jay===\nEven before the original [[de Havilland Firestreak|Firestreak]] entered service, improvements were being studied to increase its performance. Still known by its [[rainbow code]] \"Blue Jay\", Blue Jay Mk. II introduced an improved seeker and more powerful motor, while Mk. III derated the motor to limit acceleration when launched at high speed in order to avoid overheating due to aerodynamic heating. Neither project was proceeded with.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=35}}\n\n===Blue Vesta===\nLooking for a further improved weapon for the [[Operational Requirement F.155]] interceptors, in 1955 the Air Ministry issued OR.1131 for an all-aspect design capability against enemy aircraft traveling at Mach 2. De Havilland responded with Blue Jay Mk. IV, which was later given its own rainbow code, '''Blue Vesta'''.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}\n\nBlue Vesta adopted the PbTe seeker of Mk. II, further improved by cooling it to improve its sensitivity in what became known as the \"Violet Banner\" seeker. The motor was further upgraded to the new Magpie III. To handle the aerodynamic heating issues, the fins were made of steel rather than aluminum, and featured cut-away sections to keep the rear portions of the surfaces out of the Mach cones, a feature they referred to as \"mach tips\".{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}{{efn|More widely known today as a cropped delta.}}\n\nWork on Blue Vesta was curtailed after 1956 as the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) concluded that the rapid closing speeds of two Mach 2+ aircraft would be so quick that the missile would have no chance to be launched while it was still within the range of its seeker. They suggested moving to the much larger [[radar]]-guided [[Red Hebe]], although some low-level work on Blue Vesta's underlying technologies continued.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}\n\n===Red Top===\nF.155 was canceled in the aftermath of the release of the [[1957 Defence White Paper]]. It was decided to proceed with the development of the Lightning largely because it was already close to being complete. Blue Vesta was reactivated in July 1957 to arm this aircraft. For security reasons, yet another rainbow code was assigned in November 1957 and it became Red Top.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nIn contrast to Blue Vesta, Red Top was a simpler design, more of a rationalised, upgraded version of the earlier Firestreak. Lower launch speeds allowed the steel wings and fins to be replaced, and these were enlarged to provide more maneuvering power. The fuselage was straightened, removing the boat-tail design of the Firestreak and allowing the new \"Linnet\" rocket motor to more completely fill the increased volume. Other oddities of the Firestreak, like the fin actuators being in the nose and requiring pushrods running the length of the fuselage were removed, giving it a much more logical layout and further increasing internal volume.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nThe all-aspect [[lead telluride]] (PbTe) seeker developed for Blue Vesta was replaced by a much less expensive [[indium antimonide]] (InSb) system known as \"Violet Banner\". This seeker lacked the sensitivity of the PbTe model and did not offer true all-aspect capability, but it offset this loss to some degree through a greatly increased the [[field of view]] to 60&nbsp;degrees. Firestreak's tube-powered electronics were replaced by [[transistor]]ized versions, which greatly improved reliability and eliminated the need for continual cooling. The new \"Green Garland\" IR [[proximity fuse]] required only one row of \"windows\", further simplifying the layout.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nThese changes allowed the warhead to be moved to the forward fuselage from its former rear-mounted location. This allowed it to be enlarged to 31&nbsp;kg (68.3&nbsp;lb) from Firestreak's already prodigious 22.7&nbsp;kg (50&nbsp;lb) and added an [[expanding-rod warhead]] in place of the earlier blast fragmentation type.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nThe Red Top was faster<ref name=Boyne267/> and had greater range and maneuvrability than the Firestreak, and its [[infrared seeker]] enabled a wider range of engagement angles.

He felt that Firestreak would be acceptable during the short period before the [[Bristol Bloodhound|Bloodhound Mk.

The [[Air Staff]] argued this point, ultimately convincing him that Red Top's head-on attack profile against new Soviet supersonic bombers known to be in development was an urgent requirement.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nAt a February 1958 meeting of the Controller of Guided Weapons and Electronics, the group earmarked Red Top for both Lightning and the [[Fleet Air Arm]]'s [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]]. It was expected that Red Top would offer a dramatic leap in performance for Sea Vixen, as its enlarged motor significantly improved its performance when launched subsonically, the relative improvement is less when launched from Lightning. There was also some discussion of mounting four Red Top on [[Blackburn Buccaneer]], likely the B.112 version that had been developed for long-duration [[combat air patrol]].{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nIndependently, in 1959 Jon Fozard of [[Hawker Aircraft]] also considered using Red Top on the [[Hawker Siddeley P.1127]], assuming it to have a larger engine, a pair of Red Top, and the [[AIRPASS]] radar from the Lightning.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n===Into service===\n[[File:Red Top.jpg|right|thumb|Red Top on display at the [[Royal Air Force Museum Cosford|RAF Museum Cosford]].]]\n[[File:Hawker Siddeley Red Top missile.jpg|thumb|Hawker Siddeley Red Top missile mounted on an [[English Electric Lightning]] at the [[RAF Museum]] at [[Hendon]], [[London]]. ]]\n\nRed Top testing began using the new fuselage layout with the original Firestreak faceted nosecone and leftover Magpie III motors from the Blue Jay Mk. II program. Ten such lash-ups had been fired by June 1959. Guidance tests with the new motor and seeker were carried out from an [[English Electric Canberra]] beginning in early 1960 and firing from the Lightning in September 1961.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\nThe Red Top entered service in [[1964 in aviation|1964]], arming the [[English Electric Lightning]] and [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]].

This was because Red Top's larger wing area required the Lightning to have a larger fin to maintain stability, leaving Firestreak on the other models that were already in service.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n===Further upgrades===\nWhile development of Red Top was being carried out, another adaptation of the original Firestreak was being considered to produce a [[semi-active radar homing]] version that would allow a single airframe to be converted from IR to radar by changing the nose section. Initially known as Blue Jay Mk. V, this became \"Blue Dolphin\", but this was cancelled in 1958{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nA longer-ranged Red Top Mk. 2 was also proposed, replacing the Linnet rocket with a [[liquid fuel rocket]] running on MADI/RFNA, likely the de Havilland Spartan.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n== Former operators ==\n[[File:Red Top operators.png|thumb|Map with Red Top operators in blue]]\n; {{KUW}}\n* [[Kuwait Air Force]]\n; {{SAU}}\n* [[Royal Saudi Air Force]]\n; {{UK}}\n* [[Royal Air Force]]\n* [[Royal Navy]], [[Fleet Air Arm]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rainbow Codes]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{Cite book\n  | last1 = Gibson| first1 = Chris\n  | first2 = Tony| last2 = Buttler\n  | title = British Secret Projects: Hypersonics, Ramjets and Missiles\n  | publisher = Midland Publishing\n  | year= 2007\n  | pages = 47\u201353\n  | isbn = 978-1-85780-258-0 \n  |ref=harv\n}}\n\n{{UKmissiles}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Red Top (Missile)}}\n[[Category:Cold War air-to-air missiles of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Air-to-air missiles of the United Kingdom]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox weapon\n|is_missile=yes\n| image= Red Top missile.png\n| image_size = 250\n|caption= Red Top missile\n|name=Red Top\n|type=[[Air-to-air missile]]\n|origin=United Kingdom\n|era=Cold War\n|platform=aircraft\n|target=aircraft\n|manufacturer=Hawker Siddeley Dynamics\n|design_date=\n|production_date=\n|service=1964 - 1988\n|used_by= United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait\n|wars=\n|spec_type= homing missile\n|diameter= 0.23 m\n|wingspan=0.91 m\n|length=3.32 m\n|weight= 154 kg\n|speed=Mach 3.2\n|vehicle_range=7.5 miles (12 km)\n|ceiling=\n|filling=31 kg (68.3 lb) [[annular blast fragmentation]]\n|engine=''Linnet'' solid fuel motor\n|steering=control surfaces\n|guidance=[[infrared homing]], limited [[all-aspect]]\n|variants=?\n|number=\n|detonation=''Green Garland'' infrared proximity; secondary contact [[fuze]]\n}}\n\nThe '''[[Hawker Siddeley]]''' (later [[British Aerospace]]) '''Red Top''' was the third indigenous British [[air-to-air missile]] to enter service, following the [[de Havilland Firestreak]] and limited-service [[Fireflash]].

Guidance tests with the new motor and seeker were carried out from an [[English Electric Canberra]] beginning in early 1960 and firing from the Lightning in September 1961.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\nThe Red Top entered service in [[1964 in aviation|1964]], arming the [[English Electric Lightning]] and [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]].

This was because Red Top's larger wing area required the Lightning to have a larger fin to maintain stability, leaving Firestreak on the other models that were already in service.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n===Further upgrades===\nWhile development of Red Top was being carried out, another adaptation of the original Firestreak was being considered to produce a [[semi-active radar homing]] version that would allow a single airframe to be converted from IR to radar by changing the nose section. Initially known as Blue Jay Mk. V, this became \"Blue Dolphin\", but this was cancelled in 1958{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nA longer-ranged Red Top Mk. 2 was also proposed, replacing the Linnet rocket with a [[liquid fuel rocket]] running on MADI/RFNA, likely the de Havilland Spartan.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n== Former operators ==\n[[File:Red Top operators.png|thumb|Map with Red Top operators in blue]]\n; {{KUW}}\n* [[Kuwait Air Force]]\n; {{SAU}}\n* [[Royal Saudi Air Force]]\n; {{UK}}\n* [[Royal Air Force]]\n* [[Royal Navy]], [[Fleet Air Arm]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rainbow Codes]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{Cite book\n  | last1 = Gibson| first1 = Chris\n  | first2 = Tony| last2 = Buttler\n  | title = British Secret Projects: Hypersonics, Ramjets and Missiles\n  | publisher = Midland Publishing\n  | year= 2007\n  | pages = 47\u201353\n  | isbn = 978-1-85780-258-0 \n  |ref=harv\n}}\n\n{{UKmissiles}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Red Top (Missile)}}\n[[Category:Cold War air-to-air missiles of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Air-to-air missiles of the United Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "Maury Markowitz", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAlmost cancelled", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Top_(missile)"}

He became widely popular in his lifetime and remained so after his premature death at the age of 39 in New York City. By then he had acquired a reputation, which he had encouraged, as a \"roistghjhas,m hfiocgsjbiufgvbuwefiufvjakering, drunken and doomed poet\".<ref name=\"WAEoW\">{{cite book |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Davies|editor1-link=John Davies (historian)|editor2-first=Nigel |editor2-last=Jenkins | editor2-link=Nigel Jenkins| editor3-first=Baines |editor3-last=Menna|editor4-first=Peredur I. |editor4-last=Lynch|title=The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales |year=2008 |publisher=University of Wales Press |location=Cardiff |pages=861\u2013862|isbn=978-0-7083-1953-6}}</ref>\n\nThomas was born in [[Swansea]], [[Wales]], in 1914. An undistinguished pupil, he left school at 16 and became a journalist for a short time. Many of his works appeared in print while he was still a teenager, and the publication in 1934 of \"Light breaks where no sun shines\" caught the attention of the literary world. While living in London, Thomas met [[Caitlin Thomas|Caitlin Macnamara]], whom he married in 1937. In 1938, they moved to the Welsh fishing village of [[Laugharne]] where from 1949 they settled permanently and brought up their three children.\n\nThomas came to be appreciated as a popular poet during his lifetime, though he found earning a living as a writer difficult. He began augmenting his income with reading tours and radio broadcasts. His radio recordings for the [[BBC]] during the late 1940s brought him to the public's attention, and he was frequently used by the BBC as an accessible voice of the literary scene.\n\nThomas first travelled to the United States in the 1950s. His readings there brought him a degree of fame, while his erratic behaviour and drinking worsened. His time in America cemented his legend, however, and he went on to record to [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] such works as ''A Child's Christmas in Wales''. During his fourth trip to New York in 1953, Thomas became gravely ill and fell into a coma, from which he never recovered. He died on 9 November 1953. His body was returned to Wales, where he was interred at the churchyard of St Martin's in Laugharne on 25 November 1953.\n\nAlthough Thomas wrote exclusively in the English language, he has been acknowledged as one of the most important Welsh poets of the 20th century. He is noted for his original, rhythmic and ingenious use of words and imagery. His position as one of the great modern poets has been much discussed, and he remains popular with the public.\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Early life===\n[[File:Dylan thomas birthplace.jpg|thumb|upright|left|5 Cwmdonkin Drive, [[Swansea]], birthplace of Dylan Thomas|alt=On a hill street stands a two storied semi-detached house with bay windows to the front and a sloped tiled roof with a chimney.]]\n\nDylan Thomas was born on 27 October 1914 in [[Swansea]], the son of Florence Hannah (''n\u00e9e'' Williams; 1882\u20131958), a [[seamstress]], and David John Thomas (1876\u20131952), a teacher.

His images were carefully ordered in a patterned sequence, and his major theme was the unity of all life, the continuing process of life and death and new life that linked the generations. Thomas saw biology as a magical transformation producing unity out of diversity, and in his poetry sought a poetic ritual to celebrate this unity. He saw men and women locked in cycles of growth, love, [[procreation]], new growth, death, and new life. Therefore, each image engenders its opposite. Thomas derived his closely woven, sometimes self-contradictory images from the Bible, [[Welsh mythology|Welsh folklore]], preaching, and [[Sigmund Freud]].<ref>{{cite book|editor1-first=M.

He became widely popular in his lifetime and remained so after his premature death at the age of 39 in New York City. By then he had acquired a reputation, which he had encouraged, as a \"roistering, drunken and doomed poet\".<ref name=\"WAEoW\">{{cite book |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Davies|editor1-link=John Davies (historian)|editor2-first=Nigel |editor2-last=Jenkins | editor2-link=Nigel Jenkins| editor3-first=Baines |editor3-last=Menna|editor4-first=Peredur I. |editor4-last=Lynch|title=The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales |year=2008 |publisher=University of Wales Press |location=Cardiff |pages=861\u2013862|isbn=978-0-7083-1953-6}}</ref>\n\nThomas was born in [[Swansea]], [[Wales]], in 1914. An undistinguished pupil, he left school at 16 and became a journalist for a short time. Many of his works appeared in print while he was still a teenager, and the publication in 1934 of \"Light breaks where no sun shines\" caught the attention of the literary world. While living in London, Thomas met [[Caitlin Thomas|Caitlin Macnamara]], whom he married in 1937. In 1938, they moved to the Welsh fishing village of [[Laugharne]] where from 1949 they settled permanently and brought up their three children.\n\nThomas came to be appreciated as a popular poet during his lifetime, though he found earning a living as a writer difficult. He began augmenting his income with reading tours and radio broadcasts. His radio recordings for the [[BBC]] during the late 1940s brought him to the public's attention, and he was frequently used by the BBC as an accessible voice of the literary scene.\n\nThomas first travelled to the United States in the 1950s. His readings there brought him a degree of fame, while his erratic behaviour and drinking worsened. His time in America cemented his legend, however, and he went on to record to [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] such works as ''A Child's Christmas in Wales''. During his fourth trip to New York in 1953, Thomas became gravely ill and fell into a coma, from which he never recovered. He died on 9 November 1953. His body was returned to Wales, where he was interred at the churchyard of St Martin's in Laugharne on 25 November 1953.\n\nAlthough Thomas wrote exclusively in the English language, he has been acknowledged as one of the most important Welsh poets of the 20th century. He is noted for his original, rhythmic and ingenious use of words and imagery. His position as one of the great modern poets has been much discussed, and he remains popular with the public.\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Early life===\n[[File:Dylan thomas birthplace.jpg|thumb|upright|left|5 Cwmdonkin Drive, [[Swansea]], birthplace of Dylan Thomas|alt=On a hill street stands a two storied semi-detached house with bay windows to the front and a sloped tiled roof with a chimney.]]\n\nDylan Thomas was born on 27 October 1914 in [[Swansea]], the son of Florence Hannah (''n\u00e9e'' Williams; 1882\u20131958), a [[seamstress]], and David John Thomas (1876\u20131952), a teacher.

His images were carefully ordered in a patterned sequence, and his major theme was the unity of all life, the continuing process of life and death and new life that linked the generations. Thomas saw biology as a magical transformation producing unity out of diversity, and in his poetry sought a poetic ritual to celebrate this unity. He saw men and women locked in cycles of growth, love, [[procreation]], new growth, death, and new life. Therefore, each image engenders its opposite. Thomas derived his closely woven, sometimes self-contradictory images from the Bible, [[Welsh mythology|Welsh folklore]], preaching, and [[Sigmund Freud]].<ref>{{cite book|editor1-first=M.
