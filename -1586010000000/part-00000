The Ottoman Empire tried to prevent the rise of local beys, which presented a menace to centralized power. The bey also resented the modernization programs implemented during the reign of [[Mahmud II]]. These reforms were a direct threat to the arbitrary power of the Balkan Muslim aristocracy, who had grown powerful during the long decline of Ottoman power. On January 5, 1829, only one month after the Convention of Berat, its leader, Ismail bey Qemali, was killed in [[Ioannina|Yanina]] by people of [[Re\u015fid Mehmed Pasha]], which caused an upheaval in Southern Albania: in Yanina, Zagoria, Konitsa and Metsovo the Ottoman functionaries were asked to leave by the local population. The Sultan was forced to remove Re\u015fid Mehmed Pasha and to nominate him Grand Vizir on 6 February 1829. In 1830, the [[Sublime Porte]] sent an expeditionary force under the command of Re\u015fid Mehmed Pasha to suppress the local Albanian beys. On hearing the news of the Ottoman forces' arrival, the three most powerful local chiefs, Zylyftar Poda, accompanied by the remains of [[Ali Pasha of Yannina|Ali Pasha]]'s faction, Veli Bey (whose power base was around [[Yannina]]), and Arslan Bey, along with other less powerful beys, began to prepare their forces to resist a probable Ottoman attack.<ref name=To167-169>{{harvnb|Tozer|2009|pages=167\u2013169}}.</ref>\n\n==Massacre==\nRealising the seriousness of the situation and the danger of a general uprising, Re\u015fid Mehmed Pasha invited the Albanian beys to a meeting on the pretext that they would be rewarded for their loyalty to the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]].<ref name=vi24/> Two of the main leaders, Veli and Arslan Bey, accepted the invitation and went together with their followers to meet with Re\u015fid Mehmed Pasha at his headquarters in Monastir. On their arrival there, the Turkish commander led them into an enclosed field when they saw Turkish forces aligned in ceremonial salute parade. In fact, this was an ambush, and upon a sign from the pasha, the soldiers opened fire on the surprised Albanian beys and their personal guards. All the Albanians who had entered the field, some four to five hundred, were killed, while Arslan tried in vain to escape. He was killed by Ottoman forces after a short pursuit.<ref name=To167-169/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe massacre of the Albanian beys was a strong blow to the beys' power in Albania. In addition, the Ottomans, after having managed to deprive southern Albania from its leaders, defeated the following year, in 1831, the [[Pashalik of Scutari]], the last remaining Albanian pashalik giving signals of [[separatism]]. Albanians would lose track with that particular period which led to the creation of new neighboring Balkan states. The population was not allowed to carry arms anymore, even the Muslims.

The Ottoman Empire tried to prevent the rise of local beys, which presented a menace to centralized power. The bey also resented the modernization programs implemented during the reign of [[Mahmud II]]. These reforms were a direct threat to the arbitrary power of the Balkan Muslim aristocracy, who had grown powerful during the long decline of Ottoman power. On January 5, 1829, only one month after the Convention of Berat, its leader, Ismail bey Qemali, was killed in [[Ioannina|Yanina]] by people of [[Re\u015fid Mehmed Pasha]], which caused an upheaval in Southern Albania: in Yanina, Zagoria, Konitsa and Metsovo the Ottoman functionaries were asked to leave by the local population. The Sultan was forced to remove Re\u015fid Mehmed Pasha and to nominate him Grand Vizir on 6 February 1829. In 1830, the [[Sublime Porte]] sent an expeditionary force under the command of Re\u015fid Mehmed Pasha to suppress the local Albanian beys. On hearing the news of the Ottoman forces' arrival, the three most powerful local chiefs, Zylyftar Poda, accompanied by the remains of [[Ali Pasha of Yannina|Ali Pasha]]'s faction, Veli Bey (whose power base was around [[Yannina]]), and Arslan Bey, along with other less powerful beys, began to prepare their forces to resist a probable Ottoman attack.<ref name=To167-169>{{harvnb|Tozer|2009|pages=167\u2013169}}.</ref>\n\n==Massacre==\nRealising the seriousness of the situation and the danger of a general uprising, Re\u015fid Mehmed Pasha invited the Albanian beys to a meeting on the pretext that they would be rewarded for their loyalty to the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]].<ref name=vi24/> Two of the main leaders, Veli and Arslan Bey, accepted the invitation and went together with their followers to meet with Re\u015fid Mehmed Pasha at his headquarters in Monastir. On their arrival there, the Turkish commander led them into an enclosed field when they saw Turkish forces aligned in ceremonial salute parade. In fact, this was an ambush, and upon a sign from the pasha, the soldiers opened fire on the surprised Albanian beys and their personal guards. All the Albanians who had entered the field, some four to five hundred, were killed, while Arslan tried in vain to escape. He was killed by Ottoman forces after a short pursuit.<ref name=To167-169/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe massacre of the Albanian beys was a strong blow to the beys' power in Albania. In addition, the Ottomans, after having managed to deprive southern Albania from its leaders, defeated the following year, in 1831, the [[Pashalik of Scutari]], the last remaining Albanian pashalik giving signals of [[separatism]]. Albanians would lose track with that particular period which led to the creation of new neighboring Balkan states. The population was not allowed to carry arms anymore, even the Muslims. The ruling cast throughout the Albanian Vilayets would be substituted with a more fanatic leadership, which would have a strong negative impact during the [[Albanian National Awakening]] later.

An Orange and red version was made as a prize for a speed run competition for Metroid Zero Mission. A red SP with a circle with an M in it was created, modeled after [[Mario|Mario's cap]]; it also came in a bundle that included the game Mario Vs. Donkey Kong.{{Main|List of Game Boy colors and styles#Game Boy Advance SP}}\n\nThe GBA SP is slightly more than half the size of the GBA when closed and roughly the height of Nintendo's [[Game Boy Color]] when open. This model of the Game Boy can play all Game Boy cartridges including Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance carts. The clamshell (or laptop design) protects the screen from scratches and dust, reminiscent of two-screen [[Game & Watch]] units. However, the casing is made from a different material, making it more prone to scratches than previous Game Boy systems. The slot for cartridges has been moved to the bottom of the system, facing down. This makes using special cartridges, such as the [[Game Boy Camera]] and Kirby: Tilt and Tumble, more difficult. The GBA was Nintendo's first handheld system to have a built-in backlight released outside of Japan; however, there was a Japanese exclusive, the GameBoy light that also featured a backlight.\n\nThe GBA SP AC adapter comes with the package to recharge its lithium ion battery, something previous Game Boys did not have (they usually used commercially available batteries). This adapter is also compatible with the original version of the DS. The software library and general hardware specifications are identical to those of the Game Boy Advance.\n\nIn Japan it was released in a variety of standard colors and special packages. In most other regions it was released in Platinum Silver and Charcoal Black. Later, a Flame Red version was released. Six special editions have also been released: a NES Classics model with the same color scheme as a classic NES controller (and designed to resemble a [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] deck when closed), a [[SpongeBob SquarePants]] model, a [[Pikachu]] model, and a silver model with a tattoo design printed on it, known as the 'Tribal Edition'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/newsArt.cfm?artid=9501|title=Tribal Edition GBA SP for Europe  - News|author=|date=|website=Nintendo World Report}}</ref> In other regions, such as Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, additional colors have been released, such as Pearl Green and Starlight Gold.<ref>[http://gameforfun.com/es/product.asp?product_id=3663 Gameboy Advance SP Star Light Gold Toys R Us Limited Edition (GFF-3663)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711070758/http://gameforfun.com/es/product.asp?product_id=3663 |date=July 11, 2011 }}</ref>  Additionally, two new special versions have been released in Asia exclusive to that region.\n\nNintendo was planning to have the SP be 3D-compatible, but the resolution of LCD was too low, resulting in Nintendo scrapping it.<ref>[http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/3ds/how-nintendo-3ds-made/0/2 Iwata Asks] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.fo/20120711043522/http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/%23/3ds/how-nintendo-3ds-made/0/2 |date=July 11, 2012 }}.

Since the [[Nintendo DS]] used the same charging port as the GBA SP, the headphone adapter works with said console.\n\nAs both AC adapter and headphones use the same port, it is not possible to charge the SP and listen to headphones at the same time with the Nintendo brand adapter.

On the frontlit models this button turned the frontlight on or off only. With the backlight set to \"Normal\" (Low) the brightness still surpasses the original AGS-001 with the frontlight on.\n* When powered off, the backlit model's screen is completely black, but the frontlit model's screen is noticeably lighter.\n\nThe North American backlit version comes in three standard colors: \"Pearl Blue\", \"Pearl Pink\" and \"Graphite\" (a greyer version of Onyx Black). There were also two [[Toys \"R\" Us]] exclusive backlit models; a \"[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]\" model<ref>[http://uk.gameboy.ign.com/articles/652/652641p1.html GBA SP Gets Brighter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614220645/http://uk.gameboy.ign.com/articles/652/652641p1.html |date=June 14, 2010 }}</ref> and a \"Limited Edition [[Pikachu]]\" model.\n\nIn 2006, the AGS-101 backlit model also saw a very limited release in [[Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news230905brightersp|title=Brighter SP coming to Europe|website=eurogamer.net|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612135413/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news230905brightersp|archivedate=June 12, 2010}}</ref> Few models made it to market, likely due to the release of the [[Game Boy Advance]]-compatible [[Nintendo DS]] one year prior.

In addition, only the \"Surf Blue\" color was unique to the AGS-101, the other two colors \"Pink\" and \"Tribal\" had already been released as frontlit models - for these reasons it can be very difficult to identify a European backlit SP. Apart from the AGS-101 model number on the base of the unit, the only other obvious distinguishing feature of the European backlit model is the large picture of the Game Boy Advance SP featured on the front of the box. (The European frontlit models of \"Pink\" and \"Tribal\" only feature small pictures of the Game Boy Advance SP on the sides of the box and Flower/Tattoo patterns on the front respectively.)\n\nIt is also the final Nintendo handheld to have backwards compatibility with [[Game Boy]] and [[Game Boy Color]] games.\n\n==Unit colors==\n{{See also|List of Game Boy colors and styles#Game Boy Advance SP}}\nThe Game Boy Advance SP had numerous colors and limited editions.\n\n{{div col | colwidth=20em}}\n* [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] (New Zealand only)\n* Blue Kyogre\n* Cobalt Blue\n* Flame Red\n* Famicom 20th Anniversary Edition\n* Gold with Zelda [[Triforce]]\n* Graphite\n* Green Rayquaza\n* Green Venusaur\n* Kingdom Silver (''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'' Edition)\n* Mario\n* NES Black (UK and US only as a limited edition)\n* Onyx Black\n* Pearl Blue\n* Pearl Green\n* Pearl Pink\n* Pearl White (Limited Edition)\n* Pikachu Yellow\n* Platinum\n* Platinum & Onyx (Limited Edition)\n* Red Groudon\n* Snow White\n* Spice & Lime\n* SpongeBob\n* Surf Blue (UK only)\n* Torchic Orange\n* Tribal\n* White Rip Curl special edition (Australia only)\n* \"Who Are You?\" (Black with \"Who Are You?\" printed on the top)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\nM.

A special ''Pok\u00e9mon Emerald'' pack contained a limited edition Green Rayquaza SP and the Emerald game. A limited edition backlit edition exists. There is also an [[All Blacks]] edition. An Orange and red version was made as a prize for a speed run competition for Metroid Zero Mission. A red SP with a circle with an M in it was created, modeled after [[Mario|Mario's cap]]; it also came in a bundle that included the game Mario Vs. Donkey Kong.{{Main|List of Game Boy colors and styles#Game Boy Advance SP}}\n\nThe GBA SP is slightly more than half the size of the GBA when closed and roughly the height of Nintendo's [[Game Boy Color]] when open. This model of the Game Boy can play all Game Boy cartridges including Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance carts. The clamshell (or laptop design) protects the screen from scratches and dust, reminiscent of two-screen [[Game & Watch]] units. However, the casing is made from a different material, making it more prone to scratches than previous Game Boy systems. The slot for cartridges has been moved to the bottom of the system, facing down. This makes using special cartridges, such as the [[Game Boy Camera]] and Kirby: Tilt and Tumble, more difficult. The GBA was Nintendo's first handheld system to have a built-in backlight released outside of Japan; however, there was a Japanese exclusive, the GameBoy light that also featured a backlight.\n\nThe GBA SP AC adapter comes with the package to recharge its lithium ion battery, something previous Game Boys did not have (they usually used commercially available batteries). This adapter is also compatible with the original version of the DS.

On the frontlit models this button turned the frontlight on or off only. With the backlight set to \"Normal\" (Low) the brightness still surpasses the original AGS-001 with the frontlight on.\n* When powered off, the backlit model's screen is completely black, but the frontlit model's screen is noticeably lighter.\n\nThe North American backlit version comes in three standard colors: \"Pearl Blue\", \"Pearl Pink\" and \"Graphite\" (a greyer version of Onyx Black). There were also two [[Toys \"R\" Us]] exclusive backlit models; a \"[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]\" model<ref>[http://uk.gameboy.ign.com/articles/652/652641p1.html GBA SP Gets Brighter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614220645/http://uk.gameboy.ign.com/articles/652/652641p1.html |date=June 14, 2010 }}</ref> and a \"Limited Edition [[Pikachu]]\" model.\n\nIn 2006, the AGS-101 backlit model also saw a very limited release in [[Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news230905brightersp|title=Brighter SP coming to Europe|website=eurogamer.net|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612135413/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news230905brightersp|archivedate=June 12, 2010}}</ref> Few models made it to market, likely due to the release of the [[Game Boy Advance]]-compatible [[Nintendo DS]] one year prior.

In addition, only the \"Surf Blue\" color was unique to the AGS-101, the other two colors \"Pink\" and \"Tribal\" had already been released as frontlit models - for these reasons it can be very difficult to identify a European backlit SP. Apart from the AGS-101 model number on the base of the unit, the only other obvious distinguishing feature of the European backlit model is the large picture of the Game Boy Advance SP featured on the front of the box. (The European frontlit models of \"Pink\" and \"Tribal\" only feature small pictures of the Game Boy Advance SP on the sides of the box and Flower/Tattoo patterns on the front respectively.)\n\nIt is also the final Nintendo handheld to have backwards compatibility with [[Game Boy]] and [[Game Boy Color]] games.\n\n==Unit colors==\n{{See also|List of Game Boy colors and styles#Game Boy Advance SP}}\nThe Game Boy Advance SP had numerous colors and limited editions.\n\n{{div col | colwidth=20em}}\n* [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] (New Zealand only)\n* Blue Kyogre\n* Cobalt Blue\n* Flame Red\n* Famicom 20th Anniversary Edition\n* Gold with Zelda [[Triforce]]\n* Graphite\n* Green Rayquaza\n* Green Venusaur\n* Kingdom Silver (''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]'' Edition)\n* Mario\n* NES Black (UK and US only as a limited edition)\n* Onyx Black\n* Pearl Blue\n* Pearl Green\n* Pearl Pink\n* Pearl White (Limited Edition)\n* Pikachu Yellow\n* Platinum\n* Platinum & Onyx (Limited Edition)\n* Red Groudon\n* Snow White\n* Spice & Lime\n* SpongeBob\n* Surf Blue (UK only)\n* Torchic Orange\n* Tribal\n* White Rip Curl special edition (Australia only)\n* \"Who Are You?\" (Black with \"Who Are You?\" printed on the top)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\nM.

Though these arguments place her outside the academic consensus, Curry said that her findings were compatible with those presented by the [[International Panel on Climate Change]].

She said that she \"does not have confidence in the process\" due to the use of non-peer-reviewed papers, the appointment of unsuitable representatives to high-status positions, and based on her personal experience on the panel. She also critiques the scientific community's use of uncertainties, describing how her engagement with the climate skeptic blogging community led her to revise how she viewed the uncertainties involved in climate modeling.

Though these arguments place her outside the academic consensus, Curry said that her findings were compatible with those presented by the [[International Panel on Climate Change]].

The Trust seeks to enhance Oxford by encouraging thoughtful development and new design, while protecting historic buildings and green open spaces. \n\nThe Trust is a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]]<ref>{{EW charity|203043|THE OXFORD PRESERVATION TRUST}}</ref> and is run by a board of [[trustee]]s and an executive committee. It employs five staff including its [[Executive Director|Director]], Debbie Dance.\n\nThe Trust is a member of the [[Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Board]].\n\n==Projects==\nThe Trust's notable projects have included the successful conversion in the early 1990's of St George's Tower on the Oxford Castle site  into a popular  tourist attraction. It has also published reports advising on the redevelopment of parts of Oxford including [[Broad Street, Oxford|Broad Street]] and the former site of the terminus of the [[Oxford Canal]] opposite the end of [[George Street, Oxford|George Street]].\n\nThe Trust has an ongoing role in preserving Oxford's [[Green belt (UK)|green belt]]. To this end it owns several pieces of land at [[Boars Hill]] and elsewhere in and around Oxford. In 2007<ref>[http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/search/1847099.Bodleian_refusal_forces_rethink/ ''Oxford Mail'' 20 November 2007]</ref> and 2008<ref>[http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/search/3662034.Bodleian_s_book_store_thrown_out/''Oxford Mail'' 10 September 2008]</ref> the Trust successfully opposed the [[Bodleian Library]]'s proposal to build a [[Bodleian_Library#The_library.27s_future|new book depository]] that would have obstructed a view from Boar's Hill of Oxford's skyline that the [[poet]] [[Matthew Arnold]] (1822\u20131888) called the city's \"[[Thyrsis (poem)|dreaming spires]]\".\n\n==Chairmen==\nDuring its history OPT has been chaired by a number of prominent academic and other figures.<ref>''Chairmen'': list framed and hung on the wall of the first floor meeting room at OPT's offices, 10 Turn Again Lane, Oxford</ref> Several have chaired OPT at the same time as being [[List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Oxford|vice-chancellor]] of the [[University of Oxford]].\n*[[H.

Together, they wrote most of the music. Percussionist and saxophonist Per Eriksson is among the longest-serving members. Lolita Pop scored eight studio albums and about 800 performances in Sweden, Europe and the United States. Some of their popular songs were Tarzan on a Big Red Scooter, Hey Winner, Mind Your Eye, and Bang Your Head.\n\n==Career==\n===Early years===\nLolita Pop formed at the premiere of Rockmagasinet, a club, in \u00d6rebro, Sweden on 26 May 1979. The name of the band was inspired by the appearance of \u201cMiss Lolita\u201d at a local porn club.\n\nThe repertoire consisted mostly of cover songs including [[Iggy Pop]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Roxy Music]] and [[Television (band)|Television]]. These songs were performed in Swedish in humorous translations, such as [[Iggy Pop]]'s \"I'm bored, I'm the chairman of the bored\" became \"I am weary, I stand at the end of every level\" and Television's \"Elevation, do not go to my head, Stop the elevator and my skull is flat.\" [[Per Eriksson (musician)|Per Eriksson]] designed stickers with the band's name and distributed them to friends who were on a trip. The result was that Lolita Pop's name could be seen in Stockholm, Hamburg, Paris, New York, New Delhi and Beijing long before the band played outside their club. Per Eriksson also designed most of the band's album covers.\n\nLolita Pop's first album was Rogue Pictures and was published by Pipaluckbolaget in 1982. The legacy of the New York band [[Television (band)|Television]] was heard clearly in Benkt Svensson's guitar solo in \u201cBlack and Dirty\u201d. Punky \u201cGold Here?\u201d eventually became the music in the computer game Invasion Gotland, a Swedish version of [[Battlefield Vietnam]].\n\n===Mid-Career===\nIn 1983 the band changed record labels to Mistlur and released two albums. Before the filming of \u201cFive Seeking a Taxi\u201d, the drummer at that time, Peter Olsen, was replaced by the band's saxophonist Per Eriksson. Bassist Thomas Johansson dropped out prior to recording \u201cWanderings\u201d. He continued to write lyrics throughout Lolita Pop's career.\n\nIn 1983 and 1984, the band toured Sweden and visited many places all over the country. On several occasions, they had local bands opening for them as for instance in Bj\u00f6rklinge, where Fire was the opening act.\n\nLolita Pop then began directing its focus overseas in 1984. The band released the album Lolita Pop, with English-language versions of previously released songs, and did a few European tours.\n\nUlf Lernhammar skipped 1985 for the filming of Lolita Pop's last Swedish-language album \u201cHave Pleasure\u201d. Benkt Svensson took over the base. After performing in the United States, a recording contract was made with [[Virgin Records]] U.S.. The band's friendship with Television guitarist [[Richard Lloyd (guitarist)|Richard Lloyd]] led to Eriksson, Olsen and Johansson appearing on his album \u201c[[Field of Fire (album)|Fields of Fire]]\u201d. In 1986, Matts Alsberg from the Stockholm band Rust became bassist and Benkt Svensson returned to the guitar.\n\n===Later Years===\nIn 1987, Virgin Records supplemented an English version of \u201cHave Pleasure\u201d with the newly written songs Bang Your Head and Mind Your Eye. Bang Your Head appeared on the soundtrack of the American film \u201cHiding Out\u201d. \"Mind Your Eye\" was used in [[Colin Nutley]] movie \u201cThe Ninth Company\u201d and the Maria Gripe film \u201c[[Agnes Cecilia]]\u201d. In Sweden, \u201cHave Pleasure\u201d was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].\n\nIn 1988, Karin Wistrand sang the duet \u201cStay with You\u201d with Orup. The song was on the track list for six weeks. Matts Alsberg left Lolita Pop and was replaced by Henrik Melin from the \u00d6rebro band \u201cMr. Krystal Party\u201d. Lolita Pop released \u201cLove Poison\u201d in 1989, the band's first album that was written directly in English. \u201cHey Winner\u201d and \u201cTarzan on a Big Red Scooter\u201d appeared up on the Swedish charts \u2013 \"Tarzan...\" was on the Sommartoppen list all summer and reached number one in August 1989. \"Hey Winner\" became the soundtrack to Colin Nutley's \u201cHeartbreak Hotel\u201d and the TV series \u201c[[Tusenbr\u00f6der]]\u201d. \u201cHey Winner\u201d was also nominated for a Grammy award. The band launched its career overseas when Benkt Svensson and Per Eriksson left the band after ten years.\n\nLolita Pop released their last album in 1990, which was \u201cBlumenkraft\u201d, with Fredrik Blank as new guitarist and Chris (Muttis) Bj\u00f6rklund on drums. This too was nominated for a Grammis award. The band continued to tour until 1991. After that, Karin Wistrand and Fredrik Blank worked with Karin's solo album \"The Sun\", which was released in 1993. Sten Booberg freelanced as a guitarist throughout the 1990s and played with, among others, the Muppets, Olle Ljungstr\u00f6m, Marty Robbins, Orup and Idde Schultz. Fredrik Blank played with Staffan Hellstrand, Idde Schultz and other famous musicians.\n\nSince disbandment, Lolita Pop has been frugal with reunions. The original group of 1987 reunited three times to audiences in the 1990s, including the Castle Festival in [[\u00d6rebro]] in July 1997 for about 10,000 people.\n\n===The Next Generation===\nBenkt Svensson's daughters Klara and Johanna S\u00f6derberg are touring extensively across the world under the name [[First Aid Kit (band)|First Aid Kit]]. Sten Booberg's son Rasmus Booberg is the lead singer, guitarist and songwriter in the band ''New Keepers of the Water Towers''. Their second album was released in 2010 under the U.S. label [[MeteorCity]]. Rasmus is also the drummer in the rock band \u201cGrass Eating Man\u201d.\n\n==Members==\n*Karin Wistrand, vocals, guitar (1979\u201392)\n*Sten Booberg, guitar (1979\u201392)\n*Benkt Svensson (now Benkt S\u00f6derberg), guitar, bass (1979\u201389)\n*Per Eriksson (now Per Stahlberg), drums, saxophone (1979\u201389)\n*Thomas Johansson, bass (1979\u201383)\n*Peter Olsen, drums (1980\u201383)\n*Ulf Lernhammar, bass (1983\u201384)\n*Matts Alsberg, bass (1986\u201387)\n*Henrik Melin, bass (1987\u201392)\n*Fredrik Blank, guitar (1989\u201392)\n*Christer \"Muttis\" Bj\u00f6rklund, drums (1989\u201390)\n*Magnus \"Norpan\" Eriksson, drums (1990\u201392)\n\n==Discography==\n*Falska Bilder LP, Pipaluckbolaget 1982 (PLP 2)\n*Fem S\u00f6ker En Skatt LP, Mistlur 1983 (MLR 28)\n*Irrf\u00e4rder LP, Mistlur 1983 (MLR 38)\n*Lolita Pop LP, Mistlur 1984 (MLR 40)\n*Att Ha Fritidsb\u00e5t LP, Mistlur 1985 (MLR 44)\n*Lolita Pop LP, Mistlur 1987 (MLR 56) CD, Mistlur 1987 (MLRCD 56) CD, Virgin, 1987 (CDV 2472) MC, Virgin, 1987 (4-90620) MC, Virgin, 1987 (7-90620-4) LP Virgin 1987 (1-90620) CD, Virgin, 1987 (2-90620) LP Virgin 1987 (VJL-28038)\n*Love Poison LP, Mistlur 1989 (MLR 66) CD, Mistlur 1989 (MLRCD 66)\n*Blumenkraft LP, Mistlur 1990 (MLR 77) CD, Mistlur 1990 (MLRCD 77)\n*Regn Av Dagar 1982-1990 CD, MNW 1993 (MNWCD 248)\n*Lolita Pop: MNW klassiker 2CD 2008 (MNWCD 20\u201345)\n\n===Singles===\n*K\u00e4rlekens Pedaler 7\", Pipaluckbolaget 1981 (PLS 3)\n*Jorduppg\u00e5ng 7\", Mistlur 1982 (MLRS-30)\n*Kuggar 12\", Mistlur 1985 (MLRDJ-04)\n*2000 \u00c5r 7\", Mistlur 1985 (MLRS-46)\n*Mind Your Eye 7\", Mistlur 1987 (MLRS 53)\n*Bang Your Head 12\", Mistlur 1987 (MLRDJ 9) 12\" Virgin 1987 (PR 2077)\n*Bang Your Head 7\", Mistlur 1988 (MLRS 62)\n*Bang Your Head 12\", Virgin 1988 (VST 1024)\n*Hey Winner 7\", Mistlur 1989 (MLRS 67)\n*Tarzan On A Big Red Scooter 7\", Mistlur 1989 (MLRS 70)\n*Pay The Piper 7\", Mistlur 1990 (MLRS 81)\n*Here She Comes 7\", Mistlur 1990 (MLRS 84)\n*Live Forever 7\", Mistlur 1991 (MLRS 85)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1979]]\n[[Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1992]]\n[[Category:1979 establishments in Sweden]]\n[[Category:1991 disestablishments in Sweden]]\n[[Category:Swedish musical groups]]\n[[Category:Swedish pop music groups]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox musical artist\n| name            = Lolita Pop\n| image           = \n| image_size      = \n| image_upright   = \n| landscape       = \n| alt             = \n| caption         = \n| background      = group_or_band\n| alias           = \n| origin          = [[\u00d6rebro]], [[Sweden]]\n| genre           = pop-rock\n| years_active    = {{start date|df=y|1979}}\u2013{{end date|df=y|1991}}\n| label           = \n| associated_acts = \n| website         = \n| current_members = \n| past_members    = \n| module          = \n| module2         = \n| module3         = \n}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2013}}\n\n'''Lolita Pop''' was a Swedish rock band from [[\u00d6rebro]] that was active 1979\u20131992.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/musik/a/50WKmz/lolita-pop-aterforenas|title=Lolita Pop \u00e5terf\u00f6renas|publisher=Aftonbladet|language=Swedish|author=H\u00e5kan Steen|date=24 May 2019|accessdate=22 October 2019}}</ref> They scored successes on the [[Sverigetopplistan|Swedish album chart]] during the 1980's and early 1990's.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://swedishcharts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Lolita+Pop|title=Discography Lolita Pop|publisher=Swedishcharts|language=English|accessdate=22 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe band's core consisted of singer Karin Wistrand and guitarists Sten Booberg and Benkt Svensson (later Benkt S\u00f6derberg).
