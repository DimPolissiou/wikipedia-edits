The game takes in a large city still recovering from a war decades prior to the game's start, with players taking the role of an amnesic detective who has been charged with solving a murder mystery. During the investigation, he comes to recall events about his own past as well as current forces trying to affect the city. Inspired by [[Infinity Engine]]\u2013era role-playing games, particularly ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'', ''Disco Elysium'' was written and designed by [[Estonians|Estonian]] novelist [[Robert Kurvitz]]. It features a distinctive [[watercolor]] art style, and music by the band [[British Sea Power]]. It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] on 15 October 2019, with [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Nintendo Switch]] releases planned for 2020.\n\n''Disco Elysium'' is a non-traditional role-playing game featuring no combat. Instead, resolution of events are done though skill checks and [[dialog tree]]s via a system of 24 skills that represent different aspects of the protagonist, such as their pain threshold and perception. In addition, a system called the \"Thought Cabinet\" represents other ideologies and personality traits of the protagonist, with players having the ability to freely support or suppress them. The game was based on a [[tabletop role-playing game]] setting that Kurvitz had previously created, with him forming ZA/UM in 2016 as a way to build out the game. ''Disco Elysium'' was critically acclaimed, with it being named as a [[game of the year]] by several publications and winning numerous other awards for its narrative and art.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Disco Elysium interface.jpg|thumb|left|The current dialog for ''Disco Elysium'' running along the right side of the screen showing conversations in white and choices in red, atop the current scene the character is in]]\n''Disco Elysium'' is a [[role-playing video game]] that features an [[open world]] and dialogue-heavy gameplay mechanics.<ref name=PCGUS/><ref name=techspot>{{cite web |last=Cohen |first=Coberly |date=16 October 2019 |url=https://www.techspot.com/news/82354-ambitious-open-world-rpg-disco-elysium-you-take.html |title=Ambitious open-world RPG Disco Elysium lets you take on the role of a mentally unstable detective |publisher=Techspot |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> The game is presented in an [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric perspective]] in which the [[player character]] is controlled.<ref name=USgamer/> The player takes the role of a detective on a murder case who suffers from alcohol and drug-induced amnesia.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lang |first1=Brad |date=17 October 2019 |title=Disco Elysium Review \u2013 Stayin' Alive |url=https://www.criticalhit.net/review/disco-elysium-review-stayin-alive/ |website=Critical Hit |accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref> The player can move the detective about the current screen to interact with [[non-player character]]s (NPC) and highlighted objects or move onto other screens. Early in the game they gain a partner, Kim Kitsuragi, another detective who acts as the protagonist's voice of professionalism and who may be able to offer advice or support in certain dialog options. Other NPCs may be influenced to become temporary companies that join the group and provide similar support.\n\nThe gameplay features no combat in the traditional sense; instead, it is handled through skill checks and [[dialog tree|dialogue trees]].<ref name=gamecrate>{{cite web |date=16 October 2019 |first=Justin |last=Woo |url=https://www.gamecrate.com/disco-elysium-character-generation-skill-checks-and-gameplay-strategy/24424 |title=Disco Elysium: Character generation, skill checks and gameplay strategy |website=GameCrate |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> There are four primary abilities in the game: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, and Motorics, and each ability has six distinct secondary skills for a total of 24.<ref name=rockpapershotgunskills>{{cite web |date=14 October 2019 |first=Ollie |last=Toms |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/14/disco-elysium-skills-character-creation-intellect-psyche-physique-motorics-and-the-24-skills-explained/ |title=Disco Elysium skills & character creation: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, Motorics, and the 24 skills explained |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> The player improves these skills through skill points earned from leveling up. The choice of clothing that the player equips on the player-character can impart both positive and negative effects on certain skills.<ref name=gamecrate/> Upgrading these skills help the player character pass skill checks, made based on a random dice roll, but could also potentially result in negative effects and character quirks. For instance, a player character with high Drama may be able to detect and fabricate lies effectively, but may also become prone to hysterics and paranoia. Likewise, high Electrochemistry shields the player character from the negative effects of drugs and provides knowledge on them, but may also lead to substance abuse and other self-destructive behaviors.<ref name=rockpapershotgunskills/>\n\n''Disco Elysium'' features a secondary inventory system, the Thought Cabinet. Thoughts are unlockable through conversations with other characters, as well as through internal dialogues within the mind of the player character himself. The player is then able to \"internalize\" a thought through a certain amount of in-game hours, which, once completed, grants the player character permanent benefits but also occasionally negative effects, a concept that ZA/UM compared to the trait system used in the ''[[Fallout (video game series)|Fallout]]'' series.<ref name=\"zaum hungarian interview\">{{cite web | url = https://zaumstudio.com/2017/03/31/the-hungarian-interview/ | title = The Hungarian Interview| first = Mikk | last = Metsniit | date = 31 March 2017 | accessdate = 8 April 2020 | publisher = ZA/UM }}</ref> A limited number of slots are available in the Thought Cabinet at the start, though more can be gained with experience levels. For example, an early possible option for the Thought Cabinet is the \"Hobocop\" thought, which the character ponders the option of living on the streets to save money, which reduces the character's composure with other NPCs while the thought is internalized. When the character has completed the Hobocop thought, it then allows them to find more junk on the streets that can be sold for money.<ref>{{cite web |date=15 October 2019 |first=Ollie |last=Toms |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/15/disco-elysium-thought-cabinet-the-thoughts-system-explained/#what-is-the-thought-cabinet |title=Disco Elysium Thought Cabinet: the Thoughts system explained |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"GSpot\"/>\n\nThe 24 skills also play into the dialogue trees, creating a situation where the player-character may have an internal debate with one aspect of their mind or body, creating the idea that the player is communicating with a fragmented persona. These internal conversations may provide suggestions or additional insight that can guide the player into actions or dialogue with the game's non-playable characters, depending on the skill points invested into the skill. For example, the Inland Empire, a subskill of the Psyche, is described by ZA/UM as a representation of the intensity of the soul, and may come into situations where the player-character may need to pass themselves off under a fake identity with the conviction behind that stance, should the player accept this suggestion when debating with Inland Empire.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/your-skills-talk-to-you-in-disco-elysium-an-inventive-rpg-that-keeps-impressing/ |title=Your skills talk to you in Disco Elysium, an inventive RPG that keeps impressing |first=David |last=O'Keefe |date=10 September 2018 |accessdate=7 April 2020 |work=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref>\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Setting ===\n''Disco Elysium'' takes place in the fantastic realism world of Elyisum that had been developed by Kurvitz and his team in the years prior, which includes a fleshed-out six-thousand year history of conflicts, with the game taking place during the setting's most modern period known as \"The Seventies\".<ref name=\"zaum hungarian interview\"/> Elysium is made of landmasses known as isolas that are separated by the Pale, a mysterious connective tissue in which the laws of reality begin to break down. Prolonged exposure to the Pale can cause mental instability, and traversing the Pale is considered highly dangerous.<ref name=gamerant>{{cite web |date=24 January 2020 |first=Philip |last=Trahan |url=https://gamerant.com/disco-elysium-world-explained/ |title=The World of Disco Elysium Explained |website=GameRant |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> Nations and people within ''Disco Elysium'' follow different ideologies, including [[communism]], [[fascism]], moralism (the setting's stand-in for [[centrism]]) and ultraliberalism (the setting's stand-in for [[right-libertarianism]]).\n\nThe setting's political and cultural history is also markedly different. The philosophy of communism was founded by an economist and a historical materialist named Kras Mazov, and rather than being associated with the color red and symbols like [[hammer and sickle]], the ideology is instead represented by the color white and symbolised by deer antlers surrounding a pentagram. Moralism, meanwhile, despite being a centrist ideology, also has religious overtones and connotations, since it is associated with the setting's largest religion, the Moralist International, the dominant feature of which are the so-called \"Innocences\", [[saint]]-like figures, who also wielded great religious and political power while they were alive, akin to the position of pope. The greatest and most influential amongst the historical Innocences is Dolores Dei, a woman of mysterious origins, who allegedly had glowing lungs and founded many of the world's modern institutions. Due to Dolores Dei's influence, the symbol of love in ''Disco Elysium''{{'s}} world is a set of lungs, rather than a heart.\n\nEvents in the game take place in the fictional city of Revachol on the isola of Insulinde, specifically in Martinaise, a district plagued by poverty, crime, and corruption.<ref name=\"PCGUS\" /><ref name=gamerant/> Five decades before the start of the game, a communist revolution took place in Revachol and successfully overthrew the old monarchy that controlled the city. A [[Commune (model of government)|commune]] was formed afterwards, but it was soon toppled by an invasion of an alliance of capitalist nations calling themselves \"the Coalition\". Revachol has since been designated a Special Administrative Region under the Coalition, who holds a strong grip over the city's local economy and keeps its autonomy at a minimum. One of the few governmental functions that Revachol is allowed to handle itself is upholding day to day law and order, which is the task of the Revachol Citizens Militia (RCM). While starting as a voluntary citizens brigade, the RCM has since grown and evolved into a semi-professional police force.\n\n=== Plot ===\n{{plot|date=March 2020}}\nThe player character wakes up in a trashed cafeteria motel room with a severe hangover and no memory of his own identity. He is greeted by a Lieutenant Kim Kitsuragi, who informs him that they have been assigned to investigate the death of a hanged man in the cafeteria's backyard. His identity is unclear and initial investigation indicates that he was [[lynched]] by a group of people. The detectives set out to explore the rest of the district, following up on leads while investigating smaller cases, helping residents with a variety of tasks.\n\nThese tasks allow the player to begin to fill in gaps in the detective\u2019s identity, revealing him to be  Harrier \"Harry\" DuBois. A decorated RCM detective, Harry experienced an event several years ago that began a [[mid-life crisis]], eventually culminating in a self-destructive bender around Martinaise in which he dismissed the rest of his squad. Through their work, they discover the killing appears to be connected to an ongoing strike by the Martinaise\u2019s dockworkers union against the Wild Pines corporation. They seek out representatives of both the dockworkers and the Wild Pines corporation, meeting up with Evrart Claire for more information on the union and Joyce Messier on the involvement of Wild Pines.\n\nThis leads them to discover that the man was killed before the hanging. The Hardie Boys, a group of dockworkers who act as [[Vigilante|vigilantes]] in Martinaise, claim collective responsibility for the murder. They assert that the man attempted to rape a cafeteria guest by the name of Klaasje. Seeking more information on the man, they return to Joyce, who reveals that the hanged man's name was 'Lely' and that he was a member of a mercenary squad assigned to protect Joyce during negotiations with the union. However, the death of Lely has driven them to go rogue. Joyce warns that unless the detectives find the true culprit soon, the mercenaries will likely enact bloody retribution across Martinaise.\n\nThey meet with Klassje for her end of the story who reveals that Lely was shot in the mouth while the two were having sex. Unable to figure out the origin of the bullet and fearful of involving the authorities, Klaasje enlisted the help of a dockworker named Ruby, who with the rest of the Hardie Boys staged Lely's death as a hanging. The detectives then follow the trail across the shore and eventually find Ruby hiding within an abandoned building, where she incapacitates them with a Pale device. She claims that the cover-up was all Klaasje's idea and has no idea who shot Lely. The player manages to resist or disable the Pale device and tries to arrest her. Ruby states that she would rather kill herself, which she does if she is unable to escape.\n\nThe detectives return to find themselves in a standoff between the mercenaries and the Hardie Boys. A firefight breaks out and the player is badly wounded, blacking out and waking up a few days later. Most or all the mercenaries are killed and Kim may be hospitalized, in which case street urchin Cuno offers to take his place. The detectives begin chasing down their last leads, ultimately determining that the shot that killed Lely came from an old sea fort just off the shore of Martinaise.\n\nWhile at the fort, Harry has a dream in which he meets a manifestation of his ex-fianc\u00e9e Dora Ingerlund, who left Harry out of both dissatisfaction at his low income and his mental instability. She then reveals that this is what drove Harry onto his emotional breakdown; he is plagued by this same dream recurring every couple of days, the moment of her leaving him and him trying and failing to win her back and unable to move on from her.\n\nThe detectives explore the rest of the fort and find the shooter: a former Commissar from the old Revachol communist army named Iosef Lilianovich Dros. Iosef's motivations are revealed to be ultimately born out of his bitterness towards the new capitalist system Lely represented, as well as his sexual envy for Klaasje. With all of the evidence now found, the detectives arrest him for the murder. At this point, the Insulindian Phasmid appears from the reeds. The player may be able to have a psychic conversation with the Phasmid, who tells Harry that it finds the notion of his unstable mind to be fearful, but is in awe at his ability to continue existing day after day. It comforts Harry, telling him to move on from the wreck of his life and move forward. After the detectives take its picture, the Phasmid moves on.\n\nHarry and his partner are confronted by his old squad upon their return to Martenaise. They reflect on Harry's actions during the game, whether he has solved the case and how he handled the mercenaries, as well as being impressed by the news that the Phasmid does exist. Harry's former partner Jean Vicquemare confirms that Harry's emotional breakdown was indeed the result of Dora leaving him several years ago. If the player has done well, the squad expresses hope that Harry's state will improve in the future, and invites him and either Kim or Cuno to a special RCM unit.\n\n==Development==\n''Disco Elysium'' was developed by ZA/UM, a company founded in 2016 by [[Karelians|Karelian]]-[[Estonians|Estonian]] novelist [[Robert Kurvitz]], who served as the game's lead writer and designer.<ref name= Gamesindustry>{{cite web |last=Taylor |first=Haydn |date=31 October 2018 |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-10-31-disco-elysium |title=Chasing oblivion with Disco Elysium and alcohol addiction |website=Gamesindustry.biz}}</ref><ref name= Kurvitz>{{cite web |last1=Macgregor |first1=Jody |title=Disco Elysium's lead designer wants to make an expansion and sequel, has already written a novel |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/disco-elysiums-lead-designer-wants-to-make-an-expansion-and-sequel-has-already-written-a-novel/ |website=PC Gamer |accessdate=13 November 2019}}</ref> Kurvitz since 2001 had been part of a band called Ultramelanhool, and in 2005, while in [[Tallinn]], Estonia, with the group struggling for finances, conceived of a fictional world during a drunken evening while listening to [[Ti\u00ebsto]]'s \"[[Adagio for Strings (Ti\u00ebsto song)|Adagio for Strings]]\".<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/the-making-of-disco-elysium-how-zaum-created-one-of-the-most-original-rpgs-of-the-decade/ |title=The making of Disco Elysium: How ZA/UM created one of the most original RPGs of the decade |first=Alex |last=Alex |last=Wiltshire |date=9 January 2020 |accessdate=8 April 2020 |work=[[GamesRadar]]}}</ref> Feeling this had a solid idea, the group created a collective of artists and musicians, which included Aleksander Rostov, to expand upon the work of that night and developed a [[tabletop RPG]] based on ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' on this [[steampunk]]-like concept.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> During this period, Kurvitz met Estonian author [[Kaur Kender]] who helped him to write a novel set in this world, ''Sacred and Terrible Air'',<ref name= Kurvitz/> which was published in 2013 but only sold about one thousand copies. Kurvitz fell into a period of depression and alcoholism for about three years following the book's failing.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/>\n\nKurvitz eventually pulled himself out of his alcoholism, and helped Kender to also surpass his personal period of alcoholism. As a sign of gratitude, Kender suggested to Kurvitz that instead of pursuing a novel that he try capturing his world as a video game instead as to draw a larger interest. Kurvitz had no experience in video games before, but once he had seen artwork of the game's setting of Revachol as easily fitting into an [[isometric RPG|isometric format]], as well as Rostov's agreement that they might as well continue taking the risk of failing on a video game together, Kurvitz proceeded with the idea.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> Kurvitz wrote a concise description of what the game would be: \"AD&D meets '70s cop-show, in an original 'fantastic realist' setting, with swords, guns and motor-cars. Realised as an isometric CRPG \u2013 a modern advancement on the legendary Planescape: Torment and Baldur's Gate. Massive, reactive story. Exploring a vast, poverty-stricken ghetto. Deep, strategic combat.\"<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> Kender was impressed on the strong statement that he invested into the game's development, with additional investment coming from friends and family.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> The game was announced as an upcoming 2017 game under the title ''No Truce With the Furies'',<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> taken from the poem \"Reflections\" by [[R.S. Thomas]] and published in Thomas' ''No Truce with the Furies'' in 1995.<ref name=\"egm title\"/>\n\nKurvitz established the ZA/UM team to create the game, the name \"za um\" which could be read in Russian as either \"for the mind\" or \"from the mind\".<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> Work on the game started around 2016, with the local team working out of a [[Squatting|squat]] in a former gallery in Tallinn. They were able to secure venture capital into the game during that first year which allowed Kurvitz to seek out the band [[British Sea Power]] for their music for the game's soundtrack. While in [[Birmingham]] to speak to the band, Kurvitz realised England was a better location for the main development team as there were more local resources for both development and for voice-overs.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> During development, some of the staff relocated from Estonia to London and [[Brighton]], with other designers working out of [[Poland]], [[Romania]], and [[China]].<ref name=gamesindustry.biz/><ref name=Postimees>{{cite news |last1=Altk\u00fcla |first1=Magnus |title=Kaur Kender on new computer game: It\u2019s like 'Truth and Justice' |url=https://news.postimees.ee/6807443/kaur-kender-on-new-computer-game-it-s-like-truth-and-justice |publisher=[[Postimees]] |date=22 October 2019 |accessdate=29 December 2019}}</ref> Overall, by the time of the game's release, ZA/UM had about 20 outside consultants and 35 in-house developers,<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> with a team of eight writers assisting Kurvitz in the game's dialog.<ref name=gamesindustry.biz>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-07-20-making-games-under-threat-of-nuclear-war |title=Making games under threat of nuclear war |website=GamesIndustry.biz}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Price |first1=Edward |title=Disco Elysium \u2013 Rezzed 2018 Interview |url=https://gameanalytics.com/blog/disco-elysium-rezzed-2018-interview.html |website=gameanalytics.com |accessdate=19 October 2019}}</ref> The majority of the game's funding was provided by Estonian businessman {{ill|Margus Linnam\u00e4e|et|Margus Linnam\u00e4e}}.<ref name=Postimees/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://raha.geenius.ee/rubriik/uudis/kaur-kenderi-uus-videomanguari-on-neelanud-juba-700-000-eurot-investorite-raha/ |title=Kaur Kenderi uus videom\u00e4ngu\u00e4ri on neelanud juba 700 000 eurot investorite raha |first=Deisi |last=Helem\u00e4e |publisher=Geenius.ee |date=5 September 2018 |lang=Estonian |accessdate=30 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nAs originally planned, the game was to focus on action in a single city location to make the 2017 release.

The game takes in a large city still recovering from a war decades prior to the game's start, with players taking the role of an amnesic detective who has been charged with solving a murder mystery. During the investigation, he comes to recall events about his own past as well as current forces trying to affect the city. Inspired by [[Infinity Engine]]\u2013era role-playing games, particularly ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'', ''Disco Elysium'' was written and designed by [[Estonians|Estonian]] novelist [[Robert Kurvitz]]. It features a distinctive [[watercolor]] art style, and music by the band [[British Sea Power]]. It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] on 15 October 2019, with [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Nintendo Switch]] releases planned for 2020.\n\n''Disco Elysium'' is a non-traditional role-playing game featuring no combat. Instead, resolution of events are done though skill checks and [[dialog tree]]s via a system of 24 skills that represent different aspects of the protagonist, such as their pain threshold and perception. In addition, a system called the \"Thought Cabinet\" represents other ideologies and personality traits of the protagonist, with players having the ability to freely support or suppress them. The game was based on a [[tabletop role-playing game]] setting that Kurvitz had previously created, with him forming ZA/UM in 2016 as a way to build out the game. ''Disco Elysium'' was critically acclaimed, with it being named as a [[game of the year]] by several publications and winning numerous other awards for its narrative and art.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Disco Elysium interface.jpg|thumb|left|The current dialog for ''Disco Elysium'' running along the right side of the screen showing conversations in white and choices in red, atop the current scene the character is in]]\n''Disco Elysium'' is a [[role-playing video game]] that features an [[open world]] and dialogue-heavy gameplay mechanics.<ref name=PCGUS/><ref name=techspot>{{cite web |last=Cohen |first=Coberly |date=16 October 2019 |url=https://www.techspot.com/news/82354-ambitious-open-world-rpg-disco-elysium-you-take.html |title=Ambitious open-world RPG Disco Elysium lets you take on the role of a mentally unstable detective |publisher=Techspot |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> The game is presented in an [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric perspective]] in which the [[player character]] is controlled.<ref name=USgamer/> The player takes the role of a detective on a murder case who suffers from alcohol and drug-induced amnesia.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lang |first1=Brad |date=17 October 2019 |title=Disco Elysium Review \u2013 Stayin' Alive |url=https://www.criticalhit.net/review/disco-elysium-review-stayin-alive/ |website=Critical Hit |accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref> The player can move the detective about the current screen to interact with [[non-player character]]s (NPC) and highlighted objects or move onto other screens. Early in the game they gain a partner, Kim Kitsuragi, another detective who acts as the protagonist's voice of professionalism and who may be able to offer advice or support in certain dialog options. Other NPCs may be influenced to become temporary companies that join the group and provide similar support.\n\nThe gameplay features no combat in the traditional sense; instead, it is handled through skill checks and [[dialog tree|dialogue trees]].<ref name=gamecrate>{{cite web |date=16 October 2019 |first=Justin |last=Woo |url=https://www.gamecrate.com/disco-elysium-character-generation-skill-checks-and-gameplay-strategy/24424 |title=Disco Elysium: Character generation, skill checks and gameplay strategy |website=GameCrate |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> There are four primary abilities in the game: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, and Motorics, and each ability has six distinct secondary skills for a total of 24.<ref name=rockpapershotgunskills>{{cite web |date=14 October 2019 |first=Ollie |last=Toms |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/14/disco-elysium-skills-character-creation-intellect-psyche-physique-motorics-and-the-24-skills-explained/ |title=Disco Elysium skills & character creation: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, Motorics, and the 24 skills explained |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> The player improves these skills through skill points earned from leveling up. The choice of clothing that the player equips on the player-character can impart both positive and negative effects on certain skills.<ref name=gamecrate/> Upgrading these skills help the player character pass skill checks, made based on a random dice roll, but could also potentially result in negative effects and character quirks. For instance, a player character with high Drama may be able to detect and fabricate lies effectively, but may also become prone to hysterics and paranoia. Likewise, high Electrochemistry shields the player character from the negative effects of drugs and provides knowledge on them, but may also lead to substance abuse and other self-destructive behaviors.<ref name=rockpapershotgunskills/>\n\n''Disco Elysium'' features a secondary inventory system, the Thought Cabinet. Thoughts are unlockable through conversations with other characters, as well as through internal dialogues within the mind of the player character himself. The player is then able to \"internalize\" a thought through a certain amount of in-game hours, which, once completed, grants the player character permanent benefits but also occasionally negative effects, a concept that ZA/UM compared to the trait system used in the ''[[Fallout (video game series)|Fallout]]'' series.<ref name=\"zaum hungarian interview\">{{cite web | url = https://zaumstudio.com/2017/03/31/the-hungarian-interview/ | title = The Hungarian Interview| first = Mikk | last = Metsniit | date = 31 March 2017 | accessdate = 8 April 2020 | publisher = ZA/UM }}</ref> A limited number of slots are available in the Thought Cabinet at the start, though more can be gained with experience levels. For example, an early possible option for the Thought Cabinet is the \"Hobocop\" thought, which the character ponders the option of living on the streets to save money, which reduces the character's composure with other NPCs while the thought is internalized. When the character has completed the Hobocop thought, it then allows them to find more junk on the streets that can be sold for money.<ref>{{cite web |date=15 October 2019 |first=Ollie |last=Toms |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/15/disco-elysium-thought-cabinet-the-thoughts-system-explained/#what-is-the-thought-cabinet |title=Disco Elysium Thought Cabinet: the Thoughts system explained |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"GSpot\"/>\n\nThe 24 skills also play into the dialogue trees, creating a situation where the player-character may have an internal debate with one aspect of their mind or body, creating the idea that the player is communicating with a fragmented persona. These internal conversations may provide suggestions or additional insight that can guide the player into actions or dialogue with the game's non-playable characters, depending on the skill points invested into the skill. For example, the Inland Empire, a subskill of the Psyche, is described by ZA/UM as a representation of the intensity of the soul, and may come into situations where the player-character may need to pass themselves off under a fake identity with the conviction behind that stance, should the player accept this suggestion when debating with Inland Empire.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/your-skills-talk-to-you-in-disco-elysium-an-inventive-rpg-that-keeps-impressing/ |title=Your skills talk to you in Disco Elysium, an inventive RPG that keeps impressing |first=David |last=O'Keefe |date=10 September 2018 |accessdate=7 April 2020 |work=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref>\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Setting ===\n''Disco Elysium'' takes place in the fantastic realism world of Elyisum that had been developed by Kurvitz and his team in the years prior, which includes a fleshed-out six-thousand year history of conflicts, with the game taking place during the setting's most modern period known as \"The Seventies\".<ref name=\"zaum hungarian interview\"/> Elysium is made of landmasses known as isolas that are separated by the Pale, a mysterious connective tissue in which the laws of reality begin to break down. Prolonged exposure to the Pale can cause mental instability, and traversing the Pale is considered highly dangerous.<ref name=gamerant>{{cite web |date=24 January 2020 |first=Philip |last=Trahan |url=https://gamerant.com/disco-elysium-world-explained/ |title=The World of Disco Elysium Explained |website=GameRant |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> Nations and people within ''Disco Elysium'' follow different ideologies, including [[communism]], [[fascism]], moralism (the setting's stand-in for [[centrism]]) and ultraliberalism (the setting's stand-in for [[right-libertarianism]]).\n\nThe setting's political and cultural history is also markedly different. The philosophy of communism was founded by an economist and a historical materialist named Kras Mazov, and rather than being associated with the color red and symbols like [[hammer and sickle]], the ideology is instead represented by the color white and symbolised by deer antlers surrounding a pentagram. Moralism, meanwhile, despite being a centrist ideology, also has religious overtones and connotations, since it is associated with the setting's largest religion, the Moralist International, the dominant feature of which are the so-called \"Innocences\", [[saint]]-like figures, who also wielded great religious and political power while they were alive, akin to the position of pope. The greatest and most influential amongst the historical Innocences is Dolores Dei, a woman of mysterious origins, who allegedly had glowing lungs and founded many of the world's modern institutions. Due to Dolores Dei's influence, the symbol of love in ''Disco Elysium''{{'s}} world is a set of lungs, rather than a heart.\n\nEvents in the game take place in the fictional city of Revachol on the isola of Insulinde, specifically in Martinaise, a district plagued by poverty, crime, and corruption.<ref name=\"PCGUS\" /><ref name=gamerant/> Five decades before the start of the game, a communist revolution took place in Revachol and successfully overthrew the old monarchy that controlled the city. A [[Commune (model of government)|commune]] was formed afterwards, but it was soon toppled by an invasion of an alliance of capitalist nations calling themselves \"the Coalition\". Revachol has since been designated a Special Administrative Region under the Coalition, who holds a strong grip over the city's local economy and keeps its autonomy at a minimum. One of the few governmental functions that Revachol is allowed to handle itself is upholding day to day law and order, which is the task of the Revachol Citizens Militia (RCM). While starting as a voluntary citizens brigade, the RCM has since grown and evolved into a semi-professional police force.\n\n=== Plot ===\n{{plot|date=March 2020}}\nThe player character wakes up in a trashed cafeteria motel room with a severe hangover and no memory of his own identity. He is greeted by a Lieutenant Kim Kitsuragi, who informs him that they have been assigned to investigate the death of a hanged man in the cafeteria's backyard. His identity is unclear and initial investigation indicates that he was [[lynched]] by a group of people. The detectives set out to explore the rest of the district, following up on leads while investigating smaller cases, helping residents with a variety of tasks.\n\nThese tasks allow the player to begin to fill in gaps in the detective\u2019s identity, revealing him to be  Harrier \"Harry\" DuBois. A decorated RCM detective, Harry experienced an event several years ago that began a [[mid-life crisis]], eventually culminating in a self-destructive bender around Martinaise in which he dismissed the rest of his squad. Through their work, they discover the killing appears to be connected to an ongoing strike by the Martinaise\u2019s dockworkers union against the Wild Pines corporation. They seek out representatives of both the dockworkers and the Wild Pines corporation, meeting up with Evrart Claire for more information on the union and Joyce Messier on the involvement of Wild Pines.\n\nThis leads them to discover that the man was killed before the hanging. The Hardie Boys, a group of dockworkers who act as [[Vigilante|vigilantes]] in Martinaise, claim collective responsibility for the murder. They assert that the man attempted to rape a cafeteria guest by the name of Klaasje. Seeking more information on the man, they return to Joyce, who reveals that the hanged man's name was 'Lely' and that he was a member of a mercenary squad assigned to protect Joyce during negotiations with the union. However, the death of Lely has driven them to go rogue. Joyce warns that unless the detectives find the true culprit soon, the mercenaries will likely enact bloody retribution across Martinaise.\n\nThey meet with Klassje for her end of the story who reveals that Lely was shot in the mouth while the two were having sex. Unable to figure out the origin of the bullet and fearful of involving the authorities, Klaasje enlisted the help of a dockworker named Ruby, who with the rest of the Hardie Boys staged Lely's death as a hanging. The detectives then follow the trail across the shore and eventually find Ruby hiding within an abandoned building, where she incapacitates them with a Pale device. She claims that the cover-up was all Klaasje's idea and has no idea who shot Lely. The player manages to resist or disable the Pale device and tries to arrest her. Ruby states that she would rather kill herself, which she does if she is unable to escape.\n\nThe detectives return to find themselves in a standoff between the mercenaries and the Hardie Boys. A firefight breaks out and the player is badly wounded, blacking out and waking up a few days later. Most or all the mercenaries are killed and Kim may be hospitalized, in which case street urchin Cuno offers to take his place. The detectives begin chasing down their last leads, ultimately determining that the shot that killed Lely came from an old sea fort just off the shore of Martinaise.\n\nWhile at the fort, Harry has a dream in which he meets a manifestation of his ex-fianc\u00e9e Dora Ingerlund, who left Harry out of both dissatisfaction at his low income and his mental instability. She then reveals that this is what drove Harry onto his emotional breakdown; he is plagued by this same dream recurring every couple of days, the moment of her leaving him and him trying and failing to win her back and unable to move on from her.\n\nThe detectives explore the rest of the fort and find the shooter: a former Commissar from the old Revachol communist army named Iosef Lilianovich Dros. Iosef's motivations are revealed to be ultimately born out of his bitterness towards the new capitalist system Lely represented, as well as his sexual envy for Klaasje. With all of the evidence now found, the detectives arrest him for the murder. At this point, the Insulindian Phasmid appears from the reeds. The player may be able to have a psychic conversation with the Phasmid, who tells Harry that it finds the notion of his unstable mind to be fearful, but is in awe at his ability to continue existing day after day. It comforts Harry, telling him to move on from the wreck of his life and move forward. After the detectives take its picture, the Phasmid moves on.\n\nHarry and his partner are confronted by his old squad upon their return to Martenaise. They reflect on Harry's actions during the game, whether he has solved the case and how he handled the mercenaries, as well as being impressed by the news that the Phasmid does exist. Harry's former partner Jean Vicquemare confirms that Harry's emotional breakdown was indeed the result of Dora leaving him several years ago. If the player has done well, the squad expresses hope that Harry's state will improve in the future, and invites him and either Kim or Cuno to a special RCM unit.\n\n==Development==\n''Disco Elysium'' was developed by ZA/UM, a company founded in 2016 by [[Karelians|Karelian]]-[[Estonians|Estonian]] novelist [[Robert Kurvitz]], who served as the game's lead writer and designer.<ref name= Gamesindustry>{{cite web |last=Taylor |first=Haydn |date=31 October 2018 |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-10-31-disco-elysium |title=Chasing oblivion with Disco Elysium and alcohol addiction |website=Gamesindustry.biz}}</ref><ref name= Kurvitz>{{cite web |last1=Macgregor |first1=Jody |title=Disco Elysium's lead designer wants to make an expansion and sequel, has already written a novel |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/disco-elysiums-lead-designer-wants-to-make-an-expansion-and-sequel-has-already-written-a-novel/ |website=PC Gamer |accessdate=13 November 2019}}</ref> Kurvitz since 2001 had been part of a band called Ultramelanhool, and in 2005, while in [[Tallinn]], Estonia, with the group struggling for finances, conceived of a fictional world during a drunken evening while listening to [[Ti\u00ebsto]]'s \"[[Adagio for Strings (Ti\u00ebsto song)|Adagio for Strings]]\".<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/the-making-of-disco-elysium-how-zaum-created-one-of-the-most-original-rpgs-of-the-decade/ |title=The making of Disco Elysium: How ZA/UM created one of the most original RPGs of the decade |first=Alex |last=Alex |last=Wiltshire |date=9 January 2020 |accessdate=8 April 2020 |work=[[GamesRadar]]}}</ref> Feeling this had a solid idea, the group created a collective of artists and musicians, which included Aleksander Rostov, to expand upon the work of that night and developed a [[tabletop RPG]] based on ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' on this [[steampunk]]-like concept.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> During this period, Kurvitz met Estonian author [[Kaur Kender]] who helped him to write a novel set in this world, ''Sacred and Terrible Air'',<ref name= Kurvitz/> which was published in 2013 but only sold about one thousand copies. Kurvitz fell into a period of depression and alcoholism for about three years following the book's failing.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/>\n\nKurvitz eventually pulled himself out of his alcoholism, and helped Kender to also surpass his personal period of alcoholism. As a sign of gratitude, Kender suggested to Kurvitz that instead of pursuing a novel that he try capturing his world as a video game instead as to draw a larger interest. Kurvitz had no experience in video games before, but once he had seen artwork of the game's setting of Revachol as easily fitting into an [[isometric RPG|isometric format]], as well as Rostov's agreement that they might as well continue taking the risk of failing on a video game together, Kurvitz proceeded with the idea.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> Kurvitz wrote a concise description of what the game would be: \"AD&D meets '70s cop-show, in an original 'fantastic realist' setting, with swords, guns and motor-cars. Realised as an isometric CRPG \u2013 a modern advancement on the legendary Planescape: Torment and Baldur's Gate. Massive, reactive story. Exploring a vast, poverty-stricken ghetto. Deep, strategic combat.\"<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> Kender was impressed on the strong statement that he invested into the game's development, with additional investment coming from friends and family.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> The game was announced as an upcoming 2017 game under the title ''No Truce With the Furies'',<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> taken from the poem \"Reflections\" by [[R.S. Thomas]] and published in Thomas' ''No Truce with the Furies'' in 1995.<ref name=\"egm title\"/>\n\nKurvitz established the ZA/UM team to create the game, the name \"za um\" which could be read in Russian as either \"for the mind\" or \"from the mind\".<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> Work on the game started around 2016, with the local team working out of a [[Squatting|squat]] in a former gallery in Tallinn. They were able to secure venture capital into the game during that first year which allowed Kurvitz to seek out the band [[British Sea Power]] for their music for the game's soundtrack. While in [[Birmingham]] to speak to the band, Kurvitz realised England was a better location for the main development team as there were more local resources for both development and for voice-overs.<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> During development, some of the staff relocated from Estonia to London and [[Brighton]], with other designers working out of [[Poland]], [[Romania]], and [[China]].<ref name=gamesindustry.biz/><ref name=Postimees>{{cite news |last1=Altk\u00fcla |first1=Magnus |title=Kaur Kender on new computer game: It\u2019s like 'Truth and Justice' |url=https://news.postimees.ee/6807443/kaur-kender-on-new-computer-game-it-s-like-truth-and-justice |publisher=[[Postimees]] |date=22 October 2019 |accessdate=29 December 2019}}</ref> Overall, by the time of the game's release, ZA/UM had about 20 outside consultants and 35 in-house developers,<ref name=\"gamesradar conception\"/> with a team of eight writers assisting Kurvitz in the game's dialog.<ref name=gamesindustry.biz>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-07-20-making-games-under-threat-of-nuclear-war |title=Making games under threat of nuclear war |website=GamesIndustry.biz}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Price |first1=Edward |title=Disco Elysium \u2013 Rezzed 2018 Interview |url=https://gameanalytics.com/blog/disco-elysium-rezzed-2018-interview.html |website=gameanalytics.com |accessdate=19 October 2019}}</ref> The majority of the game's funding was provided by Estonian businessman {{ill|Margus Linnam\u00e4e|et|Margus Linnam\u00e4e}}.<ref name=Postimees/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://raha.geenius.ee/rubriik/uudis/kaur-kenderi-uus-videomanguari-on-neelanud-juba-700-000-eurot-investorite-raha/ |title=Kaur Kenderi uus videom\u00e4ngu\u00e4ri on neelanud juba 700 000 eurot investorite raha |first=Deisi |last=Helem\u00e4e |publisher=Geenius.ee |date=5 September 2018 |lang=Estonian |accessdate=30 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nAs originally planned, the game was to focus on action in a single city location to make the 2017 release.

The reserve's nature conservation headquarters is located here, beside the village of Moremela, at the canyon's southern, or upper reaches.\n\nSustained [[Kolk (vortex)|kolk]]s in the Treur River's [[plunge pool]]s have eroded a number of cylindrical potholes or [[giant's kettle]]s, which can be viewed from the crags above. It was named after a local prospector, Tom Bourke, who predicted the presence of gold, though he found none himself. The [[Footbridge|pedestrian bridges]] connect the various [[overlook]]s of the potholes and the gorge downstream.\n\n==The Three Rondavels==\n[[File:Three Rondavels - panoramio.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The three rondavels]]\nThe Three Rondavels are three round, grass-covered mountain tops with somewhat pointed peaks. They resemble the traditional round or oval [[rondavels]] or African homesteads quite closely, which are made with local materials. Sometimes they are also called the Three Sisters, though this may confuse them with a similar threesome visible from the [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1 road]] in the [[Northern Cape]], very far to the south.<ref name=SA-Venues>{{cite web | url=http://www.sa-venues.com/attractionsmpl/three-rondavels.htm | title=Three Rondavels | publisher=SA-Venues | accessdate=31 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe names of the peaks commemorate a 19th century chief, Maripi, and three of his wives. The flat-topped peak adjacent to the rondavels is Mapjaneng, \"the chief\", who is remembered for opposing invading [[Swazis]] in a memorable battle. The three rondavels are named for three of his more troublesome wives \u2013 Magabolle, Mogoladikwe and Maseroto. Behind the rondavels the distant high plateau of [[Mariepskop]] may be visible. Beside the dam, the isolated Thabaneng hill is known as the \"sundial\" or \"mountain with a shadow that moves\". It is said that the position of its shadow indicates the time of day.<ref name=\"rowe\">{{cite web |last1=Rowe |first1=Christine |title=Heritage management of archaeological, historical and industrial resources on the Blyde River Canyon Nature Reserve |url=http://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/27115/dissertation.pdf |website=repository.up.ac.za |publisher=[[University of Pretoria]] |accessdate=20 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn a clear day the lookout point provides extensive views. From here one looks over the canyon to the Three Rondavels on the other side, which is flanked on various sides by promontories of the northern [[Drakensberg]] range.<ref name=SA-Venues/>\n\nThe formation of the attractive sedimentary formations are explained geologically as the slow erosion of underlying soft stone, leaving the exposed the more resistant quartzite and shale rondavels.\n\n==God's Window==\n[[File:South Africa-Mpumalanga-Gods Window002.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A southward view from God's Window towards [[Kowyn Pass]]]]\nGod\u2019s Window <small>{{coord|24|52|28|S|30|53|29|E| type:landmark_region:ZA | display=inline | name=God's Window}}</small> is a popular vantage point along the [[Drakensberg]] [[escarpment]], at the southern extremity of the Nature Reserve.\n\nHere, sheer cliffs plunge over 700 metres to the [[lowveld]]. From this escarpment&mdash;a mostly unbroken rampart of cliffs&mdash;opens a vista into the lowvelt expanse and escarpment forests, the [[Garden of Eden|Eden]]-like aesthetic appearance of which prompted the name. On a clear day it is possible to see over the [[Kruger National Park]] towards the [[Lebombo Mountains]] on the border with [[Mozambique]].\n\nGod\u2019s Window features prominently in the plot of the 1980 [[cult film]] ''[[The Gods Must Be Crazy]]''. Near the end of the movie, the [[Bushmen|Bushman]] character Xi (played by [[Namibia]]n bush farmer [[N!xau]]) travels to God\u2019s Window, and due to some low-lying cloud cover believes it to be the end of the Earth.\n\nThe original Window is a rock that is set further back on a private farm and due to Quarry operations and tree plantation farming this actual rock that looks like a square window could not be used, therefore the site was moved by the government to the edge of the escarpment.\n\nA viewing platform <small>{{coord|24|52|35.8|S|30|53|19.6|E| type:landmark_region:ZA | display=inline | name=God's Window viewing platform}}</small> near the car park gives extensive views down the gorge to the plain below.\n\n==Fauna==\nThe high plateaus are inhabited by [[mountain reedbuck]], [[Chacma baboon|baboon]] troops and [[rock hyrax]]es.

The [[Footbridge|pedestrian bridges]] connect the various [[overlook]]s of the potholes and the gorge downstream.\n\n==The Three Rondavels==\n[[File:Three Rondavels - panoramio.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The three rondavels]]\nThe Three Rondavels are three round, grass-covered mountain tops with somewhat pointed peaks. They resemble the traditional round or oval [[rondavels]] or African homesteads quite closely, which are made with local materials. Sometimes they are also called the Three Sisters, though this may confuse them with a similar threesome visible from the [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1 road]] in the [[Northern Cape]], very far to the south.<ref name=SA-Venues>{{cite web | url=http://www.sa-venues.com/attractionsmpl/three-rondavels.htm | title=Three Rondavels | publisher=SA-Venues | accessdate=31 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe names of the peaks commemorate a 19th century chief, Maripi, and three of his wives. The flat-topped peak adjacent to the rondavels is Mapjaneng, \"the chief\", who is remembered for opposing invading [[Swazis]] in a memorable battle. The three rondavels are named for three of his more troublesome wives \u2013 Magabolle, Mogoladikwe and Maseroto. Behind the rondavels the distant high plateau of [[Mariepskop]] may be visible. Beside the dam, the isolated Thabaneng hill is known as the \"sundial\" or \"mountain with a shadow that moves\". It is said that the position of its shadow indicates the time of day.<ref name=\"rowe\">{{cite web |last1=Rowe |first1=Christine |title=Heritage management of archaeological, historical and industrial resources on the Blyde River Canyon Nature Reserve |url=http://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/27115/dissertation.pdf |website=repository.up.ac.za |publisher=[[University of Pretoria]] |accessdate=20 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn a clear day the lookout point provides extensive views. From here one looks over the canyon to the Three Rondavels on the other side, which is flanked on various sides by promontories of the northern [[Drakensberg]] range.<ref name=SA-Venues/>\n\nThe formation of the attractive sedimentary formations are explained geologically as the slow erosion of underlying soft stone, leaving the exposed the more resistant quartzite and shale rondavels.\n\n==God's Window==\n[[File:South Africa-Mpumalanga-Gods Window002.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A southward view from God's Window towards [[Kowyn Pass]]]]\nGod\u2019s Window <small>{{coord|24|52|28|S|30|53|29|E| type:landmark_region:ZA | display=inline | name=God's Window}}</small> is a popular vantage point along the [[Drakensberg]] [[escarpment]], at the southern extremity of the Nature Reserve.\n\nHere, sheer cliffs plunge over 700 metres to the [[lowveld]]. From this escarpment&mdash;a mostly unbroken rampart of cliffs&mdash;opens a vista into the lowvelt expanse and escarpment forests, the [[Garden of Eden|Eden]]-like aesthetic appearance of which prompted the name. On a clear day it is possible to see over the [[Kruger National Park]] towards the [[Lebombo Mountains]] on the border with [[Mozambique]].\n\nGod\u2019s Window features prominently in the plot of the 1980 [[cult film]] ''[[The Gods Must Be Crazy]]''. Near the end of the movie, the [[Bushmen|Bushman]] character Xi (played by [[Namibia]]n bush farmer [[N!xau]]) travels to God\u2019s Window, and due to some low-lying cloud cover believes it to be the end of the Earth.\n\nThe original Window is a rock that is set further back on a private farm and due to Quarry operations and tree plantation farming this actual rock that looks like a square window could not be used, therefore the site was moved by the government to the edge of the escarpment.\n\nA viewing platform <small>{{coord|24|52|35.8|S|30|53|19.6|E| type:landmark_region:ZA | display=inline | name=God's Window viewing platform}}</small> near the car park gives extensive views down the gorge to the plain below.\n\n==Fauna==\nThe high plateaus are inhabited by [[mountain reedbuck]], [[Chacma baboon|baboon]] troops and [[rock hyrax]]es.

Angiotensin II is a potent direct vasoconstrictor and a stimulator of aldosterone release. Reduction in the amount of angiotensin II results in relaxation of the arterioles.

Adding [[lysine]] at one end of the drug turned out to have  strong activity and was orally available; analogs of that compound resulted in lisinopril, which takes its name from the discovery with lysine.  Merck conducted clinical trials, and the drug was approved for hypertension in 1987 and congestive heart failure in 1993.<ref name=Menard />\n\nThe discovery posed a problem, since sales of enalapril were strong for Merck, and the company did not want to diminish those sales. Merck ended up entering into an agreement with [[Zeneca]] under which Zeneca received the right to co-market lisinopril, and Merck received the exclusive rights to an earlier stage [[aldose reductase inhibitor]] drug candidate, a potential treatment for diabetes.  Zeneca's marketing and brand name, \"Zestril\", turned out to be stronger than Merck's effort.<ref>David R. Glover. ''Vie D'or: Memoirs of a Pharmaceutical Physician''.

Angiotensin II is a potent direct vasoconstrictor and a stimulator of aldosterone release. Reduction in the amount of angiotensin II results in relaxation of the arterioles. Reduction in the amount of angiotensin II also reduces the release of [[aldosterone]] from the adrenal cortex, which allows the kidney to excrete sodium along with water into the urine, and increases retention of potassium ions.<ref name=\":1\" /> Specifically, this process occurs in the [[peritubular capillaries]] of the kidneys in response to a change in [[Starling forces]].<ref name=\"ReddiBook\">{{cite book |last1=Reddi |first1=Alluru |title=Fluid, Electrolyte and Acid-Base Disorders |date=2018 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-60167-0 |chapter=Disorders of ECF Volume: Nephrotic Syndrome}}</ref> The inhibition of the RAAS system causes an overall decrease in blood pressure.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Pharmacokinetics ===\n====Absorption====\nLisinopril has a poor [[bioavailability]] of ~25% (reduced to 16% in people with [[New York Heart Association Functional Classification|NYHA]] Class II-IV heart failure).<ref name=Label /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title = Basic and Clinical Pharmacology|last = Katzung|first = Bertram|publisher = McGraw Hill|year = 2012|isbn = 978-0-07-176401-8|location = New York City, New York|pages = 175, 184\u201385}}</ref> Its time to peak concentration is 7 hours.<ref name=Label /><ref name=\":1\"/> The peak effect of lisinopril is about 4 to 8 hours after administration.<ref name=\"KhanBook2015\" /> Food does not affect its absorption.<ref name=\"KhanBook2015\" />\n\n====Distribution====\nLisinopril does not bind to proteins in the blood.<ref name=Label /><ref name=\":1\"/> It does not distribute as well in people with NYHA Class II\u2013IV heart failure.<ref name=Label /><ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n====Metabolism====\nLisinopril is the only water-soluble member of the ACE inhibitor class, with no [[Liver#Breakdown|metabolism by the liver]].<ref name=\"KhanBook2015\" />\n\n====Elimination====\nLisinopril leaves the body completely unchanged in the urine.<ref name=Label /><ref name=\":1\"/> The [[half-life]] of lisinopril is 12 hours, and is increased in people with kidney problems.<ref name=Label /><ref name=\":1\"/> While the plasma half-life of lisinopril has been estimated between 12\u201313 hours, the elimination half-life is much longer, at around 30 hours.<ref name=\"KhanBook2015\">{{cite book |last1=Khan |first1=M.

Adding [[lysine]] at one end of the drug turned out to have  strong activity and was orally available; analogs of that compound resulted in lisinopril, which takes its name from the discovery with lysine.  Merck conducted clinical trials, and the drug was approved for hypertension in 1987 and congestive heart failure in 1993.<ref name=Menard />\n\nThe discovery posed a problem, since sales of enalapril were strong for Merck, and the company did not want to diminish those sales. Merck ended up entering into an agreement with [[Zeneca]] under which Zeneca received the right to co-market lisinopril, and Merck received the exclusive rights to an earlier stage [[aldose reductase inhibitor]] drug candidate, a potential treatment for diabetes.  Zeneca's marketing and brand name, \"Zestril\", turned out to be stronger than Merck's effort.<ref>David R. Glover. ''Vie D'or: Memoirs of a Pharmaceutical Physician''.

The long whip is 5-6 feet long and made from palm stems tied together with either [[rattan]] or strips of [[water buffalo]] hide. The stick is an undecorated piece of hardwood measuring 1-1.5 yards long and 2 inches in diameter. \n\nThe shield is of round or elliptical shape. Also traditionally undecorated, it is known as ''giling'' or ''nggiling'' when made of buffalo hide and ''perisai kayu'' when made of wood.

The attacker is permitted three blows to any part of the anatomy, while the defender attempts to block with his shield. The defender is not allowed to attack while defending, but in the case of whip-fighting the defender may spin the whip above his head to prevent the attacker from closing in. Stick techniques are all swings without any thrusting.\n\nSuffering a hit in the face or on the head means instantly losing the game. While a hit on the back is considered as a good strike, and believed as a sign that next year's harvest will be plentiful.<ref name=\"Flores\"/> The roles of attacker and defender are reversed in turns after each whip strikes.

All but two of his singles from the mid-1998 \"[[That's Why I'm Here (song)|That's Why I'm Here]]\" onwards have charted on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] as well, with twenty-six of his singles peaking inside the Top 40. \"[[Out Last Night]]\" (2009) is his highest peak on that chart at number 16.\n\nChesney also charted in the Top 10 in mid-2004 as a guest artist on the collaboration \"[[Hey, Good Lookin' (song)|Hey, Good Lookin']]\". He has also reached the lower regions of the [[Hot Country Songs]] with multiple album cuts, including two charity singles in 1998 and seven cuts from his Christmas album ''[[All I Want for Christmas Is a Real Good Tan]]'' (including the number 30 title track).\n\n==Studio albums==\n===1990s albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
