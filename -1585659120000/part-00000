From the age of 16, she was mainly resident in England, where she was sent for her education.

Her father, William Rees Williams, was a Welsh doctor and her mother, Minna Williams, n\u00e9e Lockhart, was a third-generation Dominican [[Creole peoples#Caribbean|Creole]] of Scots ancestry. (\"Creole\" was broadly used in those times to refer to any person born on the island, whether they were of European or African descent, or both.) She had a brother. Her mother's family had an estate, a former plantation, on the island.\n\nRhys was educated in Dominica until the age of 16, when she was sent to England to live with an aunt, as her relations with her mother were difficult. She attended the [[Perse School for Girls]] in Cambridge,<ref name=\"carr\" /> where she was mocked as an outsider and for her accent. She attended two terms at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] in London by 1909. Her instructors despaired of her ever learning to speak \"proper English\" and advised her father to take her away. Unable to train as an actress and refusing to return to the Caribbean as her parents wished, Williams worked with varied success as a [[chorus girl]], adopting the names Vivienne, Emma or Ella Gray.

He was the first of her three husbands.<ref name=\"carr\"/> She and Lenglet wandered through Europe. They had two children, a son who died young and a daughter. They divorced in 1933, and her daughter lived mostly with her father.\n\nThe next year Rhys married Leslie Tilden-Smith, an English editor. In 1930 they went briefly to Dominica, the first time Rhys had returned since she had left for school. She found her family estate deteriorating and island conditions less agreeable. Her brother Oscar was living in England, and she took care of some financial affairs for him, making a settlement with an island [[mixed-race]] woman and Oscar's illegitimate children by her.\n\nIn 1937 Rhys began a friendship with novelist [[Eliot Bliss]] (who had taken her first name in honour of two authors she admired). The two women shared Caribbean backgrounds.

In 1947 Rhys married Max Hamer, a solicitor who was a cousin of Tilden-Smith.

After meeting Ford in Paris, Rhys wrote short stories under his patronage. Ford recognised that her experience as an exile gave Rhys a unique viewpoint, and praised her \"singular instinct for form\". \"Coming from the [[West Indies]], [Ford] declared, 'with a terrifying insight and... passion for stating the case of the underdog, she has let her pen loose on the Left Banks of the Old World'.\"<ref name=\"carr\"/> This he wrote in his preface to her debut short story collection, [[The Left Bank and Other Stories|''The Left Bank and Other Stories'']] (1927).\n\nIt was Ford who suggested she change her name from Ella Williams to Jean Rhys.<ref name=\"Owen, Katie 2000\">Owen, Katie, \"Introduction\", ''Quartet'', Penguin Modern Classics edition, Penguin, 2000, p. vi. {{ISBN|978-0-14-118392-3}}</ref> At the time her husband was in jail for what Rhys described as currency irregularities.\n\nRhys moved in with Ford and his long-time partner, [[Stella Bowen]]. An affair with Ford ensued, which she portrayed in fictionalised form in her novel ''[[Quartet (Jean Rhys novel)|Quartet]]'' (1928)<ref name=\"Owen, Katie 2000\" /> Her protagonist is a stranded foreigner, Marya Zelli, who finds herself at the mercy of strangers when her husband is jailed in Paris. ''Quartet's'' 1981 [[Merchant Ivory Productions|Merchant Ivory film]] adaptation starred [[Maggie Smith]], [[Isabelle Adjani]], [[Anthony Higgins (actor)|Anthony Higgins]], and [[Alan Bates]]. \n\nIn ''[[After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie]]'' (1931), the protagonist, Julia Martin, is a more unravelled version of Marya Zelli, romantically dumped and inhabiting the sidewalks, cafes and cheap hotel rooms of Paris.\n\nWith ''[[Voyage in the Dark]]'' (1934), Rhys continued to portray a mistreated, rootless woman. Here the narrator, Anna, is a young chorus girl who grew up in the West Indies and feels alienated in England. \n\n''[[Good Morning, Midnight (Rhys novel)|Good Morning, Midnight]]'' (1939) is often considered a continuation of Rhys's first two novels. Here she uses modified [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] to voice the experiences of an ageing woman, Sasha Jansen, who drinks, takes sleeping pills and obsesses over her looks, and is adrift again in Paris. [[Good Morning, Midnight (Rhys novel)|''Good Morning, Midnight'']], acknowledged as well written but deemed depressing, came as [[World War II]] broke out and readers sought optimism. This seemingly ended Rhys's literary career. \n\nIn the 1940s Rhys largely withdrew from public life. From 1955 to 1960 she lived in [[Bude]], Cornwall, where she was unhappy, calling it \"Bude the Obscure\", before moving to [[Cheriton Fitzpaine]] in Devon.\n\nAfter a long absence from the public eye she was rediscovered by [[Selma Vaz Dias]], who in 1949 placed an advertisement in the [[New Statesman]] asking about her whereabouts, with a view to obtaining the rights to adapt her novel [[Good_Morning,_Midnight_(Rhys_novel)|''Good Morning Midnight'']] for radio. Rhys responded, and thereafter developed a long-lasting and collaborative friendship with Vaz Dias, who encouraged her to start writing again. This encouragement ultimately led to the publication in 1966 of her critically acclaimed novel ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea]]''. She intended it as an account of the woman whom Rochester married and kept in his attic in ''[[Jane Eyre]]''. Begun well before she settled in Bude, the book won the notable [[WH Smith Literary Award]] in 1967. She returned to themes of dominance and dependence, especially in marriage, depicting the mutually painful relationship between a privileged English man and a Creole woman from Dominica made powerless on being duped and coerced by him and others. Both the man and the woman enter marriage under mistaken assumptions about the other partner. Her female lead marries Mr Rochester and deteriorates in England as the \"madwoman in the attic\". Rhys portrays this woman from a quite different perspective from the one in ''Jane Eyre''. [[Diana Athill]] of [[Andr\u00e9 Deutsch]] gambled on publishing ''Wide Sargasso Sea''. She and the writer [[Francis Wyndham (Writer)|Francis Wyndham]] helped to revive interest in Rhys's work.<ref name=Penguin>Preliminary page in Jean Rhys, ''Quartet'', Penguin: 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-14-118392-3}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968 [[Andr\u00e9 Deutsch]] published a collection of Rhys's short stories, ''[[Tigers Are Better-Looking]]'', of which eight were written during her 1950s period of obscurity and nine republished from her 1927 collection ''[[The Left Bank and Other Stories]]''. In 1976 [[Andr\u00e9 Deutsch]] published another collection of her short stories, ''[[Sleep It Off Lady]]'', consisting of 16 pieces from an approximately 75-year period, starting from the end of the 19th century.\n\n==Later years==\nFrom 1960, and for the rest of her life, Rhys lived in [[Cheriton Fitzpaine]], a small village in Devon that she once described as \"a dull spot which even drink can't enliven much.\"<ref>[http://www.exeterexpressandecho.co.uk/Villagers-reject-dull-spot-jibe/story-11826347-detail/story.html \"Villagers Reject 'Dull Spot' Jibe\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121084752/http://www.exeterexpressandecho.co.uk/Villagers-reject-dull-spot-jibe/story-11826347-detail/story.html |date=21 November 2015}}, ''Exeter Express & Echo'', 11 February 2010.</ref> Characteristically, she remained unimpressed by her belated ascent to literary fame, commenting, \"It has come too late.\"<ref name=Penguin /> In an interview shortly before her death she questioned whether any novelist, not least herself, could ever be happy for any length of time: \"If I could choose I would rather be happy than write... if I could live my life all over again, and choose....\"<ref>''In Their Own Words: British Novelists.

He was convicted of fraud and imprisoned after their marriage.<ref>[http://readingdetectives.org/kent/2009/10/from-maidstone-prison-to-the-wide-sargasso-sea.html \"Kent: From Maidstone Prison to the Wide Sargasso Sea!\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002910/http://readingdetectives.org/kent/2009/10/from-maidstone-prison-to-the-wide-sargasso-sea.html |date= 3 December 2013}}, Reading Detectives.</ref> He died in 1966.\n\n==Writing career==\nIn 1924 Rhys came under the influence of English writer [[Ford Madox Ford]]. After meeting Ford in Paris, Rhys wrote short stories under his patronage. Ford recognised that her experience as an exile gave Rhys a unique viewpoint, and praised her \"singular instinct for form\". \"Coming from the [[West Indies]], [Ford] declared, 'with a terrifying insight and... passion for stating the case of the underdog, she has let her pen loose on the Left Banks of the Old World'.\"<ref name=\"carr\"/> This he wrote in his preface to her debut short story collection, [[The Left Bank and Other Stories|''The Left Bank and Other Stories'']] (1927).\n\nIt was Ford who suggested she change her name from Ella Williams to Jean Rhys.<ref name=\"Owen, Katie 2000\">Owen, Katie, \"Introduction\", ''Quartet'', Penguin Modern Classics edition, Penguin, 2000, p. vi. {{ISBN|978-0-14-118392-3}}</ref> At the time her husband was in jail for what Rhys described as currency irregularities.\n\nRhys moved in with Ford and his long-time partner, [[Stella Bowen]]. An affair with Ford ensued, which she portrayed in fictionalised form in her novel ''[[Quartet (Jean Rhys novel)|Quartet]]'' (1928)<ref name=\"Owen, Katie 2000\" /> Her protagonist is a stranded foreigner, Marya Zelli, who finds herself at the mercy of strangers when her husband is jailed in Paris. ''Quartet's'' 1981 [[Merchant Ivory Productions|Merchant Ivory film]] adaptation starred [[Maggie Smith]], [[Isabelle Adjani]], [[Anthony Higgins (actor)|Anthony Higgins]], and [[Alan Bates]]. \n\nIn ''[[After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie]]'' (1931), the protagonist, Julia Martin, is a more unravelled version of Marya Zelli, romantically dumped and inhabiting the sidewalks, cafes and cheap hotel rooms of Paris.\n\nWith ''[[Voyage in the Dark]]'' (1934), Rhys continued to portray a mistreated, rootless woman. Here the narrator, Anna, is a young chorus girl who grew up in the West Indies and feels alienated in England. \n\n''[[Good Morning, Midnight (Rhys novel)|Good Morning, Midnight]]'' (1939) is often considered a continuation of Rhys's first two novels. Here she uses modified [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] to voice the experiences of an ageing woman, Sasha Jansen, who drinks, takes sleeping pills and obsesses over her looks, and is adrift again in Paris. [[Good Morning, Midnight (Rhys novel)|''Good Morning, Midnight'']], acknowledged as well written but deemed depressing, came as [[World War II]] broke out and readers sought optimism. This seemingly ended Rhys's literary career. \n\nIn the 1940s Rhys largely withdrew from public life. From 1955 to 1960 she lived in [[Bude]], Cornwall, where she was unhappy, calling it \"Bude the Obscure\", before moving to [[Cheriton Fitzpaine]] in Devon.\n\nAfter a long absence from the public eye she was rediscovered by [[Selma Vaz Dias]], who in 1949 placed an advertisement in the [[New Statesman]] asking about her whereabouts, with a view to obtaining the rights to adapt her novel [[Good_Morning,_Midnight_(Rhys_novel)|''Good Morning Midnight'']] for radio. Rhys responded, and thereafter developed a long-lasting and collaborative friendship with Vaz Dias, who encouraged her to start writing again. This encouragement ultimately led to the publication in 1966 of her critically acclaimed novel ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea]]''. She intended it as an account of the woman whom Rochester married and kept in his attic in ''[[Jane Eyre]]''. Begun well before she settled in Bude, the book won the notable [[WH Smith Literary Award]] in 1967. She returned to themes of dominance and dependence, especially in marriage, depicting the mutually painful relationship between a privileged English man and a Creole woman from Dominica made powerless on being duped and coerced by him and others. Both the man and the woman enter marriage under mistaken assumptions about the other partner. Her female lead marries Mr Rochester and deteriorates in England as the \"madwoman in the attic\". Rhys portrays this woman from a quite different perspective from the one in ''Jane Eyre''. [[Diana Athill]] of [[Andr\u00e9 Deutsch]] gambled on publishing ''Wide Sargasso Sea''. She and the writer [[Francis Wyndham (Writer)|Francis Wyndham]] helped to revive interest in Rhys's work.<ref name=Penguin>Preliminary page in Jean Rhys, ''Quartet'', Penguin: 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-14-118392-3}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968 [[Andr\u00e9 Deutsch]] published a collection of Rhys's short stories, ''[[Tigers Are Better-Looking]]'', of which eight were written during her 1950s period of obscurity and nine republished from her 1927 collection ''[[The Left Bank and Other Stories]]''. In 1976 [[Andr\u00e9 Deutsch]] published another collection of her short stories, ''[[Sleep It Off Lady]]'', consisting of 16 pieces from an approximately 75-year period, starting from the end of the 19th century.\n\n==Later years==\nFrom 1960, and for the rest of her life, Rhys lived in [[Cheriton Fitzpaine]], a small village in Devon that she once described as \"a dull spot which even drink can't enliven much.\"<ref>[http://www.exeterexpressandecho.co.uk/Villagers-reject-dull-spot-jibe/story-11826347-detail/story.html \"Villagers Reject 'Dull Spot' Jibe\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121084752/http://www.exeterexpressandecho.co.uk/Villagers-reject-dull-spot-jibe/story-11826347-detail/story.html |date=21 November 2015}}, ''Exeter Express & Echo'', 11 February 2010.</ref> She\ncharacteristically remained unimpressed by her belated ascent to literary fame, commenting, \"It has come too late.\"<ref name=Penguin /> In an interview shortly before her death she questioned whether any novelist, not least herself, could ever be happy for any length of time: \"If I could choose I would rather be happy than write... if I could live my life all over again, and choose...\".<ref>''In Their Own Words: British Novelists.

It was the 21st&nbsp;[[FIFA World Cup]], a worldwide football tournament held once every four years. It was the 11th&nbsp;time the championships had been held in Europe, and the first time they were held in [[Eastern Europe]]. At an estimated cost of over $14.2&nbsp;billion, it was the most expensive World Cup to date.\n\nThe finals involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying competitions]], while as the host nation [[Russia national football team|Russia]] qualified automatically. Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 event]], while both [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] and [[Panama national football team|Panama]] made their first appearances at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. [[Germany national football team|Germany]], the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage. Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals. In the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], [[France national football team|France]] played [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] on 15&nbsp;July at the [[Luzhniki Stadium]] in [[Moscow]]. France won the match 4\u20132 to claim their second World Cup.\n\nThe event featured a number of accolades. Croatian player [[Luka Modri\u0107]] was voted the tournament's best player winning the Golden Ball. England's [[Harry Kane]] scored the most goals during the tournament with six. [[Thibaut Courtois]] won the Golden Glove awarded to the [[goalkeeper]] with the most [[clean sheet]]s. The event was praised for the quality of football but criticised for being a distraction from [[Doping in Russia|doping allegations]] and public relations within Russia. It has been estimated that more than three million people attended games during the tournament.\n\n==Host selection==\n{{Main|Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup bid}}\n[[File:Russia 2018 World Cup.jpeg|thumb|Russian bid personnel celebrate the awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia on 2 December 2010.]]\n[[File:Vladimir Putin FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour kick-off ceremony.jpg|thumb|President [[Vladimir Putin]] holding the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy]] at a pre-tournament ceremony in Moscow on 9&nbsp;September 2017]]\n[[File:Russia 100 Rubles 2018 FIFA World Cup.jpg|thumb|upright|The 100-[[Russian ruble|ruble]] commemorative banknote celebrates the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

/>\n\nVAR operations for all games were operated from a single headquarters in Moscow, which received live video of the games and were in radio contact with the on-field referees.<ref name=\":0\" /> Systems were in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums' large screens were used for the fans in attendance.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nVAR had a significant impact on several games.<ref name=\"nh0b0\" /> On 15&nbsp;June 2018, [[Diego Costa]]'s goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision;<ref name=\"isPIb\" /> the first

name=\"neijv\" /> FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.<ref name=\"swBxZ\" />\n\n==Venues==\nRussia proposed the following host cities: [[Kaliningrad]], [[Kazan]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Moscow]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Rostov-on-Don]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Samara]], [[Saransk]], [[Sochi]], [[Volgograd]], [[Yaroslavl]], and [[Yekaterinburg]].<ref name=\"b9r6N\" /> Every city was located in [[European Russia]], except [[Yekaterinburg]],<ref name=\"S3sSt\" /> which is located very close to the Europe-Asia border, to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country. The bid evaluation report stated: \"The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA's minimum requirement. Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.\"<ref name=\"Z1hqZ\" />\n\nIn October 2011, Russia decreased the number of stadiums from 16 to 14. Construction of the proposed [[Podolsk]] stadium in the Moscow region was cancelled by the regional government, and also in the capital, [[Otkritie Arena]] was competing with [[VTB Arena|Dynamo Stadium]] over which would be constructed first.<ref name=\"8DESn\" />\n\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29 September 2012. The number of cities was further reduced to 11 and number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list. Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, 3 (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) have been extensively renovated and the other 9 stadiums to be used are brand new; $11.8&nbsp;billion has been spent on hosting the tournament.<ref name=\"VKrDx\" />\n\nSepp Blatter stated in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.<ref name=\"Sy4OR\" /> He also said, \"We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums [[2010 FIFA World Cup|in South Africa]], where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums\".<ref name=\"saakov\" />\n[[File:EstadioCentral2017-01-26.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the Yekaterinburg Central Stadium in January 2017]] \nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA's inspection committee and its head Chris Unger visited St Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues. They were satisfied with the progress.<ref name=\"u01d8\" /> On 8 October 2015, FIFA and the Local Organising Committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums used during the tournament.<ref name=\"AL037\" /> Of the twelve venues used, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium \u2013 the two largest stadiums in Russia \u2013 were used most, both hosting seven matches. Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara all hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Spartak Stadium in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each. Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg and Saransk all hosted four matches, but did not host any knockout stage games.\n\n===Stadiums===\n[[File:Bel-Tun (26).jpg|thumb|Exterior of Otkrytie Arena in Moscow]]\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup.

Eckert's summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.<ref name=\"APfire\" /> Garcia criticised the summary as being \"materially incomplete\" with \"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\", and appealed to FIFA's Appeal Committee.<ref name=\"K7Ghy\" /><ref name=\"WhatNow\" /> The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned in protest of FIFA's conduct, citing a \"lack of leadership\" and lack of confidence in the independence of Eckert.<ref name=\"0U57X\" />\n\nOn 3 June 2015, the [[FBI]] confirmed that the federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022 World Cups]].<ref name=\"r8Bz2\" /><ref name=\"lgRB1\" /> In an interview published on 7 June 2015, [[Domenico Scala (manager)|Domenico Scala]], the head of FIFA's Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that \"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled\".<ref name=\"BBC News\" /><ref name=\"Owen Gibson\" /> [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] and former British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president [[Chung Mong-joon]] in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in [[England 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|England]] was discussed.<ref name=\"SNVa0\" /><ref name=\"oJlN3\" />\n\n===Response to Skripal poisoning===\nIn response to the March 2018 [[poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal]], British Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans.<ref name=\"AypwF\" /> Iceland diplomatically boycotted the World Cup.<ref name=\"1CS7B\" /> Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that \"the west are trying to deny Russia the World Cup\".<ref name=\"aXQLQ\" /> The [[Russian Foreign Ministry]] denounced [[Boris Johnson]]'s statements that compared the event to the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]] held in [[Nazi Germany]] as \"poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness\" and \"unacceptable and unworthy\" parallel towards Russia, a \"nation that [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism]]\".<ref name=\"0aw0J\" />\n\nThe British [[Foreign Office]] and MPs had repeatedly warned English football fans and \"people of Asian or Afro-Caribbean descent\" travelling to Russia of \"racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility\".<ref name=\"qKSXy\" /><ref name=\"WNLwc\" /> English football fans who have travelled have said they have received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.<ref name=\"sOFhm\" /><ref name=\"XWjIW\" />\n\n==Critical reception==\n[[File:2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony (2018-06-14) 11.jpg|thumb|Russia received widespread praise as World Cup hosts. Facilities\u2014such as the refurbished [[Luzhniki Stadium]] (pictured)\u2014were one aspect of Russia's success.]]\nAt the close of the World Cup Russia was widely praised for its success in hosting the tournament, with Steve Rosenberg of the [[BBC]] deeming it \"a resounding public relations success\" for Putin, adding, \"The stunning new stadiums, free train travel to venues and the absence of crowd violence has impressed visiting supporters. Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country's authoritarian image. All the foreign fans I have spoken to are pleasantly surprised.\"<ref name=\"91I71\" />\n\nFIFA President [[Gianni Infantino]] stated, \"Everyone discovered a beautiful country, a welcoming country, that is keen to show the world that everything that has been said before might not be true. A lot of preconceived ideas have been changed because people have seen the true nature of Russia.\"<ref name=\"kVyG9\" /> Infantino has proclaimed Russia 2018 to be \"the best World Cup ever\", as 98% of the stadiums were sold out, there were three billion viewers on TV all around the world and 7 million fans visited the fan fests.<ref name=\"kl1QG\" />\n\nHowever, the tournament was called a distraction from the international isolation and economic difficulties Russia has been facing.<ref name=\"FhofV\" /><ref name=\"ve3Sg\" /><ref name=\"M6MSu\" />\n\n==Broadcasting rights==\n{{Main|2018 FIFA World Cup broadcasting rights}}\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters. After having tested the technology at limited matches of the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]],<ref name=\"wPguj\" /> and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]),<ref name=\"kVsNi\" /> the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra-high-definition television|ultra high definition]]. Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut on each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being upconverted from [[1080p]] high definition sources with limited degradation in quality. These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.<ref name=\"TCu23\" /><ref name=\"0j6eE\" /><ref name=\"6j06c\" />\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder [[UA:PBC]] stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup. This came in the wake of growing boycotts of the tournament among the [[Football Federation of Ukraine]] and sports minister [[Ihor Zhdanov]].<ref name=\"Xv82A\" /><ref name=\"0gvp3\" /> Additionally, the Football Federation of Ukraine refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.<ref name=\"MLa57\" /> However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.<ref name=\"YqvyD\" />\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing [[2017\u201318 Qatar diplomatic crisis|diplomatic crisis in Qatar]], which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar\u2014the home country of FIFA's Middle East and Africa rightsholder [[beIN Sports]]\u2014in June 2017, over its [[Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism|alleged state support of terrorist groups]]. On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from [[Du (company)|Du]] and [[Etisalat]], but with service to the latter restored later that day. Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.<ref name=\"y5Kr4\" /><ref name=\"mvmPW\" /><ref name=\"jyl42\" /> In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as \"[[beoutQ]]\". While FIFA attempted to indirectly negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final, they were unable to do so. On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had \"engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.\"<ref name=\"NIzbW\" /><ref name=\"6N9LV\" />\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men's World Cup whose English rights were held by [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]], and Spanish rights held by [[Telemundo Deportes|Telemundo]]. The elimination of the United States in qualifying led to concerns that US interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that \"casual\" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5&nbsp;million viewers in 2014, and how much Fox paid for the rights. During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]. Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of coverage for the tournament.<ref name=\"lJrJH\" /><ref name=\"Oo1hn\" /><ref name=\"1M4WS\" /> Viewership was down overall over 2014, additionally citing match scheduling that was not as favourable to viewers in the Americas than 2014 (with many matches airing in the morning hours, although Telemundo's broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday [[Daytime television|daytime]] program in network history).<ref name=\"wx1ZL\" /><ref name=\"UFMpG\" />\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, [[Korean Central Television]] acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea. Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time. In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to [[Japan\u2013North Korea relations|strained relations and campaigns against the country]].<ref name=\"iscoP\"

football|football]] tournament contested by [[List of men's national association football teams|men's national teams]] and took place between 14&nbsp;June and 15&nbsp;July 2018 in Russia. It was the 21st&nbsp;[[FIFA World Cup]], a worldwide football tournament held once every four years. It was the 11th&nbsp;time the championships had been held in Europe, and the first time they were held in [[Eastern Europe]]. At an estimated cost of over $14.2&nbsp;billion, it was the most expensive World Cup to date.\n\nThe finals involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying competitions]], while as the host nation [[Russia national football team|Russia]] qualified automatically. Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 event]], while both [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] and [[Panama national football team|Panama]] made their first appearances at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. [[Germany national football team|Germany]], the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage. Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals. In the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], [[France national football team|France]] played [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] on 15&nbsp;July at the [[Luzhniki Stadium]] in [[Moscow]]. France won the match 4\u20132 to claim their second World Cup.\n\nThe event featured a number of accolades. Croatian player [[Luka Modri\u0107]] was voted the tournament's best player winning the Golden Ball. England's [[Harry Kane]] scored the most goals during the tournament with six. [[Thibaut Courtois]] won the Golden Glove awarded to the [[goalkeeper]] with the most [[clean sheet]]s. The event was praised for the quality of football but criticised for being a distraction from [[Doping in Russia|doping allegations]] and public relations within Russia. It has been estimated that more than three million people attended games during the tournament.\n\n==Host selection==\n{{Main|Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup bid}}\n[[File:Russia 2018 World Cup.jpeg|thumb|Russian bid personnel celebrate the awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia on 2 December 2010.]]\n[[File:Vladimir Putin FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour kick-off ceremony.jpg|thumb|President [[Vladimir Putin]] holding the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy]] at a pre-tournament ceremony in Moscow on 9&nbsp;September 2017]]\n[[File:Russia 100 Rubles 2018 FIFA World Cup.jpg|thumb|upright|The 100-[[Russian ruble|ruble]] commemorative banknote celebrates the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

After having tested the technology at limited matches of the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]],<ref name=\"wPguj\" /> and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of [[Rio de Janeiro]]),<ref name=\"kVsNi\" /> the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra-high-definition television|ultra high definition]]. Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut on each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being upconverted from [[1080p]] high definition sources with limited degradation in quality. These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.<ref name=\"TCu23\" /><ref name=\"0j6eE\" /><ref name=\"6j06c\" />\n\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder [[UA:PBC]] stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup. This came in the wake of growing boycotts of the tournament among the [[Football Federation of Ukraine]] and sports minister [[Ihor Zhdanov]].<ref name=\"Xv82A\" /><ref name=\"0gvp3\" /> Additionally, the Football Federation of Ukraine refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets.<ref name=\"MLa57\" /> However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.<ref name=\"YqvyD\" />\n\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing [[2017\u201318 Qatar diplomatic crisis|diplomatic crisis in Qatar]], which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar\u2014the home country of FIFA's Middle East and Africa rightsholder [[beIN Sports]]\u2014in June 2017, over its [[Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism|alleged state support of terrorist groups]]. On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from [[Du (company)|Du]] and [[Etisalat]], but with service to the latter restored later that day. Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions.<ref name=\"y5Kr4\" /><ref name=\"mvmPW\" /><ref name=\"jyl42\" /> In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as \"[[beoutQ]]\". While FIFA attempted to indirectly negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final, they were unable to do so. On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had \"engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.\"<ref name=\"NIzbW\" /><ref name=\"6N9LV\" />\n\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men's World Cup whose English rights were held by [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]], and Spanish rights held by [[Telemundo Deportes|Telemundo]]. The elimination of the United States in qualifying led to concerns that US interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that \"casual\" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5&nbsp;million viewers in 2014, and how much Fox paid for the rights. During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]. Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of coverage for the tournament.<ref name=\"lJrJH\" /><ref name=\"Oo1hn\" /><ref name=\"1M4WS\" /> Viewership was down overall over 2014, additionally citing match scheduling that was not as favourable to viewers in the Americas than 2014 (with many matches airing in the morning hours, although Telemundo's broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday [[Daytime television|daytime]] program in network history).<ref name=\"wx1ZL\" /><ref name=\"UFMpG\" />\n\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, [[Korean Central Television]] acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea. Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time.

She is a seven-time [[Olympics|Olympic]] and ten-time [[World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|World Championship]] medalist.  Am\u00e2nar helped Romania win four consecutive world team titles (1994\u20131999), as well as the 2000 Olympic team title. She is also the 2000 Olympic all-around champion.

At the [[1995 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|1995 World Championships]], she helped Romania secure its second consecutive world team title and became co-champion on vault (with all-around winner [[Lilia Podkopayeva]] of Ukraine). Am\u00e2nar's powerful floor routine and vaults put her in the lead after two rotations in the all-around, but she dropped to fourth after an average [[uneven bars]] routine and a shaky [[balance beam]] routine.\n\n===1996===\nAm\u00e2nar won a silver medal on vault at the [[1996 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|1996 World Championships]], behind teammate [[Gina Gogean]] and ahead of Cuba's [[Annia Hatch|Annia {{sic|hide=y|Portuondo}}-Hatch]].\n\nAt the [[1996 Summer Olympics]], Am\u00e2nar was one of the front-runners for several individual medals, but her Olympics started inauspiciously when she fell off the beam during the compulsories. Though she later posted the highest all-around score in the optionals (39.387, her lowest score being a 9.800 on the balance beam), her combined compulsory and optionals scores put her fourth among her teammates, and she did not qualify for the final.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/26/sports/atlanta-day-7-gymnastics-us-gymnasts-take-back-seat-in-all-around.html |title=U.S. Gymnasts Take Back Seat in All-Around |last=Clarey |first=Christopher |date=1996-07-26 |work= |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |access-date=2016-07-31 |via=}}</ref> However, in a scenario similar to the [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]]'s substitution of [[Tatiana Gutsu]] for [[Rozalia Galiyeva]] at the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympics]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-07-31/sports/1992213141_1_gutsu-zmeskal-unified-team |title=Zmeskal steps out, then down: World champion is tearful 10th as Gutsu, Miller reign |last=Glauber |first=Bill |date=1992-07-31 |website=Baltimore Sun |publisher= |access-date=2016-07-31}}</ref> Am\u00e2nar replaced her teammate [[Alexandra Marinescu]] in the all-around final.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Romanian head coach, [[Octavian Bellu]], said that Am\u00e2nar deserved to compete because she had worked harder and was a better athlete than Marinescu. Am\u00e2nar ended up sharing the bronze medal with teammate [[Lavinia Milo\u015fovici]], behind Gogean.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn both the 1996 Olympic all-around and the 1995 World Championships all-around, Am\u00e2nar failed to score over 9.800 on the floor exercise despite well-executed and difficult tumbling. In the Olympics, she scored a 9.887 in the team optionals (the highest score of the entire Olympics on any event, for men or women), but only a 9.737 in the all-around. She did not start from a 10.0 in the all-around\u2014despite having the most tumbling bonus points of anyone at the Games\u2014because her tour jet\u00e9 half-turn ([[Kerri Strug|Strug]]), a C element, was not completed. Thus, she did not have enough simple A, B, and C skills, and much of her D- and E-rated tumbling had to count as easier elements to fulfill those requirements. Am\u00e2nar did not perform a double turn in the team optionals or the all-around because it was not necessary as long as she completed her Strug. However, when she failed to complete the Strug, four of her six tenths in D and E elements had to count toward requirements, which left her with only .2 counting toward her bonus. Without the error, Am\u00e2nar would have finished ahead of Gogean and Milo\u015fovici.\n\nIn the event finals, Am\u00e2nar completed her Strug and added a double turn to fulfill the more stringent Competition III requirements. She earned a 9.850 and the silver medal, behind Podkopayeva and just ahead of [[Dominique Dawes]] of the United States. She won the vault final the day before, largely because of her 9.875 score for her double-twisting [[Yurchenko (vault)|Yurchenko vault]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-07-29/news/ss-29267_1_amy-chow |title=After the Rest Bow Out, Chow Gets Silver Medal |last=Penner |first=Mike |date=1996-07-29 |work= |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US |issn=0458-3035 |access-date=2016-07-31 |via=}}</ref> She left the 1996 Olympics with four medals, including Romania's team bronze.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.olympic.org/simona-amanar |title=Simona Amanar |last= |first= |date=2016-06-20 |website=olympic.org |publisher= |access-date=2016-07-31}}</ref>\n\n===1997\u20131999===\nRomania won its third straight team title at the [[1997 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|1997 World Championships]].

She is a seven-time [[Olympics|Olympic]] and ten-time [[World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|World Championship]] medalist.  Am\u00e2nar helped Romania win four consecutive world team titles (1994\u20131999), as well as the 2000 Olympic team title. She is also the 2000 Olympic all-around champion. She has [[Amanar|a vault named after her]], one of the most difficult in women's gymnastics, and was inducted into the [[International Gymnastics Hall of Fame]] in 2007.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ighof.com/honorees/2007_Simona_Amanar.php |title=Simona Amanar \u2013 The International Gymnastics Hall of Fame |website=www.ighof.com |access-date=2016-07-31}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===1994\u20131995===\nIn 1994, her first year on the senior national team, Am\u00e2nar contributed to Romania's team titles at the [[1994 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships (Team)|World]] and [[European Women's Artistic Gymnastics Championships|European Championships]].\n\nAm\u00e2nar began to excel as an individual performer at the 1995 European Cup, placing second in the all-around behind [[Svetlana Khorkina]] of Russia and winning gold on both [[Vault (gymnastics)|vault]] and [[Floor (gymnastics)|floor exercise]]. At the [[1995 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|1995 World Championships]], she helped Romania secure its second consecutive world team title and became co-champion on vault (with all-around winner [[Lilia Podkopayeva]] of Ukraine). Am\u00e2nar's powerful floor routine and vaults put her in the lead after two rotations in the all-around, but she dropped to fourth after an average [[uneven bars]] routine and a shaky [[balance beam]] routine.\n\n===1996===\nAm\u00e2nar won a silver medal on vault at the [[1996 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|1996 World Championships]], behind teammate [[Gina Gogean]] and ahead of Cuba's [[Annia Hatch|Annia {{sic|hide=y|Portuondo}}-Hatch]].\n\nAt the [[1996 Summer Olympics]], Am\u00e2nar was one of the front-runners for several individual medals, but her Olympics started inauspiciously when she fell off the beam during the compulsories. Though she later posted the highest all-around score in the optionals (39.387, her lowest score being a 9.800 on the balance beam), her combined compulsory and optionals scores put her fourth among her teammates, and she did not qualify for the final.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/26/sports/atlanta-day-7-gymnastics-us-gymnasts-take-back-seat-in-all-around.html |title=U.S. Gymnasts Take Back Seat in All-Around |last=Clarey |first=Christopher |date=1996-07-26 |work= |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |access-date=2016-07-31 |via=}}</ref> However, in a scenario similar to the [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]]'s substitution of [[Tatiana Gutsu]] for [[Rozalia Galiyeva]] at the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympics]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1992-07-31/sports/1992213141_1_gutsu-zmeskal-unified-team |title=Zmeskal steps out, then down: World champion is tearful 10th as Gutsu, Miller reign |last=Glauber |first=Bill |date=1992-07-31 |website=Baltimore Sun |publisher= |access-date=2016-07-31}}</ref> Am\u00e2nar replaced her teammate [[Alexandra Marinescu]] in the all-around final.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Romanian head coach, [[Octavian Bellu]], said that Am\u00e2nar deserved to compete because she had worked harder and was a better athlete than Marinescu.

In the Olympics, she scored a 9.887 in the team optionals (the highest score of the entire Olympics on any event, for men or women), but only a 9.737 in the all-around. She did not start from a 10.0 in the all-around\u2014despite having the most tumbling bonus points of anyone at the Games\u2014because her tour jet\u00e9 half-turn ([[Kerri Strug|Strug]]), a C element, was not completed. Thus, she did not have enough simple A, B, and C skills, and much of her D- and E-rated tumbling had to count as easier elements to fulfill those requirements. Am\u00e2nar did not perform a double turn in the team optionals or the all-around because it was not necessary as long as she completed her Strug. However, when she failed to complete the Strug, four of her six tenths in D and E elements had to count toward requirements, which left her with only .2 counting toward her bonus. Without the error, Am\u00e2nar would have finished ahead of Gogean and Milo\u015fovici.\n\nIn the event finals, Am\u00e2nar completed her Strug and added a double turn to fulfill the more stringent Competition III requirements. She earned a 9.850 and the silver medal, behind Podkopayeva and just ahead of [[Dominique Dawes]] of the United States. She won the vault final the day before, largely because of her 9.875 score for her double-twisting [[Yurchenko (vault)|Yurchenko vault]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-07-29/news/ss-29267_1_amy-chow |title=After the Rest Bow Out, Chow Gets Silver Medal |last=Penner |first=Mike |date=1996-07-29 |work= |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US |issn=0458-3035 |access-date=2016-07-31 |via=}}</ref> She left the 1996 Olympics with four medals, including Romania's team bronze.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.olympic.org/simona-amanar |title=Simona Amanar |last= |first= |date=2016-06-20 |website=olympic.org |publisher= |access-date=2016-07-31}}</ref>\n\n===1997\u20131999===\nRomania won its third straight team title at the [[1997 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|1997 World Championships]].

The [[species]] '''''Tyrannosaurus rex''''' (''rex'' meaning \"king\" in [[Latin]]), often called '''''T. rex''''' or colloquially '''''T-Rex''''', is one of the most well-represented of the large theropods. ''Tyrannosaurus'' lived throughout what is now western North America, on what was then an island continent known as [[Laramidia]]. ''Tyrannosaurus'' had a much wider range than other [[Tyrannosauridae|tyrannosaurids]]. Fossils are found in a variety of [[geologic formation|rock formations]] dating to the [[Maastrichtian]] age of the upper [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]], 68 to 66&nbsp;[[mya (unit)|million years ago]]. It was the last known member of the tyrannosaurids, and among the last non-[[aves|avian]] dinosaurs to exist before the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]].\n\nLike other tyrannosaurids, ''Tyrannosaurus'' was a [[biped]]al [[carnivore]] with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to its large and powerful hind limbs, ''Tyrannosaurus'' forelimbs were short but unusually powerful for their size and had two clawed digits. The most complete specimen measures up to {{convert|12.3|m|ft|abbr=on|sp=us}} in length though ''T. rex'' could grow to lengths of over {{convert|12.3|m|ft|abbr=on|sp=us}}, up to {{convert|3.66|m|ft|0|sp=us}} tall at the hips, and according to most modern estimates {{convert|8.4|MT|ST}} to {{convert|14|MT|ST|1}} in weight. Although other theropods rivaled or exceeded ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' in [[dinosaur size|size]], it is still among the largest known land predators and is estimated to have exerted the strongest bite force among all terrestrial animals. By far the largest carnivore in its environment, ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' was most likely an [[apex predator]], preying upon [[hadrosaur]]s, armored herbivores like [[ceratopsia]]ns and [[ankylosaur]]s, and possibly [[sauropod]]s. Some experts have suggested the dinosaur was primarily a [[scavenger]]. The question of whether ''Tyrannosaurus'' was an apex predator or a pure scavenger was among the longest debates in [[paleontology]]. Most paleontologists today accept that ''Tyrannosaurus'' was both an active predator and a scavenger.\n\nMore than fifty major specimens of ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' have been identified, some of which are nearly complete skeletons. [[Soft tissue]] and [[protein]]s have been reported in at least one of these specimens. The abundance of fossil material has allowed significant research into many aspects of its biology, including its life history and [[biomechanics]]. The feeding habits, [[physiology]] and potential speed of ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' are a few subjects of debate. Its [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] is also controversial, as some scientists consider ''[[Tarbosaurus|Tarbosaurus bataar]]'' from Asia to be a second ''Tyrannosaurus'' species while others maintain ''Tarbosaurus'' is a separate genus. Several other genera of North American tyrannosaurids have also been [[synonym (biology)|synonymized]] with ''Tyrannosaurus''.\n\nAs the archetypal theropod, ''Tyrannosaurus'' has been one of the best-known dinosaurs since the early 20th century, and has been featured in film, advertising, postal stamps, and many other media.\n\n==Description==\n===Size===\n[[File:Longest theropods.svg|alt=|thumb|350x350px|Size (in purple) compared with selected giant theropods and a human]]\n''Tyrannosaurus rex'' was one of the largest land carnivores of all time.

Sue was mounted with forty-seven of such caudal vertebrae.<ref name=\"brochu2003\" /> The neck of ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' formed a natural S-shaped curve like that of other theropods. Compared to these, it was exceptionally short, deep and muscular to support the massive head. The second vertebra, the axis, was especially short. The remaining neck vertebrae were weakly opisthocoelous, i.e. with a convex front of the vertebral body and a concave rear. The vertebral bodies had single pleurocoels, pneumatic depressions created by [[air sac]]s, on their sides.<ref name=\"brochu2003\" /> The vertebral bodies of the torso were robust but with a narrow waist. Their undersides were keeled. The front sides were concave with a deep vertical trough. They had large pleurocoels. Their neural spines had very rough front and rear sides for the attachment of strong tendons. The sacral vertebrae were fused to each other, both in their vertebral bodies and neural spines. They were pneumatized. They were connected to the pelvis by transverse processes and sacral ribs. The tail was heavy and moderately long, in order to balance the massive head and torso and to provide space for massive [[Animal locomotion|locomotor muscles]] that attached to the thighbones. The thirteenth tail vertebra formed the transition point between the deep tail base and the middle tail that was stiffened by rather long front articulation processes.

Growth curves can be developed when the ages of different specimens are plotted on a graph along with their mass. A ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' growth curve is S-shaped, with juveniles remaining under {{convert|1800|kg|abbr=on}} until approximately 14 years of age, when body size began to increase dramatically.

This study also indicates that in such changing environments, ''Tyrannosaurus'' was particularly well-suited to an environment that shifted yearly in regards to resource abundance, hinting that other midsize predators might have had difficulty surviving in such harsh conditions and explaining the niche partitioning between juvenile and adult tyrannosaurs.

These species are characterized by high infant mortality rates, followed by relatively low mortality among juveniles. Mortality increases again following sexual maturity, partly due to the stresses of reproduction. One study suggests that the rarity of juvenile ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' fossils is due in part to low juvenile mortality rates; the animals were not dying in large numbers at these ages, and so were not often fossilized. This rarity may also be due to the incompleteness of the [[fossil record]] or to the bias of fossil collectors towards larger, more spectacular specimens.<ref name=\"ericksonetal2006\" /> In a 2013 lecture, Thomas Holtz Jr. suggested that dinosaurs \"lived fast and died young\" because they reproduced quickly whereas mammals have long life spans because they take longer to reproduce.<ref name=\"HoltzLecture2013\">{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqkqkxYGNZc |title=The Life and Times of Tyrannosaurus rex, with Dr. Thomas Holtz |date=March 19, 2013 |last=Holtz |first=T.

Several [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] differences associated with the two morphs were used to analyze [[sexual dimorphism]] in ''Tyrannosaurus rex'', with the 'robust' morph usually suggested to be female.

Examination of B-rex demonstrated the preservation of [[soft tissue]] within several bones.

As only female birds lay eggs, medullary tissue is only found naturally in females, although males are capable of producing it when injected with female reproductive [[hormone]]s like [[estrogen]].

This hypothesis may be supported by [[biomechanics|biomechanical]] analysis. ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' forelimb bones exhibit extremely thick [[Bone#Structure|cortical bone]], which has been interpreted as evidence that they were developed to withstand heavy loads. The [[biceps brachii]] muscle of an adult ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' was capable of lifting {{convert|199|kg|lb|0}} by itself; other muscles such as the [[brachialis]] would work along with the biceps to make elbow flexion even more powerful. The [[M. biceps]] muscle of ''T.&nbsp;rex'' was 3.5 times as powerful as the [[human equivalent]]. A ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' forearm had a limited range of motion, with the shoulder and elbow joints allowing only 40 and 45 degrees of motion, respectively. In contrast, the same two joints in ''[[Deinonychus]]'' allow up to 88 and 130 degrees of motion, respectively, while a human arm can rotate 360 degrees at the shoulder and move through 165 degrees at the elbow. The heavy build of the arm bones, strength of the muscles, and limited range of motion may indicate a system evolved to hold fast despite the stresses of a struggling prey animal.

Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events they are more likely to be caused by regular behavior than other types of injuries. Of the 81 ''Tyrannosaurus'' foot bones examined in the study one was found to have a stress fracture, while none of the 10 hand bones were found to have stress fractures.

The presence of avulsion injuries being limited to the forelimb and shoulder in both ''Tyrannosaurus'' and ''Allosaurus'' suggests that theropods may have had a musculature more complex than and functionally different from those of birds.

The [[species]] '''''Tyrannosaurus rex''''' (''rex'' meaning \"king\" in [[Latin]]), often called '''''T. rex''''' or colloquially '''''T-Rex''''', is one of the most well-represented of the large theropods. ''Tyrannosaurus'' lived throughout what is now western North America, on what was then an island continent known as [[Laramidia]]. ''Tyrannosaurus'' had a much wider range than other [[Tyrannosauridae|tyrannosaurids]]. Fossils are found in a variety of [[geologic formation|rock formations]] dating to the [[Maastrichtian]] age of the upper [[Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|Period]], 68 to 66&nbsp;[[mya (unit)|million years ago]]. It was the last known member of the tyrannosaurids, and among the last non-[[aves|avian]] dinosaurs to exist before the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]].\n\nLike other tyrannosaurids, ''Tyrannosaurus'' was a [[biped]]al [[carnivore]] with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to its large and powerful hind limbs, ''Tyrannosaurus'' forelimbs were short but unusually powerful for their size and had two clawed digits. The most complete specimen measures up to {{convert|12.3|m|ft|abbr=on|sp=us}} in length though ''T. rex'' could grow to lengths of over {{convert|12.3|m|ft|abbr=on|sp=us}}, up to {{convert|3.66|m|ft|0|sp=us}} tall at the hips, and according to most modern estimates {{convert|8.4|MT|ST}} to {{convert|14|MT|ST|1}} in weight. Although other theropods rivaled or exceeded ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' in [[dinosaur size|size]], it is still among the largest known land predators and is estimated to have exerted the strongest bite force among all terrestrial animals. By far the largest carnivore in its environment, ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' was most likely an [[apex predator]], preying upon [[hadrosaur]]s, armored herbivores like [[ceratopsia]]ns and [[ankylosaur]]s, and possibly [[sauropod]]s. Some experts have suggested the dinosaur was primarily a [[scavenger]]. The question of whether ''Tyrannosaurus'' was an apex predator or a pure scavenger was among the longest debates in [[paleontology]]. Most paleontologists today accept that ''Tyrannosaurus'' was both an active predator and a scavenger.\n\nMore than fifty major specimens of ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' have been identified, some of which are nearly complete skeletons. [[Soft tissue]] and [[protein]]s have been reported in at least one of these specimens. The abundance of fossil material has allowed significant research into many aspects of its biology, including its life history and [[biomechanics]]. The feeding habits, [[physiology]] and potential speed of ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' are a few subjects of debate. Its [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] is also controversial, as some scientists consider ''[[Tarbosaurus|Tarbosaurus bataar]]'' from Asia to be a second ''Tyrannosaurus'' species while others maintain ''Tarbosaurus'' is a separate genus. Several other genera of North American tyrannosaurids have also been [[synonym (biology)|synonymized]] with ''Tyrannosaurus''.\n\nAs the archetypal theropod, ''Tyrannosaurus'' has been one of the best-known dinosaurs since the early 20th century, and has been featured in film, advertising, postal stamps, and many other media.\n\n==Description==\n===Size===\n[[File:Longest theropods.svg|alt=|thumb|350x350px|Size (in purple) compared with selected giant theropods and a human]]\n''Tyrannosaurus rex'' was one of the largest land carnivores of all time.

Its front [[dentary bone]] bore thirteen teeth. Behind the tooth row, the lower jaw became notably taller.<ref name=\"brochu2003\" />\n\nThe [[vertebral column]] of ''Tyrannosaurus'' consisted of ten neck vertebrae, thirteen back vertebrae and five sacral vertebrae. The number of tail vertebrae is unknown and could well have varied between individuals but probably numbered at least forty. Sue was mounted with forty-seven of such caudal vertebrae.<ref name=\"brochu2003\" /> The neck of ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' formed a natural S-shaped curve like that of other theropods. Compared to these, it was exceptionally short, deep and muscular to support the massive head. The second vertebra, the axis, was especially short. The remaining neck vertebrae were weakly opisthocoelous, i.e. with a convex front of the vertebral body and a concave rear. The vertebral bodies had single pleurocoels, pneumatic depressions created by [[air sac]]s, on their sides.<ref name=\"brochu2003\" /> The vertebral bodies of the torso were robust but with a narrow waist. Their undersides were keeled. The front sides were concave with a deep vertical trough. They had large pleurocoels. Their neural spines had very rough front and rear sides for the attachment of strong tendons. The sacral vertebrae were fused to each other, both in their vertebral bodies and neural spines. They were pneumatized. They were connected to the pelvis by transverse processes and sacral ribs. The tail was heavy and moderately long, in order to balance the massive head and torso and to provide space for massive [[Animal locomotion|locomotor muscles]] that attached to the thighbones. The thirteenth tail vertebra formed the transition point between the deep tail base and the middle tail that was stiffened by rather long front articulation processes. The underside of the trunk was covered by eighteen or nineteen pairs of segmented belly ribs.<ref name=\"brochu2003\" />\n[[File:Tyrannosaurus (arm).jpg|thumb|left|Right forelimb of ''Tyrannosaurus'']]\nThe [[shoulder girdle]] was longer than the entire forelimb. The shoulder blade had a narrow shaft but was exceptionally expanded at its upper end. It connected via a long forward protrusion to the [[coracoid]], which was rounded. Both shoulder blades were connected by a small [[furcula]]. The paired breast bones possibly were made of [[cartilage]] only.<ref name=\"brochu2003\" />\n\nThe forelimb or arm was very short. The upper arm bone, the humerus, was short but robust. It had a narrow upper end with an exceptionally rounded head. The lower arm bones, the [[ulna]] and radius, were straight elements, much shorter than the humerus. The second [[metacarpus|metacarpal]] was longer and wider than the first, whereas normally in theropods the opposite is true. The forelimbs had only two clawed fingers,<ref name=\"brochu2003\" /> along with an additional splint-like small third [[metacarpus|metacarpal]] representing the remnant of a third digit.<ref name=\"CLKC08\">{{Cite book |title=''Tyrannosaurus rex'', the Tyrant King |last=Lipkin |first=C. |last2=Carpenter |first2=K. |date=2008 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-35087-9 |editor-last=Carpenter |editor-first=K. |location=Bloomington |pages=167\u2013190 |chapter=Looking again at the forelimb of ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' |editor-last2=Larson |editor-first2=P.

The front [[pubic bone]] ended  in an enormous pubic boot, longer than the entire shaft of the element. The rear [[ischium]] was slender and straight, pointing obliquely to behind and below.<ref name=\"brochu2003\" />\n\nIn contrast to the arms, the hindlimbs were among the longest in proportion to body size of any theropod. In the foot, the [[metatarsus]] was \"arctometatarsalian\", meaning that the part of the third metatarsal near the ankle was pinched. The third metatarsal was also exceptionally sinuous.<ref name=\"brochu2003\" /> Compensating for the immense bulk of the animal, many bones throughout the skeleton were hollowed, reducing its weight without significant loss of strength.<ref name=\"brochu2003\" />\n\n===Skin and possible feathers===\n{{Main|Feathered dinosaur}}\n[[File:Tyrannosaurus skin impressions.jpg|thumb|upright|Skin impressions from the tail region of a ''Tyrannosaurus'' cast, AMNH]]\nThe discovery of [[feathered dinosaur]]s led to debates if, and to what extent, ''Tyrannosaurus'' might have been feathered.<ref name=\"Belletal2017\" /><ref name=\"NYT-20190307\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/arts/design/t-rex-exhibition-american-museum-of-natural-history.html |title=T.

I have never seen anything like it from the [[Cretaceous]]\".<ref name=\"dingus2010\" />  [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]], president of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], named the second skeleton ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' in 1905. The generic name is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''\u03c4\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2'' (''tyrannos'', meaning \"tyrant\") and ''[[wikt:\u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2|\u03c3\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2]]'' (''sauros'', meaning \"lizard\"). Osborn used the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''rex'', meaning \"king\", for the specific name. The full [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial]] therefore translates to \"tyrant lizard the king\" or \"King Tyrant Lizard\", emphasizing the animal's size and perceived dominance over other species of the time.

The footprint was published as the [[ichnogenus]] ''[[Tyrannosauripus pillmorei]]'' in 1994, by [[Martin Lockley]] and Adrian Hunt. Lockley and Hunt suggested that it was very likely the track was made by a ''Tyrannosaurus rex'', which would make it the first known footprint from this species.

[[Histology|Histologic]] analysis of ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' bones showed LACM 28471 had aged only 2 years when it died, while Sue was 28 years old, an age which may have been close to the maximum for the species.<ref name=\"ericksonetal2004\" />\n\nHistology has also allowed the age of other specimens to be determined. Growth curves can be developed when the ages of different specimens are plotted on a graph along with their mass. A ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' growth curve is S-shaped, with juveniles remaining under {{convert|1800|kg|abbr=on}} until approximately 14 years of age, when body size began to increase dramatically. During this rapid growth phase, a young ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' would gain an average of {{convert|600|kg|lb|abbr=on}} a year for the next four years. At 18 years of age, the curve plateaus again, indicating that growth slowed dramatically. For example, only {{convert|600|kg|lb|abbr=on}} separated the 28-year-old Sue from a 22-year-old Canadian specimen ([[Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology|RTMP]] 81.12.1).<ref name=\"ericksonetal2004\" /> A 2004 histological study performed by different workers corroborates these results, finding that rapid growth began to slow at around 16 years of age.<ref name=\"hornerpadian2004\">{{Cite journal |last=Horner |first=J.

This study also indicates that in such changing environments, ''Tyrannosaurus'' was particularly well-suited to an environment that shifted yearly in regards to resource abundance, hinting that other midsize predators might have had difficulty surviving in such harsh conditions and explaining the niche partitioning between juvenile and adult tyrannosaurs.

These species are characterized by high infant mortality rates, followed by relatively low mortality among juveniles. Mortality increases again following sexual maturity, partly due to the stresses of reproduction. One study suggests that the rarity of juvenile ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' fossils is due in part to low juvenile mortality rates; the animals were not dying in large numbers at these ages, and so were not often fossilized. This rarity may also be due to the incompleteness of the [[fossil record]] or to the bias of fossil collectors towards larger, more spectacular specimens.<ref name=\"ericksonetal2006\" /> In a 2013 lecture, Thomas Holtz Jr. suggested that dinosaurs \"lived fast and died young\" because they reproduced quickly whereas mammals have long life spans because they take longer to reproduce.<ref name=\"HoltzLecture2013\">{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqkqkxYGNZc |title=The Life and Times of Tyrannosaurus rex, with Dr. Thomas Holtz |date=March 19, 2013 |last=Holtz |first=T.

As one of these morphs was more solidly built, it was termed the 'robust' morph while the other was termed '[[Wikt:gracile|gracile]]'. Several [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] differences associated with the two morphs were used to analyze [[sexual dimorphism]] in ''Tyrannosaurus rex'', with the 'robust' morph usually suggested to be female.

The differences could also be age-related, with 'robust' individuals being older animals.<ref name=\"brochu2003\" />\n\nOnly a single ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' specimen has been conclusively shown to belong to a specific sex. Examination of B-rex demonstrated the preservation of [[soft tissue]] within several bones.

As only female birds lay eggs, medullary tissue is only found naturally in females, although males are capable of producing it when injected with female reproductive [[hormone]]s like [[estrogen]].

''Tyrannosaurus rex'' forelimb bones exhibit extremely thick [[Bone#Structure|cortical bone]], which has been interpreted as evidence that they were developed to withstand heavy loads. The [[biceps brachii]] muscle of an adult ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' was capable of lifting {{convert|199|kg|lb|0}} by itself; other muscles such as the [[brachialis]] would work along with the biceps to make elbow flexion even more powerful. The [[M. biceps]] muscle of ''T.&nbsp;rex'' was 3.5 times as powerful as the [[human equivalent]]. A ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' forearm had a limited range of motion, with the shoulder and elbow joints allowing only 40 and 45 degrees of motion, respectively. In contrast, the same two joints in ''[[Deinonychus]]'' allow up to 88 and 130 degrees of motion, respectively, while a human arm can rotate 360 degrees at the shoulder and move through 165 degrees at the elbow. The heavy build of the arm bones, strength of the muscles, and limited range of motion may indicate a system evolved to hold fast despite the stresses of a struggling prey animal.

Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events they are more likely to be caused by regular behavior than other types of injuries. Of the 81 ''Tyrannosaurus'' foot bones examined in the study one was found to have a stress fracture, while none of the 10 hand bones were found to have stress fractures.

The presence of avulsion injuries being limited to the forelimb and shoulder in both ''Tyrannosaurus'' and ''Allosaurus'' suggests that theropods may have had a musculature more complex than and functionally different from those of birds.

''Tyrannosaurus'' ranged from [[Canada]] in the north to at least New Mexico in the south of [[Laramidia]].<ref name=\"larson2008\" /> During this time ''[[Triceratops]]'' was the major herbivore in the northern portion of its range, while the [[titanosaurian]] [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] ''[[Alamosaurus]]'' \"dominated\" its southern range. ''Tyrannosaurus'' remains have been discovered in different ecosystems, including inland and coastal subtropical, and semi-arid plains.\n[[File:Upper Cretaceous Hell Creek dinosaur census.png|thumb|left|[[Pie chart]] of the time averaged census for large-bodied dinosaurs from the entire Hell Creek Formation in the study area]]\nSeveral notable ''Tyrannosaurus'' remains have been found in the [[Hell Creek Formation]]. During the Maastrichtian this area was [[subtropical]], with a warm and humid climate. The flora consisted mostly of [[angiosperms]], but also included trees like dawn redwood (''[[Metasequoia]]'') and ''[[Araucaria araucana|Araucaria]]''. ''Tyrannosaurus'' shared this ecosystem with [[ceratopsia]]ns ''[[Leptoceratops]]'', ''[[Torosaurus]]'', and ''Triceratops'', the hadrosaurid ''[[Edmontosaurus annectens]],'' the [[Parksosauridae|parksosaurid]] ''[[Thescelosaurus]]'', the [[ankylosaur]]s ''[[Ankylosaurus]]'' and ''[[Denversaurus]]'', the [[pachycephalosaur]]s ''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]'' and ''[[Sphaerotholus]]'', and the theropods ''[[Ornithomimus]]'', ''[[Struthiomimus]]'', ''[[Acheroraptor]]'', ''[[Dakotaraptor]]'', ''[[Pectinodon]]'' and ''[[Anzu wyliei|Anzu]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Estes |first=R. |last2=Berberian |first2=P. |year=1970 |title=Paleoecology of a late Cretaceous vertebrate community from Montana |journal=Breviora |volume=343 |pages=1\u201335}}</ref>\n\nAnother formation with ''Tyrannosaurus'' remains is the [[Lance Formation]] of Wyoming.
