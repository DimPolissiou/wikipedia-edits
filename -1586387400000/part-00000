The lyrics of the song were written by [[Bernie Taupin]] and the melody composed by John for his [[Elton John (album)|eponymous second album]] in 1970.\n\nIt was released in [[1970 in music|1970]] as the B side of the second single from the album, \"[[Your Song]]\", which became the singer's first hit on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\n==Composition and inspiration==\nMany\u2014including Elton John himself<ref>Interview: The Late Late Show with James Corden, March 1, 2018</ref>\u2014find the song's lyrics cryptic and incomprehensible. \n\n\"If you feel that it's real, I'm on trial. And I'm here in your prison.\nLike a coin in your mint, I am dented. And I'm spent with high treason.\nThrough a glass eye your throne, is the one danger zone.\nTake me to the pilot for control, take me to the pilot of your soul.\"\n\nLyricist Bernie Taupin has admitted to not knowing what the song's lyrics represent, comparing his writing style in \"Pilot\" to poets like \"[[Baudelaire]] and [[Rimbaud]]...(who) just threw things together and went 'Wow! That sounds good'\". The lyrics possess many elements: [[betrayal]], either [[political]] or personal (\"treason\"); the illusion of [[Risk|danger]] (\"through a glass eye\"); and fearlessness toward the unknown (\"take me to the pilot of your soul\"). According to Elton, this and other songs recorded during this period were inspired by the [[science fiction]] books Bernie was reading at the time.\n\nThe country duo [[Brothers Osborne]] recorded a remake of the song for the 2018 tribute album ''[[Restoration: Reimagining the Songs of Elton John and Bernie Taupin]]''.\n\n==Song history==\nThis has become a staple of John's live shows and can be heard on many of his concert recordings \u2014 such as a performance with his early 1970s backup musicians, bassist [[Dee Murray]] and drummer [[Nigel Olsson]] on ''17-11-70'' (1970) to ''[[Live in Australia with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]]'' (1987) with a full scale orchestral reworking the original Paul Buckmaster score. John also performs the song in a solo version on the album Live in Moscow recorded in 1979. There have also been numerous notable cover versions from the likes of [[Jos\u00e9 Feliciano]], folk/blues guitarist [[Buzzy Linhart]], British Group [[Orange Bicycle]], R&B vocalist [[Ben E. King]], blues icon [[Odetta]], pianist Nate Hopkins, a duet between singers [[Al Jarreau]] and [[Gloria Loring]], and third-season contestant [[George Huff (singer)|George Huff]] on ''[[American Idol]]''. [[The Who]] segue into it from \"[[Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting]]\" on the [[Elton John]]/[[Bernie Taupin]] tribute album, ''[[Two Rooms: Celebrating the Songs of Elton John & Bernie Taupin]]''. In 1983, [[Kikki Danielsson]] covered the song on her ''[[Singles Bar]]'' album.<ref>[http://smdb.kb.se/catalog/id/001886156 Information at [[Svensk mediedatabas]]]</ref> Elton once quoted, in [[The Red Piano Tour]] in 2005, \"And in the early days, there were a lot of inquiries about 'What does this song mean? What does that song mean?' and in the case of 'Take me to the pilot/Lead me through the chamber/Take me to the pilot/I am but a stranger', I have no idea! You're on your own, I tell you.\" American Idol season 3 winner [[Fantasia Barrino]] and Season 11 Top 3 finalist [[Joshua Ledet]] performed this song on the ''[[American Idol]]'' season 11 Finale. The song was also featured in the soundtrack of the 2018 Showtime limited series Escape at Dannemora.\n\n==Format and track list==\n*'''1970 US 7\" single'''\n#. \"Your Song\" 3:57\n#. \"Take Me to the Pilot\" 3:43\n\n*'''1988 US 7\" single'''\n# \"Take Me to the Pilot (live)\" 3:58\n# \"Tonight (live)\" 7:26\n\n*'''1992 US 7\" single'''\n# \"Nikita\"\n# \"Take Me to the Pilot\"\n\n*'''1995 US CD single'''\n# \"Blessed\" 4:19\n# \"Honky Cat (live)\" 7:05\n# \"Take Me to the Pilot (live)\" 5:55\n# \"The Bitch is Back (live)\" 4:26\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n3.

The lyrics of the song were written by [[Bernie Taupin]] and the melody composed by John for his [[Elton John (album)|eponymous second album]] in 1970.\n\nIt was released in [[1970 in music|1970]] as the B side of the second single from the album, \"[[Your Song]],\" which became the singer's first hit on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\n==Composition and inspiration==\nMany\u2014including Elton John himself<ref>Interview: The Late Late Show with James Corden, March 1, 2018</ref>\u2014find the song's lyrics cryptic and incomprehensible. \n\n\"If you feel that it's real, I'm on trial. And I'm here in your prison.\nLike a coin in your mint, I am dented. And I'm spent with high treason.\nThrough a glass eye your throne, is the one danger zone.\nTake me to the pilot for control, take me to the pilot of your soul.\"\n\nLyricist Bernie Taupin has admitted to not knowing what the song's lyrics represent, comparing his writing style in \"Pilot\" to poets like \"[[Baudelaire]] and [[Rimbaud]]...(who) just threw things together and went 'Wow! That sounds good'.\" The lyrics possess many elements: [[betrayal]], either [[political]] or personal (\"treason\"); the illusion of [[Risk|danger]] (\"through a glass eye\"); and fearlessness toward the unknown (\"take me to the pilot of your soul\"). According to Elton, this and other songs recorded during this period were inspired by the [[science fiction]] books Bernie was reading at the time.\n\nThe country duo [[Brothers Osborne]] recorded a remake of the song for the 2018 tribute album ''[[Restoration: Reimagining the Songs of Elton John and Bernie Taupin]]''.\n\n==Song history==\nThis has become a staple of John's live shows and can be heard on many of his concert recordings \u2014 such as a performance with his early 1970s backup musicians, bassist [[Dee Murray]] and drummer [[Nigel Olsson]] on ''17-11-70'' (1970) to ''[[Live in Australia with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]]'' (1987) with a full scale orchestral reworking the original Paul Buckmaster score. John also performs the song in a solo version on the album Live in Moscow recorded in 1979. There have also been numerous notable cover versions from the likes of [[Jos\u00e9 Feliciano]], folk/blues guitarist [[Buzzy Linhart]], British Group [[Orange Bicycle]], R&B vocalist [[Ben E. King]], blues icon [[Odetta]], pianist Nate Hopkins, a duet between singers [[Al Jarreau]] and [[Gloria Loring]], and third-season contestant [[George Huff (singer)|George Huff]] on ''[[American Idol]]''. [[The Who]] segue into it from \"[[Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting]]\" on the [[Elton John]]/[[Bernie Taupin]] tribute album, ''[[Two Rooms: Celebrating the Songs of Elton John & Bernie Taupin]]''. In 1983, [[Kikki Danielsson]] covered the song on her ''[[Singles Bar]]'' album.<ref>[http://smdb.kb.se/catalog/id/001886156 Information at [[Svensk mediedatabas]]]</ref> Elton once quoted, in [[The Red Piano Tour]] in 2005, \"And in the early days, there were a lot of inquiries about 'What does this song mean? What does that song mean?' and in the case of 'Take me to the pilot/Lead me through the chamber/Take me to the pilot/I am but a stranger', I have no idea! You're on your own, I tell you.\" American Idol season 3 winner [[Fantasia Barrino]] and Season 11 Top 3 finalist [[Joshua Ledet]] performed this song on the ''[[American Idol]]'' season 11 Finale.
