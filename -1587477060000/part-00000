At a retail in-store level, merchandising refers to the variety of products available for sale and the display of those products in such a way that it stimulates interest and entices customers to make a purchase.\n\nIn the profession of merchandising you are either employed by the store in which you work, or by an independent distributor.  As a professional merchandiser, in a retail setting, you will not only know your products (i.e. coffee, juice, soda, etc.) but you will gauge other \u201cvendors\u201d like products as you tend to your job.  Working with the store and other merchandisers, shelf space is often given or taken as need be in some locations (for some young merchandisers this is known as \u201cwar\u201d)\n\nIn [[retail]] commerce, visual display merchandising means merchandise [[sales]] using [[product design]], selection, [[packaging]], [[pricing]], and display that stimulates consumers to spend more. This includes disciplines and [[discounting]], physical presentation of products and displays, and the decisions about which products should be presented to which customers at what time.\n\nMerchandising helps to understand the ordinary dating notation for the terms of payment of an invoice.{{clarify|date=April 2016}} Codified discounting solves pricing problems including markups and markdowns. It helps to find the net price of an item after single or multiple trade discounts and can calculate a single discount rate that is equivalent to a series of multiple discounts. Further, it helps to calculate the amount of cash discount for which a payment qualifies.\n\n==Promotional merchandising==\nThe annual cycle of merchandising differs between countries and even within them, particularly relating to cultural customs like holidays, and seasonal issues like climate and local sporting and recreation. Events such as [[Traditional Chinese holidays|Chinese festival]]s and [[Japanese festivals]] are incorporated in an annual cycle of shop decorations and merchandise promotion.\n\nIn the United States, the basic retail cycle begins in early January with merchandise for [[Valentine's Day]], which is not until mid-February. [[Washington's Birthday|Presidents' Day]] sales are held shortly thereafter. Following this, [[Easter]] is the major holiday, while springtime clothing and garden-related merchandise is already arriving at stores, often as early as mid-winter (toward the beginning of this section, [[Saint Patrick's Day|St. Patrick's Day]] merchandise, including green items and products pertaining to Irish culture, is also promoted). [[Mother's Day]] and [[Father's Day]] are next, with [[graduation]] gifts (typically small [[consumer electronics]] like [[digital camera]]s) often being marketed as \"dads and grads\" in June (though most college semesters end in May; the grads portion usually refers to high school graduation, which ends one to two weeks after Father's Day in many U.S. states). Summer merchandise is next, including patriotic-themed products with the American flag, out by [[Memorial Day]] in preparation for [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] (with [[Flag Day (United States)|Flag Day]] in between). By July, [[Back to school (marketing)|back-to-school]] is on the shelves and autumn merchandise is already arriving, and at some [[handicraft|arts and crafts]] stores, [[Christmas decoration]]s. (Often, a [[Christmas in July]] celebration is held around this time.) The back-to-school market is promoted heavily in August, when there are no holidays to promote. By September, particularly after [[Labor Day]], summer merchandise is on final [[Closeout (sale)|closeout]] and [[overstock]] of school supplies is marked-down some as well, and [[Halloween]] (and often even more of the Christmas) merchandise is appearing. As the Halloween decorations and costumes dwindle in October, Christmas is already being pushed on consumers, and by the day after Halloween retailers are going full-force with advertising, even though the \"official\" season doesn't start until [[Black Friday (shopping)|the day after]] [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]. Christmas [[Closeout (sale)|clearance sale]]s begin even before Christmas at many retailers, though others begin on [[Boxing Day|the day after Christmas]] and continue on at least until [[New Year's Day]] but sometimes as far out as February.\n\nMerchandising also varies within [[Chain store|retail chain]]s, where stores in places like [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] might carry [[snow blower]]s, while stores in [[Florida]] and [[southern California]] might instead carry beach clothing and barbecue grills all year. Coastal-area stores might carry [[water skiing]] equipment, while ones near [[mountain range]]s would likely have [[Skiing|snow skiing]] and [[snowboarding]] gear if there are ski areas nearby.\n\n==Trading industry==\nIn Eastern Europe, particularly in [[Economy of Russia|Russian]], the term \"merchandising\" is commonly used within the trading industry and denotes all [[marketing]] and sales stimulation activities around PoS (point of sale): design, creation, promotion, care, and training of the sales staff. A merchandiser is someone who is continuously involved in business promotion by buying and selling of goods. In Asian countries, such as India, this term is more synonymous with activities right from sampling and idea conception to dispatching of the shipment. It is a job description that involves leading and working with different departments within the organization, suppliers and buyers to deal with timely deadlines and accepted quality levels.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Retail supply chain==\n[[File:Walgreens Obama Merchandise.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Merchandising at a [[Walgreens]] in Chicago ]]\nIn the [[supply chain]], merchandising is the practice of making products in retail outlets available to consumers, primarily by stocking shelves and displays. While this used to be done exclusively by the stores' employees, many retailers have found substantial savings in requiring it to be done by the manufacturer, vendor, or wholesaler that provides the products to the retail store. In the United Kingdom, there are a number of organizations that supply merchandising services to support retail outlets with general stock replenishment and merchandising support in new stores. By doing this, retail stores have been able to substantially reduce the number of employees needed to run the store.\n\nWhile stocking shelves and building displays is often done when the product is delivered, it is increasingly a separate activity from delivering the product. In grocery stores, for example, almost all products delivered directly to the store from a manufacturer or wholesaler will be stocked by the manufacturer's/wholesaler's employee who is a full-time merchandiser. Product categories where this is common are Beverage (all types, alcoholic and non-alcoholic), packaged baked goods (bread and pastries), magazines and books, and health and beauty products.    \nFor major food manufacturers in the beverage and baked goods industries, their merchandisers are often the single largest employee group within the company. For nationwide branded goods manufacturers such as [[The Coca-Cola Company]] and [[PepsiCo]], their respective merchandiser work forces number in the thousands.\n\n==Licensing==\nIn [[marketing]], one of the definitions of merchandising is the practice in which the brand or image from one product or service is used to sell another. [[Trademark]]ed brand names, logos, or character images are licensed to manufacturers of products such as toys or clothing, which then make items in or emblazoned with the image of the license, hoping they'll sell better than the same item with no such image.<ref name=\"CoffinLogo\"\n>[http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory?id=2582549 ABC News: Coffins bearing baseball team logos.] (accessed 2007-01-06)\n</ref>  For the owners of the IP ([[intellectual property]]) in question, merchandising is a very popular source of revenue, due to the low cost of letting a third party manufacture the merchandise, while the IP owners collect the merchandising fees.\n\n==Children==\nMerchandising for children is most prominently seen in connection with [[film]]s and videogames, usually those in current release and with [[television]] shows oriented towards children.\n\nMerchandising, especially in connection with child-oriented films and TV shows, often consists of toys made in the likeness of the show's characters (action figures) or items which they use. However, sometimes it can be the other way around, with the show written to include the toys, as advertising for the merchandise. The first major example of this was the TV show \"G.I. JOE A Real American Hero.,\" produced by Hasbro in the early 1980s, but this practice has been common in children's broadcasting ever since.\n\nSometimes merchandising from a television show can grow far beyond the original show, even lasting decades after the show has largely disappeared from popularity. In other cases, large amounts of merchandise can be generated from a pitifully small amount of source material ([[Mashimaro]]).\n\n==Adult==\nThe most common adult-oriented merchandising is that related to [[professional sports]] teams (and their players).\n\nA smaller niche in merchandising is the marketing of more adult-oriented products in connection with similarly adult-oriented films and TV shows. This is common especially with the [[science fiction]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]] [[genre]]s. (Example:  [[Todd McFarlane|McFarlane Toys]]) Occasionally, shows which were intended more for children find a following among adults, and you can see a bit of a crossover, with products from that show oriented towards both adults and children. (''[[Gundam]]'' [[Scale model|model kit]]s) An early example of this phenomenon was the cartoon character Little Lulu, who became licensed to products for adults, such as Kleenex facial tissue.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cartoonician.com/marge-and-lulu-the-art-of-the-deal/ |title=\"Marge and Lulu: The Art of the Deal,\" ''Hogan's Alley'' #15, 2009 |access-date=2013-03-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501001717/http://cartoonician.com/marge-and-lulu-the-art-of-the-deal |archive-date=2013-05-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nSometimes a [[brand]] of non-media products can achieve enough recognition and respect that simply putting its name or images on a completely unrelated item can sell that item.

PET is mainly used in the area of [[medical imaging]] for detecting or measuring changes in [[physiological]] activities like [[metabolism]], blood flow, regional chemical composition, and absorption, and therefore, also called a [[functional imaging]] technique.\n\nSince this PET technique uses radioactive materials (also known as a [[Radiotracer|tracer]] or radio-tracer) for imaging, it is generally categorized within the field of [[nuclear medicine]]. A tracer is injected into the body, which gets trapped within the tissues of interest. The unstable nucleus of [[Radioligand|radio-ligand]] emit positrons, which combine with neighbouring electrons to produce [[gamma ray]]s in the opposite direction at 180 degrees to each other. These gamma rays are detected by the ring of detector placed within the donut-shaped body of the scanner. The energy and location of these gamma rays are recorded and used by a computer program to reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) images of tracer concentration within the body.\n\nIn modern [[PET-CT|PET computed tomography]] scanners, PET images are often reconstructed with the aid of a [[CT scan|computed tomography X-ray scan]] performed on the patient during the same session, in the same machine. Different tracers are used for various imaging purposes, depending on the target process within the body. For example, [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG is commonly used to detect cancer, [<sup>18</sup>F]NaF is widely used for detecting bone formation, and <sup>15</sup>OH<sub>2</sub>O is used to measure blood flow.\n\n[[Fludeoxyglucose (18F)|Fluorodeoxyglucose]] (FDG) is an [[Structural analog|analogue]] of [[glucose]] and the most commonly used tracer molecule for PET. The concentrations of imaged FDG tracer indicate tissue metabolic activity as it corresponds to the regional glucose uptake. [[Metabolic trapping]] of the radioactive glucose molecule allows the PET scan to be utilized. FDG is used to explore the possibility of cancer spreading to other body sites ([[cancer]] [[metastasis]]). These FDG-PET scans for detecting cancer metastasis are the most common in standard medical care (representing 90% of current scans). The same tracer may also be used for the diagnosis of types of [[dementia]]. Less often, other [[radioactive tracers]], usually but not always labelled with [[fluorine-18]], are used to image the tissue concentration of different kinds of molecules of interest inside the body.\n\nOne of the disadvantages of PET scanners is its operating cost.<ref name=\"Carlson 151\">{{cite book | last = Carlson | first = Neil | title = Physiology of Behavior | publisher = Pearson | series = Methods and Strategies of Research | volume = 11th edition | date = January 22, 2012 | page = 151 | isbn = 978-0205239399}}</ref> It can cost up to $8.2 million to set up a complete PET scan unit, and well over a million to obtain approximately 3000 scans per year, depending upon the local cost of living.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Akbari Sari|first=Ali|last2=Ravaghi|first2=Hamid|last3=Mobinizadeh|first3=Mohammadreza|last4=Sarvari|first4=Sima|date=2013-05-20|title=The Cost-Utility Analysis of PET-Scan in Diagnosis and Treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma in Iran|url=http://iranjradiol.com/en/articles/75126.html|journal=Iranian Journal of Radiology|volume=10|issue=2|pages=XX\u2013XX|doi=10.5812/iranjradiol.8559|issn=1735-1065|pmc=3767016|pmid=24046780}}</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:16slicePETCT.jpg|thumb|PET/CT-System with 16-slice CT; the ceiling mounted device is an injection pump for CT contrast agent]]\nPET is both a medical and research tool used in pre-clinical and clinical settings. It is used heavily in the imaging of [[tumour]]s and the search for [[metastasis|metastases]] within the field of clinical [[oncology]], and for the clinical diagnosis of certain diffuse brain diseases such as those causing various types of dementias. PET is a valuable research tool to learn and enhance our knowledge of the normal human brain, heart function, and support drug development. PET is also used in pre-clinical studies using animals. It allows repeated investigations into the same subjects over time, where subjects can act as their own control and substantially reduces the numbers of animals required for a given study. This approach allows research studies to reduce the sample size needed while increasing the statistical quality of its results.\n\nPhysiological processes lead to anatomical changes in the body. Since PET is capable of detecting [[molecular biology]], PET can provide molecular-level information much before any anatomic changes are visible. PET scanning does this by using radiolabelled molecular probes that have different rates of uptake depending on the type and function of tissue involved. Regional tracer uptake in various anatomic structures can be visualized and relatively quantified in terms of injected positron emitter within a PET scan.\n\nPET imaging is best performed using a dedicated PET scanner. It is also possible to acquire PET images using a conventional dual-head [[gamma camera]] fitted with a coincidence detector. The quality of gamma-camera PET imaging is lower, and the scans take longer to acquire. However, this method allows a low-cost on-site solution to institutions with low PET scanning demand. An alternative would be to refer these patients to another center or relying on a visit by a mobile scanner.\n\nAlternative methods of [[medical imaging]] include [[x-ray]] [[computed tomography]] (CT), [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[ultrasound]], and [[single-photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT). [[Single-photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT) is an imaging technique similar to PET that uses [[radioligand]]s to detect molecules in the body. SPECT is less expensive and provides inferior image quality than PET.\n\n===Oncology===\n[[File:PET-MIPS-anim.gif|thumb|Whole-body PET scan using <sup>18</sup>F-FDG.

In addition, a large metastatic tumor mass from colon cancer is seen in the liver.]]\nPET scanning with the tracer [[fluorine-18]] (<sup>18</sup>F) [[fluorodeoxyglucose]] (FDG), called FDG-PET, is widely used in clinical [[oncology]]. FDG is a [[glucose]] [[analog (chemistry)|analog]] that is taken up by glucose-using cells and phosphorylated by [[hexokinase]] (whose [[mitochondrial]] form is significantly elevated in rapidly growing [[malignant]] tumours). A typical dose of FDG used in an oncological scan has an effective radiation dose of 7.6&nbsp;[[mSv]].<ref name=\"Exposure\">ARSAC - Notes for Guidance on the Clinical Administration of Radiopharmaceuticals and use of Sealed Sources (March 2018 p.35)</ref> Because the hydroxyl group that is replaced by fluorine-18 to generate FDG is required for the next step in [[Glycolysis#Sequence of reactions|glucose metabolism]] in all cells, no further reactions occur in FDG. Furthermore, most tissues (with the notable exception of liver and kidneys) cannot remove the [[phosphate]] added by [[hexokinase]]. This means that FDG is trapped in any cell that takes it up until it decays, since [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] sugars, due to their ionic charge, cannot exit from the cell.

What is actually measured indirectly is the flow of blood to different parts of the brain, which is, in general, believed to be correlated, and has been measured using the tracer [[oxygen]]-15. Because of its 2-minute half-life, O-15 must be piped directly from a medical [[cyclotron]] for such uses, which is difficult. \n**'''Example''': In practice, since the brain is normally a rapid user of glucose, and since brain pathologies such as [[Alzheimer's disease|'''Alzheimer's''' disease]] greatly decrease brain metabolism of both glucose and oxygen in tandem, standard FDG-PET of the brain, which measures regional glucose use, may also be successfully used to differentiate Alzheimer's disease from other dementing processes, and also to make early diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease. The advantage of FDG-PET for these uses is its much wider availability. Some radioactive tracers used for Alzheimer's are [[Florbetapir (18F)|florbetapir F18]], [[Flutemetamol (18F)|flutemetamol F18]], and [[Florbetaben (18F)|florbetabenF18]], which are all used to detect [[Amyloid beta|amyloid-beta]] plaques (a potential biomarker for Alzheimer's) in the brain.\n**'''Examples''': PET imaging with FDG can also be used for localization of '''seizure''' focus: A seizure focus will appear as hypometabolic during an interictal scan. Several [[radiotracer]]s (i.e. [[radioligand]]s) have been developed for PET that are [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] for specific [[neuroreceptor]] subtypes such as [<sup>11</sup>C] [[raclopride]], [<sup>18</sup>F] [[fallypride]] and [<sup>18</sup>F] [[desmethoxyfallypride]] for [[dopamine]] D2/D3 receptors, [<sup>11</sup>C] McN 5652 and [<sup>11</sup>C] [[DASB]] for [[serotonin transporter]]s, [<sup>18</sup>F] [[Mefway]] for serotonin [[5-HT1A receptor|5HT1A receptors]], [<sup>18</sup>F] [[Nifene]] for [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s or enzyme substrates (e.g. 6-[[FDOPA]] for the [[Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase|AADC enzyme]]). These agents permit the visualization of neuroreceptor pools in the context of a plurality of neuropsychiatric and neurologic illnesses.\n\n:The development of a number of novel probes for noninvasive, in vivo PET imaging of neuroaggregate in human brain has brought amyloid imaging to the doorstep of clinical use.

The procedure also requires the technically demanding task of calibrating the well counter counts with the PET scanner units used for the image quantification. The well counter counts the activity in the blood samples and the corrected values are converted into the same units as the PET dataset from the scanner using the calibration factor. The measurement of Ki from dynamic PET scans requires tracer kinetic modelling to obtain the model parameters describing the biological processes, which is a computationally intensive task.

These radionuclides are incorporated either into compounds normally used by the body such as [[glucose]] (or glucose analogues), [[water]], or [[ammonia]], or into molecules that bind to receptors or other sites of drug action. Such labelled compounds are known as [[radiotracer]]s. PET technology can be used to trace the biologic pathway of any compound in living humans (and many other species as well), provided it can be radiolabeled with a PET isotope. Thus, the specific processes that can be probed with PET are virtually limitless, and radiotracers for new target molecules and processes are continuing to be synthesized; as of this writing there are already dozens in clinical use and hundreds applied in research. At present,{{when|date=February 2018}} by far the most commonly used radiotracer in clinical PET scanning is [[fluorodeoxyglucose]] (also called FDG or fludeoxyglucose), an analogue of glucose that is labeled with fluorine-18. This radiotracer is used in essentially all scans for oncology and most scans in neurology, and thus makes up the large majority of all of the radiotracer (> 95%) used in PET and PET-CT scanning.\n\nDue to the short half-lives of most positron-emitting radioisotopes, the radiotracers have traditionally been produced using a [[cyclotron]] in close proximity to the PET imaging facility. The half-life of fluorine-18 is long enough that radiotracers labeled with fluorine-18 can be manufactured commercially at offsite locations and shipped to imaging centers. Recently [[rubidium]]-82 generators have become commercially available.<ref>Bracco Diagnostics, [http://www.nuclearonline.org/PI/Cardiogen.pdf CardioGen-82], 2000</ref> These contain strontium-82, which decays by [[electron capture]] to produce positron-emitting rubidium-82.\n\n=== Emission ===\n[[File:PET-schema.png|thumb|right|Schema of a PET acquisition process]]\nTo conduct the scan, a short-lived radioactive tracer [[isotope]] is injected into the living subject (usually into blood circulation). Each tracer atom has been chemically incorporated into a biologically active molecule. There is a waiting period while the active molecule becomes concentrated in tissues of interest; then the subject is placed in the imaging scanner. The molecule most commonly used for this purpose is F-18 labeled [[fluorodeoxyglucose]] (FDG), a sugar, for which the waiting period is typically an hour. During the scan, a record of tissue concentration is made as the tracer decays.\n\nAs the radioisotope undergoes [[positron emission]] decay (also known as positive [[beta decay]]), it emits a positron, an antiparticle of the [[electron]] with opposite charge. The emitted positron travels in tissue for a short distance (typically less than 1&nbsp;mm, but dependent on the isotope<ref>{{cite book | title=PET: physics, instrumentation, and scanners|author=Michael E.

These are detected when they reach a [[scintillator]] in the scanning device, creating a burst of light which is detected by [[photomultiplier]] tubes or silicon [[avalanche photodiode]]s (Si APD). The technique depends on simultaneous or coincident detection of the pair of photons moving in approximately opposite directions (they would be exactly opposite in their [[center of mass frame]], but the scanner has no way to know this, and so has a built-in slight direction-error tolerance). Photons that do not arrive in temporal \"pairs\" (i.e. within a timing-window of a few nanoseconds) are ignored.\n\n=== Localization of the positron annihilation event ===\nThe most significant fraction of electron\u2013positron annihilations results in two 511 keV gamma photons being emitted at almost 180 degrees to each other; hence, it is possible to localize their source along a straight line of coincidence (also called the '''line of response''', or '''LOR'''). In practice, the LOR has a non-zero width as the emitted photons are not exactly 180 degrees apart. If the resolving time of the detectors is less than 500 [[picoseconds]] rather than about 10 [[nanoseconds]], it is possible to localize the event to a segment of a [[Chord (geometry)|chord]], whose length is determined by the detector timing resolution. As the timing resolution improves, the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR) of the image will improve, requiring fewer events to achieve the same image quality. This technology is not yet common, but it is available on some new systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/news/News_Releases/jun06/PETCTITC.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628052004/http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/news/News_Releases/jun06/PETCTITC.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 28, 2006 |title=Invitation to Cover: Advancements in \"Time-of-Flight\" Technology Make New PET/CT Scanner at Penn a First in the World |date=June 15, 2006 |accessdate=February 22, 2010 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania }}</ref>\n\n=== Image reconstruction ===\nThe raw data collected by a PET scanner are a list of 'coincidence events' representing near-simultaneous detection (typically, within a window of 6 to 12 nanoseconds of each other) of annihilation photons by a pair of detectors. Each coincidence event represents a line in space connecting the two detectors along which the positron emission occurred (i.e., the line of response (LOR)).\n\nAnalytical techniques, much like the reconstruction of [[computed tomography]] (CT) and [[single-photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT) data, are commonly used, although the [[data set]] collected in PET is much poorer than CT, so reconstruction techniques are more difficult. Coincidence events can be grouped into projection images, called [[Radon transform|sinograms]]. The sinograms are sorted by the angle of each view and tilt (for 3D images). The sinogram images are analogous to the projections captured by [[computed tomography]] (CT) scanners, and can be reconstructed in a similar way. The statistics of data thereby obtained are much worse than those obtained through transmission tomography. A normal PET data set has millions of counts for the whole acquisition, while the CT can reach a few billion counts. This contributes to PET images appearing \"noisier\" than CT. Two major sources of noise in PET are scatter (a detected pair of photons, at least one of which was deflected from its original path by interaction with matter in the field of view, leading to the pair being assigned to an incorrect LOR) and random events (photons originating from two different annihilation events but incorrectly recorded as a coincidence pair because their arrival at their respective detectors occurred within a coincidence timing window).\n\nIn practice, considerable pre-processing of the data is required\u2014correction for random coincidences, estimation and subtraction of [[compton scatter|scattered]] photons, detector [[Dead time|dead-time]] correction (after the detection of a photon, the detector must \"cool down\" again) and detector-sensitivity correction (for both inherent detector sensitivity and changes in sensitivity due to angle of incidence).\n\n[[Filtered back projection]] (FBP) has been frequently used to reconstruct images from the projections. This algorithm has the advantage of being simple while having a low requirement for computing resources. Disadvantages are that [[shot noise]] in the raw data is prominent in the reconstructed images, and areas of high tracer uptake tend to form streaks across the image. Also, FBP treats the data deterministically\u2014it does not account for the inherent randomness associated with PET data, thus requiring all the pre-reconstruction corrections described above.\n\n'''Statistical, likelihood-based approaches''':\nStatistical, likelihood-based <ref>{{cite journal|last=Carson|first=Lange|author2=Richard Carson |title=EM reconstruction algorithm for emission and transmission tomography|journal=Journal of Computer Assisted Tomography|date=1984|volume=8|issue=2|pages=306\u2013316|pmid=6608535}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Vardi|first=Y.|author2=L.

These algorithms compute an estimate of the likely distribution of annihilation events that led to the measured data, based on statistical principles. The advantage is a better noise profile and resistance to the streak artifacts common with FBP, but the disadvantage is higher computer resource requirements. A further advantage of statistical image reconstruction techniques is that the physical effects that would need to be pre-corrected for when using an analytical reconstruction algorithm, such as scattered photons, random coincidences, attenuation and detector dead-time, can be incorporated into the likelihood model being used in the reconstruction, allowing for additional noise reduction. Iterative reconstruction has also been shown to result in improvements in the resolution of the reconstructed images, since more sophisticated models of the scanner Physics can be incorporated into the likelihood model than those used by analytical reconstruction methods, allowing for improved quantification of the radioactivity distribution.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Qi|first=J.|author2=R.

As different LORs must traverse different thicknesses of tissue, the photons are attenuated differentially. The result is that structures deep in the body are reconstructed as having falsely low tracer uptake. Contemporary scanners can estimate attenuation using integrated [[x-ray]] CT equipment, in place of earlier equipment that offered a crude form of CT using a [[gamma ray]] ([[positron]] emitting) source and the PET detectors.\n\nWhile attenuation-corrected images are generally more faithful representations, the correction process is itself susceptible to significant artifacts. As a result, both corrected and uncorrected images are always reconstructed and read together.\n\n'''2D/3D reconstruction''': Early PET scanners had only a single ring of detectors, hence the acquisition of data and subsequent reconstruction was restricted to a single transverse plane. More modern scanners now include multiple rings, essentially forming a cylinder of detectors.\n\nThere are two approaches to reconstructing data from such a scanner: 1) treat each ring as a separate entity, so that only coincidences within a ring are detected, the image from each ring can then be reconstructed individually (2D reconstruction), or 2) allow coincidences to be detected between rings as well as within rings, then reconstruct the entire volume together (3D).\n\n3D techniques have better sensitivity (because more coincidences are detected and used) and therefore less noise, but are more sensitive to the effects of scatter and random coincidences, as well as requiring correspondingly greater computer resources. The advent of sub-nanosecond timing resolution detectors affords better random coincidence rejection, thus favoring 3D image reconstruction.\n\n'''Time-of-flight (TOF) PET''': For modern systems with a higher time resolution (roughly 3 nanoseconds) a technique called \"Time-of-flight\" is used to improve the overall performance. Time-of-flight PET makes use of very fast gamma-ray detectors and data processing system which can more precisely decide the difference in time between the detection of the two photons. Although it is technically impossible to localize the point of origin of the annihilation event exactly (currently within 10&nbsp;cm) thus image reconstruction is still needed, TOF technique gives a remarkable improvement in image quality, especially signal-to-noise ratio.\n\n=== Combination of PET with CT or MRI ===\n{{Main|PET-CT|PET-MRI}}\n[[File:Viewer medecine nucleaire keosys.JPG|thumb|left|Complete body PET-CT fusion image]]\n[[File:PET-MR2-Head-Keosys.JPG|thumb|right|Brain PET-MRI fusion image]]\nPET scans are increasingly read alongside CT or [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) scans, with the combination (called [[Image registration|\"co-registration\"]]) giving both anatomic and metabolic information (i.e., what the structure is, and what it is doing biochemically). Because PET imaging is most useful in combination with anatomical imaging, such as CT, modern PET scanners are now available with integrated high-end multi-detector-row CT scanners (so-called \"PET-CT\"). Because the two scans can be performed in immediate sequence during the same session, with the patient not changing position between the two types of scans, the two sets of images are more precisely [[image registration|registered]], so that areas of abnormality on the PET imaging can be more perfectly correlated with anatomy on the CT images. This is very useful in showing detailed views of moving organs or structures with higher anatomical variation, which is more common outside the brain.\n\nAt the [[Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich|J\u00fclich]] Institute of Neurosciences and Biophysics, the world's largest PET-MRI device began operation in April 2009: a 9.4-[[Tesla (unit)|tesla]] magnetic resonance tomograph (MRT) combined with a positron emission tomograph (PET).

Since the tracers are radioactive, the elderly{{Dubious|date=January 2020}} and pregnant are unable to use it due to risks posed by radiation.\n\nLimitations to the widespread use of PET arise from the high costs of [[cyclotrons]] needed to produce the short-lived [[radionuclide]]s for PET scanning and the need for specially adapted on-site chemical synthesis apparatus to produce the radiopharmaceuticals after radioisotope preparation. Organic radiotracer molecules that will contain a positron-emitting radioisotope cannot be synthesized first and then the radioisotope prepared within them, because bombardment with a cyclotron to prepare the radioisotope destroys any organic carrier for it. Instead, the isotope must be prepared first, then afterward, the chemistry to prepare any organic radiotracer (such as [[Fludeoxyglucose (18F)|FDG]]) accomplished very quickly, in the short time before the isotope decays. Few hospitals and universities are capable of maintaining such systems, and most clinical PET is supported by third-party suppliers of radiotracers that can supply many sites simultaneously. This limitation restricts clinical PET primarily to the use of tracers labelled with fluorine-18, which has a half-life of 110 minutes and can be transported a reasonable distance before use, or to rubidium-82 (used as [[rubidium-82 chloride]]) with a half-life of 1.27 minutes, which is created in a portable generator and is used for [[myocardium|myocardial]] [[perfusion]] studies. Nevertheless, in recent years a few on-site cyclotrons with integrated shielding and \"hot labs\" (automated chemistry labs that are able to work with radioisotopes) have begun to accompany PET units to remote hospitals. The presence of the small on-site cyclotron promises to expand in the future as the cyclotrons shrink in response to the high cost of isotope transportation to remote PET machines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medicalimagingmag.com/issues/articles/2003-07_05.asp |title=Technology |author=Lisa Fratt |date=July 2003 |website=Medical Imaging |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120152623/http://www.medicalimagingmag.com/issues/articles/2003-07_05.asp |archive-date=November 20, 2008 }}</ref> In recent years the shortage of PET scans has been alleviated in the US, as rollout of radiopharmacies to supply radioisotopes has grown 30%/year.<ref>{{cite web |title=PET History and Overview |date=January 16, 2013 |url=http://www.crump.ucla.edu/start/course/Lecture%206%20-%20PET%20History%20and%20Overview.pdf |author=Michael Phelps |publisher=Crump Institute for Molecular Imaging |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518082954/http://www.crump.ucla.edu/start/course/Lecture%206%20-%20PET%20History%20and%20Overview.pdf |archive-date=May 18, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nBecause the half-life of fluorine-18 is about two hours, the prepared dose of a radiopharmaceutical bearing this radionuclide will undergo multiple half-lives of decay during the working day.

PET is mainly used in the area of [[medical imaging]] for detecting or measuring changes in [[physiological]] activities like [[metabolism]], blood flow, regional chemical composition, and absorption, and therefore, also called a [[functional imaging]] technique.\n\nSince this PET technique uses radioactive materials (also known as a [[Radiotracer|tracer]] or radio-tracer) for imaging, it is generally categorized within the field of [[nuclear medicine]]. A tracer is injected into the body, which gets trapped within the tissues of interest. The unstable nucleus of [[Radioligand|radio-ligand]] emit positrons, which combine with neighbouring electrons to produce [[gamma ray]]s in the opposite direction at 180 degrees to each other. These gamma rays are detected by the ring of detector placed within the donut-shaped body of the scanner. The energy and location of these gamma rays are recorded and used by a computer program to reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) images of tracer concentration within the body.\n\nIn modern [[PET-CT|PET computed tomography]] scanners, PET images are often reconstructed with the aid of a [[CT scan|computed tomography X-ray scan]] performed on the patient during the same session, in the same machine. Different tracers are used for various imaging purposes, depending on the target process within the body. For example, [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG is commonly used to detect cancer, [<sup>18</sup>F]NaF is widely used for detecting bone formation, and <sup>15</sup>OH<sub>2</sub>O is used to measure blood flow.\n\n[[Fludeoxyglucose (18F)|Fluorodeoxyglucose]] (FDG) is an [[Structural analog|analogue]] of [[glucose]] and the most commonly used tracer molecule for PET. The concentrations of imaged FDG tracer indicate tissue metabolic activity as it corresponds to the regional glucose uptake. [[Metabolic trapping]] of the radioactive glucose molecule allows the PET scan to be utilized. FDG is used to explore the possibility of cancer spreading to other body sites ([[cancer]] [[metastasis]]). These FDG-PET scans for detecting cancer metastasis are the most common in standard medical care (representing 90% of current scans). The same tracer may also be used for the diagnosis of types of [[dementia]]. Less often, other [[radioactive tracers]], usually but not always labelled with [[fluorine-18]], are used to image the tissue concentration of different kinds of molecules of interest inside the body.\n\nOne of the disadvantages of PET scanners is its operating cost.<ref name=\"Carlson 151\">{{cite book | last = Carlson | first = Neil | title = Physiology of Behavior | publisher = Pearson | series = Methods and Strategies of Research | volume = 11th edition | date = January 22, 2012 | page = 151 | isbn = 978-0205239399}}</ref> It can cost up to $8.2 million to set up a complete PET scan unit, and well over a million to obtain approximately 3000 scans per year, depending upon the local cost of living.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Akbari Sari|first=Ali|last2=Ravaghi|first2=Hamid|last3=Mobinizadeh|first3=Mohammadreza|last4=Sarvari|first4=Sima|date=2013-05-20|title=The Cost-Utility Analysis of PET-Scan in Diagnosis and Treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma in Iran|url=http://iranjradiol.com/en/articles/75126.html|journal=Iranian Journal of Radiology|volume=10|issue=2|pages=XX\u2013XX|doi=10.5812/iranjradiol.8559|issn=1735-1065|pmc=3767016|pmid=24046780}}</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:16slicePETCT.jpg|thumb|PET/CT-System with 16-slice CT; the ceiling mounted device is an injection pump for CT contrast agent]]\nPET is both a medical and research tool used in pre-clinical and clinical settings. It is used heavily in the imaging of [[tumour]]s and the search for [[metastasis|metastases]] within the field of clinical [[oncology]], and for the clinical diagnosis of certain diffuse brain diseases such as those causing various types of dementias. PET is a valuable research tool to learn and enhance our knowledge of the normal human brain, heart function, and support drug development. PET is also used in pre-clinical studies using animals. It allows repeated investigations into the same subjects over time, where subjects can act as their own control and substantially reduces the numbers of animals required for a given study. This approach allows research studies to reduce the sample size needed while increasing the statistical quality of its results.\n\nPhysiological processes lead to anatomical changes in the body. Since PET is capable of detecting [[molecular biology]], PET can provide molecular-level information much before any anatomic changes are visible. PET scanning does this by using radiolabelled molecular probes that have different rates of uptake depending on the type and function of tissue involved. Regional tracer uptake in various anatomic structures can be visualized and relatively quantified in terms of injected positron emitter within a PET scan.\n\nPET imaging is best performed using a dedicated PET scanner. It is also possible to acquire PET images using a conventional dual-head [[gamma camera]] fitted with a coincidence detector. The quality of gamma-camera PET imaging is lower, and the scans take longer to acquire. However, this method allows a low-cost on-site solution to institutions with low PET scanning demand. An alternative would be to refer these patients to another center or relying on a visit by a mobile scanner.\n\nAlternative methods of [[medical imaging]] include [[x-ray]] [[computed tomography]] (CT), [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[ultrasound]], and [[single-photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT). [[Single-photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT) is an imaging technique similar to PET that uses [[radioligand]]s to detect molecules in the body. SPECT is less expensive and provides inferior image quality than PET.\n\n===Oncology===\n[[File:PET-MIPS-anim.gif|thumb|Whole-body PET scan using <sup>18</sup>F-FDG.

In addition, a large metastatic tumor mass from colon cancer is seen in the liver.]]\nPET scanning with the tracer [[fluorine-18]] (<sup>18</sup>F) [[fluorodeoxyglucose]] (FDG), called FDG-PET, is widely used in clinical [[oncology]]. FDG is a [[glucose]] [[analog (chemistry)|analog]] that is taken up by glucose-using cells and phosphorylated by [[hexokinase]] (whose [[mitochondrial]] form is significantly elevated in rapidly growing [[malignant]] tumours). A typical dose of FDG used in an oncological scan has an effective radiation dose of 7.6&nbsp;[[mSv]].<ref name=\"Exposure\">ARSAC - Notes for Guidance on the Clinical Administration of Radiopharmaceuticals and use of Sealed Sources (March 2018 p.35)</ref> Because the hydroxyl group that is replaced by fluorine-18 to generate FDG is required for the next step in [[Glycolysis#Sequence of reactions|glucose metabolism]] in all cells, no further reactions occur in FDG. Furthermore, most tissues (with the notable exception of liver and kidneys) cannot remove the [[phosphate]] added by [[hexokinase]]. This means that FDG is trapped in any cell that takes it up until it decays, since [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] sugars, due to their ionic charge, cannot exit from the cell. This results in intense radiolabeling of tissues with high glucose uptake, such as the normal brain, liver, kidneys, and most cancers. As a result, FDG-PET can be used for diagnosis, staging, and monitoring treatment of cancers, particularly in [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zaucha|first=Jan Maciej|last2=Chauvie|first2=Stephane|last3=Zaucha|first3=Renata|last4=Biggii|first4=Alberto|last5=Gallamini|first5=Andrea|date=July 2019|title=The role of PET/CT in the modern treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0305737219300805|journal=Cancer Treatment Reviews|language=en|volume=77|pages=44\u201356|doi=10.1016/j.ctrv.2019.06.002}}</ref> [[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McCarten|first=Kathleen M.|last2=Nadel|first2=Helen R.|last3=Shulkin|first3=Barry L.|last4=Cho|first4=Steve Y.|date=October 2019|title=Imaging for diagnosis, staging and response assessment of Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00247-019-04529-8|journal=Pediatric Radiology|language=en|volume=49|issue=11|pages=1545\u20131564|doi=10.1007/s00247-019-04529-8|issn=0301-0449}}</ref> and [[lung cancer]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pauls|first=S.|last2=Buck|first2=A.

What is actually measured indirectly is the flow of blood to different parts of the brain, which is, in general, believed to be correlated, and has been measured using the tracer [[oxygen]]-15. Because of its 2-minute half-life, O-15 must be piped directly from a medical [[cyclotron]] for such uses, which is difficult. \n**'''Example''': In practice, since the brain is normally a rapid user of glucose, and since brain pathologies such as [[Alzheimer's disease|'''Alzheimer's''' disease]] greatly decrease brain metabolism of both glucose and oxygen in tandem, standard FDG-PET of the brain, which measures regional glucose use, may also be successfully used to differentiate Alzheimer's disease from other dementing processes, and also to make early diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease. The advantage of FDG-PET for these uses is its much wider availability. Some radioactive tracers used for Alzheimer's are [[Florbetapir (18F)|florbetapir F18]], [[Flutemetamol (18F)|flutemetamol F18]], and [[Florbetaben (18F)|florbetabenF18]], which are all used to detect [[Amyloid beta|amyloid-beta]] plaques (a potential biomarker for Alzheimer's) in the brain.\n**'''Examples''': PET imaging with FDG can also be used for localization of '''seizure''' focus: A seizure focus will appear as hypometabolic during an interictal scan. Several [[radiotracer]]s (i.e. [[radioligand]]s) have been developed for PET that are [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] for specific [[neuroreceptor]] subtypes such as [<sup>11</sup>C] [[raclopride]], [<sup>18</sup>F] [[fallypride]] and [<sup>18</sup>F] [[desmethoxyfallypride]] for [[dopamine]] D2/D3 receptors, [<sup>11</sup>C] McN 5652 and [<sup>11</sup>C] [[DASB]] for [[serotonin transporter]]s, [<sup>18</sup>F] [[Mefway]] for serotonin [[5-HT1A receptor|5HT1A receptors]], [<sup>18</sup>F] [[Nifene]] for [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s or enzyme substrates (e.g. 6-[[FDOPA]] for the [[Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase|AADC enzyme]]).

Such scans are referred to as biodistribution studies. The information regarding dug uptake, retention and elimination over time can be obtained quickly and cost-effectively compare to the older technique of killing and dissecting the animals. Commonly, drug occupancy at a purported site of action can be inferred indirectly by competition studies between unlabeled drug and radiolabeled compounds known apriori to bind with specificity to the site. A single radioligand can be used this way to test many potential drug candidates for the same target. A related technique involves scanning with radioligands that compete with an endogenous (naturally occurring) substance at a given receptor to demonstrate that a drug causes the release of the natural substance.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Laruelle, M |title = Imaging Synaptic Neurotransmission with ''in Vivo'' Binding Competition Techniques: A Critical Review | journal = Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism | volume = 20 | issue = 3 |pages = 423\u2013451 | date =2000 | pmid = 10724107 | doi = 10.1097/00004647-200003000-00001 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n===Small animal imaging===\nA miniature PE tomograph has been constructed that is small enough for a fully conscious and mobile rat to wear on its head while walking around.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chemistry.bnl.gov/ratcap/gallery.html |title=Rat Conscious Animal PET |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305072444/http://www.chemistry.bnl.gov/ratcap/gallery.html |archive-date=March 5, 2012 }}</ref> This RatCAP (Rat Conscious Animal PET) allows animals to be scanned without the confounding effects of [[anesthesia]].

The procedure also requires the technically demanding task of calibrating the well counter counts with the PET scanner units used for the image quantification. The well counter counts the activity in the blood samples and the corrected values are converted into the same units as the PET dataset from the scanner using the calibration factor. The measurement of Ki from dynamic PET scans requires tracer kinetic modelling to obtain the model parameters describing the biological processes, which is a computationally intensive task.

It involves three steps in deriving the physiological parameters of interest (Buvat, 2007) which are outlined as follows: \n\n[[File:Screenshot from 2020-04-21 14-34-20.png|thumb|450x450px|Hawkins compartmental model describing the [<sup>18</sup>F]NaF tracer kinetics. ECF=Extracellular fluid.]]\n\n# Measurement of the arterial input function (AIF) in order to measure the concentration of [<sup>18</sup>F]NaF in plasma over time is measured which acts as the first input to the mathematical model of [<sup>18</sup>F]NaF distribution.\n# Measurement of the radiotracer distribution in the skeletal ROI over time which is called a time-activity curve (TAC). The skeletal ROI is placed on the PET image to measure the bone TAC which acts as the second input to the mathematical model of [<sup>18</sup>F]NaF distribution.\n# Mathematical modelling which describes the biological distribution of the tracer in the target tissue to calculate the parameters describing the rate of exchange of tracer within the compartments. This step fits the two inputs obtained in the previous two steps to the mathematical equation describing the [<sup>18</sup>F]NaF kinetics in bone and obtains the individual rate parameters.

These radionuclides are incorporated either into compounds normally used by the body such as [[glucose]] (or glucose analogues), [[water]], or [[ammonia]], or into molecules that bind to receptors or other sites of drug action. Such labelled compounds are known as [[radiotracer]]s. PET technology can be used to trace the biologic pathway of any compound in living humans (and many other species as well), provided it can be radiolabeled with a PET isotope. Thus, the specific processes that can be probed with PET are virtually limitless, and radiotracers for new target molecules and processes are continuing to be synthesized; as of this writing there are already dozens in clinical use and hundreds applied in research. At present,{{when|date=February 2018}} by far the most commonly used radiotracer in clinical PET scanning is [[fluorodeoxyglucose]] (also called FDG or fludeoxyglucose), an analogue of glucose that is labeled with fluorine-18. This radiotracer is used in essentially all scans for oncology and most scans in neurology, and thus makes up the large majority of all of the radiotracer (> 95%) used in PET and PET-CT scanning.\n\nDue to the short half-lives of most positron-emitting radioisotopes, the radiotracers have traditionally been produced using a [[cyclotron]] in close proximity to the PET imaging facility. The half-life of fluorine-18 is long enough that radiotracers labeled with fluorine-18 can be manufactured commercially at offsite locations and shipped to imaging centers. Recently [[rubidium]]-82 generators have become commercially available.<ref>Bracco Diagnostics, [http://www.nuclearonline.org/PI/Cardiogen.pdf CardioGen-82], 2000</ref> These contain strontium-82, which decays by [[electron capture]] to produce positron-emitting rubidium-82.\n\n=== Emission ===\n[[File:PET-schema.png|thumb|right|Schema of a PET acquisition process]]\nTo conduct the scan, a short-lived radioactive tracer [[isotope]] is injected into the living subject (usually into blood circulation). Each tracer atom has been chemically incorporated into a biologically active molecule. There is a waiting period while the active molecule becomes concentrated in tissues of interest; then the subject is placed in the imaging scanner. The molecule most commonly used for this purpose is F-18 labeled [[fluorodeoxyglucose]] (FDG), a sugar, for which the waiting period is typically an hour. During the scan, a record of tissue concentration is made as the tracer decays.\n\nAs the radioisotope undergoes [[positron emission]] decay (also known as positive [[beta decay]]), it emits a positron, an antiparticle of the [[electron]] with opposite charge. The emitted positron travels in tissue for a short distance (typically less than 1&nbsp;mm, but dependent on the isotope<ref>{{cite book | title=PET: physics, instrumentation, and scanners|author=Michael E.

These are detected when they reach a [[scintillator]] in the scanning device, creating a burst of light which is detected by [[photomultiplier]] tubes or silicon [[avalanche photodiode]]s (Si APD). The technique depends on simultaneous or coincident detection of the pair of photons moving in approximately opposite directions (they would be exactly opposite in their [[center of mass frame]], but the scanner has no way to know this, and so has a built-in slight direction-error tolerance). Photons that do not arrive in temporal \"pairs\" (i.e. within a timing-window of a few nanoseconds) are ignored.\n\n=== Localization of the positron annihilation event ===\nThe most significant fraction of electron\u2013positron annihilations results in two 511 keV gamma photons being emitted at almost 180 degrees to each other; hence, it is possible to localize their source along a straight line of coincidence (also called the '''line of response''', or '''LOR'''). In practice, the LOR has a non-zero width as the emitted photons are not exactly 180 degrees apart. If the resolving time of the detectors is less than 500 [[picoseconds]] rather than about 10 [[nanoseconds]], it is possible to localize the event to a segment of a [[Chord (geometry)|chord]], whose length is determined by the detector timing resolution. As the timing resolution improves, the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR) of the image will improve, requiring fewer events to achieve the same image quality. This technology is not yet common, but it is available on some new systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/news/News_Releases/jun06/PETCTITC.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628052004/http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/news/News_Releases/jun06/PETCTITC.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 28, 2006 |title=Invitation to Cover: Advancements in \"Time-of-Flight\" Technology Make New PET/CT Scanner at Penn a First in the World |date=June 15, 2006 |accessdate=February 22, 2010 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania }}</ref>\n\n=== Image reconstruction ===\nThe raw data collected by a PET scanner are a list of 'coincidence events' representing near-simultaneous detection (typically, within a window of 6 to 12 nanoseconds of each other) of annihilation photons by a pair of detectors. Each coincidence event represents a line in space connecting the two detectors along which the positron emission occurred (i.e., the line of response (LOR)).\n\nAnalytical techniques, much like the reconstruction of [[computed tomography]] (CT) and [[single-photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT) data, are commonly used, although the [[data set]] collected in PET is much poorer than CT, so reconstruction techniques are more difficult. Coincidence events can be grouped into projection images, called [[Radon transform|sinograms]]. The sinograms are sorted by the angle of each view and tilt (for 3D images). The sinogram images are analogous to the projections captured by [[computed tomography]] (CT) scanners, and can be reconstructed in a similar way. The statistics of data thereby obtained are much worse than those obtained through transmission tomography. A normal PET data set has millions of counts for the whole acquisition, while the CT can reach a few billion counts. This contributes to PET images appearing \"noisier\" than CT. Two major sources of noise in PET are scatter (a detected pair of photons, at least one of which was deflected from its original path by interaction with matter in the field of view, leading to the pair being assigned to an incorrect LOR) and random events (photons originating from two different annihilation events but incorrectly recorded as a coincidence pair because their arrival at their respective detectors occurred within a coincidence timing window).\n\nIn practice, considerable pre-processing of the data is required\u2014correction for random coincidences, estimation and subtraction of [[compton scatter|scattered]] photons, detector [[Dead time|dead-time]] correction (after the detection of a photon, the detector must \"cool down\" again) and detector-sensitivity correction (for both inherent detector sensitivity and changes in sensitivity due to angle of incidence).\n\n[[Filtered back projection]] (FBP) has been frequently used to reconstruct images from the projections. This algorithm has the advantage of being simple while having a low requirement for computing resources. Disadvantages are that [[shot noise]] in the raw data is prominent in the reconstructed images, and areas of high tracer uptake tend to form streaks across the image. Also, FBP treats the data deterministically\u2014it does not account for the inherent randomness associated with PET data, thus requiring all the pre-reconstruction corrections described above.\n\n'''Statistical, likelihood-based approaches''':\nStatistical, likelihood-based <ref>{{cite journal|last=Carson|first=Lange|author2=Richard Carson |title=EM reconstruction algorithm for emission and transmission tomography|journal=Journal of Computer Assisted Tomography|date=1984|volume=8|issue=2|pages=306\u2013316|pmid=6608535}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Vardi|first=Y.|author2=L.

These algorithms compute an estimate of the likely distribution of annihilation events that led to the measured data, based on statistical principles. The advantage is a better noise profile and resistance to the streak artifacts common with FBP, but the disadvantage is higher computer resource requirements. A further advantage of statistical image reconstruction techniques is that the physical effects that would need to be pre-corrected for when using an analytical reconstruction algorithm, such as scattered photons, random coincidences, attenuation and detector dead-time, can be incorporated into the likelihood model being used in the reconstruction, allowing for additional noise reduction. Iterative reconstruction has also been shown to result in improvements in the resolution of the reconstructed images, since more sophisticated models of the scanner Physics can be incorporated into the likelihood model than those used by analytical reconstruction methods, allowing for improved quantification of the radioactivity distribution.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Qi|first=J.|author2=R.

As different LORs must traverse different thicknesses of tissue, the photons are attenuated differentially. The result is that structures deep in the body are reconstructed as having falsely low tracer uptake. Contemporary scanners can estimate attenuation using integrated [[x-ray]] CT equipment, in place of earlier equipment that offered a crude form of CT using a [[gamma ray]] ([[positron]] emitting) source and the PET detectors.\n\nWhile attenuation-corrected images are generally more faithful representations, the correction process is itself susceptible to significant artifacts. As a result, both corrected and uncorrected images are always reconstructed and read together.\n\n'''2D/3D reconstruction''': Early PET scanners had only a single ring of detectors, hence the acquisition of data and subsequent reconstruction was restricted to a single transverse plane. More modern scanners now include multiple rings, essentially forming a cylinder of detectors.\n\nThere are two approaches to reconstructing data from such a scanner: 1) treat each ring as a separate entity, so that only coincidences within a ring are detected, the image from each ring can then be reconstructed individually (2D reconstruction), or 2) allow coincidences to be detected between rings as well as within rings, then reconstruct the entire volume together (3D).\n\n3D techniques have better sensitivity (because more coincidences are detected and used) and therefore less noise, but are more sensitive to the effects of scatter and random coincidences, as well as requiring correspondingly greater computer resources. The advent of sub-nanosecond timing resolution detectors affords better random coincidence rejection, thus favoring 3D image reconstruction.\n\n'''Time-of-flight (TOF) PET''': For modern systems with a higher time resolution (roughly 3 nanoseconds) a technique called \"Time-of-flight\" is used to improve the overall performance. Time-of-flight PET makes use of very fast gamma-ray detectors and data processing system which can more precisely decide the difference in time between the detection of the two photons. Although it is technically impossible to localize the point of origin of the annihilation event exactly (currently within 10&nbsp;cm) thus image reconstruction is still needed, TOF technique gives a remarkable improvement in image quality, especially signal-to-noise ratio.\n\n=== Combination of PET with CT or MRI ===\n{{Main|PET-CT|PET-MRI}}\n[[File:Viewer medecine nucleaire keosys.JPG|thumb|left|Complete body PET-CT fusion image]]\n[[File:PET-MR2-Head-Keosys.JPG|thumb|right|Brain PET-MRI fusion image]]\nPET scans are increasingly read alongside CT or [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) scans, with the combination (called [[Image registration|\"co-registration\"]]) giving both anatomic and metabolic information (i.e., what the structure is, and what it is doing biochemically). Because PET imaging is most useful in combination with anatomical imaging, such as CT, modern PET scanners are now available with integrated high-end multi-detector-row CT scanners (so-called \"PET-CT\"). Because the two scans can be performed in immediate sequence during the same session, with the patient not changing position between the two types of scans, the two sets of images are more precisely [[image registration|registered]], so that areas of abnormality on the PET imaging can be more perfectly correlated with anatomy on the CT images. This is very useful in showing detailed views of moving organs or structures with higher anatomical variation, which is more common outside the brain.\n\nAt the [[Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich|J\u00fclich]] Institute of Neurosciences and Biophysics, the world's largest PET-MRI device began operation in April 2009: a 9.4-[[Tesla (unit)|tesla]] magnetic resonance tomograph (MRT) combined with a positron emission tomograph (PET).

Since the tracers are radioactive, the elderly{{Dubious|date=January 2020}} and pregnant are unable to use it due to risks posed by radiation.\n\nLimitations to the widespread use of PET arise from the high costs of [[cyclotrons]] needed to produce the short-lived [[radionuclide]]s for PET scanning and the need for specially adapted on-site chemical synthesis apparatus to produce the radiopharmaceuticals after radioisotope preparation. Organic radiotracer molecules that will contain a positron-emitting radioisotope cannot be synthesized first and then the radioisotope prepared within them, because bombardment with a cyclotron to prepare the radioisotope destroys any organic carrier for it. Instead, the isotope must be prepared first, then afterward, the chemistry to prepare any organic radiotracer (such as [[Fludeoxyglucose (18F)|FDG]]) accomplished very quickly, in the short time before the isotope decays. Few hospitals and universities are capable of maintaining such systems, and most clinical PET is supported by third-party suppliers of radiotracers that can supply many sites simultaneously. This limitation restricts clinical PET primarily to the use of tracers labelled with fluorine-18, which has a half-life of 110 minutes and can be transported a reasonable distance before use, or to rubidium-82 (used as [[rubidium-82 chloride]]) with a half-life of 1.27 minutes, which is created in a portable generator and is used for [[myocardium|myocardial]] [[perfusion]] studies. Nevertheless, in recent years a few on-site cyclotrons with integrated shielding and \"hot labs\" (automated chemistry labs that are able to work with radioisotopes) have begun to accompany PET units to remote hospitals. The presence of the small on-site cyclotron promises to expand in the future as the cyclotrons shrink in response to the high cost of isotope transportation to remote PET machines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medicalimagingmag.com/issues/articles/2003-07_05.asp |title=Technology |author=Lisa Fratt |date=July 2003 |website=Medical Imaging |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120152623/http://www.medicalimagingmag.com/issues/articles/2003-07_05.asp |archive-date=November 20, 2008 }}</ref> In recent years the shortage of PET scans has been alleviated in the US, as rollout of radiopharmacies to supply radioisotopes has grown 30%/year.<ref>{{cite web |title=PET History and Overview |date=January 16, 2013 |url=http://www.crump.ucla.edu/start/course/Lecture%206%20-%20PET%20History%20and%20Overview.pdf |author=Michael Phelps |publisher=Crump Institute for Molecular Imaging |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518082954/http://www.crump.ucla.edu/start/course/Lecture%206%20-%20PET%20History%20and%20Overview.pdf |archive-date=May 18, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nBecause the half-life of fluorine-18 is about two hours, the prepared dose of a radiopharmaceutical bearing this radionuclide will undergo multiple half-lives of decay during the working day.

PC-I was the first instrument using this concept and was designed in 1968, completed in 1969 and reported in 1972.

It was, in its original form, an examining body for [[Affiliated school|affiliated colleges]]. The first two of these - [[University College London]] (UCL; founded 1826) and [[King's College London]] (founded 1829) were already in existence and resembled non-collegiate 'unitary' universities, as found in Scotland and continental Europe, except in their lack of degree-awarding powers. There had been much dispute over UCL's attempt to gain recognition as a university, and the University of London was designed as a political solution to put an end to this dispute and to enable the students at both UCL and King's to receive degrees. It was modelled to a certain extent on Cambridge, where (at that time) the senate of the university was responsible for examinations and the colleges for the teaching, and also took on some features of the [[University of France]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.pr/books?id=LmqvAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA76|page=76|author=Negley Harte|title=University of London: An Illustrated History: 1836-1986}}</ref> an institution established under [[Napoleon]] in 1808 that had absorbed the formerly independent French universities as \"academies\" within a single university structure. Unlike Oxford and Cambridge, the affiliated colleges of London (which were spread across the country, not confined to London) were not constituent parts of the university and had no say in its running. Another major difference was that both UCL and King's were non-residential, providing teaching but not accommodation. This would provide the model for the civic colleges that were established in the major English cities, which later became the [[redbrick universities]]. After 1858 the requirement for colleges to be affiliated was dropped and London degrees were available to anyone who could pass the examinations. It was not until 1900 that London, after a period of sustained pressure from the teaching institutions in London, became a federal university. The London pattern spread the idea of the examining university with affiliated colleges around the [[British Empire]], in particular to Canada where the [[University of Toronto]] was refounded as an examining university, its teaching arm becoming [[University College, Toronto]], which federated other colleges in the region,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.pr/books?id=eIi2ciQE2PwC&pg=PA37|pages=37\u201338|title=The University of Toronto: A History|author= Martin L.

This took in three newly established colleges: the Queen's Colleges of [[Queen's College, Belfast|Belfast]], [[Queen's College, Cork|Cork]] and [[Queen's College, Galway|Galway]]. This was more federal than London, but proved inflexible and was replaced in 1880 by the [[Royal University of Ireland]], which was an examining university based more directly on London. Also in 1880 another federal university, the [[Victoria University (UK)|Victoria University]], was established in the north of England to solve the problem of Owen's College, Manchester, seeking university status. This originally just took in Owen's College, but grew to take in university colleges in Leeds and Liverpool. However, it unravelled in 1903-4 after Birmingham successfully became England's first unitary university, with the three colleges all becoming universities in their own right.\n\nThe federal [[University of Wales]] was created in 1893 as a national university for Wales, taking in pre-existing colleges in Aberystwyth, Cardiff and Bangor that had been preparing students for London degrees. It lasted as a federal university until 2007, when it became a confederal non-membership degree-awarding body. The University of Durham became a very curious federal institution in 1908 - its Durham division was itself collegiate, while its Newcastle division had two independent colleges (Armstrong College, the civic university college affiliated to Durham since its creation in 1871, and the Medical College, which had been affiliated since the 1850s). The two colleges of the Newcastle division were merged in 1937, and [[Newcastle University|Newcastle]] finally became an independent university in 1963. Similarly, the university college in [[University of Dundee|Dundee]], founded 1881, became a college of the [[University of St Andrews]] in 1897 before becoming an independent university in 1967.\n\nThe idea of the [[residential college]] spread to America in the early 20th century, with [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[Yale University|Yale]] both establishing colleges (called \"houses\" at Harvard) in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collegiateway.org/colleges/|title=Residential Colleges Worldwide|work=Collegiate Way|author=Robert J.

As these systems often developed from a single original campus, this often became identified as the 'flagship' campus of the state system.\n\n==Types of collegiate university==\n\nAn early typology of British university institutions by the Principal of the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1870 divided them into three types: collegiate (Oxford, Cambridge and Durham), professorial (the Scottish universities &ndash; St Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh &ndash; and the new colleges in Manchester and London) and non-teaching examination boards (London). However, even at that time drawing hard lines was difficult: Oxford had, until a few years prior to this, been an examination board for its colleges, and Trinity College Dublin combined elements of the collegiate and professorial styles.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.pr/books?id=Upc9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA14|page=14|work=Present and Future in Higher Education|publisher=Cambridge University Press|title=The growth of the modern university|author=R.

The level of participation in teaching of colleges in such universities varies: they may provide no formal teaching (e.g. Durham), may provide some teaching to their own students (the Oxbridge model), may provide some teaching that is available university or faculty-wide (e.g. Toronto), or may be responsible for delivering centrally organised, university-wide teaching (e.g. Roehampton). Whatever their role in teaching, almost all are residential communities and they will often have their own halls for meals, libraries, sports teams and societies; such colleges are thus sometimes termed [[residential college]]s. [[Monash University]] in Australia has, however, developed a non-residential college model, and [[New York University]] has similar \"learning communities\" to support non-residential students.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://collegiateway2014.wordpress.com/2014/07/22/should-a-college-be-residential-or-non-residential/|work=Collegiate Way 2014|publisher=Durham University|title=Should a College be Residential or Non-residential?|date=22 July 2014|author=Gay Perez}}</ref> The specifics of how the collegiate system is organised &ndash; whether college membership is necessary for students, whether colleges are legally independent, the role colleges play in admissions, etc. &ndash; vary widely between different universities.\n\nWhile the ancient universities of Oxford and Cambridge consist of independent colleges that supplement the university's teaching with their own tutorials, some universities have built colleges that do not provide teaching but still perform much of the housing and social duties. Such colleges are planned, built and funded entirely by the central administration and are thus dependent on it, however they still retain their own administrative structures and have a degree of independence. This system was pioneered at [[Durham University]] in the United Kingdom in the 1830s, and has been described as \"a far better model for people at other institutions to look to, than are the independent colleges of Oxford and Cambridge\".<ref name=\"O'Hara Durham\"/> This has been widely followed in the US, where the colleges at universities such as Harvard, Yale and Princeton are entirely owned by the central university. Some universities, such as the [[University of Otago]] in New Zealand, [[Durham University]] in the UK and the [[University of Pavia]] in Italy have a mix of independent and university-owned (or, in the case of Pavia, state-owned) colleges.\n\nIn many collegiate universities, following the pattern of Oxford and Cambridge, membership of a college is obligatory for students, but in others it is either not necessary or only necessary for students in particular faculties, e.g. at the University of Toronto, where the colleges are all associated with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.utoronto.ca/academics/academic-units|title=Academic Units|publisher=University of Toronto|accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Non-centralised teaching collegiate universities===\n{{Gallery\n|title=The two founding colleges of the federal [[University of London]]\n|align=right\n|File:Strand102.jpg\n|[[King's College London]]\n|File:UCL Portico Building.jpg\n|[[University College London]]\n}}\n\nSometimes, as noted above, referred to as ''federal universities'', these are universities where the teaching function is entirely carried out by constituent colleges, which will often have their own faculties and departments. This is represented by examples such as Oxford and Cambridge up to the mid 19th century, the University of Wales from 1893 to 2007, and the University of London from 1900. The level of legal separation &ndash; e.g. whether the colleges are separate corporate bodies &ndash; varies between universities. As the colleges are primarily teaching institutions, they may not always be residential communities and many are effectively universities in their own right.\n\nSome colleges are part of loose federations that allow them to exercise nearly complete self-governance, and even (as in the case of colleges of the [[University of London]]) award their own degrees. Other colleges are not legally separate from their parent university, e.g. the [[University of the Arts, London]] (UAL) in the UK and many [[State University systems of the USA|state university systems]] in the US. In some US state systems, a \"[[Flagship#University|flagship campus]]\" may be identified &ndash; often the original campus of the system &ndash; which is considered (either officially or informally) to stand above the other campuses in the system (e.g. [[University of Wisconsin Madison]], [[University of Colorado Boulder]]).\n\nSome universities may have centralised teaching but also have colleges that do not access that centralised teaching. Historically, this was the case at [[Durham University]] for the medical school and Armstrong College in the late 19th and early 20th century (prior to the formation of a true federal university in 1908) and for University College Stockton from 1994 to 2001. The two colleges of [[Queen's University Belfast]], which is for the main part a unitary university, currently operate in this manner. This should not be confused with the situation where courses at an independent college are validated by a university but the college does not become part of that university, e.g. the relationship between the [[New College of the Humanities]] and [[Southampton Solent University]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/southampton-solent-validate-%C2%A318k-new-college-humanities-degrees |title=Southampton Solent to validate \u00a318K New College of the Humanities degrees: A.

[[University College London]] and [[King's College London]] were for much of the 20th century dependent colleges of the central university, without separate legal identities, and all London colleges received funds through the University of London rather than directly. The trend since the latter half of the 20th century has been for increased decentralisation; taken to its ultimate, this has led some colleges to formally end their relations with the parent university to become degree-awarding universities. Examples include [[Cardiff University]] (formerly the [[University of Wales, Cardiff]]) and [[Imperial College London]] (formerly a college of the University of London). Similarly [[Newcastle University]] was part of the federal [[University of Durham]] until 1963 and the [[University of Dundee]] was a college of the [[University of St Andrews]] until 1967. A number of autonomous universities in [[South Africa]] were formerly colleges of the [[University of South Africa]]. Many of the US state systems started as single campuses but have evolved to become federal systems, and the [[University of the Philippines]] similarly started as one campus but is now a system of \"constituent universities\".\n\n==Collegiate universities around the world==\nThere are around 80 universities around the world with residential college systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/news/newsitem/?itemno=22814|title=Durham launches the UK\u2019s first collegiate universities conference|date=13 November 2014|publisher=Durham University}}</ref>\n\n===Australia===\n\nIn Australia, many universities have [[residential college]] systems, often combining independent (frequently denominational) and university-owned colleges.

While all students of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on the St George campus are members of one of the colleges, students in other undergraduate faculties (Applied Science and Engineering, Architecture, Landscape and Design, Kinesiology and Physical Education, and Music) are only members of colleges if they live in a college residence, and the [[University of Toronto Mississauga]] and [[University of Toronto Scarborough]] are non-collegiate.<ref>{{cite book |title=The University of Toronto and Its Colleges, 1827\u20131906 |last=Alexander |first=William John |year=1906 |publisher=H.

In addition there were private residential halls (Bursen). Parallel to the college system there were four nations ([[university nations]]) similar to the model of the universities of Prague (Leipzig's 'mother' institution, see [[Decree of Kutn\u00e1 Hora]]) and Paris after which they were modelled.

Another major difference was that both UCL and King's were non-residential, providing teaching but not accommodation. This would provide the model for the civic colleges that were established in the major English cities, which later became the [[redbrick universities]]. After 1858 the requirement for colleges to be affiliated was dropped and London degrees were available to anyone who could pass the examinations. It was not until 1900 that London, after a period of sustained pressure from the teaching institutions in London, became a federal university. The London pattern spread the idea of the examining university with affiliated colleges around the [[British Empire]], in particular to Canada where the [[University of Toronto]] was refounded as an examining university, its teaching arm becoming [[University College, Toronto]], which federated other colleges in the region,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.pr/books?id=eIi2ciQE2PwC&pg=PA37|pages=37\u201338|title=The University of Toronto: A History|author= Martin L.

This took in three newly established colleges: the Queen's Colleges of [[Queen's College, Belfast|Belfast]], [[Queen's College, Cork|Cork]] and [[Queen's College, Galway|Galway]]. This was more federal than London, but proved inflexible and was replaced in 1880 by the [[Royal University of Ireland]], which was an examining university based more directly on London. Also in 1880 another federal university, the [[Victoria University (UK)|Victoria University]], was established in the north of England to solve the problem of Owen's College, Manchester, seeking university status. This originally just took in Owen's College, but grew to take in university colleges in Leeds and Liverpool. However, it unravelled in 1903-4 after Birmingham successfully became England's first unitary university, with the three colleges all becoming universities in their own right.\n\nThe federal [[University of Wales]] was created in 1893 as a national university for Wales, taking in pre-existing colleges in Aberystwyth, Cardiff and Bangor that had been preparing students for London degrees. It lasted as a federal university until 2007, when it became a confederal non-membership degree-awarding body. The University of Durham became a very curious federal institution in 1908 - its Durham division was itself collegiate, while its Newcastle division had two independent colleges (Armstrong College, the civic university college affiliated to Durham since its creation in 1871, and the Medical College, which had been affiliated since the 1850s). The two colleges of the Newcastle division were merged in 1937, and [[Newcastle University|Newcastle]] finally became an independent university in 1963. Similarly, the university college in [[University of Dundee|Dundee]], founded 1881, became a college of the [[University of St Andrews]] in 1897 before becoming an independent university in 1967.\n\nThe idea of the [[residential college]] spread to America in the early 20th century, with [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[Yale University|Yale]] both establishing colleges (called \"houses\" at Harvard) in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collegiateway.org/colleges/|title=Residential Colleges Worldwide|work=Collegiate Way|author=Robert J.

As these systems often developed from a single original campus, this often became identified as the 'flagship' campus of the state system.\n\n==Types of collegiate university==\n\nAn early typology of British university institutions by the Principal of the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1870 divided them into three types: collegiate (Oxford, Cambridge and Durham), professorial (the Scottish universities &ndash; St Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh &ndash; and the new colleges in Manchester and London) and non-teaching examination boards (London). However, even at that time drawing hard lines was difficult: Oxford had, until a few years prior to this, been an examination board for its colleges, and Trinity College Dublin combined elements of the collegiate and professorial styles.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.pr/books?id=Upc9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA14|page=14|work=Present and Future in Higher Education|publisher=Cambridge University Press|title=The growth of the modern university|author=R. E.

The level of participation in teaching of colleges in such universities varies: they may provide no formal teaching (e.g. Durham), may provide some teaching to their own students (the Oxbridge model), may provide some teaching that is available university or faculty-wide (e.g. Toronto), or may be responsible for delivering centrally organised, university-wide teaching (e.g. Roehampton). Whatever their role in teaching, almost all are residential communities and they will often have their own halls for meals, libraries, sports teams and societies; such colleges are thus sometimes termed [[residential college]]s. [[Monash University]] in Australia has, however, developed a non-residential college model, and [[New York University]] has similar \"learning communities\" to support non-residential students.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://collegiateway2014.wordpress.com/2014/07/22/should-a-college-be-residential-or-non-residential/|work=Collegiate Way 2014|publisher=Durham University|title=Should a College be Residential or Non-residential?|date=22 July 2014|author=Gay Perez}}</ref> The specifics of how the collegiate system is organised &ndash; whether college membership is necessary for students, whether colleges are legally independent, the role colleges play in admissions, etc. &ndash; vary widely between different universities.\n\nWhile the ancient universities of Oxford and Cambridge consist of independent colleges that supplement the university's teaching with their own tutorials, some universities have built colleges that do not provide teaching but still perform much of the housing and social duties. Such colleges are planned, built and funded entirely by the central administration and are thus dependent on it, however they still retain their own administrative structures and have a degree of independence. This system was pioneered at [[Durham University]] in the United Kingdom in the 1830s, and has been described as \"a far better model for people at other institutions to look to, than are the independent colleges of Oxford and Cambridge\".<ref name=\"O'Hara Durham\"/> This has been widely followed in the US, where the colleges at universities such as Harvard, Yale and Princeton are entirely owned by the central university. Some universities, such as the [[University of Otago]] in New Zealand, [[Durham University]] in the UK and the [[University of Pavia]] in Italy have a mix of independent and university-owned (or, in the case of Pavia, state-owned) colleges.\n\nIn many collegiate universities, following the pattern of Oxford and Cambridge, membership of a college is obligatory for students, but in others it is either not necessary or only necessary for students in particular faculties, e.g. at the University of Toronto, where the colleges are all associated with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.utoronto.ca/academics/academic-units|title=Academic Units|publisher=University of Toronto|accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Non-centralised teaching collegiate universities===\n{{Gallery\n|title=The two founding colleges of the federal [[University of London]]\n|align=right\n|File:Strand102.jpg\n|[[King's College London]]\n|File:UCL Portico Building.jpg\n|[[University College London]]\n}}\n\nSometimes, as noted above, referred to as ''federal universities'', these are universities where the teaching function is entirely carried out by constituent colleges, which will often have their own faculties and departments. This is represented by examples such as Oxford and Cambridge up to the mid 19th century, the University of Wales from 1893 to 2007, and the University of London from 1900. The level of legal separation &ndash; e.g. whether the colleges are separate corporate bodies &ndash; varies between universities. As the colleges are primarily teaching institutions, they may not always be residential communities and many are effectively universities in their own right.\n\nSome colleges are part of loose federations that allow them to exercise nearly complete self-governance, and even (as in the case of colleges of the [[University of London]]) award their own degrees. Other colleges are not legally separate from their parent university, e.g. the [[University of the Arts, London]] (UAL) in the UK and many [[State University systems of the USA|state university systems]] in the US. In some US state systems, a \"[[Flagship#University|flagship campus]]\" may be identified &ndash; often the original campus of the system &ndash; which is considered (either officially or informally) to stand above the other campuses in the system (e.g. [[University of Wisconsin Madison]], [[University of Colorado Boulder]]).\n\nSome universities may have centralised teaching but also have colleges that do not access that centralised teaching. Historically, this was the case at [[Durham University]] for the medical school and Armstrong College in the late 19th and early 20th century (prior to the formation of a true federal university in 1908) and for University College Stockton from 1994 to 2001. The two colleges of [[Queen's University Belfast]], which is for the main part a unitary university, currently operate in this manner. This should not be confused with the situation where courses at an independent college are validated by a university but the college does not become part of that university, e.g. the relationship between the [[New College of the Humanities]] and [[Southampton Solent University]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/southampton-solent-validate-%C2%A318k-new-college-humanities-degrees |title=Southampton Solent to validate \u00a318K New College of the Humanities degrees: A.

[[University College London]] and [[King's College London]] were for much of the 20th century dependent colleges of the central university, without separate legal identities, and all London colleges received funds through the University of London rather than directly. The trend since the latter half of the 20th century has been for increased decentralisation; taken to its ultimate, this has led some colleges to formally end their relations with the parent university to become degree-awarding universities. Examples include [[Cardiff University]] (formerly the [[University of Wales, Cardiff]]) and [[Imperial College London]] (formerly a college of the University of London). Similarly [[Newcastle University]] was part of the federal [[University of Durham]] until 1963 and the [[University of Dundee]] was a college of the [[University of St Andrews]] until 1967. A number of autonomous universities in [[South Africa]] were formerly colleges of the [[University of South Africa]]. Many of the US state systems started as single campuses but have evolved to become federal systems, and the [[University of the Philippines]] similarly started as one campus but is now a system of \"constituent universities\".\n\n==Collegiate universities around the world==\nThere are around 80 universities around the world with residential college systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/news/newsitem/?itemno=22814|title=Durham launches the UK\u2019s first collegiate universities conference|date=13 November 2014|publisher=Durham University}}</ref>\n\n===Australia===\n\nIn Australia, many universities have [[residential college]] systems, often combining independent (frequently denominational) and university-owned colleges.

Toronto has a mix of independent and dependent colleges, all of which offer academic programmes that are available faculty-wide rather that just to members of that college. While all students of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on the St George campus are members of one of the colleges, students in other undergraduate faculties (Applied Science and Engineering, Architecture, Landscape and Design, Kinesiology and Physical Education, and Music) are only members of colleges if they live in a college residence, and the [[University of Toronto Mississauga]] and [[University of Toronto Scarborough]] are non-collegiate.<ref>{{cite book |title=The University of Toronto and Its Colleges, 1827\u20131906 |last=Alexander |first=William John |year=1906 |publisher=H.

Students are assigned to colleges at the end of their first year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://college.harvard.edu/student-residential-life/residential-life/upperclass|title=Upperclassmen|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=3 September 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Yale University]] &ndash; Also established in the 1930s, [[Residential colleges of Yale University|Yale's residential college system]] has 14 colleges which follow the traditional British system of students joining a college when they join the university and remaining a member of that college.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://yalecollege.yale.edu/campus-life/residential-colleges|title=Residential Colleges|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Yale University|access-date=10 April 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Rice University]] &ndash; Established in 1957 with four colleges, [[Residential colleges of Rice University|Rice's residential college system]] now has 11 colleges. Students join a college when they enter the university and retain their membership throughout their time as an undergraduate, with around 75% living in college.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://students.rice.edu/students/Colleges.asp|title=Colleges|publisher=Rice University|accessdate=3 September 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Princeton University]] &ndash; Established in the 1980s, [[Princeton University#Residential colleges|Princeton's residential college system]] has six colleges, three of which house students from all years and the other three only first and second year students. Most students in the third year and above do not live in college accommodation, but retain their links to a college.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/one-community/housing-dining|title=Housing & Dining|publisher=Princeton University|accessdate=3 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://odoc.princeton.edu/about/residential-colleges|title=Residential Colleges| publisher=Princeton University|accessdate=3 September 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Dartmouth College]] &ndash; Established in 2016, Dartmouth's house system has six houses that undergraduates are members of throughout their time at the university.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.dartmouth.edu/news/2015/11/college-unveils-six-house-communities-open-next-fall|title=College Unveils Six House Communities to Open Next Fall|date=November 2015|publisher=Dartmouth College|accessdate=3 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://students.dartmouth.edu/residential-life/house-communities/about-house-system|title=About the House System|publisher=Dartmouth College|accessdate=3 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nMany [[State University systems of the USA|state university systems]] consist of campuses that are legally part of a single corporate body (e.g. the Regents of the University of California are the corporate body for the entire University of California system), but are operationally independent. Examples of such institutions include the [[University of California]], the [[State University of New York]], the [[University of Michigan]], the [[University of Texas System]], and the [[University System of Maryland]].\n\nThe [[Claremont Colleges]] in California operate a hybrid federal-constituent system.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} All 7 colleges are independently governed: [[Pomona College]], [[Scripps College]], [[Claremont McKenna College]], [[Harvey Mudd College]], [[Pitzer College]] as undergraduate colleges as well as [[Claremont Graduate University]] and [[Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences]] as graduate universities. Their founding model was based on that of the University of Oxford and they are linked through the [[Claremont University Consortium]], though, unlike other constituent college systems, degrees are conferred separately by the seven constituent institutions and they exist as [[universities]] and [[liberal arts colleges]] in their own right. The colleges are spread over a square mile site and share certain departmental, library and research facilities. In addition, the five undergraduate colleges operate [[Claremont Colleges#Athletics|two intercollegiate athletic programs]], with Claremont, Harvey Mudd, and Scripps forming one program and Pomona and Pitzer the other.\n\n===Former collegiate universities===\n[[File:Sorbonne 17thc.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The [[University of Paris]] depicted in a 17th-century engraving]]\n\nSome universities that once featured collegiate systems have lost them to mergers or suppression, due to financial, political or other reasons, or (in the case of federal universities) the individual colleges becoming independent universities. Examples include the following:\n\n====Former residential college systems====\n*At the [[University of St Andrews]], the surviving colleges play a purely ceremonial role and are neither teaching nor residential bodies. The three colleges are [[St Mary's College, St Andrews|St Mary's College]] for the Faculty of Divinity and [[United College, St Andrews|United College]] for the other faculties, and [[St Leonard's College (University of St Andrews)|St Leonard's College]] for postgraduates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/divinity/about/|title=About St Mary's College|publisher=University of St Andrews|date=3 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/library/specialcollections/collections/archives/themunimentcollection/collegiaterecords/unitedcollege/|title=United College|publisher=University of St Andrews|date=3 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/pgstudents/stleonards/about/|title=St Leonard's College|publisher=University of St Andrews|date=3 September 2017}}</ref> University College, Dundee was incorporated into St Andrews in 1898 and was merged with the medical school, the dental school and the Dundee School of Economics in 1954 to form Queen's College. This became the independent [[University of Dundee]] in 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/library/specialcollections/collections/archives/themunimentcollection/collegiaterecords/universitycollegedundeequeenscollege/|title=University College, Dundee and Queen's College| publisher=University of St Andrews|date=3 September 2017}}</ref>\n* At the [[University of Coimbra]], independent colleges much like the Oxbridge ones were created throughout the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. They were abolished with the extinction of religious orders in 1836.<ref name=coimbra/>\n*The colleges of the former [[University of Paris]] were suppressed after the [[French Revolution]].<ref name=\"Cathenc Paris\"/>\n*The [[University of Salamanca]] had a large number of colleges (four ''colegios mayores'', or large colleges, and many ''colegios menores'', or small colleges), which were abolished in 1807 when [[Napoleon]] invaded [[Spain]].<ref name=salamanca/>\n*[[Leipzig University]] as an example of a medieval German university (currently the second oldest in the country) was structured into colleges in a similar way. Often they were set up by a particular monastic order to serve its members. Colleges served as places of living and collegiate teaching. They had jurisdiction over their members (i.e. municipal courts of the city of [[Leipzig]] would refuse to hear actions brought against them). In addition there were private residential halls (Bursen). Parallel to the college system there were four nations ([[university nations]]) similar to the model of the universities of Prague (Leipzig's 'mother' institution, see [[Decree of Kutn\u00e1 Hora]]) and Paris after which they were modelled. During the age of enlightenment this structure was abandoned. Still today, the names of the former colleges live on as names of buildings used by the university.\n\n====Former federal universities====\n* The [[Victoria University (UK)|Victoria University]], which split into [[Victoria University of Manchester]], [[University of Liverpool]] and [[University of Leeds]].\n* The [[University of Wales]] was a federal university from its formation in 1893 until 2007, when its colleges became independent and it was transformed into a non-membership accreditation body.\n* The [[Federal University of Surrey]] was, from 2000 to 2004, a federation of the [[University of Surrey]] and the University of Surrey Roehampton (now [[Roehampton University]]). It was dissolved when Roehampton became an independent university.\n* The [[University of France]] was established by Napoleon in 1808 and acted as a central university for the ''acad\u00e9mies'' (the former universities) until 1896, when these were restored to full university status.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lnmDJ1tnooMC&pg=PA306|pages=306\u2013307|title=The Evolution of Educational Thought|volume=2|author=\u00c9mile Durkheim|publisher=Taylor & Francis|date= 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TagwBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA49|title=Meteors that Enlighten the Earth: Napoleon and the Cult of Great Men|page=49|author=Matthew D.

After the [[Second World War]], most of these colleges became autonomous universities, and the University of South Africa became primarily a [[distance education]] institution.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Affiliated school]]\n*[[Residential college]]\n*[[List of residential colleges]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{Reflist |group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:School types]]\n[[Category:Types of university or college]]\n\n[[fr:Coll\u00e8ge f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9]]\n", "name_user": "Okhjon", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:remove wrong :fr: interwiki", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collegiate_university"}
