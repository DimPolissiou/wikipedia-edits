Grand Concourse runs through several neighborhoods, including [[Bedford Park, Bronx|Bedford Park]], [[Concourse, Bronx|Concourse]], [[Highbridge, Bronx|Highbridge]], [[Fordham, Bronx|Fordham]], [[Mott Haven, Bronx|Mott Haven]], [[Norwood, Bronx|Norwood]] and [[Tremont, Bronx|Tremont]]. For most of its length, the Concourse is {{Convert|180|ft||abbr=}} wide.\n\nThe Grand Concourse was designed by Louis Aloys Risse, an immigrant from [[Saint-Avold]], [[Lorraine]], [[France]]. Risse first conceived of the road in 1890, and the Concourse was built between 1894 and 1909, with an additional extension in 1927. The development of the Concourse led to the construction of apartment buildings surrounding the boulevard, and by 1939 it was called \"the [[Park Avenue]] of middle-class Bronx residents\".<ref name=\"Moore 1981\" /> A period of decline followed in the 1960s and 1970s, when these residences became dilapidated and the Concourse was redesigned to be more motorist-friendly. Renovation and redevelopment started in the 1980s, and a portion of the Grand Concourse was reconstructed starting in the 2000s.\n\nThe southern portion of the Grand Concourse is surrounded by several historically important residential buildings, which were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1987 as part of the '''Grand Concourse Historic District'''. In 2011, the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] designated numerous buildings around the Grand Concourse as part of a city landmark district. Additionally, several individual points of interest are located on or near the Concourse, including the [[Bronx Museum of the Arts]] and [[Edgar Allan Poe Cottage]].\n\n== Description ==\nThe Grand Concourse's southern terminus is at 138th Street. Shortly afterward, it merges with the entrance ramp to southbound [[Major Deegan Expressway]] ([[Interstate 87 (New York)|I-87]]), as well as the exit ramp from northbound I-87. The Grand Concourse continues as a divided eight-lane avenue, with two to three traffic lanes in each direction, until 161st Street.<ref name=google/> North of there, the [[frontage road|service roads]] in each direction begin, and a unidirectional buffered [[bike lane]] runs on the left edge of either service road.<ref name=\"NYC Bike Map\">{{cite web | title=NYC DOT Bicycle Map 2018 | website=NYC.gov |publisher=[[New York City Department of Transportation]] |date=2018 | url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/bikemap-2018.pdf| access-date=October 17, 2018}}</ref> The Grand Concourse is briefly a ten-lane boulevard with four roadways, two in each direction, until just south of 165th Street. There, the northbound and southbound inner roadways merge into a five-lane undivided roadway with two lanes in each direction and a left-turn lane and painted median in the center.<ref name=google/> The buffered bike lanes on each service road end at 171st Street, and conventional bike lanes start on the right lane of the respective service roads.<ref name=\"NYC Bike Map\"/> This configuration with three roadways (two service roads and one main road) continues north until [[Mosholu Parkway]], where the Grand Concourse ends.

In 1923, [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] opened near the Grand Concourse at 161st Street, down the hill from the [[Concourse Plaza Hotel]]. South of Fordham Road, the palatial [[Paradise Theater (Bronx)|Loew's Paradise]] theater, one of the [[Loew's Wonder Theatres]] and at one time the largest movie theater in New York City, was constructed in 1929.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fire Badly Damages Paradise Theater, a Bronx Landmark|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/06/nyregion/fire-damages-paradise-theater-a-bronx-landmark.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=November 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\nDevelopment of the Concourse was further encouraged by the opening of the [[Independent Subway System]]'s Concourse Line in 1933. By the mid-1930s, almost three hundred apartment buildings had been built along the Concourse. Customarily five or six stories high with wide entrance courtyards bordered with grass and shrubs, among these apartments are many of the finest examples of [[Art Deco]] and [[Art Moderne]] architecture in the United States. Even though the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], which was happening at the time, ended the period of tremendous growth, privately financed apartment buildings continued to be constructed.

{{Convert|5.2|mi||-long|abbr=|adj=mid}} thoroughfare in the [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[the Bronx]] in [[New York City]]. Grand Concourse runs through several neighborhoods, including [[Bedford Park, Bronx|Bedford Park]], [[Concourse, Bronx|Concourse]], [[Highbridge, Bronx|Highbridge]], [[Fordham, Bronx|Fordham]], [[Mott Haven, Bronx|Mott Haven]], [[Norwood, Bronx|Norwood]] and [[Tremont, Bronx|Tremont]]. For most of its length, the Concourse is {{Convert|180|ft||abbr=}} wide.\n\nThe Grand Concourse was designed by Louis Aloys Risse, an immigrant from [[Saint-Avold]], [[Lorraine]], [[France]]. Risse first conceived of the road in 1890, and the Concourse was built between 1894 and 1909, with an additional extension in 1927. The development of the Concourse led to the construction of apartment buildings surrounding the boulevard, and by 1939 it was called \"the [[Park Avenue]] of middle-class Bronx residents\".<ref name=\"Moore 1981\" /> A period of decline followed in the 1960s and 1970s, when these residences became dilapidated and the Concourse was redesigned to be more motorist-friendly. Renovation and redevelopment started in the 1980s, and a portion of the Grand Concourse was reconstructed starting in the 2000s.\n\nThe southern portion of the Grand Concourse is surrounded by several historically important residential buildings, which were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1987 as part of the '''Grand Concourse Historic District'''. In 2011, the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] designated numerous buildings around the Grand Concourse as part of a city landmark district. Additionally, several individual points of interest are located on or near the Concourse, including the [[Bronx Museum of the Arts]] and [[Edgar Allan Poe Cottage]].\n\n== Description ==\nThe Grand Concourse's southern terminus is at 138th Street. Shortly afterward, it merges with the entrance ramp to southbound [[Major Deegan Expressway]] ([[Interstate 87 (New York)|I-87]]), as well as the exit ramp from northbound I-87. The Grand Concourse continues as a divided eight-lane avenue, with two to three traffic lanes in each direction, until 161st Street.<ref name=google/> North of there, the [[frontage road|service roads]] in each direction begin, and a unidirectional buffered [[bike lane]] runs on the left edge of either service road.<ref name=\"NYC Bike Map\">{{cite web | title=NYC DOT Bicycle Map 2018 | website=NYC.gov |publisher=[[New York City Department of Transportation]] |date=2018 | url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/bikemap-2018.pdf| access-date=October 17, 2018}}</ref> The Grand Concourse is briefly a ten-lane boulevard with four roadways, two in each direction, until just south of 165th Street.

In 1923, [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] opened near the Grand Concourse at 161st Street, down the hill from the [[Concourse Plaza Hotel]]. South of Fordham Road, the palatial [[Paradise Theater (Bronx)|Loew's Paradise]] theater, one of the [[Loew's Wonder Theatres]] and at one time the largest movie theater in New York City, was constructed in 1929.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fire Badly Damages Paradise Theater, a Bronx Landmark|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/06/nyregion/fire-damages-paradise-theater-a-bronx-landmark.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=November 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\nDevelopment of the Concourse was further encouraged by the opening of the [[Independent Subway System]]'s Concourse Line in 1933. By the mid-1930s, almost three hundred apartment buildings had been built along the Concourse. Customarily five or six stories high with wide entrance courtyards bordered with grass and shrubs, among these apartments are many of the finest examples of [[Art Deco]] and [[Art Moderne]] architecture in the United States. Even though the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], which was happening at the time, ended the period of tremendous growth, privately financed apartment buildings continued to be constructed. Furthermore, work was done on the Grand Concourse as part of WPA programs.<ref name=\"encnyc\">{{cite enc-nyc2}}</ref> During this period, the Bronx had more amenities than other boroughs: in 1934, almost 99% of residences had private bathrooms, and 95% had central heating.<ref>{{cite web|title=ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF THE BRONX |url=http://www.bronxhistoricalsociety.org/journal/historyofthebronxjournal.html |accessdate=October 11, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021042529/http://www.bronxhistoricalsociety.org/journal/historyofthebronxjournal.html |archivedate=October 21, 2007 }}</ref> In the 1939 [[American Guide Series|''WPA Guide to New York City'']], the Grand Concourse was described as \"the [[Park Avenue]] of middle-class Bronx residents, and the lease to an apartment in one of its many large buildings is considered evidence of at least moderate business success.\"<ref name=\"Moore 1981\">{{cite book|last=Moore|first=D.D.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=POfJa1DJz9oC&pg=PA76|title=At Home in America: Second Generation New York Jews|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1981|isbn=978-0-231-05063-0|series=Columbia history of urban life|page=76|access-date=April 24, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite fednyc|page=517}}</ref>\n\n=== Decline ===\nIn 1941, the New York City Planning Department proposed converting the boulevard into an expressway, in order to connect the [[Major Deegan Expressway]] and the proposed Park Avenue Expressway to the south with the [[Mosholu Parkway]] to the north.

We have never used sideline video to obtain a competitive advantage while the game was in progress.
