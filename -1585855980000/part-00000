The modern Syrian state was established in the mid-20th century after centuries of [[Ottoman Syria|Ottoman]] and a brief period [[French Mandate for Syria and Lebanon|French mandate]], and represented the largest Arab state to emerge from the formerly [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-ruled [[Ottoman Syria|Syrian provinces]]. It gained ''de jure'' independence as a [[parliamentary republic]] on 24 October 1945, when the [[Syrian Republic (1946\u20131963)|Republic of Syria]] became a founding member of the United Nations, an act which legally ended the former French Mandate, although French troops did not leave the country until April 1946. The post-independence period was tumultuous, with many [[military coup]]s and coup attempts shaking the country from 1949 to 1971. In 1958, Syria entered a brief union with Egypt called the [[United Arab Republic]], which was terminated by the [[1961 Syrian coup d'\u00e9tat]]. The republic was renamed as the Arab Republic of Syria in late 1961 after the [[Syrian constitutional referendum, 1961|December 1 constitutional referendum]] of that year, and was increasingly unstable until the [[1963 Syrian coup d'\u00e9tat|1963 Ba'athist coup d'\u00e9tat]], since which the Ba'ath Party has maintained its power.

From this point, the region became known as [[Aramea]] or [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]]. There was also a synthesis between the Semitic Arameans and the remnants of the Indo-European [[Hittites]], with the founding of a number of [[Syro-Hittite]] states centered in north central Aram (Syria) and south central Asia Minor (modern Turkey), including [[Palistin]], [[Carchemish]] and [[Sam'al]].\n\n[[File:Geretteteg\u00f6tter l\u00f6wen.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|Reliefs from [[Tel Halaf]] dating to the Aramean kingdom of [[Bit Bahiani]] ]]\nA [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] group known as the [[Phoenicians]] came to dominate the coasts of Syria, (and also Lebanon and northern [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]) from the 13th century BC, founding city states such as [[Amrit]], [[Simyra]], [[Arwad]], [[Arab al-Mulk|Paltos]], [[Latakia#Ancient settlement and founding|Ramitha]] and [[Tell Sukas|Shuksi]]. From these coastal regions, they eventually spread their influence throughout the [[Mediterranean]], including building colonies in [[Malta]], Sicily, the [[Iberian peninsula]] (modern Spain and [[Portugal]]), and the coasts of North Africa and most significantly, founding the major city state of [[Carthage]] (in modern [[Tunisia]]) in the 9th century BC, which was much later to become the center of a major empire, rivaling the [[Roman Empire]].\n\nSyria and the Western half of [[Near East]] then fell to the vast [[Neo Assyrian Empire]] (911 BC \u2013 605 BC). The Assyrians introduced [[Imperial Aramaic]] as the [[lingua franca]] of their empire. This language was to remain dominant in Syria and the entire [[Near East]] until after the [[Arab]] [[Islamic]] conquest in the 7th and 8th centuries AD, and was to be a vehicle for the spread of Christianity. The Assyrians named their colonies of Syria and Lebanon [[Eber-Nari]]. Assyrian domination ended after the Assyrians greatly weakened themselves in a series of brutal internal civil wars, followed by an attacks from; the [[Medes]], [[Babylonians]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]]. During the fall of Assyria, the [[Scythians]] ravaged and plundered much of Syria. The last stand of the Assyrian army was at [[Carchemish]] in northern Syria in 605 BC.\n\nThe Assyrian Empire was followed by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] (605 BC \u2013 539 BC).  During this period, Syria became a battle ground between Babylonia and another former Assyrian colony, that of [[Egypt]]. The Babylonians, like their Assyrian relations, were victorious over Egypt.\n\n=== Classical antiquity ===\n{{Main|Eber-Nari|Coele-Syria|Syria (Roman province)|Syria-Palaestina}}\n[[File:Palmyra 03.jpg|thumb|left|Ancient city of [[Palmyra]] before the war]]\n\nThe [[Achaemenid Empire]], founded by [[Cyrus the Great]], annexed [[Eber-Nari|Syria]] along with Babylonia to its empire in 539 BC. The [[Persian people|Persians]], retained Imperial Aramaic as one of the diplomatic languages of the Achaemenid Empire (539 BC \u2013 330 BC), as well as the Assyrian name for the new [[satrapy]] of Aram/Syria [[Eber-Nari]].\n\nSyria was conquered by the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[Macedonian Empire]], ruled by [[Alexander the Great]] circa 330 BC, and consequently became [[Coele-Syria]] province of the [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Seleucid Empire]] (323 BC \u2013 64 BC), with the Seleucid kings styling themselves 'King of Syria' and the city of Antioch being its capital starting from 240.\n\nThus, it was the Greeks who introduced the name \"Syria\" to the region.

Eventually parts of southern Seleucid Syria were taken by [[Judean]] [[Hasmoneans]] upon the slow disintegration of the Hellenistic Empire.\n\nSyria briefly came under [[Armenians|Armenian]] control from 83 BC, with the conquests of the Armenian king [[Tigranes the Great]], who was welcomed as a savior from the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] and Romans by the Syrian people. However, [[Pompey the Great]], a general of the [[Roman Empire]] rode to Syria, captured [[Antioch]], its capital, and turned Syria into a [[Syria (Roman province)|Roman province]] in 64 BC, thus ending the Armenian control over the region which had lasted two decades. Syria prospered under Roman rule, being strategically located on the silk road which gave it massive wealth and importance, making it the battleground for the rivaling Romans and Persians.\n\n[[File:Bosra pano Syria.jpg|thumb|[[Roman Theatre at Bosra]] in the province of [[Arabia Petraea|Arabia]], present-day Syria]]\n[[File:The Jupiter temple in Damascus.jpg|thumb|[[Temple of Jupiter, Damascus]]]]\n[[Palmyra]], a rich and sometimes powerful native [[Aramaic]]-speaking kingdom arose in northern Syria in the 2nd century; the Palmyrene established a trade network that made the city one of the richest in the Roman empire.

Syrian writers, many of whom migrated to Egypt, played a crucial role in the [[nahda]] or Arab literary and cultural revival of the 19th century. Prominent contemporary Syrian writers include, among others, [[Ali Ahmad Said|Adonis]], [[Muhammad al-Maghut|Muhammad Maghout]], [[Haidar Haidar]], [[Ghada al-Samman]], [[Nizar Qabbani]] and [[Zakariyya Tamer]].\n\nBa'ath Party rule, since the [[1966 Syrian coup d'\u00e9tat|1966 coup]], has brought about renewed censorship. In this context, the genre of the historical novel, spearheaded by [[Nabil Sulayman]], [[Fawwaz Haddad]], [[Khyri al-Dhahabi]] and [[Nihad Siris]], is sometimes used as a means of expressing dissent, critiquing the present through a depiction of the past. Syrian [[List of folklores|folk narrative]], as a subgenre of historical fiction, is imbued with [[magical realism]], and is also used as a means of veiled criticism of the present. [[Salim Barakat]], a Syrian \u00e9migr\u00e9 living in Sweden, is one of the leading figures of the genre. Contemporary Syrian literature also encompasses science fiction and futuristic [[utopia]]e ([[Nuhad Sharif]], [[Talib Umran]]), which may also serve as media of dissent.\n\n===Music===\n\n[[Music of Syria|The Syrian music scene]], in particular that of Damascus, has long been among the Arab world's most important, especially in the field of [[classical Arab music]]. Syria has produced several pan-Arab stars, including [[Asmahan]], [[Farid al-Atrash]] and singer [[Lena Chamamyan]]. The city of Aleppo is known for its [[muwashshah]], a form of [[Andalous]] sung poetry popularized by [[Sabri Moudallal]], as well as for popular stars like [[Sabah Fakhri]].\n\n===Media===\n[[Television in Syria|Television was introduced to Syria]] and Egypt in 1960, when both were part of the [[United Arab Republic]].

Syrian food mostly consists of Southern Mediterranean, Greek, and Southwest Asian dishes. Some Syrian dishes also evolved from Turkish and French cooking: dishes like [[Kebab|shish kebab]], stuffed zucchini/courgette, and ''[[dolma|yabra\u02be]]'' (stuffed grape leaves, the word ''yabra\u02be'' deriving from the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word ''yaprak'', meaning leaf).\n\nThe main dishes that form Syrian cuisine are [[kibbeh]], [[hummus]], [[tabbouleh]], [[fattoush]], [[strained yogurt|labneh]], [[shawarma]], [[mujaddara]], [[shanklish]], [[past\u0131rma]], [[sujuk]] and baklava. [[Baklava]] is made of [[filo]] pastry filled with chopped nuts and soaked in [[honey]]. Syrians often serve selections of appetizers, known as [[meze]], before the main course. [[Za'atar]], [[minced beef]], and cheese [[manakish]] are popular [[hors d'\u0153uvres]]. The Arabic flatbread [[khubz]] is always eaten together with meze.\n\nDrinks in Syria vary, depending on the time of day and the occasion. [[Arabic coffee]] is the most well-known hot drink, usually prepared in the morning at breakfast or in the evening. It is usually served for guests or after food. [[Arak (distilled beverage)|Arak]], an alcoholic drink, is a well-known beverage, served mostly on special occasions.

From this point, the region became known as [[Aramea]] or [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]]. There was also a synthesis between the Semitic Arameans and the remnants of the Indo-European [[Hittites]], with the founding of a number of [[Syro-Hittite]] states centered in north central Aram (Syria) and south central Asia Minor (modern Turkey), including [[Palistin]], [[Carchemish]] and [[Sam'al]].\n\n[[File:Geretteteg\u00f6tter l\u00f6wen.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|Reliefs from [[Tel Halaf]] dating to the Aramean kingdom of [[Bit Bahiani]] ]]\nA [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] group known as the [[Phoenicians]] came to dominate the coasts of Syria, (and also Lebanon and northern [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]) from the 13th century BC, founding city states such as [[Amrit]], [[Simyra]], [[Arwad]], [[Arab al-Mulk|Paltos]], [[Latakia#Ancient settlement and founding|Ramitha]] and [[Tell Sukas|Shuksi]]. From these coastal regions, they eventually spread their influence throughout the [[Mediterranean]], including building colonies in [[Malta]], Sicily, the [[Iberian peninsula]] (modern Spain and [[Portugal]]), and the coasts of North Africa and most significantly, founding the major city state of [[Carthage]] (in modern [[Tunisia]]) in the 9th century BC, which was much later to become the center of a major empire, rivaling the [[Roman Empire]].\n\nSyria and the Western half of [[Near East]] then fell to the vast [[Neo Assyrian Empire]] (911 BC \u2013 605 BC). The Assyrians introduced [[Imperial Aramaic]] as the [[lingua franca]] of their empire. This language was to remain dominant in Syria and the entire [[Near East]] until after the [[Arab]] [[Islamic]] conquest in the 7th and 8th centuries AD, and was to be a vehicle for the spread of Christianity. The Assyrians named their colonies of Syria and Lebanon [[Eber-Nari]]. Assyrian domination ended after the Assyrians greatly weakened themselves in a series of brutal internal civil wars, followed by an attacks from; the [[Medes]], [[Babylonians]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]]. During the fall of Assyria, the [[Scythians]] ravaged and plundered much of Syria. The last stand of the Assyrian army was at [[Carchemish]] in northern Syria in 605 BC.\n\nThe Assyrian Empire was followed by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] (605 BC \u2013 539 BC).  During this period, Syria became a battle ground between Babylonia and another former Assyrian colony, that of [[Egypt]].

Syrian writers, many of whom migrated to Egypt, played a crucial role in the [[nahda]] or Arab literary and cultural revival of the 19th century. Prominent contemporary Syrian writers include, among others, [[Ali Ahmad Said|Adonis]], [[Muhammad al-Maghut|Muhammad Maghout]], [[Haidar Haidar]], [[Ghada al-Samman]], [[Nizar Qabbani]] and [[Zakariyya Tamer]].\n\nBa'ath Party rule, since the [[1966 Syrian coup d'\u00e9tat|1966 coup]], has brought about renewed censorship. In this context, the genre of the historical novel, spearheaded by [[Nabil Sulayman]], [[Fawwaz Haddad]], [[Khyri al-Dhahabi]] and [[Nihad Siris]], is sometimes used as a means of expressing dissent, critiquing the present through a depiction of the past. Syrian [[List of folklores|folk narrative]], as a subgenre of historical fiction, is imbued with [[magical realism]], and is also used as a means of veiled criticism of the present. [[Salim Barakat]], a Syrian \u00e9migr\u00e9 living in Sweden, is one of the leading figures of the genre. Contemporary Syrian literature also encompasses science fiction and futuristic [[utopia]]e ([[Nuhad Sharif]], [[Talib Umran]]), which may also serve as media of dissent.\n\n===Music===\n\n[[Music of Syria|The Syrian music scene]], in particular that of Damascus, has long been among the Arab world's most important, especially in the field of [[classical Arab music]]. Syria has produced several pan-Arab stars, including [[Asmahan]], [[Farid al-Atrash]] and singer [[Lena Chamamyan]].

Some Syrian dishes also evolved from Turkish and French cooking: dishes like [[Kebab|shish kebab]], stuffed zucchini/courgette, and ''[[dolma|yabra\u02be]]'' (stuffed grape leaves, the word ''yabra\u02be'' deriving from the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word ''yaprak'', meaning leaf).\n\nThe main dishes that form Syrian cuisine are [[kibbeh]], [[hummus]], [[tabbouleh]], [[fattoush]], [[strained yogurt|labneh]], [[shawarma]], [[mujaddara]], [[shanklish]], [[past\u0131rma]], [[sujuk]] and baklava. [[Baklava]] is made of [[filo]] pastry filled with chopped nuts and soaked in [[honey]]. Syrians often serve selections of appetizers, known as [[meze]], before the main course. [[Za'atar]], [[minced beef]], and cheese [[manakish]] are popular [[hors d'\u0153uvres]]. The Arabic flatbread [[khubz]] is always eaten together with meze.\n\nDrinks in Syria vary, depending on the time of day and the occasion. [[Arabic coffee]] is the most well-known hot drink, usually prepared in the morning at breakfast or in the evening. It is usually served for guests or after food. [[Arak (distilled beverage)|Arak]], an alcoholic drink, is a well-known beverage, served mostly on special occasions.

It was first instituted in 1967 to help build Singapore's military forces soon after its independence, and has since been expanded to involve the police and civil defence force as well.\n\nUpon enlistment, male Singaporean citizens and second-generation permanent residents serve for 2 years in [[active duty]] as full-time national servicemen (NSFs) in the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] (SAF), [[Singapore Police Force]] (SPF) or [[Singapore Civil Defence Force]] (SCDF), following which they transition to an operationally-ready [[reservist]] state as operationally-ready national servicemen (NSmen)\n\nA two-month reduction in full-time [[National Service]] is offered for all pre-enlistees who are able to pass their (now-modified) three-station Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) consisting of push-ups, sit-ups and a 2.4&nbsp;km run, with a minimum of 61 points (previously, the IPPT consisted of six single stations, which were the 2.4&nbsp;km run, sit-ups, pull-ups, standing-broad jump, sit-and-reach stretch and shuttle-run).<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ns.sg/nsp/portal/site/start |title=NS Portal - Welcome|website=www.ns.sg}}</ref>\n\nThe majority of NSFs serve in the [[Singapore Army|Army]] as part of the SAF. The reasons for this include the relative manpower needs of the Army compared to the Navy and Air Force, the SPF, and SCDF. Moreover, as compared to the Army, the [[Republic of Singapore Air Force|Air Force]] (RSAF) and [[Republic of Singapore Navy|Navy]] (RSN) are smaller armed services composed primarily of regular servicemen. As the manpower requirements of the RSAF and the RSN tend to be more specialized, the constant periodic turnover of NSFs is considered to be very disruptive.\n\nThe statutory age cap for reservist obligation is 40 for WOSEs (other ranks) and 50 for commissioned officers (lieutenants onwards in the SAF and the SCDF and police-inspectors and above in the SPF) and they are known as ex-NSmen.\n\n==History==\nThe NS (Amendment) act was passed on 15 March 1967, making National Service (NS) compulsory for all 18-year-old male Singapore citizens and permanent residents. The [[Government of Singapore|Singapore government]] felt that it was necessary to build a substantial military force to defend itself. The country had only about 1,000 soldiers at independence. In the late 1960s, the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] had decided to withdraw its troops and bases from the [[East of Suez]], including troops stationed in Singapore. That prompted the government to implement a conscription program for the country's defence needs. It adopted a conscription model drawing on elements from the [[conscription in Israel|Israeli]] and [[Conscription in Switzerland|Swiss]] national conscription schemes. Some 9,000 male youths born between 1 January  and 30 June 1949 became the first batch of young men to be called up for NS. Singapore had sought assistance through official diplomacy from other countries, but their refusal to provide help prompted Israeli diplomats to extend a helping hand to the new sovereign nation in the establishment of the Singapore armed forces.<ref>Amnon Brazilai, [http://cs.uwec.edu/~tan/saf_israel.htm \"A Deep, Dark, Secret Love Affair\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720105735/http://cs.uwec.edu/~tan/saf_israel.htm |date=2011-07-20 }} (reprint), ''[[Haaretz]]'', July 2004.</ref>\n\nThe stated rationale behind conscription is twofold. Firstly, because Singapore has a population of about five and a half million (as of 2014), an army solely of [[Regular army|regulars]] would not be practical to defend the country. Secondly, national service is supposed to support racial harmony among the [[Chinese Singaporean|Chinese]], [[Malays in Singapore|Malay]] and [[Indians in Singapore|Indian]] communities. \nThe Malays were virtually excluded from conscription from the beginning of the draft in 1967 until 1977<ref name=\"alon\">Alon Peled, [http://www.wcfia.harvard.edu/ponsacs/seminars/Synopses/s93peled.htm A Question of Loyalty: Ethnic Minorities, Military Service and Resistance] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906153229/http://www.wcfia.harvard.edu/ponsacs/seminars/Synopses/s93peled.htm |date=2006-09-06 }}, 3 March 1993. Seminar Synopses of the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, Harvard.</ref> and, after the policy was eased, were assigned mainly to serve in the police and civil defence (fire brigade), not in military roles.<ref name=\"alon\"/>\n\nIn 1987, [[Lee Hsien Loong]] (then Second Minister for Defence) stated that \"If there is a conflict, if the SAF is called to defend the homeland, we do not want to put any of our soldiers in a difficult position where his emotions for the nation may be in conflict with his religion\".<ref name=\"lee\">Straits Times, 2 April 1987</ref>\n\nIn the past, the duration of the conscription for a typical Singaporean male spanned over a period of either 2 or 2 years and six months depending on his educational qualifications.

Those who have been chosen to serve in the SPF undergo training at the [[Home Team Academy]] where they study the [[Penal Code (Singapore)|Penal Code]] and standard police protocol. After training at the Academy, they will be posted to various departments of the SPF, such as [[Special Operations Command (Singapore)|Special Operations Command]] (SOC), Logistics, Land divisions, [[Airport Police Division]] (APD). Those posted to the [[Police Coast Guard]] (PCG) or Police KINS will undergo further training. Selection of [[Officer cadet#Singapore|Officer Cadets]] (OCTs) to undergo the NS Probationary Inspector Course (NSPI) is a stringent process for Police National Servicemen (Full-time). A very small number, usually one who is awarded the Best Trainee Award, from each cohort will be selected, with the majority of the OCTs being carefully chosen from the Singapore Armed Forces' National Servicemen (Full-time) who have completed their Basic Military Training (BMT) forming the senior officers corps for the [[Singapore Police Force]].\n\nThe national service ranks in the SPF differ from the Military and Civil Defence forces slightly and official usage within official correspondence within the organization clearly differentiates an NS officer versus a regular.<ref>{{cite web | access-date=2018-05-03 | archive-date=2018-05-04 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504012059/https://www.police.gov.sg/about-us/our-heritage/police-heritage-centre/ranks | url-status=live | url=https://www.police.gov.sg/about-us/our-heritage/police-heritage-centre/ranks | title=POLICE HERITAGE CENTRE | website=www.police.gov.sg}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!NS Ranks (Police)\n|-\n|Recruit/Trainee\n|-\n|Special Constable\n|-\n|Corporal (NS)\n|-\n|Sergeant (NS)\n|-\n|Staff Sergeant (NS)\n|-\n|Senior Staff Sergeant (NS)\n|-\n|Station Inspector (NS)\n|-\n|Senior Station Inspector (NS)\n|-\n|Senior Station Inspector II (NS)\n|-\n|Officer Cadet\n|-\n|National Service Probationary Inspector\n|-\n|Inspector (NS)\n|-\n|Assistant Superintendent (NS)\n|-\n|Deputy Superintendent (NS)\n|-\n|Superintendent (NS)\n|}\n\n===Civil defence service===\nThe [[Singapore Civil Defence Force]] (SCDF) is the emergency rescue force of Singapore and they provide [[firefighting]], [[rescue]] and [[ambulance]] services, and has been one of the three National Service postings since 1972. Those enlisted into the SCDF typically undergo 12 weeks of training at the Basic Rescue Training Centre (BRTC), where they are given basic rescue training (BRT), exposed to regimental discipline, and trained to maintain a level of fitness required of all NSFs in Singapore.\n\nMuch like the SAF's SISPEC course, selected NSFs are also posted to the Civil Defence Academy (CDA) to undergo the Firefighter Course (FFC) or the Emergency Response Specialist Course (ERSC) within the first two weeks of their BRT stage, passing out as Firefighters for FFC trainees, and as Fire & Rescue Specialists for ERS trainees who would also simultaneously be conferred with the Sergeant rank (Firefighters mostly pass out as Lance Corporals prior to station posting). Firefighters would typically be posted out to the various fire stations island-wide after passing out, while Fire & Rescue Specialists would be posted as Section Commanders at territorial division, fire stations or at the Special Rescue Battalion; based largely on rankings at the time of course completion, a small number may also be posted as Instructors back in the CDA to staff the Command and Staff Training Center (CSTC), Specialist Training Center (STC), or Firefighting Training Center (FFTC).\n\nWhile a certain level of health and fitness pre-requisites are expected by both the FFC and ERSC administrators before one can be selected for these courses, admission into the ERS course typically requires a certain set of additional qualifications, namely either a minimum of a [[GCE Advanced Level]] certificate, a [[Diploma]] or a Higher Nitec Certificate. These added pre-requisites are viewed as necessary in the light of a Section Commander's operational and administrative role when posted out. One marked difference between the FFC and ERSC is the added rescue and emergency training received by ERS Specialist Cadet Trainees (SCTs), as well as the General Command & Control Term, which includes the Basic Home Team Course held at the Home Team Academy and an outward-bound [[Brunei]] trip which serves to equip and develop the necessary leadership skills required of a specialist junior officer. In terms of administration and duration, the FFC is under the charge of the FFTC and lasts three months, while the ERSC is under the purview of the CSTC and lasts six months.\n\nIn addition, there is also the Basic Officer Course under the charge of the CSTW, designed to train NSFs and regulars as Senior Officers of the SCDF, with NSFs graduating as [[Lieutenant]]s (LTA). While the BOC is traditionally largely made up of NSFs from the SAF who had just completed their Basic Military Training (BMT) at [[Pulau Tekong]], the top 5-10% of the ERSC will also be offered to cross over to the Basic Officer Course (BOC) to be trained and commissioned as Senior Officers after passing out, spending the last three months of the BOC together with Officer Cadet Trainees (OCTs).\n\nNSFs who undergo the full 7-week basic rescue training at the BRTC are subsequently posted and trained to become medical [[Orderly|orderlies]] (medics), [[police dog|dog handler]]s, [[military police|provosts]], information and communications and logistics specialists or instructors (such as Physical Training Instructors) among many other vocations upon passing out from the BRTC.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mindef.gov.sg/oms/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2009/sep/11sep09_nr/11sep09_fs.html.print.html?Status=1|title=File Not Found|website=www.mindef.gov.sg}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n===Alleged discrimination===\nMilitary analyst Sean Walsh who authored ''The Roar of the Lion City'' (2007), claimed that \"official discrimination against the Malay population remains an open secret\".<ref name=\"walsh\">{{cite journal | author = Sean Walsh | journal = [[Armed Forces & Society]] | title = The Roar of the Lion City: Ethnicity, Gender, and Culture in the Singapore Armed Forces | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1177/0095327X06291854 | pages = 265}}</ref>\n\nThe Ministry of Defence contests the charge, noting that there are \"Malay pilots, [[Singapore Armed Forces Commando Formation|commandos]] and air defence personnel\" and stating that \"the proportion of eligible Malays selected for [[Specialist (Singapore)|specialist]] and [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] training is similar to the proportion of eligible non-Malays.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.todayonline.com/articles/176695print.asp |title=US soldier takes potshots at SAF |newspaper=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]] |date=12 March 2007 |accessdate=2008-09-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716162821/http://www.todayonline.com/articles/176695print.asp |archivedate=July 16, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Melvyn Tan===\n[[Melvyn Tan]], a classical pianist, left Singapore at the age of 12 to study at Yehudi Menuhin School in 1969.

It was first instituted in 1967 to help build Singapore's military forces soon after its independence, and has since been expanded to involve the police and civil defence force as well.\n\nUpon enlistment, male Singaporean citizens and second-generation permanent residents serve for 2 years in [[active duty]] as full-time national servicemen (NSFs) in the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] (SAF), [[Singapore Police Force]] (SPF) or [[Singapore Civil Defence Force]] (SCDF), following which they transition to an operationally-ready [[reservist]] state as operationally-ready national servicemen (NSmen)\n\nA two-month reduction in full-time [[National Service]] is offered for all pre-enlistees who are able to pass their (now-modified) three-station Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) consisting of push-ups, sit-ups and a 2.4&nbsp;km run, with a minimum of 61 points (previously, the IPPT consisted of six single stations, which were the 2.4&nbsp;km run, sit-ups, pull-ups, standing-broad jump, sit-and-reach stretch and shuttle-run).<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ns.sg/nsp/portal/site/start |title=NS Portal - Welcome|website=www.ns.sg}}</ref>\n\nThe majority of NSFs serve in the [[Singapore Army|Army]] as part of the SAF. The reasons for this include the relative manpower needs of the Army compared to the Navy and Air Force, the SPF, and SCDF. Moreover, as compared to the Army, the [[Republic of Singapore Air Force|Air Force]] (RSAF) and [[Republic of Singapore Navy|Navy]] (RSN) are smaller armed services composed primarily of regular servicemen. As the manpower requirements of the RSAF and the RSN tend to be more specialized, the constant periodic turnover of NSFs is considered to be very disruptive.\n\nThe statutory age cap for reservist obligation is 40 for WOSEs (other ranks) and 50 for commissioned officers (lieutenants onwards in the SAF and the SCDF and police-inspectors and above in the SPF) and they are known as ex-NSmen.\n\n==History==\nThe NS (Amendment) act was passed on 15 March 1967, making National Service (NS) compulsory for all 18-year-old male Singapore citizens and permanent residents. The [[Government of Singapore|Singapore government]] felt that it was necessary to build a substantial military force to defend itself. The country had only about 1,000 soldiers at independence. In the late 1960s, the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] had decided to withdraw its troops and bases from the [[East of Suez]], including troops stationed in Singapore. That prompted the government to implement a conscription program for the country's defence needs. It adopted a conscription model drawing on elements from the [[conscription in Israel|Israeli]] and [[Conscription in Switzerland|Swiss]] national conscription schemes. Some 9,000 male youths born between 1 January  and 30 June 1949 became the first batch of young men to be called up for NS. Singapore had sought assistance through official diplomacy from other countries, but their refusal to provide help prompted Israeli diplomats to extend a helping hand to the new sovereign nation in the establishment of the Singapore armed forces.<ref>Amnon Brazilai, [http://cs.uwec.edu/~tan/saf_israel.htm \"A Deep, Dark, Secret Love Affair\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720105735/http://cs.uwec.edu/~tan/saf_israel.htm |date=2011-07-20 }} (reprint), ''[[Haaretz]]'', July 2004.</ref>\n\nThe stated rationale behind conscription is twofold. Firstly, because Singapore has a population of about five and a half million (as of 2014), an army solely of [[Regular army|regulars]] would not be practical to defend the country. Secondly, national service is supposed to support racial harmony among the [[Chinese Singaporean|Chinese]], [[Malays in Singapore|Malay]] and [[Indians in Singapore|Indian]] communities. \nThe Malays were virtually excluded from conscription from the beginning of the draft in 1967 until 1977<ref name=\"alon\">Alon Peled, [http://www.wcfia.harvard.edu/ponsacs/seminars/Synopses/s93peled.htm A Question of Loyalty: Ethnic Minorities, Military Service and Resistance] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906153229/http://www.wcfia.harvard.edu/ponsacs/seminars/Synopses/s93peled.htm |date=2006-09-06 }}, 3 March 1993.

Those who have been chosen to serve in the SPF undergo training at the [[Home Team Academy]] where they study the [[Penal Code (Singapore)|Penal Code]] and standard police protocol. After training at the Academy, they will be posted to various departments of the SPF, such as [[Special Operations Command (Singapore)|Special Operations Command]] (SOC), Logistics, Land divisions, [[Airport Police Division]] (APD). Those posted to the [[Police Coast Guard]] (PCG) or Police KINS will undergo further training. Selection of [[Officer cadet#Singapore|Officer Cadets]] (OCTs) to undergo the NS Probationary Inspector Course (NSPI) is a stringent process for Police National Servicemen (Full-time). A very small number, usually one who is awarded the Best Trainee Award, from each cohort will be selected, with the majority of the OCTs being carefully chosen from the Singapore Armed Forces' National Servicemen (Full-time) who have completed their Basic Military Training (BMT) forming the senior officers corps for the [[Singapore Police Force]].\n\nThe national service ranks in the SPF differ from the Military and Civil Defence forces slightly and official usage within official correspondence within the organization clearly differentiates an NS officer versus a regular.<ref>{{cite web | access-date=2018-05-03 | archive-date=2018-05-04 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504012059/https://www.police.gov.sg/about-us/our-heritage/police-heritage-centre/ranks | url-status=live | url=https://www.police.gov.sg/about-us/our-heritage/police-heritage-centre/ranks | title=POLICE HERITAGE CENTRE | website=www.police.gov.sg}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!NS Ranks (Police)\n|-\n|Recruit/Trainee\n|-\n|Special Constable\n|-\n|Corporal (NS)\n|-\n|Sergeant (NS)\n|-\n|Staff Sergeant (NS)\n|-\n|Senior Staff Sergeant (NS)\n|-\n|Station Inspector (NS)\n|-\n|Senior Station Inspector (NS)\n|-\n|Senior Station Inspector II (NS)\n|-\n|Officer Cadet\n|-\n|National Service Probationary Inspector\n|-\n|Inspector (NS)\n|-\n|Assistant Superintendent (NS)\n|-\n|Deputy Superintendent (NS)\n|-\n|Superintendent (NS)\n|}\n\n===Civil defence service===\nThe [[Singapore Civil Defence Force]] (SCDF) is the emergency rescue force of Singapore and they provide [[firefighting]], [[rescue]] and [[ambulance]] services, and has been one of the three National Service postings since 1972. Those enlisted into the SCDF typically undergo 12 weeks of training at the Basic Rescue Training Centre (BRTC), where they are given basic rescue training (BRT), exposed to regimental discipline, and trained to maintain a level of fitness required of all NSFs in Singapore.\n\nMuch like the SAF's SISPEC course, selected NSFs are also posted to the Civil Defence Academy (CDA) to undergo the Firefighter Course (FFC) or the Emergency Response Specialist Course (ERSC) within the first two weeks of their BRT stage, passing out as Firefighters for FFC trainees, and as Fire & Rescue Specialists for ERS trainees who would also simultaneously be conferred with the Sergeant rank (Firefighters mostly pass out as Lance Corporals prior to station posting). Firefighters would typically be posted out to the various fire stations island-wide after passing out, while Fire & Rescue Specialists would be posted as Section Commanders at territorial division, fire stations or at the Special Rescue Battalion; based largely on rankings at the time of course completion, a small number may also be posted as Instructors back in the CDA to staff the Command and Staff Training Center (CSTC), Specialist Training Center (STC), or Firefighting Training Center (FFTC).\n\nWhile a certain level of health and fitness pre-requisites are expected by both the FFC and ERSC administrators before one can be selected for these courses, admission into the ERS course typically requires a certain set of additional qualifications, namely either a minimum of a [[GCE Advanced Level]] certificate, a [[Diploma]] or a Higher Nitec Certificate. These added pre-requisites are viewed as necessary in the light of a Section Commander's operational and administrative role when posted out. One marked difference between the FFC and ERSC is the added rescue and emergency training received by ERS Specialist Cadet Trainees (SCTs), as well as the General Command & Control Term, which includes the Basic Home Team Course held at the Home Team Academy and an outward-bound [[Brunei]] trip which serves to equip and develop the necessary leadership skills required of a specialist junior officer. In terms of administration and duration, the FFC is under the charge of the FFTC and lasts three months, while the ERSC is under the purview of the CSTC and lasts six months.\n\nIn addition, there is also the Basic Officer Course under the charge of the CSTW, designed to train NSFs and regulars as Senior Officers of the SCDF, with NSFs graduating as [[Lieutenant]]s (LTA). While the BOC is traditionally largely made up of NSFs from the SAF who had just completed their Basic Military Training (BMT) at [[Pulau Tekong]], the top 5-10% of the ERSC will also be offered to cross over to the Basic Officer Course (BOC) to be trained and commissioned as Senior Officers after passing out, spending the last three months of the BOC together with Officer Cadet Trainees (OCTs).\n\nNSFs who undergo the full 7-week basic rescue training at the BRTC are subsequently posted and trained to become medical [[Orderly|orderlies]] (medics), [[police dog|dog handler]]s, [[military police|provosts]], information and communications and logistics specialists or instructors (such as Physical Training Instructors) among many other vocations upon passing out from the BRTC.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mindef.gov.sg/oms/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2009/sep/11sep09_nr/11sep09_fs.html.print.html?Status=1|title=File Not Found|website=www.mindef.gov.sg}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n===Alleged discrimination===\nMilitary analyst Sean Walsh who authored ''The Roar of the Lion City'' (2007), claimed that \"official discrimination against the Malay population remains an open secret\".<ref name=\"walsh\">{{cite journal | author = Sean Walsh | journal = [[Armed Forces & Society]] | title = The Roar of the Lion City: Ethnicity, Gender, and Culture in the Singapore Armed Forces | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1177/0095327X06291854 | pages = 265}}</ref>\n\nThe Ministry of Defence contests the charge, noting that there are \"Malay pilots, [[Singapore Armed Forces Commando Formation|commandos]] and air defence personnel\" and stating that \"the proportion of eligible Malays selected for [[Specialist (Singapore)|specialist]] and [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] training is similar to the proportion of eligible non-Malays.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.todayonline.com/articles/176695print.asp |title=US soldier takes potshots at SAF |newspaper=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]] |date=12 March 2007 |accessdate=2008-09-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716162821/http://www.todayonline.com/articles/176695print.asp |archivedate=July 16, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Melvyn Tan===\n[[Melvyn Tan]], a classical pianist, left Singapore at the age of 12 to study at Yehudi Menuhin School in 1969.

He is the son of [[Mortada Al-Qazwini|Ayatollah Sayed Mortadha Al Qazwini]], the brother of [[Sayed Moustafa Al-Qazwini]], and the father of [[Sayed Mohammed Baqer al-Qazwini]]\n\n== Family ==\nAl-Qazwini's family is well known in Iraq and in the Muslim world. With the advent of the despotic [[Baath Party|Ba'athist]] regime in the late 1960s and early 1970s, al-Qazwini and other Shia scholars and clerics increased efforts to educate the masses to combat their depravity and brainwashing. Al-Qazwini's father Ayatollah [[Mortada Al-Qazwini|Sayid Mortadha al-Qazwini]] was among the leading scholars in spreading the word of Islam in Iraq and engaging in Islamic activism, helping to establish several Islamic schools and institutions, and serving as the principal of [[Imam Assadiq Islamic School]] in Karbala.\n\nAfter several years, [[Saddam Hussein]] identified the al-Qazwini family as an ideological threat to his regime. Consequently, he started to pressure them to abandon their mission and to support his regime. In 1980, Sayid Hassan al-Qazwini's grandfather, [[Ayatollah Sayid Mohammad Sadiq al-Qazwini]], was arrested and imprisoned by Saddam Hussein because he did not support the Baathist regime. [[Amnesty International]] deemed him as the oldest political prisoner in the world at the time{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}. Since then, the al-Qazwini family never heard from him, and it was not until a few weeks after the collapse of Saddam's regime that they found documents verifying his death in Saddam's prisons. Consequently, Al-Qazwini's family was forced to flee Iraq and seek refuge in [[Kuwait]].\n\n== Early life ==\nIn Kuwait, Al-Qazwini decided to pursue the path of his forefathers of becoming a scholar of Islam and religious leader. At that time, Iraq was at war with Kuwait. Therefore, at the inception of the [[Islamic Revolution]] in [[Iran]], Al-Qazwini immigrated to Iran along with his family. In 1980, Al-Qazwini joined the [[Qom Seminary]] in Iran, the largest [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] seminary in the world. After twelve years of vigorous study, Al-Qazwini graduated in 1992 with in-depth knowledge of the fundamentals of Islamic jurisprudence and [[Qur'an]]ic commentary. During his studies, he administered a prominent Islamic journal called \"Annibras,\" or The Eternal Light. The journal addressed many social, historical and Islamic issues. In addition, he authored two books: ''[[Meditation on Sahihain: A Critique of Sahih Al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim]]'', and ''[[Prophet Mohammad: The Ethical Prospect]]''.\n\n== Immigration to the United States ==\nAl-Qazwini's father immigrated to the [[United States]] in 1986, where he established several Islamic institutions and mosques. In 1994, he founded a full-time Islamic school which enrolled students from pre-kindergarten to twelfth grade. Realizing that there was a dire need for scholars and religious leaders in the United States, where Islam was in the crawling stage of development, al-Qazwini immigrated to the United States in late 1992 along with his family. He spent four years in Los Angeles, where he directed Azzahra Islamic Center, which was founded by his father, and conducted several [[Fiqh|Islamic Fiqh]] and various other Islamic classes.\n\nIn early 1993, Al-Qazwini was invited by the Islamic Center of America, oldest Shi'a mosque in the United States to be the guest speaker for the Arabic program during the upcoming holy month of [[Ramadhan]], where the community in [[Dearborn, Michigan]] quickly found him responsive to their spiritual and religious needs. The Islamic Center of America asked him to join them the following year as their guest speaker during the holy month of Ramadhan and the first ten days of [[Muharram]], commemorating the martyrdom of the beloved grandson of Prophet Muhammad, Imam Hussein.\n\nPrior to Al-Qazwini's visit to Michigan, he realized the importance of disseminating the message of Islam in North America in English, especially to the youth.  While numerous scholars and religious leaders performed a good job reaching out to the Arabic speaking members of the community, the English-speaking generations needed someone who was capable of communicating with them, and Al-Qazwini devoted himself to learning and acquiring a fair grasp of the English language quickly.\n\nIn 1997, Al-Qazwini established residence in Dearborn, Michigan after the Islamic Center of America asked him to serve as scholar and religious leader. Al-Qazwini conducts Friday Prayer every week, delivering the first sermon in Arabic and the second in English, attracting a growing number of the younger English-speaking to religious events. He also performs an English presentation during the Sunday service, usually aimed at addressing of current issues affecting the local Muslim community as well as the global community at large.\n\n== Young Muslim Association ==\nRealizing that the greatest energy and potential rested in the younger generation, Al-Qazwini founded the [[Young Muslim Association]] (YMA) in 1998, becoming its spiritual leader. This organization, affiliated with the [[Islamic Center of America]], is aimed at educating Muslim-American youth, fostering leadership, and creating an environment in which they can actively and effectively channel their efforts in promoting Islam. In the first five years since its establishment the YMA has grown to be one of the largest Muslim youth organizations in North America. The YMA annually holds a thirty-day program during Ramadhan and a ten-day commemoration of the grandson of Muhammad, Imam Hussein. It also conducts an annual retreat during the summer, a Ramadan dinner, an Eid Al-Ghadeer dinner (which celebrates the day Muhammad appointed his cousin and son-in-law Imam Ali as his successor according to the Shi'a view), and numerous other educational activities throughout the year.\n\n== Public appearances ==\nSince [[September 11 attacks]], al-Qazwini has stepped up his efforts to act as an ambassador American Muslims, speaking at over a hundred churches, colleges and universities, hoping to dispel what he sees as common misconceptions about them.\n\nAl-Qazwini has reminded numerous political leaders in America to cater to the Muslim communities. For instance, he has pressured the American leadership several times to speak out publicly against religious leaders who have repeatedly attacked Islam and Muhammad. The [[White House]] has invited al-Qazwini on several occasions to represent the Shia-Muslim community. Al-Qazwini has met with Presidents [[Bill Clinton]] and George W. Bush, as well as with then-[[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Barack Obama]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Niraj| last=Warikoo| title=Local Muslim leader met privately with Obama | date=May 15, 2008 | url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080515/NEWS05/80515096/1007/NEWS | work=Detroit Free Press | accessdate=2008-07-16 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080621003156/http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080515/NEWS05/80515096/1007/NEWS <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-06-21}}</ref>  He has also received invitations from the U.S. State and Defense Departments. He also made an appearance in the award-winning PBS-broadcast documentary ''[[Muhammad: Legacy of a Prophet]]'' (2002), produced by [http://www.upf.tv/ Unity Productions Foundation].\n\n==''American Crescent''==\nAl-Qazwini is the author of ''American Crescent: A Muslim Cleric on the Power of His Faith, the Struggle Against Prejudice, and the Future of Islam and America.'' Rashid Khalidi of [[Columbia University]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'': \n<blockquote>\nThis book is many things. It is, first, a personal chronicle of Imam Hassan Qazwini's own trajectory from Karbala, Iraq, where he was born in 1964, to exile in Kuwait and Iran, to Dearborn, Mich., where he currently heads the Islamic Center of America. Second, it is an argument for Qazwini's variety of Shia Islam, rooted in Iraq and Iran and adapted for America. Finally, it is a political statement \u2014 in fact, two of them \u2014 a plea for Muslim Americans to immerse themselves in the life of the United States while simultaneously deepening their identification as Muslims, and also for a particular outcome in Iraq, where Qazwini's father, a leading ayatollah, is Imam of the mosque of Imam Hussein in Karbala. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/books/review/Khalidi-t.html?8bu&emc=bu]\n</blockquote>\n\n==Controversies==\n\nAfter denouncing the Danish caricature on the prophet Muhammad in a sermon and empathizing with calls for sanction, many public officials have distanced themselves from Qazwini. Since then, Qazwini has progressively grown further from the secular world as his religious politics have intensified and he has defended stauncher causes.

He is the son of [[Mortada Al-Qazwini|Ayatollah Sayed Mortadha Al Qazwini]], the brother of [[Sayed Moustafa Al-Qazwini]], and the father of [[Sayed Mohammed Baqer al-Qazwini]]\n\n== Family ==\nAl-Qazwini's family is well known in Iraq and in the Muslim world. With the advent of the despotic [[Baath Party|Ba'athist]] regime in the late 1960s and early 1970s, al-Qazwini and other Shia scholars and clerics increased efforts to educate the masses to combat their depravity and brainwashing. Al-Qazwini's father Ayatollah [[Mortada Al-Qazwini|Sayid Mortadha al-Qazwini]] was among the leading scholars in spreading the word of Islam in Iraq and engaging in Islamic activism, helping to establish several Islamic schools and institutions, and serving as the principal of [[Imam Assadiq Islamic School]] in Karbala.\n\nAfter several years, [[Saddam Hussein]] identified the al-Qazwini family as an ideological threat to his regime. Consequently, he started to pressure them to abandon their mission and to support his regime. In 1980, Sayid Hassan al-Qazwini's grandfather, [[Ayatollah Sayid Mohammad Sadiq al-Qazwini]], was arrested and imprisoned by Saddam Hussein because he did not support the Baathist regime. [[Amnesty International]] deemed him as the oldest political prisoner in the world at the time{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}. Since then, the al-Qazwini family never heard from him, and it was not until a few weeks after the collapse of Saddam's regime that they found documents verifying his death in Saddam's prisons. Consequently, Al-Qazwini's family was forced to flee Iraq and seek refuge in [[Kuwait]].\n\n== Early life ==\nIn Kuwait, Al-Qazwini decided to pursue the path of his forefathers of becoming a scholar of Islam and religious leader. At that time, Iraq was at war with Kuwait. Therefore, at the inception of the [[Islamic Revolution]] in [[Iran]], Al-Qazwini immigrated to Iran along with his family. In 1980, Al-Qazwini joined the [[Qom Seminary]] in Iran, the largest [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] seminary in the world. After twelve years of vigorous study, Al-Qazwini graduated in 1992 with in-depth knowledge of the fundamentals of Islamic jurisprudence and [[Qur'an]]ic commentary. During his studies, he administered a prominent Islamic journal called \"Annibras,\" or The Eternal Light. The journal addressed many social, historical and Islamic issues. In addition, he authored two books: ''[[Meditation on Sahihain: A Critique of Sahih Al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim]]'', and ''[[Prophet Mohammad: The Ethical Prospect]]''.\n\n== Immigration to the United States ==\nAl-Qazwini's father immigrated to the [[United States]] in 1986, where he established several Islamic institutions and mosques. In 1994, he founded a full-time Islamic school which enrolled students from pre-kindergarten to twelfth grade. Realizing that there was a dire need for scholars and religious leaders in the United States, where Islam was in the crawling stage of development, al-Qazwini immigrated to the United States in late 1992 along with his family. He spent four years in Los Angeles, where he directed Azzahra Islamic Center, which was founded by his father, and conducted several [[Fiqh|Islamic Fiqh]] and various other Islamic classes.\n\nIn early 1993, Al-Qazwini was invited by the Islamic Center of America, oldest Shi'a mosque in the United States to be the guest speaker for the Arabic program during the upcoming holy month of [[Ramadhan]], where the community in [[Dearborn, Michigan]] quickly found him responsive to their spiritual and religious needs. The Islamic Center of America asked him to join them the following year as their guest speaker during the holy month of Ramadhan and the first ten days of [[Muharram]], commemorating the martyrdom of the beloved grandson of Prophet Muhammad, Imam Hussein.\n\nPrior to Al-Qazwini's visit to Michigan, he realized the importance of disseminating the message of Islam in North America in English, especially to the youth.  While numerous scholars and religious leaders performed a good job reaching out to the Arabic speaking members of the community, the English-speaking generations needed someone who was capable of communicating with them, and Al-Qazwini devoted himself to learning and acquiring a fair grasp of the English language quickly.\n\nIn 1997, Al-Qazwini established residence in Dearborn, Michigan after the Islamic Center of America asked him to serve as scholar and religious leader. Al-Qazwini conducts Friday Prayer every week, delivering the first sermon in Arabic and the second in English, attracting a growing number of the younger English-speaking to religious events. He also performs an English presentation during the Sunday service, usually aimed at addressing of current issues affecting the local Muslim community as well as the global community at large.\n\n== Young Muslim Association ==\nRealizing that the greatest energy and potential rested in the younger generation, Al-Qazwini founded the [[Young Muslim Association]] (YMA) in 1998, becoming its spiritual leader. This organization, affiliated with the [[Islamic Center of America]], is aimed at educating Muslim-American youth, fostering leadership, and creating an environment in which they can actively and effectively channel their efforts in promoting Islam. In the first five years since its establishment the YMA has grown to be one of the largest Muslim youth organizations in North America. The YMA annually holds a thirty-day program during Ramadhan and a ten-day commemoration of the grandson of Muhammad, Imam Hussein. It also conducts an annual retreat during the summer, a Ramadan dinner, an Eid Al-Ghadeer dinner (which celebrates the day Muhammad appointed his cousin and son-in-law Imam Ali as his successor according to the Shi'a view), and numerous other educational activities throughout the year.\n\n== Public appearances ==\nSince [[September 11 attacks]], al-Qazwini has stepped up his efforts to act as an ambassador American Muslims, speaking at over a hundred churches, colleges and universities, hoping to dispel what he sees as common misconceptions about them.\n\nAl-Qazwini has reminded numerous political leaders in America to cater to the Muslim communities. For instance, he has pressured the American leadership several times to speak out publicly against religious leaders who have repeatedly attacked Islam and Muhammad. The [[White House]] has invited al-Qazwini on several occasions to represent the Shia-Muslim community. Al-Qazwini has met with Presidents [[Bill Clinton]] and George W. Bush, as well as with then-[[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Barack Obama]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Niraj| last=Warikoo| title=Local Muslim leader met privately with Obama | date=May 15, 2008 | url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080515/NEWS05/80515096/1007/NEWS | work=Detroit Free Press | accessdate=2008-07-16 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080621003156/http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080515/NEWS05/80515096/1007/NEWS <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-06-21}}</ref>  He has also received invitations from the U.S. State and Defense Departments. He also made an appearance in the award-winning PBS-broadcast documentary ''[[Muhammad: Legacy of a Prophet]]'' (2002), produced by [http://www.upf.tv/ Unity Productions Foundation].\n\n==''American Crescent''==\nAl-Qazwini is the author of ''American Crescent: A Muslim Cleric on the Power of His Faith, the Struggle Against Prejudice, and the Future of Islam and America.'' Rashid Khalidi of [[Columbia University]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'': \n<blockquote>\nThis book is many things. It is, first, a personal chronicle of Imam Hassan Qazwini's own trajectory from Karbala, Iraq, where he was born in 1964, to exile in Kuwait and Iran, to Dearborn, Mich., where he currently heads the Islamic Center of America. Second, it is an argument for Qazwini's variety of Shia Islam, rooted in Iraq and Iran and adapted for America. Finally, it is a political statement \u2014 in fact, two of them \u2014 a plea for Muslim Americans to immerse themselves in the life of the United States while simultaneously deepening their identification as Muslims, and also for a particular outcome in Iraq, where Qazwini's father, a leading ayatollah, is Imam of the mosque of Imam Hussein in Karbala. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/06/books/review/Khalidi-t.html?8bu&emc=bu]\n</blockquote>\n\n==Controversies==\n\nAfter denouncing the Danish caricature on the prophet Muhammad in a sermon and empathizing with calls for sanction, many public officials have distanced themselves from Qazwini. Since then, Qazwini has progressively grown further from the secular world as his religious politics have intensified and he has defended stauncher causes. In 2015, he was accused of questioning whether or not America's foreign police has been the cause of the rise of the [[Islamic State]]. \n\n==See also==\n* [[Islam in Detroit]]\n* [[History of the Middle Eastern people in Metro Detroit]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Warikoo, Niraj. \"[http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/09/22/imam-qazwini-interview-mosque-islamic-institute-islamic-center-of-america-in-dearborn/71306416/ Imam Al-Qazwini plans new mosque to educate about Islam]\" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6chlX6vHR Archive]).

The small, dark colt is  believed to have been sired by an English [[Thoroughbred]] [[stallion (horse)|stallion]] named \"True Briton\", also known as \"Beautiful Bay\" and \"Traveller\", which was foaled in 1768. Figure's [[mare (horse)|dam]] was of \"Wild-Air\" breeding, sired by Diamond, foaled in 1784 in West Springfield. The dam was bred by Justin Morgan, for whom the breed is named. Figure is thought to have stood about 14&nbsp;hh (1.42 m), and to have weighed about 950&nbsp;lb (430&nbsp;kg). He was known for his prepotency, passing on his distinctive looks, conformation, temperament, and athleticism.\n\n==Ownership by Justin Morgan==\nIn 1792, Figure was advertised for stud before he was given as payment for a debt to Justin Morgan (1747-1798), a singing teacher and one-time [[Randolph, Vermont]], Town Clerk. Morgan owned Figure from 1792-1795, advertising him for stud in [[Randolph, Vermont|Randolph]] and [[Lebanon, New Hampshire]] (1793), and [[Royalton, Vermont]] (1794), and [[Williston, Vermont|Williston]] and [[Hinesburg, Vermont]] (1795). He leased Figure to Robert Evans in the fall of 1795 to clear land for a Mr. Fisk at a rate of $15.00 a year.\n\nMorgan later traded the horse to Samuel Allen for land in [[Moretown, Vermont]].  Allen sold the stallion later that year to William Rice of [[Woodstock, Vermont]].\n\n==Accomplishments==\nIn 1796, Figure raced in a sweepstakes in [[Brookfield, Vermont]], beating [[New York (state)|New York]] horses to win $50. That year, he was advertised at stud by Johnathan Shepard of [[Montpelier, Vermont|Montpelier]], who also raced him in several match races in which he did well. Figure became known as the \"Justin Morgan horse.\"\n\n==Other owners==\nFigure was traded again in 1797, along with a blacksmith shop, to James Hawkins. In 1801 he was recorded as owned by Robert Evans of Randolph. Evans owned the horse until 1804, using the stallion for logging, racing, and breeding, until he fell into debt to Colonel John Goss. Goss collected the horse as part of the debt, and used him to review troops.  He entered the horse in a pulling bee, which the little horse won. In 1805, Goss traded Figure for a mare owned by his brother David.\n\nDavid Goss owned Figure from 1805-1811, where he worked on the farm for 10 months, and was used for breeding for two months each year. He was sold in 1811 to Philip Goss for the breeding season. Philip Goss sold Figure to Jacob Sanderson, who sold him to Jacob Langmeade. Langmeade used the horse to haul freight, and is thought to have abused the aging stallion.\n\nLangmeade sold Figure to Joel Goss and Joseph Rogers at the end of 1811. Figure stood at stud for several years, before he was sold to Samuel Stone in 1817. Stone exhibited the stallion in the Randolph fair. Figure was used as a parade mount by President [[James Monroe]] later that year.\n\n==Final years==\nIn 1819, Figure was sold to his final owner, Levi Bean of [[Chelsea, Vermont]]. Toward the end of his life, Figure was put out to pasture. He died in 1821 from an injury to the flank, caused by a kick, at the age of 32. Figure is now buried in [[Tunbridge, Vermont]].\n\n==Stories, myths and legends==\nMany myths developed surrounding Figure and Justin Morgan.  The popular children's book, ''[[Justin Morgan Had a Horse]]'' by [[Marguerite Henry]], is a fictionalized account of Figure (called \"Little Bub\" in the book) and his early life.  A movie about the pair was made by [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Studios]], released in 1972, which took liberties with known events.\n\n==Sire line tree==\n{{tree list}}\n*'''Justin Morgan (Figure)'''<!--b. 1789--><ref name=\"Justin Morgan Pedigree\">[https://www.allbreedpedigree.com/justin+morgan Justin Morgan Pedigree]</ref>\n**Sherman Morgan<!--b. 1808--><ref name=\"Sherman Morgan Pedigree\">[https://www.allbreedpedigree.com/sherman+morgan Sherman Morgan Pedigree]</ref>\n***[[Black Hawk (horse)|Black Hawk]]<!--b. 1833--><ref name=\"Black Hawk Pedigree\">[https://www.allbreedpedigree.com/black+hawk9 Black Hawk Pedigree]</ref>\n****Blood's Black Hawk<!--b. 1847--><ref name=\"Blood's Black Hawk Pedigree\">[https://www.allbreedpedigree.com/bloods+black+hawk Blood's Black Hawk Pedigree]</ref>\n*****Gist's Black Hawk<!--b. 1852--><ref name=\"Gist's Black Hawk Pedigree\">[https://www.allbreedpedigree.com/gists+black+hawk Gist's Black Hawk Pedigree]</ref>\n{{tree list/end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Morgan horses]]\n[[Category:1789 animal births]]\n[[Category:1821 animal deaths]]\n[[Category:Individual animals in the United States]]\n[[Category:Foundation horse sires]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=April 2008}}\n[[Image:American Morgan Horse.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Horse and rider costumed to resemble Figure and Justin Morgan.]]'''Figure''' was a small [[bay (horse)|bay]] [[stallion (horse)|stallion]] owned by [[Justin Morgan]]; he became the [[foundation bloodstock|foundation sire]] of the [[Morgan horse]] breed.\n\n==Early years==\nThe stallion was born in [[West Springfield, Massachusetts]] in 1789.
