He made his first team debut on 5 November 1983 against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], four weeks after his 17th birthday. Adams became a regular player in the [[1986\u201387 in English football|1986\u201387 season]], winning his first major trophy that season when playing in the [[Football League Cup]] Final win over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]].\n\nTogether with [[Lee Dixon]], [[Nigel Winterburn]] and [[Steve Bould]], Adams was part of the \"famous back four\" that lined up in Arsenal's defence, which under [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] was renowned for its well-disciplined use of the [[Offside (association football)|offside trap]].

On 6 May 1990, Adams crashed his [[Ford Sierra]] into a wall in [[Rayleigh, Essex|Rayleigh]] and when breathalysed his blood alcohol level was found to be more than four times the legal drink-drive limit.

Wenger reformed the club's [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary]] practices and the players' lifestyles. Wenger stuck by Adams following his confessions about his drink problem, and the improvements in the regime probably extended Adams's career by several years. Adams rewarded his manager's understanding handsomely, captaining the club to two [[FA Premier League|Premiership]] and FA Cup [[Double (association football)|Doubles]], in [[1997\u201398 in English football|1997\u201398]] and [[2001\u201302 in English football|2001\u201302]]; he is the only player in English football history to have captained a title-winning team in three different decades.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nIn August 2002, just before the start of the [[2002\u201303 in English football|2002\u201303]] season, Adams retired from professional football after a career spanning almost 20 years, his last match being the last league game of the season at home to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] (the 2002 [[FA Cup Final]] was unusually played ''before'' the last league fixtures). He played 674 matches for Arsenal (only [[David O'Leary]] has played more) and was the most successful captain in the club's history. The number 6 shirt that Adams wore when playing was not used again until the [[2006\u201307 in English football|2006\u201307 season]], when it was assigned to [[Philippe Senderos]]. It is currently unassigned following the departure of former club captain [[Laurent Koscielny]].\n\nJust before his retirement as a player, Adams had applied to become manager of [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] (who had just missed out on promotion to Division One) after the resignation of [[Steve Coppell]], but his application was rejected.<ref>{{cite news\n| url        = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/2069118.stm\n| title      = Brentford snub Adams\n| work  = [[BBC Sport]]\n| date       = 27 June 2002\n| accessdate = 8 January 2009\n | location=London}}</ref>\n\nNicknamed \"Mr Arsenal\", he was honoured by Arsenal with a testimonial game against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in May 2002 with many Arsenal legends playing, including [[Ian Wright]], [[John Lukic]] and Adams's fellow back four stalwarts, Dixon, Winterburn and Bould. The game finished 1\u20131 with Lee Dixon, in his final appearance for the Gunners, getting their goal.\n\nIn March 2003, just seven months after his retirement and with Arsenal [[BBC Sport]] named Adams as the former Arsenal player that the club would most benefit from returning.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/2872203.stm | work=BBC News | title=Blast from the past: Part one | date=24 March 2003 | first=Tom | last=Fordyce}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Adams was inducted into the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] in recognition of his impact on the English game, and in 2008 he was placed third in the 50 Greatest Gunners poll on the club's website.\n\nA statue of Adams was placed outside Emirates Stadium in celebration of the club's 125th anniversary on 9 December 2011.

England lost all three games, but Adams scored one of England's two goals in the tournament in a 3\u20131 defeat to the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]]. He was the first player to represent England who had been born after the 1966 World Cup win.\n\nAfter a highly promising start to his international career, Adams suffered a series of setbacks during the early 1990s. He was surprisingly left out of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] squad by manager [[Bobby Robson]], and missed [[UEFA Euro 1992]] due to injury. However, he still maintained a regular place in defence, and after the retirement of [[Gary Lineker]] in 1992, Adams unofficially shared the captaincy of England with [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]], though Adams became England captain outright before [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 96]], as Platt's place in the side became less secure. England reached the semi-finals of Euro 96, before losing on [[penalty shootout (football)|penalties]] to [[Germany national football team|Germany]].\n\nWhen England manager [[Glenn Hoddle]] took the captain's armband from Adams and gave it to [[Alan Shearer]], it was a bitter pill for Adams to swallow. Speaking at a fans' forum in 2008, Adams remarked, \"I have some resentment over the way Glenn Hoddle gave the captaincy to Alan Shearer instead of me but I can let that go. I reacted positively. I disagreed with him [Hoddle] and he thought Alan could get more penalties being a centre forward. People know my reaction to that\".{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\nAdams continued to play for the national side, however and he finally appeared in a World Cup finals in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]]. His international swansong was England's unsuccessful [[UEFA Euro 2000]] campaign. With Shearer retiring from international football after the tournament, Adams regained the captaincy. However, within months, England lost a World Cup qualifier to Germany in October 2000, the match being the last to be staged at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], before the stadium was torn down for rebuilding. That match was Adams's 60th Wembley appearance, a record. With [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]] eventually taking the helm and under increasing pressure for his place from the emerging and improving [[Rio Ferdinand]], Adams retired from international football, having made sixty-six appearances,<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/adams-intl.html| title = Tony Alexander Adams \u2013 International Appearances| accessdate = 24 October 2008}}</ref> before Eriksson picked his first squad. He was the last England player to score at the old Wembley Stadium when he scored England's second goal in a 2\u20130 friendly win over [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] on 31 May 2000. This was also his first goal since he scored in a friendly against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] in November 1988, thus making the record for the longest gap between goals for England.\n\nAdams was the first, and remains to date the only, England player to make tournament appearances in three separate decades.\n\n==Managerial and coaching career==\nAfter starting a [[sports science]] degree at [[Brunel University]], Adams became the manager of [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]] in November 2003. He was unable to prevent the club's relegation to [[Football League Two|League Two]] that season, and although the club were top of the table in August 2004, a loss of form saw them fall down the table.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wycombe_wanderers/3995677.stm | title=Adams resigns as Wycombe manager | work=BBC Sport | date=9 November 2004 | accessdate=25 March 2010 | location=London}}</ref> He resigned from Wycombe in November 2004, citing personal reasons.

Adams later had a short spell seconded to [[FC Utrecht|Utrecht]] as a first team trainee coach in January and February 2006. While at Feyenoord he also worked part-time as a scout for Arsenal, watching games in Italy, France, and the Netherlands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.setanta.com/US/Articles/Football/2009/06/03/Exclusive-Adams-on-Arsenal-interest/gnid-55518/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607082940/http://www.setanta.com/US/Articles/Football/2009/06/03/Exclusive-Adams-on-Arsenal-interest/gnid-55518/|archivedate=7 June 2009|title=Exclusive: Italian job for Gunners|first=Chris|last=Stanton|publisher=Setanta|date=3 June 2009|accessdate=22 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Portsmouth===\n\nAdams joined [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] as assistant manager to [[Harry Redknapp]] in June 2006, a position left vacant by the departure of [[Kevin Bond (English footballer)|Kevin Bond]].

He made his first team debut on 5 November 1983 against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], four weeks after his 17th birthday. Adams became a regular player in the [[1986\u201387 in English football|1986\u201387 season]], winning his first major trophy that season when playing in the [[Football League Cup]] Final win over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]].\n\nTogether with [[Lee Dixon]], [[Nigel Winterburn]] and [[Steve Bould]], Adams was part of the \"famous back four\" that lined up in Arsenal's defence, which under [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] was renowned for its well-disciplined use of the [[Offside (association football)|offside trap]].

On 6 May 1990, Adams crashed his [[Ford Sierra]] into a wall in [[Rayleigh, Essex|Rayleigh]] and when breathalysed his blood alcohol level was found to be more than four times the legal drink-drive limit.

Wenger reformed the club's [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary]] practices and the players' lifestyles. Wenger stuck by Adams following his confessions about his drink problem, and the improvements in the regime probably extended Adams's career by several years. Adams rewarded his manager's understanding handsomely, captaining the club to two [[FA Premier League|Premiership]] and FA Cup [[Double (association football)|Doubles]], in [[1997\u201398 in English football|1997\u201398]] and [[2001\u201302 in English football|2001\u201302]]; he is the only player in English football history to have captained a title-winning team in three different decades.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nIn August 2002, just before the start of the [[2002\u201303 in English football|2002\u201303]] season, Adams retired from professional football after a career spanning almost 20 years, his last match being the last league game of the season at home to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] (the 2002 [[FA Cup Final]] was unusually played ''before'' the last league fixtures). He played 674 matches for Arsenal (only [[David O'Leary]] has played more) and was the most successful captain in the club's history. The number 6 shirt that Adams wore when playing was not used again until the [[2006\u201307 in English football|2006\u201307 season]], when it was assigned to [[Philippe Senderos]]. It is currently unassigned following the departure of former club captain [[Laurent Koscielny]].\n\nJust before his retirement as a player, Adams had applied to become manager of [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] (who had just missed out on promotion to Division One) after the resignation of [[Steve Coppell]], but his application was rejected.<ref>{{cite news\n| url        = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/2069118.stm\n| title      = Brentford snub Adams\n| work  = [[BBC Sport]]\n| date       = 27 June 2002\n| accessdate = 8 January 2009\n | location=London}}</ref>\n\nNicknamed \"Mr Arsenal\", he was honoured by Arsenal with a testimonial game against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in May 2002 with many Arsenal legends playing, including [[Ian Wright]], [[John Lukic]] and Adams's fellow back four stalwarts, Dixon, Winterburn and Bould. The game finished 1\u20131 with Lee Dixon, in his final appearance for the Gunners, getting their goal.\n\nIn March 2003, just seven months after his retirement and with Arsenal [[BBC Sport]] named Adams as the former Arsenal player that the club would most benefit from returning.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/2872203.stm | work=BBC News | title=Blast from the past: Part one | date=24 March 2003 | first=Tom | last=Fordyce}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Adams was inducted into the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] in recognition of his impact on the English game, and in 2008 he was placed third in the 50 Greatest Gunners poll on the club's website.\n\nA statue of Adams was placed outside Emirates Stadium in celebration of the club's 125th anniversary on 9 December 2011.

England lost all three games, but Adams scored one of England's two goals in the tournament in a 3\u20131 defeat to the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]]. He was the first player to represent England who had been born after the 1966 World Cup win.\n\nAfter a highly promising start to his international career, Adams suffered a series of setbacks during the early 1990s. He was surprisingly left out of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] squad by manager [[Bobby Robson]], and missed [[UEFA Euro 1992]] due to injury. However, he still maintained a regular place in defence, and after the retirement of [[Gary Lineker]] in 1992, Adams unofficially shared the captaincy of England with [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]], though Adams became England captain outright before [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 96]], as Platt's place in the side became less secure. England reached the semi-finals of Euro 96, before losing on [[penalty shootout (football)|penalties]] to [[Germany national football team|Germany]].\n\nWhen England manager [[Glenn Hoddle]] took the captain's armband from Adams and gave it to [[Alan Shearer]], it was a bitter pill for Adams to swallow. Speaking at a fans' forum in 2008, Adams remarked, \"I have some resentment over the way Glenn Hoddle gave the captaincy to Alan Shearer instead of me but I can let that go. I reacted positively. I disagreed with him [Hoddle] and he thought Alan could get more penalties being a centre forward. People know my reaction to that\".{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\nAdams continued to play for the national side, however and he finally appeared in a World Cup finals in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]]. His international swansong was England's unsuccessful [[UEFA Euro 2000]] campaign. With Shearer retiring from international football after the tournament, Adams regained the captaincy. However, within months, England lost a World Cup qualifier to Germany in October 2000, the match being the last to be staged at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], before the stadium was torn down for rebuilding. That match was Adams's 60th Wembley appearance, a record. With [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]] eventually taking the helm and under increasing pressure for his place from the emerging and improving [[Rio Ferdinand]], Adams retired from international football, having made sixty-six appearances,<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/adams-intl.html| title = Tony Alexander Adams \u2013 International Appearances| accessdate = 24 October 2008}}</ref> before Eriksson picked his first squad. He was the last England player to score at the old Wembley Stadium when he scored England's second goal in a 2\u20130 friendly win over [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] on 31 May 2000. This was also his first goal since he scored in a friendly against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] in November 1988, thus making the record for the longest gap between goals for England.\n\nAdams was the first, and remains to date the only, England player to make tournament appearances in three separate decades.\n\n==Managerial and coaching career==\nAfter starting a [[sports science]] degree at [[Brunel University]], Adams became the manager of [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]] in November 2003. He was unable to prevent the club's relegation to [[Football League Two|League Two]] that season, and although the club were top of the table in August 2004, a loss of form saw them fall down the table.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wycombe_wanderers/3995677.stm | title=Adams resigns as Wycombe manager | work=BBC Sport | date=9 November 2004 | accessdate=25 March 2010 | location=London}}</ref> He resigned from Wycombe in November 2004, citing personal reasons.

He offered several explanations, one of them being that the universe, even one that is fully random (or at [[thermal equilibrium]]), would spontaneously fluctuate to a more ordered (or low-[[entropy]]) state. One criticism of this \"Boltzmann universe\" hypothesis is that the most common thermal fluctuations are as close to equilibrium overall as possible; thus, by any reasonable criterion, actual humans in the actual universe would be vastly less likely than \"Boltzmann brains\" existing alone in an empty universe.\n\nBoltzmann brains gained new relevance around 2002, when some cosmologists started to become concerned that, in many existing theories about the Universe, human brains in the current Universe appear to be vastly outnumbered by Boltzmann brains in the future Universe who, by chance, have exactly the same perceptions that we do; this leads to the conclusion that statistically we ourselves are likely to be Boltzmann brains. Such a ''reductio ad absurdum'' argument is sometimes used to argue against certain theories of the Universe. When applied to more recent theories about the [[multiverse]], Boltzmann brain arguments are part of the unsolved [[measure problem (cosmology)|measure problem of cosmology]]. Boltzmann brains remain a thought experiment; physicists do not believe that we are actually Boltzmann brains, but rather use the thought experiment as a tool for evaluating competing scientific theories.\n\n==Boltzmann universe==\nIn 1896, the mathematician [[Ernst Zermelo]] advanced a theory that the [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]] was absolute rather than statistical.<ref>[[:de:Stephen Brush|Brush, S. G.]], ''Nebulous Earth: A History of Modern Planetary Physics'' ([[Cambridge]]: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1996), [https://books.google.cz/books?id=vTBZyesS08kC&pg=PA129#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 129].</ref> Zermelo bolstered his theory by pointing out that the [[Poincar\u00e9 recurrence theorem]] shows statistical entropy in a closed system must eventually be a periodic function; therefore, the Second Law, which is always observed to increase entropy, is unlikely to be statistical. To counter Zermelo's argument, the Austrian physicist [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] advanced two theories. The first theory, now believed to be the correct one, is that the Universe started for some unknown reason in a low-entropy state. The second and alternative theory, published in 1896 but attributed in 1895 to Boltzmann's assistant [[Ignaz Sch\u00fctz]], is the \"Boltzmann universe\" scenario. In this scenario, the Universe spends the vast majority of eternity in a featureless state of [[Heat death of the universe|heat death]]; however, over enough eons, eventually a very rare thermal fluctuation will occur where atoms bounce off each other in exactly such a way that it creates substructures such as our entire observable universe. Boltzmann argues that, while most of the Universe is featureless, we do not see those regions because they are devoid of intelligent life; to Boltzmann, it is unremarkable that we view solely the interior of our Boltzmann universe, as that is the only place where intelligent life lives. (This may be the first use in modern science of the [[anthropic principle]]).<ref name=\"carroll2017\">[[Sean M. Carroll|Carroll, S.

Physicist [[Richard Feynman]] published a similar counterargument within his widely-read 1964 ''[[Feynman Lectures on Physics]]''. By 2004, physicists had pushed Eddington's observation to its logical conclusion: the most numerous observers in an eternity of thermal fluctuations would be minimal \"Boltzmann brains\" popping up in an otherwise featureless universe.<ref name=\"carroll2017\"/><ref name=\"Albrecht & Sorbo\">{{cite journal |last=Albrecht |first=Andreas |authorlink=Andreas Albrecht (cosmologist) |last2=Sorbo |first2=Lorenzo |date=September 2004 |title=Can the universe afford inflation? |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:hep-th/0405270 |journal=[[Physical Review|Physical Review D]] |volume=70 |issue=6 |page=063528 |bibcode=2004PhRvD..70f3528A |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.70.063528 |accessdate=16 December 2014 |arxiv=hep-th/0405270}}</ref>\n\n==Creation==\nIn the universe's eventual state of [[ergodic]] \"heat death\", given enough time, every possible structure (including every possible brain) gets formed via random fluctuation. The timescale for this is related to the Poincar\u00e9 recurrence time.<ref name=\"carroll2017\"/><ref name=nbc/><ref name=linde/> Boltzmann-style thought experiments focus on structures like human brains that are presumably self-aware observers. Given any arbitrary criteria for what constitutes a Boltzmann brain (or planet, or universe), smaller structures that minimally and barely meet the criteria are vastly and exponentially more common than larger structures; a rough analogy is how the odds of a real English word showing up when you shake a box of ''[[Scrabble]]'' letters are greater than the odds that a whole English sentence or paragraph will form.<ref name=nytimes/> The average timescale required for formation of a Boltzmann brain is vastly greater than the current age of the Universe. In modern physics, Boltzmann brains can be formed either by [[quantum fluctuation]], or by a [[thermal fluctuation]] generally involving [[nucleation]].<ref name=\"carroll2017\"/>\n\n===Via quantum fluctuation===\nBy one calculation, a Boltzmann brain would appear as a quantum fluctuation in the vacuum after a time interval of <math>10^{10^{50}}</math> years. This fluctuation can occur even in a true [[Minkowski space|Minkowski vacuum]] (a flat spacetime vacuum lacking [[vacuum energy]]). Quantum mechanics heavily favors smaller fluctuations that \"borrow\" the least amount of energy from the vacuum. Typically, a quantum Boltzmann brain would suddenly appear from the vacuum (alongside an equivalent amount of virtual antimatter), remain only long enough to have a single coherent thought or observation, and then disappear into the vacuum as suddenly as it appeared. Such a brain is completely self-contained, and can never radiate energy out to infinity.<ref name=\"davenport\">Davenport, M., & Olum, K. D. (2010). Are there Boltzmann brains in the vacuum. arXiv preprint arXiv:1008.0808.</ref>\n\n===Via nucleation===\nCurrent evidence suggests that the vacuum permeating the observable Universe is not a Minkowski space, but rather a [[de Sitter space]] with a positive [[cosmological constant]].<ref>[[Viatcheslav Mukhanov|Mukhanov, V.]], ''Physical Foundations of Cosmology'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=OqIgAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA30 p. 30].</ref>{{rp|30}} In a de Sitter vacuum (but not in a Minkowski vacuum), a Boltzmann brain can form via nucleation of non-virtual particles gradually assembled by chance from the [[Hawking radiation]] emitted from the de Sitter space's bounded [[cosmological horizon]]. One estimate for the average time required until nucleation is around <math>10^{10^{69}}</math> years.<ref name=\"davenport\"/> A typical nucleated Boltzmann brain will, after it finishes its activity, cool off to absolute zero and eventually completely decay, as any isolated object would in the vacuum of space. Unlike the quantum fluctuation case, the Boltzmann brain will radiate energy out to infinity. In nucleation, the most common fluctuations are as close to thermal equilibrium overall as possible given whatever arbitrary criteria are provided for labeling a fluctuation a \"Boltzmann brain\".<ref name=\"carroll2017\"/>\n\nTheoretically a Boltzmann brain can also form, albeit again with a tiny probability, at any time during the matter-dominated early universe.<ref name=\"bousso\">Bousso, R., Freivogel, B., & Yang, I.

He offered several explanations, one of them being that the universe, even one that is fully random (or at [[thermal equilibrium]]), would spontaneously fluctuate to a more ordered (or low-[[entropy]]) state. One criticism of this \"Boltzmann universe\" hypothesis is that the most common thermal fluctuations are as close to equilibrium overall as possible; thus, by any reasonable criterion, actual humans in the actual universe would be vastly less likely than \"Boltzmann brains\" existing alone in an empty universe.\n\nBoltzmann brains gained new relevance around 2002, when some cosmologists started to become concerned that, in many existing theories about the Universe, human brains in the current Universe appear to be vastly outnumbered by Boltzmann brains in the future Universe who, by chance, have exactly the same perceptions that we do; this leads to the conclusion that statistically we ourselves are likely to be Boltzmann brains. Such a ''reductio ad absurdum'' argument is sometimes used to argue against certain theories of the Universe. When applied to more recent theories about the [[multiverse]], Boltzmann brain arguments are part of the unsolved [[measure problem (cosmology)|measure problem of cosmology]]. Boltzmann brains remain a thought experiment; physicists do not believe that we are actually Boltzmann brains, but rather use the thought experiment as a tool for evaluating competing scientific theories.\n\n==Boltzmann universe==\nIn 1896, the mathematician [[Ernst Zermelo]] advanced a theory that the [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]] was absolute rather than statistical.<ref>[[:de:Stephen Brush|Brush, S. G.]], ''Nebulous Earth: A History of Modern Planetary Physics'' ([[Cambridge]]: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1996), [https://books.google.cz/books?id=vTBZyesS08kC&pg=PA129#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 129].</ref> Zermelo bolstered his theory by pointing out that the [[Poincar\u00e9 recurrence theorem]] shows statistical entropy in a closed system must eventually be a periodic function; therefore, the Second Law, which is always observed to increase entropy, is unlikely to be statistical. To counter Zermelo's argument, the Austrian physicist [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] advanced two theories. The first theory, now believed to be the correct one, is that the Universe started for some unknown reason in a low-entropy state. The second and alternative theory, published in 1896 but attributed in 1895 to Boltzmann's assistant [[Ignaz Sch\u00fctz]], is the \"Boltzmann universe\" scenario. In this scenario, the Universe spends the vast majority of eternity in a featureless state of [[Heat death of the universe|heat death]]; however, over enough eons, eventually a very rare thermal fluctuation will occur where atoms bounce off each other in exactly such a way that it creates substructures such as our entire observable universe. Boltzmann argues that, while most of the Universe is featureless, we do not see those regions because they are devoid of intelligent life; to Boltzmann, it is unremarkable that we view solely the interior of our Boltzmann universe, as that is the only place where intelligent life lives. (This may be the first use in modern science of the [[anthropic principle]]).<ref name=\"carroll2017\">[[Sean M. Carroll|Carroll, S.

Physicist [[Richard Feynman]] published a similar counterargument within his widely-read 1964 ''[[Feynman Lectures on Physics]]''. By 2004, physicists had pushed Eddington's observation to its logical conclusion: the most numerous observers in an eternity of thermal fluctuations would be minimal \"Boltzmann brains\" popping up in an otherwise featureless universe.<ref name=\"carroll2017\"/><ref name=\"Albrecht & Sorbo\">{{cite journal |last=Albrecht |first=Andreas |authorlink=Andreas Albrecht (cosmologist) |last2=Sorbo |first2=Lorenzo |date=September 2004 |title=Can the universe afford inflation? |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:hep-th/0405270 |journal=[[Physical Review|Physical Review D]] |volume=70 |issue=6 |page=063528 |bibcode=2004PhRvD..70f3528A |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.70.063528 |accessdate=16 December 2014 |arxiv=hep-th/0405270}}</ref>\n\n==Creation==\nIn the universe's eventual state of [[ergodic]] \"heat death\", given enough time, every possible structure (including every possible brain) gets formed via random fluctuation. The timescale for this is related to the Poincar\u00e9 recurrence time.<ref name=\"carroll2017\"/><ref name=nbc/><ref name=linde/> Boltzmann-style thought experiments focus on structures like human brains that are presumably self-aware observers. Given any arbitrary criteria for what constitutes a Boltzmann brain (or planet, or universe), smaller structures that minimally and barely meet the criteria are vastly and exponentially more common than larger structures; a rough analogy is how the odds of a real English word showing up when you shake a box of ''[[Scrabble]]'' letters are greater than the odds that a whole English sentence or paragraph will form.<ref name=nytimes/> The average timescale required for formation of a Boltzmann brain is vastly greater than the current age of the Universe. In modern physics, Boltzmann brains can be formed either by [[quantum fluctuation]], or by a [[thermal fluctuation]] generally involving [[nucleation]].<ref name=\"carroll2017\"/>\n\n===Via quantum fluctuation===\nBy one calculation, a Boltzmann brain would appear as a quantum fluctuation in the vacuum after a time interval of <math>10^{10^{50}}</math> years. This fluctuation can occur even in a true [[Minkowski space|Minkowski vacuum]] (a flat spacetime vacuum lacking [[vacuum energy]]). Quantum mechanics heavily favors smaller fluctuations that \"borrow\" the least amount of energy from the vacuum. Typically, a quantum Boltzmann brain would suddenly appear from the vacuum (alongside an equivalent amount of virtual antimatter), remain only long enough to have a single coherent thought or observation, and then disappear into the vacuum as suddenly as it appeared. Such a brain is completely self-contained, and can never radiate energy out to infinity.<ref name=\"davenport\">Davenport, M., & Olum, K. D. (2010).

One estimate for the average time required until nucleation is around <math>10^{10^{69}}</math> years.<ref name=\"davenport\"/> A typical nucleated Boltzmann brain will, after it finishes its activity, cool off to absolute zero and eventually completely decay, as any isolated object would in the vacuum of space. Unlike the quantum fluctuation case, the Boltzmann brain will radiate energy out to infinity. In nucleation, the most common fluctuations are as close to thermal equilibrium overall as possible given whatever arbitrary criteria are provided for labeling a fluctuation a \"Boltzmann brain\".<ref name=\"carroll2017\"/>\n\nTheoretically a Boltzmann brain can also form, albeit again with a tiny probability, at any time during the matter-dominated early universe.<ref name=\"bousso\">Bousso, R., Freivogel, B., & Yang, I.
