He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

The line-up for his performance was May on vocals and lead guitar, [[Cozy Powell]] on drums and percussion, [[Mike Moran (music producer)|Mike Moran]] and [[Rick Wakeman]] on keyboards, and [[Maggie Ryder]], [[Miriam Stockley]] and [[Chris Thompson (English musician)|Chris Thompson]] on backing vocals.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://jazzbluesrock.online/2018/12/guitar-legends-expo-92-sevilla/ |title=Guitar Legends \u2013 Expo \u201992 Sevilla |website=jazzbluesrock.online |url-status=live |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> The original line-up was May on vocals and lead guitar, Powell on drums and percussion, [[Michael Casswell]] on guitar, [[Neil Murray (British musician)|Neil Murray]] on bass, and Ryder, Stockley and Thompson on backing vocals. This version of the band was together only during the South American support tour (supporting [[The B-52's]] and [[Joe Cocker]]) on five dates.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lemieux|first1=Patrick|title=The Queen Chronology|date=2018|publisher=Lulu|page=137|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nAfterwards, May made significant changes, feeling the group never quite gelled. May brought guitarist [[Jamie Moses]] on board to replace Mike Caswell. The backing vocalists, Ryder, Stockley and Thompson, were replaced by [[Catherine Porter]] and [[Shelley Preston]]. On 23&nbsp;February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting [[Guns N' Roses]] and headlining a few dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/brian.htm#1993bttlnorthamerica1|title=1993 Back To The Light North American Tour (1st leg)|publisher=Ultimatequeen.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The tour included dates in North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan. After the tour ended on 18&nbsp;December 1993, May returned to the studio with fellow surviving Queen band members Roger Taylor and [[John Deacon]] to work on tracks that became ''Made in Heaven'', the final Queen studio album.<ref name=\"Buckley\">Buckley, Peter (2003). \"The Rough Guide to Rock\". p.837.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E. Conway EP entitled ''Retro Rock Special'' was attached to some pressings of the ''Another World'' album.  The Conway character was retired at the end of the tour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/brian-may-guide-queen-guitarists-eccentricities-obessions/|first=Adam|last=White|title=From badgers to flamboyant alter egos: a guide to the strange obsessions of Queen's Brian May|date=19 July 2017|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>\nIn May 1999, May recorded lead guitars for the Guns N' Roses song \"Catcher in the Rye\" on ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'', however, his performance was removed from the album by the time it was released in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/07/brian-may-chinese-democracy|title=Brian May dropped from Guns N' Roses album|last=Anthony|first=James|date=7 November 2008|website=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132010===\n[[File:Queen 2005 1010016.JPG|thumb|May performing in Frankfurt in 2005.]]\nFrom his last solo release in 1998, May has been performing as a solo artist, as part of an ensemble, and infrequently as Queen with Roger Taylor.

However, the Red Special was so successful that May had no need to build another guitar.<ref name=\"The Spade\"/> These plans were eventually given to guitar [[luthier]] Andrew Guyton in around 2004/05, some slight modifications were made and the guitar was built.

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\" \"Chinese Torture\"); [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"); [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"); slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"); [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"); tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\"); and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"Good Company\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

Some of the non-RS electric guitars he used in the studio included:\n*[[Burns London|Burns]] Double Six on \"Long Away\" (1976)<ref name=\"MR\"/> and \"Under Pressure\" (1981).\n*Fender Telecaster on \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" (1979).<ref name=\"MR\"/> It was used for the video (but not the recordings) of \"Back Chat\" (1982).\n*Gibson Firebird on \"Hammer to Fall\" and \"Tear It Up\" (album versions only, not on stage).\n*[[Ibanez JS Series|Ibanez JS]] on \"Nothing But Blue\" (1991).\n*[[Parker Fly]] on \"Mother Love\" (1993\u20131995).\n\nFor acoustic, he favoured Ovation,<ref name=\"MR\"/> Martin, [[T\u014dkai Guitars|T\u014dkai]] Hummingbird, Godin and Guild. On a couple of videos, he also used some different electric guitars: a Stratocaster copy on \"Play the Game\" (1980) and a [[Washburn RR-V Tour Series|Washburn RR2V]] on \"Princes of the Universe\" (1986).\n\nIn 1984, [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]] released the first official Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on the headstock (May's original one has a sixpence).\n\n====Amplifiers and effects====\n[[File:VOX AC30 Twin.jpg|thumb|The [[Vox AC30]] amplifier]]\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = I've never heard a guitar sound so loud!

He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox&nbsp;AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, [[flanger]] and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"Hammer to Fall\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would step in occasionally (such as on \"Save Me\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUyPyTn-IS4 |title=Queen Save Me (Live) |website=youtube.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and \"Flash\").<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sheetmusic-free.com/flash-theme-sheet-music-queen/ |title=Flash Theme Sheet Music Queen |website=sheetmusic-free.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano.

He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well. He used a [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] plastic piano in \"Teo Torriatte\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/queen/songs/a-day-at-the-races.htm |title=A Day At The Races |website=ultimatequeen.co.uk |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and a toy mini [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]] in \"The Prophet's Song\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=gZ5ZCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA189&lpg=PA189&dq=may+mini+koto+prophets+song&source=bl&ots=Q2wEPJDBsB&sig=ACfU3U0yjtTueqXty7NPHUjjdkv2NJqqUw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiG3Lu70t7oAhVWG80KHSjiCoYQ6AEwCXoECBIQKw#v=onepage&q=may%20mini%20koto%20prophets%20song&f=false |title=The Bible in Music: A Dictionary of Songs, Works, and More |last=Long |first= Siobh\u00e1n Dowling  |last2=Sawyer |first2=John F.A. |website=books.google.ca |publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]] |page=189 |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Vocals====\nMay is also an accomplished singer. From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].  On-screen, it was performed entirely by puppets.\n\n==Scientific career==\n[[File:Rock Star and Astrophysicist Brian May Visits Paranal.jpg|thumbnail|May in 2015 at [[Paranal Observatory]]]]\n{{See also|List of celebrities with advanced degrees}}\nMay studied physics and mathematics at [[Imperial College London]], graduating with a BSc (Hons) degree and [[Associate of the Royal College of Science|ARCS]] in physics with [[Second-class honours|Upper Second-Class Honours]].

Harold May''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE}} (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and astrophysicist. He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

An earlier version of the band had been loosely formed for 19&nbsp;October 1991, when May took part in the Guitar Legends guitar festival in [[Seville]], Spain. The line-up for his performance was May on vocals and lead guitar, [[Cozy Powell]] on drums and percussion, [[Mike Moran (music producer)|Mike Moran]] and [[Rick Wakeman]] on keyboards, and [[Maggie Ryder]], [[Miriam Stockley]] and [[Chris Thompson (English musician)|Chris Thompson]] on backing vocals.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://jazzbluesrock.online/2018/12/guitar-legends-expo-92-sevilla/ |title=Guitar Legends \u2013 Expo \u201992 Sevilla |website=jazzbluesrock.online |url-status=live |access-date=9 April 2020}}</ref> The original line-up was May on vocals and lead guitar, Powell on drums and percussion, [[Michael Casswell]] on guitar, [[Neil Murray (British musician)|Neil Murray]] on bass, and Ryder, Stockley and Thompson on backing vocals. This version of the band was together only during the South American support tour (supporting [[The B-52's]] and [[Joe Cocker]]) on five dates.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lemieux|first1=Patrick|title=The Queen Chronology|date=2018|publisher=Lulu|page=137|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nAfterwards, May made significant changes, feeling the group never quite gelled. May brought guitarist [[Jamie Moses]] on board to replace Mike Caswell. The backing vocalists, Ryder, Stockley and Thompson, were replaced by [[Catherine Porter]] and [[Shelley Preston]]. On 23&nbsp;February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting [[Guns N' Roses]] and headlining a few dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/brian.htm#1993bttlnorthamerica1|title=1993 Back To The Light North American Tour (1st leg)|publisher=Ultimatequeen.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The tour included dates in North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan. After the tour ended on 18&nbsp;December 1993, May returned to the studio with fellow surviving Queen band members Roger Taylor and [[John Deacon]] to work on tracks that became ''Made in Heaven'', the final Queen studio album.<ref name=\"Buckley\">Buckley, Peter (2003). \"The Rough Guide to Rock\". p.837.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E. Conway EP entitled ''Retro Rock Special'' was attached to some pressings of the ''Another World'' album.  The Conway character was retired at the end of the tour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/brian-may-guide-queen-guitarists-eccentricities-obessions/|first=Adam|last=White|title=From badgers to flamboyant alter egos: a guide to the strange obsessions of Queen's Brian May|date=19 July 2017|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>\nIn May 1999, May recorded lead guitars for the Guns N' Roses song \"Catcher in the Rye\" on ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'', however, his performance was removed from the album by the time it was released in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/07/brian-may-chinese-democracy|title=Brian May dropped from Guns N' Roses album|last=Anthony|first=James|date=7 November 2008|website=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132010===\n[[File:Queen 2005 1010016.JPG|thumb|May performing in Frankfurt in 2005.]]\nFrom his last solo release in 1998, May has been performing as a solo artist, as part of an ensemble, and infrequently as Queen with Roger Taylor.

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\" \"Chinese Torture\"); [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"); [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"); slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"); [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"); tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\"); and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"Good Company\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

On a couple of videos, he also used some different electric guitars: a Stratocaster copy on \"Play the Game\" (1980) and a [[Washburn RR-V Tour Series|Washburn RR2V]] on \"Princes of the Universe\" (1986).\n\nIn 1984, [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]] released the first official Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on the headstock (May's original one has a sixpence).\n\n====Amplifiers and effects====\n[[File:VOX AC30 Twin.jpg|thumb|The [[Vox AC30]] amplifier]]\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = I've never heard a guitar sound so loud!

He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox&nbsp;AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, [[flanger]] and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"Hammer to Fall\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would step in occasionally (such as on \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUyPyTn-IS4 |title=Queen Save Me (Live) |website=youtube.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\").<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sheetmusic-free.com/flash-theme-sheet-music-queen/ |title=Flash Theme Sheet Music Queen |website=sheetmusic-free.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano.

He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well.

From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].

This we believe will more certainly come to pass, through the aid of the Lord, if we bestow suitable favors and special graces on those Catholic kings and princes, who, like athletes and intrepid champions of the Christian faith, as we know by the evidence of facts, not only restrain the savage excesses of the Saracens and of other infidels, enemies of the Christian name, but also for the defense and increase of the faith vanquish them and their kingdoms and habitations, though situated in the remotest parts unknown to us, and ...\n\nthe said infante ... believing that he would best perform his duty to God in this matter, if by his effort and industry that sea might become navigable as far as to the Indians who are said to worship the name of Christ, and that thus he might be able to enter into relation with them, and to incite them to aid the Christians against the Saracens ...\n\n ... to conserve their right and possession, [the said king and infante] under certain most severe penalties then expressed, have prohibited and in general have ordained that none, unless with their sailors and ships and on payment of a certain tribute and with an express license previously obtained from the said king or infante, should presume to sail to the said provinces or to trade in their ports or to fish in the sea,\n\n ... since we had formerly by other letters of ours granted among other things free and ample faculty to the  aforesaid King Alfonso \u2013 to invade, search out, capture, vanquish, and subdue all Saracens and pagans whatsoever, and other enemies of Christ wheresoever placed, and the kingdoms, dukedoms, principalities, dominions, possessions, and all movable and immovable goods whatsoever held and possessed by them and to reduce their persons to perpetual slavery, and to apply and appropriate to himself and his successors the kingdoms, dukedoms, counties, principalities, dominions, possessions, and goods, and to convert them to his and their use and profit \u2013 by having secured the said faculty, the said King Alfonso, or, by his authority, the aforesaid infante, justly and lawfully has acquired and possessed, and doth possess, these islands, lands, harbors, and seas, and they do of right belong and pertain to the said King Alfonso and his successors, nor without special license from King Alfonso and his successors themselves has any other even of the faithful of Christ been entitled hitherto, nor is he by any means now entitled lawfully to meddle therewith.<ref>[http://www.nativeweb.org/pages/legal/indig-romanus-pontifex.html Pope Nicholas V, \"Romanus Pontifex\", January 8, 1455, Indigenous People]</ref>}}\n\n==Effect==\nKing Afonso V gave a ceremonial lecture on the bull in [[Lisbon Cathedral]] on October 5, 1455 to inform the foreign representatives of commerce.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/eurvoya/relex.html |title=University of Calgary: Religion & Exploration |accessdate=2007-12-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218151827/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/eurvoya/relex.html |archivedate=December 18, 2007 }}</ref> With the bull the Portuguese had a monopoly for trade in the new areas in Africa and Asia.

Together, the ''Dum Diversas'', the ''Romanus Pontifex'' and the ''Inter Caetera'' have been interpreted as serving as a justification for the [[Age of Imperialism]]. They were also early influences on the development of the [[slave trade]] of the 15th and 16th centuries, even though the papal bull [[Sublimus Dei]] of 1537 forbade the enslavement of non-Christians. The executive brief for Sublimus Dei was withdrawn by the Pope after protests by the Spanish monarchy. Paul III publicly sanctioned slavery in Rome in 1545, the enslavement of [[Henry VIII]] in 1547 and the purchase of Muslim slaves in 1548.<ref>\"The Catholic Church and Slavery\", J.

Portugal sustained her claim to the Brazils by the same title.<ref name=Marshall/></blockquote>\n\nMost of the opinion is [[dicta]]; thus, all that the opinion holds with respect to aboriginal title is that it is inalienable, a principle that remains well-established law in nearly all common law jurisdictions.\n\nThis decision was upheld in the 1831 case ''[[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]'', giving Georgia authority to extend state laws over [[Cherokee]]s within the state, and famously describing Native American tribes as \"domestic dependent nations.\" This decision was modified in ''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]'', which stated that the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]], and not individual [[U.S. state|states]], had authority in Indian affairs, but it maintained the loss of right to title upon discovery by Europeans.\n\nIn recent years, Native American groups including the [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] and [[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]] have called on the [[Holy See|Vatican]] to revoke the bulls of 1452, 1455, and 1493. The [[Haudenosaunee]] countered the papal bulls with the [[Two Row Wampum]] conditionally accepting the bulls stating through the two row wampum \"You say that you are our Father and I am your Son We will not be like Father and Son, but like Brothers.

Georgia]]'', giving Georgia authority to extend state laws over [[Cherokee]]s within the state, and famously describing Native American tribes as \"domestic dependent nations.\" This decision was modified in ''[[Worcester v.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921. In 1922 he made an effort to establish Rugby League in the Tauranga area which failed however he did play matches for Tauranga and a Bay of Plenty league team who played against Auckland and the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] team.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move. Newton went on to win the Roope Rooster for the first time in their clubs history<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Roope Rooster Competition/Final Won by Newton/Game Played in Downpour\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>. \n\nIles was picked to play for Auckland against New Zealand on May 24. It was the first of 3 games he would play for them this season. The match was a warmup for the Australian Tour for the New Zealand side and was won by New Zealand 25-19 in front of 8,000 spectators at the [[Auckland Domain]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title =New Zealand Beats Auckland/Keenly Contested Game\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17170\n| date = 1919-05-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190526.2.105.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches. The Returned Soldiers team won 26-24 with Iles scoring two second half tries for the losing Auckland team<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Northern Union Grade\n| page =9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 172\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190722.2.130\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His last ever match in an Auckland jersey was played against [[Rugby League Hawkes Bay|Hawke\u2019s Bay]] at [[Eden Park]] on August 9 with 9,000 watching on. Iles scored two more tries. The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. After this tour they returned home and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] sent a touring team to New Zealand<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kangaroos Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/kangaroos-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand. They would go on to win 26-10 in front of 6,000<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game/Australia v New Zealand/Visitors Outclassed\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 288\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190901.2.78\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In a bizarre situation Iles played for Auckland against his own Bay of Plenty union in a match on 31 July when an Auckland back was unable to make the trip to Tauranga and Iles was asked to take his place. Bay of Plenty won 17-10 but Iles played brilliantly and comment was made that he shouldn't have been left out of the Bay team in the first place\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Bay of Plenty Footballers Defeat Auckland Representatives\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7464, 2 August 1920, Page 3\n| date = 1920-08-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200802.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

His debut season in the code continued to be an impressive one.

The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. They made efforts to organise a game with the newly formed Rotorua league team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8079\n| date = 1922-09-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220902.2.4\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He was still playing rugby union through this period and played for Tauranga in a drawn match with Rangataua in June\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rugby Union's Cup Matches Continued/Tauranga and Rangataua Play a Draw\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8007\n| date = 1922-06-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220612.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. On August 28 he wrote another letter suggesting a match between those players who had been selected for the Tauranga rugby union team and those who had not as there had evidently been some controversy over selections<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Challenge\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8075\n| date = 1922-08-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220829.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nOn the 16th of September history was made in Tauranga with the first ever game of rugby keague played there. Tauranga took on the Rotorua team on the Tauranga Domain. As well as George Iles playing, David Borell and Arthur Iles also played in the match. Rotorua won a high scoring match 29-28 with both Iles and Borell scoring tries\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rotorua Wins by One Point\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8092\n| date = 1922-09-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220918.2.24\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.\n\nA game against the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] was also arranged which was a remarkable achievement in itself given that rugby league was not even played in the area until a month earlier. The match was between New South Wales and Bay of Plenty. George Iles naturally played and the team also featured future Kiwi [[George Gardiner (rugby league)|George Gardiner]] while the visiting NSW team featured the likes of [[Frank Burge]] and [[Reg Latta]]. New South Wales won the match 29 points to 5 with Borell scoring a try and Joseph Rogers kicking a goal for the local team\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Kangaroos 29 Bay of Plenty 5\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8101\n| date = 1922-09-28\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220928.2.33\n| accessdate = 2020-04-11}}</ref>.\n\nOn September 30 Tauranga again made history by playing in the first ever rugby league game in [[Te Puke]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.3\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from throughout the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. On October 14 Tauranga played a match on the Waihi Recreation Ground and lost 6-19 in front of a large attendance, Iles again leading the Tauranga team\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =The Waihi-Tauranga League Match\n| page =2\n| publisher =Waihi Daily Telegraph, Volume XX, Issue 6741\n| date = 1922-10-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/WHDT19221016.2.23\n| accessdate = 2020-04-11}}</ref>. These efforts to grow the game in the area, while somewhat remarkable, ultimately proved futile and Iles returned to the rugby union field the following season.\n\n===Back to Rugby Union===\nIn 1923 he played for Tauranga rugby team against Te Puke in [[Te Puke]] and then again in the return match in [[Tauranga]]. He was also turning out for the Cadets Old Boys senior side in the club competition <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rugby Football on Monday Next/Te Puke Representatives to Visit Tauranga\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8302\n| date = 1923-05-31\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19230531.2.14\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

They then beat Whakatane in the semi final. On August 2 [[Karl Ifwersen]] brought down a team from Auckland from the Grammar Old Boys, College Rifles and Ponsonby clubs to play against a Tauranga XV captained by George Iles.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921. In 1922 he made an effort to establish Rugby League in the Tauranga area which failed however he did play matches for Tauranga and a Bay of Plenty league team who played against Auckland and the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] team.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In a bizarre situation Iles played for Auckland against his own Bay of Plenty union in a match on 31 July when an Auckland back was unable to make the trip to Tauranga and Iles was asked to take his place. Bay of Plenty won 17-10 but Iles played brilliantly and comment was made that he shouldn't have been left out of the Bay team in the first place\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Bay of Plenty Footballers Defeat Auckland Representatives\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7464, 2 August 1920, Page 3\n| date = 1920-08-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200802.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. They made efforts to organise a game with the newly formed Rotorua league team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8079\n| date = 1922-09-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220902.2.4\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He was still playing rugby union through this period and played for Tauranga in a drawn match with Rangataua in June\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rugby Union's Cup Matches Continued/Tauranga and Rangataua Play a Draw\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8007\n| date = 1922-06-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220612.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. On August 28 he wrote another letter suggesting a match between those players who had been selected for the Tauranga rugby union team and those who had not as there had evidently been some controversy over selections<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Challenge\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8075\n| date = 1922-08-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220829.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nOn the 16th of September history was made in Tauranga with the first ever game of rugby keague played there. Tauranga took on the Rotorua team on the Tauranga Domain. As well as George Iles playing, David Borell and Arthur Iles also played in the match. Rotorua won a high scoring match 29-28 with both Iles and Borell scoring tries\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rotorua Wins by One Point\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8092\n| date = 1922-09-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220918.2.24\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.\n\nA game against the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] was also arranged which was a remarkable achievement in itself given that rugby league was not even played in the area until a month earlier. The match was between New South Wales and Bay of Plenty. George Iles naturally played and the team also featured future Kiwi [[George Gardiner (rugby league)|George Gardiner]] while the visiting NSW team featured the likes of [[Frank Burge]] and [[Reg Latta]]. New South Wales won the match 29 points to 5 with Borell scoring a try and Joseph Rogers kicking a goal for the local team\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Kangaroos 29 Bay of Plenty 5\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8101\n| date = 1922-09-28\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220928.2.33\n| accessdate = 2020-04-11}}</ref>.\n\nOn September 30 Tauranga again made history by playing in the first ever rugby league game in [[Te Puke]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.3\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from throughout the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. On October 14 Tauranga played a match on the Waihi Recreation Ground and lost 6-19 in front of a large attendance, Iles again leading the Tauranga team\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =The Waihi-Tauranga League Match\n| page =2\n| publisher =Waihi Daily Telegraph, Volume XX, Issue 6741\n| date = 1922-10-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/WHDT19221016.2.23\n| accessdate = 2020-04-11}}</ref>. These efforts to grow the game in the area, while somewhat remarkable, ultimately proved futile and Iles returned to the rugby union field the following season.\n\n===Back to Rugby Union===\nIn 1923 he played for Tauranga rugby team against Te Puke in [[Te Puke]] and then again in the return match in [[Tauranga]]. He was also turning out for the Cadets Old Boys senior side in the club competition <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rugby Football on Monday Next/Te Puke Representatives to Visit Tauranga\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8302\n| date = 1923-05-31\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19230531.2.14\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

They then beat Whakatane in the semi final. On August 2 [[Karl Ifwersen]] brought down a team from Auckland from the Grammar Old Boys, College Rifles and Ponsonby clubs to play against a Tauranga XV captained by George Iles.

Some examples would be:\n*Which major will a college student choose, given their grades, stated likes and dislikes, etc.?\n*Which blood type does a person have, given the results of various diagnostic tests?\n*In a hands-free mobile phone dialing application, which person's name was spoken, given various properties of the speech signal?\n*Which candidate will a person vote for, given particular demographic characteristics?\n*Which country will a firm locate an office in, given the characteristics of the firm and of the various candidate countries?\nThese are all [[statistical classification]] problems.  They all have in common a [[dependent variable]] to be predicted that comes from one of a limited set of items that cannot be meaningfully ordered, as well as a set of [[independent variable]]s (also known as features, explanators, etc.), which are used to predict the dependent variable.  Multinomial logistic regression is a particular solution to classification problems that use a linear combination of the observed features and some problem-specific parameters to estimate the probability of each particular value of the dependent variable.  The best values of the parameters for a given problem are usually determined from some training data (e.g. some people for whom both the diagnostic test results and blood types are known, or some examples of known words being spoken).\n\n==Assumptions==\nThe multinomial logistic model assumes that data are case specific; that is, each independent variable has a single value for each case. The multinomial logistic model also assumes that the dependent variable cannot be perfectly predicted from the independent variables for any case. As with other types of regression, there is no need for the independent variables to be [[statistically independent]] from each other (unlike, for example, in a [[naive Bayes classifier]]); however, [[multicollinearity|collinearity]] is assumed to be relatively low, as it becomes difficult to differentiate between the impact of several variables if this is not the case.<ref>{{cite book | last = Belsley | first = David | title = Conditioning diagnostics : collinearity and weak data in regression | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 1991 | isbn = 9780471528890 }}</ref>\n\nIf the multinomial logit is used to model choices, it relies on the assumption of [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]] (IIA), which is not always desirable. This assumption states that the odds of preferring one class over another do not depend on the presence or absence of other \"irrelevant\" alternatives. For example, the relative probabilities of taking a car or bus to work do not change if a bicycle is added as an additional possibility. This allows the choice of ''K'' alternatives to be modeled as a set of ''K''-1 independent binary choices, in which one alternative is chosen as a \"pivot\" and the other ''K''-1 compared against it, one at a time. The IIA hypothesis is a core hypothesis in rational choice theory; however numerous studies in psychology show that individuals often violate this assumption when making choices. An example of a problem case arises if choices include a car and a blue bus. Suppose the odds ratio between the two is 1 : 1. Now if the option of a red bus is introduced, a person may be indifferent between a red and a blue bus, and hence may exhibit a car : blue bus : red bus odds ratio of 1 : 0.5 : 0.5, thus maintaining a 1 : 1 ratio of car : any bus while adopting a changed car : blue bus ratio of 1 : 0.5. Here the red bus option was not in fact irrelevant, because a red bus was a [[perfect substitute]] for a blue bus.\n\nIf the multinomial logit is used to model choices, it may in some situations impose too much constraint on the relative preferences between the different alternatives. This point is especially important to take into account if the analysis aims to predict how choices would change if one alternative was to disappear (for instance if one political candidate withdraws from a three candidate race). Other models like the [[nested logit]] or the [[multinomial probit]] may be used in such cases as they allow for violation of the IIA.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Baltas |first=G. |last2=Doyle |first2=P. |year=2001 |title=Random Utility Models in Marketing Research: A Survey |journal=[[Journal of Business Research]] |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=115\u2013125 |doi=10.1016/S0148-2963(99)00058-2 }}</ref>\n\n==Model==\n{{See also|Logistic regression}}\n\n===Introduction===\nThere are multiple equivalent ways to describe the mathematical model underlying multinomial logistic regression.  This can make it difficult to compare different treatments of the subject in different texts.  The article on [[logistic regression]] presents a number of equivalent formulations of simple logistic regression, and many of these have analogues in the multinomial logit model.\n\nThe idea behind all of them, as in many other [[statistical classification]] techniques, is to construct a [[linear predictor function]] that constructs a score from a set of weights that are [[linear combination|linearly combined]] with the explanatory variables (features) of a given observation using a [[dot product]]:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{score}(\\mathbf{X}_i,k) = \\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i,</math>\n\nwhere '''X'''<sub>''i''</sub> is the vector of explanatory variables describing observation ''i'', '''\u03b2'''<sub>''k''</sub> is a vector of weights (or [[regression coefficient]]s) corresponding to outcome ''k'', and score('''X'''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''k'') is the score associated with assigning observation ''i'' to category ''k''.  In [[discrete choice]] theory, where observations represent people and outcomes represent choices, the score is considered the [[utility]] associated with person ''i'' choosing outcome ''k''.  The predicted outcome is the one with the highest score.\n\nThe difference between the multinomial logit model and numerous other methods, models, algorithms, etc. with the same basic setup (the [[perceptron]] algorithm, [[support vector machine]]s, [[linear discriminant analysis]], etc.) is the procedure for determining (training) the optimal weights/coefficients and the way that the score is interpreted.  In particular, in the multinomial logit model, the score can directly be converted to a probability value, indicating the [[probability]] of observation ''i'' choosing outcome ''k'' given the measured characteristics of the observation.  This provides a principled way of incorporating the prediction of a particular multinomial logit model into a larger procedure that may involve multiple such predictions, each with a possibility of error.  Without such means of combining predictions, errors tend to multiply.  For example, imagine a large [[predictive modelling|predictive model]] that is broken down into a series of submodels where the prediction of a given submodel is used as the input of another submodel, and that prediction is in turn used as the input into a third submodel, etc.  If each submodel has 90% accuracy in its predictions, and there are five submodels in series, then the overall model has only 0.9<sup>5</sup> = 59% accuracy.  If each submodel has 80% accuracy, then overall accuracy drops to 0.8<sup>5</sup> = 33% accuracy.  This issue is known as [[error propagation]] and is a serious problem in real-world predictive models, which are usually composed of numerous parts.  Predicting probabilities of each possible outcome, rather than simply making a single optimal prediction, is one means of alleviating this issue.{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed for how exactly the probability estimates of each outcome can help|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Setup===\nThe basic setup is the same as in [[logistic regression]], the only difference being that the [[dependent variable]]s are [[categorical variable|categorical]] rather than [[binary variable|binary]], i.e. there are ''K'' possible outcomes rather than just two.  The following description is somewhat shortened; for more details, consult the [[logistic regression]] article.\n\n====Data points====\nSpecifically, it is assumed that we have a series of ''N'' observed data points.  Each data point ''i'' (ranging from ''1'' to ''N'') consists of a set of ''M'' explanatory variables ''x''<sub>''1,i''</sub> ... ''x''<sub>''M,i''</sub> (aka [[independent variable]]s, predictor variables, features, etc.), and an associated [[categorical variable|categorical]] outcome ''Y''<sub>''i''</sub> (aka [[dependent variable]], response variable), which can take on one of ''K'' possible values.  These possible values represent logically separate categories (e.g. different political parties, blood types, etc.), and are often described mathematically by arbitrarily assigning each a number from 1 to ''K''.  The explanatory variables and outcome represent observed properties of the data points, and are often thought of as originating in the observations of ''N'' \"experiments\" \u2014 although an \"experiment\" may consist in nothing more than gathering data.  The goal of multinomial logistic regression is to construct a model that explains the relationship between the explanatory variables and the outcome, so that the outcome of a new \"experiment\" can be correctly predicted for a new data point for which the explanatory variables, but not the outcome, are available.  In the process, the model attempts to explain the relative effect of differing explanatory variables on the outcome.\n\nSome examples:\n*The observed outcomes are different variants of a disease such as [[hepatitis]] (possibly including \"no disease\" and/or other related diseases) in a set of patients, and the explanatory variables might be characteristics of the patients thought to be pertinent (sex, race, age, [[blood pressure]], outcomes of various liver-function tests, etc.).  The goal is then to predict which disease is causing the observed liver-related symptoms in a new patient.\n*The observed outcomes are the party chosen by a set of people in an election, and the explanatory variables are the demographic characteristics of each person (e.g. sex, race, age, income, etc.).  The goal is then to predict the likely vote of a new voter with given characteristics.\n\n====Linear predictor====\nAs in other forms of linear regression, multinomial logistic regression uses a [[linear predictor function]] <math>f(k,i)</math> to predict the probability that observation ''i'' has outcome ''k'', of the following form:\n\n:<math>f(k,i) = \\beta_{0,k} + \\beta_{1,k} x_{1,i}  + \\beta_{2,k} x_{2,i} + \\cdots + \\beta_{M,k} x_{M,i},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\beta_{m,k}</math> is a [[regression coefficient]] associated with the ''m''th explanatory variable and the ''k''th outcome.  As explained in the [[logistic regression]] article, the regression coefficients and explanatory variables are normally grouped into vectors of size ''M+1'', so that the predictor function can be written more compactly:\n\n:<math>f(k,i) = \\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{x}_i,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\boldsymbol\\beta_k</math> is the set of regression coefficients associated with outcome ''k'', and <math>\\mathbf{x}_i</math> (a row vector) is the set of explanatory variables associated with observation ''i''.\n\n===As a set of independent binary regressions===\nTo arrive at the multinomial logit model, one can imagine, for ''K'' possible outcomes, running ''K''-1 independent binary logistic regression models, in which one outcome is chosen as a \"pivot\" and then the other ''K''-1 outcomes are separately regressed against the pivot outcome.  This would proceed as follows, if outcome ''K'' (the last outcome) is chosen as the pivot:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\ln \\frac{\\Pr(Y_i=1)}{\\Pr(Y_i=K)} &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i \\\\\n\\ln \\frac{\\Pr(Y_i=2)}{\\Pr(Y_i=K)} &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i \\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n\\ln \\frac{\\Pr(Y_i=K-1)}{\\Pr(Y_i=K)} &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_{K-1} \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nNote that we have introduced separate sets of regression coefficients, one for each possible outcome.\n\nIf we exponentiate both sides, and solve for the probabilities, we get:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i=1) &= {\\Pr(Y_i=K)}e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=2) &= {\\Pr(Y_i=K)}e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=K-1) &= {\\Pr(Y_i=K)}e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_{K-1} \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nUsing the fact that all ''K'' of the probabilities must sum to one, we find:\n\n:<math>\\Pr(Y_i=K) = 1- \\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} \\Pr (Y_i = k) = 1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{K-1}{\\Pr(Y_i=K)}e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\Rightarrow \\Pr(Y_i=K) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}</math>\n\nWe can use this to find the other probabilities:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i=1) &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\\n\\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=2) &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=K-1) &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_{K-1} \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe fact that we run multiple regressions reveals why the model relies on the assumption of [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]] described above.\n\n===Estimating the coefficients===\n\nThe unknown parameters in each vector ''\u03b2<sub>k</sub>'' are typically jointly estimated by [[maximum a posteriori]] (MAP) estimation, which is an extension of [[maximum likelihood]] using [[regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] of the weights to prevent pathological solutions (usually a squared regularizing function, which is equivalent to placing a zero-mean [[Gaussian distribution|Gaussian]] [[prior distribution]] on the weights, but other distributions are also possible).  The solution is typically found using an iterative procedure such as [[generalized iterative scaling]],<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Generalized iterative scaling for log-linear models |author1=Darroch, J.N.  |author2=Ratcliff, D.  |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=The Annals of Mathematical Statistics |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=1470\u20131480 |year=1972 |url=http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.aoms/1177692379 |doi=10.1214/aoms/1177692379}}</ref> [[iteratively reweighted least squares]] (IRLS),<ref>{{cite book |first=Christopher M. |last=Bishop |year=2006 |title=Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning |publisher=Springer |pages=206\u2013209}}</ref> by means of [[gradient-based optimization]] algorithms such as [[L-BFGS]],<ref name=\"malouf\"/> or by specialized [[coordinate descent]] algorithms.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Hsiang-Fu |last1=Yu |first2=Fang-Lan |last2=Huang |first3=Chih-Jen |last3=Lin |year=2011 |title=Dual coordinate descent methods for logistic regression and maximum entropy models |journal=Machine Learning |volume=85 |issue=1\u20132 |pages=41\u201375 |url=http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/maxent_dual.pdf |doi=10.1007/s10994-010-5221-8}}</ref>\n\n===As a log-linear model===\n\nThe formulation of binary logistic regression as a [[Logistic regression#log-linear model|log-linear model]] can be directly extended to multi-way regression.  That is, we model the [[logarithm]] of the probability of seeing a given output using the linear predictor as well as an additional [[normalization factor]], the logarithm of the [[partition function (mathematics)|partition function]]:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\ln \\Pr(Y_i=1) &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i - \\ln Z \\, \\\\\n\\ln \\Pr(Y_i=2) &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i - \\ln Z \\, \\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n\\ln \\Pr(Y_i=K) &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_K \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i - \\ln Z \\, \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nAs in the binary case, we need an extra term <math>- \\ln Z</math> to ensure that the whole set of probabilities forms a [[probability distribution]], i.e. so that they all sum to one:\n\n:<math>\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\Pr(Y_i=k) = 1</math>\n\nThe reason why we need to add a term to ensure normalization, rather than multiply as is usual, is because we have taken the logarithm of the probabilities.  Exponentiating both sides turns the additive term into a multiplicative factor, so that the probability is just the [[Gibbs measure]]:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i=1) &= \\frac{1}{Z} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\, \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=2) &= \\frac{1}{Z} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\, \\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=K) &= \\frac{1}{Z} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_K \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\, \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe quantity ''Z'' is called the [[partition function (mathematics)|partition function]] for the distribution. We can compute the value of the partition function by applying the above constraint that requires all probabilities to sum to 1:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n1 = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\Pr(Y_i=k) &= \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\frac{1}{Z} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\\\\n &= \\frac{1}{Z} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nTherefore:\n\n:<math>Z = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}</math>\n\nNote that this factor is \"constant\" in the sense that it is not a function of ''Y''<sub>''i''</sub>, which is the variable over which the probability distribution is defined.  However, it is definitely not constant with respect to the explanatory variables, or crucially, with respect to the unknown regression coefficients '''''\u03b2'''''<sub>''k''</sub>, which we will need to determine through some sort of [[mathematical optimization|optimization]] procedure.\n\nThe resulting equations for the probabilities are\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i=1) &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\, \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=2) &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\, \\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=K) &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_K \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k\n\\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\, \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nOr generally:\n\n:<math>\\Pr(Y_i=c) = \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_c \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}</math>\n\nThe following function:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{softmax}(k,x_1,\\ldots,x_n) = \\frac{e^{x_k}}{\\sum_{i=1}^n e^{x_i}}</math>\n\nis referred to as the [[softmax function]].  The reason is that the effect of exponentiating the values <math>x_1,\\ldots,x_n</math> is to exaggerate the differences between them.  As a result, <math>\\operatorname{softmax}(k,x_1,\\ldots,x_n)</math> will return a value close to 0 whenever ''<math>x_k</math>'' is significantly less than the maximum of all the values, and will return a value close to 1 when applied to the maximum value, unless it is extremely close to the next-largest value.  Thus, the softmax function can be used to construct a [[weighted average]] that behaves as a [[smooth function]] (which can be conveniently [[differentiation (mathematics)|differentiated]], etc.) and which approximates the [[indicator function]]\n\n:<math>f(k) = \\begin{cases}\n               1 \\; \\textrm{ if } \\; k = \\operatorname{\\arg\\max}(x_1, \\ldots, x_n), \\\\\n               0 \\; \\textrm{ otherwise}.\n              \\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nThus, we can write the probability equations as\n\n:<math>\\Pr(Y_i=c) = \\operatorname{softmax}(c, \\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol\\beta_K \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i)</math>\n\nThe softmax function thus serves as the equivalent of the [[logistic function]] in binary logistic regression.\n\nNote that not all of the <math>\\beta_k</math> vectors of coefficients are uniquely [[identifiability|identifiable]].  This is due to the fact that all probabilities must sum to 1, making one of them completely determined once all the rest are known.  As a result, there are only <math>k-1</math> separately specifiable probabilities, and hence <math>k-1</math> separately identifiable vectors of coefficients.  One way to see this is to note that if we add a constant vector to all of the coefficient vectors, the equations are identical:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{e^{(\\boldsymbol\\beta_c + C) \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{(\\boldsymbol\\beta_k + C) \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_c \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} e^{C \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} e^{C \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{C \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_c \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{e^{C \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_c \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nAs a result, it is conventional to set <math>C = -\\boldsymbol\\beta_K</math> (or alternatively, one of the other coefficient vectors).  Essentially, we set the constant so that one of the vectors becomes 0, and all of the other vectors get transformed into the difference between those vectors and the vector we chose.  This is equivalent to \"pivoting\" around one of the ''K'' choices, and examining how much better or worse all of the other ''K''-1 choices are, relative to the choice we are pivoting around.  Mathematically, we transform the coefficients as follows:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\boldsymbol\\beta'_1 &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_1 - \\boldsymbol\\beta_K \\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n\\boldsymbol\\beta'_{K-1} &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_{K-1} - \\boldsymbol\\beta_K \\\\\n\\boldsymbol\\beta'_K &= 0\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThis leads to the following equations:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i=1) &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta'_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta'_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\, \\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=K-1) &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta'_{K-1} \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta'_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\, \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=K) &= \\frac{1}{1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta'_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\, \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nOther than the prime symbols on the regression coefficients, this is exactly the same as the form of the model described above, in terms of ''K''-1 independent two-way regressions.\n\n===As a latent-variable model===\n\nIt is also possible to formulate multinomial logistic regression as a latent variable model, following the [[Logistic regression#As a two-way latent-variable model|two-way latent variable model]] described for binary logistic regression.  This formulation is common in the theory of [[discrete choice]] models, and makes it easier to compare multinomial logistic regression to the related [[multinomial probit]] model, as well as to extend it to more complex models.\n\nImagine that, for each data point ''i'' and possible outcome ''k=1,2,...,K'', there is a continuous [[latent variable]] ''Y''<sub>''i,k''</sub><sup>''*''</sup> (i.e. an unobserved [[random variable]]) that is distributed as follows:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\nY_{i,1}^{\\ast} &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i + \\varepsilon_1 \\, \\\\\nY_{i,2}^{\\ast} &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i + \\varepsilon_2 \\, \\\\\n\\cdots & \\\\\nY_{i,K}^{\\ast} &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_K \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i + \\varepsilon_K \\, \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\varepsilon_k \\sim \\operatorname{EV}_1(0,1),</math> i.e. a standard type-1 [[extreme value distribution]].\n\nThis latent variable can be thought of as the [[utility]] associated with data point ''i'' choosing outcome ''k'', where there is some randomness in the actual amount of utility obtained, which accounts for other unmodeled factors that go into the choice.  The value of the actual variable <math>Y_i</math> is then determined in a non-random fashion from these latent variables (i.e. the randomness has been moved from the observed outcomes into the latent variables), where outcome ''k'' is chosen if and only if the associated utility (the value of <math>Y_{i,k}^{\\ast}</math>) is greater than the utilities of all the other choices, i.e. if the utility associated with outcome ''k'' is the maximum of all the utilities. Since the latent variables are [[continuous variable|continuous]], the probability of two having exactly the same value is 0, so we ignore the scenario. That is:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i = 1) &= \\Pr(Y_{i,1}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,2}^{\\ast} \\text{ and } Y_{i,1}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,3}^{\\ast}\\text{ and } \\cdots \\text{ and } Y_{i,1}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,K}^{\\ast}) \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i = 2) &= \\Pr(Y_{i,2}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,1}^{\\ast} \\text{ and } Y_{i,2}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,3}^{\\ast}\\text{ and } \\cdots \\text{ and } Y_{i,2}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,K}^{\\ast}) \\\\\n\\cdots & \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i = K) &= \\Pr(Y_{i,K}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,1}^{\\ast} \\text{ and } Y_{i,K}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,2}^{\\ast}\\text{ and } \\cdots \\text{ and } Y_{i,K}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,K-1}^{\\ast}) \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nOr equivalently:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i = 1) &= \\Pr(\\max(Y_{i,1}^{\\ast},Y_{i,2}^{\\ast},\\ldots,Y_{i,K}^{\\ast})=Y_{i,1}^{\\ast}) \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i = 2) &= \\Pr(\\max(Y_{i,1}^{\\ast},Y_{i,2}^{\\ast},\\ldots,Y_{i,K}^{\\ast})=Y_{i,2}^{\\ast}) \\\\\n\\cdots & \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i = K) &= \\Pr(\\max(Y_{i,1}^{\\ast},Y_{i,2}^{\\ast},\\ldots,Y_{i,K}^{\\ast})=Y_{i,K}^{\\ast}) \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nLet's look more closely at the first equation, which we can write as follows:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i = 1) &= \\Pr(Y_{i,1}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,k}^{\\ast}\\ \\forall\\ k=2,\\ldots,K) \\\\\n&= \\Pr(Y_{i,1}^{\\ast} - Y_{i,k}^{\\ast} > 0\\ \\forall\\ k=2,\\ldots,K) \\\\\n&= \\Pr(\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i + \\varepsilon_1 - (\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i + \\varepsilon_k) > 0\\ \\forall\\ k=2,\\ldots,K) \\\\\n&= \\Pr((\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 - \\boldsymbol\\beta_k) \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i > \\varepsilon_k - \\varepsilon_1\\ \\forall\\ k=2,\\ldots,K)\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThere are a few things to realize here:\n#In general, if <math>X \\sim \\operatorname{EV}_1(a,b)</math> and <math>Y \\sim \\operatorname{EV}_1(a,b)</math> then <math>X - Y \\sim \\operatorname{Logistic}(0,b).</math> That is, the difference of two [[independent identically distributed]] extreme-value-distributed variables follows the [[logistic distribution]], where the first parameter is unimportant.  This is understandable since the first parameter is a [[location parameter]], i.e. it shifts the mean by a fixed amount, and if two values are both shifted by the same amount, their difference remains the same. This means that all of the relational statements underlying the probability of a given choice involve the logistic distribution, which makes the initial choice of the extreme-value distribution, which seemed rather arbitrary, somewhat more understandable.\n#The second parameter in an extreme-value or logistic distribution is a [[scale parameter]], such that if <math>X \\sim \\operatorname{Logistic}(0,1)</math> then <math>bX \\sim \\operatorname{Logistic}(0,b).</math> This means that the effect of using an error variable with an arbitrary scale parameter in place of scale 1 can be compensated simply by multiplying all regression vectors by the same scale.  Together with the previous point, this shows that the use of a standard extreme-value distribution (location 0, scale 1) for the error variables entails no loss of generality over using an arbitrary extreme-value distribution.  In fact, the model is [[nonidentifiable]] (no single set of optimal coefficients) if the more general distribution is used.\n#Because only differences of vectors of regression coefficients are used, adding an arbitrary constant to all coefficient vectors has no effect on the model.  This means that, just as in the log-linear model, only ''K''-1 of the coefficient vectors are identifiable, and the last one can be set to an arbitrary value (e.g. 0).\n\nActually finding the values of the above probabilities is somewhat difficult, and is a problem of computing a particular [[order statistic]] (the first, i.e. maximum) of a set of values.  However, it can be shown that the resulting expressions are the same as in above formulations, i.e. the two are equivalent.\n\n==Estimation of intercept==\nWhen using multinomial logistic regression, one category of the dependent variable is chosen as the reference category. Separate [[odds ratio]]s are determined for all independent variables for each category of the dependent variable with the exception of the reference category, which is omitted from the analysis. The exponential beta coefficient represents the change in the odds of the dependent variable being in a particular category vis-a-vis the reference category,  associated with a one unit change of the corresponding independent variable.\n\n==Application in natural language processing==\nIn [[natural language processing]], multinomial LR classifiers are commonly used as an alternative to [[naive Bayes classifier]]s because they do not assume [[statistical independence]] of the random variables (commonly known as ''features'') that serve as predictors.  However, learning in such a model is slower than for a naive Bayes classifier, and thus may not be appropriate given a very large number of classes to learn. In particular, learning in a Naive Bayes classifier is a simple matter of counting up the number of co-occurrences of features and classes, while in a maximum entropy classifier the weights, which are typically maximized using [[maximum a posteriori]] (MAP) estimation, must be learned using an iterative procedure; see [[#Estimating the coefficients]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Logistic regression]]\n* [[Multinomial probit]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Logistic regression]]\n[[Category:Classification algorithms]]\n[[Category:Regression models]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Multinomial regression|the related Probit procedure|Multinomial probit}}\n{{Refimprove|date=November 2011}}\n{{Regression bar}}\n\nIn [[statistics]], '''multinomial logistic regression''' is a [[statistical classification|classification]] method that generalizes [[logistic regression]] to [[multiclass classification|multiclass problems]], i.e. with more than two possible discrete outcomes.<ref>{{cite book |last=Greene |first=William H. |authorlink=William Greene (economist) |title=Econometric Analysis |edition=Seventh |location=Boston |publisher=Pearson Education |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-273-75356-8 |pages=803\u2013806 }}</ref>  That is, it is a model that is used to predict the probabilities of the different possible outcomes of a [[categorical distribution|categorically distributed]] [[dependent variable]], given a set of [[independent variable]]s (which may be real-valued, binary-valued, categorical-valued, etc.).\n\nMultinomial logistic regression is known by a variety of other names, including '''polytomous LR''',<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9574.1988.tb01238.x| title = Polytomous logistic regression| journal = Statistica Neerlandica| volume = 42| issue = 4| pages = 233\u2013252| year = 1988| last1 = Engel | first1 = J.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Applied Logistic Regression Analysis |first=Scott |last=Menard |publisher=SAGE |year=2002 |page=91}}</ref> '''multiclass LR''', '''[[Softmax activation function|softmax]] regression''', '''multinomial logit''' ('''mlogit'''), the '''maximum entropy''' ('''MaxEnt''') classifier, and the '''conditional maximum entropy model'''.<ref name=\"malouf\">{{cite conference |first=Robert |last=Malouf |year=2002 |url=http://aclweb.org/anthology/W/W02/W02-2018.pdf |title=A comparison of algorithms for maximum entropy parameter estimation |conference=Sixth Conf. on Natural Language Learning (CoNLL) |pages=49\u201355}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nMultinomial logistic regression is used when the [[dependent variable]] in question is [[Level of measurement#Nominal measurement|nominal]] (equivalently ''categorical'', meaning that it falls into any one of a set of categories that cannot be ordered in any meaningful way) and for which there are more than two categories.  Some examples would be:\n*Which major will a college student choose, given their grades, stated likes and dislikes, etc.?\n*Which blood type does a person have, given the results of various diagnostic tests?\n*In a hands-free mobile phone dialing application, which person's name was spoken, given various properties of the speech signal?\n*Which candidate will a person vote for, given particular demographic characteristics?\n*Which country will a firm locate an office in, given the characteristics of the firm and of the various candidate countries?\nThese are all [[statistical classification]] problems.  They all have in common a [[dependent variable]] to be predicted that comes from one of a limited set of items that cannot be meaningfully ordered, as well as a set of [[independent variable]]s (also known as features, explanators, etc.), which are used to predict the dependent variable.  Multinomial logistic regression is a particular solution to classification problems that use a linear combination of the observed features and some problem-specific parameters to estimate the probability of each particular value of the dependent variable.  The best values of the parameters for a given problem are usually determined from some training data (e.g. some people for whom both the diagnostic test results and blood types are known, or some examples of known words being spoken).\n\n==Assumptions==\nThe multinomial logistic model assumes that data are case specific; that is, each independent variable has a single value for each case. The multinomial logistic model also assumes that the dependent variable cannot be perfectly predicted from the independent variables for any case. As with other types of regression, there is no need for the independent variables to be [[statistically independent]] from each other (unlike, for example, in a [[naive Bayes classifier]]); however, [[multicollinearity|collinearity]] is assumed to be relatively low, as it becomes difficult to differentiate between the impact of several variables if this is not the case.<ref>{{cite book | last = Belsley | first = David | title = Conditioning diagnostics : collinearity and weak data in regression | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 1991 | isbn = 9780471528890 }}</ref>\n\nIf the multinomial logit is used to model choices, it relies on the assumption of [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]] (IIA), which is not always desirable. This assumption states that the odds of preferring one class over another do not depend on the presence or absence of other \"irrelevant\" alternatives. For example, the relative probabilities of taking a car or bus to work do not change if a bicycle is added as an additional possibility. This allows the choice of ''K'' alternatives to be modeled as a set of ''K''-1 independent binary choices, in which one alternative is chosen as a \"pivot\" and the other ''K''-1 compared against it, one at a time. The IIA hypothesis is a core hypothesis in rational choice theory; however numerous studies in psychology show that individuals often violate this assumption when making choices. An example of a problem case arises if choices include a car and a blue bus. Suppose the odds ratio between the two is 1 : 1. Now if the option of a red bus is introduced, a person may be indifferent between a red and a blue bus, and hence may exhibit a car : blue bus : red bus odds ratio of 1 : 0.5 : 0.5, thus maintaining a 1 : 1 ratio of car : any bus while adopting a changed car : blue bus ratio of 1 : 0.5. Here the red bus option was not in fact irrelevant, because a red bus was a [[perfect substitute]] for a blue bus.\n\nIf the multinomial logit is used to model choices, it may in some situations impose too much constraint on the relative preferences between the different alternatives. This point is especially important to take into account if the analysis aims to predict how choices would change if one alternative was to disappear (for instance if one political candidate withdraws from a three candidate race). Other models like the [[nested logit]] or the [[multinomial probit]] may be used in such cases as they allow for violation of the IIA.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Baltas |first=G. |last2=Doyle |first2=P. |year=2001 |title=Random Utility Models in Marketing Research: A Survey |journal=[[Journal of Business Research]] |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=115\u2013125 |doi=10.1016/S0148-2963(99)00058-2 }}</ref>\n\n==Model==\n{{See also|Logistic regression}}\n\n===Introduction===\nThere are multiple equivalent ways to describe the mathematical model underlying multinomial logistic regression.  This can make it difficult to compare different treatments of the subject in different texts.  The article on [[logistic regression]] presents a number of equivalent formulations of simple logistic regression, and many of these have analogues in the multinomial logit model.\n\nThe idea behind all of them, as in many other [[statistical classification]] techniques, is to construct a [[linear predictor function]] that constructs a score from a set of weights that are [[linear combination|linearly combined]] with the explanatory variables (features) of a given observation using a [[dot product]]:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{score}(\\mathbf{X}_i,k) = \\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i,</math>\n\nwhere '''X'''<sub>''i''</sub> is the vector of explanatory variables describing observation ''i'', '''\u03b2'''<sub>''k''</sub> is a vector of weights (or [[regression coefficient]]s) corresponding to outcome ''k'', and score('''X'''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''k'') is the score associated with assigning observation ''i'' to category ''k''.  In [[discrete choice]] theory, where observations represent people and outcomes represent choices, the score is considered the [[utility]] associated with person ''i'' choosing outcome ''k''.  The predicted outcome is the one with the highest score.\n\nThe difference between the multinomial logit model and numerous other methods, models, algorithms, etc. with the same basic setup (the [[perceptron]] algorithm, [[support vector machine]]s, [[linear discriminant analysis]], etc.) is the procedure for determining (training) the optimal weights/coefficients and the way that the score is interpreted.  In particular, in the multinomial logit model, the score can directly be converted to a probability value, indicating the [[probability]] of observation ''i'' choosing outcome ''k'' given the measured characteristics of the observation.  This provides a principled way of incorporating the prediction of a particular multinomial logit model into a larger procedure that may involve multiple such predictions, each with a possibility of error.  Without such means of combining predictions, errors tend to multiply.  For example, imagine a large [[predictive modelling|predictive model]] that is broken down into a series of submodels where the prediction of a given submodel is used as the input of another submodel, and that prediction is in turn used as the input into a third submodel, etc.  If each submodel has 90% accuracy in its predictions, and there are five submodels in series, then the overall model has only 0.9<sup>5</sup> = 59% accuracy.  If each submodel has 80% accuracy, then overall accuracy drops to 0.8<sup>5</sup> = 33% accuracy.  This issue is known as [[error propagation]] and is a serious problem in real-world predictive models, which are usually composed of numerous parts.  Predicting probabilities of each possible outcome, rather than simply making a single optimal prediction, is one means of alleviating this issue.{{Citation needed|reason=Source needed for how exactly the probability estimates of each outcome can help|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Setup===\nThe basic setup is the same as in [[logistic regression]], the only difference being that the [[dependent variable]]s are [[categorical variable|categorical]] rather than [[binary variable|binary]], i.e. there are ''K'' possible outcomes rather than just two.  The following description is somewhat shortened; for more details, consult the [[logistic regression]] article.\n\n====Data points====\nSpecifically, it is assumed that we have a series of ''N'' observed data points.  Each data point ''i'' (ranging from ''1'' to ''N'') consists of a set of ''M'' explanatory variables ''x''<sub>''1,i''</sub> ... ''x''<sub>''M,i''</sub> (aka [[independent variable]]s, predictor variables, features, etc.), and an associated [[categorical variable|categorical]] outcome ''Y''<sub>''i''</sub> (aka [[dependent variable]], response variable), which can take on one of ''K'' possible values.  These possible values represent logically separate categories (e.g. different political parties, blood types, etc.), and are often described mathematically by arbitrarily assigning each a number from 1 to ''K''.  The explanatory variables and outcome represent observed properties of the data points, and are often thought of as originating in the observations of ''N'' \"experiments\" \u2014 although an \"experiment\" may consist in nothing more than gathering data.  The goal of multinomial logistic regression is to construct a model that explains the relationship between the explanatory variables and the outcome, so that the outcome of a new \"experiment\" can be correctly predicted for a new data point for which the explanatory variables, but not the outcome, are available.  In the process, the model attempts to explain the relative effect of differing explanatory variables on the outcome.\n\nSome examples:\n*The observed outcomes are different variants of a disease such as [[hepatitis]] (possibly including \"no disease\" and/or other related diseases) in a set of patients, and the explanatory variables might be characteristics of the patients thought to be pertinent (sex, race, age, [[blood pressure]], outcomes of various liver-function tests, etc.).  The goal is then to predict which disease is causing the observed liver-related symptoms in a new patient.\n*The observed outcomes are the party chosen by a set of people in an election, and the explanatory variables are the demographic characteristics of each person (e.g. sex, race, age, income, etc.).  The goal is then to predict the likely vote of a new voter with given characteristics.\n\n====Linear predictor====\nAs in other forms of linear regression, multinomial logistic regression uses a [[linear predictor function]] <math>f(k,i)</math> to predict the probability that observation ''i'' has outcome ''k'', of the following form:\n\n:<math>f(k,i) = \\beta_{0,k} + \\beta_{1,k} x_{1,i}  + \\beta_{2,k} x_{2,i} + \\cdots + \\beta_{M,k} x_{M,i},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\beta_{m,k}</math> is a [[regression coefficient]] associated with the ''m''th explanatory variable and the ''k''th outcome.  As explained in the [[logistic regression]] article, the regression coefficients and explanatory variables are normally grouped into vectors of size ''M+1'', so that the predictor function can be written more compactly:\n\n:<math>f(k,i) = \\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{x}_i,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\boldsymbol\\beta_k</math> is the set of regression coefficients associated with outcome ''k'', and <math>\\mathbf{x}_i</math> (a row vector) is the set of explanatory variables associated with observation ''i''.\n\n===As a set of independent binary regressions===\nTo arrive at the multinomial logit model, one can imagine, for ''K'' possible outcomes, running ''K''-1 independent binary logistic regression models, in which one outcome is chosen as a \"pivot\" and then the other ''K''-1 outcomes are separately regressed against the pivot outcome.  This would proceed as follows, if outcome ''K'' (the last outcome) is chosen as the pivot:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\ln \\frac{\\Pr(Y_i=1)}{\\Pr(Y_i=K)} &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i \\\\\n\\ln \\frac{\\Pr(Y_i=2)}{\\Pr(Y_i=K)} &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i \\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n\\ln \\frac{\\Pr(Y_i=K-1)}{\\Pr(Y_i=K)} &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_{K-1} \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nNote that we have introduced separate sets of regression coefficients, one for each possible outcome.\n\nIf we exponentiate both sides, and solve for the probabilities, we get:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i=1) &= {\\Pr(Y_i=K)}e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=2) &= {\\Pr(Y_i=K)}e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=K-1) &= {\\Pr(Y_i=K)}e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_{K-1} \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nUsing the fact that all ''K'' of the probabilities must sum to one, we find:\n\n:<math>\\Pr(Y_i=K) = 1- \\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} \\Pr (Y_i = k) = 1 - \\sum_{k=1}^{K-1}{\\Pr(Y_i=K)}e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\Rightarrow \\Pr(Y_i=K) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}</math>\n\nWe can use this to find the other probabilities:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i=1) &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=2) &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=K-1) &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_{K-1} \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe fact that we run multiple regressions reveals why the model relies on the assumption of [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]] described above.\n\n===Estimating the coefficients===\n\nThe unknown parameters in each vector ''\u03b2<sub>k</sub>'' are typically jointly estimated by [[maximum a posteriori]] (MAP) estimation, which is an extension of [[maximum likelihood]] using [[regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] of the weights to prevent pathological solutions (usually a squared regularizing function, which is equivalent to placing a zero-mean [[Gaussian distribution|Gaussian]] [[prior distribution]] on the weights, but other distributions are also possible).  The solution is typically found using an iterative procedure such as [[generalized iterative scaling]],<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Generalized iterative scaling for log-linear models |author1=Darroch, J.N.  |author2=Ratcliff, D.  |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=The Annals of Mathematical Statistics |volume=43 |issue=5 |pages=1470\u20131480 |year=1972 |url=http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.aoms/1177692379 |doi=10.1214/aoms/1177692379}}</ref> [[iteratively reweighted least squares]] (IRLS),<ref>{{cite book |first=Christopher M. |last=Bishop |year=2006 |title=Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning |publisher=Springer |pages=206\u2013209}}</ref> by means of [[gradient-based optimization]] algorithms such as [[L-BFGS]],<ref name=\"malouf\"/> or by specialized [[coordinate descent]] algorithms.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Hsiang-Fu |last1=Yu |first2=Fang-Lan |last2=Huang |first3=Chih-Jen |last3=Lin |year=2011 |title=Dual coordinate descent methods for logistic regression and maximum entropy models |journal=Machine Learning |volume=85 |issue=1\u20132 |pages=41\u201375 |url=http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/maxent_dual.pdf |doi=10.1007/s10994-010-5221-8}}</ref>\n\n===As a log-linear model===\n\nThe formulation of binary logistic regression as a [[Logistic regression#log-linear model|log-linear model]] can be directly extended to multi-way regression.  That is, we model the [[logarithm]] of the probability of seeing a given output using the linear predictor as well as an additional [[normalization factor]], the logarithm of the [[partition function (mathematics)|partition function]]:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\ln \\Pr(Y_i=1) &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i - \\ln Z \\, \\\\\n\\ln \\Pr(Y_i=2) &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i - \\ln Z \\, \\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n\\ln \\Pr(Y_i=K) &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_K \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i - \\ln Z \\, \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nAs in the binary case, we need an extra term <math>- \\ln Z</math> to ensure that the whole set of probabilities forms a [[probability distribution]], i.e. so that they all sum to one:\n\n:<math>\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\Pr(Y_i=k) = 1</math>\n\nThe reason why we need to add a term to ensure normalization, rather than multiply as is usual, is because we have taken the logarithm of the probabilities.  Exponentiating both sides turns the additive term into a multiplicative factor, so that the probability is just the [[Gibbs measure]]:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i=1) &= \\frac{1}{Z} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\, \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=2) &= \\frac{1}{Z} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\, \\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=K) &= \\frac{1}{Z} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_K \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\, \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe quantity ''Z'' is called the [[partition function (mathematics)|partition function]] for the distribution. We can compute the value of the partition function by applying the above constraint that requires all probabilities to sum to 1:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n1 = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\Pr(Y_i=k) &= \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\frac{1}{Z} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\\\\n &= \\frac{1}{Z} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nTherefore:\n\n:<math>Z = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}</math>\n\nNote that this factor is \"constant\" in the sense that it is not a function of ''Y''<sub>''i''</sub>, which is the variable over which the probability distribution is defined.  However, it is definitely not constant with respect to the explanatory variables, or crucially, with respect to the unknown regression coefficients '''''\u03b2'''''<sub>''k''</sub>, which we will need to determine through some sort of [[mathematical optimization|optimization]] procedure.\n\nThe resulting equations for the probabilities are\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i=1) &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\, \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=2) &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\, \\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=K) &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_K \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k\n\\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\, \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nOr generally:\n\n:<math>\\Pr(Y_i=c) = \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_c \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}</math>\n\nThe following function:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{softmax}(k,x_1,\\ldots,x_n) = \\frac{e^{x_k}}{\\sum_{i=1}^n e^{x_i}}</math>\n\nis referred to as the [[softmax function]].  The reason is that the effect of exponentiating the values <math>x_1,\\ldots,x_n</math> is to exaggerate the differences between them.  As a result, <math>\\operatorname{softmax}(k,x_1,\\ldots,x_n)</math> will return a value close to 0 whenever ''<math>x_k</math>'' is significantly less than the maximum of all the values, and will return a value close to 1 when applied to the maximum value, unless it is extremely close to the next-largest value.  Thus, the softmax function can be used to construct a [[weighted average]] that behaves as a [[smooth function]] (which can be conveniently [[differentiation (mathematics)|differentiated]], etc.) and which approximates the [[indicator function]]\n\n:<math>f(k) = \\begin{cases}\n               1 \\; \\textrm{ if } \\; k = \\operatorname{\\arg\\max}(x_1, \\ldots, x_n), \\\\\n               0 \\; \\textrm{ otherwise}.\n              \\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nThus, we can write the probability equations as\n\n:<math>\\Pr(Y_i=c) = \\operatorname{softmax}(c, \\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol\\beta_K \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i)</math>\n\nThe softmax function thus serves as the equivalent of the [[logistic function]] in binary logistic regression.\n\nNote that not all of the <math>\\beta_k</math> vectors of coefficients are uniquely [[identifiability|identifiable]].  This is due to the fact that all probabilities must sum to 1, making one of them completely determined once all the rest are known.  As a result, there are only <math>k-1</math> separately specifiable probabilities, and hence <math>k-1</math> separately identifiable vectors of coefficients.  One way to see this is to note that if we add a constant vector to all of the coefficient vectors, the equations are identical:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{e^{(\\boldsymbol\\beta_c + C) \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{(\\boldsymbol\\beta_k + C) \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_c \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} e^{C \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} e^{C \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{C \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_c \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{e^{C \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_c \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{K} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nAs a result, it is conventional to set <math>C = -\\boldsymbol\\beta_K</math> (or alternatively, one of the other coefficient vectors).  Essentially, we set the constant so that one of the vectors becomes 0, and all of the other vectors get transformed into the difference between those vectors and the vector we chose.  This is equivalent to \"pivoting\" around one of the ''K'' choices, and examining how much better or worse all of the other ''K''-1 choices are, relative to the choice we are pivoting around.  Mathematically, we transform the coefficients as follows:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\boldsymbol\\beta'_1 &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_1 - \\boldsymbol\\beta_K \\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n\\boldsymbol\\beta'_{K-1} &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_{K-1} - \\boldsymbol\\beta_K \\\\\n\\boldsymbol\\beta'_K &= 0\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThis leads to the following equations:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i=1) &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta'_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta'_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\, \\\\\n\\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=K-1) &= \\frac{e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta'_{K-1} \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}}{1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta'_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\, \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i=K) &= \\frac{1}{1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{K-1} e^{\\boldsymbol\\beta'_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i}} \\, \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nOther than the prime symbols on the regression coefficients, this is exactly the same as the form of the model described above, in terms of ''K''-1 independent two-way regressions.\n\n===As a latent-variable model===\n\nIt is also possible to formulate multinomial logistic regression as a latent variable model, following the [[Logistic regression#As a two-way latent-variable model|two-way latent variable model]] described for binary logistic regression.  This formulation is common in the theory of [[discrete choice]] models, and makes it easier to compare multinomial logistic regression to the related [[multinomial probit]] model, as well as to extend it to more complex models.\n\nImagine that, for each data point ''i'' and possible outcome ''k=1,2,...,K'', there is a continuous [[latent variable]] ''Y''<sub>''i,k''</sub><sup>''*''</sup> (i.e. an unobserved [[random variable]]) that is distributed as follows:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\nY_{i,1}^{\\ast} &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i + \\varepsilon_1 \\, \\\\\nY_{i,2}^{\\ast} &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i + \\varepsilon_2 \\, \\\\\n\\cdots & \\\\\nY_{i,K}^{\\ast} &= \\boldsymbol\\beta_K \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i + \\varepsilon_K \\, \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\varepsilon_k \\sim \\operatorname{EV}_1(0,1),</math> i.e. a standard type-1 [[extreme value distribution]].\n\nThis latent variable can be thought of as the [[utility]] associated with data point ''i'' choosing outcome ''k'', where there is some randomness in the actual amount of utility obtained, which accounts for other unmodeled factors that go into the choice.  The value of the actual variable <math>Y_i</math> is then determined in a non-random fashion from these latent variables (i.e. the randomness has been moved from the observed outcomes into the latent variables), where outcome ''k'' is chosen if and only if the associated utility (the value of <math>Y_{i,k}^{\\ast}</math>) is greater than the utilities of all the other choices, i.e. if the utility associated with outcome ''k'' is the maximum of all the utilities. Since the latent variables are [[continuous variable|continuous]], the probability of two having exactly the same value is 0, so we ignore the scenario. That is:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i = 1) &= \\Pr(Y_{i,1}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,2}^{\\ast} \\text{ and } Y_{i,1}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,3}^{\\ast}\\text{ and } \\cdots \\text{ and } Y_{i,1}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,K}^{\\ast}) \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i = 2) &= \\Pr(Y_{i,2}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,1}^{\\ast} \\text{ and } Y_{i,2}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,3}^{\\ast}\\text{ and } \\cdots \\text{ and } Y_{i,2}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,K}^{\\ast}) \\\\\n\\cdots & \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i = K) &= \\Pr(Y_{i,K}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,1}^{\\ast} \\text{ and } Y_{i,K}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,2}^{\\ast}\\text{ and } \\cdots \\text{ and } Y_{i,K}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,K-1}^{\\ast}) \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nOr equivalently:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i = 1) &= \\Pr(\\max(Y_{i,1}^{\\ast},Y_{i,2}^{\\ast},\\ldots,Y_{i,K}^{\\ast})=Y_{i,1}^{\\ast}) \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i = 2) &= \\Pr(\\max(Y_{i,1}^{\\ast},Y_{i,2}^{\\ast},\\ldots,Y_{i,K}^{\\ast})=Y_{i,2}^{\\ast}) \\\\\n\\cdots & \\\\\n\\Pr(Y_i = K) &= \\Pr(\\max(Y_{i,1}^{\\ast},Y_{i,2}^{\\ast},\\ldots,Y_{i,K}^{\\ast})=Y_{i,K}^{\\ast}) \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nLet's look more closely at the first equation, which we can write as follows:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Pr(Y_i = 1) &= \\Pr(Y_{i,1}^{\\ast} > Y_{i,k}^{\\ast}\\ \\forall\\ k=2,\\ldots,K) \\\\\n&= \\Pr(Y_{i,1}^{\\ast} - Y_{i,k}^{\\ast} > 0\\ \\forall\\ k=2,\\ldots,K) \\\\\n&= \\Pr(\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i + \\varepsilon_1 - (\\boldsymbol\\beta_k \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i + \\varepsilon_k) > 0\\ \\forall\\ k=2,\\ldots,K) \\\\\n&= \\Pr((\\boldsymbol\\beta_1 - \\boldsymbol\\beta_k) \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i > \\varepsilon_k - \\varepsilon_1\\ \\forall\\ k=2,\\ldots,K)\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThere are a few things to realize here:\n#In general, if <math>X \\sim \\operatorname{EV}_1(a,b)</math> and <math>Y \\sim \\operatorname{EV}_1(a,b)</math> then <math>X - Y \\sim \\operatorname{Logistic}(0,b).</math> That is, the difference of two [[independent identically distributed]] extreme-value-distributed variables follows the [[logistic distribution]], where the first parameter is unimportant.  This is understandable since the first parameter is a [[location parameter]], i.e. it shifts the mean by a fixed amount, and if two values are both shifted by the same amount, their difference remains the same. This means that all of the relational statements underlying the probability of a given choice involve the logistic distribution, which makes the initial choice of the extreme-value distribution, which seemed rather arbitrary, somewhat more understandable.\n#The second parameter in an extreme-value or logistic distribution is a [[scale parameter]], such that if <math>X \\sim \\operatorname{Logistic}(0,1)</math> then <math>bX \\sim \\operatorname{Logistic}(0,b).</math> This means that the effect of using an error variable with an arbitrary scale parameter in place of scale 1 can be compensated simply by multiplying all regression vectors by the same scale.  Together with the previous point, this shows that the use of a standard extreme-value distribution (location 0, scale 1) for the error variables entails no loss of generality over using an arbitrary extreme-value distribution.  In fact, the model is [[nonidentifiable]] (no single set of optimal coefficients) if the more general distribution is used.\n#Because only differences of vectors of regression coefficients are used, adding an arbitrary constant to all coefficient vectors has no effect on the model.  This means that, just as in the log-linear model, only ''K''-1 of the coefficient vectors are identifiable, and the last one can be set to an arbitrary value (e.g. 0).\n\nActually finding the values of the above probabilities is somewhat difficult, and is a problem of computing a particular [[order statistic]] (the first, i.e. maximum) of a set of values.  However, it can be shown that the resulting expressions are the same as in above formulations, i.e. the two are equivalent.\n\n==Estimation of intercept==\nWhen using multinomial logistic regression, one category of the dependent variable is chosen as the reference category. Separate [[odds ratio]]s are determined for all independent variables for each category of the dependent variable with the exception of the reference category, which is omitted from the analysis. The exponential beta coefficient represents the change in the odds of the dependent variable being in a particular category vis-a-vis the reference category,  associated with a one unit change of the corresponding independent variable.\n\n==Application in natural language processing==\nIn [[natural language processing]], multinomial LR classifiers are commonly used as an alternative to [[naive Bayes classifier]]s because they do not assume [[statistical independence]] of the random variables (commonly known as ''features'') that serve as predictors.  However, learning in such a model is slower than for a naive Bayes classifier, and thus may not be appropriate given a very large number of classes to learn. In particular, learning in a Naive Bayes classifier is a simple matter of counting up the number of co-occurrences of features and classes, while in a maximum entropy classifier the weights, which are typically maximized using [[maximum a posteriori]] (MAP) estimation, must be learned using an iterative procedure; see [[#Estimating the coefficients]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Logistic regression]]\n* [[Multinomial probit]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Logistic regression]]\n[[Category:Classification algorithms]]\n[[Category:Regression models]]\n", "name_user": "Gciriani", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAs a set of independent binary regressions:change spacing for readability", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logistic_regression"}

It is the most destructive hurricane to ever hit Florida in terms of structures damaged or destroyed, and was the costliest in financial terms until [[Hurricane Irma]] surpassed it [[2017 Atlantic hurricane season|25 years later]]. It was the strongest landfalling hurricane in decades and the [[List of costliest Atlantic hurricanes|costliest hurricane]] to make [[landfall]] anywhere in the [[United States]], until it was surpassed by [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] in [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005]]. In addition, Andrew is one of only four Category 5 hurricanes to make landfall in the United States, alongside the [[1935 Labor Day hurricane]], [[Hurricane Camille]] in [[1969 Atlantic hurricane season|1969]], and [[Hurricane Michael]] in [[2018 Atlantic hurricane season|2018]]. Andrew caused major damage in the [[Bahamas]] and [[Louisiana]], but the greatest impact was felt in [[South Florida]], where the storm made landfall as a Category 5 hurricane, with 1-minute sustained wind speeds as high as 165&nbsp;mph (266&nbsp;km/h). Passing directly through the city of [[Homestead, Florida|Homestead]] in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]] (now known as Miami-Dade County), Andrew stripped many homes of all but their concrete foundations. In total, Andrew destroyed more than 63,500 houses, damaged more than 124,000 others, caused $27.3 billion in damage,{{#tag:ref|All damage figures are in 1992 [[United States dollar|USD]], unless otherwise noted|group=\"nb\"}} and left 65 people dead.\n\nAndrew began as a [[Tropical cyclone#Tropical depression|tropical depression]] over the eastern Atlantic Ocean on August 16. After spending a week without significantly strengthening itself in the central Atlantic, it [[rapid deepening|rapidly intensified]] into a powerful Category 5 hurricane while moving westward towards the Bahamas on August 23. Though it briefly weakened to Category 4 status while traversing the Bahamas, it regained Category 5 intensity before making landfall in Florida on [[Elliott Key]] and then [[Homestead, Florida|Homestead]] on August 24. With a barometric pressure of 922 [[bar (unit)|mbar]] (27.23 [[inches of mercury|inHg]]) at the time of landfall in Florida, Andrew is the sixth most-intense hurricane to strike the United States. Several hours later, the hurricane emerged over the [[Gulf of Mexico]] at Category 4 strength, with the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]] in its dangerous path. After turning northwestward and weakening further, Andrew moved ashore near [[Morgan City, Louisiana]], as a low-end Category 3 storm. After moving inland, the small hurricane curved northeastward and rapidly lost its intensity, merging with a [[weather front|frontal system]] over the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] on August 29.\n\nAndrew first inflicted structural damage as it moved through the Bahamas, especially in [[Cat Cays]], lashing the islands with [[storm surge]], [[hurricane-force winds]], and [[tornado]]es. About 800 houses were destroyed in the archipelago, and there was substantial damage to the transport, water, sanitation, agriculture, and fishing sectors. Andrew left four dead and $250 million in damage throughout the Bahamas. In parts of southern Florida, Andrew produced severe winds; a wind gust of 177&nbsp;mph (282&nbsp;km/h) was observed at a house in [[Perrine, Florida|Perrine]]. The cities of [[Florida City, Florida|Florida City]], [[Homestead, Florida|Homestead]], [[Cutler Ridge, Florida|Cutler Ridge]] and parts of [[Kendall, Florida|Kendall]] received the brunt of the storm. As many as 1.4 million people lost power at the height of the storm; some for more than one month. In the [[Everglades]], 70,000 acres (280&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of trees were downed, while invasive [[Burmese python]]s began [[Burmese pythons in Florida|inhabiting the region]] after a nearby facility housing them was destroyed. Rainfall in Florida was substantial, peaking at 13.98 inches (355&nbsp;mm) in western Dade County. In Florida, Andrew killed 44 and left a record $25 billion in damage.\n\nPrior to making landfall in Louisiana on August 26, Andrew caused extensive damage to [[Offshore oil and gas in the Gulf of Mexico (United States)|oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico]], leading to $500&nbsp;million in losses for oil companies. It produced hurricane-force winds along its path through Louisiana, damaging large stretches of power lines that left about 230,000 people without electricity. Over 80% of trees in the [[Atchafalaya River]] basin were downed, and the agriculture there was devastated. Throughout the basin and [[Bayou Lafourche]], 187 million freshwater fish were killed in the hurricane. With 23,000 houses damaged, 985 others destroyed, and 1,951 mobile homes demolished, property losses in Louisiana exceeded $1.5 billion. The hurricane caused the deaths of 17&nbsp;people in the state, 6 of whom drowned offshore. Andrew spawned at least 28 tornadoes along the Gulf Coast, especially in [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Mississippi]]. In total, Andrew left 65 dead and caused $27.3&nbsp;billion in damage. It is currently the seventh-costliest Atlantic hurricane to hit the United States, behind only [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] (2005), [[Hurricane Ike|Ike]] (2008), [[Hurricane Sandy|Sandy]] (2012), [[Hurricane Harvey|Harvey]] (2017), [[Hurricane Irma|Irma]] (2017), and [[Hurricane Maria|Maria]] (2017), as well as the eighth-costliest Atlantic hurricane, behind the aforementioned systems and [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]] (2005). It is the third-strongest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland by wind speed (165&nbsp;mph).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/by-the-numbers-michael-ranked-as-3rd-most-intense-hurricane-to-hit-continental-us/70006313|title=By the numbers: Michael ranked as 3rd-most intense hurricane to hit continental US|website=www.accuweather.com|access-date=October 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{main|Meteorological history of Hurricane Andrew}}\n{{Storm path|alt=The path of Hurricane Andrew, which starts in the open Atlantic Ocean and tracks northwestward.

In total, Andrew destroyed more than 63,500 houses, damaged more than 124,000 others, caused $27.3 billion in damage,{{#tag:ref|All damage figures are in 1992 [[United States dollar|USD]], unless otherwise noted|group=\"nb\"}} and left 65 people dead.\n\nAndrew began as a [[Tropical cyclone#Tropical depression|tropical depression]] over the eastern Atlantic Ocean on August 16. After spending a week without significantly strengthening itself in the central Atlantic, it [[rapid deepening|rapidly intensified]] into a powerful Category 5 hurricane while moving westward towards the Bahamas on August 23. Though it briefly weakened to Category 4 status while traversing the Bahamas, it regained Category 5 intensity before making landfall in Florida on [[Elliott Key]] and then [[Homestead, Florida|Homestead]] on August 24. With a barometric pressure of 922 [[bar (unit)|mbar]] (27.23 [[inches of mercury|inHg]]) at the time of landfall in Florida, Andrew is the sixth most-intense hurricane to strike the United States. Several hours later, the hurricane emerged over the [[Gulf of Mexico]] at Category 4 strength, with the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]] in its dangerous path. After turning northwestward and weakening further, Andrew moved ashore near [[Morgan City, Louisiana]], as a low-end Category 3 storm. After moving inland, the small hurricane curved northeastward and rapidly lost its intensity, merging with a [[weather front|frontal system]] over the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] on August 29.\n\nAndrew first inflicted structural damage as it moved through the Bahamas, especially in [[Cat Cays]], lashing the islands with [[storm surge]], [[hurricane-force winds]], and [[tornado]]es. About 800 houses were destroyed in the archipelago, and there was substantial damage to the transport, water, sanitation, agriculture, and fishing sectors. Andrew left four dead and $250 million in damage throughout the Bahamas. In parts of southern Florida, Andrew produced severe winds; a wind gust of 177&nbsp;mph (282&nbsp;km/h) was observed at a house in [[Perrine, Florida|Perrine]]. The cities of [[Florida City, Florida|Florida City]], [[Homestead, Florida|Homestead]], [[Cutler Ridge, Florida|Cutler Ridge]] and parts of Kendall received the brunt of the storm. As many as 1.4 million people lost power at the height of the storm; some for more than one month. In the [[Everglades]], 70,000 acres (280&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of trees were downed, while invasive [[Burmese python]]s began [[Burmese pythons in Florida|inhabiting the region]] after a nearby facility housing them was destroyed. Rainfall in Florida was substantial, peaking at 13.98 inches (355&nbsp;mm) in western Dade County. In Florida, Andrew killed 44 and left a record $25 billion in damage.\n\nPrior to making landfall in Louisiana on August 26, Andrew caused extensive damage to [[Offshore oil and gas in the Gulf of Mexico (United States)|oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico]], leading to $500&nbsp;million in losses for oil companies. It produced hurricane-force winds along its path through Louisiana, damaging large stretches of power lines that left about 230,000 people without electricity. Over 80% of trees in the [[Atchafalaya River]] basin were downed, and the agriculture there was devastated. Throughout the basin and [[Bayou Lafourche]], 187 million freshwater fish were killed in the hurricane. With 23,000 houses damaged, 985 others destroyed, and 1,951 mobile homes demolished, property losses in Louisiana exceeded $1.5 billion. The hurricane caused the deaths of 17&nbsp;people in the state, 6 of whom drowned offshore. Andrew spawned at least 28 tornadoes along the Gulf Coast, especially in [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Mississippi]]. In total, Andrew left 65 dead and caused $27.3&nbsp;billion in damage. It is currently the seventh-costliest Atlantic hurricane to hit the United States, behind only [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] (2005), [[Hurricane Ike|Ike]] (2008), [[Hurricane Sandy|Sandy]] (2012), [[Hurricane Harvey|Harvey]] (2017), [[Hurricane Irma|Irma]] (2017), and [[Hurricane Maria|Maria]] (2017), as well as the eighth-costliest Atlantic hurricane, behind the aforementioned systems and [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]] (2005). It is the third-strongest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland by wind speed (165&nbsp;mph).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/by-the-numbers-michael-ranked-as-3rd-most-intense-hurricane-to-hit-continental-us/70006313|title=By the numbers: Michael ranked as 3rd-most intense hurricane to hit continental US|website=www.accuweather.com|access-date=October 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{main|Meteorological history of Hurricane Andrew}}\n{{Storm path|alt=The path of Hurricane Andrew, which starts in the open Atlantic Ocean and tracks northwestward.

Although privately developed at first, the City of Charleston floated bonds in 1931 to acquire a portion of the site for passenger service. Within ten years, three runways were paved and outfitted with lighting for nighttime operations. In [[World War II]], control of the airfield passed to the [[United States Army]] though civilian service was allowed to continue to use the airfield. After the war, the airfield reverted to civilian use for a short time. In 1949, a new passenger terminal was built.\n\nDuring the [[Korean War]], the airfield was reactivated for military use and in 1952, the City of Charleston and the [[United States Air Force]] reached an agreement on control of the base and the runways\u2014an arrangement that has been renegotiated over time and that continues to this day. In 1979, the civilian portions of the airport were transferred from the City of Charleston to the Charleston County Aviation Authority, which had operated two other airports in the area. The current terminal on the south end of the airport was built in the 1980s on land acquired by [[Georgia Pacific]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chs-airport.com/About-the-CCAA/Airport-History.aspx |title=Airport History |publisher=Chs Airport |date=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Charleston-Field-AFB-8594.jpg|thumb|right|View of [[Charleston Field]], a U.S. Air Force base]]\n\nIn October 2009, [[Boeing]] announced that it would build a major plant on 265 acres at the airport as a second final assembly site for its [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787 Dreamliner]] commercial aircraft. The facility began limited operations in July 2011 and rolled out its first completed aircraft in April 2012. Additional facilities to complement aircraft assembly have since been announced by the company.<ref name=\"boeing.com\"/>\n\nThroughout its history, all three domestic legacy carriers ([[American Airlines]], [[Delta Air Lines]], and [[United Airlines]]) and their predecessor companies or affiliates have served Charleston International Airport. Aside from the legacy carriers, Charleston has seen periods of additional air service from other carriers, but prior to 2010, those services were short-lived. The airport has had brief periods of international service. In 2001, [[Air Canada]] briefly served the airport from [[Toronto]] but ended service immediately after the [[September 11th attacks]].

Although privately developed at first, the City of Charleston floated bonds in 1931 to acquire a portion of the site for passenger service. Within ten years, three runways were paved and outfitted with lighting for nighttime operations. In [[World War II]], control of the airfield passed to the [[United States Army]] though civilian service was allowed to continue to use the airfield. After the war, the airfield reverted to civilian use for a short time. In 1949, a new passenger terminal was built.\n\nDuring the [[Korean War]], the airfield was reactivated for military use and in 1952, the City of Charleston and the [[United States Air Force]] reached an agreement on control of the base and the runways\u2014an arrangement that has been renegotiated over time and that continues to this day. In 1979, the civilian portions of the airport were transferred from the City of Charleston to the Charleston County Aviation Authority, which had operated two other airports in the area. The current terminal on the south end of the airport was built in the 1980s on land acquired by [[Georgia Pacific]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chs-airport.com/About-the-CCAA/Airport-History.aspx |title=Airport History |publisher=Chs Airport |date=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Charleston-Field-AFB-8594.jpg|thumb|right|View of [[Charleston Field]], a U.S. Air Force base]]\n\nIn October 2009, [[Boeing]] announced that it would build a major plant on 265 acres at the airport as a second final assembly site for its [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787 Dreamliner]] commercial aircraft. The facility began limited operations in July 2011 and rolled out its first completed aircraft in April 2012. Additional facilities to complement aircraft assembly have since been announced by the company.<ref name=\"boeing.com\"/>\n\nThroughout its history, all three domestic legacy carriers ([[American Airlines]], [[Delta Air Lines]], and [[United Airlines]]) and their predecessor companies or affiliates have served Charleston International Airport. Aside from the legacy carriers, Charleston has seen periods of additional air service from other carriers, but prior to 2010, those services were short-lived. The airport has had brief periods of international service. In 2001, [[Air Canada]] briefly served the airport from [[Toronto]] but ended service immediately after the [[September 11th attacks]]. [[Porter Airlines]] briefly served Charleston with flights to Toronto in 2015.\n\nSince 2010, the airport's passenger figures have doubled.<ref name=\"Charleston Post & Courier\">{{cite web |url= https://www.postandcourier.com/business/charleston-airport-saw-nearly-additional-passengers-in/article_41077776-2587-11e9-96a7-a3bc1c305600.html|title= Charleston Airport saw nearly 500,000 additional passengers in 2018|accessdate=March 9, 2019|publisher= [[Post & Courier]]|date= January 31, 2019}}</ref> New services established by additional airlines during this time along with increased services from the three legacy carriers have contributed to this growth.

About 30 to 35 percent of the casein (equivalent to two teaspoons per quart of milk) is beta-casein, of which there are several varieties, determined by the genes of the cow. The most common of these variants are A1 and A2 proteins (named for the order in which they were identified by scientists). The sole difference is that one of the 209 amino acids that make up the beta-casein proteins, a [[proline]], occurs at position 67 in the [[Peptide sequence|chain of amino acids]] that make up the A2 beta-casein, while in A1 beta-casein, a [[histidine]] occurs at that position.  Studies in cells found that [[digestive enzymes]] that cut up proteins interact with beta-casein precisely at that location, so that A1 and A2 beta-casein proteins are processed differently.

About 30 to 35 percent of the casein (equivalent to two teaspoons per quart of milk) is beta-casein, of which there are several varieties, determined by the genes of the cow. The most common of these variants are A1 and A2 proteins (named for the order in which they were identified by scientists). The sole difference is that one of the 209 amino acids that make up the beta-casein proteins, a [[proline]], occurs at position 67 in the [[Peptide sequence|chain of amino acids]] that make up the A2 beta-casein, while in A1 beta-casein, a [[histidine]] occurs at that position.  Studies in cells found that [[digestive enzymes]] that cut up proteins interact with beta-casein precisely at that location, so that A1 and A2 beta-casein proteins are processed differently.  A seven-amino acid [[peptide]], beta-[[casomorphin]]-7, can be cut away from the A1-beta-casein protein by those enzymes, but the enzymes cannot cut the A2 protein at that location, so BCM-7 is not formed from A2 proteins.<ref name=\"truswell\"/> Studies in humans have not consistently found that BCM-7 is formed in the human digestive system.<ref name=Clemens>Clemens RA.
