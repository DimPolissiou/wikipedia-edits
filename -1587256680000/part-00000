The pulling process, which makes the candy lighter and chewier, consists of stretching out the mixture, folding it over and stretching it out again.

Fralinger's first major competition came from candy maker Enoch James, who refined the recipe, making it less sticky and easier to unwrap.

The poem shows Ercilla to be a master of the octava real (that is Italian [[ottava rima]]), the complicated stanza in which many other Renaissance epics in Castilian were written. A difficult eight-line unit of 11-syllable verses that are linked by a tight rhyme scheme abababcc, the octava real was a challenge few poets met. It had been adapted from Italian only in the 16th century, and it produces resonant, serious-sounding verse that is appropriate to epic themes.\n\n===Subject matter===\nThe work describes the initial phase of the [[Arauco War]] which evolved from the Spanish conquest attempt of southern Chile. The war would come to shape the economics, politics and social life of Chile for centuries. Ercilla placed the lesser conquests of the Spanish in [[Chile]] at the core of his poem, because the author was a participant in the conquest and the story is based on his experiences there.\n\n===Development===\nOn scraps of paper in the lulls of fighting, Ercilla jotted down versified octaves about the events of the war and his own part in it. These stanzas he later gathered together and augmented in number to form his epic. In the minds of the Chilean people ''La Araucana'' is a kind of [[Iliad]] that exalts the heroism, pride, and contempt of pain and death of the legendary Araucanian leaders and makes them national heroes today. Thus we see Ercilla appealing to the concept of the \"noble savage,\" which has its origins in classical authors and took on a new lease of life in the renaissance \u2013 c.f. [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]]'s essay \"Des Canibales\", and was destined to have wide literary currency in European literature two centuries later. He had, in fact, created a historical poem of the war in Chile which immediately inspired many imitations.\n\n===Influences===\n''La Araucana'' is deliberately literary and includes fantastical elements reminiscent of medieval stories of [[chivalry]]. The narrator is a participant in the story, at the time a new development for Spanish literature. Influences include ''[[Orlando furioso]]'' by [[Ludovico Ariosto]]. Also features extended description of the [[natural landscape]]. ''La Araucana''\u2019s successes\u2014and weaknesses\u2014as a poem stem from the uneasy coexistence of characters and situations drawn from Classical sources (primarily [[Virgil]] and [[Lucan]], both translated into Spanish in the 16th century) and Italian Renaissance poets ([[Ludovico Ariosto]] and [[Torquato Tasso]]) with material derived from the actions of contemporary Spaniards and Araucanians.\n\nThe mixture of Classical and Araucanian motifs in ''La Araucana'' often strikes the modern reader as unusual, but Ercilla's turning native peoples into ancient Greeks, Romans, or Carthaginians was a common practice of his time. For Ercilla, the Araucanians were noble and brave\u2014only lacking, as their Classical counterparts did, the Christian faith. [[Caupolic\u00e1n]], the Indian warrior and chieftain who is the protagonist of Ercilla's poem, has a panoply of Classical heroes behind him. His valour and nobility give ''La Araucana'' grandeur, as does the poem's exaltation of the vanquished: the defeated Araucanians are the champions in this poem, which was written by one of the victors, a Spaniard. Ercilla's depiction of Caupolic\u00e1n elevates ''La Araucana'' above the poem's structural defects and prosaic moments, which occur toward the end when Ercilla follows Tasso too closely and the narrative strays from the author's lived experience. Ercilla, the poet-soldier, eventually emerges as the true hero of his own poem, and he is the figure that gives the poem unity and strength.\n\nThe story is considered to be the first or one of the first works of literature in the New World (cf. [[Cabeza de Vaca]]'s ''[[Naufragios]]''&mdash;\"Shipwrecked\" or \"Castaways\") for its fantastical/religious elements, it is arguable whether that is a \"traveler's account\" or actual literature; and [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]]'s ''Historia verdadera de la conquista de Nueva Espa\u00f1a'' (''[[The Conquest of New Spain]]''). ''La Araucana''\u2019s more dramatic moments also became a source of plays. But the Renaissance epic is not a genre that has, as a whole, endured well, and today Ercilla is little known and ''La Araucana'' is rarely read except by specialists and students of Spanish and Latin American literatures, and of course in Chile, where it is subject of special attention in the elementary schools education both in language and history.\n\n''La Araucana'' makes Chile the only American country that was founded under the lights of an epic poem.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==The author==\n[[Alonso de Ercilla]] was born into a noble family in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].<ref>[http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/e/ercilla.htm Alonso de Ercilla, Biograf\u00edas y Vidas.]</ref> He occupied several positions in the household of Prince Philip (later King Philip II of Spain), before requesting and receiving appointment to a military expedition to Chile to subdue the [[Araucanians]] of Chile, he joined the adventurers. He distinguished himself in the ensuing campaign; but, having quarrelled with a comrade, he was condemned to death in 1558 by his general, [[Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza, 5th Marquis of Ca\u00f1ete|Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza]]. The sentence was commuted to imprisonment, but Ercilla was speedily released and fought at the [[Battle of Quipeo]] (14 December 1558).  He was then exiled to Peru and returned to Spain in 1562.\n\n==Reception==\nErcilla embodied the Renaissance ideal of being at once a man of action and a man of letters as no other in his time was. He was adept at blending personal, lived experience with literary tradition. He was widely acclaimed in Spain. There is an episode in [[Miguel de Cervantes]]\u2019s 17th-century novel ''[[Don Quixote]]'', when a priest and barber inspect Don Quixote's personal library, to burn the books responsible for driving him to madness. ''La Araucana'' is one of the works which the men spare from the flames, as \"one of the best examples of its genre\", entirely Christian and honorable, and is proclaimed to be among the best poems in the heroic style ever written, good enough to compete with those of Ariosto and Tasso.\n\n[[Voltaire]] was much more critical, describing the poem as rambling and directionless and calling the author more barbarous than the Indians whom it is about. He does, however, express admiration for the speech in Canto II, which he compares favorably to [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]]'s speech in the ''[[Iliad]]''.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070811112834/http://www.pehuen.cl/archivo/biblioteca/la-araucana.PDF Voltaire, en ''Essai Sur la Poesie Epique'', prefacio de la edici\u00f3n virtual de La Araucana, Pehuen Editores.] </ref>\n\n==Events==\nA revolt starts when the conqueror of Chile, [[Pedro de Valdivia]] is captured and killed by [[Mapuche]] (also known as Araucanian) Indians. Ercilla blames Valdivia for his own death, having mistreated the natives who had previously acquiesced to Spanish rule and provoking them into rebellion. However, having previously accepted the rule of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], the Araucanians were now in revolt against their legitimate sovereign lord. This is the ethical position of Ercilla: sympathy for the Indians' suffering, admiration for the courage of their resistance, criticism of Spanish cruelty, but loyalty to and acceptance of the legitimacy of the Spanish cause (the legitimate rule of a duly-constituted prince and the extension of Christianity). Although Ercilla's purpose was to glorify Spanish arms, the figures of Araucanian chiefs, the strong [[Caupolic\u00e1n]], the brilliant [[Lautaro (toqui)|Lautaro]], the old and wise [[Colocolo (tribal chief)|Colocolo]] and the proud [[Galvarino (Mapuche)|Galvarino]], have proved the most memorable.\n\nKey events include the capture and execution of Pedro de Valdivia; the death of the hero Lautaro in the [[Battle of Mataquito]], and the execution of Caupolic\u00e1n the [[Toqui]] for leading the revolt of the Araucanians (thanks to betrayal by one of their own); the encounter with a sorcerer who takes the narrator for a flight above the earth to see events happening in Europe and the Middle East; and the encounter with an Indian woman (Glaura) searching for her husband amongst the dead after a battlefield. This last is an indicator of the humanist side of Ercilla, and a human sympathy which he shows towards the indigenous people. The narrator claims that he attempted to have the life of the Indian chieftain spared.\n\nThe historicity of some events and characters have been put into question. Historian [[Diego Barros Arana]] has argued that the female character [[Janequeo (lonco)|Janequeo]] is an invention that passed down without scrutiny as historical in the chronicles of the [[Jesuit]]s [[Alonso de Ovalle]] and [[Diego de Rosales]].<ref>[[Diego Barros Arana]], Historia general de Chile.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Pedro de Valdivia]]\n* [[Francisco de Villagra]]\n* [[Jer\u00f3nimo de Alderete]]\n* [[Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza, 5th Marquis of Ca\u00f1ete|Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza]]\n* [[Arauco War]]\n* [[Mapuche|Mapuche people]]\n* [[Indian Lautaro|Lautaro]]\n* [[Caupolic\u00e1n]]\n* [[Colocolo (tribal chief)|Colocolo]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n==Sources==\n{{wikisource|La araucana|La Araucana}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{1911|wstitle=Ercilla y Z\u00faniga, Alonso de|volume=9|page=734}}\n*{{CathEncy|wstitle=Alonso de Ercilla y Z\u00fa\u00f1iga}}\n{{refend}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Araucana, La}}\n[[Category:Spanish literature]]\n[[Category:Epic poems in Spanish]]\n[[Category:Chilean literature]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Epic poem of the Spanish conquest of Chile}}\n{{more footnotes|date=February 2013}}\n{{Italic title}}\n[[File:La Araucana.jpg|thumb|200px|''La Araucana'', 1st part, [[editio princeps]], Madrid, 1569.]]\n'''''La Araucana''''' (also known in English as '''''The Araucaniad''''') is a 16th-century [[Epic poetry|epic poem]]<ref>[http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-3286.html Alonso de Ercilla y Z\u00fa\u00f1iga: La Araucana (in Spanish).]</ref> in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] about the Spanish [[Conquest of Chile]] by [[Alonso de Ercilla]].<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alonso-de-Ercilla-y-Zuniga Alonso de Ercilla y Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, Spanish soldier and poet, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.]</ref> It was considered the [[national epic]] of the [[Captaincy General of Chile]] and one of the most important works of the [[Spanish Golden Age]] (''Siglo de Oro'').<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alonso-de-Ercilla-y-Zuniga Alonso de Ercilla y Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, Spanish soldier and poet, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.]</ref>\n\n==The poem==\n===Structure===\n''La Araucana'' consists of 37 cantos that are distributed across the poem's three parts.<ref>[http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-3286.html Alonso de Ercilla y Z\u00fa\u00f1iga: La Araucana (in Spanish).]</ref> The first part was published in [[1569 in poetry|1569]]; the second part appeared in [[1578 in poetry|1578]], and it was published along with the first part; the third part was published with the first and second parts in [[1589 in poetry|1589]].

But the Renaissance epic is not a genre that has, as a whole, endured well, and today Ercilla is little known and ''La Araucana'' is rarely read except by specialists and students of Spanish and Latin American literatures, and of course in Chile, where it is subject of special attention in the elementary schools education both in language and history.\n\n''La Araucana'' makes Chile the only American country that was founded under the lights of an epic poem.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==The author==\n[[Alonso de Ercilla]] was born into a noble family in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].<ref>[http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/e/ercilla.htm Alonso de Ercilla, Biograf\u00edas y Vidas.]</ref> He occupied several positions in the household of Prince Philip (later King Philip II of Spain), before requesting and receiving appointment to a military expedition to Chile to subdue the [[Araucanians]] of Chile, he joined the adventurers. He distinguished himself in the ensuing campaign; but, having quarrelled with a comrade, he was condemned to death in 1558 by his general, [[Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza, 5th Marquis of Ca\u00f1ete|Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza]]. The sentence was commuted to imprisonment, but Ercilla was speedily released and fought at the [[Battle of Quipeo]] (14th of December 1558).  He was then exiled to Peru and returned to Spain in 1562.\n==Reception==\nErcilla embodied the Renaissance ideal of being at once a man of action and a man of letters as no other in his time was. He was adept at blending personal, lived experience with literary tradition. He was widely acclaimed in Spain. There is an episode in [[Miguel de Cervantes]]\u2019s 17th-century novel ''[[Don Quixote]]'', when a priest and barber inspect Don Quixote's personal library, to burn the books responsible for driving him to madness. ''La Araucana'' is one of the works which the men spare from the flames, as \"one of the best examples of its genre\", entirely Christian and honorable, and is proclaimed to be among the best poems in the heroic style ever written, good enough to compete with those of Ariosto and Tasso.\n\n[[Voltaire]] was much more critical, describing the poem as rambling and directionless and calling the author more barbarous than the Indians whom it is about. He does, however, express admiration for the speech in Canto II, which he compares favorably to [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]]'s speech in the ''[[Iliad]]''.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070811112834/http://www.pehuen.cl/archivo/biblioteca/la-araucana.PDF Voltaire, en ''Essai Sur la Poesie Epique'', prefacio de la edici\u00f3n virtual de La Araucana, Pehuen Editores.] </ref>\n\n==Events==\nA revolt starts when the conqueror of Chile, [[Pedro de Valdivia]] is captured and killed by [[Mapuche]] (also known as Araucanian) Indians. Ercilla blames Valdivia for his own death, having mistreated the natives who had previously acquiesced to Spanish rule and provoking them into rebellion. However, having previously accepted the rule of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], the Araucanians were now in revolt against their legitimate sovereign lord. This is the ethical position of Ercilla: sympathy for the Indians' suffering, admiration for the courage of their resistance, criticism of Spanish cruelty, but loyalty to and acceptance of the legitimacy of the Spanish cause (the legitimate rule of a duly-constituted prince and the extension of Christianity). Although Ercilla's purpose was to glorify Spanish arms, the figures of Araucanian chiefs, the strong [[Caupolic\u00e1n]], the brilliant [[Lautaro (toqui)|Lautaro]], the old and wise [[Colocolo (tribal chief)|Colocolo]] and the proud [[Galvarino (Mapuche)|Galvarino]], have proved the most memorable.\n\nKey events include the capture and execution of Pedro de Valdivia; the death of the hero Lautaro in the [[Battle of Mataquito]], and the execution of Caupolic\u00e1n the [[Toqui]] for leading the revolt of the Araucanians (thanks to betrayal by one of their own); the encounter with a sorcerer who takes the narrator for a flight above the earth to see events happening in Europe and the Middle East; and the encounter with an Indian woman (Glaura) searching for her husband amongst the dead after a battlefield. This last is an indicator of the humanist side of Ercilla, and a human sympathy which he shows towards the indigenous people. The narrator claims that he attempted to have the life of the Indian chieftain spared.\n\nThe historicity of some events and characters have been put into question. Historian [[Diego Barros Arana]] has argued that the female character [[Janequeo (lonco)|Janequeo]] is an invention that passed down without scrutiny as historical in the chronicles of the [[Jesuit]]s [[Alonso de Ovalle]] and [[Diego de Rosales]].<ref>[[Diego Barros Arana]], Historia general de Chile.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Pedro de Valdivia]]\n* [[Francisco de Villagra]]\n* [[Jer\u00f3nimo de Alderete]]\n* [[Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza, 5th Marquis of Ca\u00f1ete|Garc\u00eda Hurtado de Mendoza]]\n* [[Arauco War]]\n* [[Mapuche|Mapuche people]]\n* [[Indian Lautaro|Lautaro]]\n* [[Caupolic\u00e1n]]\n* [[Colocolo (tribal chief)|Colocolo]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n==Sources==\n{{wikisource|La araucana|La Araucana}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{1911|wstitle=Ercilla y Z\u00faniga, Alonso de|volume=9|page=734}}\n*{{CathEncy|wstitle=Alonso de Ercilla y Z\u00fa\u00f1iga}}\n{{refend}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Araucana, La}}\n[[Category:Spanish literature]]\n[[Category:Epic poems in Spanish]]\n[[Category:Chilean literature]]\n", "name_user": "Srich32977", "label": "safe", "comment": "ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Araucana"}

They recorded their first full-length self-released album in 1998 called ''[[They Sure Don't Make Basketball Shorts Like They Used To]]'', which features a saxophone section headed by Jeremy Wasser, who executive produced the album and recorded the ''Summer Romance'' saxophone solo on [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]]' ''[[S.C.I.E.N.C.E.]]'' album. The Incubus connections continued with Fourth Street Recording's music producer Jim Wirt and logos and visual design by Brett Spivey.\n\nBy this stage, Hoobastank had developed a strong reputation in Southern California. This attracted interest from [[Island Records]], who subsequently signed the band in 2000. At the time of signing, the band had completed a second full-length album, titled ''[[Forward (Hoobastank album)|Forward]]'', also featuring Jeremy Wasser. However, the band felt that the direction they were heading in would work best without a sax, so Wasser departed the band and the album was shelved. A few tracks were rerecorded for release on the band's self-titled 2001 release. The original recordings from the ''Forward'' sessions made their way to the Internet via peer to peer sites in late 2001.\n\n===''Hoobastank'' (2001\u20132002)===\nHoobastank released its [[Hoobastank (album)|self-titled debut album]] in November 2001.

Also, the song was featured in the 2002 inline skating game, ''[[Aggressive Inline (video game)|Aggressive Inline]]'', appearing on the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[PlayStation 2]] and [[GameCube]] consoles. The second single \"[[Running Away]]\" was even more successful, reaching No.&nbsp;44 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, No.&nbsp;2 on the Modern Rock chart, No.&nbsp;9 on the Mainstream Rock chart and No.&nbsp;3 on the MP3.com download chart. The ''Hoobastank'' album went Platinum due to these hit singles and reached No.&nbsp;25 on the ''Billboard'' 200 album charts and No.&nbsp;1 on the ''Billboard'' Heatseeker chart.\n\nThe album achieved recognition internationally with the band touring in Europe and Asia in support of the record. \"[[Remember Me (Hoobastank song)|Remember Me]]\", the third single released from this album, was a moderate hit, reaching No.&nbsp;23 on the Modern Rock charts. The band made a song titled \"Losing My Grip\" for the soundtrack of the movie ''[[The Scorpion King]]''.\n\n===''The Reason'' (2003\u20132005)===\nIn early 2003, the group contributed the song \"Right Before Your Eyes\" to ''[[Daredevil: The Album]]''. The band then entered the studio with producer [[Howard Benson]]. Recording was disrupted for a month when Dan Estrin was seriously injured in a minibike accident in August. Estrin had recovered by October and the band headed off on a [[Nokia]] Unwired Tour with [[The All-American Rejects]] and [[Ozomatli]] in November.\n\nTheir second album ''[[The Reason (Hoobastank album)|The Reason]]'' was released in December 2003. The single \"Out of Control\" was made available for download on the band's website. Doug Robb said on the band's website: \"A lot of it is about asking questions or questioning all that people see. It's not all about religion. \"Out of Control\" is about that and about opening your eyes after being blinded by being devoted to anything.\" \"Same Direction\" would reach No.&nbsp;9 on the US Modern Rock chart, No.&nbsp;16 on the Mainstream Rock chart and No.&nbsp;16 on a composite World Modern Rock chart (based on the US, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Canada, and Australia). A year later, the ''[[Let It Out (DVD)|Let It Out]]'' DVD collected the band's videos. \"The Reason\" was put to a popular music video on [[tangle.com|Tangle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tangle.com/view_video.php?viewkey=acb74a48e2a0a871be96 |title=A reason to live - Today's Christian Videos |publisher=Tangle.com |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[The Reason (Hoobastank song)|title track]] was released as a single in the first half of 2004.

The song was also played during the [[The Last One (Friends)|final episode]] of ''[[Friends]]''. In Canada, it spent 21 weeks at the top, setting a new record for most weeks at No.&nbsp;1.  Meanwhile, in the United States, the album reached No.&nbsp;3 on the ''Billboard'' 200 album chart.\n\nThe band's international profile was increased by a support slot on [[Linkin Park]]'s ''[[Meteora (album)|Meteora]]'' world tour in early 2004.\n\n===''Every Man for Himself'' (2006\u20132007)===\n[[File: US Navy 070123-N-2970T-005 Members of the band 'Hoobastank' sign autographs for fans after their concert at Fleet Activities Sasebo (CFAS).jpg|thumb|Hoobastank signing autographs for fans in 2007]]\n\nTheir third album ''[[Every Man for Himself (album)|Every Man for Himself]]'' was released in May 2006 and debuted at No.&nbsp;12 on the ''Billboard'' chart.

band formed in 1994 in [[Agoura Hills]], [[California]] by lead vocalist Doug Robb, guitarist Dan Estrin, drummer Chris Hesse, and original bassist Markku Lappalainen. They were signed to [[Island Records]] from 2001 to 2012 and have released five albums and one [[extended play]] to date. Their sixth album, ''[[Push Pull (album)|Push Pull]]'', was released on May 25, 2018.

They recorded their first full-length self-released album in 1998 called ''[[They Sure Don't Make Basketball Shorts Like They Used To]]'', which features a saxophone section headed by Jeremy Wasser, who executive produced the album and recorded the ''Summer Romance'' saxophone solo on [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]]' ''[[S.C.I.E.N.C.E.]]'' album. The Incubus connections continued with Fourth Street Recording's music producer Jim Wirt and logos and visual design by Brett Spivey.\n\nBy this stage, Hoobastank had developed a strong reputation in Southern California. This attracted interest from [[Island Records]], who subsequently signed the band in 2000. At the time of signing, the band had completed a second full-length album, titled ''[[Forward (Hoobastank album)|Forward]]'', also featuring Jeremy Wasser. However, the band felt that the direction they were heading in would work best without a sax, so Wasser departed the band and the album was shelved. A few tracks were rerecorded for release on the band's self-titled 2001 release. The original recordings from the ''Forward'' sessions made their way to the Internet via peer to peer sites in late 2001.\n\n===''Hoobastank'' (2001\u20132002)===\nHoobastank released its [[Hoobastank (album)|self-titled debut album]] in November 2001. The first single was \"[[Crawling in the Dark]]\", which was a breakthrough hit, reaching No.&nbsp;68 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], No.&nbsp;3 on the Modern Rock chart, No.&nbsp;7 on the Mainstream Rock chart<ref>{{cite web|url=http://billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.vnuArtistId=470278&model.vnuAlbumId=612770 |title=''Billboard.com'' |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225092120/http://billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.vnuArtistId=470278&model.vnuAlbumId=612770 |archivedate=December 25, 2007 }}</ref> and No.&nbsp;1 on an [[MP3.com]] download chart in early 2002. Also, the song was featured in the 2002 inline skating game, ''[[Aggressive Inline (video game)|Aggressive Inline]]'', appearing on the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[PlayStation 2]] and [[GameCube]] consoles. The second single \"[[Running Away]]\" was even more successful, reaching No.&nbsp;44 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, No.&nbsp;2 on the Modern Rock chart, No.&nbsp;9 on the Mainstream Rock chart and No.&nbsp;3 on the MP3.com download chart. The ''Hoobastank'' album went Platinum due to these hit singles and reached No.&nbsp;25 on the ''Billboard'' 200 album charts and No.&nbsp;1 on the ''Billboard'' Heatseeker chart.\n\nThe album achieved recognition internationally with the band touring in Europe and Asia in support of the record. \"[[Remember Me (Hoobastank song)|Remember Me]]\", the third single released from this album, was a moderate hit, reaching No.&nbsp;23 on the Modern Rock charts. The band made a song titled \"Losing My Grip\" for the soundtrack of the movie ''[[The Scorpion King]]''.\n\n===''The Reason'' (2003\u20132005)===\nIn early 2003, the group contributed the song \"Right Before Your Eyes\" to ''[[Daredevil: The Album]]''. The band then entered the studio with producer [[Howard Benson]]. Recording was disrupted for a month when Dan Estrin was seriously injured in a minibike accident in August. Estrin had recovered by October and the band headed off on a [[Nokia]] Unwired Tour with [[The All-American Rejects]] and [[Ozomatli]] in November.\n\nTheir second album ''[[The Reason (Hoobastank album)|The Reason]]'' was released in December 2003. The single \"Out of Control\" was made available for download on the band's website. Doug Robb said on the band's website: \"A lot of it is about asking questions or questioning all that people see. It's not all about religion. \"Out of Control\" is about that and about opening your eyes after being blinded by being devoted to anything.\" \"Same Direction\" would reach No.&nbsp;9 on the US Modern Rock chart, No.&nbsp;16 on the Mainstream Rock chart and No.&nbsp;16 on a composite World Modern Rock chart (based on the US, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Canada, and Australia). A year later, the ''[[Let It Out (DVD)|Let It Out]]'' DVD collected the band's videos. \"The Reason\" was put to a popular music video on [[tangle.com|Tangle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tangle.com/view_video.php?viewkey=acb74a48e2a0a871be96 |title=A reason to live - Today's Christian Videos |publisher=Tangle.com |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[The Reason (Hoobastank song)|title track]] was released as a single in the first half of 2004. It became a hit, reaching No.&nbsp;2 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, No.&nbsp;1 on the US and World Modern Rock charts, No.&nbsp;10 in Australia, No. 12 in the United Kingdom and No.&nbsp;15 in Germany. The song was also played during the [[The Last One (Friends)|final episode]] of ''[[Friends]]''. In Canada, it spent 21 weeks at the top, setting a new record for most weeks at No.&nbsp;1.  Meanwhile, in the United States, the album reached No.&nbsp;3 on the ''Billboard'' 200 album chart.\n\nThe band's international profile was increased by a support slot on [[Linkin Park]]'s ''[[Meteora (album)|Meteora]]'' world tour in early 2004.\n\n===''Every Man for Himself'' (2006\u20132007)===\n[[File: US Navy 070123-N-2970T-005 Members of the band 'Hoobastank' sign autographs for fans after their concert at Fleet Activities Sasebo (CFAS).jpg|thumb|Hoobastank signing autographs for fans in 2007]]\n\nTheir third album ''[[Every Man for Himself (album)|Every Man for Himself]]'' was released in May 2006 and debuted at No.&nbsp;12 on the ''Billboard'' chart. Three singles, \"[[If I Were You (Hoobastank song)|If I Were You]]\", \"[[Inside of You (Hoobastank song)|Inside of You]]\", and \"[[Born to Lead]]\", were released. Another single, \"If Only\", was planned to be released but was canceled for unknown reasons, possibly because of the low chart achievements of the first three singles. Despite this, the album has been certified Gold in the United States.\n\nOn a 2005 co-headlining tour with [[Velvet Revolver]], the band received a chilly reception from some audiences and rumors of a feud between Robb and Velvet Revolver frontman [[Scott Weiland]] were soon filling Internet message boards. \"If I Were You\" from ''Every Man for Himself'' addressed the whole affair.<ref name=\"bio\">{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=hoobastank|bio=true}}|title=Hoobastank Biography|magazine=Billboard.com}}</ref> Robb later said in an interview with MTV News online that he has nothing against Scott Weiland or any other member of Velvet Revolver.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1508953/20050906/hoobastank.jhtml|title=Hooba Have A Few Words For Velvet Revolver|publisher=MTV.com}}</ref>\n\n===''For(N)ever'' and ''The Greatest Hits'' (2008\u20132009)===\nIn October 2007, Robb posted on the official Hoobastank message boards and said that they have \"set the bar very very high for this next CD\" and that they have \"more ideas going into this CD than ever before\".
