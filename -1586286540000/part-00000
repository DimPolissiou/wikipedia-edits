However, in the 1990s various observations including galaxy clustering and measurements of the [[Hubble constant]] led to increasingly serious problems for this model. Following the discovery of the [[accelerating universe]] in 1998, and observations of the [[cosmic microwave background]] and galaxy [[redshift survey]]s in 2000-2003, it is now generally accepted that [[dark energy]] makes up around 70 percent of the present energy density while [[cold dark matter]] contributes around 25 percent, as in the modern [[Lambda-CDM model]].\n\nThe Einstein-de Sitter model remains a good approximation to our universe in the past at redshifts between around 300 and 2, i.e. well after the radiation-dominated era but before dark energy became important.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Shape of the universe]]\n* [[De Sitter universe]]\n* [[Ultimate fate of the universe]] \n\n== Notes and references ==\n<references/>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Einstein-de Sitter universe}}\n[[Category:General relativity]]\n[[Category:Albert Einstein]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 2000-2003 \u2192 2000\u20132003", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93de_Sitter_universe"}

Without any warning, in defiance of international treaty, he ordered his troops to attack [[Denmark-Norway]] a second time. There followed an [[Assault on Copenhagen|attack]] on the capital [[Copenhagen]], whose residents successfully defended themselves with help from the [[Netherlands|Dutch]], who honored their 1649 treaty to defend Denmark against unprovoked invasion by sending an expeditionary fleet and army, defeating the Swedish fleet in the [[Battle of the Sound]] and relieving the capital. His army partly trapped at [[Landskrona]] and partly isolated on the Danish islands by superior Danish and Dutch forces under Vice-Admiral [[Michiel de Ruyter]], Charles was forced to withdraw in 1659.<ref name=\"Frost\" />\n\n===Bornholm and Tr\u00f8ndelag===\n{{further|Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)}}\n\nMeanwhile, Norwegian forces succeeded in expelling the Swedish occupiers from [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]]. Eventually, the resulting [[Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)|Treaty of Copenhagen]] in 1660 restored Tr\u00f8ndelag to Norway, and also the island of [[Bornholm]] to Denmark.\n\nThe relinquishment of [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] by the Treaty of Copenhagen reflects strong local resistance to the Swedish occupation. Although the Swedish invasion had been welcomed, or at least not resisted, the Swedes issued [[conscription]] orders in Tr\u00f8ndelag and forced 2000 men and young boys down to 15 years of age to join the Swedish armies fighting in Poland and Brandenburg. King [[Carl X Gustav]] was afraid that the [[Tr\u00f8nder]]s would rise against their Swedish occupiers, and thought it wise to keep a large part of the men away. Only about one third of the men ever returned to their homes. Some of them were forced to settle in the Swedish province of [[Estonia]], as the Swedes thought it would be easier to rule the Tr\u00f8nders there. Many of Tr\u00f8ndelag's men were already in the Dano-Norwegian army and navy, so the Swedish-forced conscription nearly emptied Tr\u00f8ndelag of males. The result was devastating, as the farms were left without enough hands to harvest the fields, and famine struck the region. Some local historians of Tr\u00f8ndelag have termed this the [[genocide]] of the Tr\u00f8nders.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Alsaker, Kinn |author2=Sognnes, Kalle |author3=Stenvik, Lars |author4=Skevik, Olav |author5=R\u00f8skaft, Merete  |lastauthoramp=yes |title= Tr\u00f8ndelags historie; bind 2. 1350\u20131850 |publisher= Tapir Akademisk Forlag |year= 2005 |isbn=82-519-2001-9}}</ref>\n\nThe few months of experience with Swedish taxation and conscription left such bitter sentiments that it served to strengthen Dano-Norwegian unity and patriotism, making resistance to Swedish invasions of Denmark-Norway stronger over the next 80 years.<ref name=\"Stagg\"/>\n\n===Scania===\n\nAccording to the ninth article of the Treaty of Roskilde, which ceded Scania (''Sk\u00e5ne''), the inhabitants of the [[Sk\u00e5neland|Scanian lands]] were assured of their privileges, old laws and customs.

Without any warning, in defiance of international treaty, he ordered his troops to attack [[Denmark-Norway]] a second time. There followed an [[Assault on Copenhagen|attack]] on the capital [[Copenhagen]], whose residents successfully defended themselves with help from the [[Netherlands|Dutch]], who honored their 1649 treaty to defend Denmark against unprovoked invasion by sending an expeditionary fleet and army, defeating the Swedish fleet in the [[Battle of the Sound]] and relieving the capital. His army partly trapped at [[Landskrona]] and partly isolated on the Danish islands by superior Danish and Dutch forces under Vice-Admiral [[Michiel de Ruyter]], Charles was forced to withdraw in 1659.<ref name=\"Frost\" />\n\n===Bornholm and Tr\u00f8ndelag===\n{{further|Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)}}\n\nMeanwhile, Norwegian forces succeeded in expelling the Swedish occupiers from [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]]. Eventually, the resulting [[Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)|Treaty of Copenhagen]] in 1660 restored Tr\u00f8ndelag to Norway, and also the island of [[Bornholm]] to Denmark.\n\nThe relinquishment of [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] by the Treaty of Copenhagen reflects strong local resistance to the Swedish occupation. Although the Swedish invasion had been welcomed, or at least not resisted, the Swedes issued [[conscription]] orders in Tr\u00f8ndelag and forced 2000 men and young boys down to 15 years of age to join the Swedish armies fighting in Poland and Brandenburg. King [[Carl X Gustav]] was afraid that the [[Tr\u00f8nder]]s would rise against their Swedish occupiers, and thought it wise to keep a large part of the men away. Only about one third of the men ever returned to their homes. Some of them were forced to settle in the Swedish province of [[Estonia]], as the Swedes thought it would be easier to rule the Tr\u00f8nders there. Many of Tr\u00f8ndelag's men were already in the Dano-Norwegian army and navy, so the Swedish-forced conscription nearly emptied Tr\u00f8ndelag of males. The result was devastating, as the farms were left without enough hands to harvest the fields, and famine struck the region. Some local historians of Tr\u00f8ndelag have termed this the [[genocide]] of the Tr\u00f8nders.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Alsaker, Kinn |author2=Sognnes, Kalle |author3=Stenvik, Lars |author4=Skevik, Olav |author5=R\u00f8skaft, Merete  |lastauthoramp=yes |title= Tr\u00f8ndelags historie; bind 2. 1350\u20131850 |publisher= Tapir Akademisk Forlag |year= 2005 |isbn=82-519-2001-9}}</ref>\n\nThe few months of experience with Swedish taxation and conscription left such bitter sentiments that it served to strengthen Dano-Norwegian unity and patriotism, making resistance to Swedish invasions of Denmark-Norway stronger over the next 80 years.<ref name=\"Stagg\"/>\n\n===Scania===\n\nAccording to the ninth article of the Treaty of Roskilde, which ceded Scania (''Sk\u00e5ne''), the inhabitants of the [[Sk\u00e5neland|Scanian lands]] were assured of their privileges, old laws and customs.

In the [[Middle Ages]], the town rose to national significance with the establishment of [[Northampton Castle]], an occasional royal residence which regularly hosted the [[Parliament of England]]. Medieval Northampton had many churches, monasteries and the [[University of Northampton (thirteenth century)|University of Northampton]], all enclosed by the town walls. It was granted a [[town charter]] by [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] in 1189 and a mayor was appointed by [[John of England|King John]] in 1215. The town was also the site of two medieval battles, in [[Battle of Northampton (1264)|1264]] and [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|1460]].\n\nNorthampton supported the Parliamentary [[Roundhead]]s in the [[English Civil War]], and [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] ordered the destruction of the town walls and most of the castle. The [[Great Fire of Northampton]] in 1675 destroyed much of the town. It was soon rebuilt and grew rapidly with the industrial development of the 18th century. Northampton continued to grow with the arrival of the [[Grand Union Canal]] and the railways in the 19th century, becoming a centre for footwear and leather manufacture.\n\nNorthampton's growth was limited until it was designated as a [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]] in 1968, accelerating development in the town.

In the [[Middle Ages]], the town rose to national significance with the establishment of [[Northampton Castle]], an occasional royal residence which regularly hosted the [[Parliament of England]]. Medieval Northampton had many churches, monasteries and the [[University of Northampton (thirteenth century)|University of Northampton]], all enclosed by the town walls. It was granted a [[town charter]] by [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] in 1189 and a mayor was appointed by [[John of England|King John]] in 1215. The town was also the site of two medieval battles, in [[Battle of Northampton (1264)|1264]] and [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|1460]].\n\nNorthampton supported the Parliamentary [[Roundhead]]s in the [[English Civil War]], and [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] ordered the destruction of the town walls and most of the castle. The [[Great Fire of Northampton]] in 1675 destroyed much of the town. It was soon rebuilt and grew rapidly with the industrial development of the 18th century. Northampton continued to grow with the arrival of the [[Grand Union Canal]] and the railways in the 19th century, becoming a centre for footwear and leather manufacture.\n\nNorthampton's growth was limited until it was designated as a [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]] in 1968, accelerating development in the town.

The corporation of the town, having already refused to provide troops to the King in 1632 or to pay the notorious [[ship money]] tax in 1636, petitioned Parliament in 1642 against [[papist]]s and [[bishop]]s.<ref name=andrewmartin />\n\nWhen war broke out in 1642, the town willingly became the main Parliamentarian [[garrison]] for the south-east Midlands area with the former royal castle as its headquarters. In 1643, [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] attacked Northampton with approximately 2,000 men, but was beaten back at the North Gate of the town. Oliver Cromwell visited in 1645 and [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|General Fairfax]] marched from the town to [[Naseby]], where Charles I's Royalist army was decisively defeated.<ref name=andrewmartin /> Over 4,000 pairs of leather shoes and 600 pairs of cavalry jack-boots for the Parliamentary armies were manufactured in Northampton during the Civil War, and a further 2,000 for Cromwell's [[New Model Army]] in 1648.

He was also influenced by Celtic, Finnish, Slavic, and Greek language and mythology. His fiction also reflected his Christian beliefs, his consumption of contemporary culture, and his personal experiences, including his reaction to twentieth\u2013century warfare.\n<!--need an overview here-->\n\n==Philology==\n\nTolkien was a professional [[philologist]], a scholar of comparative and historical [[linguistics]]. He was especially familiar with [[Old English]] and related languages. Tolkien stated in a letter to his American publisher [[Houghton Mifflin]] on 30 June 1955 that his earlier remark to the poet and ''[[The New York Times]]'' book reviewer [[Harvey Breit]] \"I am a philologist and all my work is philological.\" was meant to imply that his work was \"all of a piece, and ''fundamentally linguistic'' [sic] in inspiration. ... The [[Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien|invention of languages]] is the foundation. The 'stories' were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse.

Even [the Dark Lord] Sauron was not so\",<ref>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', \"The Council of Elrond\"</ref> in other words all things were created good; but that the Inklings as evidenced by [[C.

The tension resulted in the castle being seized and burned down by an angry mob in collaboration with the King's forces. The King's forces would later, after ending their north-going campaign on Funen, return to pillage and plunder Svendborg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://svendborgo.dk/lokalhistorie/index.html|title=Krig og fred: Svendborg lokalhistorie|publisher=Svendborgo.dk|accessdate=13 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref>\n\nAfter 1536, Svendborg went through a brief period of progress becoming the islands main port. But it would not last for long. In the following 250 years, the city faced various setbacks in its development, such as [[Bubonic plague|plague]], a major fire, and the effects of the [[Dano-Swedish War (1658\u201360)|Swedish wars]] when Svendborg's ships were destroyed.<ref name=dcfb/>\n\n===Industrial development===\n\nIt was not until the end of the [[Gunboat War|war with England]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the early 19th century that the city returned to a period of increasing prosperity. The population grew from a mere 1,942 people in 1801 to more than 11,500 in 1901. This development was followed by improvement of the infrastructure, such as rail links with [[Odense]], [[Faaborg]] and [[Nyborg]], improvement of the local roads and the establishment of a real harbour suited for extensive trading, since goods could now easily be transported there. In the middle of the 19th century an explosion of industrialization happened, and all kinds of factories, from engineering to breweries were established together with modern gas and water systems.<ref name=dcfb/>\n\nIn the late 19th century, with industry well established, it was necessary to accommodate the growing population. This led to numerous new schools being founded. Furthermore, a hospital was established in 1871 and expanded in 1891.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fynhistorie.dis-danmark.dk/node/390|title=Svendborgs historie|publisher=fynhistorie.dk|accessdate=13 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref>\n\n===20th century to present===\n[[File:Svendborg dk hafen.JPG|thumb|left|Svendborg Harbour]]\nThe rapid increase in population continued at the beginning of the 20th century as Svendborg developed into an even more important industrial and educational centre. The food and metallurgy sectors became well established. The port prospered with new facilities, including shipyards such as Svendborg Skibsv\u00e6rft which was established in 1907 on an artificial island. On the educational front, a number of maritime and navigational schools were established. The shipyard, which had employed up to 800 in the 1980s finally closed in 2001, some of the facilities being taken over by [[Vestas]]. In recent years, there has been a marked transition from industry into the service sector, the hospital now being one of the principal employers. Tourism has also prospered, especially for those arriving in pleasure boats.<ref name=dcfb/>\n\nThe German writer [[Bertolt Brecht]] spent the first years of his exile from Nazi Germany in Svendborg.

The tension resulted in the castle being seized and burned down by an angry mob in collaboration with the King's forces. The King's forces would later, after ending their north-going campaign on Funen, return to pillage and plunder Svendborg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://svendborgo.dk/lokalhistorie/index.html|title=Krig og fred: Svendborg lokalhistorie|publisher=Svendborgo.dk|accessdate=13 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref>\n\nAfter 1536, Svendborg went through a brief period of progress becoming the islands main port. But it would not last for long. In the following 250 years, the city faced various setbacks in its development, such as [[Bubonic plague|plague]], a major fire, and the effects of the [[Dano-Swedish War (1658\u201360)|Swedish wars]] when Svendborg's ships were destroyed.<ref name=dcfb/>\n\n===Industrial development===\n\nIt was not until the end of the [[Gunboat War|war with England]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the early 19th century that the city returned to a period of increasing prosperity. The population grew from a mere 1,942 people in 1801 to more than 11,500 in 1901. This development was followed by improvement of the infrastructure, such as rail links with [[Odense]], [[Faaborg]] and [[Nyborg]], improvement of the local roads and the establishment of a real harbour suited for extensive trading, since goods could now easily be transported there. In the middle of the 19th century an explosion of industrialization happened, and all kinds of factories, from engineering to breweries were established together with modern gas and water systems.<ref name=dcfb/>\n\nIn the late 19th century, with industry well established, it was necessary to accommodate the growing population. This led to numerous new schools being founded. Furthermore, a hospital was established in 1871 and expanded in 1891.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fynhistorie.dis-danmark.dk/node/390|title=Svendborgs historie|publisher=fynhistorie.dk|accessdate=13 July 2014 |language=Danish}}</ref>\n\n===20th century to present===\n[[File:Svendborg dk hafen.JPG|thumb|left|Svendborg Harbour]]\nThe rapid increase in population continued at the beginning of the 20th century as Svendborg developed into an even more important industrial and educational centre. The food and metallurgy sectors became well established. The port prospered with new facilities, including shipyards such as Svendborg Skibsv\u00e6rft which was established in 1907 on an artificial island. On the educational front, a number of maritime and navigational schools were established. The shipyard, which had employed up to 800 in the 1980s finally closed in 2001, some of the facilities being taken over by [[Vestas]]. In recent years, there has been a marked transition from industry into the service sector, the hospital now being one of the principal employers. Tourism has also prospered, especially for those arriving in pleasure boats.<ref name=dcfb/>\n\nThe German writer [[Bertolt Brecht]] spent the first years of his exile from Nazi Germany in Svendborg.
