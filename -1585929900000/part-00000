{"title_page": "Introduction to gauge theory", "text_new": "{{Introductory article|Gauge theory}}\n{{quantum field theory}}\nA '''gauge theory''' is a type of [[Scientific theory|theory]] in [[physics]]. The word '''gauge''' means a [[measurement]], a thickness, an in-between distance (as in [[Track gauge|railroad tracks]]), or a resulting number of units per certain parameter (a number of loops in an inch of fabric or a [[Gauge (bore diameter)|number of lead balls in a pound of ammunition]]).<ref name=Definition>{{Cite web | url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gauge | title=Definition of Gauge}}</ref> Modern theories describe physical forces in terms of [[Field (physics)|fields]], e.g., the [[electromagnetic field]], the [[gravitational field]], and fields that describe forces between the [[elementary particles]]. A general feature of these field theories is that the fundamental fields cannot be directly measured; however, some associated quantities can be measured, such as charges, energies, and velocities. For example, say you cannot measure the diameter of a lead ball, but you can determine how many lead balls, which are equal in every way, are required to make a pound. Using the number of balls, the elemental mass of lead, and the formula for calculating the volume of a sphere from its diameter, one could indirectly determine the diameter of a single lead ball.<ref name=Definition /> In field theories, different configurations of the unobservable fields can result in identical observable quantities. A transformation from one such field configuration to another is called a '''gauge transformation''';<ref>[[Donald Hill Perkins|Donald H. Perkins]] (1982) ''Introduction to High-Energy Physics''. Addison-Wesley: 22.</ref><ref>[[Roger Penrose]] (2004) ''[[The Road to Reality]]'', p. 451. For an alternative formulation in terms of symmetries of the [[Lagrangian density]], see p. 489. Also see J. D. Jackson (1975) ''Classical Electrodynamics'', 2nd ed. Wiley and Sons: 176.</ref> the lack of change in the measurable quantities, despite the field being transformed, is a property called '''gauge invariance'''. For example, if you could measure the color of lead balls and discover that when you change the color, you still fit the same number of balls in a pound, the property of \"color\" would show '''gauge invariance'''. Since any kind of invariance under a field transformation is considered a [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]], gauge invariance is sometimes called '''gauge symmetry'''. Generally, any theory that has the property of gauge invariance is considered a gauge theory.\n\nFor example, in electromagnetism the electric and magnetic fields, '''E''' and '''B''' are observable, while the potentials ''V'' (\"voltage\") and '''A''' (the [[magnetic vector potential|vector potential]]) are not.<ref>For an argument that ''V'' and '''A''' are more fundamental, see Feynman, Leighton, and Sands, ''The Feynman Lectures'', Addison Wesley Longman, 1970, II-15-7,8,12, but this is partly a matter of personal preference.</ref> Under a gauge transformation in which a constant is added to ''V'', no observable change occurs in '''E''' or '''B'''.\n\nWith the advent of [[quantum mechanics]] in the 1920s, and with successive advances in [[quantum field theory]], the importance of gauge transformations has steadily grown. Gauge theories constrain the laws of physics, because all the changes induced by a gauge transformation have to cancel each other out when written in terms of observable quantities. Over the course of the 20th century, physicists gradually realized that all forces ([[fundamental interaction]]s) arise from the constraints imposed by [[local symmetry|''local'' gauge symmetries]], in which case the transformations vary from point to point in [[spacetime|space and time]]. [[Perturbation theory|Perturbative]] [[quantum field theory]] (usually employed for scattering theory) describes forces in terms of force-mediating particles called [[gauge boson]]s. The nature of these particles is determined by the nature of the gauge transformations. The culmination of these efforts is the [[Standard Model]], a quantum field theory that accurately predicts all of the fundamental interactions except [[gravity]].\n\n==History and importance==\n\nThe earliest field theory having a gauge symmetry was [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s formulation, in 1864\u201365, of [[classical electrodynamics|electrodynamics]]  (\"[[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]]\"). The importance of this symmetry remained unnoticed in the earliest formulations. Similarly unnoticed, [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] had derived Einstein's equations of general relativity by postulating a symmetry under any change of coordinates.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}{{when|date=September 2015}}  Later [[Hermann Weyl]], inspired by success in Einstein's [[general relativity]], conjectured (incorrectly, as it turned out) in 1919 that invariance under the change of [[scale (measurement)|scale]] or \"gauge\" (a term inspired by the various [[track gauge]]s of railroads) might also be a local symmetry of electromagnetism.<ref>[[Hermann Weyl]] (1919), \"Eine neue Erweiterung der Relativit\u00edatstheorie,\" ''Ann. der Physik'' '''59''', 101\u2013133.</ref><ref name=\"Moriyasu1983\">{{cite book|author=K.

After the development of [[quantum mechanics]], Weyl, [[Vladimir Fock|Fock]] and [[Fritz London|London]] modified their gauge choice by replacing the scale factor with a change of wave [[phase (waves)|phase]], and applying it successfully to electromagnetism.<ref>For a review and references, see [[Lochlainn O'Raifeartaigh]] and Norbert Straumann, \"Gauge theory: Historical origins and some modern developments,\" ''Reviews of Modern Physics'', 72 (2000), pp. 1\u201322, {{doi|10.1103/RevModPhys.72.1}}.</ref> Gauge symmetry was generalized mathematically in 1954 by [[Chen Ning Yang]] and [[Robert Mills (physicist)|Robert Mills]] in an attempt to describe the [[Strong interaction|strong nuclear forces]]. This idea, dubbed [[Yang\u2013Mills theory]], later found application in the [[quantum field theory]] of the [[weak force]], and its unification with electromagnetism in the [[electroweak]] theory.\n\nThe importance of gauge theories for physics stems from their tremendous success in providing a unified framework to describe the [[quantum field theory|quantum-mechanical behavior]] of [[electromagnetism]], the [[weak force]] and the [[strong force]]. This gauge theory, known as the [[Standard model|Standard Model]], accurately describes experimental predictions regarding three of the four [[fundamental force]]s of nature.\n\n==In classical physics==\n\n===Electromagnetism===\n{{Main|Gauge fixing}}\nHistorically, the first example of gauge symmetry to be discovered was classical [[electromagnetism]].{{clarify|post-text=Not for classical gravitational fields?|date=September 2015}} A static electric field can be described in terms of an [[electric potential]] (voltage) that is defined at every point in space, and in practical work it is conventional to take the Earth as a physical reference that defines the zero level of the potential, or [[electrical ground|ground]]. But only ''differences'' in potential are physically measurable, which is the reason that a [[voltmeter]] must have two probes, and can only report the voltage difference between them. Thus one could choose to define all voltage differences relative to some other standard, rather than the Earth, resulting in the addition of a constant offset.<ref>Edward Purcell (1963) ''Electricity and Magnetism''. McGraw-Hill: 38.</ref> If the potential <math>V</math> is a solution to [[Maxwell's equations]] then, after this gauge transformation, the new potential <math>V \\rightarrow V+C</math> is also a solution to Maxwell's equations and no experiment can distinguish between these two solutions. In other words, the laws of physics governing electricity and magnetism (that is, Maxwell equations) are invariant under gauge transformation.<ref>J.D. Jackson (1975) ''Classical Electrodynamics'', 2nd ed. Wiley and Sons: 176.</ref> Maxwell's equations have a gauge symmetry.\n\nGeneralizing from static electricity to electromagnetism, we have a second potential, the [[magnetic vector potential]] '''A''', which can also undergo gauge transformations. These transformations may be local. That is, rather than adding a constant onto ''V'', one can add a function that takes on different values at different points in space and time. If '''A''' is also changed in certain corresponding ways, then the same '''E''' and '''B''' fields result. The detailed mathematical relationship between the fields '''E''' and '''B''' and the potentials ''V'' and '''A''' is given in the article [[Gauge fixing]], along with the precise statement of the nature of the gauge transformation. The relevant point here is that the fields remain the same under the gauge transformation, and therefore [[Maxwell's equations]] are still satisfied.\n\nGauge symmetry is closely related to [[charge conservation]]. Suppose that there existed some process by which one could briefly violate conservation of charge by creating a charge ''q'' at a certain point in space, 1, moving it to some other point 2, and then destroying it. We might imagine that this process was consistent with conservation of energy. We could posit a rule stating that creating the charge required an input of energy ''E''<sub>1</sub>=''qV''<sub>1</sub> and destroying it released ''E''<sub>2</sub>=''qV''<sub>2</sub>, which would seem natural since ''qV'' measures the extra energy stored in the electric field because of the existence of a charge at a certain point. Outside of the interval during which the particle exists, conservation of energy would be satisfied, because the net energy released by creation and destruction of the particle, ''qV''<sub>2</sub>-''qV''<sub>1</sub>, would be equal to the work done in moving the particle from 1 to 2, ''qV''<sub>2</sub>-''qV''<sub>1</sub>. But although this scenario salvages conservation of energy, it violates gauge symmetry. Gauge symmetry requires that the laws of physics be invariant under the transformation <math>V \\rightarrow V+C</math>, which implies that no experiment should be able to measure the absolute potential, without reference to some external standard such as an electrical ground. But the proposed rules ''E''<sub>1</sub>=''qV''<sub>1</sub> and ''E''<sub>2</sub>=''qV''<sub>2</sub> for the energies of creation and destruction ''would'' allow an experimenter to determine the absolute potential, simply by comparing the energy input required to create the charge ''q'' at a particular point in space in the case where the potential is <math>V</math> and <math>V+C</math> respectively. The conclusion is that if gauge symmetry holds, and energy is conserved, then charge must be conserved.<ref>Donald H. Perkins (1982) ''Introduction to High-Energy Physics''. Addison-Wesley: 92.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Diffeomorphism of a square.svg|right|thumb|The Cartesian coordinate grid on this square has been distorted by a coordinate transformation, so that there is a nonlinear relationship between the old (x,y) coordinates and the new ones. Einstein's equations of general relativity are still valid in the new coordinate system. Such changes of coordinate system are the gauge transformations of general relativity.]]\n\n===General relativity===\nAs discussed above, the gauge transformations for classical (i.e., non-quantum mechanical) [[general relativity]] are arbitrary coordinate transformations.<ref name=\"Robert M. Wald 1984, p. 260\">[[Robert M. Wald]] (1984) ''General Relativity''. University of Chicago Press: 260.</ref>  Technically, the transformations must be invertible, and both the transformation and its inverse must be smooth, in the sense of being [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] an arbitrary number of times.\n\n====An example of a symmetry in a physical theory: translation invariance====\nSome global symmetries under changes of coordinate predate both general relativity and the concept of a gauge. For example, [[Galileo]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] introduced the notion of [[Galilean transformation|translation invariance]]{{when|date=September 2015}}, an advancement from the [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotelian]] concept that different places in space, such as the earth versus the heavens, obeyed different physical rules.\n\nSuppose, for example, that one observer examines the properties of a hydrogen atom on Earth, the other\u2014on the Moon (or any other place in the universe), the observer will find that their hydrogen atoms exhibit completely identical properties. Again, if one observer had examined a hydrogen atom today and the other\u2014100 years ago (or any other time in the past or in the future), the two experiments would again produce completely identical results. The invariance of the properties of a hydrogen atom with respect to the time and place where these properties were investigated is called translation invariance.\n\nRecalling our two observers from different ages: the time in their experiments is shifted by 100 years. If the time when the older observer did the experiment was ''t'', the time of the modern experiment is ''t''+100 years. Both observers discover the same laws of physics. Because light from hydrogen atoms in distant galaxies may reach the earth after having traveled across space for billions of years, in effect one can do such observations covering periods of time almost all the way back to the [[Big Bang]], and they show that the laws of physics have always been the same.\n\nIn other words, if in the theory we change the time ''t'' to ''t''+100 years (or indeed any other time shift) the theoretical predictions do not change.<ref>[[Charles Misner]], [[Kip Thorne]], and [[John A. Wheeler]] (1973) ''[[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]]''. W. H. Freeman: 68.</ref>\n\n====Another example of a symmetry: the invariance of Einstein's field equation under arbitrary coordinate transformations====\nIn Einstein's [[general relativity]], coordinates like ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', and ''t'' are not only \"relative\" in the global sense of translations like <math>t \\rightarrow t+C</math>, rotations, etc., but become completely arbitrary, so that, for example, one can define an entirely new time-like coordinate according to some arbitrary rule such as <math>t \\rightarrow t+t^3/t_0^2</math>, where <math>t_0</math> has units of time, and yet [[Einstein's equations]] will have the same form.<ref name=\"Robert M. Wald 1984, p. 260\"/><ref>Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973) ''[[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]]''. W. H. Freeman: 967.</ref>\n\nInvariance of the form of an equation under an arbitrary coordinate transformation is customarily referred to as [[general covariance]], and equations with this property are referred to as written in the covariant form. General covariance is a special case of gauge invariance.\n\nMaxwell's equations can also be expressed in a generally covariant form, which is as invariant under general coordinate transformation as Einstein's field equation.\n\n==In quantum mechanics==\n\n===Quantum electrodynamics===\nUntil the advent of quantum mechanics, the only well known example of gauge symmetry was in electromagnetism, and the general significance of the concept was not fully understood. For example, it was not clear whether it was the fields '''E''' and '''B''' or the potentials '''V''' and '''A''' that were the fundamental quantities; if the former, then the gauge transformations could be considered as nothing more than a mathematical trick.\n\n===Aharonov\u2013Bohm experiment===\n[[Image:Double slit diffraction.svg|right|thumb|Double-slit diffraction and interference pattern]]\n\n{{Main|Aharonov\u2013Bohm effect}}\nIn quantum mechanics, a particle such as an electron is also described as a wave. For example, if the [[double-slit experiment]] is performed with electrons, then a wave-like interference pattern is observed. The electron has the highest probability of being detected at locations where the parts of the wave passing through the two slits are in phase with one another, resulting in [[wave interference|constructive interference]]. The frequency of the electron ''wave'' is related to the kinetic energy of an individual electron ''particle'' via the quantum-mechanical relation ''E'' = ''hf''. If there are no electric or magnetic fields present in this experiment, then the electron's energy is constant, and, for example, there will be a high probability of detecting the electron along the central axis of the experiment, where by symmetry the two parts of the wave are in phase.\n\nBut now suppose that the electrons in the experiment are subject to electric or magnetic fields. For example, if an electric field were imposed on one side of the axis but not on the other, the results of the experiment would be affected. The part of the electron wave passing through that side oscillates at a different rate, since its energy has had \u2212''eV'' added to it, where \u2212''e'' is the charge of the electron and ''V'' the electrical potential. The results of the experiment will be different, because phase relationships between the two parts of the electron wave have changed, and therefore the locations of constructive and destructive interference will be shifted to one side or the other. It is the electric potential that occurs here, not the electric field, and this is a manifestation of the fact that it is the potentials and not the fields that are of fundamental significance in quantum mechanics.\n\n[[Image:Aharonov-Bohm effect.svg|thumbnail|left|250px|Schematic of double-slit experiment in which Aharonov\u2013Bohm effect can be observed: electrons pass through two slits, interfering at an observation screen, with the interference pattern shifted when a magnetic field '''B''' is turned on in the cylindrical solenoid, marked in blue on the diagram.]]\n\n====Explanation with potentials====\nIt is even possible to have cases in which an experiment's results differ when the potentials are changed, even if no charged particle is ever exposed to a different field. One such example is the [[Aharonov\u2013Bohm effect]], shown in the figure.<ref>Feynman, Leighton, and Sands (1970) ''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]''. Addison Wesley, vol. II, chpt. 15, section 5.</ref> In this example, turning on the solenoid only causes a magnetic field '''B''' to exist within the solenoid. But the solenoid has been positioned so that the electron cannot possibly pass through its interior. If one believed that the fields were the fundamental quantities, then one would expect that the results of the experiment would be unchanged. In reality, the results are different, because turning on the solenoid changed the vector potential '''A''' in the region that the electrons do pass through. Now that it has been established that it is the potentials '''V''' and '''A''' that are fundamental, and not the fields '''E''' and '''B''', we can see that the gauge transformations, which change '''V''' and '''A''', have real physical significance, rather than being merely mathematical artifacts.\n\n====Gauge invariance: the results of the experiments are independent of the choice of the gauge for the potentials====\nNote that in these experiments, the only quantity that affects the result is the ''difference'' in phase between the two parts of the electron wave. Suppose we imagine the two parts of the electron wave as tiny clocks, each with a single hand that sweeps around in a circle, keeping track of its own phase. Although this cartoon ignores some technical details, it retains the physical phenomena that are important here.<ref>[[Richard Feynman]] (1985) ''[[QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter]]''. Princeton University Press.</ref> If both clocks are sped up by the same amount, the phase relationship between them is unchanged, and the results of experiments are the same. Not only that, but it is not even necessary to change the speed of each clock by a ''fixed'' amount. We could change the angle of the hand on each clock by a ''varying'' amount \u03b8, where \u03b8 could depend on both the position in space and on time. This would have no effect on the result of the experiment, since the final observation of the location of the electron occurs at a single place and time, so that the phase shift in each electron's \"clock\" would be the same, and the two effects would cancel out. This is another example of a gauge transformation: it is local, and it does not change the results of experiments.\n\n===Summary===\nIn summary, gauge symmetry attains its full importance in the context of quantum mechanics. In the application of quantum mechanics to electromagnetism, i.e., [[quantum electrodynamics]], gauge symmetry applies to both electromagnetic waves and electron waves. These two gauge symmetries are in fact intimately related. If a gauge transformation \u03b8 is applied to the electron waves, for example, then one must also apply a corresponding transformation to the potentials that describe the electromagnetic waves.<ref>[[Donald Hill Perkins|Donald H. Perkins]] (1982) ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_High_Energy_Physics.html?id=e63cNigcmOUC Introduction to High-Energy Physics]''. Addison-Wesley: 332.</ref> Gauge symmetry is required in order to make quantum electrodynamics a [[renormalization|renormalizable]] theory, i.e., one in which the calculated predictions of all physically measurable quantities are finite.\n\n===Types of gauge symmetries===\nThe description of the electrons in the subsection above as little clocks is in effect a statement of the mathematical rules according to which the phases of electrons are to be added and subtracted: they are to be treated as ordinary numbers, except that in the case where the result of the calculation falls outside the range of 0\u2264\u03b8<360\u00b0, we force it to \"wrap around\" into the allowed range, which covers a circle. Another way of putting this is that a phase angle of, say, 5\u00b0 is considered to be completely equivalent to an angle of 365\u00b0. Experiments have verified this testable statement about the interference patterns formed by electron waves. Except for the \"wrap-around\" property, the algebraic properties of this mathematical structure are exactly the same as those of the ordinary real numbers.\n\nIn mathematical terminology, electron phases form an [[Abelian group]] under addition, called the [[circle group]] or ''U''(1). \"Abelian\" means that addition  [[commutative law|commutes]], so that \u03b8&nbsp;+&nbsp;\u03c6&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u03c6&nbsp;+&nbsp;\u03b8. [[group (mathematics)|Group]] means that addition [[associativity|associates]] and has an [[identity element]], namely \"0\". Also, for every phase there exists an [[inverse element|inverse]] such that the sum of a phase and its inverse is 0. Other examples of abelian groups are the integers under addition, 0, and negation, and the nonzero fractions under product, 1, and reciprocal.\n\n[[Image:gauge.png|right|thumb|Gauge fixing of a ''twisted'' cylinder.]]\nAs a way of visualizing the choice of a gauge, consider whether it is possible to tell if a cylinder has been twisted. If the cylinder has no bumps, marks, or scratches on it, we cannot tell. We could, however, draw an arbitrary curve along the cylinder, defined by some function \u03b8(''x''), where ''x'' measures distance along the axis of the cylinder. Once this arbitrary choice (the choice of gauge) has been made, it becomes possible to detect it if someone later twists the cylinder.\n\nIn 1954, [[Chen Ning Yang]] and [[Robert Mills (physicist)|Robert Mills]] proposed to generalize these ideas to noncommutative groups. A noncommutative gauge group can describe a field that, unlike the electromagnetic field, interacts with itself. For example, [[general relativity]] states that gravitational fields have energy, and [[special relativity]] concludes that energy is equivalent to mass. Hence a gravitational field induces a further gravitational field. The [[nuclear forces]] also have this self-interacting property.\n\n===Gauge bosons===\nSurprisingly, gauge symmetry can give a deeper explanation for the existence of interactions, such as the electric and nuclear interactions. This arises from a type of gauge symmetry relating to the fact that all particles of a given type are experimentally indistinguishable from one another. Imagine that Alice and Betty are identical twins, labeled at birth by bracelets reading A and B. Because the girls are identical, nobody would be able to tell if they had been switched at birth; the labels A and B are arbitrary, and can be interchanged. Such a permanent interchanging of their identities is like a global gauge symmetry. There is also a corresponding local gauge symmetry, which describes the fact that from one moment to the next, Alice and Betty could swap roles while nobody was looking, and nobody would be able to tell. If we observe that Mom's favorite vase is broken, we can only infer that the blame belongs to one twin or the other, but we cannot tell whether the blame is 100% Alice's and 0% Betty's, or vice versa. If Alice and Betty are in fact quantum-mechanical particles rather than people, then they also have wave properties, including the property of [[superposition principle|superposition]], which allows waves to be added, subtracted, and mixed arbitrarily. It follows that we are not even restricted to complete swaps of identity. For example, if we observe that a certain amount of energy exists in a certain location in space, there is no experiment that can tell us whether that energy is 100% A's and 0% B's, 0% A's and 100% B's, or 20% A's and 80% B's, or some other mixture. The fact that the symmetry is local means that we cannot even count on these proportions to remain fixed as the particles propagate through space. The details of how this is represented mathematically depend on technical issues relating to the [[spin (physics)|spins]] of the particles, but for our present purposes we consider a spinless particle, for which it turns out that the mixing can be specified by some arbitrary choice of gauge \u03b8(''x''), where an angle \u03b8&nbsp;=&nbsp;0\u00b0 represents 100% A and 0% B, \u03b8&nbsp;=&nbsp;90\u00b0 means 0% A and 100% B, and intermediate angles represent mixtures.\n\nAccording to the principles of quantum mechanics, particles do not actually have trajectories through space. Motion can only be described in terms of waves, and the momentum ''p'' of an individual particle is related to its wavelength \u03bb by ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''h''/''\u03bb''. In terms of empirical measurements, the wavelength can only be determined by observing a change in the wave between one point in space and another nearby point (mathematically, by [[derivative|differentiation]]). A wave with a shorter wavelength oscillates more rapidly, and therefore changes more rapidly between nearby points. Now suppose that we arbitrarily fix a gauge at one point in space, by saying that the energy at that location is 20% A's and 80% B's. We then measure the two waves at some other, nearby point, in order to determine their wavelengths. But there are two entirely different reasons that the waves could have changed. They could have changed because they were oscillating with a certain wavelength, or they could have changed because the gauge function changed from a 20\u201380 mixture to, say, 21\u201379. If we ignore the second possibility, the resulting theory doesn't work; strange discrepancies in momentum will show up, violating the principle of conservation of momentum. Something in the theory must be changed.\n\nAgain there are technical issues relating to spin, but in several important cases, including electrically charged particles and particles interacting via nuclear forces, the solution to the problem is to impute physical reality to the gauge function \u03b8(''x''). We say that if the function \u03b8 oscillates, it represents a new type of quantum-mechanical wave, and this new wave has its own momentum ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''h''/''\u03bb'', which turns out to patch up the discrepancies that otherwise would have broken conservation of momentum. In the context of electromagnetism, the particles A and B would be charged particles such as electrons, and the quantum mechanical wave represented by \u03b8 would be the electromagnetic field. (Here we ignore the technical issues raised by the fact that electrons actually have spin 1/2, not spin zero. This oversimplification is the reason that the gauge field \u03b8 comes out to be a scalar, whereas the electromagnetic field is actually represented by a vector consisting of ''V'' and '''A'''.) The result is that we have an explanation for the presence of electromagnetic interactions: if we try to construct a gauge-symmetric theory of identical, non-interacting particles, the result is not self-consistent, and can only be repaired by adding electric and magnetic fields that cause the particles to interact.\n\nAlthough the function \u03b8(''x'') describes a wave, the laws of quantum mechanics require that it also have particle properties. In the case of electromagnetism, the particle corresponding to electromagnetic waves is the photon. In general, such particles are called [[gauge bosons]], where the term \"boson\" refers to a particle with integer spin. In the simplest versions of the theory, gauge bosons are massless, but it is also possible to construct versions in which they have mass, as is the case for the gauge bosons that transmit the nuclear decay forces.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\nThese books are intended for general readers and employ the barest minimum of mathematics.\n* [[Gerard 't Hooft|'t Hooft, Gerard]]: \"Gauge Theories of the Force between Elementary Particles,\" ''Scientific American'', 242(6):104\u2013138 (June 1980).\n* [http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1999/press.html \"Press Release: The 1999 Nobel Prize in Physics\"].

The word '''gauge''' means a [[measurement]], a thickness, an in-between distance (as in [[Track gauge|railroad tracks]]), or a resulting number of units per certain parameter (a number of loops in an inch of fabric or a [[Gauge (bore diameter)|number of lead balls in a pound of ammunition]]).<ref name=Definition>{{Cite web | url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gauge | title=Definition of Gauge}}</ref> Modern theories describe physical forces in terms of [[Field (physics)|fields]], e.g., the [[electromagnetic field]], the [[gravitational field]], and fields that describe forces between the [[elementary particles]]. A general feature of these field theories is that the fundamental fields cannot be directly measured; however, some associated quantities can be measured, such as charges, energies, and velocities. For example, say you cannot measure the diameter of a lead ball, but you can determine how many lead balls, which are equal in every way, are required to make a pound. Using the number of balls, the elemental mass of lead, and the formula for calculating the volume of a sphere from its diameter, one could indirectly determine the diameter of a single lead ball.<ref name=Definition /> In field theories, different configurations of the unobservable fields can result in identical observable quantities. A transformation from one such field configuration to another is called a '''gauge transformation''';<ref>[[Donald Hill Perkins|Donald H. Perkins]] (1982) ''Introduction to High-Energy Physics''. Addison-Wesley: 22.</ref><ref>[[Roger Penrose]] (2004) ''[[The Road to Reality]]'', p. 451. For an alternative formulation in terms of symmetries of the [[Lagrangian density]], see p. 489. Also see J. D. Jackson (1975) ''Classical Electrodynamics'', 2nd ed. Wiley and Sons: 176.</ref> the lack of change in the measurable quantities, despite the field being transformed, is a property called '''gauge invariance'''. For example, if you could measure the color of lead balls and discover that when you change the color, you still fit the same number of balls in a pound, the property of \"color\" would show '''gauge invariance'''. Since any kind of invariance under a field transformation is considered a [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]], gauge invariance is sometimes called '''gauge symmetry'''. Generally, any theory that has the property of gauge invariance is considered a gauge theory.\n\nFor example, in electromagnetism the electric and magnetic fields, '''E''' and '''B''' are observable, while the potentials ''V'' (\"voltage\") and '''A''' (the [[magnetic vector potential|vector potential]]) are not.<ref>For an argument that ''V'' and '''A''' are more fundamental, see Feynman, Leighton, and Sands, ''The Feynman Lectures'', Addison Wesley Longman, 1970, II-15-7,8,12, but this is partly a matter of personal preference.</ref> Under a gauge transformation in which a constant is added to ''V'', no observable change occurs in '''E''' or '''B'''.\n\nWith the advent of [[quantum mechanics]] in the 1920s, and with successive advances in [[quantum field theory]], the importance of gauge transformations has steadily grown. Gauge theories constrain the laws of physics, because all the changes induced by a gauge transformation have to cancel each other out when written in terms of observable quantities. Over the course of the 20th century, physicists gradually realized that all forces ([[fundamental interaction]]s) arise from the constraints imposed by [[local symmetry|''local'' gauge symmetries]], in which case the transformations vary from point to point in [[spacetime|space and time]]. [[Perturbation theory|Perturbative]] [[quantum field theory]] (usually employed for scattering theory) describes forces in terms of force-mediating particles called [[gauge boson]]s. The nature of these particles is determined by the nature of the gauge transformations. The culmination of these efforts is the [[Standard Model]], a quantum field theory that accurately predicts all of the fundamental interactions except [[gravity]].\n\n==History and importance==\n\nThe earliest field theory having a gauge symmetry was [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s formulation, in 1864\u201365, of [[classical electrodynamics|electrodynamics]]  (\"[[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]]\"). The importance of this symmetry remained unnoticed in the earliest formulations. Similarly unnoticed, [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] had derived Einstein's equations of general relativity by postulating a symmetry under any change of coordinates.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}{{when|date=September 2015}}  Later [[Hermann Weyl]], inspired by success in Einstein's [[general relativity]], conjectured (incorrectly, as it turned out) in 1919 that invariance under the change of [[scale (measurement)|scale]] or \"gauge\" (a term inspired by the various [[track gauge]]s of railroads) might also be a local symmetry of electromagnetism.<ref>[[Hermann Weyl]] (1919), \"Eine neue Erweiterung der Relativit\u00edatstheorie,\" ''Ann. der Physik'' '''59''', 101\u2013133.</ref><ref name=\"Moriyasu1983\">{{cite book|author=K.

After the development of [[quantum mechanics]], Weyl, [[Vladimir Fock|Fock]] and [[Fritz London|London]] modified their gauge choice by replacing the scale factor with a change of wave [[phase (waves)|phase]], and applying it successfully to electromagnetism.<ref>For a review and references, see [[Lochlainn O'Raifeartaigh]] and Norbert Straumann, \"Gauge theory: Historical origins and some modern developments,\" ''Reviews of Modern Physics'', 72 (2000), pp. 1\u201322, {{doi|10.1103/RevModPhys.72.1}}.</ref> Gauge symmetry was generalized mathematically in 1954 by [[Chen Ning Yang]] and [[Robert Mills (physicist)|Robert Mills]] in an attempt to describe the [[Strong interaction|strong nuclear forces]]. This idea, dubbed [[Yang\u2013Mills theory]], later found application in the [[quantum field theory]] of the [[weak force]], and its unification with electromagnetism in the [[electroweak]] theory.\n\nThe importance of gauge theories for physics stems from their tremendous success in providing a unified framework to describe the [[quantum field theory|quantum-mechanical behavior]] of [[electromagnetism]], the [[weak force]] and the [[strong force]]. This gauge theory, known as the [[Standard model|Standard Model]], accurately describes experimental predictions regarding three of the four [[fundamental force]]s of nature.\n\n==In classical physics==\n\n===Electromagnetism===\n{{Main|Gauge fixing}}\nHistorically, the first example of gauge symmetry to be discovered was classical [[electromagnetism]].{{clarify|post-text=Not for classical gravitational fields?|date=September 2015}} A static electric field can be described in terms of an [[electric potential]] (voltage) that is defined at every point in space, and in practical work it is conventional to take the Earth as a physical reference that defines the zero level of the potential, or [[electrical ground|ground]]. But only ''differences'' in potential are physically measurable, which is the reason that a [[voltmeter]] must have two probes, and can only report the voltage difference between them. Thus one could choose to define all voltage differences relative to some other standard, rather than the Earth, resulting in the addition of a constant offset.<ref>Edward Purcell (1963) ''Electricity and Magnetism''. McGraw-Hill: 38.</ref> If the potential <math>V</math> is a solution to [[Maxwell's equations]] then, after this gauge transformation, the new potential <math>V \\rightarrow V+C</math> is also a solution to Maxwell's equations and no experiment can distinguish between these two solutions. In other words, the laws of physics governing electricity and magnetism (that is, Maxwell equations) are invariant under gauge transformation.<ref>J.D. Jackson (1975) ''Classical Electrodynamics'', 2nd ed. Wiley and Sons: 176.</ref> Maxwell's equations have a gauge symmetry.\n\nGeneralizing from static electricity to electromagnetism, we have a second potential, the [[magnetic vector potential]] '''A''', which can also undergo gauge transformations. These transformations may be local. That is, rather than adding a constant onto ''V'', one can add a function that takes on different values at different points in space and time. If '''A''' is also changed in certain corresponding ways, then the same '''E''' and '''B''' fields result. The detailed mathematical relationship between the fields '''E''' and '''B''' and the potentials ''V'' and '''A''' is given in the article [[Gauge fixing]], along with the precise statement of the nature of the gauge transformation. The relevant point here is that the fields remain the same under the gauge transformation, and therefore [[Maxwell's equations]] are still satisfied.\n\nGauge symmetry is closely related to [[charge conservation]]. Suppose that there existed some process by which one could briefly violate conservation of charge by creating a charge ''q'' at a certain point in space, 1, moving it to some other point 2, and then destroying it. We might imagine that this process was consistent with conservation of energy. We could posit a rule stating that creating the charge required an input of energy ''E''<sub>1</sub>=''qV''<sub>1</sub> and destroying it released ''E''<sub>2</sub>=''qV''<sub>2</sub>, which would seem natural since ''qV'' measures the extra energy stored in the electric field because of the existence of a charge at a certain point. Outside of the interval during which the particle exists, conservation of energy would be satisfied, because the net energy released by creation and destruction of the particle, ''qV''<sub>2</sub>-''qV''<sub>1</sub>, would be equal to the work done in moving the particle from 1 to 2, ''qV''<sub>2</sub>-''qV''<sub>1</sub>. But although this scenario salvages conservation of energy, it violates gauge symmetry. Gauge symmetry requires that the laws of physics be invariant under the transformation <math>V \\rightarrow V+C</math>, which implies that no experiment should be able to measure the absolute potential, without reference to some external standard such as an electrical ground. But the proposed rules ''E''<sub>1</sub>=''qV''<sub>1</sub> and ''E''<sub>2</sub>=''qV''<sub>2</sub> for the energies of creation and destruction ''would'' allow an experimenter to determine the absolute potential, simply by comparing the energy input required to create the charge ''q'' at a particular point in space in the case where the potential is <math>V</math> and <math>V+C</math> respectively. The conclusion is that if gauge symmetry holds, and energy is conserved, then charge must be conserved.<ref>Donald H. Perkins (1982) ''Introduction to High-Energy Physics''. Addison-Wesley: 92.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Diffeomorphism of a square.svg|right|thumb|The Cartesian coordinate grid on this square has been distorted by a coordinate transformation, so that there is a nonlinear relationship between the old (x,y) coordinates and the new ones. Einstein's equations of general relativity are still valid in the new coordinate system. Such changes of coordinate system are the gauge transformations of general relativity.]]\n\n===General relativity===\nAs discussed above, the gauge transformations for classical (i.e., non-quantum mechanical) [[general relativity]] are arbitrary coordinate transformations.<ref name=\"Robert M. Wald 1984, p. 260\">[[Robert M. Wald]] (1984) ''General Relativity''. University of Chicago Press: 260.</ref>  Technically, the transformations must be invertible, and both the transformation and its inverse must be smooth, in the sense of being [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] an arbitrary number of times.\n\n====An example of a symmetry in a physical theory: translation invariance====\nSome global symmetries under changes of coordinate predate both general relativity and the concept of a gauge. For example, [[Galileo]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] introduced the notion of [[Galilean transformation|translation invariance]]{{when|date=September 2015}}, an advancement from the [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotelian]] concept that different places in space, such as the earth versus the heavens, obeyed different physical rules.\n\nSuppose, for example, that one observer examines the properties of a hydrogen atom on Earth, the other\u2014on the Moon (or any other place in the universe), the observer will find that their hydrogen atoms exhibit completely identical properties. Again, if one observer had examined a hydrogen atom today and the other\u2014100 years ago (or any other time in the past or in the future), the two experiments would again produce completely identical results. The invariance of the properties of a hydrogen atom with respect to the time and place where these properties were investigated is called translation invariance.\n\nRecalling our two observers from different ages: the time in their experiments is shifted by 100 years. If the time when the older observer did the experiment was ''t'', the time of the modern experiment is ''t''+100 years. Both observers discover the same laws of physics. Because light from hydrogen atoms in distant galaxies may reach the earth after having traveled across space for billions of years, in effect one can do such observations covering periods of time almost all the way back to the [[Big Bang]], and they show that the laws of physics have always been the same.\n\nIn other words, if in the theory we change the time ''t'' to ''t''+100 years (or indeed any other time shift) the theoretical predictions do not change.<ref>[[Charles Misner]], [[Kip Thorne]], and [[John A. Wheeler]] (1973) ''[[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]]''. W. H. Freeman: 68.</ref>\n\n====Another example of a symmetry: the invariance of Einstein's field equation under arbitrary coordinate transformations====\nIn Einstein's [[general relativity]], coordinates like ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', and ''t'' are not only \"relative\" in the global sense of translations like <math>t \\rightarrow t+C</math>, rotations, etc., but become completely arbitrary, so that, for example, one can define an entirely new time-like coordinate according to some arbitrary rule such as <math>t \\rightarrow t+t^3/t_0^2</math>, where <math>t_0</math> has units of time, and yet [[Einstein's equations]] will have the same form.<ref name=\"Robert M. Wald 1984, p. 260\"/><ref>Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973) ''[[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]]''. W. H. Freeman: 967.</ref>\n\nInvariance of the form of an equation under an arbitrary coordinate transformation is customarily referred to as [[general covariance]], and equations with this property are referred to as written in the covariant form. General covariance is a special case of gauge invariance.\n\nMaxwell's equations can also be expressed in a generally covariant form, which is as invariant under general coordinate transformation as Einstein's field equation.\n\n==In quantum mechanics==\n\n===Quantum electrodynamics===\nUntil the advent of quantum mechanics, the only well known example of gauge symmetry was in electromagnetism, and the general significance of the concept was not fully understood. For example, it was not clear whether it was the fields '''E''' and '''B''' or the potentials '''V''' and '''A''' that were the fundamental quantities; if the former, then the gauge transformations could be considered as nothing more than a mathematical trick.\n\n===Aharonov\u2013Bohm experiment===\n[[Image:Double slit diffraction.svg|right|thumb|Double-slit diffraction and interference pattern]]\n\n{{Main|Aharonov\u2013Bohm effect}}\nIn quantum mechanics, a particle such as an electron is also described as a wave. For example, if the [[double-slit experiment]] is performed with electrons, then a wave-like interference pattern is observed. The electron has the highest probability of being detected at locations where the parts of the wave passing through the two slits are in phase with one another, resulting in [[wave interference|constructive interference]]. The frequency of the electron ''wave'' is related to the kinetic energy of an individual electron ''particle'' via the quantum-mechanical relation ''E'' = ''hf''. If there are no electric or magnetic fields present in this experiment, then the electron's energy is constant, and, for example, there will be a high probability of detecting the electron along the central axis of the experiment, where by symmetry the two parts of the wave are in phase.\n\nBut now suppose that the electrons in the experiment are subject to electric or magnetic fields. For example, if an electric field was imposed on one side of the axis but not on the other, the results of the experiment would be affected. The part of the electron wave passing through that side oscillates at a different rate, since its energy has had \u2212''eV'' added to it, where \u2212''e'' is the charge of the electron and ''V'' the electrical potential. The results of the experiment will be different, because phase relationships between the two parts of the electron wave have changed, and therefore the locations of constructive and destructive interference will be shifted to one side or the other. It is the electric potential that occurs here, not the electric field, and this is a manifestation of the fact that it is the potentials and not the fields that are of fundamental significance in quantum mechanics.\n\n[[Image:Aharonov-Bohm effect.svg|thumbnail|left|250px|Schematic of double-slit experiment in which Aharonov\u2013Bohm effect can be observed: electrons pass through two slits, interfering at an observation screen, with the interference pattern shifted when a magnetic field '''B''' is turned on in the cylindrical solenoid, marked in blue on the diagram.]]\n\n====Explanation with potentials====\nIt is even possible to have cases in which an experiment's results differ when the potentials are changed, even if no charged particle is ever exposed to a different field. One such example is the [[Aharonov\u2013Bohm effect]], shown in the figure.<ref>Feynman, Leighton, and Sands (1970) ''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]''. Addison Wesley, vol. II, chpt. 15, section 5.</ref> In this example, turning on the solenoid only causes a magnetic field '''B''' to exist within the solenoid. But the solenoid has been positioned so that the electron cannot possibly pass through its interior. If one believed that the fields were the fundamental quantities, then one would expect that the results of the experiment would be unchanged. In reality, the results are different, because turning on the solenoid changed the vector potential '''A''' in the region that the electrons do pass through. Now that it has been established that it is the potentials '''V''' and '''A''' that are fundamental, and not the fields '''E''' and '''B''', we can see that the gauge transformations, which change '''V''' and '''A''', have real physical significance, rather than being merely mathematical artifacts.\n\n====Gauge invariance: the results of the experiments are independent of the choice of the gauge for the potentials====\nNote that in these experiments, the only quantity that affects the result is the ''difference'' in phase between the two parts of the electron wave. Suppose we imagine the two parts of the electron wave as tiny clocks, each with a single hand that sweeps around in a circle, keeping track of its own phase. Although this cartoon ignores some technical details, it retains the physical phenomena that are important here.<ref>[[Richard Feynman]] (1985) ''[[QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter]]''. Princeton University Press.</ref> If both clocks are sped up by the same amount, the phase relationship between them is unchanged, and the results of experiments are the same. Not only that, but it is not even necessary to change the speed of each clock by a ''fixed'' amount. We could change the angle of the hand on each clock by a ''varying'' amount \u03b8, where \u03b8 could depend on both the position in space and on time. This would have no effect on the result of the experiment, since the final observation of the location of the electron occurs at a single place and time, so that the phase shift in each electron's \"clock\" would be the same, and the two effects would cancel out. This is another example of a gauge transformation: it is local, and it does not change the results of experiments.\n\n===Summary===\nIn summary, gauge symmetry attains its full importance in the context of quantum mechanics. In the application of quantum mechanics to electromagnetism, i.e., [[quantum electrodynamics]], gauge symmetry applies to both electromagnetic waves and electron waves. These two gauge symmetries are in fact intimately related. If a gauge transformation \u03b8 is applied to the electron waves, for example, then one must also apply a corresponding transformation to the potentials that describe the electromagnetic waves.<ref>[[Donald Hill Perkins|Donald H. Perkins]] (1982) ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_High_Energy_Physics.html?id=e63cNigcmOUC Introduction to High-Energy Physics]''. Addison-Wesley: 332.</ref> Gauge symmetry is required in order to make quantum electrodynamics a [[renormalization|renormalizable]] theory, i.e., one in which the calculated predictions of all physically measurable quantities are finite.\n\n===Types of gauge symmetries===\nThe description of the electrons in the subsection above as little clocks is in effect a statement of the mathematical rules according to which the phases of electrons are to be added and subtracted: they are to be treated as ordinary numbers, except that in the case where the result of the calculation falls outside the range of 0\u2264\u03b8<360\u00b0, we force it to \"wrap around\" into the allowed range, which covers a circle. Another way of putting this is that a phase angle of, say, 5\u00b0 is considered to be completely equivalent to an angle of 365\u00b0. Experiments have verified this testable statement about the interference patterns formed by electron waves. Except for the \"wrap-around\" property, the algebraic properties of this mathematical structure are exactly the same as those of the ordinary real numbers.\n\nIn mathematical terminology, electron phases form an [[Abelian group]] under addition, called the [[circle group]] or ''U''(1). \"Abelian\" means that addition  [[commutative law|commutes]], so that \u03b8&nbsp;+&nbsp;\u03c6&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u03c6&nbsp;+&nbsp;\u03b8. [[group (mathematics)|Group]] means that addition [[associativity|associates]] and has an [[identity element]], namely \"0\". Also, for every phase there exists an [[inverse element|inverse]] such that the sum of a phase and its inverse is 0. Other examples of abelian groups are the integers under addition, 0, and negation, and the nonzero fractions under product, 1, and reciprocal.\n\n[[Image:gauge.png|right|thumb|Gauge fixing of a ''twisted'' cylinder.]]\nAs a way of visualizing the choice of a gauge, consider whether it is possible to tell if a cylinder has been twisted. If the cylinder has no bumps, marks, or scratches on it, we cannot tell. We could, however, draw an arbitrary curve along the cylinder, defined by some function \u03b8(''x''), where ''x'' measures distance along the axis of the cylinder. Once this arbitrary choice (the choice of gauge) has been made, it becomes possible to detect it if someone later twists the cylinder.\n\nIn 1954, [[Chen Ning Yang]] and [[Robert Mills (physicist)|Robert Mills]] proposed to generalize these ideas to noncommutative groups. A noncommutative gauge group can describe a field that, unlike the electromagnetic field, interacts with itself. For example, [[general relativity]] states that gravitational fields have energy, and [[special relativity]] concludes that energy is equivalent to mass. Hence a gravitational field induces a further gravitational field. The [[nuclear forces]] also have this self-interacting property.\n\n===Gauge bosons===\nSurprisingly, gauge symmetry can give a deeper explanation for the existence of interactions, such as the electric and nuclear interactions. This arises from a type of gauge symmetry relating to the fact that all particles of a given type are experimentally indistinguishable from one another. Imagine that Alice and Betty are identical twins, labeled at birth by bracelets reading A and B. Because the girls are identical, nobody would be able to tell if they had been switched at birth; the labels A and B are arbitrary, and can be interchanged. Such a permanent interchanging of their identities is like a global gauge symmetry. There is also a corresponding local gauge symmetry, which describes the fact that from one moment to the next, Alice and Betty could swap roles while nobody was looking, and nobody would be able to tell. If we observe that Mom's favorite vase is broken, we can only infer that the blame belongs to one twin or the other, but we cannot tell whether the blame is 100% Alice's and 0% Betty's, or vice versa. If Alice and Betty are in fact quantum-mechanical particles rather than people, then they also have wave properties, including the property of [[superposition principle|superposition]], which allows waves to be added, subtracted, and mixed arbitrarily. It follows that we are not even restricted to complete swaps of identity. For example, if we observe that a certain amount of energy exists in a certain location in space, there is no experiment that can tell us whether that energy is 100% A's and 0% B's, 0% A's and 100% B's, or 20% A's and 80% B's, or some other mixture. The fact that the symmetry is local means that we cannot even count on these proportions to remain fixed as the particles propagate through space. The details of how this is represented mathematically depend on technical issues relating to the [[spin (physics)|spins]] of the particles, but for our present purposes we consider a spinless particle, for which it turns out that the mixing can be specified by some arbitrary choice of gauge \u03b8(''x''), where an angle \u03b8&nbsp;=&nbsp;0\u00b0 represents 100% A and 0% B, \u03b8&nbsp;=&nbsp;90\u00b0 means 0% A and 100% B, and intermediate angles represent mixtures.\n\nAccording to the principles of quantum mechanics, particles do not actually have trajectories through space. Motion can only be described in terms of waves, and the momentum ''p'' of an individual particle is related to its wavelength \u03bb by ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''h''/''\u03bb''. In terms of empirical measurements, the wavelength can only be determined by observing a change in the wave between one point in space and another nearby point (mathematically, by [[derivative|differentiation]]). A wave with a shorter wavelength oscillates more rapidly, and therefore changes more rapidly between nearby points. Now suppose that we arbitrarily fix a gauge at one point in space, by saying that the energy at that location is 20% A's and 80% B's. We then measure the two waves at some other, nearby point, in order to determine their wavelengths. But there are two entirely different reasons that the waves could have changed. They could have changed because they were oscillating with a certain wavelength, or they could have changed because the gauge function changed from a 20\u201380 mixture to, say, 21\u201379. If we ignore the second possibility, the resulting theory doesn't work; strange discrepancies in momentum will show up, violating the principle of conservation of momentum. Something in the theory must be changed.\n\nAgain there are technical issues relating to spin, but in several important cases, including electrically charged particles and particles interacting via nuclear forces, the solution to the problem is to impute physical reality to the gauge function \u03b8(''x''). We say that if the function \u03b8 oscillates, it represents a new type of quantum-mechanical wave, and this new wave has its own momentum ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''h''/''\u03bb'', which turns out to patch up the discrepancies that otherwise would have broken conservation of momentum. In the context of electromagnetism, the particles A and B would be charged particles such as electrons, and the quantum mechanical wave represented by \u03b8 would be the electromagnetic field. (Here we ignore the technical issues raised by the fact that electrons actually have spin 1/2, not spin zero. This oversimplification is the reason that the gauge field \u03b8 comes out to be a scalar, whereas the electromagnetic field is actually represented by a vector consisting of ''V'' and '''A'''.) The result is that we have an explanation for the presence of electromagnetic interactions: if we try to construct a gauge-symmetric theory of identical, non-interacting particles, the result is not self-consistent, and can only be repaired by adding electric and magnetic fields that cause the particles to interact.\n\nAlthough the function \u03b8(''x'') describes a wave, the laws of quantum mechanics require that it also have particle properties. In the case of electromagnetism, the particle corresponding to electromagnetic waves is the photon. In general, such particles are called [[gauge bosons]], where the term \"boson\" refers to a particle with integer spin. In the simplest versions of the theory, gauge bosons are massless, but it is also possible to construct versions in which they have mass, as is the case for the gauge bosons that transmit the nuclear decay forces.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\nThese books are intended for general readers and employ the barest minimum of mathematics.\n* [[Gerard 't Hooft|'t Hooft, Gerard]]: \"Gauge Theories of the Force between Elementary Particles,\" ''Scientific American'', 242(6):104\u2013138 (June 1980).\n* [http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1999/press.html \"Press Release: The 1999 Nobel Prize in Physics\"].

They are members of the {{English football updater|DaventrT}}.\n\n==History==\nThe club was established in 1886 as a local-town club playing in the Northampton Town League.  The club moved to the Northants Combination in 1987, and their emergence began under manager Willie Barrett, who led the club to successive championships in the Combination First and Premier divisions.<ref>[http://www.daventrytownfc.fanspace.com/History.htm History] Daventry Town FC Fanspace History</ref> In 1989\u201390, the club joined the [[United Counties Football League|United Counties League]] Division One. Since joining the United Counties League, they have won promotion to the Premier Division on three occasions, but have also been relegated twice.\n\nThe club started at The Hollow Ground in the town, but having won promotion at the first attempt were denied because their new Elderstubbs ground was not ready in time. Their manager left, and the fortunes of the club declined with relegation alternating with promotion.\n\nThe club was threatened with extinction in 2005\u201306, when the Elderstubbs clubhouse and changing rooms were destroyed by fire.  However, a sponsorship deal with [[mobile phone]] company Go Mobile enabled the club to survive.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n2007\u201308 was a very successful season for Daventry Town. They won UCL Division One, losing just once, and defeated three Premier division teams en route to the League Knockout Cup final, where they were defeated by [[Desborough Town F.C.|Desborough Town]] 3\u20132.\n\nIn the 2009\u201310 season Daventry won promotion to the Southern League Division One Central, by becoming champions of the United Counties League under the guidance of manager Darren Foster.\n\n2010\u20132011, Fuller's Town finished 3rd in their first season in the Southern League Division One Central losing to [[Hitchin Town F.C.|Hitchin Town]] 2\u20130 in the play off final in front of a crowd of 1048.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2011\u20132012 [[Mark Kinsella]] was brought in and Ady Fuller moved on to become manager of [[Banbury United F.C.|Banbury United]]. A majority of Fuller's team moved elsewhere. Over 40 players wore the purple shirt during the season and not surprisingly the team struggled to find any consistency until the end of the season.\n\nDuring the 2011\u20132012, local rivals [[Daventry United F.C.|Daventry United]] folded and their Manager Darran Foster moved to Daventry Town as [[Mark Kinsella| Mark Kinsella's]] Assistant. However, Kinsella was relieved of his duties shortly afterwards and Foster took charge of team affairs.  In Foster's first season, 2012\u20132013, Town finished a highly respectable 8th in the table.\n\nWith a majority of the players remaining at the club for the 2013\u201314 season, the team made an incredible start to the campaign, winning their first 7 matches in the league whilst also qualifying for the [[FA Cup]] first round proper for the first time in their history. They were drawn away to [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] from [[Football League Two]], and ended up losing the tie 2\u20130.\n\nAfter the playing budget was cut, manager Darran Foster resigned in early November 2014. Daventry then appointed ex [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] striker [[Allan Smart]] as his replacement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southern-football-league.co.uk/league-news/daventry-appoint-smart-as-new-manager |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141109140136/http://www.southern-football-league.co.uk/league-news/daventry-appoint-smart-as-new-manager |archivedate=9 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHowever, in June 2015, Iain Humphrey resigned as chairman and was replaced by Allan Smart, who relinquished his role as Daventry Town's manager in the process.<ref>http://nonleague.pitchero.com/news/blow-for-daventry-as-chairman-resigns-40300/</ref>\n\nAdy Fuller, who had served as Smart's assistant and had a previous spell as Daventry Town boss as well as stints as manager at Banbury United and [[Bedworth United F.C.|Bedworth United]], was appointed as caretaker manager in the interim period in June 2015.<ref>http://nonleague.pitchero.com/news/fuller-takes-interim-charge-at-daventry-40332/</ref>\n\nHowever, Humphrey would make a U-turn and return as chairman just a month later, in July 2015, replacing Smart and caretaker manager Fuller who both left the club altogether. His first move was to re-appoint former manager Darran Foster who had left the club in November 2014. Foster had only just been appointed manager at [[Woodford United F.C.|Woodford United]] in June 2015.<ref>http://nonleague.pitchero.com/news/foster-returns-to-daventry-41053/</ref>\n\nFoster resigned in April 2016 following a 5 0 home defeat to Kidsgrove Athletic.<ref>http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/daventrytown/news/manager-darran-foster-has-resigned-1587745.html/</ref>\n\nClub Goalkeeping Coach Derren Midson and the Club's Juniors Development Officer Pete Flockhart stepped in as Caretaker Managers with Brian Porter returning as Club Secretary to ensure the club somehow completed their remaining 6 fixtures of the 2015/2016 season.\n\nIn May 2016, Daventry Town resigned from the Northern Premier League due to financial problems and were later placed in the United Counties League Division One, step 9 of English football for the 2016/17 season. Ian Humphrey resigned and handed over full control to a New Executive Committee. Local businessman Steve Tubb took over as Chairman.<ref>http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/daventrytown/news/join-the-fun-1602939.html/</ref>\n\nIn May 2016, Woodford United Player Manager Arron Parkinson and Ex-Cogenhoe United Manager Andy Marks were confirmed as Joint Managers for season 2016-17.<ref>http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/daventrytown/news/new-management-pairing-in-at-town-1614238.html/</ref>\n\nIn April 2017, Daventry Town won the UCL Division One in their first season back at this level, going undefeated at home. They were promoted to the United Counties Premier Division.<ref>http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/daventrytown/teams/39062/match-centre/0-3374552/</ref>\n\nFollowing Andy Marks's decision to step down as Joint Manager, Ian King was appointed Joint Manager alongside Arron Parkinson.<ref>http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/daventrytown/news/town-appoint-arron-parkinson-and-ian-king-as-joint-1818164.html/</ref>\n\nIn May 2018, Daventry Town won the Buckingham Charity Cup beating Buckingham Athletic 2 0 in the final.<ref>http://sportsshots.org.uk/?p=34622/</ref>\n\nIn June 2018, Ian King resigned so he could find a position in the professional game. Arron Parkinson took on the role as Manager and appointed former Woodford United and AFC Rushden & Diamonds keeper Matt Finlay as his Assistant. Pete Harris joined as Coach and Andy Emery was announced as Reserve Team Manager.<ref>https://dtfc.co.uk/first-team-manager-arron-parkinson/</ref>\n\n2018/19 saw Arron Parkinson lead the club to the double by winning the UCL Premier Division and the UCL Knock Out Cup.

They are members of the {{English football updater|DaventrT}}.\n\n==History==\nThe club was established in 1886 as a local-town club playing in the Northampton Town League.  The club moved to the Northants Combination in 1987, and their emergence began under manager Willie Barrett, who led the club to successive championships in the Combination First and Premier divisions.<ref>[http://www.daventrytownfc.fanspace.com/History.htm History] Daventry Town FC Fanspace History</ref> In 1989\u201390, the club joined the [[United Counties Football League|United Counties League]] Division One. Since joining the United Counties League, they have won promotion to the Premier Division on three occasions, but have also been relegated twice.\n\nThe club started at The Hollow Ground in the town, but having won promotion at the first attempt were denied because their new Elderstubbs ground was not ready in time. Their manager left, and the fortunes of the club declined with relegation alternating with promotion.\n\nThe club was threatened with extinction in 2005\u201306, when the Elderstubbs clubhouse and changing rooms were destroyed by fire.  However, a sponsorship deal with [[mobile phone]] company Go Mobile enabled the club to survive.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n2007\u201308 was a very successful season for Daventry Town. They won UCL Division One, losing just once, and defeated three Premier division teams en route to the League Knockout Cup final, where they were defeated by [[Desborough Town F.C.|Desborough Town]] 3\u20132.\n\nIn the 2009\u201310 season Daventry won promotion to the Southern League Division One Central, by becoming champions of the United Counties League under the guidance of manager Darren Foster.\n\n2010\u20132011, Fuller's Town finished 3rd in their first season in the Southern League Division One Central losing to [[Hitchin Town F.C.|Hitchin Town]] 2\u20130 in the play off final in front of a crowd of 1048.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2011\u20132012 [[Mark Kinsella]] was brought in and Ady Fuller moved on to become manager of [[Banbury United F.C.|Banbury United]]. A majority of Fuller's team moved elsewhere. Over 40 players wore the purple shirt during the season and not surprisingly the team struggled to find any consistency until the end of the season.\n\nDuring the 2011\u20132012, local rivals [[Daventry United F.C.|Daventry United]] folded and their Manager Darran Foster moved to Daventry Town as [[Mark Kinsella| Mark Kinsella's]] Assistant. However, Kinsella was relieved of his duties shortly afterwards and Foster took charge of team affairs.  In Foster's first season, 2012\u20132013, Town finished a highly respectable 8th in the table.\n\nWith a majority of the players remaining at the club for the 2013\u201314 season, the team made an incredible start to the campaign, winning their first 7 matches in the league whilst also qualifying for the [[FA Cup]] first round proper for the first time in their history. They were drawn away to [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] from [[Football League Two]], and ended up losing the tie 2\u20130.\n\nAfter the playing budget was cut, manager Darran Foster resigned in early November 2014. Daventry then appointed ex [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] striker [[Allan Smart]] as his replacement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southern-football-league.co.uk/league-news/daventry-appoint-smart-as-new-manager |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141109140136/http://www.southern-football-league.co.uk/league-news/daventry-appoint-smart-as-new-manager |archivedate=9 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHowever, in June 2015, Iain Humphrey resigned as chairman and was replaced by Allan Smart, who relinquished his role as Daventry Town's manager in the process.<ref>http://nonleague.pitchero.com/news/blow-for-daventry-as-chairman-resigns-40300/</ref>\n\nAdy Fuller, who had served as Smart's assistant and had a previous spell as Daventry Town boss as well as stints as manager at Banbury United and [[Bedworth United F.C.|Bedworth United]], was appointed as caretaker manager in the interim period in June 2015.<ref>http://nonleague.pitchero.com/news/fuller-takes-interim-charge-at-daventry-40332/</ref>\n\nHowever, Humphrey would make a U-turn and return as chairman just a month later, in July 2015, replacing Smart and caretaker manager Fuller who both left the club altogether. His first move was to re-appoint former manager Darran Foster who had left the club in November 2014. Foster had only just been appointed manager at [[Woodford United F.C.|Woodford United]] in June 2015.<ref>http://nonleague.pitchero.com/news/foster-returns-to-daventry-41053/</ref>\n\nFoster resigned in April 2016 following a 5 0 home defeat to Kidsgrove Athletic.<ref>http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/daventrytown/news/manager-darran-foster-has-resigned-1587745.html/</ref>\n\nClub Goalkeeping Coach Derren Midson and the Club's Juniors Development Officer Pete Flockhart stepped in as Caretaker Managers with Brian Porter returning as Club Secretary to ensure the club somehow completed their remaining 6 fixtures of the 2015/2016 season.\n\nIn May 2016, Daventry Town resigned from the Northern Premier League due to financial problems and were later placed in the United Counties League Division One, step 9 of English football for the 2016/17 season. Ian Humphrey resigned and handed over full control to a New Executive Committee. Local businessman Steve Tubb took over as Chairman.<ref>http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/daventrytown/news/join-the-fun-1602939.html/</ref>\n\nIn May 2016, Woodford United Player Manager Arron Parkinson and Ex-Cogenhoe United Manager Andy Marks were confirmed as Joint Managers for season 2016-17.<ref>http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/daventrytown/news/new-management-pairing-in-at-town-1614238.html/</ref>\n\nIn April 2017, Daventry Town won the UCL Division One in their first season back at this level, going undefeated at home. They were promoted to the United Counties Premier Division.<ref>http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/daventrytown/teams/39062/match-centre/0-3374552/</ref>\n\nFollowing Andy Marks's decision to step down as Joint Manager, Ian King was appointed Joint Manager alongside Arron Parkinson.<ref>http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/daventrytown/news/town-appoint-arron-parkinson-and-ian-king-as-joint-1818164.html/</ref>\n\nIn May 2018, Daventry Town won the Buckingham Charity Cup beating Buckingham Athletic 2 0 in the final.<ref>http://sportsshots.org.uk/?p=34622/</ref>\n\nIn June 2018, Ian King resigned so he could find a position in the professional game. Arron Parkinson took on the role as Manager and appointed former Woodford United and AFC Rushden & Diamonds keeper Matt Finlay as his Assistant. Pete Harris joined as Coach and Andy Emery was announced as Reserve Team Manager.<ref>https://dtfc.co.uk/first-team-manager-arron-parkinson/</ref>\n\n2018/19 saw Arron Parkinson lead the club to the double by winning the UCL Premier Division and the UCL Knock Out Cup.

It is used for [[V/STOL]] operation. \n\nThe aircraft takes off using the fans to provide lift, then transitions to fixed-wing lift in forward flight. Several experimental craft have been flown, but only the [[F-35 Lightning II]] entered into production.\n\n\n\nThe Earth is falling apart and we're all going to die. Might as well hide even further into the house as if it'll help and eat up all the soup. It doesn't matter. None of it matters. Why would it? Our visit was going to be temporary anyway. The sun would blow up like a nuke and no one would know otherwise.\n\n==History==\n\nA number of experimental aircraft were evaluated in the USA during the late 1950s and throughout much of the 1960s.\n\nThe [[Avro Canada Avrocar]], commissioned by the USA, was intended to be a technology demonstrator for a supersonic VTOL aircraft. It featured a single central fan in a circular flying wing, with engine thrust directed rearwards for forward flight. It underwent trials between 1958 and 1961 but, due to its unstable \"flying saucer\" aerodynamics and lower than expected thrust, never flew out of ground effect. The [[Verticraft Verticar]] of 1961 was a similar single-fan, directed-thrust, all-wing (or lifting body) aircraft, of conventional but very low-aspect-ratio wing planform. It failed to fly. A tandem-fan version was proposed but never built.<ref name=\"retromech1\">[http://retromechanix.com/verticraft-tri-service-vtol-prototype-transport-aircraft/ Retro Mechanix] (retrieved 11 March 2014 )</ref> By contrast the [[Ryan XV-5 Vertifan]] of 1964 was an otherwise conventional delta-wing jet. It had a large fan in each wing and a third, smaller fan in the nose to provide balance in pitch. It was more successful, with one of the two prototypes flying until 1971.\n\nThe Vanguard C2 and C2D Omniplane had two fans side by side, with one in each wing. It underwent tethered trials between 1959 and 1962 but never flew untethered. In the late 1960s NASA conducted wind tunnel experiments on a series of larger aircraft designs using different numbers of fans in the wings.<ref name=\"nasa1\">[http://crgis.ndc.nasa.gov/historic/643_Test_290_-_Fan-in-Wing_%286_fan%29_Transport_Model_%28Newsom%29]</ref>\n\nBeginning with a one-sixth scale model in 1962, [[Paul Moller]] has been experimenting with the flying saucer configuration ever since. All have had a central cockpit but have varied between a single lift fan surrounding the cockpit, twin fans behind the cockpit or, more recently, eight individual fans distributed around it. Some examples such as the XM-2 of 1965 have been able to hover within ground effect. The [[artificial stability|artificially stabilised]] [[Moller M200G Volantor|M200X]] was re-engined in 1989 and can fly out of ground effect, but has not entered production.<ref>IFO picture library - [http://www.laesieworks.com/ifo/lib/moller.html Moller's Skycars]</ref>\n\nSeveral projects were announced in 2010 and 2011. The Ray passenger aircraft had four fans arranged approximately in a square, similarly to a [[quadrotor]], with a small fan in front of a larger one behind it in each wing.<ref name=\"rayreasearch\">[http://www.rayaircraft.com/ Ray Research]</ref><ref name=\"avweek-ray\">[http://www.aviationweek.com/Blogs.aspx?plckBlogId=Blog:a68cb417-3364-4fbf-a9dd-4feda680ec9c&plckPostId=Blog%3Aa68cb417-3364-4fbf-a9dd-4feda680ec9cPost%3Af63af11b-6e39-4240-a88d-f45218394ade On Fans and Wings - Switzerland's VTOL Ray], Aviation Week, 2010</ref><ref name=\"aerorevue-ray\">AeroRevue, \"Ray\" - new life for Vertical Takeoff Aircraft (English translation from German) [http://www.rayaircraft.com/docs/AeroRevue-RayAircraftEN.pdf]</ref>  The Lockheed Martin VARIOUS was a multi-role military UAV with twin fans side by side, one in each wing.<ref name=\"Lockheed Martin: VARIOUS\">[http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/various.html Lockheed Martin: VARIOUS]</ref><ref name=\"Lockheed VARIOUS UCAV concept\">[http://robotpig.net/robotics-news/lockheed-various-ucav-concept-with-video-_1920 Lockheed VARIOUS UCAV concept]</ref> The Northrop MUVR ship-to-shore resupply aircraft similarly had a fan in each wing.<ref name=\"avweek-muvr\">[http://www.aviationweek.com/Blogs.aspx?plckBlogId=blog:27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7&plckPostId=Blog:27ec4a53-dcc8-42d0-bd3a-01329aef79a7Post:23d9a838-d983-441f-871b-9f16def13c63 Wraps Off Northrop's Fan-in-Wing MUVR], Aviation Week, 2011</ref> \nUnlike these the Anglo-Italian [[AgustaWestland Project Zero]] hybrid tiltrotor/lift-fan unmanned technology demonstrator was actually built and flew successfully in 2011.

It is used for [[V/STOL]] operation. \n\nThe aircraft takes off using the fans to provide lift, then transitions to fixed-wing lift in forward flight. Several experimental craft have been flown, but only the [[F-35 Lightning II]] entered into production.\n\n==History==\n\nA number of experimental aircraft were evaluated in the USA during the late 1950s and throughout much of the 1960s.\n\nThe [[Avro Canada Avrocar]], commissioned by the USA, was intended to be a technology demonstrator for a supersonic VTOL aircraft. It featured a single central fan in a circular flying wing, with engine thrust directed rearwards for forward flight. It underwent trials between 1958 and 1961 but, due to its unstable \"flying saucer\" aerodynamics and lower than expected thrust, never flew out of ground effect. The [[Verticraft Verticar]] of 1961 was a similar single-fan, directed-thrust, all-wing (or lifting body) aircraft, of conventional but very low-aspect-ratio wing planform. It failed to fly. A tandem-fan version was proposed but never built.<ref name=\"retromech1\">[http://retromechanix.com/verticraft-tri-service-vtol-prototype-transport-aircraft/ Retro Mechanix] (retrieved 11 March 2014 )</ref> By contrast the [[Ryan XV-5 Vertifan]] of 1964 was an otherwise conventional delta-wing jet. It had a large fan in each wing and a third, smaller fan in the nose to provide balance in pitch. It was more successful, with one of the two prototypes flying until 1971.\n\nThe Vanguard C2 and C2D Omniplane had two fans side by side, with one in each wing. It underwent tethered trials between 1959 and 1962 but never flew untethered. In the late 1960s NASA conducted wind tunnel experiments on a series of larger aircraft designs using different numbers of fans in the wings.<ref name=\"nasa1\">[http://crgis.ndc.nasa.gov/historic/643_Test_290_-_Fan-in-Wing_%286_fan%29_Transport_Model_%28Newsom%29]</ref>\n\nBeginning with a one-sixth scale model in 1962, [[Paul Moller]] has been experimenting with the flying saucer configuration ever since. All have had a central cockpit but have varied between a single lift fan surrounding the cockpit, twin fans behind the cockpit or, more recently, eight individual fans distributed around it. Some examples such as the XM-2 of 1965 have been able to hover within ground effect. The [[artificial stability|artificially stabilised]] [[Moller M200G Volantor|M200X]] was re-engined in 1989 and can fly out of ground effect, but has not entered production.<ref>IFO picture library - [http://www.laesieworks.com/ifo/lib/moller.html Moller's Skycars]</ref>\n\nSeveral projects were announced in 2010 and 2011.

R. R. Tolkien]], '''Moria''' is an ancient subterranean complex in [[Middle-earth]], comprising a vast [[labyrinth]]ine network of tunnels, chambers, mines and halls under the [[Misty Mountains]], with doors on both the western and the eastern sides of the mountain range. Moria is introduced in Tolkien's novel ''[[The Hobbit]]'', and is a major scene of action in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\nIn much of [[History of Arda|Middle-earth's fictional history]], Moria was the kingdom of the [[Goblin (Middle-earth)|the Goblins]]. The city's wealth was founded on its mines, which produced ''[[mithril]]'', a fictional metal of great beauty and strength, suitable for armour. The Dwarves dug too deep, greedy for ''mithril'', and disturbed a demon of great power: [[Durin's Bane|a Balrog]], which destroyed their kingdom. By the end of the [[Third Age]], Moria had long been abandoned by the Dwarves, and was a place of evil repute. It was dark, in dangerous disrepair, and in its labyrinths lurked [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]] and the Balrog.\n\nScholars have identified likely sources for Tolkien's Moria: He had studied a Latin inscription about [[Ring of Silvianus|a lost ring]] at the temple of [[Nodens]] in Gloucestershire, at a place called Dwarf's Hill full of old mine-workings. The name Moria, Tolkien wrote, echoed the name of a castle in [[Norwegian Folktales|a Scandinavian folktale]], while Gandalf's death and reappearance reminded critics of the [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] and [[transfiguration of Jesus]]. The West Gate that crashes closed behind the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship]] recalled the [[Wandering Rocks]] of [[Greek mythology]], and [[Odysseus]]'s passage between the devouring [[Scylla]] and the whirlpool [[Charybdis]]. Finally, the Fellowship's entry into the darkness via the deadly lake by the West Gate, and its exit into the light via the beautiful Mirrormere, alongside Gandalf's death and reappearance, has been compared to a [[baptism]], a ceremony that combines a symbolic death and the gift of new life.\n\nMoria provided dramatic scenes in [[Peter Jackson]]'s film ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', inspired by [[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]]'s illustrations. Its multiple levels of tunnels and halls served, too, as the basis for a variety of computer and board games.\n\n==Names==\nTolkien uses [[Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien|his constructed languages]] for the names for Moria in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\n''Moria'' is by far the most common name of the place in Tolkien's writings. The name means \"the Black Chasm\" or \"the Black Pit\", from [[Sindarin]] ''mor'', \"dark, black\" and ''i\u00e2'', \"void, abyss, pit\".<ref>[http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Moria Etymology of \"Moria\".]</ref> The element ''mor'' had the sense \"sinister, evil\", especially by association with infamous names such as ''[[Morgoth]]'' and ''[[Mordor]]''; indeed Moria itself had an evil reputation by the times in which ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' are set.\n\nThe name ''Moria'' had (within the fiction) originally applied only to the Black Chasm itself. However, after the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] were forced to abandon Khazad-d\u00fbm, its many bright lamps were destroyed, and the whole subterranean complex was drowned in darkness: a veritable Black Pit. Tolkien [[#Concept and creation|borrowed the name ''Moria'']] itself, but not its meaning, from a book he had read.<ref group=T>J. R. R. Tolkien (1981), ''[[The Letters of J. R. R.

In the fictional history, ''Khazad-d\u00fbm'' was Moria's original name, given by the Dwarves in [[Khuzdul|their own language, ''Khuzdul'']]. It is translated as the Dwarrowdelf, ''dwarrow'' being an archaic English form of \"dwarf\", and ''delf'' an archaic alternative to \"delving\", from the verb \"delve\", to dig.

Three of the Misty Mountains' most massive peaks surrounded Dimrill Dale: the Mountains of Moria: ''Silvertine'' on the west; ''Redhorn'' on the north; and ''Cloudyhead'' on the east; or in [[Sindarin]] respectively ''Celebdil'', ''Caradhras'' and ''Fanuidhol''. Their [[Khuzd\u00fbl]] names, respectively ''Zirakzigil'', ''Barazinbar'' and ''Bundushath\u00fbr'', are mentioned by Gimli as the Fellowship nears Moria. The caves of Moria, where the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]] city-kingdom of Khazad-d\u00fbm was founded, were situated under Silvertine; their mouth overlooked Dimrill Dale, which contained many waterfalls and a long, oval lake that reflected stars even in daylight. Perceiving [[Durin's Crown|these stars]] as a crown glittering above his head, Durin took this as an auspicious sign, named the lake ''Kheled-z\u00e2ram'', the Mirrormere, and chose the eastward-facing caves above it for his new stronghold.<ref name=\"Lothl\u00f3rien\" group=T>{{harvnb|The Fellowship of the Ring|2002|loc=book 2, ch. 6 \"Lothl\u00f3rien\"}}</ref>\n\n====Geology====\n\nThe [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] excavated most of Khazad-d\u00fbm out of solid rock, leaving polished walls.<ref name=\"A Journey in the Dark\" group=T/> Minerals included [[gold]], [[gem]]s and [[iron ore]]. However the principal mineral was ''[[mithril]]'', a fabulously precious and versatile metal found nowhere else in Middle-earth. It was the source of Khazad-d\u00fbm's huge wealth, but ultimately [[#The Mines|its mining]] was the cause of its downfall. Beginning under the Silvertine, the Dwarves mined ever deeper, and down towards the roots of Mount Caradhras. There they unearthed the Balrog, which drove the Dwarves into exile.<ref name=\"A Journey in the Dark\" group=T/>\n\nFar below even the deepest mines of the Dwarves lay a primordial underworld of tunnels, [[Subterranean river|streams]] and [[Underground lake|lakes]] in perpetual darkness, inhabited by primitive creatures. The tunnels were \"gnawed by nameless things\" from the beginnings of [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]],<ref name=\"The White Rider\" group=T/> along with the [[Watcher in the Water]], which [[Gandalf]] suggested may have come from the underworld's waters.<ref name=\"A Journey in the Dark\" group=T/>\n\n===History===\nMoria was founded by [[Durin]] at the end of the [[Cosmology of Tolkien's legendarium#Stars|Ages of the Stars]]. During his reign, the precious metal mithril was discovered in the mines, and some of the major structures of Moria were built: Durin's Bridge, the Second Hall, the Endless Stair and Durin's Tower.

They reached the Chamber of Mazarbul, the ancient repository of documents holding [[Balin (Middle-earth)|Balin]]'s tomb and his colony's chronicle, the Book of Mazarbul.<ref name=\"A Journey in the Dark\" group=T/> They were attacked there by a [[Troll (Middle-earth)|Troll]] and many Orcs, before being approached by the Balrog.

R. R. Tolkien]], '''Moria''', also named '''Khazad-d\u00fbm''', is an ancient subterranean complex in [[Middle-earth]], comprising a vast [[labyrinth]]ine network of tunnels, chambers, mines and halls under the [[Misty Mountains]], with doors on both the western and the eastern sides of the mountain range. Moria is introduced in Tolkien's novel ''[[The Hobbit]]'', and is a major scene of action in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\nIn much of [[History of Arda|Middle-earth's fictional history]], Moria was the greatest city of [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|the Dwarves]]. The city's wealth was founded on its mines, which produced ''[[mithril]]'', a fictional metal of great beauty and strength, suitable for armour. The Dwarves dug too deep, greedy for ''mithril'', and disturbed a demon of great power: [[Durin's Bane|a Balrog]], which destroyed their kingdom. By the end of the [[Third Age]], Moria had long been abandoned by the Dwarves, and was a place of evil repute. It was dark, in dangerous disrepair, and in its labyrinths lurked [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]] and the Balrog.\n\nScholars have identified likely sources for Tolkien's Moria: He had studied a Latin inscription about [[Ring of Silvianus|a lost ring]] at the temple of [[Nodens]] in Gloucestershire, at a place called Dwarf's Hill full of old mine-workings. The name Moria, Tolkien wrote, echoed the name of a castle in [[Norwegian Folktales|a Scandinavian folktale]], while Gandalf's death and reappearance reminded critics of the [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] and [[transfiguration of Jesus]]. The West Gate that crashes closed behind the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship]] recalled the [[Wandering Rocks]] of [[Greek mythology]], and [[Odysseus]]'s passage between the devouring [[Scylla]] and the whirlpool [[Charybdis]]. Finally, the Fellowship's entry into the darkness via the deadly lake by the West Gate, and its exit into the light via the beautiful Mirrormere, alongside Gandalf's death and reappearance, has been compared to a [[baptism]], a ceremony that combines a symbolic death and the gift of new life.\n\nMoria provided dramatic scenes in [[Peter Jackson]]'s film ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', inspired by [[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]]'s illustrations. Its multiple levels of tunnels and halls served, too, as the basis for a variety of computer and board games.\n\n==Names==\nTolkien uses [[Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien|his constructed languages]] for the names for Moria in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\n''Moria'' is by far the most common name of the place in Tolkien's writings. The name means \"the Black Chasm\" or \"the Black Pit\", from [[Sindarin]] ''mor'', \"dark, black\" and ''i\u00e2'', \"void, abyss, pit\".<ref>[http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Moria Etymology of \"Moria\".]</ref> The element ''mor'' had the sense \"sinister, evil\", especially by association with infamous names such as ''[[Morgoth]]'' and ''[[Mordor]]''; indeed Moria itself had an evil reputation by the times in which ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' are set.\n\nThe name ''Moria'' had (within the fiction) originally applied only to the Black Chasm itself. However, after the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] were forced to abandon Khazad-d\u00fbm, its many bright lamps were destroyed, and the whole subterranean complex was drowned in darkness: a veritable Black Pit. Tolkien [[#Concept and creation|borrowed the name ''Moria'']] itself, but not its meaning, from a book he had read.<ref group=T>J. R. R. Tolkien (1981), ''[[The Letters of J. R. R.

In the fictional history, ''Khazad-d\u00fbm'' was Moria's original name, given by the Dwarves in [[Khuzdul|their own language, ''Khuzdul'']]. It is translated as the Dwarrowdelf, ''dwarrow'' being an archaic English form of \"dwarf\", and ''delf'' an archaic alternative to \"delving\", from the verb \"delve\", to dig.  Tolkien rhymes ''d\u00fbm'' with \"tomb\".<ref name=\"A Journey in the Dark\" group=T>{{harvnb|The Fellowship of the Ring|2002|loc=book 2, ch. 4 \"A Journey in the Dark\"}}</ref>\n\n==Tolkien's account==\n\n===Geography===\n[[File:Misty Mountain (59053312).jpeg|thumb|Mist on the [[Alps]]: Tolkien's experiences on his 1911 visit gave him the idea for difficulties crossing the Misty Mountains.<ref name=\"Letters #306\" group=T/>]]\n\nMoria was originally a system of natural caves located in Dimrill Dale, a valley on the eastern side of the Misty Mountains.

Three of the Misty Mountains' most massive peaks surrounded Dimrill Dale: the Mountains of Moria: ''Silvertine'' on the west; ''Redhorn'' on the north; and ''Cloudyhead'' on the east; or in [[Sindarin]] respectively ''Celebdil'', ''Caradhras'' and ''Fanuidhol''. Their [[Khuzd\u00fbl]] names, respectively ''Zirakzigil'', ''Barazinbar'' and ''Bundushath\u00fbr'', are mentioned by Gimli as the Fellowship nears Moria. The caves of Moria, where the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]] city-kingdom of Khazad-d\u00fbm was founded, were situated under Silvertine; their mouth overlooked Dimrill Dale, which contained many waterfalls and a long, oval lake that reflected stars even in daylight. Perceiving [[Durin's Crown|these stars]] as a crown glittering above his head, Durin took this as an auspicious sign, named the lake ''Kheled-z\u00e2ram'', the Mirrormere, and chose the eastward-facing caves above it for his new stronghold.<ref name=\"Lothl\u00f3rien\" group=T>{{harvnb|The Fellowship of the Ring|2002|loc=book 2, ch. 6 \"Lothl\u00f3rien\"}}</ref>\n\n====Geology====\n\nThe [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] excavated most of Khazad-d\u00fbm out of solid rock, leaving polished walls.<ref name=\"A Journey in the Dark\" group=T/> Minerals included [[gold]], [[gem]]s and [[iron ore]]. However the principal mineral was ''[[mithril]]'', a fabulously precious and versatile metal found nowhere else in Middle-earth. It was the source of Khazad-d\u00fbm's huge wealth, but ultimately [[#The Mines|its mining]] was the cause of its downfall. Beginning under the Silvertine, the Dwarves mined ever deeper, and down towards the roots of Mount Caradhras. There they unearthed the Balrog, which drove the Dwarves into exile.<ref name=\"A Journey in the Dark\" group=T/>\n\nFar below even the deepest mines of the Dwarves lay a primordial underworld of tunnels, [[Subterranean river|streams]] and [[Underground lake|lakes]] in perpetual darkness, inhabited by primitive creatures. The tunnels were \"gnawed by nameless things\" from the beginnings of [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]],<ref name=\"The White Rider\" group=T/> along with the [[Watcher in the Water]], which [[Gandalf]] suggested may have come from the underworld's waters.<ref name=\"A Journey in the Dark\" group=T/>\n\n===History===\nMoria was founded by [[Durin]] at the end of the [[Cosmology of Tolkien's legendarium#Stars|Ages of the Stars]]. During his reign, the precious metal mithril was discovered in the mines, and some of the major structures of Moria were built: Durin's Bridge, the Second Hall, the Endless Stair and Durin's Tower.

They reached the Chamber of Mazarbul, the ancient repository of documents holding [[Balin (Middle-earth)|Balin]]'s tomb and his colony's chronicle, the Book of Mazarbul.<ref name=\"A Journey in the Dark\" group=T/> They were attacked there by a [[Troll (Middle-earth)|Troll]] and many Orcs, before being approached by the Balrog.

They were however decorated with designs engraved in ''ithildin'' made by the elf-Lord Celebrimbor of Eregion and the dwarf Narvi from ''[[mithril]]'' mined in Moria. The designs included the emblems of Durin, the two trees of the High Elves, and the Star of the House of [[F\u00ebanor]]. Tolkien's drawing of the designs on the Doors of Durin was the only illustration in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' during his lifetime (other than cover-art and calligraphy). In moonlight, a password made the designs visible. The designs contained a second password to [[Open Sesame (phrase)#Classification|open the doors]]. When the Fellowship enter, the monstrous aquatic guardian of the gates slams the doors shut with its tentacles, plunging the Fellowship immediately into hellish darkness; the scholar of English literature Charles Huttar compares this \"clashing gate\" to the [[Wandering Rocks]] that in [[Greek mythology]] lie near the opening of the [[underworld]], [[Hades]], and to [[Odysseus]]'s passage between the devouring [[Scylla]] and the whirlpool [[Charybdis]].<ref name=\"Huttar 1975\">{{cite book |last=Huttar |first=Charles A. |editor-last=Lobdell |editor-first=Jared |title=Hell and the City: Tolkien and the Traditions of Western Literature |work=A Tolkien Compass |date=1975 |publisher=Open Court |isbn=978-0875483030 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/tolkiencompass00lobd/page/121 121\u2013122] |quote=Clearly Charybdis is yet another route to hell. |url=https://archive.org/details/tolkiencompass00lobd/page/121 }}</ref>{{-}}\n\n==Origins==\n\n===Nodens===\n[[File:Roman Temple - geograph.org.uk - 1318760.jpg|thumb|Tolkien visited the temple of [[Nodens]] at a place called \"Dwarf's Hill\" and translated an inscription with a [[curse]] upon a ring.

Howard Rollins was best known for his role as Andrew Young in 1978's ''[[King (TV miniseries)|King]]'', George Haley in the 1979 miniseries ''[[Roots: The Next Generations]]'', Coalhouse Walker Jr. in the 1981 film ''[[Ragtime (film)|Ragtime]]'', Captain Davenport in the 1984 film ''[[A Soldier's Story]]'', and as [[Virgil Tibbs]] on the TV crime drama ''[[In the Heat of the Night (TV series)|In the Heat of the Night]]'' . In the fall of 1996, Rollins was diagnosed with AIDS. Six weeks later, he died at St. Luke\u2019s-Roosevelt Hospital in New York at the age of 46, from complications from AIDS-related lymphoma. As was typical at the time, his publicist issued a statement claiming he suffered from lymphatic cancer, but it was later revealed by his family that Rollins had been diagnosed with AIDS. He was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in his native Baltimore.\n==Early life==\nRollins was the youngest of four children born to Ruth and Howard Ellsworth Rollins Sr. in [[Baltimore]], Maryland. His mother was a domestic worker, and father was a steelworker who died in 1980. After his high school graduation, Rollins studied theater at [[Towson University]].<ref name=eady>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20088797,00.html|title=Howard Rollins' Stalled Career Marches on with a Soldier's Story|last=Eady|first=Brenda |date=1984-10-01|magazine=People|accessdate=2008-06-06}}</ref><ref name=cerio>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20143105,00.html|title=Requiem for Mister Tibbs|last=Cerio|first=Gregory|date=December 23, 1996|publisher=people.com|accessdate=January 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nIn 1970, Rollins left college to play the role of \"Slick\" in the PBS [[soap opera]] ''Our Street''. In 1974, he moved to [[New York City]], where he appeared in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions of ''We Interrupt This Program (1975)'', ''The Mighty Gents'' (1978), and ''[[G. R.

The following year, he was nominated for a [[10th Daytime Emmy Awards|Daytime Emmy]] for his role on ''[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]''. In 1984, Rollins starred in director [[Norman Jewison]]'s film ''[[A Soldier's Story]]'' ,which led to his role as [[Virgil Tibbs]] on ''[[In the Heat of the Night (TV series)|In the Heat of the Night]]'', the television series based on Jewison's acclaimed [[In the Heat of the Night (film)|1967 film of the same name]].\n\n''In the Heat of the Night'' began airing on [[NBC]] in 1988.

As seen today,{{when|date=September 2019}} boiler explosions are of two kinds. One kind is a failure of the pressure parts of the [[steam]] and [[water]] sides. There can be many different causes, such as failure of the [[safety valve]], [[corrosion]] of critical parts of the boiler, or low water level. Corrosion along the edges of [[lap joint]]s was a common cause of early boiler explosions.\n\nThe second kind is a fuel/air explosion in the [[furnace]], which would more properly be termed a firebox explosion. Firebox explosions in solid-fuel-fired boilers are rare, but firebox explosions in gas or oil-fired boilers are still a potential hazard.\n\n== Causes of boiler explosions ==\n[[File:CrashCrushTx.jpg|thumb|right|The Crash at [[Crush, Texas]], 1896, in which the boilers of two locomotives crashed into one another for a publicity stunt exploded; two people died in the incident, and many more were injured.]]\nThere are many causes for boiler explosions such as poor water treatment causing scaling and over heating of the plates, low water level, a stuck safety valve, or even a furnace explosion that in turn, if severe enough, can cause a boiler explosion. Poor operator training resulting in neglect or other mishandling of the boiler has been a frequent cause of explosions since the beginning of the industrial revolution. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the inspection records of various sources in the U.S., UK, and Europe showed that the most frequent cause of boiler explosions was weakening of boilers through simple rusting, by anywhere from two to five times more than all other causes.\n\nBefore materials science, inspection standards, and quality control caught up with the rapidly growing boiler manufacturing industry, a significant number of boiler explosions were directly traceable to poor design, workmanship, and undetected flaws in poor quality materials. The alarming frequency of boiler failures in the U.S. due to defects in materials and design were attracting the attention of international engineering standards organizations, such as [https://www.asme.org/about-asme/engineering-history the ASME], which established their first Boiler Testing Code in 1884.  The boiler explosion that caused the [[Grover Shoe Factory disaster]] in Brockton, Massachusetts on March 10, 1905 resulted in 58 deaths and 117 injuries, and inspired the state of Massachusetts to publish its first boiler laws in 1908.\n\nSeveral written sources provide a concise description of the causes of boiler explosions:\n\n<blockquote>\"The principal causes of explosions, in fact the only causes, are deficiency of strength in the shell or other parts of the boilers, over-pressure and over-heating. Deficiency of strength in steam boilers may be due to original defects, bad workmanship, deterioration from use or mismanagement.\"''<ref>Roper, Stephen (1899). ''Roper's Engineer's Handy Book'' (15th edition) Philadelphia: David McKay (p.207\u2013208)</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnd:\n\n<blockquote>\"Cause.-Boiler explosions are always due to the fact that some part of the boiler is, for some reason, too weak to withstand the pressure to which it is subjected. This may be due to one of two causes: Either the boiler is not strong enough to safely carry its proper working pressure, or else the pressure has been allowed to rise above the usual point by the sticking of the safety valves, or some similar cause\"''<ref>The Colliery Engineers Company (1900) ''Locomotive Boilers'' (I.C.S. Reference Library #59) Statione's Hall, London: International Textbook Company</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Early investigations into the causes of boiler explosions ==\nWhile deterioration and mishandling are probably the most common ''causes'' of boiler explosions, the actual ''mechanism'' of a catastrophic boiler failure was not well documented until extensive experimentation was undertaken by U.S. boiler inspectors in the early 20th century. Several different attempts were made to cause a boiler to explode by various means, but one of the most interesting experiments demonstrated that in certain circumstances, if a sudden opening in the boiler allowed steam to escape too rapidly, [[water hammer]] could cause destruction of the entire pressure vessel:\n\n<blockquote>\"A cylindrical boiler was tested and withstood a steam pressure of 300 pounds without injury.\" \" When the [discharge] valve was suddenly opened at a pressure of 235 pounds [{{cvt|235|psi|disp=or||}}] the boiler gave way, the iron being twisted and torn into fragments and thrown in all directions. The reason for this was that the sudden rush of steam from the boiler into the discharge pipe reduced the pressure in the boiler very rapidly. This reduction of pressure caused the sudden formation of a great quantity of steam within the water, and the heavy mass of water being thrown with great violence toward the opening whence the steam was being withdrawn, struck the portions of the boiler near that opening and caused the fracture.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Colliery Engineers Company \u2013 Locomotive Boilers (I.C.S. Reference Library #59)|last=|first=|publisher=Stationer's Hall, London: International Textbook Company|year=1900|isbn=|location=|pages=(Sec.12-p.76)}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBut the highly destructive mechanism of [[water hammer]] in boiler explosions was understood long before then, as D. K. Clark wrote on 10th February, 1860, in a letter to the editors of \"Mechanics Magazine\":<blockquote>\"The sudden dispersion and projection of the water in the boiler against the bounding surfaces of the boiler is the great cause of the violence of the results: the dispersion, being caused by the momentary generation of steam throughout the mass of the water, and in its efforts to escape, it carries the water before it, and the combined momentum of the steam and the water carries them like shot through and amongst the bounding surfaces, and deforms or shatters them in a manner not to be accounted for by simple overpressure or by simple momentum of steam.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Steam boiler explosions|last=Colburn, Zerah, 1832-1870.|date=1873|publisher=D. Van Nostrand|oclc=4741077}}</ref></blockquote>Boiler explosions are common in sinking ships once the superheated boiler touches cold sea water, as the sudden cooling of the superheated metal causes it to crack; for instance, when the {{SS|Benlomond|1922|6}} was torpedoed by a U-boat, the torpedoes and resulting boiler explosion caused the ship to go down in two minutes, leaving [[Poon Lim]] as the only survivor in a complement of 54 crew.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uboat.net/allies/merchants/2462.html|title=Benlomond (British Steam merchant) \u2013 Ships hit by German U-boats during WWII \u2013 uboat.net|website=uboat.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~judkins/survival.htm|title=Miracle Survival \u2013 Poon Lim|first=George|last=Judkins|website=freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com}}</ref>\n\n== Locomotive-type boiler explosions ==\nBoiler explosions are of a particular danger in (locomotive-type) [[fire-tube boiler|fire tube boilers]] because the top of the firebox (crown sheet) must be covered with some amount of water at all times; or the heat of the fire can weaken the crown sheet or crown [[Boiler stay|stays]] to the point of failure, ''even at normal working pressure''.\n\nThis was the cause of the Gettysburg Railroad firebox explosion<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntsb.gov/safety/safety-studies/Documents/SIR9605.pdf|title=STEAM LOCOMOTIVE FIREBOX EXPLOSION ON THE GETTYSBURG RAILROAD NEAR GARDNERS, PENNSYLVANIA JUNE 16, 1995|last=NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD}}</ref> near Gardners, Pennsylvania, in 1995, where low water allowed the front of the crown sheet to overheat until the regular crown stays pulled through the sheet, releasing a great deal of steam and water under full boiler pressure into the firebox. The crown sheet design included several alternating rows of button-head safety stays, which limited the failure of the crown sheet to the first five or six rows of conventional stays, preventing a collapse of the entire crown sheet.\n\nThis type of failure is not limited to railway engines, as locomotive-type boilers have been used for traction engines, portable engines, skid engines used for mining or logging, stationary engines for sawmills and factories, for heating, and as [[package boiler]]s providing steam for other processes. In all applications, maintaining the proper water level is essential for safe operation.\n\n== Principle ==\nMany shell-type boilers carry a large bath of liquid water which is heated to a higher temperature and pressure ([[enthalpy]]) than boiling water would be at atmospheric pressure. During normal operation, the liquid water remains in the bottom of the boiler due to gravity, steam bubbles rise through the liquid water and collect at the top for use until saturation pressure is reached, then the boiling stops. If some pressure is released, boiling begins again, and so on.\n\nIf steam is released normally, say by opening a throttle valve, the bubbling action of the water remains moderate and relatively dry steam can be drawn from the highest point in the vessel.\n\nIf steam is released more quickly, the more vigorous boiling action that results can throw a fine spray of droplets up as \"wet steam\" which can cause damage to piping, engines, turbines and other equipment downstream.\n\nIf a large crack or other opening in the boiler vessel allows the internal pressure to drop very suddenly, the heat energy remaining in the water will cause even more of the liquid to flash into steam bubbles, which then rapidly displace the remaining liquid. The potential energy of the escaping steam and water are now transformed into work, just as they would have done in an engine; with enough force to peel back the material around the break, severely distorting the shape of the plate which was formerly held in place by stays, or self-supported by its original cylindrical shape. The rapid release of steam and water can provide a very potent blast, and cause great damage to surrounding property or personnel.\n\nThe rapidly expanding steam bubbles can also perform work by throwing large \"slugs\" of water inside the boiler in the direction of the opening, and at astonishing velocities. A fast-moving mass of water carries a great deal of kinetic energy (from the expanding steam), and in collision with the shell of the boiler results in a violent destructive effect. This can greatly enlarge the original rupture, or tear the shell in two.<ref>The Colliery Engineers Company (1900) Locomotive Boilers (I.C.S. Reference Library #59) Stationer's Hall, London: International Textbook Company (sec.12,p.76)</ref>\n\nMany plumbers, firefighters, and  [[steamfitter]]s are aware of this phenomenon, which is called  \"[[water hammer]]\". A several-ounce \"slug\" of water passing through a steam line at high velocity and striking a 90-degree elbow can instantly fracture a fitting that is otherwise capable of handling several times the normal static pressure. It can then be understood that a few hundred, or even a few thousand pounds of water ''moving at the same velocity'' inside a boiler shell can easily blow out a tube sheet, collapse a firebox, even toss the entire boiler a surprising distance through reaction as the water exits the boiler, like the [[recoil]] of a heavy cannon firing a ball.\n\nSeveral accounts of the [[SL-1]] [[SL-1|experimental reactor accident]] vividly describe the incredibly powerful effect of water hammer on a pressure vessel: <blockquote>\"The expansion caused by this heating process caused water hammer as water was accelerated upwards toward the reactor vessel head, producing approximately 10,000 pounds per square inch (69,000 kPa) of pressure on the head of the reactor vessel when water struck the head at 160 feet per second (50&nbsp;m/s) ...This extreme form of water hammer propelled control rods, shield plugs, and the entire reactor vessel upward. A later investigation concluded that the 26,000-pound (12,000&nbsp;kg) vessel had jumped 9 feet 1 inch (2.77 m) and the upper control rod drive mechanisms had struck the ceiling of the reactor building prior to settling back into its original location\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.id.energy.gov/Foia/PDF/IDO-19313.pdf|title=IDO-19313 \"ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE SL-1 EXCURSION\" November 12, 1962. Flight Propulsion Laboratory Department, General Electric Company, Idaho Falls, Idaho.}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nA steam locomotive operating at {{cvt|350|psi|||}} would have a temperature of about {{convert|225|C|||}}, and a specific enthalpy of {{cvt|963.7|kJ/kg|kJ/lb||}}.<ref>Milo D. Koretsky, \u201cEngineering and Chemical Thermodynamics\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, 2004,  p. 508</ref> Since standard pressure saturated water has a specific enthalpy of just {{cvt|418.91|kJ/kg|kJ/lb||}},<ref>Milo D. Koretsky, \u201cEngineering and Chemical Thermodynamics\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, 2004,  p. 509</ref> the difference between the two specific enthalpies, {{cvt|544.8|kJ/kg|kJ/lb||}}, is the total energy expended in the explosion. So in the case of a large locomotive which can hold as much as {{cvt|10000|kg|||}} of water at a high pressure and temperature state, this explosion would have an theoretical energy release equal to about {{convert|1160|kg|||}} of [[TNT equivalent|TNT]].\n\n== Firebox explosions ==\nIn the case of a [[Firebox (steam engine)|firebox]] explosion, these typically occur after a burner [[flameout]]. Oil fumes, natural gas, propane, coal, or any other fuel can build up inside the combustion chamber. This is especially of concern when the vessel is hot; the fuels will rapidly volatize due to the temperature. Once the [[lower explosive limit]] (LEL) is reached, any source of ignition will cause an explosion of the vapors.\n\nA fuel explosion within the confines of the firebox may damage the pressurized boiler tubes and interior shell, potentially triggering structural failure, steam or water leakage, and/or a secondary boiler shell failure and [[steam explosion]].\n\nA common form of minor firebox \"explosion\" is known as \"drumming\" and can occur with any type of fuel. Instead of the normal \"roar\" of the fire, a rhythmic series of \"thumps\" and flashes of fire below the grate and through the [[firedoor]] indicate that the combustion of the fuel is proceeding through a rapid series of detonations, caused by an inappropriate air/fuel mixture with regard to the level of draft available. This usually causes no damage in locomotive type boilers, but can cause cracks in masonry boiler settings if allowed to continue.\n\n=== Grooving ===\nThe plates of early locomotive boilers were joined by simple [[lap joint|overlapping joints]]. This practice was satisfactory for the annular joints, running around the boiler, but in longitudinal joints, along the length of the boiler, the overlap of the plates diverted the boiler cross-section from its ideal circular shape. Under pressure the boiler strained to reach, as nearly as possible, the circular cross-section. Because the double-thickness overlap was stronger than the surrounding metal, the repeated bending and release caused by the variations in boiler pressure caused internal cracks, or grooves (deep pitting), along the length of the joint. The cracks offered a starting point for internal corrosion, which could hasten failure.<ref>Hewison (1983: 59 et sec)</ref> It was eventually found that this internal corrosion could be reduced by using plates of sufficient size so that no joints were situated below the water level.<ref name= CHH15>Hewison (1983: 15)</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Baldwin|first=Thomas|date=1 October 1867|title=On single and double riveted joints|journal=Transactions for 1866|publisher=[[Society of Engineers UK|Society of Engineers]]|location=London|page=150}}</ref> Eventually the simple lap seam was replaced by the single or double butt-strap seams, which do not suffer from this defect.\n\nDue to the constant expansion and contraction of the firebox a similar form of \"stress corrosion\" can take place at the ends of staybolts where they enter the firebox plates, and is accelerated by poor water quality.  Often referred to as [https://www.dli.mn.gov/sites/default/files/image016.jpg \"necking\"], this type of corrosion can reduce the strength of the staybolts until they are incapable of supporting the firebox at normal pressure.\n\nGrooving (deep, localized pitting) also occurs near the waterline, particularly in boilers that are fed with water that has not been de-aerated or treated with oxygen scavenging agents. All \"natural\" sources of water contain dissolved air, which is released as a gas when the water is heated. The air (which contains oxygen) collects in a layer near the surface of the water and greatly accelerates corrosion of the boiler plates in that area.<ref>Graham, Frank D. (1945) \"Audel's Power Plant Engineers guide\" New York, Ny: Theo Audel and Co. (p.332-333, figure 55: \"corrosion along the water line due to air\")</ref>\n\n=== Firebox ===\nThe intricate shape of a locomotive firebox, whether made of soft copper or of steel, can only resist the  steam pressure on its internal walls  if these are supported by [[Firebox (steam engine)#Sheets and stays|stays]] attached to internal girders and the outer walls. They are liable to fail through [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] (because the inner and outer walls expand at different rates under the heat of the fire), from corrosion, or from wasting as  the heads of the  stays exposed to the fire are burned away. If the stays fail the firebox will explode inwards. Regular visual inspection, internally and externally, is employed to prevent this.<ref name=\"CHH15\" /><ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=A Morton|title=Locomotives|volume=1|year=1950|publisher=Virtue|location=London|pages=20\u201323|oclc=499543971}}</ref> Even a well-maintained firebox will fail explosively if the water level in the boiler is allowed to fall far enough to leave the top plate of the firebox uncovered.<ref name=\"BTCenginemen\">{{cite book\n  |last=Staff\n  |title=Handbook for railway steam locomotive enginemen\n  |publisher=[[British Transport Commission]]\n  |location=London\n  |year=1957\n  |page=53\n  |chapter=The Boiler: Boiler Mountings and Details\n}}</ref> This can occur when crossing the summit of the hill, as the water flows to the front part of the boiler and can expose the firebox crown sheet.

Of the 450 passengers on board more than 250 died, including Henry Clemens, the younger brother of the author [[Mark Twain]].\n\n[[SS Ada Hancock]], a small [[steamboat]] used to transfer passengers and cargo to and from the large coastal [[steamship]]s that stopped in [[San Pedro Harbor]] in the early 1860s, suffered disaster when its boiler exploded violently in [[San Pedro Bay (California)|San Pedro Bay]], the port of [[Los Angeles]], near [[Wilmington, California]] on April 27, 1863 killing twenty-six people and injuring many others of the fifty-three or more passengers on board.\n\nThe [[Sultana (steamboat)|steamboat ''Sultana'']] was destroyed in an explosion on 27 April 1865, resulting in the greatest maritime disaster in [[United States]] history.  An estimated 1,549 passengers were killed when three of the ship's four boilers exploded and the ''Sultana'' burned and sank not far from [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. The cause was traced to a poorly executed repair to the shell of one boiler; the patch failed, and debris from that boiler ruptured two more.\n\nAnother US Civil War Steamboat explosion was the Steamer ''Eclipse'' on January 27, 1865, which was carrying members of the [[9th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery|9th Indiana Artillery]].

One of the first investigators of the problem was [[William Fairbairn]], who helped establish the first insurance company dealing with the losses such explosions could cause. He also established experimentally that the [[hoop stress]] in a cylindrical pressure vessel like a boiler was twice the [[longitudinal stress]].<ref group=\"notes\">[[William Fairbairn|Fairbairn]]'s theoretical calculation assumes that the cylindrical vessel is much longer than its diameter. In practice, this is a viable approximation for any boiler that is a [[right cylinder]] or longer. Even for a short, squat boiler such as the [[Scotch marine boiler|Scotch]], the reduced end area due to the tubes and their staying effect on the end-plates means that the principal stress is still this hoop stress.</ref> Such investigations helped him and others explain the importance of [[stress concentration]]s in weakening boilers.\n\n== Modern boilers ==\nModern boilers are designed with redundant pumps, valves, water level monitors, fuel cutoffs, automated controls, and pressure [[relief valves]]. In addition, the construction must adhere to strict engineering guidelines set by the relevant authorities. The [[National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors#National Board Inspection Code|NBIC]], [[ASME]], and others attempt to ensure safe boiler designs by publishing detailed standards. The result is a boiler unit which is less prone to catastrophic accidents.\n\nAlso improving safety is the increasing use of \"package boilers.\" These are boilers which are built at a factory then shipped out as a complete unit to the job site.  These typically have better quality and fewer issues than boilers which are site assembled tube-by-tube. A package boiler only needs the final connections to be made (electrical, breaching, condensate lines, etc.) to complete the installation.\n\n== Steam explosions ==\nIn [[steam locomotive]] boilers, as knowledge was gained by [[trial and error]] in early days, the explosive situations and consequent damage due to explosions were inevitable. However, improved design and [[Fire-tube boiler#Maintenance|maintenance]] markedly reduced the number of boiler explosions by the end of the 19th century.  Further improvements continued in the 20th century.\n\nOn land-based boilers, explosions of the pressure systems happened regularly in stationary steam boilers in the [[Victorian era]], but are now very rare because of the various [[Safety|protections]] provided, and because of regular inspections compelled by [[governmental]] and industry requirements.\n\n{{See also|List of boiler explosions}}\n\n[[Water heating|Water heaters]] can [[MythBusters (2009 season)#Exploding Water Heater|explode with surprising violence]] when their safety devices fail.\n\n=== Reactor explosions ===\nA steam explosion can occur in any kind of a water heater, where a sufficient amount of energy is delivered and the steam created exceeds the strength of the vessel. When the heat delivery is sufficiently rapid, a localized superheating can occur, resulting in a water hammer destroying the vessel. The [[SL-1]] nuclear reactor accident is an example of a superheated burst of steam.  However, in the SL1 example the pressure was released by the forced ejection of control rods which allowed the steam to be vented.  The reactor did not explode, nor did the vessel rupture.\n\n== Locomotive boiler explosions in the UK ==\n[[File:Boiler explosion 1850.jpg|thumb|Aftermath of a boiler explosion on a railway locomotive circa 1850.]]\nHewison (1983)<ref>[[#Hewison, Locomotive Boiler Explosions|Hewison, Locomotive Boiler Explosions]]</ref> gives a comprehensive account of British boiler explosions, listing 137 between 1815 and 1962.  It is noteworthy that 122 of these were in the 19th century and only 15 in the 20th century.\n\nBoiler explosions generally fell into two categories.  The first is the breakage of the boiler barrel itself, through weakness/damage or excessive internal pressure, resulting in sudden discharge of steam over a wide area. [[Stress corrosion cracking]] at the [[lap joint]]s was a common cause of early boiler explosions, probably caused by [[caustic embrittlement]]. The water used in boilers was not often closely controlled, and if acidic, could corrode the [[wrought iron]] boiler plates. [[Galvanic corrosion]] was an additional problem where [[copper]] and iron were in contact.\nBoiler plates have been thrown up to a quarter of a mile (Hewison, Rolt). The second type is the collapse of the firebox under steam pressure from the adjoining boiler, releasing flames and hot gases into the cab. Improved design and maintenance almost totally eliminated the first type, but the second type is always possible if the engineer and fireman do not maintain the water level in the boiler.\n\nBoiler barrels could explode if the internal pressure became too high.  To prevent this, safety valves were installed to release the pressure at a set level. Early examples were spring-loaded, but [[John Ramsbottom (engineer)|John Ramsbottom]] invented a tamper-proof valve which was universally adopted. The other common cause of explosions was internal [[corrosion]] which weakened the boiler barrel so that it could not withstand normal operating pressure. In particular, grooves could occur along horizontal seams (lap joints) below water level. Dozens of explosions resulted, but were eliminated by 1900 by the adoption of butt joints, plus improved maintenance schedules and regular hydraulic testing.\n\nFireboxes were generally made of [[copper]], though later locomotives had [[steel]] fireboxes.  They were held to the outer part of the boiler by stays (numerous small supports).  Parts of the firebox in contact with full steam pressure have to be kept covered with water, to stop them overheating and weakening.  The usual cause of firebox collapses is that the boiler water level falls too low and the top of the firebox (crown sheet) becomes uncovered and overheats.  This occurs if the fireman has failed to maintain water level or the level indicator (gauge glass) is faulty.  A less common reason is breakage of large numbers of stays, due to corrosion or unsuitable material.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, two boiler barrel failures and thirteen firebox collapses occurred in the UK. The boiler barrel failures occurred at Cardiff in 1909 and Buxton in 1921; both were caused by misassembly of the [[safety valve]]s causing the boilers to exceed their design pressures. Of the 13 firebox collapses, four were due to broken stays, one to scale buildup on the firebox, and the rest were due to low water level.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Steam explosion]]\n* [[Boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion|Boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE)]]\n* [[Fire-tube boiler#Safety considerations|Boiler safety]]\n* [[Fusible plug]]\n* [[Grover Shoe Factory disaster]]\n* [[List of boiler explosions]]\n* [[Lists of rail accidents]]\n* [[William Fairbairn]]\n* [[John Hick (MP)|John Hick]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=notes}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite book\n  | first=Christian H. | last=Hewison\n  | year=1983\n  | title=Locomotive Boiler Explosions\n  | publisher=David and Charles\n  | isbn=0-7153-8305-1\n  |ref=Hewison, Locomotive Boiler Explosions\n}}\n* {{cite book\n  | first=L.T.C. | last=Rolt\n  | authorlink=\n  | date=1956 (and later editions)\n  | title=Red for Danger\n  | edition=\n  | publisher= Bodley Head / David and Charles / Pan Books\n}}\n* {{cite book\n  | first=Alan | last=McEwen\n  | year=2009\n  | title=Historic Steam Boiler Explosions\n  | publisher=Sledgehammer Engineering Press\n  | isbn=978-0-9532725-2-5\n  |ref=McEwen, Historic Steam Boiler Explosions\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Bartrip, P.W.J.

As seen today,{{when|date=September 2019}} boiler explosions are of two kinds. One kind is a failure of the pressure parts of the [[steam]] and [[water]] sides. There can be many different causes, such as failure of the [[safety valve]], [[corrosion]] of critical parts of the boiler, or low water level. Corrosion along the edges of [[lap joint]]s was a common cause of early boiler explosions.\n\nThe second kind is a fuel/air explosion in the [[furnace]], which would more properly be termed a firebox explosion. Firebox explosions in solid-fuel-fired boilers are rare, but firebox explosions in gas or oil-fired boilers are still a potential hazard.\n\n== Causes of boiler explosions ==\n[[File:CrashCrushTx.jpg|thumb|right|The Crash at [[Crush, Texas]], 1896, in which the boilers of two locomotives crashed into one another for a publicity stunt exploded; two people died in the incident, and many more were injured.]]\nThere are many causes for boiler explosions such as poor water treatment causing scaling and over heating of the plates, low water level, a stuck safety valve, or even a furnace explosion that in turn, if severe enough, can cause a boiler explosion. Poor operator training resulting in neglect or other mishandling of the boiler has been a frequent cause of explosions since the beginning of the industrial revolution. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the inspection records of various sources in the U.S., UK, and Europe showed that the most frequent cause of boiler explosions was weakening of boilers through simple rusting, by anywhere from two to five times more than all other causes.\n\nBefore materials science, inspection standards, and quality control caught up with the rapidly growing boiler manufacturing industry, a significant number of boiler explosions were directly traceable to poor design, workmanship, and undetected flaws in poor quality materials. The alarming frequency of boiler failures in the U.S. due to defects in materials and design were attracting the attention of international engineering standards organizations, such as [https://www.asme.org/about-asme/engineering-history the ASME], which established their first Boiler Testing Code in 1884.  The boiler explosion that caused the [[Grover Shoe Factory disaster]] in Brockton, Massachusetts on March 10, 1905 resulted in 58 deaths and 117 injuries, and inspired the state of Massachusetts to publish its first boiler laws in 1908.\n\nSeveral written sources provide a concise description of the causes of boiler explosions:\n\n<blockquote>\"The principal causes of explosions, in fact the only causes, are deficiency of strength in the shell or other parts of the boilers, over-pressure and over-heating. Deficiency of strength in steam boilers may be due to original defects, bad workmanship, deterioration from use or mismanagement.\"''<ref>Roper, Stephen (1899). ''Roper's Engineer's Handy Book'' (15th edition) Philadelphia: David McKay (p.207\u2013208)</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnd:\n\n<blockquote>\"Cause.-Boiler explosions are always due to the fact that some part of the boiler is, for some reason, too weak to withstand the pressure to which it is subjected. This may be due to one of two causes: Either the boiler is not strong enough to safely carry its proper working pressure, or else the pressure has been allowed to rise above the usual point by the sticking of the safety valves, or some similar cause\"''<ref>The Colliery Engineers Company (1900) ''Locomotive Boilers'' (I.C.S. Reference Library #59) Statione's Hall, London: International Textbook Company</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Early investigations into the causes of boiler explosions ==\nWhile deterioration and mishandling are probably the most common ''causes'' of boiler explosions, the actual ''mechanism'' of a catastrophic boiler failure was not well documented until extensive experimentation was undertaken by U.S. boiler inspectors in the early 20th century. Several different attempts were made to cause a boiler to explode by various means, but one of the most interesting experiments demonstrated that in certain circumstances, if a sudden opening in the boiler allowed steam to escape too rapidly, [[water hammer]] could cause destruction of the entire pressure vessel:\n\n<blockquote>\"A cylindrical boiler was tested and withstood a steam pressure of 300 pounds without injury.\" \" When the [discharge] valve was suddenly opened at a pressure of 235 pounds [{{cvt|235|psi|disp=or||}}] the boiler gave way, the iron being twisted and torn into fragments and thrown in all directions. The reason for this was that the sudden rush of steam from the boiler into the discharge pipe reduced the pressure in the boiler very rapidly. This reduction of pressure caused the sudden formation of a great quantity of steam within the water, and the heavy mass of water being thrown with great violence toward the opening whence the steam was being withdrawn, struck the portions of the boiler near that opening and caused the fracture.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Colliery Engineers Company \u2013 Locomotive Boilers (I.C.S. Reference Library #59)|last=|first=|publisher=Stationer's Hall, London: International Textbook Company|year=1900|isbn=|location=|pages=(Sec.12-p.76)}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBut the highly destructive mechanism of [[water hammer]] in boiler explosions was understood long before then, as D. K. Clark wrote on 10th February, 1860, in a letter to the editors of \"Mechanics Magazine\":<blockquote>\"The sudden dispersion and projection of the water in the boiler against the bounding surfaces of the boiler is the great cause of the violence of the results: the dispersion, being caused by the momentary generation of steam throughout the mass of the water, and in its efforts to escape, it carries the water before it, and the combined momentum of the steam and the water carries them like shot through and amongst the bounding surfaces, and deforms or shatters them in a manner not to be accounted for by simple overpressure or by simple momentum of steam.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Steam boiler explosions|last=Colburn, Zerah, 1832-1870.|date=1873|publisher=D. Van Nostrand|oclc=4741077}}</ref></blockquote>Boiler explosions are common in sinking ships once the superheated boiler touches cold sea water, as the sudden cooling of the superheated metal causes it to crack; for instance, when the {{SS|Benlomond|1922|6}} was torpedoed by a U-boat, the torpedoes and resulting boiler explosion caused the ship to go down in two minutes, leaving [[Poon Lim]] as the only survivor in a complement of 54 crew.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uboat.net/allies/merchants/2462.html|title=Benlomond (British Steam merchant) \u2013 Ships hit by German U-boats during WWII \u2013 uboat.net|website=uboat.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~judkins/survival.htm|title=Miracle Survival \u2013 Poon Lim|first=George|last=Judkins|website=freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com}}</ref>\n\n== Locomotive-type boiler explosions ==\nBoiler explosions are of a particular danger in (locomotive-type) [[fire-tube boiler|fire tube boilers]] because the top of the firebox (crown sheet) must be covered with some amount of water at all times; or the heat of the fire can weaken the crown sheet or crown [[Boiler stay|stays]] to the point of failure, ''even at normal working pressure''.\n\nThis was the cause of the Gettysburg Railroad firebox explosion<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntsb.gov/safety/safety-studies/Documents/SIR9605.pdf|title=STEAM LOCOMOTIVE FIREBOX EXPLOSION ON THE GETTYSBURG RAILROAD NEAR GARDNERS, PENNSYLVANIA JUNE 16, 1995|last=NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD}}</ref> near Gardners, Pennsylvania, in 1995, where low water allowed the front of the crown sheet to overheat until the regular crown stays pulled through the sheet, releasing a great deal of steam and water under full boiler pressure into the firebox. The crown sheet design included several alternating rows of button-head safety stays, which limited the failure of the crown sheet to the first five or six rows of conventional stays, preventing a collapse of the entire crown sheet.\n\nThis type of failure is not limited to railway engines, as locomotive-type boilers have been used for traction engines, portable engines, skid engines used for mining or logging, stationary engines for sawmills and factories, for heating, and as [[package boiler]]s providing steam for other processes. In all applications, maintaining the proper water level is essential for safe operation.\n\n== Principle ==\nMany shell-type boilers carry a large bath of liquid water which is heated to a higher temperature and pressure ([[enthalpy]]) than boiling water would be at atmospheric pressure. During normal operation, the liquid water remains in the bottom of the boiler due to gravity, steam bubbles rise through the liquid water and collect at the top for use until saturation pressure is reached, then the boiling stops. If some pressure is released, boiling begins again, and so on.\n\nIf steam is released normally, say by opening a throttle valve, the bubbling action of the water remains moderate and relatively dry steam can be drawn from the highest point in the vessel.\n\nIf steam is released more quickly, the more vigorous boiling action that results can throw a fine spray of droplets up as \"wet steam\" which can cause damage to piping, engines, turbines and other equipment downstream.\n\nIf a large crack or other opening in the boiler vessel allows the internal pressure to drop very suddenly, the heat energy remaining in the water will cause even more of the liquid to flash into steam bubbles, which then rapidly displace the remaining liquid. The potential energy of the escaping steam and water are now transformed into work, just as they would have done in an engine; with enough force to peel back the material around the break, severely distorting the shape of the plate which was formerly held in place by stays, or self-supported by its original cylindrical shape. The rapid release of steam and water can provide a very potent blast, and cause great damage to surrounding property or personnel.\n\nThe rapidly expanding steam bubbles can also perform work by throwing large \"slugs\" of water inside the boiler in the direction of the opening, and at astonishing velocities. A fast-moving mass of water carries a great deal of kinetic energy (from the expanding steam), and in collision with the shell of the boiler results in a violent destructive effect. This can greatly enlarge the original rupture, or tear the shell in two.<ref>The Colliery Engineers Company (1900) Locomotive Boilers (I.C.S. Reference Library #59) Stationer's Hall, London: International Textbook Company (sec.12,p.76)</ref>\n\nMany plumbers, firefighters, and  [[steamfitter]]s are aware of this phenomenon, which is called  \"[[water hammer]]\". A several-ounce \"slug\" of water passing through a steam line at high velocity and striking a 90-degree elbow can instantly fracture a fitting that is otherwise capable of handling several times the normal static pressure. It can then be understood that a few hundred, or even a few thousand pounds of water ''moving at the same velocity'' inside a boiler shell can easily blow out a tube sheet, collapse a firebox, even toss the entire boiler a surprising distance through reaction as the water exits the boiler, like the [[recoil]] of a heavy cannon firing a ball.\n\nSeveral accounts of the [[SL-1]] [[SL-1|experimental reactor accident]] vividly describe the incredibly powerful effect of water hammer on a pressure vessel: <blockquote>\"The expansion caused by this heating process caused water hammer as water was accelerated upwards toward the reactor vessel head, producing approximately 10,000 pounds per square inch (69,000 kPa) of pressure on the head of the reactor vessel when water struck the head at 160 feet per second (50&nbsp;m/s) ...This extreme form of water hammer propelled control rods, shield plugs, and the entire reactor vessel upward. A later investigation concluded that the 26,000-pound (12,000&nbsp;kg) vessel had jumped 9 feet 1 inch (2.77 m) and the upper control rod drive mechanisms had struck the ceiling of the reactor building prior to settling back into its original location\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.id.energy.gov/Foia/PDF/IDO-19313.pdf|title=IDO-19313 \"ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE SL-1 EXCURSION\" November 12, 1962.

Koretsky, \u201cEngineering and Chemical Thermodynamics\u201d, John Wiley & Sons, 2004,  p. 508</ref> Since standard pressure saturated water has a specific enthalpy of just {{cvt|418.91|kJ/kg|kJ/lb||}},<ref>Milo D.

So in the case of a large locomotive which can hold as much as {{cvt|10000|kg|||}} of water at a high pressure and temperature state, this explosion would have an theoretical energy release equal to about {{convert|1160|kg|||}} of [[TNT equivalent|TNT]].\n\n== Firebox explosions ==\nIn the case of a [[Firebox (steam engine)|firebox]] explosion, these typically occur after a burner [[flameout]]. Oil fumes, natural gas, propane, coal, or any other fuel can build up inside the combustion chamber. This is especially of concern when the vessel is hot; the fuels will rapidly volatize due to the temperature. Once the [[lower explosive limit]] (LEL) is reached, any source of ignition will cause an explosion of the vapors.\n\nA fuel explosion within the confines of the firebox may damage the pressurized boiler tubes and interior shell, potentially triggering structural failure, steam or water leakage, and/or a secondary boiler shell failure and [[steam explosion]].\n\nA common form of minor firebox \"explosion\" is known as \"drumming\" and can occur with any type of fuel. Instead of the normal \"roar\" of the fire, a rhythmic series of \"thumps\" and flashes of fire below the grate and through the [[firedoor]] indicate that the combustion of the fuel is proceeding through a rapid series of detonations, caused by an inappropriate air/fuel mixture with regard to the level of draft available. This usually causes no damage in locomotive type boilers, but can cause cracks in masonry boiler settings if allowed to continue.\n\n=== Grooving ===\nThe plates of early locomotive boilers were joined by simple [[lap joint|overlapping joints]]. This practice was satisfactory for the annular joints, running around the boiler, but in longitudinal joints, along the length of the boiler, the overlap of the plates diverted the boiler cross-section from its ideal circular shape. Under pressure the boiler strained to reach, as nearly as possible, the circular cross-section. Because the double-thickness overlap was stronger than the surrounding metal, the repeated bending and release caused by the variations in boiler pressure caused internal cracks, or grooves (deep pitting), along the length of the joint. The cracks offered a starting point for internal corrosion, which could hasten failure.<ref>Hewison (1983: 59 et sec)</ref> It was eventually found that this internal corrosion could be reduced by using plates of sufficient size so that no joints were situated below the water level.<ref name= CHH15>Hewison (1983: 15)</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Baldwin|first=Thomas|date=1 October 1867|title=On single and double riveted joints|journal=Transactions for 1866|publisher=[[Society of Engineers UK|Society of Engineers]]|location=London|page=150}}</ref> Eventually the simple lap seam was replaced by the single or double butt-strap seams, which do not suffer from this defect.\n\nDue to the constant expansion and contraction of the firebox a similar form of \"stress corrosion\" can take place at the ends of staybolts where they enter the firebox plates, and is accelerated by poor water quality.  Often referred to as [https://www.dli.mn.gov/sites/default/files/image016.jpg \"necking\"], this type of corrosion can reduce the strength of the staybolts until they are incapable of supporting the firebox at normal pressure.\n\nGrooving (deep, localized pitting) also occurs near the waterline, particularly in boilers that are fed with water that has not been de-aerated or treated with oxygen scavenging agents. All \"natural\" sources of water contain dissolved air, which is released as a gas when the water is heated. The air (which contains oxygen) collects in a layer near the surface of the water and greatly accelerates corrosion of the boiler plates in that area.<ref>Graham, Frank D. (1945) \"Audel's Power Plant Engineers guide\" New York, Ny: Theo Audel and Co. (p.332-333, figure 55: \"corrosion along the water line due to air\")</ref>\n\n=== Firebox ===\nThe intricate shape of a locomotive firebox, whether made of soft copper or of steel, can only resist the  steam pressure on its internal walls  if these are supported by [[Firebox (steam engine)#Sheets and stays|stays]] attached to internal girders and the outer walls. They are liable to fail through [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] (because the inner and outer walls expand at different rates under the heat of the fire), from corrosion, or from wasting as  the heads of the  stays exposed to the fire are burned away. If the stays fail the firebox will explode inwards. Regular visual inspection, internally and externally, is employed to prevent this.<ref name=\"CHH15\" /><ref>{{cite book|last=Bell|first=A Morton|title=Locomotives|volume=1|year=1950|publisher=Virtue|location=London|pages=20\u201323|oclc=499543971}}</ref> Even a well-maintained firebox will fail explosively if the water level in the boiler is allowed to fall far enough to leave the top plate of the firebox uncovered.<ref name=\"BTCenginemen\">{{cite book\n  |last=Staff\n  |title=Handbook for railway steam locomotive enginemen\n  |publisher=[[British Transport Commission]]\n  |location=London\n  |year=1957\n  |page=53\n  |chapter=The Boiler: Boiler Mountings and Details\n}}</ref> This can occur when crossing the summit of the hill, as the water flows to the front part of the boiler and can expose the firebox crown sheet.

Of the 450 passengers on board more than 250 died, including Henry Clemens, the younger brother of the author [[Mark Twain]].\n\n[[SS Ada Hancock]], a small [[steamboat]] used to transfer passengers and cargo to and from the large coastal [[steamship]]s that stopped in [[San Pedro Harbor]] in the early 1860s, suffered disaster when its boiler exploded violently in [[San Pedro Bay (California)|San Pedro Bay]], the port of [[Los Angeles]], near [[Wilmington, California]] on April 27, 1863 killing twenty-six people and injuring many others of the fifty-three or more passengers on board.\n\nThe [[Sultana (steamboat)|steamboat ''Sultana'']] was destroyed in an explosion on 27 April 1865, resulting in the greatest maritime disaster in [[United States]] history.  An estimated 1,549 passengers were killed when three of the ship's four boilers exploded and the ''Sultana'' burned and sank not far from [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. The cause was traced to a poorly executed repair to the shell of one boiler; the patch failed, and debris from that boiler ruptured two more.\n\nAnother US Civil War Steamboat explosion was the Steamer ''Eclipse'' on January 27, 1865, which was carrying members of the [[9th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery|9th Indiana Artillery]].

One of the first investigators of the problem was [[William Fairbairn]], who helped establish the first insurance company dealing with the losses such explosions could cause. He also established experimentally that the [[hoop stress]] in a cylindrical pressure vessel like a boiler was twice the [[longitudinal stress]].<ref group=\"notes\">[[William Fairbairn|Fairbairn]]'s theoretical calculation assumes that the cylindrical vessel is much longer than its diameter. In practice, this is a viable approximation for any boiler that is a [[right cylinder]] or longer. Even for a short, squat boiler such as the [[Scotch marine boiler|Scotch]], the reduced end area due to the tubes and their staying effect on the end-plates means that the principal stress is still this hoop stress.</ref> Such investigations helped him and others explain the importance of [[stress concentration]]s in weakening boilers.\n\n== Modern boilers ==\nModern boilers are designed with redundant pumps, valves, water level monitors, fuel cutoffs, automated controls, and pressure [[relief valves]]. In addition, the construction must adhere to strict engineering guidelines set by the relevant authorities. The [[National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors#National Board Inspection Code|NBIC]], [[ASME]], and others attempt to ensure safe boiler designs by publishing detailed standards. The result is a boiler unit which is less prone to catastrophic accidents.\n\nAlso improving safety is the increasing use of \"package boilers.\" These are boilers which are built at a factory then shipped out as a complete unit to the job site.  These typically have better quality and fewer issues than boilers which are site assembled tube-by-tube. A package boiler only needs the final connections to be made (electrical, breaching, condensate lines, etc.) to complete the installation.\n\n== Steam explosions ==\nIn [[steam locomotive]] boilers, as knowledge was gained by [[trial and error]] in early days, the explosive situations and consequent damage due to explosions were inevitable. However, improved design and [[Fire-tube boiler#Maintenance|maintenance]] markedly reduced the number of boiler explosions by the end of the 19th century.  Further improvements continued in the 20th century.\n\nOn land-based boilers, explosions of the pressure systems happened regularly in stationary steam boilers in the [[Victorian era]], but are now very rare because of the various [[Safety|protections]] provided, and because of regular inspections compelled by [[governmental]] and industry requirements.\n\n{{See also|List of boiler explosions}}\n\n[[Water heater]]s can [[MythBusters (2009 season)#Exploding Water Heater|explode with surprising violence]] when their safety devices fail.\n\n=== Reactor explosions ===\nA steam explosion can occur in any kind of a water heater, where a sufficient amount of energy is delivered and the steam created exceeds the strength of the vessel. When the heat delivery is sufficiently rapid, a localized superheating can occur, resulting in a water hammer destroying the vessel. The [[SL-1]] nuclear reactor accident is an example of a superheated burst of steam.  However, in the SL1 example the pressure was released by the forced ejection of control rods which allowed the steam to be vented.  The reactor did not explode, nor did the vessel rupture.\n\n== Locomotive boiler explosions in the UK ==\n[[File:Boiler explosion 1850.jpg|thumb|Aftermath of a boiler explosion on a railway locomotive circa 1850.]]\nHewison (1983)<ref>[[#Hewison, Locomotive Boiler Explosions|Hewison, Locomotive Boiler Explosions]]</ref> gives a comprehensive account of British boiler explosions, listing 137 between 1815 and 1962.  It is noteworthy that 122 of these were in the 19th century and only 15 in the 20th century.\n\nBoiler explosions generally fell into two categories.  The first is the breakage of the boiler barrel itself, through weakness/damage or excessive internal pressure, resulting in sudden discharge of steam over a wide area. [[Stress corrosion cracking]] at the [[lap joint]]s was a common cause of early boiler explosions, probably caused by [[caustic embrittlement]]. The water used in boilers was not often closely controlled, and if acidic, could corrode the [[wrought iron]] boiler plates. [[Galvanic corrosion]] was an additional problem where [[copper]] and iron were in contact.\nBoiler plates have been thrown up to a quarter of a mile (Hewison, Rolt). The second type is the collapse of the firebox under steam pressure from the adjoining boiler, releasing flames and hot gases into the cab. Improved design and maintenance almost totally eliminated the first type, but the second type is always possible if the engineer and fireman do not maintain the water level in the boiler.\n\nBoiler barrels could explode if the internal pressure became too high.  To prevent this, safety valves were installed to release the pressure at a set level. Early examples were spring-loaded, but [[John Ramsbottom (engineer)|John Ramsbottom]] invented a tamper-proof valve which was universally adopted. The other common cause of explosions was internal [[corrosion]] which weakened the boiler barrel so that it could not withstand normal operating pressure. In particular, grooves could occur along horizontal seams (lap joints) below water level. Dozens of explosions resulted, but were eliminated by 1900 by the adoption of butt joints, plus improved maintenance schedules and regular hydraulic testing.\n\nFireboxes were generally made of [[copper]], though later locomotives had [[steel]] fireboxes.  They were held to the outer part of the boiler by stays (numerous small supports).  Parts of the firebox in contact with full steam pressure have to be kept covered with water, to stop them overheating and weakening.  The usual cause of firebox collapses is that the boiler water level falls too low and the top of the firebox (crown sheet) becomes uncovered and overheats.  This occurs if the fireman has failed to maintain water level or the level indicator (gauge glass) is faulty.  A less common reason is breakage of large numbers of stays, due to corrosion or unsuitable material.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, two boiler barrel failures and thirteen firebox collapses occurred in the UK. The boiler barrel failures occurred at Cardiff in 1909 and Buxton in 1921; both were caused by misassembly of the [[safety valve]]s causing the boilers to exceed their design pressures. Of the 13 firebox collapses, four were due to broken stays, one to scale buildup on the firebox, and the rest were due to low water level.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Steam explosion]]\n* [[Boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion|Boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE)]]\n* [[Fire-tube boiler#Safety considerations|Boiler safety]]\n* [[Fusible plug]]\n* [[Grover Shoe Factory disaster]]\n* [[List of boiler explosions]]\n* [[Lists of rail accidents]]\n* [[William Fairbairn]]\n* [[John Hick (MP)|John Hick]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=notes}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite book\n  | first=Christian H. | last=Hewison\n  | year=1983\n  | title=Locomotive Boiler Explosions\n  | publisher=David and Charles\n  | isbn=0-7153-8305-1\n  |ref=Hewison, Locomotive Boiler Explosions\n}}\n* {{cite book\n  | first=L.T.C. | last=Rolt\n  | authorlink=\n  | date=1956 (and later editions)\n  | title=Red for Danger\n  | edition=\n  | publisher= Bodley Head / David and Charles / Pan Books\n}}\n* {{cite book\n  | first=Alan | last=McEwen\n  | year=2009\n  | title=Historic Steam Boiler Explosions\n  | publisher=Sledgehammer Engineering Press\n  | isbn=978-0-9532725-2-5\n  |ref=McEwen, Historic Steam Boiler Explosions\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Bartrip, P.W.J.
