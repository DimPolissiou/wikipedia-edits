There is no classification point system dictating who can play inline sledge hockey, unlike the situation with other team sports such as wheelchair basketball and wheelchair rugby.

All sticks are right-handed \u2013 left-handed sticks are not permitted.\n\nWhile field hockey in its current form appeared in mid-18th century [[England]], primarily in schools, it was not until the first half of the 19th century that it became firmly established.

There is no classification point system dictating who can play inline sledge hockey, unlike the situation with other team sports such as wheelchair basketball and wheelchair rugby. Inline sledge hockey is being developed to allow everyone, regardless of whether they have a disability or not, to complete up to world championship level based solely on talent and ability.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The first game of inline sledge hockey was played at Bisley, England, on 19 December 2009 between the Hull Stingrays and the Grimsby Redwings.

It is the 7th class of Wide Gauge's(W) AC charged(A) and Freight-dedicated(G-Goods) locomotives. Built by [[Chittaranjan Locomotive Works]] and [[BHEL]], [[Jhansi Junction railway station|Jhansi]] to [[RDSO]] specifications. On 3 August 1992, the first WAG-7 locomotive was inaugurated and christened the name 'SHANTIDAN' in honor of [[Mother Teresa]]. The loco is controlled by a tap changer. Indian Railway is going to achieve {{convert|7000000|t|sigfig=3|lk=on}} of traffic, WAG 7 is the main stay of loco. In the locomotive vehicle market WAG 7 is more economical option and one of the most affordable in the world. Hence, it has the highest production figures of any locomotive in India.\n\nThe first 71 of this class initially or still homed at [[Mughalsarai Junction railway station|Mughalsarai]] (MGS) shed and the second was [[Kanpur]] (CNB). Some units are retrofitted with Static Converters(STC) instead of Arno Rotary Converters. STCs are more efficient and require less maintenance. Also, STCs have self diagnostics making troubleshooting easier. WAG-7H is a heavy variant of WAG-7. WAG-7H #28739 has thicker under-frames. WAG-7 #27445 has closed-circuit cameras to monitor the pantograph along with a spotlight to illuminate the same at night, green lamps to exchange signals and a single windscreen on either side. [[New Katni Junction railway station|New Katni]] (NKJ) shed has added Overhead Equipment(OHE) monitors. Some WAG-7 units have A.C. cabs, SIV, MPFDCS, MPCS, Single arm pantograph, FDCS, Additional COC, Rear-view mirrors, STS, Daulat Ram's Roof-mounted DBRs, SI, Modified ceilings, Bucket seats, Waist-level headlamps, High-reach pantographs, Vigilance Control Device(VCD), Wireless Multiple Control, Vertical Dynamic Brake Resistor(DBR) and microprocessor control. Some units have their MU cables removed. One unit has [[SCHUNK]] pantograph. Some units are assembled at Dahod Workshops. Initially WAG-7 had the body-shell similar to [[Indian locomotive class WAG-5|WAG-5]] but later on all WAG-7 are/were fitted with crew safe shell like the [[Indian locomotive class WAP-4|WAP-4]] since this provided more space and relatively safer during the impact on a head-on collision. WAG-7H have crew safe shell since beginning. Older WAG-7s have Tiger Face liveries (Red/Dark Blue on white) but newer WAG-7s by CLW have yellow stripe on blue livery. All BHEL built WAG-7s have Tiger Face livery. Now, even some older WAG-7s are repainted with yellow stripe on blue livery. It is also the most powerful indigenously designed freight-dedicated locomotive in India.\n\n==Technical Specifications==\n{| class=wikitable\n|Traction Motors\n|a variant of the standard HS15250 with higher current rating (thicker [[wire gauge]], better insulation); Motors built by CLW and BHEL. 6 motors in parallel grouping\n|-\n|Traction Motors Class of Insulation for Armature and Field\n|C \n|-\n|Traction Motors Suspension\n|Axle hung and Nose-suspended \n|-\n|Traction Motors Weight\n|{{convert|3650|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Traction Motors Temperature rise in Armature\n|{{convert|90|C|F|abbr=off}}\n|-\n|Traction Motors Temperature Rise in Field\n|{{convert|70|C|F|abbr=off}} \n|-\n|Traction Motors Temperature rise in Commutator\n|{{convert|85|C|F|abbr=off}}\n|-\n|Traction Motors Coil resistance at {{convert|110|C|F|abbr=off}} of Armature\n|0.0126 ohms\n|-\n|Traction Motors Coil resistance at {{convert|110|C|F|abbr=off}} of Main pole\n|0.0117 ohms\n|-\n|Traction Motors Coil resistance at {{convert|110|C|F|abbr=off}} of Inter pole\n|0.0089 ohms\n|-\n|Traction Motors Continuous rating\n|{{convert|630|kW|hp|abbr=on}}, 750 V, 900 A, 895 rpm\n|-\n|Traction Motors rating for 1 hour\n|{{convert|670|kW|hp|abbr=on}}, 750 V, 960 A, 877 rpm\n|-\n|Traction Motors Air gap for Main pole\n|{{convert|6.35|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Traction Motors Air gap for Inter pole\n|{{convert|10|mm|in|3|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Gear Ratio\n|WAG-7 : 65:16 and 18:64 and WAG-7H : 65:16\n|-\n|Transformer \n|CCL India, type CGTT-5400, Primary rating (5670 kVA, 252 A) Secondary rating (5400 kVA, 1000 V, 5400 A), Tertiary rating 270 V, 32 taps, {{convert|12200|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, Forced Oil cooling, Class A Insulation \n|-\n|Rectifiers\n|Two silicon rectifiers, cell type S18FN350 (from Hind Rectifier), 64 per bridge, Continuous rating 2700 A / 1050 V per cubicle, Max starting current 3300 A, Forced air cooling\n|-\n|Pantographs\n|Two Stone India (Calcutta) type AM-12, {{convert|235|kg|lb|abbr=on}} including 4 insulators\n|-\n|Bogie drive arrangement\n|Gear [[pinion]]\n|-\n|Current Ratings\n|1350 A/2min, 1200 A/10min, 960 A/hr, 900 A continuous\n|-\n|Number of sandboxes\n|8\n|-\n|Permanent shunt\n|5%\n|-\n|2 Headlights\n|32 V, 50 W\n|-\n|Lead Acid batteries\n|50 cells, 110 V(5 hour rating)\n|-\n|Arno Converter Input\n|216 kVA, 415 V, 1 phase 520 A\n|-\n|Arno Converter Out put\n|150 kVA, 415 V, 3 phase 210 A, 1485 rpm\n|-\n|2 TRC-2000 type Compressors by Elgi\n|{{convert|10.5|kg/cm2|psi|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2 Compressor Motors\n|{{convert|30|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, 415 V, 930 rpm\n|-\n|2 Exhauster Motors\n|{{convert|7.5|kW|hp|abbr=on}}, 415 V, 970 rpm\n|-\n|2 250 RE type Exhausters by Northey\n|{{convert|4500|L/min|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2 SF India Ltd.

It is the 7th class of Wide Gauge's(W) AC charged(A) and Freight-dedicated(G-Goods) locomotives. Built by [[Chittaranjan Locomotive Works]] and [[BHEL]], [[Jhansi Junction railway station|Jhansi]] to [[RDSO]] specifications. On 3 August 1992, the first WAG-7 locomotive was inaugurated and christened the name 'SHANTIDAN' in honor of [[Mother Teresa]]. The loco is controlled by a tap changer. Indian Railway is going to achieve {{convert|7000000|t|sigfig=3|lk=on}} of traffic, WAG 7 is the main stay of loco. In the locomotive vehicle market WAG 7 is more economical option and one of the most affordable in the world. Hence, it has the highest production figures of any locomotive in India.\n\nThe first 71 of this class initially or still homed at [[Mughalsarai Junction railway station|Mughalsarai]] (MGS) shed and the second was [[Kanpur]] (CNB). Some units are retrofitted with Static Converters(STC) instead of Arno Rotary Converters. STCs are more efficient and require less maintenance. Also, STCs have self diagnostics making troubleshooting easier. WAG-7H is a heavy variant of WAG-7. WAG-7H #28739 has thicker under-frames. WAG-7 #27445 has closed-circuit cameras to monitor the pantograph along with a spotlight to illuminate the same at night, green lamps to exchange signals and a single windscreen on either side. [[New Katni Junction railway station|New Katni]] (NKJ) shed has added Overhead Equipment(OHE) monitors. Some WAG-7 units have A.C. cabs, SIV, MPFDCS, MPCS, Single arm pantograph, FDCS, Additional COC, Rear-view mirrors, STS, Daulat Ram's Roof-mounted DBRs, SI, Modified ceilings, Bucket seats, Waist-level headlamps, High-reach pantographs, Vigilance Control Device(VCD), Wireless Multiple Control, Vertical Dynamic Brake Resistor(DBR) and microprocessor control. Some units have their MU cables removed. One unit has [[SCHUNK]] pantograph. Some units are assembled at Dahod Workshops. Initially WAG-7 had the body-shell similar to [[Indian locomotive class WAG-5|WAG-5]] but later on all WAG-7 are/were fitted with crew safe shell like the [[Indian locomotive class WAP-4|WAP-4]] since this provided more space and relatively safer during the impact on a head-on collision. WAG-7H have crew safe shell since beginning. Older WAG-7s have Tiger Face liveries (Red/Dark Blue on white) but newer WAG-7s by CLW have yellow stripe on blue livery. All BHEL built WAG-7s have Tiger Face livery. Now, even some older WAG-7s are repainted with yellow stripe on blue livery. It is also the most powerful indigenously designed freight-dedicated locomotive in India.\n\n==Technical Specifications==\n{| class=wikitable\n|Traction Motors\n|a variant of the standard HS15250 with higher current rating (thicker [[wire gauge]], better insulation); Motors built by CLW and BHEL. 6 motors in parallel grouping\n|-\n|Traction Motors Class of Insulation for Armature and Field\n|C \n|-\n|Traction Motors Suspension\n|Axle hung and Nose-suspended \n|-\n|Traction Motors Weight\n|{{convert|3650|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Traction Motors Temperature rise in Armature\n|{{convert|90|C|F|abbr=off}}\n|-\n|Traction Motors Temperature Rise in Field\n|{{convert|70|C|F|abbr=off}} \n|-\n|Traction Motors Temperature rise in Commutator\n|{{convert|85|C|F|abbr=off}}\n|-\n|Traction Motors Coil resistance at {{convert|110|C|F|abbr=off}} of Armature\n|0.0126 ohms\n|-\n|Traction Motors Coil resistance at {{convert|110|C|F|abbr=off}} of Main pole\n|0.0117 ohms\n|-\n|Traction Motors Coil resistance at {{convert|110|C|F|abbr=off}} of Inter pole\n|0.0089 ohms\n|-\n|Traction Motors Continuous rating\n|{{convert|630|kW|hp|abbr=on}}, 750 V, 900 A, 895 rpm\n|-\n|Traction Motors rating for 1 hour\n|{{convert|670|kW|hp|abbr=on}}, 750 V, 960 A, 877 rpm\n|-\n|Traction Motors Air gap for Main pole\n|{{convert|6.35|mm|in|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Traction Motors Air gap for Inter pole\n|{{convert|10|mm|in|3|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Gear Ratio\n|WAG-7 : 65:16 and 18:64 and WAG-7H : 65:16\n|-\n|Transformer \n|CCL India, type CGTT-5400, Primary rating (5670 kVA, 252 A) Secondary rating (5400 kVA, 1000 V, 5400 A), Tertiary rating 270 V, 32 taps, {{convert|12200|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, Forced Oil cooling, Class A Insulation \n|-\n|Rectifiers\n|Two silicon rectifiers, cell type S18FN350 (from Hind Rectifier), 64 per bridge, Continuous rating 2700 A / 1050 V per cubicle, Max starting current 3300 A, Forced air cooling\n|-\n|Pantographs\n|Two Stone India (Calcutta) type AM-12, {{convert|235|kg|lb|abbr=on}} including 4 insulators\n|-\n|Bogie drive arrangement\n|Gear [[pinion]]\n|-\n|Current Ratings\n|1350 A/2min, 1200 A/10min, 960 A/hr, 900 A continuous\n|-\n|Number of sandboxes\n|8\n|-\n|Permanent shunt\n|5%\n|-\n|2 Headlights\n|32 V, 50 W\n|-\n|Lead Acid batteries\n|50 cells, 110 V(5 hour rating)\n|-\n|Arno Converter Input\n|216 kVA, 415 V, 1 phase 520 A\n|-\n|Arno Converter Out put\n|150 kVA, 415 V, 3 phase 210 A, 1485 rpm\n|-\n|2 TRC-2000 type Compressors by Elgi\n|{{convert|10.5|kg/cm2|psi|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2 Compressor Motors\n|{{convert|30|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, 415 V, 930 rpm\n|-\n|2 Exhauster Motors\n|{{convert|7.5|kW|hp|abbr=on}}, 415 V, 970 rpm\n|-\n|2 250 RE type Exhausters by Northey\n|{{convert|4500|L/min|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2 SF India Ltd.

Performed by American actress and singer [[Jodi Benson]] in the [[Title role|titular role]] as [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|Ariel]], a [[mermaid]] princess, \"Part of Your World\" is a [[Sentimental ballad|power ballad]] in which the main character expresses her strong desire to become human; its lyrics use [[placeholder name]]s in lieu of several human-related terms that would be unfamiliar to a mermaid. The film's [[Theme music|theme song]], \"Part of Your World\" is [[reprise]]d by Ariel after she rescues [[Prince Eric|Eric]], a human prince with whom she has fallen in love, from drowning.\n\nDirectly influenced by [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and [[musical theatre]], Ashman strongly believed that ''The Little Mermaid'' would benefit from an [[\"I Want\" song]] \u2013 a musical number during which the main character sings about what they hope to accomplish by the end of their story. Directors [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]] originally asked Ashman to write a song for Ariel in which she expresses her romantic feelings for Prince Eric, but the lyricist felt that a song that details the character's fascination with the human world would better serve the film's plot. Ashman recruited Benson, with whom he had previously collaborated on the stage musical ''[[Smile (musical)|Smile]]'' (1986), to record \"Part of Your World\", and worked closely with her to ensure that she delivered a desirable performance. Disney executive [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] initially ordered that \"Part of Your World\" be removed from the final film due to concerns that the ballad would bore young children. However, Ashman, Clements, Musker and animator [[Glen Keane]] ultimately convinced Katzenberg that \"Part of Your World\" is essential to the film's narrative, and the song was spared after audiences appeared to enjoy it during a subsequent [[test screening]].\n\n\"Part of Your World\" has garnered critical acclaim; both [[Film criticism|film]] and [[Music journalism|music critics]] praised the song's quality and Benson's vocal performance. Several media publications agree that \"Part of Your World\" ranks among the greatest Disney songs ever written, and credit the success of the ballad with making \"I Want\" songs a standard component of future animated [[musical film]]s. Critics have offered various interpretations of the song's [[Empowerment|empowering]] lyrics, ranging from seeking independence from [[Helicopter parent|overprotective parents]] to [[feminism]] and [[LGBT]] rights. In addition to becoming Benson's [[signature song]], which she continues to perform live, \"Part of Your World\" has been covered extensively by several artists of various genres, including [[Faith Hill]], [[Jessica Simpson]], [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Bruno Mars]], [[Carly Rae Jepsen]], [[Jessie J]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], and [[Sara Bareilles]]. Actress [[Sierra Boggess]] debuted the song in the [[The Little Mermaid (musical)|stage musical adaptation]] of the film, for which she originated the role of Ariel\n\n==Writing and

identified the [[musical motif]] he composed for the beginning of the ballad as his favorite part of the song.<ref name=\":1\" /> Ashman debuted \"Part of Your World\" for Clements and Musker at his apartment in Greenwich Village, Manhattan.<ref name=\":4\" /> Only the directors' second time meeting Ashman and first time meeting Menken, Menken provided the piano accompaniment while Ashman sang Ariel's melody himself, instead of their traditional method of Menken singing lead vocals.<ref name=\":5\" /> Moved by Ashman's demonstration, Musker recalled that the lyricist gazed up towards the ceiling as though it were the human world itself as he \"became Ariel before our eyes\" and \"poured out his heart in song\", helping them visualize \"this far-off place of wonder that so entranced this little mermaid.\u201d<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nClements and Musker enjoyed the song but would sometimes disagree with Ashman over its lyrics, which Ashman had insisted be very specific.<ref name=\":5\" /> Musker specifically wanted to change the line \"I wanna be where the people are\" because he felt that it sounded too [[Political correctness|political]] and reminded him of Governor of Illinois [[Dan Walker (politician)|Dan Walker]], suggesting that \"the\" be removed.<ref name=\":5\" /> Appalled by this suggestion, Ashman insisted that the line remain unchanged to prevent the word \"where\" from having to be held longer; Musker would eventually admit that his suggestion was \"idiotic\".<ref name=\":5\" /> Although Ashman was very defensive about the song and typically dismissed most of the directors' suggestions, he agreed to revise lyrics that originally described the contents of Ariel's grotto using eloquent terms such as \"fine china\" and \"books bound in leather and gold\", and replaced them with words that would be more familiar to a mermaid who learns about humans from an uneducated seagull named [[Scuttle (The Little Mermaid)|Scuttle]].<ref name=\":5\" /> Ashman's revisions integrated funnier lyrics such as \"[[Placeholder name|thingamabobs]]\u201d and \u201cwhozits and whatzits\" into the song, making \"Part of Your World\" more consistent with the film's lighthearted tone.<ref name=\":5\" /> Ashman initially pitched Ariel's reprise of \"Part of Your World\" as a sad [[lament]] in which the character sings \"I\u2019ll never be\u2026part of that world\".<ref name=\":5\" /> Clements and Musker argued that the reprise should instead convey Ariel's determined nature as she decides to pursue her dream of becoming part of Eric's world.<ref name=\":5\" /> Howard agreed to rewrite the reprise into a more positive anthem that ultimately reads \"I don\u2019t know when, I don\u2019t know how, but I know something\u2019s starting right

Ashman]] and composer [[Alan Menken]] for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s animated feature film ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989). Performed by American actress and singer [[Jodi Benson]] in the [[Title role|titular role]] as [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|Ariel]], a [[mermaid]] princess, \"Part of Your World\" is a [[Sentimental ballad|power ballad]] in which the main character expresses her strong desire to become human; its lyrics use [[placeholder name]]s in lieu of several human-related terms that would be unfamiliar to a mermaid. The film's [[Theme music|theme song]], \"Part of Your World\" is [[reprise]]d by Ariel after she rescues [[Prince Eric|Eric]], a human prince with whom she has fallen in love, from drowning.\n\nDirectly influenced by [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and [[musical theatre]], Ashman strongly believed that ''The Little Mermaid'' would benefit from an [[\"I Want\" song]] \u2013 a musical number during which the main character sings about what they hope to accomplish by the end of their story. Directors [[Ron Clements]] and [[John Musker]] originally asked Ashman to write a song for Ariel in which she expresses her romantic feelings for Prince Eric, but the lyricist felt that a song that details the character's fascination with the human world would better serve the film's plot. Ashman recruited Benson, with whom he had previously collaborated on the stage musical ''[[Smile (musical)|Smile]]'' (1986), to record \"Part of Your World\", and worked closely with her to ensure that she delivered a desirable performance. Disney executive [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] initially ordered that \"Part of Your World\" be removed from the final film due to concerns that the ballad would bore young children. However, Ashman, Clements, Musker and animator [[Glen Keane]] ultimately convinced Katzenberg that \"Part of Your World\" is essential to the film's narrative, and the song was spared after audiences appeared to enjoy it during a subsequent [[test screening]].\n\n\"Part of Your World\" has garnered critical acclaim; both [[Film criticism|film]] and [[Music journalism|music critics]] praised the song's quality and Benson's vocal performance. Several media publications agree that \"Part of Your World\" ranks among the greatest Disney songs ever written, and credit the success of the ballad with making \"I Want\" songs a standard component of future animated [[musical film]]s. Critics have offered various interpretations of the song's [[Empowerment|empowering]] lyrics, ranging from seeking independence from [[Helicopter parent|overprotective parents]] to [[feminism]] and [[LGBT]] rights. In addition to becoming Benson's [[signature song]], which she continues to perform live, \"Part of Your World\" has been covered extensively by several artists of various genres, including [[Faith Hill]], [[Jessica Simpson]], [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Bruno Mars]], [[Carly Rae Jepsen]], [[Jessie J]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], and [[Sara Bareilles]]. Actress [[Sierra Boggess]] debuted the song in the [[The Little Mermaid (musical)|stage musical adaptation]] of the film, for which she originated the role of Ariel\n\n==Writing and

(musical)|Smile]]'' (1986) in which a young girl, much like Ariel, sings about regularly watching Disney [[anthology series]] as a means of escaping her troubled childhood.<ref name=\":70\" /> Menken identified the [[musical motif]] he composed for the beginning of the ballad as his favorite part of the song.<ref name=\":1\" /> Ashman debuted \"Part of Your World\" for Clements and Musker at his apartment in Greenwich Village, Manhattan.<ref name=\":4\" /> Only the directors' second time meeting Ashman and first time meeting Menken, Menken provided the piano accompaniment while Ashman sang Ariel's melody himself, instead of their traditional method of Menken singing lead vocals.<ref name=\":5\" /> Moved by Ashman's demonstration, Musker recalled that the lyricist gazed up towards the ceiling as though it were the human world itself as he \"became Ariel before our eyes\" and \"poured out his heart in song\", helping them visualize \"this far-off place of wonder that so entranced this little mermaid.\u201d<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nClements and Musker enjoyed the song but would sometimes disagree with Ashman over its lyrics, which Ashman had insisted be very specific.<ref

Illinois [[Dan Walker (politician)|Dan Walker]], suggesting that \"the\" be removed.<ref name=\":5\" /> Appalled by this suggestion, Ashman insisted that the line remain unchanged to prevent the word \"where\" from having to be held longer; Musker would eventually admit that his suggestion was \"idiotic\".<ref name=\":5\" /> Although Ashman was very defensive about the song and typically dismissed most of the directors' suggestions, he agreed to revise lyrics that originally described the contents of Ariel's grotto using eloquent terms such as \"fine china\" and \"books bound in leather and gold\", and replaced them with words that would be more familiar to a mermaid who learns about humans from an uneducated seagull named [[Scuttle (The Little Mermaid)|Scuttle]].<ref name=\":5\" /> Ashman's revisions integrated funnier lyrics such as \"[[Placeholder name|thingamabobs]]\u201d and \u201cwhozits and whatzits\" into the song, making \"Part of Your World\" more consistent with the film's lighthearted tone.<ref name=\":5\" /> Ashman initially pitched Ariel's reprise of \"Part of Your World\" as a sad [[lament]] in which the character sings \"I\u2019ll never be\u2026part of that world\".<ref name=\":5\" /> Clements and Musker argued that the reprise should instead convey Ariel's determined nature as she decides to pursue her dream of becoming part of Eric's world.<ref name=\":5\" /> Howard agreed to rewrite the reprise into a more positive anthem that ultimately reads \"I don\u2019t know when, I don\u2019t know how, but I know something\u2019s starting right now\u2026Watch and you\u2019ll see\u2026someday I\u2019ll be\u2026part of your world\", providing the film with more momentum while establishing further conflict between Ariel and her father [[King
