Asbestos was sometimes \"[[Flocking (texture)|flocked]]\" above false ceilings, inside technical ducts, and in many other small spaces where firefighters would have difficulty gaining access. Structural components like asbestos panels were also used.  In residences, asbestos was often a component of a type of flocked acoustic ceiling called [[popcorn ceiling]] or \"cottage cheese ceiling\", until its production was banned in the US in 1978.  However, the ban allowed installers to use up remaining stocks, so houses built as late as 1986 could still have asbestos in their acoustic ceilings.{{cn|date=August 2014}}  The only way to be sure is to remove a sample and have it tested by a competent laboratory. \n\n==Rationale==\nDepending on how and where asbestos was applied, it might not pose any risk to most users of the building.  If the fibers cannot become dislodged, they cannot be inhaled, and thus the asbestos poses no risk. However, some methods of applying asbestos, particularly [[Flocking (texture)|flocking]], allow asbestos fibers to  gradually drop off into the air. Asbestos poses hazards to maintenance personnel who have to drill holes in walls for installation of cables or pipes. Even if the workers are [[ppe|protected]], such maintenance operation may release fibers into the air, which may be inhaled by others. Interventions in areas where asbestos is present often have to follow stringent procedures.\n\nWhen asbestos fibers can easily be made into airborne dust, the material is known as \"friable\". For example, a [[popcorn ceiling]] is extremely friable, whereas [[Vinyl composition tile|asbestos floor tile]] is considered non-friable.{{Citation needed|reason=evidence not provided by Vinyl tile link|date=January 2020}} Friable materials, such as popcorn ceiling tiles, have a lifespan between 20\u201340 years plus; whereas non-friable materials, such as asbestos roofing tiles, have a lifespan of 50\u2013100 years and beyond.   \n\nDifferent countries have different regulations and methods of enforcement, when it comes to asbestos removal. It is extremely important to remember that prior to any asbestos removal procedures taking place; the client has a duty of care and must verify that the specialist removal contractor can provide proof of the following:{{cn|date=August 2014}}\n*license if licensing is required within the jurisdiction\n*specific asbestos public and employer [[liability insurance]]\n*worker training to include supervisor and contract manager training within the past 12 months\n*worker fit-testing and medical surveillance within 12 months\n*specialist equipment testing within 6 months - DOP and PAT within the EU\n\nOptionally, the specialist contractor should be able to provide accreditation from [[ARCA]] or other such trade organization.{{cn|date=August 2014}}\n\n==Removal procedures==\n[[File:UK Asbestos Removal Enclosure.jpg|right|thumb|Typical UK temporary enclosure used for asbestos removal]]\n[[File:Asbestos-abatement-temporary-air-duct.jpg|right|thumb|A temporary plastic air duct used to exhaust filtered air from a negative air pressure (suction) machine|alt=A photo of a temporary plastic air duct that leads out from an area where asbestos abatement is taking place.]]\n[[File:Asbestos Removal 2008.JPG|thumb|right|An apartment complex that was subject to asbestos removal before [[demolition]]]]\nIn the United States, asbestos removal must be completed by an [[EPA]] licensed asbestos abatement contractor. Furthermore, the building has to be tested by an EPA licensed testing consultant. \n\nWhen asbestos abatement is taking place, occupants are not allowed to enter the area.  Typically, the part of the building from which asbestos is being removed has to be sealed off in order to prevent contamination of the other areas. Methods of sealing off an area often include the use of [[polyethylene]] film, [[duct tape]] and [[negative air pressure]] machines which are fitted with [[HEPA]] filters. The idea is that the contained area is pulling fresh air in as to not let asbestos fibers out into the surrounding environment.{{cn|date=August 2014}}\n\nOnly a special [[vacuum cleaner]] that is designed for asbestos containment (class H) can be safely used when cleaning up during and after asbestos removal.  Ordinary vacuum cleaners cannot be used, even those fitted with a HEPA filter.<ref>[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/guidance/em4.pdf British government]</ref>  An ordinary vacuum cleaner will expel the asbestos fibres into the room air.\n\nIf the building is closed to normal users, it may be necessary to seal it off from outside atmosphere so that no accessible air is contaminated. Examples of buildings that required asbestos removal  include the [[Jussieu Campus]] and the [[Tour Montparnasse]].\n\nAn asbestos-containing building that is to be [[demolition|torn down]] may have to be sealed, and to have its asbestos safely removed before ordinary [[demolition]] can be performed.  The asbestos removal may take longer and cost more than the actual demolition. For example, the former seat of parliament of [[East Germany]], the [[Palast der Republik]], was stripped of most of its asbestos between 1998 and 2001, before it was finally demolished starting in 2006.\n\nNew innovative methods for asbestos removal have been used. One example is the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]\u2019s B238 building, where a track mounted wet cutting [[saw]] with a [[diamond blade]] was used in order to cut the building into small sections. These small sections were then double wrapped in plastic, the minimum requirement when transporting asbestos material, and driven to a [[landfill]].

Arcadia has a dense history from generations of human settlements.<ref name=\":6\" /> MacKay-Lyons was strongly influenced by the region's history, Maritime landscape, architecture and functionalist design. He studied architecture at the [[Technical University of Nova Scotia]] (graduating 1978). During his first year of his undergraduate education, he was compelled to quit, though eventually decided to stay after being convinced by his professor, Larry Richards. Following the completion of his degree, he partnered with Larry Richards and Eric Fiss to form a practice called 'Networks'. He later pursued his Master's in Architecture and Urban Design from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], where he worked closely on Urban Design projects with [[Barton Myers]] and [[Charles Moore (architect)|Charles Moore]]. During his graduate education he became a teachers assistant, which inspired him to eventually become a professor. Towards the end of his graduate degree, he moved to [[Italy]] to work with [[Giancarlo De Carlo]] in [[Siena]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canadianarchitect.com/canadian-architect-gold-medals-2015/|title=RAIC Gold Medal 2015 issue|date=2015-06-14|website=Canadian Architect|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> He also studied and worked in [[China]] and [[Japan]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mlsarchitects.ca/profile/brianmackaylyons |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703043050/http://www.mlsarchitects.ca/profile/brianmackaylyons/ |archive-date=3 July 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nIn 1983, Mackay-Lyons returned to Nova Scotia to work on vernacular designs and to teach full time at [[Dalhousie University]], where he holds a full professorship in architecture. After finding difficulty in starting an architectural practice while teaching, he began to teach part-time at the University, and continues to do so presently (as of 2020). He began to create a large repertoire of residential projects, though his first buildings were urban. <ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nTalbot Sweetapple was a student of MacKay-Lyons, and began to work for him while he was a single practitioner. In 1990 they renovated an old gas station on Falkland Street in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], to use as an office, while also building an additional four town homes on site to finance the project.<ref name=\":3\" /> In 2005, Sweetapple became a partner of MacKay-Lyons, and Brian MacKay-Lyons Architecture and Urban Design became MacKay-Lyons Sweetapple Architects. <ref name=\":7\" /> MacKay-Lyons seeks to implement aspects of traditional practice in the relationships of the firm, such as encouraging the dynamic of apprentice to master-builder, as opposed to intern to architect. This is done to affirm a hands-on building approach, rooted in tangible experience.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://issuu.com/papress/docs/ghost|title=Ghost: Building an Architectural Vision|website=Issuu|language=en|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>  \n\nBefore MacKay-Lyons' partnership with Sweetapple, Lyons was focused dominantly on vernacular rural homes on the coast of Nova Scotia, that he has described as being<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=MacKay-Lyons|first=Brian|date=1995|title=Seven Stories from a Village Architect|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4091342|journal=Design Quarterly|issue=165|pages=1|doi=10.2307/4091342|issn=0011-9415}}</ref> ''rooted in culture, yet contemporary''.

The laboratory arose from MacKay-Lyons dissatisfaction with the lack of connection between theory and practice in architectural education.<ref name=\":0\" /> Ghost was formerly described<ref>http://www.mlsarchitects.ca/ghost/</ref> as ''an education initiative designed to promote the transfer of architectural knowledge through direct experience - project-based learning taught in the master builder tradition - with emphasis on issues of landscape, material culture, and community.''\n\nThe word 'ghost' is used to convey a sense of travel across time. In the Maritime provinces of Canada, story telling is commonplace in daily life, and was also adopted by MacKay-Lyons in his building practices, and in the design-build.<ref name=\":2\" /> Each year it was run, a group of students, professors and architects were invited to participate, and were to divide their time equally between designing and building the structure. Every build centered around a different theme relevant to architectural discourse, such as Ghost 1, that discussed symbolic form, or Ghost 2 addressing technology. <ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=MacKay-Lyons|first=Brian|date=1995|title=Seven Stories from a Village Architect|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4091342|journal=Design Quarterly|issue=165|pages=1|doi=10.2307/4091342|issn=0011-9415}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mlsarchitects.ca/|title=MacKay-Lyons Sweetapple Architects Limited|website=MacKay-Lyons Sweetapple Architects Limited|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref> The lab was also continually related to the Arcadian history of the ancient site that was being built on.\n\n== Design Influences and Philosophy ==\nMacKay-Lyons was heavily influenced by his upbringing in Arcadia. He witnessed how the early settlers of Arcadia often tacked generations of their houses onto one another. He regards culture, history and architecture as being organic, with continuous, inherent connections to the landscape.<ref name=\":43\">{{Cite journal|last=MacKay-Lyons|first=Brian|date=1995|title=Seven Stories from a Village Architect|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4091342|journal=Design Quarterly|issue=165|pages=1|doi=10.2307/4091342|issn=0011-9415}}</ref> Additionally, Arcadia\u2019s rich history, simple vernacular buildings and expansive landscape provided MacKay-Lyons with an appreciation for traditional building methods, and the importance of context to a place. He draws inspiration from observing unique qualities of the surroundings, such as<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canadianarchitect.com/canadian-architect-gold-medals-2015/|title=RAIC Gold Medal 2015 issue|date=2015-06-14|website=Canadian Architect|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref> ''climate, land form or cultural history,'' and uses this as a basis for his design work, as they are already existing and waiting to be discovered. He has stated that he is more interested in rediscovering something that has already been understood, than he is in inventing something new.<ref name=\":3\" /> He therefore believes that his buildings belong to the history of architecture.<ref name=\":43\" />\n\nIn his essay ''Seven Stories From a Village Architect'', titles from a compilation of short stories include simple structures such as<ref name=\":43\" /> ''Boat, Shed and Barn.'' He works with the archetypal quality of these structures to sustain Arcadia\u2019s traditional building typologies. As a child, witnessing the construction of these structures influenced MacKay-Lyons' in his practice and his idea of craft and the vernacular. He has described the vernacular as being <ref name=\":43\" /> ''a process or a cultural view connected to material culture and the culture of building.''

His life in Arcadia, its history, culture, landscape and architecture have been hugely influential to MacKay-Lyons.

Arcadia has a dense history from generations of human settlements.<ref name=\":6\" /> MacKay-Lyons was strongly influenced by the region's history, Maritime landscape, architecture and functionalist design. He studied architecture at the [[Technical University of Nova Scotia]] (graduating 1978). During his first year of his undergraduate education, he was compelled to quit, though eventually decided to stay after being convinced by his professor, Larry Richards. Following the completion of his degree, he partnered with Larry Richards and Eric Fiss to form a practice called 'Networks'. He later pursued his Master's in Architecture and Urban Design from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], where he worked closely on Urban Design projects with [[Barton Myers]] and [[Charles Moore (architect)|Charles Moore]]. During his graduate education he became a teachers assistant, which inspired him to eventually become a professor. Towards the end of his graduate degree, he moved to [[Italy]] to work with [[Giancarlo De Carlo]] in [[Siena]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canadianarchitect.com/canadian-architect-gold-medals-2015/|title=RAIC Gold Medal 2015 issue|date=2015-06-14|website=Canadian Architect|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> He also studied and worked in [[China]] and [[Japan]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mlsarchitects.ca/profile/brianmackaylyons |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703043050/http://www.mlsarchitects.ca/profile/brianmackaylyons/ |archive-date=3 July 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nIn 1983, Mackay-Lyons returned to Nova Scotia to work on vernacular designs and to teach full time at [[Dalhousie University]], where he holds a full professorship in architecture. After finding difficulty in starting an architectural practice while teaching, he began to teach part-time at the University, and continues to do so presently (as of 2020). He began to create a large repertoire of residential projects, though his first buildings were urban. <ref name=\":3\" /> \n\nTalbot Sweetapple was a student of MacKay-Lyons, and began to work for him while he was a single practitioner. In 1990 they renovated an old gas station on Falkland Street in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], to use as an office, while also building an additional four town homes on site to finance the project.<ref name=\":3\" /> In 2005, Sweetapple became a partner of MacKay-Lyons, and Brian MacKay-Lyons Architecture and Urban Design became MacKay-Lyons Sweetapple Architects. <ref name=\":7\" /> MacKay-Lyons seeks to implement aspects of traditional practice in the relationships of the firm, such as encouraging the dynamic of apprentice to master-builder, as opposed to intern to architect. This is done to affirm a hands-on building approach, rooted in tangible experience.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://issuu.com/papress/docs/ghost|title=Ghost: Building an Architectural Vision|website=Issuu|language=en|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>  \n\nBefore MacKay-Lyons' partnership with Sweetapple, Lyons was focused dominantly on vernacular rural homes on the coast of Nova Scotia, that he has described as being<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=MacKay-Lyons|first=Brian|date=1995|title=Seven Stories from a Village Architect|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4091342|journal=Design Quarterly|issue=165|pages=1|doi=10.2307/4091342|issn=0011-9415}}</ref> ''rooted in culture, yet contemporary''. To accommodate for Talbot Sweetapple and the subsequent growth of their firm, they increasingly began to undertake urban, public projects in the late 1990s, including the [[Dalhousie Faculty of Computer Science]] (1999), [[Ship's Company Theatre]], [[Parrsboro, Nova Scotia]] (2004), the Canadian High Commission in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]] (2005) and the TUNS (Dalhousie) Architecture School.<ref>Malcolm Quantrill, Plain Modern: The architecture of Brian Mackay-Lyons (Princeton Architectural Press: Princeton, NJ, 2005)</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mlsarchitects.ca/|title=MacKay-Lyons Sweetapple Architects Limited|website=MacKay-Lyons Sweetapple Architects Limited|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> Some of these projects, namely the TUNS Architecture school, have been described as being of the 'folk-tech' style, which MacKay-Lyons has defined as being synonymous with 'low-tech', or utilizing cultural, vernacular methods <ref>{{Cite book|last=Varga|first=Darrell|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Kk_ri6lJT-0C&pg=PA227&lpg=PA227&dq=mackay+lyons+folk+tech&source=bl&ots=AWy6S1rcnh&sig=ACfU3U3gv_DswKZXkt9BkytxTBbosCV8zg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjWxpn1j7boAhXHWc0KHVj0BrUQ6AEwAXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=folk%20tech&f=false|title=Rain, Drizzle, Fog: Film and Television in Atlantic Canada|date=2009|publisher=University of Calgary Press|isbn=978-1-55238-248-6|language=en}}</ref>.

He is a five-time winner of the [[Governor General's Awards|Governor General's Medal]] for architecture, fellow of the [[Royal Architectural Institute of Canada]] and honorary fellow of the [[American Institute of Architects]].<ref>http://thechronicleherald.ca/NovaScotia/1141405.html</ref>\n\n== Ghost Lab ==\nIn 1994, Mackay-Lyons began an educational summer [[Design\u2013build|design-build]] program on his family farm near Kingsburg, Nova Scotia entitled the Ghost Architectural Laboratory.<ref name=\":5\" /> As of 2013 the program is no longer taking place, although architecture-related conferences are sometimes held at the same location in the summer. The laboratory arose from MacKay-Lyons dissatisfaction with the lack of connection between theory and practice in architectural education.<ref name=\":0\" /> Ghost was formerly described<ref>http://www.mlsarchitects.ca/ghost/</ref> as ''an education initiative designed to promote the transfer of architectural knowledge through direct experience - project-based learning taught in the master builder tradition - with emphasis on issues of landscape, material culture, and community.''\n\nThe word 'ghost' is used to convey a sense of travel across time. In the Maritime provinces of Canada, story telling is commonplace in daily life, and was also adopted by MacKay-Lyons in his building practices, and in the design-build.<ref name=\":2\" /> Each year it was run, a group of students, professors and architects were invited to participate, and were to divide their time equally between designing and building the structure. Every build centered around a different theme relevant to architectural discourse, such as Ghost 1, that discussed symbolic form, or Ghost 2 addressing technology. <ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=MacKay-Lyons|first=Brian|date=1995|title=Seven Stories from a Village Architect|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4091342|journal=Design Quarterly|issue=165|pages=1|doi=10.2307/4091342|issn=0011-9415}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mlsarchitects.ca/|title=MacKay-Lyons Sweetapple Architects Limited|website=MacKay-Lyons Sweetapple Architects Limited|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref> The lab was also continually related to the Arcadian history of the ancient site that was being built on.\n\n== Design Influences and Philosophy ==\nMacKay-Lyons was heavily influenced by his upbringing in Arcadia. He witnessed how the early settlers of Arcadia often tacked generations of their houses onto one another. He regards culture, history and architecture as being organic, with continuous, inherent connections to the landscape.<ref name=\":43\">{{Cite journal|last=MacKay-Lyons|first=Brian|date=1995|title=Seven Stories from a Village Architect|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4091342|journal=Design Quarterly|issue=165|pages=1|doi=10.2307/4091342|issn=0011-9415}}</ref> Additionally, Arcadia\u2019s rich history, simple vernacular buildings and expansive landscape provided MacKay-Lyons with an appreciation for traditional building methods, and the importance of context to a place. He draws inspiration from observing unique qualities of the surroundings, such as<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canadianarchitect.com/canadian-architect-gold-medals-2015/|title=RAIC Gold Medal 2015 issue|date=2015-06-14|website=Canadian Architect|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref> ''climate, land form or cultural history,'' and uses this as a basis for his design work, as they are already existing and waiting to be discovered. He has stated that he is more interested in rediscovering something that has already been understood, than he is in inventing something new.<ref name=\":3\" /> He therefore believes that his buildings belong to the history of architecture.<ref name=\":43\" />\n\nIn his essay ''Seven Stories From a Village Architect'', titles from a compilation of short stories include simple structures such as<ref name=\":43\" /> ''Boat, Shed and Barn.'' He works with the archetypal quality of these structures to sustain Arcadia\u2019s traditional building typologies. As a child, witnessing the construction of these structures influenced MacKay-Lyons' in his practice and his idea of craft and the vernacular. He has described the vernacular as being <ref name=\":43\" /> ''a process or a cultural view connected to material culture and the culture of building.'' The vernacular has also shaped his view on sustainability, which he considers to be largely cultural. MacKay-Lyons believes cultural sustainability arises when local materials and building practices are used, and has stated that'',<ref name=\":03\" /> \u2018vernacular is what you do when you can\u2019t afford to get it wrong\u2019.'' This continues into his ideas about economy and ethics, as Arcadia\u2019s first settlers were dominantly peasants and a modest way of living was virtuous.<ref name=\":43\" /> MacKay-Lyons adapted this cultural, democratic ethic in his work through the continued use of simple, quiet forms and traditional vernacular styles. He is dedicated to building at least one project a year under $100,000 to stay connected to his democratic ideals and vernacular methods.

Helicopter reporter Ken Loney calls in with a report about a riot at the office of Dr. Joe Mendez that has resulted in numerous deaths. After Ken is unexpectedly cut off, the group tries to confirm his report, but their witnesses are disconnected before being put on the airwaves. After they are contacted by the [[BBC]] for [[Breaking news|breaking the story]], Ken calls back and says he has taken refuge in a grain silo. He describes the rioters as trying to eat one another or even themselves. When one of the rioters attacks the silo, Ken's call is interrupted by an audio transmission in French.\n\nLaurel-Ann translates the transmission, which is an instruction to remain indoors, not to use [[terms of endearment]], rhetorical discourse, or the English language and not to translate the message. Pontypool is declared to be under quarantine. Ken calls back again and gets his phone close enough to his attacker so that his murmurs of \"Help me\" are audible. A horde of people attack the radio station, and Grant, Sydney, and Laurel-Ann lock themselves inside. Meanwhile, Laurel-Ann begins repeating the word \"missing\" and imitates the sound of a tea kettle. \n\nDr. Mendez arrives at the radio station through a window and hides with Grant and Sydney in the soundproof booth. Ken calls in and, while on the air, succumbs to the virus. Laurel-Ann begins to slam her head against the sound booth's window and chews off her lower lip. Mendez hypothesizes that a virus has infected certain words in the English language; only certain words infect certain people who then find another infected person to kill themselves with. Sydney manages to call her children, only to hear them becoming infected. Outside the booth, Laurel-Ann vomits a large amount of blood and falls down, dead. Mendez suspects this has happened since she failed to find a victim.\n\nThe horde then breaks into the radio station, attacking the sound booth. Sydney draws the mob outside with a looped recording of Grant's voice. When he fears that he is about to succumb to the virus, Dr. Mendez begins to speak in Armenian upon realizing that the virus is exclusive to the English language, which prevents the virus from taking over. When the recording fails, the mob returns but Mendez lures them away, saving Sydney and Grant, who now lock themselves in the equipment room.\n\nWhile Grant tries to figure out how to reverse the symptom, Sydney begins to succumb to the word \"kill\". Grant convinces her that the word \"kill\" now means \"kiss\" and her symptoms subside. Hoping to stop the virus, the pair go on the air, spouting a series of self-contradicting and confusing phrases to help their infected listeners, ignoring warnings from the authorities who are trying to get them off the air. While an amplified voice from outside counts down from ten, Sydney joins Grant in the booth and they kiss. An explosion can be heard when the film cuts to black. \n\nOver the black, news reports of further outbreaks of the virus suggest that the quarantine failed, spread by the news itself and eventually reaching [[England]], the source of its targeted language. In a [[post-credits scene]], Sydney and Grant survive the virus and continue speaking English by maintaining a system of improvisational roleplay as the screen shifts from black and white to color.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Stephen McHattie]] as Grant Mazzy\n* Lisa Houle as Sydney Briar\n* [[Georgina Reilly]] as Laurel-Ann Drummond\n* [[Hrant Alianak]] as Dr. Mendez\n* [[Rick Roberts (actor)|Rick Roberts]] as Ken Loney\n* [[Boyd Banks]] as Jay (Osama)\n* [[Tony Burgess (author)|Tony Burgess]] as Tony (Lawrence)\n* Rachel Burns as Colin (Daud)\n\n==Production==\n''Pontypool'' is based on Tony Burgess' novel ''[[Pontypool Changes Everything]]''.

Matthen ('''May 18th 1890\u2013June 2nd 1960)  was a Member of the Indian Parliament in the first Lok Sabha to be constituted in 1952 after India gained Independence from Britain. He represented the Thiruvalla constituency of Kerala. Matthen was appointed the Indian Ambassador to Sudan after his single term in the Lok Sabha. Before his entry into politics, Matthen was  a businessman with interests in cashew, minerals, insurance, plantations and banking. He was responsible for starting the Alleppey Chamber of Commerce. He was Managing Director of  the Travancore National & Quilon (TN&Q) Bank when it suffered a run of unprecedented length that forced it to close. The bank run was said to have been escalated by Sir C. P. Ramaswami Iyer <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._P._Ramaswami_Iyer|title=Sir|last=Ramaswami Iyer|first=CP|date=|website=Wikipedia|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>, the Dewan of Travancore, in an attempt to reduce the power of the Christian Community who were agitating for fair representation in the governing council of this Princely State. C.P. Matthen was extradited from Madras and imprisoned in Trivandrum, allegedly for balance sheet irregularities. He was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment but offered many chances to walk free if he would acknowledge guilt. C.P. Matthen refused these offers, maintaining his innocence for more than three years. He became something of a folk hero for his uncompromising stand. He was released on January 22nd 1942 without condition or explanation and returned to Madras.  \n\n== Early life ==\nCP Matthen was born into a landed Christian family in central Travancore, in [[Kavumbhagom]], Thiruvalla. It was unusual in that agricultural economy, even for landed families, to educate their children beyond high school, but Matthen went to Madras after high school and did his Bachelor of History degree at Madras Christian College (MCC). He completed his education with a Bachelor of Law. \n\n== Insurance and Banking ==\nAt the age of 29, Matthen raised Rs 56,000 in capital and Rs 54,000 in deposits and started a bank that he called the Quilon Bank with its headquarters in Kollum (Quilon), The Quilon Bank headquarter building was then constructed and completed in 1935. In a relatively short space of 15 years, the bank\u2019s total working capital rose from Rs 156,000 to Rs 10,246,000.\n\nAnother leading Travancore businessman of that era was Mr [[K. C. Mammen Mappillai|K.C.Mammen Mappillai]], whose interests were not only in banking - his bank was called the Travancore National Bank - but also in journalism, newspaper publishing and politics, his heart was actually in journalism. He was the Chief Editor of a Travancore newspaper, [[Malayala Manorama]]. \n\nMammen and Matthen had started an insurance company together, and the commercial success of this new venture led them to amalgamate their respective banks in 1937. The registered office remained at the Quilon Bank headquarters in Travancore but the main business of the bank was conducted from its central office in Madras where its primary shareholders were based.

To retain the business and deposits of the Travancore State, Matthen and Mammen had not only agreed to the headquarters in Travancore but that two of the bank\u2019s directors were the Dewan\u2019s appointees and also that the Bank\u2019s General Manager, a confidant of the Dewan named K. S. Ramanujam, was appointed at the specific recommendation of Sir CP. Despite this initial support from the Travancore Government, within a few months of amalgamation being completed, rumors started making its rounds that the bank was insolvent, and by 1938 there was a run on the bank\u2019s assets \u2013 this was instigated not only by the Dewan but was publicized by the Travancore State\u2019s Department of Publicity. The bank\u2019s financial run concluded with 88% of the public\u2019s deposits being returned by the bank, and the bank becoming insolvent. At this point the trap was sprung, by Sir CP\u2019s administration demanding the extradition of Matthen and Mammen from Madras Presidency to Travancore State to stand trial for defrauding the public. Sir CP also convinced the British Government in Madras that the bank and its directors had been financing the Congress party and the Independence movement, so appeals to the Madras High Court and the Privy Council in London to stay the extradition orders were rejected and 3 directors of the bank including Matthen, Mammen and Mammen\u2019s elder brother and Mammen\u2019s son, were transported in chains from Madras to Quilon to stand trial.\n\nAt the trial in Trivandrum, the erstwhile General Manager of the bank - K. S. Ramanujam, who was the nominee of the Maharaja's government - falsely testified that Mammen and Matthen had defrauded the bank and four directors (including Mammen\u2019s brother and son) were then awarded 8 years\u2019 imprisonment. The bank\u2019s remaining assets were liquidated by the State, and the bank\u2019s assets were distributed - mainly to confidants of Sir C. P. Ramaswamy Aiyer, one of whom acquired the bank headquarters\u2019 building in Quilon for Rs 15,000 - approximately a tenth of what it had cost to build three years earlier. With the first year in jail, Mammen\u2019s imprisoned elder brother died a broken man. Soon afterwards, Sir CP, who had been an astute lawyer in the colonial administration, being keenly aware of the weaknesses in the Government\u2019s case \u2013 which depended on K. S. Ramanujam who vanished abroad after the trial - sent word to Mammen and Matthen that if they admitted their accused guilt and sought the Maharaja\u2019s mercy they could be pardoned. Mammen and his son, had other major family problems, so they agreed to sign the false declaration but Matthen continued to refuse. Sir CP initially declined to agree to the release without all of three of them admitting guilt, but finally released Mammen and his son on receiving their written \u201cconfessions\u201d. Matthen continued to hold out on his refusal to sign any false confession, despite heavy pressure brought on him through the Inspector General of Police, Mr Abdul Karim, visiting him regularly in jail and suggesting that he sign a letter \u2013 which the IG had drafted, requesting the Maharaja to pardon and release him.\nFinally, on 22nd January 1942, Mr. C. P. Matthen was unconditionally released by the Maharaja's Government without any written or verbal false admission of guilt. The IG, Mr. Abdul Karim, took Matthen in his official car from Travancore jail to his house where his family had waited patiently for his release from jail.\n\n==Member of Parliament==\nMr. C. P. Matthen was a member of the First [[Lok Sabha]] (Indian Parliament) in 1952, representing [[Mavelikara]] Constituency of [[Kerala]].\n\n==Lok Sabha Member and Ambassador==\nHe was elected to the first Lok Sabha in 1953, from Mavelikera constitutioncy in Kerala by one of the largest majorities of that election.  \n\nAfter completing his term in the [[Lok Sabha]], in 1957, he was appointed as the Indian Ambassador to [[Sudan]].

He represented the Thiruvalla constituency of Kerala. Matthen was appointed the Indian Ambassador to Sudan after his single term in the Lok Sabha. Before his entry into politics, Matthen was  a businessman with interests in cashew, minerals, insurance, plantations and banking. He was responsible for starting the Alleppey Chamber of Commerce. He was Managing Director of  the Travancore National & Quilon (TN&Q) Bank when it suffered a run of unprecedented length that forced it to close.

C.P. Matthen was extradited from Madras and imprisoned in Trivandrum, allegedly for balance sheet irregularities. He was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment but offered many chances to walk free if he would acknowledge guilt. C.P. Matthen refused these offers, maintaining his innocence for more than three years. He became something of a folk hero for his uncompromising stand. He was released on January 22nd 1942 without condition or explanation and returned to Madras.  \n\n== Early life ==\nCP Matthen was born into a landed Christian family in central Travancore, in [[Kavumbhagom]], Thiruvalla.
