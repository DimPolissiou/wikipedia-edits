It was a symbol of the policy of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was being pursued by the two superpowers at the time. The ASTP involved [[spacecraft docking]] between an [[Apollo command and service module]] (CSM) and the Soviet '''[[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz 19]]''' capsule. The unnumbered Apollo vehicle was left over from the [[canceled Apollo missions]]; it was the last Apollo CSM to fly. The mission is generally considered to mark the end of the [[Space Race]], that had begun in 1957 with the launch of [[Sputnik 1]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K751AwAAQBAJ&pg=PT747|title=Encyclopedia of United States National Security |ISBN=978-0-7619-2927-7 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |editor-first=Richard J. |editor-last=Samuels |editor-link=Richard J.

The pre-flight work provided useful engineering experience for later joint US-Russian space flights, such as the [[Shuttle\u2013Mir Program]] and the [[International Space Station]]. Crewed US space missions ceased for several years following ASTP, resuming in April 1981 with the [[STS-1|first flight]] of the [[Space Shuttle]].\n\n== Historical background ==\n[[File:Nixon Kosygin May 1972.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. President Nixon and [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet Premier]] [[Alexei Kosygin]] (seated) sign an agreement in Moscow paving the way for the Apollo\u2013Soyuz flight, May 1972.]]\nThe purpose and catalyst of the Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project was the policy of [[d\u00e9tente]] between the two [[Cold War]] superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. Prior to this mission, tensions remained high between the two world superpowers while the United States was engaged in the [[Vietnam War]]. Meanwhile, the Soviet press was highly critical of the Apollo space missions, printing \"the armed intrusion of the United States and Saigon puppets into Laos is a shameless trampling underfoot of international law\" over a photograph of the [[Apollo 14]] launch in 1971.<ref name=\"Space Sciences 1976\">Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, Soviet Space Programs, 1971\u201375. Washington: U.S. Govt. Print. Off., 1976.</ref> Although Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] made the Soviet Union's policy of d\u00e9tente official in his 1956 doctrine of peaceful coexistence at the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], the two nations seemed to be in perpetual conflict.\n\nAfter [[John Glenn]]'s 1962 [[Mercury-Atlas 6|orbital flight]], an exchange of letters between President [[John F. Kennedy]] and Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] led to a series of discussions led by NASA Deputy Administrator [[Hugh Latimer Dryden|Hugh Dryden]] and Soviet scientist [[Anatoli Blagonravov]]. Their 1962 talks led to the [[Dryden-Blagonravov agreement]], which was formalized in October of that year, the same time the two countries were in the midst of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. The agreement was formally announced at the United Nations on December 5, 1962. It called for cooperation on the exchange of data from weather satellites, a study of the Earth's magnetic field, and joint tracking of the U.S. [[Project Echo|Echo II balloon satellite]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The First Dryden-Blagonravov Agreement - 1962 |url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4209/ch2-3.htm |website=NASA History Series |publisher=NASA |accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref>. Unfortunately, as the competition between the two nation's crewed space programs heated up, efforts to further cooperation at that point came to an end. \n\nDue to tense relations, space cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union was unlikely in the early 1970s. On June 7, 1971, the USSR had launched the first piloted orbital space station, [[Salyut 1]]. Meanwhile, the United States had launched the [[Apollo 14]] mission several months prior, the third space mission to land humans on the Moon. Each side gave the other little coverage of their achievements.<ref name=\"Space Sciences 1976\" />\n\nBoth sides had severe criticisms of the other side's engineering. Soviet spacecraft were designed with automation in mind; the [[Lunokhod 1]] and [[Luna 16]] were both uncrewed probes, and each [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] had been designed to minimize risk due to human error by having fewer manual controls with which human operators would have to contend during flight. By contrast, the Apollo spacecraft was designed to be operated by humans and required highly trained astronauts in order to operate. The Soviet Union criticized the Apollo spacecraft as being \"extremely complex and dangerous\".<ref name=\"Space Sciences 1976\" />\n\nThe Americans also had their own concerns about Soviet spacecraft. [[Christopher C. Kraft]], director of the [[Johnson Space Center]], criticized the design of the Soyuz: \"We in [[NASA]] rely on redundant components\u2014if an instrument fails during flight, our crews switch to another in an attempt to continue the mission. Each Soyuz component, however, is designed for a specific function; if one fails, the cosmonauts land as soon as possible. The Apollo vehicle also relied on astronaut piloting to a much greater extent than did the Soyuz machine\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ezell|first1=Edward|last2=Ezell|first2=Linda|title=The Partnership: A History of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project|date=1978|chapter=Foreword|chapter-url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-4209/forwrd.htm|publisher=NASA|location=Washington, D.C.|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-4209/toc.htm}}</ref> American and Soviet engineers settled their differences for a possible docking of American and Soviet spacecraft in meetings between June and December 1971 in Houston and Moscow, including [[Bill Creasy]]'s design of the [[Androgynous Peripheral Attach System]] between the two ships that would allow either to be active or passive during docking.<ref name=Battaglia>Debbora Battaglia, \"Arresting Hospitality: the Case of the 'Handshake in Space',\" Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute vol. 18 issue 1 June 2012. p. S76-S89</ref>\n\nWith the close of the Vietnam War, relations between the United States and the USSR began to improve, as did the prognosis for a potential cooperative space mission.<ref name=\"Space Sciences 1976\" /> The Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project was made possible by the thaw in these relations, and the project itself endeavored to amplify and solidify the improving relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. According to Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]], \"The Soviet and American spacemen will go up into outer space for the first major joint scientific experiment in the history of mankind. They know that from outer space our planet looks even more beautiful. It is big enough for us to live peacefully on it, but it is too small to be threatened by nuclear war\".<ref name=\"Space Sciences 1976\" /> Thus, both sides recognized ASTP as a political act of peace.<ref name= Battaglia />\n\nIn October 1970, [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]] president [[Mstislav Keldysh]] responded to [[NASA Administrator]] [[Thomas O. Paine]]'s letter proposing a cooperative space mission, and there was subsequently a meeting to discuss technical details. At a meeting in January 1971, U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]]'s Foreign Policy Adviser [[Henry Kissinger]] enthusiastically espoused plans for the mission, and expressed these views to NASA administrator George M. Low: \"As long as you stick to space, do anything you want to do. You are free to commit\u2014in fact, I want you to tell your counterparts in Moscow that the President has sent you on this mission.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ezell|first1=Edward|last2=Ezell|first2=Linda|title=The Partnership: A History of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project|date=1978|chapter=Chapter 5.

The ASTP was the first Soviet space mission to be televised in a live fashion during the launch, while in space, and during the landing.<ref name=\"Space Sciences 1976\" /> Soyuz 19 was also the first Soviet spacecraft to which a foreign flight crew had access before flight; the Apollo crew were permitted to inspect it and the launch and crew training site, which was an unprecedented sharing of information with Americans about any Soviet space program.\n\nNot all reactions to ASTP were positive. Many Americans feared {{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}that ASTP was giving the USSR too much credit in their space program, putting them on equal footing with the sophisticated space exploration efforts of NASA. More feared that the apparent peaceful cooperation between the USSR and the United States would lull people into believing there was no conflict at all between the two superpowers.<ref name=\"Space Sciences 1976\" /> Soliciting appropriations from the [[United States Congress]] proved to be quite difficult{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}, which was not a problem in the Soviet Union{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}, and the dedication to space exploration demonstrated by the Soviet Union rejected these criticisms{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}.

Although the Soyuz was given a mission designation number (Soyuz 19) as part of the ongoing [[Soyuz programme|Soyuz program]], its radio call sign was simply \"Soyuz\" for the duration of the joint mission. The Apollo mission was not a numbered mission of the [[Apollo program]], and similarly bore the call sign \"Apollo\". Despite this, some of the press and a few NASA web pages have referred to the mission as \"Apollo 18\", but this should not be confused with the [[canceled Apollo missions#Follow-on lunar missions|canceled lunar mission]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/apollo/soyuz.html|title=Apollo-Soyuz|work=nasa.gov}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/journal/missions6.html|title=HEASARC Missions|work=nasa.gov}}</ref><ref>http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/StaffordTP/TPS_BIO.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/BrandVD/BrandVD_Bio.pdf</ref>\n\nThe Apollo spacecraft was launched with a docking module specially designed to enable the two spacecraft to dock with each other, used only once for this mission. The [[Saturn IB]] launch vehicle and CSM were surplus material. Like the [[Apollo Lunar Module]], the docking module [[Transposition, docking, and extraction|had to be retrieved]] from the [[S-IVB]] upper-stage of the Saturn rocket after launch. The docking module was designed as both an airlock \u2014 as the Apollo was pressurized at about {{convert|5|psi|abbr=on}} using pure oxygen, while the Soyuz used a nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere at [[Atmospheric pressure#Mean sea level pressure|sea level pressure]] (about {{cvt|15|psi}}) \u2014  and an adapter, since the surplus Apollo hardware used for the ASTP mission was not equipped with the [[APAS]] docking collar jointly developed by NASA and the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]] for the mission. One end of the docking module was attached to the Apollo using the same \"probe-and-[[drogue]]\" docking mechanism used on the Lunar Module and the [[Skylab]] space station, while its other end had the APAS docking collar, which Soyuz 19 carried in place of the standard Soyuz/Salyut system of the time. The APAS collar fitted onto Soyuz 19 was releasable, allowing the two spacecraft to separate in case of malfunction.\n\nThe Apollo flew with a three-man crew on board: [[Thomas P. Stafford|Tom Stafford]], [[Vance Brand]], and [[Deke Slayton]]. Stafford had already flown into space three times, including within eight [[nautical miles]] of the lunar surface as Commander of [[Apollo 10]], and was the first [[general officer]] to fly into space.<ref>he was a [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the [[United States Air Force]] at the time of the flight; he would retire with three stars in 1979</ref> Slayton was one of the original [[Mercury Seven]] astronauts selected in 1959, but an irregular heartbeat grounded him until 1972. He became head of NASA's astronaut office and, after a lengthy medical program, selected himself for this mission. At the time, Slayton was the oldest person to fly in space and the one with the longest gap between selection as an astronaut and first flight into space. Brand, meanwhile, had trained with the Apollo spacecraft during his time as a backup [[Apollo 15]] command module pilot, and had served two stints as a backup Skylab commander. The closest he had come to flying prior to ASTP was as commander for the [[Skylab Rescue]] mission mustered to potentially retrieve the crew of [[Skylab 3]] due to a fuel leak on that mission's Apollo CSM.\n\nThe Soyuz flew with two men: [[Alexei Leonov]] and [[Valeri Kubasov]]. Leonov became the first man to [[spacewalk|walk in space]] on [[Voskhod 2]] in 1965. Kubasov, who flew on [[Soyuz 6]] in 1969, ran some of the earliest [[space manufacturing]] experiments. Both were to have flown on the ill-fated [[Soyuz 11]] in 1971 (Leonov as commander, Kubasov as the flight engineer), but were grounded because Kubasov was suspected of having [[tuberculosis]]. The two-man crew on the Soyuz was a result of the modifications needed to allow the cosmonauts to wear the [[Sokol pressure suit]] during launch, docking, and reentry.\n\nThe ASTP-class [[Soyuz 7K-TM]] spacecraft used was a variation of the post-Soyuz 11 two-man design, with the batteries replaced by [[solar panel]]s enabling \"solo\" flights (missions not docking to one of the [[Salyut]] space stations). It was designed to operate, during the docking phase, at a reduced nitrogen/oxygen pressure of 10.2 psi, allowing easier transfers between the Apollo and Soyuz. Six ASTP-class Soyuz spacecraft were built in total, including the one used. Before the actual mission, two craft were launched uncrewed as Kosmos satellites. The third was launched as the crewed [[Soyuz 16]] flight as a rehearsal in order to test the APAS docking mechanism. Another craft was used fully fueled as a \"hot backup\" at the launch site \u2013 later it was disassembled. And the sixth craft was available as a \"cold\" backup; it was later used on the [[Soyuz 22|last \"solo\" Soyuz flight]] in 1976, but with the APAS docking adapter replaced by the MKF-6 multispectral camera.\n\n=== Launch and mission ===\n\nThe Soyuz and Apollo flights launched within seven-and-a-half hours of each other on July 15, and docked on July 17. Three hours later, the two mission commanders, Stafford and Leonov, exchanged the first international handshake in space through the open hatch of the Soyuz. NASA had calculated that the historic handshake would have taken place over the British seaside resort of [[Bognor Regis]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.somewhere.org.uk/broadcast/pilgrims/phil/blast.htm|title=Blast-off to Bognor|last=Jones|first=Phillip|accessdate=4 May 2011}}</ref> but a delay resulted in its occurrence being over the city of [[Metz]] in France.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4209/ch11-3.htm|title=The Partnership: A History of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project |author1=Edward Clinton Ezell |author2=Linda Neuman Ezell |year=1978|publisher=NASA|accessdate=4 May 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110524064713/https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4209/ch11-3.htm| archivedate=May 24, 2011| url-status= live}}</ref> During the first crew exchange, the crews were read a statement from Soviet Premier [[Leonid Brezhnev]], and received a phone call from U.S. President [[Gerald Ford]].\n\nWhile the two ships were docked, the three Americans and two Soviets conducted joint scientific experiments, exchanged flags and gifts (including tree seeds which were later planted in the two countries), signed certificates, visited each other's ships, ate together, and conversed in each other's languages. (Because of Stafford's pronounced drawl when speaking Russian, Leonov later joked that there were three languages spoken on the mission: Russian, English, and \"Oklahomski.\") There were also docking and redocking maneuvers, during which the two spacecraft reversed roles and the Soyuz became the \"active\" ship.\n\nAmerican scientists developed four of the experiments performed during the mission. Embryologist [[Jane M. Oppenheimer|Jane Oppenheimer]] analyzed the effects of weightlessness on fish eggs at various stages of development.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/23/us/jane-oppenheimer-dies-at-84-expert-on-embryos-and-space.html|title=Jane Oppenheimer Dies at 84; Expert on Embryos and Space|first=Wolfgang|last=Saxon|date=March 23, 1996|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter 44 hours together, the two ships separated, and maneuvered to use the Apollo to create an artificial [[solar eclipse]] to allow the crew of the Soyuz to take photographs of the solar [[corona]]. Another brief docking was made before the ships went their separate ways. The Soviets remained in space for two more days, and the Americans for five, during which the Apollo crew also conducted Earth observation experiments.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Apollo-Soyuz Imagery.jpg|The Apollo spacecraft, as seen by the Soyuz crew\nFile:Soyuz 19 (Apollo Soyuz Test Project) spacecraft.jpg|Soyuz 19 as seen from the Apollo\nFile:Apollo Soyuz Test Project Mission Control.jpg|Mission control center in Houston during ASTP\nFile:ASTP handshake - cropped.jpg|The historic handshake between Stafford and Leonov\nFile:President Ford talks to ASTP crew.jpg|U.S. President [[Gerald Ford]] speaks to the Soviet and American crews on July 18, 1975\nFile:Apollo-Soyuz Test Project Commemorative Plaque.jpg|The astronauts and cosmonauts assembled this commemorative plaque in orbit as a symbol of the international cooperation\n</gallery>\n\n=== Re-entry and aftermath ===\nThe mission was considered a great success, both technically and as a public-relations exercise for both nations. The only serious problem was during reentry and [[splashdown]] of the Apollo craft, during which the crew were accidentally exposed to toxic [[hydrazine]] and [[nitrogen tetroxide]] fumes, caused by unignited [[reaction control system]] (RCS) [[hypergolic propellant]]s venting from the spacecraft and reentering a cabin air intake. The RCS was inadvertently left on during descent, and the toxic fumes were sucked into the spacecraft as it drew in outside air. Brand briefly lost consciousness, while Stafford retrieved emergency oxygen masks, put one on Brand, and gave one to Slayton. The three astronauts were hospitalized for two weeks in [[Honolulu]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Ezell, Edward Clinton |author2=Ezell, Linda Neuman |year=1978 |title=The Partnership: A History of the Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project |journal=NASA History Series |issue=NASA Special Publication-4209 |publisher=NASA |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4209/ch11-9.htm |accessdate=2009-03-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823124845/https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4209/ch11-9.htm|archivedate=2007-08-23}}</ref> Brand took responsibility for the mishap; because of high noise levels in the cabin during reentry, he believes he was unable to hear Stafford call off one item of the reentry checklist, the closure of two switches which would have automatically shut off the RCS and initiated drogue parachute deployment. These procedures were manually performed later than usual, allowing the ingestion of the propellant fumes through the ventilation system.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RBgsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kMgEAAAAIBAJ&dq=apollo%20gas&pg=993%2C1384026 \"Brand Takes Blame For Apollo Gas Leak\"], ''Florence, AL \u2013 Times Daily newspaper'', Aug. 10, 1975</ref>\n\nThe ASTP was the final flight of an Apollo spacecraft. Immediately after the launch of the Apollo spacecraft, preparations began to convert [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Pad 39B]] and the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] at [[Kennedy Space Center]] for use by the [[Space Shuttle]], the United States' next crewed spacecraft program.  Launch Pad 39A had already been closed after the launch of [[Skylab]].\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n===Technical===\n[[File:S74-24913.jpg|thumb|Apollo-Soyuz painting]]\nA derivative (but mechanically incompatible) docking collar, [[APAS-89]] was launched as part of the [[Kristall]] module of the Soviet [[Mir]] space station.  Originally intended as the docking port for the (defunct) [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]] Soviet space shuttle, the APAS-89 unit was used for the next Russian-American docking mission, [[STS-71]], twenty years later as part of the [[Shuttle\u2013Mir Program]] (though not before the docking port was tested by the last APAS-equipped Soyuz, [[Soyuz TM-16|TM-16]], in 1993).\n\nThe American [[Space Shuttle]] continued to use the same APAS-89 docking hardware through the end of the [[Space Shuttle program]] to dock to Mir and then the [[International Space Station]], the latter through the [[Pressurized Mating Adapter]]s (PMAs).\n\nThe PMAs are equipped with the later [[APAS-95]] adapters, which differ from the APAS-89 adapters in that they are no longer androgynous; while compatible with the APAS-89 docking collars, they are not capable of acting as the \"active\" partner in docking.\n\nThe first PMA, PMA-1, remains in use as the interface connecting the Russian-built, NASA-owned [[Zarya]] module to the [[US Orbital Segment|US segment of the ISS]], and so the APAS continues in use to this day.\n\n===Political===\nThe Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project was the first joint US-Soviet space mission. At the time it was thought that space would become either more international or competitive as a result, however instead it became both. The mission became symbolic of each country's goals of scientific cooperation, while their individual news reports downplayed the technical prowess of the other. Soviet press implied that it was leading the US in space flight, tying it to [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideology, while the US reported that the Soyuz was technically primitive.<ref>{{cite report|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~ota/disk2/1985/8533/8533.PDF |pages=80\u201381 |publisher=US Congress, Office of Technology Assessment|title=U.S.-Soviet Cooperation in Space |date=July 1985 |accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref> High-profile space cooperation declined after the successful mission and became entangled in [[Linkage (policy)|linkage politics]], however it set a precedent of cooperation that continued in the [[Shuttle\u2013Mir Program]].<ref name=cnn>{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/15/world/space-handshake-anniversary/index.html |title=How historic handshake in space brought superpowers closer |author=Kellie Morgan |publisher=CNN|date=15 July 2015 |accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K_B_VvVp0SIC&pg=PA181|author=James Moltz|title=The Politics of Space Security: Strategic Restraint and the Pursuit of National Interests|page=181 |publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-7858-9}}</ref>\n\n===Cultural===\nThe US and Soviet commanders, Stafford and Leonov, became lasting friends.

It was a symbol of the policy of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was being pursued by the two superpowers at the time. The ASTP involved [[spacecraft docking]] between an [[Apollo command and service module]] (CSM) and the Soviet '''[[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz 19]]''' capsule. The unnumbered Apollo vehicle was left over from the [[canceled Apollo missions]]; it was the last Apollo CSM to fly. The mission is generally considered to mark the end of the [[Space Race]], that had begun in 1957 with the launch of [[Sputnik 1]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K751AwAAQBAJ&pg=PT747|title=Encyclopedia of United States National Security |ISBN=978-0-7619-2927-7 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |editor-first=Richard J. |editor-last=Samuels |editor-link=Richard J.

The pre-flight work provided useful engineering experience for later joint US-Russian space flights, such as the [[Shuttle\u2013Mir Program]] and the [[International Space Station]]. Crewed US space missions ceased for several years following ASTP, resuming in April 1981 with the [[STS-1|first flight]] of the [[Space Shuttle]].\n\n== Historical background ==\n[[File:Nixon Kosygin May 1972.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. President Richard Nixon and [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet Premier]] [[Alexei Kosygin]] (seated) sign an agreement in Moscow paving the way for the Apollo\u2013Soyuz flight, May 1972.]]\nThe purpose and catalyst of the Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project was the policy of [[d\u00e9tente]] between the two [[Cold War]] superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. Prior to this mission, tensions remained high between the two world superpowers while the United States was engaged in the [[Vietnam War]]. Meanwhile, the Soviet press was highly critical of the Apollo space missions, printing \"the armed intrusion of the United States and Saigon puppets into Laos is a shameless trampling underfoot of international law\" over a photograph of the [[Apollo 14]] launch in 1971.<ref name=\"Space Sciences 1976\">Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, Soviet Space Programs, 1971\u201375. Washington: U.S. Govt. Print. Off., 1976.</ref> Although Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]] made the Soviet Union's policy of d\u00e9tente official in his 1956 doctrine of peaceful coexistence at the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], the two nations seemed to be in perpetual conflict.\n\nAfter [[John Glenn]]'s 1962 [[Mercury-Atlas 6|orbital flight]], an exchange of letters between President [[John F. Kennedy]] and Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] led to a series of discussions led by NASA Deputy Administrator [[Hugh Latimer Dryden|Hugh Dryden]] and Soviet scientist [[Anatoli Blagonravov]]. Their 1962 talks led to the [[Dryden-Blagonravov agreement]], which was formalized in October of that year, the same time the two countries were in the midst of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. The agreement was formally announced at the United Nations on December 5, 1962. It called for cooperation on the exchange of data from weather satellites, a study of the Earth's magnetic field, and joint tracking of the U.S. [[Project Echo|Echo II balloon satellite]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The First Dryden-Blagonravov Agreement - 1962 |url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4209/ch2-3.htm |website=NASA History Series |publisher=NASA |accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref>. Unfortunately, as the competition between the two nation's crewed space programs heated up, efforts to further cooperation at that point came to an end. \n\nDue to tense relations, space cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union was unlikely in the early 1970s. On June 7, 1971, the USSR had launched the first piloted orbital space station, [[Salyut 1]]. Meanwhile, the United States had launched the [[Apollo 14]] mission several months prior, the third space mission to land humans on the Moon. Each side gave the other little coverage of their achievements.<ref name=\"Space Sciences 1976\" />\n\nBoth sides had severe criticisms of the other side's engineering. Soviet spacecraft were designed with automation in mind; the [[Lunokhod 1]] and [[Luna 16]] were both uncrewed probes, and each [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] had been designed to minimize risk due to human error by having fewer manual controls with which human operators would have to contend during flight. By contrast, the Apollo spacecraft was designed to be operated by humans and required highly trained astronauts in order to operate. The Soviet Union criticized the Apollo spacecraft as being \"extremely complex and dangerous\".<ref name=\"Space Sciences 1976\" />\n\nThe Americans also had their own concerns about Soviet spacecraft. [[Christopher C. Kraft]], director of the [[Johnson Space Center]], criticized the design of the Soyuz: \"We in [[NASA]] rely on redundant components\u2014if an instrument fails during flight, our crews switch to another in an attempt to continue the mission. Each Soyuz component, however, is designed for a specific function; if one fails, the cosmonauts land as soon as possible. The Apollo vehicle also relied on astronaut piloting to a much greater extent than did the Soyuz machine\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ezell|first1=Edward|last2=Ezell|first2=Linda|title=The Partnership: A History of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project|date=1978|chapter=Foreword|chapter-url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-4209/forwrd.htm|publisher=NASA|location=Washington, D.C.|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-4209/toc.htm}}</ref> American and Soviet engineers settled their differences for a possible docking of American and Soviet spacecraft in meetings between June and December 1971 in Houston and Moscow, including [[Bill Creasy]]'s design of the [[Androgynous Peripheral Attach System]] between the two ships that would allow either to be active or passive during docking.<ref name=Battaglia>Debbora Battaglia, \"Arresting Hospitality: the Case of the 'Handshake in Space',\" Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute vol. 18 issue 1 June 2012. p. S76-S89</ref>\n\nWith the close of the Vietnam War, relations between the United States and the USSR began to improve, as did the prognosis for a potential cooperative space mission.<ref name=\"Space Sciences 1976\" /> The Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project was made possible by the thaw in these relations, and the project itself endeavored to amplify and solidify the improving relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. According to Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]], \"The Soviet and American spacemen will go up into outer space for the first major joint scientific experiment in the history of mankind. They know that from outer space our planet looks even more beautiful. It is big enough for us to live peacefully on it, but it is too small to be threatened by nuclear war\".<ref name=\"Space Sciences 1976\" /> Thus, both sides recognized ASTP as a political act of peace.<ref name= Battaglia />\n\nIn October 1970, [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]] president [[Mstislav Keldysh]] responded to [[NASA Administrator]] [[Thomas O. Paine]]'s letter proposing a cooperative space mission, and there was subsequently a meeting to discuss technical details. At a meeting in January 1971, U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]]'s Foreign Policy Adviser [[Henry Kissinger]] enthusiastically espoused plans for the mission, and expressed these views to NASA administrator George M. Low: \"As long as you stick to space, do anything you want to do. You are free to commit\u2014in fact, I want you to tell your counterparts in Moscow that the President has sent you on this mission.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ezell|first1=Edward|last2=Ezell|first2=Linda|title=The Partnership: A History of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project|date=1978|chapter=Chapter 5.

The ASTP was the first Soviet space mission to be televised in a live fashion during the launch, while in space, and during the landing.<ref name=\"Space Sciences 1976\" /> Soyuz 19 was also the first Soviet spacecraft to which a foreign flight crew had access before flight; the Apollo crew were permitted to inspect it and the launch and crew training site, which was an unprecedented sharing of information with Americans about any Soviet space program.\n\nNot all reactions to ASTP were positive.

Although the Soyuz was given a mission designation number (Soyuz 19) as part of the ongoing [[Soyuz programme|Soyuz program]], its radio call sign was simply \"Soyuz\" for the duration of the joint mission. The Apollo mission was not a numbered mission of the [[Apollo program]], and similarly bore the call sign \"Apollo\". Despite this, some of the press and a few NASA web pages have referred to the mission as \"Apollo 18\", but this should not be confused with the [[canceled Apollo missions#Follow-on lunar missions|canceled lunar mission]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/apollo/soyuz.html|title=Apollo-Soyuz|work=nasa.gov}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/journal/missions6.html|title=HEASARC Missions|work=nasa.gov}}</ref><ref>http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/StaffordTP/TPS_BIO.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/BrandVD/BrandVD_Bio.pdf</ref>\n\nThe Apollo spacecraft was launched with a docking module specially designed to enable the two spacecraft to dock with each other, used only once for this mission. The [[Saturn IB]] launch vehicle and CSM were surplus material. Like the [[Apollo Lunar Module]], the docking module [[Transposition, docking, and extraction|had to be retrieved]] from the [[S-IVB]] upper-stage of the Saturn rocket after launch. The docking module was designed as both an airlock \u2014 as the Apollo was pressurized at about {{convert|5|psi|abbr=on}} using pure oxygen, while the Soyuz used a nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere at [[Atmospheric pressure#Mean sea level pressure|sea level pressure]] (about {{cvt|15|psi}}) \u2014  and an adapter, since the surplus Apollo hardware used for the ASTP mission was not equipped with the [[APAS]] docking collar jointly developed by NASA and the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]] for the mission. One end of the docking module was attached to the Apollo using the same \"probe-and-[[drogue]]\" docking mechanism used on the Lunar Module and the [[Skylab]] space station, while its other end had the APAS docking collar, which Soyuz 19 carried in place of the standard Soyuz/Salyut system of the time. The APAS collar fitted onto Soyuz 19 was releasable, allowing the two spacecraft to separate in case of malfunction.\n\nThe Apollo flew with a three-man crew on board: [[Thomas P. Stafford|Tom Stafford]], [[Vance Brand]], and [[Deke Slayton]]. Stafford had already flown into space three times, including within eight [[nautical miles]] of the lunar surface as Commander of [[Apollo 10]], and was the first [[general officer]] to fly into space.<ref>he was a [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the [[United States Air Force]] at the time of the flight; he would retire with three stars in 1979</ref> Slayton was one of the original [[Mercury Seven]] astronauts selected in 1959, but an irregular heartbeat grounded him until 1972. He became head of NASA's astronaut office and, after a lengthy medical program, selected himself for this mission. At the time, Slayton was the oldest person to fly in space and the one with the longest gap between selection as an astronaut and first flight into space. Brand, meanwhile, had trained with the Apollo spacecraft during his time as a backup [[Apollo 15]] command module pilot, and had served two stints as a backup Skylab commander. The closest he had come to flying prior to ASTP was as commander for the [[Skylab Rescue]] mission mustered to potentially retrieve the crew of [[Skylab 3]] due to a fuel leak on that mission's Apollo CSM.\n\nThe Soyuz flew with two men: [[Alexei Leonov]] and [[Valeri Kubasov]]. Leonov became the first man to [[spacewalk|walk in space]] on [[Voskhod 2]] in 1965. Kubasov, who flew on [[Soyuz 6]] in 1969, ran some of the earliest [[space manufacturing]] experiments. Both were to have flown on the ill-fated [[Soyuz 11]] in 1971 (Leonov as commander, Kubasov as the flight engineer), but were grounded because Kubasov was suspected of having [[tuberculosis]]. The two-man crew on the Soyuz was a result of the modifications needed to allow the cosmonauts to wear the [[Sokol pressure suit]] during launch, docking, and reentry.\n\nThe ASTP-class [[Soyuz 7K-TM]] spacecraft used was a variation of the post-Soyuz 11 two-man design, with the batteries replaced by [[solar panel]]s enabling \"solo\" flights (missions not docking to one of the [[Salyut]] space stations). It was designed to operate, during the docking phase, at a reduced nitrogen/oxygen pressure of 10.2 psi, allowing easier transfers between the Apollo and Soyuz. Six ASTP-class Soyuz spacecraft were built in total, including the one used. Before the actual mission, two craft were launched uncrewed as Kosmos satellites. The third was launched as the crewed [[Soyuz 16]] flight as a rehearsal in order to test the APAS docking mechanism. Another craft was used fully fueled as a \"hot backup\" at the launch site \u2013 later it was disassembled. And the sixth craft was available as a \"cold\" backup; it was later used on the [[Soyuz 22|last \"solo\" Soyuz flight]] in 1976, but with the APAS docking adapter replaced by the MKF-6 multispectral camera.\n\n=== Launch and mission ===\n\nThe Soyuz and Apollo flights launched within seven-and-a-half hours of each other on July 15, and docked on July 17. Three hours later, the two mission commanders, Stafford and Leonov, exchanged the first international handshake in space through the open hatch of the Soyuz. NASA had calculated that the historic handshake would have taken place over the British seaside resort of [[Bognor Regis]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.somewhere.org.uk/broadcast/pilgrims/phil/blast.htm|title=Blast-off to Bognor|last=Jones|first=Phillip|accessdate=4 May 2011}}</ref> but a delay resulted in its occurrence being over the city of [[Metz]] in France.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4209/ch11-3.htm|title=The Partnership: A History of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project |author1=Edward Clinton Ezell |author2=Linda Neuman Ezell |year=1978|publisher=NASA|accessdate=4 May 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110524064713/https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4209/ch11-3.htm| archivedate=May 24, 2011| url-status= live}}</ref> During the first crew exchange, the crews were read a statement from Soviet Premier [[Leonid Brezhnev]], and received a phone call from U.S. President [[Gerald Ford]].\n\nWhile the two ships were docked, the three Americans and two Soviets conducted joint scientific experiments, exchanged flags and gifts (including tree seeds which were later planted in the two countries), signed certificates, visited each other's ships, ate together, and conversed in each other's languages. (Because of Stafford's pronounced drawl when speaking Russian, Leonov later joked that there were three languages spoken on the mission: Russian, English, and \"Oklahomski.\") There were also docking and redocking maneuvers, during which the two spacecraft reversed roles and the Soyuz became the \"active\" ship.\n\nAmerican scientists developed four of the experiments performed during the mission. Embryologist [[Jane M. Oppenheimer|Jane Oppenheimer]] analyzed the effects of weightlessness on fish eggs at various stages of development.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/23/us/jane-oppenheimer-dies-at-84-expert-on-embryos-and-space.html|title=Jane Oppenheimer Dies at 84; Expert on Embryos and Space|first=Wolfgang|last=Saxon|date=March 23, 1996|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter 44 hours together, the two ships separated, and maneuvered to use the Apollo to create an artificial [[solar eclipse]] to allow the crew of the Soyuz to take photographs of the solar [[corona]]. Another brief docking was made before the ships went their separate ways. The Soviets remained in space for two more days, and the Americans for five, during which the Apollo crew also conducted Earth observation experiments.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Apollo-Soyuz Imagery.jpg|The Apollo spacecraft, as seen by the Soyuz crew\nFile:Soyuz 19 (Apollo Soyuz Test Project) spacecraft.jpg|Soyuz 19 as seen from the Apollo\nFile:Apollo Soyuz Test Project Mission Control.jpg|Mission control center in Houston during ASTP\nFile:ASTP handshake - cropped.jpg|The historic handshake between Stafford and Leonov\nFile:President Ford talks to ASTP crew.jpg|U.S. President [[Gerald Ford]] speaks to the Soviet and American crews on July 18, 1975\nFile:Apollo-Soyuz Test Project Commemorative Plaque.jpg|The astronauts and cosmonauts assembled this commemorative plaque in orbit as a symbol of the international cooperation\n</gallery>\n\n=== Re-entry and aftermath ===\nThe mission was considered a great success, both technically and as a public-relations exercise for both nations. The only serious problem was during reentry and [[splashdown]] of the Apollo craft, during which the crew were accidentally exposed to toxic [[hydrazine]] and [[nitrogen tetroxide]] fumes, caused by unignited [[reaction control system]] (RCS) [[hypergolic propellant]]s venting from the spacecraft and reentering a cabin air intake. The RCS was inadvertently left on during descent, and the toxic fumes were sucked into the spacecraft as it drew in outside air. Brand briefly lost consciousness, while Stafford retrieved emergency oxygen masks, put one on Brand, and gave one to Slayton. The three astronauts were hospitalized for two weeks in [[Honolulu]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Ezell, Edward Clinton |author2=Ezell, Linda Neuman |year=1978 |title=The Partnership: A History of the Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project |journal=NASA History Series |issue=NASA Special Publication-4209 |publisher=NASA |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4209/ch11-9.htm |accessdate=2009-03-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823124845/https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4209/ch11-9.htm|archivedate=2007-08-23}}</ref> Brand took responsibility for the mishap; because of high noise levels in the cabin during reentry, he believes he was unable to hear Stafford call off one item of the reentry checklist, the closure of two switches which would have automatically shut off the RCS and initiated drogue parachute deployment. These procedures were manually performed later than usual, allowing the ingestion of the propellant fumes through the ventilation system.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RBgsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kMgEAAAAIBAJ&dq=apollo%20gas&pg=993%2C1384026 \"Brand Takes Blame For Apollo Gas Leak\"], ''Florence, AL \u2013 Times Daily newspaper'', Aug. 10, 1975</ref>\n\nThe ASTP was the final flight of an Apollo spacecraft. Immediately after the launch of the Apollo spacecraft, preparations began to convert [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Pad 39B]] and the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] at [[Kennedy Space Center]] for use by the [[Space Shuttle]], the United States' next crewed spacecraft program.  Launch Pad 39A had already been closed after the launch of [[Skylab]].\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n===Technical===\n[[File:S74-24913.jpg|thumb|Apollo-Soyuz painting]]\nA derivative (but mechanically incompatible) docking collar, [[APAS-89]] was launched as part of the [[Kristall]] module of the Soviet [[Mir]] space station.  Originally intended as the docking port for the (defunct) [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]] Soviet space shuttle, the APAS-89 unit was used for the next Russian-American docking mission, [[STS-71]], twenty years later as part of the [[Shuttle\u2013Mir Program]] (though not before the docking port was tested by the last APAS-equipped Soyuz, [[Soyuz TM-16|TM-16]], in 1993).\n\nThe American [[Space Shuttle]] continued to use the same APAS-89 docking hardware through the end of the [[Space Shuttle program]] to dock to Mir and then the [[International Space Station]], the latter through the [[Pressurized Mating Adapter]]s (PMAs).\n\nThe PMAs are equipped with the later [[APAS-95]] adapters, which differ from the APAS-89 adapters in that they are no longer androgynous; while compatible with the APAS-89 docking collars, they are not capable of acting as the \"active\" partner in docking.\n\nThe first PMA, PMA-1, remains in use as the interface connecting the Russian-built, NASA-owned [[Zarya]] module to the [[US Orbital Segment|US segment of the ISS]], and so the APAS continues in use to this day.\n\n===Political===\nThe Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project was the first joint US-Soviet space mission. At the time it was thought that space would become either more international or competitive as a result, however instead it became both. The mission became symbolic of each country's goals of scientific cooperation, while their individual news reports downplayed the technical prowess of the other. Soviet press implied that it was leading the US in space flight, tying it to [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideology, while the US reported that the Soyuz was technically primitive.<ref>{{cite report|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~ota/disk2/1985/8533/8533.PDF |pages=80\u201381 |publisher=US Congress, Office of Technology Assessment|title=U.S.-Soviet Cooperation in Space |date=July 1985 |accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref> High-profile space cooperation declined after the successful mission and became entangled in [[Linkage (policy)|linkage politics]], however it set a precedent of cooperation that continued in the [[Shuttle\u2013Mir Program]].<ref name=cnn>{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/15/world/space-handshake-anniversary/index.html |title=How historic handshake in space brought superpowers closer |author=Kellie Morgan |publisher=CNN|date=15 July 2015 |accessdate=13 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K_B_VvVp0SIC&pg=PA181|author=James Moltz|title=The Politics of Space Security: Strategic Restraint and the Pursuit of National Interests|page=181 |publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-7858-9}}</ref>\n\n===Cultural===\nThe US and Soviet commanders, Stafford and Leonov, became lasting friends.

He started sailing in the French Royal Navy in 1774 as a boy, serving on the corvette ''Fl\u00e8che'', the frigates ''Flore'' and ''Sultane'', and the ship of the line {{ship|French ship|Tonnant|1740|2}} in 1778.<ref name=quintin340>Quintin, p. 340</ref> He took part in the [[Battle of Grenada]].<ref name=quintin341>Quintin, p. 341</ref>\n\nSenez was then employed in the merchant navy and on various [[privateer]]s.<ref name=quintin341 /> On 3 February 1794, he joined the Navy of the Republic as an [[Enseigne de vaisseau non entretenu]] on the fluyt ''Dordogne'' in a squadron under Captain [[Corentin Urbain Leiss\u00e8gues|Leiss\u00e8gues]], tasked with retaking [[Guadeloupe]] from the British. On 11 July 1794, he was given command of Fort de l'Union at Guadeloupe.<ref name=quintin341 />\n\nPromoted to Lieutenant on 8 October 1794, he was appointed to the command of corvette [[French corvette D\u00e9cius (1795)|''D\u00e9cius'']]. In November 1796, ''D\u00e9cius'', {{ship|French brig|Vaillante|1793|2}}, and three schooners sailed for a raid on British-held [[Anguilla]]. On 27 November, {{HMS|Lapwing|1785|6}} intercepted the flotilla, destroying ''Vaillante'' and capturing ''D\u00e9cius'', only to scuttle her the next day to escape two French frigates.<ref name=quintin341 />\n\nFreed by 2 January 1798, Senez was promoted to Commander (''Capitaine de fr\u00e9gate'') and given command of {{ship|French corvette|V\u00e9nus |1794|2}}. On 9 October 1799, Senez transfered to the corvette {{ship|French corvette|Berceau|1794|2}}. On 13 July 1800, ''Berceau'' engaged two Portuguese corvettes and five Letters or Marque, sinking one corvette and capturing four of the privateers. He fought a notable [[USS Boston vs Berceau|action against USS ''Boston'']] on 13 October 1800, where he was taken prisoner.<ref name=quintin341 />\n\nReturned from America, Senez was promoted to Captain 2nd class on 24 September 1803 and given command of the frigate {{ship|French frigate|Cyb\u00e8le|2}}.<ref name=quintin341 /> On 29 August, he was given command of the [[74-gun]] {{ship|French ship|Bor\u00e9e|1805|2}} and fought in several campaigns, notably [[Ganteaume's expedition to Corfu]] and the [[Battle of Maguelone]] in October 1809.<ref name=quintin342>Quintin, p. 342</ref> On 5 February 1804, he was made a Knight of the [[Legion of Honour]], and on 14 June, promoted to Officer.<ref name=quintin342 /> \n\nIn January 1813, Senez was given command of {{ship|French ship|Ville de Marseille|1812|2}}.
