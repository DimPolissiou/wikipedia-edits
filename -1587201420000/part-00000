When the [[Indian National Congress]] had its first meeting in Bombay (Mumbai), two leaders from Rajahmundry, Nyapathi Subba Rao and Kandukuri Veeresalingam, participated in it. Subba Rao, founder of Hindu Samaj in Rajahmundry, was also one of the six founders of India's noted English daily, ''[[The Hindu]]''.\n\nThe Renaissance of Andhra Pradesh started in Rajahmundry. [[Kandukuri Veeresalingam]] is known as the Father of reforms in Andhra Pradesh. He started a monthly magazine Vivekavardhini, and a school for girls at [[Dowleswaram]] in 1874. The first widow remarriage took place on 11 December 1881. A society with 16 members was started on 22 June 1884, which used to look after widow remarriages in Rajahmundry. The town hall was established in 1890 by Veeresalingam. [[Bipin Chandra Pal]] visited Rajahmundry in April 1905 during the Vandemataram Movement. During his visits, he used to address the public in \"Pal Chowk\" (the present-day Kotipalli Bus Stand). [[Annie Besant]] visited Rajahmundry twice. First, she came during the foundations of a branch of the Divya Gyan Samaj at Alcot Gardens were being laid. She came again during the opening ceremony. Ramakrishna Mission was established in the city during 1950\u201351 near Kambal tank. The place is now the Ayakar Bhavan.\n\nRajahmundry is acclaimed as the birthplace of the [[Telugu language]]\u2014its grammar and script evolved from the pen of the city-born poet [[Nannayya]]. Also known as '\u0100di Kavi' (the first poet) of Telugu, Nannayya, along with [[Tikkana]] and [[Yerrana]], translated the [[Sanskrit]] version of [[Mahabharata]] into Telugu. Kandukuri Veeresalingam \u2013 a social reformer and the author of Rajashekhara Charithra, the first Telugu novel \u2013 was also from Rajahmundry.\n\n== Geography ==\n{{See also|List of cities in Andhra Pradesh}}\n\nRajamahendravaram is located at {{Coord|16.98|N|81.78|E|}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/02/Rajahmundry.html|title=Maps, Weather, and Airports for Rajamahendravaram, India|work=fallingrain.com}}</ref> with an average elevation of {{convert|14|m}}.

When the [[Indian National Congress]] had its first meeting in Bombay (Mumbai), two leaders from Rajahmundry, Nyapathi Subba Rao and Kandukuri Veeresalingam, participated in it. Subba Rao, founder of Hindu Samaj in Rajahmundry, was also one of the six founders of India's noted English daily, ''[[The Hindu]]''.\n\nThe Renaissance of Andhra Pradesh started in Rajahmundry. [[Kandukuri Veeresalingam]] is known as the Father of reforms in Andhra Pradesh. He started a monthly magazine Vivekavardhini, and a school for girls at [[Dowleswaram]] in 1874. The first widow remarriage took place on 11 December 1881. A society with 16 members was started on 22 June 1884, which used to look after widow remarriages in Rajahmundry. The town hall was established in 1890 by Veeresalingam. [[Bipin Chandra Pal]] visited Rajahmundry in April 1905 during the Vandemataram Movement. During his visits, he used to address the public in \"Pal Chowk\" (the present-day Kotipalli Bus Stand). [[Annie Besant]] visited Rajahmundry twice. First, she came during the foundations of a branch of the Divya Gyan Samaj at Alcot Gardens were being laid. She came again during the opening ceremony. Ramakrishna Mission was established in the city during 1950\u201351 near Kambal tank. The place is now the Ayakar Bhavan.\n\nRajahmundry is acclaimed as the birthplace of the [[Telugu language]]\u2014its grammar and script evolved from the pen of the city-born poet [[Nannayya]]. Also known as '\u0100di Kavi' (the first poet) of Telugu, Nannayya, along with [[Tikkana]] and [[Yerrana]], translated the [[Sanskrit]] version of [[Mahabharata]] into Telugu. Kandukuri Veeresalingam \u2013 a social reformer and the author of Rajashekhara Charithra, the first Telugu novel \u2013 was also from Rajahmundry.\n\n== Geography ==\n{{See also|List of cities in Andhra Pradesh}}\n\nRajamahendravaram is located at {{Coord|16.98|N|81.78|E|}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/02/Rajahmundry.html|title=Maps, Weather, and Airports for Rajamahendravaram, India|work=fallingrain.com}}</ref> with an average elevation of {{convert|14|m}}.

It received 12 nominations for the [[45th C\u00e9sar Awards]], the most nominations of any eligible film, and eventually won the awards for [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Adaptation|Best Adaptation]], [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]], and [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. \n\n''An Officer and a Spy'' is Polanski's first film to be shot after he was expelled from the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|AMPAS]] under the new \"ethical standards\" of the post-[[Me Too movement|Me Too]] era. The director's perceived impunity in Europe made the release of the film, and the accolades it won in Italy and France, controversial.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film centres on the notorious 19th century [[Dreyfus affair]].

In [[Cellular respiration#Aerobic respiration|aerobic respiration]], the flow of electrons terminates with molecular [[oxygen]] being the final electron acceptor. In [[anaerobic respiration]] other electron acceptors exist such as [[sulfate]].\n\nIn the electron transport chain, the redox reactions are driven by the [[Gibbs free energy]] state of the components. Gibbs free energy is related to a quantity called the redox potential. The complexes in the electron transport chain harvest the energy of the redox reactions, that occur when transferring electrons from a low redox potential to a higher redox potential, to create an electrochemical gradient. It is the electrochemical gradient created that drives the synthesis of ATP via coupling with [[oxidative phosphorylation]] with [[ATP synthase]].<ref name=\"Anraku 101\u2013132\">{{Cite journal|last=Anraku|first=Yasuhiro|date=June 1988|title=Bacterial Electron Transport Chains|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.bi.57.070188.000533|journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry|language=en|volume=57|issue=1|pages=101\u2013132|doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.57.070188.000533|issn=0066-4154}}</ref>\n\nThe electron transport chain, and site of oxidative phosphorylation is found on the [[inner mitochondrial membrane]].

The associated electron transport chain is\n\n'''NADH''' \u2192''' ''Complex I'' '''\u2192 '''Q''' \u2192''' ''Complex III'' '''\u2192 '''cytochrome ''c'' '''\u2192''' ''Complex IV'' '''\u2192 '''O<sub>2</sub>'''\nwhere ''Complexes I, III'' and'' IV'' are proton pumps, while Q and cytochrome ''c'' are mobile electron carriers. The electron acceptor is molecular oxygen.\n\nIn [[prokaryotes]] ([[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]) the situation is more complicated, because there are several different electron donors and several different electron acceptors. The generalized electron transport chain in bacteria is:\n\n                      '''Donor'''            '''Donor'''                    '''Donor'''\n                        \u2193                \u2193                        \u2193\n                  '''dehydrogenase'''   \u2192   '''quinone'''   \u2192  ''' ''bc<sub>1</sub>'' '''  \u2192   '''cytochrome'''\n                                         \u2193                        \u2193\n                                 '''oxidase(reductase)'''       '''oxidase(reductase)'''\n                                         \u2193                        \u2193\n                                      '''Acceptor'''                 '''Acceptor'''\n\nElectrons can enter the chain at three levels: at the level of a [[dehydrogenase]], at the level of the quinone pool, or at the level of a mobile [[cytochrome]] electron carrier. These levels correspond to successively more positive redox potentials, or to successively decreased potential differences relative to the terminal electron acceptor.  In other words, they correspond to successively smaller Gibbs free energy changes for the overall redox reaction ''Donor \u2192 Acceptor''.\n\nIndividual bacteria use multiple electron transport chains, often simultaneously. Bacteria can use a number of different electron donors, a number of different dehydrogenases, a number of different oxidases and reductases, and a number of different electron acceptors.  For example, ''E. coli'' (when growing aerobically using glucose as an energy source) uses two different NADH dehydrogenases and two different quinol oxidases, for a total of four different electron transport chains operating simultaneously.\n\nA common feature of all electron transport chains is the presence of a proton pump to create an electrochemical gradient over a membrane. Bacterial electron transport chains may contain as many as three proton pumps, like mitochondria, or they may contain only one or two. They always contain at least one proton pump.\n\n====Electron donors====\nIn the present day biosphere, the most common electron donors are organic molecules. Organisms that use organic molecules as an electron source are called ''[[organotroph]]s''. Organotrophs (animals, fungi, protists) and ''[[phototrophs]]'' (plants and algae) constitute the vast majority of all familiar life forms.\n\nSome prokaryotes can use inorganic matter as an energy source. Such an organism is called a ''[[lithotroph]]'' (\"rock-eater\"). Inorganic electron donors include hydrogen, carbon monoxide, ammonia, nitrite, sulfur, sulfide, manganese oxide, and ferrous iron. Lithotrophs have been found growing in rock formations thousands of meters below the surface of Earth. Because of their volume of distribution, lithotrophs may actually outnumber organotrophs and phototrophs in our biosphere.\n\nThe use of inorganic electron donors as an energy source is of particular interest in the study of evolution. This type of metabolism must logically have preceded the use of organic molecules as an energy source.\n\n====Complex I and II====\nBacteria can use a number of different electron donors. When organic matter is the energy source, the donor may be NADH or succinate, in which case electrons enter the electron transport chain via NADH dehydrogenase (similar to ''Complex I'' in mitochondria) or succinate dehydrogenase (similar to ''Complex II'').  Other dehydrogenases may be used to process different energy sources: formate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, H<sub>2</sub> dehydrogenase ([[hydrogenase]]), electron transport chain. Some dehydrogenases are also proton pumps; others funnel electrons into the quinone pool. Most dehydrogenases show induced expression in the bacterial cell in response to metabolic needs triggered by the environment in which the cells grow.  In the case of lactate dehydrogenase in E.coli, the enzyme is used aerobically and in combination with other dehydrogenases. It is inducible and is expressed when there is high concentration of DL- lactate present in the cell.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=March 1965|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nyas.1965.118.issue-19|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=118|issue=19 Ionic Conduc|doi=10.1111/nyas.1965.118.issue-19|issn=0077-8923}}</ref>\n\n====Quinone carriers====\n[[Quinone]]s are mobile, lipid-soluble carriers that shuttle electrons (and protons) between large, relatively immobile macromolecular complexes embedded in the membrane. Bacteria use [[ubiquinone]] (Coenzyme Q, the same quinone that mitochondria use) and related quinones such as [[menaquinone]] (Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>). Archaea in the genus ''[[Sulfolobus]]'' use caldariellaquinone.<ref>{{EC number|1.3.5.1}}</ref> The use of different quinones is due to slighlty altered redox potentials.

Protons can be physically moved across a membrane; this is seen in mitochondrial ''Complexes I'' and ''IV''. The same effect can be produced by moving electrons in the opposite direction. The result is the disappearance of a proton from the cytoplasm and the appearance of a proton in the periplasm. Mitochondrial ''Complex III'' uses this second type of proton pump, which is mediated by a quinone (the [[Q cycle]]).\n\nSome dehydrogenases are proton pumps; others are not. Most oxidases and reductases are proton pumps, but some are not. Cytochrome ''bc<sub>1</sub>'' is a proton pump found in many, but not all, bacteria (it is not found in ''E. coli''). As the name implies, bacterial ''bc<sub>1</sub>'' is similar to mitochondrial ''bc<sub>1</sub>'' (''Complex III'').\n\n====Cytochrome electron carriers====\n[[Cytochromes]] are pigments that contain iron. They are found in two very different environments.\n\nSome cytochromes are water-soluble carriers that shuttle electrons to and from large, immobile macromolecular structures imbedded in the membrane. The mobile cytochrome electron carrier in mitochondria is cytochrome ''c''. Bacteria use a number of different mobile cytochrome electron carriers.\n\nOther cytochromes are found within macromolecules such as ''Complex III'' and ''Complex IV''. They also function as electron carriers, but in a very different, intramolecular, solid-state environment.\n\nElectrons may enter an electron transport chain at the level of a mobile cytochrome or quinone carrier. For example, electrons from inorganic electron donors (nitrite, ferrous iron, electron transport chain.) enter the electron transport chain at the cytochrome level. When electrons enter at a redox level greater than NADH, the electron transport chain must operate in reverse to produce this necessary, higher-energy molecule.\n\n====Terminal oxidases and reductases====\nWhen bacteria grow in [[Cellular respiration#Aerobic respiration|aerobic]] environments, the terminal electron acceptor (O<sub>2</sub>) is reduced to water by an enzyme called an ''oxidase''. When bacteria grow in [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] environments, the terminal electron acceptor is reduced by an enzyme called a reductase. In mitochondria the terminal membrane complex (''Complex IV'') is cytochrome oxidase. [[Cellular respiration#Aerobic respiration|Aerobic]] bacteria use a number of different terminal oxidases. For example, ''E. coli'' (a facultative anaerobe) does not have a cytochrome oxidase or a ''bc<sub>1</sub>'' complex. Under aerobic conditions, it uses two different terminal quinol oxidases (both proton pumps) to reduce oxygen to water.\n\nBacterial Complex IV can be split into classes according to the molecules act as terminal electron acceptors. Class I oxidases are cytochrome oxidases and use oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. Class II oxidases are Quinol oxidases and can use a variety of terminal electron acceptors. Both of these classes can be subdivided into catergories based on what redox active components they contain. E.g. Heme aa3 Class 1 terminal oxidases are much more efficient than Class 2 terminal oxidases<ref name=\"Anraku 101\u2013132\"/>\n\n[[Anaerobic organism|Anaerobic bacteria]], which do not use oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor, have terminal reductases individualized to their terminal acceptor. For example, ''E. coli'' can use fumarate reductase, nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, DMSO reductase, or trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase, depending on the availability of these acceptors in the environment.\n\nMost terminal oxidases and reductases are ''inducible''. They are synthesized by the organism as needed, in response to specific environmental conditions.\n\n====Electron acceptors====\nJust as there are a number of different electron donors (organic matter in organotrophs, inorganic matter in lithotrophs), there are a number of different electron acceptors, both organic and inorganic. In aerobic bacteria and facultative anaerobes if oxygen is available, it is invariably used as the terminal electron acceptor, because it generates the greatest Gibbs free energy change and produces the most energy.<ref name=\"Schmidt-Rohr 20\">Schmidt-Rohr, K.

In [[anaerobic respiration]] other electron acceptors exist such as [[sulfate]].\n\nIn the electron transport chain, the redox reactions are driven by the [[Gibbs free energy]] state of the components. Gibbs free energy is related to a quantity called the redox potential. The complexes in the electron transport chain harvest the energy of the redox reactions, that occur when transferring electrons from a low redox potential to a higher redox potential, to create an electrochemical gradient.

The electron acceptor is molecular oxygen.\n\nIn [[prokaryotes]] ([[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]) the situation is more complicated, because there are several different electron donors and several different electron acceptors. The generalized electron transport chain in bacteria is:\n\n                      '''Donor'''            '''Donor'''                    '''Donor'''\n                        \u2193                \u2193                        \u2193\n                  '''dehydrogenase'''   \u2192   '''quinone'''   \u2192  ''' ''bc<sub>1</sub>'' '''  \u2192   '''cytochrome'''\n                                         \u2193                        \u2193\n                                 '''oxidase(reductase)'''       '''oxidase(reductase)'''\n                                         \u2193                        \u2193\n                                      '''Acceptor'''                 '''Acceptor'''\n\nElectrons can enter the chain at three levels: at the level of a [[dehydrogenase]], at the level of the quinone pool, or at the level of a mobile [[cytochrome]] electron carrier. These levels correspond to successively more positive redox potentials, or to successively decreased potential differences relative to the terminal electron acceptor.  In other words, they correspond to successively smaller Gibbs free energy changes for the overall redox reaction ''Donor \u2192 Acceptor''.\n\nIndividual bacteria use multiple electron transport chains, often simultaneously. Bacteria can use a number of different electron donors, a number of different dehydrogenases, a number of different oxidases and reductases, and a number of different electron acceptors.  For example, ''E. coli'' (when growing aerobically using glucose as an energy source) uses two different NADH dehydrogenases and two different quinol oxidases, for a total of four different electron transport chains operating simultaneously.\n\nA common feature of all electron transport chains is the presence of a proton pump to create an electrochemical gradient over a membrane. Bacterial electron transport chains may contain as many as three proton pumps, like mitochondria, or they may contain only one or two. They always contain at least one proton pump.\n\n====Electron donors====\nIn the present day biosphere, the most common electron donors are organic molecules. Organisms that use organic molecules as an electron source are called ''[[organotroph]]s''. Organotrophs (animals, fungi, protists) and ''[[phototrophs]]'' (plants and algae) constitute the vast majority of all familiar life forms.\n\nSome prokaryotes can use inorganic matter as an energy source. Such an organism is called a ''[[lithotroph]]'' (\"rock-eater\"). Inorganic electron donors include hydrogen, carbon monoxide, ammonia, nitrite, sulfur, sulfide, manganese oxide, and ferrous iron. Lithotrophs have been found growing in rock formations thousands of meters below the surface of Earth. Because of their volume of distribution, lithotrophs may actually outnumber organotrophs and phototrophs in our biosphere.\n\nThe use of inorganic electron donors as an energy source is of particular interest in the study of evolution. This type of metabolism must logically have preceded the use of organic molecules as an energy source.\n\n====Complex I and II====\nBacteria can use a number of different electron donors. When organic matter is the energy source, the donor may be NADH or succinate, in which case electrons enter the electron transport chain via NADH dehydrogenase (similar to ''Complex I'' in mitochondria) or succinate dehydrogenase (similar to ''Complex II'').  Other dehydrogenases may be used to process different energy sources: formate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, H<sub>2</sub> dehydrogenase ([[hydrogenase]]), electron transport chain. Some dehydrogenases are also proton pumps; others funnel electrons into the quinone pool. Most dehydrogenases show induced expression in the bacterial cell in response to metabolic needs triggered by the environment in which the cells grow.  In the case of lactate dehydrogenase in E.coli, the enzyme is used aerobically and in combination with other dehydrogenases. It is inducible and is expressed when there is high concentration of DL- lactate present in the cell.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=March 1965|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nyas.1965.118.issue-19|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=118|issue=19 Ionic Conduc|doi=10.1111/nyas.1965.118.issue-19|issn=0077-8923}}</ref>\n\n====Quinone carriers====\n[[Quinone]]s are mobile, lipid-soluble carriers that shuttle electrons (and protons) between large, relatively immobile macromolecular complexes embedded in the membrane. Bacteria use [[ubiquinone]] (Coenzyme Q, the same quinone that mitochondria use) and related quinones such as [[menaquinone]] (Vitamin K<sub>2</sub>). Archaea in the genus ''[[Sulfolobus]]'' use caldariellaquinone.<ref>{{EC number|1.3.5.1}}</ref> The use of different quinones is due to slighlty altered redox potentials. These changes in redox potential are caused by changes in structure of quinone. The Change in redox potentials of these quinones may be suited to changes in the electron acceptors or variations of redox potentials in bacterial complexes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ingledew|first=W J|last2=Poole|first2=R K|date=1984|title=The respiratory chains of Escherichia coli.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mmbr.48.3.222-271.1984|journal=Microbiological Reviews|volume=48|issue=3|pages=222\u2013271|doi=10.1128/mmbr.48.3.222-271.1984|issn=0146-0749}}</ref>\n\n====Proton pumps====\nA ''[[proton pump]]'' is any process that creates a [[proton gradient]] across a membrane. Protons can be physically moved across a membrane; this is seen in mitochondrial ''Complexes I'' and ''IV''. The same effect can be produced by moving electrons in the opposite direction. The result is the disappearance of a proton from the cytoplasm and the appearance of a proton in the periplasm. Mitochondrial ''Complex III'' uses this second type of proton pump, which is mediated by a quinone (the [[Q cycle]]).\n\nSome dehydrogenases are proton pumps; others are not. Most oxidases and reductases are proton pumps, but some are not. Cytochrome ''bc<sub>1</sub>'' is a proton pump found in many, but not all, bacteria (it is not found in ''E. coli''). As the name implies, bacterial ''bc<sub>1</sub>'' is similar to mitochondrial ''bc<sub>1</sub>'' (''Complex III'').\n\n====Cytochrome electron carriers====\n[[Cytochromes]] are pigments that contain iron. They are found in two very different environments.\n\nSome cytochromes are water-soluble carriers that shuttle electrons to and from large, immobile macromolecular structures imbedded in the membrane. The mobile cytochrome electron carrier in mitochondria is cytochrome ''c''. Bacteria use a number of different mobile cytochrome electron carriers.\n\nOther cytochromes are found within macromolecules such as ''Complex III'' and ''Complex IV''. They also function as electron carriers, but in a very different, intramolecular, solid-state environment.\n\nElectrons may enter an electron transport chain at the level of a mobile cytochrome or quinone carrier. For example, electrons from inorganic electron donors (nitrite, ferrous iron, electron transport chain.) enter the electron transport chain at the cytochrome level. When electrons enter at a redox level greater than NADH, the electron transport chain must operate in reverse to produce this necessary, higher-energy molecule.\n\n====Terminal oxidases and reductases====\nWhen bacteria grow in [[Cellular respiration#Aerobic respiration|aerobic]] environments, the terminal electron acceptor (O<sub>2</sub>) is reduced to water by an enzyme called an ''oxidase''. When bacteria grow in [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] environments, the terminal electron acceptor is reduced by an enzyme called a reductase. In mitochondria the terminal membrane complex (''Complex IV'') is cytochrome oxidase. [[Cellular respiration#Aerobic respiration|Aerobic]] bacteria use a number of different terminal oxidases. For example, ''E. coli'' (a facultative anaerobe) does not have a cytochrome oxidase or a ''bc<sub>1</sub>'' complex. Under aerobic conditions, it uses two different terminal quinol oxidases (both proton pumps) to reduce oxygen to water.\n\nBacterial Complex IV can be split into classes according to the molecules act as terminal electron acceptors. Class I oxidases are cytochrome oxidases and use oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. Class II oxidases are Quinol oxidases and can use a variety of terminal electron acceptors. Both of these classes can be subdivided into catergories based on what redox active components they contain. E.g. Heme aa3 Class 1 terminal oxidases are much more efficient than Class 2 terminal oxidases<ref name=\"Anraku 101\u2013132\"/>\n\n[[Anaerobic organism|Anaerobic bacteria]], which do not use oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor, have terminal reductases individualized to their terminal acceptor. For example, ''E. coli'' can use fumarate reductase, nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, DMSO reductase, or trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase, depending on the availability of these acceptors in the environment.\n\nMost terminal oxidases and reductases are ''inducible''. They are synthesized by the organism as needed, in response to specific environmental conditions.\n\n====Electron acceptors====\nJust as there are a number of different electron donors (organic matter in organotrophs, inorganic matter in lithotrophs), there are a number of different electron acceptors, both organic and inorganic. In aerobic bacteria and facultative anaerobes if oxygen is available, it is invariably used as the terminal electron acceptor, because it generates the greatest Gibbs free energy change and produces the most energy.<ref name=\"Schmidt-Rohr 20\">Schmidt-Rohr, K. (2020). \"Oxygen Is the High-Energy Molecule Powering Complex Multicellular Life: Fundamental Corrections to Traditional Bioenergetics\u201d ''ACS Omega'' '''5''': 2221-2233.  http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.9b03352</ref>\n\nIn anaerobic environments, different electron acceptors are used, including nitrate, nitrite, ferric iron, sulfate, carbon dioxide, and small organic molecules such as fumarate.\n\n==Photosynthetic==\n{{Further|Light-dependent reaction|Photosynthetic reaction center}}\nIn [[oxidative phosphorylation]], electrons are transferred from a low-energy electron donor such as NADH to an acceptor such as O<sub>2</sub>) through an electron transport chain. In [[photophosphorylation]], the energy of sunlight is used to ''create'' a high-energy electron donor which can subsequently reduce redox active components. These components are then coupled to ATP synthesis via proton translocation by the electron transport chain.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nPhotosynthetic electron transport chains, like the mitochondrial chain, can be considered as a special case of the bacterial systems. They use mobile, lipid-soluble quinone carriers ([[phylloquinone]] and [[plastoquinone]]) and mobile, water-soluble carriers ([[cytochrome]]s, electron transport chain.). They also contain a [[proton pump]]. The proton pump in ''all'' photosynthetic chains resembles mitochondrial ''Complex III''. The commonly-held theory of [[symbiogenesis]] believes that both organelles decended from bacteria.\n\n==See also==\n*[[CoRR hypothesis]]\n*[[Electron equivalent]]\n*[[Hydrogen hypothesis]]\n*[[Respirasome]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{cite book|author=Fenchel T|author2=King GM |author3=Blackburn TH |title=Bacterial Biogeochemistry: The Ecophysiology of Mineral Cycling|edition=2nd|publisher=Elsevier|date=September 2006|isbn=978-0-12-103455-9}}\n*{{cite book|isbn=978-0-632-05357-5|author=Lengeler JW|editor1=Drews G|editor2=Schlegel HG |title=Biology of the Prokaryotes|publisher=Blackwell Science|date=January 1999}}\n*{{cite book|author=Nelson DL|author2=Cox MM|title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry|edition=4th|publisher=W.

During the session, Adams, Brown, Chisholm, Halliwell and Stephenson were selected for a band initially named \"Touch\".<ref name=\"official timeline\" /> The group moved to a house in [[Maidenhead]], [[Berkshire]], and spent most of 1994 practising songs which had been written for them by Bob Herbert's long-time associates [[John Thirkell]] and Erwin Keiles.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rob |first1=McGibbon |title=Spice Power: The Inside Story |date=1997 |page=52}}</ref> During the first two months, they worked on [[Demo (music)|demos]] at South Hill Park Recording Studios in [[Bracknell, Berkshire|Bracknell]] with producer/studio owner Michael Sparkes and songwriter/arranger [[Tim Hawes]]. According to Stephenson, the material the group was given was \"very, very young pop\";<ref name=\"Sinclair 2004 book\">Sinclair (2004), p. 29</ref> one of the songs they recorded, \"Sugar and Spice\", would be the source of their final band name. They also worked on various dance routines at the Trinity Studios in [[Knaphill]], near [[Woking]], [[Surrey]]. A few months into the training period, Stephenson was fired from the group and replaced with [[Emma Bunton]].<ref>Sinclair (2004). According to Bob Herbert, she was fired because \"she just wasn't fitting in... she would never have gelled with it and I had to tell her to go\". (Sinclair, p. 30). Stephenson later challenged Herbert's claim, stating that it was her decision to leave due to her mother being diagnosed with [[breast cancer]]. Adams later dismissed this claim, saying she \"just couldn't be arsed\" to put in the work the rest of the group was doing. (Sinclair, p. 31)</ref> It was also during this time that Halliwell came up with the band name Spice.<ref name=\"official timeline\" />\n\nThe group felt insecure about the lack of a contract and was frustrated by the direction in which Heart Management was steering them. In October 1994, armed with a catalogue of demos and dance routines, they began touring management agencies. They persuaded Bob Herbert to set up a showcase performance for the group in front of industry writers, producers, and [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] men in December 1994 at the Nomis Studios, where they received an \"overwhelmingly positive\" reaction.<ref>Sinclair (2004), p. 33</ref> Due to the large interest in the group, the Herberts quickly set about creating a binding contract for them. Encouraged by the reaction they had received at the Nomis showcase, all five members delayed signing contracts on legal advice from, among others, Adams's father.<ref name=\"Sinclair 2004\">Sinclair (2004)</ref>\n\nIn March 1995, the group parted from Heart Management due to their frustration with the company's unwillingness to listen to their visions and ideas. To ensure they kept control of their own work, they allegedly stole the master recordings of their discography from the management offices.<ref name=\"Sinclair 2004\"/><ref name=\"shampoo\" /> That same day, the group tracked down [[Sheffield]]-based producer [[Eliot Kennedy]], who had been present at the showcase, and persuaded him to work with them. They were introduced to record producers [[Absolute (production team)|Absolute]], who in turn brought them to the attention of [[Simon Fuller]] of [[19 Entertainment]], who signed them to his company in March 1995. During the summer of that year, the group toured record labels in London and Los Angeles with Fuller, signing a deal with [[Virgin Records]] in September 1995. Their name was changed to Spice Girls, as [[Spice 1|a rapper]] was already using the name \"Spice\".<ref name=\"official timeline\" /> From this point on until the summer of 1996, the group continued to write and record tracks for their debut album while extensively touring the west coast of the US, where they signed a publishing deal with Windswept Pacific.<ref name=\"Sinclair 2004\"/>\n\n===1996\u20131997: ''Spice'' and breakthrough===\n{{Main|Spice (album)}}\n[[File:Spice Girls live West MacLaren 1997.jpg|240px|thumb|right|The Spice Girls performing \"[[Say You'll Be There]]\" at the [[McLaren]] party in 1997]]\nOn 7 July 1996, the Spice Girls released their debut single \"[[Wannabe]]\" in the United Kingdom.

During the session, Adams, Brown, Chisholm, Halliwell and Stephenson were selected for a band initially named \"Touch\".<ref name=\"official timeline\" /> The group moved to a house in [[Maidenhead]], [[Berkshire]], and spent most of 1994 practising songs which had been written for them by Bob Herbert's long-time associates [[John Thirkell]] and Erwin Keiles.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rob |first1=McGibbon |title=Spice Power: The Inside Story |date=1997 |page=52}}</ref> During the first two months, they worked on [[Demo (music)|demos]] at South Hill Park Recording Studios in [[Bracknell, Berkshire|Bracknell]] with producer/studio owner Michael Sparkes and songwriter/arranger [[Tim Hawes]]. According to Stephenson, the material the group was given was \"very, very young pop\";<ref name=\"Sinclair 2004 book\">Sinclair (2004), p. 29</ref> one of the songs they recorded, \"Sugar and Spice\", would be the source of their final band name. They also worked on various dance routines at the Trinity Studios in [[Knaphill]], near [[Woking]], [[Surrey]]. A few months into the training period, Stephenson was fired from the group and replaced with [[Emma Bunton]].<ref>Sinclair (2004). According to Bob Herbert, she was fired because \"she just wasn't fitting in... she would never have gelled with it and I had to tell her to go\". (Sinclair, p. 30). Stephenson later challenged Herbert's claim, stating that it was her decision to leave due to her mother being diagnosed with [[breast cancer]]. Adams later dismissed this claim, saying she \"just couldn't be arsed\" to put in the work the rest of the group was doing. (Sinclair, p. 31)</ref> It was also during this time that Halliwell came up with the band name Spice.<ref name=\"official timeline\" />\n\nThe group felt insecure about the lack of a contract and was frustrated by the direction in which Heart Management was steering them. In October 1994, armed with a catalogue of demos and dance routines, they began touring management agencies. They persuaded Bob Herbert to set up a showcase performance for the group in front of industry writers, producers, and [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] men in December 1994 at the Nomis Studios, where they received an \"overwhelmingly positive\" reaction.<ref>Sinclair (2004), p. 33</ref> Due to the large interest in the group, the Herberts quickly set about creating a binding contract for them. Encouraged by the reaction they had received at the Nomis showcase, all five members delayed signing contracts on legal advice from, among others, Adams's father.<ref name=\"Sinclair 2004\">Sinclair (2004)</ref>\n\nIn March 1995, the group parted from Heart Management due to their frustration with the company's unwillingness to listen to their visions and ideas. To ensure they kept control of their own work, they allegedly stole the master recordings of their discography from the management offices.<ref name=\"Sinclair 2004\"/><ref name=\"shampoo\" /> That same day, the group tracked down [[Sheffield]]-based producer [[Eliot Kennedy]], who had been present at the showcase, and persuaded him to work with them. They were introduced to record producers [[Absolute (production team)|Absolute]], who in turn brought them to the attention of [[Simon Fuller]] of [[19 Entertainment]], who signed them to his company in March 1995. During the summer of that year, the group toured record labels in London and Los Angeles with Fuller, signing a deal with [[Virgin Records]] in September 1995. Their name was changed to Spice Girls, as [[Spice 1|a rapper]] was already using the name \"Spice\".<ref name=\"official timeline\" /> From this point on until the summer of 1996, the group continued to write and record tracks for their debut album while extensively touring the west coast of the US, where they signed a publishing deal with Windswept Pacific.<ref name=\"Sinclair 2004\"/>\n\n===1996\u20131997: ''Spice'' and breakthrough===\n{{Main|Spice (album)}}\n[[File:Spice Girls live West MacLaren 1997.jpg|240px|thumb|right|The Spice Girls performing \"[[Say You'll Be There]]\" at the [[McLaren]] party in 1997]]\nOn 7 July 1996, the Spice Girls released their debut single \"[[Wannabe]]\" in the United Kingdom.
