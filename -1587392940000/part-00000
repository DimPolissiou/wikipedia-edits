Nawruz followed a [[Scorched earth|scorching earth]] strategy in winter in order to halt advance of Ilkhan's armies, which proved effective when Baydu returned to west with half of the army in 1290.

[[Singapore]]'s first [[President of Singapore|President]], [[Yusof bin Ishak]] and Singapore's first [[Prime Minister]], [[Lee Kuan Yew]], were seated with members of the government at the grandstand on the steps of [[City Hall]]. When the parade began, six military contingents (including the Singapore Infantry Regiment, Singapore Police Defense Force and the then Republic of Singapore Police), a mobile column from the SIR, and various schools and civil contingents marched past City Hall and then into the city streets. Three military bands accompanied the parade inspection and later the march past with military music. The Singapore Fire Brigade also took part in this first parade with its firetrucks included in the mobile column. Rounding it all was a massed lion and dragon dance performance from drum and dragon troupes nationwide.\n\nThe following year in 1967, the contingents increased to 76, including those of the then established Singapore Armed Forces, the RSP and more cultural groups, with the addition of more civil marching groups.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19670810-1.2.90|title=PARADE SPARKLER!|website=eresources.nlb.gov.sg|access-date=2019-03-09}}</ref> The reason is partly due to the introduction of the National Service program in the military and police forces, and later extended to the Fire Brigade, later called the Singapore Fire Services in the 1970s.<!-- The NS Bill was signed into law only in March 1967, not sure if this sentence here is a synthesis of ideas/comments, opinion or a fact. --> Street performances by various groups also debuted in that year's parade.

Almost all of the venues lasted for an hour and all of them even had route marches on the streets to the participating venues.\n\nBy the time the NDP was held at the National Stadium (for the first time) in 1976, the NDP Guard of Honour, composed of officers and personnel of the SAF and the Singapore Police Force made its first appearance, followed after the parade proper by the very first evening presentations by various groups, a prelude to future evening NDPs in 1980 and from 1984 onward. 1977's parade was a decentralized event like two years before (and like 1968's was affected by wet weather) while 1978 returned to Padang. 1979's parade saw another decentralized site, this time being held in many high schools and sports stadiums nationwide. The decentralized format would later be used until 1983, which was currently the final time NDP was held in multiple venues until 2015.\n\nThe 15th installment in 1980 was the first parade to introduce the [[feu de joie]] of the Guard-of-Honour contingents. The following year, SPF Civil Defense Command, presently the Singapore Civil Defense Force, later combined with the SFS in 1989, made its inaugural appearance, followed by the SCDF in 1982. The 1981 parade was held in both Jurong and Queenstown Sports Stadiums for further increase public attendance and participation in the celebrations. In 1982, the parade returned at Padang, marked the first time the mobile column drove past after the marchpast had concluded, thus making it a predecessor to the parades at the Padang from 1995 onward, once every five years.\n\nThe 1984 installment featured many firsts in commemoration with the Singapore's Silver Jubilee of self-governance, which for the first time, introduced a theme song \"Stand Up for Singapore\", and included a bigger Mobile Column, the first appearance of the popular Silent Precision Drill Squad from the [[Singapore Armed Forces Military Police Command]] and the first evening fireworks display.\n\nThe 1986 edition was the first parade held in the late evening, and the first to use flashlights for audience use. Other introductions were featured over the years such as the first appearance of the massed military bands of the SAF (1987), the [[card stunt]] (1988), and the [[Singapore Armed Forces Parachute Team|Red Lions]] parachute team and the daylight fireworks (1989). In 1989, the parade was held on the afternoon but was later revert to the evening format since 1991.\n\nIn 1993, interactive participation by the public debuted in that year's edition to increase public participation and awareness of the parade as an important part of Singaporean life and as a symbol of national unity and identity. In 1997, a National Education Show was also introduced where Primary Five students from a selected number of schools attended in one of the rehearsals.\n\nIn 2003, due to overcrowding of tickets, the [[electronic voting]] ticketing system was introduced as a countermeasure, and a ballot was conducted where citizens stand a chance at winning the tickets by registering their e-mail addresses or mobile numbers such as the NDP websites or phone lines.\n\nThe 2006 installment marked the final time the [[Former National Stadium, Singapore|National Stadium in Kallang]] was held before the stadium went for retrofitting works and thus relocating the parade to the new venue to [[The Float @ Marina Bay]] and held its inaugural parade the following year.<ref>{{cite news |title=2007 NDP to be held on floating platform at Marina Bay |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/173754/1/.html |accessdate=7 August 2018 |publisher=[[Channel NewsAsia]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603160220/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/173754/1/.html |archive-date=3 June 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> Starting in 2008, the NDP is also aired all over the Asia-Pacific region through [[CNA (news channel)|CNA]], and since 2012, it was simulcast to other internet web-streaming websites such as [[Toggle (website)|Toggle]], [[xinmsn]] (defunct since 2015), and [[YouTube]] (along with the parade's official channel, NDPeeps). 2009 featured, for the first time, an integrated show including the parade segment, known as the Pre-parade show (usually not broadcast on television). 2009 was currently the last time to feature multiple theme songs (English and Chinese versions, or originals)\n\nThe 2013 installment featured a spin-off reality competition aired on [[Channel 5 (Singapore)|Channel 5]], titled ''Sing a Nation'', which featured ten different groups who performed various songs for a chance at a lead performance for the 2013's parade.

Between 1966 and 1974, the venue was located in the central area to bring the parade closer to the people. In 1976, the parade was held for the first time at the [[Former National Stadium, Singapore|Former National Stadium]], where the much larger capacity allowed for more to view the parade live.\n\nAlthough offering about 60,000 seats in the National Stadium, the demand for tickets remained high, resulting in several attempts to decentralise the venue to bring the celebration closer to more Singaporeans. From 1975 to 1983, celebrations were alternated between a decentralised event and one centred at the Padang or stadium. From 1984, the parade was held twice at the stadium before being brought back to the Padang. This three-year cycle was repeated up to 1994, before it changed to five-years on an announcement in 1995.\n\nThe Padang, although historically important, posed a greater logistical challenge and also offered fewer seats for spectators. The event and rehearsals also required the closing of surrounding roads. There was a need to construct temporary spectator stands around the field. The site, however, was the only feasible venue for the mobile column, as the heavy vehicles could not be driven onto the stadium track. The Padang was used as the main performance venue for the 2005 parade, with fringe activities decentralised to [[Marina South]], [[Jurong East]], [[Yishun]] and [[Tampines]]. Several alternate locations were mooted, including the utilization of the Padang, which is physically bigger and less likely to disrupt daily functions in the city.\n\nOn 16 October 2005, it was announced that the 2006 NDP would be held at the old stadium for the last time before moving to [[The Float @ Marina Bay]]. The 130 by 100 metre platform would be used for the next five years until the new stadium is completed. Despite offering a [[seating capacity]] of only 27,000, almost less than half the capacity for the National Stadium, there was a vast area for about another 150,000 spectators along the [[Marina Bay, Singapore|Marina Bay]] waterfront.\n\nAfter a ten-year hiatus, the 2016 edition of NDP officially returned to the new [[National Stadium, Singapore|National Stadium]], and 2017 saw the parade returning to Marina Bay, therefore returning to a modified form of the 1980s parades. Given the huge public reception of the Marina Bay parades, The Float, soon to be renamed NS Square, will be expanded starting in 2021 for future parades as a potential permanent parade venue, alternating with the Padang every five years (2020 was the first year to break the pattern since 1985, as the site previously held in 2019 prior because of celebrating the nation's bicentennial anniversary).\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year||Venue||Theme||Slogan/Tagline||Organiser\n!Creative Director\n|-\n|1966\u20131974||[[Padang, Singapore|Padang]]||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||\n|\n|-\n|1975|||Decentralised Sites|||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||\n|\n|-\n|1976||[[Former National Stadium, Singapore|National Stadium]]||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||2nd Singapore Infantry Brigade\n|\n|-\n|1977||Decentralised sites||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||\n|\n|-\n|1978||Padang||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||\n|\n|-\n|1979||Decentralised sites||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||\n|\n|-\n|1980||National Stadium||Courtesy \u2013 Our Way of Life||||\n|\n|-\n|1981||Decentralised sites||||Energy is Precious \u2013 Save It||&nbsp;\n|\n|-\n|1982||Padang||&nbsp;||||2nd Singapore Infantry Brigade\n|\n|-\n|1983||Decentralised sites||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;\n|\n|-\n|1984||Padang||25 Years of Nation Building, 1959\u20131984||Reach Out Singapore||3rd Singapore Infantry Brigade\n|\n|-\n|1985||rowspan=2|National Stadium||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||7th Singapore Infantry Brigade\n|\n|-\n|1986||&nbsp;||rowspan=2|Together...Excellence for Singapore||2nd Singapore Infantry Brigade\n|\n|-\n|1987||Padang||&nbsp;||3rd Singapore Infantry Brigade\n|\n|-\n|1988||rowspan=2|National Stadium||&nbsp;||rowspan=2|Excellence Together, Singapore Forever|| Singapore Artillery\n|\n|-\n|1989||&nbsp;||2nd Singapore Infantry Brigade\n|\n|-\n|1990||Padang||One People, One Nation, One Singapore|| 25 Years of Nationhood and Another 25 Years of Achievements||HQ Armour\n|\n|-\n|1991||rowspan=2|National Stadium||&nbsp;||rowspan=2|My Singapore||HQ Singapore Combat Engineers\n|\n|-\n|1992||&nbsp;||Singapore Air Defense Artillery\n|\n|-\n|1993||Padang||Nation on Parade||rowspan=4|My Singapore, My Home||HQ Armour\n|\n|-\n|1994||National Stadium||&nbsp;||7th Singapore Infantry Brigade\n|\n|-\n|1995||Padang||30 Years of Nationhood / A Nation in Harmony||HQ Armour\n|\n|-\n|1996||rowspan=4|National Stadium||&nbsp;||HQ Singapore Combat Engineers\n|\n|-\n|1997||Our Singapore, Our Future||NDP 1997 Musical Extravanganza||Singapore Artillery\n|\n|-\n|1998||&nbsp;||Our Singapore, Our Future||7th Singapore Infantry Brigade\n|\n|-\n| 1999||Our People||rowspan=3|Together We Make The Difference||6th Division\n|\n|-\n| 2000||Padang||&nbsp;||3rd Division\n|\n|-\n| 2001||rowspan=4|National Stadium||Building Bridges, Forging Futures||9th Division/Infantry\n|\n|-\n| 2002||A Caring Nation||rowspan=3|Together, A New Singapore||HQ Armour\n|Dick Lee\n|-\n| 2003||A Cohesive Society||HQ Singapore Guards\n|Glenn Goei\n|-\n| 2004||A Progressive Society||6th Division\n|Glenn Goei\n|-\n| 2005||Padang||40 Years of Nation Building||The Future is Ours to Make||3rd Division\n|Glenn Goei\n|-\n| 2006||National Stadium||Our Global City, Our Home||&nbsp;||HQ Singapore Guards\n|Glenn Goei\n|-\n| 2007||rowspan=3|[[The Float at Marina Bay|Marina Bay Floating Platform]]||City of Possibilities||&nbsp;||HQ Singapore Combat Engineers\n|Goh Boon Teck\n|-\n| 2008||Celebrating the Singapore Spirit||&nbsp;||HQ Singapore Guards\n|Goh Boon Teck\n|-\n| 2009||Come Together \u2013 Reaching Out \u2022 Reaching Up||&nbsp;||3rd Division\n|Ivan Heng\n|-\n| 2010||Padang||Live Our Dreams, Fly Our Flag||&nbsp;||HQ Armour\n|Dick Lee\n|-\n| 2011||rowspan=4|Marina Bay Floating Platform||Majulah!

Even though there had been logos for some previous years' parades, the logos were used exclusively for years of special commemoration, such as silver jubilee of Nation Building (1984) and Independence (1990). Solgans have also be used, such as \"Our Singapore, Our Future\", first used in the 1997 celebrations.\n\nWith the introduction of NDP logos for 1998, every logo henceforth would be designed to suit the themes, in particular the foundation theme of the parade. A tagline, which was previously known as a slogan, was usually added to the logo design. An example was in 2005, where the tagline for NDP 2005 was \"The Future is Ours to Make\", was placed on the theme \"40 Years of Nation Building\". These taglines are usually taken from previous National Day Rallies for the purpose of rallying the nation together on 9 August to meet the challenges ahead. The tagline \"Together We Make The Difference\" was introduced in 1999 due to the launch of the Singapore 21 project, and was replaced by \"Together, A New Singapore\" in 2002 when then-Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]] proposed the \"Remaking Singapore\" initiative in the National Day Rally 2001.\n\nMost of the logos uses a majority of red color, however in 2007, blue has taken over the traditional red to symbolise the water around the [[Marina Bay, Singapore|Marina Bay]] area. Regardless, the logos are important to note that the themes and taglines are largely different; and it is the theme that the parade or Show segment, on in some cases (2009 and 2015), both will be based on.\n\n==Parade sequence==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nAlthough the programme and sequence of the parade do change over the years, several components and the overall flow of the parade have remained intact for the past four decades. With the shifting of venues for some editions of the parade, or in cases such as wet weather, programmes may have to cancel or introduce slight modifications in order to suit the changes, for instance the Mobile Column, which is only possible both at the Padang site and at Marina Bay.\n\n===Stage and backdrop design===\n===Pre-parade===\nThe pre-parade segment today may include mass-displays, choir performances, school band displays, [[Parachuting|sky-diving]] displays, and other light-hearted performances to entertain the crowd prior to the parade proper, with the added positive effect of encouraging parade-attendees to be seated earlier. Initially introduced on an ad-hoc basis as an informal filler, it has since became an integral part of the parade particularly when live television coverage was extended to this segment in recent years. As audience participation has become a part of the parade, the pre-parade segment also becomes an opportunity for the hosts to lead and rehearse with the audience actions they may have to do when the parade proper begins.\n\nMotivators from [[Lawrence Khong#TOUCH Community Services|TOUCH Community Services]] were introduced to the pre-parade in 2002 (then called Anchor Talents). TOUCH Community Services has since moved on to mentoring students from the various [[Institute of Technical Education|Institutes of Technical Education (ITEs)]] and various Polytechnics since 2003 until the present, under the Leadership & Mentoring programme. Colorful costumes and dance moves have been designed for the motivators.\n\n===Parade and ceremonies===\nThe parade has been a traditional segment of the National Day Parade. Participants of the parade include members of the [[Singapore Armed Forces]], [[Singapore Police Force]], [[Singapore Civil Defence Force]], representatives of the [[People's Action Party]], different labour unions (including members of the National Trades Union Congress) and Ministries as well as students in uniformed groups (such as the National Cadet Corps, [[National Police Cadet Corps]], [[National Civil Defence Cadet Corps]], the Singapore Red Cross, the Boys' and Girls' Brigades, the Scouts Association, the Girl Guides and St. John Ambulance Brigade) and representatives of various Singapore business entities.\n\nParticipants are split into two main sections: the Guard-of-Honour contingents and the Supporting Contingents. The four Guard-of-Honour contingents are made up of members from the three arms of the Singapore Armed Forces (the [[Singapore Army]], represented by the Best Combat Unit, for many years the 1st Commando Battalion of the [[Singapore Armed Forces Commando Formation]]; the [[Republic of Singapore Navy]]; and the [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]]) as well as the Singapore Police Force. All members of these contingents are dressed in their respective ceremonial uniforms, known as the No. 1 uniform. Behind the Guard-of-Honour contingents stand the Regimental Colours Party, where the 32 SAF regimental colours are held by a group of officers, known as ensigns, from the Singapore Armed Forces, with their armed escorts (until 1997 Service Regimental Colors from the SAF's three services led the colours party). The 3 State Colours are in between the Navy and Air Force Guard-of-Honour contingents, and are formed by Escorts(Specialists) and Ensigns (Junior Officers). \n\nThe parade's [[military band]]s are from both the [[Singapore Armed Forces|SAF]] and [[Singapore Police Force|SPF]], and in recent years, the [[marching band]]s of both services' cadet organizations (the Singapore NCC Command Band and the NPCC Band) have joined them as well, with the Singapore NCC Command Band being part of the combined band since 2010. Before the 1994 creation of the SAF Bands the different service arms of the SAF fielded their own bands, and the massed bands for the parade were, since the early 1970s, from a select band of the SAF and the Singapore Police Force Band (inter-service massed bands would only happen in 1987).\n\nThe parade traditionally starts with the Parade Regimental Sergeant Major (Parade RSM) forming up the parade on either the Padang, the field of the National Stadium or in front of the Marina Bay grandstand. The command of the parade is handed over to the Parade Commander once the parade has been formed up and properly dressed accordingly. Typically, both the Parade RSM and the Parade Commander come from the SAF, and usually hold a minimum rank of Master Warrant Officer, and Lieutenant Colonel respectively. Upon sizing and forming up the parade to full formation, the Parade Commander will wait for the arrival of the members of Parliament, members of the Cabinet and the [[Prime Minister of Singapore]], in that order (the salutes were dropped partially in 2008, and the Prime Minister's salute was dropped the next year). Upon the arrival of each group, the parade will present its salute and present arms, except for the Parliament and Cabinet members, upon which they stand at attention and only the PC salutes them.\n\nLastly once the [[President of Singapore]] has arrived (after the playing of the Presidential Fanfare by the Fanfare Trumpeters of the SAF), the Parade Commander will call for a full (Presidential) salute, during which the National Anthem, [[Majulah Singapura]], will be played accompanied by a fly-past of the State Flag, and from 2011, would also require raising it as well on a separate flagpole. After that (and the following aerial salute by the RSAF), the Parade Commander will request that the President inspects the parade. During this inspection, the President will be accompanied by the Chief of Defence Force and the Parade Commander, and the Army GOH Contingent Commander would later join them once they approach the Guard-of-Honour (recent parades have seen a motorized inspection by the President while riding a Land Rover). A presidential [[21-gun salute]] is also given to the President during this time by a select battery from the [[Singapore Artillery]]. It is customary that the President speaks to some members of the Guard-of-honor contingents as he passes by. After the inspection ends, the President will return to the podium before the Guard-of-honor contingents presents a [[Feu-de-Joie]] led by the Parade Commander.\n\nAt the end of it (with the GOH contingents now at shoulder arms), the Parade Commander will ask the President for permission for the Parade Marchpast to start. 2012's edition formally included an Advance in Review order to the proceedings for the first time.\n\n====Marchpast====\nThe Parade Commander will command the Parade contingents to prepare for the Marchpast, and will then march out of the Parade Grounds, with the bands bringing the rear. In the National Day Parade 2009, there was a City Marchpast where the contingents marched around the Central Business District, with the march ending at the F1 Pit Building. In the National Day Parade 2010, the City Marchpast made its second appearance and this time the Marina Bay area was the venue for this, with the Marina Padang as the final stop on the march past. 2011 saw the reinstatement of the march through the stands moment of the supporting contingents of the SAF, SPF and SCDF (previously done in the 2002 edition and now called the Onward March), and that year the participants of the youth uniformed groups and the civilian contingents marched out in a different way, only for all of them to reunite for the City Marchpast later on. The 2012 edition of the parade, the very first National Day Parade officiated by the [[President of the Republic of Singapore|President]] [[Tony Tan Keng Yam]], had the Onward March which was now done for the second time by all of the youth uniformed groups present while the military and civilian supporting contingents marched out in a different way similar to the march pasts during the 2000 and 2010 editions with all of them rejoining for the City Marchpast to be done later with the GOH contingent battalion to [[Marina Bay Sands]] where the march ended. The Onward March made yet another appearance in the 2014 edition alongside the City Marchpast after the parade proper towards the MBS complex. The City Marchpast made its sixthth consecutive appearance in the 2015 edition and was carried on in 2016 together with the Onward March from the new National Stadium and again from Marina Bay in 2017 and 2018.\n\nIn recent years the order of the march past of the supporting contingents out of the grounds has been altered, with the military and civil uniformed services first to march out, followed by the economic firms, social organizations and the youth uniformed organizations which march last out and then into the platform stands.\n\n====Mobile column, flypast and defence exposition====\nThe first Mobile Column was organized in 1969 which displayed the then newly acquired armour vehicles of the SAF, the RSP's police vehicles and the SCDF's fire trucks. In 1990, after a six-year hiatus, the Mobile Column returned as part of the silver jubilee of Singapore's independence. It has been on show during the more important milestone anniversaries of the nation's birthday, on parades held in Padang every five years, including 2019 and the upcoming 2020 installments.\n\nAlmost every NDP since 1971 (except 2016) has had a flypast segment featuring jet and training aircraft, transports and helicopters from the [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]].\n\nWhenever the NDP is held at The Float in Marina Bay the Mobile Column and flypast both evolve into the multi-platform and multi-service Dynamic Defence Display (D3), with a display of the military defence and public security capabilities of the uniformed services. In lieu of the 2018 D3, as part of the parade and ceremony segment of the program, a special flypast of the RSAF was held in that year's edition to mark its golden jubilee.\n\n===Show segment===\n====Highlights====\nThe spectacular show segment follows the traditional parade and ceremony, and lasts normally for 45 minutes. Following the theme of the parade that year, the Show will feature (aside from a Prologue in recent editions) three to four main Acts that culminates in a Grand Finale, that will usually feature the theme song of that year's parade, followed by the much anticipated fireworks display. The entire parade will end in a chorus of voices singing familiar National Day Songs, mass pledge taking (from 2009 expanded into a national activity) and the singing of the National Anthem. In 2007, the parade broke tradition for having a fireworks display that synchronized with the Sing Singapore medley in the finale. In 2009, for the first time ever, all the segments of the NDP have been merged into one integrated program; this would later be repeated in 2015.\n\nIt has its origins in early NDPs as various mass display items put up by community groups or schools to add colour to the otherwise military parade. These items revolved around the themes of racial harmony, ruggedness among youths etc., which are represented by ethnic dances and mass gymnastics displays. This section evolved over the years to become more theatrical, from the massive flashcard displays that complemented the parade in the 1980s to multimedia projections in recent Shows.\n\nFloat displays also featured prominently in the Show segments of the 1970s and 1980s where floats were designed to promote government campaigns or highlight the works of various public and private companies. This returned in NDP 1998 and in NDP 2005 as a visual representation of Singapore's past 40 years of nation building, with further reappearances at NDP 2009 and at NDP 2010 to symbolize the mixture of peoples that make up Singapore today. Floats would return in the 2015, 2017 and 2019 editions. Boats and floats on the Marina Bay area in view of the crowds were one of the highlights of the 2018 show segment.\n\nParades today, held from dusk to night, end in the climax of [[fireworks]] displays which have become a prominent feature in every parade, which followed by a medley of songs and then reciting the [[Singapore National Pledge|pledge]] and singing \"[[Majulah Singapura]]\". However, in the early parades that were held in the day (from 1965\u201372) and later afternoon to evening NDP editions from 1973 to 1980, 1982 and 1984, mass lion and dragon dance displays are actually the parade finale. Lion and dragon dance troupes from various community centres and clan associations would gather on the field to the resonating sound of drumbeats to put on a fiery display that end the parade on an auspicious note. These troupes later became integral parts of the 1985 and 1988 (evening) NDP editions.\n\n====Participating organizations====\nThough every show would see the participation of an assortment of public and private companies, there are three main anchors taking on each Act in the show segment. They are the Peoples' Association (which involvement started in 1984, and one of the founding participants), the [[Soka Gakkai International|Singapore Soka Association (SSA)]] (active since the 1970s) and the Ministry of Education, which would be represented by an individual institution or a cluster of schools, and also a founding participant of the parades. The latter also provides the Combined Schools Band and the Combined School Choirs, another regular part of the NDP itself, and since the 1970s has been part of the national celebrations. The Ministry also provides the School Display Band for the pre-parade segment of the programme, coming from one of the many schools in the island country pre-selected for performance in the event. Since 2016, volunteers from Team Nila are also involved as Precinct Ushers, Safety Management Aides and, most recently, as pre-show Active Health Ambassadors.\n\n====Multimedia show====\nVarious types of high-tech multimedia equipment are used during the actual show segment since 2003. Various technologies notable include the Projecteur d\u2019Images G\u00e9antes Informatis\u00e9es in 2003, a water-curtain visualization in 2007, and LED Mash in 2008.\n\n===Post-parade===\nPost-parade parties was first televised in 1997 and featured celebrities and performers to celebrate the success of the parade while providing entertainment to the audience awaiting to leave the venue. The parade usually last for an hour and ends with the Chief of Defence Force, the Chairman of that year's NDP EXCO and the organizers to cutting a cake to commemorate the efforts with the participants with speeches of gratitude. The party is now normally anchored by the SAF Music and Drama Company.\n\n==Songs==\n===National Day songs===\nUnder the ''Sing Singapore'' Festival, which inaugurated in 1984, numerous community songs have been composed. Nonetheless, only few National Day songs which struck a chord among Singaporeans continue to be sung annually in the parade. They are collectively known as the Sing Singapore Medley which comes after the fireworks display during the Grand Finale segment, or since 2008, forming the final part of the display.\n\nOther National Day songs continue to be featured during the parade, either in the Pre-Parade segment, Parade and Ceremony segment or used as tunes to accompany the mass displays during the show part of the celebrations. In particular, for the Parade and Ceremony segment, in between the arrivals of Members of Parliament, Cabinet Ministers, the Prime Minister and the President, four songs each of one official language (English, Malay, Mandarin and Tamil) will be performed. In previous years, the final song in English (before the President's arrival) has always been the NDP theme song (in 2007 this was not the case) while in NDP 2008, all the songs performed in the P&C segment (in between arrivals) were all previous NDP theme songs in recent years. (The song tradition would return in 2017, but only in the pre-parade portion and in a different language order, while past theme songs were played during the arrivals.) The music performed during the parades have evolved over the decades, reflecting not just the change of musical influences and styles, but also the country's multi-ethnic character.\n\nThe 2010 P&C songs were three in number, due to the fact that the arrival of the Parliament deputies happened before the parade, and were unique because all the songs sung were in English (one song even had lyrics in the three other major languages).\n\nIn 2011, there was the \"Fun Pack Song\" which went along to the tune of Lady Gaga's 'Bad Romance'. The song was shortly scrapped.\n\nThe 2013's medley saw a record number of NDP songs that featured in this medley, with ten and lasted about five-and-a-half minutes: \"Stand Up For Singapore\", \"We Will Get There\", \"What Do You See\", \"One United People\", \"Turn Up The Love\" (not including NDP songs), \"Home\", \"One People, One Nation, One Singapore\", \"Count On Me Singapore\", \"We Are Singapore\" and \"One Singapore\" (that year's theme song).\n\nIn 2014, it was announced that there would be no new songs produced for National Day for the 2nd time in its long history, and in a historic move by the organizing committee, the classic NDP songs will be sung again. That year's edition saw past NDP theme songs being played during the arrival segments, and broke tradition by having the Sing Singapore Medley sung as the epilogue after the national anthem was played. The Sing Singapore Medley finale was repeated again in the 2015 event, after the Pledge Moment ends. Both cases have now included the 1998 theme song \"Home\" as part of the medley, just as it was the case in 2013.\n\n2016 will see the medley also accompanied by special needs students provided by the seven Voluntary Welfare Organisations of the island country hand-signing for the deaf and hard of hearing who will take part, yet another first. The 1998 theme \"Home\" was sung as well. (Since 1989 a deaf Representative has been present to sign the Pledge for deaf viewers of the event.)\n\n===Theme songs===\nNDP Theme songs were first introduced in 1984, starting with \"Stand Up for Singapore\", and again in the 1985 Parade; \"Count on Me Singapore\" which was performed by Clement Chow at the 1986 Parade. Other notable songs include \"We are Singapore\" (1987\u20131988) and \"One People, One Nation, One Singapore\" (1990).\n\nTheme songs were not prominent in the parades of the 1990s until in 1997, when the song \"Singapore Town\", composed and sung by the SAF Music and Drama Company, was that year's theme song. Only in the 1998 edition did interest in the NDP theme songs rose again with the widely acclaimed song \"[[Home (Kit Chan song)|Home]]\", a song composed by Dick Lee and sung by [[Kit Chan]]. That year's parade feature \"Home\" and one more NDP song, \"City For The World\", sung by the children choir. Its popularity led to the production of the various renditions in 2004, including a rock piece composed by JJ Lin. This is partly to use the platform of the televised national event to increase awareness to new National Day pieces composed for the Sing Singapore Festival held then.\n\nIn 2003, however, a significant split took place when the National Day theme song of that year was not part of ''Sing Singapore'' theme song. Stefanie Sun's \"One United People\" was used as the theme song to better suit the theme of \"A Cohesive Society\" while Sean Wang's \"A Place In My Heart\" was chosen to lead the ''Sing Singapore 2003'' Festival.\n\nBefore 2007, the theme songs come in two languages, the lingua franca in Singapore \u2013 English as well as Mandarin. To promote the songs, music videos that showcase local landmarks and lifestyle are made and shown on national television a month before National Day; the songs will also be played on local airwaves. Legal MP3 downloads are also available on the NDP website from 2010 onwards.\n\nLocal songbirds that made it big in regional music scenes, such as Kaira Gong, Kit Chan, Corrine May, Stefanie Sun and Tanya Chua have been invited back home to perform various National Day theme songs. The winner of ''Singapore Idol'' 2004, Taufik Batisah, became a prominent choice to lead the nation in singing the NDP 2005's theme song \"Reach Out for the Skies\", alongside singer-actress Rui En.\n\nIn 2007, there were two theme songs instead of the usual one. 2009 was the last time a Chinese rendition of the English song was featured.\n\nIn 2013, the National Day Parade theme song will not be sung by renowned local artists but, for the first time, by fellow Singaporeans that join the \"Sing A Nation\" reality-competition organized by MediaCorp for that year's event.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/singapore/story/national-day-2013-song-one-singapore-receives-online-brickbats-and-som | title=National Day 2013 song One Singapore receives online brickbats - and some bouquets | publisher=The Straits Times | date=18 July 2013 | accessdate=22 July 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721165509/http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/singapore/story/national-day-2013-song-one-singapore-receives-online-brickbats-and-som | archive-date=21 July 2013 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20130718-438270.html | title=Netizens slam NDP 2013 song | publisher=AsiaOne | date=20 July 2013 | accessdate=22 July 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301082203/http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20130718-438270.html | archive-date=1 March 2014 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIt would be in 2014 when the NDP will not have another official theme song in a break from tradition for the second time, due to decision made by the organizers. In place of the theme song was three songs were remade into two music videos: \"We Will Get There\" and \"One People, One Nation, One Singapore\" sung by Ann Hussein, [[Rahimah Rahim (singer, born 1955)|Rahimah Rahim]], Gayle Nerva, Farisha Ishak, [[Tay Kewei]] and [[Tabitha Nauser]]; and \"What Do You See\" sung by Fauzie Laily, Jack Ho, Kartik Kunasegaran, Sivadorai \"Rai\" Sellakannu and Shaun Jansen. Dick Lee's 1996 song, \"Big Island\", debuted during the show segment of the parade. The theme song tradition would return in the 2015 installment again until 2018. The 2015 theme song, \"Our Singapore\", was remade as the theme song for 2019, and the 2018's parade features a remake of \"We Are Singapore\", both of which being the theme titles for that year's parade. The most recent installment to feature an original theme song was 2017, \"Because it's Singapore\", which was sung by ''[[Singapore Idol]]'' contestant Jay Lim.\n\nThe list of NDP theme songs are as follows:\n{{plainlist|\n;Table Key \n*{{Color box|#FDFC8F|border=darkgray}} Chinese version {{Color box|#B0E0E6|border=darkgray}} Remake of original music {{Color box|#FF91A4|border=darkgray}} Recognised as a [[List of Singaporean patriotic songs|patriotic song]] \n}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Song\n!Artistes\n|-\n|1984{{ref|1|1}}\n|style=\"background:#FF91A4;\"|\"Stand Up for Singapore\"\n|&nbsp;\n|-\n|1986\n|style=\"background:#FF91A4;\"|\"Count on Me Singapore\"\n|Clement Chow\n|-\n|1987\n|style=\"background:#FF91A4;\"|\"We are Singapore\"\n|Jonathan Tan, Roslinda Baharudin, Anne Weerapass and Robert Fernando\n|-\n|1990\n|style=\"background:#FF91A4;\"|\"One People, One Nation, One Singapore\"\n|\n|-\n|1991\n|\"It's the Little Things\"\n|&nbsp;\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|1998\n|\"[[Home (Kit Chan song)|Home]]\"\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Kit Chan]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FDFC8F;\"|\"\u5bb6\"<br>(''Ji\u0101'')\n|-\n|\"City for the World\"\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1999\n|\"Together\"\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Evelyn Tan]] & Dreamz FM|\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FDFC8F;\"|\"\u5fc3\u8fde\u5fc3\"<br>(''X\u012bn li\u00e1n x\u012bn'')\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2000\n|\"Shine on Me\"\n|Jai Wahab\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FDFC8F;\"|\"\u661f\u6708\"<br>(''X\u012bng yu\u00e8'')\n|[[Mavis Hee]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2001\n|\"[[Where I Belong (Tanya Chua song)|Where I Belong]]\"\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Tanya Chua]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FDFC8F;\"|\"\u5c5e\u4e8e\"<br>(''Sh\u01d4y\u00fa'')\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2002\n|\"We Will Get There\"\n|rowspan=4|[[Stefanie Sun]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FDFC8F;\"|\"\u4e00\u8d77\u8d70\u5230\"<br>(''Y\u012bq\u01d0 z\u01d2u d\u00e0o'')\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2003\n|\"One United People\"\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FDFC8F;\"|\"\u5168\u5fc3\u5168\u610f\"<br>(''Qu\u00e1nx\u012bnqu\u00e1ny\u00ec'')\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2004\n|style=\"background:#B0E0E6;\"|\"Home\"\n|rowspan=2|[[Kit Chan]] and [[JJ Lin]]{{ref|2|2}}\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FDFC8F;\"|\"\u5bb6\"<br>(''Ji\u0101'')\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2005\n|\"Reach Out for the Skies\"\n|[[Taufik Batisah]] and [[Rui En]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FDFC8F;\"|\u52c7\u6562\u5411\u524d\u98de<br>(''Y\u01d2ngg\u01cen xi\u00e0ng qi\u00e1n f\u0113i'')\n|Rui En\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2006\n|\"[[My Island Home (2006 song)|My Island Home]]\"\n|rowspan=2|[[Kaira Gong]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FDFC8F;\"|\u5e78\u798f\u7684\u56fe\u5f62<br>(''X\u00ecngf\u00fa de t\u00fax\u00edng'')\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2007\n|style=\"background:#FF91A4;\"|\"[[There's No Place I'd Rather Be]]\"\n|[[Kit Chan]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FF91A4;\"|\"[[Will you (2007 song)|Will You]]\"\n|Janani Sridhar, Asha Edmund, [[Emma Yong]], Lily Anna Rahmat, Jai Wahab, [[Shabir|Shabir Mohammed]], Sebastian Tan, Gani Karim\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2008\n|\"[[Shine for Singapore]]\"\n|[[Hady Mirza]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FDFC8F;\"|\"\u6674\u7a7a\u4e07\u91cc\"<br>(''Q\u00edngk\u014dng w\u00e0nl\u01d0'')\n|[[Joi Chua]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2009\n|style=\"background:#FF91A4;\"|\"[[What Do You See?

Most funpacks are designed by students from local [[institute of technology#Singapore|polytechnics]] and community services, although an exception happened 2015, where people from all walks of life designed 50 designs for the funpack, which also include a Singa Lion Figurine, some snacks and games.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/jubilee-year-ndp-funpack-unveiled-8259236 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-08-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707184500/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/jubilee-year-ndp-funpack-unveiled-8259236 |archive-date=2017-07-07 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMost of the years, the funpacks were also packed by selected members of the armed forces.

The parade will see the formation of an NDP EXCO (Executive Committee) which oversees various aspects of the parade, from the Parade & Ceremony to the Show, from SICUS (Seating, Invitation, Car parking, Ushering and Security) to Website & Publicity. The EXCO is formed by military personnel and is usually headed by the Commander of the organising division. Civilians also sit on the EXCO as representatives of the various public agencies involved.\n\nSimilarly, sponsorship comes from various public and private organisations to fund this multi-million dollar production. This includes local organisations such as the Singapore Pools, Singapore Telecom, as well as multi national companies such as Volkswagen and Nokia. In recent years, sponsorship is divided into three categories depending on the amount of money pledged, including Principal, Major and Co-sponsors/partners.\n\nThe unit that will be the organizer of the event starts preparatory activities in October, just two months after the previous parade, with the formation of the EXCO and pre-parade planning, plus the official sponsorship launch. In recent years there has been public participation, which also involved with the choosing of the theme and the funpack design.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Singapore National Day Rally]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ndp.org.sg Singapore NDP official website]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n===Other===\n{{Singapore topics}}\n{{Singapore National Day Parade}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Events in Singapore]]\n[[Category:National days|Singapore]]\n[[Category:Military parades in Singapore]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=June 2013}}\n{{third-party|date=July 2011}}\n}}\n[[File:1 singapore national day parade 2011 fireworks.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Fireworks during parade day in 2011]]\nThe '''Singapore National Day Parade''' ([[Abbreviation]]: '''NDP''', {{lang-ms|Perbarisan Hari Kebangsaan}}, {{zh|s=\u56fd\u5e86\u5e86\u5178|t=\u570b\u6176\u6176\u5178|p=gu\u00f3q\u00ecng q\u00ecngdi\u01cen}}, {{lang-ta|\u0ba4\u0bc7\u0b9a\u0bbf\u0baf \u0ba4\u0bbf\u0ba9 \u0b85\u0ba3\u0bbf\u0bb5\u0b95\u0bc1\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bc1}}) is a national [[ceremony]] in [[Singapore]] that, as its name implies, includes a [[parade]] on Singapore's [[National Day (Singapore)|National Day]] on August 9, in commemoration of [[History of Singapore#Independent Singapore (1965 - present)|Singapore's independence]] that is usually held at the [[The Float @ Marina Bay|Float @Marina Bay]], various decentralized venues all over Singapore, [[Padang, Singapore|Padang]] and the  [[National Stadium, Singapore|National Stadium.]]\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2018}}\n[[File:NationalDayParade-Singapore-1968.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A scene from the National Day Parade, 1968, with a contingent from the [[People's Association]] in front.]]\nSingapore celebrated its first [[National Day (Singapore)|National Day]] as an independent nation in 1966,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/national-day-parade-1966-10-things-about-the-inaugural-parade|title=National Day Parade 1966: 10 things about the inaugural parade|last=Chew|first=Hui Min|date=2015-03-05|website=The Straits Times|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331141515/http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/national-day-parade-1966-10-things-about-the-inaugural-parade|archive-date=2018-03-31|url-status=live|access-date=2019-03-09}}</ref> one year after [[Singapore]]'s separation from [[Malaysia]] on 9 August 1965.\n\nThe inaugural National Day Parade started in the morning at 9:00&nbsp;a.m. that day. People came as early as 7:00&nbsp;a.m. in order to get good vantage points. [[Singapore]]'s first [[President of Singapore|President]], [[Yusof bin Ishak]] and Singapore's first [[Prime Minister]], [[Lee Kuan Yew]], were seated with members of the government at the grandstand on the steps of [[City Hall]]. When the parade began, six military contingents (including the Singapore Infantry Regiment, Singapore Police Defense Force and the then Republic of Singapore Police), a mobile column from the SIR, and various schools and civil contingents marched past City Hall and then into the city streets. Three military bands accompanied the parade inspection and later the march past with military music. The Singapore Fire Brigade also took part in this first parade with its firetrucks included in the mobile column. Rounding it all was a massed lion and dragon dance performance from drum and dragon troupes nationwide.\n\nThe following year in 1967, the contingents increased to 76, including those of the then established Singapore Armed Forces, the RSP and more cultural groups, with the addition of more civil marching groups.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19670810-1.2.90|title=PARADE SPARKLER!|website=eresources.nlb.gov.sg|access-date=2019-03-09}}</ref> The reason is partly due to the introduction of the National Service program in the military and police forces, and later extended to the Fire Brigade, later called the Singapore Fire Services in the 1970s.<!-- The NS Bill was signed into law only in March 1967, not sure if this sentence here is a synthesis of ideas/comments, opinion or a fact. --> Street performances by various groups also debuted in that year's parade.

Almost all of the venues lasted for an hour and all of them even had route marches on the streets to the participating venues.\n\nBy the time the NDP was held at the National Stadium (for the first time) in 1976, the NDP Guard of Honour, composed of officers and personnel of the SAF and the Singapore Police Force made its first appearance, followed after the parade proper by the very first evening presentations by various groups, a prelude to future evening NDPs in 1980 and from 1984 onward. 1977's parade was a decentralized event like two years before (and like 1968's was affected by wet weather) while 1978 returned to Padang. 1979's parade saw another decentralized site, this time being held in many high schools and sports stadiums nationwide. The decentralized format would later be used until 1983, which was currently the final time NDP was held in multiple venues until 2015.\n\nThe 15th installment in 1980 was the first parade to introduce the [[feu de joie]] of the Guard-of-Honour contingents. The following year, SPF Civil Defense Command, presently the Singapore Civil Defense Force, later combined with the SFS in 1989, made its inaugural appearance, followed by the SCDF in 1982. The 1981 parade was held in both Jurong and Queenstown Sports Stadiums for further increase public attendance and participation in the celebrations. In 1982, the parade returned at Padang, marked the first time the mobile column drove past after the marchpast had concluded, thus making it a predecessor to the parades at the Padang from 1995 onward, once every five years.\n\nThe 1984 installment featured many firsts in commemoration with the Singapore's Silver Jubilee of self-governance, which for the first time, introduced a theme song \"Stand Up for Singapore\", and included a bigger Mobile Column, the first appearance of the popular Silent Precision Drill Squad from the [[Singapore Armed Forces Military Police Command]] and the first evening fireworks display.\n\nThe 1986 edition was the first parade held in the late evening, and the first to use flashlights for audience use. Other introductions were featured over the years such as the first appearance of the massed military bands of the SAF (1987), the [[card stunt]] (1988), and the [[Singapore Armed Forces Parachute Team|Red Lions]] parachute team and the daylight fireworks (1989). In 1989, the parade was held on the afternoon but was later revert to the evening format since 1991.\n\nIn 1993, interactive participation by the public debuted in that year's edition to increase public participation and awareness of the parade as an important part of Singaporean life and as a symbol of national unity and identity.

Between 1966 and 1974, the venue was located in the central area to bring the parade closer to the people. In 1976, the parade was held for the first time at the [[Former National Stadium, Singapore|Former National Stadium]], where the much larger capacity allowed for more to view the parade live.\n\nAlthough offering about 60,000 seats in the National Stadium, the demand for tickets remained high, resulting in several attempts to decentralise the venue to bring the celebration closer to more Singaporeans. From 1975 to 1983, celebrations were alternated between a decentralised event and one centred at the Padang or stadium. From 1984, the parade was held twice at the stadium before being brought back to the Padang. This three-year cycle was repeated up to 1994, before it changed to five-years on an announcement in 1995.\n\nThe Padang, although historically important, posed a greater logistical challenge and also offered fewer seats for spectators. The event and rehearsals also required the closing of surrounding roads. There was a need to construct temporary spectator stands around the field. The site, however, was the only feasible venue for the mobile column, as the heavy vehicles could not be driven onto the stadium track. The Padang was used as the main performance venue for the 2005 parade, with fringe activities decentralised to [[Marina South]], [[Jurong East]], [[Yishun]] and [[Tampines]]. Several alternate locations were mooted, including the utilization of the Padang, which is physically bigger and less likely to disrupt daily functions in the city.\n\nOn 16 October 2005, it was announced that the 2006 NDP would be held at the old stadium for the last time before moving to [[The Float @ Marina Bay]]. The 130 by 100 metre platform would be used for the next five years until the new stadium is completed. Despite offering a [[seating capacity]] of only 27,000, almost less than half the capacity for the National Stadium, there was a vast area for about another 150,000 spectators along the [[Marina Bay, Singapore|Marina Bay]] waterfront.\n\nAfter a ten-year hiatus, the 2016 edition of NDP officially returned to the new [[National Stadium, Singapore|National Stadium]], and 2017 saw the parade returning to Marina Bay, therefore returning to a modified form of the 1980s parades. Given the huge public reception of the Marina Bay parades, The Float, soon to be renamed NS Square, will be expanded starting in 2021 for future parades as a potential permanent parade venue, alternating with the Padang every five years (2020 was the first year to break the pattern since 1985, as the site previously held in 2019 prior because of celebrating the nation's bicentennial anniversary).\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year||Venue||Theme||Slogan/Tagline||Organiser\n!Creative Director\n|-\n|1966\u20131974||[[Padang, Singapore|Padang]]||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||\n|\n|-\n|1975|||Decentralised Sites|||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||\n|\n|-\n|1976||[[Former National Stadium, Singapore|National Stadium]]||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||2nd Singapore Infantry Brigade\n|\n|-\n|1977||Decentralised sites||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||\n|\n|-\n|1978||Padang||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||\n|\n|-\n|1979||Decentralised sites||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||\n|\n|-\n|1980||National Stadium||Courtesy \u2013 Our Way of Life||||\n|\n|-\n|1981||Decentralised sites||||Energy is Precious \u2013 Save It||&nbsp;\n|\n|-\n|1982||Padang||&nbsp;||||2nd Singapore Infantry Brigade\n|\n|-\n|1983||Decentralised sites||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;\n|\n|-\n|1984||Padang||25 Years of Nation Building, 1959\u20131984||Reach Out Singapore||3rd Singapore Infantry Brigade\n|\n|-\n|1985||rowspan=2|National Stadium||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||7th Singapore Infantry Brigade\n|\n|-\n|1986||&nbsp;||rowspan=2|Together...Excellence for Singapore||2nd Singapore Infantry Brigade\n|\n|-\n|1987||Padang||&nbsp;||3rd Singapore Infantry Brigade\n|\n|-\n|1988||rowspan=2|National Stadium||&nbsp;||rowspan=2|Excellence Together, Singapore Forever|| Singapore Artillery\n|\n|-\n|1989||&nbsp;||2nd Singapore Infantry Brigade\n|\n|-\n|1990||Padang||One People, One Nation, One Singapore|| 25 Years of Nationhood and Another 25 Years of Achievements||HQ Armour\n|\n|-\n|1991||rowspan=2|National Stadium||&nbsp;||rowspan=2|My Singapore||HQ Singapore Combat Engineers\n|\n|-\n|1992||&nbsp;||Singapore Air Defense Artillery\n|\n|-\n|1993||Padang||Nation on Parade||rowspan=4|My Singapore, My Home||HQ Armour\n|\n|-\n|1994||National Stadium||&nbsp;||7th Singapore Infantry Brigade\n|\n|-\n|1995||Padang||30 Years of Nationhood / A Nation in Harmony||HQ Armour\n|\n|-\n|1996||rowspan=4|National Stadium||&nbsp;||HQ Singapore Combat Engineers\n|\n|-\n|1997||Our Singapore, Our Future||NDP 1997 Musical Extravanganza||Singapore Artillery\n|\n|-\n|1998||&nbsp;||Our Singapore, Our Future||7th Singapore Infantry Brigade\n|\n|-\n| 1999||Our People||rowspan=3|Together We Make The Difference||6th Division\n|\n|-\n| 2000||Padang||&nbsp;||3rd Division\n|\n|-\n| 2001||rowspan=4|National Stadium||Building Bridges, Forging Futures||9th Division/Infantry\n|\n|-\n| 2002||A Caring Nation||rowspan=3|Together, A New Singapore||HQ Armour\n|Dick Lee\n|-\n| 2003||A Cohesive Society||HQ Singapore Guards\n|Glenn Goei\n|-\n| 2004||A Progressive Society||6th Division\n|Glenn Goei\n|-\n| 2005||Padang||40 Years of Nation Building||The Future is Ours to Make||3rd Division\n|Glenn Goei\n|-\n| 2006||National Stadium||Our Global City, Our Home||&nbsp;||HQ Singapore Guards\n|Glenn Goei\n|-\n| 2007||rowspan=3|[[The Float at Marina Bay|Marina Bay Floating Platform]]||City of Possibilities||&nbsp;||HQ Singapore Combat Engineers\n|Goh Boon Teck\n|-\n| 2008||Celebrating the Singapore Spirit||&nbsp;||HQ Singapore Guards\n|Goh Boon Teck\n|-\n| 2009||Come Together \u2013 Reaching Out \u2022 Reaching Up||&nbsp;||3rd Division\n|Ivan Heng\n|-\n| 2010||Padang||Live Our Dreams, Fly Our Flag||&nbsp;||HQ Armour\n|Dick Lee\n|-\n| 2011||rowspan=4|Marina Bay Floating Platform||Majulah!

Even though there had been logos for some previous years' parades, the logos were used exclusively for years of special commemoration, such as silver jubilee of Nation Building (1984) and Independence (1990). Solgans have also be used, such as \"Our Singapore, Our Future\", first used in the 1997 celebrations.\n\nWith the introduction of NDP logos for 1998, every logo henceforth would be designed to suit the themes, in particular the foundation theme of the parade. A tagline, which was previously known as a slogan, was usually added to the logo design. An example was in 2005, where the tagline for NDP 2005 was \"The Future is Ours to Make\", was placed on the theme \"40 Years of Nation Building\". These taglines are usually taken from previous National Day Rallies for the purpose of rallying the nation together on 9 August to meet the challenges ahead. The tagline \"Together We Make The Difference\" was introduced in 1999 due to the launch of the Singapore 21 project, and was replaced by \"Together, A New Singapore\" in 2002 when then-Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]] proposed the \"Remaking Singapore\" initiative in the National Day Rally 2001.\n\nMost of the logos uses a majority of red color, however in 2007, blue has taken over the traditional red to symbolise the water around the [[Marina Bay, Singapore|Marina Bay]] area. Regardless, the logos are important to note that the themes and taglines are largely different; and it is the theme that the parade or Show segment, on in some cases (2009 and 2015), both will be based on.\n\n==Parade sequence==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nAlthough the programme and sequence of the parade do change over the years, several components and the overall flow of the parade have remained intact for the past four decades. With the shifting of venues for some editions of the parade, or in cases such as wet weather, programmes may have to cancel or introduce slight modifications in order to suit the changes, for instance the Mobile Column, which is only possible both at the Padang site and at Marina Bay.\n\n===Stage and backdrop design===\n===Pre-parade===\nThe pre-parade segment today may include mass-displays, choir performances, school band displays, [[Parachuting|sky-diving]] displays, and other light-hearted performances to entertain the crowd prior to the parade proper, with the added positive effect of encouraging parade-attendees to be seated earlier. Initially introduced on an ad-hoc basis as an informal filler, it has since became an integral part of the parade particularly when live television coverage was extended to this segment in recent years. As audience participation has become a part of the parade, the pre-parade segment also becomes an opportunity for the hosts to lead and rehearse with the audience actions they may have to do when the parade proper begins.\n\nMotivators from [[Lawrence Khong#TOUCH Community Services|TOUCH Community Services]] were introduced to the pre-parade in 2002 (then called Anchor Talents). TOUCH Community Services has since moved on to mentoring students from the various [[Institute of Technical Education|Institutes of Technical Education (ITEs)]] and various Polytechnics since 2003 until the present, under the Leadership & Mentoring programme. Colorful costumes and dance moves have been designed for the motivators.\n\n===Parade and ceremonies===\nThe parade has been a traditional segment of the National Day Parade. Participants of the parade include members of the [[Singapore Armed Forces]], [[Singapore Police Force]], [[Singapore Civil Defence Force]], representatives of the [[People's Action Party]], different labour unions (including members of the National Trades Union Congress) and Ministries as well as students in uniformed groups (such as the National Cadet Corps, [[National Police Cadet Corps]], [[National Civil Defence Cadet Corps]], the Singapore Red Cross, the Boys' and Girls' Brigades, the Scouts Association, the Girl Guides and St. John Ambulance Brigade) and representatives of various Singapore business entities.\n\nParticipants are split into two main sections: the Guard-of-Honour contingents and the Supporting Contingents. The four Guard-of-Honour contingents are made up of members from the three arms of the Singapore Armed Forces (the [[Singapore Army]], represented by the Best Combat Unit, for many years the 1st Commando Battalion of the [[Singapore Armed Forces Commando Formation]]; the [[Republic of Singapore Navy]]; and the [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]]) as well as the Singapore Police Force. All members of these contingents are dressed in their respective ceremonial uniforms, known as the No. 1 uniform. Behind the Guard-of-Honour contingents stand the Regimental Colours Party, where the 32 SAF regimental colours are held by a group of officers, known as ensigns, from the Singapore Armed Forces, with their armed escorts (until 1997 Service Regimental Colors from the SAF's three services led the colours party). The 3 State Colours are in between the Navy and Air Force Guard-of-Honour contingents, and are formed by Escorts(Specialists) and Ensigns (Junior Officers). \n\nThe parade's [[military band]]s are from both the [[Singapore Armed Forces|SAF]] and [[Singapore Police Force|SPF]], and in recent years, the [[marching band]]s of both services' cadet organizations (the Singapore NCC Command Band and the NPCC Band) have joined them as well, with the Singapore NCC Command Band being part of the combined band since 2010. Before the 1994 creation of the SAF Bands the different service arms of the SAF fielded their own bands, and the massed bands for the parade were, since the early 1970s, from a select band of the SAF and the Singapore Police Force Band (inter-service massed bands would only happen in 1987).\n\nThe parade traditionally starts with the Parade Regimental Sergeant Major (Parade RSM) forming up the parade on either the Padang, the field of the National Stadium or in front of the Marina Bay grandstand. The command of the parade is handed over to the Parade Commander once the parade has been formed up and properly dressed accordingly. Typically, both the Parade RSM and the Parade Commander come from the SAF, and usually hold a minimum rank of Master Warrant Officer, and Lieutenant Colonel respectively. Upon sizing and forming up the parade to full formation, the Parade Commander will wait for the arrival of the members of Parliament, members of the Cabinet and the [[Prime Minister of Singapore]], in that order (the salutes were dropped partially in 2008, and the Prime Minister's salute was dropped the next year). Upon the arrival of each group, the parade will present its salute and present arms, except for the Parliament and Cabinet members, upon which they stand at attention and only the PC salutes them.\n\nLastly once the [[President of Singapore]] has arrived (after the playing of the Presidential Fanfare by the Fanfare Trumpeters of the SAF), the Parade Commander will call for a full (Presidential) salute, during which the National Anthem, [[Majulah Singapura]], will be played accompanied by a fly-past of the State Flag, and from 2011, would also require raising it as well on a separate flagpole. After that (and the following aerial salute by the RSAF), the Parade Commander will request that the President inspects the parade. During this inspection, the President will be accompanied by the Chief of Defence Force and the Parade Commander, and the Army GOH Contingent Commander would later join them once they approach the Guard-of-Honour (recent parades have seen a motorized inspection by the President while riding a Land Rover). A presidential [[21-gun salute]] is also given to the President during this time by a select battery from the [[Singapore Artillery]]. It is customary that the President speaks to some members of the Guard-of-honor contingents as he passes by. After the inspection ends, the President will return to the podium before the Guard-of-honor contingents presents a [[Feu-de-Joie]] led by the Parade Commander.\n\nAt the end of it (with the GOH contingents now at shoulder arms), the Parade Commander will ask the President for permission for the Parade Marchpast to start. 2012's edition formally included an Advance in Review order to the proceedings for the first time.\n\n====Marchpast====\nThe Parade Commander will command the Parade contingents to prepare for the Marchpast, and will then march out of the Parade Grounds, with the bands bringing the rear. In the National Day Parade 2009, there was a City Marchpast where the contingents marched around the Central Business District, with the march ending at the F1 Pit Building. In the National Day Parade 2010, the City Marchpast made its second appearance and this time the Marina Bay area was the venue for this, with the Marina Padang as the final stop on the march past. 2011 saw the reinstatement of the march through the stands moment of the supporting contingents of the SAF, SPF and SCDF (previously done in the 2002 edition and now called the Onward March), and that year the participants of the youth uniformed groups and the civilian contingents marched out in a different way, only for all of them to reunite for the City Marchpast later on. The 2012 edition of the parade, the very first National Day Parade officiated by the [[President of the Republic of Singapore|President]] [[Tony Tan Keng Yam]], had the Onward March which was now done for the second time by all of the youth uniformed groups present while the military and civilian supporting contingents marched out in a different way similar to the march pasts during the 2000 and 2010 editions with all of them rejoining for the City Marchpast to be done later with the GOH contingent battalion to [[Marina Bay Sands]] where the march ended. The Onward March made yet another appearance in the 2014 edition alongside the City Marchpast after the parade proper towards the MBS complex. The City Marchpast made its sixthth consecutive appearance in the 2015 edition and was carried on in 2016 together with the Onward March from the new National Stadium and again from Marina Bay in 2017 and 2018.\n\nIn recent years the order of the march past of the supporting contingents out of the grounds has been altered, with the military and civil uniformed services first to march out, followed by the economic firms, social organizations and the youth uniformed organizations which march last out and then into the platform stands.\n\n====Mobile column, flypast and defence exposition====\nThe first Mobile Column was organized in 1969 which displayed the then newly acquired armour vehicles of the SAF, the RSP's police vehicles and the SCDF's fire trucks. In 1990, after a six-year hiatus, the Mobile Column returned as part of the silver jubilee of Singapore's independence. It has been on show during the more important milestone anniversaries of the nation's birthday, on parades held in Padang every five years, including 2019 and the upcoming 2020 installments.\n\nAlmost every NDP since 1971 (except 2016) has had a flypast segment featuring jet and training aircraft, transports and helicopters from the [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]].\n\nWhenever the NDP is held at The Float in Marina Bay the Mobile Column and flypast both evolve into the multi-platform and multi-service Dynamic Defence Display (D3), with a display of the military defence and public security capabilities of the uniformed services. In lieu of the 2018 D3, as part of the parade and ceremony segment of the program, a special flypast of the RSAF was held in that year's edition to mark its golden jubilee.\n\n===Show segment===\n====Highlights====\nThe spectacular show segment follows the traditional parade and ceremony, and lasts normally for 45 minutes. Following the theme of the parade that year, the Show will feature (aside from a Prologue in recent editions) three to four main Acts that culminates in a Grand Finale, that will usually feature the theme song of that year's parade, followed by the much anticipated fireworks display. The entire parade will end in a chorus of voices singing familiar National Day Songs, mass pledge taking (from 2009 expanded into a national activity) and the singing of the National Anthem. In 2007, the parade broke tradition for having a fireworks display that synchronized with the Sing Singapore medley in the finale. In 2009, for the first time ever, all the segments of the NDP have been merged into one integrated program; this would later be repeated in 2015.\n\nIt has its origins in early NDPs as various mass display items put up by community groups or schools to add colour to the otherwise military parade. These items revolved around the themes of racial harmony, ruggedness among youths etc., which are represented by ethnic dances and mass gymnastics displays. This section evolved over the years to become more theatrical, from the massive flashcard displays that complemented the parade in the 1980s to multimedia projections in recent Shows.\n\nFloat displays also featured prominently in the Show segments of the 1970s and 1980s where floats were designed to promote government campaigns or highlight the works of various public and private companies. This returned in NDP 1998 and in NDP 2005 as a visual representation of Singapore's past 40 years of nation building, with further reappearances at NDP 2009 and at NDP 2010 to symbolize the mixture of peoples that make up Singapore today. Floats would return in the 2015, 2017 and 2019 editions. Boats and floats on the Marina Bay area in view of the crowds were one of the highlights of the 2018 show segment.\n\nParades today, held from dusk to night, end in the climax of [[fireworks]] displays which have become a prominent feature in every parade, which followed by a medley of songs and then reciting the [[Singapore National Pledge|pledge]] and singing \"[[Majulah Singapura]]\". However, in the early parades that were held in the day (from 1965\u201372) and later afternoon to evening NDP editions from 1973 to 1980, 1982 and 1984, mass lion and dragon dance displays are actually the parade finale. Lion and dragon dance troupes from various community centres and clan associations would gather on the field to the resonating sound of drumbeats to put on a fiery display that end the parade on an auspicious note. These troupes later became integral parts of the 1985 and 1988 (evening) NDP editions.\n\n====Participating organizations====\nThough every show would see the participation of an assortment of public and private companies, there are three main anchors taking on each Act in the show segment. They are the Peoples' Association (which involvement started in 1984, and one of the founding participants), the [[Soka Gakkai International|Singapore Soka Association (SSA)]] (active since the 1970s) and the Ministry of Education, which would be represented by an individual institution or a cluster of schools, and also a founding participant of the parades. The latter also provides the Combined Schools Band and the Combined School Choirs, another regular part of the NDP itself, and since the 1970s has been part of the national celebrations. The Ministry also provides the School Display Band for the pre-parade segment of the programme, coming from one of the many schools in the island country pre-selected for performance in the event. Since 2016, volunteers from Team Nila are also involved as Precinct Ushers, Safety Management Aides and, most recently, as pre-show Active Health Ambassadors.\n\n====Multimedia show====\nVarious types of high-tech multimedia equipment are used during the actual show segment since 2003. Various technologies notable include the Projecteur d\u2019Images G\u00e9antes Informatis\u00e9es in 2003, a water-curtain visualization in 2007, and LED Mash in 2008.\n\n===Post-parade===\nPost-parade parties was first televised in 1997 and featured celebrities and performers to celebrate the success of the parade while providing entertainment to the audience awaiting to leave the venue. The parade usually last for an hour and ends with the Chief of Defence Force, the Chairman of that year's NDP EXCO and the organizers to cutting a cake to commemorate the efforts with the participants with speeches of gratitude. The party is now normally anchored by the SAF Music and Drama Company.\n\n==Songs==\n===National Day songs===\nUnder the ''Sing Singapore'' Festival, which inaugurated in 1984, numerous community songs have been composed. Nonetheless, only few National Day songs which struck a chord among Singaporeans continue to be sung annually in the parade. They are collectively known as the Sing Singapore Medley which comes after the fireworks display during the Grand Finale segment, or since 2008, forming the final part of the display.\n\nOther National Day songs continue to be featured during the parade, either in the Pre-Parade segment, Parade and Ceremony segment or used as tunes to accompany the mass displays during the show part of the celebrations. In particular, for the Parade and Ceremony segment, in between the arrivals of Members of Parliament, Cabinet Ministers, the Prime Minister and the President, four songs each of one official language (English, Malay, Mandarin and Tamil) will be performed. In previous years, the final song in English (before the President's arrival) has always been the NDP theme song (in 2007 this was not the case) while in NDP 2008, all the songs performed in the P&C segment (in between arrivals) were all previous NDP theme songs in recent years. (The song tradition would return in 2017, but only in the pre-parade portion and in a different language order, while past theme songs were played during the arrivals.) The music performed during the parades have evolved over the decades, reflecting not just the change of musical influences and styles, but also the country's multi-ethnic character.\n\nThe 2010 P&C songs were three in number, due to the fact that the arrival of the Parliament deputies happened before the parade, and were unique because all the songs sung were in English (one song even had lyrics in the three other major languages).\n\nIn 2011, there was the \"Fun Pack Song\" which went along to the tune of Lady Gaga's 'Bad Romance'. The song was shortly scrapped.\n\nThe 2013's medley saw a record number of NDP songs that featured in this medley, with ten and lasted about five-and-a-half minutes: \"Stand Up For Singapore\", \"We Will Get There\", \"What Do You See\", \"One United People\", \"Turn Up The Love\" (not including NDP songs), \"Home\", \"One People, One Nation, One Singapore\", \"Count On Me Singapore\", \"We Are Singapore\" and \"One Singapore\" (that year's theme song).\n\nIn 2014, it was announced that there would be no new songs produced for National Day for the 2nd time in its long history, and in a historic move by the organizing committee, the classic NDP songs will be sung again. That year's edition saw past NDP theme songs being played during the arrival segments, and broke tradition by having the Sing Singapore Medley sung as the epilogue after the national anthem was played. The Sing Singapore Medley finale was repeated again in the 2015 event, after the Pledge Moment ends. Both cases have now included the 1998 theme song \"Home\" as part of the medley, just as it was the case in 2013.\n\n2016 will see the medley also accompanied by special needs students provided by the seven Voluntary Welfare Organisations of the island country hand-signing for the deaf and hard of hearing who will take part, yet another first. The 1998 theme \"Home\" was sung as well. (Since 1989 a deaf Representative has been present to sign the Pledge for deaf viewers of the event.)\n\n===Theme songs===\nNDP Theme songs were first introduced in 1984, starting with \"Stand Up for Singapore\", and again in the 1985 Parade; \"Count on Me Singapore\" which was performed by Clement Chow at the 1986 Parade. Other notable songs include \"We are Singapore\" (1987\u20131988) and \"One People, One Nation, One Singapore\" (1990).\n\nTheme songs were not prominent in the parades of the 1990s until in 1997, when the song \"Singapore Town\", composed and sung by the SAF Music and Drama Company, was that year's theme song. Only in the 1998 edition did interest in the NDP theme songs rose again with the widely acclaimed song \"[[Home (Kit Chan song)|Home]]\", a song composed by Dick Lee and sung by [[Kit Chan]]. That year's parade feature \"Home\" and one more NDP song, \"City For The World\", sung by the children choir. Its popularity led to the production of the various renditions in 2004, including a rock piece composed by JJ Lin. This is partly to use the platform of the televised national event to increase awareness to new National Day pieces composed for the Sing Singapore Festival held then.\n\nIn 2003, however, a significant split took place when the National Day theme song of that year was not part of ''Sing Singapore'' theme song. Stefanie Sun's \"One United People\" was used as the theme song to better suit the theme of \"A Cohesive Society\" while Sean Wang's \"A Place In My Heart\" was chosen to lead the ''Sing Singapore 2003'' Festival.\n\nBefore 2007, the theme songs come in two languages, the lingua franca in Singapore \u2013 English as well as Mandarin. To promote the songs, music videos that showcase local landmarks and lifestyle are made and shown on national television a month before National Day; the songs will also be played on local airwaves. Legal MP3 downloads are also available on the NDP website from 2010 onwards.\n\nLocal songbirds that made it big in regional music scenes, such as Kaira Gong, Kit Chan, Corrine May, Stefanie Sun and Tanya Chua have been invited back home to perform various National Day theme songs. The winner of ''Singapore Idol'' 2004, Taufik Batisah, became a prominent choice to lead the nation in singing the NDP 2005's theme song \"Reach Out for the Skies\", alongside singer-actress Rui En.\n\nIn 2007, there were two theme songs instead of the usual one. 2009 was the last time a Chinese rendition of the English song was featured.\n\nIn 2013, the National Day Parade theme song will not be sung by renowned local artists but, for the first time, by fellow Singaporeans that join the \"Sing A Nation\" reality-competition organized by MediaCorp for that year's event.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/singapore/story/national-day-2013-song-one-singapore-receives-online-brickbats-and-som | title=National Day 2013 song One Singapore receives online brickbats - and some bouquets | publisher=The Straits Times | date=18 July 2013 | accessdate=22 July 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721165509/http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/singapore/story/national-day-2013-song-one-singapore-receives-online-brickbats-and-som | archive-date=21 July 2013 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20130718-438270.html | title=Netizens slam NDP 2013 song | publisher=AsiaOne | date=20 July 2013 | accessdate=22 July 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301082203/http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20130718-438270.html | archive-date=1 March 2014 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIt would be in 2014 when the NDP will not have another official theme song in a break from tradition for the second time, due to decision made by the organizers. In place of the theme song was three songs were remade into two music videos: \"We Will Get There\" and \"One People, One Nation, One Singapore\" sung by Ann Hussein, [[Rahimah Rahim (singer, born 1955)|Rahimah Rahim]], Gayle Nerva, Farisha Ishak, [[Tay Kewei]] and [[Tabitha Nauser]]; and \"What Do You See\" sung by Fauzie Laily, Jack Ho, Kartik Kunasegaran, Sivadorai \"Rai\" Sellakannu and Shaun Jansen. Dick Lee's 1996 song, \"Big Island\", debuted during the show segment of the parade. The theme song tradition would return in the 2015 installment again until 2018. The 2015 theme song, \"Our Singapore\", was remade as the theme song for 2019, and the 2018's parade features a remake of \"We Are Singapore\", both of which being the theme titles for that year's parade. The most recent installment to feature an original theme song was 2017, \"Because it's Singapore\", which was sung by ''[[Singapore Idol]]'' contestant Jay Lim.\n\nThe list of NDP theme songs are as follows:\n{{plainlist|\n;Table Key \n*{{Color box|#FDFC8F|border=darkgray}} Chinese version {{Color box|#B0E0E6|border=darkgray}} Remake of original music {{Color box|#FF91A4|border=darkgray}} Recognised as a [[List of Singaporean patriotic songs|patriotic song]] \n}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Song\n!Artistes\n|-\n|1984{{ref|1|1}}\n|\"Stand Up for Singapore\"\n|&nbsp;\n|-\n|1986\n|style=\"background:#FF91A4;\"|\"Count on Me Singapore\"\n|Clement Chow\n|-\n|1987\n|\"We are Singapore\"\n|Jonathan Tan, Roslinda Baharudin, Anne Weerapass and Robert Fernando\n|-\n|1990\n|style=\"background:#FF91A4;\"|\"One People, One Nation, One Singapore\"\n|\n|-\n|1991\n|\"It's the Little Things\"\n|&nbsp;\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|1998\n|\"[[Home (Kit Chan song)|Home]]\"\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Kit Chan]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FDFC8F;\"|\"\u5bb6\"<br>(''Ji\u0101'')\n|-\n|\"City for the World\"\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1999\n|\"Together\"\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Evelyn Tan]] & Dreamz FM|\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FDFC8F;\"|\"\u5fc3\u8fde\u5fc3\"<br>(''X\u012bn li\u00e1n x\u012bn'')\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2000\n|\"Shine on Me\"\n|Jai Wahab\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FDFC8F;\"|\"\u661f\u6708\"<br>(''X\u012bng yu\u00e8'')\n|[[Mavis Hee]]\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2001\n|\"[[Where I Belong (Tanya Chua song)|Where I Belong]]\"\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Tanya Chua]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FDFC8F;\"|\"\u5c5e\u4e8e\"<br>(''Sh\u01d4y\u00fa'')\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2002\n|\"We Will Get There\"\n|rowspan=4|[[Stefanie Sun]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FDFC8F;\"|\"\u4e00\u8d77\u8d70\u5230\"<br>(''Y\u012bq\u01d0 z\u01d2u d\u00e0o'')\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2003\n|\"One United People\"\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FDFC8F;\"|\"\u5168\u5fc3\u5168\u610f\"<br>(''Qu\u00e1nx\u012bnqu\u00e1ny\u00ec'')\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2004\n|style=\"background:#B0E0E6;\"|\"Home\"\n|rowspan=2|[[Kit Chan]] and [[JJ Lin]]{{ref|2|2}}\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FDFC8F;\"|\"\u5bb6\"<br>(''Ji\u0101'')\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2005\n|\"Reach Out for the Skies\"\n|[[Taufik Batisah]] and [[Rui En]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FDFC8F;\"|\u52c7\u6562\u5411\u524d\u98de<br>(''Y\u01d2ngg\u01cen xi\u00e0ng qi\u00e1n f\u0113i'')\n|Rui En\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2006\n|\"[[My Island Home (2006 song)|My Island Home]]\"\n|rowspan=2|[[Kaira Gong]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FDFC8F;\"|\u5e78\u798f\u7684\u56fe\u5f62<br>(''X\u00ecngf\u00fa de t\u00fax\u00edng'')\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2007\n|style=\"background:#FF91A4;\"|\"[[There's No Place I'd Rather Be]]\"\n|[[Kit Chan]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FF91A4;\"|\"[[Will you (2007 song)|Will You]]\"\n|Janani Sridhar, Asha Edmund, [[Emma Yong]], Lily Anna Rahmat, Jai Wahab, [[Shabir|Shabir Mohammed]], Sebastian Tan, Gani Karim\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2008\n|\"[[Shine for Singapore]]\"\n|[[Hady Mirza]]\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FDFC8F;\"|\"\u6674\u7a7a\u4e07\u91cc\"<br>(''Q\u00edngk\u014dng w\u00e0nl\u01d0'')\n|[[Joi Chua]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|2009\n|style=\"background:#FF91A4;\"|\"[[What Do You See?

The parade will see the formation of an NDP EXCO (Executive Committee) which oversees various aspects of the parade, from the Parade & Ceremony to the Show, from SICUS (Seating, Invitation, Car parking, Ushering and Security) to Website & Publicity. The EXCO is formed by military personnel and is usually headed by the Commander of the organising division. Civilians also sit on the EXCO as representatives of the various public agencies involved.\n\nSimilarly, sponsorship comes from various public and private organisations to fund this multi-million dollar production. This includes local organisations such as the Singapore Pools, Singapore Telecom, as well as multi national companies such as Volkswagen and Nokia. In recent years, sponsorship is divided into three categories depending on the amount of money pledged, including Principal, Major and Co-sponsors/partners.\n\nThe unit that will be the organizer of the event starts preparatory activities in October, just two months after the previous parade, with the formation of the EXCO and pre-parade planning, plus the official sponsorship launch. In recent years there has been public participation, which also involved with the choosing of the theme and the funpack design.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Singapore National Day Rally]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ndp.org.sg Singapore NDP official website]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n===Other===\n{{Singapore topics}}\n{{Singapore National Day Parade}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Events in Singapore]]\n[[Category:National days|Singapore]]\n[[Category:Military parades in Singapore]]\n", "name_user": "NatIsrael972", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTheme songs:Stand Up for Singapore and We are Singapore are now marked as patriotic songs - don't know why it wasn't.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_National_Day_Parade"}

It was the first air operation to strike the Japanese archipelago. It demonstrated that the Japanese mainland was vulnerable to American air attack, served as retaliation for the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], and provided an important boost to American morale. The raid was planned, led by, and named after Lieutenant Colonel [[Jimmy Doolittle|James Doolittle]], later General of the United States Air Force.<ref>{{cite book |title=Official Register of Commissioned Officers of the United States Army |date=1926 |pages=165}}</ref><!--Doolittle did not receive his General Rank until 1985 actually when he was in the Air Force Reserves.

The plan called for them to bomb military targets in Japan and to continue westward to land in China. The bombing raid killed about 50 people, including civilians, and injured 400. Fifteen aircraft reached China but all crashed, while the 16th landed at [[Vladivostok]] in the Soviet Union. Of the 80 crew members, 77 survived the mission. Eight airmen were captured by Japanese Army troops in China; three were later executed. The B-25 that landed in the Soviet Union was confiscated and its crew interned for more than a year before being allowed to \"escape\" via [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|Soviet-occupied]] [[Imperial State of Iran|Iran]] with the help of the [[NKVD]]. Fourteen complete crews of five returned to the United States or to American forces, except for one crewman who was killed in action.<ref name=\"bravemen\" /><ref name=\"Glines 1998, pp. 166\u2013168\">Glines 1998, pp. 166\u201368.</ref>\n\nThe raid caused negligible material damage to Japan, but it had major psychological effects. In the United States, it raised morale. In Japan, it raised doubt about the ability of military leaders to defend the home islands, but the bombing and strafing of civilians also steeled Japanese resolve to gain retribution, and this was exploited for propaganda purposes.<ref name=\"hist reex\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.historynet.com/aftermath-doolittle-raid-reexamined.htm |title = Aftermath: How the Doolittle Raid Shook Japan|date = 27 July 2015}}</ref> It also pushed forward Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]'s plans to attack [[Midway Atoll|Midway Island]] in the Central Pacific, an attack that turned into a decisive defeat of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) by the U.S. Navy in the [[Battle of Midway]]. The consequences were most severely felt in China, where [[Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign|Japanese reprisals]] caused the deaths of 250,000 civilians and 70,000 soldiers.<ref name=\"hist reex\" />\n\nDoolittle initially believed that the loss of all his aircraft would lead to his court-martial, but he instead received the [[Medal of Honor]] and was promoted two ranks to brigadier general.\n\n== Background ==\nPresident [[Franklin D.

Leonard, flight engineer/gunner.]]\nThe concept for the attack came from Navy Captain [[Francis S. Low]], Assistant Chief of Staff for antisubmarine warfare. He reported to Admiral [[Ernest J. King]] on 10 January 1942 that he thought that twin-engined Army bombers could be launched from an aircraft carrier, after observing several at [[Naval Station Norfolk Chambers Field]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], where the runway was painted with the outline of a carrier deck for landing practice.<ref>Glines 1998, p. 13.</ref> \n\nDoolittle, a famous military test pilot, civilian aviator, and aeronautical engineer before the war, was assigned to Army Air Forces Headquarters to plan the raid. The aircraft to be used would need a cruising range of {{convert|2400|nmi|km}} with a {{convert|2000|lb|kg|adj=on}} bomb load, so Doolittle selected the B-25B Mitchell to carry out the mission. The range of the Mitchell was about 1,300 miles, so the bombers had to be modified to hold nearly twice the normal fuel reserves. Doolittle also considered the [[Martin B-26 Marauder]], [[Douglas B-18 Bolo]], and [[Douglas B-23 Dragon]],<ref>Glines 1998, p. 19.</ref> but the B-26 had questionable takeoff characteristics from a carrier deck and the B-23's wingspan was nearly 50-percent greater than the B-25's, reducing the number that could be taken aboard a carrier and posing risks to the ship's superstructure. The B-18 was one of the final two types that Doolittle considered, and he rejected it for the same reason.<ref>Glines 1998, pp. 19\u201320.</ref> The B-25 had yet to see combat,{{refn|The first bombing mission by B-25s preceded the Doolittle Raid by only 12 days.

The 17th BG had been the first group to receive B-25s, with all four of its squadrons equipped with the bomber by September 1941. The 17th not only was the first medium bomb group of the Army Air Corps, but in early 1942, also had the most experienced B-25 crews. Its first assignment following the entry of the United States into the war was to the U.S. [[Eighth Air Force]].<ref name=\"Craven and Cate 1948, p. 439.\">Craven and Cate 1948, p. 439.</ref>\n\nThe 17th BG, then flying antisubmarine patrols from [[Pendleton, Oregon]], was immediately moved cross-country to [[Columbia Army Air Base]] at [[West Columbia, South Carolina]], ostensibly to fly similar patrols off the east coast of the United States, but in actuality to prepare for the mission against Japan. The group officially transferred effective 9 February 1942 to Columbia, where its combat crews were offered the opportunity to volunteer for an \"extremely hazardous\", but unspecified mission.

With support provided by two senior airline managers, [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport|Wold-Chamberlain Field's]] maintenance hangar was the first modification center to become operational. From nearby [[Fort Snelling]], the 710th Military Police Battalion provided tight security around this hangar. B-25B aircraft modifications included the following:\n* Removal of the lower gun turret.\n* Installation of [[de-ice]]rs and [[Antifreeze|anti-icers]].\n* Mounting of steel blast plates on the fuselage around the upper turret.\n* Removal of the liaison radio set to save weight.\n* Installation of a 160-gallon collapsible neoprene auxiliary fuel tank, fixed to the top of the bomb bay, and installation of support mounts for additional fuel cells in the bomb bay, crawlway, and lower turret area, to increase fuel capacity from 646 to 1,141 [[U.S. gallon]]s (538 to 950 [[Gallon#Imperial gallon|imperial gallons]], or 2,445 to 4,319 L).\n* Installation of mock gun barrels in the tail cone.\n* Replacement of the [[Norden bombsight]] with a makeshift aiming sight devised by pilot Capt.

Dean E. Hallmark (sixth off) and 1st Lt. William G. Farrow (last off). On 15 August 1942, the United States learned from the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Consul (representative)|Consulate General]] in Shanghai that eight of the missing crew members were prisoners of the Japanese at the city's police headquarters. Two crewmen drowned after crash-landing in the ocean. On 19 October 1942, the Japanese announced that they had tried the eight prisoners and sentenced them all to death, but said several had received commutation of their sentences to life imprisonment. No names or details were given.\n\nThe story of the missing crews was revealed in February 1946 during a [[war crimes]] trial held in Shanghai to try four Japanese officers charged with mistreating the eight captured crewmen. Two of the missing crewmen, bombardier [[staff sergeant|S/Sgt.]] [[William John Dieter|William J. Dieter]] and flight engineer Sgt. Donald E. Fitzmaurice of Hallmark's crew, were found to have drowned when their B-25 crashed into the sea. Both of their remains were recovered after the war and were buried with military honors at [[Golden Gate National Cemetery]].\n\nThe other eight were captured: 1st Lt. Dean E. Hallmark, 1st Lt. William G. Farrow, 1st Lt. Robert J. Meder, 1st Lt. [[Chase Nielsen]], 1st Lt. Robert L. Hite, 2nd Lt. George Barr, Cpl. Harold A. Spatz, and Cpl. [[Jake DeShazer|Jacob DeShazer]]. On 28 August 1942, Hallmark, Farrow, and gunner Spatz faced a war crimes trial by a Japanese court alleging they strafed and murdered Japanese civilians. At 16:30 on 15 October 1942, they were taken by truck to Public Cemetery Number 1 and executed by [[firing squad]].\n\n[[File:Doolittle Raider RL Hite blindfolded by Japanese 1942.jpg|thumb|left|Robert L.

In April 1943, they were moved to [[Nanking]], where Meder died on 1 December 1943. The remaining men\u2014Nielsen, Hite, Barr and DeShazer\u2014eventually began receiving slightly better treatment and were given a copy of the Bible and a few other books. They were freed by American troops in August 1945. Four Japanese officers were tried for war crimes against the captured Doolittle Raiders, found guilty, and sentenced to hard labor, three for five years and one for nine years. Barr had been near death when liberated and remained behind in China recuperating until October, by which time he had begun to experience severe emotional problems. Untreated after transfer to [[Letterman Army Hospital]] and a military hospital in [[Clinton, Iowa]], Barr became suicidal and was held virtually incommunicado until November, when Doolittle's personal intervention resulted in treatment that led to his recovery.<ref>Glines 1988, pp. 202\u201304.</ref> DeShazer graduated from Seattle Pacific University in 1948 and returned to Japan as a [[missionary]], where he served for over 30 years.<ref>DeShazer Dixon, Carol Aiko.

Doolittle was promoted two grades to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] on 28 April while still in China, skipping the rank of colonel, and was presented with the [[Medal of Honor]] by Roosevelt upon his return to the United States in June. When General Doolittle toured the growing [[Eglin Field]] facility in July 1942 with commanding officer Col. [[Grandison Gardner]], the local paper of record (the ''Okaloosa News-Journal'', [[Crestview, Florida]]), while reporting his presence, made no mention of his still-secret recent training at Eglin. He went on to command the [[Twelfth Air Force]] in North Africa, the [[Fifteenth Air Force]] in the Mediterranean, and the [[Eighth Air Force]] in England during the next three years.\n\n[[File:111-SC-21321AC (34281999011).jpg|thumb|An injured pilot<!--Who?--> received the Distinguished Flying Cross at Walter Reed Hospital from Maj.

In November 1942, it deployed overseas to North Africa, where it operated in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations with the [[Twelfth Air Force]] for the remainder of the war.\n\n=== Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign ===\nAfter the raid, the Japanese Imperial Army began the [[Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign]] (also known as Operation Sei-go) to prevent these eastern coastal provinces of China from being used again for an attack on Japan and to take revenge on the Chinese people.

Chinese estimates put the civilian death toll at 250,000. The Imperial Japanese Army had also spread [[cholera]], [[typhoid]], [[Plague (disease)|plague]] infected fleas and [[dysentery]] pathogens. The Japanese biological warfare [[Unit 731]] brought almost 300 pounds of [[paratyphoid]] and [[anthrax]] to be left in contaminated food and contaminated wells with the withdrawal of the army from areas around Yushan, Kinhwa and Futsin. Around 1,700 Japanese troops died out of a total 10,000 Japanese soldiers who fell ill with disease when their biological weapons attack rebounded on their own forces.<ref name=\":1\">For citations, see the Wikipedia article on the [[Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign]].</ref>\n\n[[Shunroku Hata]], the commander of Japanese forces involved of the massacre of the 250,000 Chinese civilians, was sentenced 1948 in part due to his \"failure to prevent atrocities\".

The shuttle bombing run was a better carrier task force tactic since there was no need to wait for the returning aircraft.\n\nIf [[Claire Lee Chennault]] had been informed of the mission specifics, the outcome might have been very much better for the Americans. Chennault had built an effective air surveillance net in China that would have been extremely helpful in bringing the planes in for safe landings. The lack of visible beacons in the dark forced them to bail out.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Glines|first1=General James H. \"Jimmy\" Doolittle, with Carroll V.|title=I could never be so lucky again : an autobiography|date=1995|publisher=Schiffer Military/Aviation History|location=Atglen, PA|isbn=0-88740-737-4|pages=7, 10, 267}}</ref>\n\nChinese airfield crews recounted that due to the unexpectedly early arrivals of the B-25s, homing beacon and runway torch lights were not on for fear of possible Japanese airstrikes as happened before.

High command withdrew substantial air force resources from supporting offensive operations in order to defend the home islands; two carriers were diverted to the Alaskan island invasion to prevent them from being used as bomber bases and could not be used in the Midway operations. Thus, the raid's most significant strategic accomplishment was that it compelled the Japanese high command into ordering a very inefficient disposition of their forces, and poor decision-making due to fear of attack, for the rest of the war.\n\n== Effect ==\n[[File:Doolittle Raid Over Tokyo.ogv|thumb|1943 U.S. [[newsreel]] about the raid]]\nCompared with the future devastating [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] [[Air raids on Japan|attacks against Japan]], the Doolittle raid did little material damage, and all of it was easily repaired.

[[Mitsuo Fuchida]] and [[Shigeyoshi Miwa]] considered the \"one-way\" raid \"excellent strategy\", with the bombers evading Army fighters by flying \"much lower than anticipated\". Kuroshima said the raid \"passed like a shiver over Japan\" and Miwa criticised the Army for claiming to have shot down nine aircraft rather than \"not even one\".{{sfn|Prange|1982|p=25}}\n\nThe Imperial Japanese Navy also bore a special responsibility for allowing an American aircraft carrier force to approach the Japanese Home Islands in a manner similar to the IJN fleet to Hawaii in 1941, and permitting it to escape undamaged.{{refn|The Japanese, through a small amount of intercepted radio traffic between Halsey and Mitscher, were aware that an American carrier force was at large in the [[Western Pacific Ocean]] and could possibly attack Japan.<ref>Glines 1998, pp. 60\u201362.</ref>}} The fact that medium, normally land-based bombers carried out the attack confused the IJN's high command.

The centerpiece is a like-new B-25, which is painted and marked as Doolittle's aircraft, ''40-2344'', (rebuilt by [[North American Aviation]] to B-25B configuration from an F-10D photo reconnaissance version of the B-25D).

Several authentically dressed mannequins surround the aircraft, including representations of Doolittle, ''Hornet'' Captain [[Marc Mitscher]], and groups of Army and Navy men loading the bomber's bombs and ammunition. Also exhibited are the silver goblets used by the Raiders at each of their annual reunions, pieces of flight clothing and personal equipment, a parachute used by one of the Raiders in his bailout over China, and group photographs of all 16 crews, and other items.\n\n[[File:raiders-goblets-6-15-2013.jpg|left|thumb|Raiders' goblets]]\nThe last B-25 to be retired from the U.S. Air Force inventory is displayed at the [[Air Force Armament Museum]] at Eglin AFB, also in the markings of Gen.

Lawson]] \u2013 a pilot who participated in the raid, focuses on the experiences of himself and his crew. A popular film based on the book was released in 1944. Written while the war was still in progress, Lawson disguised the identities of the persons in China assisting the raiders and did not publish the story until after the USAAF had released an official communique on 20 April 1943 detailing most aspects of the mission, including the identities of the raiders and their fates.\n* ''Doolittle's Tokyo Raiders'', by C. V. Glines (1964) \u2013 tells the complete story of the raid, including the unique experiences of each B-25 crew. He followed this with a second account, ''The Doolittle Raid: America's daring first strike against Japan'' (1988), incorporating information from first-hand accounts of the Raiders and from Japanese sources.<ref>Glines 1988, p. 226.</ref>\n* ''Target Tokyo: Jimmy Doolittle and the Raid That Avenged Pearl Harbor'', by James M. Scott (2015) \u2013 based on scores of never-before-published records drawn from archives across four continents as well as new interviews with survivors.\n\n=== Films ===\nThe raid inspired several films. The 1943 [[RKO]] film ''[[Bombardier (film)|Bombardier]]'' starred [[Randolph Scott]] and [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]]. The climax of this movie is an attack on Japan by a group of B-17s.\n\nA highly fictionalized film in 1943, ''[[Destination Tokyo]]'' starring [[Cary Grant]], tangentially involved the raid, concentrating on the fictional submarine {{USS|Copperfin}}. The submarine's mission is to enter [[Tokyo Bay]] undetected and place a landing party ashore to obtain weather information vital to the upcoming Doolittle raid. The film suggests the raid did not launch until up-to-the-minute data were received. All the after-action reports indicated the raid launched without time for weather briefings because of the encounter with the picket ship.<ref name=\"doo\" />\n\nA 1944 film, ''[[The Purple Heart]]'' was a highly fictionalized account of the torture and execution of Doolittle Raid prisoners.\n\nThe Doolittle Raid was the subject of another 1944 feature film, ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'', based on the book of the same title by Ted Lawson, who was seriously injured in a crash landing off the coast of China. [[Spencer Tracy]] played Doolittle and [[Van Johnson]] portrayed Lawson. Footage from the film was later used for the opening scenes of ''[[Midway (1976 film)|Midway]]'' and in the TV miniseries ''[[War and Remembrance]]''.\n\nThe 2001 film ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' (with [[Alec Baldwin]] playing Doolittle) presented a heavily fictionalized version of the raid. The film used the retired World War II aircraft carrier {{USS|Lexington|CV-16|6}} in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], to stand in for a Japanese carrier, while the aircraft were launched from {{USS|Constellation|CV-64|6}}, standing in for ''Hornet'' from which the Doolittle Raid was launched. The film's portrayal of the planning of the raid, the air raid itself, and the raid's aftermath, is not historically accurate.<ref>Gutthman, Edward.

The video is based on ''The Amazing Story of Sergeant Jacob De Shazer: The Doolittle Raider Who Turned Missionary'' by C. Hoyt Watson. At the end of both the video and the book, DeShazer after the war meets [[Mitsuo Fuchida]], the commander and lead pilot of the Pearl Harbor attack.\n\n''Doolittle's Raiders: A Final Toast'', a documentary by Tim Gray and the World War II Foundation, released in 2015, has interviews with the few surviving members of the raid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwiifoundation.org/2015/05/02/doolittles-raiders-a-final-toast-documentary-to-premiere-at-the-gi-film-festival-in-washington-dc/|title=Doolittle's Raiders: A Final Toast Documentary to Premiere at the Capitol in Washington, DC|publisher=WWII Foundation |date=6 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe 2017 film \"[[The Chinese Widow]]\" aka \"The Hidden Soldier\" presented a heavily fictionalised version of the raid with [[Emile Hirsch]] playing a fictional Captain Jack Turner who was hidden from the Japanese in China by a Chinese widow and her daughter, after he parachutes from his B-25 near her village. [[Vincent Riotta]] played Jimmy Doolittle.\n\nThe raid is depicted in the 2019 film ''[[Midway (2019 film)|Midway]]'', with actor [[Aaron Eckhart]] portraying Jimmy Doolittle.

It was the first air operation to strike the Japanese archipelago. It demonstrated that the Japanese mainland was vulnerable to American air attack, served as retaliation for the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], and provided an important boost to American morale. The raid was planned, led by, and named after Lieutenant Colonel [[Jimmy Doolittle|James Doolittle]], later General of the United States Air Force.<ref>{{cite book |title=Official Register of Commissioned Officers of the United States Army |date=1926 |pages=165}}</ref><!--Doolittle did not receive his General Rank until 1985 actually when he was in the Air Force Reserves.

The plan called for them to bomb military targets in Japan and to continue westward to land in China. The bombing raid killed about 50 people, including civilians, and injured 400. Fifteen aircraft reached China but all crashed, while the 16th landed at [[Vladivostok]] in the Soviet Union. Of the 80 crew members, 77 survived the mission. Eight airmen were captured by Japanese Army in China; three were later executed. The B-25 that landed in the Soviet Union was confiscated and its crew interned for more than a year before being allowed to \"escape\" via [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|Soviet-occupied]] [[Imperial State of Iran|Iran]] with the help of the [[NKVD]]. Fourteen complete crews of five returned to the United States or to American forces, except for one crewman who was killed in action.<ref name=\"bravemen\" /><ref name=\"Glines 1998, pp. 166\u2013168\">Glines 1998, pp. 166\u201368.</ref>\n\nThe raid caused negligible material damage to Japan, but it had major psychological effects. In the United States, it raised morale. In Japan, it raised doubt about the ability of military leaders to defend the home islands, but the bombing and strafing of civilians also steeled Japanese resolve to gain retribution, and this was exploited for propaganda purposes.<ref name=\"hist reex\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.historynet.com/aftermath-doolittle-raid-reexamined.htm |title = Aftermath: How the Doolittle Raid Shook Japan|date = 27 July 2015}}</ref> It also pushed forward Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]'s plans to attack [[Midway Atoll|Midway Island]] in the Central Pacific, an attack that turned into a decisive defeat of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) by the U.S. Navy in the [[Battle of Midway]].

King]] on 10 January 1942 that he thought that twin-engined Army bombers could be launched from an aircraft carrier, after observing several at [[Naval Station Norfolk Chambers Field]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], where the runway was painted with the outline of a carrier deck for landing practice.<ref>Glines 1998, p. 13.</ref> \n\nDoolittle, a famous military test pilot, civilian aviator, and aeronautical engineer before the war, was assigned to Army Air Forces Headquarters to plan the raid. The aircraft to be used would need a cruising range of {{convert|2400|nmi|km}} with a {{convert|2000|lb|kg|adj=on}} bomb load, so Doolittle selected the B-25B Mitchell to carry out the mission. The range of the Mitchell was about 1,300 miles, so the bombers had to be modified to hold nearly twice the normal fuel reserves. Doolittle also considered the [[Martin B-26 Marauder]], [[Douglas B-18 Bolo]], and [[Douglas B-23 Dragon]],<ref>Glines 1998, p. 19.</ref> but the B-26 had questionable takeoff characteristics from a carrier deck and the B-23's wingspan was nearly 50-percent greater than the B-25's, reducing the number that could be taken aboard a carrier and posing risks to the ship's superstructure. The B-18 was one of the final two types that Doolittle considered, and he rejected it for the same reason.<ref>Glines 1998, pp. 19\u201320.</ref> The B-25 had yet to see combat,{{refn|The first bombing mission by B-25s preceded the Doolittle Raid by only 12 days. On 6 April 1942, six Mitchells bombed [[Gasmata]], [[New Britain]]. This was followed on 12 and 13 April by two days of attacks against [[Cebu City]] and [[Davao City|Davao]] in the Philippines.

The 17th BG had been the first group to receive B-25s, with all four of its squadrons equipped with the bomber by September 1941. The 17th not only was the first medium bomb group of the Army Air Corps, but in early 1942, also had the most experienced B-25 crews. Its first assignment following the entry of the United States into the war was to the U.S. [[Eighth Air Force]].<ref name=\"Craven and Cate 1948, p. 439.\">Craven and Cate 1948, p. 439.</ref>\n\nThe 17th BG, then flying antisubmarine patrols from [[Pendleton, Oregon]], was immediately moved cross-country to [[Columbia Army Air Base]] at [[West Columbia, South Carolina]], ostensibly to fly similar patrols off the east coast of the United States, but in actuality to prepare for the mission against Japan. The group officially transferred effective 9 February 1942 to Columbia, where its combat crews were offered the opportunity to volunteer for an \"extremely hazardous\", but unspecified mission.

With support provided by two senior airline managers, [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport|Wold-Chamberlain Field's]] maintenance hangar was the first modification center to become operational. From nearby [[Fort Snelling]], the 710th Military Police Battalion provided tight security around this hangar. B-25B aircraft modifications included the following:\n* Removal of the lower gun turret.\n* Installation of [[de-ice]]rs and [[Antifreeze|anti-icers]].\n* Mounting of steel blast plates on the fuselage around the upper turret.\n* Removal of the liaison radio set to save weight.\n* Installation of a 160-gallon collapsible neoprene auxiliary fuel tank, fixed to the top of the bomb bay, and installation of support mounts for additional fuel cells in the bomb bay, crawlway, and lower turret area, to increase fuel capacity from 646 to 1,141 [[U.S. gallon]]s (538 to 950 [[Gallon#Imperial gallon|imperial gallons]], or 2,445 to 4,319 L).\n* Installation of mock gun barrels in the tail cone.\n* Replacement of the [[Norden bombsight]] with a makeshift aiming sight devised by pilot Capt.

[[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] Henry L.

Dean E. Hallmark (sixth off) and 1st Lt. William G. Farrow (last off). On 15 August 1942, the United States learned from the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Consul (representative)|Consulate General]] in Shanghai that eight of the missing crew members were prisoners of the Japanese at the city's police headquarters. Two crewmen drowned after crash-landing in the ocean. On 19 October 1942, the Japanese announced that they had tried the eight prisoners and sentenced them all to death, but said several had received commutation of their sentences to life imprisonment. No names or details were given.\n\nThe story of the missing crews was revealed in February 1946 during a [[war crimes]] trial held in Shanghai to try four Japanese officers charged with mistreating the eight captured crewmen. Two of the missing crewmen, bombardier [[staff sergeant|S/Sgt.]] [[William John Dieter|William J. Dieter]] and flight engineer Sgt. Donald E. Fitzmaurice of Hallmark's crew, were found to have drowned when their B-25 crashed into the sea. Both of their remains were recovered after the war and were buried with military honors at [[Golden Gate National Cemetery]].\n\nThe other eight were captured: 1st Lt. Dean E. Hallmark, 1st Lt.

On 28 August 1942, Hallmark, Farrow, and gunner Spatz faced a war crimes trial by a Japanese court alleging they strafed and murdered Japanese civilians. At 16:30 on 15 October 1942, they were taken by truck to Public Cemetery Number 1 and executed by [[firing squad]].\n\n[[File:Doolittle Raider RL Hite blindfolded by Japanese 1942.jpg|thumb|left|Robert L.

The remaining men\u2014Nielsen, Hite, Barr and DeShazer\u2014eventually began receiving slightly better treatment and were given a copy of the Bible and a few other books. They were freed by American troops in August 1945. Four Japanese officers were tried for war crimes against the captured Doolittle Raiders, found guilty, and sentenced to hard labor, three for five years and one for nine years. Barr had been near death when liberated and remained behind in China recuperating until October, by which time he had begun to experience severe emotional problems. Untreated after transfer to [[Letterman Army Hospital]] and a military hospital in [[Clinton, Iowa]], Barr became suicidal and was held virtually incommunicado until November, when Doolittle's personal intervention resulted in treatment that led to his recovery.<ref>Glines 1988, pp. 202\u201304.</ref> DeShazer graduated from Seattle Pacific University in 1948 and returned to Japan as a [[missionary]], where he served for over 30 years.<ref>DeShazer Dixon, Carol Aiko.

Doolittle was promoted two grades to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] on 28 April while still in China, skipping the rank of colonel, and was presented with the [[Medal of Honor]] by Roosevelt upon his return to the United States in June. When General Doolittle toured the growing [[Eglin Field]] facility in July 1942 with commanding officer Col. [[Grandison Gardner]], the local paper of record (the ''Okaloosa News-Journal'', [[Crestview, Florida]]), while reporting his presence, made no mention of his still-secret recent training at Eglin.

Chinese estimates put the civilian death toll at 250,000. The Imperial Japanese Army had also spread [[cholera]], [[typhoid]], [[Plague (disease)|plague]] infected fleas and [[dysentery]] pathogens. The Japanese biological warfare [[Unit 731]] brought almost 300 pounds of [[paratyphoid]] and [[anthrax]] to be left in contaminated food and contaminated wells with the withdrawal of the army from areas around Yushan, Kinhwa and Futsin. Around 1,700 Japanese troops died out of a total 10,000 Japanese soldiers who fell ill with disease when their biological weapons attack rebounded on their own forces.<ref name=\":1\">For citations, see the Wikipedia article on the [[Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign]].</ref>\n\n[[Shunroku Hata]], the commander of Japanese forces involved of the massacre of the 250,000 Chinese civilians, was sentenced 1948 in part due to his \"failure to prevent atrocities\".

The shuttle bombing run was a better carrier task force tactic since there was no need to wait for the returning aircraft.\n\nIf [[Claire Lee Chennault]] had been informed of the mission specifics, the outcome might have been very much better for the Americans. Chennault had built an effective air surveillance net in China that would have been extremely helpful in bringing the planes in for safe landings. The lack of visible beacons in the dark forced them to bail out.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Glines|first1=General James H. \"Jimmy\" Doolittle, with Carroll V.|title=I could never be so lucky again : an autobiography|date=1995|publisher=Schiffer Military/Aviation History|location=Atglen, PA|isbn=0-88740-737-4|pages=7, 10, 267}}</ref>\n\nChinese airfield crews recounted that due to the unexpectedly early arrivals of the B-25s, homing beacon and runway torch lights were not on for fear of possible Japanese airstrikes as happened before.

High command withdrew substantial air force resources from supporting offensive operations in order to defend the home islands; two carriers were diverted to the Alaskan island invasion to prevent them from being used as bomber bases and could not be used in the Midway operations. Thus, the raid's most significant strategic accomplishment was that it compelled the Japanese high command into ordering a very inefficient disposition of their forces, and poor decision-making due to fear of attack, for the rest of the war.\n\n== Effect ==\n[[File:Doolittle Raid Over Tokyo.ogv|thumb|1943 U.S. [[newsreel]] about the raid]]\nCompared with the future devastating [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] [[Air raids on Japan|attacks against Japan]], the Doolittle raid did little material damage, and all of it was easily repaired.

The centerpiece is a like-new B-25, which is painted and marked as Doolittle's aircraft, ''40-2344'', (rebuilt by [[North American Aviation]] to B-25B configuration from an F-10D photo reconnaissance version of the B-25D). The bomber, which North American Aviation presented to the Raiders in 1958, rests on a reproduction of ''Hornet''{{'}}s flight deck. Several authentically dressed mannequins surround the aircraft, including representations of Doolittle, ''Hornet'' Captain [[Marc Mitscher]], and groups of Army and Navy men loading the bomber's bombs and ammunition. Also exhibited are the silver goblets used by the Raiders at each of their annual reunions, pieces of flight clothing and personal equipment, a parachute used by one of the Raiders in his bailout over China, and group photographs of all 16 crews, and other items.\n\n[[File:raiders-goblets-6-15-2013.jpg|left|thumb|Raiders' goblets]]\nThe last B-25 to be retired from the U.S. Air Force inventory is displayed at the [[Air Force Armament Museum]] at Eglin AFB, also in the markings of Gen.

Lawson]] \u2013 a pilot who participated in the raid, focuses on the experiences of himself and his crew. A popular film based on the book was released in 1944. Written while the war was still in progress, Lawson disguised the identities of the persons in China assisting the raiders and did not publish the story until after the USAAF had released an official communique on 20 April 1943 detailing most aspects of the mission, including the identities of the raiders and their fates.\n* ''Doolittle's Tokyo Raiders'', by C. V. Glines (1964) \u2013 tells the complete story of the raid, including the unique experiences of each B-25 crew. He followed this with a second account, ''The Doolittle Raid: America's daring first strike against Japan'' (1988), incorporating information from first-hand accounts of the Raiders and from Japanese sources.<ref>Glines 1988, p. 226.</ref>\n* ''Target Tokyo: Jimmy Doolittle and the Raid That Avenged Pearl Harbor'', by James M. Scott (2015) \u2013 based on scores of never-before-published records drawn from archives across four continents as well as new interviews with survivors.\n\n=== Films ===\nThe raid inspired several films. The 1943 [[RKO]] film ''[[Bombardier (film)|Bombardier]]'' starred [[Randolph Scott]] and [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]]. The climax of this movie is an attack on Japan by a group of B-17s.\n\nA highly fictionalized film in 1943, ''[[Destination Tokyo]]'' starring [[Cary Grant]], tangentially involved the raid, concentrating on the fictional submarine {{USS|Copperfin}}. The submarine's mission is to enter [[Tokyo Bay]] undetected and place a landing party ashore to obtain weather information vital to the upcoming Doolittle raid. The film suggests the raid did not launch until up-to-the-minute data were received. All the after-action reports indicated the raid launched without time for weather briefings because of the encounter with the picket ship.<ref name=\"doo\" />\n\nA 1944 film, ''[[The Purple Heart]]'' was a highly fictionalized account of the torture and execution of Doolittle Raid prisoners.\n\nThe Doolittle Raid was the subject of another 1944 feature film, ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'', based on the book of the same title by Ted Lawson, who was seriously injured in a crash landing off the coast of China. [[Spencer Tracy]] played Doolittle and [[Van Johnson]] portrayed Lawson. Footage from the film was later used for the opening scenes of ''[[Midway (1976 film)|Midway]]'' and in the TV miniseries ''[[War and Remembrance]]''.\n\nThe 2001 film ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' (with [[Alec Baldwin]] playing Doolittle) presented a heavily fictionalized version of the raid. The film used the retired World War II aircraft carrier {{USS|Lexington|CV-16|6}} in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], to stand in for a Japanese carrier, while the aircraft were launched from {{USS|Constellation|CV-64|6}}, standing in for ''Hornet'' from which the Doolittle Raid was launched. The film's portrayal of the planning of the raid, the air raid itself, and the raid's aftermath, is not historically accurate.<ref>Gutthman, Edward.

The video is based on ''The Amazing Story of Sergeant Jacob De Shazer: The Doolittle Raider Who Turned Missionary'' by C. Hoyt Watson. At the end of both the video and the book, DeShazer after the war meets [[Mitsuo Fuchida]], the commander and lead pilot of the Pearl Harbor attack.\n\n''Doolittle's Raiders: A Final Toast'', a documentary by Tim Gray and the World War II Foundation, released in 2015, has interviews with the few surviving members of the raid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwiifoundation.org/2015/05/02/doolittles-raiders-a-final-toast-documentary-to-premiere-at-the-gi-film-festival-in-washington-dc/|title=Doolittle's Raiders: A Final Toast Documentary to Premiere at the Capitol in Washington, DC|publisher=WWII Foundation |date=6 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe 2017 film \"[[The Chinese Widow]]\" aka \"The Hidden Soldier\" presented a heavily fictionalised version of the raid with [[Emile Hirsch]] playing a fictional Captain Jack Turner who was hidden from the Japanese in China by a Chinese widow and her daughter, after he parachutes from his B-25 near her village. [[Vincent Riotta]] played Jimmy Doolittle.\n\nThe raid is depicted in the 2019 film ''[[Midway (2019 film)|Midway]]'', with actor [[Aaron Eckhart]] portraying Jimmy Doolittle.

There is only one way to go, really.  Over the years, I have really worked on my sound, it didn\u2019t just happen overnight.

In an interview with Keyboard Magazine Don Airey explained that he preferred the Hammond A-100 over other organs (including the Hammond B-3) for their \"purer tone\" in live settings.  He also uses Leslie 122 speakers and a [[Hughes & Kettner|Hughes and Kettner]] Puretone amplifier.
