Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the {{convert|6.1|mi|km|1|adj=on}} '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the {{convert|6.6|mi|km|1|adj=on}} '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the Portland's [[NS Line|first modern streetcar line]] on the west side. After several years of planning, the city council approved the Eastside Loop extension in 2008 and a groundbreaking was held the following year. The extension's first {{convert|3.3|mi|km}} opened between the Broadway Bridge and OMSI on September 22, 2012. It was inaugurated by the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line''') service, which ran an additional {{convert|1.1|mi|km}} alongside the NS Line on 10th and 11th avenues. The CL Line was re-branded in 2015 during the opening of Tilikum Crossing, which completed the streetcar loop with a southerly river crossing connection between OMSI and the South Waterfront.\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Broadway Bridge west end.jpg|thumb|left|The Broadway Bridge in 2009, prior to the installation of streetcar tracks]]\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

system. Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the {{convert|6.1|mi|km|1|adj=on}} '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the {{convert|6.6|mi|km|1|adj=on}} '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the Portland's [[NS Line|first modern streetcar line]] on the west side. After several years of planning, the city council approved the Eastside Loop extension in 2008 and the project's groundbreaking took place in 2009. The extension's first {{convert|3.3|mi|km}} opened between the Broadway Bridge and OMSI on September 22, 2012. It was inaugurated by the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line''') service, which ran an additional {{convert|1.1|mi|km}} alongside the NS Line on 10th and 11th avenues. The CL Line was re-branded in 2015 during the opening of Tilikum Crossing, which completed the streetcar loop with a southerly river crossing connection between OMSI and the South Waterfront.\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Broadway Bridge west end.jpg|thumb|left|The Broadway Bridge in 2009, prior to the installation of streetcar tracks]]\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

Changes to the propulsion system necessitated changes to the streetcar design in order for the streetcar to accommodate a different form factor; this ultimately delayed the project and raised the cost of manufacturing.<ref name=\"oreg-2011jul19\">{{cite news |last=Schmidt |first=Brad |title=Portland's $148.3 million eastside streetcar project delayed five months, includes five streetcars instead of six |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=July 19, 2011 |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2011/07/portlands_1483_million_eastsid.html |accessdate=September 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Opening and closing of the loop===\n\nThe {{convert|3.3|mi|km|adj=on}} eastside extension opened on September 22, 2012, after a five-month-long delay.<ref name=\"PS-History\">{{cite web|title=Streetcar History |url=http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/33 |publisher=Portland Streetcar |accessdate=September 7, 2015 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203013400/http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/33 |archivedate=December 3, 2013 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Schmidt |first=Brad |date=July 19, 2011 |title=Portland's $148.3 million eastside streetcar project delayed five months, includes five streetcars instead of six |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2011/07/portlands_1483_million_eastsid.html |newspaper=The Oregonian |accessdate=September 17, 2015}}</ref> Due to overlapping sections, the new eastside service was branded the \"Central Loop Line\" (abbreviated as CL Line) and the original service on the west side was renamed the \"North South Line\" (NS Line).<ref name=\"ps-map-2012\">{{cite map |url=https://www.portlandstreetcar.org/pdf/map_printable5.pdf |title=Streetcar Route Map |publisher=Portland Streetcar, Inc. |date=September 2012 |access-date=October 1, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021024223/http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/pdf/map_printable5.pdf |archive-date=October 21, 2012 |url-status=unfit}}</ref> The CL Line ran an additional {{convert|1.1|mi|km}} along the NS Line tracks on 10th and 11th avenues, between Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland and Northwest Northrup Street in the Pearl District, before it ran to the eastside for OMSI\u2014a total of {{convert|4.4|mi|km}}.<ref name=\"PS-History\"/> Service along the eastside segment initially operated with frequencies of 18 minutes instead of an originally planned 15 minutes due to funding cuts by TriMet and the City of Portland, as well as delays in streetcar delivery from United Streetcar.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rose |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Rose (journalist) |date=September 21, 2012 |title=Portland Streetcar's eastside loop gets off to hobbled start Saturday |url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/commuting/2012/09/portland_streetcars_eastside_l.html |newspaper=The Oregonian |accessdate=September 7, 2015}}</ref> The first car finally arrived in January 2013 and entered service on June 11, 2013.<ref name=\"oreg-2013jun12\">{{cite news|last=Schmidt|first=Brad|title=New streetcar rolls out in Portland<!--(print-edition headline)--> |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=June 12, 2013 |page=B1 |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2013/06/after_repeated_delays_portland.html |accessdate=August 6, 2013}}</ref> Fares were $1 upon opening due to TriMet's elimination of the [[Fareless Square|Free Rail Zone]].<ref>{{cite news |date=October 5, 2012 |title=Portland Streetcar Introduces 'Central Loop' Service |url=http://newsmanager.commpartners.com/aptapt/issues/2012-10-05/3.html |work=Passenger Transport |publisher=[[American Public Transportation Association]] |accessdate=September 8, 2015}}</ref> Approximately 3,200 riders per weekday used the line during the first two weeks of service.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/portland/news/2012/10/31/eastside-streetcar-carrying-the-wait.html |last=Giegerich |first=Andy |title=Eastside streetcar: Carrying the wait |newspaper=Portland Business Journal |date=October 31, 2012 |access-date=April 5, 2020 |url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\n[[File:A Lloyd via Peral (21612375879).jpg|thumb|left|An A Loop streetcar on Tilikum Crossing in 2015]]\n\nThe second phase of the Eastside Loop project, referred to as \"Close the Loop\", extended the streetcar from OMSI to the NS Line tracks on Southwest Moody Avenue in the [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/321180 |title=Portland Streetcar System Concept Plan: A Framework for Future Corridor Planning and Alternatives Analysis |publisher=Portland Bureau of Transportation |date=September 9, 2009 |access-date=April 10, 2020}}</ref>{{rp|50}} This phase had awaited the construction of a new bridge for the Portland\u2013Milwaukie light rail project.

Calhoun County is at the tip of the peninsula formed by the courses of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Illinois River|Illinois]] rivers above their confluence and is almost completely surrounded by water.

It was named for [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[John C. Calhoun]], in addition to the Calhoun family that was prominent in the area at the time. The southern side of the county, covered in thick forest, was untouched until the population began to expand in the late 1840s with the arrival of [[German people|German]] immigrants. Land was cleared for farming, exporting lumber, and constructing spacious log barns, typically {{convert|200|sqft|m2}} in size, which were a \"trademark of successful German farmers.\"<ref>{{cite journal | author = Price, H. Wayne | title = The Double-Crib Log Barns of Calhoun County | journal = Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society | volume = 73 | issue = 2 | date = Summer 1980 | pages = 140\u2013160}}</ref>\n\n[[image: Calhoun County Illinois 1825.png|Calhoun County at the time of its creation in 1825.]]\n\nThe territory was originally settled by [[Indigenous people of North America|indigenous people]] who occupied the resource-rich river valleys near waterways.  The remains of their occupation have provided some of the most valuable [[archaeological]] information in the country.  The county's archaeological record chronicles more than 10,000 years of continuous human occupation by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]].\n\nIn 1680, French explorer Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle recorded in his diary historic Native American raids by the Iroquois against the Illinois tribes along the Illinois River. La Salle recounts the aftermath of a massacre of the Illinois by the Iroquois in South Calhoun County writing, \"As the French drew near to the mouth of the Illinois, they saw a meadow to the right, and, on the farthest verge, several human figures erect, yet motionless. They landed and cautiously examined the place. The long grass was trampled down and all around were strewn the relics of the hideous orgies which formed the ordinary sequel of an Iroquois victory. The figures they had seen were the half consumed bodies of women still bound to the stakes where they had been tortured. Other sights there were, too revolting for record. All the remains were of women and children; the men, it seems, had fled, and left them to their fate. The French descended the river and soon came to the mouth.\"<ref name=\"archive.org\">https://archive.org/stream/historyofcalhoun00carp/historyofcalhoun00carp_djvu.txt</ref> The massacre is noted as taking place in the last week of November, 1680, about a mile above the  site of the Deer Plain Ferry which is no longer in operation, at a place now known as Marshall's Landing. Many skulls, parts of skeletons, and weapons have still been found near this spot by farmers during plowing.<ref name=\"archive.org\"/>\n\nThe first European settler to make his home in what is now Calhoun County was a man only known today by his last name, O'Neal. He came in the year 1801 and settled in the south part of the county at Point Precinct at what has been called \"Two Branches\". Although his name might have one assume differently, O'Neal was a French trapper and had made his way there from Acadia. O'Neal lived in Point Precinct a number of years before any other European settlers came to that region, and when they did come he refused to mingle with them. He lived in a small cave which he had dug, and which was located about a quarter of a mile from the Mississippi River. He continued to live in this cave until his death in 1842, and after that he was referred to as \"The Hermit\" due to the fact that he would not visit the other settlers or allow them to come to his place. In 1850, Soloman Lammy, who then owned the farm upon which the cave was located.\n\nThe next settlers to come to the area were French trappers and people of mixed ancestry, who started a community about a mile above what was called the Deep Plain Ferry, on the Illinois River, in the southern part of the county. They remained until about 1815 when they were driven out by the very high water. Another French settlement was located at Cap au Gris (which means Cape of Grit or Grindstone). This place was located at the site of what was once the West Point Ferry, in Richwoods Precinct. The French settlers who lived here came sometime after 1800 and by the year 1811 there were 20 families, who had a small village on the bank of the river, and cultivated a common field of about 500 acres. The field was located on the level land about a mile from the site of their town. One writer said that these families were driven away by the Native Americans in 1814, but there is some doubt as to the accuracy of the statement as John Shaw who took part in battles with the natives in the region and was a community leader at the time does not mention in his writings any harm coming to the settlers at Cap au Gris.\n\nAs early pioneers continued to settle in Calhoun County there is evidence of troubled relations between the European settlers and the Native Americans. There are two known cases on kidnapping of settler's children. One being the three-year-old son of Jacob Pruden. Mr. Pruden settled in the county in 1829 near what was called the old Seuier place, about five miles below the present site of Hardin. The boy was recaptured from the Native Americans five days after he had been taken, and had not been harmed. The second case was the kidnapping of Joe DeGerlia, the son of Antoine DeGerlia, Sr., the first settler in the French Hollow area. Mr. DeGerlia had not yet finished building his home, when his small son, Joe, was taken, however the family oral history may suggest Joe was bartered or sold. Nearly thirty years later a man who was acquainted with the history of the DeGerlia family was traveling among the tribes of the Indian Territory, and there he heard the story of a boy that had been kidnapped many years before from a place not far from where the Illinois River flows into the Mississippi. He investigated the story and found that the boy was Joe DeGerlia of a family in Calhoun. Joe had been taught the Native's language and had grown to manhood among the remnants of the tribe that had taken him southwest. Joe returned to Calhoun, married, and lived in the French Hollow area. The descendants of the DeGerlia family are still living on the same land Antoine DeGerlia settled over 200 years ago.<ref name=\"archive.org\"/>\n\nThe most well-known historical event to impact Calhoun County is likely the Great Flood of 1993. Calhoun County is a peninsula nestled between the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers, which both saw record flooding during 1993. The Great Flood of 1993, the name it is now known as, impacted several villages in Calhoun and completely destroyed the village of East Hardin which once sat across the Joe Page Bridge when the Nutwood levee broke in August 1993. The flood also closed all crossings over the rivers in the county including the bridge in Hardin and all ferries, leaving residents without access to groceries, gasoline, or other supplies. All supplies needed had to be flown in via helicopter or retrieved on a 2 hour long drive north via the only road existing Calhoun without a water passage or was not covered by flood water. The Great Flood of 1993 was devastating to Calhoun County because it destroyed homes, infrastructure, and caused many residents to leave. The population of the county has yet to recover.\n\n==Marquette and Joliet Exploration==\n\nIn the town of Grafton, IL, downriver from Calhoun County, a statue was placed to mark where Marquette and Joliet are claimed to have landed during their famous exploration. They base their claims upon one of Marquette's diary entries. In the entry Marquette mentions that they entered the mouth of the Illinois River early in the morning, which would mean that the party had camped somewhere below the mouth during the previous evening. The territory about Grafton is high and a desirable place to camp, while the land opposite, on the Missouri side is low and swampy and would have made an undesirable camping place. However, local historians in Calhoun County claim that the true stopping point of the expedition is a place now called \"Perrin's Ledge\", located several miles above Kampsville, IL. Their claims seem to be much better supported by Marquette's diary where he writes, \"We entered the mouth of the Illinois River very early in the morning\", and further on he says: \"We spent the night with some friendly Indians.\" From other parts of the diary we find that the party was traveling about twenty -five miles a day up the Mississippi River, but it is likely that they made better time on the Illinois River because there would be less current. If they were traveling at a rate of slightly better than twenty-five miles a day and entered the river early in the morning (this was the last week in August) they would have been in the Kampsville area by evening. At the place now called \"Perrin's Ledge\" several large Indian mounds are to be found and the first settlers in this part of the county found evidences to show that a small Indian village had been located here. Here at the ledge, the bluff is very near to the water and the rocks project themselves in such a manner that they can be seen for miles down the river. From a distance they have the appearance of the walls of a castle. There can be little doubt that it was at this place that the Marquette-Joliet party stopped for the night.<ref name=\"archive.org\"/>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|284|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|254|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|30|sqmi}} (10.5%) is water.<ref name=\"census-density\"/>\n\nCalhoun County is a narrow {{convert|37|mi|km|adj=on}}-long peninsula of mostly high, rolling ground located between the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Illinois River]].  The rolling hills escaped the leveling of [[glacier]]s.\n\nCounty transportation is served by two state-operated, free [[ferry|ferries]] crossing the Illinois River (the [[Brussels, Illinois|Brussels]] Ferry in the south and the [[Kampsville, Illinois|Kampsville]] ferry in the north).  ''The Golden Eagle'' ferry, which is privately operated and charges a toll, crosses the Mississippi River to [[St. Charles County, Missouri]].  A bridge spans the Illinois River at [[Hardin, Illinois|Hardin]].  Land routes connect to the north to bordering [[Pike County, Illinois|Pike County]].\n\nWhen transportation was mainly by river, the county had many prosperous farms and orchards. It still produces a major portion of the peach crop of Illinois, and farmers raise corn and other commodities.  The hotel in Brussels dates from 1847, when it was a stagecoach stop.\n\nTourists visit the area for the natural environment of the Illinois River valley and for its proximity to the [[Great River Road]] on the Illinois side.  It includes part of the [[Two Rivers National Wildlife Refuge]] and attracts thousands of birds in [[bird migration|migration]] seasons as part of the [[Mississippi Flyway]].  The county has several designated historic districts in the villages and properties listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nCalhoun County was added to the [[Greater St. Louis|St. Louis Metropolitan Statistical Area]] in 2003, along with [[Bond County, Illinois|Bond]] and [[Macoupin County, Illinois|Macoupin]] counties in Illinois, and [[Washington County, Missouri]].\n\nThe [[Center for American Archeology]] is located in [[Kampsville, Illinois|Kampsville]] in the northern part of the county.  It has been the center for study of [[prehistoric]] [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] culture in the area.  It has created educational opportunities for children and adults to participate in its archaeological digs.\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n* [[Greene County, Illinois|Greene County]] \u2013 northeast\n* [[Jersey County, Illinois|Jersey County]] \u2013 east\n* [[St. Charles County, Missouri|St. Charles County]], [[Missouri]] \u2013 south\n* [[Lincoln County, Missouri|Lincoln County]], [[Missouri]] \u2013 west\n* [[Pike County, Illinois|Pike County]], [[Illinois]] \u2013 north\n* [[Pike County, Missouri|Pike County]], [[Missouri]] \u2013 northwest\n\n===National protected area===\n* [[Two Rivers National Wildlife Refuge]] (part)\n\n===Major highways===\n* [[Image:Illinois 16.svg|25px]] [[Illinois Route 16]]\n* [[Image:Illinois 96.svg|25px]] [[Illinois Route 96]]\n* [[Image:Illinois 100.svg|25px]] [[Illinois Route 100]]\n* [[Image:Illinois 108.svg|25px]] [[Illinois Route 108]]\n\n==Climate and weather==\n{{climate chart\n|[[Hardin, Illinois]]\n|19|39|2.01\n|24|46|2.02\n|33|58|3.54\n|43|70|3.84\n|52|78|4.10\n|61|86|3.45\n|66|90|3.43\n|63|88|3.20\n|55|81|3.30\n|44|70|2.84\n|35|56|3.53\n|24|43|2.99\n|float=right\n|units=imperial\n|clear=both\n|source=The Weather Channel<ref name=\"weather\">{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USIL0512\n  |title=Monthly Averages for Hardin, Illinois\n  |accessdate=January 27, 2011\n  |publisher=The Weather Channel\n}}</ref>}}\nIn recent years, average temperatures in the county seat of Hardin have ranged from a low of {{convert|19|\u00b0F}} in January to a high of {{convert|90|\u00b0F}} in July, although a record low of {{convert|-24|\u00b0F}} was recorded in January 1979 and a record high of {{convert|116|\u00b0F}} was recorded in July 1954.

It was named for [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[John C. Calhoun]], in addition to the Calhoun family that was prominent in the area at the time. The southern side of the county, covered in thick forest, was untouched until the population began to expand in the late 1840s with the arrival of [[German people|German]] immigrants. Land was cleared for farming, exporting lumber, and constructing spacious log barns, typically {{convert|200|sqft|m2}} in size, which were a \"trademark of successful German farmers.\"<ref>{{cite journal | author = Price, H. Wayne | title = The Double-Crib Log Barns of Calhoun County | journal = Journal of the Illinois State Historical Society | volume = 73 | issue = 2 | date = Summer 1980 | pages = 140\u2013160}}</ref>\n\n[[image: Calhoun County Illinois 1825.png|Calhoun County at the time of its creation in 1825.]]\n\nThe territory was originally settled by [[Indigenous people of North America|indigenous people]] who occupied the resource-rich river valleys near waterways.  The remains of their occupation have provided some of the most valuable [[archaeological]] information in the country.  The county's archaeological record chronicles more than 10,000 years of continuous human occupation by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]].\n\nIn 1680, French explorer Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle recorded in his diary historic Native American raids by the Iroquois against the Illinois tribes along the Illinois River. La Salle recounts the aftermath of a massacre of the Illinois by the Iroquois in South Calhoun County writing, \"As the French drew near to the mouth of the Illinois, they saw a meadow to the right, and, on the farthest verge, several human figures erect, yet motionless. They landed and cautiously examined the place. The long grass was trampled down and all around were strewn the relics of the hideous orgies which formed the ordinary sequel of an Iroquois victory. The figures they had seen were the half consumed bodies of women still bound to the stakes where they had been tortured. Other sights there were, too revolting for record. All the remains were of women and children; the men, it seems, had fled, and left them to their fate. The French descended the river and soon came to the mouth.\"<ref name=\"archive.org\">https://archive.org/stream/historyofcalhoun00carp/historyofcalhoun00carp_djvu.txt</ref> The massacre is noted as taking place in the last week of November, 1680, about a mile above the  site of the Deer Plain Ferry which is no longer in operation, at a place now known as Marshall's Landing. Many skulls, parts of skeletons, and weapons have still been found near this spot by farmers during plowing.<ref name=\"archive.org\"/>\n \nThe first European settler to make his home in what is now Calhoun County was a man only known today by his last name, O'Neal. He came in the year 1801 and settled in the south part of the county at Point Precinct at what has been called \"Two Branches\". Although his name might have one assume differently, O'Neal was a French trapper and had made his way there from Acadia. O'Neal lived in Point Precinct a number of years before any other European settlers came to that region, and when they did come he refused to mingle with them. He lived in a small cave which he had dug, and which was located about a quarter of a mile from the Mississippi River. He continued to live in this cave until his death in 1842, and after that he was referred to as \"The Hermit\" due to the fact that he would not visit the other settlers or allow them to come to his place. In 1850, Soloman Lammy, who then owned the farm upon which the cave was located.\n\nThe next settlers to come to the area were French trappers and people of mixed ancestry, who started a community about a mile above what was called the Deep Plain Ferry, on the Illinois River, in the southern part of the county. They remained until about 1815 when they were driven out by the very high water. Another French settlement was located at Cap au Gris (which means Cape of Grit or Grindstone). This place was located at the site of what was once the West Point Ferry, in Richwoods Precinct. The French settlers who lived here came sometime after 1800 and by the year 1811 there were 20 families, who had a small village on the bank of the river, and cultivated a common field of about 500 acres. The field was located on the level land about a mile from the site of their town. One writer said that these families were driven away by the Native Americans in 1814, but there is some doubt as to the accuracy of the statement as John Shaw who took part in battles with the natives in the region and was a community leader at the time does not mention in his writings any harm coming to the settlers at Cap au Gris.\n\nAs early pioneers continued to settle in Calhoun County there is evidence of troubled relations between the European settlers and the Native Americans. There are two known cases on kidnapping of settler's children. One being the three-year-old son of Jacob Pruden. Mr. Pruden settled in the county in 1829 near what was called the old Seuier place, about five miles below the present site of Hardin. The boy was recaptured from the Native Americans five days after he had been taken, and had not been harmed. The second case was the kidnapping of Joe DeGerlia, the son of Antoine DeGerlia, Sr., the first settler in the French Hollow area. Mr. DeGerlia had not yet finished building his home, when his small son, Joe, was taken, however the family oral history may suggest Joe was bartered or sold. Nearly thirty years later a man who was acquainted with the history of the DeGerlia family was traveling among the tribes of the Indian Territory, and there he heard the story of a boy that had been kidnapped many years before from a place not far from where the Illinois River flows into the Mississippi. He investigated the story and found that the boy was Joe DeGerlia of a family in Calhoun. Joe had been taught the Native's language and had grown to manhood among the remnants of the tribe that had taken him southwest. Joe returned to Calhoun, married, and lived in the French Hollow area. The descendants of the DeGerlia family are still living on the same land Antoine DeGerlia settled over 200 years ago.<ref name=\"archive.org\"/>\n\nThe most well-known historical event to impact Calhoun County is likely the Great Flood of 1993. Calhoun County is a peninsula nestled between the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers, which both saw record flooding during 1993. The Great Flood of 1993, the name it is now known as, impacted several villages in Calhoun and completely destroyed the village of East Hardin which once sat across the Joe Page Bridge when the Nutwood levee broke in August 1993. The flood also closed all crossings over the rivers in the county including the bridge in Hardin and all ferries, leaving residents without access to groceries, gasoline, or other supplies. All supplies needed had to be flown in via helicopter or retrieved on a 2 hour long drive north via the only road existing Calhoun without a water passage or was not covered by flood water. The Great Flood of 1993 was devastating to Calhoun County because it destroyed homes, infrastructure, and caused many residents to leave. The population of the county has yet to recover.\n\n==Marquette and Joliet Exploration==\n\nIn the town of Grafton, IL, downriver from Calhoun County, a statue was placed to mark where Marquette and Joliet are claimed to have landed during their famous exploration. They base their claims upon one of Marquette's diary entries. In the entry Marquette mentions that they entered the mouth of the Illinois River early in the morning, which would mean that the party had camped somewhere below the mouth during the previous evening. The territory about Grafton is high and a desirable place to camp, while the land opposite, on the Missouri side is low and swampy and would have made an undesirable camping place. However, local historians in Calhoun County claim that the true stopping point of the expedition is a place now called \"Perrin's Ledge\", located several miles above Kampsville, IL. Their claims seem to be much better supported by Marquette's diary where he writes, \"We entered the mouth of the Illinois River very early in the morning\", and further on he says: \"We spent the night with some friendly Indians.\" From other parts of the diary we find that the party was traveling about twenty -five miles a day up the Mississippi River, but it is likely that they made better time on the Illinois River because there would be less current. If they were traveling at a rate of slightly better than twenty-five miles a day and entered the river early in the morning (this was the last week in August) they would have been in the Kampsville area by evening. At the place now called \"Perrin's Ledge\" several large Indian mounds are to be found and the first settlers in this part of the county found evidences to show that a small Indian village had been located here. Here at the ledge, the bluff is very near to the water and the rocks project themselves in such a manner that they can be seen for miles down the river. From a distance they have the appearance of the walls of a castle. There can be little doubt that it was at this place that the Marquette-Joliet party stopped for the night.<ref name=\"archive.org\"/>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|284|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|254|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|30|sqmi}} (10.5%) is water.<ref name=\"census-density\"/>\n\nCalhoun County is a narrow {{convert|37|mi|km|adj=on}}-long peninsula of mostly high, rolling ground located between the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Illinois River]].  The rolling hills escaped the leveling of [[glacier]]s.\n\nCounty transportation is served by two state-operated, free [[ferry|ferries]] crossing the Illinois River (the [[Brussels, Illinois|Brussels]] Ferry in the south and the [[Kampsville, Illinois|Kampsville]] ferry in the north).  ''The Golden Eagle'' ferry, which is privately operated and charges a toll, crosses the Mississippi River to [[St. Charles County, Missouri]].  A bridge spans the Illinois River at [[Hardin, Illinois|Hardin]].  Land routes connect to the north to bordering [[Pike County, Illinois|Pike County]].\n\nWhen transportation was mainly by river, the county had many prosperous farms and orchards. It still produces a major portion of the peach crop of Illinois, and farmers raise corn and other commodities.  The hotel in Brussels dates from 1847, when it was a stagecoach stop.\n\nTourists visit the area for the natural environment of the Illinois River valley and for its proximity to the [[Great River Road]] on the Illinois side.  It includes part of the [[Two Rivers National Wildlife Refuge]] and attracts thousands of birds in [[bird migration|migration]] seasons as part of the [[Mississippi Flyway]].  The county has several designated historic districts in the villages and properties listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nCalhoun County was added to the [[Greater St. Louis|St. Louis Metropolitan Statistical Area]] in 2003, along with [[Bond County, Illinois|Bond]] and [[Macoupin County, Illinois|Macoupin]] counties in Illinois, and [[Washington County, Missouri]].\n\nThe [[Center for American Archeology]] is located in [[Kampsville, Illinois|Kampsville]] in the northern part of the county.  It has been the center for study of [[prehistoric]] [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] culture in the area.  It has created educational opportunities for children and adults to participate in its archaeological digs.\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n*[[Greene County, Illinois|Greene County]] &ndash; northeast\n*[[Jersey County, Illinois|Jersey County]] &ndash; east\n*[[St. Charles County, Missouri|St. Charles County]], [[Missouri]] &ndash; south\n*[[Lincoln County, Missouri|Lincoln County]], [[Missouri]] &ndash; west\n*[[Pike County, Illinois|Pike County]], [[Illinois]] &ndash; north\n*[[Pike County, Missouri|Pike County]], [[Missouri]] &ndash; northwest\n\n===National protected area===\n* [[Two Rivers National Wildlife Refuge]] (part)\n\n===Major highways===\n* [[Image:Illinois 16.svg|25px]] [[Illinois Route 16]]\n* [[Image:Illinois 96.svg|25px]] [[Illinois Route 96]]\n* [[Image:Illinois 100.svg|25px]] [[Illinois Route 100]]\n* [[Image:Illinois 108.svg|25px]] [[Illinois Route 108]]\n\n==Climate and weather==\n{{climate chart\n|[[Hardin, Illinois]]\n|19|39|2.01\n|24|46|2.02\n|33|58|3.54\n|43|70|3.84\n|52|78|4.10\n|61|86|3.45\n|66|90|3.43\n|63|88|3.20\n|55|81|3.30\n|44|70|2.84\n|35|56|3.53\n|24|43|2.99\n|float=right\n|units=imperial\n|clear=both\n|source=The Weather Channel<ref name=\"weather\">{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USIL0512\n  |title=Monthly Averages for Hardin, Illinois\n  |accessdate=January 27, 2011\n  |publisher=The Weather Channel\n}}</ref>}}\nIn recent years, average temperatures in the county seat of Hardin have ranged from a low of {{convert|19|\u00b0F}} in January to a high of {{convert|90|\u00b0F}} in July, although a record low of {{convert|-24|\u00b0F}} was recorded in January 1979 and a record high of {{convert|116|\u00b0F}} was recorded in July 1954.

Compared to the standard front bumper of the W212, which is similar to the one used on the W205 C-Class, the W213 E-Class' proposal is more aggressive, composed and simple.<ref name=\"W213vsW212\">http://www.carscoops.com/2016/01/evolution-or-revolution-new-vs-old.html</ref> The classic iconic grille, has simpler, flowing lines, with a more imposing presence on W213, while the sport variant (with the big logo in the middle) isn't so different from the W212. The S-Class inspired, sweptback (first time in Mercedes executive-class history) and rather compact headlights are the styling feature of the W213 model.<ref name=\"W213vsW212\"/>\n\nOn both cars the doors sit pretty high, squeezing the windows, but the W212 masks this \"trait\" with a subtle slope towards the headlights. In fact, on the profile of the facelifted W212, it still retains the edgy lines that came out in 2009.<ref name=\"W213vsW212\"/> At the back, the W213 adopted a fresh design for the lights similar to the S-Class.

The car is able scan the surrounding area as well as the car in front if road markings are unclear to maintain lane discipline.<ref name=\"techspecs\"/> The system is also able to automatically increase or decrease the E-Class's speed by reading speed limit signs if the driver fails to take any action.<ref name=\"techspecs\"/>\n\n=== Safety innovations ===\n'''Active Brake Assist''' and '''Evasive Steering Assist''' work in tandem to warn of and prevent potential collisions in the 2017 E-Class. The first system now features increased functionality, able to provide visible warning of potential danger as well as being able to automatically apply the brakes in an emergency. The system is now also able to detect and analyze moving traffic at junctions ahead. Evasive Steering Assist can detect when a driver is making an evasive action and apply additional steering force to ensure the pedestrian or vehicle is avoided.<ref name=\"techspecs\"/>\n\n'''Car-to-X Communication''' is another safety system which enables vehicles on the same road to warn each other of upcoming potential hazards or accidents.<ref name=\"techspecs\"/>\n\nIf an unavoidable side collision is detected, '''PRE-SAFE Impulse Side''' rapidly inflates the side bolster to move the occupant away from the point of impact, while at the same time '''PRE-SAFE Sound''' pumps noise waves through the speakers to reduce hearing damage following a collision.<ref name=\"techspecs\"/>\n\n=== Mobile connection ===\nA brand new remote parking smartphone app, called '''Remote Parking Pilot''', will allow drivers to park their vehicle from outside of the car to allow for easier ingress and egress. The system only works at very low speeds of 2&nbsp;mph, with the vehicle also able to lock, unlock and start itself from the app.<ref name=\"techspecs\"/>\n\nAnother new smartphone feature is '''Digital Car Key''', which allows the driver's smartphone to be used as a vehicle key - essentially replacing a conventional key fob. The system uses [[near field communication]] which also allows the car to be locked and unlocked even if the phone is out of battery.<ref name=\"techspecs\"/>\n\n=== Adaptive LED Matrix Lighting ===\n[[File:Mercedes-Benz E 250 Stationwagon AVANTGARDE Sports \uff08S213, leather seat\uff09front (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Adaptive LED Matrix Lighting]]\nIntroduced on the [[Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class (W218)|CLS]] for 2014, Mercedes\u2019 [[Headlamp#LED|Multibeam LED]] headlamps are enhanced for the 2017 E-class.

In fact, on the profile of the facelifted W212, it still retains the edgy lines that came out in 2009.<ref name=\"W213vsW212\"/> At the back, the W213 adopted a fresh design for the lights similar to the S-Class.

After their 1980 tour in support of their previous album, ''[[Duke (album)|Duke]]'' (1980), the band took a break before they reconvened in 1981 to write and record a new album. ''Abacab'' is the first Genesis album recorded at [[The Farm (recording studio)|The Farm]], a recording studio bought by the group in [[Chiddingfold]], [[Surrey]]. It marked the band's development from their progressive roots into more accessible and pop-oriented songs, and their conscious decision to write songs unlike their previous albums.\n\n''Abacab'' received a mostly positive reception from critics and was a commercial success for the band, reaching No. 1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and No. 7 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Genesis released four singles from the album, the most successful being \"[[Abacab (song)|Abacab]]\" and \"[[No Reply at All]]\". The album continued to sell, and was certified double [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] in 1988 by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for two million copies sold in the US. The [[Abacab Tour]] visited North America and Europe in 1981, recordings from which formed most of their 1982 live album and concert video ''[[Three Sides Live]]''. Three tracks left off the album were released as an [[extended play]], ''[[3\u00d73]]''. The album was reissued with a new stereo and [[5.1 surround sound]] in 2007.\n\n==Background==\nIn June 1980, the Genesis line-up of drummer and singer [[Phil Collins]], keyboardist [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]], and guitarist [[Mike Rutherford]], with touring drummer [[Chester Thompson]] and guitarist and bassist [[Daryl Stuermer]], wrapped their [[Duke Tour|1980 tour]] of the United Kingdom and North America in support of their tenth album, ''[[Duke (album)|Duke]]'' (1980). Following a period of rest, in November 1980 the band bought [[The Farm (recording studio)|Fisher Lane Farm]], a farmhouse with an adjoining cowshed near [[Chiddingfold]], [[Surrey]], as their new private rehearsal and recording facility. In the process of remodelling the building into a studio, the trio reconvened there in March 1981 to write and rehearse new material which initially took place in the living room.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=238}}{{sfn|Welch|2011|p=100}} ''Abacab'' marks the first Genesis album that was recorded in England since ''[[A Trick of the Tail]]'' (1976). The success of Collins's debut solo album ''[[Face Value (album)|Face Value]]'' (1981) had gained momentum by the recording stage; Banks claimed it did little to alter the sound or style of ''Abacab'' or the relationship towards him or Rutherford as they had been friends for a long time.{{sfn|Welch|2011|p=100}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:The Farm recording studio 2006.jpg|thumb|[[The Farm (recording studio)|The Farm]] studio, pictured in 2006.

Though the band did not alter the way in which they approached the songwriting for ''Abacab'',<ref name=sounds1981>{{cite magazine|url=http://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/hugh-fielder-interviews-genesis-sounds-26th-september/|title=The Great Escape|date=26 September 1981|first=Hugh|last=Fielder|magazine=Sounds|pages=18\u201320|accessdate=23 December 2017}}</ref> Banks said a conscious effort was made by the group to avoid \"Genesis cliches\" such as using tambourines during a chorus, reprises, extended solos, lengthy instrumental passages,{{sfn|Welch|2011|p=101}} and keeping melodies simple, which signalled further changes in their direction.{{sfn|Bowler|Dray|1992|p=170}}{{sfn|Reissues Interview 2007}} He claimed that ''Abacab'' was the least technical Genesis album up to this point.<ref name=HR81/> Rutherford pointed out that the omission of familiar sounding tracks was done in order to avoid Genesis becoming a caricature of itself so a change in direction was therefore necessary.<ref name=\"Mike on Mike\">Neer, Dan (1985).

Three of the designs had a limited print, after which just one of the designs remained in stock.<ref name=HR81/> In a contrast to previous Genesis albums, the sleeve is absent of lyrics. Banks reasoned this to reducing the emphasis on the words which he thought had been overdone on previous albums, in order to make them a greater part in the album's overall sound.<ref name=sounds1981/>\n\n==Songs==\n''Abacab'' is formed of nine tracks, six of which are group written with the remaining three solely credited to one of each member: \"Me and Sarah Jane\" is from Banks, \"[[Man on the Corner]]\" by Collins, and \"Like It or Not\" by Rutherford.<ref name=sleeve>{{cite AV media notes|title=Abacab|publisher=Charisma Records|id=CBR 102|year=1981}}</ref><ref name=sounds1981/> Banks said the album consisted of mostly collectively written songs as such material became the strongest on ''Duke''.{{sfn|Welch|2011|p=100}}\n\n===Side one===\nRutherford spoke about how the \"[[Abacab (song)|Abacab]]\" was arranged: \"There were three bits of music in 'Abacab', and we referred to them as 'section a', 'section b', and 'section c' ... and at different times, they were in different order.

Collins thought the horns was a good move to \"suddenly jar people and take them off automatic pilot\" from the predictable ideas they had considered Genesis to be.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/international-musician-and-recording-world-march-1982/|title=Genesis: A Revelation|magazine=International Musician and Recording World|date=March 1982|pages=23, 25, 27, 29|accessdate=2 September 2018}}</ref> Their involvement created some initial reservations from Banks, but he grew to enjoy the track by the time it was complete.<ref name=sounds1981/> In rehearsal, Banks played a drum machine while Rutherford and Collins played a guitar and drum part, respectively, and played until they found ideas and sequences that worked.

Colbert, however, thought Genesis had produced \"a couple of Frankensteins\" such as the latter half of \"Abacab\" which he deemed \"unstructured\" and \"uninspired\" compared to their past instrumentals. He named \"Keep It Dark\" and \"Who Dunnit?\" as \"the most exciting and innovative music\" the band had produced for several years, and concluded with the album is \"by far more promising\" than ''Duke'' or ''...And Then There Were Three...''.<ref name=melodymaker1981>{{cite journal|url=http://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/melody-maker-paul-colbert-review/|title=New values|first=Paul|last=Colbert|date=1981|magazine=Melody Maker|accessdate=2 December 2016}}</ref> Ken Kubernik of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wondered if the success of Collins' solo album ''Face Value'' was an influence on the group, to which he replied, \"Yes and no.\" He praised the album for its \"thick, resonant instrumental passages, quaint imagery in the lyrics, and superb production\", but \"beneath the surface are some new wrinkles in the trademark Genesis sound\", noting a reduction in harmonies for more simple vocals and Collins' drum sound replacing Banks's keyboards as their \"vortex\".

After their 1980 tour in support of their previous album, ''[[Duke (album)|Duke]]'' (1980), the band took a break before they reconvened in 1981 to write and record a new album. ''Abacab'' is the first Genesis album recorded at [[The Farm (recording studio)|The Farm]], a recording studio bought by the group in [[Chiddingfold]], [[Surrey]]. It marked the band's development from their progressive roots into more accessible and pop-oriented songs, and their conscious decision to write songs unlike their previous albums.\n\n''Abacab'' received a mostly positive reception from critics and was a commercial success for the band, reaching No. 1 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and No. 7 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Genesis released four singles from the album, the most successful being \"[[Abacab (song)|Abacab]]\" and \"[[No Reply at All]]\". The album continued to sell, and was certified double [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] in 1988 by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for two million copies sold in the US. The [[Abacab Tour]] visited North America and Europe in 1981, recordings from which formed most of their 1982 live album and concert video ''[[Three Sides Live]]''. Three tracks left off the album were released as an [[extended play]], ''[[3\u00d73]]''. The album was reissued with a new stereo and [[5.1 surround sound]] in 2007.\n\n==Background==\nIn June 1980, the Genesis line-up of drummer and singer [[Phil Collins]], keyboardist [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]], and guitarist [[Mike Rutherford]], with touring drummer [[Chester Thompson]] and guitarist and bassist [[Daryl Stuermer]], wrapped their [[Duke Tour|1980 tour]] of the United Kingdom and North America in support of their tenth album, ''[[Duke (album)|Duke]]'' (1980). Following a period of rest, in November 1980 the band bought [[The Farm (recording studio)|Fisher Lane Farm]], a farmhouse with an adjoining cowshed near [[Chiddingfold]], [[Surrey]], as their new private rehearsal and recording facility. In the process of remodelling the building into a studio, the trio reconvened there in March 1981 to write and rehearse new material which initially took place in the living room.{{sfn|Genesis|2007|p=238}}{{sfn|Welch|2011|p=100}} ''Abacab'' marks the first Genesis album that was recorded in England since ''[[A Trick of the Tail]]'' (1976). The success of Collins's debut solo album ''[[Face Value (album)|Face Value]]'' (1981) had gained momentum by the recording stage; Banks claimed it did little to alter the sound or style of ''Abacab'' or the relationship towards him or Rutherford as they had been friends for a long time.{{sfn|Welch|2011|p=100}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:The Farm recording studio 2006.jpg|thumb|[[The Farm (recording studio)|The Farm]] studio, pictured in 2006.

Three of the designs had a limited print, after which just one of the designs remained in stock.<ref name=HR81/> In a contrast to previous Genesis albums, the sleeve is absent of lyrics. Banks reasoned this to reducing the emphasis on the words which he thought had been overdone on previous albums, in order to make them a greater part in the album's overall sound.<ref name=sounds1981/>\n\n==Songs==\n''Abacab'' is formed of nine tracks, six of which are group written with the remaining three solely credited to one of each member: \"Me and Sarah Jane\" is from Banks, \"[[Man on the Corner]]\" by Collins, and \"Like It or Not\" by Rutherford.<ref name=sleeve>{{cite AV media notes|title=Abacab|publisher=Charisma Records|id=CBR 102|year=1981}}</ref><ref name=sounds1981/> Banks said the album consisted of mostly collectively written songs as such material became the strongest on ''Duke''.{{sfn|Welch|2011|p=100}}\n\n===Side one===\nRutherford spoke about how the \"[[Abacab (song)|Abacab]]\" was arranged: \"There were three bits of music in 'Abacab', and we referred to them as 'section a', 'section b', and 'section c' ... and at different times, they were in different order.

Collins thought the horns was a good move to \"suddenly jar people and take them off automatic pilot\" from the predictable ideas they had considered Genesis to be.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/international-musician-and-recording-world-march-1982/|title=Genesis: A Revelation|magazine=International Musician and Recording World|date=March 1982|pages=23, 25, 27, 29|accessdate=2 September 2018}}</ref> Their involvement created some initial reservations from Banks, but he grew to enjoy the track by the time it was complete.<ref name=sounds1981/> In rehearsal, Banks played a drum machine while Rutherford and Collins played a guitar and drum part, respectively, and played until they found ideas and sequences that worked.

He recognised a \"heavy PC [Phil Collins] twist to the sound\" on \"Man on the Corner\" and \"No Reply At All\", but \"he does not have it all his own way\". Colbert, however, thought Genesis had produced \"a couple of Frankensteins\" such as the latter half of \"Abacab\" which he deemed \"unstructured\" and \"uninspired\" compared to their past instrumentals. He named \"Keep It Dark\" and \"Who Dunnit?\" as \"the most exciting and innovative music\" the band had produced for several years, and concluded with the album is \"by far more promising\" than ''Duke'' or ''...And Then There Were Three...''.<ref name=melodymaker1981>{{cite journal|url=http://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/melody-maker-paul-colbert-review/|title=New values|first=Paul|last=Colbert|date=1981|magazine=Melody Maker|accessdate=2 December 2016}}</ref> Ken Kubernik of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wondered if the success of Collins' solo album ''Face Value'' was an influence on the group, to which he replied, \"Yes and no.\" He praised the album for its \"thick, resonant instrumental passages, quaint imagery in the lyrics, and superb production\", but \"beneath the surface are some new wrinkles in the trademark Genesis sound\", noting a reduction in harmonies for more simple vocals and Collins' drum sound replacing Banks's keyboards as their \"vortex\". Kubernik did, however, praise Collins' vocals.<ref name=latimes1981>{{cite journal|url=http://thegenesisarchive.co.uk/la-times-abacab-review-18th-october/|title=Genesis turns loss into gain|first=Ken|last=Kubernik|date=18 October 1981|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2 December 2016}}</ref> Jim Bohen for ''[[Daily Record (Morristown)|Daily Record]]'' recognised ''Abacab'' had largely taken its direction from Collins's ''Face Value'' with its structure based around a \"a huge, booming drum sound\". He noted the instrumentation is less restrained than previous Genesis albums. \"Who Dunnit?\" was described as \"an [[Ian Dury]] like tongue-twister\", yet deemed \"Dodo/Lurker\", \"Like It or Not\", and \"Another Record\" as \"less noteworthy\".
