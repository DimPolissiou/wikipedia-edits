After the assassination of Bakhtiar Khalji by his own officer Ali Mardan in 1206 C.

The Delhi Sultans attempted to govern Bengal through appointed governors, however Delhi could not succeed given the considerable overland distance with Bengal. Ambitious governors rebelled and ruled as independent rulers until being suppressed militarily by the Delhi Sultanate. However, there were capable rulers among the rebels, including Yuzbak Shah (1257), Tughral Khan (1271-1282), and [[Shamsuddin Firoz Shah]] (1301-1322). The latter achieved the [[Conquest of Sylhet]] and established a strong administration in eastern and south-western Bengal. In 1325, the Delhi Sultan [[Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq]] reorganized the province into three administrative regions, with [[Sonargaon]] ruling eastern Bengal; [[Gauda (city)|Gauda]] ruling northern Bengal; and [[Satgaon]] ruling southern Bengal. Even this arrangement broke down. By 1338, the three administrative regions had separatist [[Sultan]]s, including [[Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah]] in Sonargaon; [[Alauddin Ali Shah]] in Gauda, and [[Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah]] in Satgaon.<ref name=\"Kunal Chakrabarti 2013 p. 12\">Kunal Chakrabarti; Shubhra Chakrabarti (22 August 2013).

During his reign, Bengali territory extended from [[Koch Bihar]] in the north to [[Puri]] in the south and from the [[Son River]] in the west to the [[Brahmaputra River]] in the east. The Mughals became determined to bring an end to Bengali imperialism. The [[Battle of Tukaroi]] in Orissa saw Mughal forces led by [[Akbar]] overwhelm Bengali forces led by the last Sultan [[Daud Khan Karrani]], resulting in the Treaty of [[Cuttack]]. Mughal rule formally began with the [[Battle of Raj Mahal]] when the last reigning Sultan of Bengal was defeated by the forces of Akbar. The Mughal province of [[Bengal Subah]] was created. The eastern deltaic [[Bhati (region)|Bhati]] region remained outside of Mughal control until being absorbed in the early 17th-century. The delta was controlled by a confederation of twelve aristocrats of the former sultanate, who became known as the Twelve Bhuiyans. Their leader was [[Isa Khan]], a former nobleman of the sultanate. The confederation was made up of [[petty kingdoms]]. The Mughal government eventually suppressed the remnants of the sultanate in the Bhati area and brought all of Bengal under full Mughal control.\n\n==Administration and military==\n[[File:Inside Kusumba Mosque (02).jpg|thumb|The ''Badshah-e-Takht'' (Sultan's throne) in [[Kusumba Mosque]].

The following illustrates the most notable vassal states.\n\n====Arakan====\n[[File:Muhghazi.jpg|thumb|Coinage from Arakan during its vassalage to the Bengal Sultanate]]\nIn the southeast, [[Arakan]] was a prominent vassal of the Bengal Sultanate. In 1430, the Bengal Sultanate restored the Arakanese throne in [[Mrauk U]] after driving out Burmese invaders who came from [[Bagan]].

Due to the riverine geography and climate, it was not feasible to use cavalry throughout the year in Bengal. The cavalry was probably the weakest component of the Bengal Sultanate's army, as the horses had to be imported from foreign countries. The artillery was an important section. Portuguese historian [[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]] opined that the military supremacy of Bengal over Arakan and Tripura was due to its efficient artillery. The artillery used cannons and guns of various sizes.<ref name=\"banglapedia2\">{{cite web |url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Military |title=Military |website=Banglapedia |accessdate=2017-09-22 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923051005/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Military |archivedate=23 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The ''paiks'' formed the vital part of the Bengal infantry during this period. There were occasions when the paiks also tackled political situations.

Apart from carrying war materials, elephants were also used for the movement of the armed personnel. In riverine Bengal the usefulness of elephants, though very slow, could not be minimised. The navy was of prime necessity in riverine Bengal. In fact, the cavalry could ensure the hold over this country for a period of six months whereas the boats backed by the paiks could command supremacy over the other half of the year. Since the time of Iwaz Khalji, who first organised a naval force in Islamic Bengal, the war boats played an important role in the political affairs of the country. The chief of the admiralty had various responsibilities, including [[Shipbuilding in Bangladesh|shipbuilding]], river transport, to fit out strong boats for transporting war elephants; to recruit seamen; to patrol the rivers and to collect tolls at ghats. The efficiency of the navy eroded during the Hussain Shahi dynasty. The Sultans also built forts, including temporary mud walled forts.<ref name=\"banglapedia2\"/>\n[[File:Defeat of the last Bengal Sultan by Akbar.jpg|thumb|Akbar leads his army into battle against Daud Khan Karrani, the last Sultan of Bengal]]\n====Bengal-Delhi Wars====\n{{Main|Bengal Sultanate-Delhi Sultanate War}}\nIn 1353, the Sultan of Delhi attacked the newly formed Bengal Sultanate. After the siege of Ekdala Fort, Bengal agreed to pay a tribute to the Sultan of Delhi. In 1359, Delhi again invaded Bengal after the previous peace treaty collapsed. However, negotiations ultimately resulted in a new treaty in which Delhi recognized the independence of Bengal.<ref>Kunal Chakrabarti; Shubhra Chakrabarti (22 August 2013).

During the Hussain Shahi dynasty, Bengali control over Assam reached its zenith. Alauddin Hussain Shah overthrew the Hindu [[Khen dynasty]] during a war against the Kamata Kingdom. Eventually, the [[Ahom kingdom]] re-asserted Assamese independence.\n\n====Campaigns in Arakan====\n{{Main|Reconquest of Arakan|Bengal Sultanate-Kingdom of Mrauk U War of 1512-1516}}\nThe Bengal Sultanate defeated Burmese forces in Arakan and restored the Arakanese throne in 1430. Later, Bengal and Arakan fought several wars for control of Chittagong. Arakan asserted its independence as a coastal power. During the Hussain Shahi dynasty, Bengali sovereignty was restored in Chittagong and northern Arakan. However, the Arakanese allied with Portuguese pirates to reduce Bengali control over Chittagong.  \n\n====Sher Shah Suri's invasion====\n{{See also|Suri Empire}}\nBengal was overwhelmed during the pan-Indian invasion of [[Sher Shah Suri]] and became part of the Suri Empire. The invasion prompted the Mughal Empire to occupy parts of Bengal. Both the Mughals and Bengal Sultanate were overrun by the Suri forces. Bengal regained its independence after Suri governors rebelled and re-established the sultanate.  \n\n====Bengal-Mughal Wars====\n{{Main|Battle of Ghaghra|Battle of Tukaroi|Battle of Raj Mahal}}\nThe first Mughal emperor Babur turned his sights on Bengal after the Battle of Panipat in 1526. At the Battle of Ghaghra in 1529, Bengal reached a peace treaty with Babur. During the invasion of Sher Shah Suri, the second Mughal emperor Humayun occupied [[Gauda (city)|Gaur]]. The third Mughal emperor Akbar  launched a war against Bengal at the Battle of Tukaroi in 1575.

[[Ma Huan]]'s testimony of a flourishing shipbuilding industry was part of the evidence that Bengal enjoyed significant seaborne trade. The expansion of [[muslin]] production, [[sericulture]] and the emergence of several other crafts were indicated in Ma Huan's list of items exported from Bengal to China. Bengali shipping co-existed with Chinese shipping until the latter withdrew from the Indian Ocean in the mid-15th-century.

The shipbuilding tradition is evidenced in the sultanate's naval campaigns in the Ganges delta. The trade between Bengal and the Maldives, based on rice and cowry shells, was probably done on Arab-style [[baghlah]] ships. Chinese accounts point to Bengali ships being prominent in Southeast Asian waters. A vessel from Bengal, probably owned by the Sultan of Bengal, could accommodate three tribute missions- from Bengal, [[Brunei]] and Sumatra- and was evidently the only vessel capable of such a task.

Vegetables included ginger, mustard, onions, and garlic among others. There were four types of wines, including coconut, rice, ''tarry'' and ''kajang''. Bengali streets were well provided with eating establishments, drinking houses and bathhouses. At least six varieties of fine muslin cloth existed. Silk fabrics were also abundant.

The Delhi Sultans attempted to govern Bengal through appointed governors, however Delhi could not succeed given the considerable overland distance with Bengal. Ambitious governors rebelled and ruled as independent rulers until being suppressed militarily by the Delhi Sultanate. However, there were capable rulers among the rebels, including Yuzbak Shah (1257), Tughral Khan (1271-1282), and [[Shamsuddin Firoz Shah]] (1301-1322). The latter achieved the [[Conquest of Sylhet]] and established a strong administration in eastern and south-western Bengal. In 1325, the Delhi Sultan [[Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq]] reorganized the province into three administrative regions, with [[Sonargaon]] ruling eastern Bengal; [[Gauda (city)|Gauda]] ruling northern Bengal; and [[Satgaon]] ruling southern Bengal. Even this arrangement broke down. By 1338, the three administrative regions had separatist [[Sultan]]s, including [[Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah]] in Sonargaon; [[Alauddin Ali Shah]] in Gauda, and [[Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah]] in Satgaon.<ref name=\"Kunal Chakrabarti 2013 p. 12\">Kunal Chakrabarti; Shubhra Chakrabarti (22 August 2013).

Apart from carrying war materials, elephants were also used for the movement of the armed personnel. In riverine Bengal the usefulness of elephants, though very slow, could not be minimised. The navy was of prime necessity in riverine Bengal. In fact, the cavalry could ensure the hold over this country for a period of six months whereas the boats backed by the paiks could command supremacy over the other half of the year. Since the time of Iwaz Khalji, who first organised a naval force in Islamic Bengal, the war boats played an important role in the political affairs of the country. The chief of the admiralty had various responsibilities, including [[Shipbuilding in Bangladesh|shipbuilding]], river transport, to fit out strong boats for transporting war elephants; to recruit seamen; to patrol the rivers and to collect tolls at ghats. The efficiency of the navy eroded during the Hussain Shahi dynasty.

During the Hussain Shahi dynasty, Bengali control over Assam reached its zenith. Alauddin Hussain Shah overthrew the Hindu [[Khen dynasty]] during a war against the Kamata Kingdom. Eventually, the [[Ahom kingdom]] re-asserted Assamese independence.\n\n====Campaigns in Arakan====\n{{Main|Reconquest of Arakan|Bengal Sultanate-Kingdom of Mrauk U War of 1512-1516}}\nThe Bengal Sultanate defeated Burmese forces in Arakan and restored the Arakanese throne in 1430. Later, Bengal and Arakan fought several wars for control of Chittagong. Arakan asserted its independence as a coastal power. During the Hussain Shahi dynasty, Bengali sovereignty was restored in Chittagong and northern Arakan. However, the Arakanese allied with Portuguese pirates to reduce Bengali control over Chittagong.  \n\n====Sher Shah Suri's invasion====\n{{See also|Suri Empire}}\nBengal was overwhelmed during the pan-Indian invasion of [[Sher Shah Suri]] and became part of the Suri Empire. The invasion prompted the Mughal Empire to occupy parts of Bengal. Both the Mughals and Bengal Sultanate were overrun by the Suri forces. Bengal regained its independence after Suri governors rebelled and re-established the sultanate.  \n\n====Bengal-Mughal Wars====\n{{Main|Battle of Ghaghra|Battle of Tukaroi|Battle of Raj Mahal}}\nThe first Mughal emperor Babur turned his sights on Bengal after the Battle of Panipat in 1526. At the Battle of Ghaghra in 1529, Bengal reached a peace treaty with Babur. During the invasion of Sher Shah Suri, the second Mughal emperor Humayun occupied [[Gauda (city)|Gaur]]. The third Mughal emperor Akbar  launched a war against Bengal at the Battle of Tukaroi in 1575. Akbar finally defeated the last Sultan of Bengal at the Battle of Raj Mahal in 1576.\n\n==Economy==\n{{See also|Muslin trade in Bengal|History of the taka}}\n[[File:Maritime links of the Sultanate of Bengal.png|thumb|Maritime links of the Bengal sultanate]]\n[[File:Sd2-baggala.JPG|thumb|The baghlah was a type of ship widely used by traders in the Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, the Malacca Straits and the South China Sea]]\nThe economy of the Bengal Sultanate inherited earlier aspects of the Delhi Sultanate, including mint towns, a salaried bureaucracy and the [[jagirdar]] system of land ownership.

There were three sources of silver. The first source was the leftover silver reserve of previous kingdoms. The second source was the tribute payments of subordinate kingdoms which were paid in silver bullion. The third source was during military campaigns when Bengali forces sacked neighboring states.<ref>John H Munro (6 October 2015).

[[Ma Huan]]'s testimony of a flourishing shipbuilding industry was part of the evidence that Bengal enjoyed significant seaborne trade. The expansion of [[muslin]] production, [[sericulture]] and the emergence of several other crafts were indicated in Ma Huan's list of items exported from Bengal to China. Bengali shipping co-existed with Chinese shipping until the latter withdrew from the Indian Ocean in the mid-15th-century. The testimony of European travelers such as [[Ludovico di Varthema]], [[Duarte Barbosa]] and [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] attest to the presence of a large number of wealthy Bengali merchants and shipowners in [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]].<ref name=\"Habib2011\">{{cite book |author=Irfan Habib |title=Economic History of Medieval India, 1200-1500 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K8kO4J3mXUAC&pg=PA185 |year=2011 |publisher=Pearson Education India |isbn=978-81-317-2791-1 |page=185 |author-link=Irfan Habib}}</ref> Historian Rila Mukherjee wrote that ports in Bengal may have been [[entrepot]]s, importing goods and re-exporting them to China.<ref name=\"Mukherjee2011\">{{cite book |author=Rila Mukherjee |year=2011 |title=Pelagic Passageways: The Northern Bay of Bengal Before Colonialism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7xeqhnYtrKcC&pg=PA30 |publisher=Primus Books |page=30 |isbn=978-93-80607-20-7 |quote=\"some of them [items exported from Bengal to China] were probably re-exports.

The shipbuilding tradition is evidenced in the sultanate's naval campaigns in the Ganges delta. The trade between Bengal and the Maldives, based on rice and cowry shells, was probably done on Arab-style [[baghlah]] ships. Chinese accounts point to Bengali ships being prominent in Southeast Asian waters. A vessel from Bengal, probably owned by the Sultan of Bengal, could accommodate three tribute missions- from Bengal, [[Brunei]] and Sumatra- and was evidently the only vessel capable of such a task.

Smaller purchases involved [[shell currency]]. One silver coin was worth 10,250 cowry shells. Bengal relied on shiploads of cowry shell imports from the Maldives. Due to the fertile land, there was an abundance of agricultural commodities, including bananas, jackfruits, pomegranate, sugarcane, and honey. Native crops included rice and sesame. Vegetables included ginger, mustard, onions, and garlic among others. There were four types of wines, including coconut, rice, ''tarry'' and ''kajang''. Bengali streets were well provided with eating establishments, drinking houses and bathhouses. At least six varieties of fine muslin cloth existed. Silk fabrics were also abundant.

Records show that the Bengal Sultanate exchanged embassies with states in China, Europe, Africa, Central Asia, South Asia and Southeast Asia. Diplomatic allies helped Bengal to fend off invasions from neighbouring kingdoms. For example, the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] ruler of [[Herat]] and the [[Ming]] emperor of [[China]] helped bring an end to the [[Bengal Sultanate-Jaunpur Sultanate War]]. Bengal was also active in regional diplomacy. For example, the ship of the Bengali embassy to China also transported the envoys of [[Bruneian Empire|Brunei]] and [[Aceh Sultanate|Aceh]] ([[Sumatra]]) to China.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Bengal gave consent to envoys from [[Portuguese India]] for setting up Portuguese trading posts in coastal areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Portuguese,_The|title=Portuguese, The |website=Banglapedia|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401131309/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Portuguese,_The|archivedate=1 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Other European visitors included [[Niccolo De Conti]], [[Ludovico di Varthema]] and Caeser Fredrick from the [[Republic of Venice]] and [[Bologna]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Conti,_Nicolo_de|title=Conti, Nicolo de |website=Banglapedia|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304211223/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Conti,_Nicolo_de|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Frederick,_Caeser|title=Frederick, Caeser |website=Banglapedia|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406101718/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Frederick,_Caeser|archivedate=6 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the Islamic world, the sultanate pledged allegiance to the contemporary [[Abbasid Caliphate]], which was at the time held by the [[Mamluk Egypt|Mamluk Sultan]] of [[Cairo]]. The Abbasid caliph was still considered to be the symbolic leader of Sunni Islam at the time, despite dwindling territory under direct caliphate rule. For the Bengali Sultans, relations with the caliphate provided legitimacy among the Muslim clergy. For example, the [[religious conversion|converted Sultan]] [[Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah]] received recognition from [[Al-Mu'tadid II]], which strengthened Jalaluddin's legitimacy in the eyes of the clergy.<ref name=\"banglapedia.org1\"/> Many coins minted by the Bengal Sultanate bore the names of both the Bengali Sultans and the Abbasid Caliphs.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Coins|chapter=Coins| title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh|author=Muhammad Rezaul Karim|publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref>\n[[File:Tribute Giraffe with Attendant.jpg|thumb|200px|Chinese manuscript ''Tribute Giraffe with Attendant'', depicting a giraffe presented by Bengali envoys to the Ming court (Philadelphia Museum of Art)]]\nSultan [[Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah]] sponsored the construction of [[madrasa]]s (Islamic theological schools) in the pilgrimage cities of [[Makkah]] and [[Madinah]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard M.

A war with Arakan in 1459 led to the defeat of Bengali Sultan [[Rukunuddin Barbak Shah]]. The Arakanese developed an alliance with [[Portuguese Chittagong]] against Bengal.

When the Sultan invited Hafez to complete an incomplete [[ghazal]] by the ruler, the renowned poet responded by acknowledging the grandeur of the king's court and the literary quality of Bengali-Persian poetry.<ref>{{cite Banglapedia|article=Persian|author=Abu Musa Mohammad Arif Billah}}</ref>\n\nManuscript paintings depict the fashion and architecture of the Bengal Sultanate. Persian manuscripts with paintings are a key artistic hallmark of the Bengal Sultanate. One of the best-known examples of this heritage is the ''Sharafnama'' published by Sultan [[Nasiruddin Nasrat Shah|Nusrat Shah]] in the middle of the 16th-century. It includes epic poetry by [[Nizami Ganjavi]] about the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]].<ref name=\"Grabar1989\">{{cite book|author=Oleg Grabar|title=Muqarnas: An Annual on Islamic Art and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O0NCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA58|year=1989|publisher=Brill Archive|isbn=978-90-04-09050-7|pages=58\u201372|author-link=Oleg Grabar}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/eskandar-nama|title=ESKANDAR-N\u0100MA \u2013 Encyclopaedia Iranica|website=www.iranicaonline.org|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref>\n\nIn the 15th century, the Sufi poet Nur Qutb Alam pioneered [[Bengali Muslim]] poetry by establishing the [[Dobhashi]] tradition, which saw poems written half in Persian and half in colloquial Bengali. The invocation tradition saw Islamic figures replacing the invocation of Hindu gods and goddesses in Bengali texts. The literary romantic tradition saw poems by [[Shah Muhammad Sagir]] on [[Yusuf and Zulaikha]], as well as works of Bahram Khan and Sabirid Khan. The ''[[Dobhashi]]'' culture featured the use of [[Arabic]] and Persian words in Bengali texts to illustrate Muslim stories. [[Epic poetry]] included ''Nabibangsha'' by [[Syed Sultan]], ''Janganama'' by [[Abdul Hakim (poet)|Abdul Hakim]] and ''Rasul Bijay'' by Shah Barid. Sufi literature flourished with a dominant theme of [[cosmology]]. Bengali Muslim writers produced translations of numerous Arabic and Persian works, including the [[Thousand and One Nights]] and the [[Shahnameh]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blogs.edgehill.ac.uk/sacs/files/2012/07/Document-6-Billah-A.-M.-M.-A-The-Development-of-Bengali-Literature-during-Muslim-Rule.pdf |title=The development of Bengali literature during Muslim rule |accessdate=2017-09-22 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809050525/https://blogs.edgehill.ac.uk/sacs/files/2012/07/Document-6-Billah-A.-M.-M.-A-The-Development-of-Bengali-Literature-during-Muslim-Rule.pdf |archivedate=9 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Sufi_Literature|title=Sufi Literature |website=Banglapedia |url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911195841/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Sufi_Literature|archivedate=11 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Architecture===\n{{See also|Bengali architecture|Islamic architecture}}\n====Urban architecture====\nCities in the Bengal Sultanate had stately medieval architecture, particularly in the royal capitals of [[Gauda (city)|Gaur]] and [[Pandua, Malda|Pandua]].

The large number of mosques built during the Bengal Sultanate indicates the rapidity with which the local population converted to Islam. The period between 1450 and 1550 was an intensive mosque building era. These mosques dotted the countryside, ranged from small to medium sizes and were used for daily devotion. [[Ponds]] were often located beside a mosque. Arabic inscriptions in the mosques often include the name of the patron or builder. The most commonly cited verse from the Quran in inscriptions was Surah 72 ([[Al-Jinn]]).<ref name=\"Grabar1989\">{{cite book|author=Oleg Grabar|title=Muqarnas: An Annual on Islamic Art and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O0NCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA58|year=1989|publisher=Brill Archive|isbn=978-90-04-09050-7|pages=58\u201372|author-link=Oleg Grabar}}</ref> The buildings were made of brick or stone.

They were often the gift of a wealthy patron and the fruit of extraordinary effort, which would not be found in every Muslim neighborhood.<ref name=\"Grabar1989\"/> Mosques were built across the length and breadth of the Bengal Sultanate. The highest concentration of mosques from the Bengal Sultanate can be found in the [[North Bengal]] regions of Bangladesh and Indian West Bengal. A [[Mosque City of Bagerhat|mosque city]] developed near the southwestern Bengali Sundarbans forest as a result of the patronization of Governor Khan Jahan Ali. In 1985, UNESCO designated the city as a [[World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/321/|title=Historic Mosque City of Bagerhat|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|language=en|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref> In central areas, the [[Pathrail Mosque]] in [[Faridpur District|Faridpur]] is one of the best-preserved sultanate-era structures.

In the northeastern Indian state of [[Assam]], the [[Panbari Mosque]] was built during the reign of Sultan Alauddin Hussain Shah. Other mosques can be found in southern West Bengal and the Indian state of [[Bihar]], such as the [[Sayed Jamaluddin Mosque]]. In the southeast, the Santikan Mosque (built in the 1430s) stands in ruins in Rakhine State (formerly [[Arakan]]) of [[Myanmar]] (formerly Burma).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/06/150625-myanmar-burma-rohingya-refugees-archaeology-world/|title=Lost Myanmar Empire Is Stage for Modern Violence|date=2015-06-26|website=National Geographic News|language=en|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref> \n\nImperial mosques had an in-built throne for the Sultan.

For example, the tomb of Sultan Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah in Sonargaon has features similar to the architecture of Adina Mosque built by his father Sultan Sikandar Shah. An indigenous Islamic mausolea style developed with the [[Eklakhi Mausoleum]], which is the royal tomb chamber of Sultan Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah.

In the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] miraculously made copious amounts of wine<ref>Six pots of thirty-nine [[litre]]s each = 234 liters = 61.8 [[gallon]]s, according to Seesemann, p. 163.</ref> at the [[marriage at Cana]] ([[John 2]]). Wine is the most alcoholic beverage mentioned in biblical literature, where it is a source of symbolism,<ref name=\"ISBEWine\" /> and was an important part of daily life in biblical times.<ref name=\"ISBEWine\">B. S. Easton (1915b).</ref><ref name=\"Broshi 1984, p. 33\">Broshi (1984), p. 33.</ref><ref>Broshi (1986), p. 46: \"In the biblical description of the agricultural products of the Land, the triad 'cereal, wine, and oil' recurs repeatedly ({{bibleverse|Deuteronomy|28:51|9|Deut. 28:51}} and elsewhere). These were the main products of ancient Palestine, in order of importance. The fruit of the vine was consumed both fresh and dried (raisins), but it was primarily consumed as wine. Wine was, in antiquity, an important food and not just an embellishment to a feast.... Wine was essentially a man's drink in antiquity, when it became a significant dietary component. Even slaves were given a generous wine ration. Scholars estimate that in ancient Rome an adult consumed a liter of wine daily. Even a minimal estimate of 700g. per day means that wine constituted about one quarter of the caloric intake (600 out of 2,500 cal.) and about one third of the minimum required intake of iron.\"</ref> Additionally, the inhabitants of [[Eretz Yisrael|ancient Israel]] drank beer, and wines made from fruits other than grapes, and references to these appear in scripture.<ref name=\"WaltkeP505\">Waltke (2005), p. 505.</ref>\n\nThe word \"Alcohol\" is Arabic; from the root word (Al-Ghawl/Ghul) \"Ghawl\" or \"Ghul\" which translates to Ghoul, Hobgoblin, Bogey(man), Ogre (man eating giant), and Alcohol,.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=auto&tl=en&text=ghawl|title=Google Translate|website=translate.google.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=ar&tl=en&text=%D8%BA%D9%88%D9%84|title=Google Translate|website=translate.google.com}}</ref>  The Qur\u2019an\u2014verse 37:47 uses the Arabic form \"Al-Ghawl\" referring to the intoxication associated with alcohol when in wine.

Along with citing its destructive power on individuals and society, as it's often listed as the most dangerous drug in the world,<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/06/25/what-is-the-most-dangerous-drug|title=What is the most dangerous drug?|date=June 25, 2019|journal=The Economist}}</ref> they cite, among other verses, {{bibleverse|1 Corinthians|10:21|9}}, which states, \"You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot have a part in both the Lord\u2019s table and the table of demons.\"\n\nOthers think Biblical literature displays an ambivalence toward drinks that can be intoxicating, considering them both a blessing from God that brings joy and merriment and potentially dangerous beverages that can be [[sin]]fully [[Alcohol abuse|abused]].<ref name=\"WaltkeP127\">Waltke (2005), p. 127.</ref><ref>Fitzsimmonds, p. 1255: \"These two aspects of wine, its use and its abuse, its benefits and its curse, its acceptance in God's sight and its abhorrence, are interwoven into the fabric of the [Old Testament] so that it may gladden the heart of man (Ps. 104:15) or cause his mind to err (Is. 28:7), it can be associated with merriment (Ec. 10:19) or with anger (Is. 5:11), it can be used to uncover the shame of Noah (Gn. 9:21) or in the hands of Melchizedek to honor Abraham (Gn. 14:18).... The references [to drinks that can contain alcohol] in the [New Testament] are very much fewer in number, but once more the good and the bad aspects are equally apparent....\"</ref><ref name=\"RaymondP25\">Raymond, p. 25: \"This favorable view [of wine in the Bible], however, is balanced by an unfavorable estimate.... The reason for the presence of these two conflicting opinions on the nature of wine [is that the] consequences of wine drinking follow its use and not its nature. Happy results ensue when it is drunk in its proper measure and evil results when it is drunk to excess. The nature of wine is indifferent.\"</ref><ref>McClintock and Strong, p. 1016: \"But while liberty to use wine, as well as every other earthly blessing, is conceded and maintained in the Bible, yet all abuse of it is solemnly condemned.\"</ref> The relationships between Judaism and alcohol and Christianity and alcohol have generally maintained this same tension, though some modern Christian sects, particularly American Protestant groups around the time of [[Prohibition]], have rejected alcohol as evil. The original versions of the books of the Bible use several different words for alcoholic beverages: at least 10 in [[Hebrew]], and five in [[Greek language|Greek]]. Drunkenness is discouraged and not infrequently portrayed, and some biblical persons abstained from alcohol. Wine is used symbolically, in both positive and negative terms. Its consumption is prescribed for religious rites or medicinal uses in some places.\n\n==Lexigraphy==\nBiblical literature uses several words in its original languages to refer to different types of alcoholic beverages. Some of these words have overlapping meaning, particularly the words in the [[Hebrew language]] compared to the words in [[Koine Greek]], the language of both the [[Septuagint]] and the New Testament. While some deuterocanonical books may have been originally written in Hebrew or the [[Aramaic language]], some were written in Greek. Hence, the meanings of the words used for alcoholic beverages in each of these languages has bearing on alcohol in the Bible.\n\n=== Hebrew ===\nThe [[Hebrew Bible]] was largely written in [[Biblical Hebrew]], with portions in [[Biblical Aramaic]], and has an important [[Ancient Greek]] translation called the [[Septuagint]]. The modern Hebrew Bible, which generally follows the [[Masoretic Text]], uses several words to represent alcoholic beverages:\n{|border=1 class=\"wikitable\"\n!Hebrew !! Transliteration !!

Kings were forbidden to abuse alcohol lest their judgments be unjust. It was forbidden to [[priest]]s on duty, though the priests were given \"the finest new wine\" from the first fruits offerings for drinking outside the [[tabernacle]] and temple.\n\nThe [[Nazirite]]s excluded as part of their ascetic regimen not only wine, but also vinegar, grapes, and raisins, though when Nazirites completed the term of their vow they were required to present wine as part of their sacrificial offerings and could drink of it. While [[John the Baptist]] adopted such a regimen, Jesus did not during his three years of ministry.<ref name=\"RaymondP81\">Raymond p. 81: \"Not only did Jesus Christ Himself use and sanction the use of wine but also ... He saw nothing intrinsically evil in wine.(footnote citing [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt+15:11 Mt 15:11])\"</ref>\n\nThe [[Rechabite]]s, a sub-tribe of the [[Kenite]]s, vowed never to drink wine, live in houses, or plant fields or vineyards, not because of any \"threat to wise living\" from the latter [Prov. 20:1] practices, but because of their commitment to a nomadic lifestyle by not being bound to any particular piece of land.<ref name=\"WaltkeP127\" /> The Rechabites's strict obedience to the command of their father \"not to drink wine\" [Jer. 35:14] is commended and is contrasted with the failure of [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Kingdom of Judah]] to listen to their God.\n\nDuring the [[Babylonian captivity]], [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] and his fellow [[Jew]]s abstained from the meat and wine given to them by the king because they saw it as defiling in some way, though precisely how these would have defiled the Jews is not apparent in the text. A later passage implies that Daniel did drink wine at times, though it may not have been the king's. Similarly, Judith refused the [[Assyria]]n general's wine, though she drank wine from the stores she brought with her.\n\nChristians are instructed regarding abstinence and their duty toward immature Christians: \"All food is clean, but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble. It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother to fall.\"<ref>Raymond understands this to mean that \"if an individual by drinking wine either causes others to err through his example or abets a social evil which causes others to succumb to its temptations, then in the interests of Christian love he ought to forego the temporary pleasures of drinking in the interests of heavenly treasures\" (p. 87).</ref>\n\n=== Symbolism and metaphor ===\nThe commonness and centrality of wine in daily life in biblical times is apparent from its many positive and negative metaphorical uses throughout the Bible.<ref>Dommershausen, p. 64.</ref><ref>Raymond, p. 24: \"The numerous allusions to the vine and wine in the Old Testament furnish an admirable basis for the study of its estimation among the people at large.\"</ref> Positively, free wine is used as a symbol of [[divine grace]], and wine is repeatedly compared to intimate love in the [[Song of Solomon]]. Negatively, wine is [[personification|personified]] as a mocker (\"[t]he most hardened apostate\" in the Book of Proverbs whose chief sin is pride)<ref>Waltke (2004), p. 114.</ref> and beer a brawler (one who is \"mocking, noisy, and restless\").<ref name=\"WaltkeP127\" />\n\n[[File:Meeting of abraham and melchizadek.jpg|thumb|left|''Meeting of Abraham and Melchizedek'' by [[Dirk Bouts|Dieric Bouts the Elder]]]]\nAdditionally, the [[chosen people]] and [[kingdom of God]] are compared to a divinely owned vine or vineyard in several places, and the image of new wine being kept in new wineskins, a process that would burst old wineskins, represents that the new faith Jesus was bringing \"cannot be contained within the framework of the old.\"<ref>Browning, p. 395.</ref> The complacent are compared with \"wine left on its dregs\" too long, such that it lacks a good taste and is of no value, and those who are corrupt are compared with excellent wine which has been diluted with water.\n\nWine was also used as a symbol of blessing and judgement throughout the Bible. [[Melchizedek]] blessed and refreshed [[Abraham]]'s army with bread and wine; [[Isaac]] blessed [[Jacob]] by saying, \"May God give you of heaven's dew and of earth's richness \u2013 an abundance of grain and new wine\";<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+27%3A28&version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Genesis 27:28 \u2013 New International Version|website=Bible Gateway}}</ref> and when Jacob blessed his sons, he used a great abundance of wine as a symbol of [[Judah (biblical figure)|Judah]]'s prosperity. The nation of Israel was promised abundant wine and other central crops such as grain and oil<ref>M. S. Miller et al., p. 158f.</ref> if they kept God's [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]] commandments, and their wine would be taken away as a curse if the Israelites failed to keep the covenant.\n\nDrinking a cup of strong wine to the dregs and getting drunk are sometimes presented as a symbol of God's judgement and wrath,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+75:8;+Revelation+16:19;+17:2,6;+18:3&version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Psalm 75:8, Revelation 16:19, Revelation 17:2, Revelation 17:6, Revelation 18:3 \u2013 New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2016-11-06}}</ref> and Jesus alludes this cup of wrath, which he several times says he himself will drink. Similarly, the winepress is pictured as a tool of judgement where the resulting wine symbolizes the blood of the wicked who were crushed. Connected also to the cup of judgement is the wine of immorality, which the evil drink and which both brings and is part of the wrath of God.\n\n[[File:Parable of the Good Samaritan (detail) by Cornelis van Haarlem.jpg|thumb|Detail from ''The Good Samaritan'' by [[Cornelis van Haarlem]] showing the Samaritan pouring oil and wine on the injured man's wounds.]]\n\nThe [[Day of the Lord]], which is often understood by Christians to usher in the [[Messianic Age]], is depicted as a time when \"[n]ew wine will drip from the mountains and flow from all the hills,\"<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Am+9:13;Jl+3:18 Am 9:13; compare Jl 3:18]; [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=is+27:2;&version=49 Is 27:2 (NAS)]</ref> when God's people will \"plant vineyards and drink their wine,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Amos+9%3A14&version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Amos 9:14 \u2013 New International Version|website=Bible Gateway}}</ref> and when God himself \"will prepare a feast of rich food for all peoples, a banquet of aged wine \u2013 the best of meats and the finest of wines.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+25%3A6%2CMatthew+8%3A11%2CMatthew+22%3A2%2CLuke+13%3A29%2CLuke+14%3A15%2CLuke+22%3A28-30%2CRevelation+19%3A9&version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Isaiah 25:6, Matthew 8:11, Matthew 22:2, Luke 13:29, Luke 14:15, Luke 22:28\u201330, Revelation 19:9 \u2013 New International Version|website=Bible Gateway}}</ref>\n\nIn the New Testament, Jesus uses wine at the Last Supper to signify the \"New Covenant in [Jesus'] blood,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+26%3A26-29%2CMark+14%3A22-25%2CLuke+22%3A17-20%2C1+Corinthians+10%3A16%2C1+Corinthians+11%3A23-25&version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Matthew 26:26\u201329, Mark 14:22\u201325, Luke 22:17\u201320, 1 Corinthians 10:16, 1 Corinthians 11:23\u201325 \u2013 New International Version|website=Bible Gateway}}</ref> but Christians differ over precisely how symbolic the wine is in the continuing ritual of the Eucharist.<ref>Lincoln, p. 848.</ref>\n\n===Medicinal uses===\nWine was used in ancient times for various medicinal ends, and the Bible refers to some of these practices.

Advocates of this view, called the \"two-wine\" position, argue that the Greek and Hebrew words rendered \"wine\" in most English versions are generic terms for fruit juices; context determines if the beverage in view is alcoholic or not.  The fact is pointed out that even in earlier stages of the English language, such as in 1611 when the King James Version was translated, \"wine\" could refer to non-alcoholic beverages as well as alcoholic ones.<ref>For example, footnote #7 in the chapter [http://faithsaves.net/drunk-wine-wherein-excess-filled-spirit-ephesians-518/ ''And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit'' in ''The Doctrine of Sanctification'', Thomas Ross, Ph. D. dissertation, Great Plains Baptist Divinity School, 2014] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108014156/http://faithsaves.net/drunk-wine-wherein-excess-filled-spirit-ephesians-518/ |date=2014-11-08 }}, notes: \"Bailey\u2019s ''New Universal English Dictionary of Words, and of Arts and Sciences'' (1730) stated: \"Natural wine, is such as it comes from the grape, without any mixture or sophistication.\" (pg. 658). Juice does not come \"from the grape\" fermented. Thus, wine had the meaning of unfermented, as well as fermented grape juice. Likewise, John Kersey\u2019s ''Dictionarium Anglo-Britannicum, or A General English Dictionary'' (1708) declared: \"Wine [is] a Liquor made of the Juice of Grapes, or other fruit. Liquor or Liquour, anything that is liquid: Drink, Juice, etc. Must, sweet Wine, newly press\u2019d from the grape.\" Wine was made of the juice of grapes and must is defined as \"sweet wine, newly pressed from the grape.\" Further, B. N. Defoe\u2019s ''A Complete English Dictionary'' (1735) defined: \"WINE, a Liquor made of the Juice of Grapes or other fruit. LIQUOR, anything that is liquid: Drink, Juice, Water, &c.\" Wine was not defined as fermented drink, but simply \"the juice of grapes.\" Benjamin Martin\u2019s ''Lingua Britannica Reformata, or A New English Dictionary'' (1748) stated: \"WINE, 1. the juice of the grape. 2. a liquor extracted from other fruits besides the grape. 3. the vapours of wine, as wine disturbs his reason. LIQUOR, or LIQUOUR, any liquid thing, as water, juice, drink, etc.\" (pg. 1045). . . . The translators of the KJV, by uniformly rendering the Greek word ''oinos'' as ''wine'', replicated the Greek word\u2019s reference to both fermented and unfermented juice with an English word that, in their day, was similarly general in reference.</ref> The two-wine view is widespread in conservative [[Evangelicalism]]. Dr. Robert Teachout, a fundamental Baptist seminary professor, argued for this position in his doctoral dissertation ''The Use of \"Wine\" in the Old Testament.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://faithsaves.net/use-wine-old-testament-robert-teachout/|title=The Use of \"Wine\" in the Old Testament, by Robert Teachout Faith Saves|first=Thomas|last=Ross|date=November 27, 2013}}</ref>  Separatist Baptist support for a Biblical total abstinence position is widespread.<ref>E. g., http://kentbrandenburg.blogspot.com/2009/12/not-given-to-much-wine-and-abstaining.html</ref>   Other sources for this view include the [[Purified Translation of the Bible]], where extensive footnotes are used to promote the idea, and the 19th century ''Temperance Bible Commentary''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/temperancebible01burngoog|title=The Temperance Bible-commentary: Giving at One View, Version, Criticism, and Exposition, in Regard to All Passages of Holy Writ Bearing on 'wine' and 'strong Drink,' Or Illustrating the Principles of the Temperance Reformation|first1=Frederic Richard|last1=Lees|first2=Dawson|last2=Burns|date=August 13, 1868|publisher=S.W.

The references [to drinks that can contain alcohol] in the [New Testament] are very much fewer in number, but once more the good and the bad aspects are equally apparent....\"</ref><ref name=\"RaymondP25\">Raymond, p. 25: \"This favorable view [of wine in the Bible], however, is balanced by an unfavorable estimate.... The reason for the presence of these two conflicting opinions on the nature of wine [is that the] consequences of wine drinking follow its use and not its nature. Happy results ensue when it is drunk in its proper measure and evil results when it is drunk to excess. The nature of wine is indifferent.\"</ref><ref>McClintock and Strong, p. 1016: \"But while liberty to use wine, as well as every other earthly blessing, is conceded and maintained in the Bible, yet all abuse of it is solemnly condemned.\"</ref> The relationships between Judaism and alcohol and Christianity and alcohol have generally maintained this same tension, though some modern Christian sects, particularly American Protestant groups around the time of [[Prohibition]], have rejected alcohol as evil. The original versions of the books of the Bible use several different words for alcoholic beverages: at least 10 in [[Hebrew]], and five in [[Greek language|Greek]]. Drunkenness is discouraged and not infrequently portrayed, and some biblical persons abstained from alcohol. Wine is used symbolically, in both positive and negative terms. Its consumption is prescribed for religious rites or medicinal uses in some places.\n\n==Lexigraphy==\nBiblical literature uses several words in its original languages to refer to different types of alcoholic beverages. Some of these words have overlapping meaning, particularly the words in the [[Hebrew language]] compared to the words in [[Koine Greek]], the language of both the [[Septuagint]] and the New Testament. While some deuterocanonical books may have been originally written in Hebrew or the [[Aramaic language]], some were written in Greek. Hence, the meanings of the words used for alcoholic beverages in each of these languages has bearing on alcohol in the Bible.\n\n=== Hebrew ===\nThe [[Hebrew Bible]] was largely written in [[Biblical Hebrew]], with portions in [[Biblical Aramaic]], and has an important [[Ancient Greek]] translation called the [[Septuagint]]. The modern Hebrew Bible, which generally follows the [[Masoretic Text]], uses several words to represent alcoholic beverages:\n{|border=1 class=\"wikitable\"\n!Hebrew !! Transliteration !!

Passages such as Hosea 4:11 make clear that these wines were alcoholic and intoxicating; there is no basis for suggesting that either the Greek or the Hebrew terms for wine refer to unfermented grape juice.\"</ref><ref>http://thirdmill.org/newfiles/kei_mathison/TH.Mathison.Prot.Transub.3.html</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14941-wine|title=WINE - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=jewishencyclopedia.com}}</ref><ref>Pierard, p. 28: \"No evidence whatsoever exists to support the notion that the wine mentioned in the Bible was unfermented grape juice.

Kings were forbidden to abuse alcohol lest their judgments be unjust. It was forbidden to [[priest]]s on duty, though the priests were given \"the finest new wine\" from the first fruits offerings for drinking outside the [[tabernacle]] and temple.\n\nThe [[Nazirite]]s excluded as part of their ascetic regimen not only wine, but also vinegar, grapes, and raisins, though when Nazirites completed the term of their vow they were required to present wine as part of their sacrificial offerings and could drink of it. While [[John the Baptist]] adopted such a regimen, Jesus did not during his three years of ministry.<ref name=\"RaymondP81\">Raymond p. 81: \"Not only did Jesus Christ Himself use and sanction the use of wine but also ... He saw nothing intrinsically evil in wine.(footnote citing [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt+15:11 Mt 15:11])\"</ref>\n\nThe [[Rechabite]]s, a sub-tribe of the [[Kenite]]s, vowed never to drink wine, live in houses, or plant fields or vineyards, not because of any \"threat to wise living\" from the latter [Prov. 20:1] practices, but because of their commitment to a nomadic lifestyle by not being bound to any particular piece of land.<ref name=\"WaltkeP127\" /> The Rechabites's strict obedience to the command of their father \"not to drink wine\" [Jer. 35:14] is commended and is contrasted with the failure of [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Kingdom of Judah]] to listen to their God.\n\nDuring the [[Babylonian captivity]], [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] and his fellow [[Jew]]s abstained from the meat and wine given to them by the king because they saw it as defiling in some way, though precisely how these would have defiled the Jews is not apparent in the text. A later passage implies that Daniel did drink wine at times, though it may not have been the king's. Similarly, Judith refused the [[Assyria]]n general's wine, though she drank wine from the stores she brought with her.\n\nChristians are instructed regarding abstinence and their duty toward immature Christians: \"All food is clean, but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble. It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother to fall.\"<ref>Raymond understands this to mean that \"if an individual by drinking wine either causes others to err through his example or abets a social evil which causes others to succumb to its temptations, then in the interests of Christian love he ought to forego the temporary pleasures of drinking in the interests of heavenly treasures\" (p. 87).</ref>\n\n=== Symbolism and metaphor ===\nThe commonness and centrality of wine in daily life in biblical times is apparent from its many positive and negative metaphorical uses throughout the Bible.<ref>Dommershausen, p. 64.</ref><ref>Raymond, p. 24: \"The numerous allusions to the vine and wine in the Old Testament furnish an admirable basis for the study of its estimation among the people at large.\"</ref> Positively, free wine is used as a symbol of [[divine grace]], and wine is repeatedly compared to intimate love in the [[Song of Solomon]]. Negatively, wine is [[personification|personified]] as a mocker (\"[t]he most hardened apostate\" in the Book of Proverbs whose chief sin is pride)<ref>Waltke (2004), p. 114.</ref> and beer a brawler (one who is \"mocking, noisy, and restless\").<ref name=\"WaltkeP127\" />\n\n[[File:Meeting of abraham and melchizadek.jpg|thumb|left|''Meeting of Abraham and Melchizedek'' by [[Dirk Bouts|Dieric Bouts the Elder]]]]\nAdditionally, the [[chosen people]] and [[kingdom of God]] are compared to a divinely owned vine or vineyard in several places, and the image of new wine being kept in new wineskins, a process that would burst old wineskins, represents that the new faith Jesus was bringing \"cannot be contained within the framework of the old.\"<ref>Browning, p. 395.</ref> The complacent are compared with \"wine left on its dregs\" too long, such that it lacks a good taste and is of no value, and those who are corrupt are compared with excellent wine which has been diluted with water.\n\nWine was also used as a symbol of blessing and judgement throughout the Bible. [[Melchizedek]] blessed and refreshed [[Abraham]]'s army with bread and wine; [[Isaac]] blessed [[Jacob]] by saying, \"May God give you of heaven's dew and of earth's richness \u2013 an abundance of grain and new wine\";<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+27%3A28&version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Genesis 27:28 \u2013 New International Version|website=Bible Gateway}}</ref> and when Jacob blessed his sons, he used a great abundance of wine as a symbol of [[Judah (biblical figure)|Judah]]'s prosperity. The nation of Israel was promised abundant wine and other central crops such as grain and oil<ref>M. S. Miller et al., p. 158f.</ref> if they kept God's [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]] commandments, and their wine would be taken away as a curse if the Israelites failed to keep the covenant.\n\nDrinking a cup of strong wine to the dregs and getting drunk are sometimes presented as a symbol of God's judgement and wrath,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+75:8;+Revelation+16:19;+17:2,6;+18:3&version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Psalm 75:8, Revelation 16:19, Revelation 17:2, Revelation 17:6, Revelation 18:3 \u2013 New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2016-11-06}}</ref> and Jesus alludes this cup of wrath, which he several times says he himself will drink. Similarly, the winepress is pictured as a tool of judgement where the resulting wine symbolizes the blood of the wicked who were crushed. Connected also to the cup of judgement is the wine of immorality, which the evil drink and which both brings and is part of the wrath of God.\n\n[[File:Parable of the Good Samaritan (detail) by Cornelis van Haarlem.jpg|thumb|Detail from ''The Good Samaritan'' by [[Cornelis van Haarlem]] showing the Samaritan pouring oil and wine on the injured man's wounds.]]\n\nThe [[Day of the Lord]], which is often understood by Christians to usher in the [[Messianic Age]], is depicted as a time when \"[n]ew wine will drip from the mountains and flow from all the hills,\"<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Am+9:13;Jl+3:18 Am 9:13; compare Jl 3:18]; [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=is+27:2;&version=49 Is 27:2 (NAS)]</ref> when God's people will \"plant vineyards and drink their wine,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Amos+9%3A14&version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Amos 9:14 \u2013 New International Version|website=Bible Gateway}}</ref> and when God himself \"will prepare a feast of rich food for all peoples, a banquet of aged wine \u2013 the best of meats and the finest of wines.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+25%3A6%2CMatthew+8%3A11%2CMatthew+22%3A2%2CLuke+13%3A29%2CLuke+14%3A15%2CLuke+22%3A28-30%2CRevelation+19%3A9&version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Isaiah 25:6, Matthew 8:11, Matthew 22:2, Luke 13:29, Luke 14:15, Luke 22:28\u201330, Revelation 19:9 \u2013 New International Version|website=Bible Gateway}}</ref>\n\nIn the New Testament, Jesus uses wine at the Last Supper to signify the \"New Covenant in [Jesus'] blood,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+26%3A26-29%2CMark+14%3A22-25%2CLuke+22%3A17-20%2C1+Corinthians+10%3A16%2C1+Corinthians+11%3A23-25&version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Matthew 26:26\u201329, Mark 14:22\u201325, Luke 22:17\u201320, 1 Corinthians 10:16, 1 Corinthians 11:23\u201325 \u2013 New International Version|website=Bible Gateway}}</ref> but Christians differ over precisely how symbolic the wine is in the continuing ritual of the Eucharist.<ref>Lincoln, p. 848.</ref>\n\n===Medicinal uses===\nWine was used in ancient times for various medicinal ends, and the Bible refers to some of these practices.

Advocates of this view, called the \"two-wine\" position, argue that the Greek and Hebrew words rendered \"wine\" in most English versions are generic terms for fruit juices; context determines if the beverage in view is alcoholic or not.  The fact is pointed out that even in earlier stages of the English language, such as in 1611 when the King James Version was translated, \"wine\" could refer to non-alcoholic beverages as well as alcoholic ones.<ref>For example, footnote #7 in the chapter [http://faithsaves.net/drunk-wine-wherein-excess-filled-spirit-ephesians-518/ ''And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit'' in ''The Doctrine of Sanctification'', Thomas Ross, Ph.

Juice does not come \"from the grape\" fermented. Thus, wine had the meaning of unfermented, as well as fermented grape juice. Likewise, John Kersey\u2019s ''Dictionarium Anglo-Britannicum, or A General English Dictionary'' (1708) declared: \"Wine [is] a Liquor made of the Juice of Grapes, or other fruit. Liquor or Liquour, anything that is liquid: Drink, Juice, etc. Must, sweet Wine, newly press\u2019d from the grape.\" Wine was made of the juice of grapes and must is defined as \"sweet wine, newly pressed from the grape.\" Further, B. N. Defoe\u2019s ''A Complete English Dictionary'' (1735) defined: \"WINE, a Liquor made of the Juice of Grapes or other fruit. LIQUOR, anything that is liquid: Drink, Juice, Water, &c.\" Wine was not defined as fermented drink, but simply \"the juice of grapes.\" Benjamin Martin\u2019s ''Lingua Britannica Reformata, or A New English Dictionary'' (1748) stated: \"WINE, 1. the juice of the grape. 2. a liquor extracted from other fruits besides the grape. 3. the vapours of wine, as wine disturbs his reason. LIQUOR, or LIQUOUR, any liquid thing, as water, juice, drink, etc.\" (pg. 1045). . . . The translators of the KJV, by uniformly rendering the Greek word ''oinos'' as ''wine'', replicated the Greek word\u2019s reference to both fermented and unfermented juice with an English word that, in their day, was similarly general in reference.</ref> The two-wine view is widespread in conservative [[Evangelicalism]].

He has since made regular appearances on television (including in ''[[The Camomile Lawn (TV serial)|The Camomile Lawn]]'', 1992) and on stage.\n\nHe played the title role in a [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] production of ''[[Coriolanus (play)|Coriolanus]]'' shortly after graduation from LAMDA; that same season he played Claudio in ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' for the RSC. He also played [[Stanley Kowalski]] in a [[West End theatre|West End]] production of [[Tennessee Williams]]' ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', and ''[[Hamlet]]'' in 2004. He has appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in ''Ring Round the Moon''.

The following year he returned to India to play a renegade [[British East India Company]] officer in ''[[Sharpe's Challenge]]''. In late 2006 he starred as Edward Rochester in the  highly acclaimed [[BBC]] television adaptation of ''[[Jane Eyre (2006 miniseries)|Jane Eyre]]'' (broadcast in the United States on [[PBS]] in early 2007) and ''The Wild West'' in February 2007 for the [[BBC]] in which he played [[General George Armstrong Custer]] in ''[[Custer's Last Stand]]''.\n\nDuring mid-2007, Stephens played the role of Jerry in a revival of [[Harold Pinter]]'s ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' under the direction of [[Roger Michell]]. Later that year, Stephens also starred as Horner in [[Jonathan Kent (director)|Jonathan Kent]]'s revival of [[William Wycherley]]'s ''[[The Country Wife]]''. The play was the inaugural production of the Theatre Royal Haymarket Company, which in addition to Stephens includes the actors/actresses [[Eileen Atkins]], [[Patricia Hodge]], [[David Haig]] and [[Ruthie Henshall]]. Various members of the company are expected to star in upcoming productions at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] with various artistic directors. The formation of the company is considered by many London theatre critics to be a bold move for West End theatre.<ref>David Benedict, \"Theatre Royal Haymarket Gambles\", ''Variety,'' 23 July 2007, online edition.

Billed as a modern [[Jekyll and Hyde]] story, the show was to feature a partially paralysed forensic psychologist whose other personality is a charming criminal. Stephens' casting was highly unusual, because Fox had not yet approved a script nor purchased a pilot for the show. However, in mid-May 2008, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' announced that \"[b]y the time the network picked up the pilot . . .

He has since made regular appearances on television (including in ''[[The Camomile Lawn (TV serial)|The Camomile Lawn]]'', 1992) and on stage.\n\nHe played the title role in a [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] production of ''[[Coriolanus (play)|Coriolanus]]'' shortly after graduation from LAMDA; that same season he played Claudio in ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' for the RSC. He also played [[Stanley Kowalski]] in a [[West End theatre|West End]] production of [[Tennessee Williams]]' ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', and ''[[Hamlet]]'' in 2004.

Aged 33 at the time of film's release, he remains the youngest actor to have played a [[Bond villain]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Larushka |last=Ivan-Zadeh |title=Black Sails actor Toby Stephens: Most British scripts you get sent are just awful |date=20 March 2014 |url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/03/20/black-sails-actor-toby-stephens-most-british-scripts-you-get-sent-are-just-awful-4656483/ |publisher=Metro |accessdate=31 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005 he played the role of a [[British Army]] captain in the Indian film, ''[[Mangal Pandey: The Rising|The Rising: Ballad of Mangal Pandey]]'', portraying events in the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]]. The following year he returned to India to play a renegade [[British East India Company]] officer in ''[[Sharpe's Challenge]]''. In late 2006 he starred as Edward Rochester in the  highly acclaimed [[BBC]] television adaptation of ''[[Jane Eyre (2006 miniseries)|Jane Eyre]]'' (broadcast in the United States on [[PBS]] in early 2007) and ''The Wild West'' in February 2007 for the [[BBC]] in which he played [[General George Armstrong Custer]] in ''[[Custer's Last Stand]]''.\n\nDuring mid-2007, Stephens played the role of Jerry in a revival of [[Harold Pinter]]'s ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' under the direction of [[Roger Michell]]. Later that year, Stephens also starred as Horner in [[Jonathan Kent (director)|Jonathan Kent]]'s revival of [[William Wycherley]]'s ''[[The Country Wife]]''. The play was the inaugural production of the Theatre Royal Haymarket Company, which in addition to Stephens includes the actors/actresses [[Eileen Atkins]], [[Patricia Hodge]], [[David Haig]] and [[Ruthie Henshall]]. Various members of the company are expected to star in upcoming productions at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] with various artistic directors. The formation of the company is considered by many London theatre critics to be a bold move for West End theatre.<ref>David Benedict, \"Theatre Royal Haymarket Gambles\", ''Variety,'' 23 July 2007, online edition.

Billed as a modern [[Jekyll and Hyde]] story, the show was to feature a partially paralysed forensic psychologist whose other personality is a charming criminal. Stephens' casting was highly unusual, because Fox had not yet approved a script nor purchased a pilot for the show. However, in mid-May 2008, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' announced that \"[b]y the time the network picked up the pilot . . .

The production was reportedly the first BBC radio dramatisation of the novel though ''Moonraker'' was on South African radio in 1956, with [[Bob Holness]] providing the voice of Bond.<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Bob_Holness | title=Bob Holness on Game Shows | accessdate=14 September 2007 }}</ref> He has since appeared in a number of adaptations of other James Bond novels.\n\nAlso in May 2008, Stock-pot Productions announced that Stephens will have the lead role in a feature-length film entitled ''Fly Me'', co-starring [[Tim McInnerny]].<ref>[http://www.stockpotproductions.co.uk/ Stock-pot Productions Limited, Blog, 27 May 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060421050551/http://www.stockpotproductions.co.uk/ |date=21 April 2006 }}</ref> Stock-pot was also the producer of ''One Day'', a short 2006 film shown at international film festivals, in which Stephens played a small part as the boss of McInnerny's character.\n\nOn 5 October 2008, Stephens appeared onstage at the [[London Palladium]] as part of a benefit entitled \"The Story of [[James Bond]], A Tribute to [[Ian Fleming]].\" The event, organised by Fleming's niece, [[Lucy Fleming]], featured music from various James Bond films and Bond film stars reading from Fleming's Bond novels. Stephens took the part of James Bond himself in the readings.\n\nIn early December 2008, Stephens read from ''Coda'', the last book written by his good friend [[Simon Gray]], for [[BBC Radio 4]].
