It is an anthology series: each episode has a self-contained story and its own cast. As the title suggests, each story is a thriller of some variety, from tales of the supernatural to down-to-earth [[whodunit]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.is/nj1PC|title=THRILLER - The Complete Series A 16-disc Box Set From Network|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\nThe series was created by [[Brian Clemens]], who also scripted the majority of the episodes and story-lined every installment. It was produced by [[John Sichel]] (the first 3 series), John Cooper (series 4) and Ian Fordyce (the final two series) for [[Associated Television]] (ATV) at their Elstree studios north of London. The series evolved from Clemens' previous work, in particular two films in a similar style: ''[[And Soon the Darkness]]'' (1970) and ''Blind Terror'' (aka ''[[See No Evil (1971 film)|See No Evil]]'', 1971); the latter shares plot similarities with the ''Thriller'' episodes ''The Eyes Have It'' and ''The Next Voice You See''. Original music, including the theme-tune, was supplied by Clemens' regular collaborator [[Laurie Johnson]].\n\nThe original UK title-sequence featured still-shots of locations in the story, devoid of people, shot through a [[fisheye lens]], bordered in bright red and set to Johnson's eerie, discordant theme-music. With an eye to the American re-broadcast market, most episodes, especially from the second season onwards, featured at least one American principal character, portrayed by an American actor. After originally being screened late at night in the U.S. under the [[ABC's Wide World of Entertainment|''ABC Wide World of Entertainment'']] billing from 1973, some episodes were retitled for U.S. syndication in 1978, and all had additional opening sequences shot with new titles and credits but without the original cast and, for this reason, often only featuring menacing figures seen from the neck down.  When the series was re-broadcast as part of [[The CBS Late Movie]] however, the original title-sequences and music were restored.\n\nThe stories were often set in the [[London commuter belt]]. A particular trademark of the series' storytelling was to hook the viewer with a simple yet totally baffling situation, of the kind seen in films such as ''[[Les Diaboliques (film)|Les Diaboliques]]'' (1955).

It is an anthology series: each episode has a self-contained story and its own cast. As the title suggests, each story is a thriller of some variety, from tales of the supernatural to down-to-earth [[whodunit]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.is/nj1PC|title=THRILLER - The Complete Series A 16-disc Box Set From Network|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\nThe series was created by [[Brian Clemens]], who also scripted the majority of the episodes and story-lined every installment. It was produced by [[John Sichel]] (the first 3 series), John Cooper (series 4) and Ian Fordyce (the final two series) for [[Associated Television]] (ATV) at their Elstree studios north of London. The series evolved from Clemens' previous work, in particular two films in a similar style: ''[[And Soon the Darkness]]'' (1970) and ''Blind Terror'' (aka ''[[See No Evil (1971 film)|See No Evil]]'', 1971); the latter shares plot similarities with the ''Thriller'' episodes ''The Eyes Have It'' and ''The Next Voice You See''. Original music, including the theme-tune, was supplied by Clemens' regular collaborator [[Laurie Johnson]].\n\nThe original UK title-sequence featured still-shots of locations in the story, devoid of people, shot through a [[fisheye lens]], bordered in bright red and set to Johnson's eerie, discordant theme-music. With an eye to the American re-broadcast market, most episodes, especially from the second season onwards, featured at least one American principal character, portrayed by an American actor. After originally being screened late at night in the U.S. under the [[ABC's Wide World of Entertainment|''ABC Wide World of Entertainment'']] billing from 1973, some episodes were retitled for U.S. syndication in 1978, and all had additional opening sequences shot with new titles and credits but without the original cast and, for this reason, often only featuring menacing figures seen from the neck down.  When the series was re-broadcast as part of [[The CBS Late Movie]] however, the original title-sequences and music were restored.\n\nThe stories were often set in the [[London commuter belt]]. A particular trademark of the series' storytelling was to hook the viewer with a simple yet totally baffling situation, of the kind seen in films such as ''[[Les Diaboliques (film)|Les Diaboliques]]'' (1955). ''Come Out Come Out, Wherever You Are'' took place at a creaky country-house hotel: a female guest begins asking about her missing travelling-companion who the owner claims was not with her upon arrival the previous evening and whom none of the other guests initially recall seeing. One episode, ''Screamer'', concerns a rape-victim who murders her attacker, only to then see the man stalking her everywhere. Perhaps the most ingenious episode is the ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'' style ''The Double Kill'', in which a man hires a hitman to kill his wife, but makes a fatal error in his otherwise meticulous planning.\n\nOther memorable episodes include: ''Someone at the Top of the Stairs'', one of a handful of forays into the supernatural, in which two female students move into a boarding-house and begin to notice that none of the other residents ever go out or receive any mail; and ''I'm The Girl He Wants to Kill'', in which a witness to a murder finds herself trapped in a deserted office-block overnight with the killer, and is forced to play a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with him to survive (there is barely any dialogue throughout its second half). [[Brian Clemens]]' own favourite episode, ''A Coffin for the Bride'' (US: ''Kiss Kiss, Kill Kill''), featured a performance from a young [[Helen Mirren]].\n\nFollowing a worldwide audit during 2003-04 by the then copyright-holders [[Carlton Television#Expansion|Carlton]], almost all the original UK PAL fisheye-titled [[Quadruplex videotape|2\" videotapes]] of ''Thriller'' were located and transferred onto modern digital tape by the [[British Film Institute]], with subsequent restoration-work by BBC Resources. One exception was the story ''Nurse Will Make It Better''; however, this too exists in PAL/original format on the later [[Type C videotape|1\" videotape]] format as a dub from the original master-tape (this version was broadcast on the satellite-channel Bravo in 1996).\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===Series 1 (1973)===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=\"25%\" | Episode title\n! width=\"6%\" | Original<br />transmission<br />date\n!

Because much of his work was written directly for broadcast little of it survives today.\n\n==Life==\nWhelen was born in London and christened at [[St Martin in the Fields]]. He was bought up by his mother Winifred, a violinist, with help from his Godmother Mary Gotch, also a musician. He became a chorister at [[New College Oxford]], attended [[Worksop College]] (studying piano and cello) and then at the Birmingham and Midland School of Music (now the [[Royal Birmingham Conservatoire]]) between 1944 and 1946 for clarinet and composition.<ref name=jan>'Composer & Conductor Christopher Whelen' posted by ''Janice in Caunes''</ref> After two years with the [[RAF]] for his National Service Whelen secured conducting lessons with the Austrian \u00e9migr\u00e9 [[Rudolf Schwarz (conductor)|Rudolf Schwarz]].<ref name=grove>[https://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/grovemusic/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-5000002933?rskey=IuTaiD Palmer, Christopher. 'Whelen, Christopher' in Grove Music Online]</ref> becoming assistant conductor at the [[Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra|Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra]] under Schwarz.\n\nAlready interested in [[Celts (modern)|Celtic]] culture (particularly [[Yeats]]), the music of [[Arnold Bax]] became a central influence for Whelen after hearing a performance of [[Tintagel (Bax)|Tintagel]].<ref>Foreman, Lewis. ''Bax: A Composer and His Times'' (1983)</ref> A correspondence began in 1947, which led to a lifelong friendship. Around 40 of the letters have been published. In 1951 Whelen conducted Bax's Sixth Symphony in Bournemouth. Bax wrote: \"I still dote on your performance of No 6 and want a repeat\".<ref name=tempo>Scott-Sutherland, Colin. 'Review, Cuchulan Among the Guns' in ''Tempo'' No 2015, January 2001, p 34-5</ref> Through Bax Whelen also met the pianist [[Harriet Cohen]], who became a supporter. He was awarded the [[Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge]] medal for conducting in 1955.<ref name=jan/>\n\nHowever, from 1951 Whelen became musical director at the [[Old Vic Theatre]] in London and most of his conducting commitments were dropped. While there (and from 1955 at other theatres as well) he produced much incidental music for [[Shakespeare]] and other productions.<ref>''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol 7 No 1 (Winter 1956), p 85-6</ref> He composed the music  for [[John Osborne]]'s ''[[The World of Paul Slickey]]'' (1959). This was Osborne's only attempt to write a musical. But after the huge successes of his previous plays ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'' and ''[[The Entertainer (play)|The Entertainer]],'' the play was to become \"one of the most spectacular disasters in English theatre\".<ref>Heilpern, John, ''John Osborne: A Patriot for Us'', 2007, Random House, pp.249-54</ref> Despite this setback, the theatre work led to a series of commissions by the [[BBC]] spanning the 1960s to the 1980s for radio productions with original music, including television and radio operas as well as hard to classify music dramas for which Whelen typically wrote both the words and music, fusing the music and action together.\n\nWhelen met his lifelong partner Dennis Andrews in 1948 in Bournemouth They lived together for many years in [[Cumnor]], Oxfordshire before Whelen's death in 1993.<ref name=jan/> The Christopher Whelen Award for innovation in music in film and theatre was set up in his name. Winners include Paddy Cunneen, [[Jonathan Dove]], [[Andy Price]] and Mick Sands.\n\n==Music==\nWhelen was primarily a music dramatist and his most successful works are the series of radio and television music theatre works commissioned by the BBC starting from the 1960s. His first operatic production, broadcast on 6 August 1961, was ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', for which he contributed new arrangements of the traditional ballads.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/99c092c336a44340a92d70876927b3e5 ''Radio Times'' Issue 1969, 3 August 1961, p 16]</ref> The original radio opera ''The Cancelling Dark'', with text by the poet [[Vernon Scannell]], followed on 5 December 1965.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/56c3c8cc4c014d2a934bbe460e3ca918 ''Radio Times'' Issue 2195, 2 December 1965, p 22]</ref> The action alternates between a crashed aircraft in the African jungle near [[Benguela]] and the radio control room at [[Kakonda]] Airfield. Jeremy Rundall in ''The Sunday Times'' said it \"has an Ancient Mariner-ish ring, and should be heard again\".<ref>''Sunday Times'', 12 December 1965, p 40</ref>\n\nThe specifically commissioned television opera ''Some Place of Darkness'' used an original libretto by the experienced television writer [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]]. The BBC insisted on realism, and the result was \" a sombre domestic drama set in the present, it exemplified all that television promoted\".<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6fwSLslWOjsC&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9&dq=%22Some+place+of+darkness%22+%22television+opera%22&source=bl&ots=b_k28mFrbb&sig=ACfU3U2uiIHxXAQHFjddkSSblEjGXMLm6g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwji-7CJovfoAhUNQRUIHeqrACcQ6AEwAXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Some%20place%20of%20darkness%22%20%22television%20opera%22&f=false Barnes, Jennifer.

The piece, he said \"was the result of a BBC edict - crisp and clear - 'contemporary plot and modern dress'. The words smacked like a damp cloth on the operatic table.\"<ref>Whelen, Christopher. 'Thoughts on Television Opera' in ''Composer'' 24 (1967), p 17</ref>\n\nBy 1969 for ''Incident at Owl Creek'' Whelen had dispensed with a librettist, adapting the source material (based on the short story by [[Ambrose Bierce]]) himself. This led to him writing a text based on an original idea for ''The Findings'' (1972), concerning the excavation of an [[Etruscan architecture|Etruscan]] tomb.<ref>[[Rodney Milnes|Milnes, Rodney]]: \u2018The Findings\u2019 in ''Opera'' 23 (1972), p 945\u20138</ref> Creating his own plot and characters presented through his own words and music, Whelen was attempting to create a more personal form of \"total musical theatre\".<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/e648c51cd2774f2083924651d29f021c ''Radio Times'', Issue 2540, 13 July 1972 p 20]</ref> Christopher Palmer identified ''The Findings'' and ''Incident at Owl Creek'' as \"outstanding\".<ref name=grove/> The music drama ''The Restorer'', produced and directed by [[Martin Esslin]], is an example of Whelen's experimentation with the close combination of words and music. It concerns a picture in a Dutch museum and its influence on visitors, with echoes of [[The Picture of Dorian Gray|Oscar Wilde]] and [[Walter de la Mare]].<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/599e511626ec40488421bb3b9545029a ''Radio Times'' Issue 2823, 15 December 1977, p 57.]</ref>\n\nAnother strand of Whelen's work was in film. He composed the score for [[The Valiant (1962 film)|''The Valiant'']] (1962), [[The Face of Fu Manchu]] (1965) and ''[[Coast of Skeletons]]'' (1965).<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0924083/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm IMDb biography]</ref> There was also a ballet, ''Cul de Sac'', choreographed by [[Norman Morrice]] and staged by [[Ballet Rambert]] on 13 July 1964 at [[Sadler's Wells]].<ref>[https://www.rambert.org.uk/performance-database/works/cul-de-sac/ Ballet Rambert performance archive]</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1964/07/20/archives/problem-ballet-shown-in-london-rambert-troupe-performs-morrices-cul.html '\u2018Problem\u2019 Ballet Shown in London; Rambert Troupe Performs Morrice's \u2018Cul de Sac\u2019' in ''The New York Times'', 20 July 1964]</ref>\n\n==Works==\n\n===Television and radio operas===\n* ''The Cancelling Dark'', radio opera, libretto by Vernon Scannell (1964)\n* ''Some Place of Darkness'', television opera, libretto by John Hopkins (1967)\n* ''Incident at Owl Creek'', radio opera, libretto Whelen after [[Ambrose Bierce]] (1969)\n* ''The Findings'', radio opera, libretto Whelen (1972)\n\n===Radio drama, words and music by Whelen===\n* ''The Restorer'' (1976)\n*  ''Marius Goring in Bridges'', a play with music written for stereo (1976)\n* ''To the Office and Back'', notes towards a portrait of [[Wallace Stevens]] (1978)\n* ''Cumulus'', a weather fantasy (1980)\n* ''The Jigsaw Must Fit'', 'musico-dramatic' work (1983)\n* ''Ed e Subito Sera'', a portrait of [[Salvatore Quasimodo]] (1984)\n* ''Broad Daylight'', a love story in words and music (1986)\n\n===Musical comedies===\n* ''School'' (1957) (adapted from [[Thomas William Robertson|T W Robertson]])\n* ''Whither London'' (1962)\n\n===Selected incidental music for theatre, radio and television===\n* ''Murder in the Cathedral'' by [[T S Eliot]] (1953, Old Vic Company, recording available)<ref>[https://naxosaudiobooks.com/murder-in-the-cathedral-unabridged/ Naxos Audio Books.

''Bax: A Composer and His Times'' (1983)</ref> A correspondence began in 1947, which led to a lifelong friendship. Around 40 of the letters have been published. In 1951 Whelen conducted Bax's Sixth Symphony in Bournemouth. Bax wrote: \"I still dote on your performance of No 6 and want a repeat\".<ref name=tempo>Scott-Sutherland, Colin. 'Review, Cuchulan Among the Guns' in ''Tempo'' No 2015, January 2001, p 34-5</ref> Through Bax Whelen also met the pianist [[Harriet Cohen]], who became a supporter. He was awarded the [[Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge]] medal for conducting in 1955.<ref name=jan/>\n\nHowever, from 1951 Whelen became musical director at the [[Old Vic Theatre]] in London and most of his conducting commitments were dropped. While there (and from 1955 at other theatres as well) he produced much incidental music for [[Shakespeare]] and other productions.<ref>''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol 7 No 1 (Winter 1956), p 85-6</ref> He composed the music  for [[John Osborne]]'s ''[[The World of Paul Slickey]]'' (1959). This was Osborne's only attempt to write a musical. But after the huge successes of his previous plays ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'' and ''[[The Entertainer (play)|The Entertainer]],'' the play was to become \"one of the most spectacular disasters in English theatre\".<ref>Heilpern, John, ''John Osborne: A Patriot for Us'', 2007, Random House, pp.249-54</ref> Despite this setback, the theatre work led to a series of commissions by the [[BBC]] spanning the 1960s to the 1980s for radio productions with original music, including television and radio operas as well as hard to classify music dramas for which Whelen typically wrote both the words and music, fusing the music and action together.\n\nWhelen met his lifelong partner Dennis Andrews in 1948 in Bournemouth They lived together for many years in [[Cumnor]], Oxfordshire before Whelen's death in 1993.<ref name=jan/> The Christopher Whelen Award for innovation in music in film and theatre was set up in his name. Winners include Paddy Cunneen, [[Jonathan Dove]], [[Andy Price]] and Mick Sands.\n\n==Music==\nWhelen was primarily a music dramatist and his most successful works are the series of radio and television music theatre works commissioned by the BBC starting from the 1960s. His first operatic production, broadcast on 6 August 1961, was ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', for which he contributed new arrangements of the traditional ballads.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/99c092c336a44340a92d70876927b3e5 ''Radio Times'' Issue 1969, 3 August 1961, p 16]</ref> The original radio opera ''The Cancelling Dark'', with text by the poet [[Vernon Scannell]], followed on 5 December 1965.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/56c3c8cc4c014d2a934bbe460e3ca918 ''Radio Times'' Issue 2195, 2 December 1965, p 22]</ref> The action alternates between a crashed aircraft in the African jungle near [[Benguela]] and the radio control room at [[Kakonda]] Airfield. Jeremy Rundall in ''The Sunday Times'' said it \"has an Ancient Mariner-ish ring, and should be heard again\".<ref>''Sunday Times'', 12 December 1965, p 40</ref>\n\nThe specifically commissioned television opera ''Some Place of Darkness'' used an original libretto by the experienced television writer [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]]. The BBC insisted on realism, and the result was \" a sombre domestic drama set in the present, it exemplified all that television promoted\".<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6fwSLslWOjsC&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9&dq=%22Some+place+of+darkness%22+%22television+opera%22&source=bl&ots=b_k28mFrbb&sig=ACfU3U2uiIHxXAQHFjddkSSblEjGXMLm6g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwji-7CJovfoAhUNQRUIHeqrACcQ6AEwAXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Some%20place%20of%20darkness%22%20%22television%20opera%22&f=false Barnes, Jennifer.

'Thoughts on Television Opera' in ''Composer'' 24 (1967), p 17</ref>\n\nBy 1969 for ''Incident at Owl Creek'' Whelen had dispensed with a librettist, adapting the source material (based on the short story by [[Ambrose Bierce]]) himself. This led to him writing a text based on an original idea for ''The Findings'' (1972), concerning the excavation of an [[Etruscan architecture|Etruscan]] tomb.<ref>[[Rodney Milnes|Milnes, Rodney]]: \u2018The Findings\u2019 in ''Opera'' 23 (1972), p 945\u20138</ref> Creating his own plot and characters presented through his own words and music, Whelen was attempting to create a more personal form of \"total musical theatre\".<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/e648c51cd2774f2083924651d29f021c ''Radio Times'', Issue 2540, 13 July 1972 p 20]</ref> Christopher Palmer identified ''The Findings'' and ''Incident at Owl Creek'' as \"outstanding\".<ref name=grove/> The music drama ''The Restorer'', produced and directed by [[Martin Esslin]], is an example of Whelen's experimentation with the close combination of words and music. It concerns a picture in a Dutch museum and its influence on visitors, with echoes of [[The Picture of Dorian Gray|Oscar Wilde]] and [[Walter de la Mare]].<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/599e511626ec40488421bb3b9545029a ''Radio Times'' Issue 2823, 15 December 1977, p 57.]</ref>\n\nAnother strand of Whelen's work was in film. He composed the score for [[The Valiant (1962 film)|''The Valiant'']] (1962), [[The Face of Fu Manchu]] (1965) and ''[[Coast of Skeletons]]'' (1965).<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0924083/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm IMDb biography]</ref> There was also a ballet, ''Cul de Sac'', choreographed by [[Norman Morrice]] and staged by [[Ballet Rambert]] on 13 July 1964 at [[Sadler's Wells]].<ref>[https://www.rambert.org.uk/performance-database/works/cul-de-sac/ Ballet Rambert performance archive]</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1964/07/20/archives/problem-ballet-shown-in-london-rambert-troupe-performs-morrices-cul.html '\u2018Problem\u2019 Ballet Shown in London; Rambert Troupe Performs Morrice's \u2018Cul de Sac\u2019' in ''The New York Times'', 20 July 1964]</ref>\n\n==Works==\n\n===Television and radio operas===\n* ''The Cancelling Dark'', radio opera, libretto by Vernon Scannell (1964)\n* ''Some Place of Darkness'', television opera, libretto by John Hopkins (1967)\n* ''Incident at Owl Creek'', radio opera, libretto Whelen after [[Ambrose Bierce]] (1969)\n* ''The Findings'', radio opera, libretto Whelen (1972)\n\n===Radio drama, words and music by Whelen===\n* ''The Restorer'' (1976)\n*  ''Marius Goring in Bridges'', a play with music written for stereo (1976)\n* ''To the Office and Back'', notes towards a portrait of [[Wallace Stevens]] (1978)\n* ''Cumulus'', a weather fantasy (1980)\n* ''The Jigsaw Must Fit'', 'musico-dramatic' work (1983)\n* ''Ed e Subito Sera'', a portrait of [[Salvatore Quasimodo]] (1984)\n* ''Broad Daylight'', a love story in words and music (1986)\n\n===Musical comedies===\n* ''School'' (1957) (adapted from [[Thomas William Robertson|T W Robertson]])\n* ''Whither London'' (1962)\n\n===Selected incidental music for theatre, radio and television===\n* ''Murder in the Cathedral'' by [[T S Eliot]] (1953, Old Vic Company, recording available)<ref>[https://naxosaudiobooks.com/murder-in-the-cathedral-unabridged/ Naxos Audio Books.

In Tucson, Clum had published the ''[[Tucson Citizen]]'', another landmark Arizona newspaper. Prior to taking over the ''Citizen'', Clum had been the U. S. government appointee in charge of the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation. While there, Clum had the distinction of being the only U. S. authority to capture [[Geronimo]], the renegade Apache, although he was later released. He did not finally surrender to the U. S. Army until 1886, bringing the Apache War period to an end.\n\nChided by associates who said he would write an epitaph and not a newspaper, Clum was inspired to call his new publication ''The Tombstone Epitaph''. Setting a tone followed by several subsequent owners and editors, Clum sang Tombstone's praises when he launched what he initially saw as a mining journal. As mayor of Tombstone and publisher of its Republican paper (the rival ''Italic Nugget'' provided the Democratic counterpoint), Clum was among the group of townspeople who supported the Earp brothers as they attempted to enforce law and order in Tombstone in the early 1880s. Tensions between the factions\u2014the Earps and the \"cowboys\"\u2014escalated to a violent showdown near the [[O.K. Corral]] in 1881. In an explosion of gunfire, the Earps and their eclectic friend, Doc Holliday, killed three young cowboys\u2014Frank and Tom McClaury and Billy Clanton. Personal, professional and political disagreements found their outlet on that cold October afternoon, producing an event that continues to inspire historical research and debate.\n\nAlthough an inquest into the shootout determined the shootings were justified, public opinion in Tombstone was with the [[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|outlaw Cowboys]]. The Earps soon left Tombstone, as did Clum, who traveled to Washington, D. C., to accept employment with the U. S. Post Office. Ironically, ownership of ''The Epitaph'' fell to former political adversaries.\n\nAfter Clum left, ''The Epitaph'' remained a going concern, though it could never regain the standing it had prior to 1886, the year Tombstone's silver boom began to crumble as silver prices fell and the mines filled with water. Subsequent editors predicted a return to the heady days of the 1880s, but such a turnaround in the town's financial fortunes never occurred.\n\nTombstone's future seemed tied to its relatively mild desert climate, the emergence of automobile tourism in the 1920s, and its sometimes violent history. Such were the elements that underlay Tombstone's first Helldorado celebration in 1929\u2014an event orchestrated by one of Tombstone's greatest boosters, editor William Kelly. But soon Kelly was gone and ''The Epitaph'' passed into new hands as it continued to cover local news and take on job printing from area clients.\n\n''The Epitaph'' was prominently featured in the late 1950s TV series [[Tombstone_Territory|Tombstone Territory]].       Then-editor Clayton A. Smith was credited for his \"full cooperation\" at the end of many episodes.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvTT22yyI7o&feature=youtube.com&t=1540</ref>\n\n== A new era in the Old West ==\nBy the early 1960s, popular interest in Old West history and western vacations put Tombstone, Arizona on the map once again. Led by Harold O. Love, of Detroit, Mich., investors purchased ''The Epitaph'', the O. K. Corral, the Crystal Palace, and Schieffelin Hall, and set about to showcase them to Tombstone visitors. As more and more ''Epitaph'' visitors expressed interest in learning more about Tombstone and Old West history, the newspaper owners decided to split the paper into 2 separate editions\u2014a national historical monthly and a local weekly newspaper. In doing so, the owners felt they could serve the interests of visitors and residents at the same time.\n\nIn 1975, ''The Tombstone Epitaph'' National Edition was launched as \"the historical monthly journal of the Old West.\" Since that time, it has showcased the research of western writers and historians with stories devoted to western exploration, mining and ranching history, outlaw and lawman history, Native American history, the U. S. Army and warfare in the West, western women, frontier photography, and western personalities, among other topics. Named a national journalistic landmark by Sigma Delta Chi, the Society of Professional Journalists, the monthly journal reaches an international audience.\n\n==Publication==\n[[File:Tombstone epitaph., December 31, 1922.pdf|thumb|left|Cover of the December 31, 1922 edition.]]\nThe national historical monthly is published by Tombstone Epitaph, Inc., an Arizona corporation. A separate biweekly edition of ''The Tombstone Epitaph'', which contains local news, is published by the University of Arizona Journalism Department under a use agreement between the Epitaph corporation and the university. Although they bear the same name, there is no editorial connection between the two publications.\n\nIn addition to publishing the historical monthly, ''The Epitaph'' office in Tombstone's historical district welcomes visitors from 9:30&nbsp;a.m. and 5 p.m. daily. Inside of Tombstone's oldest continually operated business, visitors can watch a free video presentation on printing in the 1880s, view a Washington flat bed press on which early issues of ''The Epitaph'' were printed, explore a large museum devoted to the era of \"hot metal\" printing, see rare photographs and other early Tombstone newspapers, and learn much about the life of [[John Clum|John Philip Clum]], the frontiersman who started ''The Epitaph'' after Tombstone burst on the western mining scene after silver was discovered by Ed Schieffelin in 1877.\n\nSubscriptions to the national edition -- $25 in the U. S. and $50 elsewhere\u2014can be started by visiting ''The Epitaph's'' website<ref>[http://www.tombstoneepitaph.com Tombstoneepitaph.com]</ref> or by writing to ''The Tombstone Epitaph'', P. O. Box 1880, Tombstone, AZ 85638-1880.\n\nIn 1975, Tombstone Epitaph, Inc. reached an agreement with the University of Arizona Journalism Department to continue publication of the local edition, which circulates in Tombstone. As a result, the local edition is produced by journalism students on a biweekly basis during the academic year. More information on the local edition may be found at the local edition's website www.TheEpitaph.com, or at the journalism department's webpage.<ref>[http://www.journalism.arizona.edu/publications/epitaph Journalism.arizona.edu]</ref>\n\n==Previous editors==\n* John Clum (1881-1882)\n* Sam Purdy (1882-1882)\n* Charles Reppy (1882-1886)\n* Harry Brooks (1886-1886)\n* J.

In doing so, the owners felt they could serve the interests of visitors and residents at the same time.\n\nIn 1975, ''The Tombstone Epitaph'' National Edition was launched as \"the historical monthly journal of the Old West.\" Since that time, it has showcased the research of western writers and historians with stories devoted to western exploration, mining and ranching history, outlaw and lawman history, Native American history, the U. S. Army and warfare in the West, western women, frontier photography, and western personalities, among other topics. Named a national journalistic landmark by Sigma Delta Chi, the Society of Professional Journalists, the monthly journal reaches an international audience.\n\n==Publication==\n[[File:Tombstone epitaph., December 31, 1922.pdf|thumb|left|Cover of the December 31, 1922 edition.]]\nThe national historical monthly is published by Tombstone Epitaph, Inc., an Arizona corporation. A separate biweekly edition of ''The Tombstone Epitaph'', which contains local news, is published by the University of Arizona Journalism Department under a use agreement between the Epitaph corporation and the university. Although they bear the same name, there is no editorial connection between the two publications.\n\nIn addition to publishing the historical monthly, ''The Epitaph'' office in Tombstone's historical district welcomes visitors from 9:30&nbsp;a.m. and 5 p.m. daily. Inside of Tombstone's oldest continually operated business, visitors can watch a free video presentation on printing in the 1880s, view a Washington flat bed press on which early issues of ''The Epitaph'' were printed, explore a large museum devoted to the era of \"hot metal\" printing, see rare photographs and other early Tombstone newspapers, and learn much about the life of [[John Clum|John Philip Clum]], the frontiersman who started ''The Epitaph'' after Tombstone burst on the western mining scene after silver was discovered by Ed Schieffelin in 1877.\n\nSubscriptions to the national edition -- $25 in the U. S. and $50 elsewhere\u2014can be started by visiting ''The Epitaph's'' website<ref>[http://www.tombstoneepitaph.com Tombstoneepitaph.com]</ref> or by writing to ''The Tombstone Epitaph'', P. O. Box 1880, Tombstone, AZ 85638-1880.\n\nIn 1975, Tombstone Epitaph, Inc. reached an agreement with the University of Arizona Journalism Department to continue publication of the local edition, which circulates in Tombstone. As a result, the local edition is produced by journalism students on a biweekly basis during the academic year. More information on the local edition may be found at the local edition's website www.TheEpitaph.com, or at the journalism department's webpage.<ref>[http://www.journalism.arizona.edu/publications/epitaph Journalism.arizona.edu]</ref>\n\n==Previous editors==\n* John Clum (1881-1882)\n* Sam Purdy (1882-1882)\n* Charles Reppy (1882-1886)\n* Harry Brooks (1886-1886)\n* J.

Her work reflects certain recurring themes such as nature, magic, faith and redemption, and often references visual art.\n\n== Background ==\nMarly Youmans grew up in [[Louisiana]], [[North Carolina]], and elsewhere. She currently lives in the village of [[Cooperstown, New York]], with her husband and three children. She graduated from [[Hollins College]], [[Brown University]], and [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].  She taught at [[State University of New York]] but quit academia after receiving promotion and tenure in her fifth year.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xxd451POnpYC&pg=PT485&dq=Marly+Youmans&cd=5#v=onepage&q=Marly%20Youmans&f=false| title=Southern writers: a new biographical dictionary| editors=Joseph M. Flora, Amber Vogel, Bryan Albin Giemza| publisher=LSU Press| year= 2006| isbn=978-0-8071-3123-7 }}</ref>\n\n== Writing ==\nHer published work consists of five books of poetry, eight novels and two fantasies for young readers, as well as uncollected short stories, essays and poems. Across all these idioms, her work displays a commitment to rhythm, the sound of words, imagery and complexity of form and allusion. ''Thaliad'', for example, is an epic poem that tells a compelling story of children who survive an apocalypse to begin a new society, written as though a spoken history remembranced in blank verse a generation on. Her novels have been described as 'literary fiction at its finest' in ''Books and Culture''<ref>[http://www.booksandculture.com/articles/webexclusives/2012/may/whitecamellia.html Linda McCullough Moore, Books and Culture, May 2012]</ref> while ''The Advocate'' has cited her skill at mastering poetic forms.<ref>[http://theadvocate.com/utility/homepagestories/4857392-129/poets-invite-readers-to-share Greg Langley, ''The Advocate'', 30 January 2013]</ref> The editor of Books and Culture says, \"Youmans (pronounced like 'yeoman' with an 's' added) is the best-kept secret among contemporary American writers.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Top Ten Books of 2003|url = http://www.booksandculture.com/articles/webexclusives/2003/december/031222.html|website = Books and Culture|access-date = 2016-01-29}}</ref>\n\nHer books demonstrate a number of continuing interests: in lives lived close to nature, whether in the past (''Catherwood'') or the future (''Thaliad''), magic, faith and redemption (''Val/Orson'', ''The Foliate Head'') and the individual\u2019s journey from youth to adulthood (''Inglewood'', ''A Death at the White Camelia Orphanage''). Visual art is often referenced in her work and ''Charis in the World of Wonders,'' ''The Book of the Red King,'' ''Thaliad,'' ''The Foliate Head, Glimmerglass, and Maze of Blood'' were collaborations with the artist [[Clive Hicks-Jenkins]] with decorations throughout the texts.

South Carolina]]) is an American poet, novelist and short story writer. Her work reflects certain recurring themes such as nature, magic, faith and redemption, and often references visual art.\n\n== Background ==\nMarly Youmans grew up in [[Louisiana]], [[North Carolina]], and elsewhere. She currently lives in the village of [[Cooperstown, New York]], with her husband and three children. She graduated from [[Hollins College]], [[Brown University]], and [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].  She taught at [[State University of New York]] but quit academia after receiving promotion and tenure in her fifth year.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xxd451POnpYC&pg=PT485&dq=Marly+Youmans&cd=5#v=onepage&q=Marly%20Youmans&f=false| title=Southern writers: a new biographical dictionary| editors=Joseph M. Flora, Amber Vogel, Bryan Albin Giemza| publisher=LSU Press| year= 2006| isbn=978-0-8071-3123-7 }}</ref>\n\n== Writing ==\nHer published work consists of five books of poetry, eight novels and two fantasies for young readers, as well as uncollected short stories, essays and poems. Across all these idioms, her work displays a commitment to rhythm, the sound of words, imagery and complexity of form and allusion. ''Thaliad'', for example, is an epic poem that tells a compelling story of children who survive an apocalypse to begin a new society, written as though a spoken history remembranced in blank verse a generation on. Her novels have been described as 'literary fiction at its finest' in ''Books and Culture''<ref>[http://www.booksandculture.com/articles/webexclusives/2012/may/whitecamellia.html Linda McCullough Moore, Books and Culture, May 2012]</ref> while ''The Advocate'' has cited her skill at mastering poetic forms.<ref>[http://theadvocate.com/utility/homepagestories/4857392-129/poets-invite-readers-to-share Greg Langley, ''The Advocate'', 30 January 2013]</ref> The editor of Books and Culture says, \"Youmans (pronounced like 'yeoman' with an 's' added) is the best-kept secret among contemporary American writers.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Top Ten Books of 2003|url = http://www.booksandculture.com/articles/webexclusives/2003/december/031222.html|website = Books and Culture|access-date = 2016-01-29}}</ref>\n\nHer books demonstrate a number of continuing interests: in lives lived close to nature, whether in the past (''Catherwood'') or the future (''Thaliad''), magic, faith and redemption (''Val/Orson'', ''The Foliate Head'') and the individual\u2019s journey from youth to adulthood (''Inglewood'', ''A Death at the White Camelia Orphanage''). Visual art is often referenced in her work and ''Charis in the World of Wonders,'' ''The Book of the Red King,'' ''Thaliad,'' ''The Foliate Head, Glimmerglass, and Maze of Blood'' were collaborations with the artist [[Clive Hicks-Jenkins]] with decorations throughout the texts. She provided the title poems for an illustrated anthology, ''The Book of Ystwyth: Six Poets on the Art of Clive Hicks-Jenkins''.<ref>Bonta, Dave, Callum James, Andrea Selch, Catriona Urquhart, Damian Walford Davies and Marly Youmans, ''The Book of Ystwyth: Six Poets on the Art of Clive Hicks-Jenkins'' (2011: Carolina Wren Press) {{ISBN|978-0-932112-89-7}}\n</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\nYoumans has been awarded many \"book of the year\" and \"best of the year\" citations by magazines, newspapers, and organizations. She is the winner of [[The Michael Shaara Award for Excellence in Civil War Fiction]] for ''The Wolf Pit'',<ref>{{cite news |title=SON'S PASSION FOR CIVIL WAR LED HER TO WRITE AWARD-WINNING BOOK |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SL&p_theme=sl&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F46E0A49BD671B3&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] |date=June 26, 2002 |accessdate=2008-09-18 }}</ref> her third novel, which was also on the short list for The Southern Book Award.  She is a two-time winner of the Theodore Hoepfner Award for the short story and the winner of the New Writers Award of ''Capital Magazine'' (New York), also for the short story. Her latest awards are [[The Ferrol Sams Award for Fiction]] and the Silver in fiction, [[Www.indiefab.forewordreviews.com/winners/2012/general|ForeWord BOTYA Awards]] for ''A Death at the White Camellia Orphanage'' (Mercer University Press, 2012.) ''Glimmerglass'' and ''Maze of Blood'' were ForeWord BOTYA finalists. She has held fellowships from Yaddo, New York State, and elsewhere.\n\nShe was a judge of the 2012 National Book Awards.<ref>[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-2012#.UQ7Xiu37VT4 National Book Awards 2012]</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n=== Novels ===\n* ''Little Jordan'' (Boston: David R.
