Bees have two pairs of wings, while ''B. major'' has only one pair.

Egg deposition takes place by the female hovering above the entrance of a host insect nest, usually a solitary bee, and throwing down her eggs using a flicking movement.<ref name=\"Boesi, R., Polidori, C. and Andrietti, F.\">Boesi, R., Polidori, C. and Andrietti, F.  2009 \u2014 Searching for the Right Target: Oviposition and Feeding Behavior in Bombylius Bee Flies (Diptera:Bombyliidae).''Zool.

This is facilitated by the characterizable long proboscis of the fly, which is horizontally inserted into the flower.<ref name=\":0\" /> This occurs as the fly continues to buzz in the air, without touching either the anthers or stigma of the flower.<ref name=\":0\" /> The fly also consumes pollen as part of its diet, with considerable differences between the sexes.

However, an examination of the gut showed a regularly lower amount of pollen than in females. Males consistently consume less quantities of pollen than females. Ingestion of pollen differs throughout a male life cycle, with more pollen being consumed in towards earlier stages. Overall, males had a preference for nectar and fed on significantly greater portions of nectar over pollen.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Behavior ==\nThere is continued research on the behavior of ''B. major'' in respect to environmental factors, mating, and human interaction.\n[[File:2014.03.29.-12-Mannheim Neckarau Waldpark-Grosser Wollschweber.jpeg|thumb|left|In flight]]\n=== Flight ===\nIt has been discovered that the fly is capable of a unique type of flight behavior, which was discovered with the use of a high speed camera. In this behavior, the flies are seen to rotate around a vertical axis as they fly (this action is known as \u201cyawing\u201d). However, it is still unknown what can cause this behavior to be triggered and what purpose it serves, but a proposed explanation includes mating habits.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Layer|first=Stefan|date=2013-06-25|title=Unusual Flight Behaviour in the Beefly Bombylius major (Diptera: Bombylidae)|journal=Entomologia Generalis|volume=34|issue=3|pages=161\u2013168|doi=10.1127/entom.gen/34/2013/161|issn=0171-8177}}</ref>\n\n=== Pollinator Role ===\nThe ''B. major'' bee-fly is a common, [[Pollinator|generalist floral pollinator]], meaning that it does not give preference to one flower over another, instead pollinating a wide variety of plant families and species.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|date=1980-11-01|title=Abstract|url=https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/20/4/723/211235|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|volume=20|issue=4|pages=723\u2013972|doi=10.1093/icb/20.4.723|issn=1540-7063}}</ref> The fly uses its proboscis to carry and transfer the pollen. The species is a dominant pollinator within its community, sometimes even pollinating up to two thirds of the local flowers. In addition, ''B. major'' will visit and pollinate plants that attract few other species. Some types of flowers, for example ''[[Pulmonaria officinalis]],'' will be almost exclusively pollinated by ''B. major'', with other species contributing a negligible amount to that plants pollination. Some flower species, such as ''[[Delphinium tricorne]]'', are even specifically adapted to the fly in terms of color, shape, and form. If given the choice, ''B. major'' will have a consistency in plant choice.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Flower Attraction ===\nLong distance floral attraction is governed by optical sense, with color being the most important factor. The flies are typically more attracted to blue and violet colors, and occasionally yellow, over orange and pink. However, short distance floral attraction is based on the fly\u2019s olfactory sense.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[File:Bombylius major - Leithagebirge.jpg|thumb|Sunbathing|alt=|left]]<br />\n=== Activity ===\nThe fly is mostly active during day hours when the weather conditions are warm and sunny. ''B. major'' is attracted to sunnier places and is more likely to pollinate these areas, with a larger average of flower visits in areas of higher amounts of sunshine. The fly will hide in the trees during the night<ref name=\":0\" /> and usually dart away from a cast shadow.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of soldierflies and allies recorded in Britain]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite book |author1=Donald Joyce Borror  |author2=Dwight Moore DeLong  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=An Introduction to the Study of Insects |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontost0000borr  |url-access=registration  |location=New York |publisher=[[Holt, Rinehart and Winston]] |year=1964 |edition=2nd}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Bombylius major|''Bombylius major''}}\n* {{cite web |title=Bee Fly - ''Bombylius major'' |publisher=North American Insects and Spiders |url=http://www.cirrusimage.com/flies_bee_Bombylius_major.htm |accessdate=22 March 2019}}\n* {{cite web |title=Bee Fly - ''Bombylius major'', Species Information Page |publisher=Brickfields Country Park |url=http://www.brickfieldspark.org/data/beeflybombyliusmajor.htm |accessdate=22 March 2019 |date=December 28, 2009}}\n* {{cite web |title=BeeFly |publisher=Kendall Bioresearch |url=http://www.kendalluk.com/beefly.htm |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713142856/http://www.kendalluk.com/beefly.htm |archivedate=July 13, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=March 2019}} \n* {{cite web |title=Species ''Bombylius major'' - Greater Bee Fly |publisher=BugGuide.Net |url=http://bugguide.net/node/view/14997 |accessdate=22 March 2019}}\n* [http://500px.com/photo/79888947/bombylius-by-felipe-vilarroya?frouser_library Photograph by Felipe vilarroya]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1549111}}\n\n[[Category:Bombyliidae]]\n[[Category:Pollinator flies]]\n[[Category:Asilomorph flies of Europe]]\n[[Category:Diptera of Asia]]\n[[Category:Diptera of North America]]\n[[Category:Insects of the United States]]\n[[Category:Insects described in 1758]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "text_old": "{{Taxobox\n| image = Grosser Wollschweber Bombylius major.jpg\n| image_caption = \n| regnum = [[Animal]]ia\n| phylum = [[Arthropod]]a\n| classis = [[Insect]]a\n| ordo = [[Fly|Diptera]]\n| familia = [[Bombyliidae]]\n| genus = ''[[Bombylius]]''\n| species = '''''B. major'''''\n| binomial = ''Bombylius major''\n| binomial_authority = [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|1758]]\n| synonyms = Large bee-fly or dark-edged bee-fly\n*''Asilus lanigerus'' <small>[[\u00c9tienne Louis Geoffroy|Geoffroy]], 1785</small>\n*''Bombylius aequalis'' <small>[[Johan Christian Fabricius|Fabricius]], 1781</small>\n*''Bombylius albipectus'' <small>[[Justin Pierre Marie Macquart|Macquart]], 1855</small>\n*''Bombylius anonymus'' <small>[[Johann Heinrich Sulzer|Sulzer]], 1761</small>\n*''Bombylius antenoreus'' <small>[[Paolo Lioy|Lioy]], 1864</small>\n*''Bombylius australis'' <small>[[Paolo Lioy|Lioy]], 1855</small>\n*''Bombylius basilinea'' <small>[[Paolo Lioy|Lioy]], 1855</small>\n*''Bombylius consanguineus'' <small>[[Justin Pierre Marie Macquart|Macquart]], 1840</small>\n*''Bombylius fratellus'' <small>[[Christian Rudolph Wilhelm Wiedemann|Wiedemann]], 1828</small>\n*''Bombylius variegatus'' <small>[[Charles De Geer|De Geer]], 1776</small>\n*''Bombylius vicinus'' <small>[[Justin Pierre Marie Macquart|Macquart]], 1840</small>\n}}\n\n'''''Bombylius major''''' (commonly named the '''large bee-fly''' or the '''dark-edged bee-fly''') is a parasitic bee mimic fly.

This\u00a0mimicry is likely a defense mechanism against predators and also allows the species to get close to the nest of their hosts. However, there are several distinguishable factors. Bees have two pairs of wings, while ''B. major'' has only one pair. The body is more triangular shaped than the typical round oval shape of a bumblebee.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Life History ==\n[[File:Bombylius egg ejection 290310 1504.gif|thumb|left|Flicking an egg |163x163px]]\n[[File:Bombylius major o1.JPG|thumb|''B. major'' egg]]\n''B. major'' is mostly seen in the spring, beginning to appear at the end of March and large numbers seen until the end of May, with the species being sighted into June.<ref name=\":0\" /> The fly is [[Holometabolism|holometabolous]].<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n[[File:Bombylius major (mating).jpg|thumb|''Bombylius major'' mating in Suzuka Mountains, Inabe, Mie prefecture, Japan.|235x235px]]\n''B. major'' has several host species, including the brood of solitary wasps and bees, particularly digging bees such as ''[[Andrena]]''. Egg deposition takes place by the female hovering above the entrance of a host insect nest, usually a solitary bee, and throwing down her eggs using a flicking movement.<ref name=\"Boesi, R., Polidori, C. and Andrietti, F.\">Boesi, R., Polidori, C. and Andrietti, F.  2009 \u2014 Searching for the Right Target: Oviposition and Feeding Behavior in Bombylius Bee Flies (Diptera:Bombyliidae).''Zool.

If the female is unable to flick her eggs near the nest she plants them on flowers visited by the host insects. The developing larvae then make their way to the host nest or attach themselves to the bees or wasps to then be carried to the nest.<ref name=\"Boesi, R., Polidori, C. and Andrietti, F.\" />\n\n=== Egg ===\nThe parasitic eggs of ''B. major'' are produced in large numbers, however few will make it to the host insect burrow entrance.<ref name=\":2\" /> The female fly will dip down and coat her rear abdomen with dust that covers the eggs as they leave the female. \n\n=== Larvae ===\n[[File:Bombylius major (3550379749).jpg|thumb|''B. major'' adult]]\nLarvae live parasitically in the nests of various solitary bees and wasps.<ref name=\":0\" /> When the fly larva locates a host larva, it will consume it slowly, greatly increasing in size\u00a0as it tightly holds onto the host, eventually becoming a pupa and overwintering.<ref name=\":2\" />\n=== Pupae ===\nWhite larvae gradually turn into a yellowish brown pupa, with distinct mouthparts, wings, antennae, and legs.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Diet ==\n[[File:Bombylius major gathering nectar.jpg|thumb|''B. major'' feeding on nectar]]\nThe species acts as a [[Nectar robbing|nectar robber]]; this foraging behavior allows the species to feed on floral nectar and is an essential part of adult fly diets. This is facilitated by the characterizable long proboscis of the fly, which is horizontally inserted into the flower.<ref name=\":0\" /> This occurs as the fly continues to buzz in the air, without touching either the anthers or stigma of the flower.<ref name=\":0\" /> The fly also consumes pollen as part of its diet, with considerable differences between the sexes.

However, an examination of the gut showed a regularly lower amount of pollen than in females. Males consistently consume less quantities of pollen than females. Ingestion of pollen differs throughout a male life cycle, with more pollen being consumed in towards earlier stages. Overall, males had a preference for nectar and fed on significantly greater portions of nectar over pollen.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Behavior ==\nThere is continued research on the behavior of ''B. major'' in respect to environmental factors, mating, and human interaction.\n[[File:2014.03.29.-12-Mannheim Neckarau Waldpark-Grosser Wollschweber.jpeg|thumb|left|In flight]]\n=== Flight ===\nIt has been discovered that the fly is capable of a unique type of flight behavior, which was discovered with the use of a high speed camera. In this behavior, the flies are seen to rotate around a vertical axis as they fly (this action is known as \u201cyawing\u201d). However, it is still unknown what can cause this behavior to be triggered and what purpose it serves, but a proposed explanation includes mating habits.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Layer|first=Stefan|date=2013-06-25|title=Unusual Flight Behaviour in the Beefly Bombylius major (Diptera: Bombylidae)|journal=Entomologia Generalis|volume=34|issue=3|pages=161\u2013168|doi=10.1127/entom.gen/34/2013/161|issn=0171-8177}}</ref>\n\n=== Pollinator Role ===\nThe ''B. major'' bee-fly is a common, [[Pollinator|generalist floral pollinator]], meaning that it does not give preference to one flower over another, instead pollinating a wide variety of plant families and species.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|date=1980-11-01|title=Abstract|url=https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/20/4/723/211235|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|volume=20|issue=4|pages=723\u2013972|doi=10.1093/icb/20.4.723|issn=1540-7063}}</ref> The fly uses its proboscis to carry and transfer the pollen. The species is a dominant pollinator within its community, sometimes even pollinating up to two thirds of the local flowers. In addition, ''B. major'' will visit and pollinate plants that attract few other species. Some types of flowers, for example ''[[Pulmonaria officinalis]],'' will be almost exclusively pollinated by ''B. major'', with other species contributing a negligible amount to that plants pollination. Some flower species, such as ''[[Delphinium tricorne]]'', are even specifically adapted to the fly in terms of color, shape, and form. If given the choice, ''B. major'' will have a consistency in plant choice.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Flower Attraction ===\nLong distance floral attraction is governed by optical sense, with color being the most important factor. The flies are typically more attracted to blue and violet colors, and occasionally yellow, over orange and pink. However, short distance floral attraction is based on the fly\u2019s olfactory sense.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[File:Bombylius major - Leithagebirge.jpg|thumb|Sunbathing|alt=|left]]<br />\n=== Activity ===\nThe fly is mostly active during day hours when the weather conditions are warm and sunny. ''B. major'' is attracted to sunnier places and is more likely to pollinate these areas, with a larger average of flower visits in areas of higher amounts of sunshine. The fly will hide in the trees during the night<ref name=\":0\" /> and usually dart away from a cast shadow.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of soldierflies and allies recorded in Britain]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite book |author1=Donald Joyce Borror  |author2=Dwight Moore DeLong  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=An Introduction to the Study of Insects |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontost0000borr  |url-access=registration  |location=New York |publisher=[[Holt, Rinehart and Winston]] |year=1964 |edition=2nd}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Bombylius major|''Bombylius major''}}\n* {{cite web |title=Bee Fly - ''Bombylius major'' |publisher=North American Insects and Spiders |url=http://www.cirrusimage.com/flies_bee_Bombylius_major.htm |accessdate=22 March 2019}}\n* {{cite web |title=Bee Fly - ''Bombylius major'', Species Information Page |publisher=Brickfields Country Park |url=http://www.brickfieldspark.org/data/beeflybombyliusmajor.htm |accessdate=22 March 2019 |date=December 28, 2009}}\n* {{cite web |title=BeeFly |publisher=Kendall Bioresearch |url=http://www.kendalluk.com/beefly.htm |accessdate=June 1, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713142856/http://www.kendalluk.com/beefly.htm |archivedate=July 13, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=March 2019}} \n* {{cite web |title=Species ''Bombylius major'' - Greater Bee Fly |publisher=BugGuide.Net |url=http://bugguide.net/node/view/14997 |accessdate=22 March 2019}}\n* [http://500px.com/photo/79888947/bombylius-by-felipe-vilarroya?frouser_library Photograph by Felipe vilarroya]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1549111}}\n\n[[Category:Bombyliidae]]\n[[Category:Pollinator flies]]\n[[Category:Asilomorph flies of Europe]]\n[[Category:Diptera of Asia]]\n[[Category:Diptera of North America]]\n[[Category:Insects of the United States]]\n[[Category:Insects described in 1758]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "name_user": "Jesuschristposed", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDescription:removed nonsense sentence", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombylius_major"}

It went through several design prototypes, named Mechta I, Mechta II and Russia I and II. The Russia II was the version submitted to the competition. The bid involved forming a new concern, the ''Aircraft Cooperative Mechta'' and building three hand-made prototypes. The aircraft performed well in the competition and the fly-off held in [[Oerlinghausen]], [[Germany]], but the lack of a manufacturing facility behind the design, plus political pressures put the design in second place, with the Polish [[Politechnika Warszawska PW-5]] winning.<ref name=\"SD\" /><ref name=\"glidingsport\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.glidingsport.ru/ac/en/ourhistory/inde07.html|title = This Russian enterprise Aviastroitel |accessdate = 7 August 2011|last = Aviastroitel|authorlink = |year = 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"GliderAirCraftHist\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.glider.ru/en/content/our-history|title = Our History|accessdate = 7 October 2011|last = Glider Air Craft|year = 2009|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111022234501/http://www.glider.ru/en/content/our-history|archive-date = 22 October 2011|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\nThe glider was certified in Europe by Roger Ellis of Kenilworth International Ltd, who arranged for airframe testing at TsAGI in Moscow and performed all the flight testing in England. With the assistance and oversight of the British Gliding Association the glider was certified to JAR-22 standards in October 1994, and called the Me-7 (Mechta 7) for European sales. A number of changes to the airframe were required for certification, making the Me7 variant different to the AC4.  A production quality-control problem was identified in 1999 and European sales ended at that time.  \n\nThe American team at the World Class competition was very impressed with the Russian design, thought it would sell well for [[Club class]] and student solo flying and bought one of the three prototypes to take home with them. The aircraft proved popular and so a US distributorship under the name ''Russia 12.6'' was set up to sell the Russian production. Since the Aircraft Cooperative Mechta could not mass-produce the aircraft they reformed as Aviastroitel. In 1994 US distribution was transferred to ''Mechta Sailplanes, LLC'', which imported 18 Russia gliders. Aviastroitel created a second set of molds to respond to the demand and started a second assembly line with a total production capacity of 48 AC-4s per year. In 1997 William Ayd became US distributor under the name ''Russia Sailplanes, Inc.'' Production of the AC-4 was suspended in 2003 when the Russian government changed the requirements for industrial production, making building them  uneconomical. In 2010 Aviastroitel became [[Glider Air Craft]] and production resumed.<ref name=\"glidingsport\" /><ref name=\"GliderAirCraftHist\" />\n\nThe aircraft is made from [[fibreglass]].

It went through several design prototypes, named Mechta I, Mechta II and Russia I and II. The Russia II was the version submitted to the competition. The bid involved forming a new concern, the ''Aircraft Cooperative Mechta'' and building three hand-made prototypes. The aircraft performed well in the competition and the fly-off held in [[Oerlinghausen]], [[Germany]], but the lack of a manufacturing facility behind the design, plus political pressures put the design in second place, with the Polish [[Politechnika Warszawska PW-5]] winning.<ref name=\"SD\" /><ref name=\"glidingsport\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.glidingsport.ru/ac/en/ourhistory/inde07.html|title = This Russian enterprise Aviastroitel |accessdate = 7 August 2011|last = Aviastroitel|authorlink = |year = 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"GliderAirCraftHist\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.glider.ru/en/content/our-history|title = Our History|accessdate = 7 October 2011|last = Glider Air Craft|year = 2009|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111022234501/http://www.glider.ru/en/content/our-history|archive-date = 22 October 2011|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\nThe glider was certified in Europe by Roger Ellis of Kenilworth International Ltd, who arranged for airframe testing at TsAGI in Moscow and performed all the flight testing in England. With the assistance and oversight of the British Gliding Association the glider was certified to JAR-22 standards in October 1994, and called the Me-7 (Mechta 7) for European sales. A production quality-control problem was identified in 1999 and European sales ended at that time.  \n\nThe American team at the World Class competition was very impressed with the Russian design, thought it would sell well for [[Club class]] and student solo flying and bought one of the three prototypes to take home with them. The aircraft proved popular and so a US distributorship under the name ''Russia 12.6'' was set up to sell the Russian production. Since the Aircraft Cooperative Mechta could not mass-produce the aircraft they reformed as Aviastroitel. In 1994 US distribution was transferred to ''Mechta Sailplanes, LLC'', which imported 18 Russia gliders. Aviastroitel created a second set of molds to respond to the demand and started a second assembly line with a total production capacity of 48 AC-4s per year. In 1997 William Ayd became US distributor under the name ''Russia Sailplanes, Inc.'' Production of the AC-4 was suspended in 2003 when the Russian government changed the requirements for industrial production, making building them  uneconomical. In 2010 Aviastroitel became [[Glider Air Craft]] and production resumed.<ref name=\"glidingsport\" /><ref name=\"GliderAirCraftHist\" />\n\nThe aircraft is made from [[fibreglass]].

In the 14th century, [[Guillaume Tirel]], a [[Court (royal)|court]] [[chef]] known as \"Taillevent\", wrote ''[[Le Viandier]]'', one of the earliest [[recipe]] collections of [[France in the Middle Ages|medieval France]]. In the 17th century, chefs [[Fran\u00e7ois Pierre La Varenne]] and [[Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame]] spearheaded movements that shifted French cooking away from its foreign influences and developed France's own indigenous style. [[French cheese|Cheese]] and [[French wine|wine]] are a major part of the cuisine. They play different roles regionally and nationally, with many variations and ''[[appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e]]'' (AOC) (regulated appellation) laws.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nFrench cuisine was made important in the 20th century by [[Auguste Escoffier]] to become the modern ''[[haute cuisine]]''; Escoffier, however, left out much of the local culinary character to be found in the [[regions of France]] and was considered difficult to execute by home cooks. [[Culinary tourism]] and the ''[[Guide Michelin]]'' helped to acquaint people{{who|date=November 2019}} with the ''[[cuisine bourgeoise]]'' of the urban elites{{dubious|date=November 2019}} and the peasant cuisine of the French countryside starting in the 20th century. [[Gascony|Gascon]] cuisine has also had great influence over the cuisine in the southwest of France. Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated in variations across the country.\n\nKnowledge of French cooking has contributed significantly to Western cuisines. Its criteria are used widely in Western cookery school boards and [[culinary art|culinary education]]. In November 2010, French [[gastronomy]] was added by the [[UNESCO]] to its lists of the world's [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|\"intangible cultural heritage\"]].<ref>[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/world/stories/DN-culture_17int.ART.State.Edition1.b21e71.html Bon app\u00e9tit: Your meal is certified by the UN] Dallas Morning News</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=UNESCO |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/celebrations_healing_techniques_crafts_and_culinary_arts_added_to_the_representative_list_of_the_intangible_cultural_heritage/ |title=Celebrations, healing techniques, crafts and culinary arts added to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage |publisher=UNESCO |date=2010-11-16 |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Middle Ages===\n    [[File:Les Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du duc de Berry Janvier.jpg|thumb|left|[[John, Duke of Berry]] enjoying a grand meal.

On the table to the left of the Duke is a golden [[salt cellar]], or ''nef'', in the shape of a ship; illustration from ''[[Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]'', circa 1410.]]\n\nIn French [[medieval cuisine]], banquets were common among the [[aristocracy]]. Multiple courses would be prepared, but served in a style called ''service en confusion'', or all at once. Food was generally eaten by hand, meats being sliced off in large pieces held between the thumb and two fingers. The sauces were highly seasoned and thick, and heavily flavored mustards were used. Pies were a common banquet item, with the crust serving primarily as a container, rather than as food itself, and it was not until the very end of the [[Late Middle Ages]] that the [[shortcrust pastry|shortcrust]] pie was developed. Meals often ended with an ''issue de table'', which later changed into the modern dessert, and typically consisted of ''[[drag\u00e9e]]s'' (in the Middle Ages, meaning spiced lumps of hardened sugar or honey), aged cheese and spiced wine, such as [[hypocras]].<ref name=\"Wheaton\">{{Cite book | last = Wheaton | first = Barbara Ketcham | title = Savoring the Past: The French Kitchen and Table from 1300 to 1789 | publisher = First Touchstone | year = 1996 | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-684-81857-3 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_d5z8 }}</ref>{{rp|1\u20137}}\n\nThe ingredients of the time varied greatly according to the seasons and the church calendar, and many items were preserved with salt, spices, honey, and other preservatives. Late spring, summer, and autumn afforded abundance, while winter meals were more sparse. Livestock were slaughtered at the beginning of winter. Beef was often salted, while pork was salted and smoked. Bacon and sausages would be smoked in the chimney, while the tongue and hams were [[brine]]d and dried.  Cucumbers were brined as well, while greens would be packed in jars with salt. Fruits, nuts and root vegetables would be boiled in honey for preservation. Whale, dolphin and porpoise were considered fish, so during [[Lent]], the salted meats of these sea mammals were eaten.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|9\u201312}}\n\nArtificial freshwater ponds (often called ''stews'') held [[carp]], [[pike (fish)|pike]], [[tench]], [[bream]], [[Eel (food)|eel]], and other fish. Poultry was kept in special yards, with pigeon and [[Squab (food)|squab]] being reserved for the elite. Game was highly prized, but very rare, and included [[venison]], [[wild boar]], hare, rabbit, and birds. Kitchen gardens provided herbs, including some, such as [[tansy]], [[rue]], [[Mentha pulegium|pennyroyal]], and [[hyssop]], which are rarely used today. Spices were treasured and very expensive at that time \u2013 they included pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and [[mace (spice)|mace]]. Some spices used then, but no longer today in French cuisine are [[cubeb]]s, long pepper (both from vines similar to black pepper), [[grains of paradise]], and [[galangal|galengale]]. Sweet-sour flavors were commonly added to dishes with vinegars and ''[[verjus]]'' combined with sugar (for the affluent) or honey. A common form of food preparation was to finely cook, pound and strain mixtures into fine pastes and mushes, something believed to be beneficial to make use of nutrients.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|13\u201315}}\n\nVisual display was prized. Brilliant colors were obtained by the addition of, for example, juices from spinach and the green part of [[leek]]s. Yellow came from [[saffron]] or egg yolk, while red came from [[sunflower]], and purple came from ''[[Crozophora tinctoria]]'' or ''[[Heliotropium europaeum]]''. Gold and [[Metal leaf|silver leaf]] were placed on food surfaces and brushed with egg whites. Elaborate and showy dishes were the result, such as ''tourte parmerienne'' which was a pastry dish made to look like a castle with chicken-drumstick turrets coated with [[gold leaf]]. One of the grandest showpieces of the time was roast [[swan]] or [[peafowl|peacock]] sewn back into its skin with feathers intact, the feet and beak being [[gilded]]. Since both birds are stringy, and taste unpleasant, the skin and feathers could be kept and filled with the cooked, minced and seasoned flesh of tastier birds, like goose or chicken.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|15\u201316}}\n\nThe most well known French chef of the Middle Ages was [[Guillaume Tirel]], also known as Taillevent. Taillevent worked in numerous royal kitchens during the 14th century. His first position was as a kitchen boy in 1326. He was chef to [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]], then the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] who was son of [[John II of France|John II]]. The Dauphin became King [[Charles V of France]] in 1364, with Taillevent as his chief cook. His career spanned sixty-six years, and upon his death he was buried in grand style between his two wives. His tombstone represents him in armor, holding a shield with three cooking pots, ''marmites'', on it.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|18\u201321}}\n\n===Ancien R\u00e9gime===\n\nParis was the central hub of culture and economic activity, and as such, the most highly skilled culinary craftsmen were to be found there. Markets in Paris such as ''[[Les Halles]]'', ''la M\u00e9gisserie'', those found along ''[[Rue Mouffetard]]'', and similar smaller versions in other cities were very important to the distribution of food. Those that gave French produce its characteristic identity were regulated by the [[guild]] system, which developed in the [[Middle Ages]]. In Paris, the guilds were regulated by city government as well as by the French crown. A guild restricted those in a given branch of the culinary industry to operate only within that field.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|71\u201372}}\n\nThere were two groups of guilds \u2013 first, those that supplied the raw materials; butchers, fishmongers, grain merchants, and gardeners. The second group were those that supplied prepared foods; bakers, [[pastry chef|pastry cook]]s, sauce makers, poulterers, and [[caterer]]s. There were also guilds that offered both raw materials and prepared food, such as the ''[[charcuterie|charcutiers]]'' and ''r\u00f4tisseurs'' (purveyors of roasted meat dishes). They would supply cooked meat pies and dishes as well as raw meat and poultry. This caused issues with butchers and poulterers, who sold the same raw materials.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|72\u201373}}  The guilds served as a training ground for those within the industry. The degrees of assistant-cook, full-fledged cook and master chef were conferred. Those who reached the level of master chef were of considerable rank in their individual industry, and enjoyed a high level of income as well as economic and job security. At times, those in the royal kitchens did fall under the [[guild]] hierarchy, but it was necessary to find them a parallel appointment based on their skills after leaving the service of the royal kitchens. This was not uncommon as the Paris cooks' guild regulations allowed for this movement.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|73}}\n\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, French cuisine assimilated many new food items from the [[New World]]. Although they were slow to be adopted, records of banquets show [[Catherine de' Medici]] (1519\u20131589?) serving sixty-six turkeys at one dinner.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|81}}  The dish called [[cassoulet]] has its roots in the New World discovery of [[haricot bean]]s, which are central to the dish's creation, but had not existed outside of the New World until its exploration by [[Christopher Columbus]].<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|85}}\n\n''Haute cuisine'' ({{IPA-fr|ot k\u0265izin|pron}}, \"high cuisine\") has foundations during the 17th century with a chef named [[Fran\u00e7ois Pierre La Varenne|La Varenne]]. As author of works such as ''Le Cuisinier fran\u00e7ois'', he is credited with publishing the first true French cookbook. His book includes the earliest known reference to [[roux]] using pork fat. The book contained two sections, one for meat days, and one for [[fasting]]. His recipes marked a change from the style of cookery known in the Middle Ages, to new techniques aimed at creating somewhat lighter dishes, and more modest presentations of pies as individual pastries and turnovers. La Varenne also published a book on pastry in 1667 entitled ''Le Parfait confitvrier'' (republished as ''Le Confiturier fran\u00e7ois'') which similarly updated and codified the emerging ''haute cuisine'' standards for desserts and pastries.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|114\u2013120}}\n\nChef [[Fran\u00e7ois Massialot]] wrote ''Le Cuisinier ro\u00efal et bourgeois'' in 1691, during the reign of [[Louis XIV]]. The book contains menus served to the royal courts in 1690. Massialot worked mostly as a freelance cook, and was not employed by any particular household. Massialot and many other royal cooks received special privileges by association with the French royalty. They were not subject to the regulation of the guilds; therefore, they could cater weddings and banquets without restriction. His book is the first to list recipes alphabetically, perhaps a forerunner of the first culinary dictionary. It is in this book that a [[marinade]] is first seen in print, with one type for poultry and feathered game, while a second is for fish and shellfish. No quantities are listed in the recipes, which suggests that Massialot was writing for trained cooks.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|149\u2013154}}\n\nThe successive updates of ''Le Cuisinier ro\u00efal et bourgeois'' include important refinements such as adding a glass of wine to [[stock (food)|fish stock]]. Definitions were also added to the 1703 edition. The 1712 edition, retitled ''Le Nouveau cuisinier royal et bourgeois'', was increased to two volumes, and was written in a more elaborate style with extensive explanations of technique. Additional smaller preparations are included in this edition as well, leading to lighter preparations, and adding a third course to the meal. [[Ragout]], a stew still central to French cookery, makes its first appearance as a single dish in this edition as well; prior to that, it was listed as a garnish.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|155}}\n\n===Late 18th century \u2013  early 19th century===\n\n[[File:Marie Leszczy\u0144ska, reine de France (original copy) by Jean-Marc Nattier.png|thumb|The [[Poland|Polish]] wife of [[Louis XV of France]], Queen [[Marie Leszczy\u0144ska]], influenced French cuisine.]]\n[[File:M-A-Careme.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame]]]]\nShortly before the French Revolution, dishes like [[bouch\u00e9es \u00e0 la Reine]] gained prominence. Essentially royal cuisine produced by the royal household, this is a chicken-based recipe served on [[vol-au-vent]] created under the influence of Queen [[Marie Leszczy\u0144ska]], the Polish-born wife of [[Louis XV]]. This recipe is still popular today, as are other recipes from Queen Marie Leszczy\u0144ska like [[consomm\u00e9 \u00e0 la Reine]] and [[filet d'aloyau brais\u00e9 \u00e0 la royale]]. Queen Marie is also credited with introducing [[lentil]]s to the French diet and [[Polonaise (sauce)|Polonaise garnishing]].\n\nThe [[French Revolution]] was integral to the expansion of French cuisine, because it abolished the guild system. This meant anyone could now produce and sell any culinary item he wished. Bread was a significant food source among peasants and the working class in the late 18th century, with many of the nation's people being dependent on it. In French provinces, bread was often consumed three times a day by the people of France.<ref name=Brace>{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1843902|jstor=1843902|title=The Problem of Bread and the French Revolution at Bordeaux|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=51|issue=4|pages=649\u2013667|year=1946|last1=Brace|first1=Richard Munthe}}</ref> According to Brace, bread was referred to as the basic dietary item for the masses, and it was also used as a foundation for soup.  In fact, bread was so important that harvest, interruption of commerce by wars, heavy flour exploration, and prices and supply were all watched and controlled by the French Government. Among the underprivileged, constant fear of famine was always prevalent. From 1725 to 1789, there was fourteen years of bad yields to blame for low grain supply. In Bordeaux, during 1708\u20131789, thirty-three bad harvests occurred.<ref name=Brace/>\n\n[[Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame]] was born in 1784, five years before the [[French Revolution|Revolution]]. He spent his younger years working at a ''[[Pastry|p\u00e2tisserie]]'' until he was discovered by [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord]], who would later cook for [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. Prior to his employment with Talleyrand, Car\u00eame had become known for his ''[[Pi\u00e8ce mont\u00e9e|pi\u00e8ces mont\u00e9es]]'', which were extravagant constructions of pastry and sugar architecture.<ref name=\"Mennell\">{{Cite book | last = Mennell | first = Stephen | title = All Manners of Food: eating and taste in England and France from the Middle Ages to the present, 2nd ed. | publisher=University of Illinois Press | year = 1996 | location = Chicago | isbn = 978-0-252-06490-6}}</ref>{{rp|144\u2013145}}\n\nMore important to Car\u00eame's career was his contribution to the refinement of French cuisine. The basis for his style of cooking was his sauces, which he named [[mother sauce]]s. Often referred to as [[fond]]s, meaning \"foundations\", these base sauces, ''[[espagnole]]'', ''[[velout\u00e9]]'', and ''[[b\u00e9chamel]]'', are still known today. Each of these sauces was made in large quantities in his kitchen, then formed the basis of multiple derivatives. Car\u00eame had over one hundred sauces in his repertoire. In his writings, souffl\u00e9s appear for the first time. Although many of his preparations today seem extravagant, he simplified and codified an even more complex cuisine that existed beforehand. Central to his codification of the cuisine were ''Le Ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel fran\u00e7ais'' (1822), ''Le Cuisinier parisien'' (1828) and ''L'Art de la cuisine fran\u00e7aise au dix-neuvi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle'' (1833\u20135).<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|144\u2013148}}\n\n===Late 19th century \u2013 early 20th century===\n[[File:Auguste Escoffier 01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Georges Auguste Escoffier]]]]\n[[Georges Auguste Escoffier]] is commonly acknowledged as the central figure to the modernization of ''haute cuisine'' and organizing what would become the national cuisine of France. His influence began with the rise of some of the great hotels in Europe and America during the 1880s \u2013 1890s. The [[Savoy Hotel]] managed by [[C\u00e9sar Ritz]] was an early hotel in which Escoffier worked, but much of his influence came during his management of the kitchens in the Carlton from 1898 until 1921. He created a system of \"parties\" called the [[brigade system]], which separated the professional kitchen into five separate stations.\n\nThese five stations included the \"[[garde manger]]\" that prepared cold dishes; the \"entremettier\" prepared starches and vegetables, the \"r\u00f4tisseur\" prepared roasts, grilled and fried dishes; the \"[[saucier]]\" prepared sauces and soups; and the \"p\u00e2tissier\" prepared all pastry and desserts items. This system meant that instead of one person preparing a dish on one's own, now multiple cooks would prepare the different components for the dish. An example used is \"oeufs au plat Meyerbeer\", the prior system would take up to fifteen minutes to prepare the dish, while in the new system, the eggs would be prepared by the entremettier, kidney grilled by the r\u00f4tisseur, truffle sauce made by the saucier and thus the dish could be prepared in a shorter time and served quickly in the popular restaurants.<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|157\u2013159}}\n\nEscoffier also simplified and organized the modern menu and structure of the meal. He published a series of articles in professional journals which outlined the sequence, and he finally published his ''Livre des menus'' in 1912. This type of service embraced the [[service \u00e0 la russe]] (serving meals in separate courses on individual plates), which F\u00e9lix Urbain Dubois had made popular in the 1860s. Escoffier's largest contribution was the publication of ''[[Le Guide Culinaire]]'' in 1903, which established the fundamentals of French cookery. The book was a collaboration with Phil\u00e9as Gilbert, E. Fetu, A. Suzanne, B. Reboul, Ch. Dietrich, A. Caillat and others. The significance of this is to illustrate the universal acceptance by multiple high-profile chefs to this new style of cooking.<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|159\u2013160}}\n\n''Le Guide Culinaire'' deemphasized the use of heavy sauces and leaned toward lighter [[White stock|fumet]]s, which are the essence of flavor taken from fish, meat and vegetables. This style of cooking looked to create garnishes and sauces whose function is to add to the flavor of the dish, rather than mask flavors like the heavy sauces and ornate garnishes of the past. Escoffier took inspiration for his work from personal recipes in addition to recipes from Car\u00eame, Dubois and ideas from Taillevent's ''Viander'', which had a modern version published in 1897. A second source for recipes came from existing peasant dishes that were translated into the refined techniques of ''haute cuisine''.\n\nExpensive ingredients would replace the common ingredients, making the dishes much less humble. The third source of recipes was Escoffier himself, who invented many new dishes, such as [[p\u00eache Melba]].<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|160\u2013162}}  Escoffier updated ''Le Guide Culinaire'' four times during his lifetime, noting in the foreword to the book's first edition that even with its 5,000 recipes, the book should not be considered an \"exhaustive\" text, and that even if it were at the point when he wrote the book, \"it would no longer be so tomorrow, because progress marches on each day.\"<ref>{{Cite book | last = Escoffier | first = Georges Auguste | title = Escoffier: The Complete Guide to the Art of Modern Cookery | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | year = 2002 | location = New York | pages = Foreword | isbn = 978-0-471-29016-2}}</ref>\n\n===Mid-20th century \u2013 late 20th century===\n[[File:Paul Bocuse.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Bocuse]]]]\nThe 1960s brought about innovative thought to the French cuisine, especially because of the contribution of Portuguese immigrants who had come to the country fleeing the forced drafting to the [[Portuguese Colonial War|Colonial Wars]] Portugal was fighting in Africa. Many new dishes were introduced, as well as techniques.\n\nThis period is also marked by the appearance of the [[nouvelle cuisine]]. The term \"nouvelle cuisine\" has been used many times in the history of French cuisine which emphasized the freshness, lightness and clarity of flavor and inspired by new movements in world cuisine. In the 1740s, [[Menon (cookbook author)|Menon]] first used the term, but the cooking of [[Vincent La Chapelle]] and Fran\u00e7ois Marin was also considered modern. In the 1960s, [[Henri Gault]] and [[Christian Millau]] revived it to describe the cooking of [[Paul Bocuse]], [[Jean Troisgros|Jean]] and [[Pierre Troisgros]], [[Michel Gu\u00e9rard]], Roger Verg\u00e9 and [[Raymond Oliver]].<ref>''Joyeuse encyclop\u00e9die anecdotique de la gastronomie'', [[Michel Ferracci-Porri]] and Maryline Paoli, Preface by Christian Millau, Ed. Normant 2012, France {{ISBN|978-2-915685-55-8}}</ref> These chefs were working toward rebelling against the \"orthodoxy\" of [[Escoffier]]'s cuisine. Some of the chefs were students of [[Fernand Point]] at the ''[[La Pyramide|Pyramide]]'' in [[Vienne]], and had left to open their own restaurants. Gault and Millau \"discovered the formula\" contained in ten characteristics of this new style of cooking.<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|163\u2013164}}\n\nThe first characteristic was a rejection of excessive complication in cooking. Second, the cooking times for most fish, seafood, game birds, veal, green vegetables and p\u00e2t\u00e9s was greatly reduced in an attempt to preserve the natural flavors. Steaming was an important trend from this characteristic. The third characteristic was that the cuisine was made with the freshest possible ingredients. Fourth, large menus were abandoned in favor of shorter menus. Fifth, strong marinades for meat and game ceased to be used. Sixth, they stopped using heavy sauces such as [[espagnole]] and b\u00e9chamel thickened with flour based \"roux\", in favor of seasoning their dishes with fresh herbs, quality butter, lemon juice, and vinegar. Seventh, they used regional dishes for inspiration instead of ''haute cuisine'' dishes. Eighth, new techniques were embraced and modern equipment was often used; Bocuse even used microwave ovens. Ninth, the chefs paid close attention to the dietary needs of their guests through their dishes. Tenth and finally, the chefs were extremely inventive and created new combinations and pairings.<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|163\u2013164}}\n\nSome have speculated that a contributor to nouvelle cuisine was World War II when animal protein was in short supply during the German occupation.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Hewitt | first = Nicholas | title = The Cambridge Companion to Modern French Culture | publisher=The Cambridge University Press | year = 2003 | location = Cambridge | pages = 109\u2013110 | isbn = 978-0-521-79465-7}}</ref> By the mid-1980s food writers stated that the style of cuisine had reached exhaustion and many chefs began returning to the ''haute cuisine'' style of cooking, although much of the lighter presentations and new techniques remained.<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|163\u2013164}}\n\n==National cuisine==\n{{Main article|List of French dishes}}\nThere are many dishes that are considered part of French national cuisine today.\n\nA meal often consists of three courses, ''hors d'\u0153uvre'' or ''entr\u00e9e'' (introductory course, sometimes soup), ''plat principal'' (main course), ''fromage'' (cheese course) or ''dessert'', sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert.\n\n;Hors d'\u0153uvre\n\n<gallery perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Terrine de saumon au basilic.JPG|''Basil salmon [[Terrine (food)|terrine]]''\nFile:Lobster bisque.jpg|''[[Bisque (food)|Bisque]]'' is a smooth and creamy French ''[[potage]]''.\nFile:Foie gras en cocotte.jpg|''[[Foie gras]]'' with mustard seeds and green onions in duck ''[[Au jus|jus]]''\nFile:Croque monsieur.jpg|''[[Croque monsieur]]''\n</gallery>\n\n;Plat principal\n\n<gallery perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Pot-au-feu2.jpg|''[[Pot-au-feu]]'' is a ''[[cuisine classique]]'' dish.\nFile:Flickr - cyclonebill - B\u00f8f med pommes frites (1).jpg|''[[Steak frites]]'' is a simple and popular dish.\n</gallery>\n\n;P\u00e2tisserie\n\n<gallery perrow=\"6\">\nFile:Lille Meert2.JPG|Typical French ''[[p\u00e2tisserie]]''\nFile:Mille-feuille 20100916.jpg|''[[Mille-feuille]]''\nFile:Arc-en-ciel comestible.jpg|''[[Macaron]]\nFile:Eclairs at Fauchon in Paris.jpg|''[[\u00c9clair]]\n</gallery>\n\n;Dessert\n\n<gallery perrow=\"7\">\nFile:Creme Brulee.jpeg|''[[Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e]]''\nFile:Chocolate mousse.jpg|''[[Chocolate mousse|Mousse au chocolat]]''\nFile:Cr\u00eape Suzette au Citron.jpg|''[[Cr\u00eape]]\nFile:Ujuvad saarekesed.jpg|''floating island''\n</gallery>\n\n==Regional cuisine==\n[[File:D\u00e9partements+r\u00e9gions (France).svg|thumb|250px|The 22 [[regions of France|regions]] and 96 [[departments of France|departments]] of [[metropolitan France]] include [[Corsica]] (''Corse'', lower right).

This region and in the [[Vend\u00e9e]] is grazing ground for ''Parthenaise'' cattle, while poultry is raised in [[Challans]]. The region of [[Poitou-Charentes]] purportedly produces the best butter and cream in France. [[Cognac (drink)|Cognac]] is also made in the region along the [[Charente River]]. [[Limousin (region)|Limousin]] is home to the [[Limousin (cattle)|Limousin cattle]], as well as sheep. The woodlands offer game and mushrooms. The southern area around [[Brive]] draws its cooking influence from [[P\u00e9rigord]] and [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne]] to produce a robust cuisine.<ref name=\"Domine\" />{{rp|237}}\n\n===Bordeaux, P\u00e9rigord, Gascony, and Basque country===\n{{Main article|Basque cuisine}}\n[[Bordeaux]] is known for its wine, with certain areas offering specialty grapes for wine-making. Fishing is popular in the region for the cuisine, sea fishing in the [[Bay of Biscay]], trapping in the [[Garonne]] and stream fishing in the [[Pyrenees]]. The Pyrenees also support lamb, such as the ''\"Agneau de Pauillac\"'', as well as sheep cheeses. Beef cattle in the region include the ''[[Blonde d'Aquitaine]]'', ''Boeuf de Chalosse'', ''Boeuf Gras de Bazas'', and ''Garonnaise''. Free-range chicken, turkey, pigeon, [[capon]], goose and duck prevail in the region as well.  [[Gascony]] and [[P\u00e9rigord]] cuisines includes ''pat\u00e9s'', ''[[Terrine (food)|terrine]]s'', ''[[confit]]s'' and ''magrets''. This is one of the regions notable for its production of [[foie gras]] or fattened goose or duck liver. The cuisine of the region is often heavy and farm based.  [[Armagnac (drink)|Armagnac]] is also from this region, as are prunes from [[Agen]].<ref name=\"Domine\" />{{rp|259,295}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Confitdecanard.jpg|''[[Confit de canard]]''\nFile:Foie gras with sauternes.jpg|A ''[[Terrine (food)|terrine]]'' of ''[[foie gras]]'' with a bottle of ''[[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]]''\nFile:Truffe coup\u00e9e.jpg|Black P\u00e9rigord ''[[Truffle]]''\nFile:Tourin.jpg|''[[Tourin]]'', a garlic soup from [[Dordogne]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Toulouse, Quercy, and Aveyron===\n[[Gers]], a department of France, is within this region and has poultry, while [[La Montagne Noire]] and [[Lacaune]] area offers hams and dry sausages. White corn is planted heavily in the area both for use in fattening the ducks and geese for foie gras and for the production of ''millas'', a cornmeal porridge.  [[Haricot bean]]s are also grown in this area, which are central to the dish [[cassoulet]]. The finest sausage in France is commonly acknowledged to be the ''saucisse de Toulouse'', which also finds its way into their version of ''cassoulet'' of [[Toulouse]]. The [[Cahors]] area produces a  specialty \"black wine\" as well as [[truffle]]s and mushrooms.\n\nThis region also produces milk-fed lamb. Unpasteurized [[domestic sheep|ewe]]'s milk is used to produce the [[Roquefort]] in [[Aveyron]], while  in [[Laguiole]] is producing unpasteurized cow's milk cheese. The [[Salers]] cattle produce milk for cheese, as well as beef and veal products. The volcanic soils create flinty cheeses and superb lentils. Mineral waters are produced in high volume in this region as well.<ref name=\"Domine\" />{{rp|313}} Cab\u00e9cou cheese is from Rocamadour, a medieval settlement erected directly on a cliff, in the rich countryside of Causses du Quercy.  This area is one of the region's oldest milk producers; it has chalky soil, marked by history and human activity, and is favourable for the raising of goats.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Bol d'aligot.jpg|''[[Aligot]]''\nFile:Roquefort cheese.jpg|''[[Roquefort]]'' cheese\nFile:Bowl of cassoulet.JPG|''[[Cassoulet]]''\n</gallery>\n\n===Roussillon, Languedoc, and C\u00e9vennes===\nRestaurants are popular in the area known as ''[[Le Midi]]''. Oysters come from the Etang de Thau, to be served in the restaurants of Bouzigues, Meze, and [[S\u00e8te]]. Mussels are commonly seen here in addition to fish specialties of S\u00e8te, ''Bourride'', ''Tielles'' and ''Rouille de seiche''. In the [[Languedoc]]  ''jambon cru'', sometimes known as ''jambon de montagne'' is produced. High quality ''[[Roquefort]]'' comes from the ''brebis'' (sheep) on the [[Larzac]] plateau. The [[C\u00e9vennes|Les C\u00e9vennes]] area offers mushrooms, chestnuts, berries, honey, lamb, game, sausages, ''p\u00e2t\u00e9s'' and goat cheeses.  [[Catalan people|Catalan]] influence can be seen in the cuisine here with dishes like brandade made from a pur\u00e9e of dried [[Cod (food)|cod]] wrapped in [[Chard|mangold]] leaves. Snails are plentiful and are prepared in a specific ''Catalan'' style known as a ''cargolade''. [[Wild boar]] can be found in the more mountainous regions of the ''Midi''.<ref name=\"Domine\" />{{rp|349,360}}\n\n===Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur===\n{{See also|Provencal cuisine}}\n\nThe [[Provence]] and [[C\u00f4te d'Azur]] region is rich in quality citrus, vegetables, fruits and herbs; the region is one of the largest suppliers of all these ingredients in France. The region also produces the largest amount of olives, and creates superb olive oil. [[Lavender]] is used in many dishes found in ''Haute Provence''. Other important herbs in the cuisine include [[thyme]], [[Common sage|sage]], [[rosemary]], [[basil]], [[Satureja|savory]], [[fennel]], [[marjoram]], [[tarragon]], [[oregano]], and [[bay leaf]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nice-cooking.com/la-cuisine-nicoise/|title=Nice Cooking|publisher=La Cuisine Ni\u00e7oise|accessdate=2015-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011041615/http://www.nice-cooking.com/la-cuisine-nicoise/|archive-date=11 October 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Honey is a prized ingredient in the region. Seafood proliferates throughout the coastal area and is heavily represented in the cuisine. Goat cheeses, air-dried sausages, lamb, beef, and chicken are popular here. Garlic* and anchovies are used in many of the region's sauces, as in ''Poulet Proven\u00e7al'', which uses white wine, tomatoes, herbs, and sometimes anchovies, and [[Pastis]] is found everywhere that alcohol is served. The cuisine uses a large amount of vegetables for lighter preparations. Truffles are commonly seen in Provence during the winter. [[Thirteen desserts]] in Provence are the traditional Christmas dessert,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.provenceweb.fr/e/mag/terroir/traditions/ukindex.htm |title=Christmas traditions |publisher=Provenceweb.fr |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref> e.g. [[quince cheese]], biscuits, almonds, [[nougat]], apple, and [[fougasse (bread)|fougasse]].\n\nRice is grown in the [[Camargue]], which is the northernmost rice growing area in Europe, with [[Camargue red rice]] being a specialty.<ref name=\"Domine\" />{{rp|387,403,404,410,416}} Anibal Camous, a Marseillais who lived to be 104, maintained that it was by eating garlic daily that he kept his \"youth\" and brilliance.

Cheeses are also produced, with \"[[brocciu]]\" being the most popular. [[Chestnut]]s, growing in the Castagniccia forest, are used to produce flour, which is used in turn to make bread, cakes and [[polenta]]. The forest provides acorns used to feed the pigs and [[boar]]s that provide much of the protein for the island's cuisine. Fresh fish and seafood are common. The island's pork is used to make fine hams, sausage and other unique items including ''[[capicola|coppa]]'' (dried rib cut), ''lonzu'' (dried pork fillet), ''figatella'', ''salumu'' (a dried sausage) ''salcietta'', ''Panzetta'', bacon, ''figatellu'' (smoked and dried liverwurst) and ''prisuttu'' (farmer's ham).  [[Clementine]]s (which hold an AOC designation), lemons, nectarines and figs are grown there. Candied [[citron]] is used in [[nougat]]s, while and the aforementioned brocciu and chestnuts are also used in desserts. Corsica offers a variety of wines and fruit liqueurs, including [[Cap Corse]], [[Patrimonio]], ''C\u00e9dratine'', ''Bonapartine'', ''liqueur de myrte'', ''vins de fruit'', ''Rappu'', and ''[[eau-de-vie]] de ch\u00e2taigne''.<ref name=\"Domine\" />{{rp|435,441,442}}\n\n===French Guiana===\n{{See also|Guianan cuisine|Awara broth}}\n\n'''French Guianan cuisine''' or '''Guianan cuisine''' is a blend of the different cultures that have settled in [[French Guiana]]. Creole and Chinese restaurants are common in major cities such as [[Cayenne]], [[Kourou]] and [[Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni]]. Many indigenous animal species such as [[caiman]] and [[tapir]] are used in spiced stews.\n\n==Specialties by season==\nFrench cuisine varies according to the season. In summer, salads and fruit dishes are popular because they are refreshing and produce is inexpensive and abundant. Greengrocers prefer to sell their fruit and vegetables at lower prices if needed, rather than see them rot in the heat. At the end of summer, mushrooms become plentiful and appear in stews throughout France. The hunting season begins in September and runs through February. Game of all kinds is eaten, often in elaborate dishes that celebrate the success of the hunt. Shellfish are at their peak when winter turns to spring, and oysters appear in restaurants in large quantities.\n\nWith the advent of deep-freeze and the air-conditioned ''[[hypermarch\u00e9]]'', these seasonal variations are less marked than hitherto, but they are still observed, in some cases due to legal restrictions. [[Crayfish (food)|Crayfish]], for example, have a short season and it is illegal to catch them out of season.<ref>Imported crayfish are unrestricted, and many arrive from Pakistan.</ref> Moreover, they do not freeze well.\n\n==Foods and ingredients==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}}\n\nFrench regional cuisines use locally grown vegetables, such as ''pomme de terre'' (potato), ''bl\u00e9'' ([[wheat]]), ''[[Green bean|haricots verts]]'' (a type of French green bean), ''carotte'' (carrot), ''poireau'' ([[leek]]), ''navet'' ([[turnip]]), ''aubergine'' ([[eggplant]]), ''courgette'' ([[zucchini]]), and ''\u00e9chalotte'' ([[shallot]]).\n\nFrench regional cuisines use locally grown fungi, such as ''truffe'' ([[Tuber (genus)|truffle]]), ''champignon de Paris'' ([[button mushroom]]), ''chanterelle ou girolle'' ([[chanterelle]]), ''pleurote (en hu\u00eetre)'' ([[oyster mushroom]]s), and ''c\u00e8pes'' ([[porcini]]).\n\nCommon fruits include oranges, tomatoes, [[tangerine]]s, [[peach]]es, [[apricot]]s, [[apple]]s, [[pear]]s, [[plum]]s, [[Cherry|cherries]], [[Strawberry|strawberries]], [[Raspberry|raspberries]], [[redcurrant]]s, [[Blackberry|blackberries]], [[grape]]s, [[grapefruit]], and [[blackcurrant]]s.\n\nVarieties of meat consumed include ''poulet'' ([[Chicken (food)|chicken]]), ''pigeon'' ([[Squab (food)|squab]]), ''canard'' ([[Duck (food)|duck]]), ''oie'' ([[goose]], the source of [[foie gras]]), ''b\u0153uf'' ([[beef]]), ''veau'' ([[veal]]), ''porc'' ([[pork]]), ''agneau'' ([[Lamb (food)|lamb]]), ''mouton'' ([[mutton]]), ''caille'' ([[quails in cookery|quail]]), ''cheval'' ([[horse meat|horse]]), ''grenouille'' ([[frog legs|frog]]), and ''[[escargot]]'' (snails). Commonly consumed fish and seafood include [[Cod (food)|cod]], [[canned sardines]], [[sardine (food)|fresh sardines]], canned [[tuna]], fresh tuna, [[Salmon (food)|salmon]], [[trout]], [[mussel]]s, [[Herring (food)|herring]], [[oyster]]s, [[Shrimp (food)|shrimp]] and [[calamari]].\n\nEggs are fine quality and often eaten as: [[omelette]]s, hard-boiled with [[mayonnaise]], [[Scrambled eggs|scrambled]] plain, scrambled ''haute cuisine'' preparation, \u0153uf \u00e0 la coque.\n\nHerbs and seasonings vary by region, and include ''[[fleur de sel]]'', ''[[herbes de Provence]]'', [[tarragon]], [[rosemary]], [[marjoram]], [[lavender]], [[thyme]], [[fennel]], and [[Common sage|sage]].\n\nFresh fruit and vegetables, as well as fish and meat, can be purchased either from supermarkets or specialty shops. Street markets are held on certain days in most localities; some towns have a more permanent covered market enclosing food shops, especially meat and fish retailers. These have better shelter than the periodic street markets.\n\n<gallery perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Herbesdeprovence.jpg|''[[Herbes de provence]]''\nFile:Charetveau.jpg|''[[Charolais cattle]]''\nFile:Champignons Agaricus.jpg|''[[Champignon de Paris]]''\nFile:HaricotsVerts2.JPG|''[[Haricot bean|Haricots verts]]''\nFile:France-AOC Piment d'Espelette-2005-08-05.jpg|''[[Espelette pepper|Piments d'Espelette]]''\nFile:Fleur de sel2.jpg|''[[Fleur de sel]] de [[Gu\u00e9rande]]''\nFile:Wine grapes03.jpg|''[[Grape|Grappe de raisin]]''\nFile:Bresseh\u00fchner-1.jpg|''[[Poulet de Bresse]]''\nFile:Wheat close-up.JPG|''Bl\u00e9 ([[Wheat]])''\nFile:Truffe noire du P\u00e9rigord.jpg|''[[Black Truffle|Black P\u00e9rigord truffle]]''\n</gallery>\n\n==Structure of meals==\n\n===Breakfast===\n[[File:Cafe con leche y cruas\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|right|[[Coffee|Caf\u00e9]] with a [[croissant]] for breakfast]]\n\n''Le petit d\u00e9jeuner'' (breakfast) is traditionally a quick meal consisting of ''tartines'' (slices) of French bread with butter and honey or jam (sometimes [[brioche]]), along with caf\u00e9 au lait (also called \"caf\u00e9 cr\u00e8me\"), or black coffee, or tea<ref>{{cite book|title=Larousse Gastronomique|year=2009|publisher=Clarkson Potter|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-46491-0|page=780}}</ref> and rarely hot chicory. Children often drink [[hot chocolate]] in bowls or cups along with their breakfasts. ''[[Croissants]]'', ''[[pain aux raisins]]'' or ''[[pain au chocolat]]'' (also named ''chocolatine'' in the south of France) are mostly included as a weekend treat. Breakfast of some kind is always served in caf\u00e9s opening early in the day.\n\nThere are also savoury dishes for breakfast. An example is \"le petit d\u00e9jeuner gaulois\" or \"petit d\u00e9jeuner fermier\" with the famous long narrow bread slices with soft white cheese topped or boiled ham, called ''mouillettes'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/mouillette/52900|title=D\u00e9finitions : mouillette - Dictionnaire de fran\u00e7ais Larousse|first=\u00c9ditions|last=Larousse|website=www.larousse.fr|accessdate=6 July 2017}}</ref> which is dipped in a soft-boiled egg and some fruit juice and hot drink.\n\nAnother variation called \"le petit d\u00e9jeuner chasseur\", meant to be very hearty, is served with p\u00e2t\u00e9 and other charcuterie products. A more classy version is called \"le petit d\u00e9jeuner du voyageur\", where delicatessens serve gizzard, bacon, salmon, omelet, or croque-monsieur, with or without soft-boiled egg and always with the traditional coffee/tea/chocolate along fruits or fruit juice. When the egg is cooked sunny-side over the croque-monsieur, it is called a croque-madame.\n\nIn ''Germinal'' and other novels, \u00c9mile Zola also reported the ''briquet'': two long bread slices stuffed with butter, cheese and or ham. It can be eaten as a standing/walking breakfast, or meant as a \"second\" one before lunch.\n\nIn the movie ''[[Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis]]'', Philippe Abrams ([[Kad Merad]]) and Antoine Bailleul ([[Dany Boon]]) share together countless breakfasts consisting of ''tartines de Maroilles'' (a rather strong cheese) along with their hot chicory.\n\n===Lunch===\n''Le d\u00e9jeuner'' (lunch) is a two-hour mid-day meal or a one-hour lunch break. In some smaller towns and in the south of France, the two-hour lunch may still be customary. Sunday lunches are often longer and are taken with the family.<ref name=\"Steele\"/> Restaurants normally open for lunch at noon and close at 2:30&nbsp;pm. Some restaurants are closed on Monday during lunch hours.<ref name=\"Fodors\">{{Cite book | last = Fodor's | title = See It. France. 2nd ed. | publisher=Fodor's Travel Publications | year = 2006 | location = New York | isbn = }}</ref>\n\nIn large [[List of communes in France with over 20,000 inhabitants (1999 census)|cities]], a majority of working people and [[List of colleges and universities in France|students]] eat their lunch at a corporate or school cafeteria, which normally serves complete meals as described above; it is not usual for students to bring their own lunch to eat. For companies that do not operate a cafeteria, it is mandatory for [[white-collar worker]]s to be given lunch vouchers as part of their employee benefits. These can be used in most restaurants, supermarkets and ''[[traiteur (culinary profession)|traiteurs]]''; however, workers having lunch in this way typically do not eat all three courses of a traditional lunch due to price and time constraints. In smaller cities and towns, some working people leave their workplaces to return home for lunch. Also, an alternative, especially among [[blue-collar worker]]s, is eating sandwiches followed by a dessert; both dishes can be found ready-made at bakeries and supermarkets at budget prices.\n\n===Dinner===\n''Le d\u00eener'' (dinner) often consists of three [[full course dinner|courses]], ''[[hors d'\u0153uvre]]'' or ''[[entr\u00e9e]]'' (appetizers or introductory course, sometimes soup), ''plat principal'' (main course), and a cheese course or dessert, sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert. Yogurt may replace the cheese course, while a simple dessert would be fresh fruit. The meal is often accompanied by bread, [[French wine|wine]] and [[mineral water]]. Most of the time the bread would be a baguette which is very common in France and is made almost every day. Main meat courses are often served with vegetables, along with potatoes, rice or pasta.<ref name=\"Steele\">{{Cite book | last = Steele | first = Ross | title = The French Way, 2nd ed. | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year = 2001  | location = New York | isbn = }}</ref>{{rp|82}} Restaurants often open at 7:30&nbsp;pm for dinner, and stop taking orders between the hours of 10:00&nbsp;pm and 11:00&nbsp;pm. Some restaurants close for dinner on Sundays.<ref name=\"Fodors\" />{{rp|342}}\n\n==Beverages and drinks==\nIn French cuisine, beverages that precede a meal are called [[ap\u00e9ritif]]s (literally: ''that opens the appetite''), and can be served with [[amuse-bouche]]s (literally: ''mouth amuser''). Those that end it are called [[digestif]]s.\n\n;Ap\u00e9ritifs\n\nThe ap\u00e9ritif varies from region to region: [[Pastis]] is popular in the south of France, [[Cr\u00e9mant d'Alsace]] in the eastern region. [[Champagne]] can also be served. [[Kir (cocktail)|Kir]], also called ''Blanc-cassis'', is a common and popular ap\u00e9ritif-cocktail made with a measure of [[cr\u00e8me de cassis]] (blackcurrant liqueur) topped up with [[white wine]]. The phrase ''Kir Royal'' is used when white wine is replaced with a ''Champagne'' wine. A simple glass of red wine, such as [[Beaujolais nouveau]], can also be presented as an ap\u00e9ritif, accompanied by [[amuse-bouche]]s. Some ap\u00e9ritifs can be [[fortified wine]]s with added herbs, such as [[cinchona]], [[gentian]] and [[vermouth]]. Trade names that sell well include [[Suze (drink)|Suze]] (the classic gentiane), [[Byrrh]], [[Dubonnet]], and [[Noilly Prat]].\n\n;Digestifs\n\nDigestifs are traditionally stronger, and include [[Cognac (brandy)|Cognac]], [[Armagnac (brandy)|Armagnac]], [[Calvados (brandy)|Calvados]], [[Eau de vie]] and fruit alcohols.\n\n==Christmas==\nA typical French Christmas dish is turkey with chestnuts. Other common dishes are smoked salmon, oysters, caviar and ''foie gras''. The Yule log is a very French tradition during Christmas. Chocolate and cakes also occupy a prominent place for Christmas in France. This cuisine is normally accompanied by Champagne. Tradition says that thirteen desserts complete the Christmas meal in reference to the twelve apostles and Christ.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cheznoscousins.com/2014/12/30/10-traditions-noel-francaises/|title=10 traditions de No\u00ebl fran\u00e7aises - Cheznoscousins.com|date=30 December 2014|accessdate=6 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009113740/http://www.cheznoscousins.com/2014/12/30/10-traditions-noel-francaises/|archive-date=9 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.joyeux-noel.com/noeldanslemonde.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009134140/http://www.joyeux-noel.com/noeldanslemonde.html |archivedate=9 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[http://www.ambafrance-at.org/Noel-le-Nouvel-An-et-la-Fete-des-Rois ]{{dead link|date=July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://referat.clopotel.ro/Les_fetes_de_Noel_en_France-14079.html|title=LES FETES DE NOEL EN FRANCE|website=referat.clopotel.ro|accessdate=6 July 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:B\u00fbche de No\u00ebl chocolat framboise maison.jpg|thumb|Yule log, a French Christmas tradition]]\n\n==Food establishments==\n[[File:Cooks 050918 154402.jpg|thumb|Cooks at work]]\n\n===History{{Anchor|History of restaurants}}===\nThe modern restaurant has its origins in French culture. Prior to the late 18th century, diners who wished to \"dine out\" would visit their local [[guild]] member's kitchen and have their meal prepared for them. However, guild members were limited to producing whatever their guild registry delegated to them.<ref name=\"Spang\">{{Cite book | last = Spang | first = Rebecca L. | title = The Invention of the Restaurant, 2nd Ed. | publisher=Harvard University Press | year = 2001 | location =  | isbn = 978-0-674-00685-0}}</ref>{{rp|8\u201310}} These guild members offered food in their own homes to steady clientele that appeared day-to-day but at set times. The guest would be offered the meal [[table d'h\u00f4te]], which is a meal offered at a set price with very little choice of dishes, sometimes none at all.<ref name=\"Spang\" />{{rp|30\u201331}}\n\nThe first steps toward the modern restaurant were locations that offered ''restorative'' [[Bouillon (broth)|bouillons]], or ''restaurants'' \u2013 these words being the origin of the name \"restaurant\". This step took place during the 1760s\u20131770s. These locations were open at all times of the day, featuring ornate tableware and reasonable prices. These locations were meant more as meal replacements for those who had \"lost their appetites and suffered from jaded palates and weak chests.\"<ref name=\"Spang\" />{{rp|34\u201335}}\n\nIn 1782 Antoine Beauvilliers, [[pastry chef]] to the future [[Louis XVIII]], opened one of the most popular restaurants of the time \u2013 the ''Grande Taverne de Londres'' \u2013 in the arcades of the [[Palais-Royal]]. Other restaurants were opened by chefs of the time who were leaving the failing [[Kings of France|monarchy of France]], in the period leading up to the [[French Revolution]]. It was these restaurants that expanded upon the limited menus of decades prior, and led to the full restaurants that were completely legalized with the advent of the French Revolution and abolition of the guilds. This and the substantial discretionary income of the [[French Directory]]'s ''[[nouveau riche]]'' helped keep these new restaurants in business.<ref name=\"Spang\" />{{rp|140\u2013144}}\n\n[[File:Train bleu 05.jpg|thumb|Restaurant ''Le Train Bleu'', in Paris]]\n[[File:Bouchon leTablier.jpg|thumb|A [[bouchon]], ''Le tablier'' (the apron), in Vieux Lyon]]\n[[File:Caf\u00e9 de Flore.jpg|thumb|''Caf\u00e9 de Flore'', in Paris]]\n[[File:Lille - Estaminet 'T Rijsel - 20190423 (1).jpg|thumb|An estaminet in Lille]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Categories\n!English\n!French\n!Description\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|colspan=2|[[Restaurant]]\n|More than 5,000 in Paris alone, with varying levels of prices and menus.

In the 14th century, [[Guillaume Tirel]], a [[Court (royal)|court]] [[chef]] known as \"Taillevent\", wrote ''[[Le Viandier]]'', one of the earliest [[recipe]] collections of [[France in the Middle Ages|medieval France]]. In the 17th century, chefs [[Fran\u00e7ois Pierre La Varenne]] and [[Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame]] spearheaded movements that shifted French cooking away from its foreign influences and developed France's own indigenous style. [[French cheese|Cheese]] and [[French wine|wine]] are a major part of the cuisine. They play different roles regionally and nationally, with many variations and ''[[appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e]]'' (AOC) (regulated appellation) laws.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nFrench cuisine was made important in the 20th century by [[Auguste Escoffier]] to become the modern ''[[haute cuisine]]''; Escoffier, however, left out much of the local culinary character to be found in the [[regions of France]] and was considered difficult to execute by home cooks. [[Culinary tourism]] and the ''[[Guide Michelin]]'' helped to acquaint people{{who|date=November 2019}} with the ''[[cuisine bourgeoise]]'' of the urban elites{{dubious|date=November 2019}} and the peasant cuisine of the French countryside starting in the 20th century. [[Gascony|Gascon]] cuisine has also had great influence over the cuisine in the southwest of France. Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated in variations across the country.\n\nKnowledge of French cooking has contributed significantly to Western cuisines. Its criteria are used widely in Western cookery school boards and [[culinary art|culinary education]]. In November 2010, French [[gastronomy]] was added by the [[UNESCO]] to its lists of the world's [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|\"intangible cultural heritage\"]].<ref>[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/world/stories/DN-culture_17int.ART.State.Edition1.b21e71.html Bon app\u00e9tit: Your meal is certified by the UN] Dallas Morning News</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=UNESCO |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/celebrations_healing_techniques_crafts_and_culinary_arts_added_to_the_representative_list_of_the_intangible_cultural_heritage/ |title=Celebrations, healing techniques, crafts and culinary arts added to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage |publisher=UNESCO |date=2010-11-16 |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Middle Ages===\n    [[File:Les Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du duc de Berry Janvier.jpg|thumb|left|[[John, Duke of Berry]] enjoying a grand meal.

On the table to the left of the Duke is a golden [[salt cellar]], or ''nef'', in the shape of a ship; illustration from ''[[Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]'', circa 1410.]]\n\nIn French [[medieval cuisine]], banquets were common among the [[aristocracy]]. Multiple courses would be prepared, but served in a style called ''service en confusion'', or all at once. Food was generally eaten by hand, meats being sliced off in large pieces held between the thumb and two fingers. The sauces were highly seasoned and thick, and heavily flavored mustards were used. Pies were a common banquet item, with the crust serving primarily as a container, rather than as food itself, and it was not until the very end of the [[Late Middle Ages]] that the [[shortcrust pastry|shortcrust]] pie was developed. Meals often ended with an ''issue de table'', which later changed into the modern dessert, and typically consisted of ''[[drag\u00e9e]]s'' (in the Middle Ages, meaning spiced lumps of hardened sugar or honey), aged cheese and spiced wine, such as [[hypocras]].<ref name=\"Wheaton\">{{Cite book | last = Wheaton | first = Barbara Ketcham | title = Savoring the Past: The French Kitchen and Table from 1300 to 1789 | publisher = First Touchstone | year = 1996 | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-684-81857-3 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_d5z8 }}</ref>{{rp|1\u20137}}\n\nThe ingredients of the time varied greatly according to the seasons and the church calendar, and many items were preserved with salt, spices, honey, and other preservatives. Late spring, summer, and autumn afforded abundance, while winter meals were more sparse. Livestock were slaughtered at the beginning of winter. Beef was often salted, while pork was salted and smoked. Bacon and sausages would be smoked in the chimney, while the tongue and hams were [[brine]]d and dried.  Cucumbers were brined as well, while greens would be packed in jars with salt. Fruits, nuts and root vegetables would be boiled in honey for preservation. Whale, dolphin and porpoise were considered fish, so during [[Lent]], the salted meats of these sea mammals were eaten.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|9\u201312}}\n\nArtificial freshwater ponds (often called ''stews'') held [[carp]], [[pike (fish)|pike]], [[tench]], [[bream]], [[Eel (food)|eel]], and other fish. Poultry was kept in special yards, with pigeon and [[Squab (food)|squab]] being reserved for the elite. Game was highly prized, but very rare, and included [[venison]], [[wild boar]], hare, rabbit, and birds. Kitchen gardens provided herbs, including some, such as [[tansy]], [[rue]], [[Mentha pulegium|pennyroyal]], and [[hyssop]], which are rarely used today. Spices were treasured and very expensive at that time \u2013 they included pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and [[mace (spice)|mace]]. Some spices used then, but no longer today in French cuisine are [[cubeb]]s, long pepper (both from vines similar to black pepper), [[grains of paradise]], and [[galangal|galengale]]. Sweet-sour flavors were commonly added to dishes with vinegars and ''[[verjus]]'' combined with sugar (for the affluent) or honey. A common form of food preparation was to finely cook, pound and strain mixtures into fine pastes and mushes, something believed to be beneficial to make use of nutrients.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|13\u201315}}\n\nVisual display was prized. Brilliant colors were obtained by the addition of, for example, juices from spinach and the green part of [[leek]]s. Yellow came from [[saffron]] or egg yolk, while red came from [[sunflower]], and purple came from ''[[Crozophora tinctoria]]'' or ''[[Heliotropium europaeum]]''. Gold and [[Metal leaf|silver leaf]] were placed on food surfaces and brushed with egg whites. Elaborate and showy dishes were the result, such as ''tourte parmerienne'' which was a pastry dish made to look like a castle with chicken-drumstick turrets coated with [[gold leaf]]. One of the grandest showpieces of the time was roast [[swan]] or [[peafowl|peacock]] sewn back into its skin with feathers intact, the feet and beak being [[gilded]]. Since both birds are stringy, and taste unpleasant, the skin and feathers could be kept and filled with the cooked, minced and seasoned flesh of tastier birds, like goose or chicken.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|15\u201316}}\n\nThe most well known French chef of the Middle Ages was [[Guillaume Tirel]], also known as Taillevent. Taillevent worked in numerous royal kitchens during the 14th century. His first position was as a kitchen boy in 1326. He was chef to [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]], then the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] who was son of [[John II of France|John II]]. The Dauphin became King [[Charles V of France]] in 1364, with Taillevent as his chief cook. His career spanned sixty-six years, and upon his death he was buried in grand style between his two wives. His tombstone represents him in armor, holding a shield with three cooking pots, ''marmites'', on it.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|18\u201321}}\n\n===Ancien R\u00e9gime===\n\nParis was the central hub of culture and economic activity, and as such, the most highly skilled culinary craftsmen were to be found there. Markets in Paris such as ''[[Les Halles]]'', ''la M\u00e9gisserie'', those found along ''[[Rue Mouffetard]]'', and similar smaller versions in other cities were very important to the distribution of food. Those that gave French produce its characteristic identity were regulated by the [[guild]] system, which developed in the [[Middle Ages]]. In Paris, the guilds were regulated by city government as well as by the French crown. A guild restricted those in a given branch of the culinary industry to operate only within that field.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|71\u201372}}\n\nThere were two groups of guilds \u2013 first, those that supplied the raw materials; butchers, fishmongers, grain merchants, and gardeners. The second group were those that supplied prepared foods; bakers, [[pastry chef|pastry cook]]s, sauce makers, poulterers, and [[caterer]]s. There were also guilds that offered both raw materials and prepared food, such as the ''[[charcuterie|charcutiers]]'' and ''r\u00f4tisseurs'' (purveyors of roasted meat dishes). They would supply cooked meat pies and dishes as well as raw meat and poultry. This caused issues with butchers and poulterers, who sold the same raw materials.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|72\u201373}}  The guilds served as a training ground for those within the industry. The degrees of assistant-cook, full-fledged cook and master chef were conferred. Those who reached the level of master chef were of considerable rank in their individual industry, and enjoyed a high level of income as well as economic and job security. At times, those in the royal kitchens did fall under the [[guild]] hierarchy, but it was necessary to find them a parallel appointment based on their skills after leaving the service of the royal kitchens. This was not uncommon as the Paris cooks' guild regulations allowed for this movement.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|73}}\n\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, French cuisine assimilated many new food items from the [[New World]]. Although they were slow to be adopted, records of banquets show [[Catherine de' Medici]] (1519\u20131589?) serving sixty-six turkeys at one dinner.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|81}}  The dish called [[cassoulet]] has its roots in the New World discovery of [[haricot bean]]s, which are central to the dish's creation, but had not existed outside of the New World until its exploration by [[Christopher Columbus]].<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|85}}\n\n''Haute cuisine'' ({{IPA-fr|ot k\u0265izin|pron}}, \"high cuisine\") has foundations during the 17th century with a chef named [[Fran\u00e7ois Pierre La Varenne|La Varenne]]. As author of works such as ''Le Cuisinier fran\u00e7ois'', he is credited with publishing the first true French cookbook. His book includes the earliest known reference to [[roux]] using pork fat. The book contained two sections, one for meat days, and one for [[fasting]]. His recipes marked a change from the style of cookery known in the Middle Ages, to new techniques aimed at creating somewhat lighter dishes, and more modest presentations of pies as individual pastries and turnovers. La Varenne also published a book on pastry in 1667 entitled ''Le Parfait confitvrier'' (republished as ''Le Confiturier fran\u00e7ois'') which similarly updated and codified the emerging ''haute cuisine'' standards for desserts and pastries.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|114\u2013120}}\n\nChef [[Fran\u00e7ois Massialot]] wrote ''Le Cuisinier ro\u00efal et bourgeois'' in 1691, during the reign of [[Louis XIV]]. The book contains menus served to the royal courts in 1690. Massialot worked mostly as a freelance cook, and was not employed by any particular household. Massialot and many other royal cooks received special privileges by association with the French royalty. They were not subject to the regulation of the guilds; therefore, they could cater weddings and banquets without restriction. His book is the first to list recipes alphabetically, perhaps a forerunner of the first culinary dictionary. It is in this book that a [[marinade]] is first seen in print, with one type for poultry and feathered game, while a second is for fish and shellfish. No quantities are listed in the recipes, which suggests that Massialot was writing for trained cooks.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|149\u2013154}}\n\nThe successive updates of ''Le Cuisinier ro\u00efal et bourgeois'' include important refinements such as adding a glass of wine to [[stock (food)|fish stock]]. Definitions were also added to the 1703 edition. The 1712 edition, retitled ''Le Nouveau cuisinier royal et bourgeois'', was increased to two volumes, and was written in a more elaborate style with extensive explanations of technique. Additional smaller preparations are included in this edition as well, leading to lighter preparations, and adding a third course to the meal. [[Ragout]], a stew still central to French cookery, makes its first appearance as a single dish in this edition as well; prior to that, it was listed as a garnish.<ref name=\"Wheaton\" />{{rp|155}}\n\n===Late 18th century \u2013  early 19th century===\n\n[[File:Marie Leszczy\u0144ska, reine de France (original copy) by Jean-Marc Nattier.png|thumb|The [[Poland|Polish]] wife of [[Louis XV of France]], Queen [[Marie Leszczy\u0144ska]], influenced French cuisine.]]\n[[File:M-A-Careme.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame]]]]\nShortly before the French Revolution, dishes like [[bouch\u00e9es \u00e0 la Reine]] gained prominence. Essentially royal cuisine produced by the royal household, this is a chicken-based recipe served on [[vol-au-vent]] created under the influence of Queen [[Marie Leszczy\u0144ska]], the Polish-born wife of [[Louis XV]]. This recipe is still popular today, as are other recipes from Queen Marie Leszczy\u0144ska like [[consomm\u00e9 \u00e0 la Reine]] and [[filet d'aloyau brais\u00e9 \u00e0 la royale]]. Queen Marie is also credited with introducing [[lentil]]s to the French diet and [[Polonaise (sauce)|Polonaise garnishing]].\n\nThe [[French Revolution]] was integral to the expansion of French cuisine, because it abolished the guild system. This meant anyone could now produce and sell any culinary item he wished. Bread was a significant food source among peasants and the working class in the late 18th century, with many of the nation's people being dependent on it. In French provinces, bread was often consumed three times a day by the people of France.<ref name=Brace>{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1843902|jstor=1843902|title=The Problem of Bread and the French Revolution at Bordeaux|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=51|issue=4|pages=649\u2013667|year=1946|last1=Brace|first1=Richard Munthe}}</ref> According to Brace, bread was referred to as the basic dietary item for the masses, and it was also used as a foundation for soup.  In fact, bread was so important that harvest, interruption of commerce by wars, heavy flour exploration, and prices and supply were all watched and controlled by the French Government. Among the underprivileged, constant fear of famine was always prevalent. From 1725 to 1789, there was fourteen years of bad yields to blame for low grain supply. In Bordeaux, during 1708\u20131789, thirty-three bad harvests occurred.<ref name=Brace/>\n\n[[Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame]] was born in 1784, five years before the [[French Revolution|Revolution]]. He spent his younger years working at a ''[[Pastry|p\u00e2tisserie]]'' until he was discovered by [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord]], who would later cook for [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. Prior to his employment with Talleyrand, Car\u00eame had become known for his ''[[Pi\u00e8ce mont\u00e9e|pi\u00e8ces mont\u00e9es]]'', which were extravagant constructions of pastry and sugar architecture.<ref name=\"Mennell\">{{Cite book | last = Mennell | first = Stephen | title = All Manners of Food: eating and taste in England and France from the Middle Ages to the present, 2nd ed. | publisher=University of Illinois Press | year = 1996 | location = Chicago | isbn = 978-0-252-06490-6}}</ref>{{rp|144\u2013145}}\n\nMore important to Car\u00eame's career was his contribution to the refinement of French cuisine. The basis for his style of cooking was his sauces, which he named [[mother sauce]]s. Often referred to as [[fond]]s, meaning \"foundations\", these base sauces, ''[[espagnole]]'', ''[[velout\u00e9]]'', and ''[[b\u00e9chamel]]'', are still known today. Each of these sauces was made in large quantities in his kitchen, then formed the basis of multiple derivatives. Car\u00eame had over one hundred sauces in his repertoire. In his writings, souffl\u00e9s appear for the first time. Although many of his preparations today seem extravagant, he simplified and codified an even more complex cuisine that existed beforehand. Central to his codification of the cuisine were ''Le Ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel fran\u00e7ais'' (1822), ''Le Cuisinier parisien'' (1828) and ''L'Art de la cuisine fran\u00e7aise au dix-neuvi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle'' (1833\u20135).<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|144\u2013148}}\n\n===Late 19th century \u2013 early 20th century===\n[[File:Auguste Escoffier 01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Georges Auguste Escoffier]]]]\n[[Georges Auguste Escoffier]] is commonly acknowledged as the central figure to the modernization of ''haute cuisine'' and organizing what would become the national cuisine of France. His influence began with the rise of some of the great hotels in Europe and America during the 1880s \u2013 1890s. The [[Savoy Hotel]] managed by [[C\u00e9sar Ritz]] was an early hotel in which Escoffier worked, but much of his influence came during his management of the kitchens in the Carlton from 1898 until 1921. He created a system of \"parties\" called the [[brigade system]], which separated the professional kitchen into five separate stations.\n\nThese five stations included the \"[[garde manger]]\" that prepared cold dishes; the \"entremettier\" prepared starches and vegetables, the \"r\u00f4tisseur\" prepared roasts, grilled and fried dishes; the \"[[saucier]]\" prepared sauces and soups; and the \"p\u00e2tissier\" prepared all pastry and desserts items. This system meant that instead of one person preparing a dish on one's own, now multiple cooks would prepare the different components for the dish. An example used is \"oeufs au plat Meyerbeer\", the prior system would take up to fifteen minutes to prepare the dish, while in the new system, the eggs would be prepared by the entremettier, kidney grilled by the r\u00f4tisseur, truffle sauce made by the saucier and thus the dish could be prepared in a shorter time and served quickly in the popular restaurants.<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|157\u2013159}}\n\nEscoffier also simplified and organized the modern menu and structure of the meal. He published a series of articles in professional journals which outlined the sequence, and he finally published his ''Livre des menus'' in 1912. This type of service embraced the [[service \u00e0 la russe]] (serving meals in separate courses on individual plates), which F\u00e9lix Urbain Dubois had made popular in the 1860s. Escoffier's largest contribution was the publication of ''[[Le Guide Culinaire]]'' in 1903, which established the fundamentals of French cookery. The book was a collaboration with Phil\u00e9as Gilbert, E. Fetu, A. Suzanne, B. Reboul, Ch. Dietrich, A. Caillat and others. The significance of this is to illustrate the universal acceptance by multiple high-profile chefs to this new style of cooking.<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|159\u2013160}}\n\n''Le Guide Culinaire'' deemphasized the use of heavy sauces and leaned toward lighter [[White stock|fumet]]s, which are the essence of flavor taken from fish, meat and vegetables. This style of cooking looked to create garnishes and sauces whose function is to add to the flavor of the dish, rather than mask flavors like the heavy sauces and ornate garnishes of the past. Escoffier took inspiration for his work from personal recipes in addition to recipes from Car\u00eame, Dubois and ideas from Taillevent's ''Viander'', which had a modern version published in 1897. A second source for recipes came from existing peasant dishes that were translated into the refined techniques of ''haute cuisine''.\n\nExpensive ingredients would replace the common ingredients, making the dishes much less humble. The third source of recipes was Escoffier himself, who invented many new dishes, such as [[p\u00eache Melba]].<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|160\u2013162}}  Escoffier updated ''Le Guide Culinaire'' four times during his lifetime, noting in the foreword to the book's first edition that even with its 5,000 recipes, the book should not be considered an \"exhaustive\" text, and that even if it were at the point when he wrote the book, \"it would no longer be so tomorrow, because progress marches on each day.\"<ref>{{Cite book | last = Escoffier | first = Georges Auguste | title = Escoffier: The Complete Guide to the Art of Modern Cookery | publisher=John Wiley and Sons | year = 2002 | location = New York | pages = Foreword | isbn = 978-0-471-29016-2}}</ref>\n\n===Mid-20th century \u2013 late 20th century===\n[[File:Paul Bocuse.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Bocuse]]]]\nThe 1960s brought about innovative thought to the French cuisine, especially because of the contribution of Portuguese immigrants who had come to the country fleeing the forced drafting to the [[Portuguese Colonial War|Colonial Wars]] Portugal was fighting in Africa. Many new dishes were introduced, as well as techniques.\n\nThis period is also marked by the appearance of the [[nouvelle cuisine]]. The term \"nouvelle cuisine\" has been used many times in the history of French cuisine which emphasized the freshness, lightness and clarity of flavor and inspired by new movements in world cuisine. In the 1740s, [[Menon (cookbook author)|Menon]] first used the term, but the cooking of [[Vincent La Chapelle]] and Fran\u00e7ois Marin was also considered modern. In the 1960s, [[Henri Gault]] and [[Christian Millau]] revived it to describe the cooking of [[Paul Bocuse]], [[Jean Troisgros|Jean]] and [[Pierre Troisgros]], [[Michel Gu\u00e9rard]], Roger Verg\u00e9 and [[Raymond Oliver]].<ref>''Joyeuse encyclop\u00e9die anecdotique de la gastronomie'', [[Michel Ferracci-Porri]] and Maryline Paoli, Preface by Christian Millau, Ed. Normant 2012, France {{ISBN|978-2-915685-55-8}}</ref> These chefs were working toward rebelling against the \"orthodoxy\" of [[Escoffier]]'s cuisine. Some of the chefs were students of [[Fernand Point]] at the ''[[La Pyramide|Pyramide]]'' in [[Vienne]], and had left to open their own restaurants. Gault and Millau \"discovered the formula\" contained in ten characteristics of this new style of cooking.<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|163\u2013164}}\n\nThe first characteristic was a rejection of excessive complication in cooking. Second, the cooking times for most fish, seafood, game birds, veal, green vegetables and p\u00e2t\u00e9s was greatly reduced in an attempt to preserve the natural flavors. Steaming was an important trend from this characteristic. The third characteristic was that the cuisine was made with the freshest possible ingredients. Fourth, large menus were abandoned in favor of shorter menus. Fifth, strong marinades for meat and game ceased to be used. Sixth, they stopped using heavy sauces such as [[espagnole]] and b\u00e9chamel thickened with flour based \"roux\", in favor of seasoning their dishes with fresh herbs, quality butter, lemon juice, and vinegar. Seventh, they used regional dishes for inspiration instead of ''haute cuisine'' dishes. Eighth, new techniques were embraced and modern equipment was often used; Bocuse even used microwave ovens. Ninth, the chefs paid close attention to the dietary needs of their guests through their dishes. Tenth and finally, the chefs were extremely inventive and created new combinations and pairings.<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|163\u2013164}}\n\nSome have speculated that a contributor to nouvelle cuisine was World War II when animal protein was in short supply during the German occupation.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Hewitt | first = Nicholas | title = The Cambridge Companion to Modern French Culture | publisher=The Cambridge University Press | year = 2003 | location = Cambridge | pages = 109\u2013110 | isbn = 978-0-521-79465-7}}</ref> By the mid-1980s food writers stated that the style of cuisine had reached exhaustion and many chefs began returning to the ''haute cuisine'' style of cooking, although much of the lighter presentations and new techniques remained.<ref name=\"Mennell\" />{{rp|163\u2013164}}\n\n==National cuisine==\n{{Main article|List of French dishes}}\nThere are many dishes that are considered part of French national cuisine today.\n\nA meal often consists of three courses, ''hors d'\u0153uvre'' or ''entr\u00e9e'' (introductory course, sometimes soup), ''plat principal'' (main course), ''fromage'' (cheese course) or ''dessert'', sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert.\n\n;Hors d'\u0153uvre\n\n<gallery perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Terrine de saumon au basilic.JPG|''Basil salmon [[Terrine (food)|terrine]]''\nFile:Lobster bisque.jpg|''[[Bisque (food)|Bisque]]'' is a smooth and creamy French ''[[potage]]''.\nFile:Foie gras en cocotte.jpg|''[[Foie gras]]'' with mustard seeds and green onions in duck ''[[Au jus|jus]]''\nFile:Croque monsieur.jpg|''[[Croque monsieur]]''\n</gallery>\n\n;Plat principal\n\n<gallery perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Pot-au-feu2.jpg|''[[Pot-au-feu]]'' is a ''[[cuisine classique]]'' dish.\nFile:Flickr - cyclonebill - B\u00f8f med pommes frites (1).jpg|''[[Steak frites]]'' is a simple and popular dish.\n</gallery>\n\n;P\u00e2tisserie\n\n<gallery perrow=\"6\">\nFile:Lille Meert2.JPG|Typical French ''[[p\u00e2tisserie]]''\nFile:Mille-feuille 20100916.jpg|''[[Mille-feuille]]''\nFile:Arc-en-ciel comestible.jpg|''[[Macaron]]\nFile:Eclairs at Fauchon in Paris.jpg|''[[\u00c9clair]]\n</gallery>\n\n;Dessert\n\n<gallery perrow=\"7\">\nFile:Creme Brulee.jpeg|''[[Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e]]''\nFile:Chocolate mousse.jpg|''[[Chocolate mousse|Mousse au chocolat]]''\nFile:Cr\u00eape Suzette au Citron.jpg|''[[Cr\u00eape]]\nFile:Ujuvad saarekesed.jpg|''floating island''\n</gallery>\n\n==Regional cuisine==\n[[File:D\u00e9partements+r\u00e9gions (France).svg|thumb|250px|The 22 [[regions of France|regions]] and 96 [[departments of France|departments]] of [[metropolitan France]] include [[Corsica]] (''Corse'', lower right).

This region and in the [[Vend\u00e9e]] is grazing ground for ''Parthenaise'' cattle, while poultry is raised in [[Challans]]. The region of [[Poitou-Charentes]] purportedly produces the best butter and cream in France. [[Cognac (drink)|Cognac]] is also made in the region along the [[Charente River]]. [[Limousin (region)|Limousin]] is home to the [[Limousin (cattle)|Limousin cattle]], as well as sheep. The woodlands offer game and mushrooms. The southern area around [[Brive]] draws its cooking influence from [[P\u00e9rigord]] and [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne]] to produce a robust cuisine.<ref name=\"Domine\" />{{rp|237}}\n\n===Bordeaux, P\u00e9rigord, Gascony, and Basque country===\n{{Main article|Basque cuisine}}\n[[Bordeaux]] is known for its wine, with certain areas offering specialty grapes for wine-making. Fishing is popular in the region for the cuisine, sea fishing in the [[Bay of Biscay]], trapping in the [[Garonne]] and stream fishing in the [[Pyrenees]]. The Pyrenees also support lamb, such as the ''\"Agneau de Pauillac\"'', as well as sheep cheeses. Beef cattle in the region include the ''[[Blonde d'Aquitaine]]'', ''Boeuf de Chalosse'', ''Boeuf Gras de Bazas'', and ''Garonnaise''. Free-range chicken, turkey, pigeon, [[capon]], goose and duck prevail in the region as well.  [[Gascony]] and [[P\u00e9rigord]] cuisines includes ''pat\u00e9s'', ''[[Terrine (food)|terrine]]s'', ''[[confit]]s'' and ''magrets''. This is one of the regions notable for its production of [[foie gras]] or fattened goose or duck liver. The cuisine of the region is often heavy and farm based.  [[Armagnac (drink)|Armagnac]] is also from this region, as are prunes from [[Agen]].<ref name=\"Domine\" />{{rp|259,295}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Confitdecanard.jpg|''[[Confit de canard]]''\nFile:Foie gras with sauternes.jpg|A ''[[Terrine (food)|terrine]]'' of ''[[foie gras]]'' with a bottle of ''[[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]]''\nFile:Truffe coup\u00e9e.jpg|Black P\u00e9rigord ''[[Truffle]]''\nFile:Tourin.jpg|''[[Tourin]]'', a garlic soup from [[Dordogne]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Toulouse, Quercy, and Aveyron===\n[[Gers]], a department of France, is within this region and has poultry, while [[La Montagne Noire]] and [[Lacaune]] area offers hams and dry sausages. White corn is planted heavily in the area both for use in fattening the ducks and geese for foie gras and for the production of ''millas'', a cornmeal porridge.  [[Haricot bean]]s are also grown in this area, which are central to the dish [[cassoulet]]. The finest sausage in France is commonly acknowledged to be the ''saucisse de Toulouse'', which also finds its way into their version of ''cassoulet'' of [[Toulouse]]. The [[Cahors]] area produces a  specialty \"black wine\" as well as [[truffle]]s and mushrooms.\n\nThis region also produces milk-fed lamb. Unpasteurized [[domestic sheep|ewe]]'s milk is used to produce the [[Roquefort]] in [[Aveyron]], while  in [[Laguiole]] is producing unpasteurized cow's milk cheese. The [[Salers]] cattle produce milk for cheese, as well as beef and veal products. The volcanic soils create flinty cheeses and superb lentils. Mineral waters are produced in high volume in this region as well.<ref name=\"Domine\" />{{rp|313}} Cab\u00e9cou cheese is from Rocamadour, a medieval settlement erected directly on a cliff, in the rich countryside of Causses du Quercy.  This area is one of the region's oldest milk producers; it has chalky soil, marked by history and human activity, and is favourable for the raising of goats.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Bol d'aligot.jpg|''[[Aligot]]''\nFile:Roquefort cheese.jpg|''[[Roquefort]]'' cheese\nFile:Bowl of cassoulet.JPG|''[[Cassoulet]]''\n</gallery>\n\n===Roussillon, Languedoc, and C\u00e9vennes===\nRestaurants are popular in the area known as ''[[Le Midi]]''. Oysters come from the Etang de Thau, to be served in the restaurants of Bouzigues, Meze, and [[S\u00e8te]]. Mussels are commonly seen here in addition to fish specialties of S\u00e8te, ''Bourride'', ''Tielles'' and ''Rouille de seiche''. In the [[Languedoc]]  ''jambon cru'', sometimes known as ''jambon de montagne'' is produced. High quality ''[[Roquefort]]'' comes from the ''brebis'' (sheep) on the [[Larzac]] plateau. The [[C\u00e9vennes|Les C\u00e9vennes]] area offers mushrooms, chestnuts, berries, honey, lamb, game, sausages, ''p\u00e2t\u00e9s'' and goat cheeses.  [[Catalan people|Catalan]] influence can be seen in the cuisine here with dishes like brandade made from a pur\u00e9e of dried [[Cod (food)|cod]] wrapped in [[Chard|mangold]] leaves. Snails are plentiful and are prepared in a specific ''Catalan'' style known as a ''cargolade''. [[Wild boar]] can be found in the more mountainous regions of the ''Midi''.<ref name=\"Domine\" />{{rp|349,360}}\n\n===Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur===\n{{See also|Provencal cuisine}}\n\nThe [[Provence]] and [[C\u00f4te d'Azur]] region is rich in quality citrus, vegetables, fruits and herbs; the region is one of the largest suppliers of all these ingredients in France. The region also produces the largest amount of olives, and creates superb olive oil. [[Lavender]] is used in many dishes found in ''Haute Provence''. Other important herbs in the cuisine include [[thyme]], [[Common sage|sage]], [[rosemary]], [[basil]], [[Satureja|savory]], [[fennel]], [[marjoram]], [[tarragon]], [[oregano]], and [[bay leaf]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nice-cooking.com/la-cuisine-nicoise/|title=Nice Cooking|publisher=La Cuisine Ni\u00e7oise|accessdate=2015-12-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011041615/http://www.nice-cooking.com/la-cuisine-nicoise/|archive-date=11 October 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Honey is a prized ingredient in the region. Seafood proliferates throughout the coastal area and is heavily represented in the cuisine. Goat cheeses, air-dried sausages, lamb, beef, and chicken are popular here. Garlic* and anchovies are used in many of the region's sauces, as in ''Poulet Proven\u00e7al'', which uses white wine, tomatoes, herbs, and sometimes anchovies, and [[Pastis]] is found everywhere that alcohol is served. The cuisine uses a large amount of vegetables for lighter preparations. Truffles are commonly seen in Provence during the winter. [[Thirteen desserts]] in Provence are the traditional Christmas dessert,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.provenceweb.fr/e/mag/terroir/traditions/ukindex.htm |title=Christmas traditions |publisher=Provenceweb.fr |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref> e.g. [[quince cheese]], biscuits, almonds, [[nougat]], apple, and [[fougasse (bread)|fougasse]].\n\nRice is grown in the [[Camargue]], which is the northernmost rice growing area in Europe, with [[Camargue red rice]] being a specialty.<ref name=\"Domine\" />{{rp|387,403,404,410,416}} Anibal Camous, a Marseillais who lived to be 104, maintained that it was by eating garlic daily that he kept his \"youth\" and brilliance.

Cheeses are also produced, with \"[[brocciu]]\" being the most popular. [[Chestnut]]s, growing in the Castagniccia forest, are used to produce flour, which is used in turn to make bread, cakes and [[polenta]]. The forest provides acorns used to feed the pigs and [[boar]]s that provide much of the protein for the island's cuisine. Fresh fish and seafood are common. The island's pork is used to make fine hams, sausage and other unique items including ''[[capicola|coppa]]'' (dried rib cut), ''lonzu'' (dried pork fillet), ''figatella'', ''salumu'' (a dried sausage) ''salcietta'', ''Panzetta'', bacon, ''figatellu'' (smoked and dried liverwurst) and ''prisuttu'' (farmer's ham).  [[Clementine]]s (which hold an AOC designation), lemons, nectarines and figs are grown there. Candied [[citron]] is used in [[nougat]]s, while and the aforementioned brocciu and chestnuts are also used in desserts. Corsica offers a variety of wines and fruit liqueurs, including [[Cap Corse]], [[Patrimonio]], ''C\u00e9dratine'', ''Bonapartine'', ''liqueur de myrte'', ''vins de fruit'', ''Rappu'', and ''[[eau-de-vie]] de ch\u00e2taigne''.<ref name=\"Domine\" />{{rp|435,441,442}}\n\n===French Guiana===\n{{See also|Guianan cuisine|Awara broth}}\n\n'''French Guianan cuisine''' or '''Guianan cuisine''' is a blend of the different cultures that have settled in [[French Guiana]]. Creole and Chinese restaurants are common in major cities such as [[Cayenne]], [[Kourou]] and [[Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni]]. Many indigenous animal species such as [[caiman]] and [[tapir]] are used in spiced stews.\n\n==Specialties by season==\nFrench cuisine varies according to the season. In summer, salads and fruit dishes are popular because they are refreshing and produce is inexpensive and abundant. Greengrocers prefer to sell their fruit and vegetables at lower prices if needed, rather than see them rot in the heat. At the end of summer, mushrooms become plentiful and appear in stews throughout France. The hunting season begins in September and runs through February. Game of all kinds is eaten, often in elaborate dishes that celebrate the success of the hunt. Shellfish are at their peak when winter turns to spring, and oysters appear in restaurants in large quantities.\n\nWith the advent of deep-freeze and the air-conditioned ''[[hypermarch\u00e9]]'', these seasonal variations are less marked than hitherto, but they are still observed, in some cases due to legal restrictions. [[Crayfish (food)|Crayfish]], for example, have a short season and it is illegal to catch them out of season.<ref>Imported crayfish are unrestricted, and many arrive from Pakistan.</ref> Moreover, they do not freeze well.\n\n==Foods and ingredients==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}}\n\nFrench regional cuisines use locally grown vegetables, such as ''pomme de terre'' (potato), ''bl\u00e9'' ([[wheat]]), ''[[Green bean|haricots verts]]'' (a type of French green bean), ''carotte'' (carrot), ''poireau'' ([[leek]]), ''navet'' ([[turnip]]), ''aubergine'' ([[eggplant]]), ''courgette'' ([[zucchini]]), and ''\u00e9chalotte'' ([[shallot]]).\n\nFrench regional cuisines use locally grown fungi, such as ''truffe'' ([[Tuber (genus)|truffle]]), ''champignon de Paris'' ([[button mushroom]]), ''chanterelle ou girolle'' ([[chanterelle]]), ''pleurote (en hu\u00eetre)'' ([[oyster mushroom]]s), and ''c\u00e8pes'' ([[porcini]]).\n\nCommon fruits include oranges, tomatoes, [[tangerine]]s, [[peach]]es, [[apricot]]s, [[apple]]s, [[pear]]s, [[plum]]s, [[Cherry|cherries]], [[Strawberry|strawberries]], [[Raspberry|raspberries]], [[redcurrant]]s, [[Blackberry|blackberries]], [[grape]]s, [[grapefruit]], and [[blackcurrant]]s.\n\nVarieties of meat consumed include ''poulet'' ([[Chicken (food)|chicken]]), ''pigeon'' ([[Squab (food)|squab]]), ''canard'' ([[Duck (food)|duck]]), ''oie'' ([[goose]], the source of [[foie gras]]), ''b\u0153uf'' ([[beef]]), ''veau'' ([[veal]]), ''porc'' ([[pork]]), ''agneau'' ([[Lamb (food)|lamb]]), ''mouton'' ([[mutton]]), ''caille'' ([[quails in cookery|quail]]), ''cheval'' ([[horse meat|horse]]), ''grenouille'' ([[frog legs|frog]]), and ''[[escargot]]'' (snails). Commonly consumed fish and seafood include [[Cod (food)|cod]], [[canned sardines]], [[sardine (food)|fresh sardines]], canned [[tuna]], fresh tuna, [[Salmon (food)|salmon]], [[trout]], [[mussel]]s, [[Herring (food)|herring]], [[oyster]]s, [[Shrimp (food)|shrimp]] and [[calamari]].\n\nEggs are fine quality and often eaten as: [[omelette]]s, hard-boiled with [[mayonnaise]], [[Scrambled eggs|scrambled]] plain, scrambled ''haute cuisine'' preparation, \u0153uf \u00e0 la coque.\n\nHerbs and seasonings vary by region, and include ''[[fleur de sel]]'', ''[[herbes de Provence]]'', [[tarragon]], [[rosemary]], [[marjoram]], [[lavender]], [[thyme]], [[fennel]], and [[Common sage|sage]].\n\nFresh fruit and vegetables, as well as fish and meat, can be purchased either from supermarkets or specialty shops. Street markets are held on certain days in most localities; some towns have a more permanent covered market enclosing food shops, especially meat and fish retailers. These have better shelter than the periodic street markets.\n\n<gallery perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Herbesdeprovence.jpg|''[[Herbes de provence]]''\nFile:Charetveau.jpg|''[[Charolais cattle]]''\nFile:Champignons Agaricus.jpg|''[[Champignon de Paris]]''\nFile:HaricotsVerts2.JPG|''[[Haricot bean|Haricots verts]]''\nFile:France-AOC Piment d'Espelette-2005-08-05.jpg|''[[Espelette pepper|Piments d'Espelette]]''\nFile:Fleur de sel2.jpg|''[[Fleur de sel]] de [[Gu\u00e9rande]]''\nFile:Wine grapes03.jpg|''[[Grape|Grappe de raisin]]''\nFile:Bresseh\u00fchner-1.jpg|''[[Poulet de Bresse]]''\nFile:Wheat close-up.JPG|''Bl\u00e9 ([[Wheat]])''\nFile:Truffe noire du P\u00e9rigord.jpg|''[[Black Truffle|Black P\u00e9rigord truffle]]''\n</gallery>\n\n==Structure of meals==\n\n===Breakfast===\n[[File:Cafe con leche y cruas\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|right|[[Coffee|Caf\u00e9]] with a [[croissant]] for breakfast]]\n\n''Le petit d\u00e9jeuner'' (breakfast) is traditionally a quick meal consisting of ''tartines'' (slices) of French bread with butter and honey or jam (sometimes [[brioche]]), along with caf\u00e9 au lait (also called \"caf\u00e9 cr\u00e8me\"), or black coffee, or tea<ref>{{cite book|title=Larousse Gastronomique|year=2009|publisher=Clarkson Potter|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-46491-0|page=780}}</ref> and rarely hot chicory. Children often drink [[hot chocolate]] in bowls or cups along with their breakfasts. ''[[Croissants]]'', ''[[pain aux raisins]]'' or ''[[pain au chocolat]]'' (also named ''chocolatine'' in the south of France) are mostly included as a weekend treat. Breakfast of some kind is always served in caf\u00e9s opening early in the day.\n\nThere are also savoury dishes for breakfast. An example is \"le petit d\u00e9jeuner gaulois\" or \"petit d\u00e9jeuner fermier\" with the famous long narrow bread slices with soft white cheese topped or boiled ham, called ''mouillettes'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/mouillette/52900|title=D\u00e9finitions : mouillette - Dictionnaire de fran\u00e7ais Larousse|first=\u00c9ditions|last=Larousse|website=www.larousse.fr|accessdate=6 July 2017}}</ref> which is dipped in a soft-boiled egg and some fruit juice and hot drink.\n\nAnother variation called \"le petit d\u00e9jeuner chasseur\", meant to be very hearty, is served with p\u00e2t\u00e9 and other charcuterie products. A more classy version is called \"le petit d\u00e9jeuner du voyageur\", where delicatessens serve gizzard, bacon, salmon, omelet, or croque-monsieur, with or without soft-boiled egg and always with the traditional coffee/tea/chocolate along fruits or fruit juice. When the egg is cooked sunny-side over the croque-monsieur, it is called a croque-madame.\n\nIn ''Germinal'' and other novels, \u00c9mile Zola also reported the ''briquet'': two long bread slices stuffed with butter, cheese and or ham. It can be eaten as a standing/walking breakfast, or meant as a \"second\" one before lunch.\n\nIn the movie ''[[Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis]]'', Philippe Abrams ([[Kad Merad]]) and Antoine Bailleul ([[Dany Boon]]) share together countless breakfasts consisting of ''tartines de Maroilles'' (a rather strong cheese) along with their hot chicory.\n\n===Lunch===\n''Le d\u00e9jeuner'' (lunch) is a two-hour mid-day meal or a one-hour lunch break. In some smaller towns and in the south of France, the two-hour lunch may still be customary. Sunday lunches are often longer and are taken with the family.<ref name=\"Steele\"/> Restaurants normally open for lunch at noon and close at 2:30&nbsp;pm. Some restaurants are closed on Monday during lunch hours.<ref name=\"Fodors\">{{Cite book | last = Fodor's | title = See It. France. 2nd ed. | publisher=Fodor's Travel Publications | year = 2006 | location = New York | isbn = }}</ref>\n\nIn large [[List of communes in France with over 20,000 inhabitants (1999 census)|cities]], a majority of working people and [[List of colleges and universities in France|students]] eat their lunch at a corporate or school cafeteria, which normally serves complete meals as described above; it is not usual for students to bring their own lunch to eat. For companies that do not operate a cafeteria, it is mandatory for [[white-collar worker]]s to be given lunch vouchers as part of their employee benefits. These can be used in most restaurants, supermarkets and ''[[traiteur (culinary profession)|traiteurs]]''; however, workers having lunch in this way typically do not eat all three courses of a traditional lunch due to price and time constraints. In smaller cities and towns, some working people leave their workplaces to return home for lunch. Also, an alternative, especially among [[blue-collar worker]]s, is eating sandwiches followed by a dessert; both dishes can be found ready-made at bakeries and supermarkets at budget prices.\n\n===Dinner===\n''Le d\u00eener'' (dinner) often consists of three [[full course dinner|courses]], ''[[hors d'\u0153uvre]]'' or ''[[entr\u00e9e]]'' (appetizers or introductory course, sometimes soup), ''plat principal'' (main course), and a cheese course or dessert, sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert. Yogurt may replace the cheese course, while a simple dessert would be fresh fruit. The meal is often accompanied by bread, [[French wine|wine]] and [[mineral water]]. Most of the time the bread would be a baguette which is very common in France and is made almost every day. Main meat courses are often served with vegetables, along with potatoes, rice or pasta.<ref name=\"Steele\">{{Cite book | last = Steele | first = Ross | title = The French Way, 2nd ed. | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year = 2001  | location = New York | isbn = }}</ref>{{rp|82}} Restaurants often open at 7:30&nbsp;pm for dinner, and stop taking orders between the hours of 10:00&nbsp;pm and 11:00&nbsp;pm. Some restaurants close for dinner on Sundays.<ref name=\"Fodors\" />{{rp|342}}\n\n==Beverages and drinks==\nIn French cuisine, beverages that precede a meal are called [[ap\u00e9ritif]]s (literally: ''that opens the appetite''), and can be served with [[amuse-bouche]]s (literally: ''mouth amuser''). Those that end it are called [[digestif]]s.\n\n;Ap\u00e9ritifs\n\nThe ap\u00e9ritif varies from region to region: [[Pastis]] is popular in the south of France, [[Cr\u00e9mant d'Alsace]] in the eastern region. [[Champagne]] can also be served. [[Kir (cocktail)|Kir]], also called ''Blanc-cassis'', is a common and popular ap\u00e9ritif-cocktail made with a measure of [[cr\u00e8me de cassis]] (blackcurrant liqueur) topped up with [[white wine]]. The phrase ''Kir Royal'' is used when white wine is replaced with a ''Champagne'' wine. A simple glass of red wine, such as [[Beaujolais nouveau]], can also be presented as an ap\u00e9ritif, accompanied by [[amuse-bouche]]s. Some ap\u00e9ritifs can be [[fortified wine]]s with added herbs, such as [[cinchona]], [[gentian]] and [[vermouth]]. Trade names that sell well include [[Suze (drink)|Suze]] (the classic gentiane), [[Byrrh]], [[Dubonnet]], and [[Noilly Prat]].\n\n;Digestifs\n\nDigestifs are traditionally stronger, and include [[Cognac (brandy)|Cognac]], [[Armagnac (brandy)|Armagnac]], [[Calvados (brandy)|Calvados]], [[Eau de vie]] and fruit alcohols.\n\n==Christmas==\nA typical French Christmas dish is turkey with chestnuts. Other common dishes are smoked salmon, oysters, caviar and ''foie gras''. The Yule log is a very French tradition during Christmas. Chocolate and cakes also occupy a prominent place for Christmas in France. This cuisine is normally accompanied by Champagne. Tradition says that thirteen desserts complete the Christmas meal in reference to the twelve apostles and Christ.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cheznoscousins.com/2014/12/30/10-traditions-noel-francaises/|title=10 traditions de No\u00ebl fran\u00e7aises - Cheznoscousins.com|date=30 December 2014|accessdate=6 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009113740/http://www.cheznoscousins.com/2014/12/30/10-traditions-noel-francaises/|archive-date=9 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.joyeux-noel.com/noeldanslemonde.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-10-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009134140/http://www.joyeux-noel.com/noeldanslemonde.html |archivedate=9 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[http://www.ambafrance-at.org/Noel-le-Nouvel-An-et-la-Fete-des-Rois ]{{dead link|date=July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://referat.clopotel.ro/Les_fetes_de_Noel_en_France-14079.html|title=LES FETES DE NOEL EN FRANCE|website=referat.clopotel.ro|accessdate=6 July 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:B\u00fbche de No\u00ebl chocolat framboise maison.jpg|thumb|Yule log, a French Christmas tradition]]\n\n==Food establishments==\n[[File:Cooks 050918 154402.jpg|thumb|Cooks at work]]\n\n===History{{Anchor|History of restaurants}}===\nThe modern restaurant has its origins in French culture. Prior to the late 18th century, diners who wished to \"dine out\" would visit their local [[guild]] member's kitchen and have their meal prepared for them. However, guild members were limited to producing whatever their guild registry delegated to them.<ref name=\"Spang\">{{Cite book | last = Spang | first = Rebecca L. | title = The Invention of the Restaurant, 2nd Ed. | publisher=Harvard University Press | year = 2001 | location =  | isbn = 978-0-674-00685-0}}</ref>{{rp|8\u201310}} These guild members offered food in their own homes to steady clientele that appeared day-to-day but at set times. The guest would be offered the meal [[table d'h\u00f4te]], which is a meal offered at a set price with very little choice of dishes, sometimes none at all.<ref name=\"Spang\" />{{rp|30\u201331}}\n\nThe first steps toward the modern restaurant were locations that offered ''restorative'' [[Bouillon (broth)|bouillons]], or ''restaurants'' \u2013 these words being the origin of the name \"restaurant\". This step took place during the 1760s\u20131770s. These locations were open at all times of the day, featuring ornate tableware and reasonable prices. These locations were meant more as meal replacements for those who had \"lost their appetites and suffered from jaded palates and weak chests.\"<ref name=\"Spang\" />{{rp|34\u201335}}\n\nIn 1782 Antoine Beauvilliers, [[pastry chef]] to the future [[Louis XVIII]], opened one of the most popular restaurants of the time \u2013 the ''Grande Taverne de Londres'' \u2013 in the arcades of the [[Palais-Royal]]. Other restaurants were opened by chefs of the time who were leaving the failing [[Kings of France|monarchy of France]], in the period leading up to the [[French Revolution]]. It was these restaurants that expanded upon the limited menus of decades prior, and led to the full restaurants that were completely legalized with the advent of the French Revolution and abolition of the guilds. This and the substantial discretionary income of the [[French Directory]]'s ''[[nouveau riche]]'' helped keep these new restaurants in business.<ref name=\"Spang\" />{{rp|140\u2013144}}\n\n[[File:Train bleu 05.jpg|thumb|Restaurant ''Le Train Bleu'', in Paris]]\n[[File:Bouchon leTablier.jpg|thumb|A [[bouchon]], ''Le tablier'' (the apron), in Vieux Lyon]]\n[[File:Caf\u00e9 de Flore.jpg|thumb|''Caf\u00e9 de Flore'', in Paris]]\n[[File:Lille - Estaminet 'T Rijsel - 20190423 (1).jpg|thumb|An estaminet in Lille]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Categories\n!English\n!French\n!Description\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|colspan=2|[[Restaurant]]\n|More than 5,000 in Paris alone, with varying levels of prices and menus.

There is a case for regarding the six motets catalogued [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis|BWV]] 225\u2013230 as being authenticated, although there is some doubt about one of them, [[Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden, BWV 230|''Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden'']]. A seventh motet, [[Ich lasse dich nicht, BWV Anh. 159|''Ich lasse dich nicht'', BWV Anh. 159]], which was formerly attributed to Bach's older cousin [[Johann Christoph Bach]], appears to be at least partly by Bach, and if so was probably composed during his Weimar period.\n\n[[BWV 228]] is another motet which appears to have been written at [[Weimar]], between 1708 and 1717, the others were composed in [[Leipzig]]. \nSeveral of the motets were written for funerals. There is some uncertainty as to the extent that motets would have been called for in normal church services - there is evidence that it was considered an archaic form. The text of [[Jauchzet dem Herrn, alle Welt, BWV Anh. 160|''Jauchzet dem Herrn, alle Welt'', BWV Anh. 160]] (whether or not the piece is attributable to Bach) suggests a performance at Christmas. Another possible use is a pedagogical one, Bach's biographer [[Johann Nikolaus Forkel]] suggested that the choral writing would have been useful for training Bach's young singers, and Christoph Wolff has argued that this could apply in particular to [[Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied, BWV 225|''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'']].<ref>Wolff, Christoph.

The work in two movements draws its text from the [[Book of Isaiah]] and a hymn by [[Paul Gerhardt]].

There is a case for regarding the six motets catalogued [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis|BWV]] 225\u2013230 as being authenticated, although there is some doubt about one of them. A seventh motet, [[Ich lasse dich nicht, BWV Anh. 159|''Ich lasse dich nicht'', BWV Anh. 159]], which was formerly attributed to Bach's older cousin [[Johann Christoph Bach]], appears to be at least partly by Bach, and if so was probably composed during his Weimar period.\n\n[[BWV 228]] is another motet which appears to have been written at [[Weimar]], between 1708 and 1717, the others were composed in [[Leipzig]]. \nSeveral of the motets were written for funerals. There is some uncertainty as to the extent that motets would have been called for in normal church services - there is evidence that it was considered an archaic form. The text of [[Jauchzet dem Herrn, alle Welt, BWV Anh. 160|''Jauchzet dem Herrn, alle Welt'', BWV Anh. 160]] (whether or not the piece is attributable to Bach) suggests a performance at Christmas. Another possible use is a pedagogical one, Bach's biographer [[Johann Nikolaus Forkel]] suggested that the choral writing would have been useful for training Bach's young singers, and Christoph Wolff has argued that this could apply in particular to [[Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied, BWV 225|''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'']].<ref>Wolff, Christoph.

It takes its title from the hymn \"[[Jesu, meine Freude]]\" by [[Johann Franck]] on which it is based. The stanzas of the chorale are interspersed with passages from the [[Epistle to the Romans]]. The chorale melody on which several movements are based was by [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]] (1653).

The work in two movements draws its text from the [[Book of Isaiah]] and a hymn by [[Paul Gerhardt]]. Traditionally, scholars believed that Bach composed it in Leipzig in 1726, while more recent scholarship suggests for stylistic reasons that it was already composed during Bach's Weimar period.

Its western border is the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; it shares land borders with [[Zambia]] and [[Angola]] to the north, [[Botswana]] to the east and [[South Africa]] to the south and east. Although [[Kazungula|it does not]] border [[Zimbabwe]], less than 200 metres of the [[Zambezi|Zambezi River]] separates the two countries. Namibia gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the [[Namibian War of Independence]]. Its capital and largest city is [[Windhoek]], and it is a member state of the [[United Nations]] (UN), the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC), the [[African Union]] (AU), and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. \n\nNamibia, the driest country in Sub-Saharan Africa,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/23/world/africa/namibia-eye-on-country-profile/index.html |title=Namibia country profile: moving on from a difficult past |author=Peter Shadbolt |website=CNN |date=24 October 2012}}</ref> was inhabited since early times by the [[San people|San]], [[Damara people|Damara]] and [[Nama people|Nama]] people. Around the 14th century, [[immigrating]] [[Bantu peoples]] arrived as part of the [[Bantu expansion]]. Since then, the Bantu groups, the largest being the [[Ovambo people|Ovambo]], have dominated the population of the country; since the late 19th century, they have constituted a majority.\n\nIn 1878, the [[Cape Colony|Cape of Good Hope]], then a British colony, annexed the port of [[Walvis Bay]] and the offshore [[Penguin Islands]]; these became an integral part of the new [[Union of South Africa]] at its creation in 1910. In 1884 the [[German Empire]] established rule over most of the territory, forming a colony known as [[German South West Africa]]. It developed farming and infrastructure. Between 1904 and 1908 it perpetrated a [[Herero and Namaqua genocide|genocide]] against the Herero and Nama people. German rule ended in 1915 with a defeat by South African forces. In 1920, after the end of [[World War I]], the [[League of Nations]] [[League of Nations mandate|mandated]] the administration of the colony to South Africa. It imposed its laws, including racial classifications and rules. From 1948, with the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] elected to power, South Africa applied [[apartheid]] also to what was then known as [[South West Africa]].\n\nIn the later 20th century, uprisings and demands for political representation by native African political activists seeking independence resulted in the UN assuming direct responsibility over the territory in 1966, but South Africa maintained ''de facto'' rule. In 1973 the UN recognised the South West Africa People's Organisation ([[SWAPO]]) as the official representative of the Namibian people; the party is dominated by the Ovambo, who are a large plurality in the territory. Following continued guerrilla warfare, South Africa installed an interim administration in Namibia in 1985. Namibia obtained full independence from South Africa in 1990. However, [[Walvis Bay]] and the [[Penguin Islands]] remained under South African control until 1994.\n\nNamibia has a population of 2.6&nbsp;million people and a stable [[multi-party system|multi-party]] [[parliamentary democracy]]. Agriculture, [[herding]], [[Tourism in Namibia|tourism]] and the [[Mineral industry of Namibia|mining industry]]&nbsp;\u2013 including mining for gem diamonds, [[Uranium mining|uranium]], [[Gold mining|gold]], [[Silver mining|silver]], and [[base metal]]s&nbsp;\u2013 form the basis of its [[Economy of Namibia|economy]]. The large, arid [[Namib Desert]] has resulted in Namibia being overall one of the [[List of countries and territories by population density|least densely populated]] countries in the world.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name of the country is derived from the [[Namib Desert]], the oldest desert in the world.<ref name=at1315>Spriggs, A. (2001) {{WWF ecoregion|name=Africa: Namibia|id=at1315}}</ref> The name ''Namib'' itself is of [[nama language|Nama]] origin and means \"vast place\". Before its independence in 1990, the area was known first as [[German South-West Africa]] (''Deutsch-S\u00fcdwestafrika''), then as South-West Africa, reflecting the colonial occupation by the Germans and the South Africans.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Namibia}}\n\n===Pre-colonial period===\n[[File:Buschmannkinder.jpg|thumb|[[San people]] are Namibia's oldest [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|indigenous]] inhabitants.]]\nThe dry lands of Namibia have been inhabited since early times by San, Damara, and Nama. Around the 14th century, immigrating [[Bantu people]] began to arrive during the [[Bantu expansion]] from central Africa.\n\nFrom the late 18th century onward, [[Oorlam people]] from Cape Colony crossed the [[Orange River]] and moved into the area that today is southern Namibia.<ref name=\"KDA\">{{cite web |url=http://www.klausdierks.com/Biographies/Biographies_A.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015021238/http://www.klausdierks.com/Biographies/Biographies_A.htm |archivedate=15 October 2008 |last=Dierks |first=Klaus |authorlink=Klaus Dierks |title=Biographies of Namibian Personalities, A |accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref> Their encounters with the nomadic Nama tribes were largely peaceful.

The Nama-Herero War broke out in 1880, with hostilities ebbing only after the [[German Empire]] deployed troops to the contested places and cemented the status quo among the Nama, Oorlam, and Herero.{{sfn|Vedder|1997|p=659}}\n\nThe first Europeans to disembark and explore the region were the Portuguese navigators [[Diogo C\u00e3o]] in 1485 and [[Bartolomeu Dias]] in 1486, but the Portuguese did not try to claim the area. Like most of interior [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], Namibia was not extensively explored by Europeans until the 19th century. At that time traders and settlers came principally from Germany and Sweden. In the late 19th century, [[Dorsland Trek]]kers crossed the area on their way from the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] to [[Angola]]. Some of them settled in Namibia instead of continuing their journey.\n\n===German rule===\n{{see also|German South West Africa|Herero and Namaqua genocide}}\n[[File:Kirche denkmal nam.jpg|thumb|German church and monument to colonists in Windhoek, Namibia.]]\nNamibia became a German colony in 1884 under [[Otto von Bismarck]] to forestall perceived British encroachment and was known as [[German South West Africa]] (''Deutsch-S\u00fcdwestafrika'').<ref>{{cite web|title=German South West Africa|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9036573/German-South-West-Africa|accessdate=15 April 2008}}</ref> The [[Palgrave Commission]] by the British governor in Cape Town determined that only the natural deep-water harbour of [[Walvis Bay]] was worth occupying and thus annexed it to the Cape province of British South Africa.\n\nFrom 1904 to 1907, the [[Herero people|Herero]] and the [[Nama people|Namaqua]] [[Herero Wars|took up arms]] against brutal German colonialism.

The German military governor [[Lothar von Trotha]] issued an explicit extermination order, and many Herero died of disease and abuse in detention camps after being taken from their land.

The only perennial rivers are found on the national borders with [[South Africa]], [[Angola]], [[Zambia]], and the short border with [[Botswana]] in the [[Caprivi Strip|Caprivi]]. In the interior of the country, surface water is available only in the summer months when rivers are in flood after exceptional rainfalls. Otherwise, surface water is restricted to a few large storage dams retaining and damming up these seasonal floods and their runoff. Where people do not live near perennial rivers or make use of the storage dams, they are dependent on groundwater. Even isolated communities and those economic activities located far from good surface water sources, such as mining, agriculture, and tourism, can be supplied from groundwater over nearly 80% of the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iwrm-namibia.info.na/iwrm/fundaments-in-iwrm/groundwater-in-namibia/index.php |title=Groundwater in Namibia |website=Integrated Water Resource Management |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729155617/http://www.iwrm-namibia.info.na/iwrm/fundaments-in-iwrm/groundwater-in-namibia/index.php |archive-date=29 July 2016 }}</ref>\n\nMore than 100,000 [[borehole]]s have been drilled in Namibia over the past century.

Only four African countries made the Top 20 Emerging Markets list in the March 2013 issue of Bloomberg Markets magazine, and Namibia was rated ahead of [[Morocco]] (19th), South Africa (15th) and [[Zambia]] (14th). Worldwide, Namibia also fared better than Hungary, Brazil and Mexico. Bloomberg Markets magazine ranked the top 20 based on more than a dozen criteria. The data came from Bloomberg's own financial-market statistics, IMF forecasts and the World Bank. The countries were also rated on areas of particular interest to foreign investors: the ease of doing business, the perceived level of corruption and economic freedom. To attract foreign investment, the government has made improvement in reducing red tape resulted from excessive government regulations, making Namibia one of the least bureaucratic places to do business in the region. Facilitation payments are occasionally demanded by customs due to cumbersome and costly customs procedures.<ref>{{cite web|title=Snapshot of Namibia Country Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/sub-saharan-africa/namibia/snapshot.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=6 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220022104/http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/sub-saharan-africa/namibia/snapshot.aspx|archive-date=20 February 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Namibia is also classified as an Upper Middle Income country by the [[World Bank]], and ranks 87th out of 185 economies in terms of ease of doing business.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/namibia/ |title=Namibia |publisher=Doingbusiness.org |date=10 January 2013 |accessdate=10 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[cost of living in Namibia]] is relatively high because most goods, including cereals, need to be imported.

The data indicates that the current income share held by the highest 10% is approximately 51.8%. This disparity illustrates the large gap between the rich and the poor.

Although per capita GDP is five times the per capita GDP of Africa's poorest countries, the majority of Namibia's people live in rural areas and have a subsistence way of life. Namibia has one of the [[List of countries by income equality|highest rates of income inequality]] in the world, due in part to the fact that there is an urban economy and a more rural cashless economy. The inequality figures thus take into account people who do not actually rely on the formal economy for their survival.

Around the 14th century, [[immigrating]] [[Bantu peoples]] arrived as part of the [[Bantu expansion]]. Since then, the Bantu groups, the largest being the [[Ovambo people|Ovambo]], have dominated the population of the country; since the late 19th century, they have constituted a majority.\n\nIn 1878, the [[Cape Colony|Cape of Good Hope]], then a British colony, annexed the port of [[Walvis Bay]] and the offshore [[Penguin Islands]]; these became an integral part of the new [[Union of South Africa]] at its creation in 1910. In 1884 the [[German Empire]] established rule over most of the territory, forming a colony known as [[German South West Africa]]. It developed farming and infrastructure. Between 1904 and 1908 it perpetrated a [[Herero and Namaqua genocide|genocide]] against the Herero and Nama people. German rule ended in 1915 with a defeat by South African forces. In 1920, after the end of [[World War I]], the [[League of Nations]] [[League of Nations mandate|mandated]] the administration of the colony to South Africa. It imposed its laws, including racial classifications and rules. From 1948, with the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] elected to power, South Africa applied [[apartheid]] also to what was then known as [[South West Africa]].\n\nIn the later 20th century, uprisings and demands for political representation by native African political activists seeking independence resulted in the UN assuming direct responsibility over the territory in 1966, but South Africa maintained ''de facto'' rule. In 1973 the UN recognised the South West Africa People's Organisation ([[SWAPO]]) as the official representative of the Namibian people; the party is dominated by the Ovambo, who are a large plurality in the territory. Following continued guerrilla warfare, South Africa installed an interim administration in Namibia in 1985. Namibia obtained full independence from South Africa in 1990. However, [[Walvis Bay]] and the [[Penguin Islands]] remained under South African control until 1994.\n\nNamibia has a population of 2.6&nbsp;million people and a stable [[multi-party system|multi-party]] [[parliamentary democracy]]. Agriculture, [[herding]], [[Tourism in Namibia|tourism]] and the [[Mineral industry of Namibia|mining industry]]&nbsp;\u2013 including mining for gem diamonds, [[Uranium mining|uranium]], [[Gold mining|gold]], [[Silver mining|silver]], and [[base metal]]s&nbsp;\u2013 form the basis of its [[Economy of Namibia|economy]]. The large, arid [[Namib Desert]] has resulted in Namibia being overall one of the [[List of countries and territories by population density|least densely populated]] countries in the world.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name of the country is derived from the [[Namib Desert]], the oldest desert in the world.<ref name=at1315>Spriggs, A. (2001) {{WWF ecoregion|name=Africa: Namibia|id=at1315}}</ref> The name ''Namib'' itself is of [[nama language|Nama]] origin and means \"vast place\". Before its independence in 1990, the area was known first as [[German South-West Africa]] (''Deutsch-S\u00fcdwestafrika''), then as South-West Africa, reflecting the colonial occupation by the Germans and the South Africans.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Namibia}}\n\n===Pre-colonial period===\n[[File:Buschmannkinder.jpg|thumb|[[San people]] are Namibia's oldest [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|indigenous]] inhabitants.]]\nThe dry lands of Namibia have been inhabited since early times by San, Damara, and Nama.

The Nama-Herero War broke out in 1880, with hostilities ebbing only after the [[German Empire]] deployed troops to the contested places and cemented the status quo among the Nama, Oorlam, and Herero.{{sfn|Vedder|1997|p=659}}\n\nThe first Europeans to disembark and explore the region were the Portuguese navigators [[Diogo C\u00e3o]] in 1485 and [[Bartolomeu Dias]] in 1486, but the Portuguese did not try to claim the area. Like most of interior [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], Namibia was not extensively explored by Europeans until the 19th century. At that time traders and settlers came principally from Germany and Sweden. In the late 19th century, [[Dorsland Trek]]kers crossed the area on their way from the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] to [[Angola]]. Some of them settled in Namibia instead of continuing their journey.\n\n===German rule===\n{{see also|German South West Africa|Herero and Namaqua genocide}}\n[[File:Kirche denkmal nam.jpg|thumb|German church and monument to colonists in Windhoek, Namibia.]]\nNamibia became a German colony in 1884 under [[Otto von Bismarck]] to forestall perceived British encroachment and was known as [[German South West Africa]] (''Deutsch-S\u00fcdwestafrika'').<ref>{{cite web|title=German South West Africa|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9036573/German-South-West-Africa|accessdate=15 April 2008}}</ref> The [[Palgrave Commission]] by the British governor in Cape Town determined that only the natural deep-water harbour of [[Walvis Bay]] was worth occupying and thus annexed it to the Cape province of British South Africa.\n\nFrom 1904 to 1907, the [[Herero people|Herero]] and the [[Nama people|Namaqua]] [[Herero Wars|took up arms]] against brutal German colonialism.

Otherwise, surface water is restricted to a few large storage dams retaining and damming up these seasonal floods and their runoff. Where people do not live near perennial rivers or make use of the storage dams, they are dependent on groundwater. Even isolated communities and those economic activities located far from good surface water sources, such as mining, agriculture, and tourism, can be supplied from groundwater over nearly 80% of the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iwrm-namibia.info.na/iwrm/fundaments-in-iwrm/groundwater-in-namibia/index.php |title=Groundwater in Namibia |website=Integrated Water Resource Management |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729155617/http://www.iwrm-namibia.info.na/iwrm/fundaments-in-iwrm/groundwater-in-namibia/index.php |archive-date=29 July 2016 }}</ref>\n\nMore than 100,000 [[borehole]]s have been drilled in Namibia over the past century.

UNESCO's video presentation of the Royal Ballet of Cambodia depicts a modern-day propitiation ceremony at Wat Phnom.</ref> For entertainment, performances were often staged inside the pavilions of royal palaces.<ref name=\"Jacobsen2008\" /> In Phnom Penh, the Moonlight Pavilion was built for and is still used occasionally for classical dance performances.

These gestures are often vague and abstract, though some may be easily understood. Dancers do not sing or generally speak, except in some dance dramas where there are brief instances of speech by the dancers.\n\nHand gestures in Khmer classical dance are called ''{{transl|km|kbach}}'' (meaning \"style\"). These hand gestures form a sort of alphabet and represent various things from nature such as fruit, flowers and leaves. They are used in different combinations and transitions with accompanying movement of the legs and feet to convey different thoughts and concepts.<ref name=\"Fletcher2001\"/> The way gestures are presented, the position of the arm, and the position of the hand relative to the arm can affect their meaning. Gestures are performed in different manners depending on the character type.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n[[File:BupphaDeviDance.png|thumb|Princess [[Buppha Devi]] performs a propitiation dance (c. 1965) as a ''{{transl|km|neang rong}}''. Note the dancers of lower ranks (''{{transl|km|philieng}}'') in [[obeisance]].]]\n\nFour main types of roles exist in Khmer classical dance: ''{{transl|km|neay rong}}'' (male), ''{{transl|km|neang}}'' (female), ''{{transl|km|yeak}}'' (ogres or [[asuras]]), and the ''{{transl|km|sva}}'' (monkeys).<ref name=\"Bois\">[[#Bois|Bois]], p. 4</ref> These four basic roles contain sub-classes to indicate character rank; a ''{{transl|km|neay rong ek}}'', for example, would be a leading male role and a ''{{transl|km|neang kamnan}}'' (or ''{{transl|km|philieng}}'') would be a maiden-servant.<ref name=\"Bois\"/> The sub-classes of the four main roles all perform in the same type of dancing style of the class they belong to. However, the ''{{transl|km|yeakheney}}'', or female ogre, is performed with a feminized dancing style of the male counterpart. Other female character types, such as the apsara, kinnari, or mermaid, follow the same dancing style as the ''{{transl|km|neang}}'' role but with subtle differences in gestures; the main difference being costume. The ''{{transl|km|ngoh}}'' character type, although male, is presented with a different dancing style than the ''{{transl|km|neay rong}}''.\n\nMost roles are performed by female dancers, but the role of monkeys was transferred to men under the guidance of Queen Sisowath Kosssamak. Other roles performed by men include hermits and animals such as horses and mythical lions.\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n'''''{{transl|km|Neay rong}}'''''\n*''{{transl|km|Neay rong ek}}'' - deities, kings, or princes (e.g. [[Rama]])\n*''{{transl|km|Philieng ek}}'' - ''aide-de-camp'' of important characters\n*''{{transl|km|Sena ek}}'' - the generals\n\n'''''{{transl|km|Neang}}'''''\n*''{{transl|km|Neang ek}}'' - deities, queens or princesses (e.g. [[Sita]] and [[Manimekhala]])\n*''{{transl|km|Neang rong}}'' - [[noblewomen]] or angels (e.g., the daughters of the tycoon, Sampov Keo and Sampov Meas in the dance drama: ''{{transl|km|Krai Thong}}'')\n*''{{transl|km|Philieng ek}}'' - female ''aid-de-camp'' (ex. {{transl|km|Sopheak Leak}})\n*''{{transl|km|Neang kamnan}}'' or ''{{transl|km|philieng}}'' - female servants or attendants\n\n'''''{{transl|km|Yeak}}'''''\n*''{{transl|km|Yeak ek}}'' - premiere ogres or asuras (e.g., [[Ravana]])\n*''{{transl|km|Yeak rong}}'' - the lesser ogres\n*''{{transl|km|Yeakheney}}'' - ogresses, [[yakkhini]] (e.g. [[Surpanakha]])\n\n'''''{{transl|km|Sva}}'''''\n*''{{transl|km|Neay sva khen}}'' - monkey generals (e.g., [[Hanuman]])\n*''{{transl|km|Pouk khen sva}}'' - monkey soldiers\n\n'''Other character types'''\n*Apsaras - celestial nymphs\n*''{{transl|km|Kinnorey}}'' - the mythical [[kinnara|kinnaris]] (e.g. [[Manohara]])\n*''{{transl|km|Maccha}}'' - [[mermaid]]s (e.g., [[Suvannamaccha]])\n*''{{transl|km|Ngoh}}'' - a special masculine role depicting a [[negrito]]\n*''Eysey'' - hermits or [[rishi]], a non-dancing role\n*[[Porter (carrier)|Porters]] - involved loosely in the dance, generally does not dance\n\n'''Animals'''\n*[[Garuda]] and mythical birds (e.g. [[Jatayu]])\n*[[Deer]] - the Golden Deer in the ''Ramayana''\n*[[Peafowl]]\n*[[Lion]]s\n*[[Horse]]\n}}\n\n== Costume ==\n[[File:Apsara dance.jpg|thumb|right|[[Apsara]] dancer]]\nClassical dance costumes are highly ornate and heavily embroidered, sometimes including sequins and even semi-precious gems. Most of the costumes are thought to be representative of what divinities wear, as reflected in the art style of the post-Angkor period. Various pieces of the costume (such as shirts) have to be sewn onto the dancers for a tight fit.\n\n=== Female costume ===\n\nThe typical female, or ''{{transl|km|neang}}'', costume consists of a ''{{transl|km|[[sampot]] sarabap}}'' (or ''{{transl|km|charabap}}''), a type of woven fabric with two contrasting silk threads along with a metallic thread (gold or silver in color). The ''{{transl|km|sampot}}'' is wrapped around the lower body in a sarong-like fashion, then [[pleated]] into a band in the front and secured with a gold or brass belt. In the current style, part of the pleated brocade band hangs over the belt on the left side of the belt buckle, which is a clear distinction from Thai classical dance costumes where this pleated band is tucked into the belt to the right of the belt buckle. Worn over the left shoulder is a [[shawl]]-like garment called a ''{{transl|km|[[sbai]]}}'' (also known as the ''{{transl|km|robang khnang}}'', literally \"back cover\"); it is the most decorative part of the female costume, embroidered extensively with tiny beads and sequins. The usual embroidery pattern for the ''sbai'' these days is a diamond-shaped floral pattern, but in the past there were more variations of floral patterns. Under the ''sbai'' is a silk undershirt or bodice worn with a short sleeve exposed on the left arm. Around the neck is an embroidered collar called a ''{{transl|km|srang kar}}''.\n\nJewelry for the female role includes a large, [[filigreed|filigree]] square pendant of which is hung by the corner, various types of ankle and wrists [[bracelets]] and [[bangle]]s, an [[arm ring|armlet]] on the right arm, and body chains of various styles.\n\n=== Male costume ===\n\nMale characters wear costumes that are more intricate than the females, as they require pieces, like sleeves, to be sewn together while being put on. They are dressed in a ''{{transl|km|sampot sarabap}}'' like their female counterpart; however, it is worn differently. For the male, or ''neay rong'', the ''{{transl|km|sampot}}'' is worn in the ''{{transl|km|[[chang kben]]}}'' fashion, where the front is pleated and pulled under, between the legs, then tucked in the back and the remaining length of the pleat is stitched to the ''{{transl|km|sampot}}'' itself to form a draping 'fan' in the back. Knee-length pants are worn underneath, displaying a wide, embroidered [[hem]] around the knees. For the top, they wear long-sleeved shirts with rich embroidering, along with a collar, or ''{{transl|km|srang kar}}'', around their neck. On the end of their shoulders are a sort of [[epaulette]] that arches upwards like [[Indra]]'s bow (known as ''{{transl|km|inthanu}}''). Other components of the male costumes are three richly embroidered banners worn around the front waist. The center piece is known as a ''{{transl|km|robang muk}}'' while the two side pieces are known as a ''{{transl|km|cheay kraeng}}''; monkeys and yaksha characters wear another piece in the back called a ''{{transl|km|robang kraoy}}''.\n\nMale characters also wear an X-like strap around the body called a ''{{transl|km|sangvar}}''; it may be made of gold-colored silk or chains of gold with square ornaments, the latter being reserved for more important characters. Males wear the same ankle and wrist jewelry as females, but with the addition of an extra set of bangles on the wrist and no armlets. They also wear a kite-shaped ornament called a ''{{transl|km|sloek po}}'' (named after the [[bo tree]] leaf), which serves as a center point for their ''{{transl|km|sangvar}}''.\n\n=== Headdress ===\n\nThere are several types of [[Crown (headgear)|crowns]] that denote characters' ranks. Commonly worn by female characters of the lowest rank is the ''{{transl|km|kbang}}''; it is also worn by Brahmin characters with ornaments around a bun of hair. [[Divinity|Divinities]] and royal characters of the highest ranks wear a tall single-spire crown called a ''{{transl|km|mokot ksat}}'' for male characters and a ''{{transl|km|mokot ksatrey}}'' for female characters. The ''{{transl|km|panchuret}}'' (Groslier romanizes this as ''{{transl|km|panntiereth}}''), reserved for princes and generals (''{{transl|km|sena}}''), is a circlet-like crown with a faux knot in the back. The ''{{transl|km|rat klao}}'' is worn by princesses and often by maidens of significance in a dance if they happen to not be of royal rank. Some characters' headdressings include ear ornaments as well as earrings. Characters such as ogres and monkeys wear masks. Ogres and monkeys of royal rank wear masks with a ''{{transl|km|mokot}}'' attached.\n\n=== Floral adornments ===\n\nDancers are traditionally adorned with fragrant flowers, although sometimes fresh flowers are substituted with faux flowers. The floral tassel is traditionally made of ''[[Jasminum sambac]]'' strung together with ''[[Michelia]]'' flowers, being either ''[[Michelia \u00d7 alba]]'' or ''[[Michelia champaca]]''. The ''{{transl|km|neang}}'' (female) role wears a rose above the right ear and a floral tassel attached to the left side of the crown while the ''{{transl|km|neay rong}}'' (male) role wears a rose on the left ear and a floral tassel to the right side. Sometimes, dancers will wear jasmine garlands fit for the wrists. The ''apsara'' role is most often adorned with the flowers of either ''[[Plumeria obtusa]]'' or white cultivars of ''[[Plumeria rubra]]''; sometimes plumerias are tied along the back of their hair.\n\n== Music ==\n{{main|Pinpeat}}\n{{listen \n | filename     = Khmer classical dance song.ogg\n | title        = Krai Thong\n | description  = A song from a scene in the dance drama Krai Thong.\n | format       = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\nThe music used for Khmer classical dance is played by a pinpeat ensemble. This type of orchestra consists of several types of [[xylophones]], [[drum]]s, [[oboe]]s, [[gong]]s, and other [[musical instrument]]s. The chorus consists of several singers who mainly sing in the absence of music. The lyrics are in poetry form and are sung interspersed with the grammatical particles eu [\u0259\u02d0], eung [\u0259\u02d0\u014b], and euy [\u0259\u02d0j] in various patterns.\n\n=== Musical instruments ===\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*''{{transl|km|[[Roneat ek]]}}'' : The lead xylophone with bamboo or teak wood keys\n*''{{transl|km|[[Roneat thung]]}}'' : A xylophone with bamboo or teak wood keys; low\n*''{{transl|km|[[Roneat dek]]}}'' : A metallophone of brass keys\n*''{{transl|km|Roneat thong}}'' : A metallophone (now rarely used)\n*''{{transl|km|[[Kong thom]]}}'' : A set of 16 gongs arranged in a circle\n*''{{transl|km|[[Kong toch]]}}'' : Like the gongs above, but smaller\n*''{{transl|km|[[Chhing]]}}'' : A pair of finger cymbals\n*''{{transl|km|Krap}}'' : A pair of wood clappers (now rarely used)\n*''{{transl|km|[[Sralai]]}}'' : A type of shawm; there are two sizes\n*''{{transl|km|[[Khloy]]}}'' : A type of flute made from bamboo (now rarely used)\n*''{{transl|km|Skor thom}}'' : A pair of drums played with a percussion mallet\n*''{{transl|km|[[Sampho]]}}'' : A type of drum played with the hands\n}}\n\n=== Music pieces ===\nKhmer classical dance uses particular pieces of music for certain events, such as when a dancer enters or leaves a scene, or performs certain actions, such as flying or walking.

Since the restoration of the Royal Ballet in the 1979, some of the old repertoire was recreated and several new dances were also created, most notably ''robam monosanhchettana'' by the late Chea Samy. As of recent years, new dance dramas have been created by the Royal Ballet, such as ''Apsara Mera''. [[Sophiline Cheam Shapiro]] has also introduced new repertory to Khmer classical dance, although they are not part of the traditional royal repertoire and mainly have been performed in Western venues. Her works include dramas such as ''{{transl|km|Samritechak}}'', an adaptation of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]'' and ''{{transl|km|Pamina Devi}}'', an adaptation of [[Mozart]]'s ''[[The Magic Flute]]''.\n\n=== Dance dramas ===\n\nThe repertoire of dance dramas ({{lang|km|\u179a\u17bf\u1784}}, ''{{transl|km|roeung}}'') consists of a myriad of stories, unlike the ''{{transl|km|lakhon khol}}'', which is limited only to the ''Ramayana''. Many of the dance dramas have analogs in the ''lakhon nai'' dance genre of Thailand but do not share the same choreography or exact storyline. During the time of Queen Kossamak, several dance dramas were re-choreographed and shortened such as ''[[Preah Thong and Neang Neak|Roeung Preah Thong-Neang Neak]]''; this drama, among others, would be recreated in 2003.\n\nThe plots of many dance dramas often concern a male character who rescues a [[damsel in distress]] or destined love presented with obstacles. The traditional repertoire portrays mythology or traditional tales and may sometimes include religious concepts such as [[karma]].\n\n[[File:Cambodian Classical Dance of Tribute.ogv|thumb|400px|A dance of tribute used in a dance drama titled ''Preah Ket Mealea'', circa 1965]]\n\n==== Select repertory of dance dramas ====\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* ''{{transl|km|[[Reamker]]}}'' (''Ramakerti'', {{lang|km|\u179a\u17b6\u1798\u1780\u17c1\u179a\u17d2\u178f\u17b7\u17cd}}): Ramayana\n* ''{{transl|km|Preah Sothon-Neang Monorea}}'' ({{lang|km|\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179f\u17bc\u1792\u1793-\u1793\u17b6\u1784\u1798\u1793\u17c4\u17a0\u17cd\u179a\u17b6}}): Sudhana-Jataka, formerly referred to as ''{{transl|km|Kailas}} ({{lang|km|\u1780\u17c3\u179b\u17b6\u179f}}), recreated in 2003\n* ''{{transl|km|Krai Thong}}'' ({{lang|km|\u1780\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1790\u17c4\u1784}})\n* ''{{transl|km|Inao}}'' ({{lang|km|\u17a5\u178e\u17b6\u179c}}): [[Panji (prince)|Panji]]\n* ''{{transl|km|Kakey}}'' ({{lang|km|\u1780\u17b6\u1780\u17b8}}): Kakati-Jataka\n* ''{{transl|km|Preah Anoruth-Neang Usa}}'' ({{lang|km|\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u17a2\u1793\u17bb\u179a\u17bb\u1791\u17d2\u1792-\u1793\u17b6\u1784\u17a7\u179f\u17b6}}): [[Aniruddha]]\n* ''{{transl|km|Sopheak Leak}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179f\u17bb\u1797\u179b\u1780\u17d2\u1781\u178e\u17cd}}): [[Chitralekha (deity)|Chitralekha]]\n* ''{{transl|km|Preah Samot}}'' ({{lang|km|\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179f\u1798\u17bb\u1791\u17d2\u179a}})\n* ''{{transl|km|Sovannahong}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179f\u17bb\u179c\u178e\u17d2\u178e\u17a0\u1784\u17d2\u179f}})\n* ''{{transl|km|Preah Sang}}'' ({{lang|km|\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179f\u17d0\u1784\u17d2\u1781}})\n}}\n\n=== Dances ===\n\nIn contrast to the dance dramas are shorter dances known as ''{{transl|km|robam}}''. They can serve several purposes, such as honoring, ritualistic functions (e.g. securing the kingdom's fortune and prosperity), and blessing. Spanning several minutes or so, not all these dances have storylines, although many ''robam'' are indeed excerpts from dance dramas such as ''{{transl|km|robam mekhala-reamso}}'' and ''{{transl|km|robam sovan macchha}}'' (the latter being from the ''{{transl|km|Reamker}}'').\n\nThe 'apsara dance' of today was created under the guidance of Queen Kossamak Nearireath. Its costume is based on the [[bas-relief]] of ''apsaras'' on temple ruins but much of it, including its music and gesture, is not unique from other classical Khmer dances that probably do not date back to the [[Angkor]] period.\n\n==== Select repertory of dances ====\n\n* [[Apsara Dance|Robam Apsara]] (\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u17a2\u1794\u17d2\u179f\u179a\u17b6)\n* [[Robam Tep Monorom]] (\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u1791\u17c1\u1796\u1798\u1793\u17c4\u179a\u1798\u17d2\u1799)\n* [[Robam Chun Por]] (\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u1787\u17bc\u1793\u1796\u179a)\n* [[Robam Makar]] (\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u1798\u1780\u179a)\n* [[Robam Sovann Maccha]] (\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u179f\u17bb\u179c\u178e\u17d2\u178e\u1798\u1785\u17d2\u1786\u17b6)\n* [[Robam Moni Mekhala]] or Mekhala-Reamesor (\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u1798\u178e\u17b8\u1798\u17c1\u1781\u179b\u17b6)\n\n== Glossary ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n;''{{transl|km|kbach}}'' ({{lang|km|\u1780\u17d2\u1794\u17b6\u1785}}) : (lit., \"style\" or \"motif\") referring to a pose or gesture used in Khmer classical dance\n;''{{transl|km|lakhon}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179b\u17d2\u1781\u17c4\u1793}}) : (lit., \"theatre\"; also romanized as ''lakhaon'' and ''lkhaon''), referring to different genres of theatrical performances\n;''{{transl|km|lakhon preah reach trop}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179b\u17d2\u1781\u17c4\u1793\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u1791\u17d2\u179a\u1796\u17d2\u1799}}): (lit., \"theatre of royal wealth\") the Khmer name for the main classical dance drama of Cambodia; the royal ballet of Cambodia, in this case, the term ''lakhon'' may be substituted with ''robam''\n;''{{transl|km|robam}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6}}) : (lit., \"dance\"), a term used to refer to dances and in some contexts, all classical dances\n;''{{transl|km|robam kbach boran}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u1780\u17d2\u1794\u17b6\u1785\u17cb\u1794\u17bc\u179a\u17b6\u178e}}): (lit., \"dance of the ancient style\") a term referring to classical dance that is used in the genres of theatre including ''{{transl|km|lakhon khol}}'', ''{{transl|km|lakhon pol srey}}'', and ''{{transl|km|lakhon preah reach trop}}''.

These gestures are often vague and abstract, though some may be easily understood. Dancers do not sing or generally speak, except in some dance dramas where there are brief instances of speech by the dancers.\n\nHand gestures in Khmer classical dance are called ''{{transl|km|kbach}}'' (meaning \"style\"). These hand gestures form a sort of alphabet and represent various things from nature such as fruit, flowers and leaves. They are used in different combinations and transitions with accompanying movement of the legs and feet to convey different thoughts and concepts.<ref name=\"Fletcher2001\"/> The way gestures are presented, the position of the arm, and the position of the hand relative to the arm can affect their meaning. Gestures are performed in different manners depending on the character type.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n[[File:BupphaDeviDance.png|thumb|Princess [[Buppha Devi]] performs a propitiation dance (c. 1965) as a ''{{transl|km|neang rong}}''. Note the dancers of lower ranks (''{{transl|km|philieng}}'') in [[obeisance]].]]\n\nFour main types of roles exist in Khmer classical dance: ''{{transl|km|neay rong}}'' (male), ''{{transl|km|neang}}'' (female), ''{{transl|km|yeak}}'' (ogres or [[asuras]]), and the ''{{transl|km|sva}}'' (monkeys).<ref name=\"Bois\">[[#Bois|Bois]], p. 4</ref> These four basic roles contain sub-classes to indicate character rank; a ''{{transl|km|neay rong ek}}'', for example, would be a leading male role and a ''{{transl|km|neang kamnan}}'' (or ''{{transl|km|philieng}}'') would be a maiden-servant.<ref name=\"Bois\"/> The sub-classes of the four main roles all perform in the same type of dancing style of the class they belong to. However, the ''{{transl|km|yeakheney}}'', or female ogre, is performed with a feminized dancing style of the male counterpart. Other female character types, such as the apsara, kinnari, or mermaid, follow the same dancing style as the ''{{transl|km|neang}}'' role but with subtle differences in gestures; the main difference being costume. The ''{{transl|km|ngoh}}'' character type, although male, is presented with a different dancing style than the ''{{transl|km|neay rong}}''.\n\nMost roles are performed by female dancers, but the role of monkeys was transferred to men under the guidance of Queen Sisowath Kosssamak. Other roles performed by men include hermits and animals such as horses and mythical lions.\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n'''''{{transl|km|Neay rong}}'''''\n*''{{transl|km|Neay rong ek}}'' - deities, kings, or princes (e.g. [[Rama]])\n*''{{transl|km|Philieng ek}}'' - ''aide-de-camp'' of important characters\n*''{{transl|km|Sena ek}}'' - the generals\n\n'''''{{transl|km|Neang}}'''''\n*''{{transl|km|Neang ek}}'' - deities, queens or princesses (e.g. [[Sita]] and [[Manimekhala]])\n*''{{transl|km|Neang rong}}'' - [[noblewomen]] or angels (e.g., the daughters of the tycoon, Sampov Keo and Sampov Meas in the dance drama: ''{{transl|km|Krai Thong}}'')\n*''{{transl|km|Philieng ek}}'' - female ''aid-de-camp'' (ex. {{transl|km|Sopheak Leak}})\n*''{{transl|km|Neang kamnan}}'' or ''{{transl|km|philieng}}'' - female servants or attendants\n\n'''''{{transl|km|Yeak}}'''''\n*''{{transl|km|Yeak ek}}'' - premiere ogres or asuras (e.g., [[Ravana]])\n*''{{transl|km|Yeak rong}}'' - the lesser ogres\n*''{{transl|km|Yeakheney}}'' - ogresses, [[yakkhini]] (e.g. [[Surpanakha]])\n\n'''''{{transl|km|Sva}}'''''\n*''{{transl|km|Neay sva khen}}'' - monkey generals (e.g., [[Hanuman]])\n*''{{transl|km|Pouk khen sva}}'' - monkey soldiers\n\n'''Other character types'''\n*Apsaras - celestial nymphs\n*''{{transl|km|Kinnorey}}'' - the mythical [[kinnara|kinnaris]] (e.g. [[Manohara]])\n*''{{transl|km|Maccha}}'' - [[mermaid]]s (e.g., [[Suvannamaccha]])\n*''{{transl|km|Ngoh}}'' - a special masculine role depicting a [[negrito]]\n*''Eysey'' - hermits or [[rishi]], a non-dancing role\n*[[Porter (carrier)|Porters]] - involved loosely in the dance, generally does not dance\n\n'''Animals'''\n*[[Garuda]] and mythical birds (e.g. [[Jatayu]])\n*[[Deer]] - the Golden Deer in the ''Ramayana''\n*[[Peafowl]]\n*[[Lion]]s\n*[[Horse]]\n}}\n\n== Costume ==\n[[File:Apsara dance.jpg|thumb|right|[[Apsara]] dancer]]\nClassical dance costumes are highly ornate and heavily embroidered, sometimes including sequins and even semi-precious gems. Most of the costumes are thought to be representative of what divinities wear, as reflected in the art style of the post-Angkor period. Various pieces of the costume (such as shirts) have to be sewn onto the dancers for a tight fit.\n\n=== Female costume ===\n\nThe typical female, or ''{{transl|km|neang}}'', costume consists of a ''{{transl|km|[[sampot]] sarabap}}'' (or ''{{transl|km|charabap}}''), a type of woven fabric with two contrasting silk threads along with a metallic thread (gold or silver in color). The ''{{transl|km|sampot}}'' is wrapped around the lower body in a sarong-like fashion, then [[pleated]] into a band in the front and secured with a gold or brass belt. In the current style, part of the pleated brocade band hangs over the belt on the left side of the belt buckle, which is a clear distinction from Thai classical dance costumes where this pleated band is tucked into the belt to the right of the belt buckle. Worn over the left shoulder is a [[shawl]]-like garment called a ''{{transl|km|[[sbai]]}}'' (also known as the ''{{transl|km|robang khnang}}'', literally \"back cover\"); it is the most decorative part of the female costume, embroidered extensively with tiny beads and sequins. The usual embroidery pattern for the ''sbai'' these days is a diamond-shaped floral pattern, but in the past there were more variations of floral patterns. Under the ''sbai'' is a silk undershirt or bodice worn with a short sleeve exposed on the left arm. Around the neck is an embroidered collar called a ''{{transl|km|srang kar}}''.\n\nJewelry for the female role includes a large, [[filigreed|filigree]] square pendant of which is hung by the corner, various types of ankle and wrists [[bracelets]] and [[bangle]]s, an [[arm ring|armlet]] on the right arm, and body chains of various styles.\n\n=== Male costume ===\n\nMale characters wear costumes that are more intricate than the females, as they require pieces, like sleeves, to be sewn together while being put on. They are dressed in a ''{{transl|km|sampot sarabap}}'' like their female counterpart; however, it is worn differently. For the male, or ''neay rong'', the ''{{transl|km|sampot}}'' is worn in the ''{{transl|km|[[chang kben]]}}'' fashion, where the front is pleated and pulled under, between the legs, then tucked in the back and the remaining length of the pleat is stitched to the ''{{transl|km|sampot}}'' itself to form a draping 'fan' in the back. Knee-length pants are worn underneath, displaying a wide, embroidered [[hem]] around the knees. For the top, they wear long-sleeved shirts with rich embroidering, along with a collar, or ''{{transl|km|srang kar}}'', around their neck. On the end of their shoulders are a sort of [[epaulette]] that arches upwards like [[Indra]]'s bow (known as ''{{transl|km|inthanu}}''). Other components of the male costumes are three richly embroidered banners worn around the front waist. The center piece is known as a ''{{transl|km|robang muk}}'' while the two side pieces are known as a ''{{transl|km|cheay kraeng}}''; monkeys and yaksha characters wear another piece in the back called a ''{{transl|km|robang kraoy}}''.\n\nMale characters also wear an X-like strap around the body called a ''{{transl|km|sangvar}}''; it may be made of gold-colored silk or chains of gold with square ornaments, the latter being reserved for more important characters. Males wear the same ankle and wrist jewelry as females, but with the addition of an extra set of bangles on the wrist and no armlets. They also wear a kite-shaped ornament called a ''{{transl|km|sloek po}}'' (named after the [[bo tree]] leaf), which serves as a center point for their ''{{transl|km|sangvar}}''.\n\n=== Headdress ===\n\nThere are several types of [[Crown (headgear)|crowns]] that denote characters' ranks. Commonly worn by female characters of the lowest rank is the ''{{transl|km|kbang}}''; it is also worn by Brahmin characters with ornaments around a bun of hair. [[Divinity|Divinities]] and royal characters of the highest ranks wear a tall single-spire crown called a ''{{transl|km|mokot ksat}}'' for male characters and a ''{{transl|km|mokot ksatrey}}'' for female characters. The ''{{transl|km|panchuret}}'' (Groslier romanizes this as ''{{transl|km|panntiereth}}''), reserved for princes and generals (''{{transl|km|sena}}''), is a circlet-like crown with a faux knot in the back. The ''{{transl|km|rat klao}}'' is worn by princesses and often by maidens of significance in a dance if they happen to not be of royal rank. Some characters' headdressings include ear ornaments as well as earrings. Characters such as ogres and monkeys wear masks. Ogres and monkeys of royal rank wear masks with a ''{{transl|km|mokot}}'' attached.\n\n=== Floral adornments ===\n\nDancers are traditionally adorned with fragrant flowers, although sometimes fresh flowers are substituted with faux flowers. The floral tassel is traditionally made of ''[[Jasminum sambac]]'' strung together with ''[[Michelia]]'' flowers, being either ''[[Michelia \u00d7 alba]]'' or ''[[Michelia champaca]]''. The ''{{transl|km|neang}}'' (female) role wears a rose above the right ear and a floral tassel attached to the left side of the crown while the ''{{transl|km|neay rong}}'' (male) role wears a rose on the left ear and a floral tassel to the right side. Sometimes, dancers will wear jasmine garlands fit for the wrists. The ''apsara'' role is most often adorned with the flowers of either ''[[Plumeria obtusa]]'' or white cultivars of ''[[Plumeria rubra]]''; sometimes plumerias are tied along the back of their hair.\n\n== Music ==\n{{main|Pinpeat}}\n{{listen \n | filename     = Khmer classical dance song.ogg\n | title        = Krai Thong\n | description  = A song from a scene in the dance drama Krai Thong.\n | format       = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\nThe music used for Khmer classical dance is played by a pinpeat ensemble. This type of orchestra consists of several types of [[xylophones]], [[drum]]s, [[oboe]]s, [[gong]]s, and other [[musical instrument]]s. The chorus consists of several singers who mainly sing in the absence of music. The lyrics are in poetry form and are sung interspersed with the grammatical particles eu [\u0259\u02d0], eung [\u0259\u02d0\u014b], and euy [\u0259\u02d0j] in various patterns.\n\n=== Musical instruments ===\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*''{{transl|km|[[Roneat ek]]}}'' : The lead xylophone with bamboo or teak wood keys\n*''{{transl|km|[[Roneat thung]]}}'' : A xylophone with bamboo or teak wood keys; low\n*''{{transl|km|[[Roneat dek]]}}'' : A metallophone of brass keys\n*''{{transl|km|Roneat thong}}'' : A metallophone (now rarely used)\n*''{{transl|km|[[Kong thom]]}}'' : A set of 16 gongs arranged in a circle\n*''{{transl|km|[[Kong toch]]}}'' : Like the gongs above, but smaller\n*''{{transl|km|[[Chhing]]}}'' : A pair of finger cymbals\n*''{{transl|km|Krap}}'' : A pair of wood clappers (now rarely used)\n*''{{transl|km|[[Sralai]]}}'' : A type of shawm; there are two sizes\n*''{{transl|km|[[Khloy]]}}'' : A type of flute made from bamboo (now rarely used)\n*''{{transl|km|Skor thom}}'' : A pair of drums played with a percussion mallet\n*''{{transl|km|[[Sampho]]}}'' : A type of drum played with the hands\n}}\n\n=== Music pieces ===\nKhmer classical dance uses particular pieces of music for certain events, such as when a dancer enters or leaves a scene, or performs certain actions, such as flying or walking.

Since the restoration of the Royal Ballet in the 1979, some of the old repertoire was recreated and several new dances were also created, most notably ''robam monosanhchettana'' by the late Chea Samy. As of recent years, new dance dramas have been created by the Royal Ballet, such as ''Apsara Mera''. [[Sophiline Cheam Shapiro]] has also introduced new repertory to Khmer classical dance, although they are not part of the traditional royal repertoire and mainly have been performed in Western venues. Her works include dramas such as ''{{transl|km|Samritechak}}'', an adaptation of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]'' and ''{{transl|km|Pamina Devi}}'', an adaptation of [[Mozart]]'s ''[[The Magic Flute]]''.\n\n=== Dance dramas ===\n\nThe repertoire of dance dramas ({{lang|km|\u179a\u17bf\u1784}}, ''{{transl|km|roeung}}'') consists of a myriad of stories, unlike the ''{{transl|km|lakhon khol}}'', which is limited only to the ''Ramayana''. Many of the dance dramas have analogs in the ''lakhon nai'' dance genre of Thailand but do not share the same choreography or exact storyline. During the time of Queen Kossamak, several dance dramas were re-choreographed and shortened such as ''[[Preah Thong and Neang Neak|Roeung Preah Thong-Neang Neak]]''; this drama, among others, would be recreated in 2003.\n\nThe plots of many dance dramas often concern a male character who rescues a [[damsel in distress]] or destined love presented with obstacles. The traditional repertoire portrays mythology or traditional tales and may sometimes include religious concepts such as [[karma]].\n\n[[File:Cambodian Classical Dance of Tribute.ogv|thumb|400px|A dance of tribute used in a dance drama titled ''Preah Ket Mealea'', circa 1965]]\n\n==== Select repertory of dance dramas ====\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* ''{{transl|km|[[Reamker]]}}'' (''Ramakerti'', {{lang|km|\u179a\u17b6\u1798\u1780\u17c1\u179a\u17d2\u178f\u17b7\u17cd}}): Ramayana\n* ''{{transl|km|Preah Sothon-Neang Monorea}}'' ({{lang|km|\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179f\u17bc\u1792\u1793-\u1793\u17b6\u1784\u1798\u1793\u17c4\u17a0\u17cd\u179a\u17b6}}): Sudhana-Jataka, formerly referred to as ''{{transl|km|Kailas}} ({{lang|km|\u1780\u17c3\u179b\u17b6\u179f}}), recreated in 2003\n* ''{{transl|km|Krai Thong}}'' ({{lang|km|\u1780\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1790\u17c4\u1784}})\n* ''{{transl|km|Inao}}'' ({{lang|km|\u17a5\u178e\u17b6\u179c}}): [[Panji (prince)|Panji]]\n* ''{{transl|km|Kakey}}'' ({{lang|km|\u1780\u17b6\u1780\u17b8}}): Kakati-Jataka\n* ''{{transl|km|Preah Anoruth-Neang Usa}}'' ({{lang|km|\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u17a2\u1793\u17bb\u179a\u17bb\u1791\u17d2\u1792-\u1793\u17b6\u1784\u17a7\u179f\u17b6}}): [[Aniruddha]]\n* ''{{transl|km|Sopheak Leak}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179f\u17bb\u1797\u179b\u1780\u17d2\u1781\u178e\u17cd}}): [[Chitralekha (deity)|Chitralekha]]\n* ''{{transl|km|Preah Samot}}'' ({{lang|km|\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179f\u1798\u17bb\u1791\u17d2\u179a}})\n* ''{{transl|km|Sovannahong}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179f\u17bb\u179c\u178e\u17d2\u178e\u17a0\u1784\u17d2\u179f}})\n* ''{{transl|km|Preah Sang}}'' ({{lang|km|\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179f\u17d0\u1784\u17d2\u1781}})\n}}\n\n=== Dances ===\n\nIn contrast to the dance dramas are shorter dances known as ''{{transl|km|robam}}''. They can serve several purposes, such as honoring, ritualistic functions (e.g. securing the kingdom's fortune and prosperity), and blessing. Spanning several minutes or so, not all these dances have storylines, although many ''robam'' are indeed excerpts from dance dramas such as ''{{transl|km|robam mekhala-reamso}}'' and ''{{transl|km|robam sovan macchha}}'' (the latter being from the ''{{transl|km|Reamker}}'').\n\nThe 'apsara dance' of today was created under the guidance of Queen Kossamak Nearireath. Its costume is based on the [[bas-relief]] of ''apsaras'' on temple ruins but much of it, including its music and gesture, is not unique from other classical Khmer dances that probably do not date back to the [[Angkor]] period.\n\n==== Select repertory of dances ====\n\n* [[Apsara Dance|Robam Apsara]] (\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u17a2\u1794\u17d2\u179f\u179a\u17b6)\n* [[Robam Tep Monorom]] (\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u1791\u17c1\u1796\u1798\u1793\u17c4\u179a\u1798\u17d2\u1799)\n* [[Robam Chun Por]] (\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u1787\u17bc\u1793\u1796\u179a)\n* [[Robam Makar]] (\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u1798\u1780\u179a)\n* [[Robam Sovann Maccha]] (\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u179f\u17bb\u179c\u178e\u17d2\u178e\u1798\u1785\u17d2\u1786\u17b6)\n* [[Robam Moni Mekhala]] or Mekhala-Reamesor (\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u1798\u178e\u17b8\u1798\u17c1\u1781\u179b\u17b6)\n\n== Glossary ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n;''{{transl|km|kbach}}'' ({{lang|km|\u1780\u17d2\u1794\u17b6\u1785}}) : (lit., \"style\" or \"motif\") referring to a pose or gesture used in Khmer classical dance\n;''{{transl|km|lakhon}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179b\u17d2\u1781\u17c4\u1793}}) : (lit., \"theatre\"; also romanized as ''lakhaon'' and ''lkhaon''), referring to different genres of theatrical performances\n;''{{transl|km|lakhon preah reach trop}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179b\u17d2\u1781\u17c4\u1793\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u1791\u17d2\u179a\u1796\u17d2\u1799}}): (lit., \"theatre of royal wealth\") the Khmer name for the main classical dance drama of Cambodia; the royal ballet of Cambodia, in this case, the term ''lakhon'' may be substituted with ''robam''\n;''{{transl|km|robam}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6}}) : (lit., \"dance\"), a term used to refer to dances and in some contexts, all classical dances\n;''{{transl|km|robam kbach boran}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u1780\u17d2\u1794\u17b6\u1785\u17cb\u1794\u17bc\u179a\u17b6\u178e}}): (lit., \"dance of the ancient style\") a term referring to classical dance that is used in the genres of theatre including ''{{transl|km|lakhon khol}}'', ''{{transl|km|lakhon pol srey}}'', and ''{{transl|km|lakhon preah reach trop}}''.

Manufacture of the Y-7, in civil form, has now been supplanted by the [[MA60]] derivative with western engines and avionics, to improve performance and economy, and widen the export appeal.\n\n===Total production===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right; font-size: 96%;\"\n|-\n!Total Production (Not including Chinese Y-7)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://russianplanes.net/planelist/Antonov/An-24|title=\u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0410\u043d-24|website=russianplanes.net|accessdate=2019-08-22}}</ref>!! 1979 !! 1978 !! 1977 !! 1976 !! 1975 !! 1974 !! 1973 !! 1972 !! 1971 !! 1970 !! 1969 !! 1968 !! 1967 !! 1966 !! 1965 !! 1964 !! 1963 !! 1962 !! 1961 !! 1960 !! 1959 \n|-\n||'''1285'''||1||2||15||25||45||88||83||82||91||135||136||158||166||112||62||44||25||9||1||4||1\n|}\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Antonow an24 cockpit.jpg|thumb|Cockpit]]\n;An-24\n: Original design and prototypes.

Various projects were envisaged such as a four jet short/medium haul airliner and various iterations of powerplant.\n\nThe main production line was at the [[Kiev-Svyatoshino]] (now \"[[Aviant]]\") aircraft production plant which built 985, with 180 built at [[Ulan-Ude Aviation Plant|Ulan Ude]] and a further 197 An-24T tactical transport/freighters at [[Irkut Corporation|Irkutsk]]. Production in the USSR was shut down by 1978.\n\nProduction continues at China's [[Xi'an Aircraft Industrial Corporation]] which makes licensed, reverse-engineered and redesigned aircraft as the [[Xian Y-7]], and its derivatives. Manufacture of the Y-7, in civil form, has now been supplanted by the [[MA60]] derivative with western engines and avionics, to improve performance and economy, and widen the export appeal.\n\n===Total production===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right; font-size: 96%;\"\n|-\n!Total Production (Not including Chinese Y-7)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://russianplanes.net/planelist/Antonov/An-24|title=\u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0410\u043d-24|website=russianplanes.net|accessdate=2019-08-22}}</ref>!! 1979 !! 1978 !! 1977 !! 1976 !! 1975 !! 1974 !! 1973 !! 1972 !! 1971 !! 1970 !! 1969 !! 1968 !! 1967 !! 1966 !! 1965 !! 1964 !! 1963 !! 1962 !! 1961 !! 1960 !! 1959 \n|-\n||'''1285'''||1||2||15||25||45||88||83||82||91||135||136||158||166||112||62||44||25||9||1||4||1\n|}\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Antonow an24 cockpit.jpg|thumb|Cockpit]]\n;An-24\n: Original design and prototypes.

DO NOT ADD ANY OTHERS -->\n}}\n'''Samantha Margaret Priscilla Mitchell''' (also '''Butcher''' and '''Hunter'''), better known as '''Sam Mitchell''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]''. The third member of the Mitchell family to be introduced, Sam enters as a 15-year-old school girl in July 1990, played by [[Danniella Westbrook]]. Westbrook quit in 1993, but Sam was reintroduced from 1995\u20131996 and from 1999\u20132000. In both her 1996 and 2000 exits, Sam was written out earlier than the producers intended due to off-screen controversies surrounding Westbrook and her [[cocaine]] addiction. In 2002, the character was reintroduced for a fourth time, but the role was recast to another actress, [[Kim Medcalf]]. Medcalf left the role in 2005. In an interview with [[Paul O'Grady]], Medcalf said she would 'never say never' to a comeback. However, when executive producer [[Diederick Santer]] decided to reintroduce the character for a brief stint in 2009, he opted to bring Westbrook back. The character returned in September 2009 for a short stint and departed in January 2010. Sam returned for another short stint from August until September. In 2016, Westbrook agreed to reprise the role once again in 2016 for her on-screen mother, [[Peggy Mitchell]]'s ([[Barbara Windsor]]) funeral, a brief stint, starting on 30 June 2016 and concluding after four episodes on 8 July 2016.\n\nPortrayed as headstrong, flirty and manipulative, early storylines featuring Sam concentrate on her teen elopement to the character [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]). She goes on to feature in storylines about topless modelling, various family crises including being conned into selling her family's businesses to lawyer [[Marcus Christie]] ([[Stephen Churchett]]) and husband Andy, as well as being framed by her family for her uncle [[Archie Mitchell]] ([[Larry Lamb]])'s murder (see [[Who Killed Archie?]]), relationships with [[David Wicks]] ([[Michael French]]), [[Beppe di Marco]] ([[Michael Greco (actor)|Michael Greco]]), [[Steve Owen (EastEnders)|Steve Owen]] ([[Martin Kemp]]), [[Trevor Morgan (EastEnders)|Trevor Morgan]] ([[Alex Ferns]]), [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]) and [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]), feuds with [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]), [[Mel Owen]] ([[Tamzin Outhwaite]]), [[Chrissie Watts]] ([[Tracy Ann Oberman|Tracy-Ann Oberman]]), [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]) and [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]), and a short-lived marriage to [[Andy Hunter (EastEnders)|Andy Hunter]] ([[Michael Higgs]]). Her exit storyline in 2005 is the culmination of a high-profile storyline that sees the character wrongly imprisoned for [[Den Watts]]' ([[Leslie Grantham]]) murder. In the on-screen events, Sam is cleared of murder and released, but she flees the country to escape another prison sentence for perverting the course of justice. Her brief return in 2009 sees the character resurrect a relationship with Ricky whilst having an on-off affair with [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]), being manipulated by her uncle Archie and causing her family to lose a number of their businesses for a second time before finally going to prison. Her returns in 2010 and 2016 sees her struggle with motherhood after giving birth to Jack's baby, [[Ricky Mitchell|Ricky]] (Henri Charles).\n\n==Storylines==\n\n===Backstory===\nSam is the youngest child and only daughter of [[Peggy Mitchell|Peggy]] ([[Jo Warne]]/[[Barbara Windsor]]) and Eric Mitchell. Eric died when Sam was ten and she was subsequently on the receiving end of her older brothers',  [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant]]'s ([[Ross Kemp]]), heavy-handed paternalism.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sam Mitchell|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters/sam_m_biog.shtml|publisher= BBC|accessdate=5 July 2008|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20010811130832/http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters/sam_m_biog.shtml|archivedate= 11 August 2001}}</ref>\n\n===1990\u20132000===\nFifteen-year-old Sam follows her brothers to Walford in July 1990, unhappy at home because she dislikes their mother's boyfriend, [[Kevin Masters (EastEnders)|Kevin Masters]] ([[Colin McCormack]]). She becomes friends with [[Hattie Tavernier]] ([[Michelle Gayle]]) and dates [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]). Sam's family disapproves of the relationship, so Ricky and Sam decide to elope to [[Gretna Green]] in 1991; they marry despite the Mitchells trying to stop the nuptials. Peggy admits defeat and attends their more formal blessing in Walford a month later.\n\nSam fails to earn schooling qualifications, but she gains attention because of her looks after winning the title of \"Miss Queen Vic\" at the local public house; she starts to believe she can have a career modelling, but when she attempts to get a portfolio done by a professional photographer, he persuades her to do a topless shoot and the photos are then published in a pornographic magazine. This causes problems in Ricky and Sam's relationship, which is already under strain as Ricky is unable to provide Sam with the luxurious lifestyle she desires. After just a year of marriage, Sam grows bored and begins lusting after a [[playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]] named Clive ([[Sean Gallagher (actor)|Sean Gallagher]]) whom she meets at a New Year's Eve party with her friend [[Mandy Salter]] ([[Nicola Stapleton]]). After having a brief affair, Sam thinks she has fallen in love with Clive, but he makes it clear that he is only interested in sex when he tries to coax her into having a [[threesome]]. Realising that her marriage with Ricky is over, Sam leaves her husband and Walford in 1993 to take a job as a holiday rep on a cruise ship.\n\nSam returns in 1995, after her brothers, on a boys holiday in [[Spain]], catch her in bed with [[David Wicks]] ([[Michael French]]), and force her to return. Sam had tried to build herself a career as a [[model (person)|model]], but it had not gone to plan and she had ended up working as a hostess in a bar. Back in Walford Sam tries to continue her fling with David and when this goes nowhere she tries to come between Ricky and his girlfriend, [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]). Initially, Ricky thinks he still has feelings for Sam, but eventually realises he is better off with Bianca and tries to let Sam down gently. However Sam won't take no for an answer and purposefully kisses an innocent Ricky in front of Bianca, causing them to split. Despite this, Ricky will not reconsider getting back with Sam and opts to try to make amends with Bianca. Sam is forced to admit defeat. Soon after, she meets a Spanish man named Guillermo, who is holidaying in England. When he invites her to join him in Spain she leaps at the chance and leaves Walford again in March 1996.\n\nIn 1999, Sam decides that she wants to settle down in Walford once more. During this time she embarks on a stormy relationship with [[Beppe di Marco]] ([[Michael Greco (actor)|Michael Greco]]), but she takes things more seriously than he does. After he finishes the relationship, a heartbroken Sam looks for comfort elsewhere. She turns to local club owner and Phil's adversary [[Steve Owen (EastEnders)|Steve Owen]] ([[Martin Kemp]]) for support, but he is only using her to make his girlfriend [[Mel Owen|Mel Healy]] ([[Tamzin Outhwaite]]) jealous \u2013 so a hurt Sam decides to leave Walford once again in 2000.\n\n===2002\u20132005===\nIn 2002, Peggy catches Sam working in a lap-dancing club in Spain. Ashamed and penniless, Sam returns to Walford with her mother and has a brief relationship with Steve until the latter's death at the start of March 2002. She then proceeds to have numerous flings with her cousin [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]) and Phil's archenemies, [[Trevor Morgan (EastEnders)|Trevor Morgan]] ([[Alex Ferns]]) and [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]), respectively \u2013 as well briefly having a relationship with her ex-lovers Beppe and Ricky. All of whom soon turn out to be using her to varying degrees. One night, whilst working in the pub, Sam is nearly raped by [[Dave Roberts (EastEnders)|Dave Roberts]] ([[David Kennedy (actor)|David Kennedy]]). She manages to fight Dave off and escape the pub. Sam soon begins flirting with Dennis' illegitimate father, [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]), but is left humiliated after he sacks her from her job at his family's club.\n\nAnimosity between the Watts and Mitchell families escalates. Sam is left in charge of the Mitchell empire when her brother, Phil, goes on the run after escaping prison for an armed robbery \u2014 for which he has been set up for by Den. Sam persuades Billy to torch Phil's snooker club in an insurance scam, an act that results in Den's club burning down and his daughter [[Vicki Fowler|Vicki]] ([[Scarlett Johnson]]) nearly perishing in the fire. Dennis vows revenge and he is only warned off when his friend [[Andy Hunter (EastEnders)|Andy Hunter]] ([[Michael Higgs]]), the local crime kingpin of Walford, begins a relationship with Sam. They soon marry in September 2004,<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Rupert |title=''EastEnders'': 20 Years in Albert Square |year= 2005|publisher=BBC Books |location=London |isbn=978-0-563-52165-5 |page=199}}</ref> despite Sam's crush [[Minty Peterson]] ([[Cliff Parisi]]) attempting to stop the wedding \u2014 he has fallen in love with Sam and knows that Andy is only using her to gain control of the Mitchell assets. Andy fools Sam into signing over control of Phil's house, and she is then conned out of all the Mitchell businesses by family lawyer [[Marcus Christie]] ([[Stephen Churchett]]) and Den. Marcus tells Sam that Phil wants her to sell everything and give the cash to him. She does so, selling her mother's [[public house]], [[The Queen Victoria]], for a vastly reduced price to Den. Marcus is lying, and once he has the Mitchells' money, he flees, leaving Sam with nothing. Andy, realising Sam is no use to him, throws her out of their house \u2013 leaving her penniless.\n\nWhilst trying to move on from her marriage with Andy, with the couple clashing with each other on several occasions, Sam becomes determined to get revenge on Den; she teams up with his wife [[Chrissie Watts|Chrissie]] ([[Tracy Ann Oberman]]) and their neighbour [[Zoe Slater]] ([[Michelle Ryan]]) -  who herself had become a victim of Den as a result of her relationship with Dennis - to carry out their vengeful plot against Den. On the night of Den's wedding anniversary to his late wife [[Angie Watts|Angie]] ([[Anita Dobson]]), the three women confront him at The Queen Vic shortly after he closes up. At first Den taunts Sam and her unlikely conspirators over their weakness, but it soon turns out that Den's adoptive daughter [[Sharon Watts|Sharon]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) was overhearing the whole conversation; Chrissie had planned for Sharon to return to Albert Square so that she can overhear Den admit to his misdeeds and disown him in response, thus ridding Den of the woman he devoted as his daughter \u2013 and henceforth exacting revenge upon Den for what he did. This works successfully, and Sam even congratulates Chrissie for getting payback on Den \u2013 telling her \"You're quite a bitch, ain't ya!\". However, shortly after Sharon leaves Walford, Den returns to The Queen Vic and the event takes an unexpected and violent turn: Den suddenly attacks Chrissie and Zoe hits him over the head with [[Pauline Fowler]]'s ([[Wendy Richard]]) iron doorstop in defence, all the while Sam watches in shock. This is thought to have killed him; however, when Zoe and Sam leave the room, Den grabs Chrissie's ankle and she responds by hitting him on the head a second time \u2013 finally killing him. In the moment where Chrissie kills Den, however, Sam witnesses this and she later grows appalled when Chrissie allows Zoe to believe that her blow killed Den. As Chrissie has possession of The Queen Vic following Den's death, Sam blackmails her \u2013 threatening to unveil Chrissie as Den's killer unless she gives her the pub.\n\nOn the day after Den's murder, to which the square is unaware about yet, Sam is surprised to learn that Andy has died on the same night; Andy was murdered by his gangland rival [[Johnny Allen (EastEnders)|Johnny Allen]] ([[Billy Murray (actor)|Billy Murray]]) after attempting to con him out of \u00a3750,000. In the events of Andy's funeral, Sam smugly attends his will meeting; she meets up with his solicitor and expects to receive all his money and assets. She promises to let Pat keep her job at the bookies, but inadvertently insults her by offering her cleaning work at the house. Sam is confused, however, when she is told that Andy had created a new will and is later stunned when Andy leaves the house to [[Pat Butcher|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St Clement]]) and the bookies to Dennis \u2013 whilst giving his and Sam's money to a dog's trust. She is further horrified when he leaves her nothing but a wedding ring and states \"so she can sell it, get her roots done and still be the dumbest blonde I ever knew.\" \u2013 much to Pat's amusement. As she struggles to move on from Andy and their turbulent marriage, with Minty and his friend [[Danny Moon]] ([[Jake Maskall]]) comforting her over the situation, Sam learns that Chrissie is attempting to sell the pub and leave Walford. She soon begins drinking heavily and, determined to expose Chrissie as Den's killer, smashes up Den's grave and digs him up. Unfortunately for her, the plan backfires; all evidence points to Sam, who is charged with murder and remanded in custody. When Peggy returns to the square and learns about Sam's recent troubles, she visits her and Sam tells Peggy that Chrissie killed Den. Upon believing Sam, an outraged Peggy later confronts Chrissie at Den's funeral and smacks her onto his coffin \u2013 vowing to prove Sam's innocence. In attempting to secure Sam's release and expose Chrissie as Den's killer, Peggy starts a feud with Chrissie and later forms a conflict with Johnny when he and Chrissie build a partnership; with Peggy also resenting Johnny for the way how she treated her late husband and Sam's father Eric. Just as it appears that Peggy is unable to find a way of proving Sam's innocence, Phil and Grant return to Walford to secure her release. Eventually, with help from Sharon and Dennis \u2013 who end up learning the truth about their father's murder \u2013 the Mitchells are finally able to prevent Johnny from destroying the videotape of Chrissie confessing Den's murder to her boyfriend, Danny's brother [[Jake Moon]] ([[Joel Beckett]]); the police are given the tape and they end up arresting Chrissie at the airport for Den's murder. Sam is later released from custody; however, she still faces a charge of [[perverting the course of justice]] and faces a prison sentence up to four years. This prospect is too daunting for Sam, and she flees to [[Brazil]] while on bail in 2005.\n\n===2009\u20132016===\nIn 2009, Phil sends Ricky to Brazil on an errand where he meets Sam,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a174376/picture-sam-mitchells-going-for-a-thong.html|title=Picture: Sam Mitchell's going for a thong|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=29 August 2009|accessdate=2 September 2009}}</ref> and she returns to London using a fake passport. She immediately causes a stir by drawing attention to herself and reignites her feud with Bianca. The Mitchells try to keep her hidden, but Bianca, jealous of Ricky's renewed feelings for Sam, calls the police. Sam is arrested while trying to flee but is released on bail when [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]) pays the surety. Sam and Ricky get engaged, but Sam has an affair with [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]). Peggy's estranged husband, [[Archie Mitchell]] ([[Larry Lamb]]), uses Sam as a pawn in his plan to destroy the Mitchells, persuading her to jump bail again and leave the country to escape a prison sentence, so Archie can successfully steal The Queen Vic from Peggy. Sam opts to stay so Archie tells Bianca about Sam and Jack's affair; she tells Ricky and after a showdown, Ricky ends the engagement. Following this, Sam takes Archie's money and flees, causing the Mitchells to lose the pub. She returns to Walford on Christmas Day 2009, hoping to make amends. On that same day, Archie is murdered (see [[Who Killed Archie?]]) and Sam becomes one of the suspects. Phil, Peggy and Ronnie also have motives, and in order to stop the police framing them, they decide Sam should take the blame and leave the country. Sam overhears their plan and furious, turns herself in, implicating Peggy in Archie's murder for revenge. Sam is arrested and sentenced to 18 months in prison. When Peggy attempts to visit, Sam is hostile, rejecting her mother and disowning the Mitchell name.\n\nLater in 2010, Peggy visits Sam in prison and discovers she is heavily pregnant. Sam does not know if Ricky or Jack is the father and she refuses to reconcile with Peggy; however when she is hospitalised and goes into labour, she reconsiders, requesting Peggy's help. Sam gives birth to a boy, [[Ricky Mitchell|Richard]], but announces she is giving him up for adoption. She only reconsiders as a means to reconcile with Ricky; she returns to Walford having completed her prison sentence, but struggles as a parent and relies heavily on Peggy and Minty. Ricky and Jack pester Sam to a get a paternity test, which she eventually does. She lies, claiming Ricky is the father, however Bianca discovers the truth and Sam confesses that she has lied because Ronnie, Jack's girlfriend, asked her to. Ronnie does not want Sam or her baby near Jack. She manipulates Sam into leaving and pays her money to do so. Sam leaves but, fearful of bringing up her baby alone, she seduces Minty, who still loves her, suggesting he goes with her. Minty momentarily accepts, but then realises Sam is merely using him and turns her down. Sam departs with Richard, moving to Portugal to live with Grant.\n\nAlmost six years later, Sam returns to Walford alongside Richard, now nicknamed Ricky (Henri Charles), in June 2016, to attend Peggy's funeral. She reveals that Grant is not attending and winds up Sharon about Grant, causing Sharon to reveal that she and Grant had kissed. Jack decides that he wants to see Ricky so Sam drops him at the Brannings. After the funeral, Sam gets drunk and Phil harshly confronts her causing her to leave the pub. Sam reveals to her cousin [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]) that she is struggling to look after Ricky and that he is better off with Jack. Sam abandons Ricky at Jack's house and leaves in the back of a taxi.\n\n==Creation and development==\n\n===Casting===\nThe character Sam Mitchell was introduced in July 1990 by ''EastEnders''' executive producer [[Michael Ferguson (director)|Michael Ferguson]] as the young sister of the Mitchell brothers, [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant]] ([[Ross Kemp]]). Sam was one of several characters introduced by the producer in the summer of 1990. Others included [[Eddie Royle]] ([[Michael Melia]]), and three generations of the [[Celestine Tavernier|Tavernier]] family.<ref name=\"10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref>\n\nAs the casting team had successfully cast the actors who were playing Sam's brothers, they already knew what facial attributes they needed for Sam to create a similar family resemblance. Producer [[Corinne Hollingworth]] has commented, \"we'd decided on Steve [McFadden] and Ross [Kemp] and we knew the sort of round, open face we needed. We saw Danniella (Westbrook) first and liked her, then saw some others, but came back to her.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\">{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= The EastEnders Handbook |year=1990|publisher=BBC books|isbn=978-0-563-36292-0|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> The actress, a graduate of the Sylvia Young Theatre School, had already appeared in the soap aged 11, as an extra who rollerskated across the soap's fictional setting of [[Albert Square]] in front of the characters [[Den Watts|Den]] and [[Angie Watts]]. At the time, Westbrook's local paper ran a story on her with the punchline, \"who knows, one day she might be the show's star\".<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Eighty girls auditioned for the part of Sam, but these eighty were eventually whittled down to four.<ref name=\"biog\">{{cite book|last=Westbrook|first= Danniella|title=The Other Side of Nowhere|year=2006|publisher=Hodder|isbn=978-0-340-89887-1}}</ref> On her final casting callback, Westbrook bumped into actors [[Michelle Gayle]] and [[Sid Owen]], who were already on the ''EastEnders'' cast as [[Hattie Tavernier]] and [[Ricky Butcher]] respectively. Westbrook already knew Gayle, whose character was to be Sam's screen best friend, and she introduced her to Owen, whose character was scripted to be Sam's boyfriend.<ref name=\"biog\"/> According to Westbrook, she liked Owen right from the start and was amused by his response of \"You're a bit of alright. You can be Sam!\". On Westbrook's last audition, she and the other hopefuls were forced to stand for a lengthy period in front of a panel of the show's producers, directors and writers while they continuously compared images of the auditionees to images of Kemp and McFadden, looking for a resemblance.<ref name=\"biog\"/> Westbrook was given the part. She has commented, \"they told me they were looking for someone bright and bubbly, who could be the sister of Phil and Grant, and my round face fitted.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> In the character's first scene, Sam walked past Ricky Butcher and gave him a \"flirty backward glance\", causing him to walk into a lamp-post.<ref name=\"biog\"/> Westbrook was initially given a three-month contract with the soap, but halfway through her contract the producers extended it as they felt \"the character of Sam had gelled well with the others and they wanted to include her in more storylines\".<ref name=\"biog\"/>\n\nWestbrook has said that the cast and crew became like a second family to her, with the roles in the soap mirroring their relationships off-screen. In her autobiography she comments, \"Sid [Owen] and I became very close [...] we were as thick as thieves. When we weren't shooting together we'd hang out [...] Once Sid and I got so bored hanging around on set that we decided to take the milk float for a spin around Albert Square, but Sid drove it too fast and turned it over [...] we couldn't stop laughing, but the producers didn't seem to share our amusement. We were seriously told off that day.\"<ref name=\"biog\"/> She has described other actors like Michelle Gayle, [[Letitia Dean]], [[Adam Woodyatt]] and [[Nick Berry]] like brothers and sisters, and has said she was very close to older cast members such as [[June Brown]], [[Wendy Richard]], [[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]] and [[Gillian Taylforth]]. She has also revealed that her off-screen relationship with actors McFadden and Kemp mirrored her character's on-screen one: \"In the soap they were my older brothers, always looking out for me, making sure I didn't get into trouble, and off set they were exactly the same.\"<ref name=\"biog\"/>\n\n===Personality and characterisation===\nThe character has been described by Hilary Kingsley, author the ''EastEnders Handbook'', as a \"tease [...] a pretty girl who thinks she can get anything she wants, thanks to her own brand of sexy wheedling.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> She adds that Sam is \"a lot sharper than her brothers [...] and contrives to do just what she wants in the face of their attempts to stand in for their dead father [...] Sam loves excitement and doesn't frighten easily. She's a user, able to get almost anyone to do what she wants.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Kate Lock, author of ''EastEnders Who's Who'', has described Sam as \"Headstrong, streetwise and pretty [...] a chip off the old Mitchell block, though her methods of manipulation are marginally more subtle than [her brothers]. One bat of a sooty eyelash is enough to charm most men into submission and she can wind doting mum Peggy round her little finger [...] [when] she returned to the Square [in 1999], Sam had lost her kittenish cuteness and hardened up, becoming more EastEnd moll than Barbie doll.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Lock |first= Kate|title=EastEnders Who's Who |year=2000|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-55178-2|title-link= EastEnders books}}</ref>\n\nDescribing the character in 2002, actress [[Kim Medcalf]] said, \"She wears her heart on her sleeve. She so wants to settle down that she doesn't select men well. She goes for people too quickly. She likes the danger aspect \u2014 the thrill of the chase. She loves guys with a dangerous edge [...] She's had a tough upbringing. She didn't know her dad and her older brothers bossed her around. She needed to find herself and has done it by being independent and going away. She's headstrong and has a definite independent streak.\"<ref name=\"kim\">{{cite news |title=Kim reckons Sam needs to get a grip|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/backstage/cast/interviews/interview_content/interview_kim.shtml|publisher= BBC|accessdate=5 July 2008}}</ref> She has added that Sam has a problem with women, as she \"finds it quite hard to relate\".<ref name=\"EErevealed\"/>\n\nWhen Westbrook regained the role in 2009, she compared the differences between how she plays the character and how Medcalf played the character: \"When Kim was playing Sam she was quite hard, but [the Sam who returns in 2009] is more the Sam I've always played. She's bright, colourful, flirtatious \u2013 and trouble. The only difference is she's more tanned, more blonde and more wrinkled!\".<ref name=\"allaboutsoap\">{{Cite news|last=Crawford|first=Carena|date=August 2009|year=|title=Danniella Westbrook|periodical=[[All About Soap]]|location=[[England]]|place=|publisher=|volume=|issue=|pages=28\u201329|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\n===1990\u20132000: Off-screen controversies===\n\n====1990\u20131993: Teen elopement====\nDuring her first stint in the soap, the character was involved in various high-profile storylines surrounding her teen elopement to [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]). Westbrook has said that within days of her first appearance, the interest in the character was \"phenomenal\": \"The public couldn't get enough of the simmering relationship between Ricky and Sam and the show was inundated with calls from the press [...] [Sam and Ricky] were involved in a plotline about under-age sex, so the press swooped in on that.\"<ref name=\"biog\"/>\n\nTo the anger of her family, Sam persuaded Ricky to elope to Gretna Green in July 1991. The week's worth of episodes focusing on their marriage were filmed on-location and have been described by former ''EastEnders'' scriptwriter, [[Colin Brake]], as a \"farce-like chase round the country\". Written by Debbie Cook, the storyline saw Ricky and Sam's families, including Sam's mother [[Peggy Mitchell|Peggy]] ([[Jo Warne]]; introduced specifically for this plotline) attempting to stop the couple getting married. The storyline climaxed in a registry office wedding, but despite the Scottish setting, the recording of the episodes took place in [[Hertfordshire]].<ref name=\"10years\"/> Later in the month, Sam and Ricky had a more official \"grand church blessing\" with their families in attendance. The Butchers' blessing was screened in the same episode as the funeral of another character, [[Charlie Cotton]].<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/>\n\nThe marriage was portrayed as problematic, fraught with interference from their families, lack of money, and Ricky's jealousy of Sam's partying and modelling career, including a topless photo shoot. The serial made use of Sam's appearance in various storylines, including a \"Miss Queen Vic\" [[public house]] competition in an episode that aired in April 1992 \u2014 despite the Mitchell brothers attempts' to fix the competition, the honest winner was Sam. Written by [[Tony Jordan]], Colin Brake describes it as one of 1992's most memorable episodes.<ref name=\"10years\"/> However, off-screen Westbrook was battling with various problems in her personal life (including a highly publicised drug addiction), and in 1993 she left the soap, although she maintains that her addiction did not affect her work at this time.<ref>{{cite news |title=The digested read: The Other Side of Nowhere by Daniella Westbrook|url= https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-61158065|publisher= Guardian|date=3 April 2006 |accessdate=8 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn-screen, Sam's marriage to Ricky ended following an affair with a yuppie named Clive ([[Sean Gallagher (actor)|Sean Gallagher]]), and she took a job on a cruise ship. Commenting on her initial departure, Westbrook has said, \"My contract was up for renewal and I thought it was time for me to move on [...] As much as I enjoyed being in ''EastEnders'' [...] I was also well aware of the fact that I was in danger of being type-cast forever if I carried on playing Sam. The producers didn't have a problem with me leaving. It was felt that my character had done as much as she could in the space of three years, anyway. During that time Sam had, after all, been involved in a story about under-age sex, run off to Gretna Green to marry Ricky, been evicted from her home, become a squatter, tried her luck as a topless model, fought on a regular basis with Grant and Phil, and gone through a marriage break-up. I think we all agreed that the poor girl was in need of a break [...] In January 1993 I filmed my final scenes and Sam Mitchell, in true ''EastEnders'' style, waved goodbye to Albert Square from the back of a London taxi cab [...] Although the producers agreed that it was the right time for my character to move on, they wanted to keep the door open for her to return at a later date, as they knew how popular the Mitchell family were with viewers. I was really pleased that they decided not to kill the character off\".<ref name=\"biog\"/> Her departure scenes aired on 4 February 1993.\n\n====1995\u20131996: Reintroduction and axing====\nIn 1995, following a spell in a drug rehab clinic, which first alerted the public to her drug problem, Westbrook was reintroduced into ''EastEnders'' by executive producer Corinne Hollingworth. She has commented, \"the call from the producers couldn't have come at a more opportune moment for me. The soap was suffering from poor ratings and so they decided, as they normally do, to bring some familiar faces back onto the Square. The producers were aware of my addiction by now [...] but they had also read that I was now clean [...] once I assured them that I was well [...] they invited me back for another year.\"<ref name=\"biog\"/> The character's \"dramatic\" return to ''EastEnders'' aired on 25 July 1995 and began when her screen brothers traced Sam to Spain and she ended up in bed with \"bad boy\" [[David Wicks]] ([[Michael French]]).<ref>{{cite news |title=DANNIELLA; My own story|url= https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-61158065|publisher= The People|date=28 January 1996 |accessdate=5 July 2008}}</ref> Several cast changes had occurred since Westbrook had last been in the soap, including a recast of her screen mother Peggy, who was now played by [[Barbara Windsor]]. As well as her former friends, Westbrook has revealed that she became particularly close to Windsor, who she says \"instantly took me under her wing\", and [[Martine McCutcheon]], who played [[Tiffany Mitchell|Tiffany Raymond]].<ref name=\"biog\"/>\n\nThough Westbrook initially enjoyed her time back at the soap, she was unable to keep her working life and private life separate. Off-screen, her partying and drug-use (both in and out of work) began to affect her performance. Her cast mates attempted to curtail the problem. Actors such as Wendy Richard and Mike Reid requested that Westbrook's dressing room be situated near theirs and away from the younger cast, because they could see she was \"vulnerable\". They attempted to talk to her about her drug problem, but Westbrook ignored their concerns and continued using. She has revealed that she became so affected by cocaine that she would continuously mess up her lines, had to do take after take, was constantly late and needed prompts, and spontaneously fell asleep, once even passing out while she stood at the top of the Queen Vic stairs during filming, and was only saved from harming herself by Ross Kemp who caught her in his arms. She has commented, \"When I watch re-runs of those scenes now I can't believe how out of it I look.\" Many of the newer, younger cast members began to shun her, laughing at her and throwing peanuts at her during filming every time she attempted to deliver her lines.<ref name=\"biog\"/> Eventually, the producers tired of Westbrook. She has revealed: \"the producers now had serious doubts about my future on the soap. I was proving to be a liability. My behaviour was interfering with the schedule. It was interfering with other cast members' work. There were days when I just didn't bother showing up for work at all. The dilemma they faced was what to do with me. They had only just written [Sam] back into the soap; now, within months, they were having to write her out of it all over again. They felt bad about getting rid of me, too. I could tell they felt responsible for me but of course ultimately there wasn't much they could do to help [...] Within a couple of weeks I was called into a meeting and told very politely that they were going to let me go early and terminate my contract. They would, they explained, gradually write my character out of the scripts again, which would take a couple of months to do.\"<ref name=\"biog\"/>\n\nIn February 1996, Westbrook's axing was reported in the press. According to press reports, producers had tired of her off-screen antics and were angered that she had appeared on the [[Channel 4]] chat show, ''[[The Girlie Show (Channel 4)|The Girlie Show]]'', and had given away the outcome of a storyline she was involved with, a love-triangle between Sam, Ricky and his new girlfriend [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]). The character departed for Spain on 26 March 1996 after falling for a Spanish tourist.<ref>{{cite news |title=Danniella gets the chop from Albert Square|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61157276.html|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121105091633/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61157276.html|url-status=dead|archive-date= 5 November 2012|publisher= The People|date=4 February 1996 |accessdate=5 July 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Eastender Danniella faces boot|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61279868.html|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121105091746/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61279868.html|url-status=dead|archive-date= 5 November 2012|publisher= Daily Record|date=19 February 1996 |accessdate=5 July 2008}}</ref> Westbrook has since commented, \"The producers were very nice about it all. Rather than killing [Sam] off they sent her to Spain, once again leaving the door open for her to return [...] There was no official line as to why I was leaving, and when the announcement was made [...] they were kind enough to let me say in interviews that I was going because I wanted 'a change of direction'. 'Hopefully, one day I'll return to the show', I told journalists\".<ref name=\"biog\"/>\n\n====1999\u20132000: Second reintroduction and axing====\nIn November 1998, Westbrook revealed to ''[[Hello!]]'' magazine that she was \"desperate\" to return to ''EastEnders'', because she was in need of the money. According to Westbrook, actors [[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]] and [[Barbara Windsor]] who both appeared as [[Frank Butcher|Frank]] and [[Peggy Mitchell|Peggy Butcher]] were keen to have her back on the cast too.<ref>{{cite news |title=Danniella desperate for Albert Square return|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/221695.stm|publisher= BBC News|date=25 November 1998 |accessdate=5 July 2008}}</ref>  Her plea came at a time when executive producer [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]] had already considered bringing Sam back, but because of Westbrook's past problems, he wanted to recast the role to another actress.<ref name=\"nose\">{{cite episode |title=Danniella Westbrook: My Nose and Me|network=[[Channel 4]] |date=31 October 2005}}</ref> However, the BBC's \"Controller of Continuing Drama Series\", [[Mal Young]], thought they were judging Westbrook unfairly, believing a lot of the stories printed about her in the tabloid press.<ref name=\"nose\"/> On his say so, Westbrook was offered another contract to reprise the role of Sam.<ref name=\"nose\"/> In May 1999, Westbrook said, \"It's my dream come true.

Despite Westbrook's claims that her close friend Mike Reid had backed her decision to return, he and other ''EastEnders'' actors later publicly denounced the BBC's decision in a documentary about Westbrook, as they had first hand experience of Westbrook's addiction on set and were concerned for her welfare.<ref name=\"nose\"/> It was reported that Westbrook underwent constant drug tests to keep her job,<ref>{{cite news |title=DANNIELLA FACES DAILY DRUG TESTS AT BEEB|url= https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-60148414|publisher= The People|date=3 October 1999 |accessdate=5 July 2008}}</ref>  but at this time, her excessive use of cocaine had completely eroded away her nasal septum. In order to hide this from the audience, she was only filmed in ways that would keep her septum hidden from view.<ref name=\"nose\"/> However, Westbrook's drug-use continued, and following more press speculation about her private life, the BBC announced in January 2000 that she was being axed from the soap once again.<ref name=\"axed\">{{cite news |title=EastEnder Danniella axed again|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/608290.stm|publisher= The People|date=18 January 2000 |accessdate=5 July 2008}}</ref> A BBC spokesman said: \"Danniella Westbrook's contract has not been renewed.

Sam's departure to north London gives me the chance to explore more opportunities.\" Speaking to London's radio station [[Capital 95.8]], Westbrook denied she had been sacked, saying she decided to leave because she was getting married and she wanted to spend time with her husband.

In the storyline, Sam's mother Peggy (Barbara Windsor) had flown to Spain for the supposed funeral of her former husband and Sam's former father-in-law, Frank Butcher.

Medcalf has revealed that she was extremely nervous when she was informed that she would have to enact love scenes with Kemp, who aside from his part in ''EastEnders'', was renowned to viewers as a member of the 1980s pop band [[Spandau Ballet]].<ref name=\"EErevealed\"/> Speaking about the characters' affair, Medcalf has said, \"Steve Owen basically made a play for her because he was using her to get back at Phil. He knew that Phil would hate it [as] they were rivals. But then, in her defence, he was a charmer, and he managed to keep it all from his wife. He just played the game very well.\"<ref name=\"EErevealed\"/> The relationship ended in \"tragedy\" when Steve, in an attempt to kidnap Phil's daughter [[Louise Mitchell|Louise]], was killed in a road accident. Medcalf has suggested that Sam was \"devastated\" by Steve's death: \"She fell for [his game] hook, line and sinker. She really believed that he was going to be the man.\"<ref name=\"EErevealed\"/> She subsequently moved on to her former lover Beppe di Marco, but according to Medcalf, that relationship finished because Beppe \"thought [Sam] was a bit full on [...] she was so desperate for a relationship that I think it just scared [Beppe].\"<ref name=\"EErevealed\"/> Another fling followed with abusive [[Trevor Morgan (EastEnders)|Trevor Morgan]], played by [[Alex Ferns]].

In the storyline, Sam had been left in charge of the various Mitchell business and properties, and Andy, sensing an opportunity to gain control of these assets, proposed to Sam. According to Medcalf, Sam needed the marriage because she was \"vulnerable\". She added, \"Andy is tough and she craves someone to look after her.

DO NOT ADD ANY OTHERS -->\n}}\n'''Samantha Margaret Priscilla Mitchell''' (also '''Butcher''' and '''Hunter'''), better known as '''Sam Mitchell''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]''. The third member of the Mitchell family to be introduced, Sam enters as a 15-year-old school girl in July 1990, played by [[Danniella Westbrook]]. Westbrook quit in 1993, but Sam was reintroduced from 1995\u20131996 and from 1999\u20132000. In both her 1996 and 2000 exits, Sam was written out earlier than the producers intended due to off-screen controversies surrounding Westbrook and her [[cocaine]] addiction. In 2002, the character was reintroduced for a fourth time, but the role was recast to another actress, [[Kim Medcalf]]. Medcalf left the role in 2005. In an interview with [[Paul O'Grady]], Medcalf said she would 'never say never' to a comeback. However, when executive producer [[Diederick Santer]] decided to reintroduce the character for a brief stint in 2009, he opted to bring Westbrook back. The character returned in September 2009 for a short stint and departed in January 2010. Sam returned for another short stint from August until September. In 2016, Westbrook agreed to reprise the role once again in 2016 for her on-screen mother, [[Peggy Mitchell]]'s ([[Barbara Windsor]]) funeral, a brief stint, starting on 30 June 2016 and concluding after four episodes on 8 July 2016.\n\nPortrayed as headstrong, flirty and manipulative, early storylines featuring Sam concentrate on her teen elopement to the character [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]). She goes on to feature in storylines about topless modelling, various family crises including being conned into selling her family's businesses to lawyer [[Marcus Christie]] ([[Stephen Churchett]]) and husband Andy, as well as being framed by her family for her uncle [[Archie Mitchell]] ([[Larry Lamb]])'s murder (see [[Who Killed Archie?]]), relationships with [[David Wicks]] ([[Michael French]]), [[Beppe di Marco]] ([[Michael Greco (actor)|Michael Greco]]), [[Steve Owen (EastEnders)|Steve Owen]] ([[Martin Kemp]]), [[Trevor Morgan (EastEnders)|Trevor Morgan]] ([[Alex Ferns]]), [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]) and [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]), feuds with [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]), [[Mel Owen]] ([[Tamzin Outhwaite]]), [[Chrissie Watts]] ([[Tracy Ann Oberman|Tracy-Ann Oberman]]), [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]) and [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]), and a short-lived marriage to [[Andy Hunter (EastEnders)|Andy Hunter]] ([[Michael Higgs]]). Her exit storyline in 2005 is the culmination of a high-profile storyline that sees the character wrongly imprisoned for [[Den Watts]]' ([[Leslie Grantham]]) murder. In the on-screen events, Sam is cleared of murder and released, but she flees the country to escape another prison sentence for perverting the course of justice. Her brief return in 2009 sees the character resurrect a relationship with Ricky whilst having an on-off affair with [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]), being manipulated by her uncle Archie and causing her family to lose a number of their businesses for a second time before finally going to prison. Her returns in 2010 and 2016 sees her struggle with motherhood after giving birth to Jack's baby, [[Ricky Mitchell|Ricky]] (Henri Charles).\n\n==Storylines==\n\n===Backstory===\nSam is the youngest child and only daughter of [[Peggy Mitchell|Peggy]] ([[Jo Warne]]/[[Barbara Windsor]]) and Eric Mitchell. Eric died when Sam was ten and she was subsequently on the receiving end of her older brothers',  [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant]]'s ([[Ross Kemp]]), heavy-handed paternalism.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sam Mitchell|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters/sam_m_biog.shtml|publisher= BBC|accessdate=5 July 2008|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20010811130832/http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters/sam_m_biog.shtml|archivedate= 11 August 2001}}</ref>\n\n===1990\u20132000===\nFifteen-year-old Sam follows her brothers to Walford in July 1990, unhappy at home because she dislikes their mother's boyfriend, [[Kevin Masters (EastEnders)|Kevin Masters]] ([[Colin McCormack]]). She becomes friends with [[Hattie Tavernier]] ([[Michelle Gayle]]) and dates [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]). Sam's family disapproves of the relationship, so Ricky and Sam decide to elope to [[Gretna Green]] in 1991; they marry despite the Mitchells trying to stop the nuptials. Peggy admits defeat and attends their more formal blessing in Walford a month later.\n\nSam fails to earn schooling qualifications, but she gains attention because of her looks after winning the title of \"Miss Queen Vic\" at the local public house; she starts to believe she can have a career modelling, but when she attempts to get a portfolio done by a professional photographer, he persuades her to do a topless shoot and the photos are then published in a pornographic magazine. This causes problems in Ricky and Sam's relationship, which is already under strain as Ricky is unable to provide Sam with the luxurious lifestyle she desires. After just a year of marriage, Sam grows bored and begins lusting after a [[playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]] named Clive ([[Sean Gallagher (actor)|Sean Gallagher]]) whom she meets at a New Year's Eve party with her friend [[Mandy Salter]] ([[Nicola Stapleton]]). After having a brief affair, Sam thinks she has fallen in love with Clive, but he makes it clear that he is only interested in sex when he tries to coax her into having a [[threesome]]. Realising that her marriage with Ricky is over, Sam leaves her husband and Walford in 1993 to take a job as a holiday rep on a cruise ship.\n\nSam returns in 1995, after her brothers, on a boys holiday in [[Spain]], catch her in bed with [[David Wicks]] ([[Michael French]]), and force her to return. Sam had tried to build herself a career as a [[model (person)|model]], but it had not gone to plan and she had ended up working as a hostess in a bar. Back in Walford Sam tries to continue her fling with David and when this goes nowhere she tries to come between Ricky and his girlfriend, [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]). Initially, Ricky thinks he still has feelings for Sam, but eventually realises he is better off with Bianca and tries to let Sam down gently. However Sam won't take no for an answer and purposefully kisses an innocent Ricky in front of Bianca, causing them to split. Despite this, Ricky will not reconsider getting back with Sam and opts to try to make amends with Bianca. Sam is forced to admit defeat. Soon after, she meets a Spanish man named Guillermo, who is holidaying in England. When he invites her to join him in Spain she leaps at the chance and leaves Walford again in March 1996.\n\nIn 1999, Sam decides that she wants to settle down in Walford once more. During this time she embarks on a stormy relationship with [[Beppe di Marco]] ([[Michael Greco (actor)|Michael Greco]]), but she takes things more seriously than he does. After he finishes the relationship, a heartbroken Sam looks for comfort elsewhere. She turns to local club owner and Phil's adversary [[Steve Owen (EastEnders)|Steve Owen]] ([[Martin Kemp]]) for support, but he is only using her to make his girlfriend [[Mel Owen|Mel Healy]] ([[Tamzin Outhwaite]]) jealous \u2013 so a hurt Sam decides to leave Walford once again in 2000.\n\n===2002\u20132005===\nIn 2002, Peggy catches Sam working in a lap-dancing club in Spain. Ashamed and penniless, Sam returns to Walford with her mother and has a brief relationship with Steve until the latter's death at the start of March 2002. She then proceeds to have numerous flings with her cousin [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]) and Phil's archenemies, [[Trevor Morgan (EastEnders)|Trevor Morgan]] ([[Alex Ferns]]) and [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]), respectively \u2013 as well briefly having a relationship with her ex-lovers Beppe and Ricky. All of whom soon turn out to be using her to varying degrees. One night, whilst working in the pub, Sam is nearly raped by [[Dave Roberts (EastEnders)|Dave Roberts]] ([[David Kennedy (actor)|David Kennedy]]). She manages to fight Dave off and escape the pub. Sam soon begins flirting with Dennis' illegitimate father, [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]), but is left humiliated after he sacks her from her job at his family's club.\n\nAnimosity between the Watts and Mitchell families escalates. Sam is left in charge of the Mitchell empire when her brother, Phil, goes on the run after escaping prison for an armed robbery \u2014 for which he has been set up for by Den. Sam persuades Billy to torch Phil's snooker club in an insurance scam, an act that results in Den's club burning down and his daughter [[Vicki Fowler|Vicki]] ([[Scarlett Johnson]]) nearly perishing in the fire. Dennis vows revenge and he is only warned off when his friend [[Andy Hunter (EastEnders)|Andy Hunter]] ([[Michael Higgs]]), the local crime kingpin of Walford, begins a relationship with Sam. They soon marry in September 2004,<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Rupert |title=''EastEnders'': 20 Years in Albert Square |year= 2005|publisher=BBC Books |location=London |isbn=978-0-563-52165-5 |page=199}}</ref> despite Sam's crush [[Minty Peterson]] ([[Cliff Parisi]]) attempting to stop the wedding \u2014 he has fallen in love with Sam and knows that Andy is only using her to gain control of the Mitchell assets. Andy fools Sam into signing over control of Phil's house, and she is then conned out of all the Mitchell businesses by family lawyer [[Marcus Christie]] ([[Stephen Churchett]]) and Den. Marcus tells Sam that Phil wants her to sell everything and give the cash to him. She does so, selling her mother's [[public house]], [[The Queen Victoria]], for a vastly reduced price to Den. Marcus is lying, and once he has the Mitchells' money, he flees, leaving Sam with nothing. Andy, realising Sam is no use to him, throws her out of their house \u2013 leaving her penniless.\n\nWhilst trying to move on from her marriage with Andy, with the couple clashing with each other on several occasions, Sam becomes determined to get revenge on Den; she teams up with his wife [[Chrissie Watts|Chrissie]] ([[Tracy Ann Oberman]]) and their neighbour [[Zoe Slater]] ([[Michelle Ryan]]) -  who herself had become a victim of Den as a result of her relationship with Dennis - to carry out their vengeful plot against Den. On the night of Den's wedding anniversary to his late wife [[Angie Watts|Angie]] ([[Anita Dobson]]), the three women confront him at The Queen Vic shortly after he closes up. At first Den taunts Sam and her unlikely conspirators over their weakness, but it soon turns out that Den's adoptive daughter [[Sharon Watts|Sharon]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) was overhearing the whole conversation; Chrissie had planned for Sharon to return to Albert Square so that she can overhear Den admit to his misdeeds and disown him in response, thus ridding Den of the woman he devoted as his daughter \u2013 and henceforth exacting revenge upon Den for what he did. This works successfully, and Sam even congratulates Chrissie for getting payback on Den \u2013 telling her \"You're quite a bitch, ain't ya!\". However, shortly after Sharon leaves Walford, Den returns to The Queen Vic and the event takes an unexpected and violent turn: Den suddenly attacks Chrissie and Zoe hits him over the head with [[Pauline Fowler]]'s ([[Wendy Richard]]) iron doorstop in defence, all the while Sam watches in shock. This is thought to have killed him; however, when Zoe and Sam leave the room, Den grabs Chrissie's ankle and she responds by hitting him on the head a second time \u2013 finally killing him. In the moment where Chrissie kills Den, however, Sam witnesses this and she later grows appalled when Chrissie allows Zoe to believe that her blow killed Den. As Chrissie has possession of The Queen Vic following Den's death, Sam blackmails her \u2013 threatening to unveil Chrissie as Den's killer unless she gives her the pub.\n\nOn the day after Den's murder, to which the square is unaware about yet, Sam is surprised to learn that Andy has died on the same night; Andy was murdered by his gangland rival [[Johnny Allen (EastEnders)|Johnny Allen]] ([[Billy Murray (actor)|Billy Murray]]) after attempting to con him out of \u00a3750,000. In the events of Andy's funeral, Sam smugly attends his will meeting; she meets up with his solicitor and expects to receive all his money and assets. She promises to let Pat keep her job at the bookies, but inadvertently insults her by offering her cleaning work at the house. Sam is confused, however, when she is told that Andy had created a new will and is later stunned when Andy leaves the house to [[Pat Butcher|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St Clement]]) and the bookies to Dennis \u2013 whilst giving his and Sam's money to a dog's trust. She is further horrified when he leaves her nothing but a wedding ring and states \"so she can sell it, get her roots done and still be the dumbest blonde I ever knew.\" \u2013 much to Pat's amusement. As she struggles to move on from Andy and their turbulent marriage, with Minty and his friend [[Danny Moon]] ([[Jake Maskall]]) comforting her over the situation, Sam learns that Chrissie is attempting to sell the pub and leave Walford. She soon begins drinking heavily and, determined to expose Chrissie as Den's killer, smashes up Den's grave and digs him up. Unfortunately for her, the plan backfires; all evidence points to Sam, who is charged with murder and remanded in custody. When Peggy returns to the square and learns about Sam's recent troubles, she visits her and Sam tells Peggy that Chrissie killed Den. Upon believing Sam, an outraged Peggy later confronts Chrissie at Den's funeral and smacks her onto his coffin \u2013 vowing to prove Sam's innocence. In attempting to secure Sam's release and expose Chrissie as Den's killer, Peggy starts a feud with Chrissie and later forms a conflict with Johnny when he and Chrissie build a partnership; with Peggy also resenting Johnny for the way how she treated her late husband and Sam's father Eric. Just as it appears that Peggy is unable to find a way of proving Sam's innocence, Phil and Grant return to Walford to secure her release. Eventually, with help from Sharon and Dennis \u2013 who end up learning the truth about their father's murder \u2013 the Mitchells are finally able to prevent Johnny from destroying the videotape of Chrissie confessing Den's murder to her boyfriend, Danny's brother [[Jake Moon]] ([[Joel Beckett]]); the police are given the tape and they end up arresting Chrissie at the airport for Den's murder. Sam is later released from custody; however, she still faces a charge of [[perverting the course of justice]] and faces a prison sentence up to four years. This prospect is too daunting for Sam, and she flees to [[Brazil]] while on bail in 2005.\n\n===2009\u20132016===\nIn 2009, Phil sends Ricky to Brazil on an errand where he meets Sam,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a174376/picture-sam-mitchells-going-for-a-thong.html|title=Picture: Sam Mitchell's going for a thong|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=29 August 2009|accessdate=2 September 2009}}</ref> and she returns to London using a fake passport. She immediately causes a stir by drawing attention to herself and reignites her feud with Bianca. The Mitchells try to keep her hidden, but Bianca, jealous of Ricky's renewed feelings for Sam, calls the police. Sam is arrested while trying to flee but is released on bail when [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]) pays the surety. Sam and Ricky get engaged, but Sam has an affair with [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]). Peggy's estranged husband, [[Archie Mitchell]] ([[Larry Lamb]]), uses Sam as a pawn in his plan to destroy the Mitchells, persuading her to jump bail again and leave the country to escape a prison sentence, so Archie can successfully steal The Queen Vic from Peggy. Sam opts to stay so Archie tells Bianca about Sam and Jack's affair; she tells Ricky and after a showdown, Ricky ends the engagement. Following this, Sam takes Archie's money and flees, causing the Mitchells to lose the pub. She returns to Walford on Christmas Day 2009, hoping to make amends. On that same day, Archie is murdered (see [[Who Killed Archie?]]) and Sam becomes one of the suspects. Phil, Peggy and Ronnie also have motives, and in order to stop the police framing them, they decide Sam should take the blame and leave the country. Sam overhears their plan and furious, turns herself in, implicating Peggy in Archie's murder for revenge. Sam is arrested and sentenced to 18 months in prison. When Peggy attempts to visit, Sam is hostile, rejecting her mother and disowning the Mitchell name.\n\nLater in 2010, Peggy visits Sam in prison and discovers she is heavily pregnant. Sam does not know if Ricky or Jack is the father and she refuses to reconcile with Peggy; however when she is hospitalised and goes into labour, she reconsiders, requesting Peggy's help. Sam gives birth to a boy, [[Ricky Mitchell|Richard]], but announces she is giving him up for adoption. She only reconsiders as a means to reconcile with Ricky; she returns to Walford having completed her prison sentence, but struggles as a parent and relies heavily on Peggy and Minty. Ricky and Jack pester Sam to a get a paternity test, which she eventually does. She lies, claiming Ricky is the father, however Bianca discovers the truth and Sam confesses that she has lied because Ronnie, Jack's girlfriend, asked her to. Ronnie does not want Sam or her baby near Jack. She manipulates Sam into leaving and pays her money to do so. Sam leaves but, fearful of bringing up her baby alone, she seduces Minty, who still loves her, suggesting he goes with her. Minty momentarily accepts, but then realises Sam is merely using him and turns her down. Sam departs with Richard, moving to Portugal to live with Grant.\n\nAlmost six years later, Sam returns to Walford alongside Richard, now nicknamed Ricky (Henri Charles), in June 2016, to attend Peggy's funeral. She reveals that Grant is not attending and winds up Sharon about Grant, causing Sharon to reveal that she and Grant had kissed. Jack decides that he wants to see Ricky so Sam drops him at the Brannings. After the funeral, Sam gets drunk and Phil harshly confronts her causing her to leave the pub. Sam reveals to her cousin [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]) that she is struggling to look after Ricky and that he is better off with Jack. Sam abandons Ricky at Jack's house and leaves in the back of a taxi.\n\n==Creation and development==\n\n===Casting===\nThe character Sam Mitchell was introduced in July 1990 by ''EastEnders''' executive producer [[Michael Ferguson (director)|Michael Ferguson]] as the young sister of the Mitchell brothers, [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant]] ([[Ross Kemp]]). Sam was one of several characters introduced by the producer in the summer of 1990. Others included [[Eddie Royle]] ([[Michael Melia]]), and three generations of the [[Celestine Tavernier|Tavernier]] family.<ref name=\"10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref>\n\nAs the casting team had successfully cast the actors who were playing Sam's brothers, they already knew what facial attributes they needed for Sam to create a similar family resemblance. Producer [[Corinne Hollingworth]] has commented, \"we'd decided on Steve [McFadden] and Ross [Kemp] and we knew the sort of round, open face we needed. We saw Danniella (Westbrook) first and liked her, then saw some others, but came back to her.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\">{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= The EastEnders Handbook |year=1990|publisher=BBC books|isbn=978-0-563-36292-0|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> The actress, a graduate of the Sylvia Young Theatre School, had already appeared in the soap aged 11, as an extra who rollerskated across the soap's fictional setting of [[Albert Square]] in front of the characters [[Den Watts|Den]] and [[Angie Watts]]. At the time, Westbrook's local paper ran a story on her with the punchline, \"who knows, one day she might be the show's star\".<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Eighty girls auditioned for the part of Sam, but these eighty were eventually whittled down to four.<ref name=\"biog\">{{cite book|last=Westbrook|first= Danniella|title=The Other Side of Nowhere|year=2006|publisher=Hodder|isbn=978-0-340-89887-1}}</ref> On her final casting callback, Westbrook bumped into actors [[Michelle Gayle]] and [[Sid Owen]], who were already on the ''EastEnders'' cast as [[Hattie Tavernier]] and [[Ricky Butcher]] respectively. Westbrook already knew Gayle, whose character was to be Sam's screen best friend, and she introduced her to Owen, whose character was scripted to be Sam's boyfriend.<ref name=\"biog\"/> According to Westbrook, she liked Owen right from the start and was amused by his response of \"You're a bit of alright. You can be Sam!\". On Westbrook's last audition, she and the other hopefuls were forced to stand for a lengthy period in front of a panel of the show's producers, directors and writers while they continuously compared images of the auditionees to images of Kemp and McFadden, looking for a resemblance.<ref name=\"biog\"/> Westbrook was given the part. She has commented, \"they told me they were looking for someone bright and bubbly, who could be the sister of Phil and Grant, and my round face fitted.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> In the character's first scene, Sam walked past Ricky Butcher and gave him a \"flirty backward glance\", causing him to walk into a lamp-post.<ref name=\"biog\"/> Westbrook was initially given a three-month contract with the soap, but halfway through her contract the producers extended it as they felt \"the character of Sam had gelled well with the others and they wanted to include her in more storylines\".<ref name=\"biog\"/>\n\nWestbrook has said that the cast and crew became like a second family to her, with the roles in the soap mirroring their relationships off-screen. In her autobiography she comments, \"Sid [Owen] and I became very close [...] we were as thick as thieves. When we weren't shooting together we'd hang out [...] Once Sid and I got so bored hanging around on set that we decided to take the milk float for a spin around Albert Square, but Sid drove it too fast and turned it over [...] we couldn't stop laughing, but the producers didn't seem to share our amusement. We were seriously told off that day.\"<ref name=\"biog\"/> She has described other actors like Michelle Gayle, [[Letitia Dean]], [[Adam Woodyatt]] and [[Nick Berry]] like brothers and sisters, and has said she was very close to older cast members such as [[June Brown]], [[Wendy Richard]], [[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]] and [[Gillian Taylforth]]. She has also revealed that her off-screen relationship with actors McFadden and Kemp mirrored her character's on-screen one: \"In the soap they were my older brothers, always looking out for me, making sure I didn't get into trouble, and off set they were exactly the same.\"<ref name=\"biog\"/>\n\n===Personality and characterisation===\nThe character has been described by Hilary Kingsley, author the ''EastEnders Handbook'', as a \"tease [...] a pretty girl who thinks she can get anything she wants, thanks to her own brand of sexy wheedling.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> She adds that Sam is \"a lot sharper than her brothers [...] and contrives to do just what she wants in the face of their attempts to stand in for their dead father [...] Sam loves excitement and doesn't frighten easily. She's a user, able to get almost anyone to do what she wants.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Kate Lock, author of ''EastEnders Who's Who'', has described Sam as \"Headstrong, streetwise and pretty [...] a chip off the old Mitchell block, though her methods of manipulation are marginally more subtle than [her brothers]. One bat of a sooty eyelash is enough to charm most men into submission and she can wind doting mum Peggy round her little finger [...] [when] she returned to the Square [in 1999], Sam had lost her kittenish cuteness and hardened up, becoming more EastEnd moll than Barbie doll.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Lock |first= Kate|title=EastEnders Who's Who |year=2000|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-55178-2|title-link= EastEnders books}}</ref>\n\nDescribing the character in 2002, actress [[Kim Medcalf]] said, \"She wears her heart on her sleeve. She so wants to settle down that she doesn't select men well. She goes for people too quickly. She likes the danger aspect \u2014 the thrill of the chase. She loves guys with a dangerous edge [...] She's had a tough upbringing. She didn't know her dad and her older brothers bossed her around. She needed to find herself and has done it by being independent and going away.

Westbrook has said that within days of her first appearance, the interest in the character was \"phenomenal\": \"The public couldn't get enough of the simmering relationship between Ricky and Sam and the show was inundated with calls from the press [...] [Sam and Ricky] were involved in a plotline about under-age sex, so the press swooped in on that.\"<ref name=\"biog\"/>\n\nTo the anger of her family, Sam persuaded Ricky to elope to Gretna Green in July 1991. The week's worth of episodes focusing on their marriage were filmed on-location and have been described by former ''EastEnders'' scriptwriter, [[Colin Brake]], as a \"farce-like chase round the country\". Written by Debbie Cook, the storyline saw Ricky and Sam's families, including Sam's mother [[Peggy Mitchell|Peggy]] ([[Jo Warne]]; introduced specifically for this plotline) attempting to stop the couple getting married. The storyline climaxed in a registry office wedding, but despite the Scottish setting, the recording of the episodes took place in [[Hertfordshire]].<ref name=\"10years\"/> Later in the month, Sam and Ricky had a more official \"grand church blessing\" with their families in attendance. The Butchers' blessing was screened in the same episode as the funeral of another character, [[Charlie Cotton]].<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/>\n\nThe marriage was portrayed as problematic, fraught with interference from their families, lack of money, and Ricky's jealousy of Sam's partying and modelling career, including a topless photo shoot. The serial made use of Sam's appearance in various storylines, including a \"Miss Queen Vic\" [[public house]] competition in an episode that aired in April 1992 \u2014 despite the Mitchell brothers attempts' to fix the competition, the honest winner was Sam. Written by [[Tony Jordan]], Colin Brake describes it as one of 1992's most memorable episodes.<ref name=\"10years\"/> However, off-screen Westbrook was battling with various problems in her personal life (including a highly publicised drug addiction), and in 1993 she left the soap, although she maintains that her addiction did not affect her work at this time.<ref>{{cite news |title=The digested read: The Other Side of Nowhere by Daniella Westbrook|url= https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-61158065|publisher= Guardian|date=3 April 2006 |accessdate=8 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn-screen, Sam's marriage to Ricky ended following an affair with a yuppie named Clive ([[Sean Gallagher (actor)|Sean Gallagher]]), and she took a job on a cruise ship. Commenting on her initial departure, Westbrook has said, \"My contract was up for renewal and I thought it was time for me to move on [...] As much as I enjoyed being in ''EastEnders'' [...] I was also well aware of the fact that I was in danger of being type-cast forever if I carried on playing Sam. The producers didn't have a problem with me leaving. It was felt that my character had done as much as she could in the space of three years, anyway. During that time Sam had, after all, been involved in a story about under-age sex, run off to Gretna Green to marry Ricky, been evicted from her home, become a squatter, tried her luck as a topless model, fought on a regular basis with Grant and Phil, and gone through a marriage break-up. I think we all agreed that the poor girl was in need of a break [...] In January 1993 I filmed my final scenes and Sam Mitchell, in true ''EastEnders'' style, waved goodbye to Albert Square from the back of a London taxi cab [...] Although the producers agreed that it was the right time for my character to move on, they wanted to keep the door open for her to return at a later date, as they knew how popular the Mitchell family were with viewers. I was really pleased that they decided not to kill the character off\".<ref name=\"biog\"/> Her departure scenes aired on 4 February 1993.\n\n====1995\u20131996: Reintroduction and axing====\nIn 1995, following a spell in a drug rehab clinic, which first alerted the public to her drug problem, Westbrook was reintroduced into ''EastEnders'' by executive producer Corinne Hollingworth. She has commented, \"the call from the producers couldn't have come at a more opportune moment for me. The soap was suffering from poor ratings and so they decided, as they normally do, to bring some familiar faces back onto the Square. The producers were aware of my addiction by now [...] but they had also read that I was now clean [...] once I assured them that I was well [...] they invited me back for another year.\"<ref name=\"biog\"/> The character's \"dramatic\" return to ''EastEnders'' aired on 25 July 1995 and began when her screen brothers traced Sam to Spain and she ended up in bed with \"bad boy\" [[David Wicks]] ([[Michael French]]).<ref>{{cite news |title=DANNIELLA; My own story|url= https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-61158065|publisher= The People|date=28 January 1996 |accessdate=5 July 2008}}</ref> Several cast changes had occurred since Westbrook had last been in the soap, including a recast of her screen mother Peggy, who was now played by [[Barbara Windsor]]. As well as her former friends, Westbrook has revealed that she became particularly close to Windsor, who she says \"instantly took me under her wing\", and [[Martine McCutcheon]], who played [[Tiffany Mitchell|Tiffany Raymond]].<ref name=\"biog\"/>\n\nThough Westbrook initially enjoyed her time back at the soap, she was unable to keep her working life and private life separate. Off-screen, her partying and drug-use (both in and out of work) began to affect her performance. Her cast mates attempted to curtail the problem. Actors such as Wendy Richard and Mike Reid requested that Westbrook's dressing room be situated near theirs and away from the younger cast, because they could see she was \"vulnerable\". They attempted to talk to her about her drug problem, but Westbrook ignored their concerns and continued using. She has revealed that she became so affected by cocaine that she would continuously mess up her lines, had to do take after take, was constantly late and needed prompts, and spontaneously fell asleep, once even passing out while she stood at the top of the Queen Vic stairs during filming, and was only saved from harming herself by Ross Kemp who caught her in his arms. She has commented, \"When I watch re-runs of those scenes now I can't believe how out of it I look.\" Many of the newer, younger cast members began to shun her, laughing at her and throwing peanuts at her during filming every time she attempted to deliver her lines.<ref name=\"biog\"/> Eventually, the producers tired of Westbrook. She has revealed: \"the producers now had serious doubts about my future on the soap. I was proving to be a liability. My behaviour was interfering with the schedule. It was interfering with other cast members' work. There were days when I just didn't bother showing up for work at all. The dilemma they faced was what to do with me. They had only just written [Sam] back into the soap; now, within months, they were having to write her out of it all over again. They felt bad about getting rid of me, too. I could tell they felt responsible for me but of course ultimately there wasn't much they could do to help [...] Within a couple of weeks I was called into a meeting and told very politely that they were going to let me go early and terminate my contract. They would, they explained, gradually write my character out of the scripts again, which would take a couple of months to do.\"<ref name=\"biog\"/>\n\nIn February 1996, Westbrook's axing was reported in the press. According to press reports, producers had tired of her off-screen antics and were angered that she had appeared on the [[Channel 4]] chat show, ''[[The Girlie Show (Channel 4)|The Girlie Show]]'', and had given away the outcome of a storyline she was involved with, a love-triangle between Sam, Ricky and his new girlfriend [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]). The character departed for Spain on 26 March 1996 after falling for a Spanish tourist.<ref>{{cite news |title=Danniella gets the chop from Albert Square|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61157276.html|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121105091633/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61157276.html|url-status=dead|archive-date= 5 November 2012|publisher= The People|date=4 February 1996 |accessdate=5 July 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Eastender Danniella faces boot|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61279868.html|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121105091746/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61279868.html|url-status=dead|archive-date= 5 November 2012|publisher= Daily Record|date=19 February 1996 |accessdate=5 July 2008}}</ref> Westbrook has since commented, \"The producers were very nice about it all. Rather than killing [Sam] off they sent her to Spain, once again leaving the door open for her to return [...] There was no official line as to why I was leaving, and when the announcement was made [...] they were kind enough to let me say in interviews that I was going because I wanted 'a change of direction'. 'Hopefully, one day I'll return to the show', I told journalists\".<ref name=\"biog\"/>\n\n====1999\u20132000: Second reintroduction and axing====\nIn November 1998, Westbrook revealed to ''[[Hello!]]'' magazine that she was \"desperate\" to return to ''EastEnders'', because she was in need of the money. According to Westbrook, actors [[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]] and [[Barbara Windsor]] who both appeared as [[Frank Butcher|Frank]] and [[Peggy Mitchell|Peggy Butcher]] were keen to have her back on the cast too.<ref>{{cite news |title=Danniella desperate for Albert Square return|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/221695.stm|publisher= BBC News|date=25 November 1998 |accessdate=5 July 2008}}</ref>  Her plea came at a time when executive producer [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]] had already considered bringing Sam back, but because of Westbrook's past problems, he wanted to recast the role to another actress.<ref name=\"nose\">{{cite episode |title=Danniella Westbrook: My Nose and Me|network=[[Channel 4]] |date=31 October 2005}}</ref> However, the BBC's \"Controller of Continuing Drama Series\", [[Mal Young]], thought they were judging Westbrook unfairly, believing a lot of the stories printed about her in the tabloid press.<ref name=\"nose\"/> On his say so, Westbrook was offered another contract to reprise the role of Sam.<ref name=\"nose\"/> In May 1999, Westbrook said, \"It's my dream come true.

Despite Westbrook's claims that her close friend Mike Reid had backed her decision to return, he and other ''EastEnders'' actors later publicly denounced the BBC's decision in a documentary about Westbrook, as they had first hand experience of Westbrook's addiction on set and were concerned for her welfare.<ref name=\"nose\"/> It was reported that Westbrook underwent constant drug tests to keep her job,<ref>{{cite news |title=DANNIELLA FACES DAILY DRUG TESTS AT BEEB|url= https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-60148414|publisher= The People|date=3 October 1999 |accessdate=5 July 2008}}</ref>  but at this time, her excessive use of cocaine had completely eroded away her nasal septum. In order to hide this from the audience, she was only filmed in ways that would keep her septum hidden from view.<ref name=\"nose\"/> However, Westbrook's drug-use continued, and following more press speculation about her private life, the BBC announced in January 2000 that she was being axed from the soap once again.<ref name=\"axed\">{{cite news |title=EastEnder Danniella axed again|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/608290.stm|publisher= The People|date=18 January 2000 |accessdate=5 July 2008}}</ref> A BBC spokesman said: \"Danniella Westbrook's contract has not been renewed. Her character Sam Mitchell will move to north London, leaving the door open for her to return in the future.\" Westbrook added: \"I will always love working on ''EastEnders'', especially with the cast. Sam's departure to north London gives me the chance to explore more opportunities.\" Speaking to London's radio station [[Capital 95.8]], Westbrook denied she had been sacked, saying she decided to leave because she was getting married and she wanted to spend time with her husband.

What I basically did was to read a prepared, detailed biography of the character which was provided by the production office. I did sit down to watch a five-minute clip of Danniella but I quickly realised I didn't want to carry on watching because I was afraid of falling into doing an imitation of her, d'ye know what I mean? I'll tell you something weird-when I first started getting the scripts I used to hear the lines first in my head with HER voice saying them! But that changed over time, thank God, as I hopefully made the character my own and I gave her my voice.\" Medcalf added that contrastingly to Westbrook, who played Sam as a young girl who was overprotected by her brothers and sheltered, she played Sam as a young woman \"trying to find her place both in a career and in relationships with the opposite sex.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=BEWITCHED BY KIM: The Actress Who Plays the New 'Sam'|url=http://www.wgazette.com/sum03-kim.html|publisher= Walford Gazette|accessdate=16 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe character was reintroduced in January 2002 in a set of episodes filmed on-location in Spain. In the storyline, Sam's mother Peggy (Barbara Windsor) had flown to Spain for the supposed funeral of her former husband and Sam's former father-in-law, Frank Butcher. Here she found Sam, who was working as a table dancer in a nightclub; Peggy brought Sam back to Walford.

Medcalf has revealed that she was extremely nervous when she was informed that she would have to enact love scenes with Kemp, who aside from his part in ''EastEnders'', was renowned to viewers as a member of the 1980s pop band [[Spandau Ballet]].<ref name=\"EErevealed\"/> Speaking about the characters' affair, Medcalf has said, \"Steve Owen basically made a play for her because he was using her to get back at Phil. He knew that Phil would hate it [as] they were rivals. But then, in her defence, he was a charmer, and he managed to keep it all from his wife. He just played the game very well.\"<ref name=\"EErevealed\"/> The relationship ended in \"tragedy\" when Steve, in an attempt to kidnap Phil's daughter [[Louise Mitchell|Louise]], was killed in a road accident. Medcalf has suggested that Sam was \"devastated\" by Steve's death: \"She fell for [his game] hook, line and sinker. She really believed that he was going to be the man.\"<ref name=\"EErevealed\"/> She subsequently moved on to her former lover Beppe di Marco, but according to Medcalf, that relationship finished because Beppe \"thought [Sam] was a bit full on [...] she was so desperate for a relationship that I think it just scared [Beppe].\"<ref name=\"EErevealed\"/> Another fling followed with abusive [[Trevor Morgan (EastEnders)|Trevor Morgan]], played by [[Alex Ferns]].

External symmetry can be easily seen by just looking at an organism. For example, take the face of a human being which has a plane of symmetry down its centre, or a pine cone with a clear symmetrical spiral pattern. Internal features can also show symmetry, for example the tubes in the human body (responsible for transporting [[gas]]es, [[nutrients]], and waste products) which are [[cylindrical]] and have several planes of symmetry. \n\nBiological symmetry can be thought of as a balanced distribution of duplicate body parts or shapes within the body of an organism. Importantly, unlike in mathematics, symmetry in biology is always approximate. For example, plant leaves \u2013 while considered symmetrical \u2013 rarely match up exactly when folded in half. Symmetry is one class of [[patterns in nature|patterns]] in nature whereby there is near-repetition of the pattern element, either by [[reflection (geometry)|reflection]] or [[rotation (geometry)|rotation]].\n\nWhile [[sponges]] and [[placozoans]] represent two groups of animals which don't show any symmetry (i.e. are asymmetrical), the [[body plan]]s of most [[multicellular organism]]s exhibit, and are defined by, some form of symmetry. There are only a few types of symmetry which are possible in body plans. These are [[rotational symmetry|radial]] (cylindrical), [[reflection symmetry|bilateral]], biradial and [[circular symmetry|spherical]] symmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Holl\u00f3 |first1=G\u00e1bor |title=A new paradigm for animal symmetry |journal=Interface Focus |date=2015 |volume=5 |pages=20150032 |doi=10.1098/rsfs.2015.0032}}</ref> While the classification of [[viruses]] as an 'organism' remains controversial, viruses also contain [[Icosahedral symmetry|icosahedral symmetry]].\n\nThe importance of symmetry is illustrated by the fact that groups of animals have traditionally been defined by this feature in [[Taxonomy (biology)| taxonomic]] groupings. The [[Radiata]], animals with radial symmetry, formed one of the four branches of [[Georges Cuvier]]'s classification of the [[animal]] [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=McBirney |first1=Alexander |title=Georges Cuvier.

Typically, this involves repeating a body part 4, 5, 6 or 8 times around the axis - referred to as tetramerism, pentamerism, hexamerism and octomerism, respectively. Such organisms exhibits no left or right sides but do have a top and a bottom surface, or a front and a back.\n\nGeorge Cuvier classified animals with radial symmetry in the taxon Radiata (''Zoophytes''),<ref>{{cite web |last1=Waggoner |first1=Ben M. |title=Georges Cuvier (1769-1832) |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/cuvier.html |publisher=UCMP Berkeley |accessdate=8 March 2018 |quote=Cuvier's insistence on the functional integration of organisms led him to classify animals into four \"branches,\" or embranchements: Vertebrata, Articulata (arthropods and segmented worms), Mollusca (which at the time meant all other soft, bilaterally symmetrical invertebrates), and Radiata (cnidarians and echinoderms).}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cuvier |first1=Georges |author1link=Georges Cuvier |last2=Griffith |first2=Edward |last3=Pidgeon |first3=Edward |title=The Mollusca and Radiata: Arranged by the Baron Cuvier, with Supplementary Additions to Each Order |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mskQAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA435 |year=1834 |publisher=Whittaker and Company |pages=435\u2013}}</ref> which is now generally accepted to be an assemblage of different animal phyla that do not share a single common ancestor (a [[polyphyly|polyphyletic]] group)<ref>{{cite book |last=Hadzi |first=J. |title=The Evolution of the Metazoa |url=https://archive.org/details/evolutionofmetaz00hadz |year=1963 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0080100791 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/evolutionofmetaz00hadz/page/56 56\u201357]}}</ref>.

This is immediately obvious when looking at the jellyfish due to the presence of four [[gonads]], visible through its [[transparency and translucency|translucent]] body. This radial symmetry is [[ecology | ecologically]] important in allowing the jellyfish to detect and respond to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] (mainly food and danger) from all directions.\n\n[[File:Sterappel dwarsdrsn.jpg|thumb|right|top|200x200px|alt=Alt text|Apple cut horizontally showing that pentamerism also occurs in fruit]]\n\n[[Flowering plant]]s show five-fold symmetry, or pentamerism, in many of their flowers and fruits. This is easily seen through the arrangement of five [[carpel]]s (seed pockets) in an [[apple]] when cut [[transverse plane|transversely]]. Among animals, only the echinoderms such as [[sea star]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea lilies]] are pentamerous as adults, with five arms arranged around the mouth. Being bilaterian animals, however, they initially develop with mirror symmetry as larvae, then gain pentaradial symmetry later.<ref>Stewart, 2001. pp 64-65.</ref>\n\n{{vanchor|Hexamerism}} is found in the [[coral]]s and [[sea anemones]] (class [[Anthozoa]]) that are divided into two groups based on their symmetry. The most common corals in the subclass [[Hexacorallia]] have a hexameric body plan; their [[polyp (zoology)|polyp]]s have six-fold internal symmetry and a number of [[tentacle]]s that is a multiple of six.\n\n{{vanchor|Octamerism}} is found in corals of the subclass [[Octocorallia]]. These have polyps with eight tentacles and octameric radial symmetry. The [[octopus]], however, has bilateral symmetry, despite its eight arms.\n\n== Icosahedral symmetry ==\n[[File:Gastroenteritis viruses.jpg|thumb|left|top|200x200px|alt=Alt text|[[Gastroenteritis]] viruses have icosahedral symmetry]]\nIcosahedral symmetry occurs in an organism which contains 60 subunits generated by 20 faces, each an [[equilateral triangle]], and 12 corners. Within the [[icosahedron]] there is [[rotational symmetry | 2-fold, 3-fold and 5-fold symmetry]]. Many viruses, including ''[[canine parvovirus]]'', show this form of radial symmetry due to the presence of an icosahedral [[capsid|viral shell]]. Such symmetry has [[evolution | evolved]] because it allows the viral particle to be built up of repetitive subunits consisting of a limited number of structural proteins (encoded by viral [[genes]]), thereby saving space in the viral [[genome]]. The icosahedral symmetry can still be maintained with more than 60 subunits, but only in factors of 60. For example, the T=3 ''[[Tomato bushy stunt virus]]'' has 60x3 protein subunits (180 copies of the same structural protein)<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Alan J Cann|title=Virus Structure|doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0000439.pub2 |year=2015 |url=https://doi.org/10.1002/9780470015902.a0000439.pub2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url= | title=Symmetry in virus architecture |author1=Horne, R.

This means that spherical symmetry occurs in an organism if it is able to be cut into two identical halves through any cut that runs through the organism's center. True spherical symmetry is not found in animal body plans.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Holl\u00f3 |first1=G\u00e1bor |title=A new paradigm for animal symmetry |journal=Interface Focus |date=2015 |volume=5 |pages=20150032 |doi=10.1098/rsfs.2015.0032}}</ref> Organisms which show approximate spherical symmetry include the freshwater green alga ''[[Volvox]]''.<ref name=IAS>{{cite web | url=http://www.iaszoology.com/symmetry/ | title=Symmetry | publisher=IAS | accessdate=14 June 2014 | author=Chandra, Girish}}</ref>\n\nBacteria are often referred to as having a 'spherical' shape. Bacteria are categorized based on their shapes into three classes: cocci (spherical-shaped), bacillus (rod-shaped) and spirochetes (spiral-shaped) cells. In reality, this is a severe over-simplification as bacterial cells can be curved, bent, flattened, oblong spheriods and many more shapes.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Young |first1=K.

It is important to distinguish between the generalized use of the word 'spherical' to describe organisms at ease, and the true meaning of spherical symmetry. The same situation is seen in the description of viruses - 'spherical' viruses do not necessarily show spherical symmetry, usually they are icosahedral.\n\n==Bilateral symmetry==<!-- This section is linked from [[Brain]] -->\n{{Redirect|Bilateral symmetry|bilateral symmetry in mathematics|reflection symmetry}}\n{{main|Bilateria}}\nOrganisms with bilateral symmetry contain  a single plane of symmetry, the [[sagittal plane]], which divides the organism into two roughly mirror image left and right halves - approximate reflectional symmetry.\n[[File:20 petit paon de nuit.jpg|thumb|left|top|200x200px|alt= Alt text|The small emperor moth, ''[[Saturnia pavonia]]'', displays a [[deimatic]] pattern with bilateral symmetry.]]\n[[File:Ophrys apifera (flower).jpg|thumb|right|top|200x200px|alt= Alt text|Flower of [[Ophrys apifera|bee orchid]] (''Ophrys apifera'') is bilaterally symmetrical ([[zygomorphic]]).

The front end encounters the environment before the rest of the body so sensory organs such as eyes tend to be clustered there.

This involves changes in the [[frequency (statistics)|frequency]] of symmetry-related genes throughout time. \n\n=== Evolution of symmetry in plants ===\nEarly flowering plants had radially symmetric flowers but since then many plants have evolved bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The evolution of bilateral symmetry is due to the [[gene expression| expression]] of ''CYCLOIDEA'' genes. Evidence for the role of the ''CYCLOIDEA'' gene family comes from [[mutations]] in these genes which cause a reversion to radial symmetry. The ''CYCLOIDEA'' genes encode [[transcription factors]], proteins which control the expression of other genes. This allows their expression to influence developmental pathways relating to symmetry<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cubas |first1=Pilar |last2=Vincent |first2=Coral |last3=Coen |first3=Enrico |title=An epigenetic mutation responsible for natural variation in floral symmetry |journal=Nature |date=1999 |volume=401 |pages=157\u2013161 |doi=10.1038/43657}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Citerne |first1=H |title=Diversity of cycloidea-like Genes in Gesneriaceae in Relation to Floral Symmetry |journal=Annals of Botany |date=2000 |volume=86 |pages=167\u2013176 |doi=10.1006/anbo.2000.1178}}</ref>. For example, in ''[[Antirrhinum majus]]'', ''CYCLOIDEA'' is expressed during early development in the dorsal domain of the flower [[meristem]] and continues to be expressed later on in the dorsal petals to control their size and shape.

This is unsurprising since asymmetry is often an indication of unfitness - either defects during development or injuries throughout a lifetime. This is most apparent during mating during which females of some species select males with highly symmetrical features. For example, [[Facial symmetry]] influences human judgements of human attractiveness.<ref name=\"Grammer1994\">Grammer, K.; Thornhill, R. (1994). Human (Homo sapiens) facial attractiveness and sexual selection: the role of symmetry and averageness. Journal of comparative psychology (Washington, D.C. : 1983), 108(3), 233\u201342.</ref> Additionally, female [[barn swallow]]s, a species where adults have long tail streamers, prefer to mate with males that have the most symmetrical tails.<ref>[[John Maynard Smith|Maynard Smith, John]]; Harper, David (2003). ''Animal Signals''. Oxford University Press. pp. 63-65.</ref>\n\nWhile symmetry is known to be under selection, the evolutionary history of different types of symmetry in animals is an area of extensive debate. Traditionally it has been suggested that bilateral animals evolved from a radial [[ancestor]]. Cnidarians, a phylum containing animals with radial symmetry, are the most closely related group to the bilaterians. Cnidarians are one of two groups of early animals considered to have defined structure, the second being the ctenophores. Ctenophores show biradial symmetry leading to the suggestion that they represent an intermediate step in the evolution of bilateral symmetry from radial symmetry<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martindale |first1=Mark Q. |last2=Henry |first2=Jonathon Q |title=The Development of Radial and Biradial Symmetry: The Evolution of Bilaterality |journal=American Zoologist |date=1998 |volume=38 |pages=672\u2013684 |doi=10.1093/icb/38.4.672}}</ref>\n\nInterpretations based only on morphology are not sufficient to explain the evolution of symmetry. Two different explanations are proposed for the different symmetries in cnidarians and bilateria. The first suggestion is that an ancestral animal had no symmetry (was asymmetric) before cnidarians and bilaterians separated into different evolutionary [[lineage (evolution)|lineages]]. Radial symmetry could have then evolved in cnidarians and bilateral symmetry in bilaterians. Alternatively, the second suggestion is that an ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians had bilateral symmetry before the cnidarians evolved and became different by having radial symmetry. Both potential explanations are being explored and evidence continues to fuel the debate.\n\n==Asymmetry==\nAlthough asymmetry is typically associated with being unfit, some species have evolved to be asymmetrical as an important [[adaptation]]. Many members of the [[phylum]] [[Porifera]] ([[sponge]]s) have no symmetry, though some are radially symmetric.<ref>{{cite web | author=Myers, Phil | title=Porifera Sponges | url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Porifera/  | publisher=University of Michigan (Animal Diversity Web) | date=2001 | accessdate=14 June 2014}}</ref>. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Symmetry breaking occurs at several different levels in order to generate the anatomical asymmetry which we observe. These levels include asymmetric gene expression, protein expression, and activity of cells.\n\nFor example, left-right asymmetry in mammals has been investigated extensively in the [[embryo]]s of mice. Such studies have led to support for the nodal flow hypothesis. In a region of the embryo referred to as the node there are small hair-like structures ([[Cilium|monocilia]]) which all rotate together in a particular direction. This creates a unidirectional flow of signalling molecules causing these signals to accumulate on one side of the embryo and not the other. This results in the activation of different developmental pathways on each side, and subsequent asymmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hirokawa |first1=Nobutaka |last2=Tanaka |first2=Yosuke |last3=Okada |first3=Yasushi |last4=Takeda |first4=Sen |title=Nodal Flow and the Generation of Left-Right Asymmetry |journal=Cell |date=2006 |volume=125 |pages=33\u201345 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.03.002}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nonaka |first1=Shigenori |last2=Shiratori |first2=Hidetaka |last3=Saijoh |first3=Yukio |last4=Hamada |first4=Hiroshi |title=Determination of left\u2013right patterning of the mouse embryo by artificial nodal flow |journal=Nature |date=2002 |volume=418 |pages=96\u201399 |doi=10.1038/nature00849}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Asymmetrical_signalling_pathways_in_a_chick_embryo.png|thumb|right|200x200px|Schematic diagram of signalling pathways on the left and right side of a chick embryo, ultimately leading to the development of asymmetry]]\n\nMuch of the investigation of the genetic basis of symmetry breaking has been done on chick embryos. In chick embryos the left side expresses genes called ''[[NODAL]]'' and ''[[LEFTY2]]'' which activate ''[[PITX2]]'' to signal the development of left side structures. Whereas, the right side does not express ''PITX2'' and consequently develops right side structures.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Raya |first1=Angel |last2=Izpisua Belmonte |first2=Juan Carlos |title=Unveiling the establishment of left\u2013right asymmetry in the chick embryo |journal=Mechanisms of Development |date=2004 |volume=121 |pages=1043\u20131054 |doi=10.1016/j.mod.2004.05.005}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gros |first1=J. |last2=Feistel |first2=K. |last3=Viebahn |first3=C. |last4=Blum |first4=M. |last5=Tabin |first5=C.

Interestingly, the genes involved in this asymmetry are similar (closely related) to those in animal asymmetry - both ''LEFTY1'' and ''LEFTY2'' play a role. In the same way as animals, symmetry breaking in plants can occur at a molecular (genes/proteins), subcellular, cellular, tissue and organ level.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mu\u00f1oz-Nortes |first1=Tamara |last2=Wilson-S\u00e1nchez |first2=David |last3=Candela |first3=H\u00e9ctor |last4=Micol |first4=Jos\u00e9 Luis |title=Symmetry, asymmetry, and the cell cycle in plants: known knowns and some known unknowns |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |date=2014 |volume=65 |pages=2645\u20132655 |doi=10.1093/jxb/ert476}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n===Biological structures===\n* [[Standard anatomical position]]\n* [[Anatomical terms of motion]]\n* [[Anatomical terms of muscle]]\n* [[Anatomical terms of bone]]\n* [[Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy]]\n* [[Glossary of botanical terms]] \n* [[Glossary of plant morphology]] \n* [[Glossary of leaf morphology]]\n* [[Glossary of entomology terms]]\n* [[Plant morphology]]\n\n===Terms of orientation===\n* [[Handedness]]\n* [[Laterality]]\n* [[Proper right and proper left]]\n* [[Reflection symmetry]]\n* [[Sinistral and dextral]]\n* [[Direction (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Symmetry (disambiguation)]]\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|28em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* [[Philip Ball|Ball, Philip]] (2009).

External symmetry can be easily seen by just looking at an organism. For example, take the face of a human being which has a plane of symmetry down its centre, or a pine cone with a clear symmetrical spiral pattern. Internal features can also show symmetry, for example the tubes in the human body (responsible for transporting [[gas]]es, [[nutrients]], and waste products) which are [[cylindrical]] and have several planes of symmetry. \n\nBiological symmetry can be thought of as a balanced distribution of duplicate body parts or shapes within the body of an organism. Importantly, unlike in mathematics, symmetry in biology is always approximate. For example, plant leaves \u2013 while considered symmetrical \u2013 rarely match up exactly when folded in half. Symmetry is one class of [[patterns in nature|patterns]] in nature whereby there is near-repetition of the pattern element, either by [[reflection (geometry)|reflection]] or [[rotation (geometry)|rotation]].\n\nWhile [[sponges]] and [[placozoans]] represent two groups of animals which don't show any symmetry (i.e. are asymmetrical), the [[body plan]]s of most [[multicellular organism]]s exhibit, and are defined by, some form of symmetry. There are only a few types of symmetry which are possible in body plans. These are [[rotational symmetry|radial]] (cylindrical), [[reflection symmetry|bilateral]], biradial and [[circular symmetry|spherical]] symmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Holl\u00f3 |first1=G\u00e1bor |title=A new paradigm for animal symmetry |journal=Interface Focus |date=2015 |volume=5 |pages=20150032 |doi=10.1098/rsfs.2015.0032}}</ref> While the classification of [[viruses]] as an 'organism' remains controversial, viruses also contain [[Icosahedral symmetry|icosahedral symmetry]].\n\nThe importance of symmetry is illustrated by the fact that groups of animals have traditionally been defined by this feature in [[Taxonomy (biology)| taxonomic]] groupings.

The [[octopus]], however, has bilateral symmetry, despite its eight arms.\n\n== Icosahedral symmetry ==\n[[File:Gastroenteritis viruses.jpg|thumb|left|top|200x200px|alt=Alt text|[[Gastroenteritis]] viruses have icosahedral symmetry]]\nIcosahedral symmetry occurs in an organism which contains 60 subunits generated by 20 faces, each an [[equilateral triangle]], and 12 corners. Within the [[icosahedron]] there is [[rotational symmetry | 2-fold, 3-fold and 5-fold symmetry]]. Many viruses, including ''[[canine parvovirus]]'', show this form of radial symmetry due to the presence of an icosahedral [[capsid|viral shell]]. Such symmetry has [[evolution | evolved]] because it allows the viral particle to be built up of repetitive subunits consisting of a limited number of structural proteins (encoded by viral [[genes]]), thereby saving space in the viral [[genome]]. The icosahedral symmetry can still be maintained with more than 60 subunits, but only in factors of 60.

Bacteria are categorized based on their shapes into three classes: cocci (spherical-shaped), bacillus (rod-shaped) and spirochetes (spiral-shaped) cells.

It is important to distinguish between the generalized use of the word 'spherical' to describe organisms at ease, and the true meaning of spherical symmetry. The same situation is seen in the description of viruses - 'spherical' viruses do not necessarily show spherical symmetry, usually they are icosahedral.\n\n==Bilateral symmetry==<!-- This section is linked from [[Brain]] -->\n{{Redirect|Bilateral symmetry|bilateral symmetry in mathematics|reflection symmetry}}\n{{main|Bilateria}}\nOrganisms with bilateral symmetry contain  a single plane of symmetry, the [[sagittal plane]], which divides the organism into two roughly mirror image left and right halves - approximate reflectional symmetry.\n[[File:20 petit paon de nuit.jpg|thumb|left|top|200x200px|alt= Alt text|The small emperor moth, ''[[Saturnia pavonia]]'', displays a [[deimatic]] pattern with bilateral symmetry.]]\n[[File:Ophrys apifera (flower).jpg|thumb|right|top|200x200px|alt= Alt text|Flower of [[Ophrys apifera|bee orchid]] (''Ophrys apifera'') is bilaterally symmetrical ([[zygomorphic]]).

The bilateria have two axes of [[polarity in embryogenesis|polarity]]. The first is an [[anterior]]-[[posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] (AP) axis which can be visualised as an imaginary axis running from the head or mouth to the tail or other end of an organism. The second is the [[Anatomical terms of location|dorsal]]-[[ventral]] (DV) axis which runs [[perpendicular]] to the AP axis<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Finnerty |first1=John R |title=Evolution & Development |journal=IJDB |date=2003 |volume=47 |pages=465-705 |url=http://www.ijdb.ehu.es/web/paper/14756328}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Holl\u00f3 |first1=G\u00e1bor |title=A new paradigm for animal symmetry |journal=Interface Focus |date=2015 |volume=5 |pages=20150032 |doi=10.1098/rsfs.2015.0032}}</ref>.

The front end encounters the environment before the rest of the body so sensory organs such as eyes tend to be clustered there. This is also the site where a mouth develops since it is the first part of the body to encounter food. Therefore, a distinct head, with sense organs connected to a central nervous system, tends to develop.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Finnerty |first1=John R. |title=Did internal transport, rather than directed locomotion, favor the evolution of bilateral symmetry in animals? |journal=BioEssays |date=2005 |volume=27 |pages=1174\u20131180 |doi=10.1002/bies.20299}}</ref> This pattern of development (with a distinct head and tail) is called [[cephalization]]. It is also argued that the development of an AP axis is important in locomotion - bilateral symmetry gives the body an intrinsic direction and allows streamlining to reduce [[drag (physics)|drag]].\n\nIn addition to animals, the flowers of some plants also show bilateral symmetry. Such plants are referred to as [[zygomorphic]] and include the orchid (''[[Orchidaceae]]'') and pea (''[[Fabaceae]]'') families, and most of the figwort family (''[[Scrophulariaceae]]'')<ref>{{cite web | url=http://botany.csdl.tamu.edu/FLORA/301Manhart/Dicots/Asteridae/Scr/Scr.html | title=SCROPHULARIACEAE - Figwort or Snapdragon Family | publisher=Texas A&M University Bioinformatics Working Group | accessdate=14 June 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.factmonster.com/ce6/sci/A0847482.html Symmetry, biological], from ''[[The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia]]'' (2007).</ref>.

Unlike radially symmetrical organisms which can be cut divided equally along many planes, biradial organisms can only be cut equally along two planes. This could represent an intermediate stage in the evolution of bilateral symmetry from a radially symmetric ancestor.<ref name=MartindaleHenry>{{cite journal | url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/4/672.full.pdf | title=The Development of Radial and Biradial Symmetry: The Evolution of Bilaterality1 |author1=Martindale, Mark Q. |author2=Henry, Jonathan Q. | journal=American Zoology | year=1998 | volume=38 | issue=4 | pages=672\u2013684 | doi=10.1093/icb/38.4.672}}</ref>\n\nThe animal group with the most obvious biradial symmetry is the [[ctenophores]].

This involves changes in the [[frequency (statistics)|frequency]] of symmetry-related genes throughout time. \n\n=== Evolution of symmetry in plants ===\nEarly flowering plants had radially symmetric flowers but since then many plants have evolved bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The evolution of bilateral symmetry is due to the [[gene expression| expression]] of ''CYCLOIDEA'' genes. Evidence for the role of the ''CYCLOIDEA'' gene family comes from [[mutations]] in these genes which cause a reversion to radial symmetry. The ''CYCLOIDEA'' genes encode [[transcription factors]], proteins which control the expression of other genes. This allows their expression to influence developmental pathways relating to symmetry<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cubas |first1=Pilar |last2=Vincent |first2=Coral |last3=Coen |first3=Enrico |title=An epigenetic mutation responsible for natural variation in floral symmetry |journal=Nature |date=1999 |volume=401 |pages=157\u2013161 |doi=10.1038/43657}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Citerne |first1=H |title=Diversity of cycloidea-like Genes in Gesneriaceae in Relation to Floral Symmetry |journal=Annals of Botany |date=2000 |volume=86 |pages=167\u2013176 |doi=10.1006/anbo.2000.1178}}</ref>. For example, in ''[[Antirrhinum majus]]'', ''CYCLOIDEA'' is expressed during early development in the dorsal domain of the flower [[meristem]] and continues to be expressed later on in the dorsal petals to control their size and shape.

This is unsurprising since asymmetry is often an indication of unfitness - either defects during development or injuries throughout a lifetime. This is most apparent during mating during which females of some species select males with highly symmetrical features. For example, [[Facial symmetry]] influences human judgements of human attractiveness.<ref name=\"Grammer1994\">Grammer, K.; Thornhill, R. (1994). Human (Homo sapiens) facial attractiveness and sexual selection: the role of symmetry and averageness. Journal of comparative psychology (Washington, D.C. : 1983), 108(3), 233\u201342.</ref> Additionally, female [[barn swallow]]s, a species where adults have long tail streamers, prefer to mate with males that have the most symmetrical tails.<ref>[[John Maynard Smith|Maynard Smith, John]]; Harper, David (2003). ''Animal Signals''. Oxford University Press. pp. 63-65.</ref>\n\nWhile symmetry is known to be under selection, the evolutionary history of different types of symmetry in animals is an area of extensive debate. Traditionally it has been suggested that bilateral animals evolved from a radial [[ancestor]]. Cnidarians, a phylum containing animals with radial symmetry, are the most closely related group to the bilaterians. Cnidarians are one of two groups of early animals considered to have defined structure, the second being the ctenophores. Ctenophores show biradial symmetry leading to the suggestion that they represent an intermediate step in the evolution of bilateral symmetry from radial symmetry<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Martindale |first1=Mark Q. |last2=Henry |first2=Jonathon Q |title=The Development of Radial and Biradial Symmetry: The Evolution of Bilaterality |journal=American Zoologist |date=1998 |volume=38 |pages=672\u2013684 |doi=10.1093/icb/38.4.672}}</ref>\n\nInterpretations based only on morphology are not sufficient to explain the evolution of symmetry. Two different explanations are proposed for the different symmetries in cnidarians and bilateria. The first suggestion is that an ancestral animal had no symmetry (was asymmetric) before cnidarians and bilaterians separated into different evolutionary [[lineage (evolution)|lineages]]. Radial symmetry could have then evolved in cnidarians and bilateral symmetry in bilaterians. Alternatively, the second suggestion is that an ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians had bilateral symmetry before the cnidarians evolved and became different by having radial symmetry. Both potential explanations are being explored and evidence continues to fuel the debate.\n\n==Asymmetry==\nAlthough asymmetry is typically associated with being unfit, some species have evolved to be asymmetrical as an important [[adaptation]]. Many members of the [[phylum]] [[Porifera]] ([[sponge]]s) have no symmetry, though some are radially symmetric.<ref>{{cite web | author=Myers, Phil | title=Porifera Sponges | url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Porifera/  | publisher=University of Michigan (Animal Diversity Web) | date=2001 | accessdate=14 June 2014}}</ref>. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Symmetry breaking occurs at several different levels in order to generate the anatomical asymmetry which we observe. These levels include asymmetric gene expression, protein expression, and activity of cells.\n\nFor example, left-right asymmetry in mammals has been investigated extensively in the [[embryo]]s of mice. Such studies have led to support for the nodal flow hypothesis. In a region of the embryo referred to as the node there are small hair-like structures ([[Cilium|monocilia]]) which all rotate together in a particular direction. This creates a unidirectional flow of signalling molecules causing these signals to accumulate on one side of the embryo and not the other. This results in the activation of different developmental pathways on each side, and subsequent asymmetry.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hirokawa |first1=Nobutaka |last2=Tanaka |first2=Yosuke |last3=Okada |first3=Yasushi |last4=Takeda |first4=Sen |title=Nodal Flow and the Generation of Left-Right Asymmetry |journal=Cell |date=2006 |volume=125 |pages=33\u201345 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.03.002}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nonaka |first1=Shigenori |last2=Shiratori |first2=Hidetaka |last3=Saijoh |first3=Yukio |last4=Hamada |first4=Hiroshi |title=Determination of left\u2013right patterning of the mouse embryo by artificial nodal flow |journal=Nature |date=2002 |volume=418 |pages=96\u201399 |doi=10.1038/nature00849}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Asymmetrical_signalling_pathways_in_a_chick_embryo.png|thumb|right|200x200px|Schematic diagram of signalling pathways on the left and right side of a chick embryo, ultimately leading to the development of asymmetry]]\n\nMuch of the investigation of the genetic basis of symmetry breaking has been done on chick embryos. In chick embryos the left side expresses genes called ''[[NODAL]]'' and ''[[LEFTY2]]'' which activate ''[[PITX2]]'' to signal the development of left side structures. Whereas, the right side does not express ''PITX2'' and consequently develops right side structures.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Raya |first1=Angel |last2=Izpisua Belmonte |first2=Juan Carlos |title=Unveiling the establishment of left\u2013right asymmetry in the chick embryo |journal=Mechanisms of Development |date=2004 |volume=121 |pages=1043\u20131054 |doi=10.1016/j.mod.2004.05.005}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gros |first1=J. |last2=Feistel |first2=K. |last3=Viebahn |first3=C. |last4=Blum |first4=M. |last5=Tabin |first5=C.

For example the direction of helical growth in ''[[Arabidopsis]]'', the most commonly studied model plant, shows left-handedness. Interestingly, the genes involved in this asymmetry are similar (closely related) to those in animal asymmetry - both ''LEFTY1'' and ''LEFTY2'' play a role. In the same way as animals, symmetry breaking in plants can occur at a molecular (genes/proteins), subcellular, cellular, tissue and organ level.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mu\u00f1oz-Nortes |first1=Tamara |last2=Wilson-S\u00e1nchez |first2=David |last3=Candela |first3=H\u00e9ctor |last4=Micol |first4=Jos\u00e9 Luis |title=Symmetry, asymmetry, and the cell cycle in plants: known knowns and some known unknowns |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |date=2014 |volume=65 |pages=2645\u20132655 |doi=10.1093/jxb/ert476}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n===Biological structures===\n* [[Standard anatomical position]]\n* [[Anatomical terms of motion]]\n* [[Anatomical terms of muscle]]\n* [[Anatomical terms of bone]]\n* [[Anatomical terms of neuroanatomy]]\n* [[Glossary of botanical terms]] \n* [[Glossary of plant morphology]] \n* [[Glossary of leaf morphology]]\n* [[Glossary of entomology terms]]\n* [[Plant morphology]]\n\n===Terms of orientation===\n* [[Handedness]]\n* [[Laterality]]\n* [[Proper right and proper left]]\n* [[Reflection symmetry]]\n* [[Sinistral and dextral]]\n* [[Direction (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Symmetry (disambiguation)]]\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|28em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* [[Philip Ball|Ball, Philip]] (2009).
