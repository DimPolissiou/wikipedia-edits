In the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 presidential election]] and the [[1944 United States presidential election|1944 presidential election]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] became the first president to win a third term and then later a fourth term, giving rise to concerns about the potential issues involved with a president serving an unlimited number of terms. [[United States Congress|Congress]] approved the Twenty-second Amendment on March 24, 1947, and submitted it to the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] for [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Ratification|ratification]]. That process was completed on February 27, 1951, after the amendment had been ratified by the requisite 36 of the then-48 [[U.S. state|states]] (as neither [[Alaska]] nor [[Hawaii]] had been [[Admission to the Union|admitted as states]]), and its provisions [[Coming into force|came into force]] on that date.\n\nThe amendment prohibits any individual who has been elected president twice from being elected again. Under the amendment, an individual who fills an unexpired presidential term lasting greater than two years is also prohibited from winning election as president more than once. Scholars debate whether the amendment prohibits affected individuals from succeeding to the presidency under any circumstances or whether it only applies to presidential elections.\n\n==Text==\n<!-- Do not edit the words Article or President, they are capitalized as per the citation-->\n{{quote|'''Section 1.'''

Roosevelt]]'s election to an unprecedented four terms as president, the notion of presidential [[term limit]]s has long been debated in American politics. Delegates to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention of 1787]] considered the issue extensively (alongside broader questions, such as who would elect the president, and the president's role). Many\u2014including [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]]\u2014supported a lifetime appointment for presidents, while others favored fixed terms appointments. Virginia's [[George Mason]] denounced the life-tenure proposal as tantamount to establishment of an [[elective monarchy]].<ref name=BuckleyMetzger>{{cite web| title=Twenty-second Amendment| last1=Buckley| first1=F.

X, section 1.</ref>  Ultimately, the Framers approved four-year terms with no restriction on the amount of time a person could serve as president.\n\nThough dismissed by the Constitutional Convention, the concept of term limits for U.S. presidents took hold during the presidencies of [[George Washington]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]]. As his second term entered its final year in 1796, George Washington was exhausted from years of public service, and his health had begun to decline. He was also bothered by the unrelenting attacks from his political opponents, which had escalated after the signing of the [[Jay Treaty]], and believed that he had accomplished his major goals as president. For these reasons, he decided not to stand for reelection to a third term, a decision he announced to the nation through a ''[[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]]'' in September 1796.<ref>{{cite book| last=Ferling| first=John| authorlink=John E.

Following [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s reelection victory in [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]], there were serious discussions within Republican political circles about the possibility of his running again in 1876. Interest in a third term for Grant evaporated however, in the light of negative public opinion and opposition from members of Congress, and Grant left the presidency in 1877, after two terms. Even so, as the 1880 election approached, he sought nomination for a (non-consecutive) third term at the [[1880 Republican National Convention]], but narrowly lost to [[James Garfield]], who would go on to win the [[1880 United States presidential election|1880 election]].<ref name=PeabodyGant/>\n\n[[Theodore Roosevelt]] succeeded to the presidency on September 14, 1901, following [[Assassination of William McKinley|William McKinley's assassination]] ({{age in days|Mar 4 1901|Sep 14 1901}} days into his second term), and was subsequently elected to a full term in [[1904 United States presidential election|1904]]. While he declined to seek a third (second full) term in 1908, Roosevelt did seek one four years later, in the [[1912 United States presidential election|election of 1912]], where he lost to [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Wilson himself, despite his ill health following a serious stroke, aspired to a third term. Many of Wilson's advisers tried to convince him that his health precluded another campaign, but Wilson nonetheless asked that his name be placed in nomination for the presidency at the [[1920 Democratic National Convention]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Year of the Six Presidents |last=Pietrusza |first=David |publisher=Carroll and Graf |location=New York |date=2007 |isbn=978-0-78671-622-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780786716227/page/187 187\u2013200] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780786716227/page/187 }}</ref> Democratic Party leaders were unwilling to support Wilson, however, and the nomination eventually went to [[James M.

When the convention came, Roosevelt sent a message to the convention, saying he would run only if [[Draft (politics)|drafted]], saying delegates were free to vote for whomever they pleased.

Both these provisions were removed when the full Senate took up the bill, but a new provision was, however, added. Put forward by [[Robert A.

Because of this apparent ambiguity, there may be a loophole in the 22nd Amendment whereby a two-term former president could be elected vice president and then succeed to the presidency as a result of the incumbent's death, resignation, or removal from office (or even succeed to the presidency from some other stated office in the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]]).<ref name=PeabodyGant/><ref>{{cite web| url=https://cornerstonelaw.us/22nd-amendment-doesnt-say-think-says/| title=The 22nd Amendment Doesn't Say What You Think It Says | publisher=Cornerstone Law Firm| location=Blandon, Pennsylvania| last=Ready| first=Joel A. |accessdate=November 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSome argue that the 22nd Amendment and 12th Amendment bar any two-term president from later serving as vice president as well as from succeeding to the presidency from any point in the presidential line of succession.<ref>{{cite web| title=Constitutional Sleight of Hand| last=Franck| first=Matthew J.| date=July 31, 2007| accessdate=June 12, 2008| work=[[National Review]]|url=http://bench.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NDgwODVmMzcwMTQwNDM3YjU0OGE5ZjQyOTIxNmUyYzY=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613214946/http://bench.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NDgwODVmMzcwMTQwNDM3YjU0OGE5ZjQyOTIxNmUyYzY=|archivedate=June 13, 2008}}</ref> Others contend that the [[original intent]] of the 12th Amendment concerns qualification for ''service'' (age, residence, and citizenship), while the 22nd Amendment, concerns qualifications for ''election'', and thus ([[Strict constructionism|strictly applying the text]]) a former two-term president is still eligible to ''serve'' as vice president (neither amendment restricts the number of times an individual can be elected to the vice presidency), and then succeed to the presidency to serve out the balance of the term (though prohibited from running for election to an additional term).<ref>{{cite news |title=Why the Constitution permits a Gore-Clinton ticket |authorlink=Michael C.

In the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 presidential election]] and the [[1944 United States presidential election|1944 presidential election]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] became the first president to win a third term and then later a fourth term, giving rise to concerns about the potential issues involved with a president serving an unlimited number of terms. [[United States Congress|Congress]] approved the Twenty-second Amendment on March 24, 1947, and submitted it to the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] for [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Ratification|ratification]]. That process was completed on February 27, 1951, after the amendment had been ratified by the requisite 36 of the then-48 [[U.S. state|states]] (as neither [[Alaska]] nor [[Hawaii]] had been [[Admission to the Union|admitted as states]]), and its provisions [[Coming into force|came into force]] on that date.\n\nThe amendment prohibits any individual who has been elected president twice from being elected again. Under the amendment, an individual who fills an unexpired presidential term lasting greater than two years is also prohibited from winning election as president more than once. Scholars debate whether the amendment prohibits affected individuals from succeeding to the presidency under any circumstances or whether it only applies to presidential elections.\n\n==Text==\n<!-- Do not edit the words Article or President, they are capitalized as per the citation-->\n{{quote|'''Section 1.'''

Roosevelt]]'s election to an unprecedented four terms as president, the notion of presidential [[term limit]]s has long been debated in American politics. Delegates to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention of 1787]] considered the issue extensively (alongside broader questions, such as who would elect the president, and the president's role). Many\u2014including [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]]\u2014supported a lifetime appointment for presidents, while others favored fixed terms appointments. Virginia's [[George Mason]] denounced the life-tenure proposal as tantamount to establishment of an [[elective monarchy]].<ref name=BuckleyMetzger>{{cite web| title=Twenty-second Amendment| last1=Buckley| first1=F.

X, section 1.</ref>  Ultimately, the Framers approved four-year terms with no restriction on the amount of time a person could serve as president.\n\nThough dismissed by the Constitutional Convention, the concept of term limits for U.S. presidents took hold during the presidencies of [[George Washington]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]]. As his second term entered its final year in 1796, George Washington was exhausted from years of public service, and his health had begun to decline. He was also bothered by the unrelenting attacks from his political opponents, which had escalated after the signing of the [[Jay Treaty]], and believed that he had accomplished his major goals as president. For these reasons, he decided not to stand for reelection to a third term, a decision he announced to the nation through a ''[[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]]'' in September 1796.<ref>{{cite book| last=Ferling| first=John| authorlink=John E.

Interest in a third term for Grant evaporated however, in the light of negative public opinion and opposition from members of Congress, and Grant left the presidency in 1877, after two terms. Even so, as the 1880 election approached, he sought nomination for a (non-consecutive) third term at the [[1880 Republican National Convention]], but narrowly lost to [[James Garfield]], who would go on to win the [[1880 United States presidential election|1880 election]].<ref name=PeabodyGant/>\n\n[[Theodore Roosevelt]] succeeded to the presidency on September 14, 1901, following [[Assassination of William McKinley|William McKinley's assassination]] ({{age in days|Mar 4 1901|Sep 14 1901}} days into his second term), and was subsequently elected to a full term in [[1904 United States presidential election|1904]]. While he declined to seek a third (second full) term in 1908, Roosevelt did seek one four years later, in the [[1912 United States presidential election|election of 1912]], where he lost to [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Wilson himself, despite his ill health following a serious stroke, aspired to a third term. Many of Wilson's advisers tried to convince him that his health precluded another campaign, but Wilson nonetheless asked that his name be placed in nomination for the presidency at the [[1920 Democratic National Convention]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Year of the Six Presidents |last=Pietrusza |first=David |publisher=Carroll and Graf |location=New York |date=2007 |isbn=978-0-78671-622-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780786716227/page/187 187\u2013200] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780786716227/page/187 }}</ref> Democratic Party leaders were unwilling to support Wilson, however, and the nomination eventually went to [[James M.

Introduced by [[Earl C. Michener]], the measure passed 285\u2013121, with support from 47 Democrats, on February 6, 1947. Meanwhile, the Senate developed its own proposed amendment, which initially differed from the House proposal by requiring that the amendment be submitted to [[state ratifying conventions]] for ratification, rather than to the state legislatures, and by prohibiting any person who had served more than 365 days in each of two terms from further presidential service.

Due to this, several issues could be raised regarding the amendment's meaning and application, especially in relation to the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|12th Amendment]], ratified in 1804, which states, \"But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States\".<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/amendments-11-27| title=The Constitution: Amendments 11-27| work=America's Founding Documents| publisher=National Archives| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=March 11, 2018}}</ref> While it is clear that under the 12th Amendment the original constitutional qualifications of age, citizenship, and residency apply to both the president and vice president, it is unclear whether someone who is ineligible to be elected president could be elected vice president. Because of this apparent ambiguity, there may be a loophole in the 22nd Amendment whereby a two-term former president could be elected vice president and then succeed to the presidency as a result of the incumbent's death, resignation, or removal from office (or even succeed to the presidency from some other stated office in the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]]).<ref name=PeabodyGant/><ref>{{cite web| url=https://cornerstonelaw.us/22nd-amendment-doesnt-say-think-says/| title=The 22nd Amendment Doesn't Say What You Think It Says | publisher=Cornerstone Law Firm| location=Blandon, Pennsylvania| last=Ready| first=Joel A. |accessdate=November 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSome argue that the 22nd Amendment and 12th Amendment bar any two-term president from later serving as vice president as well as from succeeding to the presidency from any point in the presidential line of succession.<ref>{{cite web| title=Constitutional Sleight of Hand| last=Franck| first=Matthew J.| date=July 31, 2007| accessdate=June 12, 2008| work=[[National Review]]|url=http://bench.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NDgwODVmMzcwMTQwNDM3YjU0OGE5ZjQyOTIxNmUyYzY=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613214946/http://bench.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NDgwODVmMzcwMTQwNDM3YjU0OGE5ZjQyOTIxNmUyYzY=|archivedate=June 13, 2008}}</ref> Others contend that the [[original intent]] of the 12th Amendment concerns qualification for ''service'' (age, residence, and citizenship), while the 22nd Amendment, concerns qualifications for ''election'', and thus ([[Strict constructionism|strictly applying the text]]) a former two-term president is still eligible to ''serve'' as vice president (neither amendment restricts the number of times an individual can be elected to the vice presidency), and then succeed to the presidency to serve out the balance of the term (though prohibited from running for election to an additional term).<ref>{{cite news |title=Why the Constitution permits a Gore-Clinton ticket |authorlink=Michael C.

In 1968 a Jump Racing Pattern Committee headed by [[Philip Lever, 3rd Viscount Leverhulme|Lord Leverhulme]] recommended the creation of a formal NH Pattern, which came into being in 1969 with 14 races initially. The Pattern underwent further revisions in the 1980s and was subject to a major change in 1989 when the [[Jockey Club]], the governing body of British horseracing at the time, overhauled the Pattern to create a mid-season and season-ending Grade 1 race in each of twelve categories, with lead-up Grade 2 races and a set of 14 major handicaps of Grade 3 status.<ref>{{cite

take place annually in Great Britain, under the authority of the [[British Horseracing Authority]], including all races which currently hold Grade 1, 2 or 3 status.\n\n== History of the National Hunt Pattern ==\nA National Hunt (NH) Pattern of important races was first recognized in 1964 when the [[Horserace Betting Levy Board]] made a grant of \u00a364,000 to fund a \"prestige race allocation\" split between the [[Cheltenham Gold Cup]], [[Champion Hurdle]] and [[Grand National]]. In 1968 a Jump Racing Pattern Committee headed by [[Philip Lever, 3rd Viscount Leverhulme|Lord Leverhulme]] recommended the creation of a formal NH Pattern, which came into being in 1969 with 14 races initially. The Pattern underwent further revisions in the 1980s and was subject to a major change in 1989 when the [[Jockey Club]], the governing body of British horseracing at the time, overhauled the Pattern to create a mid-season and season-ending Grade 1 race in each of twelve categories, with lead-up Grade 2 races and a set of 14 major handicaps of Grade 3 status.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rae|first1=George|title=A Guide to The National Hunt Pattern|date=1992|publisher=The Sporting Life|isbn=0901091448|pages=9\u201314}}</ref> This forms the basis of the current Pattern, which
