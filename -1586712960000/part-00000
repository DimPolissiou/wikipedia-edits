Her father died three months before her birth while working as a merchant seaman out at sea. Her mother remarried to a man who expended all of the family's savings. Therefore, Bruce only spent two years in formal schooling before leaving her small town to hold various positions in other family's homes. She became a governess at the age of fourteen to an English family who took her to [[Paris]] and then [[Melbourne, Quebec]], where she is known for being a school teacher. She taught her students farming fundamentals, but after a few years, she returned to London in 1837. She got a job working for the American Unitarian minister [[Ezra Stiles Gannett]], who eventually brought her to [[Boston]] at the age of twenty.\n\nAfter a few years of living in Boston, Bruce joined the Transcendentalist community of Brook Farm at [[West Roxbury, Massachusetts]]. Bruce\u2019s brother followed her footsteps and also joined the association in June 1841. The community\u2019s liberal religious beliefs forced all members to live in community, cooperative living. Bruce studied at the school, ran the nursery, and participated in academic discussions about various Brook Farm\u2019s literary members or visitors including Ralph Also Emerson, William Henry Channing, and Margaret Fuller. These authors and the spirit of transcendentalism had a major influence on Bruce\u2019s writing she produced while at Brook Farm. At Brook Farm, she joined the \u201cFancy Group,\u201d which allowed women to use domestic skills to paint lampshades and screens which were sold to raise money to help fund Brook Farm.\n\nBy February 1844, Bruce had supported Brook Farm\u2019s conversion to the French utopian social doctrines of [[Charles Fourier]]; although she felt the community she was once apart of lost its spontaneity; therefore, she moved to New York City. While in New York City, Bruce networked with her friend, Margaret Fuller, and landed a job as [[Eliza Farnham]]'s assistant. Eliza Farnham was most known for being the matron of the Female State Prison in Sing Sing, New York. After working at Sing Sing for a year, Bruce left New York to teach at schools in Illinois and Missouri. However, she returned east to serve as a public school teacher and governess in Pennsylvania and New York.\n\nWith funds she borrowed from [[Horace Greeley]], Bruce traveled to Santa Cruz, California in 1850 where she and Farnham purchased and worked on a farm for two years. Farnham was ridiculed for her radical ideas and decided it was best to travel to the West. They raised poultry and grew potatoes and fruit. While in California, Bruce became very involved in the women\u2019s suffrage movement, the temperance movement, and the anti-slavery crusade.\n\nLater, in 1852, Bruce married Richard Kirby, a local tanner, and had five children. She raised her five children and also continued to write fiction and short stories. She stayed in touch with friends and activists from Brook Farms, and she stayed up to date on women\u2019s rights movements through reform papers such as Greeley\u2019s New York Tribune and National Anti-Slavery Standard. The abolitionist movement and the Civil War fueled Bruce\u2019s belief that women were enslaved, and after the Civil War, she joined the women\u2019s rights movement to secure women\u2019s rights in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. By 1869, she raised enough money to fund California\u2019s first local woman suffrage society. And in 1870, she served as vice-president of the San Francisco Women\u2019s Rights Convention. Bruce reported on local lectures by [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] in the Santa Cruz Sentinel. Bruce also criticized California\u2019s judge decision that prevented women from voting and debated woman suffrage critics. In 1874, at the age of 56, she organized the Santa Cruz Temperance Union, which became affiliated with the WCTU, Women\u2019s Christian Temperance Union, that successfully encouraged the prohibition movement later in the 1920s.\n\nGeorgiana Bruce Kirby died at the age of 68 on January 27, 1887. There is a school named after her in [[Santa Cruz, California]] that supports her ideals. And In 1887, her memoir was published, Years of Experience: An Autobiographical Narrative, in addition to her diary; however, her memoir ends in 1850 when Bruce left New York for California.\n\n==References==\n# {{cite web |last1=Guarneri |first1=Carl |title=Biographical Sketch of Georgiana Bruce Kirby |url=https://documents.alexanderstreet.com/d/1010026827 |website=Alexander Street |accessdate=4 March 2020}}\n# {{cite web |title=Georgiana Bruce Kirby |url=http://newbrookfarm.org/programs/the-women-of-brook-farm/georgiana-bruce-kirby/ |website=New Brook Farm |accessdate=4 March 2020}}\n\n{{ authority control}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kirby, Georgiana Bruce}}\n[[Category:1818 births]]\n[[Category:1887 deaths]]\n[[Category:English emigrants to the United States]]\n[[Category:English expatriates in Canada]]\n[[Category:American schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:English expatriates in France]]\n[[Category:English schoolteachers]]\n[[Category:American diarists]]\n[[Category:American governesses]]\n[[Category:Women diarists]]\n[[Category:19th-century American short story writers]]\n[[Category:19th-century American women writers]]\n[[Category:American women short story writers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Lead missing|date=March 2020}}\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2020}}\n{{No footnotes|date=March 2020}}\n{{Overly detailed|date=March 2020}}\n{{Tone|date=March 2020}}\n}}\n'''Georgiana Bruce Kirby''' was born on December 7, 1818, in Bristol, England.

He joined the [[James Munro (Australian politician)|James Munro]] ministry in November 1890 as Minister of Defence and of Education, but withdrew when the ministry was reconstructed under [[William Shiels]] in February 1892, because he was unable to agree with Shiels's adhesion to the \"one man one vote\" principle.\n\nAlthough Sargood' political leanings were conservative, he had piloted the first Factories Act through the Council with skill, and in his own firm, the Saturday half-holiday had been brought in as far back as 1852.

Founded on this site in 1845, it is the oldest Baptist church in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. It is known as the former church of the outspoken minister [[Tim Costello]], brother of the former [[Treasurer of Australia]], [[Peter Costello]].\n\n==History==\nThe first Baptist service in Melbourne was held in 1838 in a tent on a vacant allotment of land opposite the present church. The first chapel was built on the current site in 1845. In the late 1850s it was decided to enlarge the building. The current church was designed [[Joseph Reed (architect)|Joseph Reed]], the architect who designed the [[Melbourne Town Hall]] and several other prominent Melbourne churches, and the new church was opened in 1862. Unlike most Melbourne churches of the period, which are either [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] or [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], Collins St Baptist is in the form of a classical temple, with four [[Corinthian columns]] facing the street. According to the church's website, this \"reflects the Baptist understanding of the church as a gathered community of believers rather than as a special building.\"\n\n==Building==\nIn conformity with the Baptist dislike of decoration in churches, the interior has plain plastered walls. It has arched moulded windows, a double aisle and side seats facing the [[pulpit]]. A central raised pulpit emphasises the stress in Baptist theology on the Word of God being read and preached as central features of the services of worship. Seating is arranged in a \"U\" shape around the central axis determined by the pulpit and the Communion table. There is no form of decoration other than some detail in the windows and carving on the pulpit and Communion furniture. No cross or symbol appears in the church.\n\nBaptist tradition also disapproved of music in churches, but in 1854 a small organ was installed. In 1885 the a larger organ was installed. This was restored and expanded in 1974.\n\nJim Barr was appointed a minister of Collins Street Baptist Church in 1991, when he established the Urban Mission Unit (now known as Urban Seed), recruited the first group of mission interns and implemented the SEEDS training program. This time was followed by his appointment as the Pastor at Collins Street Baptist Church from 1994 to 2000. During this time Jim was responsible for the pastoral and liturgical leadership of the Church community as well as taking a keen interest in the world around the Collins Street church.\n\n==People==\n[[Tim Costello]], a lawyer, republican activist and former [[St Kilda, Victoria|Mayor of St Kilda]] as well as a Baptist minister, was appointed the minister of the Collins Street Baptist Church and director of the Urban Mission Unit in 1995, the year before his brother, [[Peter Costello]], became the federal treasurer. Tim Costello's outspoken comments on many social and political issues brought new attention to the church. Under his leadership, the Urban Mission Unit rose to prominence as a leading voice on urban, business, social and political issues including homelessness, drug addiction, [[problem gambling]] and poverty.  The Urban Mission Unit changed its name to Urban Seed in 2001.  Costello left the position in 2004 on being appointed chief executive officer of [[World Vision]] Australia. The senior minister is now the Revd Simon Holt.\n\nSeveral historically notable people have been members of the church.

Founded on this site in 1845, it is the oldest Baptist church in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. It is known as the former church of the outspoken minister [[Tim Costello]], brother of the former [[Treasurer of Australia]], [[Peter Costello]].\n\n==History==\nThe first Baptist service in Melbourne was held in 1838 in a tent on a vacant allotment of land opposite the present church. The first chapel was built on the current site in 1845. In the late 1850s it was decided to enlarge the building. The current church was designed [[Joseph Reed (architect)|Joseph Reed]], the architect who designed the [[Melbourne Town Hall]] and several other prominent Melbourne churches, and the new church was opened in 1862. Unlike most Melbourne churches of the period, which are either [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] or [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], Collins St Baptist is in the form of a classical temple, with four [[Corinthian columns]] facing the street. According to the church's website, this \"reflects the Baptist understanding of the church as a gathered community of believers rather than as a special building.\"\n\n==Building==\nIn conformity with the Baptist dislike of decoration in churches, the interior has plain plastered walls. It has arched moulded windows, a double aisle and side seats facing the [[pulpit]]. A central raised pulpit emphasises the stress in Baptist theology on the Word of God being read and preached as central features of the services of worship. Seating is arranged in a \"U\" shape around the central axis determined by the pulpit and the Communion table. There is no form of decoration other than some detail in the windows and carving on the pulpit and Communion furniture. No cross or symbol appears in the church.\n\nBaptist tradition also disapproved of music in churches, but in 1854 a small organ was installed. In 1885 the a larger organ was installed. This was restored and expanded in 1974.\n\nJim Barr was appointed a minister of Collins Street Baptist Church in 1991, when he established the Urban Mission Unit (now known as Urban Seed), recruited the first group of mission interns and implemented the SEEDS training program. This time was followed by his appointment as the Pastor at Collins Street Baptist Church from 1994 to 2000. During this time Jim was responsible for the pastoral and liturgical leadership of the Church community as well as taking a keen interest in the world around the Collins Street church.\n\n==People==\n[[Tim Costello]], a lawyer, republican activist and former [[St Kilda, Victoria|Mayor of St Kilda]] as well as a Baptist minister, was appointed the minister of the Collins Street Baptist Church and director of the Urban Mission Unit in 1995, the year before his brother, [[Peter Costello]], became the federal treasurer. Tim Costello's outspoken comments on many social and political issues brought new attention to the church. Under his leadership, the Urban Mission Unit rose to prominence as a leading voice on urban, business, social and political issues including homelessness, drug addiction, [[problem gambling]] and poverty.  The Urban Mission Unit changed its name to Urban Seed in 2001.  Costello left the position in 2004 on being appointed chief executive officer of [[World Vision]] Australia. The senior minister is now the Revd Simon Holt.\n\nSeveral historically notable people have been members of the church. During the early 20th century numerous women active in the Victorian women's movement were members, including [[Cecilia Downing]], [[Margaret McLean]] and [[Bessie Rees]].<ref>Smart, J.

Test cricket, which only occurred between Australia and England at the time, was limited by the long distance between the two countries, which would take several months by sea. Despite Australia's much smaller population, the team was very competitive in early games, producing stars such as [[Jack Blackham]], [[Billy Murdoch]], [[Fred Spofforth|Fred \"The Demon\" Spofforth]], [[George Bonnor]], [[Percy McDonnell]], [[George Giffen]] and [[Charles Turner (Australian cricketer)|Charles \"The Terror\" Turner]]. Most cricketers at the time were either from [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales]] or [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]], with the notable exception of George Giffen, the star [[South Australia Redbacks|South Australian]] [[all-rounder]].\n\nA highlight of Australia's early history was the 1882 Test match against England at [[The Oval]]. In this match, Fred Spofforth took 7/44 in the game's fourth innings to save the match by preventing England from making their 85-run target. After this match ''[[The Sporting Times]]'', a major newspaper in London at the time, printed a mock obituary in which the death of English cricket was proclaimed and the announcement made that \"the body was cremated and the ashes taken to Australia.\" This was the start of the famous [[The Ashes|Ashes]] series in which Australia and England play a series of Test matches to decide the holder of the Ashes. To this day, the contest is one of the fiercest rivalries in sport.\n\n===Golden Age===\n{{main|History of Australian cricket from 1890\u201391 to 1900|History of Australian cricket from 1900\u201301 to 1918}}\n\nThe so-called 'Golden Age' of Australian Test cricket occurred around the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, with the team under the captaincy of [[Joe Darling]], [[Monty Noble]] and [[Clem Hill]] winning eight of ten tours. It is considered to have lasted from the 1897\u201398 English tour of Australia and the 1910\u201311 South African tour of Australia. Outstanding batsmen such as Joe Darling, Clem Hill, [[Reggie Duff]], [[Syd Gregory]], [[Warren Bardsley]] and [[Victor Trumper]], brilliant all-rounders including Monty Noble, George Giffen, [[Harry Trott]] and [[Warwick Armstrong]] and excellent bowlers including [[Ernie Jones (Australian sportsman)|Ernie Jones]], [[Hugh Trumble]], [[Tibby Cotter]], [[Bill Howell (cricketer)|Bill Howell]], [[Jack Saunders (cricketer, born 1876)|Jack Saunders]] and [[Bill Whitty]], all helped Australia to become the dominant cricketing nation for most of this period.\n\nVictor Trumper became one of Australia's first sporting heroes, and was widely considered Australia's greatest batsman before [[Don Bradman|Bradman]] and one of the most popular players. He played a record (at the time) number of Tests at 49 and scored 3163 (another record) runs at a high for the time average of 39.04. His early death in 1915 at the age of 37 from kidney disease caused national mourning. The ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'', in its obituary for him, called him Australia's greatest batsman:  \"''Of all the great Australian batsmen Victor Trumper was by general consent the best and most brilliant.''\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/player/7980.html |title=Victor Trumper &#124; Cricket Players and Officials |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=14 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170130172440/http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/player/7980.html |archive-date=30 January 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe years leading up to the start of World War I were marred by [[Big Six cricket dispute of 1912|conflict]] between the players, led by Clem Hill, Victor Trumper and [[Frank Laver]], the [[Cricket Australia|Australian Board of Control for International Cricket]], led by [[Peter McAlister]], who was attempting to gain more control of tours from the players. This led to six leading players (the so-called \"Big Six\") walking out on the [[1912 Triangular Tournament]] in England, with Australia fielding what was generally considered a second-rate side. This was the last series before the war, and no more cricket was played by Australia for eight years, with Tibby Cotter being killed in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] during the war.\n\n===Cricket between the wars===\n{{main|History of Australian cricket from 1918\u201319 to 1930}}\nTest cricket resumed in the 1920/21 season in Australia with a [[English cricket team in Australia in 1920\u201321|touring English team]], [[List of England cricket captains|captained]] by [[Johnny Douglas]] losing all five Tests to Australia, captained by the \"Big Ship\" Warwick Armstrong. Several players from before the war, including Warwick Armstrong, [[Charlie Macartney]], [[Charles Kelleway]], [[Warren Bardsley]] and the wicket-keeper [[Sammy Carter]], were instrumental in the team's success, as well as new players [[Herbie Collins]], [[Jack Ryder (cricketer)|Jack Ryder]], [[Bert Oldfield]], the spinner [[Arthur Mailey]] and the so-called \"twin destroyers\" [[Jack Gregory (cricketer)|Jack Gregory]] and [[Ted McDonald]]. The team continued its success on the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1921|1921 tour of England]], winning three out of the five Tests in [[Warwick Armstrong]]'s last series. The side was, on the whole, inconsistent in the latter half of the 1920s, losing its first home [[The Ashes|Ashes series]] since the 1911\u201312 season in 1928\u201329.\n\n===The Bradman era===\n{{main|History of Australian cricket from 1930\u201331 to 1945}}\nThe [[Australian cricket team in England in 1930|1930 tour of England]] heralded a new age of success for the Australian team. The team, led by [[Bill Woodfull]] \u2013 the \"Great Un-bowlable\" \u2013 featured legends of the game including [[Bill Ponsford]], [[Stan McCabe]], [[Clarrie Grimmett]] and the young pair of [[Archie Jackson]] and [[Donald Bradman|Don Bradman]]. Bradman was the outstanding batsman of the series, scoring a record 974 runs, including one century, two double centuries and one [[List of Test cricket triple centuries|triple century]], a massive score of 334 at Leeds which including 309 runs in a day. Jackson died of [[tuberculosis]] at the age of 23 three years later, after playing eight Tests. The team was widely considered unstoppable, winning nine of its next ten Tests.\n\nThe 1932\u201333 England tour of Australia is considered one of the most infamous episodes of cricket, due to the England team's use of [[bodyline]], where captain [[Douglas Jardine]] instructed his bowlers [[Bill Voce]] and [[Harold Larwood]] to bowl fast, short-pitched deliveries aimed at the bodies of the Australian batsmen. The tactic, although effective, was widely considered by Australian crowds as vicious and unsporting. Injuries to Bill Woodfull, who was struck over the heart, and [[Bert Oldfield]], who received a fractured skull (although from a non-bodyline ball), exacerbated the situation, almost causing a full-scale riot from the 50 000 fans at the [[Adelaide Oval]] for the third Test. The conflict almost escalated into a diplomatic incident between the two countries, as leading Australian political figures, including the [[Governors of South Australia|Governor of South Australia]], [[Alexander Hore-Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie|Alexander Hore-Ruthven]], protested to their English counterparts. The series ended in a 4\u20131 win for England but the bodyline tactics used were banned the year after.\n\nThe Australian team put the result of this series behind them, winning their next tour of England in 1934. The team was led by Bill Woodfull on his final tour and was notably dominated by Ponsford and Bradman, who twice put on partnerships of over 380 runs, with Bradman once again scoring a triple-century at Leeds. The bowling was dominated by the [[Spin bowling|spin]] pair of [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]] and Clarrie Grimmett, who took 53 wickets between them, with O'Reilly twice taking seven-wicket hauls.\n\nSir Donald Bradman is widely considered the greatest batsman of all time.<ref>{{cite web |author=mohankaus |url=http://i3j3cricket.com/2009/01/17/icc-best-ever-batsmen-and-bowlers/ |title=ICC's \"Best Ever\" batsmen and bowlers! |publisher=i3j3Cricket :: A blog for fans of Indian cricket... |date=17 January 2009 |accessdate=14 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102083233/http://i3j3cricket.com/2009/01/17/icc-best-ever-batsmen-and-bowlers/ |archive-date=2 January 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldcricketwatch.com/stories/feature/the-10-greatest-batsmen-ever/ |title=The 10 Greatest Batsmen Ever |publisher=World Cricket Watch |date=15 October 2009 |accessdate=14 January 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110211234312/http://worldcricketwatch.com/stories/feature/the-10-greatest-batsmen-ever/| archivedate= 11 February 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> He dominated the sport from 1930 until his retirement in 1948, setting new records for the highest score in a Test innings (334 vs England at [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]] in 1930), the most runs (6996), the most [[Century (cricket)|centuries]] (29), the most double centuries and the highest Test and [[first-class cricket|first-class]] batting averages.

He is generally considered one of Australia's greatest sporting heroes.\n\nTest cricket was again [[Cricket in World War II|interrupted by war]], with the last Test series in 1938 made notable by [[Len Hutton]] scoring a world record 364 for England, with [[Chuck Fleetwood-Smith]] conceding 298 runs in England's world record total of 7/903. [[Ross Gregory]], a notable young batsman who played two Tests before the war, was killed in the war.\n\n===Cricket after World War II===\n{{main|History of Australian cricket from 1945\u201346 to 1960}}\nThe team continued its success after the end of the [[Second World War]], with the first Test (also Australia's first against New Zealand) being played in the 1945\u201346 season against New Zealand. Australia was by far the most successful team of the 1940s, being undefeated throughout the decade, winning two Ashes series against England and its first Test series against [[India national cricket team|India]]. The team capitalised on its ageing stars Bradman, [[Sid Barnes]], [[Bill Brown (cricketer)|Bill Brown]] and [[Lindsay Hassett]] while new talent, including [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]], [[Don Tallon]], [[Arthur Morris]], [[Neil Harvey]], [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] and the [[fast bowling]] pair of [[Ray Lindwall]] and [[Keith Miller]], who all made their debut in the latter half of the 1940s, and were to form the basis of the team for a good part of the next decade. The [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|team that Don Bradman led to England in 1948]] gained the moniker ''The Invincibles'', after going through the tour without losing a single game. Of 31 first-class games played during the tour, they won 23 and drew 8, including winning the five-match Test series 4\u20130, with one draw. The tour was particularly notable for the [[Fourth Test, 1948 Ashes series|fourth Test]] of the series, in which Australia won by seven wickets chasing a target of 404, setting a new record for the highest [[List of cricket terms#R|run chase]] in Test cricket, with Arthur Morris and Bradman both scoring centuries, as well as for the final Test in the series, Bradman's last, where he finished with a duck in his last innings after needing only four runs to secure a career average of 100.\n\nAustralia was less successful in the 1950s, losing three consecutive Ashes series to England, including a horrendous [[Australian cricket team in England in 1956|1956 Tour of England]], where the 'spin twins' [[Jim Laker|Laker]] and [[Tony Lock|Lock]] destroyed Australia, taking 61 wickets between them, including Laker taking 19 wickets in the game (a first-class record) at [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]], a game dubbed '''Laker's Match'''.\n\nHowever, the team rebounded to win five consecutive series in the latter half of the 1950s, first under the leadership of Ian Johnson, then [[Ian Craig]] and [[Richie Benaud]]. The [[West Indian cricket team in Australia in 1960\u201361|series against the West Indies in the 1960\u201361 season]] was notable for the [[Tied Test]] in the first game at [[the Gabba]], which was the first in Test cricket. Australia ended up winning the series 2\u20131 after a hard-fought series that was praised for its excellent standards and sense of fair play. Stand-out players in that series as well as through the early part of the 1960s were Richie Benaud, who took a then-record number of wickets as a [[Leg spin|leg-spinner]] and who also captained Australia in 28 Tests, including 24 without defeat; [[Alan Keith Davidson|Alan Davidson]], who was a notable fast-bowler and also became the first player to take 10 wickets and make 100 runs in the same game in the first Test; [[Bob Simpson (cricketer)|Bob Simpson]], who also later captained Australia for two different periods of time; [[Colin McDonald (Australian cricketer)|Colin McDonald]], the first-choice opening batsman for most of the 1950s and early '60s; [[Norm O'Neill]], who made 181 in the Tied Test; [[Neil Harvey]], towards the end of his long career; and [[Wally Grout]], an excellent [[wicket-keeper]] who died at the age of 41.\n\n===1970s and onward===\nThe [[Centenary Test]] was played in March 1977 at the MCG to celebrate 100 years since the first Test was played. Australia won the match by 45 runs, an identical result to the first Test match.<ref>[http://www.theroar.com.au/2009/11/01/the-1977-centenary-test/ Remembering the 1977 Centenary Test] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216152050/http://www.theroar.com.au/2009/11/01/the-1977-centenary-test/ |date=16 December 2011 }} \u2013 The Roar. Published 1 November 2009. Retrieved 4 May 2011.</ref>\n\nIn May 1977, [[Kerry Packer]] announced he was organising a breakaway competition \u2013 [[World Series Cricket]] (WSC) \u2013 after the [[Australian Cricket Board]] (ACB) refused to accept [[Nine Network|Channel Nine]]'s bid to gain exclusive television rights to Australia's Test matches in 1976. Packer secretly signed leading international cricketers to his competition, including 28 Australians. Almost all of the Australian Test team at the time were signed to WSC \u2013 notable exceptions including [[Gary Cosier]], [[Geoff Dymock]], [[Kim Hughes]] and [[Craig Serjeant]] \u2013 and the Australian selectors were forced to pick what was generally considered a third-rate team from players in the [[Sheffield Shield]]. Former player Bob Simpson, who had retired 10 years previously after a conflict with the board, was recalled at the age of 41 to captain Australia against India. [[Jeff Thomson]] was named deputy in a team that included seven debutants. Australia managed to win the series 3\u20132, mainly thanks to the batting of Simpson, who scored 539 runs, including two centuries; and the bowling of [[Wayne Clark (cricketer)|Wayne Clark]], who took 28 wickets. Australia lost the next series 3\u20131 against the West Indies, which was fielding a full strength team; and also lost the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1978\u201379|1978\u201379 Ashes series]] 5\u20131, the team's worst Ashes result in Australia. [[Graham Yallop]] was named as captain for the Ashes, with Kim Hughes taking over for the 1979\u201380 tour of India. [[Rodney Hogg]] took 41 wickets in his debut series, an Australian record. WSC players returned to the team for the 1979\u201380 season after a settlement between the ACB and Kerry Packer. [[Greg Chappell]] was reinstated as captain.\n\nThe [[underarm bowling incident of 1981]] occurred when, in an [[One Day International|ODI]] against New Zealand, Greg Chappell instructed his brother [[Trevor Chappell|Trevor]] to bowl an [[underarm bowling|underarm delivery]] to New Zealand batsman [[Brian McKechnie (sportsman)|Brian McKechnie]], with New Zealand needing a [[Six (cricket)|six]] to tie off the last ball. The aftermath of the incident soured political relations between Australia and New Zealand, with several leading political and cricketing figures calling it \"unsportsmanlike\" and \"[[not in the spirit of cricket]]\".\n\nAustralia continued its success up until the early 1980s, built around the Chappell brothers, [[Dennis Lillee]], Jeff Thomson and [[Rod Marsh]]. The 1980s was a period of relative mediocrity after the turmoil caused by the [[Rebel tours of South Africa#Australian tours, 1985/86 & 1986/87|Rebel Tours of South Africa]] and the subsequent retirement of several key players. The rebel tours were funded by the [[South African Cricket Board]] to compete against its national side, which had been banned\u2014along with many other sports, including Olympic athletes\u2014from competing internationally, due to the South African government's racist apartheid policies. Some of Australia's best players were poached: Graham Yallop, [[Carl Rackemann]], [[Terry Alderman]], Rodney Hogg, Kim Hughes, [[John Dyson (cricketer)|John Dyson]], [[Greg Shipperd]], [[Steve Rixon]] and [[Steve Smith (cricketer, born 1961)|Steve Smith]] amongst others. These players were handed three-year suspensions by the Australian Cricket Board which greatly weakened the player pool for the national sides, as most were either current representative players or on the verge of gaining honours.\n\nUnder the captaincy of [[Allan Border]] and the new fielding standards put in place by new coach Bob Simpson, the team was restructured and gradually rebuilt their cricketing stocks. Some of the rebel players returned to the national side after serving their suspensions, including [[Trevor Hohns]], Carl Rackemann and Terry Alderman. During these lean years, it was the batsmen Border, [[David Boon]], [[Dean Jones (cricketer)|Dean Jones]], the young Steve Waugh and the bowling feats of Alderman, [[Bruce Reid]], [[Craig McDermott]], [[Merv Hughes]] and to a lesser extent, [[Geoff Lawson (cricketer)|Geoff Lawson]] who kept the Australian side afloat.\n\nWith the emergence of players such as [[Ian Healy]], [[Mark Taylor (cricketer)|Mark Taylor]], [[Geoff Marsh]], [[Mark Waugh]], and [[Greg Matthews]] in the late 1980s, Australia was on the way back from the doldrums. Winning [[1989 Ashes series|the Ashes in 1989]], the Australians got a roll on beating [[Pakistani cricket team in Australia in 1989\u201390|Pakistan]], [[Sri Lankan cricket team in Australia in 1989\u201390|Sri Lanka]] and then followed it up with another Ashes win on home soil [[1990\u201391 Ashes series|in 1991]]. The Australians went on [[Australian cricket team in West Indies in 1990\u201391|to the West Indies]] and had their chances but ended up losing the series. However, they bounced back and beat the Indians in their next Test series. With the retirement of the champion but defensive, Allan Border, a new era of attacking cricket had begun under the leadership of firstly Mark Taylor and then [[Steve Waugh]].\n\nThe 1990s and early 21st century were arguably Australia's most successful periods, unbeaten in all Ashes series played bar the famous [[2005 Ashes series|2005 series]] and achieving a hat-trick of [[Cricket World Cup|World Cups]]. This success has been attributed to the restructuring of the team and system by Border, successive aggressive captains, and the effectiveness of several key players, most notably [[Glenn McGrath]], [[Shane Warne]], [[Justin Langer]], [[Matthew Hayden]], Steve Waugh, [[Adam Gilchrist]], [[Michael Hussey]] and [[Ricky Ponting]]. Following the 2006/07 Ashes series which Australia won 5 nil, Australia slipped in the rankings after the retirements of key players. In the 2013/14 Ashes series, Australia again defeated England 5 nil and climbed back to third in the ICC International Test rankings. In February/March 2014, Australia beat [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]], the number 1 team in the world, 2\u20131 and overtook them to return to the top of the rankings. In 2015, Australia won the World Cup, losing just one game for the tournament.\n\n{{As of|2018|12}}, Australia was ranked fifth in the ICC Test Championship,<ref name=\"Test ranking\" /> sixth in the ICC ODI Championship<ref name=\"ODI ranking\" /> and fourth in the ICC T20I Championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/rankings/mens/team-rankings/t20i|title=ICC T20I Rankings|date=23 December 2018|publisher=ICC|accessdate=1 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180222122503/https://www.icc-cricket.com/rankings/mens/team-rankings/t20i|archive-date=22 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== 2018 ball-tampering controversy ====\n{{main|2018 Australian ball-tampering scandal}}\nOn 25 March 2018, during [[Australian cricket team in South Africa in 2017\u201318|the third Test match against hosts South Africa]];

There has been a variety of different styles and layouts used in both forms of the limited-overs game, with coloured clothing (sometimes known as \"pyjamas\") being introduced for World Series Cricket in the late 1970s. The Alinta or Qantas logo is prominently displayed on the shirts and other gears. The current home ODI kit consists of green as the primary colour and gold as the secondary colour.

Test cricket, which only occurred between Australia and England at the time, was limited by the long distance between the two countries, which would take several months by sea. Despite Australia's much smaller population, the team was very competitive in early games, producing stars such as [[Jack Blackham]], [[Billy Murdoch]], [[Fred Spofforth|Fred \"The Demon\" Spofforth]], [[George Bonnor]], [[Percy McDonnell]], [[George Giffen]] and [[Charles Turner (Australian cricketer)|Charles \"The Terror\" Turner]]. Most cricketers at the time were either from [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales]] or [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]], with the notable exception of George Giffen, the star [[South Australia Redbacks|South Australian]] [[all-rounder]].\n\nA highlight of Australia's early history was the 1882 Test match against England at [[The Oval]]. In this match, Fred Spofforth took 7/44 in the game's fourth innings to save the match by preventing England from making their 85-run target. After this match ''[[The Sporting Times]]'', a major newspaper in London at the time, printed a mock obituary in which the death of English cricket was proclaimed and the announcement made that \"the body was cremated and the ashes taken to Australia.\" This was the start of the famous [[The Ashes|Ashes]] series in which Australia and England play a series of Test matches to decide the holder of the Ashes. To this day, the contest is one of the fiercest rivalries in sport.\n\n===Golden Age===\n{{main|History of Australian cricket from 1890\u201391 to 1900|History of Australian cricket from 1900\u201301 to 1918}}\n\nThe so-called 'Golden Age' of Australian Test cricket occurred around the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, with the team under the captaincy of [[Joe Darling]], [[Monty Noble]] and [[Clem Hill]] winning eight of ten tours. It is considered to have lasted from the 1897\u201398 English tour of Australia and the 1910\u201311 South African tour of Australia. Outstanding batsmen such as Joe Darling, Clem Hill, [[Reggie Duff]], [[Syd Gregory]], [[Warren Bardsley]] and [[Victor Trumper]], brilliant all-rounders including Monty Noble, George Giffen, [[Harry Trott]] and [[Warwick Armstrong]] and excellent bowlers including [[Ernie Jones (Australian sportsman)|Ernie Jones]], [[Hugh Trumble]], [[Tibby Cotter]], [[Bill Howell (cricketer)|Bill Howell]], [[Jack Saunders (cricketer, born 1876)|Jack Saunders]] and [[Bill Whitty]], all helped Australia to become the dominant cricketing nation for most of this period.\n\nVictor Trumper became one of Australia's first sporting heroes, and was widely considered Australia's greatest batsman before [[Don Bradman|Bradman]] and one of the most popular players. He played a record (at the time) number of Tests at 49 and scored 3163 (another record) runs at a high for the time average of 39.04. His early death in 1915 at the age of 37 from kidney disease caused national mourning. The ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'', in its obituary for him, called him Australia's greatest batsman:  \"''Of all the great Australian batsmen Victor Trumper was by general consent the best and most brilliant.''\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/player/7980.html |title=Victor Trumper &#124; Cricket Players and Officials |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=14 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170130172440/http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/player/7980.html |archive-date=30 January 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe years leading up to the start of World War I were marred by [[Big Six cricket dispute of 1912|conflict]] between the players, led by Clem Hill, Victor Trumper and [[Frank Laver]], the [[Cricket Australia|Australian Board of Control for International Cricket]], led by [[Peter McAlister]], who was attempting to gain more control of tours from the players. This led to six leading players (the so-called \"Big Six\") walking out on the [[1912 Triangular Tournament]] in England, with Australia fielding what was generally considered a second-rate side. This was the last series before the war, and no more cricket was played by Australia for eight years, with Tibby Cotter being killed in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] during the war.\n\n===Cricket between the wars===\n{{main|History of Australian cricket from 1918\u201319 to 1930}}\nTest cricket resumed in the 1920/21 season in Australia with a [[English cricket team in Australia in 1920\u201321|touring English team]], [[List of England cricket captains|captained]] by [[Johnny Douglas]] losing all five Tests to Australia, captained by the \"Big Ship\" Warwick Armstrong. Several players from before the war, including Warwick Armstrong, [[Charlie Macartney]], [[Charles Kelleway]], [[Warren Bardsley]] and the wicket-keeper [[Sammy Carter]], were instrumental in the team's success, as well as new players [[Herbie Collins]], [[Jack Ryder (cricketer)|Jack Ryder]], [[Bert Oldfield]], the spinner [[Arthur Mailey]] and the so-called \"twin destroyers\" [[Jack Gregory (cricketer)|Jack Gregory]] and [[Ted McDonald]]. The team continued its success on the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1921|1921 tour of England]], winning three out of the five Tests in [[Warwick Armstrong]]'s last series. The side was, on the whole, inconsistent in the latter half of the 1920s, losing its first home [[The Ashes|Ashes series]] since the 1911\u201312 season in 1928\u201329.\n\n===The Bradman era===\n{{main|History of Australian cricket from 1930\u201331 to 1945}}\nThe [[Australian cricket team in England in 1930|1930 tour of England]] heralded a new age of success for the Australian team. The team, led by [[Bill Woodfull]] \u2013 the \"Great Un-bowlable\" \u2013 featured legends of the game including [[Bill Ponsford]], [[Stan McCabe]], [[Clarrie Grimmett]] and the young pair of [[Archie Jackson]] and [[Donald Bradman|Don Bradman]]. Bradman was the outstanding batsman of the series, scoring a record 974 runs, including one century, two double centuries and one [[List of Test cricket triple centuries|triple century]], a massive score of 334 at Leeds which including 309 runs in a day. Jackson died of [[tuberculosis]] at the age of 23 three years later, after playing eight Tests. The team was widely considered unstoppable, winning nine of its next ten Tests.\n\nThe 1932\u201333 England tour of Australia is considered one of the most infamous episodes of cricket, due to the England team's use of [[bodyline]], where captain [[Douglas Jardine]] instructed his bowlers [[Bill Voce]] and [[Harold Larwood]] to bowl fast, short-pitched deliveries aimed at the bodies of the Australian batsmen. The tactic, although effective, was widely considered by Australian crowds as vicious and unsporting. Injuries to Bill Woodfull, who was struck over the heart, and [[Bert Oldfield]], who received a fractured skull (although from a non-bodyline ball), exacerbated the situation, almost causing a full-scale riot from the 50 000 fans at the [[Adelaide Oval]] for the third Test. The conflict almost escalated into a diplomatic incident between the two countries, as leading Australian political figures, including the [[Governors of South Australia|Governor of South Australia]], [[Alexander Hore-Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie|Alexander Hore-Ruthven]], protested to their English counterparts. The series ended in a 4\u20131 win for England but the bodyline tactics used were banned the year after.\n\nThe Australian team put the result of this series behind them, winning their next tour of England in 1934. The team was led by Bill Woodfull on his final tour and was notably dominated by Ponsford and Bradman, who twice put on partnerships of over 380 runs, with Bradman once again scoring a triple-century at Leeds. The bowling was dominated by the [[Spin bowling|spin]] pair of [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]] and Clarrie Grimmett, who took 53 wickets between them, with O'Reilly twice taking seven-wicket hauls.\n\nSir Donald Bradman is widely considered the greatest batsman of all time.<ref>{{cite web |author=mohankaus |url=http://i3j3cricket.com/2009/01/17/icc-best-ever-batsmen-and-bowlers/ |title=ICC's \"Best Ever\" batsmen and bowlers! |publisher=i3j3Cricket :: A blog for fans of Indian cricket... |date=17 January 2009 |accessdate=14 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102083233/http://i3j3cricket.com/2009/01/17/icc-best-ever-batsmen-and-bowlers/ |archive-date=2 January 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldcricketwatch.com/stories/feature/the-10-greatest-batsmen-ever/ |title=The 10 Greatest Batsmen Ever |publisher=World Cricket Watch |date=15 October 2009 |accessdate=14 January 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110211234312/http://worldcricketwatch.com/stories/feature/the-10-greatest-batsmen-ever/| archivedate= 11 February 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> He dominated the sport from 1930 until his retirement in 1948, setting new records for the highest score in a Test innings (334 vs England at [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]] in 1930), the most runs (6996), the most [[Century (cricket)|centuries]] (29), the most double centuries and the highest Test and [[first-class cricket|first-class]] batting averages. His record for the highest Test batting average \u2013 99.94 \u2013 has never been beaten. It is almost 40 runs per innings above the next highest average. He would have finished with an average of over 100 runs per innings if he had not been dismissed for a [[Duck (cricket)|duck]] in his last Test. He was [[knight]]ed in 1949 for services to cricket.

[[Ross Gregory]], a notable young batsman who played two Tests before the war, was killed in the war.\n\n===Cricket after World War II===\n{{main|History of Australian cricket from 1945\u201346 to 1960}}\nThe team continued its success after the end of the [[Second World War]], with the first Test (also Australia's first against New Zealand) being played in the 1945\u201346 season against New Zealand. Australia was by far the most successful team of the 1940s, being undefeated throughout the decade, winning two Ashes series against England and its first Test series against [[India national cricket team|India]]. The team capitalised on its ageing stars Bradman, [[Sid Barnes]], [[Bill Brown (cricketer)|Bill Brown]] and [[Lindsay Hassett]] while new talent, including [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]], [[Don Tallon]], [[Arthur Morris]], [[Neil Harvey]], [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]] and the [[fast bowling]] pair of [[Ray Lindwall]] and [[Keith Miller]], who all made their debut in the latter half of the 1940s, and were to form the basis of the team for a good part of the next decade. The [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|team that Don Bradman led to England in 1948]] gained the moniker ''The Invincibles'', after going through the tour without losing a single game. Of 31 first-class games played during the tour, they won 23 and drew 8, including winning the five-match Test series 4\u20130, with one draw. The tour was particularly notable for the [[Fourth Test, 1948 Ashes series|fourth Test]] of the series, in which Australia won by seven wickets chasing a target of 404, setting a new record for the highest [[List of cricket terms#R|run chase]] in Test cricket, with Arthur Morris and Bradman both scoring centuries, as well as for the final Test in the series, Bradman's last, where he finished with a duck in his last innings after needing only four runs to secure a career average of 100.\n\nAustralia was less successful in the 1950s, losing three consecutive Ashes series to England, including a horrendous [[Australian cricket team in England in 1956|1956 Tour of England]], where the 'spin twins' [[Jim Laker|Laker]] and [[Tony Lock|Lock]] destroyed Australia, taking 61 wickets between them, including Laker taking 19 wickets in the game (a first-class record) at [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]], a game dubbed '''Laker's Match'''.\n\nHowever, the team rebounded to win five consecutive series in the latter half of the 1950s, first under the leadership of Ian Johnson, then [[Ian Craig]] and [[Richie Benaud]]. The [[West Indian cricket team in Australia in 1960\u201361|series against the West Indies in the 1960\u201361 season]] was notable for the [[Tied Test]] in the first game at [[the Gabba]], which was the first in Test cricket. Australia ended up winning the series 2\u20131 after a hard-fought series that was praised for its excellent standards and sense of fair play. Stand-out players in that series as well as through the early part of the 1960s were Richie Benaud, who took a then-record number of wickets as a [[Leg spin|leg-spinner]] and who also captained Australia in 28 Tests, including 24 without defeat; [[Alan Keith Davidson|Alan Davidson]], who was a notable fast-bowler and also became the first player to take 10 wickets and make 100 runs in the same game in the first Test; [[Bob Simpson (cricketer)|Bob Simpson]], who also later captained Australia for two different periods of time; [[Colin McDonald (Australian cricketer)|Colin McDonald]], the first-choice opening batsman for most of the 1950s and early '60s; [[Norm O'Neill]], who made 181 in the Tied Test; [[Neil Harvey]], towards the end of his long career; and [[Wally Grout]], an excellent [[wicket-keeper]] who died at the age of 41.\n\n===1970s and onward===\nThe [[Centenary Test]] was played in March 1977 at the MCG to celebrate 100 years since the first Test was played. Australia won the match by 45 runs, an identical result to the first Test match.<ref>[http://www.theroar.com.au/2009/11/01/the-1977-centenary-test/ Remembering the 1977 Centenary Test] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216152050/http://www.theroar.com.au/2009/11/01/the-1977-centenary-test/ |date=16 December 2011 }} \u2013 The Roar. Published 1 November 2009. Retrieved 4 May 2011.</ref>\n\nIn May 1977, [[Kerry Packer]] announced he was organising a breakaway competition \u2013 [[World Series Cricket]] (WSC) \u2013 after the [[Australian Cricket Board]] (ACB) refused to accept [[Nine Network|Channel Nine]]'s bid to gain exclusive television rights to Australia's Test matches in 1976. Packer secretly signed leading international cricketers to his competition, including 28 Australians. Almost all of the Australian Test team at the time were signed to WSC \u2013 notable exceptions including [[Gary Cosier]], [[Geoff Dymock]], [[Kim Hughes]] and [[Craig Serjeant]] \u2013 and the Australian selectors were forced to pick what was generally considered a third-rate team from players in the [[Sheffield Shield]]. Former player Bob Simpson, who had retired 10 years previously after a conflict with the board, was recalled at the age of 41 to captain Australia against India. [[Jeff Thomson]] was named deputy in a team that included seven debutants. Australia managed to win the series 3\u20132, mainly thanks to the batting of Simpson, who scored 539 runs, including two centuries; and the bowling of [[Wayne Clark (cricketer)|Wayne Clark]], who took 28 wickets. Australia lost the next series 3\u20131 against the West Indies, which was fielding a full strength team; and also lost the [[English cricket team in Australia in 1978\u201379|1978\u201379 Ashes series]] 5\u20131, the team's worst Ashes result in Australia. [[Graham Yallop]] was named as captain for the Ashes, with Kim Hughes taking over for the 1979\u201380 tour of India. [[Rodney Hogg]] took 41 wickets in his debut series, an Australian record. WSC players returned to the team for the 1979\u201380 season after a settlement between the ACB and Kerry Packer. [[Greg Chappell]] was reinstated as captain.\n\nThe [[underarm bowling incident of 1981]] occurred when, in an [[One Day International|ODI]] against New Zealand, Greg Chappell instructed his brother [[Trevor Chappell|Trevor]] to bowl an [[underarm bowling|underarm delivery]] to New Zealand batsman [[Brian McKechnie (sportsman)|Brian McKechnie]], with New Zealand needing a [[Six (cricket)|six]] to tie off the last ball. The aftermath of the incident soured political relations between Australia and New Zealand, with several leading political and cricketing figures calling it \"unsportsmanlike\" and \"[[not in the spirit of cricket]]\".\n\nAustralia continued its success up until the early 1980s, built around the Chappell brothers, [[Dennis Lillee]], Jeff Thomson and [[Rod Marsh]]. The 1980s was a period of relative mediocrity after the turmoil caused by the [[Rebel tours of South Africa#Australian tours, 1985/86 & 1986/87|Rebel Tours of South Africa]] and the subsequent retirement of several key players. The rebel tours were funded by the [[South African Cricket Board]] to compete against its national side, which had been banned\u2014along with many other sports, including Olympic athletes\u2014from competing internationally, due to the South African government's racist apartheid policies. Some of Australia's best players were poached: Graham Yallop, [[Carl Rackemann]], [[Terry Alderman]], Rodney Hogg, Kim Hughes, [[John Dyson (cricketer)|John Dyson]], [[Greg Shipperd]], [[Steve Rixon]] and [[Steve Smith (cricketer, born 1961)|Steve Smith]] amongst others. These players were handed three-year suspensions by the Australian Cricket Board which greatly weakened the player pool for the national sides, as most were either current representative players or on the verge of gaining honours.\n\nUnder the captaincy of [[Allan Border]] and the new fielding standards put in place by new coach Bob Simpson, the team was restructured and gradually rebuilt their cricketing stocks. Some of the rebel players returned to the national side after serving their suspensions, including [[Trevor Hohns]], Carl Rackemann and Terry Alderman. During these lean years, it was the batsmen Border, [[David Boon]], [[Dean Jones (cricketer)|Dean Jones]], the young Steve Waugh and the bowling feats of Alderman, [[Bruce Reid]], [[Craig McDermott]], [[Merv Hughes]] and to a lesser extent, [[Geoff Lawson (cricketer)|Geoff Lawson]] who kept the Australian side afloat.\n\nWith the emergence of players such as [[Ian Healy]], [[Mark Taylor (cricketer)|Mark Taylor]], [[Geoff Marsh]], [[Mark Waugh]], and [[Greg Matthews]] in the late 1980s, Australia was on the way back from the doldrums. Winning [[1989 Ashes series|the Ashes in 1989]], the Australians got a roll on beating [[Pakistani cricket team in Australia in 1989\u201390|Pakistan]], [[Sri Lankan cricket team in Australia in 1989\u201390|Sri Lanka]] and then followed it up with another Ashes win on home soil [[1990\u201391 Ashes series|in 1991]]. The Australians went on [[Australian cricket team in West Indies in 1990\u201391|to the West Indies]] and had their chances but ended up losing the series. However, they bounced back and beat the Indians in their next Test series. With the retirement of the champion but defensive, Allan Border, a new era of attacking cricket had begun under the leadership of firstly Mark Taylor and then [[Steve Waugh]].\n\nThe 1990s and early 21st century were arguably Australia's most successful periods, unbeaten in all Ashes series played bar the famous [[2005 Ashes series|2005 series]] and achieving a hat-trick of [[Cricket World Cup|World Cups]]. This success has been attributed to the restructuring of the team and system by Border, successive aggressive captains, and the effectiveness of several key players, most notably [[Glenn McGrath]], [[Shane Warne]], [[Justin Langer]], [[Matthew Hayden]], Steve Waugh, [[Adam Gilchrist]], [[Michael Hussey]] and [[Ricky Ponting]]. Following the 2006/07 Ashes series which Australia won 5 nil, Australia slipped in the rankings after the retirements of key players. In the 2013/14 Ashes series, Australia again defeated England 5 nil and climbed back to third in the ICC International Test rankings. In February/March 2014, Australia beat [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]], the number 1 team in the world, 2\u20131 and overtook them to return to the top of the rankings. In 2015, Australia won the World Cup, losing just one game for the tournament.\n\n{{As of|2018|12}}, Australia was ranked fifth in the ICC Test Championship,<ref name=\"Test ranking\" /> sixth in the ICC ODI Championship<ref name=\"ODI ranking\" /> and fourth in the ICC T20I Championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/rankings/mens/team-rankings/t20i|title=ICC T20I Rankings|date=23 December 2018|publisher=ICC|accessdate=1 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180222122503/https://www.icc-cricket.com/rankings/mens/team-rankings/t20i|archive-date=22 February 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== 2018 ball-tampering controversy ====\n{{main|2018 Australian ball-tampering scandal}}\nOn 25 March 2018, during [[Australian cricket team in South Africa in 2017\u201318|the third Test match against hosts South Africa]];

Players may choose any manufacturer for their other gear ([[Cricket bat|bat]], [[pads]], shoes, gloves, etc.).\n\nIn One Day International (ODI) cricket and Twenty20 International cricket, the team wears uniforms usually coloured [[green and gold]], the [[national colours of Australia]]. There has been a variety of different styles and layouts used in both forms of the limited-overs game, with coloured clothing (sometimes known as \"pyjamas\") being introduced for World Series Cricket in the late 1970s. The Alinta or Qantas logo is prominently displayed on the shirts and other gears. The current home ODI kit consists of green as the primary colour and gold as the secondary colour. The away kit is the opposite of the home kit with gold as the primary colour and green as the secondary colour. The home Twenty20 kit consists of black with the natural colours of Australia, green and gold strips.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cricket.com.au/news-display/ASICS-unveil-new-uniforms/25621/ |title=ASICS unveil new uniforms \u2013 Cricket Australia |publisher=Cricket.com.au |accessdate=22 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212044714/http://cricket.com.au/news-display/ASICS-unveil-new-uniforms/25621 |archivedate=12 December 2011  }}</ref> However, since Australia beat New Zealand at the MCG in the 2015 Cricket World Cup wearing the gold uniform, it has also become their primary colour, with the hats used being called 'floppy gold', formerly known as 'baggy gold', a limited-overs equivalent to a baggy green.<ref>{{cite web|title = Floppy Gold to rival Baggy Green?|url = http://www.cricket.com.au/news/george-bailey-yellow-floppy-hat-baggy-green-cricket-fashion-australia-odi-series-india-waca/2016-01-13|website = cricket.com.au|access-date = 12 January 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160115073521/http://www.cricket.com.au/news/george-bailey-yellow-floppy-hat-baggy-green-cricket-fashion-australia-odi-series-india-waca/2016-01-13|archive-date = 15 January 2016|url-status = live}}</ref> Until the early 2000s, in ODIs, Australia wore yellow helmets, before using green helmets as in test matches.\n\nFormer suppliers were Asics (1999), ISC (2000\u20132001), Fila (2002\u20132003) and Adidas (2004\u20132010) among others.

{"title_page": "Evolutionary psychology and culture", "text_new": "'''[[Evolutionary psychology]]''' has traditionally focused on individual-level behaviors, determined by species-typical psychological adaptations. Considerable work, though, has been done on how these adaptations shape and, ultimately govern, culture (Tooby and Cosmides, 1989).<ref name=\"Tooby Cosmides 1989\">{{cite journal|last1=Tooby|first1=J.|last2=Cosmides|first2=L.|title=Evolutionary psychology and the generation of culture, part I.

As opposed to a domain-general cultural acquisition program, where an individual passively receives culturally-transmitted material from the group, Tooby and Cosmides (1989), among others, argue that: \"the psyche evolved to generate adaptive rather than repetitive behavior, and hence critically analyzes the behavior of those surrounding it in highly structured and patterned ways, to be used as a rich (but by no means the only) source of information out of which to construct a 'private culture' or individually tailored [[adaptive system]]; in consequence, this system may or may not mirror the behavior of others in any given respect.\" (Tooby and Cosmides 1989).<ref name=\"Tooby Cosmides 1989\"/>\n\n==Epidemiological culture==\nThe [[Epidemiology of representations]], or cultural epidemiology, is a broad framework for understanding cultural phenomena by investigating the distribution of mental representations in and through populations.<ref name=\"Sperber 2001\">{{cite journal|last1=Sperber|first1=D.|title=Conceptual tools for a natural science of society and culture (Radcliffe-Brown Lecture in Social Anthropology 1999)|journal=Proceedings of the British Academy|date=2001|volume=111|pages=297\u2013317}}</ref> The theory of cultural epidemiology was largely developed by [[Dan Sperber]] to study society and cultures. The theory has implications for [[psychology]] and [[anthropology]].\nMental representations are transferred from person to person through cognitive causal chains. Sperber (2001) identified three different, yet interrelated, cognitive causal chains, outlined in Table 1. A cognitive causal chain (CCC) links a perception to an evolved, domain-specific response or process. For example:\n:On October 31, at 7:30 p.m., Mrs. Jones\u2019s doorbell rings. Mrs. Jones hears the doorbell, and assumes that there is somebody at the door. She remembers it is [[Halloween]]: she enjoyed receiving treats as a child, and now, as an adult, she enjoys giving them. She guesses that there must be children at the door ready to trick-or-treat, and that, if she opens, she will be able to give them the candies she has bought for the occasion. Mrs. Jones decides to open the door, and does so.<ref name=\"Sperber 2001\" />\nSocial Cognitive Causal Chains (SCCC) are inter-individual CCCs. Here, a CCC is used as an act of communication between people (i.e. the mental representation is shared between multiple people). Elaborating on the previous example: \n:On October 31, at 7:30 p.m., Mrs. Jones\u2019s doorbell rings. Mrs. Jones hears the doorbell, and assumes that there is somebody at the door. She remembers it is [[Halloween]]: she enjoyed receiving treats as a child, and now, as an adult, she enjoys giving them.

While evolutionary psychology has focused on how behavior may result from species-typical psychological programs which led to greater fitness in ancestral environments, this work has been criticized for neglecting how behavior may be shaped by culturally transmitted information. In contrast to genetic programs, cultural evolution investigates how culture itself may evolve (Mesoudi, 2009<ref name=\"Mesoudi 2009\">{{cite journal|last1=Mesoudi|first1=A.|title=How cultural evolutionary theory can inform social psychology and vice versa|journal=Psychological Review|date=2009|volume=116|issue=4|pages=929\u2013952|doi=10.1037/a0017062|pmid=19839691}}</ref>). Gene-culture coevolution studies how culture and genetic evolution influence each other, ultimately shaping behavior, as well. Cultural evolution and evolutionary psychology may not be as disparate as one may think, though. Rather than a passive receptacle of cultural material, Boyd and Richerson (1985, 2005)<ref name=\"Boyd Richerson 1985\"/><ref name=\"Boyd Richerson 2005\"/> suggest that our minds consist of psychological mechanisms which direct our attention to and imitate cultural traits depending on the frequency of that trait, the content of it, who carries it, etc. In this way, cultural evolution may be viewed as a particular kind of \u201cscaling up\u201d from the individual-level processes to population-level ones. In neither account of culture is the mind a blank slate or empty bin for cultural material (Tooby and Cosmides, 1992<ref name = \"Tooby Cosmides 1992\">{{cite book|author1=Tooby, J.|author2=Cosmides, L.|authorlink1=The Psychological Foundations of Culture|editor1-last=Barkow|editor1-first=J.H.|editor2-last=Tooby|editor2-first=J.|editor3-last=Cosmides|editor3-first=L.|title=The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture|date=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195101072|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/adaptedmindevolu0000unse}}</ref>). Some evolutionary psychologists have suggested that culturally-transmitted culture may pass through a number of lenses and filters shaped by natural selection to catch fitness-relevant information and behaviors; these filters may change due to local environmental conditions, sex, and other factors (Gangestad et al., 2006<ref name = \"Gangestad 2006\">{{cite journal|last1=Gangestad|first1=S.W.|last2=Haselton|first2=M.G.|last3=Buss|first3=D.M.|title=Authors' Response: Toward an Integrative Understanding of Evoked and Transmitted Culture: The Importance of Specialized Psychological Design|journal=Psychological Inquiry|date=2006|volume=17|issue=2|pages=138\u2013151|doi=10.1207/s15327965pli1702_3}}</ref>).

Transmitted cultural behaviors are those behaviors which are learned from one\u2019s social group, regardless of environment. As such, investigating evoked culture may well rest in the domain of evolutionary psychology and transmitted culture studied by culture evolution, social psychology, and other disciplines. Differentiating between the two is more difficult than it may appear, however. For example, given the level of cross-cultural variation in human societies, variation between any two cultures may result from separate histories and cultural evolutionary pathways or different evoked cultures, based on different local environmental cues, while uniformity across cultures could result from convergent cultural evolution or similarly functioning psychological adaptations (Fessler et al., 2015<ref name=\"Fessler 2015\"/>). Specifically, if two cultures exhibit similar behaviors to avoid pathogens, can one differentiate between either the two groups independently inventing similar behaviors or the groups displaying the same underlying psychological adaptation for pathogen avoidance? As well, the issue of behavioral variation and transmitted culture may be seen as a major point of contention between evolutionary psychology and other disciplines, especially gene-culture coevolution. Evolutionary psychology and human behavioral ecology both admit to cultural transmission as a source of behavioral variation but do not see it as an evolutionary process or its potential to have significantly affected human evolution. Gene-culture coevolution would argue that culture traits may have altered genetic change and selection pressures, ultimately affecting cognition. However, as Brown et al.

In order to do so, the authors suggest that a more comprehensive definition of culture needs to be developed since different cultural phenomena need different kinds of analysis to investigate their effects. As they state, \u201cCulture, however, is not a \"thing\" with singularity; it's an umbrella concept subsuming a collection of extraordinarily varied phenomena, each of which requires scientific analysis\u201d (Gangestad et al., 2006).<ref name = \"Gangestad 2006\"/> Ultimately, the issues of behavioral variation through evoked or transmitted culture must rest on empirical evidence.\n\n===Psychology, culture, and human evolution===\nWhile most researchers would accept the notion that psychological adaptations, shaped by natural selection, underlie culture, some would stress the strength of cultural behaviors on shaping selection pressures (Boyd and Richerson, 2005)<ref name=\"Boyd Richerson 2005\"/> or emphasize cultural niche construction (Laland et al., 2000).<ref name = \"Laland 2000\">{{cite journal|last1=Laland|first1=K.N.|last2=Odling-Smee|first2=J.|last3=Feldman|first3=M.W.|title=Niche Construction, Biological Evolution, and Cultural Change|journal=The Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=2000|volume=23|pages=131\u2013146|doi=10.1017/s0140525x00002417|pmid=11303338}}</ref> Still others have argued for a kind of cognitive niche construction, where culture changes the selection pressures on cognition, resulting in emergent psychological modules (e.g. Wheeler and Clark, 2008<ref name = \"Wheeler Clark 2008\">{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=M.|last2=Clark|first2=A.|title=Culture, embodiment and genes: unravelling the triple helix|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Series B|date=2008|volume=363|issue=1509|pages=3563\u20133575|doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0135|pmid=18801719|pmc=2607343}}</ref>).

Their argument relies on cognitive [[niche construction]], where culturally-learned behaviors create a space for new feedback cycles. By shaping the physical space around oneself, for example, the culturally-transmitted practice transform problem solving for new forms of thought.

The so-called regality theory describes how human psychological traits are responding to either a hostile or a peaceful environment. Humans show [[Authoritarian personality|authoritarian]] reactions and preferences for a strong leader in case of war or perceived collective danger. The evolutionary function of this so-called regal reaction is that it allows a strong leader to solve the [[collective action problem]] in war and suppress [[free riding]]. The whole society and culture is shaped by the regal psychological reactions of its members. A regal society is characterized by an authoritarian and [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] organization, strict [[discipline]], [[Toleration|intolerance]], and [[xenophobia]].\n\nThe opposite of the regal reaction is called kungic. The kungic reaction is seen when a group of people are living in [[peace]] and [[security]]. People will not tolerate a [[tyrant|tyrannical]] leader who can exploit all [[resources]] to enrich himself. Instead, people will prefer an [[egalitarian]] and tolerant society when they live in an environment of collective safety.<ref name=Fog2017>{{cite book |last1=Fog |first1=Agner |date=2017 |title=Warlike and Peaceful Societies: The Interaction of Genes and Culture |publisher=Open Book Publishers |doi=10.11647/OBP.0128 |isbn=978-1-78374-403-9 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Evolutionary psychology]]\n*[[Dual inheritance theory]]\n*[[Theory of Regal and Kungic Societal Structures]]\n*[[Culture]]\n*[[Anthropology]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Evolutionary psychology}}\n{{Culture}}\n\n[[Category:Evolutionary psychology]]\n", "text_old": "'''[[Evolutionary psychology]]''' has traditionally focused on individual-level behaviors, determined by species-typical psychological adaptations.

As opposed to a domain-general cultural acquisition program, where an individual passively receives culturally-transmitted material from the group, Tooby and Cosmides (1989), among others, argue that: \"the psyche evolved to generate adaptive rather than repetitive behavior, and hence critically analyzes the behavior of those surrounding it in highly structured and patterned ways, to be used as a rich (but by no means the only) source of information out of which to construct a 'private culture' or individually tailored [[adaptive system]]; in consequence, this system may or may not mirror the behavior of others in any given respect.\" (Tooby and Cosmides 1989).<ref name=\"Tooby Cosmides 1989\"/>\n\n==Epidemiological culture==\nThe [[Epidemiology of representations]], or cultural epidemiology, is a broad framework for understanding cultural phenomena by investigating the distribution of mental representations in and through populations.<ref name=\"Sperber 2001\">{{cite journal|last1=Sperber|first1=D.|title=Conceptual tools for a natural science of society and culture (Radcliffe-Brown Lecture in Social Anthropology 1999)|journal=Proceedings of the British Academy|date=2001|volume=111|pages=297\u2013317}}</ref> The theory of cultural epidemiology was largely developed by [[Dan Sperber]] to study society and cultures. The theory has implications for [[psychology]] and [[anthropology]].\nMental representations are transferred from person to person through cognitive causal chains. Sperber (2001) identified three different, yet interrelated, cognitive causal chains, outlined in Table 1. A cognitive causal chain (CCC) links a perception to an evolved, domain-specific response or process. For example:\n:On October 31, at 7:30 p.m., Mrs. Jones\u2019s doorbell rings. Mrs. Jones hears the doorbell, and assumes that there is somebody at the door. She remembers it is [[Halloween]]: she enjoyed receiving treats as a child, and now, as an adult, she enjoys giving them.

Mrs. Jones decides to open the door, and does so.<ref name=\"Sperber 2001\" />\nSocial Cognitive Causal Chains (SCCC) are inter-individual CCCs. Here, a CCC is used as an act of communication between people (i.e. the mental representation is shared between multiple people).

While evolutionary psychology has focused on how behavior may result from species-typical psychological programs which led to greater fitness in ancestral environments, this work has been criticized for neglecting how behavior may be shaped by culturally transmitted information. In contrast to genetic programs, cultural evolution investigates how culture itself may evolve (Mesoudi, 2009<ref name=\"Mesoudi 2009\">{{cite journal|last1=Mesoudi|first1=A.|title=How cultural evolutionary theory can inform social psychology and vice versa|journal=Psychological Review|date=2009|volume=116|issue=4|pages=929\u2013952|doi=10.1037/a0017062|pmid=19839691}}</ref>). Gene-culture coevolution studies how culture and genetic evolution influence each other, ultimately shaping behavior, as well. Cultural evolution and evolutionary psychology may not be as disparate as one may think, though. Rather than a passive receptacle of cultural material, Boyd and Richerson (1985, 2005)<ref name=\"Boyd Richerson 1985\"/><ref name=\"Boyd Richerson 2005\"/> suggest that our minds consist of psychological mechanisms which direct our attention to and imitate cultural traits depending on the frequency of that trait, the content of it, who carries it, etc. In this way, cultural evolution may be viewed as a particular kind of \u201cscaling up\u201d from the individual-level processes to population-level ones. In neither account of culture is the mind a blank slate or empty bin for cultural material (Tooby and Cosmides, 1992<ref name = \"Tooby Cosmides 1992\">{{cite book|author1=Tooby, J.|author2=Cosmides, L.|authorlink1=The Psychological Foundations of Culture|editor1-last=Barkow|editor1-first=J.H.|editor2-last=Tooby|editor2-first=J.|editor3-last=Cosmides|editor3-first=L.|title=The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture|date=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195101072|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/adaptedmindevolu0000unse}}</ref>). Some evolutionary psychologists have suggested that culturally-transmitted culture may pass through a number of lenses and filters shaped by natural selection to catch fitness-relevant information and behaviors; these filters may change due to local environmental conditions, sex, and other factors (Gangestad et al., 2006<ref name = \"Gangestad 2006\">{{cite journal|last1=Gangestad|first1=S.W.|last2=Haselton|first2=M.G.|last3=Buss|first3=D.M.|title=Authors' Response: Toward an Integrative Understanding of Evoked and Transmitted Culture: The Importance of Specialized Psychological Design|journal=Psychological Inquiry|date=2006|volume=17|issue=2|pages=138\u2013151|doi=10.1207/s15327965pli1702_3}}</ref>).

As they state, \u201cCulture, however, is not a \"thing\" with singularity; it's an umbrella concept subsuming a collection of extraordinarily varied phenomena, each of which requires scientific analysis\u201d (Gangestad et al., 2006).<ref name = \"Gangestad 2006\"/> Ultimately, the issues of behavioral variation through evoked or transmitted culture must rest on empirical evidence.\n\n===Psychology, culture, and human evolution===\nWhile most researchers would accept the notion that psychological adaptations, shaped by natural selection, underlie culture, some would stress the strength of cultural behaviors on shaping selection pressures (Boyd and Richerson, 2005)<ref name=\"Boyd Richerson 2005\"/> or emphasize cultural niche construction (Laland et al., 2000).<ref name = \"Laland 2000\">{{cite journal|last1=Laland|first1=K.N.|last2=Odling-Smee|first2=J.|last3=Feldman|first3=M.W.|title=Niche Construction, Biological Evolution, and Cultural Change|journal=The Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=2000|volume=23|pages=131\u2013146|doi=10.1017/s0140525x00002417|pmid=11303338}}</ref> Still others have argued for a kind of cognitive niche construction, where culture changes the selection pressures on cognition, resulting in emergent psychological modules (e.g. Wheeler and Clark, 2008<ref name = \"Wheeler Clark 2008\">{{cite journal|last1=Wheeler|first1=M.|last2=Clark|first2=A.|title=2008|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Series B|date=2008|volume=363|issue=1509|pages=3563\u20133575|doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0135|pmid=18801719|pmc=2607343}}</ref>). Wheeler and Clark (2008) have named this interplay between genes, culture, and embodiment the \u201ctriple helix.\u201d The authors suggest that self-created environmental structures and reliance on culturally-transmitted information selected for cognitive modules for continual bootstrapping and increases in computational complexity. Their argument relies on cognitive [[niche construction]], where culturally-learned behaviors create a space for new feedback cycles. By shaping the physical space around oneself, for example, the culturally-transmitted practice transform problem solving for new forms of thought. The feedback cycle, as they and others argue, will alter selection pressures for cognitive developmental programs which bolster these abilities.<ref name = \"Wheeler Clark 2008\"/><ref name=\"Sterelny 2003\">{{cite book|last1=Sterelny|first1=K.|title=Thought in a hostile world: the evolution of human cognition|date=2003|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-0631188872}}</ref> As they state, \u201cTriple helix models of mind recognize the role of genetic biases in sculpting key developmental trajectories, and the resulting space both for strong forms of genetically specified cognitive modularity and for weaker forms of emergent modularity resulting from trajectories marked by multiple bouts of culturally scaffolded experience and the self- selection of environments\u201d (Wheeler and Clark, 2008.<ref name = \"Wheeler Clark 2008\"/> Other authors have suggested that borrowing methods of dynamical systems analysis may help unravel this tangled web of genes, cognition, and culture (Kenrick et al., 2003<ref name = \"Kenrick 2003\">{{cite journal|last1=Kenrick|first1=D.T.|last2=Li|first2=N.P.|last3=Butner|first3=J.|title=Dynamical Evolutionary Psychology: Individual Decision Rules and Emergent Social Norms|journal=Psychological Review|date=2003|volume=110|issue=1|pages=3\u201328|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.110.1.3|pmid=12529056}}</ref>). The answers to these type of questions have impacts on anthropology, social psychology, and other behavioral sciences (Mesoudi, 2009<ref name=\"Mesoudi 2009\"/>).\n\n=== Evolved responses to intergroup conflict ===\n{{main|Theory of Regal and Kungic Societal Structures}}\nWar and intergroup conflict is a strong evolutionary factor. The so-called regality theory describes how human psychological traits are responding to either a hostile or a peaceful environment. Humans show [[Authoritarian personality|authoritarian]] reactions and preferences for a strong leader in case of war or perceived collective danger. The evolutionary function of this so-called regal reaction is that it allows a strong leader to solve the [[collective action problem]] in war and suppress [[free riding]]. The whole society and culture is shaped by the regal psychological reactions of its members. A regal society is characterized by an authoritarian and [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] organization, strict [[discipline]], [[Toleration|intolerance]], and [[xenophobia]].\n\nThe opposite of the regal reaction is called kungic. The kungic reaction is seen when a group of people are living in [[peace]] and [[security]]. People will not tolerate a [[tyrant|tyrannical]] leader who can exploit all [[resources]] to enrich himself. Instead, people will prefer an [[egalitarian]] and tolerant society when they live in an environment of collective safety.<ref name=Fog2017>{{cite book |last1=Fog |first1=Agner |date=2017 |title=Warlike and Peaceful Societies: The Interaction of Genes and Culture |publisher=Open Book Publishers |doi=10.11647/OBP.0128 |isbn=978-1-78374-403-9 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Evolutionary psychology]]\n*[[Dual inheritance theory]]\n*[[Theory of Regal and Kungic Societal Structures]]\n*[[Culture]]\n*[[Anthropology]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Evolutionary psychology}}\n{{Culture}}\n\n[[Category:Evolutionary psychology]]\n", "name_user": "Lcscnc", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePsychology, culture, and human evolution:fixed ref title", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology_and_culture"}
