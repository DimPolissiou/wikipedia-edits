According to [[Claudio Moreschini]], \"The interpretation is primarily allegorical, with a marked interest in arithmology.\"<ref>Moreschini, Claudio and Norelli, Enrico.

And he saw that the theme of the soon coming [[Second Coming|Second Advent]] was a continuous thread of thought throughout the Apocalypse.{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=338}}\n\nHe wrote of the seven churches as representing seven classes of Christians within the church. The seven seals are explained as constituting a prophetic fore view of the spread of the gospel throughout the world. In connection with the Second Advent and the end of the world he looked for wars, famines, pestilences and persecution of the church.\n\nThe crowned rider of the ''four horsemen'' seated upon the white horse, going forth \"conquering, and to conquer,\" is interpreted as prophetic of Christ's church going forth on its victorious mission, the triumph of Christianity over paganism. The red horse is explained as \"coming wars,\" predicted as salient events preceding the end. The black horse, Victorinus avers, signifies \"famines\" in the time of the Antichrist. The pale horse meant \"coming destructions.\"{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=339}}\n\nThe angel with the seal in chapter 7 symbolizes [[Elijah|Elias the prophet]] as the \"precursor of the times of [[Antichrist]].\" Then comes the kingdom of Antichrist and finally the angel reapers smite the kingdom of Antichrist delivering the saints.{{sfn|Froom|1950|p=340}}\n\nThe great red dragon with seven heads of chapter 12 he sees as Rome, from which springs Antichrist in the last times, amid the ten horns.

The leopard beast of Revelation 14 signifies the kingdom of the time of Antichrist. Victorinus considers the 666 of verse 18 as the computation of letters, each of which comprise the equivalent number, of an assortment of possible names.\n\nAfter the seven plagues of the last days in Revelation 15, [[Babylon (New Testament)|Babylon]], in Revelation 17, is identified as Rome seated upon her \"seven hills,\" drunk with the blood of martyrs.

His powers were initially weak, so he spent some time stealing electrical equipment from [[Stark Industries]] to charge himself. During this time, he was approached by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], who considered him a potential recruit for his [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], claiming that Dillon's power rivaled his own, but Dillon refused. The following day, Dillon was confronted by a small-time thug from whom he had been borrowing money to pay for the machinery he had needed. When the thug drew a gun on him because he had not paid back the money yet, he responded by shooting a blast of lightning through the thug's chest\u2014the first time Dillon ever killed anybody.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' vol. 2, #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Soon taking the name \"Electro\", he turned to a life of a professional criminal, his first victim being [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. Electro broke into the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' Building and stole from Jameson's safe right in front of him. Jameson accused Spider-Man of being an alternate identity of Electro, prompting Spider-Man to prove the publisher wrong. During their first ever confrontation, Spider-Man was nearly killed after touching the electrically charged villain. Spider-Man eventually used a [[fire hose]] to short-circuit Electro while wearing rubber gloves to protect himself.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #9 (Feb. 1964). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nElectro next confronted [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] for the first time when trying to break into the [[Baxter Building]]. He was again defeated.<ref>''Daredevil'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Electro later joined the original [[Sinister Six]] led by [[Doctor Octopus]], and was the first member of the group to fight Spider-Man, battling him at a Stark plant, when Spider-Man dodged a bolt of electricity he realized his powers had returned. Electro lost his power when the power was cut off by Spider-Man. Spider-Man got a card from him that led him to fight [[Kraven the Hunter]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Electro attacked the [[Fantastic Four]] at the wedding of [[Invisible Woman|Sue Storm]] and Reed Richards, under the control of [[Doctor Doom]]'s mind-control machine, but due to [[Mister Fantastic]] he, like the other villains, has no memory of the incident.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later recruited the second [[Emissaries of Evil]] in a plot of revenge against Daredevil for previous defeats. This group consisted of [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]], [[Stilt-Man]], [[Leap-Frog (comics)|Leap-Frog]], and the [[Matador (Marvel Comics)|Matador]].<ref>''Daredevil Annual'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nElectro was later hired by J. Jonah Jameson to defeat Spider-Man on national television.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #82. Marvel Comics.</ref> He encountered Daredevil again in San Francisco, at which time he temporarily donned a modified costume.<ref>''Daredevil'' #87. Marvel Comics.</ref> He then took control of a Protarian android seeking the destruction of [[Omega the Unknown|Omega]].<ref>''Omega the Unknown'' #3.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nElectro later joined the [[Frightful Four]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #39. Marvel Comics.</ref> As part of the Frightful Four, he used Spider-Man as bait to trap the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #218. Marvel Comics.</ref> Subsequently, he battled the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] but was defeated, partly because he did not consider the Falcon to be a serious threat.<ref>''Falcon'' #3\u20134.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Instead, he later accepted Doctor Octopus' invitation to rejoin the Sinister Six, and battled Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #334\u2013339. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nElectro has fought Spider-Man countless times, either on his own or as part of a group such as the [[Sinister Six]]. He has also fought such other heroes as Daredevil, the Fantastic Four, and the [[New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]. Despite his immense power, he has almost always been defeated, usually as a result of his foes outsmarting him or taking advantage of his weakness to water while charged.\n\nAs a result of his frequent and often embarrassing defeats, Electro tried to take over [[New York City]]'s power supply in an attempt at glory and respect. Spider-Man thwarted this plan, however, and convinced Electro to quit his criminal career. When [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] (Spider-Man's insane clone) started killing enemies of Spider-Man, Electro began to fear for his life and temporarily joined [[Mysterio]]'s Sinister Seven, which had been formed to combat Kaine. This group was quickly disbanded, and following Kaine's subsequent disappearance, Electro returned to retirement.\n\nThis changed when the [[Richard Fisk|Rose]] agreed to fund an experimental technique that would amplify Electro's abilities, in exchange for Electro's services as an enforcer. Seeing this as a chance to rise above the string of failures that had made up so much of his life, Electro underwent the procedure. After paying off his debt to the Rose by defeating several members of The True Believers (an offshoot of the famous ninja sect called the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]]), a group of ninja assassins who had been interfering in the Rose's operations, Electro attempted to demonstrate his newly amplified powers to the world, once again attempting to take control of New York City's power supply. Wearing an insulated suit, Spider-Man stopped him. Electro, in an effort to make a final grand gesture, threw himself into the [[Hudson River]] while his body was highly charged, seemingly killing himself in an explosion.\n\nSomehow surviving, Electro resurfaced later as part of the re-formed Sinister Six, formed to kill [[Senator Ward (comics)|Senator Stewart Ward]] and Doctor Octopus (whom the other members of the Six now hated due to his arrogance). His powers had seemingly reverted to their pre-amplification level, and he wore a new blue-and-white costume. When [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] betrayed his fellow Sinister Six members, attempting to kill them one by one, he attacked Electro and left him for dead. Once again, Electro survived, and when he next appeared had returned to his yellow-and green-costume.\n\nElectro was working with the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]]<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> when they were attacked by Spider-Man who thought they had kidnapped his [[Aunt May]].{{issue|date=January 2014}} Electro managed to bring Spider-Man to the edge of defeat, using his powers in more intelligent ways and blowing up a large number of cars, including some with children in them. After a devastating battle, Spider-Man defeated him by fighting him to a gas refinery. The badly wounded Electro recovered fairly quickly, and shortly afterwards joined the [[Sinister Six#Sinister Twelve|Sinister Twelve]], assembled by the [[Green Goblin]], though he and the rest of the team was defeated thanks to the intervention of the [[Fantastic Four]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man]] and [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]].{{Issue|date=September 2010}}\n\n[[File:Electro (Max Dillon) (The Amazing Spider-Man).jpg|145px|Electro's new look in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nLater, Electro joined Chameleon's \"Exterminators\",<ref name=\"marvunapp1\" /> seeking to take advantage of Peter Parker and his loved ones.\n\nDuring the \"[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\" storyline, Electro was among the villains in [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]]'s unnamed villain army when [[Iron Man]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] raided the hideout.<ref>''Civil War: War Crimes'' (February 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn \"[[Secret Invasion]],\" Electro appears as member of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s crime syndicate and attacked a [[Skrull]] force. After the Skrull posing as [[Edwin Jarvis]] kidnaps the baby of Luke Cage and [[Jessica Jones]], the Avengers and the Fantastic Four begin going after everyone who is associated with the Skrulls. Because of this, Electro is confronted by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in an alley where, after a battle, he leaves Dillon beaten and unconscious.<ref>''New Avengers'' #48. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nElectro returns in ''[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|The Gauntlet]]'', with a new look as his face is now scarred with lightning bolts. The revamp was explained by writer Mark Waid, stating that artist Paul Azaceta \"tweaked the design a bit, adding some burn scars to reflect Electro's current situation. As Electro gets older, as his body chemistry starts to shift into middle age, his powers are becoming more erratic and less easy for him to control. So he turns to a surprise Marvel villain \u2013 someone rarely, if ever, seen in the pages of ''Amazing'' \u2013 to level up.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/102/1026877p3.html|title=IGN.com \"Spider-Man: Enter the Gauntlet\"}}</ref> During his appearance in \"The Guantlet\", it is revealed that Electro has lost control over his powers: besides the physical disfigurement, his touch is now 100% lethal. Depressed and angry at the world because of this, Electro begins gathering other outcasts and misfits into a group known as \"Power To The People\", which targets right-wing newspaper baron [[Dexter Bennett]] and the New York Stock Exchange in the wake of the 2008 Financial Crisis. Electro's group manages to gain positive coverage in the media, hampering Spider-Man's ability to convince Electro's followers of his true evil nature.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #612. Marvel Comics.</ref> Electro's duplicitous nature causes him to betray his followers in order to align with the amoral Bennett in exchange for help finding a way to restore his powers to a controllable level. The [[Mad Thinker]] is able to come up with a process to cure Electro, but Spider-Man interferes with the process, turning Electro into an artificial electrical thunderbolt. Furious, Electro double-crosses Bennett and ultimately uses his new powers to destroy The [[Daily Bugle|DB]] building, crippling Bennett in the process. In doing so, Electro uses up so much of his newfound power that Spider-Man is able to neutralize him with his webbing.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #613\u2013614.

Marvel Comics.</ref> When Young Allies members [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]] and [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]] fight Electro, he defeats them and lets them live so that they can spread the message that he does not endorse Aftershock and the Bastards of Evil's terrorism. He also says they can look up how and when he got his powers on the internet and there was no way a girl of Aftershock's age could have been conceived after he got his powers: It's impossible for him to be Aftershock's father.<ref>''Young Allies'' vol. 2, #2.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Electro goes after Spider-Man for [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]]'s infant. Anticipating Spider-Man's plan to deliver the infant to a hospital, Electro waits at the nearest hospital in Spider-Man's area until Spider-Man shows up.

During a conflict between the Intelligencia and the Sinister Six, Mad Thinker was able to briefly deactivate Electro's powers, but was caught off-guard when Electro physically attacked him instead, the surprise of the attack allowed Electro to defeat Mad Thinker.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #676. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the \"'[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]\" storyline despite the Sinister Six being prepared for a fight with the Avengers, Electro was the first of the team to be defeated, being hurled into the upper atmosphere by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] while distracted by his inability to attack Spider-Man's new hi-tech armor.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #683.

The villains start joking about the gloomy Electro. One mentions how Thor launched him into space, another about how \"Spider-Man\" made him part of the Superior Six, and yet another about how Electro was taken out by the Punisher, despite the latter's lack of powers. Electro gets angry and starts sparking, but the bartender gets the situation under control by commenting on how bad the Punisher is and with compliments like breaking so many villains out of the Raft, which earned him the respect of [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] and [[Count Nefaria]]. This does not stop the others, however. Determined to get respect, Electro heads back over to the Raft, ready for another breakout despite the Green Goblin having done the same just recently and the fact that it was re-christened as Spider-Island II. Electro sends a blot of electricity around, but it grows excessively big and he cannot turn it off. He finally exhausts all of his power but when this happens, he passes out and many of the villains he tried to break out are now dead.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAn unusually configured magnetic field was created when Max Dillon was struck by lightning while holding live, high-tension wires and a wound reel of one-inch cable, granting him superhuman powers. Electro can generate massive quantities of [[electricity]], theoretically up to approximately one million [[volt]]s. He can employ this electrostatic energy as lightning arcs from his fingertips, and his maximum charge is more than enough to kill a normal human.\n\nWhen his body is charged to high levels, he becomes superhumanly strong and fast. He can also glide over power lines by using the electricity contained therein for propulsion, and he has on occasion been shown to actually ride on lightning bolts. During a stint in prison, [[Doctor Octopus]] gave him the ideas of ionizing metals and sparking the petroleum in the fuel tanks of vehicles as a way to generate explosions. He can charge himself up to make himself more powerful. He can also absorb the energy of electrical equipment such as a power plant to increase his powers further.\n\nIn ''New Avengers'', he was shown to fly and manipulate large amounts of electricity and machinery, when he freed all the prisoners at Ryker's Island.{{issue|date=December 2014}}\n\nAn experimental procedure heightened his powers, allowing Electro to store and absorb a seemingly limitless amount of electricity. He also seemed to gain the power over magnetism to a certain degree, allowing him to manipulate magnetic fields and move objects in a manner similar to that of [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], and could overcome his old weakness to water by using the electromagnetic fields around him to vaporize water before it could touch him. He made Spider-Man beg by stimulating the bioelectric currents in his brain, and was able to defeat [[Nate Grey]] by manipulating said currents in Nate's brain to turn his own psionic powers against him.\n\nElectro can override any electrically powered device and manipulate it according to his mental commands.\n\nBy using an external electrical power source to recharge his body's energy reserves, Electro could expend electricity indefinitely without diminishing his personal reserves. When he is fully charged, Electro is extremely sensitive to anything that may \"short circuit\" him, such as water.\n\nElectro propels himself along magnetic lines of force in objects that have great electrical potential, such as high-tension electrical lines. He can also create electrostatic bridges to traverse upon, at the cost of a great expenditure of energy.\n\nDuring the events of the storyline \"The Gauntlet\", Electro became a living artificial thunderbolt, allowing him to travel through electrical appliances such as going through a light bulb and exiting through any other electronic device connected to the power source.{{Issue|date=November 2010}} He was also able to transmit himself over Spider-Man's web line.{{Issue|date=November 2010}}\n\n==Other versions==\n===House of M===\nIn the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, Electro is one of Rhino's friends (along with [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] and [[Ox (comics)|Ox]]) who helped him attack and detain the Green Goblin for ruining the best chance at a good life Rhino ever had.<ref>''Spider-Man: House of M'' #3.

Although Max survived, his body became an unstable living electrical capacitate. He is then forced to wear an insulated body suit to contain the bio-electricity being produced in order to protect others around him, especially his face which had transformed into an electrical field. After an encounter with Spider-Man, Max goes berserk and takes up the name 'Electro' . Electro then rushes out to Doctor Connors's lab, demanding that Connors cure him. He is interrupted by Spider-Man again and the two battle.

Spider-Man acknowledges that while having once considered Electro a serious villain, training with S.H.I.E.L.D. makes the villain incompetent. In his self-titled episode \"Electro\", he is tasered by Spider-Man against [[J. Jonah Jameson]]'s large television screen, but Electro manages to disappear into the screen. Electro then appears in a hyper-electrified form (a homage to the Ultimate Marvel version of Electro) and holds the city's electricity for ransom. Electro takes over Spider-Man's Spider-Cycle which takes the web-slinger's team straight into town. Spider-Man manages to anticipate where Electro is as Electro charges the tram Spider-Man's team is on towards its station. Spider-Man's team finds Electro in a part of town where he starts to turn some of the nearby electronic devices into weapons. Electro then attacks Spider-Man as he remembers that the large television screen had super-charged him. Electro then heads to the Federal Reserve as Spider-Man and [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Nova]] follow him. Electro then takes over Spider-Man's electrical web containers and fires at a building crane as a diversion so that he can get into the Federal Reserve. Spider-Man's team catches up to Electro in the vault as Spider-Man tells the S.H.I.E.L.D. trainees that they must act like a team to take down Electro. Spider-Man comes up with a plan that involves Electro heading to the satellite above the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' which launched him into the orbiting satellites. After [[Batroc the Leaper]]'s defeat, Spider-Man swings towards the large television screen that Electro is in. As Electro emerges from the screen, Spider-Man's team takes out the Electro clones that emerge from their electronics. Electro loses control and emerges from the screen in his normal form confused from being overloaded with information. Spider-Man then knocks out Electro. Electro returns in hyper-electrified form for subsequent episodes. In the episode \"The Sinister Six\", Electro appears as a member of the [[Sinister Six]] alongside [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Kraven the Hunter]], [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]] and [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]. During the fight at the Statue of Liberty between the S.H.I.E.L.D. trainees and the Sinister Six, Electro fights [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] but was defeated by Nova when Spider-Man's teammates switched opponents. When most of the Sinister Six members were apprehended by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], Electro anchored down in his cell in which he is standing surrounded by water. In the episode \"Return of the Sinister Six\", Electro is sprung from Ryker's Island and equipped with stolen OsCorp tech with the armored Sinister Six. Electro fights Spider-Man then Nova and assists the group's gang assault on [[Norman Osborn|Iron Patriot]] but is eventually defeated by Spider-Man. In the four-part \"Spider-Verse\" story arc, Electro gets trapped within the enchanted [[Siege Perilous]] ruby gem by Green Goblin to collect the DNA of [[Spider-Man 2099]], [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]], [[Spider-Man Noir]], [[Spider-Ham]], Spyder-Knight and [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]. At the end of the adventure, Spider-Man uses Electro to bring the Web-Warriors to help defeat Spider-Goblin. Electro then takes control of the fallen [[Helicarrier]] which he transforms into a giant robot, going on a rampage until he is stopped by the Web-Warriors. In the episode \"The New Sinister 6\" Pt. 2, Electro appears as a member of the Sinister Six at the time when they attack the Triskelion. During the battle between the heroes and the Sinister Six, Electro is defeated by [[Squirrel Girl]].\n* A female version of Electro appears in ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Daisy Lightfoot]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Bring On the Bad Guys Pt. 4|series=Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=36|airdate=August 6, 2018}}</ref> This version is an unnamed female African-American teenager who uses an exoskeleton to acquire electrical powers. In the episode \"Bring on the Bad Guys\" Pt. 4, Electro is the final villain attempting to collect the bounty placed on Spider-Man and ambushes him on his way to Horizon High's Open House while constantly having to recharge her exoskeleton. After using a Power Amplifier made by Peter Parker, Electro transforms into a being of electrical energy (a homage to the Ultimate Marvel version of Electro). She caused significant damage to Horizon High's Open House until Spider-Man (using a hand-made electoproof suit and energy-absorbing gauntlets from components from the other projects) defeats her, returning Electro to normal. Spider-Man then webs her up for the police and gives the absorbed electricity to Max Modell, who cancelled the Open House due to damages caused by Electro. She returns in the episode \"The Living Brain\", where Electro fights Spider-Man and Police Chief [[Wraith (comics)|Yuri Watanabe]] alongside the [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]] inside of the Supervillain Holding Facility. Both of them are ultimately defeated and returned to their cells. In the episode \"Brand New Day\", Electro is transferred to The Cellar and is one of the villains suspected by Spider-Man to have been involved in the capture of the Avengers, though it turns out Regent was replicating her powers. In the episode \"Goblin War: Part 3\", Electro is shown to have become leader of a faction of the Goblin Nation known as the Electro Goblins. During a scuffle with the War Goblins, Electro is weakened by a device that [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] commissioned \"some eggheads\" to build for him.\n\n===Film===\n[[File:Jamie Foxx as Electro.jpg|thumb|upright|Jamie Foxx as Electro in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]''.]]\n[[Jamie Foxx]] portrays Maxwell \"Max\" Dillon / Electro in the 2014 film ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.movies.yahoo.com/electro-confirmed-amazing-spider-man-2-main-villain-192400411.html?cat=857 |title=Electro confirmed as The Amazing Spider-Man 2's main villain |publisher=YahooMail |date=November 22, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203235210/http://uk.movies.yahoo.com/electro-confirmed-amazing-spider-man-2-main-villain-192400411.html?cat=857 |archivedate=December 3, 2013 }}</ref> Foxx revealed that the character was redesigned to be more grounded, and that the villain's classic yellow and green suit would be omitted in favor of a modern look.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/the-amazing-spider-man-2-electro-costume-is-getting-a-modern-redesign |title=The Amazing Spider-Man 2 Electro Costume Is Getting a Modern Redesign |publisher=Movieweb.com|date=December 17, 2012}}</ref> This incarnation of the character is [[African-American]], as opposed to being Caucasian in the comics.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/257398271.html | title=The electric Jamie Foxx puts a charge into 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' | work=[[Star Tribune]] | accessdate=February 21, 2017 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508061637/http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/257398271.html | archivedate=May 8, 2014 | url-status=unfit}}</ref> In the film, Max Dillon is an [[electrical engineer]] at [[Oscorp]] and a \"nobody\" who idolizes Spider-Man after being saved by him in a battle against [[Rhino (comics)|Aleksei Sytsevich]] before getting transformed in an accident while fixing a power line, electrocuting him and causing him to fall into a tank full of genetically-engineered electric eels. He realizes that his newly gained powers make the world finally recognize him, having been shunned, humiliated and ignored his entire life. Having become mentally unstable, he is confronted by Spider-Man in Times Square, where he mistakenly believes Spider-Man is attempting to steal his newfound fame and betray him. After a brief battle, Dillon is subdued and held captive in Ravencroft to be studied where he adopts the name \"Electro\", but is later broken out by [[Harry Osborn]] who requires his help to break back into Oscorp to find a cure for his own terminal illness. Electro agrees and is given a new suit to control his powers. After they successfully break into Oscorp, Harry allows Electro to take over the electrical grid he designed, manipulating it to control the electricity in New York so that the citizens will be at his mercy. After having magnetized his web-shooters to prevent them from being damaged by Electro's powers, Spider-Man once again confronts Dillon, and during their battle is able to reconnect the damaged electrical grid, allowing [[Gwen Stacy]] to reactivate it. This allows Spider-Man to [[overcurrent|overload Electro with his own electricity]], causing his body to explode.\n\n===Video games===\n* Electro is a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] in the [[arcade game]] ''[[Spider-Man: The Video Game]]''; in the [[Game Boy Advance]] game ''[[Spider-Man: Mysterio's Menace]]''; and in the home games ''[[Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six]]''; ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin]]'', at a level set in a power station.\n* Electro appears in the game ''[[Spider-Man and Captain America in Doctor Doom's Revenge]]''.<ref>[https://archive.today/20110713045341/http://www.internapse.com/marvel/merchandise/videogames/classic/spiderman1989/ Marvel Gateway by Internapse]</ref>\n* Electro appears in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 3: Invasion of the Spider-Slayers]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n* Electro appears in the ''[[Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro]]'' [[video game]], voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} His goal is to use the \"Bio-Nexus Device\", a mechanism that can enhance a person's [[Bioelectricity|bioelectric field]], to become a god.

Spider-Man gives chase and eventually defeats Electro, but [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] shoots him to stop him for good. However, as Spider-Man confronts Black Widow about this, Electro's infected sister rushes over to him and accidentally infects Electro with her symbiote, which heals him and transforms him into a feral monster obsessed with absorbing electricity. He gains the power to create his own pods, which can fire electricity and warp other infected citizens, turning them into electric symbiotes called \"Electrolings\". Symbiote Electro manages to escape, but reemerges later in [[Central Park]], trying to reach the city's power supply.

He is sent to Ravencroft, where he becomes one of the test subjects of experiments funded by the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] and overseen by Donald Menken (later revealed to be the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] in disguise), and meets the serial killer [[Cletus Kasady]] (who was defeated by Spider-Man), developing an opinion that only complete psychopaths like Kasady deserve to be in Ravencroft. Electro later escapes from Ravencroft and goes on to drain the city's power, leading to a complete blackout. When Spider-Man comes to confront him, Electro reveals the experiments that the scientists at Ravencroft had done on him, and accuses Spider-Man of not being there to save him, since they were \"partners\".

He then decided to use his new-found powers for crime, but his plans are constantly foiled by Spider-Man; Electro's ultimate goal is to become a being of pure energy. Alongside [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] and [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], Electro serves as one of Spider-Man's oldest enemies, having already fought him several times during the hero's past eight years career, and, some time prior to the events of the game, was defeated by Spider-Man and imprisoned in the Raft, a maximum security prison designed especially for supervillains. After Otto Octavius (now calling himself \"[[Doctor Octopus]]\") attacks both Ryker's Island and the Raft, resulting in massive prison breakouts, he releases Electro, Rhino, Scorpion, Vulture and [[Mister Negative]], and recruits them to form the [[Sinister Six]], promising to fulfill each one's desires; Octavius also provides Electro with some custom-made equipment that increases his powers and brings him one step closer from achieving his goal of becoming pure energy. When Spider-Man comes to investigate the breakout, Electro has the hero chase him to a landing pad, where he is ambushed and easily defeated by the Sinister Six, although Octavius orders them not to kill him (because, as it is revealed at the end of the game, Otto is aware of Spider-Man's secret identity). The Sinister Six then split up to fulfill their respective tasks, with Electro and Vulture being sent to cripple the city's power supply. After being lured into a trap by Octavius, Spider-Man survives, only to be captured by Vulture, who brings him to Electro so that together they could finally kill the web-slinger. Spider-Man ultimately defeats both of them, foiling their plan and leaving them for the police to take them back into custody.

Interior artwork from ''Amazing Spider-Man Annual''#1 (October 1964 ).Art by [[Steve Ditko]].]]\nWhile Maxwell Dillon, an [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineer]] and [[Lineman (technician)|lineman]], was repairing a power line, a freak [[lightning]] accident caused a mutagenic change that transformed him into a living electrical [[capacitor]]. His powers were initially weak, so he spent some time stealing electrical equipment from [[Stark Industries]] to charge himself. During this time, he was approached by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], who considered him a potential recruit for his [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], claiming that Dillon's power rivaled his own, but Dillon refused. The following day, Dillon was confronted by a small-time thug from whom he had been borrowing money to pay for the machinery he had needed. When the thug drew a gun on him because he had not paid back the money yet, he responded by shooting a blast of lightning through the thug's chest\u2014the first time Dillon ever killed anybody.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' vol. 2, #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Soon taking the name \"Electro\", he turned to a life of a professional criminal, his first victim being [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. Electro broke into the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' Building and stole from Jameson's safe right in front of him. Jameson accused Spider-Man of being an alternate identity of Electro, prompting Spider-Man to prove the publisher wrong. During their first ever confrontation, Spider-Man was nearly killed after touching the electrically charged villain. Spider-Man eventually used a [[fire hose]] to short-circuit Electro while wearing rubber gloves to protect himself.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #9 (Feb. 1964). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nElectro next confronted [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] for the first time when trying to break into the [[Baxter Building]]. He was again defeated.<ref>''Daredevil'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Electro later joined the original [[Sinister Six]] led by [[Doctor Octopus]], and was the first member of the group to fight Spider-Man, battling him at a Stark plant, when Spider-Man dodged a bolt of electricity he realized his powers had returned. Electro lost his power when the power was cut off by Spider-Man. Spider-Man got a card from him that led him to fight [[Kraven the Hunter]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Electro attacked the [[Fantastic Four]] at the wedding of [[Invisible Woman|Sue Storm]] and Reed Richards, under the control of [[Doctor Doom]]'s mind-control machine, but due to [[Mister Fantastic]] he, like the other villains, has no memory of the incident.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later recruited the second [[Emissaries of Evil]] in a plot of revenge against Daredevil for previous defeats. This group consisted of [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]], [[Stilt-Man]], [[Leap-Frog (comics)|Leap-Frog]], and the [[Matador (Marvel Comics)|Matador]].<ref>''Daredevil Annual'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nElectro was later hired by J. Jonah Jameson to defeat Spider-Man on national television.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #82. Marvel Comics.</ref> He encountered Daredevil again in San Francisco, at which time he temporarily donned a modified costume.<ref>''Daredevil'' #87. Marvel Comics.</ref> He then took control of a Protarian android seeking the destruction of [[Omega the Unknown|Omega]].<ref>''Omega the Unknown'' #3. Marve Comics.</ref> Electro then teamed with [[Blizzard (comics)#Gregor Shapanka|Blizzard]] against Spider-Man and Daredevil.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #56</ref> Electro then attempted to aid a band of criminals escaping the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>''Defenders'' #63. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nElectro later joined the [[Frightful Four]].<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #39. Marvel Comics.</ref> As part of the Frightful Four, he used Spider-Man as bait to trap the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #218. Marvel Comics.</ref> Subsequently, he battled the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] but was defeated, partly because he did not consider the Falcon to be a serious threat.<ref>''Falcon'' #3\u20134. Marvel Comics.</ref> Electro later learned that he can electro-statically disrupt Spider-Man's wall-crawling ability.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #134. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] and [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] then sent the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] to try to recruit Electro into their organization.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #157. Marvel Comics.</ref> Instead, he later accepted Doctor Octopus' invitation to rejoin the Sinister Six, and battled Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #334\u2013339. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nElectro has fought Spider-Man countless times, either on his own or as part of a group such as the [[Sinister Six]]. He has also fought such other heroes as Daredevil, the Fantastic Four, and the [[New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]. Despite his immense power, he has almost always been defeated, usually as a result of his foes outsmarting him or taking advantage of his weakness to water while charged.\n\nAs a result of his frequent and often embarrassing defeats, Electro tried to take over [[New York City]]'s power supply in an attempt at glory and respect. Spider-Man thwarted this plan, however, and convinced Electro to quit his criminal career. When [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] (Spider-Man's insane clone) started killing enemies of Spider-Man, Electro began to fear for his life and temporarily joined [[Mysterio]]'s Sinister Seven, which had been formed to combat Kaine. This group was quickly disbanded, and following Kaine's subsequent disappearance, Electro returned to retirement.\n\nThis changed when the [[Richard Fisk|Rose]] agreed to fund an experimental technique that would amplify Electro's abilities, in exchange for Electro's services as an enforcer. Seeing this as a chance to rise above the string of failures that had made up so much of his life, Electro underwent the procedure. After paying off his debt to the Rose by defeating several members of The True Believers (an offshoot of the famous ninja sect called the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]]), a group of ninja assassins who had been interfering in the Rose's operations, Electro attempted to demonstrate his newly amplified powers to the world, once again attempting to take control of New York City's power supply. Wearing an insulated suit, Spider-Man stopped him. Electro, in an effort to make a final grand gesture, threw himself into the [[Hudson River]] while his body was highly charged, seemingly killing himself in an explosion.\n\nSomehow surviving, Electro resurfaced later as part of the re-formed Sinister Six, formed to kill [[Senator Ward (comics)|Senator Stewart Ward]] and Doctor Octopus (whom the other members of the Six now hated due to his arrogance). His powers had seemingly reverted to their pre-amplification level, and he wore a new blue-and-white costume. When [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] betrayed his fellow Sinister Six members, attempting to kill them one by one, he attacked Electro and left him for dead. Once again, Electro survived, and when he next appeared had returned to his yellow-and green-costume.\n\nElectro was working with the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]]<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> when they were attacked by Spider-Man who thought they had kidnapped his [[Aunt May]].{{issue|date=January 2014}} Electro managed to bring Spider-Man to the edge of defeat, using his powers in more intelligent ways and blowing up a large number of cars, including some with children in them. After a devastating battle, Spider-Man defeated him by fighting him to a gas refinery. The badly wounded Electro recovered fairly quickly, and shortly afterwards joined the [[Sinister Six#Sinister Twelve|Sinister Twelve]], assembled by the [[Green Goblin]], though he and the rest of the team was defeated thanks to the intervention of the [[Fantastic Four]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man]] and [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]].{{Issue|date=September 2010}}\n\n[[File:Electro (Max Dillon) (The Amazing Spider-Man).jpg|145px|Electro's new look in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''. Art by [[Paul Azaceta]].|right|thumb]]\nLater, separately, he was hired by the [[Skrull]] [[Skrull#Known Skrulls|Pagon]] (posing as [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]) to free [[Sauron (comics)|Karl Lykos]] (also known as Sauron) from The Raft, a maximum-security prison for supervillains.<ref>''New Avengers'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> After causing a riot, Electro tried to run away with his waitress girlfriend, but was captured by the [[New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]], subsequently fainting when faced with the prospect of being beaten up by [[Luke Cage]], using Spider-Man's webbing to protect himself from Electro.<ref>''New Avengers'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nLater, Electro joined Chameleon's \"Exterminators\",<ref name=\"marvunapp1\" /> seeking to take advantage of Peter Parker and his loved ones.\n\nDuring the \"[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\" storyline, Electro was among the villains in [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]]'s unnamed villain army when [[Iron Man]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] raided the hideout.<ref>''Civil War: War Crimes'' (February 2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn \"[[Secret Invasion]],\" Electro appears as member of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s crime syndicate and attacked a [[Skrull]] force. After the Skrull posing as [[Edwin Jarvis]] kidnaps the baby of Luke Cage and [[Jessica Jones]], the Avengers and the Fantastic Four begin going after everyone who is associated with the Skrulls. Because of this, Electro is confronted by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in an alley where, after a battle, he leaves Dillon beaten and unconscious.<ref>''New Avengers'' #48. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nElectro returns in ''[[The Gauntlet and Grim Hunt|The Gauntlet]]'', with a new look as his face is now scarred with lightning bolts. The revamp was explained by writer Mark Waid, stating that artist Paul Azaceta \"tweaked the design a bit, adding some burn scars to reflect Electro's current situation. As Electro gets older, as his body chemistry starts to shift into middle age, his powers are becoming more erratic and less easy for him to control. So he turns to a surprise Marvel villain \u2013 someone rarely, if ever, seen in the pages of ''Amazing'' \u2013 to level up.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/102/1026877p3.html|title=IGN.com \"Spider-Man: Enter the Gauntlet\"}}</ref> During his appearance in \"The Guantlet\", it is revealed that Electro has lost control over his powers: besides the physical disfigurement, his touch is now 100% lethal. Depressed and angry at the world because of this, Electro begins gathering other outcasts and misfits into a group known as \"Power To The People\", which targets right-wing newspaper baron [[Dexter Bennett]] and the New York Stock Exchange in the wake of the 2008 Financial Crisis. Electro's group manages to gain positive coverage in the media, hampering Spider-Man's ability to convince Electro's followers of his true evil nature.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #612. Marvel Comics.</ref> Electro's duplicitous nature causes him to betray his followers in order to align with the amoral Bennett in exchange for help finding a way to restore his powers to a controllable level. The [[Mad Thinker]] is able to come up with a process to cure Electro, but Spider-Man interferes with the process, turning Electro into an artificial electrical thunderbolt. Furious, Electro double-crosses Bennett and ultimately uses his new powers to destroy The [[Daily Bugle|DB]] building, crippling Bennett in the process. In doing so, Electro uses up so much of his newfound power that Spider-Man is able to neutralize him with his webbing.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #613\u2013614. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the epilogue, Electro runs into Sasha Kravinoff and Chameleon in his new jail cell.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #614. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the following issue involving Sandman, it is revealed that Electro has escaped.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #615</ref> Under the orders of the Kravinoffs, he breaks the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)#Jimmy Natale|fourth Vulture]] out of prison.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #623. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]]\" storyline, it is suspected by the [[Young Allies (Marvel Comics)|Young Allies]] that Electro had a discarded and disavowed daughter named [[Aftershock (comics)|Aftershock]] (similar to the MC2 Universe version) who is a member of the [[Bastards of Evil]].<ref>''Young Allies'' vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Young Allies members [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]] and [[Gravity (comics)|Gravity]] fight Electro, he defeats them and lets them live so that they can spread the message that he does not endorse Aftershock and the Bastards of Evil's terrorism. He also says they can look up how and when he got his powers on the internet and there was no way a girl of Aftershock's age could have been conceived after he got his powers: It's impossible for him to be Aftershock's father.<ref>''Young Allies'' vol. 2, #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nElectro is later present at the scene where [[Spider-Woman (Mattie Franklin)|Mattie Franklin]] is sacrificed by Sasha Kravinoff as part of a ritual that resurrects [[Grim Hunter|Vladimir Kravinoff]] as a large humanoid lion creature.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #634. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \"Origin of the Species\" storyline, Electro is among the supervillains invited by Doctor Octopus to join his supervillain team where they are promised that they will receive a reward in exchange for securing some specific items.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #642. Marvel Comics.</ref> Electro goes after Spider-Man for [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]]'s infant. Anticipating Spider-Man's plan to deliver the infant to a hospital, Electro waits at the nearest hospital in Spider-Man's area until Spider-Man shows up. The two begin to battle until Sandman interferes and Spider-Man tricks Electro into electrocuting Sandman, turning him into glass. Flying shards of glass hit Electro, temporarily stunning him and allowing Spider-Man to escape.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #643. Marvel Comics.</ref> Spider-Man goes on an angry rampage against all the villains after the Chameleon tricks him into thinking the infant is dead. He defeats Electro in [[Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #645. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Spider-Man: Big Time|Big Time]]'' storyline, Electro becomes a member of Doctor Octopus' new Sinister Six and helps Chameleon break into an air force base in New Jersey.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #648. Marvel Comics.</ref> Electro was with the Sinister Six when it came to fighting Intelligencia. During a conflict between the Intelligencia and the Sinister Six, Mad Thinker was able to briefly deactivate Electro's powers, but was caught off-guard when Electro physically attacked him instead, the surprise of the attack allowed Electro to defeat Mad Thinker.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #676. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the \"'[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]\" storyline despite the Sinister Six being prepared for a fight with the Avengers, Electro was the first of the team to be defeated, being hurled into the upper atmosphere by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] while distracted by his inability to attack Spider-Man's new hi-tech armor.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #683. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nElectro returns to Earth and attempts to avenge himself on Thor by forcing an A.I.M. scientist to convert him to generate protons instead of electrons, but he is defeated when [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] (Doctor Octopus' mind in Spider-Man's body) manages to convert him into a stream of protons and traps him. Superior Spider-Man places Electro in containment next to Sandman in his hidden underwater lab.<ref>''Avenging Spider-Man'' #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> Electro, Chameleon, Sandman, [[Mysterio#Mysterion|Mysterion]], and the Vulture are later seen as part of a team led by Superior Spider-Man called the \"Superior Six\". Superior Spider-Man has been temporarily controlling their minds in order to redeem them for their crimes. He does this by forcing them to do heroic deeds against their will, some of which almost get them killed. Every time he is done controlling them, he puts them back in their containment cells.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> They eventually break free of Superior Spider-Man's control and attempt to exact revenge on the wall-crawler, nearly destroying New York in order to do so.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> With the help of Sun Girl, Superior Spider-Man is barely able to stop the Superior Six.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nElectro was seen battling the [[Punisher]] in Los Angeles, California.<ref>'''The Punisher''' vol. 9, #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nSometime after Spider-Man regained his body, Electro comes into the Bar With No Name and is introduced to the Hobgoblin's servants by his friend and bartender, Deke. The villains start joking about the gloomy Electro. One mentions how Thor launched him into space, another about how \"Spider-Man\" made him part of the Superior Six, and yet another about how Electro was taken out by the Punisher, despite the latter's lack of powers. Electro gets angry and starts sparking, but the bartender gets the situation under control by commenting on how bad the Punisher is and with compliments like breaking so many villains out of the Raft, which earned him the respect of [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] and [[Count Nefaria]]. This does not stop the others, however. Determined to get respect, Electro heads back over to the Raft, ready for another breakout despite the Green Goblin having done the same just recently and the fact that it was re-christened as Spider-Island II. Electro sends a blot of electricity around, but it grows excessively big and he cannot turn it off. He finally exhausts all of his power but when this happens, he passes out and many of the villains he tried to break out are now dead. Vowing revenge, Electro soon realizes what caused this to happen to him: experiments conducted by \"Spider-Man\".<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Electro later visits his friend, Francine Frye, and keeps his distance because of his uncontrollable powers. Francine starts to kiss Electro, only to end up dying from electrocution.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #2\">''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> At Peter Parker's behest, [[Parker Industries]] is testing out an anti-Electro netting that can capture Electro.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Electro is later seen with Black Cat when they raid [[Eel (comics)|Eel]]'s hideout where Electro defeats Eel. Electro and Black Cat later crash the meeting between [[Mister Negative]] and [[Phil Urich]] (who is leading the remnants of the Goblin Underground as the self-proclaimed Goblin King) where they throw Eel's body into the area where the meeting is. During Peter Parker's interview on the Fact Channel, Electro attacks the security team on the channel and the Black Cat arrives, announcing her demand that if Spider-Man does not show up in 15 minutes, Peter Parker will be dead. Electro complains about the plan but Black Cat stays determined that Spider-Man will show up, but then Silk arrives to confront them both, giving Peter the time to change into Spider-Man and jump into action, aiding Silk. As she battles against Electro and Spider-Man deals with Black Cat, J. Jonah Jameson remains on the channel forcing the cameraman to film the action. Electro fails to stop Silk, but the Black Cat redirects one of Electro's bolts into hitting Spider-Man, knocking him down in the process.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Electro pressures Sajani into telling him how effective the anti-Electro traps will be in removing his powers, but the Black Cat interrupts their talk in order to ask her how the device works. They both infiltrate the demonstration, suiting Electro into the \"Fake Electro\" costume while Black Cat disguises herself as one of the operators. Black Cat starts the machine, further enhancing Electro's power, only to be interrupted by Spider-Man and Silk. Electro tries to escape but his insulated webbing protects him by allowing Silk to cover Electro with her webbing. Black Cat changes the plan, using the wiring to overload Electro by putting his powers way out of control, shooting his lightning bolts against the helicopter. Silk saves the helicopter and Spider-Man jumps into the machine, using his webbing to cover Electro in order to take him out of there. Electro asks to let go, but Spider-Man remains determined to hold him until they are both saved by Silk who pulls them out of the machine and away from the explosion which failed to kill Spider-Man as Black Cat wanted and she escapes. However, Electro was apparently de-powered and taken into custody.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAs part of the \"[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]\", a de-powered Maxwell Dillon was shown as an inmate at Andry Corrections Facility alongside [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]].

Dillon agrees to go ahead with the procedure.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #16\">''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #16.

Francine observes the Jackal's attempt to restore Dillon's powers, but the experiment fails, charging his suit but not his body. Unexpectedly, the DNA in Dillon's saliva that was mixed in with Francine's own DNA attracts the electrical energy to Francine. Desiring more, Francine leans in to kiss Dillon and kills him in the process while absorbing his powers as the resulting action burns Dillon's body.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #17\">''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #17.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAn unusually configured magnetic field was created when Max Dillon was struck by lightning while holding live, high-tension wires and a wound reel of one-inch cable, granting him superhuman powers. Electro can generate massive quantities of [[electricity]], theoretically up to approximately one million [[volt]]s. He can employ this electrostatic energy as lightning arcs from his fingertips, and his maximum charge is more than enough to kill a normal human.\n\nWhen his body is charged to high levels, he becomes superhumanly strong and fast. He can also glide over power lines by using the electricity contained therein for propulsion, and he has on occasion been shown to actually ride on lightning bolts. During a stint in prison, [[Doctor Octopus]] gave him the ideas of ionizing metals and sparking the petroleum in the fuel tanks of vehicles as a way to generate explosions. He can charge himself up to make himself more powerful. He can also absorb the energy of electrical equipment such as a power plant to increase his powers further.\n\nIn ''New Avengers'', he was shown to fly and manipulate large amounts of electricity and machinery, when he freed all the prisoners at Ryker's Island.{{issue|date=December 2014}}\n\nAn experimental procedure heightened his powers, allowing Electro to store and absorb a seemingly limitless amount of electricity. He also seemed to gain the power over magnetism to a certain degree, allowing him to manipulate magnetic fields and move objects in a manner similar to that of [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], and could overcome his old weakness to water by using the electromagnetic fields around him to vaporize water before it could touch him. He made Spider-Man beg by stimulating the bioelectric currents in his brain, and was able to defeat [[Nate Grey]] by manipulating said currents in Nate's brain to turn his own psionic powers against him.\n\nElectro can override any electrically powered device and manipulate it according to his mental commands.\n\nBy using an external electrical power source to recharge his body's energy reserves, Electro could expend electricity indefinitely without diminishing his personal reserves. When he is fully charged, Electro is extremely sensitive to anything that may \"short circuit\" him, such as water.\n\nElectro propels himself along magnetic lines of force in objects that have great electrical potential, such as high-tension electrical lines. He can also create electrostatic bridges to traverse upon, at the cost of a great expenditure of energy.\n\nDuring the events of the storyline \"The Gauntlet\", Electro became a living artificial thunderbolt, allowing him to travel through electrical appliances such as going through a light bulb and exiting through any other electronic device connected to the power source.{{Issue|date=November 2010}} He was also able to transmit himself over Spider-Man's web line.{{Issue|date=November 2010}}\n\n==Other versions==\n===House of M===\nIn the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, Electro is one of Rhino's friends (along with [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] and [[Ox (comics)|Ox]]) who helped him attack and detain the Green Goblin for ruining the best chance at a good life Rhino ever had.<ref>''Spider-Man: House of M'' #3.

In the episode \"Bring on the Bad Guys\" Pt. 4, Electro is the final villain attempting to collect the bounty placed on Spider-Man and ambushes him on his way to Horizon High's Open House while constantly having to recharge her exoskeleton. After using a Power Amplifier made by Peter Parker, Electro transforms into a being of electrical energy (a homage to the Ultimate Marvel version of Electro). She caused significant damage to Horizon High's Open House until Spider-Man (using a hand-made electoproof suit and energy-absorbing gauntlets from components from the other projects) defeats her, returning Electro to normal. Spider-Man then webs her up for the police and gives the absorbed electricity to Max Modell, who cancelled the Open House due to damages caused by Electro. She returns in the episode \"The Living Brain\", where Electro fights Spider-Man and Police Chief [[Wraith (comics)|Yuri Watanabe]] alongside the [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]] inside of the Supervillain Holding Facility. Both of them are ultimately defeated and returned to their cells. In the episode \"Brand New Day\", Electro is transferred to The Cellar and is one of the villains suspected by Spider-Man to have been involved in the capture of the Avengers, though it turns out Regent was replicating her powers. In the episode \"Goblin War: Part 3\", Electro is shown to have become leader of a faction of the Goblin Nation known as the Electro Goblins. During a scuffle with the War Goblins, Electro is weakened by a device that [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] commissioned \"some eggheads\" to build for him.\n\n===Film===\n[[File:Jamie Foxx as Electro.jpg|thumb|upright|Jamie Foxx as Electro in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]''.]]\n[[Jamie Foxx]] portrays Maxwell \"Max\" Dillon / Electro in the 2014 film ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.movies.yahoo.com/electro-confirmed-amazing-spider-man-2-main-villain-192400411.html?cat=857 |title=Electro confirmed as The Amazing Spider-Man 2's main villain |publisher=YahooMail |date=November 22, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203235210/http://uk.movies.yahoo.com/electro-confirmed-amazing-spider-man-2-main-villain-192400411.html?cat=857 |archivedate=December 3, 2013 }}</ref> Foxx revealed that the character was redesigned to be more grounded, and that the villain's classic yellow and green suit would be omitted in favor of a modern look.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/the-amazing-spider-man-2-electro-costume-is-getting-a-modern-redesign |title=The Amazing Spider-Man 2 Electro Costume Is Getting a Modern Redesign |publisher=Movieweb.com|date=December 17, 2012}}</ref> This incarnation of the character is [[African-American]], as opposed to being Caucasian in the comics.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/257398271.html | title=The electric Jamie Foxx puts a charge into 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' | work=[[Star Tribune]] | accessdate=February 21, 2017 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508061637/http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/257398271.html | archivedate=May 8, 2014 | url-status=unfit}}</ref> In the film, Max Dillon is an [[electrical engineer]] at [[Oscorp]] and a \"nobody\" who idolizes Spider-Man after being saved by him in a battle against [[Rhino (comics)|Aleksei Sytsevich]] before getting transformed in an accident while fixing a power line, electrocuting him and causing him to fall into a tank full of genetically-engineered electric eels. He realizes that his newly gained powers make the world finally recognize him, having been shunned, humiliated and ignored his entire life. Having become mentally unstable, he is confronted by Spider-Man in Times Square, where he mistakenly believes Spider-Man is attempting to steal his newfound fame and betray him. After a brief battle, Dillon is subdued and held captive in Ravencroft to be studied where he adopts the name \"Electro\", but is later broken out by [[Harry Osborn]] who requires his help to break back into Oscorp to find a cure for his own terminal illness. Electro agrees and is given a new suit to control his powers. After they successfully break into Oscorp, Harry allows Electro to take over the electrical grid he designed, manipulating it to control the electricity in New York so that the citizens will be at his mercy. After having magnetized his web-shooters to prevent them from being damaged by Electro's powers, Spider-Man once again confronts Dillon, and during their battle is able to reconnect the damaged electrical grid, allowing [[Gwen Stacy]] to reactivate it. This allows Spider-Man to [[overcurrent|overload Electro with his own electricity]], causing his body to explode.\n\n===Video games===\n* Electro is a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] in the [[arcade game]] ''[[Spider-Man: The Video Game]]''; in the [[Game Boy Advance]] game ''[[Spider-Man: Mysterio's Menace]]''; and in the home games ''[[Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six]]''; ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin]]'', at a level set in a power station.\n* Electro appears in the game ''[[Spider-Man and Captain America in Doctor Doom's Revenge]]''.<ref>[https://archive.today/20110713045341/http://www.internapse.com/marvel/merchandise/videogames/classic/spiderman1989/ Marvel Gateway by Internapse]</ref>\n* Electro appears in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 3: Invasion of the Spider-Slayers]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n* Electro appears in the ''[[Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro]]'' [[video game]], voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} His goal is to use the \"Bio-Nexus Device\", a mechanism that can enhance a person's [[Bioelectricity|bioelectric field]], to become a god.

Spider-Man gives chase and eventually defeats Electro, but [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] shoots him to stop him for good. However, as Spider-Man confronts Black Widow about this, Electro's infected sister rushes over to him and accidentally infects Electro with her symbiote, which heals him and transforms him into a feral monster obsessed with absorbing electricity. He gains the power to create his own pods, which can fire electricity and warp other infected citizens, turning them into electric symbiotes called \"Electrolings\". Symbiote Electro manages to escape, but reemerges later in [[Central Park]], trying to reach the city's power supply. Spider-Man tracks him down with the help of [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] and fights him and his Electrolings. After defeating Symbiote Electro, Spider-Man is given the choice of either letting him remove the symbiote himself, or removing it by force, which will also cause Electro to fry the symbiote that possessed him in grief. Regardless the choice, Electro then becomes an ally and the player can summon him at anytime during gameplay, to help them fight enemies. In the final mission of the game, if Spider-Man has chosen to destroy the device meant to stop the invasion, Electro is seen aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D.

He then helps Spider-Man prevent a potentially catastrophic incident caused by the conflict between the two gangs, which causes him to develop an unhealthy attraction to the hero. Max later fails to report to [[Donald Menken]] that the blueprint of the power grid he invented was stolen by one of Oscorp\u2019s employees, stealing all of his credits, and has a freak accident that gives him electric super-powers, but also completely disfigures him. Realizing that Spider-Man won\u2019t be able to recognize him in his current state, and that both Spider-Man and police will try to arrest him soon, Max becomes the criminal Electro, but somehow gets arrested off-screen. He is sent to Ravencroft, where he becomes one of the test subjects of experiments funded by the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] and overseen by Donald Menken (later revealed to be the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] in disguise), and meets the serial killer [[Cletus Kasady]] (who was defeated by Spider-Man), developing an opinion that only complete psychopaths like Kasady deserve to be in Ravencroft. Electro later escapes from Ravencroft and goes on to drain the city's power, leading to a complete blackout. When Spider-Man comes to confront him, Electro reveals the experiments that the scientists at Ravencroft had done on him, and accuses Spider-Man of not being there to save him, since they were \"partners\". He then proceeds to fight Spider-Man, but is ultimately defeated and his body explodes as a result, leading Spider-Man to feel pity for Electro and vow to expose Ravencroft.\n** Electro also serves as a boss who is fought twice in the mobile version of the game.

He then decided to use his new-found powers for crime, but his plans are constantly foiled by Spider-Man; Electro's ultimate goal is to become a being of pure energy. Alongside [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] and [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], Electro serves as one of Spider-Man's oldest enemies, having already fought him several times during the hero's past eight years career, and, some time prior to the events of the game, was defeated by Spider-Man and imprisoned in the Raft, a maximum security prison designed especially for supervillains. After Otto Octavius (now calling himself \"[[Doctor Octopus]]\") attacks both Ryker's Island and the Raft, resulting in massive prison breakouts, he releases Electro, Rhino, Scorpion, Vulture and [[Mister Negative]], and recruits them to form the [[Sinister Six]], promising to fulfill each one's desires; Octavius also provides Electro with some custom-made equipment that increases his powers and brings him one step closer from achieving his goal of becoming pure energy. When Spider-Man comes to investigate the breakout, Electro has the hero chase him to a landing pad, where he is ambushed and easily defeated by the Sinister Six, although Octavius orders them not to kill him (because, as it is revealed at the end of the game, Otto is aware of Spider-Man's secret identity). The Sinister Six then split up to fulfill their respective tasks, with Electro and Vulture being sent to cripple the city's power supply. After being lured into a trap by Octavius, Spider-Man survives, only to be captured by Vulture, who brings him to Electro so that together they could finally kill the web-slinger. Spider-Man ultimately defeats both of them, foiling their plan and leaving them for the police to take them back into custody.

He is a former academy coach for the Under 16s at [[Premier League]] side [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].<ref>http://www.edp24.co.uk/sport/norwich-city/darren_huckerby_is_promoted_as_part_of_norwich_city_academy_shake_up_1_4144370</ref>\n\nAs a player, he was a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] from 1993 until 2009. He played most matches for [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], but also featured for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. He finished his career by playing in the US, appearing in [[Major League Soccer]] for [[San Jose Earthquakes]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Lincoln City===\nHuckerby was born in [[Nottingham]], England. His mother is of partial [[Georgian people|Georgian]] descent. Huckerby started playing professionally for [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] in [[Football League Division Three]]. Huckerby was promoted to the first team at [[Sincil Bank]] by [[Keith Alexander (footballer)|Keith Alexander]], but also played under the stewardship of both [[Sam Ellis (footballer)|Sam Ellis]] and [[Steve Wicks]] before being sold in 1995. He finished his spell with Lincoln having scored 5 goals in 28 league appearances.\n\n===Newcastle United===\nHuckerby made a three division step up by signing for [[Premier League]] title contenders [[Newcastle United]] in a \u00a3400,000 deal in 1995. Despite being highly rated by the fans and pundits, Huckerby found first team chances severely limited, especially since manager Kevin Keegan decided to scrap the reserve team, in response to a requirement from [[the FA]]  that a certain percentage of home reserve fixtures be played at [[St James' Park]]. Keegan believed that this would negatively affect the pitch condition, which was already in poor state. This of course meant that, with no reserve team football, Huckerby was not match fit for the majority of his time on Tyneside. Huckerby made only one appearance for the Magpies, before being loaned out to [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]]. Huckerby then joined [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] for \u00a31&nbsp;million in time for the start of the next season, signed by then City boss [[Gordon Strachan]].\n\n===Coventry City===\nThe striker's pace and dribbling ability, combined with a very successful partnership with [[Dion Dublin]] saw Huckerby play a key role at Coventry. Huckerby and Dublin's partnership did not go unnoticed and earned Huckerby a call up to the England B squad, whilst Dublin managed call ups to the full squad, under Glenn Hoddle. Huckerby played a major role in Coventry's [[Premier League]] survival,  culminating with a final day 2\u20131 win at [[Tottenham Hotspur]] in 1997. His success with the ''Sky Blues'' continued throughout the following season as Coventry enjoyed a ten-game unbeaten run and reached the quarter finals of the FA Cup, narrowly losing on penalties to Sheffield United. Huckerby scored several goals, most notably the winner in a 3\u20132 victory over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at [[Highfield Road]], a dazzling run past a few defenders before slotting past [[Kevin Pilkington]]. He notched up 14 goals that season, his best Premier League return of goals.\n\n===Leeds United===\nHe was sold to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] the following summer for a reputed \u00a36&nbsp;million. In his time at [[Elland Road]], he scored two goals in 40 league games, both of which were against former club Coventry City<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-the-day-hedman-lost-his-head-1117935.html |title=The day Hedman lost his head |work=[[The Independent]] |date=11 September 1999 |accessdate=6 November 2009 | location=London | first=Jon | last=Culley}}</ref> and Watford.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/may/04/match.sport3 |title=Leeds ready to join Europe's elite |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=3 May 2000 |accessdate=6 November 2009\n| location=London | first=Daniel | last=Taylor}}</ref> He had to compete for a place in the team with some players such as [[Mark Viduka]], [[Alan Smith (footballer born 1980)|Alan Smith]] and [[Michael Bridges]] and as a result he was never a regular, although he did score against Partizan Belgrade in the 1999\u20132000 UEFA Cup,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ozwhitelufc.net.au/30-09-1999%20LUFC%20v%20Partizan%20Belgrade.htm |title=Leeds United 1 Partizan Belgrade 0 |publisher=OzWhiteLUFC |date=30 September 1999 |accessdate=6 November 2009}}</ref> and in a 6\u20130 win against Be\u015fikta\u015f in the 2000\u201301 Champions League.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/leeds-in-overdrive-to-belittle-besiktas-700832.html |title=Leeds in overdrive to belittle Be\u015fikta\u015f |work=[[The Independent]] |date=26 September 2000 |accessdate=6 November 2009 | location=London | first=Phil | last=Shaw}}</ref> In all competitions, he scored six goals in total.\n\n===Manchester City===\n[[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] signed him in December 2000 for \u00a33.38&nbsp;million, as they attempted to avoid relegation. Although the club did eventually go down, he stayed on and won a [[Football League First Division|First Division]] championship medal, adding 26 goals in all competitions during the campaign, including two [[hat trick|hat-tricks]].\n\nHuckerby started the new campaign as first choice, and scored the team's first goal of [[2002\u201303 FA Premier League|the season]], a header against former employer Newcastle that secured a 1\u20130 win. However, the arrivals of [[Nicolas Anelka]] and [[Jon Macken]] meant less playing time, and he eventually ended up playing out the end of the season on-loan to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Forest seal Huckerby deal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/nottm_forest/2743735.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=13 February 2003|accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref> being part of the team that reached the Division One [[playoffs]] in 2003.\n\n===Norwich City===\nHuckerby spent a three-month loan spell with [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], before signing permanently in December 2003, for a fee of \u00a3750,000, which rose to \u00a31&nbsp;million when ''the Canaries'' were promoted at the end of the season. At Norwich, Huckerby's career settled, and he netted 14 league goals in the First Division in the [[2003\u201304 in English football|2003\u201304 season]]. He was instrumental in Norwich's march to the First Division championship in 2003\u201304, and came second in the supporters vote for [[List of Norwich City F.C. Players of the Year|player of the season]] behind [[Craig Fleming]].\n\nReverting to a left wing role for much of Norwich's Premier League spell in [[2004\u201305 FA Premier League|2004\u201305]], Huckerby scored seven goals. He was linked with a transfer to either [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] or [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] the following summer, but spoke of his intention to see out his contract in [[East Anglia]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15255822 |title=BBC Sport - Darren Huckerby admits regret at manner of Norwich City exit |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 October 2011 |accessdate=22 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nHe was voted Norwich City player of the year by supporters in 2004\u201305 and [[2006\u201307 in English football|2006\u201307]], and placed second behind [[Gary Doherty]] for the [[2005\u201306 in English football|2005\u201306]] season, winning the award twice and adding two runner-up positions in his first four seasons. He was voted into the [[List of Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame members|Norwich City Hall of Fame]] in 2004.

During his time with San Jose, Huckerby was often linked with a return to Norwich City, particularly after the manager who had released him at Norwich \u2013 [[Glenn Roeder]] \u2013 was sacked in January 2009, but he stayed at San Jose.\n\nIn a crucial match for the Earthquakes, on 3 August 2008, Huckerby scored his second goal, against [[Los Angeles Galaxy]], in a 3\u20132 Earthquakes win. On 30 August, he headed in the winning goal in the side's 2\u20131 victory over [[Kansas City Wizards]], extending San Jose's unbeaten streak to seven games. During this stretch, Huckerby notched three goals and three assists.\n\nOn 11 November 2008, it was announced that Huckerby had won the 2008 [[MLS Newcomer of the Year Award]].<ref>{{cite web |last=San Jose Earthquakes Media Relations |title= Huckerby named Newcomer of the Year |url=http://web.mlsnet.com/news/team_news.jsp?ymd=20081111&content_id=203066&vkey=pr_sje&fext=.jsp&team=t110 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123195204/http://web.mlsnet.com/news/team_news.jsp?ymd=20081111&content_id=203066&vkey=pr_sje&fext=.jsp&team=t110 |url-status=dead |archivedate=23 November 2008 |accessdate=11 November 2008}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[2009 Major League Soccer season]], Huckerby underwent surgery to eliminate his hip injury.<ref>{{cite web|last=Beatty |first=Patrick |title=Earthquakes Midfielder Darren Huckerby Undergoes Season-Ending Surgery on Right Hip |url=http://www.mls-rumors.net/3617/2009/09/report-earthquakes-midfielder-darren-huckerby-undergoes-season-ending-surgery-on-right-hip/ |accessdate=12 October 2009 |date=12 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924043853/http://www.mls-rumors.net/3617/2009/09/report-earthquakes-midfielder-darren-huckerby-undergoes-season-ending-surgery-on-right-hip/ |archivedate=24 September 2009  }}</ref> However, on 16 September 2009, at age 33, Huckerby announced that he was '99% sure' of his retirement.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pinkun.com/content/pinkun/norwich-city/story.aspx?brand=PINKUNOnline&category=Norwich&tBrand=PINKUNOnline&tCategory=xDefault&itemid=NOED16%20Sep%202009%2009%3A21%3A43%3A073|title=Huckerby to hang up boots|date=16 September 2009|publisher=www.pinkun.com|accessdate=16 September 2009}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.teamtalk.com/football/story/0,16368,1811_5562985,00.html|title=Huckerby hangs up his boots|date=16 September 2009|publisher=.teamtalk.com|accessdate=16 September 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120911151649/http://www.teamtalk.com/football/story/0,16368,1811_5562985,00.html|archivedate=11 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Masters Football==\nAfter retiring from football in 2009, Huckerby returned to playing football in the Masters Tournament in June 2011 in which he scored 8 goals in the Yorkshire Masters for his old club [[Leeds United]].

He is a former academy coach for the Under 16s at [[Premier League]] side [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].<ref>http://www.edp24.co.uk/sport/norwich-city/darren_huckerby_is_promoted_as_part_of_norwich_city_academy_shake_up_1_4144370</ref>\n\nAs a player, he was a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] from 1993 until 2009. He played most matches for [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], but also featured for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. He finished his career by playing in the US, appearing in [[Major League Soccer]] for [[San Jose Earthquakes]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Lincoln City===\nHuckerby was born in [[Nottingham]], England. His mother is of partial [[Georgian people|Georgian]] descent. Huckerby started playing professionally for [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] in [[Football League Division Three]]. Huckerby was promoted to the first team at [[Sincil Bank]] by [[Keith Alexander (footballer)|Keith Alexander]], but also played under the stewardship of both [[Sam Ellis (footballer)|Sam Ellis]] and [[Steve Wicks]] before being sold in 1995. He finished his spell with Lincoln having scored 5 goals in 28 league appearances.\n\n===Newcastle United===\nHuckerby made a three division step up by signing for [[Premier League]] title contenders [[Newcastle United]] in a \u00a3400,000 deal in 1995. Despite being highly rated by the fans and pundits, Huckerby found first team chances severely limited, especially since manager Kevin Keegan decided to scrap the reserve team, in response to a requirement from [[the FA]]  that a certain percentage of home reserve fixtures be played at [[St James' Park]]. Keegan believed that this would negatively affect the pitch condition, which was already in poor state. This of course meant that, with no reserve team football, Huckerby was not match fit for the majority of his time on Tyneside. Huckerby made only one appearance for the Magpies, before being loaned out to [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]]. Huckerby then joined [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] for \u00a31&nbsp;million in time for the start of the next season, signed by then City boss [[Gordon Strachan]].\n\n===Coventry City===\nThe striker's pace and dribbling ability, combined with a very successful partnership with [[Dion Dublin]] saw Huckerby play a key role at Coventry. Huckerby and Dublin's partnership did not go unnoticed and earned Huckerby a call up to the England B squad, whilst Dublin managed call ups to the full squad, under Glenn Hoddle. Huckerby played a major role in Coventry's [[Premier League]] survival,  culminating with a final day 2\u20131 win at [[Tottenham Hotspur]] in 1997. His success with the ''Sky Blues'' continued throughout the following season as Coventry enjoyed a ten-game unbeaten run and reached the quarter finals of the FA Cup, narrowly losing on penalties to Sheffield United. Huckerby scored several goals, most notably the winner in a 3\u20132 victory over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at [[Highfield Road]], a dazzling run past a few defenders before slotting past [[Kevin Pilkington]]. He notched up 14 goals that season, his best Premier League return of goals.\n\n===Leeds United===\nHe was sold to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] the following summer for a reputed \u00a36&nbsp;million. In his time at [[Elland Road]], he scored two goals in 40 league games, both of which were against former club Coventry City<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-the-day-hedman-lost-his-head-1117935.html\n|title=The day Hedman lost his head\n|work=[[The Independent]]\n|date=11 September 1999 |accessdate=6 November 2009\n| location=London\n| first=Jon\n| last=Culley}}</ref> and Watford.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/may/04/match.sport3\n|title=Leeds ready to join Europe's elite\n|work=[[The Guardian]]\n|date=3 May 2000 |accessdate=6 November 2009\n| location=London\n| first=Daniel\n| last=Taylor}}</ref> He had to compete for a place in the team with some players such as [[Mark Viduka]], [[Alan Smith (footballer born 1980)|Alan Smith]] and [[Michael Bridges]] and as a result he was never a regular, although he did score against Partizan Belgrade in the 1999\u20132000 UEFA Cup,<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.ozwhitelufc.net.au/30-09-1999%20LUFC%20v%20Partizan%20Belgrade.htm\n|title=Leeds United 1 Partizan Belgrade 0\n|publisher=OzWhiteLUFC\n|date=30 September 1999 |accessdate=6 November 2009}}</ref> and in a 6\u20130 win against Be\u015fikta\u015f in the 2000\u201301 Champions League.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/leeds-in-overdrive-to-belittle-besiktas-700832.html\n|title=Leeds in overdrive to belittle Be\u015fikta\u015f\n|work=[[The Independent]]\n|date=26 September 2000 |accessdate=6 November 2009\n| location=London\n| first=Phil\n| last=Shaw}}</ref> In all competitions, he scored six goals in total.\n\n===Manchester City===\n[[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] signed him in December 2000 for \u00a33.38&nbsp;million, as they attempted to avoid relegation. Although the club did eventually go down, he stayed on and won a [[Football League First Division|First Division]] championship medal, adding 26 goals in all competitions during the campaign, including two [[hat trick|hat-tricks]].\n\nHuckerby started the new campaign as first choice, and scored the team's first goal of [[2002\u201303 FA Premier League|the season]], a header against former employer Newcastle that secured a 1\u20130 win. However, the arrivals of [[Nicolas Anelka]] and [[Jon Macken]] meant less playing time, and he eventually ended up playing out the end of the season on-loan to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Forest seal Huckerby deal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/nottm_forest/2743735.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=13 February 2003|accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref> being part of the team that reached the Division One [[playoffs]] in 2003.\n\n===Norwich City===\nHuckerby spent a three-month loan spell with [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], before signing permanently in December 2003, for a fee of \u00a3750,000, which rose to \u00a31&nbsp;million when ''the Canaries'' were promoted at the end of the season. At Norwich, Huckerby's career settled, and he netted 14 league goals in the First Division in the [[2003\u201304 in English football|2003\u201304 season]]. He was instrumental in Norwich's march to the First Division championship in 2003\u201304, and came second in the supporters vote for [[List of Norwich City F.C. Players of the Year|player of the season]] behind [[Craig Fleming]].\n\nReverting to a left wing role for much of Norwich's Premier League spell in [[2004\u201305 FA Premier League|2004\u201305]], Huckerby scored seven goals.

The film is a sequel to the 2016 film ''[[Trolls (film)|Trolls]]'', directed by [[Walt Dohrn]] with co-direction by David P. Smith, produced by [[Gina Shay]], and written by [[Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger|Jonathan Aibel, Glenn Berger]], Elizabeth Tippet, [[Maya Forbes]] and [[Wallace Wolodarsky]], from a story by Aibel and Berger. The film stars [[Anna Kendrick]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[James Corden]], [[Kunal Nayyar]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], and [[Rachel Bloom]].\n\n''Trolls World Tour'' was theatrically released in the United States on April 10, 2020. Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]], the film was also released for [[video on demand|digital rental]] on the same day.\n\n==Plot==\nA celebration of the Techno Trolls is crashed by the [[Rock music|Rock Trolls]], led by Queen Barb. After Barb destroys his DJ station with her [[guitar]]'s power, King Trollex is forced to surrender the string that powers [[Techno]] music. \n\nPoppy, still becoming adjusted to her new leadership as queen, receives a message from Barb that invites all Trolls to a party to unite their music. Her father reveals that there are different kinds of Trolls scattered through their land, each represented by a different style of music that is powered by a magical string kept by the leader of each tribe. Having split into their different forms of music following discord and disagreement over which was the best, Poppy wants to help Barb unite the different forms of music, but both her father and Branch warn her not to trust Barb's intentions and to accept that the other Trolls are different. Poppy does not listen, and sends a cheerful reply to Barb via Debbie, Barb's pet bat.\n\nMeanwhile, Barb gloats over her victory of snatching the [[Techno]] string, revealing her plan to string an enchanted guitar with all six strings, and play a power chord strong enough to destroy all other music, replacing it with [[rock]].\n\nWanting to prove herself as a good queen, Poppy travels via air balloon to recruit the other groups of Trolls, Branch joining her in an attempt to express his feelings towards her. Biggie accidentally stows aboard the balloon, and joins them. Meanwhile, Cooper, who feels like the black sheep among the Pop trolls, goes on a journey himself to find Trolls who look like him.\n\nThe balloon ends up in the land of [[Classical]] Trolls, which, to Poppy's horror, has been decimated by Barb's armada, who captured all the citizens. A single small [[flute]] named Pennywhistle tells Poppy the truth about what happened, and Poppy decides to now unite the other Trolls to stop Barb. Branch and Biggie both urge her to return home to protect the Pop string, but Poppy reveals it hidden in her hair. They then travel to the [[Country]] Trolls' land, but after introducing themselves with a loud medley of pop songs, are jailed by an offended Delta Dawn. A Country Troll named Hickory, who claims he is moved by Poppy's motives, breaks them out, leading to a chase to a ravine, where the group falls into a river. Branch does not trust Hickory, even when the Troll builds a raft to take the group downstream. The conversation is interrupted by Chaz, a [[Smooth Jazz]] Troll who was hired as a bounty hunter to catch Poppy for Barb, who was incredibly offended by Poppy's reply letter. Hickory incapacitates Chaz, but Biggie, disillusioned by Poppy's poor leadership, decides to return home. Shortly after, the group is abducted by a space ship wielding magical soap bubbles.\n\nInside the spaceship, the group meets the [[Funk]] Trolls, and meets up with Cooper, who is revealed to have been a long lost identical twin prince of Funk all along. Cooper tells Poppy he finds comfort in identifying with both [[Pop music|Pop]] and [[Funk]], and his parents, King Quincy and Queen Essence, reveal to Poppy that long ago the original [[Pop music|Pop]] Trolls had attempted to steal the strings and remix the other five music styles into Pop, forcing the other Trolls to each take one string and divide their tribes to save their music. Quincy explains to Poppy that differences are not bad, and trying to make all Trolls the same does not help the problem.\n\nAfter the Rock Trolls [[hijack]] the Funk Trolls' ship, Cooper ejects the group in bubbles, accidentally separating Hickory from the two. Branch and Poppy fight when Poppy refuses to return home to their friends, and Branch admonishes her insisting she cannot be a good queen if she is a poor listener, and the two go their separate ways, heartbroken. Branch is soon captured by both [[K-Pop]] and [[Reggaeton]] bounty hunters. However, he eventually convinces them to stop capturing and fighting and save Poppy and all music.\n\nPoppy reunites with Hickory, showing him the Pop string. Hickory tries to urge her to return home, but suddenly is revealed to have been a [[Yodel]] Troll all along. He and another Yodel Troll, Dickory, had been hired to capture her for Barb, but Hickory had a change of heart. Before she can escape, Poppy is then captured personally by Barb, who takes possession of the sixth and final string. \n\nBiggie returns home and seeing it in shambles, feels remorse over abandoning Poppy. He gathers together their remaining friends to go rescue her and Branch, entering the land of the Rock Trolls.\n\nBarb has Poppy imprisoned over a large concert stage where all the captured Trolls are the audience, and admits she empathizes with Poppy's attempts to be a good queen, as she is trying to make rock supreme to prove her own leadership. Barb uses her enchanted guitar during the concert to turn Branch, and the leaders of the other lands into rock zombies. Poppy seemingly is transformed into a rock zombie when she falls onto the stage, but upon grabbing Barb's guitar, it is revealed to have been wearing gumdrop earplugs.

The film is a sequel to the 2016 film ''[[Trolls (film)|Trolls]]'', directed by [[Walt Dohrn]] with co-direction by David P. Smith, produced by [[Gina Shay]], and written by [[Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger|Jonathan Aibel, Glenn Berger]], Elizabeth Tippet, [[Maya Forbes]] and [[Wallace Wolodarsky]], from a story by Aibel and Berger. The film stars [[Anna Kendrick]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[James Corden]], [[Kunal Nayyar]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], and [[Rachel Bloom]].\n\n''Trolls World Tour'' was theatrically released in the United States on April 10, 2020. Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]], the film was also released for [[video on demand|digital rental]] on the same day.\n\n==Plot==\nA celebration of the Techno Trolls is crashed by the [[Rock music|Rock Trolls]], led by Queen Barb. After Barb destroys his DJ station with her [[guitar]]'s power, King Trollex is forced to surrender the string that powers [[Techno]] music. \n\nPoppy, still becoming adjusted to her new leadership as queen, receives a message from Barb that invites all Trolls to a party to unite their music. Her father reveals that there are different kinds of Trolls scattered through their land, each represented by a different style of music that is powered by a magical string kept by the leader of each tribe. Having split into their different forms of music following discord and disagreement over which was the best, Poppy wants to help Barb unite the different forms of music, but both her father and Branch warn her not to trust Barb's intentions and to accept that the other Trolls are different. Poppy does not listen, and sends a cheerful reply to Barb via Debbie, Barb's pet bat.\n\nMeanwhile, Barb gloats over her victory of snatching the [[Techno]] string, revealing her plan to string an enchanted guitar with all six strings, and play a power chord strong enough to destroy all other music, replacing it with [[rock]].\n\nWanting to prove herself as a good queen, Poppy travels via air balloon to recruit the other groups of Trolls, Branch joining her in an attempt to express his feelings towards her. Biggie accidentally stows aboard the balloon, and joins them. Meanwhile, Cooper, who feels like the black sheep among the Pop trolls, goes on a journey himself to find Trolls who look like him.\n\nThe balloon ends up in the land of [[Classical]] Trolls, which, to Poppy's horror, has been decimated by Barb's armada, who captured all the citizens. A single small [[flute]] named Pennywhistle tells Poppy the truth about what happened, and Poppy decides to now unite the other Trolls to stop Barb. Branch and Biggie both urge her to return home to protect the Pop string, but Poppy reveals it hidden in her hair. They then travel to the [[Country]] Trolls' land, but after introducing themselves with a loud medley of pop songs, are jailed by an offended Delta Dawn. A Country Troll named Hickory, who claims he is moved by Poppy's motives, breaks them out, leading to a chase to a ravine, where the group falls into a river. Branch does not trust Hickory, even when the Troll builds a raft to take the group downstream. The conversation is interrupted by Chaz, a [[Smooth Jazz]] Troll who was hired as a bounty hunter to catch Poppy for Barb, who was incredibly offended by Poppy's reply letter. Hickory incapacitates Chaz, but Biggie, disillusioned by Poppy's poor leadership, decides to return home. Shortly after, the group is abducted by a space ship wielding magical soap bubbles.\n\nInside the spaceship, the group meets the [[Funk]] Trolls, and meets up with Cooper, who is revealed to have been a long lost identical twin prince of Funk all along. Cooper tells Poppy he finds comfort in identifying with both [[Pop music|Pop]] and [[Funk]], and his parents, King Quincy and Queen Essence, reveal to Poppy that long ago the original [[Pop music|Pop]] Trolls had attempted to steal the strings and remix the other five music styles into Pop, forcing the other Trolls to each take one string and divide their tribes to save their music. Quincy explains to Poppy that differences are not bad, and trying to make all Trolls the same does not help the problem.\n\nAfter the Rock Trolls [[hijack]] the Funk Trolls' ship, Cooper ejects the group in bubbles, accidentally separating Hickory from the two. Branch and Poppy fight when Poppy refuses to return home to their friends, and Branch admonishes her insisting she cannot be a good queen if she is a poor listener, and the two go their separate ways, heartbroken. Branch is soon captured by both [[K-Pop]] and [[Reggaeton]] bounty hunters. However, he eventually convinces them to stop capturing and fighting and save Poppy and all music.\n\nPoppy reunites with Hickory, showing him the Pop string. Hickory tries to urge her to return home, but suddenly is revealed to have been a [[Yodel]] Troll all along. He and another Yodel Troll, Dickory, had been hired to capture her for Barb, but Hickory had a change of heart. Before she can escape, Poppy is then captured personally by Barb, who takes possession of the sixth and final string. \n\nBiggie returns home and seeing it in shambles, feels remorse over abandoning Poppy. He gathers together their remaining friends to go rescue her and Branch, entering the land of the Rock Trolls.\n\nBarb has Poppy imprisoned over a large concert stage where all the captured Trolls are the audience, and admits she empathizes with Poppy's attempts to be a good queen, as she is trying to make rock supreme to prove her own leadership. Barb uses her enchanted guitar during the concert to turn Branch, and the leaders of the other lands into rock zombies. Poppy seemingly is transformed into a rock zombie when she falls onto the stage, but upon grabbing Barb's guitar, it is revealed to have been wearing gumdrop earplugs. She admonishes Barb for being a poor queen by not taking time to listen to her people, and smashes the guitar. While it snaps the possessed trolls out of their rock zombie state, it destroys the strings, ending [[music]], and causing all the trolls to lose their colors, much to Barb\u2019s anguish.\n\nCooper hears his heartbeat over a microphone, and creates a rhythmic beat with it, other trolls joining in with clapping, stomping, and other forms of soundmaking, reviving the power of their music, and Poppy encourages everyone to [[sing]] together as their colors are restored. Realizing how important other forms of [[music]] are, and encouraged by her father Thrash, Barb joins in, regaining her colors, and eagerly accepts Poppy's offer of friendship. \n\nBranch is finally able to profess his love to Poppy who reciprocates his feelings, and everyone performs together, all Trolls finally reunited while celebrating their differences.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], Bridget and King Gristle arrive to the Pop Troll village, unaware of the events that have taken place, and worried they have missed the party.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Anna Kendrick]] as Queen Poppy, the optimistic Queen of the pop Trolls and Branch's love interest.\n* [[Justin Timberlake]] as Branch, an over-cautious, good-hearted survivalist pop Troll and Poppy's love interest.\n* [[James Corden]] as Biggie, a chubby, friendly pop Troll.\n* [[Rachel Bloom]] as Queen Barb, the Queen of the Hard Rock Trolls and Thrash's daughter.\n* [[Ozzy Osbourne]] as King Thrash, former King of the Hard Rock Trolls and Barb's father.\n* [[Anderson Paak]] as Prince D, a Funk Troll and Quincy and Essence's son and Cooper\u2019s twin brother.\n* [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] as King Quincy, the King of the Funk Trolls.\n* [[Mary J.
