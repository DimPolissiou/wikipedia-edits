The band incorporated elements of [[blues]], [[jazz]], and [[country music]], and their live shows featured [[jam band]]-style [[improvisation]] and [[instrumental]]s.\n\nThe group's first two studio releases, ''[[The Allman Brothers Band (album)|The Allman Brothers Band]]'' (1969) and ''[[Idlewild South]]'' (1970) (both released by Capricorn Records), stalled commercially, but their 1971 live release, ''[[At Fillmore East]]'', represented an artistic and commercial breakthrough. The album features extended renderings of their songs \"[[In Memory of Elizabeth Reed]]\" and \"[[Whipping Post (song)|Whipping Post]]\", and is considered among the best [[live album]]s ever made.\n\nGroup leader Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident later that year \u2013 on October 29, 1971 \u2013 and the band dedicated ''[[Eat a Peach]]'' (1972) to his memory, a dual studio/live album that cemented the band's popularity and featured Gregg Allman's \"[[Melissa (song)|Melissa]]\" and [[Dickey Betts]]'s \"[[Blue Sky (song)|Blue Sky]]\". Following the motorcycling death of bassist Berry Oakley exactly one year and 13 days later on November 11, 1972, the group recruited keyboardist [[Chuck Leavell]] and bassist [[Lamar Williams]] for 1973's ''[[Brothers and Sisters (album)|Brothers and Sisters]].'' This album included Betts's [[hit single]] \"[[Ramblin' Man (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Ramblin' Man]]\" and instrumental \"[[Jessica (instrumental)|Jessica]]\". These tunes went on to become [[classic rock]] radio staples, and placed the group at the forefront of 1970s rock music. Internal turmoil overtook them soon after; the group dissolved in 1976, reformed briefly at the end of the decade with additional personnel changes, and dissolved again in 1982.\n\nThe band reformed once more in 1989, releasing a string of new albums and touring heavily. A series of personnel changes in the late 1990s was capped by the departure of Betts. The group found stability during the 2000s with bassist [[Oteil Burbridge]] and guitarists [[Warren Haynes]] and [[Derek Trucks]] (the nephew of their original drummer) and became renowned for their month-long string of shows at New York City's [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]] each spring. The band retired for good in October 2014 after their final show at the Beacon Theatre.\n\nButch Trucks died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on January 24, 2017, in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]], at the age of 69. Gregg Allman died from complications arising from liver cancer on May 27, 2017, at his home in Savannah, Georgia, also at the age of 69.

Gregg was first to pick up the guitar, but his brother soon surpassed him, dropping out of high school to practice constantly.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=10}} The duo formed their first band, the Escorts, which evolved into the [[Allman Joys]] in the mid-1960s.<ref name=\"AM\"/>{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=18}} By 1967, the group spent time in [[St. Louis]], where a [[Los Angeles]]-based recording executive discovered them; they consequently moved out West and were renamed the [[Hour Glass (band)|Hour Glass]], cutting two unsuccessful albums for [[Liberty Records]].<ref name=\"AM\"/>{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=46}} Duane moved back to pursue a career as a session musician in [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]], while Gregg stayed behind in [[Hollywood]] bound by contractual obligations with Liberty, who believed he could hold a solo career.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=90}} The two were apart for the first time for a year, but managed to reconvene in [[Miami]], producing an album-length demo with [[the 31st of February]], a group that included drummer Butch Trucks.{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=99}}\n\nAt [[FAME Studios]] in Muscle Shoals, Duane Allman became the primary session guitarist, recording with artists such as [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[King Curtis]].<ref name=\"AM\"/>{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=6}} Duane suggested to [[Wilson Pickett]] they record a cover of \"[[Hey Jude]]\" by [[the Beatles]]; the single went to number 23 on the national charts.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=88}} FAME signed Duane to a five-year recording contract, and he put together a group, including Johnny Sandlin and Paul Hornsby. Duane recruited [[Jaimoe|Jai Johanny Johanson]] (Jaimoe) after hearing his drumming on a songwriting demo of Jackie Avery, and the two moved into his home on the [[Tennessee River]]. Allman invited bassist [[Berry Oakley]] to jam with the new group; the pair had met in a [[Macon, Georgia]] club some time earlier, and became quick friends.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=15}} The group had immediate chemistry, and Duane's vision for a \"different\" band \u2014 one with two lead guitarists and two drummers \u2014 began evolving.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=15}} Meanwhile, [[Phil Walden]], the manager of the late [[Otis Redding]] and several other R&B acts, was looking to expand into rock acts.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=9}} FAME owner [[Rick Hall]] became frustrated with the group's recording methods, and offered the tracks recorded and their contract to Walden and [[Jerry Wexler]] of [[Atlantic Records]], who purchased them for $10,000.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=110}} Walden intended the upcoming group to be the centerpiece of his new Atlantic-distributed label, [[Capricorn Records|Capricorn]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=13}}\n\nDuane and Jaimoe moved to Jacksonville in early March 1969, as Duane had become frustrated with being a \"robot\" of those at FAME.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=27}} He invited anyone who wanted to join to the [[jam sessions]] that birthed the Allman Brothers Band. [[Dickey Betts]], leader of Oakley's previous band, the Second Coming, became the group's second lead guitarist, while Butch Trucks, with whom Duane and Gregg had cut a demo less than a year prior, became the new group's second drummer.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=17}} The Second Coming's [[Reese Wynans]] played keyboards, and Duane, Oakley, and Betts all shared vocal duties.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=17}} The unnamed group began to perform free shows in Willow Branch Park in Jacksonville, with an ever-changing, rotating cast of musicians.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=24}} Duane felt strongly his brother should be the vocalist of the new group (which effectively eliminated Wynans's position, as Gregg also played keyboards).{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=25}} Gregg left Los Angeles and entered rehearsal on March 26, 1969, when the group was rehearsing [[Muddy Waters]]' \"[[Trouble No More (song)|Trouble No More]]\"{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=28}} Although Gregg was initially intimidated by the musicians, Duane pressured his brother into \"singing [his] guts out.\"{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=29}} Four days later, the group made their debut at the Jacksonville Armory.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=29}} Although many names were kicked around, including [[Beelzebub]], the six-piece eventually decided on the Allman Brothers Band.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=109}}\n\n===Debut and early years (1969\u20131970)===\nThe group moved to [[Macon, Georgia]] by May 1, where Walden was establishing Capricorn Records.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=32}} Mike Callahan and [[Joseph L. Campbell|Joseph \"Red Dog\" Campbell]] became the band's early crew members. \"Red Dog\" was a disabled [[Vietnam War|Vietnam veteran]] who donated his monthly disability checks to the band's cause.{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=118}}{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=30}} In Macon, the group stayed at friend Twiggs Lyndon's apartment on 309 College Street, which became known as the communal home of the band and crew, nicknamed the Hippie Crash Pad.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=33}}  \"There were five or six occupied apartments in the building with the Hippie Crash Pad and you would expect they would call the police on us because we were constantly raising hell at three or four in the morning, but they all just moved out,\" said Trucks.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=39}}  Living meagerly, they found a friend in \"Mama Louise\" Hudson, cook and proprietor of the H&H Soul Food Restaurant, who ran a tab when they were short of funds,{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=36}} early on made good with proceeds from Duane's recording sessions on the side.

The band incorporated elements of [[blues]], [[jazz]], and [[country music]], and their live shows featured [[jam band]]-style [[improvisation]] and [[instrumental]]s.\n\nThe group's first two studio releases, ''[[The Allman Brothers Band (album)|The Allman Brothers Band]]'' (1969) and ''[[Idlewild South]]'' (1970) (both released by Capricorn Records), stalled commercially, but their 1971 live release, ''[[At Fillmore East]]'', represented an artistic and commercial breakthrough. The album features extended renderings of their songs \"[[In Memory of Elizabeth Reed]]\" and \"[[Whipping Post (song)|Whipping Post]]\", and is considered among the best [[live album]]s ever made.\n\nGroup leader Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident later that year \u2013 on October 29, 1971 \u2013 and the band dedicated ''[[Eat a Peach]]'' (1972) to his memory, a dual studio/live album that cemented the band's popularity and featured Gregg Allman's \"[[Melissa (song)|Melissa]]\" and [[Dickey Betts]]'s \"[[Blue Sky (song)|Blue Sky]]\". Following the motorcycling death of bassist Berry Oakley exactly one year and 13 days later on November 11, 1972, the group recruited keyboardist [[Chuck Leavell]] and bassist [[Lamar Williams]] for 1973's ''[[Brothers and Sisters (album)|Brothers and Sisters]].'' This album included Betts's [[hit single]] \"[[Ramblin' Man (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Ramblin' Man]]\" and instrumental \"[[Jessica (instrumental)|Jessica]]\". These tunes went on to become [[classic rock]] radio staples, and placed the group at the forefront of 1970s rock music. Internal turmoil overtook them soon after; the group dissolved in 1976, reformed briefly at the end of the decade with additional personnel changes, and dissolved again in 1982.\n\nThe band reformed once more in 1989, releasing a string of new albums and touring heavily. A series of personnel changes in the late 1990s was capped by the departure of Betts. The group found stability during the 2000s with bassist [[Oteil Burbridge]] and guitarists [[Warren Haynes]] and [[Derek Trucks]] (the nephew of their original drummer) and became renowned for their month-long string of shows at New York City's [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]] each spring. The band retired for good in October 2014 after their final show at the Beacon Theatre.\n\nButch Trucks died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on January 24, 2017, in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]], at the age of 69. Gregg Allman died from complications arising from liver cancer on May 27, 2017, at his home in Savannah, Georgia, also at the age of 69.

Gregg was first to pick up the guitar, but his brother soon surpassed him, dropping out of high school to practice constantly.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=10}} The duo formed their first band, the Escorts, which evolved into the [[Allman Joys]] in the mid-1960s.<ref name=\"AM\"/>{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=18}} By 1967, the group spent time in [[St. Louis]], where a [[Los Angeles]]-based recording executive discovered them; they consequently moved out West and were renamed the [[Hour Glass (band)|Hour Glass]], cutting two unsuccessful albums for [[Liberty Records]].<ref name=\"AM\"/>{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=46}} Duane moved back to pursue a career as a session musician in [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]], while Gregg stayed behind in [[Hollywood]] bound by contractual obligations with Liberty, who believed he could hold a solo career.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=90}} The two were apart for the first time for a year, but managed to reconvene in [[Miami]], producing an album-length demo with [[the 31st of February]], a group that included drummer Butch Trucks.{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=99}}\n\nAt [[FAME Studios]] in Muscle Shoals, Duane Allman became the primary session guitarist, recording with artists such as [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[King Curtis]].<ref name=\"AM\"/>{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=6}} Duane suggested to [[Wilson Pickett]] they record a cover of \"[[Hey Jude]]\" by [[the Beatles]]; the single went to number 23 on the national charts.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=88}} FAME signed Duane to a five-year recording contract, and he put together a group, including Johnny Sandlin and Paul Hornsby. Duane recruited [[Jaimoe|Jai Johanny Johanson]] (Jaimoe) after hearing his drumming on a songwriting demo of Jackie Avery, and the two moved into his home on the [[Tennessee River]]. Allman invited bassist [[Berry Oakley]] to jam with the new group; the pair had met in a [[Macon, Georgia]] club some time earlier, and became quick friends.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=15}} The group had immediate chemistry, and Duane's vision for a \"different\" band \u2014 one with two lead guitarists and two drummers \u2014 began evolving.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=15}} Meanwhile, [[Phil Walden]], the manager of the late [[Otis Redding]] and several other R&B acts, was looking to expand into rock acts.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=9}} FAME owner [[Rick Hall]] became frustrated with the group's recording methods, and offered the tracks recorded and their contract to Walden and [[Jerry Wexler]] of [[Atlantic Records]], who purchased them for $10,000.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=110}} Walden intended the upcoming group to be the centerpiece of his new Atlantic-distributed label, [[Capricorn Records|Capricorn]].{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=13}}\n\nDuane and Jaimoe moved to Jacksonville in early March 1969, as Duane had become frustrated with being a \"robot\" of those at FAME.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=27}} He invited anyone who wanted to join to the [[jam sessions]] that birthed the Allman Brothers Band. [[Dickey Betts]], leader of Oakley's previous band, the Second Coming, became the group's second lead guitarist, while Butch Trucks, with whom Duane and Gregg had cut a demo less than a year prior, became the new group's second drummer.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=17}} The Second Coming's [[Reese Wynans]] played keyboards, and Duane, Oakley, and Betts all shared vocal duties.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=17}} The unnamed group began to perform free shows in Willow Branch Park in Jacksonville, with an ever-changing, rotating cast of musicians.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=24}} Duane felt strongly his brother should be the vocalist of the new group (which effectively eliminated Wynans's position, as Gregg also played keyboards).{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=25}} Gregg left Los Angeles and entered rehearsal on March 26, 1969, when the group was rehearsing [[Muddy Waters]]' \"[[Trouble No More (song)|Trouble No More]]\"{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=28}} Although Gregg was initially intimidated by the musicians, Duane pressured his brother into \"singing [his] guts out.\"{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=29}} Four days later, the group made their debut at the Jacksonville Armory.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=29}} Although many names were kicked around, including [[Beelzebub]], the six-piece eventually decided on the Allman Brothers Band.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=109}}\n\n===Debut and early years (1969\u20131970)===\nThe group moved to [[Macon, Georgia]] by May 1, where Walden was establishing Capricorn Records.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=32}} Mike Callahan and [[Joseph L. Campbell|Joseph \"Red Dog\" Campbell]] became the band's early crew members. \"Red Dog\" was a disabled [[Vietnam War|Vietnam veteran]] who donated his monthly disability checks to the band's cause.{{sfn|Allman|Light|2012|p=118}}{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=30}} In Macon, the group stayed at friend Twiggs Lyndon's apartment on 309 College Street, which became known as the communal home of the band and crew, nicknamed the Hippie Crash Pad.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=33}}  \"There were five or six occupied apartments in the building with the Hippie Crash Pad and you would expect they would call the police on us because we were constantly raising hell at three or four in the morning, but they all just moved out,\" said Trucks.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=39}}  Living meagerly, they found a friend in \"Mama Louise\" Hudson, cook and proprietor of the H&H Soul Food Restaurant, who ran a tab when they were short of funds,{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=36}} early on made good with proceeds from Duane's recording sessions on the side.

IPGs are the acrylamide gel matrix co-polymerized with the pH gradient, which result in completely stable gradients except the most alkaline (>12) pH values. The immobilized pH gradient is obtained by the continuous change in the ratio of ''immobilines''. An immobiline is a weak acid or base defined by its pK value.\n\nA protein that is in a pH region below its [[isoelectric point]] (pI) will be positively charged and so will migrate toward the cathode (negatively charged electrode). As it migrates through a gradient of increasing pH, however, the protein's overall charge will decrease until the protein reaches the pH region that corresponds to its pI. At this point it has no net charge and so migration ceases (as there is no electrical attraction toward either electrode).  As a result, the proteins become focused into sharp stationary bands with each protein positioned at a point in the pH gradient corresponding to its pI. The technique is capable of extremely high resolution with proteins differing by a single charge being fractionated into separate bands.\n\nMolecules to be focused are distributed over a medium that has a pH gradient (usually created by [[aliphatic]] [[ampholyte]]s). An [[electric current]] is passed through the medium, creating a \"positive\" [[anode]] and \"negative\" [[cathode]] end. Negatively charged molecules migrate through the pH gradient in the medium toward the \"positive\" end while positively charged molecules move toward the \"negative\" end. As a particle moves toward the pole opposite of its charge it moves through the changing pH gradient until it reaches a point in which the pH of that molecules isoelectric point is reached.  At this point the molecule no longer has a net electric charge (due to the protonation or deprotonation of the associated functional groups) and as such will not proceed any further within the gel. The gradient is established before adding the particles of interest by first subjecting a solution of small molecules such as [[ampholyte|polyampholyte]]s with varying pI values to electrophoresis.\n\nThe method is applied particularly often in the study of [[protein]]s, which separate based on their relative content of [[acidic]] and [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] [[Amino acid|residues]], whose value is represented by the pI. Proteins are introduced into an [[Immobilized pH gradient]] gel composed of [[polyacrylamide]], [[starch]], or [[agarose]] where a pH gradient has been established. Gels with large pores are usually used in this process to eliminate any \"sieving\" effects, or artifacts in the pI caused by differing migration rates for proteins of differing sizes. Isoelectric focusing can resolve proteins that differ in [[Isoelectric point|pI]] value by as little as 0.01.<ref>Stryer, Lubert: \"Biochemie\", page 50.
