However, Rogers also competes nationally with [[Telus]] for wireless services, and primarily indirectly with [[Shaw Communications]] for [[multichannel television in Canada|television service]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1925, Edward Rogers Sr. invented the world's first [[alternating current]] (AC) heater filament cathode for a [[radio tube]], which then enabled radios to be powered by ordinary transformer-coupled household electric current. This was a breakthrough in the technology and became a key factor in popularizing [[radio]] reception. In 1931, Rogers Sr. was awarded an experimental television licence in Canada. He was working on radar when, on May 6, 1939, he died suddenly due to complications of a hemorrhage. He was 38 years old. He left a widow, Velma, and a five-year-old son, Edward (known as Ted Rogers). While his business interests were sold, his son later determined to carry on his father's business.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIn 1959, [[Edward S.

In 1960, it bought [[CHFI-FM|CHFI]] FM, and then in 1961, established [[CFTO]], Toronto's first private television station in 1961.  In 1964, it established [[CFTR]], an AM radio station.  In 1967, it established Rogers Cable TV in partnership with BARB.  In 1971, new [[CRTC]] regulations forced BARB to sell its 50% stake in Rogers Cable.  In 1979, Rogers acquired Canadian Cablesystems, and became listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange as a result.  In 1980, Rogers acquired Premier Cablevision becoming the largest cable company in Canada.  In 1986, Rogers Cable was renamed Rogers Communications, and established operational control over [[Rogers Wireless|Cantel]], a wireless telephone company in which Rogers had a stake.\n\n===2000s and 2010s===\n[[File:Rogers logo old.svg|thumb|left|200px|Rogers logo used from 2000-2015.

The present enterprise dates to 1959, when Rogers' son, [[Edward Samuel Rogers|Ted Rogers]], founded [[Baton Aldred Rogers Broadcasting]]. That company acquired [[CHFI-FM|CHFI]] in 1960,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://your.rogers.com/aboutrogers/historyofrogers/overview.asp |title=History of Rogers |publisher=Rogers Communications |access-date=2012-05-31|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202060352/http://your.rogers.com/aboutrogers/historyofrogers/overview.asp|archive-date=2008-02-02}}</ref> and launched [[CFTO-DT|CFTO]] in 1961.\n\nThe chief competitor to the company is [[Bell Canada]], which has a similarly extensive portfolio of radio and television media assets, as well as wireless, television distribution, and telephone services, particularly in Eastern and Central Canada; the two companies are often seen as having a [[duopoly]] on communications services in their regions as both companies own a stake of [[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment]]. However, the company also competes nationally with [[Telus]] for wireless services, and primarily indirectly with [[Shaw Communications]] for [[multichannel television in Canada|television service]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1925, Rogers Sr. invented the world's first [[alternating current]] (AC) heater filament cathode for a [[radio tube]], which then enabled radios to be powered by ordinary transformer-coupled household electric current. This was a breakthrough in the technology and became a key factor in popularizing [[radio]] reception. In 1931, Rogers Sr. was awarded an experimental television licence in Canada. He was working on radar when, on May 6, 1939 he died suddenly due to complications of a hemorrhage. He was 38 years old. He left a widow, Velma, and a five-year-old son, Edward (Ted Rogers). While his business interests were sold, his son later determined to carry on his father's business.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIn 1959, [[Edward S. Rogers Jr.]] and Joel Aldred received funding from [[John Bassett]] to found Baton Aldred Rogers Broadcasting (BARB).  In 1960, it bought [[CHFI-FM|CHFI]] FM, and then in 1961, established [[CFTO]], Toronto's first private television station in 1961.  In 1964, it established [[CFTR]], an AM radio station.  In 1967, it established Rogers Cable TV in partnership with BARB.  In 1971, new [[CRTC]] regulations forced BARB to sell its 50% stake in Rogers Cable.  In 1979, Rogers acquired Canadian Cablesystems, and became listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange as a result.  In 1980, Rogers acquired Premier Cablevision becoming the largest cable company in Canada.  In 1986, Rogers Cable was renamed Rogers Communications, and established operational control over [[Rogers Wireless|Cantel]], a wireless telephone company in which Rogers had a stake.\n\n===2000s and 2010s===\n[[File:Rogers logo old.svg|thumb|left|200px|Rogers logo used from 2000-2015.
