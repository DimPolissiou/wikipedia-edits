The [[wire]]s run vertically and are bent into a zig-zag pattern so that each \"zig\" hooks with the wire immediately on one side and each \"zag\" with the wire immediately on the other.  This forms the characteristic [[Polyiamond|diamond]] pattern seen in this type of fence.\n\n==Development of chain-link fencing==\n[[File:Chain-link and barbed wire.jpg|thumb|right|A chain-link privacy fence topped with [[barbed tape|razor wire]] protecting a utility power substation.]]\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the firm of [[Barnard, Bishop & Barnard]] was established in [[Norwich]] to produce chain-link fencing by machine. The process was developed by Charles Barnard in 1844 based on cloth weaving machines (up until that time Norwich had a long history of cloth manufacture).<ref>Ward, Ken.

A History of Norwich, 28 November 2006, p. 6.</ref>\n\nThe Anchor Post Fence Co., established in 1891, bought the rights to the wire-weaving machine and was the first company to manufacture chain-link fencing in the United States. Anchor Fence also holds the first United States patent for chain-link. The machine was purchased from a man in 1845 from Belgium who originally invented the wire bending machine.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for this sentence which conflicts with the previous information|date=March 2017}}\n\n==Sizes and uses==\nIn the [[United States]], fencing usually comes in 20&nbsp;ft and 50&nbsp;ft rolls, which can be joined by \"unscrewing\" one of the end wires and then \"screwing\" it back in so that it hooks both pieces. Common heights include 3&nbsp;ft, 3&nbsp;ft 6 in, 4&nbsp;ft, 5&nbsp;ft, 6&nbsp;ft, 7&nbsp;ft, 8&nbsp;ft, 10&nbsp;ft, and 12&nbsp;ft, though almost any height is possible. Common mesh gauges are 9, 11, and 11.5. Mesh length can also vary based on need, with the standard diamond size being 2\". For tennis courts and ball parks, the most popular height is 10&nbsp;or 12 feet, and tennis courts use a diamond size of 1.75\" <ref>Long Fence {{cite web |url=http://www.longfence.com/commercial/fence/chain-link |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411062526/http://www.longfence.com/commercial/fence/chain-link |archivedate=2013-04-11 }}</ref> measured flat side to flat side.  Tennis courts often use this smaller diamond size so that power hitters won't be able to lodge the ball into a larger diamond size.\n\nThe popularity of chain-link fence is from its relatively low cost and that the open weave does not obscure sunlight from either side of the fence. One can make a chain-link fence semi-opaque by [[fence insert|inserting slats]] into the mesh.  Allowing ivy to grow and interweave itself is also popular.\n\n==Installation==\n\nThe installation of chain-link fence involves setting posts into the ground and attaching the fence to them.  The posts may be steel tubing, timber or concrete and may be driven into the ground or set in concrete.  End, corner or gate posts, commonly referred to as \"terminal posts\", must be set in concrete footing or otherwise anchored to prevent leaning under the tension of a stretched fence.  Posts set between the terminal posts are called \"line posts\" and are set at intervals not to exceed 10 feet. The installer attaches the fence at one end, stretches it, and attaches at the other, easily removing the excess by \"unscrewing\" a wire.  Finally, the installer ties the fence to the line posts with aluminum wire.  In many cases, the installer stretches a bottom tension wire, sometimes referred to as \"coil wire\", between terminal posts to help minimize the in and out movement that occurs at the bottom of the chain-link mesh between posts.  Top horizontal rails are used on most chain-link fences, although not necessary.  Bottom rails may be added in lieu of bottom tension wires, and for taller fences, 10 feet or more, intermediate horizontal rails are often added.\n\nOnce stretched, a bottom wire should be secured to the line posts and the chain-link mesh \"hog ringed\" to the tension wire 2' on center.  One generally installs this wire before installing the chain-link mesh.\n\n==Manufacturing==\nThe manufacturing of chain-link fencing is called [[weaving]]. A metal [[wire]], often [[Galvanized steel|galvanized]] to reduce [[corrosion]], is pulled along a rotating long and flat [[blade]], thus creating a somewhat flattened [[Helix|spiral]]. The spiral continues to rotate past the blade and winds its way through the previous spiral that is already part of the fence. When the spiral reaches the far end of the fence, the spiral is cut near the blade. Next, the spiral is pressed flat and the entire fence is moved up, ready for the next cycle. The end of every second spiral overlaps the end of every first spiral. The machine clamps both ends and gives them a few twists. This makes the links permanent.\n\nAn improved version of the weaving machine winds two wires around the blade at once to create a [[double helix]]. One of the spirals is woven through the last spiral that is already part of the fence. This improvement allows the process to advance twice as fast.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3LnjVXTfXc Chain link weaving machine - video]</ref>\n\n==Notable uses==\n[[File:DirtTrackRacingLateModels.jpg|thumb|right|Chain-link fencing at an American short track]]\n[[File:Kenny King vs. Zema Ion - Dark Match.jpg|thumb|right|Chain-link, steel cage as used in an [[Impact Wrestling]] professional wrestling match]]\n* Used to notable effect in the [[Gehry Residence]] by [[Frank Gehry]]\n* In [[Professional Wrestling]], several wrestling match variations require that chain-link fencing surround the ring in an open \"cage\" style.
