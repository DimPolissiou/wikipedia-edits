These are aggregations of [[efferent nerve fiber]]s from the [[upper motor neuron]]s that travel from the [[cerebral cortex]] and terminate either in the [[brainstem]] (''corticobulbar'') or [[spinal cord]] (''corticospinal'') and are involved in the control of motor functions of the body.\n\nThe corticobulbar tract conducts [[action potential|impulses]] from the [[brain]] to the [[cranial nerve]]s.<ref>Chapter 9 of \"Principles of Physiology\" (3rd edition) by Robert M. Berne and Mathew N. Levy. Published by Mosby, Inc. (2000) {{ISBN|0-323-00813-5}}.</ref> These nerves control the muscles of the face and neck and are involved in facial expression, mastication, swallowing, and other motor functions.\n\nThe [[corticospinal tract]] conducts impulses from the brain to the spinal cord. It is made up of a [[lateral corticospinal tract|lateral]] and [[anterior corticospinal tract|anterior tract]]. The corticospinal tract is involved in voluntary movement. The majority of fibres of the corticospinal tract [[medullary pyramids#Decussation|cross over]] in the [[medulla oblongata]], resulting in muscles being controlled by the opposite side of the brain. The corticospinal tract contains the [[axon]]s of the pyramidal cells, the largest of which are the Betz cells, located in the cerebral cortex. \n\nThe pyramidal tracts are named because they pass through the [[Pyramid (brainstem)|pyramids]] of the medulla oblongata. The corticospinal fibers when descending from the [[internal capsule]] to the brain stem, converge to a point from multiple directions giving the impression of an inverted pyramid.\n\nThe [[myelin]]ation of the pyramidal fibres is incomplete at birth and gradually progresses in cranio-caudal direction and thereby progressively [[Child development stages#Motor, speech, vision and hearing|gaining functionality]]. Most of the myelination is complete by two years of age and thereafter it progresses very slowly in cranio-caudal direction up to twelve years of age.\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:Bentralki (1).tif|thumb|upright=1.4|Pyramidal tracts]]\nThe term ''pyramidal tracts'' refers to [[upper motor neuron]]s that originate in the [[cerebral cortex]] and terminate in the [[spinal cord]] (''corticospinal'') or [[brainstem]] (''corticobulbar''). Nerves emerge in the [[cerebral cortex]], pass down and may [[decussation|cross sides]] in the [[medulla oblongata]], and travel as part of the [[spinal cord]] until they [[synapse]] with [[interneuron]]s in the [[grey column]] of the spinal cord.<ref name=GUYTONHALL2005>{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Arthur C.

The ''pyramidal tracts'' definitively encompass the [[corticospinal tract]]s, and many authors also include the [[corticobulbar tract]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Anthoney|first1=Terence R.|title=Neuroanatomy and the neurologic exam : a thesaurus of synonyms, similar-sounding non-synonyms, and terms of variable meaning|date=1994|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|isbn=9780849386312|pages=458\u2013460|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=whrU2XEvGFIC&pg=PA458&dq=corticobulbar+is+a+pyramidal+tract#v=onepage&q=corticobulbar%20is%20a%20pyramidal%20tract&f=false|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503163021/https://books.google.com/books?id=whrU2XEvGFIC&pg=PA458&dq=corticobulbar+is+a+pyramidal+tract#v=onepage&q=corticobulbar%20is%20a%20pyramidal%20tract&f=false|archivedate=2018-05-03}}</ref>\n\n===Corticospinal tract===\n{{Further|Corticospinal tract}}\nNerve fibres in the corticospinal tract originate from [[pyramidal cells]] in layer V of the [[cerebral cortex]]. Fibres arise from the [[primary motor cortex]] (about 30%), [[supplementary motor area]] and the [[premotor cortex]] (together also about 30%), and the [[somatosensory cortex]], [[parietal lobe]], and [[cingulate gyrus]] supplies the rest.<ref name=GUYTONHALL2005 /> The cells have their [[soma (biology)|bodies]] in the cerebral cortex, and the [[axon]]s form the bulk of the pyramidal tracts.<ref name=HARRISONS2008 />  The nerve axons travel from the cortex through the [[posterior limb of internal capsule]], through the [[cerebral peduncle]] and into the [[brainstem]] and anterior [[medulla oblongata]]. Here they form two prominences called the [[medullary pyramids (brainstem)|medulla oblongatary pyramids]]. Below the prominences, the majority of axons cross over to the opposite side from which they originated, known as [[Medullary pyramids (brainstem)#Decussation|decussation]]. The axons that cross over move to the outer part of the medulla oblongata and form the [[lateral corticospinal tract]], whereas the fibres that remain form the [[anterior corticospinal tract]].<ref name=GUYTONHALL2005 />  About 80% of axons cross over and form the lateral corticospinal tract; 10% do not cross over and join the tract, and 10% of fibres travel in the anterior corticospinal tract. {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe nerve axons traveling down the tract are the [[efferent nerve fiber]]s of the [[upper motor neuron]]s. These axons travel down the tracts in the [[white matter]] of the spinal cord until they reach the [[vertebra]]l level of the muscle that they will innervate.<ref name=Arslan2001/> At this point, the axons [[synapse]] with [[lower motor neuron]]s. The majority of axons do not directly synapse with lower motor neurons, but instead synapse with an [[interneuron]] that then synapses with a lower motor neuron. This generally occurs in the [[anterior grey column]].<ref name=GUYTONHALL2005 /> Nerve axons of the lateral corticospinal tract that did not cross over in the medulla oblongata do so at the level of the spinal cord they terminate in.<ref name=YOUNG2007 />\n\nThese tracts contain more than 1 million axons and the majority of the axons are myelinated. The corticospinal tracts myelinate largely during the first and second years after birth. The majority of nerve axons are small (<4\u03bcm) in diameter. About 3% of nerve axons have a much larger diameter (16\u03bcm) and arise from [[Betz cell]]s, mostly in the leg area of the primary motor cortex. These cells are notable because of their rapid conduction rate, over 70m/sec, the fastest conduction of any signals from the brain to the spinal cord.<ref name=GUYTONHALL2005 />\n\n[[File:Lower pons horizontal KB.svg|thumb|right|Horizontal section through the lower part of the pons, showing the fibers of the corticospinal tract (#19) passing through the pontine nuclei]]\n\n===Corticobulbar tract===\n{{Further|Corticobulbar tract}}\nFibres from the [[:wikt:ventral|ventral]] [[motor cortex]] travel with the corticospinal tract through the internal capsule, but terminate in a number of locations in the [[midbrain]] ([[cortico-mesencephalic tract]]), [[pons]] ([[Corticopontine tract]]), and [[medulla oblongata]] ([[cortico-bulbar tract]]).<ref name=YOUNG2007>{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=Paul A.|title=Basic clinical neuroscience|date=2007|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=9780781753197|pages=69\u201370|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dCh_gIIUnEoC&pg=PA69&dq=corticobulbar+is+a+pyramidal+tract#v=onepage&q=corticobulbar%20is%20a%20pyramidal%20tract&f=false|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313215307/https://books.google.com/books?id=dCh_gIIUnEoC&pg=PA69&dq=corticobulbar+is+a+pyramidal+tract#v=onepage&q=corticobulbar%20is%20a%20pyramidal%20tract&f=false|archivedate=2017-03-13}}</ref>  The [[upper motor neuron]]s of the corticobulbar tract synapse with interneurons or directly with the lower motor neurons located in the motor [[cranial nerve nuclei]], namely [[oculomotor]], [[trochlear motor neuron|trochlear]], motor nucleus of the [[trigeminal nerve]], [[abducens]], [[facial nerve]] and [[Accessory nerve|accessory]] and in the [[nucleus ambiguus]] to the [[hypoglossal]], [[vagus nerve|vagus]] and [[accessory nerve]]s.<ref name=YOUNG2007 />  These nuclei are supplied by nerves from both sides of the brain, with the exception of the parts of the facial nerve that control muscles of the lower face.

These are aggregations of [[efferent nerve fiber]]s from the [[upper motor neuron]]s that travel from the [[cerebral cortex]] and terminate either in the [[brainstem]] (''corticobulbar'') or [[spinal cord]] (''corticospinal'') and are involved in the control of motor functions of the body.\n\nThe corticobulbar tract conducts [[action potential|impulses]] from the [[brain]] to the [[cranial nerve]]s.<ref>Chapter 9 of \"Principles of Physiology\" (3rd edition) by Robert M.

(2000) {{ISBN|0-323-00813-5}}.</ref> These nerves control the muscles of the face and neck and are involved in facial expression, mastication, swallowing, and other functions.\n\nThe [[corticospinal tract]] conducts impulses from the brain to the spinal cord. It is made up of a [[lateral corticospinal tract|lateral]] and [[anterior corticospinal tract|anterior tract]]. The corticospinal tract is involved in voluntary movement. The majority of fibres of the corticospinal tract [[medullary pyramids#Decussation|cross over]] in the [[medulla oblongata]], resulting in muscles being controlled by the opposite side of the brain. The corticospinal tract also contains the [[axon]]s of [[Betz cell]]s (the largest [[pyramidal cell]]s) located in the [[primary motor cortex]].\n\nThe pyramidal tracts are named because they pass through the [[Pyramid (brainstem)|pyramids]] of the medulla oblongata. The corticospinal fibers when descending from the [[internal capsule]] to the brain stem, converge to a point from multiple directions giving the impression of an inverted pyramid.\n\nThe [[myelin]]ation of the pyramidal fibres is incomplete at birth and gradually progresses in cranio-caudal direction and thereby progressively [[Child development stages#Motor, speech, vision and hearing|gaining functionality]]. Most of the myelination is complete by two years of age and thereafter it progresses very slowly in cranio-caudal direction up to twelve years of age.\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:Bentralki (1).tif|thumb|upright=1.4|Pyramidal tracts]]\nThe term ''pyramidal tracts'' refers to [[upper motor neuron]]s that originate in the [[cerebral cortex]] and terminate in the [[spinal cord]] (''corticospinal'') or [[brainstem]] (''corticobulbar'').

Fibres arise from the [[primary motor cortex]] (about 30%), [[supplementary motor area]] and the [[premotor cortex]] (together also about 30%), and the [[somatosensory cortex]], [[parietal lobe]], and [[cingulate gyrus]] supplies the rest.<ref name=GUYTONHALL2005 /> The cells have their [[soma (biology)|bodies]] in the cerebral cortex, and the [[axon]]s form the bulk of the pyramidal tracts.<ref name=HARRISONS2008 />  The nerve axons travel from the cortex through the [[posterior limb of internal capsule]], through the [[cerebral peduncle]] and into the [[brainstem]] and anterior [[medulla oblongata]]. Here they form two prominences called the [[medullary pyramids (brainstem)|medulla oblongatary pyramids]]. Below the prominences, the majority of axons cross over to the opposite side from which they originated, known as [[Medullary pyramids (brainstem)#Decussation|decussation]]. The axons that cross over move to the outer part of the medulla oblongata and form the [[lateral corticospinal tract]], whereas the fibres that remain form the [[anterior corticospinal tract]].<ref name=GUYTONHALL2005 />  About 80% of axons cross over and form the lateral corticospinal tract; 10% do not cross over and join the tract, and 10% of fibres travel in the anterior corticospinal tract. {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe nerve axons traveling down the tract are the [[efferent nerve fiber]]s of the [[upper motor neuron]]s. These axons travel down the tracts in the [[white matter]] of the spinal cord until they reach the [[vertebra]]l level of the muscle that they will innervate.<ref name=Arslan2001/> At this point, the axons [[synapse]] with [[lower motor neuron]]s. The majority of axons do not directly synapse with lower motor neurons, but instead synapse with an [[interneuron]] that then synapses with a lower motor neuron. This generally occurs in the [[anterior grey column]].<ref name=GUYTONHALL2005 /> Nerve axons of the lateral corticospinal tract that did not cross over in the medulla oblongata do so at the level of the spinal cord they terminate in.<ref name=YOUNG2007 />\n\nThese tracts contain more than 1 million axons and the majority of the axons are myelinated. The corticospinal tracts myelinate largely during the first and second years after birth. The majority of nerve axons are small (<4\u03bcm) in diameter. About 3% of nerve axons have a much larger diameter (16\u03bcm) and arise from [[Betz cell]]s, mostly in the leg area of the primary motor cortex. These cells are notable because of their rapid conduction rate, over 70m/sec, the fastest conduction of any signals from the brain to the spinal cord.<ref name=GUYTONHALL2005 />\n\n[[File:Lower pons horizontal KB.svg|thumb|right|Horizontal section through the lower part of the pons, showing the fibers of the corticospinal tract (#19) passing through the pontine nuclei]]\n\n===Corticobulbar tract===\n{{Further|Corticobulbar tract}}\nFibres from the [[:wikt:ventral|ventral]] [[motor cortex]] travel with the corticospinal tract through the internal capsule, but terminate in a number of locations in the [[midbrain]] ([[cortico-mesencephalic tract]]), [[pons]] ([[Corticopontine tract]]), and [[medulla oblongata]] ([[cortico-bulbar tract]]).<ref name=YOUNG2007>{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=Paul A.|title=Basic clinical neuroscience|date=2007|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=9780781753197|pages=69\u201370|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dCh_gIIUnEoC&pg=PA69&dq=corticobulbar+is+a+pyramidal+tract#v=onepage&q=corticobulbar%20is%20a%20pyramidal%20tract&f=false|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313215307/https://books.google.com/books?id=dCh_gIIUnEoC&pg=PA69&dq=corticobulbar+is+a+pyramidal+tract#v=onepage&q=corticobulbar%20is%20a%20pyramidal%20tract&f=false|archivedate=2017-03-13}}</ref>  The [[upper motor neuron]]s of the corticobulbar tract synapse with interneurons or directly with the lower motor neurons located in the motor [[cranial nerve nuclei]], namely [[oculomotor]], [[trochlear motor neuron|trochlear]], motor nucleus of the [[trigeminal nerve]], [[abducens]], [[facial nerve]] and [[Accessory nerve|accessory]] and in the [[nucleus ambiguus]] to the [[hypoglossal]], [[vagus nerve|vagus]] and [[accessory nerve]]s.<ref name=YOUNG2007 />  These nuclei are supplied by nerves from both sides of the brain, with the exception of the parts of the facial nerve that control muscles of the lower face.

While the voting rights for both chambers were the same, the elections to the Landsting was indirect, and the eligibility requirements harder. The constitution gave voting rights to 15% of the Danish population. Due to the First Schleswig war, the constitution was not put into force for Schleswig; instead this question was postponed to after the war.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/danmarks-riges-grundlov-af-5-juni-1849-junigrundloven/|title=Danmarks Riges Grundlov, 5. juni 1849 (Junigrundloven)|last=103982@au.dk|website=danmarkshistorien.dk|language=da|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref>\n\n=== Parallel constitution for the Unitary State (1855-1866) ===\nFollowing the First Schleswig war, which ended in Danish victory in 1852, the [[London Protocol (1852)|London Protocol]] reaffirmed the territorial integrity of the Unitary State, and solved an impending succession issue, since Frederick VII was childless.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/londontraktaten-8-maj-1852/|title=Londontraktaten, 8. maj 1852|last=103982@au.dk|website=danmarkshistorien.dk|language=da|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref> Since the June constitution was not put into force in Schleswig, the Schleswig-Holstein question remained unsolved.

This was shortly before [[Second Schleswig War|Second Schleswig war]], where Denmark lost control of Schleswig and Holstein, rendering the parallel constitution void.\n\n===The Revised Constitution (1866)===\n\n[[File:Danish Constitions in Folketinget 20090520.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Constitutions of Denmark located inside [[Folketinget]].]]In 1866, the defeat in the [[Second Schleswig War]], and the loss of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] led to tightened election rules for the Upper Chamber, which paralyzed legislative work, leading to provisional laws.\n\nThe conservative [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|H\u00f8jre]] had pressed for a new constitution, giving the upper chamber of parliament more power, making it more exclusive and switching power to the conservatives from the original long standing dominance of the [[National Liberal Party (Denmark)|National Liberals]], who lost influence and was later disbanded. This long period of dominance of the H\u00f8jre party under the leadership of [[Jacob Br\u00f8nnum Scavenius Estrup]] with the backing of the king [[Christian IX of Denmark]] was named the ''provisorietid'' (provisional period) because the government was based on provisional laws instead of parliamentary decisions. This also gave rise to a conflict with the Liberals (farm owners) at that time and now known as [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] (Left). This constitutional battle concluded in 1901 with the so-called systemskifte (change of system) with the liberals as victors. At this point the king and H\u00f8jre finally accepted [[parliamentarism]] as the ruling principle of Danish political life. This principle was not [[Codification (law)|codified]] until the 1953 constitution.\n\n=== Universal suffrage (1915) ===\nIn 1915, the tightening from 1866 was reversed, and women were given the right to vote. Also, a new requirement for changing the constitution was introduced. Not only must the new constitution be passed by two consecutive parliaments, it must also pass a referendum, where 45% of the electorate must vote yes. This meant that Prime Minister [[Thorvald Stauning]]'s attempt to change the Constitution in 1939 failed.<ref>S\u00f8ren M\u00f8rch: ''24 statsministre''. {{ISBN|87-02-00361-9}}.</ref>\n\n=== Reunion with Schleswig (1920) ===\n{{See also|1920 Schleswig plebiscites}}\nIn 1920, a [[1920 Danish constitutional referendum|new referendum]] was held to change the Constitution again, allowing for the reunification of Denmark following the defeat of Germany in [[World War I]]. This followed a [[referendum]] held in the former Danish territories of Schleswig-Holstein regarding how the new border should be placed. This resulted in upper Schleswig becoming Danish, today known as [[Southern Jutland]], and the rest remained German.\n\n=== Current Constitution (1953) ===\nIn 1953, the [[1953 Danish constitutional and electoral age referendum|fourth constitution]] abolished the Upper Chamber (the [[Landsting (Denmark)|Landsting]]), giving Denmark a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] parliament. It also enabled females to inherit the throne (see ''[[Danish monarchy#Succession|Succession]]''), but the change still favored boys over girls (this was changed by a [[2009 Danish Act of Succession referendum|referendum in 2009]] so the first-born inherits the throne regardless of sex). Finally, the required number of votes in favor of a change of the Constitution was decreased to the current value of 40% of the electorate.\n\nIn 2009, the [[Danish Act of Succession|Act of Succession]], which is referenced in the constitution and considered an integral part of it, was changed to  eliminate [[male-preference primogeniture]] in favour of [[absolute primogeniture]]. The changes was approved in a [[2009 Danish Act of Succession referendum|referendum]].\n\n== Summary of the constitution ==\nThe Danish constitution consists of 89 sections, structured into 11 chapters.

The throne is inherited according to the [[Danish Act of Succession|Act of Succession]], which itself has the same status as the constitution. The [[Church of Denmark]] is the state church. The constitution holds for the entire [[The unity of the Realm|Danish realm]].\n|-\n|2\n|The royal family\n|\u00a7\u00a7 5\u201311\n|There are a number of requirements that the [[Monarchy of Denmark|sovereign]] must live up to, most importantly they must belong to the [[evangelical Lutheran]] faith; in practice they have always have been members of the Church of Denmark. The [[age of majority]] for the sovereign is at 18 years, and the Folketing can make provisions if the sovereign in incapable, minor or abroad, and choose a new sovereign if there are no heirs to the throne. Royal expenses are financed through [[Annuity|annuities]] granted by the Folketing.\n|-\n|3\n|The government\n|\u00a7\u00a7 12\u201327\n|The sovereign,{{Efn|The constitution refers to the sovereign as the \"King\", even though it is currently [[Margrethe II of Denmark|a queen]]. As the queen executes her powers through the government, the use of \"King\" nearly always means the government.|name=|group=lower-alpha}} who formally holds executive power, always exercises this power through the ministers in the government, making the role of sovereign fully ceremonial. Denmark employs the principle of negative [[Parliamentary system|parliamentarianism]], namely that no minister can remain in their post, if a majority of the Folketing opposes them. In addition ministers can be trialed at the Court of [[Impeachment]] (\u00a7\u00a7 59-60) for their actions while in government. Government business are discussed in the Council of State or the Council of Ministers, who today have little importance. New laws must receive [[royal assent]] and be proclaimed; this happens in ''[[Lovtidende]]''. Pre-constitutional laws remain in effect.\n\nMinisters have the right to propose laws and decision (in case they are not members of the Folketing), and the government is allowed to pardon criminals and mint coins. Under exceptional circumstances, the government can enact temporary laws, which must be reaffirmed by the Folketing as quickly as possible. In foreign policy, important decisions are taken by the Foreign Policy Committee in the Folketing, including the ratification of treaties, and the initiation of offensive military operations. A certain type of civil servants, known in Danish as ''tjenestem\u00e6nd'' (lit. servicemen), have special privileges to prevent corruption.\n\n\u00a7 20 allows Denmark to hand over [[sovereignty]] to [[intergovernmental organization]]s, which is often a requirement for joining them. This needs a [[supermajority]] of 5/6 in the Folketing, or that it is approved in a referendum.\n|-\n|4\n|Elections to the Folketing\n|\u00a7\u00a7 28\u201334\n|The Folketing consists of up to 179 members,{{Efn|The constitution says \"not more than\" 179, but the Danish election law says that exactly 179 members are elected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=206576|title=LBK nr 137 af 07/02/2019|last=|first=|date=21 February 2019|website=Retsinformation|language=da|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=24 November 2019}}</ref>|name=|group=}} of which two are elected from [[Greenland]], and two from the [[Faroe Islands]]. Elections are held at least every 4 years, with the [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]] able to call a [[snap election]]. Elections are direct and secret, and the voting system shall ensure [[proportional representation]]. To vote you need to be a Danish citizen not under [[legal guardian]]ship, live in Denmark, and be above the voting age. The voting age was set to 23 years in a [[1953 Danish constitutional and electoral age referendum|1953 referendum]], but has since been lowered three times, and has been 18 years since 1978. Changes to the voting age require a referendum. All eligible to vote are eligible to run for a seat in the Folketing; however the Folketing can expel members who have been convicted of a crime, if they deem that they are \"unworthy\" of their seat. Acts against the security or freedom of the Folketing is high treason.\n|-\n|5\n|The Folketing\n|\u00a7\u00a7 35\u201358\n|The business year runs from the first Tuesday in October to the first Tuesday in October the next year. After a general election and at the beginning of a new business year, all unfinished business is dropped, and the Folketing starts anew. The Folketing elects a [[Speaker of the Folketing|speaker]] and vice chairmen, both after an election and at the beginning of each business year. A business year starts with an opening speech from the prime minister.\nThe Folketing meets where the government resides, which is in [[Christiansborg Palace]]. The speaker calls the meetings, and are obliged to do so on request from the prime minister or two-fifths of the Folketing. Meetings are public accessible; closed meetings can be held, but the last time this happened was in 1924, during a [[Erik the Red's Land|conflict with Norway over Greenland]]. A [[quorum]] consists of half of the members. Every member of the Folketing can propose laws and decisions, and only they (and ministers per \u00a7 21) can do that. All bills require three [[Reading (legislature)|readings]] before being passed into law. One-third of the Folketing can demand that an otherwise passed bill should be confirmed in a referendum, though some bills, among those fiscal bills, cannot be subject of a referendum.\n\nEach year, a finance bill, which defines the state budget, needs to be passed into law for the following fiscal year (which since 1979 has followed the calendar year). A provisional appropriations bill can be passed if the finance bill is not passed in time. A budget or a supplementary appropriation act is necessary to charge taxes and spend money, though in practice the Finance Committee have been allowed to approve extra expenditures, which are then spent before being passed into law. The public accounts shall be ready six months after the fiscal year, and are audited by the State Auditors, who are appointed by the Folketing.\n\nMembers of the Folketing receive a salary, and have absolute [[freedom of speech]] within the Folketing. In addition, they have [[parliamentary immunity]], except if caught in the act, though this immunity can be lifted by the Folketing. Members are not in any way bound by pledges or what [[Party discipline|their party says]], but free to vote in any way they wish. They can ask ministers questions, who are then obliged to answer.\n\nAppointments to parliamentary committees are done through proportional representation. The Folketing appoint one or two [[ombudsman|ombudsmen]]; the Folketing have decided to only appoint one. The Folketing can establish parliamentary commissions for investigations, though this have only happened five times; usually commissions led by a judge is used instead. All taxes, state loans, and military inscriptions must be set in laws. Foreigners can only be [[Danish nationality law|naturalized by law]], and only buy real-estate as permitted by law.\n|-\n|6\n|The courts\n|\u00a7\u00a7 59\u201365\n|The courts are independent of the government, though they are regulated by law. Establishing a new court to handle a specific case is not allowed. Judges answers to no-one, and in general cannot be fired or forcefully moved to a new position, unless due to a restructuring, or by verdict from other judges. Judges above 65 years can be fired, but will receive full pay until the mandatory retirement age, which is currently 70 years. It is possible to sue public agencies. The Folketing can establish special courts to handle such cases, and their verdicts can be appealed to the [[Supreme Court (Denmark)|Supreme Court]], though none have been established. Court proceedings must be as transparent as possible, and [[lay judge]]s must be used in criminal cases.\nThe special Court of Impeachment, which decides cases against ministers, consists of the 15 most senior Supreme Court judges and an equal amount appointed by the Folketing. The appointed judges cannot be members of the Folketing themselves, and sits for 6 years but remain on cases started before the end of their term. Cases are brought before the impeachment court by the government or the Folketing. Only five impeachment cases have been held; the latest was the 1993\u20131995 case against former [[Justice Minister (Denmark)|Minister of Justice]], [[Erik Ninn-Hansen]] regarding the [[Tamil Case (Denmark)|Tamil Case]].\n|-\n|7\n|Religion\n|\u00a7\u00a7 66\u201370\n|The Church of Denmark is the state church by \u00a7 4, and the Folketing can by statue decide its constitution, but has not done so. Denmark has [[freedom of religion]], and allows all to form and join religious communities, as long as they do not impinge on \"good morals or public order\". No-one is forced to pay to religions that are not their own, so the church tax is only paid by members of the Church of Denmark. Religious observance or race does not affect people's civic and political rights and duties.\n|-\n|8\n|Citizens' rights\n|\u00a7\u00a7 71\u201385\n|No citizen can be held in detention based on their race, religion or political views, and detention can only be used if prescribed by law. People arrested need to be put before a judge within 24 hours, known in Danish as a ''grundlovsforh\u00f8r'' (lit. constitutional interrogation), which decides if the [[Remand (detention)|provisional detention]] should be continued, and this decision can always be appealed. Special rules can apply in Greenland. Detention outside the criminal system or the immigration system, say due to [[Psychiatry|mental illness]], can be brought before the courts.\nA [[search warrant]] is needed to enter private property, confiscate things, or break the [[secrecy of correspondence]], though general exemptions can be made by law. [[Eminent domain|Expropriations]] must be for the public good, with full compensation, and as allowed by law. Bills regarding expropriations can by 1/3 of the Folketing be delayed until passed again after a general election. All expropriations can be brought before the courts.\n\nDenmark have [[freedom of speech]] and [[Freedom of the press|freedom of press]], but some things, say [[Defamation|libel]] or breaking [[confidentiality]], can still be brought before a judge. [[Censorship]] is forbidden. All citizens have [[freedom of association]], but associations who use violence or other illegal means can be temporary banned by the government, while dissolution is tested in court. Dissolution of political association can always be appealed to the Supreme Court. Citizens have [[freedom of assembly]] when unarmed, though danger to public order can lead to outdoor assemblies being banned. In case of riots, the police can dissolve assemblies when it \"in the name of the King and the law\" have requested it three times. Freedom from detention, freedom of association and freedom of assembly can be restricted for military personnel.\n\nAll children have the right to free [[State school|public education]], though no duty to use it; [[Homeschooling|home schooling]] and [[private school]]s are allowed. The political system shall seek to make sure that all able to work can find a job. Those unable to support themselves have the right to public support, if they submit to the related requirements. Access to professions shall only be regulated for the public good, so [[Guild|trade guilds]] cannot regulate this themselves. Every healthy man have a duty to take part in the [[Conscription|military draft]]. There are no privileges attached to [[nobility]], and in the future, no [[fief]]s or [[fee tail]]s can be created. [[Municipality|Municipalities]] have the right to govern themselves.\n|-\n|9\n|The Faroe Islands, Greenland and Iceland\n|\u00a7\u00a7 66\u201367\n|In Denmark, the voting age for municipally elections and elections to [[Church (congregation)|congregation]] boards are the same as for general elections. In Greenland and the Faroe Island, it is decided by law.\n[[Iceland]]ic citizens, who already have rights as if they were Danish citizens, retains these rights. The background for this transitional provision is that Iceland became independent from Denmark in 1918, but, as [[Kingdom of Iceland]], remained in a [[personal union]] until 1944, when it [[1944 Icelandic constitutional referendum|became a republic]]. The 1918 [[Danish\u2013Icelandic Act of Union]] granted Icelandic citizens the same rights in Denmark as Danish citizens, and after the union was dissolved in 1944, these rights were limited to Icelandic citizens then living in Denmark.\n|-\n|10\n|Changes to the constitution\n|\u00a7 88\n|All changes to the constitution requires a majority in the Folketing twice; both before and after a general election. In addition, changes must pass a referendum, where at least 40% of all eligible voters must support the change.\n|-\n|11\n|Entry into force\n|\u00a7 89\n|The current constitution entered into force on 5 June 1953, when published in ''Lovtidende''. The [[Rigsdagen|Rigsdag]], the sitting bicameral legislative under the old constitution, remained in place until the [[1953 Danish general election|September 1953 general election]], where the [[Landstinget|Landsting]], the chamber in addition to the Folketing, was abolished.\n|}\n\n== Constitutional institutions ==\n[[File:Christiansborg Slot Copenhagen 2014 01.jpg|thumb|320x320px|[[Christiansborg Palace]], where both the government, the [[Folketing]] and the [[Supreme Court (Denmark)|Supreme Court]] resides.]]\nThe Constitution establishes Denmark as a [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarcy]], where the [[Monarchy of Denmark|monarch]] serves as a [[ceremonial Head of state]].

In addition, the Folketing elect a number of ''State Auditors'' ({{Lang-da|Statsrevisorer}}), who has the responsibility to look through the public accounts, and check that everything is okay, and that the government only spend money approved by the Folketing. Furthermore, the Folketing also appoints an [[ombudsman]], who investigates wrongdoings by the public administrative authorities on behalf of the public.\n\n=== The courts ===\n{{Main|Courts of Denmark}}\nThe [[Courts of Denmark]] are independent of the other two branches. The Constitution does not stipulate how the courts are to be organized. Instead, this is regulated by statute. In the normal court system, there are 24 District Courts, High Courts and the [[Supreme Court (Denmark)|Supreme Court]]. In addition to these, there is some special courts. There are certain rights in the Constitution with respect to the judiciary system.\n\nThere is a special Court of Impeachment, which can prosecute ministers for their official acts.\n\nThe court system is [[Judicial review in Denmark|able to perform judicial review]] of laws, i.e. check [[Judicial review|if they are constitutional]]. This right is not included in the constitution, but was established by the Supreme Court in the beginning of the 20'th century, when it decided to hear cases about the constitutionally of land laws. While this right was contested in the beginning, the political system eventually accepted it. The Supreme Court have been reluctant to rules laws unconstitutional; the only time it have done so was in 1999, when it found that the [[Tvind]] law breached the principle of separations of power. Cases about the constitutionality of laws can only be initiated by people directly affected by the laws. All can do this with respect to the Danish relation to EU, because of its wide effects on society.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://jyllands-posten.dk/debat/kronik/article5217123.ece/|title=Domstolene som grundlovens vogter|last=Christensen|first=Jens Peter|date=23 February 2013|work=Jyllands-Posten|access-date=26 November 2019|language=da|author-link=Jens Peter Christensen}}</ref>\n\n=== The Church of Denmark ===\n{{Main|Church of Denmark}}\nThe Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Denmark is the [[State religion|state church]] established by the Constitution.

Several of these are of only limited scope and thus serve as a sort of lower bar. The [[European Convention on Human Rights]] was introduced in Denmark by law on 29 April 1992 and supplements the mentioned paragraphs.\n\n=== Personal liberty ===\n{{quote box\n| width = 20em\n| align = right\n| quote = Personal liberty shall be inviolable. No Danish subject shall in any manner whatever be deprived of his liberty because of his political or religious convictions or because of his descent.\n| source = Section 71\n}}The constitution guarantees the personal liberty. No citizen can be held in detention based on their race, religion or political views, and detention can only be used if prescribed by law. People arrested need to be put before a judge within 24 hours, known in Danish as a ''grundlovsforh\u00f8r'' (lit. constitutional interrogation), who decides if the [[Remand (detention)|provisional detention]] should be continued, and this decision can always be appealed. Special rules can apply in Greenland. Detention outside the criminal system or the immigration system, say due to [[Psychiatry|mental illness]], can be brought before the courts.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Right to property ===\nThe constitution guarantees the [[right to property]]. A [[search warrant]] is needed to enter private property, confiscate things, or break the [[secrecy of correspondence]], though general exemptions can be made by law. [[Eminent domain|Expropriations]] must be for the public good, with full compensation, and as allowed by law. Bills regarding expropriations can by 1/3 of the Folketing be delayed until passed again after a general election. All expropriations can be brought before the courts.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Freedom of speech and freedom of the press ===\n{{Further|Freedom of speech and freedom of the press in Denmark}}Denmark have [[freedom of speech]] and [[Freedom of the press|freedom of press]], but some things, say [[Defamation|libel]] or breaking [[confidentiality]], can still be brought before a judge. [[Censorship]] is forbidden. \u00a777: \"Anyone is entitled to in print, writing and speech to publish his or hers thoughts, yet under responsibility to the courts. Censorship and other preventive measures can never again be introduced.\"<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThere's widespread agreement in Danish legal theory that \u00a7 77 protects what is called \"formal freedom of speech\" (formel ytringsfrihed), meaning that one cannot be required to submit one's speech for review by authorities before publishing or otherwise disseminating it.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Danmarks Riges Grundlov med kommentarer|date=2006|publisher=Jurist- og \u00d8konomforbundets Forlag|isbn=8757411565|editor-last=Zahle|editor-first=Henrik|edition=2nd|location=[[Copenhagen]]|p=536|trans-title=Constitution of the Kingdom of Denmark with comments|oclc=466582184|ref=harv}}</ref> However, there is disagreement about whether or not \u00a7 77 covers \"material freedom of speech\" (materiel ytringsfrihed), the right to not be punished for ones speech. There is agreement that the phrasing \"under responsibility to the courts\" gives legislators some right to restrict speech, but conversely there have been several court decisions implying that some material freedom of speech does exist.{{Sfn|Zahle|2006|p=539}} The discussion is about whether the material speech has limits or not, and if so, what those limits are.{{Sfn|Zahle|2006|p=539}}<ref>See {{Harvnb|Zahle|2006|pp=539-552}} for differing perspectives on the issue.</ref>\n\n=== Freedom of association ===\nAll citizens have [[freedom of association]], but associations who use violence or other illegal means can be temporary banned by the government, while dissolution is tested in court.

Access to professions shall only be regulated for the public good, so [[Guild|trade guilds]] cannot regulate this themselves.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n== Other themes ==\n\n=== National sovereignty ===\nSection 20 of the current constitution establishes that the delegation of specified parts of national sovereignty to international authorities requires either a 5/6 majority in Parliament or an ordinary majority in both Parliament and the electorate. This section has been debated heavily in connection with Denmark's membership of the [[European Union]] (EU), as critics hold that changing governments have violated the Constitution by surrendering too much power.\n\nIn 1996, Prime Minister [[Poul Nyrup Rasmussen]] was sued by twelve [[Eurosceptics]] for violating this section. The [[Supreme Court of Denmark|Supreme Court]] acquitted Rasmussen (and thereby earlier governments dating back to 1972) but reaffirmed that there are limits to how much sovereignty can be surrendered. In 2011, Prime Ministers [[Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen]] faced a similar challenge when he was sued by twenty-eight citizens for having adopted the European [[Lisbon Treaty]] without a referendum. The group of professors, actors, writers and Eurosceptic politicians argued that the Lisbon Treaty hands over parts of national sovereignty to the EU and therefore a referendum should have taken place.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pop|first1=Valentina|title=Danish PM sued over Lisbon Treaty|url=https://euobserver.com/political/31622|accessdate=14 April 2016|publisher=[[EUobserver]]|date=11 January 2011|location=Brussels}}</ref> The case was later dismissed.\n\nSection 20 was used in 1972 when Denmark, after a [[1972 Danish European Communities membership referendum|referendum]], joined the [[European Economic Community|EEC]] (now [[European Union|EU]]). More recently, in 2015 an (unsuccessful) [[2015 Danish European Union opt-out referendum|referendum]] was held on one of its EU-opt-outs.\n\n===Greenland and the Faroe Islands===\n{{See also|The unity of the Realm}}\nSection 32 states \"special rules may be provided by Statute for the commencement and determination of Faroe Islands and Greenland representation in the Parliament.\"<ref name=\"Act\" /> This section refers to [[home rule]] in both territories. The specific arrangements for the transfer of powers and monetary competency to Greenland and the Faroe Islands are contained in separate statues, with equal constitutional status (see below).\n\n===Separation of powers===\n{{See also|Separation of powers}}\n\nDenmark have [[separation of powers]] into the three classic branches: the legislative, held by the [[Folketing]]; the executive held by the [[Cabinet of Denmark|government]]; and the judiciary, held by the [[Courts of Denmark|courts]]. The separation of powers is described in the constitution, and is there, as in many democracies, to prevent abuse of power. The Folketing enact laws, and the government implements them. The courts make judgments in disputes, either between citizens, or between authorities and citizens.<ref name=\"danishparliament\" />\n\nThe Constitution is heavily influenced by the French philosopher [[Montesquieu]],{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} whose separation of powers was aimed at achieving mutual monitoring of each of the branches of government. However, the division between legislative and executive power in Denmark is not as sharp as in the [[United States]].\n\nIn 1999, the Supreme Court found that the [[Tvind]] law, a law that barred specific schools from receiving public funding, was unconstitutional, because it breached the concept of separation of powers by settling a concrete dispute between the Tvind schools and the government. The judgment is the only time the courts have found a law to be unconstitutional.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/historisk-tvind-dom|title=Historisk Tvind-dom|last=|first=|date=19 February 1999|work=DR|access-date=26 November 2019|language=da}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Jura/Enkelte_navngivne_retssager/Tvind-dommen|title=Tvind-dommen|last=L.|first=Mads|date=|website=Den Store Danske|language=da|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=26 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Parliamentary power===\nIn several sections the Constitutional Act sets out the powers and duties of the Danish Parliament. Section 15 in the Act, which deals with\nthe parliamentary principle, lays down that \"a Minister shall not remain in office after the Parliament has passed a vote of no confidence in him\".<ref name=\"Act\" /> This suggests that Ministers are accountable to Parliament and even subservient to it. The Cabinet exerts executive power through its Ministers, but cannot remain in office if the majority of the Folketing goes against it. Another important feature of the Danish parliamentary system is that the Constitutional Act lays down that \"the Members of the Folketing shall be elected for a period of four years\", but still, \"the King may at any time issue writs for a new election\".<ref name=\"danishparliament\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Politics|Denmark|Faroe Islands}}\n*[[Codified constitution]]\n*[[Constitutional economics]]\n*[[Constitutionalism]]\n*[[Constitutional law]]\n*[[Index of Denmark-related articles]]\n*[[Politics of Denmark]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikisourcepar|Constitutional Act of Denmark, 5 June 1953}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121120170200/http://www.thedanishparliament.dk/Democracy/The_Constitutional_Act_of_Denmark.aspx The Constitutional Act of Denmark] - The Danish Parliament\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140714134738/http://pub.uvm.dk/2008/democracycanon/kap20.html The Constitutional Act of the Kingdom of Denmark] - Ministry of Education of Denmark\n\n{{Constitution of Europe}}\n{{Denmark topics}}\n{{Faroe Islands topics}}\n{{Greenland topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Constitution Of Denmark}}\n[[Category:1849 in law]]\n[[Category:Government of Denmark]]\n[[Category:Legal history of Denmark]]\n[[Category:Politics of Denmark]]\n[[Category:History of the Faroe Islands]]\n[[Category:Politics of the Faroe Islands]]\n[[Category:History of Greenland]]\n[[Category:Politics of Greenland]]\n[[Category:Danish law| ]]\n[[Category:1849 in Denmark]]\n[[Category:Constitution of Denmark]]\n[[Category:Politics of the Kingdom of Denmark]]\n[[Category:June 1849 events]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox constitution\n| document_name        = Constitutional Act of Denmark\n| image                = Grundloven-1849-forside.jpg\n| image_alt            =\n| caption              = Front page of the first constitution from 1849\n| orig_lang_code       = da\n| title_orig           = Danmarks Riges Grundlov\n| jurisdiction         = [[Denmark]], incl.

This long period of dominance of the H\u00f8jre party under the leadership of [[Jacob Br\u00f8nnum Scavenius Estrup]] with the backing of the king [[Christian IX of Denmark]] was named the ''provisorietid'' (provisional period) because the government was based on provisional laws instead of parliamentary decisions. This also gave rise to a conflict with the Liberals (farm owners) at that time and now known as [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] (Left). This constitutional battle concluded in 1901 with the so-called systemskifte (change of system) with the liberals as victors. At this point the king and H\u00f8jre finally accepted [[parliamentarism]] as the ruling principle of Danish political life. This principle was not [[Codification (law)|codified]] until the 1953 constitution.\n\n=== Universal suffrage (1915) ===\nIn 1915, the tightening from 1866 was reversed, and women were given the right to vote. Also, a new requirement for changing the constitution was introduced. Not only must the new constitution be passed by two consecutive parliaments, it must also pass a referendum, where 45% of the electorate must vote yes. This meant that Prime Minister [[Thorvald Stauning]]'s attempt to change the Constitution in 1939 failed.<ref>S\u00f8ren M\u00f8rch: ''24 statsministre''. {{ISBN|87-02-00361-9}}.</ref>\n\n=== Reunion with Schleswig (1920) ===\n{{See also|1920 Schleswig plebiscites}}\nIn 1920, a [[1920 Danish constitutional referendum|new referendum]] was held to change the Constitution again, allowing for the reunification of Denmark following the defeat of Germany in [[World War I]]. This followed a [[referendum]] held in the former Danish territories of Schleswig-Holstein regarding how the new border should be placed. This resulted in upper Schleswig becoming Danish, today known as [[Southern Jutland]], and the rest remained German.\n\n=== Current Constitution (1953) ===\nIn 1953, the [[1953 Danish constitutional and electoral age referendum|fourth constitution]] abolished the Upper Chamber (the [[Landsting (Denmark)|Landsting]]), giving Denmark a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] parliament. It also enabled females to inherit the throne (see ''[[Danish monarchy#Succession|Succession]]''), but the change still favored boys over girls (this was changed by a [[2009 Danish Act of Succession referendum|referendum in 2009]] so the first-born inherits the throne regardless of sex). Finally, the required number of votes in favor of a change of the Constitution was decreased to the current value of 40% of the electorate.\n\nIn 2009, the [[Danish Act of Succession|Act of Succession]], which is referenced in the constitution and considered an integral part of it, was changed to  eliminate [[male-preference primogeniture]] in favour of [[absolute primogeniture]].

The throne is inherited according to the [[Danish Act of Succession|Act of Succession]], which itself has the same status as the constitution. The [[Church of Denmark]] is the state church. The constitution holds for the entire [[The unity of the Realm|Danish realm]].\n|-\n|2\n|The royal family\n|\u00a7\u00a7 5\u201311\n|There are a number of requirements that the [[Monarchy of Denmark|sovereign]] must live up to, most importantly they must belong to the [[evangelical Lutheran]] faith; in practice they have always have been members of the Church of Denmark. The [[age of majority]] for the sovereign is at 18 years, and the Folketing can make provisions if the sovereign in incapable, minor or abroad, and choose a new sovereign if there are no heirs to the throne. Royal expenses are financed through [[Annuity|annuities]] granted by the Folketing.\n|-\n|3\n|The government\n|\u00a7\u00a7 12\u201327\n|The sovereign,{{Efn|The constitution refers to the sovereign as the \"King\", even though it is currently [[Margrethe II of Denmark|a queen]]. As the queen executes her powers through the government, the use of \"King\" nearly always means the government.|name=|group=lower-alpha}} who formally holds executive power, always exercises this power through the ministers in the government, making the role of sovereign fully ceremonial. Denmark employs the principle of negative [[Parliamentary system|parliamentarianism]], namely that no minister can remain in their post, if a majority of the Folketing opposes them. In addition ministers can be trialed at the Court of [[Impeachment]] (\u00a7\u00a7 59-60) for their actions while in government. Government business are discussed in the Council of State or the Council of Ministers, who today have little importance. New laws must receive [[royal assent]] and be proclaimed; this happens in ''[[Lovtidende]]''. Pre-constitutional laws remain in effect.\n\nMinisters have the right to propose laws and decision (in case they are not members of the Folketing), and the government is allowed to pardon criminals and mint coins. Under exceptional circumstances, the government can enact temporary laws, which must be reaffirmed by the Folketing as quickly as possible. In foreign policy, important decisions are taken by the Foreign Policy Committee in the Folketing, including the ratification of treaties, and the initiation of offensive military operations. A certain type of civil servants, known in Danish as ''tjenestem\u00e6nd'' (lit. servicemen), have special privileges to prevent corruption.\n\n\u00a7 20 allows Denmark to hand over [[sovereignty]] to [[intergovernmental organization]]s, which is often a requirement for joining them. This needs a [[supermajority]] of 5/6 in the Folketing, or that it is approved in a referendum.\n|-\n|4\n|Elections to the Folketing\n|\u00a7\u00a7 28\u201334\n|The Folketing consists of up to 179 members,{{Efn|The constitution says \"not more than\" 179, but the Danish election law says that exactly 179 members are elected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=206576|title=LBK nr 137 af 07/02/2019|last=|first=|date=21 February 2019|website=Retsinformation|language=da|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=24 November 2019}}</ref>|name=|group=}} of which two are elected from [[Greenland]], and two from the [[Faroe Islands]]. Elections are held at least every 4 years, with the [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]] able to call a [[snap election]]. Elections are direct and secret, and the voting system shall ensure [[proportional representation]]. To vote you need to be a Danish citizen not under [[legal guardian]]ship, live in Denmark, and be above the voting age. The voting age was set to 23 years in a [[1953 Danish constitutional and electoral age referendum|1953 referendum]], but has since been lowered three times, and has been 18 years since 1978. Changes to the voting age require a referendum. All eligible to vote are eligible to run for a seat in the Folketing; however the Folketing can expel members who have been convicted of a crime, if they deem that they are \"unworthy\" of their seat. Acts against the security or freedom of the Folketing is high treason.\n|-\n|5\n|The Folketing\n|\u00a7\u00a7 35\u201358\n|The business year runs from the first Tuesday in October to the first Tuesday in October the next year. After a general election and at the beginning of a new business year, all unfinished business is dropped, and the Folketing starts anew. The Folketing elects a [[Speaker of the Folketing|speaker]] and vice chairmen, both after an election and at the beginning of each business year. A business year starts with an opening speech from the prime minister.\nThe Folketing meets where the government resides, which is in [[Christiansborg Palace]]. The speaker calls the meetings, and are obliged to do so on request from the prime minister or two-fifths of the Folketing. Meetings are public accessible; closed meetings can be held, but the last time this happened was in 1924, during a [[Erik the Red's Land|conflict with Norway over Greenland]]. A [[quorum]] consists of half of the members. Every member of the Folketing can propose laws and decisions, and only they (and ministers per \u00a7 21) can do that. All bills require three [[Reading (legislature)|readings]] before being passed into law. One-third of the Folketing can demand that an otherwise passed bill should be confirmed in a referendum, though some bills, among those fiscal bills, cannot be subject of a referendum.\n\nEach year, a finance bill, which defines the state budget, needs to be passed into law for the following fiscal year (which since 1979 has followed the calendar year). A provisional appropriations bill can be passed if the finance bill is not passed in time. A budget or a supplementary appropriation act is necessary to charge taxes and spend money, though in practice the Finance Committee have been allowed to approve extra expenditures, which are then spent before being passed into law. The public accounts shall be ready six months after the fiscal year, and are audited by the State Auditors, who are appointed by the Folketing.\n\nMembers of the Folketing receive a salary, and have absolute [[freedom of speech]] within the Folketing. In addition, they have [[parliamentary immunity]], except if caught in the act, though this immunity can be lifted by the Folketing. Members are not in any way bound by pledges or what [[Party discipline|their party says]], but free to vote in any way they wish. They can ask ministers questions, who are then obliged to answer.\n\nAppointments to parliamentary committees are done through proportional representation. The Folketing appoint one or two [[ombudsman|ombudsmen]]; the Folketing have decided to only appoint one. The Folketing can establish parliamentary commissions for investigations, though this have only happened five times; usually commissions led by a judge is used instead. All taxes, state loans, and military inscriptions must be set in laws. Foreigners can only be [[Danish nationality law|naturalized by law]], and only buy real-estate as permitted by law.\n|-\n|6\n|The courts\n|\u00a7\u00a7 59\u201365\n|The courts are independent of the government, though they are regulated by law. Establishing a new court to handle a specific case is not allowed. Judges answers to no-one, and in general cannot be fired or forcefully moved to a new position, unless due to a restructuring, or by verdict from other judges. Judges above 65 years can be fired, but will receive full pay until the mandatory retirement age, which is currently 70 years. It is possible to sue public agencies. The Folketing can establish special courts to handle such cases, and their verdicts can be appealed to the [[Supreme Court (Denmark)|Supreme Court]], though none have been established. Court proceedings must be as transparent as possible, and [[lay judge]]s must be used in criminal cases.\nThe special Court of Impeachment, which decides cases against ministers, consists of the 15 most senior Supreme Court judges and an equal amount appointed by the Folketing. The appointed judges cannot be members of the Folketing themselves, and sits for 6 years but remain on cases started before the end of their term. Cases are brought before the impeachment court by the government or the Folketing. Only five impeachment cases have been held; the latest was the 1993\u20131995 case against former [[Justice Minister (Denmark)|Minister of Justice]], [[Erik Ninn-Hansen]] regarding the [[Tamil Case (Denmark)|Tamil Case]].\n|-\n|7\n|Religion\n|\u00a7\u00a7 66\u201370\n|The Church of Denmark is the state church by \u00a7 4, and the Folketing can by statue decide its constitution, but has not done so. Denmark has [[freedom of religion]], and allows all to form and join religious communities, as long as they do not impinge on \"good morals or public order\". No-one is forced to pay to religions that are not their own, so the church tax is only paid by members of the Church of Denmark. Religious observance or race does not affect people's civic and political rights and duties.\n|-\n|8\n|Citizens' rights\n|\u00a7\u00a7 71\u201385\n|No citizen can be held in detention based on their race, religion or political views, and detention can only be used if prescribed by law. People arrested need to be put before a judge within 24 hours, known in Danish as a ''grundlovsforh\u00f8r'' (lit. constitutional interrogation), which decides if the [[Remand (detention)|provisional detention]] should be continued, and this decision can always be appealed. Special rules can apply in Greenland. Detention outside the criminal system or the immigration system, say due to [[Psychiatry|mental illness]], can be brought before the courts.\nA [[search warrant]] is needed to enter private property, confiscate things, or break the [[secrecy of correspondence]], though general exemptions can be made by law. [[Eminent domain|Expropriations]] must be for the public good, with full compensation, and as allowed by law. Bills regarding expropriations can by 1/3 of the Folketing be delayed until passed again after a general election. All expropriations can be brought before the courts.\n\nDenmark have [[freedom of speech]] and [[Freedom of the press|freedom of press]], but some things, say [[Defamation|libel]] or breaking [[confidentiality]], can still be brought before a judge. [[Censorship]] is forbidden. All citizens have [[freedom of association]], but associations who use violence or other illegal means can be temporary banned by the government, while dissolution is tested in court. Dissolution of political association can always be appealed to the Supreme Court. Citizens have [[freedom of assembly]] when unarmed, though danger to public order can lead to outdoor assemblies being banned. In case of riots, the police can dissolve assemblies when it \"in the name of the King and the law\" have requested it three times. Freedom from detention, freedom of association and freedom of assembly can be restricted for military personnel.\n\nAll children have the right to free [[State school|public education]], though no duty to use it; [[Homeschooling|home schooling]] and [[private school]]s are allowed. The political system shall seek to make sure that all able to work can find a job. Those unable to support themselves have the right to public support, if they submit to the related requirements. Access to professions shall only be regulated for the public good, so [[Guild|trade guilds]] cannot regulate this themselves. Every healthy man have a duty to take part in the [[Conscription|military draft]]. There are no privileges attached to [[nobility]], and in the future, no [[fief]]s or [[fee tail]]s can be created. [[Municipality|Municipalities]] have the right to govern themselves.\n|-\n|9\n|The Faroe Islands, Greenland and Iceland\n|\u00a7\u00a7 66\u201367\n|In Denmark, the voting age for municipally elections and elections to [[Church (congregation)|congregation]] boards are the same as for general elections. In Greenland and the Faroe Island, it is decided by law.\n[[Iceland]]ic citizens, who already have rights as if they were Danish citizens, retains these rights. The background for this transitional provision is that Iceland became independent from Denmark in 1918, but, as [[Kingdom of Iceland]], remained in a [[personal union]] until 1944, when it [[1944 Icelandic constitutional referendum|became a republic]]. The 1918 [[Danish\u2013Icelandic Act of Union]] granted Icelandic citizens the same rights in Denmark as Danish citizens, and after the union was dissolved in 1944, these rights were limited to Icelandic citizens then living in Denmark.\n|-\n|10\n|Changes to the constitution\n|\u00a7 88\n|All changes to the constitution requires a majority in the Folketing twice; both before and after a general election. In addition, changes must pass a referendum, where at least 40% of all eligible voters must support the change.\n|-\n|11\n|Entry into force\n|\u00a7 89\n|The current constitution entered into force on 5 June 1953, when published in ''Lovtidende''.

The Government does not have to pass a [[Vote of Confidence|vote of confidence]] before taking the seat, but any minister can be subject to a motion of no confidence. If a vote of no confidence is successfully passed against the Prime Minister, the government must resign or call a [[snap election]].\n\n=== The Folketing ===\n{{Main|Folketing}}\n[[File:Det danske parlament.jpg|thumb|240x240px|The Folketing chamber, inside Christiansborg Palace]]\nThe Folketing is the legislative branch of Denmark, and is located at [[Christiansborg Palace|Christiansborg]]. It consists of 179 members,{{efn|While the Constitution says that \"not more than\" 179 members are elected, the law concerning general elections states that exactly 179 members are elected.<ref>{{Citation|last=|first=|title=Bekendtg\u00f8relse af lov om valg til Folketinget|date=2017-12-08|url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=194769|volume=|issue=LBK nr 1426|pages=|quote=\"\u00a7 7.

[[General election]]s is nominally held every 4 years, but the Prime Minister can at any point call a snap election. All Danish citizens over the age of 18 years who are living permanently within Denmark is eligible to vote, except those placed under [[legal guardianship]]. The same group of people is able to run for office. The electoral system is characterized as a [[party-list proportional representation]] system, with an [[election threshold]] on 2%. As a result, Denmark has a [[Multi-party system|multi-party parliamentary system]], where no single party has an absolute majority.\n\nThe session starts anew each year on the first Tuesday in October, and when interrupted by a general election; all previously unfinished business is cancelled. The Folketing then elects a [[Speaker of the Folketing|speaker]], who is responsible for convening meetings. The Folketing lay down their own [[Parliamentary procedure|rules of procedure]], subject to the requirements in the Constitution. Among those, the required [[quorum]] of 90 members of the Folketing, and the rule that every [[Bill (law)|proposed law]] requires three [[Reading (legislature)|readings]] in the Folketing, before it can be passed into law.\n\nThe Folketing also have the responsibility of holding the government accountable for the governance. The members of the Folketing does this by submitting questing to the ministers and convene them to explanatory hearings. In addition, the Folketing elect a number of ''State Auditors'' ({{Lang-da|Statsrevisorer}}), who has the responsibility to look through the public accounts, and check that everything is okay, and that the government only spend money approved by the Folketing. Furthermore, the Folketing also appoints an [[ombudsman]], who investigates wrongdoings by the public administrative authorities on behalf of the public.\n\n=== The courts ===\n{{Main|Courts of Denmark}}\nThe [[Courts of Denmark]] are independent of the other two branches. The Constitution does not stipulate how the courts are to be organized. Instead, this is regulated by statute. In the normal court system, there are 24 District Courts, High Courts and the [[Supreme Court (Denmark)|Supreme Court]]. In addition to these, there is some special courts. There are certain rights in the Constitution with respect to the judiciary system.\n\nThere is a special Court of Impeachment, which can prosecute ministers for their official acts.\n\nThe court system is [[Judicial review in Denmark|able to perform judicial review]] of laws, i.e. check [[Judicial review|if they are constitutional]]. This right is not included in the constitution, but was established by the Supreme Court in the beginning of the 20'th century, when it decided to hear cases about the constitutionally of land laws. While this right was contested in the beginning, the political system eventually accepted it. The Supreme Court have been reluctant to rules laws unconstitutional; the only time it have done so was in 1999, when it found that the [[Tvind]] law breached the principle of separations of power. Cases about the constitutionality of laws can only be initiated by people directly affected by the laws. All can do this with respect to the Danish relation to EU, because of its wide effects on society.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://jyllands-posten.dk/debat/kronik/article5217123.ece/|title=Domstolene som grundlovens vogter|last=Christensen|first=Jens Peter|date=23 February 2013|work=Jyllands-Posten|access-date=26 November 2019|language=da|author-link=Jens Peter Christensen}}</ref>\n\n=== The Church of Denmark ===\n{{Main|Church of Denmark}}\nThe Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Denmark is the [[State religion|state church]] established by the Constitution.

Several of these are of only limited scope and thus serve as a sort of lower bar. The [[European Convention on Human Rights]] was introduced in Denmark by law on 29 April 1992 and supplements the mentioned paragraphs.\n\n=== Personal liberty ===\n{{quote box\n| width = 20em\n| align = right\n| quote = Personal liberty shall be inviolable. No Danish subject shall in any manner whatever be deprived of his liberty because of his political or religious convictions or because of his descent.\n| source = Section 71\n}}The constitution guarantees the personal liberty. No citizen can be held in detention based on their race, religion or political views, and detention can only be used if prescribed by law. People arrested need to be put before a judge within 24 hours, known in Danish as a ''grundlovsforh\u00f8r'' (lit. constitutional interrogation), who decides if the [[Remand (detention)|provisional detention]] should be continued, and this decision can always be appealed. Special rules can apply in Greenland. Detention outside the criminal system or the immigration system, say due to [[Psychiatry|mental illness]], can be brought before the courts.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Right to property ===\nThe constitution guarantees the [[right to property]]. A [[search warrant]] is needed to enter private property, confiscate things, or break the [[secrecy of correspondence]], though general exemptions can be made by law. [[Eminent domain|Expropriations]] must be for the public good, with full compensation, and as allowed by law. Bills regarding expropriations can by 1/3 of the Folketing be delayed until passed again after a general election. All expropriations can be brought before the courts.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Freedom of speech and freedom of the press ===\n{{Further|Freedom of speech and freedom of the press in Denmark}}Denmark have [[freedom of speech]] and [[Freedom of the press|freedom of press]], but some things, say [[Defamation|libel]] or breaking [[confidentiality]], can still be brought before a judge. [[Censorship]] is forbidden. \u00a777: \"Anyone is entitled to in print, writing and speech to publish his or hers thoughts, yet under responsibility to the courts. Censorship and other preventive measures can never again be introduced.\"<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThere's widespread agreement in Danish legal theory that \u00a7 77 protects what is called \"formal freedom of speech\" (formel ytringsfrihed), meaning that one cannot be required to submit one's speech for review by authorities before publishing or otherwise disseminating it.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Danmarks Riges Grundlov med kommentarer|date=2006|publisher=Jurist- og \u00d8konomforbundets Forlag|isbn=8757411565|editor-last=Zahle|editor-first=Henrik|edition=2nd|location=[[Copenhagen]]|p=536|trans-title=Constitution of the Kingdom of Denmark with comments|oclc=466582184|ref=harv}}</ref> However, there is disagreement about whether or not \u00a7 77 covers \"material freedom of speech\" (materiel ytringsfrihed), the right to not be punished for ones speech. There is agreement that the phrasing \"under responsibility to the courts\" gives legislators some right to restrict speech, but conversely there have been several court decisions implying that some material freedom of speech does exist.{{Sfn|Zahle|2006|p=539}} The discussion is about whether the material speech has limits or not, and if so, what those limits are.{{Sfn|Zahle|2006|p=539}}<ref>See {{Harvnb|Zahle|2006|pp=539-552}} for differing perspectives on the issue.</ref>\n\n=== Freedom of association ===\nAll citizens have [[freedom of association]], but associations who use violence or other illegal means can be temporary banned by the government, while dissolution is tested in court. Dissolution of political association can always be appealed to the Supreme Court.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn 1941, during the [[Denmark in World War II|occupation by Nazi Germany]], the Rigsdag banned the [[Communist Party of Denmark|Communist Party]] through the [[Communist Law|communist law]]. The law also legalized existing interments of Danish communists, including members of the Folketing.

Access to professions shall only be regulated for the public good, so [[Guild|trade guilds]] cannot regulate this themselves.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n== Other themes ==\n\n=== National sovereignty ===\nSection 20 of the current constitution establishes that the delegation of specified parts of national sovereignty to international authorities requires either a 5/6 majority in Parliament or an ordinary majority in both Parliament and the electorate. This section has been debated heavily in connection with Denmark's membership of the [[European Union]] (EU), as critics hold that changing governments have violated the Constitution by surrendering too much power.\n\nIn 1996, Prime Minister [[Poul Nyrup Rasmussen]] was sued by twelve [[Eurosceptics]] for violating this section. The [[Supreme Court of Denmark|Supreme Court]] acquitted Rasmussen (and thereby earlier governments dating back to 1972) but reaffirmed that there are limits to how much sovereignty can be surrendered. In 2011, Prime Ministers [[Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen]] faced a similar challenge when he was sued by twenty-eight citizens for having adopted the European [[Lisbon Treaty]] without a referendum. The group of professors, actors, writers and Eurosceptic politicians argued that the Lisbon Treaty hands over parts of national sovereignty to the EU and therefore a referendum should have taken place.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pop|first1=Valentina|title=Danish PM sued over Lisbon Treaty|url=https://euobserver.com/political/31622|accessdate=14 April 2016|publisher=[[EUobserver]]|date=11 January 2011|location=Brussels}}</ref> The case was later dismissed.\n\nSection 20 was used in 1972 when Denmark, after a [[1972 Danish European Communities membership referendum|referendum]], joined the [[European Economic Community|EEC]] (now [[European Union|EU]]). More recently, in 2015 an (unsuccessful) [[2015 Danish European Union opt-out referendum|referendum]] was held on one of its EU-opt-outs.\n\n===Greenland and the Faroe Islands===\n{{See also|The unity of the Realm}}\nSection 32 states \"special rules may be provided by Statute for the commencement and determination of Faroe Islands and Greenland representation in the Parliament.\"<ref name=\"Act\" /> This section refers to [[home rule]] in both territories. The specific arrangements for the transfer of powers and monetary competency to Greenland and the Faroe Islands are contained in separate statues, with equal constitutional status (see below).\n\n===Separation of powers===\n{{See also|Separation of powers}}\n\nDenmark have [[separation of powers]] into the three classic branches: the legislative, held by the [[Folketing]]; the executive held by the [[Cabinet of Denmark|government]]; and the judiciary, held by the [[Courts of Denmark|courts]]. The separation of powers is described in the constitution, and is there, as in many democracies, to prevent abuse of power. The Folketing enact laws, and the government implements them. The courts make judgments in disputes, either between citizens, or between authorities and citizens.<ref name=\"danishparliament\" />\n\nThe Constitution is heavily influenced by the French philosopher [[Montesquieu]],{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} whose separation of powers was aimed at achieving mutual monitoring of each of the branches of government. However, the division between legislative and executive power in Denmark is not as sharp as in the [[United States]].\n\nIn 1999, the Supreme Court found that the [[Tvind]] law, a law that barred specific schools from receiving public funding, was unconstitutional, because it breached the concept of separation of powers by settling a concrete dispute between the Tvind schools and the government. The judgment is the only time the courts have found a law to be unconstitutional.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/historisk-tvind-dom|title=Historisk Tvind-dom|last=|first=|date=19 February 1999|work=DR|access-date=26 November 2019|language=da}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Jura/Enkelte_navngivne_retssager/Tvind-dommen|title=Tvind-dommen|last=L.|first=Mads|date=|website=Den Store Danske|language=da|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=26 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Parliamentary power===\nIn several sections the Constitutional Act sets out the powers and duties of the Danish Parliament. Section 15 in the Act, which deals with\nthe parliamentary principle, lays down that \"a Minister shall not remain in office after the Parliament has passed a vote of no confidence in him\".<ref name=\"Act\" /> This suggests that Ministers are accountable to Parliament and even subservient to it. The Cabinet exerts executive power through its Ministers, but cannot remain in office if the majority of the Folketing goes against it. Another important feature of the Danish parliamentary system is that the Constitutional Act lays down that \"the Members of the Folketing shall be elected for a period of four years\", but still, \"the King may at any time issue writs for a new election\".<ref name=\"danishparliament\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Politics|Denmark|Faroe Islands}}\n*[[Codified constitution]]\n*[[Constitutional economics]]\n*[[Constitutionalism]]\n*[[Constitutional law]]\n*[[Index of Denmark-related articles]]\n*[[Politics of Denmark]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikisourcepar|Constitutional Act of Denmark, 5 June 1953}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121120170200/http://www.thedanishparliament.dk/Democracy/The_Constitutional_Act_of_Denmark.aspx The Constitutional Act of Denmark] - The Danish Parliament\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140714134738/http://pub.uvm.dk/2008/democracycanon/kap20.html The Constitutional Act of the Kingdom of Denmark] - Ministry of Education of Denmark\n\n{{Constitution of Europe}}\n{{Denmark topics}}\n{{Faroe Islands topics}}\n{{Greenland topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Constitution Of Denmark}}\n[[Category:1849 in law]]\n[[Category:Government of Denmark]]\n[[Category:Legal history of Denmark]]\n[[Category:Politics of Denmark]]\n[[Category:History of the Faroe Islands]]\n[[Category:Politics of the Faroe Islands]]\n[[Category:History of Greenland]]\n[[Category:Politics of Greenland]]\n[[Category:Danish law| ]]\n[[Category:1849 in Denmark]]\n[[Category:Constitution of Denmark]]\n[[Category:Politics of the Kingdom of Denmark]]\n[[Category:June 1849 events]]\n", "name_user": "BALMAINM", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Denmark"}
