Anejom\u0303 falls under the [[Southern Oceanic languages|Southern Oceanic Languages]] subgroup, and more specifically Southern Vanuatuan Languages.<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />  It constitutes its own separate branch of Southern Vanuatuan languages.  While Anejom\u0303 is now considered to be only one language, some historical reports have suggested that Anejom\u0303 might have consisted of two very distinct dialects.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Linguistic History of Southern Vanuatu|last=Lynch|first=John|publisher=Pacific Linguistics|year=2001|isbn=|location=Canberra, Australia|pages=5}}</ref>  Its closest relatives are preliminarily thought to be more closely related to the languages of Tanna (e.g. Kwamera, South-West Tanna, Lenakel) than Erromango languages.<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:New Hebrides.JPG|thumb|Map of Vanuatu (Formerly known as the New Hebrides)|left]]\nThe island of Aneityum is the southernmost inhabited island of the nation of Vanuatu.  It is closest to the islands of [[Tanna (island)|Tanna]] and [[Futuna Island, Vanuatu|Futuna]].<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />  The island's geographic location made Anejom\u0303 develop in isolation.<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />  The first speakers of the language are believed to have lived on hillsides near coasts in order to access resources.  However, due to land degradation and population pressure, the speakers moved to the valleys.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== History ==\nAneityum is thought to have been settled around 874 BCE +/- 60 years by people coming over from Tanna.  Original settlers (and speakers of the language) are thought to have lived on hillsides near the coasts in order to access resources from the ocean and land.<ref group=gr name=\":9\" group=gr>{{Page numbers|1}}</ref>  However, the combination of land degradation and population forced the Aneityumese to move onto valley flats instead.<ref group=gr name=\":9\" />\n\nThe original political system was like much of Melanesia; it was composed of multiple chiefs (''natimarid)'' ruling over many chiefdoms (''neclau'').<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />  According to oral tradition, the island had two chiefdoms but they split to then form seven chiefdoms each \"further divided into a number of districts between fifty and sixty in number\".<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />\n\nThe first contact with Europeans was in 1830, when the brig ''Alpha'' landed in Aneityum with hopes of establishing a sandalwood trading business.<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />\n\nThe population of the Aneityumese has greatly declined over the years (along with the number of speakers); however, the population has seen a bit of a resurgence in the present.  Most of the population was decimated by two major epidemics in the 1830s and 1840s and never fully recovered as can be seen below:<ref group=gr>{{Page numbers|3}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"4\" |Aneityum population\n|-\n!Pre-Contact\n|9,000-20,000\n!1905\n|435\n|-\n!1830\n|4,600-5,800\n!1917\n|320\n|-\n!1854\n|3,800\n!1926\n|220\n|-\n!1865\n|2,100\n!1936\n|193\n|-\n!1878\n|1,279\n!1947\n|191\n|-\n!1886\n|930\n!1957\n|244\n|-\n!1897\n|527\n!1967\n|313\n|}\n\n=== Church Presence ===\nLike much of the rest of Melanesia, the church has played an important role in language ideology on Aneityum.  The first missionaries to land on the island were Samoan Presbyterians who arrived in 1841.  After them followed European Presbyterian missionaries who established themselves in 1848.<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />  With the large missionary presence on the island, many schools were founded to spread the message of Christianity.  In these schools, the classroom was mainly conducted in Anejom\u0303, however numeracy was conducted in English.<ref name=\":30\">Lynch, John Dominic. Church, State and Language in Melanesia: An Inaugural Lecture. Papua New Guinea: U of Papua New Guinea, 1979.</ref>  The missionary presence on the island was so prevalent that the island was considered the \"first successfully missionized island in Melanesia\" and housed the headquarters of the Presbyterian Mission to the New Hebrides.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe missions on Aneityum promoted the use of English.\n\n=== Colonialization ===\nVanuatu came under joint British and French rule in 1887, which then became formalized in 1906 where Vanuatu became known as the \"Anglo-French Condominium\".  Colonialization along with the big mission presence on the island led to the languages of French and English to become prestige languages.<ref name=\":30\" />  Other languages of Vanuatu also became prestigious (such as Nguna) because these language were chosen by missionaries to spread their teachings.<ref name=\":30\" />  With prolonged contact with English speakers, another language also arose: Bislama.  Bislama, a pidgin of English, is now an extremely widely used language and has had a huge role in language change within Anejom\u0303.\n\n== Phonology and Orthography ==\n\n=== Phonemes ===\nAnejom\u0303 has 5 vowels and 20 or 21 consonants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://phoible.org/inventories/view/1228|title=PHOIBLE Online -|website=phoible.org|access-date=2016-04-06}}</ref>  The sound [\u0294] is sometimes counted as phoneme.<ref group=gr name=\":0\" /> Vowel and consonant length is contrastive in this language and is shown in [[orthography]] by writing the vowel or consonant twice.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"8\" |Anejom\u0303 Consonants\n|-\n!\n!Labial-Velar\n!Labial\n!Dental\n!Alveolar\n!Palatal\n!Velar\n!Glottal\n|-\n|Plosive\n|p\u02b7      \n|p\n|\n|t\n|\n|k\n|(\u0294)\n|-\n|Nasal\n|m\u02b7\n|m\n|\n|n\n|\u0272\n|\u014b\n|\n|-\n|Affricate\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|t\u0283\n|\n|\n|-\n|Tap\n|\n|\n|\n|r\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Fricative\n|\n|f       v\n|\u03b8  \n|s\n|\n|\u0263\n|h\n|-\n|Lateral \n|\n|\n|\n|l\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Semivowels\n|w\n|\n|\n|\n|j\n|\n|\n|}\n!\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"7\" |'''Anejom\u0303 Vowels'''\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |Front\n| colspan=\"2\" |Central\n| colspan=\"2\" |Back\n|-\n|\n|short\n|long\n|short\n|long\n|short\n|long\n|-\n|High\n|\u026a\n|\u026a\u026a\n|\n|\n|\u028a\n|\u028a\u028a\n|-\n|Mid\n|\u025b\n|\u025b\u025b\n|\n|\n|\u0254\n|\u0254\u0254\n|-\n|Low\n|\n|\n|a\n|aa\n|\n|\n|}\n  |}\n\n=== Orthography ===\nAnejom\u0303 was never a written language and so traditionally did not have an orthography.

Compounding is so prevalent, that historical linguistics use modern (as well as [[Fossilization (linguistics)|fossilized]] compounds) to trace genealogical relationships between Oceanic languages.  Another one of the key uses of compounding in Anejom\u0303, is it is used to form the instrumental case.

The preferred word order in Anejom\u0303 is [[Verb\u2013object\u2013subject|VOS]] (or verb, followed by object, then subject).

It is the only indigenous language of Aneityum.<ref group=gr name=\":0\">{{Page numbers|2}}</ref>\n\n== Classification ==\nAnejom\u0303 is part of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language family, and is part of the large subgroup of [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]] [[Oceanic languages|languages]].  Anejom\u0303 falls under the [[Southern Oceanic languages|Southern Oceanic Languages]] subgroup, and more specifically Southern Vanuatuan Languages.<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />  It constitutes its own separate branch of Southern Vanuatuan languages.  While Anejom\u0303 is now considered to be only one language, some historical reports have suggested that Anejom\u0303 might have consisted of two very distinct dialects.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=The Linguistic History of Southern Vanuatu|last=Lynch|first=John|publisher=Pacific Linguistics|year=2001|isbn=|location=Canberra, Australia|pages=5}}</ref>  Its closest relatives are preliminarily thought to be more closely related to the languages of Tanna (e.g. Kwamera, South-West Tanna, Lenakel) than Erromango languages.<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:New Hebrides.JPG|thumb|Map of Vanuatu (Formerly known as the New Hebrides)|left]]\nThe island of Aneityum is the southernmost inhabited island of the nation of Vanuatu.  It is closest to the islands of [[Tanna (island)|Tanna]] and [[Futuna Island, Vanuatu|Futuna]].<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />  The island's geographic location made Anejom\u0303 develop in isolation.<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />  The first speakers of the language are believed to have lived on hillsides near coasts in order to access resources.  However, due to land degradation and population pressure, the speakers moved to the valleys.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== History ==\nAneityum is thought to have been settled around 874 BCE +/- 60 years by people coming over from Tanna.  Original settlers (and speakers of the language) are thought to have lived on hillsides near the coasts in order to access resources from the ocean and land.<ref group=gr name=\":9\" group=gr>{{Page numbers|1}}</ref>  However, the combination of land degradation and population forced the Aneityumese to move onto valley flats instead.<ref group=gr name=\":9\" />\n\nThe original political system was like much of Melanesia; it was composed of multiple chiefs (''natimarid)'' ruling over many chiefdoms (''neclau'').<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />  According to oral tradition, the island had two chiefdoms but they split to then form seven chiefdoms each \"further divided into a number of districts between fifty and sixty in number\".<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />\n\nThe first contact with Europeans was in 1830, when the brig ''Alpha'' landed in Aneityum with hopes of establishing a sandalwood trading business.<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />\n\nThe population of the Aneityumese has greatly declined over the years (along with the number of speakers); however, the population has seen a bit of a resurgence in the present.  Most of the population was decimated by two major epidemics in the 1830s and 1840s and never fully recovered as can be seen below:<ref group=gr>{{Page numbers|3}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"4\" |Aneityum population\n|-\n!Pre-Contact\n|9,000-20,000\n!1905\n|435\n|-\n!1830\n|4,600-5,800\n!1917\n|320\n|-\n!1854\n|3,800\n!1926\n|220\n|-\n!1865\n|2,100\n!1936\n|193\n|-\n!1878\n|1,279\n!1947\n|191\n|-\n!1886\n|930\n!1957\n|244\n|-\n!1897\n|527\n!1967\n|313\n|}\n\n=== Church Presence ===\nLike much of the rest of Melanesia, the church has played an important role in language ideology on Aneityum.  The first missionaries to land on the island were Samoan Presbyterians who arrived in 1841.  After them followed European Presbyterian missionaries who established themselves in 1848.<ref group=gr name=\":0\" />  With the large missionary presence on the island, many schools were founded to spread the message of Christianity.  In these schools, the classroom was mainly conducted in Anejom\u0303, however numeracy was conducted in English.<ref name=\":30\">Lynch, John Dominic. Church, State and Language in Melanesia: An Inaugural Lecture. Papua New Guinea: U of Papua New Guinea, 1979.</ref>  The missionary presence on the island was so prevalent that the island was considered the \"first successfully missionized island in Melanesia\" and housed the headquarters of the Presbyterian Mission to the New Hebrides.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe missions on Aneityum promoted the use of English.\n\n=== Colonialization ===\nVanuatu came under joint British and French rule in 1887, which then became formalized in 1906 where Vanuatu became known as the \"Anglo-French Condominium\".  Colonialization along with the big mission presence on the island led to the languages of French and English to become prestige languages.<ref name=\":30\" />  Other languages of Vanuatu also became prestigious (such as Nguna) because these language were chosen by missionaries to spread their teachings.<ref name=\":30\" />  With prolonged contact with English speakers, another language also arose: Bislama.  Bislama, a pidgin of English, is now an extremely widely used language and has had a huge role in language change within Anejom\u0303.\n\n== Phonology and Orthography ==\n\n=== Phonemes ===\nAnejom\u0303 has 5 vowels and 20 or 21 consonants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://phoible.org/inventories/view/1228|title=PHOIBLE Online -|website=phoible.org|access-date=2016-04-06}}</ref>  The sound [\u0294] is sometimes counted as phoneme.<ref group=gr name=\":0\" /> Vowel and consonant length is contrastive in this language and is shown in [[orthography]] by writing the vowel or consonant twice.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"8\" |Anejom\u0303 Consonants\n|-\n!\n!Labial-Velar\n!Labial\n!Dental\n!Alveolar\n!Palatal\n!Velar\n!Glottal\n|-\n|Plosive\n|p\u02b7      \n|p\n|\n|t\n|\n|k\n|(\u0294)\n|-\n|Nasal\n|m\u02b7\n|m\n|\n|n\n|\u0272\n|\u014b\n|\n|-\n|Affricate\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|t\u0283\n|\n|\n|-\n|Tap\n|\n|\n|\n|r\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Fricative\n|\n|f       v\n|\u03b8  \n|s\n|\n|\u0263\n|h\n|-\n|Lateral \n|\n|\n|\n|l\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Semivowels\n|w\n|\n|\n|\n|j\n|\n|\n|}\n!\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"7\" |'''Anejom\u0303 Vowels'''\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |Front\n| colspan=\"2\" |Central\n| colspan=\"2\" |Back\n|-\n|\n|short\n|long\n|short\n|long\n|short\n|long\n|-\n|High\n|\u026a\n|\u026a\u026a\n|\n|\n|\u028a\n|\u028a\u028a\n|-\n|Mid\n|\u025b\n|\u025b\u025b\n|\n|\n|\u0254\n|\u0254\u0254\n|-\n|Low\n|\n|\n|a\n|aa\n|\n|\n|}\n  |}\n\n=== Orthography ===\nAnejom\u0303 was never a written language and so traditionally did not have an orthography.

The country gained independence from the British government on 1 October 1960, and became a republic in 1963. The journey to independence started with some constitutional developments in Nigeria. these constitutional developments saw the country attaining self-rule in some quarters in 1957 and total independence on 1 October 1960.\n\n==Presidents==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Presidents during the Nigerian First Republic\n!

The Nigerian People's Congress (NPC) represented the interests of the predominantly [[Hausa people|Hausa]]/[[Fulani]] Northern Region, the [[National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons]] (NCNC)] (later renamed to \"National Council of Nigerian Citizens\") represented the predominantly [[Igbo people|Igbo]] Eastern Region, and the [[Action Group (Nigeria)|Action Group]] (AG) dominated the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] Western Region. The NPC took control of the federal parliament, and formed a coalition government with the NCNC. The National Independence Party (NIP) formed by Professor Eyo Ita became the second political party in the old Eastern Region.  [[Ahmadu Bello]], the Sardauna of Sokoto, leader of the NPC, was poised to become the Prime Minister, but instead he chose to become the [[Premier]] of the Northern Region, and supported his deputy [[Tafawa Balewa|Tafawa Balewa's]] candidacy for Prime Minister. This raised suspicions amongst the southern politicians, who resented the idea of a federal government controlled by a regional leader through his designated proxy. In the end, Tafawa Balewa of NPC was named Prime Minister and Head of Government, and [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]] of NCNC was named [[President of Nigeria|President]].\n\nAt Nigeria's independence, the Northern Region gained more seats in parliament than both Eastern and Western regions combined\u2014this would cement Northern dominance in Nigerian politics for years to come. Resentment amongst southern politicians precipitated into political chaos in the country. [[Obafemi Awolowo]], Premier of Western Region, was accused of attempting to overthrow the government. This followed a period of conflict between the AG regional government and the central government. In spite of the flimsiness of the evidence presented by the government's prosecutors, he was convicted. With incarceration of Awolowo, [[Samuel Akintola]] took over as the Premier of Western Region. Because Akintola was an ally of Ahmadu Bello, the undisputed strong man of Nigeria, Akintola was criticized as being a tool of the North.<ref>John de St. Jorre, ''The Nigerian Civil War'' (Hodder and Stroughto Publishers: London, 1972, p. 30</ref>  As premier of the West, Akintola presided over the most chaotic era in Western Region\u2014one which earned it the nickname \"[[Wild West|the Wild-Wild West]]\". However, as late as Thursday, 13 January 1966, Balewa had announced that the federal government was not going to intervene in the West.<ref>John de St. Jorre, ''The Nigerian Civil War'' (Hodder and Stoughton Publishers: London, 1972) p. 30. </ref>  However, the very next day, Akintola, premier of the West met with his ally Ahmadu Bello, the Sardauna of Sokoto, premier of the North and party boss of NPC party to which Balewa belonged.<ref>John de St. Jorre, ''The Nigerian Civil War'', p. 30.</ref>  At the same time a top-level security conference in Lagos was taking place which was attended by most of the country's senior army officiers.

Nigeria is a country of {{convert|923768|km2}}, bound to the west by [[Benin|Benin Republic]], to the north by the [[Niger]] and [[Chad|Chad Republic]], east by the [[Cameroon|Republic of Cameroon]], and south by the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. The country gained independence from the British government on 1 October 1960, and became a republic in 1963. The journey to independence started with some constitutional developments in Nigeria, these constitutional developments saw the country attaining self-rule in some quarters in 1957 and total independence on 1 October 1960.\n\n==Presidents==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Presidents during the Nigerian First Republic\n!

The Nigerian People's Congress (NPC) represented the interests of the predominantly [[Hausa people|Hausa]]/[[Fulani]] Northern Region, the [[National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons]] (NCNC)] (later renamed to \"National Council of Nigerian Citizens\") represented the predominantly [[Igbo people|Igbo]] Eastern Region, and the [[Action Group (Nigeria)|Action Group]] (AG) dominated the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] Western Region. The NPC took control of the federal parliament, and formed a coalition government with the NCNC. The National Independence Party (NIP) formed by Professor Eyo Ita became the second political party in the old Eastern Region.  [[Ahmadu Bello]], the Sardauna of Sokoto, leader of the NPC, was poised to become the Prime Minister, but instead he chose to become the [[Premier]] of the Northern Region, and supported his deputy [[Tafawa Balewa|Tafawa Balewa's]] candidacy for Prime Minister. This raised suspicions amongst the southern politicians, who resented the idea of a federal government controlled by a regional leader through his designated proxy. In the end, Tafawa Balewa of NPC was named Prime Minister and Head of Government, and [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]] of NCNC was named [[President of Nigeria|President]].\n\nAt Nigeria's independence, the Northern Region gained more seats in parliament than both Eastern and Western regions combined\u2014this would cement Northern dominance in Nigerian politics for years to come. Resentment amongst southern politicians precipitated into political chaos in the country. [[Obafemi Awolowo]], Premier of Western Region, was accused of attempting to overthrow the government. This followed a period of conflict between the AG regional government and the central government. In spite of the flimsiness of the evidence presented by the government's prosecutors, he was convicted. With incarceration of Awolowo, [[Samuel Akintola]] took over as the Premier of Western Region. Because Akintola was an ally of Ahmadu Bello, the undisputed strong man of Nigeria, Akintola was criticized as being a tool of the North.<ref>John de St. Jorre, ''The Nigerian Civil War'' (Hodder and Stroughto Publishers: London, 1972, p. 30</ref>  As premier of the West, Akintola presided over the most chaotic era in Western Region\u2014one which earned it the nickname \"[[Wild West|the Wild-Wild West]]\". However, as late as Thursday, 13 January 1966, Balewa had announced that the federal government was not going to intervene in the West.<ref>John de St. Jorre, ''The Nigerian Civil War'' (Hodder and Stoughton Publishers: London, 1972) p. 30. </ref>  However, the very next day, Akintola, premier of the West met with his ally Ahmadu Bello, the Sardauna of Sokoto, premier of the North and party boss of NPC party to which Balewa belonged.<ref>John de St. Jorre, ''The Nigerian Civil War'', p. 30.</ref>  At the same time a top-level security conference in Lagos was taking place which was attended by most of the country's senior army officiers.
