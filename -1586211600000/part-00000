[[Humphreys Peak]], the highest point in Arizona at {{convert|12633|ft}}, is about {{convert|10|mi|km}} north of Flagstaff in [[Kachina Peaks Wilderness]].\n\nOriginally settled by the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Native American cultures in the United States|Native]] [[Sinagua]] people, the area of Flagstaff has fertile land from volcanic ash after eruptions in the 11th century. It was first settled as the present-day city in 1876. The early economy was based on the [[lumber]], railroad, and [[ranching]] industries, and was dominated by the McMillan, Riordan, and Babbitt families. It was also selected as the location for the [[Lowell Observatory]], from which [[Pluto]] was discovered, due to its altitude. The Riordans and Babbitts lobbied for [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] to pass through the city, which it did, turning the local industry to tourism and developing downtown Flagstaff; though it brought [[Okie]]s to the city during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], Route 66 also presented funding opportunities that ultimately improved the economy in the early 1930s. The city developed further through to the end of the 1960s, with various observatories also used to choose [[Moon landing]] sites for the [[List of Apollo missions|Apollo missions]].\n\nThe city remains an important distribution hub for companies such as [[Nestl\u00e9 Purina PetCare]], and is home to the [[United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station|U.S. Naval Observatory]], the [[United States Geological Survey]] Flagstaff, and [[Northern Arizona University]]. Flagstaff has a strong tourism sector, due to its proximity to [[Grand Canyon National Park]], [[Oak Creek Canyon]], the [[Arizona Snowbowl]], [[Meteor Crater]], and [[U.S. Route 66 in Arizona#Historic Route 66|Historic Route 66]]. The city is also a growing center for medical and biotechnology manufacturing, home to corporations such as [[SenesTech]] and [[W. L.

As part of the celebrations, Front Street was renamed Santa Fe Avenue. In 1927, Flagstaff's primary industry was still timber, though farming persisted into the 1920s. The city produced the majority of Arizona's timber supply that year, and was economically powered by the competing Arizona Lumber and Timber and Flagstaff Lumber companies, but in the last years of the decade, tourism took over and the face of the main commercial district changed to diners and motels in place of saloons.<ref name=\":8\" /> In 1928 the [[Museum of Northern Arizona]] opened in the city, and in the same year its workers prevented the destruction of Sunset Crater for use in a movie explosion.<ref name=\":12\" /> \n\nAt the start of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], the massive expansion of Flagstaff and Coconino County during the 1920s was seen as likely unsustainable with a lower income. It was made worse by the [[Okie|unemployed workers]] traveling Route 66 to California stopping in Flagstaff, and young jobless Canadians venturing to the area for exploration having to be supported by the city before being deported. Southard wrote that the \"down-on-their-luck migrants taxed the resources of their host cities, while contributing little to the local economy\".<ref name=\":8\" /> Known as \"auto nomads\" in Flagstaff, out-of-work families relocating to the city with children were particularly taxing on the public school system, and even those that did not stay long became unpopular as they could not afford to buy gas or food.<ref name=\":8\" /> Flagstaff had also been highlighted on the map by [[Clyde Tombaugh]]'s 1930 discovery of [[Pluto]] from the Lowell Observatory; the planet was in part named for Percival Lowell (PL).<ref name=\"USNO\" /><ref name=\":12\" /> However, some Flagstaff residents attempted charitable endeavors, including setting up food banks and imploring hunters in the local area to donate a percentage of each kill to them. This did not last long, as in the winter of 1931\u201332, a rumor that California had closed its borders to [[Midwestern United States|Mid West]] migrants spread through Arizona, with people from places like Flagstaff and [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]], the last cities on major cross-country highways before California, demanding that Arizona be closed to migrants, too.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThe importance of Route 66 to cross-country travel, and thus to Arizona's interests on a national level, did mean that it received a large share of state funding through the Depression, though, with highway maintenance and unemployment acts providing over $1 million of funding in May 1933. Flagstaff's unemployed soon became highway construction workers, and by the end of 1934, Flagstaff had financially recovered to pre-Depression levels, aided by tax cuts and continued tourism; in 1935, many residents had enough disposable income to remodel their homes or build new ones.

[[Humphreys Peak]], the highest point in Arizona at {{convert|12633|ft}}, is about {{convert|10|mi|km}} north of Flagstaff in [[Kachina Peaks Wilderness]].\n\nOriginally settled by the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Native American cultures in the United States|Native]] [[Sinagua]] people, the area of Flagstaff has fertile land from volcanic ash after eruptions in the 11th century. It was first settled as the present-day city in 1876. The early economy was based on the [[lumber]], railroad, and [[ranching]] industries, and was dominated by the McMillan, Riordan, and Babbitt families. It was also selected as the location for the [[Lowell Observatory]], from which [[Pluto]] was discovered, due to its altitude. The Riordans and Babbitts lobbied for [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] to pass through the city, which it did, turning the local industry to tourism and developing downtown Flagstaff; though it brought [[Okie]]s to the city during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], Route 66 also presented funding opportunities that ultimately improved the economy in the early 1930s. The city developed further through to the end of the 1960s, with various observatories also used to choose [[Moon landing]] sites for the [[List of Apollo missions|Apollo missions]].\n\nThe city remains an important distribution hub for companies such as [[Nestl\u00e9 Purina PetCare]], and is home to the [[United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station|U.S. Naval Observatory]], the [[United States Geological Survey]] Flagstaff, and [[Northern Arizona University]]. Flagstaff has a strong tourism sector, due to its proximity to [[Grand Canyon National Park]], [[Oak Creek Canyon]], the [[Arizona Snowbowl]], [[Meteor Crater]], and [[U.S. Route 66 in Arizona#Historic Route 66|Historic Route 66]]. The city is also a growing center for medical and biotechnology manufacturing, home to corporations such as [[SenesTech]] and [[W. L.

As part of the celebrations, Front Street was renamed Santa Fe Avenue. In 1927, Flagstaff's primary industry was still timber, though farming persisted into the 1920s. The city produced the majority of Arizona's timber supply that year, and was economically powered by the competing Arizona Lumber and Timber and Flagstaff Lumber companies, but in the last years of the decade, tourism took over and the face of the main commercial district changed to diners and motels in place of saloons.<ref name=\":8\" /> In 1928 the [[Museum of Northern Arizona]] opened in the city, and in the same year its workers prevented the destruction of Sunset Crater for use in a movie explosion.<ref name=\":12\" /> \n\nAt the start of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], the massive expansion of Flagstaff and Coconino County during the 1920s was seen as likely unsustainable with a lower income. It was made worse by the [[Okie|unemployed workers]] traveling Route 66 to California stopping in Flagstaff, and young jobless Canadians venturing to the area for exploration having to be supported by the city before being deported. Southard wrote that the \"down-on-their-luck migrants taxed the resources of their host cities, while contributing little to the local economy\".<ref name=\":8\" /> Known as \"auto nomads\" in Flagstaff, out-of-work families relocating to the city with children were particularly taxing on the public school system, and even those that did not stay long became unpopular as they could not afford to buy gas or food.<ref name=\":8\" /> Flagstaff had also been highlighted on the map by [[Clyde Tombaugh]]'s 1930 discovery of [[Pluto]] from the Lowell Observatory; the planet was in part named for Percival Lowell (PL).<ref name=\"USNO\" /><ref name=\":12\" /> However, some Flagstaff residents attempted charitable endeavors, including setting up food banks and imploring hunters in the local area to donate a percentage of each kill to them. This did not last long, as in the winter of 1931\u201332, a rumor that California had closed its borders to [[Midwestern United States|Mid West]] migrants spread through Arizona, with people from places like Flagstaff and [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]], the last cities on major cross-country highways before California, demanding that Arizona be closed to migrants, too.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nThe importance of Route 66 to cross-country travel, and thus to Arizona's interests on a national level, did mean that it received a large share of state funding through the Depression, though, with highway maintenance and unemployment acts providing over $1 million of funding in May 1933. Flagstaff's unemployed soon became highway construction workers, and by the end of 1934, Flagstaff had financially recovered to pre-Depression levels, aided by tax cuts and continued tourism; in 1935, many residents had enough disposable income to remodel their homes or build new ones.

The ''Filin'' fires a beam similar to a strobe light that affects enemy's combatants eyesight, making it more difficult for them to aim at night. During testing, volunteers reportedly used rifles and guns to shoot targets that were protected by the system and reported having trouble aiming because they could not see. Additionally, about half of the volunteers said they felt dizzy, nauseous and disoriented. About 20 percent of the volunteers reported experiencing hallucinations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/russia/450489-russian-navy-system-hallucinations/|title=Russian Navy gets new weapon to induce \u2018hallucinations\u2019 and \u2018blind\u2019 the enemy|website=rt.com|date=3 February 2019|access-date=1 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331230015/https://www.rt.com/russia/450489-russian-navy-system-hallucinations/|archive-date=31 March 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://sputniknews.com/military/201903171073319735-filin-light-weapon-details/|title=What Russia's Filin Light-Based 'Weapon of Mass Disorientation' is Capable Of|website=[[Sputnik (news agency)]]|date=17 March 2019|access-date=1 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190331230013/https://sputniknews.com/military/201903171073319735-filin-light-weapon-details/|archive-date=31 March 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://sputniknews.com/military/201903101073108588-russian-optical-weapon/|title=WATCH Russian Ship Test Weapon That Renders Enemy Targeting Systems Useless|website=[[Sputnik (news agency)]]|date=10 March 2019|access-date=14 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190405190255/https://sputniknews.com/military/201903101073108588-russian-optical-weapon/|archive-date=5 April 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://thehill.com/policy/defense/428346-russian-navy-has-new-weapon-that-makes-target-hallucinate-and-vomit-report|title=Russian Navy has new weapon that makes targets hallucinate, vomit: report|website=thehill.com|date=4 February 2019|access-date=14 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425061536/https://thehill.com/policy/defense/428346-russian-navy-has-new-weapon-that-makes-target-hallucinate-and-vomit-report|archive-date=25 April 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2019, the [[Severnoye Design Bureau]] reportedly completed the outline design of the upgraded Project 22350M frigate and began working on the technical documentation for the ship.

The title is a consequence of the [[First Council of Ephesus]] in the fifth century, in which Mary was proclaimed \"[[Theotokos]]\", a title rendered in Latin as ''{{lang|la|Mater Dei}}'', in English \"[[Mother of God]]\".\n\nThe Catholic teaching on this subject is expressed in the papal encyclical ''Ad Caeli Reginam'', issued by [[Pope Pius XII]].{{sfn|Ad Caeli Reginam}} It states that Mary is called Queen of [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]] because her son, [[Jesus Christ]], is the king of Israel and heavenly king of the universe; indeed, the Davidic tradition of Israel recognized the mother of the king as the [[Queen mother|Queen Mother]] of Israel.\n\nThe title \u201cQueen of Heaven\u201d has long been a Catholic tradition, included in [[prayer]]s and [[devotional literature]], and seen in Western art in the subject of the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], from the [[High Middle Ages]], long before it was given a formal definition status by the Church.\n\n==Theological basis==\nQueen of Heaven ({{lang-la|Regina Caeli}}) is one of many Queen titles used of [[Mary, mother of Jesus]]. The title derived in part from the ancient Catholic teaching that Mary, at the end of her earthly life, was bodily and spiritually [[Assumption of Mary|assumed]] into heaven, and that she is there honored as [[Coronation of the Virgin|Queen]].<ref name=\"Otto\">{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Mary |editor-first=John |editor-last=Otto |publisher=Catholic Book Publishing Co. |location=New York |year=1985 |pages=283\u2013284}}</ref>\n\nPius XII explained on the theological reasons for her title of Queen in a radio message to Fatima of May 13, 1946, ''Bendito seja'':<ref>''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]'' 38. 266</ref> <blockquote>He, the Son of God, reflects on His heavenly Mother the glory, the majesty and the dominion of His kingship, for, having been associated to the King of Martyrs in the ... work of human Redemption as Mother and cooperator, she remains forever associated to Him, with a practically unlimited power, in the distribution of the graces which flow from the Redemption. Jesus is King throughout all eternity by nature and by right of conquest: through Him, with Him, and subordinate to Him, Mary is Queen by grace, by divine relationship, by right of conquest, and by singular choice [of the Father].<ref name=most/></blockquote>\n\nIn his 1954 encyclical ''[[Ad caeli reginam]]'' (\"To the Queen of Heaven\"), Pius XII asserts that Mary deserves the title because she is Mother of God, because she is closely associated as the New Eve with Jesus' redemptive work, because of her preeminent perfection and because of her intercessory power.<ref name=foley/> ''Ad caeli reginam'' states that the main principle on which the royal dignity of Mary rests is her Divine Motherhood. ... So with complete justice St. John Damascene could write: \"When she became Mother of the Creator, she truly became Queen of every creature.\".{{sfn|Ad Caeli Reginam|loc=section 34}}\n\n==Biblical basis ==\nIn the Hebrew Bible, under some Davidic kings, the [[gebirah]], the \"Great Lady\", usually the Mother of the King, held great power as advocate with the king. In 1 Kings 2:20, Solomon said to his Mother Bathsheba, seated on a throne at his right, \"Make your request, Mother, for I will not refuse you.\" William G. Most sees here a sort of type of Mary.<ref name=most/>\n[[File:Santa Marija Assunta.jpg|thumb|right|A statue of the [[Assumption of Mary]] typically crowned with 12 stars. A reflection of the biblical image in Revelation 12. Statue by Attard, [[Malta]].]]\nIn the New Testament, the title has several biblical sources. At the Annunciation, the archangel Gabriel announces that [Jesus] \"... will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David. He will rule over the house of Jacob forever and his reign will be without end.\"(Luke 1:32) The biblical precedent in ancient Israel is that the mother of the king becomes the queen mother.<ref>Taylor Marshall, ''The Crucified Rabbi: Judaism and the Origins of Catholic Christianity'', Saint John Press, 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-578-03834-6}} page 41</ref>  Mary's queenship is a share in Jesus\u2019 kingship.<ref name=foley>[http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1115 Foley O.F.M., Leonard. ''Saint of the Day, Lives, Lessons, and Feast'', (revised by Pat McCloskey O.F.M.), Franciscan Media] {{ISBN|978-0-86716-887-7}}</ref>\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church views Mary as the woman clothed with the sun in the [[Book of Revelation]] 12:1\u20133: \"A great and wondrous sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth. Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on his heads.\" The Church accepts Revelation 12 as a reference to Mary, Israel, and the Church as a three-fold symbolism through the Book of Isaiah and affirms Mary as the mother of Jesus as the prophetic fulfilment described in Revelation 12 (cf. Isaiah 7:14, 26:17, 54:1, 66:7).<ref name=\"Rev12\">[http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/religion/re0769.html Saunder, Rev.

The prophet [[Jeremiah]] writing circa 628 BC refers to a \"queen of heaven\" in chapters 7 and 44 of the [[Book of Jeremiah]] when he scolds the people for having \"sinned against the Lord\" due to their idolatrous practices of burning incense, making cakes, and pouring out drink offerings to her. This title was probably given to [[Asherah]], a [[Canaanite]] idol and goddess worshipped in ancient Israel and Judah.<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=30&chapter=7&verse=18&version=31&context=verse Biblegateway Jeremiah]</ref> For a discussion of \"queen of heaven\" in the [[Hebrew Bible]], see [[Queen of heaven (Antiquity)]].\n\n==Historical practice==\n[[File:Fra Angelico 082.jpg|thumb|Fra Angelico, c. 1434-35]]\nIn the fourth century St. Ephrem called Mary \"Lady\" and \"Queen\". Later Church fathers and doctors continued to use the title. A text probably coming from Origen (died {{circa|254}}) gives her the title domina, the feminine form of Latin dominus, Lord. That same title also appears in many other early writers, e.g., [[Jerome]], and [[Peter Chrysologus]]. The first [[Roman Catholic Mariology|Mariological]] definition and basis for the title of ''Mary Queen of Heaven'' developed at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], where Mary was defined to be the Mother of God. The Council fathers specifically approved this version against the opinion, that Mary is \"only\" the mother of Jesus. Nobody had participated in the life of her son more, than Mary, who gave birth to the Son of God.{{sfn|Fastenrath|Tschochner|1991|p=590}}\n\nThe word \"Queen\" is common during and after the sixth century.<ref name=most>[http://www.ewtn.com/faith/teachings/marya6.htm Most, William G. \"Mary's Queenship\", ''Our Lady in Doctrine and Devotion'', 1994]</ref> Hymns of the 11th to 13th centuries address Mary as queen: \u201cHail, Holy Queen,\u201d \u201cHail, Queen of Heaven,\u201d \u201cQueen of Heaven.\u201d The Dominican rosary and the Franciscan crown as well as numerous invocations in Mary\u2019s litany celebrate her queenship.<ref name=foley/>  For centuries she has been invoked as the Queen of Heaven.<ref name=gandolpho/>\n\n==Litany of Loreto==\n[[File:Coronation-of-the-Virgin.jpg|thumb|Rubens, 1609]]\nShe is invoked in the [[Litany of Loreto]] as:\n* Queen of the Angels, \n* Queen of Patriarchs,\n* Queen of Prophets, \n* Queen of Apostles, \n* Queen of Martyrs, \n* Queen of Confessors, \n* Queen of Virgins, \n* Queen of all Saints\n* Queen of Families.<ref name=gandolpho/>\n* Queen conceived without original sin\n* Queen assumed into Heaven\n* Queen of the Most Holy Rosary\n* Queen of Peace<ref>[http://www.thequeenofangels.com/mary-the-queen/the-queenship-of-mary/ Pope Paul VI, ''Christi Matris'', 1966]</ref>\n\n=== Other titles ===\n\nThe [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964 referred to Mary as ''Queen of the Universe''.<ref name=\"lumengentium59\">[https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html ''Lumen gentium'', Chapter 8, Section 59.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906031754/https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html |date=September 6, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Liturgy of the Hours ==\n[[File:Beslotentuinfeest.jpg|thumb|180px|Crowned statue of [[Our Lady of Sorrows]], [[Warfhuizen]], the Netherlands.]]\n\nThe four ancient Marian [[antiphon]]s of the Liturgy of the Hours express the queenship of Mary: the ''[[Salve Regina]]'', the ''[[Ave Regina caelorum]]'', the ''[[Alma Redemptoris Mater]]'', and the ''[[Regina Caeli]]''. These are prayed at different times of the year, at the end of [[Compline]].\n\n=== ''Salve Regina'' ===\n{{Main|Salve Regina}}\nMary as Queen of Heaven is praised in the ''[[Salve Regina]]'' \"(Hail Queen)\", which is sung in the time from Trinity Sunday until the Saturday before the first Sunday of Advent. In the vernacular, as a prayer to the Virgin Mary, the Hail Holy Queen is the final prayer of the Rosary. A German [[Benedictine]] monk, [[Hermann of Reichenau]] (1013\u20131054), allegedly composed it and it originally appeared in Latin, the prevalent language of the Catholic Church until [[Vatican II]]. Traditionally it has been sung in Latin, though many translations exist. In the Middle Ages, ''Salve Regina'' offices were held every Saturday.<ref>Marienlexikon, 648</ref>{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}} In the 13th century, the custom developed to greet the Queen of Heaven with the ''Salve Regina'', which is considered the oldest of the four Marian antiphons. As a part of the [[Catholic Reformation]], the ''Salve Regina'' was prayed every Saturday by members of the [[Sodality of Our Lady]], a Jesuit Marian congregation. The ''Hail Holy Queen'' is also the final prayer of the Rosary.\n\n=== ''Ave Regina caelorum'' ===\n{{Main|Ave Regina caelorum}}\nThe ''[[Ave Regina caelorum]]'' (Hail, Queen of Heaven) is an early Marian antiphon, praising Mary, the Queen of Heaven. It is traditionally said or sung after each of the [[canonical hours]] of the Liturgy of the Hours. The prayer is used especially after [[Compline]], the final canonical hour of prayer before going to sleep. It is prayed from the [[Feast of the Presentation]] (February 2) through the Wednesday of Holy Week. It used to be sung on the feast of the [[Assumption of Mary]]. The ''Ave Regina caelorum'' dates back in a different musical intonation to the 12th century.<ref>C Bernt Marienlexikon 321</ref>{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}} Today's version is slightly different from a 12th-century intonation. The ''Ave Regina caelorum'' has four parts: ''Ave'', ''Salve'', ''Gaude'' and ''Vale'' (in English: hail, rejoice, farewell). It was used for processions in honour of the ''Queen of Heaven.'' The ''Ave Regina caelorum'' received numerous musical versions, a famous one of which was composed in 1773 by Joseph Haydn.<ref name=\"Haydn, in Marienlexikon, 88\">Haydn, in Marienlexikon, 88</ref>{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n=== ''Alma Redemptoris Mater'' ===\n{{Main|Alma Redemptoris Mater}}\n[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 079.jpg|right|thumb|180px|''The coronation of the Virgin Mary'' by [[Rubens]], {{circa|1625}}]]\nThe ''[[Alma Redemptoris Mater]]'' (Loving Mother of our Savior) is recited in the Catholic Church at Compline only from the first Sunday in Advent until the Feast of the Purification (February 2). Continuing theological discussions exist as to the origin and exact timing of this Marian antiphon. It has two equal parts: The Virgin Mary is the loving Mother of the Savior, the ever-virgin with a very high position in heaven.

Together with three other Marian [[anthems]], it was incorporated in the Minorite Roman Curia Office, which the Franciscans soon popularized everywhere, and which by order of [[Pope Nicholas III]] (1277\u20131280) replaced all the older [[breviary|breviaries]] in the churches of Rome.{{sfn|Henry|1913}}\n\n==Veneration==\nThe Catholic faith states, as a dogma, that Mary was assumed into heaven and is with [[Jesus Christ]], her divine son. Mary should be called Queen, not only because of her [[Divinity|Divine]] [[Motherhood]] of Jesus Christ, but also because God has willed her to have an exceptional role in the work of eternal [[salvation]]. [[Roman Catholicism]] employs the liturgical Latin phrase ''[[Catholicism|Ora Pro Nobis]]'', meaning ''pray for us'', and does not teach adherents to worship saints, but rather ask (asking is a form of prayer) those saints to pray for them.  The encyclical ''[[Ad Caeli Reginam]]'' maintains that Christ as redeemer is Lord and King. The [[BVM(RC)|Blessed Virgin]] is Queen, because of the unique manner in which she assisted in our [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]], by giving of her own substance, by freely offering Him for us, by her singular desire and petition for, and active interest.{{sfn|Ad Caeli Reginam|loc=section 38}} Mary was chosen Mother of Christ so she might help fulfill God's plan in the redemption of humankind; The Catholic Church from the earliest times venerated the Queen of Heaven, according to Pius XII:\n{{quote|From the earliest ages of the Catholic Church a Christian people, whether in time of triumph or more especially in time of crisis, has addressed prayers of petition and hymns of praise and veneration to the '''Queen of Heaven''' and never has that hope wavered which they placed in the Mother of the Divine King, Jesus Christ; nor has that faith ever failed by which we are taught that Mary, the Virgin Mother of God, reigns with a mother's solicitude over the entire world, just as she is crowned in heavenly blessedness with the glory of a Queen.{{sfn|Ad Caeli Reginam|loc=section 1}}}}\n\nThe Queenship of Mary is commemorated in the last of the Glorious Mysteries of the Holy Rosary\u2014the Coronation of the Virgin as Queen of Heaven and Earth.\n\nParishes and private groups often process and crown an image of Mary with flowers. This often is referred to as a \"May Crowning\". This rite may be done on solemnities and feasts of the Blessed Virgin Mary, or other festive days, and offers the Church a chance to reflect on Mary\u2019s role in the history of salvation.<ref name=lewis>[http://www.pastoralliturgy.org/resources/0703CrowningImageOfBVM.php Lewis, Suzaanne M. \"Crowning an Image of the Blessed Virgin Mary\", ''Pastoral Liturgy'']</ref>\n\nThe Virgin has been called \"Queen of France\" since 1638 when, partly in thanksgiving for a victory over the Huguenots and also in hope of the birth of an heir after years of childless marriage, Louis XIII officially gave her that title.

She carries her divine son in her hands, or holds him. After he ascended into heaven, he reigns in divine glory. Mary, his mother, assumed into heaven by her son, participates in his heavenly glory.\n\nThe earliest known Roman depiction of ''Santa Maria Regina'' depicting Mary as a queen dates to the 6th century and is found in the modest church of [[Santa Maria Antiqua]] (i.e., ancient St. Mary) built in the 5th century in the [[Forum Romanum]]. Here Mary is unequivocally depicted as an empress.<ref>Erik Thun\u00f8, 2003 ''Image and relic: mediating the sacred in early medieval Rome'' {{ISBN|88-8265-217-3}} page 34</ref><ref>Bissera V.

Also in the 8th century, the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] decreed that such pictures of Mary should be venerated.{{sfn|Fastenrath|Tschochner|1991|p=590}}\n\nIn the early 16th century, Protestant reformers began to discourage [[Marian art in the Catholic Church|Marian art]], and some like [[John Calvin]] or [[Zwingli]] even encouraged its destruction. But after the [[Council of Trent]] in the mid-16th century confirmed the veneration of [[Marian art in the Catholic Church|Marian paintings]] for Catholics, Mary was often painted as a Madonna with crown, surrounded by stars, standing on top of the world or the partly visible moon. After the victory against the Turks at Lepanto, Mary is depicted as the Queen of Victory, sometimes wearing the crown of the Habsburg empire.{{sfn|Fastenrath|Tschochner|1991|p=595}} National interpretations existed in France as well, where [[Jean Fouquet]] painted the Queen of Heaven in 1450 with the face of the mistress of King [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]]{{sfn|Fastenrath|Tschochner|1991|p=596}} Statues and pictures of Mary were crowned by kings in [[Poland]], France, [[Bavaria]], [[Hungary]] and Austria,{{sfn|Fastenrath|Tschochner|1991|p=596}} sometimes apparently using crowns previously worn by earthly monarchs. A surviving small crown presented by [[Margaret of York]] seems to have been that worn by her at her wedding to [[Charles the Bold]] in 1463. A recent coronation was that of the picture of the ''[[Salus Populi Romani]]'' in 1954 by [[Pius XII]]. The veneration of Mary as queen continues into the 21st Century, but artistic expressions do not have the leading role as in previous times{{sfn|Fastenrath|Tschochner|1991|p=596}}\n\nArtworks, including paintings, mosaics and carvings of the coronation of Mary as Queen of Heaven, became increasingly popular from the 13th century onward. Works follow a set pattern, showing Mary kneeling in the [[Throne of God|heavenly court]], and being crowned either by Jesus alone, or else by Jesus and God the Father together, with the Holy Spirit, usually in the form of a dove, completing the [[Trinity]]. The Coronation of Mary is almost entirely a theme of western art.

Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on his heads.\" The Church accepts Revelation 12 as a reference to Mary, Israel, and the Church as a three-fold symbolism through the Book of Isaiah and affirms Mary as the mother of Jesus as the prophetic fulfilment described in Revelation 12 (cf. Isaiah 7:14, 26:17, 54:1, 66:7).<ref name=\"Rev12\">[http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/religion/re0769.html Saunder, Rev.

The prophet [[Jeremiah]] writing circa 628 BC refers to a \"queen of heaven\" in chapters 7 and 44 of the [[Book of Jeremiah]] when he scolds the people for having \"sinned against the Lord\" due to their idolatrous practices of burning incense, making cakes, and pouring out drink offerings to her. This title was probably given to [[Asherah]], a [[Caananite]] idol and goddess worshipped in ancient Israel and Judah.<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=30&chapter=7&verse=18&version=31&context=verse Biblegateway Jeremiah]</ref> For a discussion of \"queen of heaven\" in the [[Hebrew Bible]], see [[Queen of heaven (Antiquity)]].\n\n==Historical practice==\n[[File:Fra Angelico 082.jpg|thumb|Fra Angelico, c. 1434-35]]\nIn the fourth century St. Ephrem called Mary \"Lady\" and \"Queen\". Later Church fathers and doctors continued to use the title. A text probably coming from Origen (died {{circa|254}}) gives her the title domina, the feminine form of Latin dominus, Lord. That same title also appears in many other early writers, e.g., [[Jerome]], and [[Peter Chrysologus]]. The first [[Roman Catholic Mariology|Mariological]] definition and basis for the title of ''Mary Queen of Heaven'' developed at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], where Mary was defined to be the Mother of God. The Council fathers specifically approved this version against the opinion, that Mary is \"only\" the mother of Jesus. Nobody had participated in the life of her son more, than Mary, who gave birth to the Son of God.{{sfn|Fastenrath|Tschochner|1991|p=590}}\n\nThe word \"Queen\" is common during and after the sixth century.<ref name=most>[http://www.ewtn.com/faith/teachings/marya6.htm Most, William G. \"Mary's Queenship\", ''Our Lady in Doctrine and Devotion'', 1994]</ref> Hymns of the 11th to 13th centuries address Mary as queen: \u201cHail, Holy Queen,\u201d \u201cHail, Queen of Heaven,\u201d \u201cQueen of Heaven.\u201d The Dominican rosary and the Franciscan crown as well as numerous invocations in Mary\u2019s litany celebrate her queenship.<ref name=foley/>  For centuries she has been invoked as the Queen of Heaven.<ref name=gandolpho/>\n\n==Litany of Loreto==\n[[File:Coronation-of-the-Virgin.jpg|thumb|Rubens, 1609]]\nShe is invoked in the [[Litany of Loreto]] as:\n* Queen of the Angels, \n* Queen of Patriarchs,\n* Queen of Prophets, \n* Queen of Apostles, \n* Queen of Martyrs, \n* Queen of Confessors, \n* Queen of Virgins, \n* Queen of all Saints\n* Queen of Families.<ref name=gandolpho/>\n* Queen conceived without original sin\n* Queen assumed into Heaven\n* Queen of the Most Holy Rosary\n* Queen of Peace<ref>[http://www.thequeenofangels.com/mary-the-queen/the-queenship-of-mary/ Pope Paul VI, ''Christi Matris'', 1966]</ref>\n\n=== Other titles ===\n\nThe [[Second Vatican Council]] in 1964 referred to Mary as ''Queen of the Universe''.<ref name=\"lumengentium59\">[https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html ''Lumen gentium'', Chapter 8, Section 59.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906031754/https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19641121_lumen-gentium_en.html |date=September 6, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Liturgy of the Hours ==\n[[File:Beslotentuinfeest.jpg|thumb|180px|Crowned statue of [[Our Lady of Sorrows]], [[Warfhuizen]], the Netherlands.]]\n\nThe four ancient Marian [[antiphon]]s of the Liturgy of the Hours express the queenship of Mary: the ''[[Salve Regina]]'', the ''[[Ave Regina caelorum]]'', the ''[[Alma Redemptoris Mater]]'', and the ''[[Regina Caeli]]''. These are prayed at different times of the year, at the end of [[Compline]].\n\n=== ''Salve Regina'' ===\n{{Main|Salve Regina}}\nMary as Queen of Heaven is praised in the ''[[Salve Regina]]'' \"(Hail Queen)\", which is sung in the time from Trinity Sunday until the Saturday before the first Sunday of Advent. In the vernacular, as a prayer to the Virgin Mary, the Hail Holy Queen is the final prayer of the Rosary. A German [[Benedictine]] monk, [[Hermann of Reichenau]] (1013\u20131054), allegedly composed it and it originally appeared in Latin, the prevalent language of the Catholic Church until [[Vatican II]]. Traditionally it has been sung in Latin, though many translations exist. In the Middle Ages, ''Salve Regina'' offices were held every Saturday.<ref>Marienlexikon, 648</ref>{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}} In the 13th century, the custom developed to greet the Queen of Heaven with the ''Salve Regina'', which is considered the oldest of the four Marian antiphons. As a part of the [[Catholic Reformation]], the ''Salve Regina'' was prayed every Saturday by members of the [[Sodality of Our Lady]], a Jesuit Marian congregation. The ''Hail Holy Queen'' is also the final prayer of the Rosary.\n\n=== ''Ave Regina caelorum'' ===\n{{Main|Ave Regina caelorum}}\nThe ''[[Ave Regina caelorum]]'' (Hail, Queen of Heaven) is an early Marian antiphon, praising Mary, the Queen of Heaven. It is traditionally said or sung after each of the [[canonical hours]] of the Liturgy of the Hours. The prayer is used especially after [[Compline]], the final canonical hour of prayer before going to sleep. It is prayed from the [[Feast of the Presentation]] (February 2) through the Wednesday of Holy Week. It used to be sung on the feast of the [[Assumption of Mary]]. The ''Ave Regina caelorum'' dates back in a different musical intonation to the 12th century.<ref>C Bernt Marienlexikon 321</ref>{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}} Today's version is slightly different from a 12th-century intonation. The ''Ave Regina caelorum'' has four parts: ''Ave'', ''Salve'', ''Gaude'' and ''Vale'' (in English: hail, rejoice, farewell). It was used for processions in honour of the ''Queen of Heaven.'' The ''Ave Regina caelorum'' received numerous musical versions, a famous one of which was composed in 1773 by Joseph Haydn.<ref name=\"Haydn, in Marienlexikon, 88\">Haydn, in Marienlexikon, 88</ref>{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n=== ''Alma Redemptoris Mater'' ===\n{{Main|Alma Redemptoris Mater}}\n[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 079.jpg|right|thumb|180px|''The coronation of the Virgin Mary'' by [[Rubens]], {{circa|1625}}]]\nThe ''[[Alma Redemptoris Mater]]'' (Loving Mother of our Savior) is recited in the Catholic Church at Compline only from the first Sunday in Advent until the Feast of the Purification (February 2). Continuing theological discussions exist as to the origin and exact timing of this Marian antiphon. It has two equal parts: The Virgin Mary is the loving Mother of the Savior, the ever-virgin with a very high position in heaven.

Different musical settings of the words were composed throughout the centuries by known and unknown composers. Not all attributions are correct, as an often quoted ''Regina Caeli'' by [[Joseph Haydn]] was not by him.<ref name=\"Haydn, in Marienlexikon, 88\"/> The anthem is of unknown authorship, and was in [[Franciscan]] use in the first half of the 13th century. Together with three other Marian [[anthems]], it was incorporated in the Minorite Roman Curia Office, which the Franciscans soon popularized everywhere, and which by order of [[Pope Nicholas III]] (1277\u20131280) replaced all the older [[breviary|breviaries]] in the churches of Rome.{{sfn|Henry|1913}}\n\n==Veneration==\nThe Catholic faith states, as a dogma, that Mary was assumed into heaven and is with [[Jesus Christ]], her divine son. Mary should be called Queen, not only because of her [[Divinity|Divine]] [[Motherhood]] of Jesus Christ, but also because God has willed her to have an exceptional role in the work of eternal [[salvation]]. [[Roman Catholicism]] employs the liturgical Latin phrase ''[[Catholicism|Ora Pro Nobis]]'', meaning ''pray for us'', and does not teach adherents to worship saints, but rather ask (asking is a form of prayer) those saints to pray for them.  The encyclical ''[[Ad Caeli Reginam]]'' maintains that Christ as redeemer is Lord and King. The [[BVM(RC)|Blessed Virgin]] is Queen, because of the unique manner in which she assisted in our [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]], by giving of her own substance, by freely offering Him for us, by her singular desire and petition for, and active interest.{{sfn|Ad Caeli Reginam|loc=section 38}} Mary was chosen Mother of Christ so she might help fulfill God's plan in the redemption of humankind; The Catholic Church from the earliest times venerated the Queen of Heaven, according to Pius XII:\n{{quote|From the earliest ages of the Catholic Church a Christian people, whether in time of triumph or more especially in time of crisis, has addressed prayers of petition and hymns of praise and veneration to the '''Queen of Heaven''' and never has that hope wavered which they placed in the Mother of the Divine King, Jesus Christ; nor has that faith ever failed by which we are taught that Mary, the Virgin Mother of God, reigns with a mother's solicitude over the entire world, just as she is crowned in heavenly blessedness with the glory of a Queen.{{sfn|Ad Caeli Reginam|loc=section 1}}}}\n\nThe Queenship of Mary is commemorated in the last of the Glorious Mysteries of the Holy Rosary\u2014the Coronation of the Virgin as Queen of Heaven and Earth.\n\nParishes and private groups often process and crown an image of Mary with flowers. This often is referred to as a \"May Crowning\". This rite may be done on solemnities and feasts of the Blessed Virgin Mary, or other festive days, and offers the Church a chance to reflect on Mary\u2019s role in the history of salvation.<ref name=lewis>[http://www.pastoralliturgy.org/resources/0703CrowningImageOfBVM.php Lewis, Suzaanne M. \"Crowning an Image of the Blessed Virgin Mary\", ''Pastoral Liturgy'']</ref>\n\nThe Virgin has been called \"Queen of France\" since 1638 when, partly in thanksgiving for a victory over the Huguenots and also in hope of the birth of an heir after years of childless marriage, Louis XIII officially gave her that title.

Mary, his mother, assumed into heaven by her son, participates in his heavenly glory.\n\nThe earliest known Roman depiction of ''Santa Maria Regina'' depicting Mary as a queen dates to the 6th century and is found in the modest church of [[Santa Maria Antiqua]] (i.e., ancient St. Mary) built in the 5th century in the [[Forum Romanum]].

But after the [[Council of Trent]] in the mid-16th century confirmed the veneration of [[Marian art in the Catholic Church|Marian paintings]] for Catholics, Mary was often painted as a Madonna with crown, surrounded by stars, standing on top of the world or the partly visible moon. After the victory against the Turks at Lepanto, Mary is depicted as the Queen of Victory, sometimes wearing the crown of the Habsburg empire.{{sfn|Fastenrath|Tschochner|1991|p=595}} National interpretations existed in France as well, where [[Jean Fouquet]] painted the Queen of Heaven in 1450 with the face of the mistress of King [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]]{{sfn|Fastenrath|Tschochner|1991|p=596}} Statues and pictures of Mary were crowned by kings in [[Poland]], France, [[Bavaria]], [[Hungary]] and Austria,{{sfn|Fastenrath|Tschochner|1991|p=596}} sometimes apparently using crowns previously worn by earthly monarchs. A surviving small crown presented by [[Margaret of York]] seems to have been that worn by her at her wedding to [[Charles the Bold]] in 1463. A recent coronation was that of the picture of the ''[[Salus Populi Romani]]'' in 1954 by [[Pius XII]]. The veneration of Mary as queen continues into the 21st Century, but artistic expressions do not have the leading role as in previous times{{sfn|Fastenrath|Tschochner|1991|p=596}}\n\nArtworks, including paintings, mosaics and carvings of the coronation of Mary as Queen of Heaven, became increasingly popular from the 13th century onward. Works follow a set pattern, showing Mary kneeling in the [[Throne of God|heavenly court]], and being crowned either by Jesus alone, or else by Jesus and God the Father together, with the Holy Spirit, usually in the form of a dove, completing the [[Trinity]]. The Coronation of Mary is almost entirely a theme of western art.

It analyzes sources, including the [[New Testament]] and non-[[Biblical canon|canon]]ical works.  The latter include the ''[[agrapha]]'',  the [[apocryphal gospels]] (such as the  ''[[Gospel of Thomas]]''), [[Josephus]], and other Jewish and second-century Roman works.  For deciding what comes from Jesus as distinct from early Christian tradition it proposes these ''primary criteria'' (pp.&nbsp;168\u201377):\n:1. The [[criterion of embarrassment]]: Why invent what would invite difficulty for the early church?\n:2. The criterion of discontinuity:  Why reject as words or deeds of Jesus what cannot be derived from the Judaism of Jesus' time or the early church?\n:3. The [[criterion of multiple attestation]]:  Is it more plausible to deny words, sayings, or deeds attributed to Jesus in more than one independent literary source (e.g., [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Q document|Q]],  [[Pauline epistles|Paul]], and [[Gospel of John|John]]) or literary genre (e.g., parable, miracle story, or prophecy)?\n:4.  The criterion of coherence:  Given the claims to historicity from any of the above criteria, are different sayings or deeds evidently inconsistent?\n:5.  The criterion of rejection and execution:  If Jesus' ministry came to a violent, public end, what of Jesus' words or deeds could have alienated people, especially powerful people?\nThe criteria are to be used in concert for mutual correction.  Still, any claim is only to the probable, not the certain.  The rest of Volume 1 discusses the origins of [[Jesus]] as to formative years,  \"external\" influences (language, education, and socioeconomic status), and \"internal\" influences (family ties and marital and lay status).  The volume concludes with a survey of [[Chronology of Jesus|Jesus' life chronology]].<ref>John P. Meier, 1991. ''The Roots of the Problem and the Person'', [[Yale University Press]].</ref>\n\nOn the question of references to [[Jesus in the Talmud]], Meier considers the thesis of [[Joseph Klausner]] (1925) that some very few rabbinic sources, none earlier than about the late 2nd or early 3rd century, contain traces of the [[historical Jesus]].  He presents further considerations and arguments, including those of [[Johann Maier (talmudic scholar)]] (1978) who maintains that the ''Yeshu'' texts are later medieval corruptions, and writes that:\n:While not accepting the full, radical approach of Maier, I think we can agree with him on one basic point: in the earliest rabbinic sources, there is no clear or even probable reference to Jesus of Nazareth. Furthermore, ... when we do finally find such references in later rabbinic literature, they are most probably reactions to Christian claims, oral or written.<ref>John P. Meier, 1991. ''A Marginal Jew'', v. 1 pp. 95, 97-98.</ref>\n\n===Volume 2===\nVolume 2 (1994) is in three main parts:\n* Jesus' relationship to [[John the Baptist]] (as 'mentor')\n* Jesus' message of the [[kingdom of God]]\n* accounts of [[Miracles of Jesus|Jesus' miracles]] in ancient and modern minds.\nThe kingdom of God in the second part (pp.&nbsp;235\u2013506) is examined as to:\n*the [[Old Testament]], related writings, and [[Qumran]]\n* Jesus' [[kerygma|proclamation]] of a future kingdom\n* the kingdom proclaimed by Jesus' words and deeds as already present in his ministry (pp.&nbsp;451\u201353).\n\nThe third part applies the same criteria of historicity to miracle stories as to other aspects of Jesus' life.  Rather than adopting say an exclusively agnostic or Christian perspective or relying on philosophical arguments whether miracles can occur, it poses narrower data-based historical questions (pp.&nbsp;510\u201311, 517). Meier is quoted in a  1997 interview as saying: \"The proper stance of a historian is, 'I neither claim beforehand that miracles are possible, nor do I claim beforehand they are not possible.'\"<ref>John Bookser Feister, 1997. \"Finding the Historical Jesus:An Interview With John P. Meier,\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20001207233900/http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/Dec1997/feature3.asp] ''Saint Anthony Messenger'', December.</ref> Meier finds that Jesus' performance of extraordinary deeds deemed miracles at the time is best supported by the criteria of multiple attestation and the coherence of Jesus' deeds and words (p.&nbsp;630).  In moving from the global question of miracles to the particular,  Meier examines each miracle story by broad category.  That examination drives the conclusion that no single theory explains all such stories with equal assurance and applicability. Rather, it is suggested that some stories have no historical basis (such as the [[Cursing the fig tree|cursing of the fig tree]]) and that other stories likely go back to events in the life of Jesus (though theological judgment is required to affirm any miracle) (p.&nbsp;968). At the global level again, Jesus as healer is as well supported as almost anything about the historical Jesus.

It analyzes sources, including the [[New Testament]] and non-[[Biblical canon|canon]]ical works.  The latter include the ''[[agrapha]]'',  the [[apocryphal gospels]] (such as the  ''[[Gospel of Thomas]]''), [[Josephus]], and other Jewish and second-century Roman works.  For deciding what comes from Jesus as distinct from early Christian tradition it proposes these ''primary criteria'' (pp.&nbsp;168\u201377):\n:1. The [[criterion of embarrassment]]: Why invent what would invite difficulty for the early church?\n:2. The criterion of discontinuity:  Why reject as words or deeds of Jesus what cannot be derived from the Judaism of Jesus' time or the early church?\n:3. The [[criterion of multiple attestation]]:  Is it more plausible to deny words, sayings, or deeds attributed to Jesus in more than one independent literary source (e.g., [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Q document|Q]],  [[Pauline epistles|Paul]], and [[Gospel of John|John]]) or literary genre (e.g., parable, miracle story, or prophecy)?\n:4.  The criterion of coherence:  Given the claims to historicity from any of the above criteria, are different sayings or deeds evidently inconsistent?\n:5.  The criterion of rejection and execution:  If Jesus' ministry came to a violent, public end, what of Jesus' words or deeds could have alienated people, especially powerful people?\nThe criteria are to be used in concert for mutual correction.  Still, any claim is only to the probable, not the certain.  The rest of Volume 1 discusses the origins of [[Jesus]] as to formative years,  \"external\" influences (language, education, and socioeconomic status), and \"internal\" influences (family ties and marital and lay status).  The volume concludes with a survey of [[Chronology of Jesus|Jesus' life chronology]].<ref>John P. Meier, 1991. ''The Roots of the Problem and the Person'', [[Yale University Press]].</ref>\n\nOn the question of references to [[Jesus in the Talmud]], Meier considers the thesis of [[Joseph Klausner]] (1925) that some very few rabbinic sources, none earlier than about than late 2nd or early 3rd century, contain traces of the [[historical Jesus]].  He presents further considerations and arguments, including those of [[Johann Maier (talmudic scholar)]] (1978) who maintains that the ''Yeshu'' texts are later medieval corruptions, and writes that:\n:While not accepting the full, radical approach of Maier, I think we can agree with him on one basic point: in the earliest rabbinic sources, there is no clear or even probable reference to Jesus of Nazareth. Furthermore, ... when we do finally find such references in later rabbinic literature, they are most probably reactions to Christian claims, oral or written.<ref>John P. Meier, 1991. ''A Marginal Jew'', v. 1 pp. 95, 97-98.</ref>\n\n===Volume 2===\nVolume 2 (1994) is in three main parts:\n* Jesus' relationship to [[John the Baptist]] (as 'mentor')\n* Jesus' message of the [[kingdom of God]]\n* accounts of [[Miracles of Jesus|Jesus' miracles]] in ancient and modern minds.\nThe kingdom of God in the second part (pp.&nbsp;235\u2013506) is examined as to:\n*the [[Old Testament]], related writings, and [[Qumran]]\n* Jesus' [[kerygma|proclamation]] of a future kingdom\n* the kingdom proclaimed by Jesus' words and deeds as already present in his ministry (pp.&nbsp;451\u201353).\n\nThe third part applies the same criteria of historicity to miracle stories as to other aspects of Jesus' life.  Rather than adopting say an exclusively agnostic or Christian perspective or relying on philosophical arguments whether miracles can occur, it poses narrower data-based historical questions (pp.&nbsp;510\u201311, 517). Meier is quoted in a  1997 interview as saying: \"The proper stance of a historian is, 'I neither claim beforehand that miracles are possible, nor do I claim beforehand they are not possible.'\"<ref>John Bookser Feister, 1997. \"Finding the Historical Jesus:An Interview With John P. Meier,\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20001207233900/http://www.americancatholic.org/Messenger/Dec1997/feature3.asp] ''Saint Anthony Messenger'', December.</ref> Meier finds that Jesus' performance of extraordinary deeds deemed miracles at the time is best supported by the criteria of multiple attestation and the coherence of Jesus' deeds and words (p.&nbsp;630).  In moving from the global question of miracles to the particular,  Meier examines each miracle story by broad category.  That examination drives the conclusion that no single theory explains all such stories with equal assurance and applicability. Rather, it is suggested that some stories have no historical basis (such as the [[Cursing the fig tree|cursing of the fig tree]]) and that other stories likely go back to events in the life of Jesus (though theological judgment is required to affirm any miracle) (p.&nbsp;968). At the global level again, Jesus as healer is as well supported as almost anything about the historical Jesus.  In the Gospels, the activity of Jesus as miracle worker looms large in attracting attention to himself and reinforces his [[eschatology|eschatological]] message.  Such activity, Meier suggests, might have added to the concern of authorities that culminated in Jesus' death (p.&nbsp;970).<ref>John P. Meier, 1994.
