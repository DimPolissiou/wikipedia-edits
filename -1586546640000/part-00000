Reclaiming was founded in 1979, in the context of the ''Reclaiming Collective'' (1978\u20131997), by two [[Modern paganism|Neopagan]] women of [[Jews|Jewish]] descent, [[Starhawk]] and Diane Baker, in order to explore and develop feminist Neopagan emancipatory rituals.<ref>Salomonsen (2002:1)</ref>\n\nToday, the organization focuses on progressive social, political, environmental and economic activism.<ref>{{Cite book\n | author = Starhawk\n | title = The Five-Point Agenda\n | year = 1995\n | publisher = Reclaiming\n | url = http://www.reclaiming.org/about/directions/fivepoint-agenda.html\n | accessdate = 10 September 2012 | author-link = Starhawk\n }}</ref> Guided by a shared, \"Principles of Unity, a document that lists the core values of the tradition: personal authority, inclusivity, social and [[environmental justice]] and a recognition of intersectionality\".<ref>{{Cite book|title = Cultural Appropriation in Spirituality: How deepening our understandings of settler-colonialism, race and privilege can help us reland our practices with humility, accountability, and reciprocity.|last = Witch's of East Van|publisher = Witch's Union Hall|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nReclaiming originated in 1979 in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], blending the influences of [[Victor Anderson (poet)|Victor]] and Cora Anderson's [[Feri Tradition]] of Witchcraft, [[Dianic Wicca|Dianic Witchcraft]] as taught by [[Zsuzsanna Budapest|Z.

The focus on social change remains central among many core practitioners, while the activism, books and writings of Reclaiming's most famous priestess, Starhawk, continue to draw in layers of new members from earth-activist and other radical political communities. Central to this Reclaiming focus on social transformation is their theology of 'immanence' which teachers see as very different from the emphasis on 'transcendence' in major world religions, particularly the Judaeo-Christian tradition. For reclaiming teachers, immanent theology places sacrality primarily in the material world, particularly in the natural world and in human beings.<ref name=\"uncanny\"> Rachel Morgain. (October 2012) \"On the Use of the Uncanny in Ritual\". ''Religion'', 42:4, 521\u2013548. </ref>}}\n\n==Influences and teachings==\nReclaiming's spiritual approach is based in the feminist [[Goddess movement]] and [[matriarchal religion]]. On some levels Reclaiming has much in common with [[Wicca]], and the Wiccan [[Charge of the Goddess]] is commonly utilised; part of it is quoted in Reclaiming's core agenda, known as \"The Principles of Unity\". However, given its focus on dismantling and resisting structures of power and domination, Reclaiming uses [[consensus process]] and non-hierarchical structure in its covens \u2013 there is no [[High priest|High Priest]] or High Priestess as there would be in an [[Alexandrian Wicca|Alexandrian]] or [[Gardnerian Wicca|Gardnerian]] witchcraft [[coven]]. Reclaiming members are encouraged to take an active part in co-creating group rituals. \n\nTheologically, Reclaiming is very diverse and inclusive. The common thread is an active honoring and defending of the Earth, and a support of the [[Gaia hypothesis]]. Teaching and rituals, which are often focused on [[shamanic]] techniques such as [[guided meditation]], [[trance]] work, shapeshifting and [[Ecstasy (emotion)|ecstatic]] dance (as in the [[Spiral dance]], an iconic group dance often performed at rituals and at protest rallies), is empowering the individual and the community to take action. Reclaiming often uses chant as part of its rituals and has released numerous recordings of chants used in the movement. The embodiment of [[myth]] and [[fairytale]] in dramatic rituals (often done with spontaneity, a quality highly valued in the movement) which enact the cycle of the Seasons or the lessons of particular gods and goddesses are important in Reclaiming.\n\nReclaiming rituals are designed to encourage a spiritual way of life that blends respect for the earth and other living beings with a fuller sense of personal well-being and alignment with spiritual values. Starhawk and Valentine's handbook ''Twelve Wild Swans'' involves instructions for interpreting the tale of the book's title through both the 'inner' and 'outer' paths of personal and social transformation, the two paths being seen alike as necessary facets of the same overall project. Without a focus on healing the self, Reclaiming members believe people are certain to perpetuate the social ills they have internalised through the damage done by modernity. Their ritual work is thus focused as much on personal healing and transformation as on social justice.<ref name=\"uncanny\"/>\n\nAmong the tradition's teachers are Starhawk, author of ''[[Spiral Dance (book)|The Spiral Dance]]'' and several other books; [[T. Thorn Coyle]], author of ''Evolutionary Witchcraft''; Diane Baker and Anne Hill, co-authors of ''Circle Round: Raising Children in the Goddess Tradition (1998)'' and [[M. Macha Nightmare]], co-author of ''The Pagan Book of Living and Dying''.\n\n==Activities==\nToday, Reclaiming has several dozen affiliated communities across the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia. Weeklong intensives called \"Witchcamps\" bring Reclaiming people together in about a dozen regions. Classes such as \"Elements of Magic\", \"Rites of Passage\", and specific meditative and magical techniques such as the \"Pearl Pentacle\" and the \"Iron Pentacle\" assist participants to share practical skills in personal empowerment and group process. Reclaiming has also produced several CDs of Pagan chants and songs, and publishes the magazine ''Reclaiming Quarterly''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Feminism]]\n* [[Neopaganism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Rachel Morgain. \"Beyond 'Individualism': personhood and transformation in the Reclaiming pagan community of San Francisco\".

These include the [[Bechgaard salt]]s and [[Fabre salt]]s which are both quasi-one-dimensional, and quasi-two-dimensional materials such as ''[[kappa|k]]-BEDT-TTF<sub>2</sub>X'' [[charge-transfer complex]], ''[[lambda|\u03bb]]-BETS<sub>2</sub>X'' compounds,  [[graphite intercalation compound]]s and [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] materials such as the [[alkali]]-[[doping (semiconductor)|doped]] [[fullerene]]s.\n\nOrganic superconductors are of special interest not only for scientists, looking for room-temperature [[superconductivity]] and for model systems explaining the origin of superconductivity but also for daily life issues as [[organic compounds]] are mainly built of [[carbon]] and [[hydrogen]] which belong to [[Abundance of the chemical elements|the most common elements on earth]] in contrast to [[copper]] or [[osmium]].\n\n==One-dimensional Fabre and Bechgaard salts==\nFabre-salts are composed of tetramethyltetrathiafulvalene (TMTTF) and [[Bechgaard salt]]s of tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene (TMTSF). These two organic molecules are similar except for the [[sulfur]]-atoms of TMTTF being replaced by [[selenium]]-atoms in TMTSF. The molecules are stacked in columns (with a tendency to [[Dimerization (chemistry)|dimerization]]) which are separated by [[anion]]s. Typical anions are for example octahedral PF<sub>6</sub>, AsF<sub>6</sub> or tetrahedral ClO<sub>4</sub> or ReO<sub>4</sub>.\n\nBoth material classes are quasi-one-dimensional at room-temperature only conducting along the molecule stacks and share a very rich [[phase diagram]] containing [[Antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic ordering]], [[Charge ordering|charge order]], [[spin-density wave|spin-density wave state]], dimensional crossover and of course [[superconductivity]].\n\nOnly one Bechgaard salt was found to be superconducting at ambient pressure which is (TMTTF)<sub>2</sub>ClO<sub>4</sub> with a transition temperature of T<sub>C</sub> = 1.4 K. Several other salts become superconducting only under external pressure. The external pressure one would have to apply to drive most Fabre-salts to superconductivity is so high, that under lab conditions superconductivity was observed only in one compound. A selection of the transition temperature and corresponding external pressure of several one-dimensional organic superconductors is shown in the table below.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

These molecules form planes which are separated by anions. The pattern of the molecules in the planes is not unique but there are several different phases growing, depending on the anion and the growth conditions. Important phases concerning superconductivity are the \u03b1- and \u03b8- phase with the molecules ordering in a fishbone structure and the \u03b2- and especially \u03ba-phase which order in a checkerboard structure with molecules being [[Dimerization (chemistry)|dimerized]] in the \u03ba-phase. This dimerization makes the \u03ba-phases special as they are not quarter- but half-filled systems, driving them into superconductivity at higher temperatures compared to the other phases.\n\nThe amount of possible anions separating two sheets of ET-molecules is nearly infinite. There are simple anions such as I<sub>3</sub>, polymeric ones such as the very famous Cu[N(CN)<sub>2</sub>]Br and anions containing solvents for example Ag(CF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>\u00b7112DCBE. The electronic properties of the ET-based crystals are determined by its growing phase, its anion and by the external pressure applied. The external pressure needed to drive an ET-salt with insulating ground state to a superconducting one is much smaller than those needed for [[Bechgaard salt]]s. For example, \u03ba-(ET)<sub>2</sub>Cu[N(CN)<sub>2</sub>]Cl needs only a pressure of about 300 bar to become superconducting, which can be achieved by placing a crystal in [[Grease (lubricant)|grease]] which is freezing below 0&nbsp;\u00b0C and then providing sufficient [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] to induce the superconducting transition. The crystals are very sensitive (never user [[tweezers]] on them) which can be observed impressively in \u03b1-(ET)<sub>2</sub>I<sub>3</sub> lying several hours in the [[sun]] (or, more controlled in an oven at 40&nbsp;\u00b0C). After this treatment one gets \u03b1<sub>Tempered</sub>-(ET)<sub>2</sub>I<sub>3</sub> which is superconducting.\n\nIn contrast to the Fabre or Bechgaard salts universal [[phase diagrams]] for all the ET-based salts have only been proposed yet. For sure such a phase diagram wouldn\u2019t only depend on temperature and pressure (i.e. bandwidth) but also on [[electronic correlation]]s. In addition to the superconducting ground state these materials show [[Charge ordering|charge-order]], [[antiferromagnetism]] or remain [[metal]]lic down to lowest temperatures. One compound is even predicted to be a [[spin liquid]].\n\nThe highest transition temperatures at ambient pressure and with external pressure are both found in \u03ba-phases with very similar anions. \u03ba-(ET)<sub>2</sub>Cu[N(CN)<sub>2</sub>]Br becomes superconducting at T<sub>C</sub> = 11.8 K at ambient pressure, and a pressure of 300 bar drives deuterated \u03ba-(ET)<sub>2</sub>Cu[N(CN)<sub>2</sub>]Cl from an [[antiferromagnetic]] to a superconducting ground state with a transition temperature of T<sub>C</sub> = 13.1 K. The following table restricts to only a few exemplary superconductors of this class. For more superconductors see ref 1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Material !!

(2008) \"Theory of the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov State and Application to Quasi-Low-Dimensional Organic Superconductors\", in ''The Physics of Organic Superconductors and Conductors''. A.G. Lebed (ed.). Springer, Berlin.</ref>\n\n==Doped fullerenes==\nSuperconducting [[fullerenes]] based on C<sub>60</sub> are fairly different from other organic superconductors. The building molecules are no longer manipulated [[hydrocarbons]] but pure [[carbon]] molecules. In addition these molecules are no longer flat but bulky which gives rise to a three-dimensional, isotropic superconductor. The pure C<sub>60</sub> grows in a [[Cubic crystal system|fcc-lattice]] and is an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]]. By placing [[alkali]] atoms in the interstitials the crystal becomes metallic and eventually superconducting at low temperatures.\n\nUnfortunately C<sub>60</sub> crystals are not stable at ambient atmosphere. They are grown and investigated in closed capsules, limiting the measurement techniques possible. The highest transition temperature measured so far was T<sub>C</sub> = 33 K for Cs<sub>2</sub>RbC<sub>60</sub>.The highest measured transition temperature of an organic superconductor was found in 1995 in Cs<sub>3</sub>C<sub>60</sub> pressurized with 15 kbar to be T<sub>C</sub> = 40 K. Under pressure this compound shows a unique behavior. Usually the highest T<sub>C</sub> is achieved with the lowest pressure necessary to drive the transition. Further increase of the pressure usually reduces the transition temperature. However, in Cs<sub>3</sub>C<sub>60</sub> superconductivity sets in at very low pressures of several 100 bar, and the transition temperature keeps increasing with increasing pressure. This indicates a completely different mechanism then just broadening of the bandwidth.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Material !!

A few examples shall be presented here.\n\n===TTP-based SCs===\nTMTTF as well as BEDT-TTF are based on the molecule TTF ([[tetrathiafulvalene]]). Using TTP (tetrathiapentalene) as basic molecules one receives a variety of new organic molecules serving as cations in organic crystals. And some of them are superconducting. This class of superconductors was only reported recently and investigations are still under process.\n\n===Phenanthrene-type SCs===\nInstead of using sulfated molecules or the fairly big Buckminster [[fullerenes]] recently it became possible to synthesize crystals from the hydrocarbon [[picene]] and [[phenanthrene]]. Doping the crystal Picene and Phenanthrene with some alkali metals such as [[potassium]] or [[rubidium]] and annealing for several days leads to superconductivity with transition temperatures up to 18 K. For the AxPhenanthrene, the superconductivity is possible unconventional. Both phenanthrene and picene are called phenanthrene-edge-type [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]. The increasing number of benzene rings results in higher T<sub>c</sub>.\n\n===Graphite intercalation SCs===\nPutting foreign molecules or atoms between hexagon [[graphite]] sheets leads to ordered structures and to superconductivity even if neither the foreign molecule or atom nor the graphite layers are metallic. Several [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometries]] have been synthesized using mainly alkali atoms as anions.\n\n===Several T<sub>C</sub>s for unusual SCs===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Material !!

The molecules are stacked in columns (with a tendency to [[Dimerization (chemistry)|dimerization]]) which are separated by [[anion]]s. Typical anions are for example octahedral PF<sub>6</sub>, AsF<sub>6</sub> or tetrahedral ClO<sub>4</sub> or ReO<sub>4</sub>.\n\nBoth material classes are quasi-one-dimensional at room-temperature only conducting along the molecule stacks and share a very rich [[phase diagram]] containing [[Antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic ordering]], [[Charge ordering|charge order]], [[spin-density wave|spin-density wave state]], dimensional crossover and of course [[superconductivity]].\n\nOnly one Bechgaard salt was found to be superconducting at ambient pressure which is (TMTTF)<sub>2</sub>ClO<sub>4</sub> with a transition temperature of T<sub>C</sub> = 1.4 K. Several other salts become superconducting only under external pressure. The external pressure one would have to apply to drive most Fabre-salts to superconductivity is so high, that under lab conditions superconductivity was observed only in one compound. A selection of the transition temperature and corresponding external pressure of several one-dimensional organic superconductors is shown in the table below.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

These molecules form planes which are separated by anions. The pattern of the molecules in the planes is not unique but there are several different phases growing, depending on the anion and the growth conditions. Important phases concerning superconductivity are the \u03b1- and \u03b8- phase with the molecules ordering in a fishbone structure and the \u03b2- and especially \u03ba-phase which order in a checkerboard structure with molecules being [[Dimerization (chemistry)|dimerized]] in the \u03ba-phase. This dimerization makes the \u03ba-phases special as they are not quarter- but half-filled systems, driving them into superconductivity at higher temperatures compared to the other phases.\n\nThe amount of possible anions separating two sheets of ET-molecules is nearly infinite. There are simple anions such as I<sub>3</sub>, polymeric ones such as the very famous Cu[N(CN)<sub>2</sub>]Br and anions containing solvents for example Ag(CF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>\u00b7112DCBE. The electronic properties of the ET-based crystals are determined by its growing phase, its anion and by the external pressure applied. The external pressure needed to drive an ET-salt with insulating ground state to a superconducting one is much smaller than those needed for [[Bechgaard salt]]s. For example, \u03ba-(ET)<sub>2</sub>Cu[N(CN)<sub>2</sub>]Cl needs only a pressure of about 300 bar to become superconducting, which can be achieved by placing a crystal in [[Grease (lubricant)|grease]] which is freezing below 0&nbsp;\u00b0C and then providing sufficient [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] to induce the superconducting transition. The crystals are very sensitive (never user [[tweezers]] on them) which can be observed impressively in \u03b1-(ET)<sub>2</sub>I<sub>3</sub> lying several hours in the [[sun]] (or, more controlled in an oven at 40&nbsp;\u00b0C). After this treatment one gets \u03b1<sub>Tempered</sub>-(ET)<sub>2</sub>I<sub>3</sub> which is superconducting.\n\nIn contrast to the Fabre or Bechgaard salts universal [[phase diagrams]] for all the ET-based salts have only been proposed yet. For sure such a phase diagram wouldn\u2019t only depend on temperature and pressure (i.e. bandwidth) but also on [[electronic correlation]]s. In addition to the superconducting ground state these materials show [[Charge ordering|charge-order]], [[antiferromagnetism]] or remain [[metal]]lic down to lowest temperatures. One compound is even predicted to be a [[spin liquid]].\n\nThe highest transition temperatures at ambient pressure and with external pressure are both found in \u03ba-phases with very similar anions. \u03ba-(ET)<sub>2</sub>Cu[N(CN)<sub>2</sub>]Br becomes superconducting at T<sub>C</sub> = 11.8 K at ambient pressure, and a pressure of 300 bar drives deuterated \u03ba-(ET)<sub>2</sub>Cu[N(CN)<sub>2</sub>]Cl from an [[antiferromagnetic]] to a superconducting ground state with a transition temperature of T<sub>C</sub> = 13.1 K. The following table restricts to only a few exemplary superconductors of this class. For more superconductors see ref 1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Material !!

(2008) \"Theory of the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov State and Application to Quasi-Low-Dimensional Organic Superconductors\", in ''The Physics of Organic Superconductors and Conductors''. A.G. Lebed (ed.). Springer, Berlin.</ref>\n\n==Doped fullerenes==\nSuperconducting [[fullerenes]] based on C<sub>60</sub> are fairly different from other organic superconductors. The building molecules are no longer manipulated [[hydrocarbons]] but pure [[carbon]] molecules. In addition these molecules are no longer flat but bulky which gives rise to a three-dimensional, isotropic superconductor. The pure C<sub>60</sub> grows in a [[Cubic crystal system|fcc-lattice]] and is an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]]. By placing [[alkali]] atoms in the interstitials the crystal becomes metallic and eventually superconducting at low temperatures.\n\nUnfortunately C<sub>60</sub> crystals are not stable at ambient atmosphere. They are grown and investigated in closed capsules, limiting the measurement techniques possible. The highest transition temperature measured so far was T<sub>C</sub> = 33 K for Cs<sub>2</sub>RbC<sub>60</sub>.The highest measured transition temperature of an organic superconductor was found in 1995 in Cs<sub>3</sub>C<sub>60</sub> pressurized with 15 kbar to be T<sub>C</sub> = 40 K. Under pressure this compound shows a unique behavior. Usually the highest T<sub>C</sub> is achieved with the lowest pressure necessary to drive the transition. Further increase of the pressure usually reduces the transition temperature. However, in Cs<sub>3</sub>C<sub>60</sub> superconductivity sets in at very low pressures of several 100 bar, and the transition temperature keeps increasing with increasing pressure. This indicates a completely different mechanism then just broadening of the bandwidth.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Material !!

A few examples shall be presented here.\n\n===TTP-based SCs===\nTMTTF as well as BEDT-TTF are based on the molecule TTF ([[tetrathiafulvalene]]). Using TTP (tetrathiapentalene) as basic molecules one receives a variety of new organic molecules serving as cations in organic crystals. And some of them are superconducting. This class of superconductors was only reported recently and investigations are still under process.\n\n===Phenanthrene-type SCs===\nInstead of using sulfated molecules or the fairly big Buckminster [[fullerenes]] recently it became possible to synthesize crystals from the hydrocarbon [[picene]] and [[phenanthrene]]. Doping the crystal Picene and Phenanthrene with some alkali metals such as [[potassium]] or [[rubidium]] and annealing for several days leads to superconductivity with transition temperatures up to 18 K. For the AxPhenanthrene, the superconductivity is possible unconventional. Both phenanthrene and picene are called phenanthrene-edge-type [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]. The increasing number of benzene rings results in higher T<sub>c</sub>.\n\n===Graphite intercalation SCs===\nPutting foreign molecules or atoms between hexagon [[graphite]] sheets leads to ordered structures and to superconductivity even if neither the foreign molecule or atom nor the graphite layers are metallic. Several [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometries]] have been synthesized using mainly alkali atoms as anions.\n\n===Several T<sub>C</sub>s for unusual SCs===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Material !!

The cities [[Oslo]], [[Bergen]] and [[Trondheim]] introduced toll rings between 1986 and 1991 as a means to discourage urban traffic and to finance infrastructure projects around those cities.<ref>{{Citation|title=bompenger|date=2019-05-27|url=http://snl.no/bompenger|work=Store norske leksikon|language=no|access-date=2019-06-27}}</ref> Today toll rings circumscribe Oslo, [[Kristiansand]], [[Stavanger]], [[Haugesund]], [[Bergen]], [[Ask\u00f8y]], [[Bod\u00f8]], [[Harstad]], [[Grenland]], [[F\u00f8rde]] and [[Trondheim]]. Besides toll rings, road tolls are installed to finance certain road projects, and often also on the existing road to discourage people from using it. Some tolls use [[congestion pricing]] and/or environmentally differentiated toll rates.\n\nPrime minister [[Solberg's Cabinet]] proposed a road toll reform with four parts - a reduction of toll road operators, separation of the toll service provision for tolls and ferry tickets from the toll road companies, an interest compensation scheme for toll road loans, and a simplification of the price and discount schemes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://samferdsel.toi.no/teknologi/etterlengtet-bompengereform-men-svarer-den-pa-fremtidens-utfordringer-article33685-801.html|title=Etterlengtet bompengereform, men svarer den p\u00e5 fremtidens utfordringer?|last=|first=|date=2017-08-01|work=Samferdsel|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== AutoPASS ==\nThe Norwegian [[electronic toll collection]] system is called [[Autopass|AutoPass]], and is administrated by the [[Norwegian Public Roads Administration]].

Besides toll rings, road tolls are installed to finance certain road projects, and often also on the existing road to discourage people from using it. Some tolls use [[congestion pricing]] and/or environmentally differentiated toll rates.\n\nPrime minister [[Solberg's Cabinet]] proposed a road toll reform with four parts - a reduction of toll road operators, separation of the toll service provision for tolls and ferry tickets from the toll road companies, an interest compensation scheme for toll road loans, and a simplification of the price and discount schemes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://samferdsel.toi.no/teknologi/etterlengtet-bompengereform-men-svarer-den-pa-fremtidens-utfordringer-article33685-801.html|title=Etterlengtet bompengereform, men svarer den p\u00e5 fremtidens utfordringer?|last=|first=|date=2017-08-01|work=Samferdsel|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== AutoPASS ==\nThe Norwegian [[electronic toll collection]] system is called [[Autopass|AutoPass]], and is administrated by the [[Norwegian Public Roads Administration]].

Zero-emission vehicle is a collective name for electric cars and hydrogen cars, and the toll fee is maximum 50% of ordinary toll fee after discount (i.e. if the toll fee is 10 NOK, it costs 8 NOK for those with a valid tag/agreement. The toll fee for zero-emission vehicles can hence be maximum 4 NOK). The introduction of payment for zero-emission vehicles is done according to the instructions from Prop. 87 S (2017-2018) and local government. Payment of tolls as a zero-emission vehicle requires tag and a valid agreement. Without a tag and a valid agreement, zero-emission vehicles will be charged ordinary fare like other vehicles.<ref>{{Cite
