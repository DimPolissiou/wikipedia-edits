The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher's creative output and his approach to the act of painting, \u2018it may just be a flat piece of metal\u2026 But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections\u2026 the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface\u2019.<ref name=\"Arcs\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, ER.358.jpg|thumb|left|alt=ER.358.|ER.358 Oil and resin on extruded aluminium box sections.]]\n===Philosophy and approach to painting===\n\u2018The application or subtraction of paint\u2019 in Butcher's practice is executed through the use of \u2018a metal blade drawn across the painting\u2019s surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\">\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.7.

As a result two rhythms arise; on the one hand the colour fields are interrupted by sections of contrasting colour, and on the other hand we have the various degrees of paint application, which range from impasto to diaphanous. They completely cover the aluminium, yet also let it shimmer through'.<ref>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.23. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref> \n\nAlthough Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d. San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n\n===Site-specific Installations===\nEric Butcher's site-specific installations are interventions in space. Like the intimate relationship between painted surface and objects that distinguish his work, they become 'a pause in the act or a mistake in the material'<ref name=Bildwerke>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.27. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref>. This methodology can be seen in the lengths, or fragments, of aluminium that 'seem to cling to the wall [in his installations]. In part driven by chance, and yet still composed according to a strict order'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> The context of these installations have become increasingly important, 'determined by aspects of its context; both its physical environment and psychological purpose'<ref name=TimeTrial>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.89. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> as Butcher says in his recent catalogue, Time Trial. 'As soon as I started to consider the intersections between surfaces and the wall, I was naturally, logically led to a consideration of the whole environmental context of the work and hence to site-specificity.'<ref name=TimeTrial /> This mirrors his approach to the objects he works with, the 'relationship between the painted surface and the object (upon which one surface has been singled out for preferential treatment), between 'surface' and 'objectness'.<ref name=TimeTrial68>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.68. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref>\n\n===Paperworks===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, 'they repeat\nthe principle of the aluminium works in their own specific way'<ref name=Bildwerke /> introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> In these paper works, impressions of metal plates are embossed into sheets of saturated paper by running it through a printing press.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 80. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> Some sections of the plates\u2019 impressions are then highlighted by ink, whereas some sections are cut out altogether \u2013 some left purely as a trace.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\" /> 'These interventions take place separated from one another, yet may also intertwine. Through these perforations, the wall which is behind the deckle edged paper becomes a component of the work and takes on a bigger or smaller role depending on the size and quantity of perforations'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> Butcher refers to this register of trace in his paper works as speaking, metaphorically, of loss and absence.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 81.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines)<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref>, which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.

As a result two rhythms arise; on the one hand the colour fields are interrupted by sections of contrasting colour, and on the other hand we have the various degrees of paint application, which range from impasto to diaphanous. They completely cover the aluminium, yet also let it shimmer through'.<ref>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.23. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref> \n\nAlthough Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d.

Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own.

Galerie Robert Drees.</ref>. This methodology can be seen in the lengths, or fragments, of aluminium that 'seem to cling to the wall [in his installations]. In part driven by chance, and yet still composed according to a strict order'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> The context of these installations have become increasingly important, 'determined by aspects of its context; both its physical environment and psychological purpose'<ref name=TimeTrial>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.89. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> as Butcher says in his recent catalogue, Time Trial. 'As soon as I started to consider the intersections between surfaces and the wall, I was naturally, logically led to a consideration of the whole environmental context of the work and hence to site-specificity.'<ref name=TimeTrial /> This mirrors his approach to the objects he works with, the 'relationship between the painted surface and the object (upon which one surface has been singled out for preferential treatment), between 'surface' and 'objectness'.<ref name=TimeTrial68>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.68. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref>\n\n===Paperworks===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, 'they repeat\nthe principle of the aluminium works in their own specific way'<ref name=Bildwerke /> introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines)<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref>, which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.

Dino is a relatively small dinosaur, only slightly larger than the humans of his time, smaller than [[mammoth]]s that appear in the series, and much smaller than the numerous sauropods that appear as work animals in the series (a full-sized sauropod appears as a crane in the opening sequence, and oversized \"[[Brontosaurus|bronto]] ribs\" the size of an automobile are seen in the closing credits).\n\nA recurring gag in the series is Fred coming home from work, and Dino gets excited and knocks him down and licks his face. But no matter how hard he tries to the contrary, Fred usually gives in to Dino's ticklish and wet doglike kisses. Dino frequently exhibits human emotions, nearly \"talking,\" and can also be moved to anger, at which point he snarls and snaps, especially when Fred tries to lie either to or in front of him, which he can always tell. He also loves to play with [[Pebbles Flintstone|Pebbles]] and [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble|Bamm-Bamm]], the Flintstones' and Rubbles' respective offspring; these characters are introduced in the middle part of the series. In the episode \"Hop Happy\" Dino meets Hoppy, the Rubbles' new pet hopperoo. At first, Dino and Fred get scared, thinking he's a giant mouse, but they eventually become best friends after Hoppy helps Dino rescue their owners in an accident.\n\nAlthough he is usually immune, Dino does take a couple of brief stabs at romance.  The first comes in the episode, \"Dino Goes Hollyrock\", which originally aired on September 14, 1962.  In it, Dino falls in love with female TV star sauropod \"Sassie\" (an obvious takeoff on \"[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]\") and then becomes her co-star on her TV show.  However, after she removes her false eyelashes and wig, he is shocked that she turned out to be an ugly, talented sauropod that could be beautified.  The second comes in the episode, \"Dino and Juliet\", which originally aired on November 26, 1964.  In it, Dino falls in love with the new neighbor's female sauropod (Juliet).  Their romance, which results in the birth of 15 puppies, helps end the feud between Fred and the new neighbor, Mr. Loudrock.\n\nAlthough Dino had already appeared earlier in the series' first season (such as the episode \"No Help Wanted\" and \"Arthur Quarry's Dance Class\" - these episodes were made after the \"Snorkasaurus Hunter\" but aired before), Dino is portrayed quite differently in the first season's 18th episode \"The Snorkasaurus Hunter.\" In this episode, Fred and his friend [[Barney Rubble]] are on a camping trip, trying to hunt a snorkasaurus. Unlike Dino's other appearances, the snorkasaurus in this episode speaks and behaves toward Fred and Barney in a manner similar to comedian [[Phil Silvers]]. At the end of the episode, the Flintstones take in the dinosaur; the snorkasaurus (called \"Dino\" at one point by Wilma) is seen acting like a butler for the Flintstones: answering the telephone, dusting, and ironing. Dino in this episode also has purple skin instead of his varying pink-to-red color, which seems to vary from episode-to-episode during this early period, but is permanently purple after this episode. After this episode, Dino is permanently portrayed as behaving in a doglike fashion.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0580278/</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.topthat.net/webrock/faq/faq10.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513034318/http://www.topthat.net/webrock/faq/faq10.htm |archivedate=2012-05-13 }}</ref>\n\nDino's origins are explained in the episode \"Dino Disappears\", which originally aired on October 10, 1963.  In it, Wilma states that Dino followed Fred home because Fred was playing with him.  Fred counters by saying he was merely trying to chase him away. This seems to refer to the episode \"Snorkasaurus Hunter\" where Fred and Barney's playing was actually hunting him down and Dino's following him was actually Dino sneaking onto the car.\n\nPost-original series, Dino appears in most of the series' spin-offs, except during the first season of ''[[The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show]]''. There, Dino is replaced by Wooly, a dwarf mammoth, as the Flintstone family's pet. However, starting with the following series ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour]]'', Dino once again becomes a regular character.\n\nIn the 1980-1982 series ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show]]'', Dino is featured in his own segment, \"[[The Flintstone Comedy Show (1980 TV series)#Dino and Cavemouse|Dino and Cavemouse]],\" where Dino tries futilely to capture a pesky [[mouse]] in the Flintstone household. The segments bear some similarities to classic cat-and-mouse cartoons such as ''[[Tom and Jerry]]''.\n\nDino later appears as a puppy in 1986-1988 series ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' (including his own segment, \"Dino's Dilemmas\"), as Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm's babysitter in the short-lived 1996 series ''[[Cave Kids]]'', and also starred in his own two 7-minute short cartoons, ''[[Dino: Stay Out!]]'' (1995) and ''[[Dino: The Great Egg-Scape]]'' (1997).\n\nIn 2020, Dino starred in a new spin-off series ''[[Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs]]''. Similar to ''[[Cave Kids]]'', the show focuses on the lives of Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm, who are joined by Dino for many adventures in the [[Stone Age]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Amidi |first1=Amid |title=Boomerang Announces 2 New Streaming Series: \u2018Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs!\u2019 and \u2018Scooby-Doo And Guess Who?\u2019 |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/internet-television/boomerang-announces-2-new-streaming-series-yabba-dabba-dinosaurs-and-scooby-doo-and-guess-who-158604.html |accessdate=16 March 2020 |work=Cartoon Brew |date=May 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Other media==\n[[File:Dino Harikalar Diyari Flintstones 06029 nevit.jpg|thumbnail|right|Dino statue (right), along with [[Fred Flintstone]] (left).]]\nDino appears in both live-action movies. He isn't seen very often in the first film, 1994's ''[[The Flintstones (film)|The Flintstones]]''. Dino was created with both computer-generated imagery and as a puppet from [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]], while archival audio from the original series was used to serve as Dino's voice.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nHowever, in the second film, 2000's ''[[The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas]]'', Dino has more screen time; he appears here as a puppy. Fred won Dino's egg as a prize after winning a carnival game. Initially, Fred didn't think much of the egg as he felt that the creatures inside never live long. On a [[Ferris wheel]], just as Fred and Wilma are about to kiss, Dino's egg hatches and he takes an immediate attachment to Fred, believing him to be his mother.

He is a pet dinosaur of the series' main characters, [[Fred Flintstone|Fred]] and [[Wilma Flintstone]].<ref>{{cite news|title= The Flintstones' 50th anniversary: 15 things you don't know|work= Daily Telegraph |date=2010-09-30|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8034627/The-Flintstones-50th-anniversary-15-things-you-dont-know.html|accessdate=2010-10-01|location=London|first=Heidi|last=Blake}}</ref> Dino debuted in the opening credits of the pilot episode of ''The Flintstones'', but is not mentioned by name until the first season's fourth episode, \"No Help Wanted.\"\n\n==Background==\nIn the series, Dino serves the role of a pet dog, and exhibits the characteristics of a typical domesticated canine.\n\nDino is a [[prosauropod]]-like [[dinosaur]], a Snorkasaurus. Dino is a relatively small dinosaur, only slightly larger than the humans of his time, smaller than [[mammoth]]s that appear in the series, and much smaller than the numerous sauropods that appear as work animals in the series (a full-sized sauropod appears as a crane in the opening sequence, and oversized \"[[Brontosaurus|bronto]] ribs\" the size of an automobile are seen in the closing credits).\n\nA recurring gag in the series is Fred coming home from work, and Dino gets excited and knocks him down and licks his face. But no matter how hard he tries to the contrary, Fred usually gives in to Dino's ticklish and wet doglike kisses. Dino frequently exhibits human emotions, nearly \"talking,\" and can also be moved to anger, at which point he snarls and snaps, especially when Fred tries to lie either to or in front of him, which he can always tell. He also loves to play with [[Pebbles Flintstone|Pebbles]] and [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble|Bamm-Bamm]], the Flintstones' and Rubbles' respective offspring; these characters are introduced in the middle part of the series. In the episode \"Hop Happy\" Dino meets Hoppy, the Rubbles' new pet hopperoo. At first, Dino and Fred get scared, thinking he's a giant mouse, but they eventually become best friends after Hoppy helps Dino rescue their owners in an accident.\n\nAlthough he is usually immune, Dino does take a couple of brief stabs at romance.  The first comes in the episode, \"Dino Goes Hollyrock\", which originally aired on September 14, 1962.  In it, Dino falls in love with female TV star sauropod \"Sassie\" (an obvious takeoff on \"[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]\") and then becomes her co-star on her TV show.  However, after she removes her false eyelashes and wig, he is shocked that she turned out to be an ugly, talented sauropod that could be beautified.  The second comes in the episode, \"Dino and Juliet\", which originally aired on November 26, 1964.  In it, Dino falls in love with the new neighbor's female sauropod (Juliet).  Their romance, which results in the birth of 15 puppies, helps end the feud between Fred and the new neighbor, Mr. Loudrock.\n\nAlthough Dino had already appeared earlier in the series' first season (such as the episode \"No Help Wanted\" and \"Arthur Quarry's Dance Class\" - these episodes were made after the \"Snorkasaurus Hunter\" but aired before), Dino is portrayed quite differently in the first season's 18th episode \"The Snorkasaurus Hunter.\" In this episode, Fred and his friend [[Barney Rubble]] are on a camping trip, trying to hunt a snorkasaurus. Unlike Dino's other appearances, the snorkasaurus in this episode speaks and behaves toward Fred and Barney in a manner similar to comedian [[Phil Silvers]]. At the end of the episode, the Flintstones take in the dinosaur; the snorkasaurus (called \"Dino\" at one point by Wilma) is seen acting like a butler for the Flintstones: answering the telephone, dusting, and ironing. Dino in this episode also has purple skin instead of his varying pink-to-red color, which seems to vary from episode-to-episode during this early period, but is permanently purple after this episode. After this episode, Dino is permanently portrayed as behaving in a doglike fashion.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0580278/</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.topthat.net/webrock/faq/faq10.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513034318/http://www.topthat.net/webrock/faq/faq10.htm |archivedate=2012-05-13 }}</ref>\n\nDino's origins are explained in the episode \"Dino Disappears\", which originally aired on October 10, 1963.  In it, Wilma states that Dino followed Fred home because Fred was playing with him.  Fred counters by saying he was merely trying to chase him away. This seems to refer to the episode \"Snorkasaurus Hunter\" where Fred and Barney's playing was actually hunting him down and Dino's following him was actually Dino sneaking onto the car.\n\nPost-original series, Dino appears in most of the series' spin-offs, except during the first season of ''[[The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show]]''. There, Dino is replaced by Wooly, a dwarf mammoth, as the Flintstone family's pet. However, starting with the following series ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour]]'', Dino once again becomes a regular character.\n\nIn the 1980-1982 series ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show]]'', Dino is featured in his own segment, \"[[The Flintstone Comedy Show (1980 TV series)#Dino and Cavemouse|Dino and Cavemouse]],\" where Dino tries futilely to capture a pesky [[mouse]] in the Flintstone household. The segments bear some similarities to classic cat-and-mouse cartoons such as ''[[Tom and Jerry]]''.\n\nDino later appears as a puppy in 1986-1988 series ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' (including his own segment, \"Dino's Dilemmas\"), as Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm's babysitter in the short-lived 1996 series ''[[Cave Kids]]'', and also starred in his own two 7-minute short cartoons, ''[[Dino: Stay Out!]]'' (1995) and ''[[Dino: The Great Egg-Scape]]'' (1997).\n\nIn 2020, Dino starred in a new spin-off series ''[[Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs]]''. Similar to ''[[Cave Kids]]'', the show focuses on the lives of best friends Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm, who are joined by Dino for many adventures in the [[Stone Age]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Amidi |first1=Amid |title=Boomerang Announces 2 New Streaming Series: \u2018Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs!\u2019 and \u2018Scooby-Doo And Guess Who?\u2019 |url=https://www.cartoonbrew.com/internet-television/boomerang-announces-2-new-streaming-series-yabba-dabba-dinosaurs-and-scooby-doo-and-guess-who-158604.html |accessdate=16 March 2020 |work=Cartoon Brew |date=May 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Other media==\n[[File:Dino Harikalar Diyari Flintstones 06029 nevit.jpg|thumbnail|right|Dino statue (right), along with [[Fred Flintstone]] (left).]]\nDino appears in both live-action movies. He isn't seen very often in the first film, 1994's ''[[The Flintstones (film)|The Flintstones]]''. Dino was created with both computer-generated imagery and as a puppet from [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]], while archival audio from the original series was used to serve as Dino's voice.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nHowever, in the second film, 2000's ''[[The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas]]'', Dino has more screen time; he appears here as a puppy. Fred won Dino's egg as a prize after winning a carnival game. Initially, Fred didn't think much of the egg as he felt that the creatures inside never live long. On a [[Ferris wheel]], just as Fred and Wilma are about to kiss, Dino's egg hatches and he takes an immediate attachment to Fred, believing him to be his mother. (This, of course, contradicts Dino's origin in the original series.)\n\n==Filmography==\n===Television shows===\n* ''[[The Flintstones]]'' (1960\u20131966)\n* ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour]]'' (1972\u20131974)\n* ''[[Fred Flintstone and Friends]]'' (1977\u20131978)\n* ''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Thing]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'' (1979\u20131980)\n* ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show]]'' (1980\u20131982)\n* ''[[The Flintstone Funnies]]'' (1982\u20131984)\n* ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' (1986\u20131988)\n* ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'' \u2013 featuring ''[[Dino: Stay Out!]]'' (1995) and ''[[Dino: The Great Egg-Scape]]'' (1997)\n* ''[[Cave Kids]]'' (1996)\n* ''[[Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs]]'' (2020)\n\n===Films and Specials===\n* ''[[The Man Called Flintstone]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[Energy: A National Issue]]'' (1977)\n* ''[[A Flintstone Christmas]]'' (1977)\n* ''[[The Flintstones: Little Big League]]'' (1978)\n* ''[[The Flintstones: Fred's Final Fling]]'' (1980)\n* ''[[The Flintstones: Wind-Up Wilma]]'' (1981)\n* ''[[The Flintstones: Jogging Fever]]'' (1981)\n* ''[[The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones]]'' (1987)\n* ''[[The Flintstone Kids' \"Just Say No\" Special]]'' (1988)\n* ''[[Hanna-Barbera's 50th: A Yabba Dabba Doo Celebration|A Yabba Dabba Doo Celebration: 50 Years of Hanna-Barbera]]'' (1989)\n* ''[[I Yabba-Dabba Do!]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[Hollyrock-a-Bye Baby]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[A Flintstone Family Christmas]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[The Flintstones (film)|The Flintstones]]'' (1994)\n* ''[[A Flintstones Christmas Carol]]'' (1994)\n* ''[[The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas]]'' (2000)\n* ''[[The Flintstones: On the Rocks]]'' (2001)\n* ''[[The Flintstones & WWE: Stone Age SmackDown!]]'' (2015)\n\n==Portrayal==\nDino's barks and sound effects were provided by [[Mel Blanc]] for 27 years, from 1960\u20131987; archive audio of Blanc was used for Dino in the [[The Flintstones (film)|1994 live-action film]] and [[The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas|its prequel in 2000]].

Six chapters deal with the main divisions of the subject (consumer behaviour, producer behaviour, price, income distribution, general level of income and prices, growth, and international trade), one with its practicability, one with its significance, and an appendix added that surveys thirteen types of theory. The preface modestly disclaims any intention of instructing fellow economists. The book is intended as a complement to an introductory course in economics. It is reminiscent of a surveyors report of a tumble-down house. It is unfit for human habitation, one would be mad to buy it, but one does, patches it up together as best one can, and inhabits it contentedly, gradually becoming inured to its defects. It is chastening to learn, from van Meerhaeghe's review, how deftly and how long ago the weaknesses of the economic edifice have been revealed. Mayer (1932),<ref>[[w:fr:Hans Mayer (\u00e9conomiste)|Hans Mayer]] (1879-1955) : ''Die Wirtschaftstheorie der Gegenwart'' (1927-32), ''Der Erkenntniswert der funktionellen Preistheorien'' (1932).</ref> Miry (1937), [[Robert Triffin|Triffin]] (1940) and many others produced cogent criticisms that, had they been heeded, would have helped to convert economics into an operational science. Instead, their names and doctrines have been forgotten, and we may be grateful to van Meerhaeghe for reminding us of them.\" G. Routh's conclusion is brief and to the point : \"This guarantees van Meerhaeghe's slim volume a long life. I fear that in ten years time its criticisms will be as valid and as relevant as they are today\". He proved to be something of an optimist: they remain as valid today as they did in 1981.<ref>E.g.

Relentlessly van Meerhaeghe insisted upon the necessity of knowledge of the historic backgrounds. Indeed, as history was his favoured subject area, since 1999 he was very active for the Annual [[Heilbronn]] Symposium in Economics and the Social Sciences<ref>A forum for the reconsideration of the traditions of the [[Historical school of economics|Historical School]].</ref> because it goes back to the old masters, i.e. the German classicists of the 19th (and even 18th) century. The German universities attracted many foreign students with a knowledge of German. Nowadays, some of these 'scholars' tend to invent theories which had already  been formulated in Germany during the 19th century. Hence the observation, made in ''Economic Theory'' (see above) that \u00abfar too often in economics, conclusions that were already formulated long ago are drawn triumphantly\u00bb (p.&nbsp;4). We mention :\n\n* ''The lost chapter of Schumpeter\u2019s \u2018Economic Development\u2019'' in ''Joseph Alo\u00efs Schumpeter. Entrepreneurship, style and vision'', ed.

Contrary to certain scholars van Meerhaeghe doesn't regard Nietzsche's views on economics as particularly sensational, even though there are certain aspects of his philosophy which could provide a better tool for economic analysis in some fields. \n* ''Bismarck and the social question'', Journal of Economic Studies, Sept. 2006, Vol. 33, Iss. 4, pp.&nbsp;284\u2013301.<ref>Paper presented at the 15th Heilbronn Symposion on \"The Social Question\", June 20\u201323, 2002.</ref> Discussing the political consequences of social welfare legislation, and in particular its effects on the ''Social Question''.

[[Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi|Justi]] might have been expected to adopt a protectionist and nationalist stance, but instead he comes across as an 'anti-Machiavelli' in his foreign-policy nostrums and a liberal in his views on foreign trade and population policy. \n* ''Is Montaigne a Utopian ?'', in ''The State as Utopia \u2013 Continental Approaches'', ed J. Backhaus, The European Heritage in Economics and the Social Sciences, Vol. 9, Springer, 2011, pp.&nbsp;67\u201376. Van Meerhaeghe refutes the idea that [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] would have been a 'famous utopian': no, he was the founder of modern scepticism.  \n* ''Mature Cameralism According to [[w:de:Johann Friedrich von Pfeiffer|Pfeiffer]]'', in ''Physiocracy, Antiphysiocracy and Pfeiffer'', ed J. Backhaus, The European Heritage in Economics and the Social Sciences, Vol. 10, Springer, 2011, pp.&nbsp;135\u2013147. Unfortunately there is a good deal of terminological confusion on display.

Van Meerhaeghe examines the dominant political, social and economic trends of our time: multiculturalism and immigration versus patriotism and regionalism, capitalism versus state governance, America versus the rest of the world. He concludes a.o. that (a) Russia is a normal trade partner and a natural ally for Europe, and (b) nothing seems to stop the further triumphal procession of - undemocratic - globalisation.<ref>See also ''An Interview on International Economic Problems - Interview met Prof. Em.

This paper considers the factors that lead to the crisis from a specific perspective \u2013 essentially the absence of adequate regulation \u2013 and is informed by earlier research and by van Meerhaeghe's experience in banking and certain government institutions. Is capitalism the appropriate term when the entire financial system has to be saved by the public sector? Under capitalism, the investor must accept responsibility for the losses he incurs. But the banks received no advice from the universities, even though they were urgently pressed for such assistance. The EU countries have come to realize that the free movement of capital has come too early. With the [[Brexit]] looming, Van Meerhaeghe arguments for the Sterling to join the eurozone as soon as possible.\n\n==Opinions==\n\nIn 1972, at the anniversary conference meeting of the [[Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik]] Professor van Meerhaeghe noted:\n\n\"Die B\u00fccherbesprechungen in amerikanischen und franz\u00f6sischen Zeitschriften sind sehr unterschiedlich.

In 1939 he passed the entrance exams for the [[w:fr:\u00c9cole royale militaire (Belgique)|\u00c9cole Royale Militaire]] (ERM). After the campaign of 1940 followed about seven months as a prisoner of war in a German camp (an intervention of King Leopold III resulted in the release of the ERM-students).\n\nAt Ghent University (Belgium) van Meerhaeghe obtained a master's degree in Economic Sciences in 1944 (first diet: July) and a Masters in Political Science and Sociology, also in 1944 (second diet: September). As regards the economics studies he attended the lectures given by Professor Raoul Miry who was the counterpart of Professor [[Gaston Eyskens]] of the University of [[Leuven]].<ref>Bulletin d'Information et de Documentation, [[Banque Nationale de Belgique]], Vol. II, N\u00b0 1, July 1937, editorial by [[Louis Franck (politician)|Louis Franck]] (Governor), pp.&nbsp;1\u20136.</ref>\n\nIn 1946 he obtained his PhD: ''Aviation in the traffic economy : the Belgian case in particular''.\n\nIn 1947 he became part-time lecturer political economy at the [[w:fr:Universit\u00e9 coloniale de Belgique|Koloniale Hogeschool]] (Antwerp)<ref>M. van Meerhaeghe, ''De Economische Structuur van Belgisch-Kongo en Ruanda-Urundi'' (Ontwikkeling, Antwerp 1958).</ref> and in 1955 part-time lecturer colonial economy at the University of Ghent.\n\nBefore becoming Professor of economics and international economics at the [[Ghent University|University of Ghent]] in 1957,<ref>''Sartonia'' ([[George Sarton]] Chair of the History of Sciences), Volume 19 (Academia Press, Ghent 2006), pp.&nbsp;191\u2013193.</ref> he worked as economic advisor in the Belgian Ministry of Economic Affairs,<ref>In 1945 he had started using data about the local economic policy in the town of [[Mechelen]].</ref> as 'faculty advisor' of the [[NATO Defence College]] in Paris (1953\u201354) and as an advisor to the Minister of Foreign Trade.<ref>D.

He was in favor of operational economics, helpful to practitioners (''n\u00fctzlich'').<ref>Fernand Goyens, ''Marktgericht: Professor M.A.G. van Meerhaeghe, ekonomie, RUG'', Knack Magazine (16de jaargang), September 1th 1986 (Special edition), pp.&nbsp;24\u201326.</ref> Later he elaborated his criticism in ''Economic Theory. A Critic's Companion'' (Martinus Nijhoff 1980), probably his most important work. It caused quite a stir because of its unconventional approach. (K. Nakaura published a Japanese translation.) [[Guy Routh]] wrote a favourable review in ''[[The Economic Journal]]'' (Vol. 91, No. 362, June 1981, p.&nbsp;591): \"Professor van Meerhaeghe's book is a masterpiece of condensation:<ref>Selectivity was indeed a characteristic of van Meerhaeghe: see e.g. the review of the textbook ''Economics'' of [[Richard Lipsey|R.G.

Six chapters deal with the main divisions of the subject (consumer behaviour, producer behaviour, price, income distribution, general level of income and prices, growth, and international trade), one with its practicability, one with its significance, and an appendix added that surveys thirteen types of theory. The preface modestly disclaims any intention of instructing fellow economists. The book is intended as a complement to an introductory course in economics. It is reminiscent of a surveyors report of a tumble-down house. It is unfit for human habitation, one would be mad to buy it, but one does, patches it up together as best one can, and inhabits it contentedly, gradually becoming inured to its defects. It is chastening to learn, from van Meerhaeghe's review, how deftly and how long ago the weaknesses of the economic edifice have been revealed. Mayer (1932),<ref>[[w:fr:Hans Mayer (\u00e9conomiste)|Hans Mayer]] (1879-1955) : ''Die Wirtschaftstheorie der Gegenwart'' (1927-32), ''Der Erkenntniswert der funktionellen Preistheorien'' (1932).</ref> Miry (1937), [[Robert Triffin|Triffin]] (1940) and many others produced cogent criticisms that, had they been heeded, would have helped to convert economics into an operational science. Instead, their names and doctrines have been forgotten, and we may be grateful to van Meerhaeghe for reminding us of them.\" G. Routh's conclusion is brief and to the point : \"This guarantees van Meerhaeghe's slim volume a long life. I fear that in ten years time its criticisms will be as valid and as relevant as they are today\". He proved to be something of an optimist: they remain as valid today as they did in 1981.<ref>E.g.

Relentlessly van Meerhaeghe insisted upon the necessity of knowledge of the historic backgrounds. Indeed, as history was his favoured subject area, since 1999 he was very active for the Annual [[Heilbronn]] Symposium in Economics and the Social Sciences<ref>A forum for the reconsideration of the traditions of the [[Historical school of economics|Historical School]].</ref> because it goes back to the old masters, i.e. the German classicists of the 19th (and even 18th) century. The German universities attracted many foreign students with a knowledge of German. Nowadays, some of these 'scholars' tend to invent theories which had already  been formulated in Germany during the 19th century. Hence the observation, made in ''Economic Theory'' (see above) that \u00abfar too often in economics, conclusions that were already formulated long ago are drawn triumphantly\u00bb (p.&nbsp;4). We mention :\n\n* ''The lost chapter of Schumpeter\u2019s \u2018Economic Development\u2019'' in ''Joseph Alo\u00efs Schumpeter. Entrepreneurship, style and vision'', ed.

M. van Meerhaeghe considers [[Schumpeter]] as \u2018superior\u2019 to [[Keynes]] because of his better knowledge of the economic science and his unsurpassed \u2018History of economic analysis\u2019.\n* ''[[Nietzsche]] and economics'' and ''Nietzsche and business ethics'', in ''Friedrich Nietzsche 1844-1900.

Contrary to certain scholars van Meerhaeghe doesn't regard Nietzsche's views on economics as particularly sensational, even though there are certain aspects of his philosophy which could provide a better tool for economic analysis in some fields. \n* ''Bismarck and the social question'', Journal of Economic Studies, Sept. 2006, Vol. 33, Iss. 4, pp.&nbsp;284\u2013301.<ref>Paper presented at the 15th Heilbronn Symposion on \"The Social Question\", June 20\u201323, 2002.</ref> Discussing the political consequences of social welfare legislation, and in particular its effects on the ''Social Question''.

[[Johann Heinrich Gottlob von Justi|Justi]] might have been expected to adopt a protectionist and nationalist stance, but instead he comes across as an 'anti-Machiavelli' in his foreign-policy nostrums and a liberal in his views on foreign trade and population policy. \n* ''Is Montaigne a Utopian ?'', in ''The State as Utopia \u2013 Continental Approaches'', ed J. Backhaus, The European Heritage in Economics and the Social Sciences, Vol. 9, Springer, 2011, pp.&nbsp;67\u201376. Van Meerhaeghe refutes the idea that [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] would have been a 'famous utopian': no, he was the founder of modern scepticism.  \n* ''Mature Cameralism According to [[w:de:Johann Friedrich von Pfeiffer|Pfeiffer]]'', in ''Physiocracy, Antiphysiocracy and Pfeiffer'', ed J. Backhaus, The European Heritage in Economics and the Social Sciences, Vol. 10, Springer, 2011, pp.&nbsp;135\u2013147. Unfortunately there is a good deal of terminological confusion on display. Cameralism is the German version of mercantilism; trade requires freedom.

Van Meerhaeghe examines the dominant political, social and economic trends of our time: multiculturalism and immigration versus patriotism and regionalism, capitalism versus state governance, America versus the rest of the world. He concludes a.o. that (a) Russia is a normal trade partner and a natural ally for Europe, and (b) nothing seems to stop the further triumphal procession of - undemocratic - globalisation.<ref>See also ''An Interview on International Economic Problems - Interview met Prof. Em.

This paper considers the factors that lead to the crisis from a specific perspective \u2013 essentially the absence of adequate regulation \u2013 and is informed by earlier research and by van Meerhaeghe's experience in banking and certain government institutions. Is capitalism the appropriate term when the entire financial system has to be saved by the public sector? Under capitalism, the investor must accept responsibility for the losses he incurs. But the banks received no advice from the universities, even though they were urgently pressed for such assistance. The EU countries have come to realize that the free movement of capital has come too early. With the [[Brexit]] looming, Van Meerhaeghe arguments for the Sterling to join the eurozone as soon as possible.\n\n==Opinions==\n\nIn 1972, at the anniversary conference meeting of the [[Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik]] Professor van Meerhaeghe noted:\n\n\"Die B\u00fccherbesprechungen in amerikanischen und franz\u00f6sischen Zeitschriften sind sehr unterschiedlich. In franz\u00f6sischen B\u00fccherbesprechungen gibt man im allgemeinen ein Res\u00fcmee \u00fcber das Buch. Man spendet viel Lob, und man hofft, da\u00df der Kollege dasselbe tun wird, wenn man einmal ebenfalls ein Buch schreibt. In amerikanischen und auch englischen Zeitungen ist das Gegenteil der Fall. Dort ist man ziemlich hart. Man kann dasselbe sagen von Diskussionen und Korreferaten. Es w\u00e4re viel leichter gewesen, hier etwas Generelles zu sagen und darzulegen: \u00ab Ja, ich bin einverstanden met a, b und c. \u00bb Aber f\u00fcr eine Diskussion ist es, glaube ich \u2013 ich sage nicht, da\u00df ich recht habe \u2013 besser, anzugreifen, ein wenig Kritik zu \u00fcben.\"<ref>[[w:de:Hans Karl Schneider (Volkswirt)|Hans K.

Both re-install their store under the name \"\u00c1rbol de Navidad\" (\"Christmas Tree\"). Their business was located at Ju\u00e1rez and Corona, a place that was famous in Guadalajara for its wide assortment and for the care and attention by its owners. Guadalajaran personalities such as politician Manuel Mart\u00ednez Valadez, painter Ixca Far\u00edas, Carlos Guti\u00e9rrez Cruz, author Agust\u00edn Basave y del Castillo Negrete; priests De la Cueva, Amando J.

By 1918, when the partnership with Cort\u00e9s had disintegrated, Fortino Jaime transferred his \"\u00c1rbol de Navidad\" to Avenida 16 de Septiembre #238. Active and dynamic, he never neglected his editorial duties. On 4 November 1918, he finished the printing of the first issue of the ''Revista Azul, Magazine Miniatura del Hogar'' (Blue Magazine, Miniature Magazine for the Home), whose  edition and publishing continued until 1920, and whose collection today is appraised at high prices. Another treasure in that year was el ''Libro de Ensayos Cr\u00edticos'' (Book of Critical Essays), by Agust\u00edn Basave y del Castillo Negrete.\n\nIn 1918, he installed a printing shop and a bookbinding table at the back of his store, where publications such as ''An\u00e1huac'', ''Misterios del Coraz\u00f3n'' (Mysteries of the Heart), ''El alma de las cosas'' (The Soul of Things), by Amando J. De Alba; ''El hombre y la Arquitectura'' (Man and Architecture), by Agust\u00edn Basave; and ''Memorias Tapat\u00edas'', by Jos\u00e9 Ignacio D\u00e1vila Garibi were published. Likewise, a series of legal publications such as the C\u00f3digo de Procedimientos Civiles del Estado de Jalisco (Code of Civil Procedures of the State of Jalisco), la Ley de Hacienda del Estado (Law of State Finance), y la Ley Agraria (Agrarian Law), among others, were edited by the Fortino Jaime press. In 1919 from the presses of Fortino Jaime came a book written by the gentle and cordial Marquis of San Francisco, [[Manuel Romero de Terreros]]: ''Bocetos de la vida social en la Nueva Espa\u00f1a'' (Sketches of Social Life in New Spain). By 1928, the Fortino Jaime printing house, \"\u00c1rbol de Navidad\" (Christmas Tree), changed location again: it was located at Calle Morelos 487, where two other precious and enlightened writers began to attend: [[Adalberto Navarro S\u00e1nchez]] and Ramiro Villase\u00f1or. Almost at the end of 1947 the store moved to its last residence: an old house on the corner of Juan Manuel and Bel\u00e9n Streets.\n\nBetween 1917 and 1937, Fortino Jaime was the most important publisher in Guadalajara, and his bookstore, one of the best assortments in that city. Literary critic Emmanuel Carballo (1929-2014) points out that he met Fortino in 1944, when he (Carballo) went to the bookstore, located at Morelos 487 (in Guadalajara) to buy used books, and perceived him as a decrepit man, in a \"rat's nest\", where Fortino argued a lot with his clients about book prices, like an usurer. Carballo indicates that this was, as he read in the book ''Asuntos Tapat\u00edos'' (Tapatios Affairs), by Francisco Ay\u00f3n Z\u00e9ster, due to loneliness and abandonment by public officials, writers, politicians, scientists...<ref>Carballo, Emmanuel, ''Ya nada es igual, memorias (1929-1953)'', Secretar\u00eda de Cultura de Jalisco/Editorial Diana, Guadalajara/Ciudad de M\u00e9xico, 1994, p. 302.</ref> he became a misanthrope. Fortino Jaime was a great promoter of Jalisco culture.\n\nHis remains rest in the Pante\u00f3n de Mezquit\u00e1n (Mezquitan Cemetery), in Guadalajara. On 24 April 1991, the mayor of Guadalajara [[Gabriel Covarrubias Ibarra]], in recognition of the important editorial work of Fortino Jaime, approved the proposal to impose his name on the XXIII Feria Municipal del Libro y la Cultura de Guadalajara (23rd Municipal Book and Culture Fair of Guadalajara). The opinion of the Council was unanimously approved and among other considerations it mentioned: \"Fortino Jaime Ibarra dedicated his whole life to promoting culture by offering the public innumerable texts at affordable prices.\"\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jaime, Fortino}}\n[[Category:1951 deaths]]\n[[Category:Mexican people]]\n[[Category:Publishers]]\n[[Category:Bookselling]]\n[[Category:Bookbinders]]\n", "text_old": "{{Orphan|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{short description|Mexican publisher}}\n{{Infobox publisher\n| name        = Fortino Jaime\n| image       = \n| imagesize   = \n| caption     = \n| pseudonym   =\n| birth_place = {{nowrap|[[Ixtl\u00e1n del R\u00edo]], [[Nayarit]] or [[Hostotipaquillo]], [[Jalisco]]}}\n| death_date  = {{death date|1951|02|12}}\n| death_place = {{nowrap|[[Guadalajara]], [[Jalisco]], Mexico}}\n| occupation  = \n| nationality = Mexican\n| language    = Spanish\n| period     = 1917\u20131951\n| genre      = publisher\n| movement   = \n}}\n'''Fortino Jaime Ibarra''' (Ixtl\u00e1n del R\u00edo,<ref>In the 5th Population Census, carried out in 1930, he was registered as a native of Ixtl\u00e1n del R\u00edo, Nayarit, with an age of 49 years.</ref> Nayarit or Hostotipaquillo,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jalisco.gob.mx/es/jalisco/jaliscienses%20distinguidos/jaime-ibarra-fortino|title=Jaime Ibarra, Fortino|accessdate=18 April 2020|language=Spanish}}</ref> Jalisco, 1881 or 1883-Guadalajara, Jalisco, 12 February 1951), was a [[Mexican]] [[publisher]], literary promoter, [[printer]], [[bookbinder]], and [[bookseller]].\n\n{{Spanish name 2 |Jaime|Ibarra}}\n\n== Biography ==\n\nHis parents were Pablo Jaime and Basilia Ibarra.

In 1919 from the presses of Fortino Jaime came a book written by the gentle and cordial Marquis of San Francisco, [[Manuel Romero de Terreros]]: ''Bocetos de la vida social en la Nueva Espa\u00f1a'' (Sketches of Social Life in New Spain). By 1928, the Fortino Jaime printing house, \"\u00c1rbol de Navidad\" (Christmas Tree), changed location again: it was located at Calle Morelos 487, where two other precious and enlightened writers began to attend: [[Adalberto Navarro S\u00e1nchez]] and Ramiro Villase\u00f1or. Almost at the end of 1947 the store moved to its last residence: an old house on the corner of Juan Manuel and Bel\u00e9n Streets.\n\nBetween 1917 and 1937, Fortino Jaime was the most important publisher in Guadalajara, and his bookstore, one of the best assortments in that city. Literary critic Emmanuel Carballo (1929-2014) points out that he met Fortino in 1944, when he (Carballo) went to the bookstore, located at Morelos 487 (in Guadalajara) to buy used books, and perceived him as a decrepit man, in a \"rat's nest\", where Fortino argued a lot with his clients about book prices, like an usurer. Carballo indicates that this was, as he read in the book ''Asuntos Tapat\u00edos'' (Tapatios Affairs), by Francisco Ay\u00f3n Z\u00e9ster, due to loneliness and abandonment by public officials, writers, politicians, scientists...<ref>Carballo, Emmanuel, ''Ya nada es igual, memorias (1929-1953)'', Secretar\u00eda de Cultura de Jalisco/Editorial Diana, Guadalajara/Ciudad de M\u00e9xico, 1994, p. 302.</ref> he became a misanthrope. Fortino Jaime was a great promoter of Jalisco culture.\n\nHis remains rest in the Pante\u00f3n de Mezquit\u00e1n (Mezquitan Cemetery), in Guadalajara. On 24 April 1991, the mayor of Guadalajara [[Gabriel Covarrubias Ibarra]], in recognition of the important editorial work of Fortino Jaime, approved the proposal to impose his name on the XXIII Feria Municipal del Libro y la Cultura de Guadalajara (23rd Municipal Book and Culture Fair of Guadalajara). The opinion of the Council was unanimously approved and among other considerations it mentioned: \"Fortino Jaime Ibarra dedicated his whole life to promoting culture by offering the public innumerable texts at affordable prices.\"\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jaime, Fortino}}\n[[Category:1951 deaths]]\n[[Category:Mexican people]]\n[[Category:Publishers]]\n[[Category:Bookselling]]\n[[Category:Bookbinders]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:Mexican\u2192Mexicans,printer\u2192printer (publishing)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortino_Jaime"}
