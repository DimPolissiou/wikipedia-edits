He is formerly the Chief Executive Officer of Big Win Philanthropy and an Adjunct Professor of Global Health of the [[Duke University]] Global Health Institute.  He is also a member of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts.\n\nDr. Pate served as a Richard L. and Ronay A. Menschel Senior Leadership Fellow at [[Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health]] in 2016. He taught a course in the Department of Global Health and Population called, \"Leadership Development in Global Health: Building Community Trust Networks.\"<ref>Former Fellows. (2017, February 24). Retrieved April 04, 2017, from https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/policy-translation-leadership-development/senior-leadership-fellows-program/former-fellows/#muhammadpate</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\n\nMuhammad Ali Pate was born in the [[Misau]] local government area of Bauchi State in Nigeria. He is the son of a fulani herdsman. The first in his family to complete a secondary school education, Dr. Pate graduated from high school to enter the [[Ahmadu Bello University]] (ABU) medical school in Kaduna State, Nigeria. He graduated ABU and moved to The Gambia where he worked in rural hospitals for a few years. He went on to complete his residency at the University of Rochester in the United States.\n\n== Early career ==\n\nPrior to his appointment to the NPHCDA in 2008, Dr. Pate had an extensive career spanning over 10 years at the [[World Bank]] in Washington DC and held several senior positions including Senior Health Specialist and Human Development Sector Coordinator for the East Asia/Pacific Region and Senior Health Specialist for the African Region. While at the World Bank, a major project led by Dr. Pate was the far-reaching health sector reform programmes in Africa, East Asia and other regions of the World Bank. Of note is his initiation of landmark Public Private Partnership to replace a National Referral Hospital in Lesotho, Africa. Dr. Pate was also awarded the prestigious Harvard Health Leader award of 2012.\n\n== NPHCDA ==\n\nDr. Pate was appointed to run the NPHCDA at the peak of the polio epidemic crisis in Nigeria. Nigeria is one of the four PAIN countries \u2013 Pakistan, Afghanistan, India and Nigeria \u2013 where polio still exists and can thus be transmitted to other countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=WHO African Region: Nigeria \u2013 Polio eradication|url=http://www.who.int/countries/nga/areas/polio/en/index.html|accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref> Poliomyelities can be prevented through multiple immunisation with the polio vaccine. Receiving a minimum of four doses of the vaccine almost certainly provides lifelong immunity in children.\n\nIn Nigeria the wild poliovirus WPV is mainly prevalent in the north of the country.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Global Polio Eradication Initiative|url=http://www.polioeradication.org/Infectedcountries.aspx|accessdate=16 July 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720015110/http://www.polioeradication.org/Infectedcountries.aspx|archivedate=20 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In June 2009 Dr. Pate instigated a policy of engaging respected traditional rulers in the north under the leadership of the Sultan of Sokoto to help deliver the immunisation programme message, along with the development of an effective primary health care system which had failed in the previous decade. The cases of WPV reduced from 803 at the end of 2008 to only 11 cases in 2010.\n\n== Primary health care implementation in Nigeria ==\n\nDr. Pate led the development of a transformation agenda for the NPHCDA, dealing with outstanding issues following its merger with the old NPI (National Programme on Immunisation). This involved core diagnostics, systems development and human resources capacity development within the Agency.\n\nDr. Pate identified the key failings in the healthcare system as structural constraint, fiscal decentralisation, mismatched burden of disease and low quality spending, poor and inequitable intermediate and long-term health outcomes, multiplicity of vertical initiatives, fragmented, inefficient service delivery, dilapidated health infrastructure, lack of skilled manpower in the frontlines; basic drugs and supplies and inadequate financial protection.\n\nHe has implemented innovative strategies including the training of middle level management for primary health care and collaboration with the private sector through public private partnerships.  He has facilitated the introduction of new vaccines to improve routine immunisation; and engaged with the governors and local government agencies to ensure improvements in Primary Health Care.

He is formerly the Chief Executive Officer of Big Win Philanthropy and an Adjunct Professor of Global Health of the [[Duke University]] Global Health Institute.

Retrieved April 04, 2017, from https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/policy-translation-leadership-development/senior-leadership-fellows-program/former-fellows/#muhammadpate</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\n\nMuhammad Ali Pate was born in the [[Misau]] local government area of Bauchi State in Nigeria. He is the son of a fulani herdsman. The first in his family to complete a secondary school education, Dr. Pate graduated from high school to enter the [[Ahmadu Bello University]] (ABU) medical school in Kaduna State, Nigeria. He graduated ABU and moved to The Gambia where he worked in rural hospitals for a few years. He went on to complete his residency at the University of Rochester in the United States.\n\n== Early career ==\n\nPrior to his appointment to the NPHCDA in 2008, Dr. Pate had an extensive career spanning over 10 years at the [[World Bank]] in Washington DC and held several senior positions including Senior Health Specialist and Human Development Sector Coordinator for the East Asia/Pacific Region and Senior Health Specialist for the African Region. While at the World Bank, a major project led by Dr. Pate was the far-reaching health sector reform programmes in Africa, East Asia and other regions of the World Bank. Of note is his initiation of landmark Public Private Partnership to replace a National Referral Hospital in Lesotho, Africa. Dr. Pate was also awarded the prestigious Harvard Health Leader award of 2012.\n\n== NPHCDA ==\n\nDr. Pate was appointed to run the NPHCDA at the peak of the polio epidemic crisis in Nigeria. Nigeria is one of the four PAIN countries \u2013 Pakistan, Afghanistan, India and Nigeria \u2013 where polio still exists and can thus be transmitted to other countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=WHO African Region: Nigeria \u2013 Polio eradication|url=http://www.who.int/countries/nga/areas/polio/en/index.html|accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref> Poliomyelities can be prevented through multiple immunisation with the polio vaccine. Receiving a minimum of four doses of the vaccine almost certainly provides lifelong immunity in children.\n\nIn Nigeria the wild poliovirus WPV is mainly prevalent in the north of the country.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Global Polio Eradication Initiative|url=http://www.polioeradication.org/Infectedcountries.aspx|accessdate=16 July 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720015110/http://www.polioeradication.org/Infectedcountries.aspx|archivedate=20 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In June 2009 Dr. Pate instigated a policy of engaging respected traditional rulers in the north under the leadership of the Sultan of Sokoto to help deliver the immunisation programme message, along with the development of an effective primary health care system which had failed in the previous decade. The cases of WPV reduced from 803 at the end of 2008 to only 11 cases in 2010.\n\n== Primary health care implementation in Nigeria ==\n\nDr. Pate led the development of a transformation agenda for the NPHCDA, dealing with outstanding issues following its merger with the old NPI (National Programme on Immunisation). This involved core diagnostics, systems development and human resources capacity development within the Agency.\n\nDr. Pate identified the key failings in the healthcare system as structural constraint, fiscal decentralisation, mismatched burden of disease and low quality spending, poor and inequitable intermediate and long-term health outcomes, multiplicity of vertical initiatives, fragmented, inefficient service delivery, dilapidated health infrastructure, lack of skilled manpower in the frontlines; basic drugs and supplies and inadequate financial protection.\n\nHe has implemented innovative strategies including the training of middle level management for primary health care and collaboration with the private sector through public private partnerships.  He has facilitated the introduction of new vaccines to improve routine immunisation; and engaged with the governors and local government agencies to ensure improvements in Primary Health Care. Furthermore, Dr. Pate pushed the agenda for decentralisation and integration and has improved the quality and quantity of human resources at the frontlines.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McKenzie and Enyimayew|author2=Kwame Adogboda, Carole Baekey and Bryan Haddon|title=Workshop on 'Bringing PHC under one roof'|journal=Partnership for Reviving Routine Immunization in Northern Nigeria; Maternal, Newborn and Child Health Initiative|year=2010|url=http://www.prrinn-mnch.org/documents/ExecutiveSummary_WkshoponbringingPHCUOR_Apr10.pdf|accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Midwives service scheme ==\n\nDr. Pate pioneered the implementation of a national Midwives\u2019 Service Scheme (MSS) to address the high maternal and child morbidity and mortality.

He is well known for being the individual who introduced [[FBI]] [[Special Agent]] [[Joseph \"Donnie Brasco\" Pistone]] into the Bonanno family.\n\n==Early life==\nMirra was born to Albert Mirra and Millie Embarrato in Manhattan. He was the nephew of Bonanno family [[caporegime]] [[Alfred Embarrato]], and cousins of street soldier [[Joseph D'Amico]], capo [[Richard Cantarella]], capo Frank Cantarella, and Bonanno family capo Paul Cantarella.\n\nMirra was born in the poverty-stricken Lower East Side at [[Knickerbocker Village]] where he lived in the same apartment building as Embarrato, Richard Cantarella and D'Amico. Mirra was once a good friend of [[Benjamin Ruggiero|Benjamin \"Lefty\" Ruggiero]]; Mirra owned the Bus Stop Luncheonette<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia|title-link=Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia|last=Pistone|first=Joseph D|publisher=Signet|others=Assisted by Richard Woodley|year=1988|isbn=0451192575|location=New York, N.Y.|pages=|oclc=36631381|author-link=Joseph D.

His relatives D'Amico, Embarrato and Cantarella became involved in major racketeering schemes at ''[[The New York Post]]'' distribution center behind their housing complex, but Mirra moved on to more successful and prosperous racketeering endeavours.\n\n==Criminal career==\nMirra worked for Bonanno capo Michael Zaffarano, and was involved in [[extortion]], [[gambling]] and [[drug trafficking]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2010}} During the 1970s, Mirra confessed to the 1959 assassination of [[Anthony Carfano]] and comedian Alan Drake's wife, Janice Hansen Drake. He stood at 6'3\" and weighed 230 pounds. ''[[The New York Times]]'' correspondent Ralph Blumenthal described Mirra's appearance as \"[[Zorba the Greek|Zorba]]-like\". Mirra never drank alcohol, only [[ginger ale]].\n\nMirra remained a [[recluse]] from his fellow mobsters including his own relatives, which included Richard Cantarella, and eventually even became estranged from his uncle Alfred. Mirra was the first contact FBI agent Joseph Pistone made in his undercover operation, which led to his infiltration of the Bonanno family.<ref name=\"crime beat\">{{cite news|title=Joe Pistone's Unfinished Mob Business|publisher=Orchard Press Mysteries|date=2007-12-30|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=fhBwVP1t16MC&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78&dq=donnie+brasco+jilly+greca&source=bl&ots=HA4n8pPQV3&sig=ACfU3U1_6VO6Qdf71VGDpCOcWIEO7SL4cw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjqnLnqvarnAhXFF80KHbQYD9UQ6AEwEHoECA0QAQ#v=onepage&q=donnie%20brasco%20jilly%20greca&f=false}}</ref> Pistone was working as an associate for the [[Colombo family]] at the time. Mirra introduced Pistone to \"Lefty\" Ruggiero and offered him a job handling his slot-machine route. Pistone went under the name \"Donnie Brasco\" and posed as a jewel thief.\n\nIn 1977,<ref name=\":0\" /> Mirra fled [[New York (state)|New York]] after being indicted for drug trafficking. The FBI caught up with him three months later and he was sent to federal prison again for eight and a half years. When Mirra got out of jail, Brasco had since become close with Ruggiero and was working under him. Mirra argued that Brasco belonged to him, not Ruggiero. Mirra took the issue right to the top and had several meetings over the situation. In the end, Ruggiero won.\n\nAfter the sudden death of his capo, Michael Zaffarano, Mirra took over the Bonanno family [[pornography]] empire and worked under the powerful Sicilian capo [[Cesare Bonventre]]. Mirra also muscled in on several Little Italy, Manhattan, restaurants and bars. He was involved in a [[vending machine]] operation that dealt in [[slot machine]]s, peanut vending machines, [[video arcade]] machines and [[pinball]] machines that were distributed all over New York City. He had them installed in stores, luncheonettes, [[social club]]s and after-hours establishments.\n\nThe slot machines, since they were illegal, would be installed in the establishment's back room or basement. The coin collection route produced $2,000 a week, and he would open the machines with a key he carried and give the store owner his cut of the profits ($25 and up). Mirra was involved in \"strong arm\" schemes and extorted from several bars and restaurants. Each of the owners would pay him $5,000 a week in protection money and he would become angry if he did not receive the money.\n\n==Bonanno civil war==\nIn 1979, following the takeover of [[Philip Rastelli]] as leader of the Bonanno family, the family divided into two rival factions. The \"Red\" Team led by capos [[Alphonse \"Sonny Red\" Indelicato]], [[Dominick Trinchera]] and [[Philip Giaccone]], and the \"Black\" Team led by [[Dominick \"Sonny Black\" Napolitano]] and [[Joseph Massino]]. The day before Giaccone, Trinchera and Indelicato were to be ambushed and executed, Mirra announced at the Toyland Social Club to [[Nicholas Marangello]] that he was joining the opposition.\n\nOn May 5, 1981, the day of the executions, Napolitano called Mirra's uncle, [[Albert Embarrato]], and told him to come down to [[The Motion Lounge]] for a \"sit down\". At the sit down, Napolitano had two of his soldiers flank Embarrato on either side until Napolitano received confirmation that the executions were followed through. Napolitano would later tell Pistone, \"When he (Albert) heard that, he turned ash white. He thought we were going to hit him too. But I just reamed at him about Tony, told him Tony was no good; and that he (Albert) better recognize that and act right himself.\" Embarrato agreed.\n\n==Operation Donnie Brasco and death==\nIn mid-1981, when Pistone was revealed as an FBI agent, \"Sonny Black\" Napolitano, \"Lefty\" Ruggiero, and Mirra were all on the firing line for initially allowing the infiltration. Mirra went into hiding. [[Joseph Massino]] ordered Mirra's uncle [[Alfred Embarrato]] and Mirra's two cousins, [[Richard Cantarella]] and [[Joseph D'Amico]], to find and kill him. On February 18, 1982, [[Joseph D'Amico]], lured him to a parking garage in Lower Manhattan. Embarrato and Cantarella were waiting in a getaway car. The pair went to the parking garage, climbed into Mirra's car, and drove up to a locked security gate. D'Amico would later describe in a testimony, \"He took out his key, put it in the box, but he didn\u2019t get a chance to turn the box... I shot him at close range several times on the side of his head.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2004/06/17/tight-hit-family-close-cuz-chosen-to-kill-brasco-wiseguy/|publisher=nypost.com|title=TIGHT-HIT FAMILY \u2013 CLOSE CUZ CHOSEN TO KILL \u2018BRASCO\u2019 WISEGUY|date=June 17, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2004/06/17/family-ties-made-it-easy-to-whack-cuz-mob-thug/|title=FAMILY TIES MADE IT EASY TO WHACK CUZ: MOB THUG|publisher=nypost.com|date=June 17, 2004}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130914160050/http://thefbifiles.com/?p=267 FBI Files pertaining to Anthony Mirra]\n* Carpenter, Teresa, ''Mob Girl: The biography of Arlyne Weiss''\n*Crittle, Simon, ''The Last Godfather: The Rise and Fall of Joey Massino'' Berkley (March 7, 2006) {{ISBN|0-425-20939-3}}\n*Dearborn, Mary V., ''Mailer: A Biography'' Mariner Books (December 10, 2001) {{ISBN|0-618-15460-4}}\n*May, Allan, ''Colletti & Drake: Women In the Wrong Place At the Wrong Time''\n*Pistone, Joseph D. and Woodley, Richard, ''[[Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia]]'' Random House 1990 {{ISBN|5-552-53129-9}}\n*Pistone, Joseph D.; & Brandt, Charles (2007).

He is well known for being the individual who introduced [[FBI]] [[Special Agent]] [[Joseph \"Donnie Brasco\" Pistone]] into the Bonanno family.\n\n==Early life==\nMirra was born to Albert Mirra and Millie Embarrato in Manhattan. He was the nephew of Bonanno family [[caporegime]] [[Alfred Embarrato]], and cousins of street soldier [[Joseph D'Amico]], capo [[Richard Cantarella]], capo Frank Cantarella, and Bonanno family capo Paul Cantarella.\n\nMirra was born in the poverty-stricken Lower East Side at [[Knickerbocker Village]] where he lived in the same apartment building as Embarrato, Richard Cantarella and D'Amico. Mirra was once a good friend of [[Benjamin Ruggiero|Benjamin \"Lefty\" Ruggiero]]; Mirra owned the Bus Stop Luncheonette<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia|title-link=Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia|last=Pistone|first=Joseph D|publisher=Signet|others=Assisted by Richard Woodley|year=1988|isbn=0451192575|location=New York, N.Y.|pages=|oclc=36631381|author-link=Joseph D. Pistone}}</ref> in [[Little Italy, Manhattan]] not far from Ruggiero's [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]. His relatives D'Amico, Embarrato and Cantarella became involved in major racketeering schemes at ''[[The New York Post]]'' distribution center behind their housing complex, but Mirra moved on to more successful and prosperous racketeering endeavours.\n\n==Criminal career==\nMirra worked for Bonanno capo Michael Zaffarano, and was involved in [[extortion]], [[gambling]] and [[drug trafficking]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2010}} During the 1970s, Mirra confessed to the 1959 assassination of [[Anthony Carfano]] and comedian Alan Drake's wife, Janice Hansen Drake. He stood at 6'3\" and weighed 230 pounds. ''[[The New York Times]]'' correspondent Ralph Blumenthal described Mirra's appearance as \"[[Zorba the Greek|Zorba]]-like\". Mirra never drank alcohol, only [[ginger ale]].\n\nMirra remained a [[recluse]] from his fellow mobsters including his own relatives, which included Richard Cantarella, and eventually even became estranged from his uncle Alfred. Mirra was the first contact FBI agent Joseph Pistone made in his undercover operation, which led to his infiltration of the Bonanno family.<ref name=\"crime beat\">{{cite news|title=Joe Pistone's Unfinished Mob Business|publisher=Orchard Press Mysteries|date=2007-12-30|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=fhBwVP1t16MC&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78&dq=donnie+brasco+jilly+greca&source=bl&ots=HA4n8pPQV3&sig=ACfU3U1_6VO6Qdf71VGDpCOcWIEO7SL4cw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjqnLnqvarnAhXFF80KHbQYD9UQ6AEwEHoECA0QAQ#v=onepage&q=donnie%20brasco%20jilly%20greca&f=false}}</ref> Pistone was working as an associate for the [[Colombo family]] at the time. He introduced Pistone to \"Lefty\" Ruggiero and offered him a job handling his slot-machine route. Pistone went under the name \"Donnie Brasco\" and posed as a jewel thief.\n\nIn 1977,<ref name=\":0\" /> Mirra fled [[New York (state)|New York]] after being indicted for drug trafficking. The FBI caught up with him three months later and he was sent to federal prison again for eight and a half years. When Mirra got out of jail, Brasco had since become close with Ruggiero and was working under him. Mirra argued that Brasco belonged to him, not Ruggiero. Mirra took the issue right to the top and had several meetings over the situation. In the end, Ruggiero won.\n\nAfter the sudden death of his capo, Michael Zaffarano, Mirra took over the Bonanno family [[pornography]] empire and worked under the powerful Sicilian capo [[Cesare Bonventre]]. Mirra also muscled in on several Little Italy, Manhattan, restaurants and bars. He was involved in a [[vending machine]] operation that dealt in [[slot machine]]s, peanut vending machines, [[video arcade]] machines and [[pinball]] machines that were distributed all over New York City. He had them installed in stores, luncheonettes, [[social club]]s and after-hours establishments.\n\nThe slot machines, since they were illegal, would be installed in the establishment's back room or basement. The coin collection route produced $2,000 a week, and he would open the machines with a key he carried and give the store owner his cut of the profits ($25 and up). Mirra was involved in \"strong arm\" schemes and extorted from several bars and restaurants. Each of the owners would pay him $5,000 a week in protection money and he would become angry if he did not receive the money.\n\n==Bonanno civil war==\nIn 1979, following the takeover of [[Philip Rastelli]] as leader of the Bonanno family, the family divided into two rival factions. The \"Red\" Team led by capos [[Alphonse \"Sonny Red\" Indelicato]], [[Dominick Trinchera]] and [[Philip Giaccone]], and the \"Black\" Team led by [[Dominick \"Sonny Black\" Napolitano]] and [[Joseph Massino]]. The day before Giaccone, Trinchera and Indelicato were to be ambushed and executed, Mirra announced at the Toyland Social Club to [[Nicholas Marangello]] that he was joining the opposition.\n\nOn May 5, 1981, the day of the executions, Napolitano called Mirra's uncle, [[Albert Embarrato]], and told him to come down to [[The Motion Lounge]] for a \"sit down\". At the sit down, Napolitano had two of his soldiers flank Embarrato on either side until Napolitano received confirmation that the executions were followed through. Napolitano would later tell Pistone, \"When he (Albert) heard that, he turned ash white. He thought we were going to hit him too. But I just reamed at him about Tony, told him Tony was no good; and that he (Albert) better recognize that and act right himself.\" Embarrato agreed.\n\n==Operation Donnie Brasco and death==\nIn mid-1981, when Pistone was revealed as an FBI agent, \"Sonny Black\" Napolitano, \"Lefty\" Ruggiero, and Mirra were all on the firing line for initially allowing the infiltration. Mirra went into hiding. [[Joseph Massino]] ordered Mirra's uncle [[Alfred Embarrato]] and Mirra's two cousins, [[Richard Cantarella]] and [[Joseph D'Amico]], to find and kill him. On February 18, 1982, [[Joseph D'Amico]], lured him to a parking garage in Lower Manhattan. Embarrato and Cantarella were waiting in a getaway car. The pair went to the parking garage, climbed into Mirra's car, and drove up to a locked security gate. D'Amico would later describe in a testimony, \"He took out his key, put it in the box, but he didn\u2019t get a chance to turn the box... I shot him at close range several times on the side of his head.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2004/06/17/tight-hit-family-close-cuz-chosen-to-kill-brasco-wiseguy/|publisher=nypost.com|title=TIGHT-HIT FAMILY \u2013 CLOSE CUZ CHOSEN TO KILL \u2018BRASCO\u2019 WISEGUY|date=June 17, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2004/06/17/family-ties-made-it-easy-to-whack-cuz-mob-thug/|title=FAMILY TIES MADE IT EASY TO WHACK CUZ: MOB THUG|publisher=nypost.com|date=June 17, 2004}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130914160050/http://thefbifiles.com/?p=267 FBI Files pertaining to Anthony Mirra]\n* Carpenter, Teresa, ''Mob Girl: The biography of Arlyne Weiss''\n*Crittle, Simon, ''The Last Godfather: The Rise and Fall of Joey Massino'' Berkley (March 7, 2006) {{ISBN|0-425-20939-3}}\n*Dearborn, Mary V., ''Mailer: A Biography'' Mariner Books (December 10, 2001) {{ISBN|0-618-15460-4}}\n*May, Allan, ''Colletti & Drake: Women In the Wrong Place At the Wrong Time''\n*Pistone, Joseph D. and Woodley, Richard, ''[[Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia]]'' Random House 1990 {{ISBN|5-552-53129-9}}\n*Pistone, Joseph D.; & Brandt, Charles (2007).
