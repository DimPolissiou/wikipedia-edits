Formed on 1 July 1940 as part of the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]], the unit was raised for service during [[World War II]]. Originally formed as part of the [[8th Division (Australia)|8th Australian Division]] the brigade was subsequently transferred to the newly created [[9th Division (Australia)|9th Australian Division]] in December. The brigade served during the [[Western Desert Campaign]], forming part of the Allied garrison during the [[Siege of Tobruk]]. Later, the brigade was withdrawn to Syria for occupation duties, but then later took part in the [[First Battle of El Alamein|First]] and [[Second Battle of El Alamein|Second Battles of El Alamein]]. In early 1943, the brigade was returned to Australia to fight against the Japanese in the Pacific. In 1943\u20131944, the brigade fought in New Guinea, taking part in the [[landing at Lae]] and the [[Huon Peninsula campaign]]. Its final campaign came late in the war, when it took part in the [[Battle of Labuan|Labuan landings]] and the [[Battle of North Borneo]] in mid-1945. After the war, the brigade was disbanded in early 1946.\n\n==History==\n===Formation===\nThe brigade was formed on 1 July 1940 as part of the all volunteer [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] (2nd AIF). Consisting of three infantry battalions \u2013 the [[2/25th Battalion (Australia)|2/25th]], [[2/28th Battalion (Australia)|2/28th]] and [[2/43rd Battalion (Australia)|2/43rd]] \u2013 the brigade was recruited from Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia. It opened its headquarters at [[Keperra, Queensland|Grovely]], but moved to [[Enoggera, Queensland|Enoggera]] a month later; its constituent units completed their training in their home locations, though. Upon establishment, the brigade was assigned to the [[8th Division (Australia)|8th Division]]. The brigade's Queensland based battalion, the 2/25th, was detached in October 1940 and sent to garrison [[Darwin, Northern Territory]];{{sfn|Draydon|2001|p=23}} the same month, the 24th Brigade was transferred to the newly formed [[9th Division (Australia)|9th Division]]. This was part of a reorganisation of the 2nd AIF, which saw the less experienced units moved to the 9th Division, while those that were ready for combat were moved to the 7th Division.{{sfn|Johnston|2002|pp=2\u20133}} The 2/25th Battalion was later transferred to the [[25th Brigade (Australia)|25th Brigade]], while it was replaced by the [[2/32nd Battalion (Australia)|2/32nd Battalion]], which had been formed in the United Kingdom and would marry up with the brigade in the [[Middle East]].<ref name=AWM>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11283.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407134738/https://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11283.asp |title=2/32nd Battalion |work=Second World War, 1939\u20131945 units|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=17 July 2012|archivedate=7 April 2012}}</ref> In December 1940, the 24th Brigade embarked for the Middle East, arriving in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in February 1941, where the brigade concentrated, bringing together all three of its battalions for the first time.{{sfn|McKenzie-Smith|2018|p=2101}} The brigade's first commander was Brigadier [[Eric Plant]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/plant-eric-clive-pegus-11434/text20377 |title=Plant, Eric Clive Pegus (1890\u20131950) |author=Sutton, R. |work=Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 16 |publisher=Melbourne University Press |year=2002 |accessdate=29 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Middle East===\n[[File:Bren carriers from the Australian 2-43rd Inf Bn on manouevres Syria (AWM photo 024402).jpg|thumb|left|Bren carriers from the 24th Brigade on manoeuvre in Syria, June 1942|alt=A tracked military vehicle moves across the desert]]\n\nThe initial fighting in the [[Western Desert Campaign]] had been undertaken by the Australian [[6th Division (Australia)|6th Division]], which had launched a series of attacks in January 1941, with the [[Battle of Bardia]]. As the most experienced and prepared formation, it was subsequently sent to [[Battle of Greece|Greece]] to help defend against a German invasion there. To free the 6th Division up, the 9th Division was sent to relieve them around [[Benghazi]].

In July and August, they held the Salient, taking over from the [[20th Brigade (Australia)|20th Brigade]]; in this sector they carried out patrols and launched a minor attack.{{sfn|Wilmot|1993|pp=198\u2013203}} Elsewhere, they carried out raids against Italian positions in May and then again in September.{{sfn|Wilmot|1993|pp=220 & 235}} Finally, in September 1941, the British [[16th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|16th Infantry Brigade]] relieved the 24th, which was withdrawn by sea back to Palestine, less the 2/43rd Battalion, which was withdrawn the following month.{{sfn|Wilmot|1993|p=284}}{{sfn|McKenzie-Smith|2018|p=2102}}\n\nA period of rest and reorganisation followed before the 9th Division was sent to Syria in January 1942, relieving the [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]], which was to return to Australia due to the threat posed by Japan's entry into the war. In Syria, the 9th Division formed part of the Allied garrison that had been established there following the [[Syria\u2013Lebanon campaign]]. Relieving the [[21st Brigade (Australia)|21st Brigade]], the 24th occupied positions in the interior, with its units spread out between Sir ed Danie, Haret Jedide, El Ayoun and Arle, although the 2/32nd moved from El Ayoun to [[Ramlieh]] in March. During May and June, the brigade rotated with the 26th Brigade to allow each formation to carry out collective training ahead of future operations, whilst still maintaining a defensive posture. By the end of June, the 9th Division received orders to return to Egypt, as the Germans began an offensive in North Africa that threatened the Allied base around [[Alexandria]]. The 24th Brigade established defensive positions around [[Lake Mariout|Lake Maryut]] in July, before being ordered to move forward to join the fighting in the [[First Battle of El Alamein]]. During this defensive battle, the brigade was temporarily detached to the British [[1st Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|1st Armoured Division]] and carried out raids from Ruweisat Ridge towards Alam Baoshaza. After returning to the 9th Division, the 24th Brigade carried out a series of attacks around the Qattara Track, Tel el Makh Khad and Ruin Ridge. During the assault on Ruin Ridge, the 2/28th Battalion suffered heavy losses when it became cut off, with the majority of the battalion eventually being taken prisoner. To make up for this loss, the [[2/3rd Pioneer Battalion (Australia)|2/3rd Pioneer Battalion]] was temporarily assigned to the brigade, whilst the 2/28th was rebuilt in Palestine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11279second_world_war.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403113604/http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11279second_world_war.asp |title=2/28th Battalion |work=Second World War, 1939\u20131945 units |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=3 July 2012 |archivedate=3 April 2012}}</ref> Meanwhile, the rest of the brigade fought to hold the German offensive and in September launched a series of raids in preparation for a coming offensive.{{sfn|McKenzie-Smith|2018|p=2102}}\n\n[[File:Australian 2-43rd Inf Bn mortar in 1942 (AWM image 024718).jpg|thumb|A mortar crew from the 24th Brigade during the fighting around El Alamein, 30 July 1942|alt=Soldiers loading a mortar tube in a desert position]]\n\nIn late October,  the Allies went on the offensive, launching the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]].

Throughout early October, the 2/43rd came under consistent attack, and it became clear to the Australians that the Japanese were preparing to launch a counter-attack. As a result the 24th Brigade's other two battalions, as well as the 9th Division's headquarters were landed by 11 October. The counter-attack came on 16 October, around Jivevaneng and around the coast, and the 24th Brigade was heavily involved in the fighting, eventually repelling the Japanese attack.

Within this campaign, the 24th Brigade was tasked with [[Battle of Labuan|landing on Labuan]], as part of the wider [[Battle of North Borneo]], in order to secure an anchorage in [[Brunei Bay]] for the [[British Pacific Fleet]].{{sfn|McKenzie-Smith|2018|p=2013}}\n\n[[File:Australian troops coming ashore at Jesselton wharf (AWM 120777).JPG |thumb|Troops from the 24th Brigade land at Jesselton, September 1945|alt=Soldiers disembark a landing craft at a makeshift wooden jetty]]\n\nStaging out of [[Morotai Island]], where they arrived in April 1945, the 24th Brigade carried out the landing on Labuan on 10 June.

Following the landing, the 2/43rd fought to secure the airfields at Labuan and Timalai, while the 2/28th undertook some hard fighting on the left of the Australian lodgement, in an area dubbed \"the Pocket\". This resistance was overcome by 21 June with tank support.{{sfn|Long|1963|pp=474\u2013475}}\n\nElsewhere, the 2/32nd Battalion subsequently landed on Labuan on 12 June, but was transferred to the mainland several days later, where it captured the town of [[Weston, Sabah|Weston]] before moving on towards [[Beaufort, Malaysia|Beaufort]].{{sfn|Long|1963|pp=472 & 475}} It was assessed that Beaufort was occupied by up to 1,000 Japanese defenders, and as a result, following the fighting on Labuan, the remainder of the 24th Brigade was landed on the mainland.

In October 1945, the brigade commander, Porter, marched out of the unit, and the 2/32nd Battalion's commander, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Scott, assumed administrative command, holding the position until early December 1945 when he was discharged but not replaced. The  [[Demobilisation of the Australian military after World War II|demobilisation]] process began in October and continued for several months. The first unit to be declared redundant was the 2/28th Battalion which was moved back to Labuan in late October, in preparation for their return to Australia.<ref name=AWM822440/> Based on a priority system, each battalion began returning troops to Australia in drafts, as shipping became available.{{sfn|Combe|Ligertwood|Gilchrist|1992|pp=239\u2013242}}{{sfn|James|2009|pp=15\u201316}} Other troops were transferred to the [[66th Battalion (Australia)|66th Infantry Battalion]] for further service as occupation troops.<ref name=AWM822440/> Meanwhile, a vocational education and training program was implemented to prepare the soldiers for their return to civilian life and to keep them occupied while they waited for demobilisation.{{sfn|Long|1963|pp=500\u2013501}} In mid-December, the brigade's headquarters moved from Papar to Labuan and a large draft of personnel were returned to Australia.

Formed on 1 July 1940 as part of the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]], the unit was raised for service during [[World War II]]. Originally formed as part of the [[8th Division (Australia)|8th Australian Division]] the brigade was subsequently transferred to the newly created [[9th Division (Australia)|9th Australian Division]] in December. The brigade served during the [[Western Desert Campaign]], forming part of the Allied garrison during the [[Siege of Tobruk]]. Later, the brigade was withdrawn to Syria for occupation duties, but then later took part in the [[First Battle of El Alamein|First]] and [[Second Battle of El Alamein|Second Battles of El Alamein]]. In early 1943, the brigade was returned to Australia to fight against the Japanese in the Pacific. In 1943\u20131944, the brigade fought in New Guinea, taking part in the [[landing at Lae]] and the [[Huon Peninsula campaign]]. Its final campaign came late in the war, when it took part in the [[Battle of Labuan|Labuan landings]] and the [[Battle of North Borneo]] in mid-1945. After the war, the brigade was disbanded in early 1946.\n\n==History==\n===Formation===\nThe brigade was formed on 1 July 1940 as part of the all volunteer [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] (2nd AIF). Consisting of three infantry battalions \u2013 the [[2/25th Battalion (Australia)|2/25th]], [[2/28th Battalion (Australia)|2/28th]] and [[2/43rd Battalion (Australia)|2/43rd]] \u2013 the brigade was recruited from Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia. It opened its headquarters at [[Keperra, Queensland|Grovely]], but moved to [[Enoggera, Queensland|Enoggera]] a month later; its constituent units completed their training in their home locations, though. Upon establishment, the brigade was assigned to the [[8th Division (Australia)|8th Division]]. The brigade's Queensland based battalion, the 2/25th, was detached in October 1940 and sent to garrison [[Darwin, Northern Territory]];{{sfn|Draydon|2001|p=23}} the same month, the 24th Brigade was transferred to the newly formed [[9th Division (Australia)|9th Division]]. This was part of a reorganisation of the 2nd AIF, which saw the less experienced units moved to the 9th Division, while those that were ready for combat were moved to the 7th Division.{{sfn|Johnston|2002|pp=2\u20133}} The 2/25th Battalion was later transferred to the [[25th Brigade (Australia)|25th Brigade]], while it was replaced by the [[2/32nd Battalion (Australia)|2/32nd Battalion]], which had been formed in the United Kingdom and would marry up with the brigade in the [[Middle East]].<ref name=AWM>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11283.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407134738/https://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11283.asp |title=2/32nd Battalion |work=Second World War, 1939\u20131945 units|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=17 July 2012|archivedate=7 April 2012}}</ref> In December 1940, the 24th Brigade embarked for the Middle East, arriving in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in February 1941, where the brigade concentrated, bringing together all three of its battalions for the first time.{{sfn|McKenzie-Smith|2018|p=2101}} The brigade's first commander was Brigadier [[Eric Plant]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/plant-eric-clive-pegus-11434/text20377 |title=Plant, Eric Clive Pegus (1890\u20131950) |author=Sutton, R. |work=Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 16 |publisher=Melbourne University Press |year=2002 |accessdate=29 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Middle East===\n[[File:Bren carriers from the Australian 2-43rd Inf Bn on manouevres Syria (AWM photo 024402).jpg|thumb|left|Bren carriers from the 24th Brigade on manoeuvre in Syria, June 1942|alt=A tracked military vehicle moves across the desert]]\n\nThe initial fighting in the [[Western Desert Campaign]] had been undertaken by the Australian [[6th Division (Australia)|6th Division]], which had launched a series of attacks in January 1941, with the [[Battle of Bardia]]. As the most experienced and prepared formation, it was subsequently sent to [[Battle of Greece|Greece]] to help defend against a German invasion there. To free the 6th Division up, the 9th Division was sent to relieve them around [[Benghazi]]. The 24th Brigade had not completed its training, so it was held back around [[Tobruk]] during this time, and placed in reserve.{{sfn|McKenzie-Smith|2018|pp=2101\u20132102}} The 2/32nd joined the brigade at this time.<ref name=AWM/> In February 1941, Brigadier  [[Arthur Harry Langham Godfrey|Arthur Godfrey]], who had previously commanded the [[2/6th Battalion (Australia)|2/6th Battalion]], took over command of the 24th Brigade.{{sfn|Wilmot|1993|p=198}} After [[Operation Sonnenblume|German forces landed]] around [[Tripoli]] to reinforce the Italians in North Africa, a large scale withdrawal began as the British and Australian forces were pushed back towards Tobruk, which was subsequently surrounded and placed under siege.{{sfn|Wilmot|1993|pp=65\u201383}} The 9th Division was subsequently assigned to the eastern sector of the Allied perimeter and over the brigade undertook defensive duties for the next several months, rotating around the position. In July and August, they held the Salient, taking over from the [[20th Brigade (Australia)|20th Brigade]]; in this sector they carried out patrols and launched a minor attack.{{sfn|Wilmot|1993|pp=198\u2013203}} Elsewhere, they carried out raids against Italian positions in May and then again in September.{{sfn|Wilmot|1993|pp=220 & 235}} Finally, in September 1941, the British [[16th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|16th Infantry Brigade]] relieved the 24th, which was withdrawn by sea back to Palestine, less the 2/43rd Battalion, which was withdrawn the following month.{{sfn|Wilmot|1993|p=284}}{{sfn|McKenzie-Smith|2018|p=2102}}\n\nA period of rest and reorganisation followed before the 9th Division was sent to Syria in January 1942, relieving the [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]], which was to return to Australia due to the threat posed by Japan's entry into the war. In Syria, the 9th Division formed part of the Allied garrison that had been established there following the [[Syria\u2013Lebanon campaign]]. Relieving the [[21st Brigade (Australia)|21st Brigade]], the 24th occupied positions in the interior, with its units spread out between Sir ed Danie, Haret Jedide, El Ayoun and Arle, although the 2/32nd moved from El Ayoun to [[Ramlieh]] in March. During May and June, the brigade rotated with the 26th Brigade to allow each formation to carry out collective training ahead of future operations, whilst still maintaining a defensive posture. By the end of June, the 9th Division received orders to return to Egypt, as the Germans began an offensive in North Africa that threatened the Allied base around [[Alexandria]]. The 24th Brigade established defensive positions around [[Lake Mariout|Lake Maryut]] in July, before being ordered to move forward to join the fighting in the [[First Battle of El Alamein]]. During this defensive battle, the brigade was temporarily detached to the British [[1st Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|1st Armoured Division]] and carried out raids from Ruweisat Ridge towards Alam Baoshaza. After returning to the 9th Division, the 24th Brigade carried out a series of attacks around the Qattara Track, Tel el Makh Khad and Ruin Ridge. During the assault on Ruin Ridge, the 2/28th Battalion suffered heavy losses when it became cut off, with the majority of the battalion eventually being taken prisoner. To make up for this loss, the [[2/3rd Pioneer Battalion (Australia)|2/3rd Pioneer Battalion]] was temporarily assigned to the brigade, whilst the 2/28th was rebuilt in Palestine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11279second_world_war.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403113604/http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11279second_world_war.asp |title=2/28th Battalion |work=Second World War, 1939\u20131945 units |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=3 July 2012 |archivedate=3 April 2012}}</ref> Meanwhile, the rest of the brigade fought to hold the German offensive and in September launched a series of raids in preparation for a coming offensive.{{sfn|McKenzie-Smith|2018|p=2102}}\n\n[[File:Australian 2-43rd Inf Bn mortar in 1942 (AWM image 024718).jpg|thumb|A mortar crew from the 24th Brigade during the fighting around El Alamein, 30 July 1942|alt=Soldiers loading a mortar tube in a desert position]]\n\nIn late October,  the Allies went on the offensive, launching the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]].

Here they began reorganising for jungle warfare, in preparation for deployment to [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]]. After amphibious warfare training  around [[Cairns, Queensland|Cairns]], the brigade took part in the [[Landing at Lae|capture of Lae]],{{sfn|McKenzie-Smith|2018|p=2103}} which envisaged a two-pronged assault with the 7th Division advancing from [[Nadzab]].{{sfn|Keogh|1965|p=299}} Assigned as a follow on force, in early September 1943 the brigade staged out of [[Buna, Papua New Guinea|Buna]], and arrived at the landing beach {{convert|16|mi}} east of Lae, several days after the initial landing by the 20th and 26th Brigades. The 26th Brigade had led the advance towards Lae, but was replaced by the 24th, which took over the advance along the coast at the Burep River, while the 26th Brigade pushed inland. Heavy rain flooded the Busu River, and held up the advance, however, with the support of US engineers from [[2nd Engineer Special Brigade]] the 24th Brigade was able to force their way across and continue the advance towards Malahang airfield, where they defeated strong Japanese resistance on 15 September before linking up with the [[25th Brigade (Australia)|25th Brigade]], which had advanced from Nadzab.{{sfn|Keogh|1965|pp=310\u2013311}} In the aftermath, the 2/32nd provided a detachment to secure the [[Tami Islands]], where a radar station was built, while the rest of the brigade concentrated around the Burep River to prepare for future operations.{{sfn|McKenzie-Smith|2018|p=2103}}\n\n[[File:Australian 2-43rd Inf Bn embarking from Cairns August 1943 (AWM image 055354).jpg|thumb|left|Troops from the 24th Brigade embark at Cairns, 8 August 1943, bound for New Guinea|alt=Soldiers at a wharf prepare to embark for overseas]]\n\nAfter the capture of Lae, the Allies decided to follow up their success with another amphibious operation to secure [[Finschaffen]], as part of plans to secure control of the [[Huon Peninsula campaign|Huon Peninsula]] and [[Vitiaz Strait]].{{sfn|Dexter|1961|pp=444\u2013445}} The initial [[Landing at Scarlet Beach]] was carried out by the 20th Brigade, although the 2/43rd Battalion was detached from the 24th Brigade in late September to help defend the beachhead.{{sfn|McKenzie-Smith|2018|p=2013}} The 2/43rd subsequently took up a blocking posting around Jivevaneng, relieving the [[2/17th Battalion (Australia)|2/17th Battalion]], while the main elements of the 20th Brigade advanced south to [[Battle of Finschhafen|capture of Finschhafen]]. Throughout early October, the 2/43rd came under consistent attack, and it became clear to the Australians that the Japanese were preparing to launch a counter-attack. As a result the 24th Brigade's other two battalions, as well as the 9th Division's headquarters were landed by 11 October. The counter-attack came on 16 October, around Jivevaneng and around the coast, and the 24th Brigade was heavily involved in the fighting, eventually repelling the Japanese attack.

Within this campaign, the 24th Brigade was tasked with [[Battle of Labuan|landing on Labuan]], as part of the wider [[Battle of North Borneo]], in order to secure an anchorage in [[Brunei Bay]] for the [[British Pacific Fleet]].{{sfn|McKenzie-Smith|2018|p=2013}}\n\n[[File:Australian troops coming ashore at Jesselton wharf (AWM 120777).JPG |thumb|Troops from the 24th Brigade land at Jesselton, September 1945|alt=Soldiers disembark a landing craft at a makeshift wooden jetty]]\n\nStaging out of [[Morotai Island]], where they arrived in April 1945, the 24th Brigade carried out the landing on Labuan on 10 June.

Following the landing, the 2/43rd fought to secure the airfields at Labuan and Timalai, while the 2/28th undertook some hard fighting on the left of the Australian lodgement, in an area dubbed \"the Pocket\". This resistance was overcome by 21 June with tank support.{{sfn|Long|1963|pp=474\u2013475}}\n\nElsewhere, the 2/32nd Battalion subsequently landed on Labuan on 12 June, but was transferred to the mainland several days later, where it captured the town of [[Weston, Sabah|Weston]] before moving on towards [[Beaufort, Malaysia|Beaufort]].{{sfn|Long|1963|pp=472 & 475}} It was assessed that Beaufort was occupied by up to 1,000 Japanese defenders, and as a result, following the fighting on Labuan, the remainder of the 24th Brigade was landed on the mainland.

During this time, the brigade's battalions were spread out between [[Papar, Malaysia|Papar]], [[Jesselton]], [[Membakut]], and [[Beaufort, Malaysia|Beaufort]].  In October 1945, the brigade commander, Porter, marched out of the unit, and the 2/32nd Battalion's commander, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Scott, assumed administrative command, holding the position until early December 1945 when he was discharged but not replaced. The  [[Demobilisation of the Australian military after World War II|demobilisation]] process began in October and continued for several months. The first unit to be declared redundant was the 2/28th Battalion which was moved back to Labuan in late October, in preparation for their return to Australia.<ref name=AWM822440/> Based on a priority system, each battalion began returning troops to Australia in drafts, as shipping became available.{{sfn|Combe|Ligertwood|Gilchrist|1992|pp=239\u2013242}}{{sfn|James|2009|pp=15\u201316}} Other troops were transferred to the [[66th Battalion (Australia)|66th Infantry Battalion]] for further service as occupation troops.<ref name=AWM822440/> Meanwhile, a vocational education and training program was implemented to prepare the soldiers for their return to civilian life and to keep them occupied while they waited for demobilisation.{{sfn|Long|1963|pp=500\u2013501}} In mid-December, the brigade's headquarters moved from Papar to Labuan and a large draft of personnel were returned to Australia. The final draft from the 24th Brigade embarked on the transport ''Lake Charles Victory'' on 10/11 January 1946. They landed in [[Brisbane, Queensland|Brisbane]] ten days later and the brigade was disbanded at [[Chermside, Queensland|Chermside]] on 29 January 1946.<ref name=AWM822440>{{cite web |url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/C1365734 |title=AWM52 8/2/24/40: 24th Infantry Brigade: October 1945 \u2013 January 1946 |work=Unit war diaries, 1939\u20131945 |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=29 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Attached units==\nThe following units were assigned to the brigade during the war:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ordersofbattle.com/UnitData.aspx?UniX=1385&Tab=Sub|title=24 Australian Infantry Brigade: Unit Subordinates|work=Orders of Battle|accessdate=7 January 2010}}{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>{{sfn|Johnston|2002|p=xv}}\n*[[2/25th Battalion (Australia)|2/25th Battalion]] to [[25th Brigade (Australia)|25th Brigade]]{{sfn| Draydon|2001|pp=43\u201347}}\n*[[2/28th Battalion (Australia)|2/28th Battalion]]\n*[[2/43rd Battalion (Australia)|2/43rd Battalion]]\n*[[2/32nd Battalion (Australia)|2/32nd Battalion]] from 25th Brigade\n\n==Commanding officers==\nThe following officers commanded the 24th Brigade during the war:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ordersofbattle.com/Units/UnitAppointments?UniX=1385 |title=24 Australian Infantry Brigade: Command Appointments |work=Orders of Battle |accessdate=7 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074030/http://www.ordersofbattle.com/Units/UnitAppointments?UniX=1385 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{sfn|Johnston|2002|p=xv}}\n*  [[Brigadier]] [[Eric Plant]] (1940\u20131941)\n* Brigadier [[Arthur Harry Langham Godfrey|Arthur Godfrey]]  (1941\u20131942) \n* Brigadier [[Bernard Evans (brigadier)|Bernard Evans]] (1942\u20131943)\n* Brigadier [[Selwyn Porter]] (1943\u20131945)\n\n==References==\n'''Citations'''\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* {{cite book  |last1=Combe|first1=Gordon |last2=Ligertwood|first2=Frank |last3=Gilchrist|first3=Tom |origyear=1972 |year=1992 |title=The Second 43rd Australian Infantry Battalion 1940\u20131946 |location=Swanbourne, Western Australia |publisher= John Burridge Military Antiques |isbn=978-0-9599506-0-1|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Coulthard-Clark|first=Chris|title=Where Australians Fought: The Encyclopaedia of Australia's Battles|year=1998|edition=1st|publisher=Allen & Unwin|location=St Leonards, New South Wales|isbn=1-86448-611-2 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Dexter|first=David|title=The New Guinea Offensives| series=Australia in the War of 1939\u20131945, Series 1\u2014Army.

For example, the following data satisfy the parallel condition. In parallel data, even if a correlation matrix is used instead of a covariance matrix, there is no loss of information. All parallel data are also tau-equivalent, but the reverse is not true.

For example, the following data satisfies the condition of being tau-equivalent. All items in tau-equivalent data have equal discrimination or importance.

Combining row and column names gives the prerequisites for the corresponding reliability coefficient. For example, Cronbach's <math>\\alpha</math> and Guttman's <math>\\lambda_3</math> are reliability coefficients derived under the condition of being unidimensional and tau-equivalent.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Conventional names of reliability coefficients\n|-\n!  !!

Conventional names give no information about the nature of each coefficient, or give inaccurate information (e.g., composite reliability). Conventional names are inconsistent. Some are formulas, and others are coefficients. Some are named after the original developer, some are named after someone who is not the original developer, and others do not include the name of any person. While one formula is referred to by multiple names, multiple formulas are referred to by one notation (e.g., alphas and omegas).

Psychometrika, 2(3), 151\u2013160. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02288391</ref> developed several reliability coefficients that could overcome the problem of <math>\\rho_{SP}</math>. They did not give the reliability coefficients particular names. Equation 20 in their article is <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. This formula is often referred to as Kuder-Richardson formula 20, or KR-20. They dealt with cases where the observed scores were dichotomous (e.g., correct or incorrect), so the expression of KR-20 is slightly different from the conventional formula of <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. A review of this paper reveals that they did not present a general formula because they did not need to, not because they were not able to. Let <math>p_i</math> denote the correct answer ratio of item <math>i </math>, and <math>q_i</math> denote the incorrect answer ratio of item <math>i</math> (<math>p_i + q_i = 1 </math>).

Guttman<ref name = Guttman/> said <math> \\lambda_3 </math> is \"algebraically identical\" to KR-20 (p.275). Gulliksen<ref name = Gulliksen/> also admitted that the two formulas are \u201cidentical\u201d(p.224). \n\nEven studies critical of KR-20 did not point out that the original formula of KR-20 could only be applied to dichotomous data.<ref name=c1943>Cronbach, L.

Journal of Educational Psychology, 34(8), 485\u2013494. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0058608</ref>\n\n====Criticism of underestimation of KR-20====\nDevelopers<ref name=KR/> of this formula reported that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> consistently underestimates reliability. Hoyt<ref name=Hoyt2>Hoyt, C. J. (1941). Note on a simplified method of computing test reliability: Educational and Psychological Measurement, 1(1). https://doi.org/10.1177/001316444100100109</ref> argued that this characteristic alone made <math> \\rho_{T}</math> more recommendable than the traditional split-half technique, which was unknown whether to underestimate or overestimate reliability.\n\nCronbach (1943)<ref name =c1943/> was critical of the underestimation of <math> \\rho_{T} </math>. He was concerned that it was not known how much <math> \\rho_{T} </math> underestimated reliability. He criticized that the underestimation was likely to be excessively severe, such that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could sometimes lead to negative values.\nBecause of these problems, he argued that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could not be recommended as an alternative to the split-half technique.\n=== Cronbach (1951) ===\nAs with previous studies<ref name = Hoyt /><ref name = Guttman /><ref name = JF /><ref name = Gulliksen />, Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> invented another method to derive <math>\\rho_{T} </math>. His interpretation was more intuitively attractive than those of previous studies. That is, he proved that <math> \\rho_ {T} </math> equals the average of <math> \\rho_{ST} </math> values obtained for all possible split-halves. He criticized that the name KR-20 was weird and suggested a new name, coefficient alpha. His approach has been a huge success. However, he not only omitted some key facts, but also gave an incorrect explanation.\n\nFirst, he positioned coefficient alpha as a general formula of KR-20, but omitted the explanation that existing studies have published the precisely identical formula. Those who read only Cronbach (1951) without background knowledge could misunderstand that he was the first to develop the general formula of KR-20. \n\nSecond, he did not explain under what condition <math>\\rho_{T}</math> equals reliability.

For example, the following data satisfy the parallel condition. In parallel data, even if a correlation matrix is used instead of a covariance matrix, there is no loss of information. All parallel data are also tau-equivalent, but the reverse is not true. That is, among the three conditions, the parallel condition is most difficult to meet.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>X_3</math>\n! <math>X_4</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>10</math>||<math>6</math>||<math>6</math>||<math>6</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>6</math> || <math>10</math>|| <math>6</math>|| <math>6</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_3</math>\n| <math>6</math> || <math>6</math> || <math>10</math>|| <math>6</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_4</math>\n| <math>6</math> || <math>6</math> || <math>6</math> || <math>10</math>\n|-\n\n|}\n=====Tau-equivalent condition=====\nAt the population level, tau-equivalent data have equal covariances, but their variances may have different values. For example, the following data satisfies the condition of being tau-equivalent. All items in tau-equivalent data have equal discrimination or importance. All tau-equivalent data are also congeneric, but the reverse is not true.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>X_3</math>\n! <math>X_4</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>10</math>||<math>6</math>||<math>6</math>||<math>6</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>6</math> || <math>12</math>|| <math>6</math>|| <math>6</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_3</math>\n| <math>6</math> || <math>6</math> || <math>9</math>|| <math>6</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_4</math>\n| <math>6</math> || <math>6</math> || <math>6</math> || <math>10</math>\n|-\n\n|}\n=====Congeneric condition=====\nAt the population level, congeneric data need not have equal variances or covariances, provided they are unidimensional. For example, the following data meet the condition of being congeneric. All items in congeneric data can have different discrimination or importance. For example, in the data below, the second item has a discrimination that is four times greater than the first item.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>X_3</math>\n! <math>X_4</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>5</math>||<math>4</math>||<math>3</math>||<math>2</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>4</math> || <math>20</math>|| <math>12</math>|| <math>8</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_3</math>\n| <math>3</math> || <math>12</math> || <math>13</math>|| <math>6</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_4</math>\n| <math>2</math> || <math>8</math> || <math>6</math> || <math>8</math>\n|-\n\n|}\n\n== Relationship with other reliability coefficients ==\n=== Classification of single-administration reliability coefficients ===\n====Conventional names====\nThere are numerous reliability coefficients.

Combining row and column names gives the prerequisites for the corresponding reliability coefficient. For example, Cronbach's <math>\\alpha</math> and Guttman's <math>\\lambda_3</math> are reliability coefficients derived under the condition of being unidimensional and tau-equivalent.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Conventional names of reliability coefficients\n|-\n!  !!

Conventional names give no information about the nature of each coefficient, or give inaccurate information (e.g., composite reliability). Conventional names are inconsistent. Some are formulas, and others are coefficients. Some are named after the original developer, some are named after someone who is not the original developer, and others do not include the name of any person. While one formula is referred to by multiple names, multiple formulas are referred to by one notation (e.g., alphas and omegas).

They did not give the reliability coefficients particular names. Equation 20 in their article is <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. This formula is often referred to as Kuder-Richardson formula 20, or KR-20. They dealt with cases where the observed scores were dichotomous (e.g., correct or incorrect), so the expression of KR-20 is slightly different from the conventional formula of <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. A review of this paper reveals that they did not present a general formula because they did not need to, not because they were not able to. Let <math>p_i</math> denote the correct answer ratio of item <math>i </math>, and <math>q_i</math> denote the incorrect answer ratio of item <math>i</math> (<math>p_i + q_i = 1 </math>).

Gulliksen<ref name = Gulliksen/> also admitted that the two formulas are \u201cidentical\u201d(p.224). \n\nEven studies critical of KR-20 did not point out that the original formula of KR-20 could only be applied to dichotomous data.<ref name=c1943>Cronbach, L. J. (1943). On estimates of test reliability. Journal of Educational Psychology, 34(8), 485\u2013494. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0058608</ref>\n\n====Criticism of underestimation of KR-20====\nDevelopers<ref name=KR/> of this formula reported that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> consistently underestimates reliability. Hoyt<ref name=Hoyt2>Hoyt, C. J. (1941). Note on a simplified method of computing test reliability: Educational and Psychological Measurement, 1(1). https://doi.org/10.1177/001316444100100109</ref> argued that this characteristic alone made <math> \\rho_{T}</math> more recommendable than the traditional split-half technique, which was unknown whether to underestimate or overestimate reliability.\n\nCronbach (1943)<ref name =c1943/> was critical of the underestimation of <math> \\rho_{T} </math>. He was concerned that it was not known how much <math> \\rho_{T} </math> underestimated reliability. He criticized that the underestimation was likely to be excessively severe, such that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could sometimes lead to negative values.\nBecause of these problems, he argued that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could not be recommended as an alternative to the split-half technique.\n=== Cronbach (1951) ===\nAs with previous studies<ref name = Hoyt /><ref name = Guttman /><ref name = JF /><ref name = Gulliksen />, Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> invented another method to derive <math>\\rho_{T} </math>. His interpretation was more intuitively attractive than those of previous studies. That is, he proved that <math> \\rho_ {T} </math> equals the average of <math> \\rho_{ST} </math> values obtained for all possible split-halves. He criticized that the name KR-20 was weird and suggested a new name, coefficient alpha. His approach has been a huge success. However, he not only omitted some key facts, but also gave an incorrect explanation.\n\nFirst, he positioned coefficient alpha as a general formula of KR-20, but omitted the explanation that existing studies have published the precisely identical formula. Those who read only Cronbach (1951) without background knowledge could misunderstand that he was the first to develop the general formula of KR-20. \n\nSecond, he did not explain under what condition <math>\\rho_{T}</math> equals reliability. Non-experts could misunderstand that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> is a general reliability coefficient that can be used for all data regardless of prerequisites. \n\nThird, he did not explain why he changed his attitude toward <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. In particular, he did not provide a clear answer to the underestimation problem of <math>\\rho_{T}</math>, which he himself<ref name = c1943 /> strongly criticized. \n\nFourth, he argued that a high value of <math>\\rho_{T}</math> indicated the unidimensionality of the data.\n\n===After 1951===\nNovick and Lewis (1967)<ref name = NL>Novick, M.

Psychometrika, 32(1), 1\u201313. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02289400</ref> proved the necessary and sufficient condition for <math>\\rho_{T}</math> to be equal to reliability, and named this condition essential tau-equivalence.\n\nCronbach (1978)<ref name = c1978/> mentioned that the reason Cronbach (1951) received a lot of citations was \"mostly because [he] put a brand name on a common-place coefficient\"(p.263)<ref name = Cho />. He explained that he had originally planned to name other types of reliability coefficients (e.g., inter-rater reliability or test-retest reliability) in consecutive Greek letter (e.g., <math>\\beta</math>, <math>\\gamma</math>, <math>\\ldots</math>), but later changed his mind.\n\nCronbach and Schavelson (2004)<ref name = c2004>Cronbach, L.

He opposed the use of the name Cronbach's alpha. He explicityly denied the existence of existing studies that had published the general formula of KR-20 prior to Cronbach (1951).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.open.ac.uk/socialsciences/spsstutorial/files/tutorials/cronbachs-alpha.pdf Cronbach's alpha SPSS tutorial]\n* The free web interface and R package cocron [http://comparingcronbachalphas.org] allows to statistically compare two or more dependent or independent cronbach alpha coefficients.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cronbach's Alpha}}\n[[Category:Comparison of assessments]]\n[[Category:Psychometrics]]\n[[Category:Educational psychology research methods]]\n", "name_user": "Eunscho", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAfter 1951", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronbach%27s_alpha"}
