The law required land claims to be filed within two years under the Kuleana Act of 1850, and many Hawaiians made no claim.<ref>{{cite book|last=Van Dyke|first=Jon M|title=Who Owns the Crown Lands of Hawai'i? |year=2007|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-3211-7|pages=44\u201349  |url={{google books|plainurl=yes|id=IjZPcGb2R08C}}}}</ref>\n\nEventually most of the land was sold by the government of the Republic and settlers from the continental US or auctioned to The [[Big Five (Hawaii)]] corporations.<ref>[http://wiki.grassrootinstitute.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=NHSC_Existing_Law%2C_Native_Hawaiians%2C_And_Compensation#Did_the_Native_Hawaiians_Have_Aboriginal_Title_to_the_Crown_and_Government_Lands.3F Native Hawaiians Study Commission Report - 1983] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829040457/http://wiki.grassrootinstitute.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=NHSC_Existing_Law%2C_Native_Hawaiians%2C_And_Compensation |date=2007-08-29 }}, p. 334</ref> This resulted in Hawai{{okina}}i having  about 32% of the land owned by the state, while another 4.8% is [[Hawaiian Homelands]].<ref>[http://www.hawaii.gov/dbedt/gis/download.htm Hawaii Statewide GIS Program]</ref>\n\n== Acts of 1850 ==\n\n=== Alien Land Ownership Act ===\n\nWhile opponents [[Kamehameha IV]], [[Kamehameha V]] and missionary physician [[Gerrit Judd]] were traveling, on July 10, 1850 the legislature passed the Alien Land Ownership Act.

It also abolished the right of cultivation and pasturage on the larger, common lands of the ahupua{{okina}}a, title of which went to the chief, the crown or the government.\n\nOwnership of land was a previously unknown concept for ordinary Hawaiians. Many did not understand the need to make a claim for land where they already lived and/or worked. Communication depended upon word-of-mouth or the ability to read the written word. Making a claim required money to pay for a pre-claim land survey.

Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appears in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' #1 ([[cover-date]]d Sept. 1963) as an adversary of the X-Men.\n\nThe character is a powerful [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], one of a fictional subspecies of humanity born with superhuman abilities, who has the ability to generate and control [[magnetic field]]s. Magneto regards mutants as evolutionarily superior to humans and rejects the possibility of peaceful human-mutant coexistence; he initially aimed to conquer the world to enable mutants, whom he refers to as ''homo superior'', to replace humans as the dominant species. Writers have since fleshed out his origins and motivations, revealing him to be a [[Holocaust survivors|Holocaust survivor]] whose extreme methods and cynical philosophy derive from his determination to protect mutants from suffering a similar fate at the hands of a world that fears and persecutes mutants. He is a friend of [[Professor X]], the leader of the X-Men, but their different philosophies cause a rift in their friendship at times.

Max's father, Jakob Eisenhardt, was a decorated [[World War I]] veteran.<ref name=\"testament1\"/> Surviving discrimination and hardship during the [[Nazism|Nazi rise to power]], the passing of the [[Nuremberg Laws]] in 1935, and [[Kristallnacht]], Max and his family fled to [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] where they were captured during the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion of Poland]] and sent to the [[Warsaw Ghetto]].<ref name=\"testament1\"/><ref name=\"classicxmen12\">''Classic X-Men'' #12</ref> Max and his family escaped the ghetto, only to be betrayed and captured again. His mother, father, and sister were executed and buried in a mass grave, but Max survived, possibly due to the manifestation of his mutant powers. Escaping from the mass grave, he was ultimately captured yet again<ref name=\"mutants1\">New Mutants #49</ref> and sent to [[Auschwitz]], where he eventually became a ''[[Sonderkommando]]''.<ref name=\"mutants1\"/><ref>Uncanny X-Men #274</ref><ref>Excalibur vol.3 #14</ref> While at Auschwitz, Eisenhardt reunited with a [[Romani people|Romani]] girl named Magda, whom he had fallen in love with when he was younger, and with whom he would escape the concentration camp during the [[Auschwitz concentration camp#Birkenau revolt|October 7, 1944 revolt]].\n\nFollowing the war, he and Magda moved to the Ukrainian city of [[Vinnytsia]], and Max adopted the name \"'''Magnus'''\". Magda and Magnus had a daughter named Anya, and lived uneventfully until an angry mob, spurred on by the first manifestation of Magnus' powers, burned down their home with Anya still inside. Magnus was enraged at the mob for preventing him from rescuing Anya, and his powers were unleashed, killing the mob and destroying a part of the city. Magda, terrified at Magnus' power, left him and later gave birth to the mutant twins [[Quicksilver (comics)|Pietro]] and [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda]] before she died. Wanted by the authorities for the deaths and destruction in Vinnytsia, and while searching for Magda, Magnus paid a Romanian forger, Georg Odekirk, to create the cover identity of \"'''Erik Lehnsherr''', the [[Sinte]] gypsy\".<ref name=\"xmen72\" /> \"Erik\" relocated to [[Israel]], where he met and befriended [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] while working at a psychiatric hospital near [[Haifa]] where [[Gabrielle Haller]] resided. There, the two debated the consequences humanity faced with the rise of mutants, though neither revealed to the other that they were mutants. However, they were forced to reveal their inherent abilities to one another while facing [[Baron Strucker]] and [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]]. Following the battle, Erik, realizing that his and Xavier's views were incompatible, left with a cache of hidden [[Nazi gold]], which provided him with the finances to pursue his goals.<ref name=\"uncanny1\"/>\n\n===Rise of Magneto===\n[[File:Xavmags.png|thumb|Magneto and Xavier would eventually part ways because of the differences in their beliefs on how to help mutants. Art by [[Carlos Pacheco]].]]\nMagneto's experiences surviving [[Nazi Germany]], [[Auschwitz]], and [[Vinnytsia]] would shape his outlook on the situation that mutants face in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Determined to keep such atrocities from ever being committed against mutantkind, he is willing to use deadly force to protect mutants. He would believe that mutants (\"''Homo superior''\") will become the dominant life form on the planet and would set about either creating a homeland on Earth where mutants could live peacefully, or conquering and enslaving humanity in the name of mutantkind.\n\nMagneto's first villainous act is attacking a United States military base called Cape Citadel after bringing down missiles. He is driven off by Charles Xavier's mutant students, the [[X-Men]], in their first mission.<ref>''X-Men'' #1</ref> He creates [[Asteroid M]], an orbital base of operations in a hollowed out asteroid. He then gathers a group of angry and disillusioned mutants including his own, albeit at the time unbeknown to him, son and daughter [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]] and formed the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] to further his goals. Magneto briefly conquers the South American nation of San Marco in the hopes of establishing a mutant homeland there, but is again foiled by the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' #4</ref> He tries to make the [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] infiltrate the X-Men. When that failed, he captures the [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] and tries to force him to tell the secrets of the X-Men. However, the other X-Men rescue their member and destroy Asteroid M.<ref>''X-Men'' #5</ref>\n\nMagneto is captured by the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], a powerful alien being, whom he initially thought was another powerful mutant. The Stranger encases Magneto and Toad in a special cocoon and spirits them away to another planet, the Stranger's laboratory world. Back on Earth, Magneto's Brotherhood splinters, and Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch desert him.<ref>''X-Men'' #11</ref> Magneto escapes to Earth by repairing a spaceship on the Stranger's planet, but leaves the Toad behind. He captures nearly all the X-Men and takes over the Mansion, hoping to use the Angel's parents to create a race of mutants, but is recaptured by the Stranger.<ref>''X-Men'' #17-18</ref> Magneto remains on the Stranger's world for a time, but escapes again, makes his way back to Earth, and reassembles the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants with the exception of the mutant [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]].<ref>''Avengers'' #47-49</ref> He then captures the X-Men, but with the help of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and a rebellious member of the Brotherhood, Toad, Magneto is defeated again.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nMagneto then creates the [[Savage Land Mutates]]. With the Savage Land Mutates, he clashes with the X-Men and [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]].<ref>''X-Men'' #62-63</ref> Along with [[Namor]], Magneto later attacks New York City.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #102-104</ref> He later fights the [[Inhumans]] Royal Family,<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #9-10</ref> and battles the Avengers once more.<ref>''Avengers'' #110-111</ref>\n\nMagneto later reorganizes the Brotherhood, and fights Professor X and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. Using ancient and advanced alien technology he found near the core of the earth, Magneto creates the artificial humanoid \"[[Alpha the Ultimate Mutant]]\". Alpha rebels against his creator and reduces him to infancy.<ref>''Defenders'' #15-16</ref> Magneto is then placed in the care of Xavier's former love interest, Professor [[Moira MacTaggert]] at [[Muir Island]]. At Muir Island, MacTaggert discovers that the prolonged and extensive use of Magneto's powers has a disruptive effect on his nervous system and psyche, causing him to become increasingly paranoid and irrational the more he uses them.  In an attempt to cure him of this flaw she manipulates the infant Magneto's genetic code, so that when he grows older he will be able to safely use his powers while still remaining rational, in order to prevent him from becoming \"evil\" in adulthood.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #2</ref> However, her genetic tampering soon loses its effect when Magneto reactivates his powers, as the very use of his powers causes his genetic sequence to realign and \"reset\" to its original state. Magneto is eventually restored to adulthood, but to his physical prime rather than his older, chronological age, by the alien [[Shi'ar]] agent [[Erik the Red (comics)|Erik the Red]].<ref>''X-Men'' #104</ref>\n\nMagneto later gathers a new [[Resistants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], and with them battles [[Captain America]].<ref>''Captain America Annual'' #4</ref> He then successfully opposes [[Doctor Doom]]'s conquest of Earth.<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up'' #14; ''Champions'' #16</ref>\n\n===Reformation===\n[[File:uncanny200.png|thumb|Magneto goes on trial for his crimes in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #200. Art by [[John Romita Jr]].|left]]\n\nMagneto's first steps towards a change in character begin during an encounter with the X-Men, when he lashes out in anger and nearly kills [[Kitty Pryde]], stopping short when he sees that the X-Man that he attacked is a Jewish child \u2014 precisely the kind of person he claimed he was fighting to make a better world for.  Realizing that he has come to regard the lives of those who oppose him to be as worthless as the Nazis considered his people to be, Magneto stands down and leaves the scene; though most of the X-Men are dismayed that he escaped, Xavier expresses hope that the encounter might prove a turning point for his former friend.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #150 (Aug. 1981)</ref>\n\nMagneto later discovers that former Brotherhood members the [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] are actually his children, simultaneously learning about their recent marriages to the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] and [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]]. He reveals to Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch that he is their father.<ref name=\"VSW4\">''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' Vol. 1, #4 (February 1983).</ref> He also discovers his granddaughter, Quicksilver's human child [[Luna Maximoff]].<ref name=\"VSW4\" /> Seeing Luna as a bond to the human race he has rejected, Magneto tries to reach out to his children. Angered by his rejection of them and their mother, they push him away and refuse to forgive him.<ref name=\"VSW4\" />\n\nMagneto finds himself allied with Professor Xavier and the X-Men when a group of heroes and villains are abducted by the [[Beyonder]], a nearly omnipotent alien being. This entity took them to a planet he created called the [[Battleworld]] to participate in a personal experiment of his to observe the concept of the battle between good and evil which would later be known as the [[Secret Wars]]. The characters were sorted according to their desires; Magneto was placed with the heroes as his desires were based on a wish to help mutants rather than the more selfish drives of the other villains. This surprises many of the other heroes, who still believe him to be a villain, although eventually they come to accept him as an ally. [[Captain America]] even speaks in his defense on some occasions, and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] develops a certain affection for him, although it is tempered by her knowledge of his past.<ref>''[[Secret Wars]]'' vol. 1 #3 (July 1984)</ref>\n\nAfter the Secret Wars, Magneto is transported back to his base, Asteroid M. The alien [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]], traveling to Earth, collides into the asteroid, breaking it to pieces.<ref>''New Mutants'' #21 (November 1984)</ref> Magneto falls towards Earth and into the Atlantic Ocean, sustaining serious injuries. He is rescued by [[Lee Forrester]], the captain of a fishing trawler.<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #188 (December 1984)</ref> Lee takes him to the same island in the Bermuda Triangle where he'd once held her captive; there she helps him recuperate from his injuries, and the two become lovers.<ref>''New Mutants'' #23, 24, 26, 28, 29 (January, February, April, June, July 1985)</ref>\n\nAfter recuperating from his injuries, Magneto is asked to aid the X-Men in battling the returned Beyonder.<ref>''New Mutants'' #29 (July 1985)</ref> Magneto stays with the X-Men even after the Beyonder is defeated.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} His association with the team softens his views on humanity, and Magneto surrenders himself to the law to stand trial for his crimes. A special tribunal dismisses all charges against Magneto from prior to his \"rebirth\", deeming that this had constituted a figurative death of the old Magneto. However, the tribunal is interrupted by an attack from [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]], the twin children of [[Baron Strucker|Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]]. [[Professor X]], brought to near-death due to the strain of the battle and previously sustained injuries, asks Magneto to take over his school and the X-Men. Magneto agrees and chooses not to return to the courtroom. Instead, he takes over Xavier's school under the assumed identity of Michael Xavier, Charles Xavier's cousin.<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #200 (December 1985).</ref> Seeing him try to reform, the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver begin accepting him as their father.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\nThough Magneto makes a substantial effort as the headmaster of the [[New Mutants]] and an ally to the X-Men, his tenure is disastrous. His responsibilities to the school force him to separate from Lee, who he felt would have been a strong guiding hand and emotional support.<ref>''[[New Mutants]]'' #35 (January 1986).</ref> The [[Beyonder]] plagues him yet again, slaying Xavier's current students, the New Mutants,<ref>''[[New Mutants]]'' #37 (March 1986).</ref> and bringing them back to life soon after.<ref>''[[Secret Wars II]]'' #9 (March 1986).</ref> This deeply traumatizes the entire group.<ref>''[[New Mutants]]'' #38 (April 1986)</ref> Magneto is then manipulated by [[Emma Frost]] into battling sanctioned heroes the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Supreme Soviets]].<ref>''The X-Men vs. The Avengers'' #1\u20134 (April\u2013July 1987)</ref> Magneto submits to a trial once again, but uses mind-control circuitry he salvaged from the wreckage of Asteroid M to alter the opinions of the head justice in charge of the trial.

To win the support of the other Club members against Shaw, he claims that his reformation was all a pretense in order to use the X-Men and New Mutants as pawns in a long-term scheme to take over the world. In response, the New Mutants, who had already decided to leave Magneto's tutelage, declare themselves his enemies.<ref name=\"NM75\"/>\n\nSeeing conditions for mutants grow progressively more perilous, Magneto begins seeking allies to protect mutants from humanity. He participates in the ''[[Acts of Vengeance]]'' alongside such established villains as [[Doctor Doom]], the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], and the [[Red Skull]].{{Issue|date=June 2009}} His temporary alliance with the Red Skull \u2014 an unrepentant Nazi war criminal \u2014 is a highly uneasy one. After confirming that the Skull was the original one who had worked with Hitler, Magneto takes revenge upon him by entombing him alive.<ref>''[[Captain America]]'' #367 (February 1990).</ref> When [[Zaladane]] is able to appropriate the magnetic powers of Polaris,<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #250</ref> Magneto works alongside [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]], and the American intelligence agent [[Nick Fury]] as well as a number of Russian operatives in order to reestablish peace in the [[Savage Land]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #274 (March 1991)</ref> This leads to an altercation with Zaladane, who appropriated the magnetic powers of Magneto in addition to those of Polaris. The conflict ends with Magneto reclaiming his powers and executing Zaladane himself. With her death, Magneto renounces his previous efforts to act as a mentor to the New Mutants and to follow Xavier's beliefs in peaceful co-existence between mutants and normal humans.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #275 (April 1991).</ref>\n\n===Avalon and Genosha===\nTired of the constant strife, Magneto rebuilds his orbital base and retires to a life of quiet seclusion. At this point, he is a figurehead for the cause of mutantkind and is sought out by a group of mutants calling themselves the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]], who pledge their service and allegiance to him.<ref name=\"X-Men vol. 2 #1\">''X-Men'' vol. 2, #1 (Oct. 1991)</ref> Under the influence of one of them, [[Fabian Cortez]], he declares [[Asteroid M]] a homeland for mutantkind, obtaining [[nuclear missile]]s from a Soviet submarine he had previously destroyed and placing them around the Asteroid pointed towards Earth.<ref name=\"X-Men vol. 2 #1\"/>\n\nMagneto discovers how Moira MacTaggert altered his genetic structure when he was de-aged. Enraged, he kidnaps Moira and subjects her to torture, later forcing her to use the same procedure that was used on him to alter the minds of some of the X-Men. However, when the remaining X-Men attack Asteroid M to rescue Moira and stop Magneto's plans, the Soviets launch a particle beam satellite which destroys Asteroid M and the procedure wears off; Moira had learned long ago that her procedure didn't work as a mutant's natural physiology relied on their bodies operating in a precise manner, with use of their powers restoring them to normal, and so Magneto had genuinely reformed. Betrayed and abandoned by Cortez, who had revealed Moira's actions to him to try and provoke Magneto into bringing mutants together to serve as a martyr for Cortez's own cause. Magneto refuses Xavier's pleas to escape with the X-Men back to Earth.<ref>''X-Men'' #1-3 (Oct.-Dec. 1991)</ref> Instead, the Acolyte Chrome encases him in a protective shell, saving him from the subsequent explosion.

In response, Magneto generates an [[electromagnetic pulse]] not only destroying the satellites, but deactivating every electric device on Earth within minutes.

In Genosha, Magneto hears Wanda's psychic cry for help and creates a [[wormhole]], whisking her away before the Avengers are able to stop her. Magneto tends to Wanda, increasingly becoming more withdrawn and angry. He allows only Xavier to visit, in the belief that Xavier can help Wanda. After months of failed attempts, the X-Men and the Avengers meet to decide what should be done. When some of the members suggest killing Wanda, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] informs Magneto of this development, before convincing Wanda to warp reality into the [[House of M]]. In the new reality, where the New Avengers, the X-Men, and the members of Wanda's family all received their 'heart's desires', Magneto was attacked by Sentinels over Manhattan in 1979, and revealed an alleged international anti-mutant conspiracy involving [[Richard Nixon]]. This resulted in Magneto being granted sovereignty over Genosha as leader of the world's much larger and much faster growing mutant population. Magneto then turned Genosha into the most powerful, technologically advanced country on Earth, which he used as a base to dominate the world and place mutantkind above humanity.{{issue|date=February 2011}}\n\nA group of heroes is brought together by Wolverine \u2014 who alone remembers the way the world is supposed to be because his 'heart's desire' was to regain all the memories stolen from him by the Weapon X Program \u2014 and have their own memories of the \"real world\" restored by [[Layla Miller]]. They band together and attack Magneto in Genosha, believing him to be the one responsible. During the battle Layla is able to restore Magneto's memories, and he confronts his son. Enraged that Quicksilver had done all of this in his name, Magneto kills him. Sensing her brother's death, Wanda resurrects him and retaliates with the phrase \"No more mutants\", changing the world back to its original form and [[Decimation (comics)|causing ninety-eight percent of the mutant population to lose their powers]], including Magneto. Magneto is left a broken man.<ref>''House of M'' #8</ref>\n\n====''Son of M''====\nIn the 2006 miniseries ''[[Son of M]]'', which follows up \"House of M\", when Quicksilver comes to Genosha to restore the mutants' powers with the [[Inhumans]]' [[Terrigen Mist]]s, Magneto condemns his actions, pointing out the disastrous effects the Mists have on non-Inhumans.

A powerless Magneto is attacked by Xorn, who has somehow evolved into a being of pure energy and merged with both an energy absorbing mutant named [[Michael Pointer (comics)|Michael Pointer]] and free floating mutant power energy that manifested after Scarlet Witch depowered the bulk of the mutant population. Xorn reveals that he, of his own free will, impersonated Magneto in order to rally mutantkind against humanity but failed due to the quality of his impersonation. He possesses Magneto and briefly reactivates his powers before being defeated by the New Avengers and a cadre of heroes, including Magneto's former son-in-law Vision and Inhuman S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Daisy Johnson]]. [[Iron Man]], [[Ms. Marvel]], and the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] combine their powers and send Xorn into the Sun. Michael Pointer and Magneto are freed as a result, though Magneto is arrested and loaded into a S.H.I.E.L.D. helicopter.

To save the mutant race, he must attempt to destroy the world colliding with his own. To save the mutant race, he must also protect the humans, who are currently celebrating him as a hero and look on with fascination at what he attempts to do when Earth-1610 throws Sentinels against him.<ref>''Magneto'' Vol. 3 #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> As the energies of Earth-616 and Earth-1610 inched closer to impact cascade and send chaos through the streets, Magneto (aided by his daughter Polaris) are taking the fight to this \"other\" Earth, battling the parallel Sentinels sent after them. Polaris is shocked to see the energy levels her father is exhibiting, all the while trying to protect the people caught in the crossfire of Magneto and the Sentinels. Magneto clearly has one goal in mind, as he rips a building to pieces to use against the killer robots, not caring much for the collateral damage, or the human lives at risk, as people in the building fall to the ground below. Polaris chides him for so reckless an action as she goes to the rescue while Magneto reminisces the reason he's currently exhibiting this level of power. Magneto and his current right hand Briar worked with a [[chemist]] under Magneto's employ to pump him up with a new cocktail of various drugs to amplify his powers, but Magneto needed further assistance. Months before the final Incursion happened, Briar established at least initial contact with several scientists which included Doctor Doom, Mister Fantastic, the High Evolutionary, Mister Sinister, [[Doctor Nemesis]], and Dark Beast. However, Magneto instead picked out of the lineup the Sugar Man. From him, Magneto acquires the means to initiate his plan, and thanks him in true Magneto style where he leaves Sugar Man barely alive. In the present time, Magneto continues to use the very magnetic forces of the planet to aid him, yet that's more power than he could ever channel and very quickly began taking a deadly toll on him.<ref>''Magneto'' Vol. 3 #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> As Polaris tries getting him to take a break because his plan is killing him too quickly, Magneto began thinking that he doesn't believe in resting even for a minute in his eternal war to protect everything he cares about. He recalls picking up the Sugar Man's power amplifiers and his powers go into hyper-drive and he starts having brain aneurysms. Flip to present day, Magneto sees the S.H.I.E.L.D. coming to his aid and grins. Magneto tells Polaris that their help won't be needed for much longer and she says she doesn't understand but quickly figures it out what her father meant as Magneto absorbs her power and says that it is his responsibility alone and that he couldn't let her die alongside him and that she still has something to offer the world. Magneto's powers then go nova as all the powers of the Earth's North and South Magnetic poles and all the bio-electric energies of the Earth are channeled through him and he reflects on his life role.<ref>''Magneto'' Vol. 3 #20.

Captain America pitched an idea to Magneto that involved a piece of land in the western United States be granted to the mutants that would be their independent nation with the condition being that no inhabitant there would set foot on US soil. When Hydra takes over the United States, Magneto gives in to Captain America's deal. As a result, New Tian is formed somewhere in California and Magneto fakes his death so that he can hide out in Madripoor.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #17.

He is first seen at the Jerusalem Habitat, welcoming several ambassadors from several countries as the newly appointed Krakoan ambassador. He guides the group through several Habitats, then reveals that he is aware of their true nature of being potential plants within Krakoa. Although he claims that he is not threatening them, he tells them that they \"have new gods now.\"<ref>''House of X'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> \n\n==Powers and abilities==\nMagneto is a mutant with the power to manipulate [[magnetic field]]s to achieve a wide range of effects.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://marvel.com/characters/35/magneto | title=Magneto | publisher=Marvel | accessdate=May 31, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe primary application of his power is control over magnetism and the manipulation of both [[ferrous]] and [[nonferrous metal]].{{Citation Needed|date=March 2019}} While the maximum amount of mass he can manipulate at one time is unknown, he has moved large asteroids several times and effortlessly levitated a 30,000 ton [[nuclear submarine]].{{issue|date=September 2015}} His powers extend into the atomic level (insofar as the electromagnetic force is responsible for chemical bonding), allowing him to manipulate chemical structures and rearrange matter, although this is often a strenuous task. He can manipulate a large number of individual objects simultaneously and has assembled complex machinery with his powers. He can also affect non-metallic and non-magnetic objects to a lesser extent and frequently wears metal bracelets on his ankles and wrists allowing him to levitate. He can also generate [[electromagnetic pulse]]s of great strength and generate and manipulate electromagnetic energy down to photons. He can turn invisible by warping visible light around his body.<ref>''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' #4 (February 1983)</ref> Another way in which Magneto frequently uses his power is the projection of force-fields which selectively block out matter and energy. These fields are strong enough to withstand the simultaneous detonation of multiple thermonuclear weapons, hence Magneto is invulnerable to most harm when surrounded by his shield and can survive in deep space thanks to it. He can also channel his powers through his own body to increase his strength and durability far beyond human limits and has a baseline reaction time 15 times faster than those of regular humans. On occasion he has altered the behavior of gravitational fields around him, which has been suggested as evidence of the existence of a [[Unified field theory|unified field]] which he can manipulate. He has demonstrated the capacity to produce a [[wormhole]] and to safely teleport himself and others via the wormhole.<ref>''Excalibur'' v.3, #8 (February 2005)</ref>\n\nMagneto has been frequently depicted as able to resist all but the strongest or most unexpected of telepathic attacks.  A number of explanations have been proposed for his unusually strong resistance to telepathy, among them: (a) technology wired into his helmet (the explanation given in several comic plotlines{{issue|date=May 2016}}), (b) some physical aspect of his electromagnetic powers that can interfere with telepathy (he once used the Earth's magnetic field to dampen the powers of all telepaths within his reach), (c) latent telepathic powers of his own or (d) sheer force of will (cf. ''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #2).  The theme of latent telepathic powers has been explored in a number of stories, among them the [[Secret Wars]] limited series.  In some of his earliest appearances, Magneto was depicted as capable of engaging in [[astral projection]].

Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appears in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' #1 ([[cover-date]]d Sept. 1963) as an adversary of the X-Men.\n\nThe character is a powerful [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], one of a fictional subspecies of humanity born with superhuman abilities, who has the ability to generate and control [[magnetic field]]s. Magneto regards mutants as evolutionarily superior to humans and rejects the possibility of peaceful human-mutant coexistence; he initially aimed to conquer the world to enable mutants, whom he refers to as ''homo superior'', to replace humans as the dominant species. Writers have since fleshed out his origins and motivations, revealing him to be a [[Holocaust survivors|Holocaust survivor]] whose extreme methods and cynical philosophy derive from his determination to protect mutants from suffering a similar fate at the hands of a world that fears and persecutes mutants. He is a friend of [[Professor X]], the leader of the X-Men, but their different philosophies cause a rift in their friendship at times. Magneto's role in comics has varied from [[supervillain]] to [[antihero]] to [[superhero]], having served as an occasional ally and even a member of the X-Men at times.\n\nHis character's early history has been compared with the [[civil rights]] leader [[Malcolm X]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Godoski |first=Andrew |url=http://www.screened.com/news/professor-x-and-magneto-allegories-for-martin-luther-king-jr-and-malcolm-x/2316/ |title=Professor X And Magneto: Allegories For Martin Luther King, Jr. And Malcolm X |publisher=Screened |date=2011-06-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110618141805/http://www.screened.com/news/professor-x-and-magneto-allegories-for-martin-luther-king-jr-and-malcolm-x/2316/ |archivedate=2011-06-18 |accessdate=2016-05-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Shutt | first= Craig | date = August 1997 | title = Bad is Good | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 72 | page = 38}}</ref> and [[Jewish Defense League]] founder [[Meir Kahane]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forward.com/articles/7470/ |title='&#39;(Orthodo)X-Men, On Screen and Off'&#39;, Irving Greenberg, Jewish Daily Forward, 13 June 2003 |publisher=Forward.com |date=2003-06-13 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/8878/orthodo-x-men-/|title=(Orthodo)X-Men|author=Ami Eden|date=2003-05-23|publisher=Jewish Daily Forward}}</ref> Magneto opposes the pacifist attitude of [[Professor X]] and pushes for a more aggressive approach to achieving civil rights.

His first solo title was a [[one shot (comic)|one-shot]] special, ''Magneto: The Twisting of a Soul'' #0 (September 1993), published when the character returned from a brief absence; it reprinted Magneto-based stories from ''Classic X-Men'' #12 & 19 (August 1987 & March 1988), by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[John Bolton (comics)|John Bolton]].\n\nIn a 2008 interview, Stan Lee said he \"did not think of Magneto as a bad guy.

In the miniseries, Magneto had been de-aged and suffered from amnesia, calling himself [[Joseph (comics)|Joseph]]; it was later revealed that Joseph was a younger clone of Magneto. Later, Magneto became ruler of the nation [[Genosha]]. Later, Magneto appeared in two miniseries; ''Magneto Rex'' (written by Joe Pruett and drawn by Brandon Peterson) and ''Magneto: Dark Seduction'' (written by Fabian Nicieza and drawn by Roger Cruz).\n\nA trade paperback novel detailing Magneto's childhood, ''X-Men: Magneto Testament'' was written by [[Greg Pak]] and released in September 2008. Pak based ''Magneto Testament'' on accounts from [[Holocaust survivors]].

Max's father, Jakob Eisenhardt, was a decorated [[World War I]] veteran.<ref name=\"testament1\"/> Surviving discrimination and hardship during the [[Nazism|Nazi rise to power]], the passing of the [[Nuremberg Laws]] in 1935, and [[Kristallnacht]], Max and his family fled to [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] where they were captured during the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion of Poland]] and sent to the [[Warsaw Ghetto]].<ref name=\"testament1\"/><ref name=\"classicxmen12\">''Classic X-Men'' #12</ref> Max and his family escaped the ghetto, only to be betrayed and captured again. His mother, father, and sister were executed and buried in a mass grave, but Max survived, possibly due to the manifestation of his mutant powers. Escaping from the mass grave, he was ultimately captured yet again<ref name=\"mutants1\">New Mutants #49</ref> and sent to [[Auschwitz]], where he eventually became a ''[[Sonderkommando]]''.<ref name=\"mutants1\"/><ref>Uncanny X-Men #274</ref><ref>Excalibur vol.3 #14</ref> While at Auschwitz, Eisenhardt reunited with a [[Romani people|Romani]] girl named Magda, whom he had fallen in love with when he was younger, and with whom he would escape the concentration camp during the [[Auschwitz concentration camp#Birkenau revolt|October 7, 1944 revolt]].\n\nFollowing the war, he and Magda moved to the Ukrainian city of [[Vinnytsia]], and Max adopted the name \"'''Magnus'''\". Magda and Magnus had a daughter named Anya, and lived uneventfully until an angry mob, spurred on by the first manifestation of Magnus' powers, burned down their home with Anya still inside. Magnus was enraged at the mob for preventing him from rescuing Anya, and his powers were unleashed, killing the mob and destroying a part of the city. Magda, terrified at Magnus' power, left him and later gave birth to the mutant twins [[Quicksilver (comics)|Pietro]] and [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda]] before she died. Wanted by the authorities for the deaths and destruction in Vinnytsia, and while searching for Magda, Magnus paid a Romanian forger, Georg Odekirk, to create the cover identity of \"'''Erik Lehnsherr''', the [[Sinte]] gypsy\".<ref name=\"xmen72\" /> \"Erik\" relocated to [[Israel]], where he met and befriended [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] while working at a psychiatric hospital near [[Haifa]] where [[Gabrielle Haller]] resided. There, the two debated the consequences humanity faced with the rise of mutants, though neither revealed to the other that they were mutants. However, they were forced to reveal their inherent abilities to one another while facing [[Baron Strucker]] and [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]]. Following the battle, Erik, realizing that his and Xavier's views were incompatible, left with a cache of hidden [[Nazi gold]], which provided him with the finances to pursue his goals.<ref name=\"uncanny1\"/>\n\n===Rise of Magneto===\n[[File:Xavmags.png|thumb|Magneto and Xavier would eventually part ways because of the differences in their beliefs on how to help mutants. Art by [[Carlos Pacheco]].]]\nMagneto's experiences surviving [[Nazi Germany]], [[Auschwitz]], and [[Vinnytsia]] would shape his outlook on the situation that mutants face in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Determined to keep such atrocities from ever being committed against mutantkind, he is willing to use deadly force to protect mutants. He would believe that mutants (\"''Homo superior''\") will become the dominant life form on the planet and would set about either creating a homeland on Earth where mutants could live peacefully, or conquering and enslaving humanity in the name of mutantkind.\n\nMagneto's first villainous act is attacking a United States military base called Cape Citadel after bringing down missiles. He is driven off by Charles Xavier's mutant students, the [[X-Men]], in their first mission.<ref>''X-Men'' #1</ref> He creates [[Asteroid M]], an orbital base of operations in a hollowed out asteroid. He then gathers a group of angry and disillusioned mutants including his own, albeit at the time unbeknown to him, son and daughter [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]] and formed the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] to further his goals. Magneto briefly conquers the South American nation of San Marco in the hopes of establishing a mutant homeland there, but is again foiled by the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' #4</ref> He tries to make the [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] infiltrate the X-Men. When that failed, he captures the [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] and tries to force him to tell the secrets of the X-Men. However, the other X-Men rescue their member and destroy Asteroid M.<ref>''X-Men'' #5</ref>\n\nMagneto is captured by the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], a powerful alien being, whom he initially thought was another powerful mutant. The Stranger encases Magneto and Toad in a special cocoon and spirits them away to another planet, the Stranger's laboratory world. Back on Earth, Magneto's Brotherhood splinters, and Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch desert him.<ref>''X-Men'' #11</ref> Magneto escapes to Earth by repairing a spaceship on the Stranger's planet, but leaves the Toad behind. He captures nearly all the X-Men and takes over the Mansion, hoping to use the Angel's parents to create a race of mutants, but is recaptured by the Stranger.<ref>''X-Men'' #17-18</ref> Magneto remains on the Stranger's world for a time, but escapes again, makes his way back to Earth, and reassembles the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants with the exception of the mutant [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]].<ref>''Avengers'' #47-49</ref> He then captures the X-Men, but with the help of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and a rebellious member of the Brotherhood, Toad, Magneto is defeated again.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nMagneto then creates the [[Savage Land Mutates]]. With the Savage Land Mutates, he clashes with the X-Men and [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]].<ref>''X-Men'' #62-63</ref> Along with [[Namor]], Magneto later attacks New York City.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #102-104</ref> He later fights the [[Inhumans]] Royal Family,<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #9-10</ref> and battles the Avengers once more.<ref>''Avengers'' #110-111</ref>\n\nMagneto later reorganizes the Brotherhood, and fights Professor X and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. Using ancient and advanced alien technology he found near the core of the earth, Magneto creates the artificial humanoid \"[[Alpha the Ultimate Mutant]]\". Alpha rebels against his creator and reduces him to infancy.<ref>''Defenders'' #15-16</ref> Magneto is then placed in the care of Xavier's former love interest, Professor [[Moira MacTaggert]] at [[Muir Island]]. At Muir Island, MacTaggert discovers that the prolonged and extensive use of Magneto's powers has a disruptive effect on his nervous system and psyche, causing him to become increasingly paranoid and irrational the more he uses them.  In an attempt to cure him of this flaw she manipulates the infant Magneto's genetic code, so that when he grows older he will be able to safely use his powers while still remaining rational, in order to prevent him from becoming \"evil\" in adulthood.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #2</ref> However, her genetic tampering soon loses its effect when Magneto reactivates his powers, as the very use of his powers causes his genetic sequence to realign and \"reset\" to its original state. Magneto is eventually restored to adulthood, but to his physical prime rather than his older, chronological age, by the alien [[Shi'ar]] agent [[Erik the Red (comics)|Erik the Red]].<ref>''X-Men'' #104</ref>\n\nMagneto later gathers a new [[Resistants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], and with them battles [[Captain America]].<ref>''Captain America Annual'' #4</ref> He then successfully opposes [[Doctor Doom]]'s conquest of Earth.<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up'' #14; ''Champions'' #16</ref>\n\n===Reformation===\n[[File:uncanny200.png|thumb|Magneto goes on trial for his crimes in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #200. Art by [[John Romita Jr]].|left]]\n\nMagneto's first steps towards a change in character begin during an encounter with the X-Men, when he lashes out in anger and nearly kills [[Kitty Pryde]], stopping short when he sees that the X-Man that he attacked is a Jewish child \u2014 precisely the kind of person he claimed he was fighting to make a better world for.  Realizing that he has come to regard the lives of those who oppose him to be as worthless as the Nazis considered his people to be, Magneto stands down and leaves the scene; though most of the X-Men are dismayed that he escaped, Xavier expresses hope that the encounter might prove a turning point for his former friend.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #150 (Aug. 1981)</ref>\n\nMagneto later discovers that former Brotherhood members the [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] are actually his children, simultaneously learning about their recent marriages to the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] and [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]]. He reveals to Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch that he is their father.<ref name=\"VSW4\">''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' Vol. 1, #4 (February 1983).</ref> He also discovers his granddaughter, Quicksilver's human child [[Luna Maximoff]].<ref name=\"VSW4\" /> Seeing Luna as a bond to the human race he has rejected, Magneto tries to reach out to his children. Angered by his rejection of them and their mother, they push him away and refuse to forgive him.<ref name=\"VSW4\" />\n\nMagneto finds himself allied with Professor Xavier and the X-Men when a group of heroes and villains are abducted by the [[Beyonder]], a nearly omnipotent alien being. This entity took them to a planet he created called the [[Battleworld]] to participate in a personal experiment of his to observe the concept of the battle between good and evil which would later be known as the [[Secret Wars]]. The characters were sorted according to their desires; Magneto was placed with the heroes as his desires were based on a wish to help mutants rather than the more selfish drives of the other villains. This surprises many of the other heroes, who still believe him to be a villain, although eventually they come to accept him as an ally.

In Genosha, Magneto hears Wanda's psychic cry for help and creates a [[wormhole]], whisking her away before the Avengers are able to stop her. Magneto tends to Wanda, increasingly becoming more withdrawn and angry. He allows only Xavier to visit, in the belief that Xavier can help Wanda. After months of failed attempts, the X-Men and the Avengers meet to decide what should be done.

In the new reality, where the New Avengers, the X-Men, and the members of Wanda's family all received their 'heart's desires', Magneto was attacked by Sentinels over Manhattan in 1979, and revealed an alleged international anti-mutant conspiracy involving [[Richard Nixon]]. This resulted in Magneto being granted sovereignty over Genosha as leader of the world's much larger and much faster growing mutant population.

They band together and attack Magneto in Genosha, believing him to be the one responsible. During the battle Layla is able to restore Magneto's memories, and he confronts his son. Enraged that Quicksilver had done all of this in his name, Magneto kills him. Sensing her brother's death, Wanda resurrects him and retaliates with the phrase \"No more mutants\", changing the world back to its original form and [[Decimation (comics)|causing ninety-eight percent of the mutant population to lose their powers]], including Magneto.

A powerless Magneto is attacked by Xorn, who has somehow evolved into a being of pure energy and merged with both an energy absorbing mutant named [[Michael Pointer (comics)|Michael Pointer]] and free floating mutant power energy that manifested after Scarlet Witch depowered the bulk of the mutant population. Xorn reveals that he, of his own free will, impersonated Magneto in order to rally mutantkind against humanity but failed due to the quality of his impersonation. He possesses Magneto and briefly reactivates his powers before being defeated by the New Avengers and a cadre of heroes, including Magneto's former son-in-law Vision and Inhuman S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Daisy Johnson]]. [[Iron Man]], [[Ms. Marvel]], and the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] combine their powers and send Xorn into the Sun. Michael Pointer and Magneto are freed as a result, though Magneto is arrested and loaded into a S.H.I.E.L.D. helicopter.

Magneto and his current right hand Briar worked with a [[chemist]] under Magneto's employ to pump him up with a new cocktail of various drugs to amplify his powers, but Magneto needed further assistance. Months before the final Incursion happened, Briar established at least initial contact with several scientists which included Doctor Doom, Mister Fantastic, the High Evolutionary, Mister Sinister, [[Doctor Nemesis]], and Dark Beast. However, Magneto instead picked out of the lineup the Sugar Man. From him, Magneto acquires the means to initiate his plan, and thanks him in true Magneto style where he leaves Sugar Man barely alive. In the present time, Magneto continues to use the very magnetic forces of the planet to aid him, yet that's more power than he could ever channel and very quickly began taking a deadly toll on him.<ref>''Magneto'' Vol. 3 #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> As Polaris tries getting him to take a break because his plan is killing him too quickly, Magneto began thinking that he doesn't believe in resting even for a minute in his eternal war to protect everything he cares about. He recalls picking up the Sugar Man's power amplifiers and his powers go into hyper-drive and he starts having brain aneurysms. Flip to present day, Magneto sees the S.H.I.E.L.D. coming to his aid and grins. Magneto tells Polaris that their help won't be needed for much longer and she says she doesn't understand but quickly figures it out what her father meant as Magneto absorbs her power and says that it is his responsibility alone and that he couldn't let her die alongside him and that she still has something to offer the world. Magneto's powers then go nova as all the powers of the Earth's North and South Magnetic poles and all the bio-electric energies of the Earth are channeled through him and he reflects on his life role.<ref>''Magneto'' Vol. 3 #20. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===All-New, All-Different Marvel===\nAs part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' branding, Magneto has been returned to life with no memories of his apparent demise. In the wake of the massive anti-mutant uprising, combined with the discovery that the Terrigen Mists that were spread in the atmosphere are harmful to mutants, Magneto has gathered together a team of mutants (consisting of Archangel, M, Psylocke, and Sabretooth) as his own X-Men in order to defend mutants at any cost.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 4 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===\"Civil War II\"===\nDuring the 2016 \"[[Civil War II]]\" storyline an Inhuman named Ulysses emerges who can \"foresee the future\". This divides the superhero community, including the X-Men, with one faction led by [[Carol Danvers]] believing that the perpetrators of future crimes indicated by Ulysses' visions should be arrested to prevent said crimes, while an opposing faction led by [[Iron Man]] believes this would violate individual civil liberties. Magneto and some of the X-Men side with Iron Man, while Storm and the other X-Men side with Danvers.<ref>''Civil War II: X-Men'' #1-3. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Civil War II'' #4-5. Marvel Comics.</ref> After reaching Ulysses, Magneto asks him why he should not kill or capture him, and Ulysses shows him visions that lead to Magneto leaving Ulysses and New Attilan.{{issue|date=January 2017}} It is later shown to be a ploy by [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] to avoid conflict.{{issue|date=January 2017}}\n\n===\"Inhumans vs. X-Men\"===\nFollowing the 2016 \"[[Inhumans vs. X-Men]]\" storyline, Magneto is killed by Psylocke per their agreement that she do this if he was to ever regress back his previous megalomaniacal approach to protecting mutantkind. Upon being left for dead in the Savage Land, his body was found by Exodus and healed by Elixir.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 4 #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> Following the conclusion of the war between Inhumans and X-Men, with Medusa unleashing the device to destroy the Terrigen Cloud permanently, he was temporarily beaten by a maddened Emma, who lied to the rest of the mutants about Cyclops' true death to trigger the war. He is later saved by Medusa and about to best Emma for her traitorous act, but Havok prevents him and Medusa from executing Emma for the sake of his late older brother.<ref>''IVX'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===\"Secret Empire\"===\nIn the 2017 \"[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]\" storyline, it is revealed that Magneto wants to help the time-displaced original X-Men back to their home timeline.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Magneto was approached by Captain America whose memories were altered by Red Skull's clone using the powers of [[Kobik]] to cause Captain America to think that he was a Hydra sleeper agent. Captain America pitched an idea to Magneto that involved a piece of land in the western United States be granted to the mutants that would be their independent nation with the condition being that no inhabitant there would set foot on US soil. When Hydra takes over the United States, Magneto gives in to Captain America's deal. As a result, New Tian is formed somewhere in California and Magneto fakes his death so that he can hide out in Madripoor.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> At the time when Emma Frost meets with Hydra Supreme Steve Rogers the same time the resistances are fighting back Hydra, Magneto flies outside the Hydra Helicarrier and uses giant shards of metal to attack it.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===\"Hunt for Wolverine\"===\nDuring the \"[[Hunt for Wolverine]]\" storyline, Kitty Pryde leads Domino, Jubilee, Psylocke, Rogue, and Storm to Madripoor when they suspect that Magneto has excavated Wolverine's body. When they meet with Magneto at the King's Impresario Restaurant in Hightown, they discover that Magneto is actually Mindblast in disguise as it was part of an ambush by Viper and the [[Femme Fatales (comics)|Femme Fatales]].<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Magneto is shown to be a prisoner of Viper and the Femme Fatales where Mindblast and [[Sapphire Styx]] put Magneto in a weakened state.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Kitty Pryde destroyed the psychic-enhancement equipment on Mindblast's back, Magneto recovers and starts to take revenge on Mindblast until Kitty suggests he leaves her and helps to stop the rocket that will be sent to Soteira.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Due to Magneto still recovering from what Mindblast put him through, Kitty Pryde was able to evacuate Rogue and Storm from the rocket. Then Kitty and Domino persuaded Magneto not to take revenge on Mindblast. Magneto spares Mindblast's life and leaves her as a gift for helping him to escape. While Magneto denied any knowledge of taking Wolverine's body, he works to destroy the launch site and purge Madripoor of Viper's criminal empire while also pursuing Viper.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===House of X===\nWorking with Charles Xavier and Moira X, Magneto helps establish the new sovereign mutant nation known as Krakoa. He is first seen at the Jerusalem Habitat, welcoming several ambassadors from several countries as the newly appointed Krakoan ambassador. He guides the group through several Habitats, then reveals that he is aware of their true nature of being potential plants within Krakoa. Although he claims that he is not threatening them, he tells them that they \"have new gods now.\"<ref>''House of X'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> \n\n==Powers and abilities==\nMagneto is a mutant with the power to manipulate [[magnetic field]]s to achieve a wide range of effects.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://marvel.com/characters/35/magneto | title=Magneto | publisher=Marvel | accessdate=May 31, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe primary application of his power is control over magnetism and the manipulation of both [[ferrous]] and [[nonferrous metal]].{{Citation Needed|date=March 2019}} While the maximum amount of mass he can manipulate at one time is unknown, he has moved large asteroids several times and effortlessly levitated a 30,000 ton [[nuclear submarine]].{{issue|date=September 2015}} His powers extend into the atomic level (insofar as the electromagnetic force is responsible for chemical bonding), allowing him to manipulate chemical structures and rearrange matter, although this is often a strenuous task. He can manipulate a large number of individual objects simultaneously and has assembled complex machinery with his powers. He can also affect non-metallic and non-magnetic objects to a lesser extent and frequently wears metal bracelets on his ankles and wrists allowing him to levitate. He can also generate [[electromagnetic pulse]]s of great strength and generate and manipulate electromagnetic energy down to photons. He can turn invisible by warping visible light around his body.<ref>''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' #4 (February 1983)</ref> Another way in which Magneto frequently uses his power is the projection of force-fields which selectively block out matter and energy. These fields are strong enough to withstand the simultaneous detonation of multiple thermonuclear weapons, hence Magneto is invulnerable to most harm when surrounded by his shield and can survive in deep space thanks to it. He can also channel his powers through his own body to increase his strength and durability far beyond human limits and has a baseline reaction time 15 times faster than those of regular humans. On occasion he has altered the behavior of gravitational fields around him, which has been suggested as evidence of the existence of a [[Unified field theory|unified field]] which he can manipulate. He has demonstrated the capacity to produce a [[wormhole]] and to safely teleport himself and others via the wormhole.<ref>''Excalibur'' v.3, #8 (February 2005)</ref>\n\nMagneto has been frequently depicted as able to resist all but the strongest or most unexpected of telepathic attacks.  A number of explanations have been proposed for his unusually strong resistance to telepathy, among them: (a) technology wired into his helmet (the explanation given in several comic plotlines{{issue|date=May 2016}}), (b) some physical aspect of his electromagnetic powers that can interfere with telepathy (he once used the Earth's magnetic field to dampen the powers of all telepaths within his reach), (c) latent telepathic powers of his own or (d) sheer force of will (cf. ''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #2).  The theme of latent telepathic powers has been explored in a number of stories, among them the [[Secret Wars]] limited series.  In some of his earliest appearances, Magneto was depicted as capable of engaging in [[astral projection]].  He has used Cerebro to locate mutants at great distances while leading the [[New Mutants]]. {{issue|date=March 2015}}  He has also, on rare occasions, been shown reading others' dreams, issuing telepathic commands, and probing the minds of others.<ref>''The X-Men'', v.1, #5-7 (May\u2013September 1964), ''New Mutants'' Vol. 1 #38 (1986), ''X-Men vs. Avengers'' miniseries (1987), ''Marvel Fanfare'' #33 (1987)</ref>  He has demonstrated the ability to shield his mind, while in intense meditation, so completely that even [[Emma Frost]] was not able to read his thoughts, despite being directly in front of him and actively attempting to do so.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #521\"/>\n\nIn addition to his powers, Magneto has many other skills. He is a [[genius]] with competence in various fields of advanced science, especially in [[genetic engineering|genetic manipulation]], particle physics, [[engineering]], and other fields of technology. He has engineered advanced weaponry, space stations, superpowered humanoid lifeforms, devices that generate volcanoes and earthquakes, that block telepathy, and that can nullify all mutant powers across a few miles except for his own.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men' 1981\">''Uncanny X-Men'' #150 (October 1981)</ref>  He has promptly reconstructed such computerized devices from memory.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men' 1981\"/> He has bio-engineered new species including the [[Savage Land Mutates]],{{issue|date=March 2015}} and, using [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] technology, [[Alpha the Ultimate Mutant]].{{issue|date=March 2015}} He is fluent in many human languages and once single-handedly deciphered the unknown language of a lost civilization.<ref>''Defenders'' #15 (September 1974)</ref> He possesses extraordinary skill in \"reading\" the microexpressions on others' faces and sensing what they are thinking and feeling, whether they are lying, fearful, etc. a skill which he refers to as \"taking your enemy's measure\".<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #6 (January 2011)</ref> He also is a master strategist and tactician with extensive combat experience, and has often been successful in single-handed combat against entire groups of superhuman adversaries. He also has some military training in hand-to-hand combat and has been shown to be effective with his fists, but he prefers to use his powers when in combat situations.\n\n==Reception==\nMagneto was ranked number 1 by [[IGN]]'s Top 100 Comic Book Villains list,<ref>IGN.com, Top 100 Comic Book Villains, [http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/1.html \"Magneto is Number 1\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518101954/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/1.html |date=2009-05-18 }}</ref> was listed number 17 in ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard's]]'' Top 100 Greatest Villains Ever list,<ref>''Wizard'', #177, July 2006</ref> and was ranked as the 9th Greatest Comic Book Character Ever in ''Wizard'''s list of the 200 Greatest Comic Book Characters of All Time, the second highest villain on that list.<ref>Wizarduniverse.com, [http://www.wizarduniverse.com/05240810thgreatestcharacters2.html \"The 200 Greatest Comic Characters of All Time\"], Numbers 20 Through 1, 2008-05-23  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527233124/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/05240810thgreatestcharacters2.html |date=May 27, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Collected editions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 1997, several members of the CofCC attended an event hosted by [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]'s [[National Rally (France)|National Front]] party.\n\nFollowing several articles detailing some of its members' past involvement with the White Citizens' Councils, several conservative politicians distanced themselves from the organization. Although Representative [[Bob Barr]] had spoken at CofCC functions, in 1999 he rejected the group, saying he found the group's racial views to be \"repugnant,\" and that he had not realized the nature of the group when he agreed to speak at the group's meeting.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990317-2,00.html|authorlink = Bob Barr|last = Barr|first = Bob|date = March 1, 1999|accessdate = March 12, 2007|title = Representative Barr Responds (Letter)|work = Time Magazine }}</ref> Barr gave the keynote speech at its 1998 national convention.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/22/the-odd-political-success-of-the-white-supremacist-council-of-conservative-citizens-explained/ |title=The political success of the Council of Conservative Citizens, explained |last1=Phillips |first1=Amber |date=June 22, 2015 |website=washingtonpost.com |publisher=[[Washington Post]] |access-date=July 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn later years, the press reported the involvement of other politicians with the CofCC. For instance, [[U.S. Senate Majority Leader]] [[Trent Lott]] had also been a member of the CofCC. Following the press report, the Chairman of the [[Republican National Committee]], [[Jim Nicholson (U.S. politician)|Jim Nicholson]], denounced the CofCC for holding \"racist and nationalist views\" and demanded that Lott formally denounce the organization. Although Lott refused to denounce the organization, he said that he had resigned his membership. Subsequently, Nicholson demanded Lott denounce his former segregationist views following a speech he gave at Senator [[Strom Thurmond]]'s birthday dinner in 2002, when Lott praised the Senator's 1948 [[Dixiecrat]] presidential campaign.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A37288-2002Dec10 | work=The Washington Post | title=Lott Remarks on Thurmond Echoed 1980 Words | first1=Thomas B. | last1=Edsall | first2=Brian | last2=Faler | date=December 11, 2002 | accessdate=May 26, 2010}}</ref> Following the controversy sparked by Nicholson's demands, Lott apologized for his past support for segregation, his past associations, and his remarks at Thurmond's birthday.

A typical day in Yeshiva will include two sessions of intensive Talmud study (''iyun'') and one of extensive study (''bekiut''). \n\nShachris at the Yeshiva is at 6:30am, followed by halachah seder until 8:00am. Breakfast is from 8:00am-8:30am. After breakfast is morning seder, which is typically gemara iyun, and it goes from 8:30am-1:00pm. Following morning seder is lunch and a break from 1:00pm-3pm. Mincha is at 3:00pm, followed by afternoon seder, from about 3:20pm-7:30pm. Afternoon seder consists of more iyun gemara, followed by a couple hours of emmunah. Many of the students use the entire afternoon seder for learning machshava, tanach, mussar, and emmunah. From 7:30pm-8:00pm is Maariv, followed by supper from 8:00pm-8:30pm. Night seder consists of learning bekiut, and it goes from 8:30pm until at least 11:00pm, although there is no given time for night seder to end, and many students learn until much later.\n\n'''Daily Schedule''': \n\nShachrit: 6:30am-8:00am\n\nBreakfast: 8:00am-8:30am\n\nMorning seder: 8:30am-1:00pm\n\nLunch/break: 1:00pm-3:00pm\n\nMincha: 3:00pm-3:20pm\n\nAfternoon seder: 3:20pm-7:30pm\n\nSupper: 7:30pm-8:00pm\n\nMarriv: 8:00pm-8:30pm \n\nNight seder: 8:30pm-11:00pm (or later)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/26/46/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd|last=|first=|date=|website=www.yhy.co.il|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>\n\nThe yeshiva guides its students to base their perspective upon the teachings of [[Yehuda Halevi|Rabbi Yehuda Halevi]] and the [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|Maharal of Prague]] in accordance with the ideology of [[Abraham Isaac Kook|Rabbi A.Y. Kook]], as is often customary in Religious Zionist yeshivas.\nWith the goal of educating students to deal independently with the challenges they face living as an [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|observant Jews in modern time]] in mind, the yeshiva encourages a broader study of Biblical, rabbinic, and other classical and modern sources. Hence, the yeshiva curriculum contains weekly classes in [[Tanakh]], [[Medieval philosophy|Medieval]] [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Hasidic philosophy]], and the works of contemporary scholars such as Rabbi [[Joseph B.

The yeshiva believes that the keys to solving Israel\u2019s socioeconomic gaps lie in integration and education. All the students volunteer in the community mainly in the field of education. Many of the yeshiva's alumni settle in Yeruham instead of heading to the country's central cities.\n\nThe yeshiva also promotes other programs, among them:\n* ''Ye'adim'' (goals) - Concern of the Ethiopian Jewry in Israel's situation led Yerucham students to create a leadership training program for Ethiopian students with the intention of their returning to their communities. During the 5 years of Hesder the students synchronize their full Yeshiva studies with a [[Bachelor of Education|B.Ed.]] degree in [[Herzog College]].\n* Young Study Partners - First and second year students dedicate 2 hours weekly to studying Torah subjects with children from the local elementary school. They also serve as positive role models for the local youth and look to form a connection with their families.\n* Charity Fund - The goal of the Fund is to help the needy of Yeruham become self-sufficient and better managers of their money. The Fund uses the cooperation of the local welfare and professional financial advisors to this end.\n* ''B'levav Shalem'' Yeshiva High School \u2013 Because of the lack of high quality religious high schools in the [[Negev]], and as a part of the integration program the Hesder Yeshiva believes in, it was decided by alumni, residents of Yerucham, to open a Yeshiva High School for the local and general population.\n\n==Educational staff==\n[[File:\u05d4\u05e8\u05d1 \u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2.JPG|thumb|Rabbi Blumenzweig]]\nIn addition to Rabbi Blumenzweig, rabbis who teach in the Yeshiva include Rabbis [[Uriel Eitam]], Chaim Wolfson, Shai Gnizi, Shmuel Gleizer, Achiya Ben Pazi, Shmuel Ariel and Elyakim Sharir<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/33/51/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd - \u05e6\u05d5\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4|website=www.yhy.co.il|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>.

Over time, the group grew in number and expanded its activities by taking on educational responsibilities as well.

A typical day in Yeshiva will include two sessions of intensive Talmud study (''iyun'') and one of extensive study (''bekiut''). \n\nShachris at the Yeshiva is at 6:30am, followed by halachah seder until 8:00am. Breakfast is from 8:00am-8:30am. After breakfast is morning seder, which is typically gemara iyun, and it goes from 8:30am-1:00pm. Following morning seder is lunch and a break from 1:00pm-3pm. Mincha is at 3:00pm, followed by afternoon seder, from about 3:20pm-7:30pm. Afternoon seder consists of more iyun gemara, followed by a couple hours of emmunah. Many of the students use the entire afternoon seder for learning machshava, tanach, mussar, and emmunah. From 7:30pm-8:00pm is Maariv, followed by supper from 8:00pm-8:30pm. Night seder consists of learning bekiut, and it goes from 8:30pm until at least 11:00pm, although there is no given time for night seder to end, and many students learn until much later.\n\n'''Daily Schedule''': \n\nShachrit: 6:30am-8:00am\n\nBreakfast: 8:00am-8:30am\n\nMorning seder: 8:30am-1:00pm\n\nLunch/break: 1:00pm-3:00pm\n\nMincha: 3:00pm-3:20pm\n\nAfternoon seder: 3:20pm-7:30pm\n\nSupper: 7:30pm-8:00pm\n\nMarriv: 8:00pm-8:30pm \n\nNight seder: 8:30pm-11:00pm (or later)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/26/46/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd|last=|first=|date=|website=www.yhy.co.il|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>\n\nThe yeshiva guides its students to base their perspective upon the teachings of [[Yehuda Halevi|Rabbi Yehuda Halevi]] and the [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|Maharal of Prague]] in accordance with the ideology of [[Abraham Isaac Kook|Rabbi A.Y. Kook]], as is often customary in Religious Zionist yeshivas.\nWith the goal of educating students to deal independently with the challenges they face living as an [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|observant Jews in modern time]] in mind, the yeshiva encourages a broader study of Biblical, rabbinic, and other classical and modern sources. Hence, the yeshiva curriculum contains weekly classes in [[Tanakh]], [[Medieval philosophy|Medieval]] [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Hasidic philosophy]], and the works of contemporary scholars such as Rabbi [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]].\n\n==Educational approach==\nThe yeshiva educates its students to be aware of their surroundings and attentive to the needs of society in general. The yeshiva believes that the keys to solving Israel\u2019s socioeconomic gaps lie in integration and education. All the students volunteer in the community mainly in the field of education. Many of the yeshiva's alumni settle in Yeruham instead of heading to the country's central cities.\n\nThe yeshiva also promotes other programs, among them:\n* ''Ye'adim'' (goals) - Concern of the Ethiopian Jewry in Israel's situation led Yerucham students to create a leadership training program for Ethiopian students with the intention of their returning to their communities. During the 5 years of Hesder the students synchronize their full Yeshiva studies with a [[Bachelor of Education|B.Ed.]] degree in [[Herzog College]].\n* Young Study Partners - First and second year students dedicate 2 hours weekly to studying Torah subjects with children from the local elementary school. They also serve as positive role models for the local youth and look to form a connection with their families.\n* Charity Fund - The goal of the Fund is to help the needy of Yeruham become self-sufficient and better managers of their money. The Fund uses the cooperation of the local welfare and professional financial advisors to this end.\n* ''B'levav Shalem'' Yeshiva High School \u2013 Because of the lack of high quality religious high schools in the [[Negev]], and as a part of the integration program the Hesder Yeshiva believes in, it was decided by alumni, residents of Yerucham, to open a Yeshiva High School for the local and general population.\n\n==Educational staff==\n[[File:\u05d4\u05e8\u05d1 \u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2.JPG|thumb|Rabbi Blumenzweig]]\nIn addition to Rabbi Blumenzweig, rabbis who teach in the Yeshiva include Rabbis [[Uriel Eitam]], Chaim Wolfson, Shai Gnizi, Shmuel Gleizer, Achiya Ben Pazi, Shmuel Ariel and Elyakim Sharir<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/33/51/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd - \u05e6\u05d5\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4|website=www.yhy.co.il|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>.

He was the [[bishop of Hexham]] and then the [[bishop of York]] which was the most important religious designation in the area. He went on to found the town of [[Beverley]] by building the first structure there, a [[monastery]]. John was associated with miracles during and after his lifetime, and was [[canonised]] a saint by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] in 1037.\n\n==Life==\nJohn was said to have been born of noble parents at [[Harpham]], in the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]],<ref name=Walsh316>{{cite book |title= A New Dictionary of Saints: East and West |last=Walsh |first=Michael J. |year=2007 |publisher= Burns & Oats |location=London |isbn=0-86012-438-X |page=316 }}</ref> He is said to have received his education at [[Canterbury]] under [[Adrian of Canterbury|Adrian]],<ref name=Walsh316/> and not [[Oxford]] as per some sources.

By 1266 it was accepted that when levies were made in Yorkshire for the royal army, it was sufficient for Beverley to send one man with the banner of John.<ref name=DNB/> In 1292 a new shrine was commissioned. An extant contract between Roger de Faringdon and the canons of [[Beverley Minster]] states:\n\n<blockquote>For a [[silver-gilt]] shrine, made from gold and silver supplied by the Chapter, 5ft long, 1ft wide. Of proportionate height, beautiful, and adorned with plates and columns in architectural style with figures everywhere of size and number as the Chapter determine, and canopies and pinnacles before and behind, and other proper ornaments. Roger to remake any figure at the whim of The Chapter. The pay to be silver equal to the weight used before gilding. Roger may not undertake any other work before completion.</blockquote>\n\n[[Edward I of England|Edward I]] was a devotee of John and furthered the cult. In 1295 Edward established a [[chantry]] in Beverley Minster in the saint's honour.<ref name=DNB/> In 1301, he gave 50 marks towards the building of the shrine and diverted half of a fine owed by the town to the same purpose and ceded the remaining half.\n\nOn 25 October 1307 John's relics were [[translation (relics)|translated]] to the new tomb.<ref name=Walsh316/>\n[[File:Statue - St John of Beverley on the Minster.jpg|thumb|Statue - St John of Beverley on the Minster]]\nEdward I visited the Minster in 1296, 1297, and 1300 on his way north to fight with the Scottish and took the banner of John to aid him. [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], and [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] also used the banner in military campaigns.<ref name=DNB/>\n\nDuring the Middle Ages his name was also attached to the legend of a hermit who commits grave sins but nonetheless enjoys God's grace. This text survives in the Dutch [[chapbook]] ''Historie van Jan van Beverley'', printed by [[Thomas van der Noot]] in Brussels in c.1512.\n\n[[Henry V of England|Henry V]] gave the credit for his victory at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] to the miraculous intervention of John,<ref>{{cite book|author=Gross, Ernie |title=This Day in Religion|location=New York |publisher=Neil-Schuman| year=1990|isbn= 1-55570-045-4}}</ref> the battle having been fought on the anniversary of John's translation.<ref name=Walsh316/> On the day of the battle, blood and oil were seen running from the tomb. Henry made John one of the patrons of the royal household and ordered that his feast was to be celebrated throughout England. Henry and his queen came to Beverley in 1420 to make offerings at the saint's shrine.\n[[File:Beverley minster.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The West front of [[Beverley Minster]] today. The relics of John of Beverley are housed there, covered by a marble slab.]]\n\nIn 1541, the shrine was destroyed on the orders of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] as part of the [[English Reformation]].<ref name=DNB/> Its contents disappeared from records. In 1664, workmen discovered a vault under the floor of the minster's [[nave]]. Made of stone, it was {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|long}} and {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|wide}} at the head and {{convert|1|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|wide}} at the base. Encased in lead, were found ashes, six beads, three great brass pins and four large iron nails. The lead had the following inscription:\n\n<blockquote>In the year from the incarnation of our Lord, 1188, this church was burnt in the month of September, the night after the feast of St Matthew the Apostle and in the year 1197, the 6th of the ides of March, there was an inquisition made of the relics of the Blessed John in this place, and these bones were found in the east part of this sepulchre, and redeposited; dust mixed with mortar was found likewise and re-interred.</blockquote>\n\nIn 1738, when the present minster floor was laid, the same relics were dug up and replaced in the same position with an arched brick vault over them. This was covered by a marble slab, similar to others in the nave. On the roof of the church, over the tomb, ''Reliquas beati Johanis Beverlacenic his undicat''.\n\nThe inscription on the tomb now reads:\n\nHERE LIES <br>THE BODY OF SAINT JOHN OF BEVERLEY<br>FOUNDER OF THIS CHURCH<br> BISHOP OF HEXHAM AD 687\u2013705<br> BISHOP OF YORK A.D. 705\u2013718<br> HE WAS BORN AT HARPHAM<br> AND DIED AT BEVERLEY<br> AD 721\n\nIn recent times, the feast of St John has been marked in Beverley in two ways. On the Thursday nearest 7 May the choir and members of the congregation of Beverley Minster go the church at Harpham and process to the well. The well is decorated (before the event) with flowers. After singing an [[anthem]] and praying, the procession returns to the church for choral [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|evensong]].\n\nOn the Sunday nearest 7 May the civic dignitaries process in full [[regalia]] with [[Ceremonial mace|mace]] bearers to the minster. The procession enters by the Great West Door. During the following service, children from Harpham present [[Primula vulgaris|primroses]] gathered from the woods around the village.
