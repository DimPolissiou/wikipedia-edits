He served as the governor of [[Basra]] in 665\u2013670 and ultimately the first governor of [[History of Iraq#Middle Ages|Iraq]] and virtual viceroy of the eastern Caliphate between 670 and his death.\n\nZiyad's parentage is obscure, but he was raised among the [[Banu Thaqif]] in [[Ta'if]] and arrived with his adoptive tribesmen in Basra upon its foundation in 636 as the Muslim Arabs' springboard for the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|conquest of the Sasanian Empire]]. He was initially employed by the city's first governor, [[Utbah ibn Ghazwan|Utba ibn Ghazwan al-Mazini]], and was kept on as a scribe or secretary by his successors. Caliph [[Ali]] ({{reign|656|661}}) appointed Ziyad to [[Pars (Sasanian province)|Fars]] to suppress a local rebellion and he maintained his loyalty to Ali's caliphate after the latter's assassination in 661 and the subsequent rule of Ali's enemy, [[Mu'awiya I]] ({{reign|661|680}}). The latter ultimately overcame Ziyad's opposition, formally recognized him as his own paternal half-brother and appointed him governor of Basra. Ziyad's inaugural speech, in which he announced his carrot-and-stick policies to the city's turbulent population, is celebrated in Arab history for its eloquence. After the death of [[Kufa]]'s governor, Ziyad's mentor [[al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba]], Mu'awiya made Ziyad the first governor of a unified Iraqi province. He administratively reorganized the [[amsar|garrison cities]] and minted [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]]-style silver [[dirham]]s in his own name. He firmly established Arab power and recommenced conquests in the Caliphate's easternmost province of [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]] by relocating there 50,000 Arab soldiers and their families from Iraq and dispatching expeditionary forces against [[Tukharistan]], [[Balkh]] and [[Quhistan]]. Though the mass resettlement improved Iraq's economic and political conditions by siphoning off Arab tribal soldiers from the overcrowded garrisons and creating new opportunities for war spoils, the move had major ramifications for the Caliphate as the descendants of these Khurasani Arab troops formed the army that toppled the Umayyads in 750. \n\nZiyad died near Kufa in 673, but his sons [[Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad|Ubayd Allah]], [[Abd al-Rahman ibn Ziyad|Abd al-Rahman]], [[Salm ibn Ziyad|Salm]], [[Abbad ibn Ziyad|Abbad]] and [[Yazid ibn Ziyad|Yazid]] went on to hold posts as governors or deputy governors of Iraq, Khurasan and [[Sistan|Sijistan]]. Ziyad was the subject of early Arabic biographies and is remembered in Arab history as one of the four great wise men of his era and as a highly skilled administrator and orator. His administration in Iraq served as a model for his successors.\n\n==Origins==\nZiyad was likely born in [[Ta'if]] in 622 or 623/24.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=519}} His precise parentage is obscure, hence his frequent name in the sources as ''Ziy\u0101d ibn Ab\u012bhi'' (\"Ziyad son of his father\").{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=85}}{{sfn|Lynch|2018|page=1662}} He was the illegitimate son of a certain Sumayya, his father being unknown. The origins of Sumayya are also obscure. The 9th-century historians [[al-Baladhuri]] and [[Awana ibn al-Hakam]] both relate that she had been a slave living in [[Kashkar]], though the former asserts she belonged to a member of the [[Banu Yashkur]], a branch of the Arab tribe of [[Banu Bakr]], and the latter states she belonged to a Persian ''[[dehqan]]'' (landowning magnate). In the narrative of al-Baladhuri, Sumayya's Yashkuri owner embarked on the [[Hajj]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] seeking to cure his illness and was subsequently treated in Ta'if by [[al-Harith ibn Kalada]], a physician from the [[Banu Thaqif|Thaqif]] clan resident in the city; as a reward for his services, Ibn Kalada was gifted Sumayya. In Awana's narrative, Sumayya was given to Ibn Kalada by the Persian ''dehqan'' after he treated him. In any case, she was ultimately given to Ubayd, a [[R\u00fbm|Greek]] or [[Arameans|Syrian]] slave belonging to Ibn Kalada's wife. Though Ziyad alludes to his Persian origin in a poem, his family claimed that Sumayya was not a slave, but the daughter of a certain al-A'war from the Zayd Manat clan of the Arab tribe of [[Banu Tamim]].{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=519}}\n\n==Early career in Basra==\n[[File:Basra late 19th early 20th century.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A creek in Basra in the early 20th century. Ziyad began his career in Basra in 636 and served as its governor between 665 and his death in 673]]\n\nDuring the reign of Caliph [[Abu Bakr]] ({{reign|632|634}}), Ziyad embraced Islam,{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=519}} which \"opened the world to him\", according to historian [[Julius Wellhausen]].{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=120}} He later became one of the first settlers of the Arab garrison town of [[Basra]].{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=519}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=119}} Before the city's founding in 638, the Muslim troops fighting on the Iraqi front used as their military camp the ruined Persian village on the site.{{sfn|Pellat|1960|p=1085}} Ziyad arrived there with the sons of Ibn Kalada, [[Nafi ibn al-Harith|Nafi]] and [[Nufay ibn al-Harith|Abu Bakra Nufay]].{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=519}} The latter's family gained preeminence in the city, having acquired large landholdings there.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=120}} Abu Bakra's brother-in-law [[Utbah ibn Ghazwan|Utba ibn Ghazwan al-Mazini]] had established the initial camp at Basra in 635 and was the founder and first governor of the city.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=519}}{{sfn|Pellat|1960|p=1085}} The administrative skills of Ziyad became apparent from the time of his adolescence and Utba charged him with minor tasks in the Basran ''[[divan|d\u012bw\u0101n]]'' (bureaucracy) during the reign of Caliph [[Umar]] ({{reign|634|644}}).{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=519}} In 635, Utba tasked him with distributing to the Arab troops the war spoils from the capture of [[al-Ubulla]] (Apologos), a town immediately east of Basra.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=519}}{{sfn|Donner|1981|p=415}} According to the modern historian Isaac Hasson, Ziyad \"distinguished himself as an intelligent and open-minded secretary, who was devoted to his master and to public service ... he showed an unusual aptitude for accounting and had an excellent command of [[epistle|epistolary]] art\".{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=519}} His skills and his assignment by Basra's military governor [[Abu Musa al-Ash'ari]] as his acting replacement while he was on a military campaign gained the attention of Caliph Umar.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=519}} He brought Ziyad to [[Medina]], the center of the nascent Muslim state, where he further tested his skills; Ziyad's performance earned him a reward of 1,000 silver [[dirham]]s by Umar, which he used to purchase the freedom of his mother or his stepfather Ubayd.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=519}} Soon after his return to Basra, Ziyad was made Utba's ''[[katib|k\u0101tib]]'' (scribe or secretary).{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=519}}\n\nAfter Utba's death, Ziyad continued his service as ''k\u0101tib'' under his successors Abu Musa al-Ash'ari and [[al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba]], a member of the Thaqif who became Ziyad's mentor.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=519}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=85}}{{sfn|Donner|1981|p=415}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=119}} When al-Mughira was recalled by Umar to Medina in 638 due to charges of adultery by three accusers, including Abu Bakra Nufay and a certain Shibl ibn Ma'bad al-Bajali, both of whom were Ziyad's maternal half-brothers, Ziyad was also recalled to give his own testimony.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=519}} His statement was partial toward al-Mughira and as a result, the charges were dismissed and the accusers were flogged.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=519}} During the reign of Caliph [[Uthman]] ({{reign|644|656}}), Ziyad served the caliph's appointee to Basra, [[Abdallah ibn Amir|Abd Allah ibn Amir]].{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=519}}\n\nUthman's successor [[Ali]] ({{reign|656|661}}) appointed [[Abd Allah ibn Abbas]] governor of Basra and entrusted Ziyad with collection of the province's ''[[kharaj|khar\u0101j]]'' (land tax) and supervision of the treasury.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}}{{sfn|Madelung|1997|pp=220, 271}} According to Hasson, \"Ali's appreciation of Ziyad's talents were so great\" that he mandated Ibn Abbas heed Ziyad's counsel.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}} When Ibn Abbas left Basra in 657 to accompany Ali at the [[Battle of Siffin]] against the governor of Syria, [[Muawiyah I|Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan]], he left Ziyad as his acting governor.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|pp=277, 280}} During this period, he stamped out an uprising by the Banu Tamim, a major military tribal faction in the city, with critical assistance from another Basran faction, the [[Azd]].{{sfn|Madelung|1997|pp=280\u2013282}} \n\nAfter Ali returned from Siffin, his appointee to the district of [[Pars (Sasanian province)|Fars]], Sahl ibn Hunayf, was ousted by its inhabitants, after which he dispatched Ziyad.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}} The people of Fars were satisfied with Ziyad's leadership and he was able to collect the district's ''khar\u0101j''.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}} He remained in Fars through the remainder of Ali's rule, which ended with the caliph's assassination in 661 and the foundation of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] under Mu'awiya.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}} Afterward, he remained headquartered in a fortress in the vicinity of [[Istakhr]].

The motion was initiated when Ziyad sought clarification from the caliph about rumors of Abu Sufyan's biological paternity.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}} According to Wellhausen, Mu'awiya summoned Ziyad to Damascus and recognized him as his paternal half-brother, \"so as to bind him in this way absolutely to himself and to his family\".{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=121\u2013122}} The decision was seen as scandalous by the [[Umayyad dynasty|Umayyad ruling family]].{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=121}} Mu'awiya's son [[Yazid I|Yazid]] and members from other branches of the clan, namely the extended family of [[Marwan I|Marwan ibn al-Hakam]] in Medina and Abd Allah ibn Amir, the governor of Basra, protested or threatened action against the decision.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}} Ibn Amir and the Marwanids were silenced as a result of threats of force or bribes.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}} Yazid's relations with Ziyad remained strained and satirical poetic verses about the event were spread by Marwan's brother Abd al-Rahman.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=121\u2013122}} Muslim scholars generally viewed the episode as one of Mu'awiya's most disreputable actions.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=332, note 55}}\n\nRealizing that Ziyad \"had both the abilities and the all-important local connections to be his right-hand man in Basra\", Mu'awiya appointed him governor of the province, according to the historian [[Hugh N. Kennedy]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=85}} He entered office in June or July 665, issuing an inaugural carrot-and-stick speech to Basra's restless population.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=85}} According to Hasson it was \"considered a masterpiece of eloquence\".{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}} Wellhausen describes it as \"celebrated\" and the one which was called a \"[speech] without a preface\"{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=122}} because it skipped the traditional introductions praising God and blessing the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=85}} The speech is translated as follows: <blockquote>Ye are putting relationship before religion, ye are excusing and sheltering your criminals, and tearing down the protecting laws sanctified by Islam. Beware of prowling by night; I will kill every one who is found at night in the streets. Beware of the arbitrary summons of relationship; I will cut out the tongue of every one who raises the cry. Whoever pushes anyone into the water, whoever sets fire to another's house, whoever breaks into a house, whoever opens a grave, him will I punish for it. I make every family responsible for those belonging to it. Hatred towards myself I do not punish, but only crime. Many who are terrified at my coming will be glad of my presence, and many who are building their hopes upon it will be undeceived. I rule you with the authority of God and care for your maintenance out of the wealth of God. From you I demand obedience, and ye can demand from me justice. In whatsoever I fall short, three things there are in which I shall not be lacking: at any time I shall be ready to listen to anyone; I shall pay you your pension at the proper time, and I shall not send you to war too far away or keep you in the field overlong. Do not let yourselves be carried away by your hatred and wrath against me ; it would go ill with you if ye did. Many heads do I see tottering; let each man see to it that his own remains on his shoulders!{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=122\u2013123}}</blockquote>  \n\nA number of punitive measures along the lines of those cited in his speech were taken by Ziyad at the start of his term and largely gained for him the Basrans' respect.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=123}} He established unprecedented levels of security in the city, its Iranian dependencies to the east, i.e. Fars and [[Kerman]], and the [[Arabian Desert]] to the south. The [[Kharijites]] of Basra, many of whom were concerned more with banditry than politics, submitted to his authority.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=123\u2013124}} Under Ziyad, Basra began to take shape as a proper Islamic city.{{sfn|Pellat|1960|p=1085}} His rule saw the crude mud bricks of the city's homes replaced by more durable baked bricks and he built a [[congregational mosque]] and residential palace.{{sfn|Pellat|1960|p=1085}} In the words of the historian [[Charles Pellat]], Ziyad, \"to a certain degree, [may] be considered as the artisan of the town's prosperity\".{{sfn|Pellat|1960|p=1085}} His effective rule cemented Mu'awiya's confidence in him.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=85}} In the same year that Ziyad was appointed to Basra, the province of [[Eastern Arabia|Bahrayn]] (eastern Arabia) and its dependency, the [[Al-Yamamah|Yamama]] (central Arabia), were attached to Ziyad's governorship.{{sfn|Baloch|1946|p=258}}\n\n==Viceroy of Iraq and the east==\nAfter the death of al-Mughira in 670, Kufa and its dependencies were attached to Ziyad's governorship, making him the practical viceroy over Iraq and the eastern half of the Caliphate.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=85}}{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=41}} He was the first to serve as the dual governor of Kufa and Basra and divided his residence between the two towns.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}} In the winter he stayed in Basra and left [[Amr ibn Hurayth]] as his deputy in Kufa, while he resided in Kufa in the summer, leaving [[Samura ibn Jundab]] as his deputy in Basra.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}} His strong grip in Kufa marked a shift from al-Mughira's hands-off approach.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=85}} A source of disturbance for him in Kufa was the agitation of the [[Alids]],{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}} partisans of Caliph Ali, led by [[Hujr ibn Adi|Hujr ibn Adi al-Kindi]], who disapproved of Umayyad rule and led the first open calls for the caliphate to be held by Ali's progeny.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=41}} Though al-Mughira tolerated Hujr, Ziyad issued a number of dire warnings to cease his open dissent.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}} He succeeded in turning most of Hujr's supporters among the Kufan troops against him.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=124\u2013125}} In 671, he had Hujr and thirteen of his loyalists arrested and sent to Damascus for punishment, where six, including Hujr, were executed in [[Adra, Syria|Adra]] for their refusal to renounce support for the Alids.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=337}} One of the men, Abd al-Rahman ibn Hassan al-Anazi, who was spared by Mu'awiya later insulted the caliph after refusing his invocation to condemn Ali and was sent back to Ziyad, who had him buried alive as punishment.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=338}}\n\nTo end the chaos in the ''[[amsar|am\u1e63ar]]'' (garrisons) of Basra and Kufa, Ziyad administratively reformed the two towns.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}} From the reign of Caliph Umar, their garrisons consisted of soldiers from different tribes who were grouped together for the distribution of military stipends.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=521}} There were seven such tribal groups in Kufa and Basra and at the head of each group was a chieftain chosen by its members who served as their representative to the government.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|pp=520\u2013521}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=125}} Gradually, this system had become economically inefficient and politically turbulent.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|pp=520\u2013521}} There was no control on Arab immigration into the ''am\u1e63ar'', resulting in overpopulation and in turn, increased competition over fewer resources.{{sfn|Hinds|1993|p=266}} Ziyad thus resolved to form larger divisions by unifying related clans and personally appointing their leader, which resulted in Kufa's reorganization into quarters and Basra into fifths.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=521}} This measure enabled easier control of the two towns' inhabitants.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=521}} Ziyad undertook further reforms in Kufa and Basra, including regularizing the timely payment of stipends, embarking on agricultural development schemes, including canal digging, and minting [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]]-style dirhams that bore his name as \"Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan\".{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=521}}\n\n===Consolidation of Khurasan===\n[[File:Transoxiana 8th century.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Map of early medieval Central Asia with [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], where

[[Sistan|Sijistan]], the far eastern regions of the Caliphate which were considered dependencies of the Basra garrison.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}} The Arab conquests of these areas in the 640s and 650s were akin to raids and did not firmly establish the Caliphate's power.{{sfn|Gibb|1923|p=15}} Moreover, the political instability of the final years of Uthman's caliphate and the First Muslim Civil War saw local revolts which further weakened Arab authority.{{sfn|Shaban|1979|pp=26\u201327}} In 655, the Sasanian prince [[Peroz III]], backed by the army of [[Tukharistan]], attempted to reassert Persian power.{{sfn|Gibb|1923|p=16}} Under previous caliphs, the vast region had been experimentally divided into separate provinces under the leadership of Arab tribal chiefs.{{sfn|Gibb|1923|p=16}} Governance was largely left to local princes.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=86}} Fearing a Persian resurgence, which a fragmentary division of Khurasan could afford, Ziyad centralized the administration of the province in the small Arab garrison at Merv.{{sfn|Gibb|1923|p=16}} \n\nTo relieve Basra's fiscal pressures, Ziyad recommenced the [[Muslim conquest of Transoxiana|Muslim conquests in Central Asia]].{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=521}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=86}} He organized the Arab military presence in Khurasan.{{sfn|Gibb|1923|p=16}} In 667, he dispatched an army to the region under his lieutenant general [[al-Hakam ibn Amr al-Ghifari]].{{sfn|Gibb|1923|p=16}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=86}} The latter conquered lower Tukharistan and [[Gharchistan]] and temporarily crossed the [[Oxus]] river into [[Transoxiana]], forcing Peroz to withdraw into [[Tang dynasty|Tang China]].{{sfn|Gibb|1923|p=16}} Meanwhile, Ziyad's removal of dead soldiers and input of new recruits to the Iraqi army registers led to numerous tribesmen being taken off the payrolls.{{sfn|Shaban|1979|pp=31\u201332}} He dispatched 50,000 Arab soldiers and their families from Basra and Kufa to permanently settle in the Merv oasis of Khurasan.{{sfn|Shaban|1979|p=32}} The resettlement of these troops may have been a means \"to defuse possibly dangerous developments\" relating to the Arab tribal influx in the two garrison towns, according to the historian [[Gerald Hawting]].{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=41}} As a result, the Merv oasis became home to the largest concentration of Muslims outside of the [[Fertile Crescent]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=86}} \n\nAl-Hakam's successor, [[Ghalib ibn Abd Allah al-Laythi]], was less successful in subduing Tukharistan and Ziyad sent another of his lieutenants, [[Rabi ibn Ziyad al-Harithi]], to stamp out the revolts in the conquered areas in 670/71.{{sfn|Shaban|1979|p=32}}{{sfn|Gibb|1923|p=16}} Rabi proceeded to secure the capitulation of [[Balkh]], whose inhabitants had revolted against Arab rule, in a treaty and then destroyed the army of the [[Hephthalites|Hepthalite]] princes in [[Quhistan]].{{sfn|Shaban|1979|p=32}} In 673, Rabi's son Abd Allah extended Arab rule to the western banks of the Oxus and established tributary agreements with the fortress towns of [[Amul]] and [[Zamm]].{{sfn|Shaban|1979|p=32}} To solidify the territorial gains and supply the manpower for further conquests Ziyad intended for the Arab troops, initially concentrated in the Merv oasis, to colonize other parts of Khurasan.{{sfn|Shaban|1979|pp=32\u201334}} They were ultimately distributed between five regional garrisons under Ziyad's successors.{{sfn|Shaban|1979|p=34}}{{sfn|Gibb|1923|p=17}}\n\n==Legacy and assessment==\nZiyad died in the village of al-Thawiyya near Kufa on 23 August 673.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=519}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=126}} He was buried in a cemetery there that contained the graves of several Qurayshites and left an inheritance of 10,000 silver dirhams.{{sfn|Fariq|1966|p=128}} During his governorship of Kufa in 675\u2013678, [[al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Fihri]] visited Ziyad's grave and recited an elegy: <blockquote>If nobility and Islam ever immortalized a human being, <br /> They would certainly immortalize you.{{sfn|Boullata|2011|p=164}}</blockquote> A year after his death, Mu'awiya appointed Ziyad's son [[Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad|Ubayd

role in the Muslim conquest of Iraq, provided the Umayyad dynasty with a series of viceroys in Iraq, including al-Mughira, Ziyad, Ubayd Allah and [[al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf]] ({{reign|694|714}}), and the Muslim traditional sources devote more attention to them than the caliphs on whose behalf they ruled.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=113\u2013114}} Along with his mentor al-Mughira, Ziyad and his family were part of what \"some must have seen as a Thaqafi mafia\" controlling Iraq and the east, according to Kennedy.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=86}} \n\nAmong \"the most gifted governors of the Umayyad era\", Ziyad \"had a good understanding of his task as governor, and had a great influence on his successors concerning the conception of the duties of rulers\", according to Hasson.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}} According to Kennedy, Ziyad's settlement of Iraqi Arab troops in Khurasan had \"extremely important consequences for Islamic history\" as the descendants of those settlers,{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=86}}

kinsmen.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=124\u2013125}} The incident would serve as a harbinger for future pro-Alid risings.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=41}} The death of Hujr represented the first political

against some Alid partisans, including crucifixions.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}}\n\nInterest in Ziyad's biography emerged early on among the traditional Muslim historians, with works written about him by [[Abu Mikhnaf]] (d. 774), [[Hisham ibn al-Kalbi]] (d. 819) and Abd al-Aziz ibn Yahya al-Jaludi (d. 943).{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=521}} He is considered a highly skilled orator among Arabs, with his inaugural speech and fragments of other speeches and sayings cited in [[Islamic literature]] and Arabic rhetoric, polemics and histories.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=521}} He is counted alongside Mu'awiya, al-Mughira and [[Amr ibn al-As]], the conqueror and governor of Egypt, as one of the four ''duh\u0101t'' (i.e. \"shrewds\") among the Arab statesmen of his era.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=521}} According to the medieval Syrian historian [[Ibn Asakir]] (d. 1176), Ziyad had expert knowledge of the [[Qur'an]], its tenets and [[fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]].{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=521}} A medieval Basran historian, Muhammad ibn Imran al-Abdi, related that Ziyad respected and enjoyed listening to the [[hadith]]s about Umar and proclaimed about them: \"This is the truth we hear!

He served as the governor of [[Basra]] in 665\u2013670 and ultimately the first governor of [[History of Iraq#Middle Ages|Iraq]] and virtual viceroy of the eastern Caliphate between 670 and his death.\n\nZiyad's parentage is obscure, but he was raised among the [[Banu Thaqif]] in [[Ta'if]] and arrived with his adoptive tribesmen in Basra upon its foundation in 636 as the Muslim Arabs' springboard for the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|conquest of the Sasanian Empire]]. He was initially employed by the city's first governor, [[Utbah ibn Ghazwan|Utba ibn Ghazwan al-Mazini]], and was kept on as a scribe or secretary by his successors. Caliph [[Ali]] ({{reign|656|661}}) appointed Ziyad to [[Pars (Sasanian province)|Fars]] to suppress a local rebellion and he maintained his loyalty to Ali's caliphate after the latter's assassination in 661 and the subsequent rule of Ali's enemy, [[Mu'awiya I]] ({{reign|661|680}}). The latter ultimately overcame Ziyad's opposition, formally recognized him as his own paternal half-brother and appointed him governor of Basra. Ziyad's inaugural speech, in which he announced his carrot-and-stick policies to the city's turbulent population, is celebrated in Arab history for its eloquence. After the death of [[Kufa]]'s governor, Ziyad's mentor [[al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba]], Mu'awiya made Ziyad the first governor of a unified Iraqi province. He administratively reorganized the [[amsar|garrison cities]] and minted [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]]-style silver [[dirham]]s in his own name. He firmly established Arab power and recommenced conquests in the Caliphate's easternmost province of [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]] by relocating there 50,000 Arab soldiers and their families from Iraq and dispatching expeditionary forces against [[Tukharistan]], [[Balkh]] and [[Quhistan]]. Though the mass resettlement improved Iraq's economic and political conditions by siphoning off Arab tribal soldiers from the overcrowded garrisons and creating new opportunities for war spoils, the move had major ramifications for the Caliphate as the descendants of these Khurasani Arab troops formed the army that toppled the Umayyads in 750. \n\nZiyad died near Kufa in 673, but his sons [[Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad|Ubayd Allah]], [[Abd al-Rahman ibn Ziyad|Abd al-Rahman]], [[Salm ibn Ziyad|Salm]], [[Abbad ibn Ziyad|Abbad]] and [[Yazid ibn Ziyad|Yazid]] went on to hold posts as governors or deputy governors of Iraq, Khurasan and [[Sistan|Sijistan]]. Ziyad was the subject of early Arabic biographies and is remembered in Arab history as one of the four great wise men of his era and as a highly skilled administrator and orator. His administration in Iraq served as a model for his successors.\n\n==Origins==\nZiyad was likely born in [[Ta'if]] in 622 or 623/24.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=519}} His precise parentage is obscure, hence his frequent name in the sources as ''Ziy\u0101d ibn Ab\u012bhi'' (\"Ziyad son of his father\").{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=85}}{{sfn|Lynch|2018|page=1662}} He was the illegitimate son of a certain Sumayya, his father being unknown. The origins of Sumayya are also obscure. The 9th-century historians [[al-Baladhuri]] and [[Awana ibn al-Hakam]] both relate that she had been a slave living in [[Kashkar]], though the former asserts she belonged to a member of the [[Banu Yashkur]], a branch of the Arab tribe of [[Banu Bakr]], and the latter states she belonged to a Persian ''[[dehqan]]'' (landowning magnate). In the narrative of al-Baladhuri, Sumayya's Yashkuri owner embarked on the [[Hajj]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] seeking to cure his illness and was subsequently treated in Ta'if by [[al-Harith ibn Kalada]], a physician from the [[Banu Thaqif|Thaqif]] clan resident in the city; as a reward for his services, Ibn Kalada was gifted Sumayya. In Awana's narrative, Sumayya was given to Ibn Kalada by the Persian ''dehqan'' after he treated him. In any case, she was ultimately given to Ubayd, a [[R\u00fbm|Greek]] or [[Arameans|Syrian]] slave belonging to Ibn Kalada's wife. Though Ziyad alludes to his Persian origin in a poem, his family claimed that Sumayya was not a slave, but the daughter of a certain al-A'war from the Zayd Manat clan of the Arab tribe of [[Banu Tamim]].{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=519}}\n\n==Early career in Basra==\n[[File:Basra late 19th early 20th century.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A creek in Basra in the early 20th century.

The motion was initiated when Ziyad sought clarification from the caliph about rumors of Abu Sufyan's biological paternity.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}} According to Wellhausen, Mu'awiya summoned Ziyad to Damascus and recognized him as his paternal half-brother, \"so as to bind him in this way absolutely to himself and to his family\".{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=121\u2013122}} The decision was seen as scandalous by the [[Umayyad dynasty|Umayyad ruling family]].{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=121}} Mu'awiya's son [[Yazid I|Yazid]] and members from other branches of the clan, namely the extended family of [[Marwan I|Marwan ibn al-Hakam]] in Medina and Abd Allah ibn Amir, the governor of Basra, protested or threatened action against the decision.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}} Ibn Amir and the Marwanids were silenced as a result of threats of force or bribes.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}} Yazid's relations with Ziyad remained strained and satirical poetic verses about the event were spread by Marwan's brother Abd al-Rahman.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=121\u2013122}} Muslim scholars generally viewed the episode as one of Mu'awiya's most disreputable actions.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=332, note 55}}\n\nRealizing that Ziyad \"had both the abilities and the all-important local connections to be his right-hand man in Basra\", Mu'awiya appointed him governor of the province, according to the historian [[Hugh N. Kennedy]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=85}} He entered office in June or July 665, issuing an inaugural carrot-and-stick speech to Basra's restless population.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=85}} According to Hasson it was \"considered a masterpiece of eloquence\".{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}} Wellhausen describes it as \"celebrated\" and the one which was called a \"[speech] without a preface\"{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=122}} because it skipped the traditional introductions praising God and blessing the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=85}} The speech is translated as follows: <blockquote>Ye are putting relationship before religion, ye are excusing and sheltering your criminals, and tearing down the protecting laws sanctified by Islam. Beware of prowling by night; I will kill every one who is found at night in the streets. Beware of the arbitrary summons of relationship; I will cut out the tongue of every one who raises the cry. Whoever pushes anyone into the water, whoever sets fire to another's house, whoever breaks into a house, whoever opens a grave, him will I punish for it. I make every family responsible for those belonging to it. Hatred towards myself I do not punish, but only crime. Many who are terrified at my coming will be glad of my presence, and many who are building their hopes upon it will be undeceived. I rule you with the authority of God and care for your maintenance out of the wealth of God. From you I demand obedience, and ye can demand from me justice. In whatsoever I fall short, three things there are in which I shall not be lacking: at any time I shall be ready to listen to anyone; I shall pay you your pension at the proper time, and I shall not send you to war too far away or keep you in the field overlong. Do not let yourselves be carried away by your hatred and wrath against me ; it would go ill with you if ye did. Many heads do I see tottering; let each man see to it that his own remains on his shoulders!{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=122\u2013123}}</blockquote>  \n\nA number of punitive measures along the lines of those cited in his speech were taken by Ziyad at the start of his term and largely gained for him the Basrans' respect.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=123}} He established unprecedented levels of security in the city, its Iranian dependencies to the east, i.e. Fars and [[Kerman]], and the [[Arabian Desert]] to the south. The [[Kharijites]] of Basra, many of whom were concerned more with banditry than politics, submitted to his authority.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=123\u2013124}} Under Ziyad, Basra began to take shape as a proper Islamic city.{{sfn|Pellat|1960|p=1085}} His rule saw the crude mud bricks of the city's homes replaced by more durable baked bricks and he built a [[congregational mosque]] and residential palace.{{sfn|Pellat|1960|p=1085}} In the words of the historian [[Charles Pellat]], Ziyad, \"to a certain degree, [may] be considered as the artisan of the town's prosperity\".{{sfn|Pellat|1960|p=1085}} His effective rule cemented Mu'awiya's confidence in him.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=85}} In the same year that Ziyad was appointed to Basra, the province of [[Eastern Arabia|Bahrayn]] (eastern Arabia) and its dependency, the [[Al-Yamamah|Yamama]] (central Arabia), were attached to Ziyad's governorship.{{sfn|Baloch|1946|p=258}}\n\n==Viceroy of Iraq and the east==\nAfter the death of al-Mughira in 670, Kufa and its dependencies were attached to Ziyad's governorship, making him the practical viceroy over Iraq and the eastern half of the Caliphate.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=85}}{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=41}} He was the first to serve as the dual governor of Kufa and Basra and divided his residence between the two towns.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}} In the winter he stayed in Basra and left [[Amr ibn Hurayth]] as his deputy in Kufa, while he resided in Kufa in the summer, leaving [[Samura ibn Jundab]] as his deputy in Basra.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}} His strong grip in Kufa marked a shift from al-Mughira's hands-off approach.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=85}} A source of disturbance for him in Kufa was the agitation of the [[Alids]],{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}} partisans of Caliph Ali, led by [[Hujr ibn Adi|Hujr ibn Adi al-Kindi]], who disapproved of Umayyad rule and led the first open calls for the caliphate to be held by Ali's progeny.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=41}} Though al-Mughira tolerated Hujr, Ziyad issued a number of dire warnings to cease his open dissent.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}} He succeeded in turning most of Hujr's supporters among the Kufan troops against him.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=124\u2013125}} In 671, he had Hujr and thirteen of his loyalists arrested and sent to Damascus for punishment, where six, including Hujr, were executed in [[Adra, Syria|Adra]] for their refusal to renounce support for the Alids.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=337}} One of the men, Abd al-Rahman ibn Hassan al-Anazi, who was spared by Mu'awiya later insulted the caliph after refusing his invocation to condemn Ali and was sent back to Ziyad, who had him buried alive as punishment.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=338}}\n\nTo end the chaos in the ''[[amsar|am\u1e63ar]]'' (garrisons) of Basra and Kufa, Ziyad administratively reformed the two towns.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}} From the reign of Caliph Umar, their garrisons consisted of soldiers from different tribes who were grouped together for the distribution of military stipends.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=521}} There were seven such tribal groups in Kufa and Basra and at the head of each group was a chieftain chosen by its members who served as their representative to the government.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|pp=520\u2013521}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=125}} Gradually, this system had become economically inefficient and politically turbulent.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|pp=520\u2013521}} There was no control on Arab immigration into the ''am\u1e63ar'', resulting in overpopulation and in turn, increased competition over fewer resources.{{sfn|Hinds|1993|p=266}} Ziyad thus resolved to form larger divisions by unifying related clans and personally appointing their leader, which resulted in Kufa's reorganization into quarters and Basra into fifths.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=521}} This measure enabled easier control of the two towns' inhabitants.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=521}} Ziyad undertook further reforms in Kufa and Basra, including regularizing the timely payment of stipends, embarking on agricultural development schemes, including canal digging, and minting [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]]-style dirhams that bore his name as \"Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan\".{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=521}}\n\n===Consolidation of Khurasan===\n[[File:Transoxiana 8th century.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Map of early medieval Central Asia with [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], where

[[Sistan|Sijistan]], the far eastern regions of the Caliphate which were considered dependencies of the Basra garrison.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}} The Arab conquests of these areas in the 640s and 650s were akin to raids and did not firmly establish the Caliphate's power.{{sfn|Gibb|1923|p=15}} Moreover, the political instability of the final years of Uthman's caliphate and the First Muslim Civil War saw local revolts which further weakened Arab authority.{{sfn|Shaban|1979|pp=26\u201327}} In 655, the Sasanian prince [[Peroz III]], backed by the army of [[Tukharistan]], attempted to reassert Persian power.{{sfn|Gibb|1923|p=16}} Under previous caliphs, the vast region had been experimentally divided into separate provinces under the leadership of Arab tribal chiefs.{{sfn|Gibb|1923|p=16}} Governance was largely left to local princes.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=86}} Fearing a Persian resurgence, which a fragmentary division of Khurasan could afford, Ziyad centralized the administration of the province in the small Arab garrison at Merv.{{sfn|Gibb|1923|p=16}} \n\nTo relieve Basra's fiscal pressures, Ziyad recommenced the [[Muslim conquest of Transoxiana|Muslim conquests in Central Asia]].{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=521}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=86}} He organized the Arab military presence in Khurasan.{{sfn|Gibb|1923|p=16}} In 667, he dispatched an army to the region under his lieutenant general [[al-Hakam ibn Amr al-Ghifari]].{{sfn|Gibb|1923|p=16}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=86}} The latter conquered lower Tukharistan and [[Gharchistan]] and temporarily crossed the [[Oxus]] river into [[Transoxiana]], forcing Peroz to withdraw into [[Tang dynasty|Tang China]].{{sfn|Gibb|1923|p=16}} Meanwhile, Ziyad's removal of dead soldiers and input of new recruits to the Iraqi army registers led to numerous tribesmen being taken off the payrolls.{{sfn|Shaban|1979|pp=31\u201332}} He dispatched 50,000 Arab soldiers and their families from Basra and Kufa to permanently settle in the Merv oasis of Khurasan.{{sfn|Shaban|1979|p=32}} The resettlement of these troops may have been a means \"to defuse possibly dangerous developments\" relating to the Arab tribal influx in the two garrison towns, according to the historian [[Gerald Hawting]].{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=41}} As a result, the Merv oasis became home to the largest concentration of Muslims outside of the [[Fertile Crescent]].{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=86}} \n\nAl-Hakam's successor, [[Ghalib ibn Abd Allah al-Laythi]], was less successful in subduing Tukharistan and Ziyad sent another of his lieutenants, [[Rabi ibn Ziyad al-Harithi]], to stamp out the revolts in the conquered areas in 670/71.{{sfn|Shaban|1979|p=32}}{{sfn|Gibb|1923|p=16}} Rabi proceeded to secure the capitulation of [[Balkh]], whose inhabitants had revolted against Arab rule, in a treaty and then destroyed the army of the [[Hephthalites|Hepthalite]] princes in [[Quhistan]].{{sfn|Shaban|1979|p=32}} In 673, Rabi's son Abd Allah extended Arab rule to the western banks of the Oxus and established tributary agreements with the fortress towns of [[Amul]] and [[Zamm]].{{sfn|Shaban|1979|p=32}} To solidify the territorial gains and supply the manpower for further conquests Ziyad intended for the Arab troops, initially concentrated in the Merv oasis, to colonize other parts of Khurasan.{{sfn|Shaban|1979|pp=32\u201334}} They were ultimately distributed between five regional garrisons under Ziyad's successors.{{sfn|Shaban|1979|p=34}}{{sfn|Gibb|1923|p=17}}\n\n==Legacy and assessment==\nZiyad died in the village of al-Thawiyya near Kufa on 23 August 673.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=519}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=126}} He was buried in a cemetery there that contained the graves of several Qurayshites and left an inheritance of 10,000 silver dirhams.{{sfn|Fariq|1966|p=128}} During his governorship of Kufa in 675\u2013678, [[al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Fihri]] visited Ziyad's grave and recited an elegy: <blockquote>If nobility and Islam ever immortalized a human being, <br /> They would certainly immortalize you.{{sfn|Boullata|2011|p=164}}</blockquote> A year after his death, Mu'awiya appointed Ziyad's son [[Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad|Ubayd

role in the Muslim conquest of Iraq, provided the Umayyad dynasty with a series of viceroys in Iraq, including al-Mughira, Ziyad, Ubayd Allah and [[al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf]] ({{reign|694|714}}), and the Muslim traditional sources devote more attention to them than the caliphs on whose behalf they ruled.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=113\u2013114}} Along with his mentor al-Mughira, Ziyad and his family were part of what \"some must have seen as a Thaqafi mafia\" controlling Iraq and the east, according to Kennedy.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=86}} \n\nAmong \"the most gifted governors of the Umayyad era\", Ziyad \"had a good understanding of his task as governor, and had a great influence on his successors concerning the conception of the duties of rulers\", according to Hasson.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}} According to Kennedy, Ziyad's settlement of Iraqi Arab troops in Khurasan had \"extremely important consequences for Islamic history\" as the descendants of those settlers,{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=86}}

kinsmen.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|pp=124\u2013125}} The incident would serve as a harbinger for future pro-Alid risings.{{sfn|Hawting|2000|p=41}} The death of Hujr represented the first political

against some Alid partisans, including crucifixions.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=520}}\n\nInterest in Ziyad's biography emerged early on among the traditional Muslim historians, with works written about him by [[Abu Mikhnaf]] (d. 774), [[Hisham ibn al-Kalbi]] (d. 819) and Abd al-Aziz ibn Yahya al-Jaludi (d. 943).{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=521}} He is considered a highly skilled orator among Arabs, with his inaugural speech and fragments of other speeches and sayings cited in [[Islamic literature]] and Arabic rhetoric, polemics and histories.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=521}} He is counted alongside Mu'awiya, al-Mughira and [[Amr ibn al-As]], the conqueror and governor of Egypt, as one of the four ''duh\u0101t'' (i.e. \"shrewds\") among the Arab statesmen of his era.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=521}} According to the medieval Syrian historian [[Ibn Asakir]] (d. 1176), Ziyad had expert knowledge of the [[Qur'an]], its tenets and [[fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]].{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=521}} A medieval Basran historian, Muhammad ibn Imran al-Abdi, related that Ziyad respected and enjoyed listening to the [[hadith]]s about Umar and proclaimed about them: \"This is the truth we hear! This is the [[sunnah|sunna]]!\"{{sfn|Hakim|2008|p=23}} Ziyad is credited by a number of sources for transmitting sayings by the Islamic prophet Muhammad through Umar as the original transmitter.{{sfn|Hasson|2002|p=521}} In 777 the Abbasid authorities stripped Ziyad's descendants of their status as official members of the Quraysh (the tribe to which the Umayyads and Abbasids belonged) in the ''d\u012bw\u0101n'' rolls, which entitled them to relatively high pensions, and declared them part of Thaqif, whose members were paid less.{{sfn|Tritton|1954|p=171}} At some point afterward, they were reinstated as Quraysh as a result of bribing government officials.{{sfn|Tritton|1954|p=171}}\n\n==Family==\nZiyad had numerous wives and ''[[umm walad|ummahat awlad]]'' (slave women who bore children; sing.

This Empire had the second largest area in Europe (after the [[Russian Empire]]), and it was the third most populous (after Russia and the [[German Empire]]). The two realms were governed separately by two parliaments from two capital cities, with a common monarch and common external and military policies. Economically, the empire was a customs union. The old Hungarian Constitution was restored, and Franz Joseph I was crowned as [[King of Hungary]]. The era witnessed impressive economic development. The formerly backward Hungarian economy became relatively modern and industrialized by the turn of the 20th century, although agriculture remained dominant until 1890.

The [[Little Entente]], sensing an opportunity, invaded the country from three sides\u2014Romania [[Hungarian-Romanian War|invaded]] [[Transylvania]], Czechoslovakia annexed [[Upper Hungary]] (today's Slovakia), and a joint [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serb]]-[[French Army|French]] coalition annexed [[Vojvodina]] and other southern regions.

Though free elections continued, Horthy's personality, and those of his personally selected prime ministers, dominated the political scene.

The [[Great Depression]] further exacerbated the situation and the popularity of fascist politicians such as [[Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s]] and [[Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi]], promising economic and social recovery, rose.\n\nHorthy's nationalist agenda reached its apogee in 1938 and 1940, when the Nazis rewarded Hungary's staunchly pro-Germany foreign policy in the [[First Vienna Award|First]] and [[Second Vienna Award]]s, respectively, peacefully restoring ethnic-Hungarian-majority areas lost after Trianon.

The following political cooling saw the ascent of [[Imre Nagy]] to the premiership, and the growing interest of students and intellectuals in political life. Nagy promised market liberalization and political openness, while R\u00e1kosi opposed both vigorously. R\u00e1kosi eventually managed to discredit Nagy and replace him with the more hard-line [[Ern\u0151 Ger\u0151]]. Hungary joined the [[Warsaw Pact]] in May 1955, as societal dissatisfaction with the regime swelled. Following the firing on peaceful demonstrations by Soviet soldiers and secret police, and rallies throughout the country on 23 October 1956, protesters took to the streets in Budapest, initiating the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Revolution]]. In an effort to quell the chaos, Nagy returned as premier, promised free elections, and took Hungary out of the Warsaw Pact.\n\nThe violence nonetheless continued as revolutionary militias sprung up against the Soviet Army and the \u00c1VH; the roughly 3,000-strong resistance fought Soviet tanks using [[Molotov cocktail]]s and machine-pistols. Though the preponderance of the Soviets was immense, they suffered heavy losses, and by 30 October 1956 most Soviet troops had withdrawn from Budapest to garrison the countryside. For a time, the Soviet leadership was unsure how to respond to developments in Hungary, but eventually decided to intervene to prevent a destabilization of the Soviet bloc. On 4 November reinforcements of more than 150,000 troops and 2,500 tanks entered the country from the Soviet Union.<ref>Findley, Carter V., and John Rothney. ''Twentieth Century World''. sixth ed.

K\u00e1d\u00e1r quickly normalized the situation. In 1963, the government granted a general amnesty and released the majority of those imprisoned for their active participation in the uprising. K\u00e1d\u00e1r proclaimed a new policy line, according to which the people were no longer compelled to profess loyalty to the party if they tacitly accepted the Socialist regime as a fact of life. In many speeches, he described this as, \"Those who are not against us are with us.\" K\u00e1d\u00e1r introduced new planning priorities in the economy, such as allowing farmers significant plots of private land within the collective farm system (''h\u00e1zt\u00e1ji gazd\u00e1lkod\u00e1s''). The living standard rose as consumer good and food production took precedence over military production, which was reduced to one tenth of pre-revolutionary levels.\n\nIn 1968, the [[New Economic Mechanism]] (NEM) introduced free-market elements into socialist command economy. From the 1960s through the late 1980s, Hungary was often referred to as \"[[the happiest barrack]]\" within the [[Eastern bloc]]. During the latter part of the Cold War Hungary's [[GDP per capita]] was fourth only to [[East Germany]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], and the Soviet Union itself.<ref name=\"madison185\">*{{Cite book|last=Maddison|first=Angus |title=The world economy|publisher=OECD Publishing|year=2006|isbn=978-92-64-02261-4|page=185}}</ref> As a result of this relatively high standard of living, a more liberalized economy, a less censored press, and less restricted travel rights, Hungary was generally considered one of the more liberal countries in which to live in Central Europe during communism.

Although the MSzMP began [[Hungarian Round Table Talks|Round Table Talks]] with various opposition groups in March 1989, the reburial of Imre Nagy as a revolutionary martyr that June is widely considered the symbolic end of communism in Hungary. Over 100,000 people attended the Budapest ceremony without any significant government interference, and many speakers openly called for Soviet troops to leave the country. Free elections were held [[1990 Hungarian parliamentary election|in May 1990]], and the [[Hungarian Democratic Forum]], a major conservative opposition group, was elected to the head of a coalition government. [[J\u00f3zsef Antall]] became the first democratically elected Prime Minister since World War II.\n\nWith the removal of state subsidies and rapid privatization in 1991, Hungary was affected by a severe economic recession. The Antall government's austerity measures proved unpopular, and the Communist Party's legal and political heir, the [[Hungarian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], won the subsequent [[1994 Hungarian parliamentary election|1994 elections]]. This abrupt shift in the political landscape was repeated in [[1998 Hungarian parliamentary election|1998]] and [[2002 Hungarian parliamentary election|2002]]; each electoral cycle, the governing party was ousted and the erstwhile opposition elected. Like most other post-communist European states, however, Hungary broadly pursued an [[European integration|integrationist]] agenda, [[Enlargement of NATO|joining]] [[NATO]] in 1999 and the European Union [[2003 Hungarian European Union membership referendum|in 2004]]. As a NATO member, Hungary was involved in the [[Yugoslav Wars]].\n\nIn 2006, [[2006 protests in Hungary|major protests]] erupted after it was revealed that Prime Minister [[Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny]] had claimed in [[\u0150sz\u00f6d speech|a private speech]] that [[Hungarian Socialist Party|his party]] \"lied\" to win the [[2006 Hungarian parliamentary election|recent elections]].

Hungarian historiography identifies the foundation of the Hungarian state with [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I's]] [[baptism]] and coronation with the [[Szentkorona|Holy Crown]] in A.D. 1000. Stephen promulgated [[Roman Catholicism]] as the state religion, and his successors were traditionally known as the [[Apostolic King]]s. The [[Catholic Church in Hungary]] remained strong through the centuries, and the [[Archbishop of Esztergom]] was granted extraordinary temporal privileges as [[prince-primate]] (''hercegpr\u00edm\u00e1s'') of Hungary. \n\nAlthough contemporary Hungary has no [[official religion]] and recognizes [[freedom of religion]] as a fundamental right, the Hungarian constitution \"recognizes Christianity's nation-building role\" in its preamble<ref>{{cite web|title=Magyarorsz\u00e1g Alapt\u00f6rv\u00e9nye|url=http://www.parlament.hu/irom39/02627/02627.pdf|website=Parlament.hu|publisher=Hungarian Parliament|accessdate=2 August 2014}}</ref> and in Article VII affirms that \"the state may cooperate with the churches for community goals.\"<ref>[https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Hungary_2011.pdf Hungary's Constitution of 2011]</ref>\n\nDuring the initial stages of the [[Protestant Reformation]], most Hungarians took up, first, [[Lutheranism]], then [[Calvinism]] in the form of the [[Hungarian Reformed Church]]. In the second half of the 16th century, the [[Jesuits]] led a [[Counterreformation]] campaign and the population once again became predominantly Catholic. This campaign was only partially successful, however, and the (mainly Reformed) Hungarian nobility were able to secure freedom of worship for Christians. In practice this meant ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]''; thus, most individual localities in Hungary are still identifiable as historically Catholic, Lutheran, or Reformed.

In contrast to Historicism, Hungarian Art Nouveau is based on the national architectural characteristics. Taking the eastern origins of the Hungarians into account, [[\u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner]] (1845\u20131914), the most important figure in Hungarian Art Nouveau, was initially inspired by Indian and Syrian architecture, and later by traditional Hungarian decorative designs. In this way, he created an original synthesis of architectural styles. By applying them to three-dimensional architectural elements, he produced a version of Art Nouveau that was specific to Hungary.\n\nTurning away from the style of Lechner, yet taking inspiration from his approach, the group of \"Young People\" (''Fiatalok''), which included [[K\u00e1roly K\u00f3s]] and Dezs\u00f6 Zrumeczky, were to use the characteristic structures and forms of traditional Hungarian architecture to achieve the same end.\n\n[[File:Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest).jpg|thumb|The [[Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Applied Arts]], an [[Art Nouveau]] building designed by [[\u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner]]]]\n\nBesides the two principal styles, Budapest also displays local versions of trends originating from other European countries. The Sezession from [[Vienna]], the German [[Jugendstil]], Art Nouveau from Belgium and France, and the influence of English and Finnish architecture are all reflected in the buildings constructed at the turn of the 20th century. [[B\u00e9la Lajta]] initially adopted Lechner's style, subsequently drawing his inspiration from English and Finnish trends; after developing an interest in the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] style, he finally arrived at modern architecture. [[Alad\u00e1r \u00c1rkay]] took almost the same route. [[Istv\u00e1n Medgyaszay]] developed his own style, which differed from Lechner's, using stylised traditional motifs to create decorative designs in concrete. In the sphere of applied arts, those chiefly responsible for promoting the spread of Art Nouveau were the School and Museum of Decorative Arts, which opened in 1896.\n\nForeigners have unexpectedly \"discovered\" that a significantly large portion of the citizens live in old and architecturally valuable buildings.

Hungarian traditional music tends to have a strong [[dactyl (poetry)|dactylic]] rhythm, as the language is invariably stressed on the first syllable of each word.\n\nHungary has renowned composers of contemporary classical music, [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]], [[Gy\u00f6rgy Kurt\u00e1g]], [[Peter E\u00f6tv\u00f6s|P\u00e9ter E\u00f6tv\u00f6s]], [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]] and [[Zolt\u00e1n Jeney]] among them. One of the greatest Hungarian composers, [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], was also among the most significant musicians of the 20th century. His music was invigorated by the themes, modes, and rhythmic patterns of the Hungarian and neighboring folk music traditions he studied, which he synthesized with influences from his contemporaries into his own distinctive style.<ref>[http://mek.oszk.hu/02100/02172/html/index.html Szabolcsi] Although the Hungarian upper class has long had cultural and political connections with the rest of Europe, leading to an influx of European musical ideas, the rural peasants maintained their own traditions such that by the end of the 19th century Hungarian composers could draw on rural peasant music to (re)create a Hungarian classical style.

The first printing house was also founded during Matthias' reign, by [[Andr\u00e1s Hess]], in Buda. The first book printed in Hungary was the [[Chronica Hungarorum]].\nThe most important poets of the period was [[B\u00e1lint Balassi]] (1554\u20131594) and [[Nikola Zrinski|Mikl\u00f3s Zr\u00ednyi]] (1620\u20131664).\n\nBalassi's poetry shows medieval influences, his poems can be divided into three sections: love poems, war poems and religious poems. Zr\u00ednyi's most significant work, the epic ''[[Peril of Sziget|Szigeti veszedelem]]'' (\"Peril of Sziget\", written in 1648/49) is written in a fashion similar to the ''[[Iliad]]'', and recounts the heroic [[Battle of Szigetv\u00e1r]], where his great-grandfather died while defending the castle of Szigetv\u00e1r.\nAmong the religious literary works the most important is the Bible translation by [[G\u00e1sp\u00e1r K\u00e1roli]] (The second Hungarian Bible translation in the history), the Protestant pastor of [[G\u00f6nc]], in 1590. The translation is called the ''Bible of Vizsoly'', after the town where it was first published.

From the men's intricate bootslapping dances to the ancient women's circle dances, Cs\u00e1rd\u00e1s demonstrates the infectious exuberance of the Hungarian folk dancing still celebrated in the villages.\n\n[[Verbunkos]] is a solo man's dance evolved from the recruiting performances of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] army.\n\nThe [[Leg\u00e9nyes]] is a men's solo dance done by the ethnic Hungarian people living in the [[Kalotaszeg]] region of Transylvania. Although usually danced by young men, it can be also danced by older men. The dance is generally performed freestyle by one dancer at a time in front of a band. Women participate in the dance by standing in lines to the side, and singing or shouting verses while the men dance. Each man performs a number of points (dance phrases), typically four to eight without repetition. Each point consists of four parts, each lasting four counts. The first part is usually the same for everyone (there are only a few variations).\n\nIt was in the beginning of the 18th-century that the present style of Hungarian folk art took shape, incorporating both [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] elements, depending on the area, as well as Persian [[Sassanide]] influences. Flowers and leaves, sometimes a bird or a spiral ornament, are the principal decorative themes. The most frequent ornament is a flower with a centerpiece resembling the eye of a peacock's feather.\n\nNearly all the manifestations of folk art practiced elsewhere in Europe also flourished among the [[hungarian people|Magyar]] peasantry at one time or another, their ceramics and textile being the most highly developed of all.\n\nThe finest achievements in their textile arts are the embroideries which vary from region to region. Those of [[Kalotaszeg]] in Transylvania are charming products of Oriental design, sewn chiefly in a single color&nbsp;\u2013 red, blue, or black. Soft in line, the embroideries are applied on altar cloths, pillow-cases and sheets.\n\nIn Hungary proper, S\u00e1rk\u00f6z in [[Transdanubia]] and the [[Mez\u0151k\u00f6vesd|Maty\u00f3f\u00f6ld]] in the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] produce the finest embroideries. In the [[Tolna (county)|S\u00e1rk\u00f6z]] region the women's caps show black and white designs as delicate as lace, and give evidence of the people's wonderfully subtle artistic feeling. The embroidery motifs applied to women's wear have also been transposed to tablecloths and runners suitable for modern use as wall decorations.\n\nThese vessels, made of black clay, reflect more than three hundred years of traditional Transdanubian folk patterns and shapes. No two are precisely alike, since all work is done by hand, including both the shaping and the decorating. The imprints are made by the thumb or a finger of the ceramist who makes the piece.\n\n=== Porcelain ===\n{{Main|Herend Porcelain|Zsolnay}}\nFounded in 1826, [[Herend Porcelain]] is one of the world's largest ceramic factories, specializing in luxury hand painted and gilded [[porcelain]]. In the mid-19th century it was purveyor to the [[Habsburg Dynasty]] and aristocratic customers throughout Europe. Many of its classic patterns are still in production. After the fall of communism in Hungary, the factory was privatised and is now 75% owned by its management and workers, exporting to over 60 countries of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.herend.com/ |title=Herend Porcelain Manufactory Ltd |publisher=Herend.com |accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nZsolnay Porcelain Manufacture is a Hungarian manufacturer of porcelain, pottery, ceramics, tiles and stoneware. The company introduced the eosin glazing process and pyrogranite ceramics.\nThe Zsolnay factory was established by Mikl\u00f3s Zsolnay in [[P\u00e9cs]], Hungary, to produce stoneware and ceramics in 1853. In 1863, his son, [[Vilmos Zsolnay]] (1828\u20131900) joined the company and became its manager and director after several years. He led the factory to worldwide recognition by demonstrating its innovative products at world fairs and international exhibitions, including the 1873 World Fair in Vienna, then at the 1878 World Fair in Paris, where Zsolnay received a Grand Prix.\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{See also|Hungary at the Olympics}}\n[[File:Vaterpolo Hungary vs Italy semifinal game2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hungary men's national water polo team]] is considered among the best in the world, holding the world record for Olympic golds and overall medals]]\n\n[[Hungary at the Olympics|Hungarian athletes]] have been successful contenders in the [[Olympic Games]], only ten countries have won more Olympic medals than Hungary, with a total of 498 medals ranking eighth in an [[all-time Olympic Games medal count]].

The second Angevin Hungarian king, [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]] (1342\u20131382), led many successful military campaigns from Lithuania to Southern Italy (Kingdom of Naples), and was also [[King of Poland]] from 1370. After King Louis died without a male heir, the country was stabilized only when [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxembourg]] (1387\u20131437) succeeded to the throne, who in 1433 also became [[Holy Roman Emperor]].

During the rule of K\u00e1rolyi's pacifist cabinet, Hungary lost the control over approx. 75% of its former pre-WW1 territories (325 411&nbsp;km\u00b2) without fight and was subject to foreign occupation. The [[Little Entente]], sensing an opportunity, invaded the country from three sides\u2014Romania [[Hungarian-Romanian War|invaded]] [[Transylvania]], Czechoslovakia annexed [[Upper Hungary]] (today's Slovakia), and a joint [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serb]]-[[French Army|French]] coalition annexed [[Vojvodina]] and other southern regions. In March 1919, communists led by [[B\u00e9la Kun]] ousted the K\u00e1rolyi government and proclaimed the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] (''Tan\u00e1csk\u00f6zt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g''), followed by a thorough [[Red Terror (Hungary)|Red Terror]] campaign. Despite some successes on the Czechoslovak front, Kun's forces were ultimately unable to resist the Romanian invasion; by August 1919, Romanian troops occupied Budapest and ousted Kun.\n\n[[File:Portraits de Mikl\u00f3s Horthy.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]], Regent of the Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131944)]]\n\nIn November 1919, rightist forces led by former Austro-Hungarian admiral [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]] entered Budapest; exhausted by the war and its aftermath, the populace accepted Horthy's leadership. In January 1920, parliamentary elections were held and Horthy was proclaimed Regent of the reestablished [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Kingdom of Hungary]], inaugurating the so-called \"Horthy era\" (''Horthy-kor''). The new government worked quickly to normalize foreign relations while turning a blind eye to a [[White Terror (Hungary)|White Terror]] that swept through the countryside; extrajudicial killings of suspected communists and Jews lasted well into 1920. On 4 June of that year, the [[Treaty of Trianon]] established new borders for Hungary.

Though free elections continued, Horthy's personality, and those of his personally selected prime ministers, dominated the political scene. The government's actions continued to drift right with the passage of antisemitic laws and, due to the continued isolation of the Little Entente, economic and then political gravitation toward [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. The [[Great Depression]] further exacerbated the situation and the popularity of fascist politicians such as [[Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s]] and [[Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi]], promising economic and social recovery, rose.\n\nHorthy's nationalist agenda reached its apogee in 1938 and 1940, when the Nazis rewarded Hungary's staunchly pro-Germany foreign policy in the [[First Vienna Award|First]] and [[Second Vienna Award]]s, respectively, peacefully restoring ethnic-Hungarian-majority areas lost after Trianon.

His government's policies of militarization, industrialization, collectivization, and war compensation led to a severe decline in living standards. In imitation of Stalin's [[KGB]], the R\u00e1kosi government established a secret political police, the [[State Protection Authority|\u00c1VH]], to enforce the new regime.

The following political cooling saw the ascent of [[Imre Nagy]] to the premiership, and the growing interest of students and intellectuals in political life. Nagy promised market liberalization and political openness, while R\u00e1kosi opposed both vigorously. R\u00e1kosi eventually managed to discredit Nagy and replace him with the more hard-line [[Ern\u0151 Ger\u0151]]. Hungary joined the [[Warsaw Pact]] in May 1955, as societal dissatisfaction with the regime swelled. Following the firing on peaceful demonstrations by Soviet soldiers and secret police, and rallies throughout the country on 23 October 1956, protesters took to the streets in Budapest, initiating the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Revolution]]. In an effort to quell the chaos, Nagy returned as premier, promised free elections, and took Hungary out of the Warsaw Pact.\n\nThe violence nonetheless continued as revolutionary militias sprung up against the Soviet Army and the \u00c1VH; the roughly 3,000-strong resistance fought Soviet tanks using [[Molotov cocktail]]s and machine-pistols. Though the preponderance of the Soviets was immense, they suffered heavy losses, and by 30 October 1956 most Soviet troops had withdrawn from Budapest to garrison the countryside. For a time, the Soviet leadership was unsure how to respond to developments in Hungary, but eventually decided to intervene to prevent a destabilization of the Soviet bloc. On 4 November reinforcements of more than 150,000 troops and 2,500 tanks entered the country from the Soviet Union.<ref>Findley, Carter V., and John Rothney. ''Twentieth Century World''. sixth ed. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2006. 278.</ref> Nearly 20,000 Hungarians were killed resisting the intervention, while an additional 21,600 were imprisoned afterwards for political reasons. Some 13,000 were interned and 230 brought to trial and executed. Nagy was secretly tried, found guilty, sentenced to death and executed by hanging in June 1958. Because borders were briefly opened, nearly a quarter of a million people fled the country by the time the revolution was suppressed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6065398.stm \"Hungary's 1956 brain drain\"], BBC News, 23 October 2006</ref>\n\n==== K\u00e1d\u00e1r era 1956\u20131988 ====\n{{See also|Goulash Communism}}\n[[File:J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r 1962.jpg|thumb|upright|[[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]], General Secretary of MSZMP, the [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party]] (1956\u20131988)]]\n\nAfter a second, briefer period of Soviet military occupation, [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]], Nagy's former Minister of State, was chosen by the Soviet leadership to head the new government and chair the new ruling [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist Workers' Party]] (MSzMP). K\u00e1d\u00e1r quickly normalized the situation. In 1963, the government granted a general amnesty and released the majority of those imprisoned for their active participation in the uprising. K\u00e1d\u00e1r proclaimed a new policy line, according to which the people were no longer compelled to profess loyalty to the party if they tacitly accepted the Socialist regime as a fact of life. In many speeches, he described this as, \"Those who are not against us are with us.\" K\u00e1d\u00e1r introduced new planning priorities in the economy, such as allowing farmers significant plots of private land within the collective farm system (''h\u00e1zt\u00e1ji gazd\u00e1lkod\u00e1s''). The living standard rose as consumer good and food production took precedence over military production, which was reduced to one tenth of pre-revolutionary levels.\n\nIn 1968, the [[New Economic Mechanism]] (NEM) introduced free-market elements into socialist command economy. From the 1960s through the late 1980s, Hungary was often referred to as \"[[the happiest barrack]]\" within the [[Eastern bloc]].

Although the MSzMP began [[Hungarian Round Table Talks|Round Table Talks]] with various opposition groups in March 1989, the reburial of Imre Nagy as a revolutionary martyr that June is widely considered the symbolic end of communism in Hungary. Over 100,000 people attended the Budapest ceremony without any significant government interference, and many speakers openly called for Soviet troops to leave the country. Free elections were held [[1990 Hungarian parliamentary election|in May 1990]], and the [[Hungarian Democratic Forum]], a major conservative opposition group, was elected to the head of a coalition government. [[J\u00f3zsef Antall]] became the first democratically elected Prime Minister since World War II.\n\nWith the removal of state subsidies and rapid privatization in 1991, Hungary was affected by a severe economic recession. The Antall government's austerity measures proved unpopular, and the Communist Party's legal and political heir, the [[Hungarian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], won the subsequent [[1994 Hungarian parliamentary election|1994 elections]]. This abrupt shift in the political landscape was repeated in [[1998 Hungarian parliamentary election|1998]] and [[2002 Hungarian parliamentary election|2002]]; each electoral cycle, the governing party was ousted and the erstwhile opposition elected. Like most other post-communist European states, however, Hungary broadly pursued an [[European integration|integrationist]] agenda, [[Enlargement of NATO|joining]] [[NATO]] in 1999 and the European Union [[2003 Hungarian European Union membership referendum|in 2004]]. As a NATO member, Hungary was involved in the [[Yugoslav Wars]].\n\nIn 2006, [[2006 protests in Hungary|major protests]] erupted after it was revealed that Prime Minister [[Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny]] had claimed in [[\u0150sz\u00f6d speech|a private speech]] that [[Hungarian Socialist Party|his party]] \"lied\" to win the [[2006 Hungarian parliamentary election|recent elections]].

The common tripartite division of the country into three sections\u2014''Dun\u00e1nt\u00fal'' (\"beyond the Danube\", [[Transdanubia]]), ''[[Tisz\u00e1nt\u00fal]]'' (\"beyond the Tisza\"), and ''Duna-Tisza k\u00f6ze'' (\"between the Danube and Tisza\")\u2014is a reflection of this. The Danube flows north\u2013south right through the center of contemporary Hungary, and the entire country lies within its [[drainage basin]].\n\n[[Transdanubia]], which stretches westward from the center of the country toward Austria, is a primarily hilly region with a terrain varied by low mountains. These include the very eastern stretch of the [[Alps]], ''[[Alpokalja]]'', in the west of the country, the [[Transdanubian Mountains]] in the central region of Transdanubia, and the [[Mecsek]] Mountains and [[Vill\u00e1ny Mountains]] in the south. The highest point of the area is the \u00cdrott-k\u0151 in the Alps, at {{convert|882|m|0}}. The [[Little Hungarian Plain]] (''Kisalf\u00f6ld'') is found in northern Transdanubia. [[Lake Balaton]] and [[Lake H\u00e9v\u00edz]], the largest lake in Central Europe and the largest thermal lake in the world, respectively, are in Transdanubia as well.\n\nThe ''Duna-Tisza k\u00f6ze'' and ''Tisz\u00e1nt\u00fal'' are characterized mainly by the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] (''Alf\u00f6ld''), which stretches across most of the eastern and southeastern areas of the country. To the north of the Plain are the foothills of the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] in a wide band near the [[Slovakia]]n border.

According to popular opinion and many scientists, the country became drier in recent decades, as droughts have become quite common. Summers became hotter and winters became milder. For these reasons, snow has become much rarer than before. Popular opinion also states that the four-season system became a two-season system as spring and autumn are getting shorter and shorter, even vanishing some years. This supposed tendency unexpectedly was reversed in 2006 when Hungary's two main rivers, the [[Danube]] and the [[Tisza]], flooded at the same time.

The body is divided into county police departments which are also divided into regional and town police departments. The National Police also have subordinate agencies with nationwide jurisdiction, such as the \"Nemzeti Nyomoz\u00f3 Iroda\" (National Bureau of Investigation), a civilian police force specialised in investigating serious crimes, and the gendarmerie-like, militarised \"K\u00e9szenl\u00e9ti Rend\u0151rs\u00e9g\" (Stand-by Police) mainly dealing with riots and often reinforcing local police forces. Due to Hungary's accession to the [[Schengen Treaty]], the Police and Border Guards were merged into a single national corps, with the Border Guards becoming Police Officers.

Budapest, the capital, serves as an important hub for the [[Hungarian State Railways|Hungarian railway system]] (''M\u00c1V''). The capital is served by three large train stations called ''[[Eastern Railway Station (Budapest)|Keleti]]'' (Eastern), ''[[Western Railway Station (Budapest)|Nyugati]]'' (Western), and ''[[Southern Railway Station (Budapest)|D\u00e9li]]'' (Southern) ''p\u00e1lyaudvar''s.

The [[Budapest Metro]] is the second-oldest underground [[rapid transit|metro]] system in the world; its [[Line 1 (Budapest Metro)|Line 1]] dates from 1896. The system consists of four lines. A [[regional rail|commuter rail]] system, ''[[H\u00c9V]]'', operates in the Budapest metropolitan area.\nHungary has a total length of approximately {{convert|1314|km|2|abbr=on}} motorways ({{lang-hu|aut\u00f3p\u00e1lya}}). Motorway sections are being added to the existing network, which already connects many major economically important cities to the capital.\nThe most important port is Budapest. Other important ones include [[Duna\u00fajv\u00e1ros]] and [[Baja, Hungary|Baja]].\n\nThere are five international airports in Hungary: [[Budapest Liszt Ferenc International Airport|Budapest Liszt Ferenc]] (informally called \"Ferihegy\" after its previous name), [[Debrecen International Airport|Debrecen]], [[S\u00e1rmell\u00e9k International Airport|S\u00e1rmell\u00e9k]] (also called H\u00e9v\u00edz-Balaton Airport), [[Gy\u0151r-P\u00e9r International Airport|Gy\u0151r-P\u00e9r]], and [[P\u00e9cs-Pog\u00e1ny International Airport|P\u00e9cs-Pog\u00e1ny]].

Hungarian historiography identifies the foundation of the Hungarian state with [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I's]] [[baptism]] and coronation with the [[Szentkorona|Holy Crown]] in A.D. 1000. Stephen promulgated [[Roman Catholicism]] as the state religion, and his successors were traditionally known as the [[Apostolic King]]s. The [[Catholic Church in Hungary]] remained strong through the centuries, and the [[Archbishop of Esztergom]] was granted extraordinary temporal privileges as [[prince-primate]] (''hercegpr\u00edm\u00e1s'') of Hungary. \n\nAlthough contemporary Hungary has no [[official religion]] and recognizes [[freedom of religion]] as a fundamental right, the Hungarian constitution \"recognizes Christianity's nation-building role\" in its preamble<ref>{{cite web|title=Magyarorsz\u00e1g Alapt\u00f6rv\u00e9nye|url=http://www.parlament.hu/irom39/02627/02627.pdf|website=Parlament.hu|publisher=Hungarian Parliament|accessdate=2 August 2014}}</ref> and in Article VII affirms that \"the state may cooperate with the churches for community goals.\"<ref>[https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Hungary_2011.pdf Hungary's Constitution of 2011]</ref>\n\nDuring the initial stages of the [[Protestant Reformation]], most Hungarians took up, first, [[Lutheranism]], then [[Calvinism]] in the form of the [[Hungarian Reformed Church]]. In the second half of the 16th century, the [[Jesuits]] led a [[Counterreformation]] campaign and the population once again became predominantly Catholic. This campaign was only partially successful, however, and the (mainly Reformed) Hungarian nobility were able to secure freedom of worship for Christians. In practice this meant ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]''; thus, most individual localities in Hungary are still identifiable as historically Catholic, Lutheran, or Reformed. The country's eastern regions, especially around [[Debrecen]] (the \"Calvinist Rome\"), remain almost completely [[Reformed]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reformatus.hu/mutat/6819/ |title=Facts and Statistics |publisher=Reformatus.hu |date=4 March 2013 |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref> a trait they share with historically contiguous [[Hungarians in Romania|ethnically Hungarian regions]] across the Romanian border. \n\n[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] in Hungary is associated with the country's ethnic minorities:[[Armenians]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Greeks]], [[Romanians]], [[Rusyns]], [[Ukrainians]], and [[Serbs]].\n\nHistorically, Hungary was home to a significant Jewish community.

In contrast to Historicism, Hungarian Art Nouveau is based on the national architectural characteristics. Taking the eastern origins of the Hungarians into account, [[\u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner]] (1845\u20131914), the most important figure in Hungarian Art Nouveau, was initially inspired by Indian and Syrian architecture, and later by traditional Hungarian decorative designs. In this way, he created an original synthesis of architectural styles. By applying them to three-dimensional architectural elements, he produced a version of Art Nouveau that was specific to Hungary.\n\nTurning away from the style of Lechner, yet taking inspiration from his approach, the group of \"Young People\" (''Fiatalok''), which included [[K\u00e1roly K\u00f3s]] and Dezs\u00f6 Zrumeczky, were to use the characteristic structures and forms of traditional Hungarian architecture to achieve the same end.\n\n[[File:Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest).jpg|thumb|The [[Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Applied Arts]], an [[Art Nouveau]] building designed by [[\u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner]]]]\n\nBesides the two principal styles, Budapest also displays local versions of trends originating from other European countries. The Sezession from [[Vienna]], the German [[Jugendstil]], Art Nouveau from Belgium and France, and the influence of English and Finnish architecture are all reflected in the buildings constructed at the turn of the 20th century. [[B\u00e9la Lajta]] initially adopted Lechner's style, subsequently drawing his inspiration from English and Finnish trends; after developing an interest in the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] style, he finally arrived at modern architecture. [[Alad\u00e1r \u00c1rkay]] took almost the same route. [[Istv\u00e1n Medgyaszay]] developed his own style, which differed from Lechner's, using stylised traditional motifs to create decorative designs in concrete. In the sphere of applied arts, those chiefly responsible for promoting the spread of Art Nouveau were the School and Museum of Decorative Arts, which opened in 1896.\n\nForeigners have unexpectedly \"discovered\" that a significantly large portion of the citizens live in old and architecturally valuable buildings.

One of the greatest Hungarian composers, [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], was also among the most significant musicians of the 20th century.

Since then, however, the Hungarian music industry has begun to recover, producing successful performers in the fields of [[jazz]] such as trumpeter [[Rudolf Tomsits]], pianist-composer [[K\u00e1roly Binder]] and, in a modernized form of Hungarian folk, [[Ferenc Seb\u0151]] and [[M\u00e1rta Sebesty\u00e9n]].

Both are in Latin. These chronicles mix history with legends, so historically they are not always authentic. Another chronicle is the ''K\u00e9pes kr\u00f3nika'' (Illustrated Chronicle), which was written for [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]].\n[[File:K\u00e9pes Kr\u00f3nika 1360.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Chronicon Pictum]], a medieval illustrated chronicle from the 14th century]]\n[[Renaissance]] literature flourished under the reign of [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|King Matthias]] (1458\u20131490). [[Janus Pannonius]], although he wrote in Latin, counts as one of the most important persons in Hungarian literature, being the only significant Hungarian Humanist poet of the period. The first printing house was also founded during Matthias' reign, by [[Andr\u00e1s Hess]], in Buda. The first book printed in Hungary was the [[Chronica Hungarorum]].\nThe most important poets of the period was [[B\u00e1lint Balassi]] (1554\u20131594) and [[Nikola Zrinski|Mikl\u00f3s Zr\u00ednyi]] (1620\u20131664).\n\nBalassi's poetry shows medieval influences, his poems can be divided into three sections: love poems, war poems and religious poems. Zr\u00ednyi's most significant work, the epic ''[[Peril of Sziget|Szigeti veszedelem]]'' (\"Peril of Sziget\", written in 1648/49) is written in a fashion similar to the ''[[Iliad]]'', and recounts the heroic [[Battle of Szigetv\u00e1r]], where his great-grandfather died while defending the castle of Szigetv\u00e1r.\nAmong the religious literary works the most important is the Bible translation by [[G\u00e1sp\u00e1r K\u00e1roli]] (The second Hungarian Bible translation in the history), the Protestant pastor of [[G\u00f6nc]], in 1590. The translation is called the ''Bible of Vizsoly'', after the town where it was first published.

Although usually danced by young men, it can be also danced by older men. The dance is generally performed freestyle by one dancer at a time in front of a band. Women participate in the dance by standing in lines to the side, and singing or shouting verses while the men dance. Each man performs a number of points (dance phrases), typically four to eight without repetition. Each point consists of four parts, each lasting four counts. The first part is usually the same for everyone (there are only a few variations).\n\nIt was in the beginning of the 18th-century that the present style of Hungarian folk art took shape, incorporating both [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] elements, depending on the area, as well as Persian [[Sassanide]] influences. Flowers and leaves, sometimes a bird or a spiral ornament, are the principal decorative themes. The most frequent ornament is a flower with a centerpiece resembling the eye of a peacock's feather.\n\nNearly all the manifestations of folk art practiced elsewhere in Europe also flourished among the [[hungarian people|Magyar]] peasantry at one time or another, their ceramics and textile being the most highly developed of all.\n\nThe finest achievements in their textile arts are the embroideries which vary from region to region. Those of [[Kalotaszeg]] in Transylvania are charming products of Oriental design, sewn chiefly in a single color&nbsp;\u2013 red, blue, or black. Soft in line, the embroideries are applied on altar cloths, pillow-cases and sheets.\n\nIn Hungary proper, S\u00e1rk\u00f6z in [[Transdanubia]] and the [[Mez\u0151k\u00f6vesd|Maty\u00f3f\u00f6ld]] in the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] produce the finest embroideries. In the [[Tolna (county)|S\u00e1rk\u00f6z]] region the women's caps show black and white designs as delicate as lace, and give evidence of the people's wonderfully subtle artistic feeling. The embroidery motifs applied to women's wear have also been transposed to tablecloths and runners suitable for modern use as wall decorations.\n\nThese vessels, made of black clay, reflect more than three hundred years of traditional Transdanubian folk patterns and shapes.

World War{{nbsp}}II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939, with the [[Invasion of Poland|invasion]] of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of [[military campaign|campaigns]] and [[Tripartite Pact|treaties]], Germany conquered or controlled much of continental [[Europe]], and formed the Axis alliance with [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Italy]] and Japan. Under the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours, [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Poland]], [[Winter War|Finland]], [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Romania]] and the [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Baltic states]]. Following the onset of campaigns in [[Western Desert Campaign|North Africa]] and [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East Africa]], and the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] in mid 1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the [[British Empire]]. War in the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkans]], the aerial [[Battle of Britain]], the [[The Blitz|Blitz]], and the long [[Battle of the Atlantic]] followed. On 22 June 1941, the European Axis powers launched [[Operation Barbarossa|an invasion of the Soviet Union]], opening the largest land theatre of war in history. This [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] trapped the Axis, most crucially the German [[Wehrmacht]], in a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]]. In December 1941, Japan [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|launched a surprise attack]] on the [[United States]] as well as [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|European colonies]] in the Pacific. Following an immediate U.S. declaration of war against Japan, supported by one from Great Britain, the European Axis powers quickly declared war on the U.S. in solidarity with their Japanese ally. Rapid Japanese conquests over much of the Western Pacific ensued, perceived by many in Asia as liberation from Western dominance and resulting in the support of several armies from defeated territories.\n\nThe Axis advance in the Pacific halted in 1942 when Japan lost the critical [[Battle of Midway]]; later, Germany and Italy were [[Second Battle of El Alamein|defeated in North Africa]] and then, decisively, at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943, which included a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Allied invasions of Sicily]] and [[Allied invasion of Italy|Italy]], and Allied victories in the Pacific, cost the Axis its initiative and forced it into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies [[Normandy landings|invaded German-occupied France]], while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and turned toward Germany and its allies. During 1944 and 1945 the Japanese suffered major reverses in mainland Asia, in [[Battle of West Hunan|Central China]], [[Second Guangxi Campaign|South China]] and [[Burma Campaign|Burma]], while the Allies crippled the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]] and captured key Western Pacific islands.\n\nThe war in Europe concluded with an [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|invasion of Germany by the Western Allies]] and the Soviet Union, culminating in the [[Battle of Berlin|capture of Berlin]] by Soviet troops, the [[Death of Adolf Hitler|suicide of Adolf Hitler]] and the [[German Instrument of Surrender|German unconditional surrender]] on [[Victory in Europe Day|8 May 1945]]. Following the [[Potsdam Declaration]] by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender under its terms, the United States [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped atomic bombs]] on the Japanese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] on 6{{nbsp}}and 9 August respectively. With an [[Operation Downfall|invasion of the Japanese archipelago]] imminent, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, the Soviet entry into the war against Japan and its [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invasion of Manchuria]], Japan announced its intention to surrender on 15 August 1945, cementing total victory in Asia for the Allies. Tribunals were set up by the Allies, and [[war crimes]] trials were conducted in the wake of the war both [[Nuremberg Trials|against the Germans]] and [[Japanese war crimes#War crimes trials|against the Japanese]].\n\nWorld War&nbsp;II changed the political alignment and social structure of the globe. The [[United Nations]] (UN) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts; the victorious [[great power]]s\u2014China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States\u2014became the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members]] of its [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]. The Soviet Union and United States emerged as rival [[superpower]]s, setting the stage for the nearly half-century long [[Cold War]].

Meanwhile, the victorious [[Allies of World War I]], such as France, Belgium, Italy, Romania and Greece, gained territory, and new [[nation-states]] were created out of the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman and [[Russian Empire]]s.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09042, Genf, V\u00f6lkerbund, Sitzungssaal.jpg|thumb|right|The [[League of Nations]] assembly, held in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], 1930]]\n\nTo prevent a future world war, the [[League of Nations]] was created during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|1919 Paris Peace Conference]]. The organisation's primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through [[collective security]], military and [[Washington Naval Treaty|naval disarmament]], and settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration.\n\nDespite strong [[pacifist]] sentiment [[aftermath of World War I|after World War{{nbsp}}I]],{{sfn|Ingram|2006|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bREQibN9i-sC&pg=PA76 76\u201378]}} its aftermath still caused [[irredentist]] and [[revanchist]] [[nationalism]] in several European states. These sentiments were especially marked in Germany because of the significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses incurred by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 percent of its home territory and all [[German colonial empire|its overseas possessions]], while German annexation of other states was prohibited, [[World War I reparations|reparations]] were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's [[Reichswehr|armed forces]].{{sfn|Kantowicz|1999|p=149}}\n\nThe German Empire was dissolved in the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919]], and a democratic government, later known as the [[Weimar Republic]], was created. The interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the [[right-wing politics|right]] and [[left-wing politics|left]]. Italy, as an Entente ally, had made some post-war territorial gains; however, Italian nationalists were angered that the [[Treaty of London (1915)|promises made]] by the United Kingdom and France to secure Italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement. From 1922 to 1925, the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] movement led by [[Benito Mussolini]] seized power in Italy with a nationalist, [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]], and [[class collaboration]]ist agenda that abolished representative democracy, repressed socialist, left-wing and liberal forces, and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making Italy a [[world power]], promising the creation of a \"[[New Roman Empire]]\".{{sfn|Shaw|2000|p=35}}\n\n[[File:N\u00fcrnberg Reichsparteitag Hitler retouched.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Adolf Hitler]] at a German [[National Socialist]] political rally in [[Nuremberg]], August 1933]]\n\n[[Adolf Hitler]], after an [[Beer Hall Putsch|unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government]] in 1923, eventually [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|became the Chancellor of Germany]] in 1933.

The Soviet Union, concerned by [[Drang nach Osten|Germany's goals of capturing vast areas of Eastern Europe]], drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with France.

A state of [[total war]] emerged, directly involving more than 100 million people from more than 30 countries. The major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the [[war effort]], blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. World War{{nbsp}}II was the [[List of wars by death toll|deadliest conflict]] in human history, marked by [[World War II casualties|70 to 85 million fatalities]], most of whom were civilians in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|China]].

World War{{nbsp}}II is generally said to have begun on 1 September 1939, with the [[Invasion of Poland|invasion]] of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and subsequent declarations of war on Germany by [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of [[military campaign|campaigns]] and [[Tripartite Pact|treaties]], Germany conquered or controlled much of continental [[Europe]], and formed the Axis alliance with [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Italy]] and Japan. Under the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours, [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Poland]], [[Winter War|Finland]], [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Romania]] and the [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Baltic states]]. Following the onset of campaigns in [[Western Desert Campaign|North Africa]] and [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East Africa]], and the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] in mid 1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the [[British Empire]]. War in the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkans]], the aerial [[Battle of Britain]], the [[The Blitz|Blitz]], and the long [[Battle of the Atlantic]] followed. On 22 June 1941, the European Axis powers launched [[Operation Barbarossa|an invasion of the Soviet Union]], opening the largest land theatre of war in history. This [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] trapped the Axis, most crucially the German [[Wehrmacht]], in a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]]. In December 1941, Japan [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|launched a surprise attack]] on the [[United States]] as well as [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|European colonies]] in the Pacific. Following an immediate U.S. declaration of war against Japan, supported by one from Great Britain, the European Axis powers quickly declared war on the U.S. in solidarity with their Japanese ally. Rapid Japanese conquests over much of the Western Pacific ensued, perceived by many in Asia as liberation from Western dominance and resulting in the support of several armies from defeated territories.\n\nThe Axis advance in the Pacific halted in 1942 when Japan lost the critical [[Battle of Midway]]; later, Germany and Italy were [[Second Battle of El Alamein|defeated in North Africa]] and then, decisively, at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943, which included a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Allied invasions of Sicily]] and [[Allied invasion of Italy|Italy]], and Allied victories in the Pacific, cost the Axis its initiative and forced it into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies [[Normandy landings|invaded German-occupied France]], while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and turned toward Germany and its allies. During 1944 and 1945 the Japanese suffered major reverses in mainland Asia, in [[Battle of West Hunan|Central China]], [[Second Guangxi Campaign|South China]] and [[Burma Campaign|Burma]], while the Allies crippled the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]] and captured key Western Pacific islands.\n\nThe war in Europe concluded with an [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|invasion of Germany by the Western Allies]] and the Soviet Union, culminating in the [[Battle of Berlin|capture of Berlin]] by Soviet troops, the [[Death of Adolf Hitler|suicide of Adolf Hitler]] and the [[German Instrument of Surrender|German unconditional surrender]] on [[Victory in Europe Day|8 May 1945]]. Following the [[Potsdam Declaration]] by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender under its terms, the United States [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped atomic bombs]] on the Japanese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] on 6{{nbsp}}and 9 August respectively. With an [[Operation Downfall|invasion of the Japanese archipelago]] imminent, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, the Soviet entry into the war against Japan and its [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invasion of Manchuria]], Japan announced its intention to surrender on 15 August 1945, cementing total victory in Asia for the Allies. Tribunals were set up by the Allies, and [[war crimes]] trials were conducted in the wake of the war both [[Nuremberg Trials|against the Germans]] and [[Japanese war crimes#War crimes trials|against the Japanese]].\n\nWorld War&nbsp;II changed the political alignment and social structure of the globe. The [[United Nations]] (UN) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts; the victorious [[great power]]s\u2014China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States\u2014became the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members]] of its [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]. The Soviet Union and United States emerged as rival [[superpower]]s, setting the stage for the nearly half-century long [[Cold War]]. In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the [[decolonisation of Africa]] and [[Decolonisation of Asia|Asia]]. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards [[Post\u2013World War II economic expansion|economic recovery and expansion]]. Political integration, especially [[European integration|in Europe]], emerged as an effort to end pre-war enmities and create a common identity.\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n== Chronology ==\n{{See also|Timeline of World War II}}\n{{WWII timeline}}\nThe start of the war in Europe is generally held to be 1 September 1939,{{sfn|Weinberg|2005|p=6}}<ref>Wells, Anne Sharp (2014) ''Historical Dictionary of World War II: The War against Germany and Italy''.

Meanwhile, the victorious [[Allies of World War I]], such as France, Belgium, Italy, Romania and Greece, gained territory, and new [[nation-states]] were created out of the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman and [[Russian Empire]]s.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09042, Genf, V\u00f6lkerbund, Sitzungssaal.jpg|thumb|right|The [[League of Nations]] assembly, held in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], 1930]]\n\nTo prevent a future world war, the [[League of Nations]] was created during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|1919 Paris Peace Conference]]. The organisation's primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through [[collective security]], military and [[Washington Naval Treaty|naval disarmament]], and settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration.\n\nDespite strong [[pacifist]] sentiment [[aftermath of World War I|after World War{{nbsp}}I]],{{sfn|Ingram|2006|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bREQibN9i-sC&pg=PA76 76\u201378]}} its aftermath still caused [[irredentist]] and [[revanchist]] [[nationalism]] in several European states. These sentiments were especially marked in Germany because of the significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses incurred by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 percent of its home territory and all [[German colonial empire|its overseas possessions]], while German annexation of other states was prohibited, [[World War I reparations|reparations]] were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's [[Reichswehr|armed forces]].{{sfn|Kantowicz|1999|p=149}}\n\nThe German Empire was dissolved in the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919]], and a democratic government, later known as the [[Weimar Republic]], was created. The interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the [[right-wing politics|right]] and [[left-wing politics|left]]. Italy, as an Entente ally, had made some post-war territorial gains; however, Italian nationalists were angered that the [[Treaty of London (1915)|promises made]] by the United Kingdom and France to secure Italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement. From 1922 to 1925, the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] movement led by [[Benito Mussolini]] seized power in Italy with a nationalist, [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]], and [[class collaboration]]ist agenda that abolished representative democracy, repressed socialist, left-wing and liberal forces, and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making Italy a [[world power]], promising the creation of a \"[[New Roman Empire]]\".{{sfn|Shaw|2000|p=35}}\n\n[[File:N\u00fcrnberg Reichsparteitag Hitler retouched.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Adolf Hitler]] at a German [[National Socialist]] political rally in [[Nuremberg]], August 1933]]\n\n[[Adolf Hitler]], after an [[Beer Hall Putsch|unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government]] in 1923, eventually [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|became the Chancellor of Germany]] in 1933. He abolished democracy, espousing a [[New Order (Nazism)|radical, racially motivated revision of the world order]], and soon began a massive [[German re-armament|rearmament campaign]].{{sfn|Brody|1999|p=4}} Meanwhile, France, to secure its alliance, [[Franco-Italian Agreement|allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia]], which Italy desired as a colonial possession. The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Territory of the Saar Basin]] was legally reunited with Germany and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, accelerated his rearmament programme, and introduced [[conscription]].{{sfn|Zalampas|1989|p=62}}\n\nThe [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and [[Italy]] formed the [[Stresa Front]] in April 1935 in order to contain Germany, a key step towards [[military globalisation]]; however, that June, the United Kingdom made an [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement|independent naval agreement]] with Germany, easing prior restrictions. The Soviet Union, concerned by [[Drang nach Osten|Germany's goals of capturing vast areas of Eastern Europe]], drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with France. Before taking effect, though, the [[Franco-Soviet pact]] was required to go through the bureaucracy of the League of Nations, which rendered it essentially toothless.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mandelbaum|1988|p=96}}; {{Harvnb|Record|2005|p=50}}.</ref> The United States, concerned with events in Europe and Asia, passed the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Act]] in August of the same year.{{sfn|Schmitz|2000|p=124}}\n\nHitler defied the Versailles and [[Locarno treaties]] by [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarising the Rhineland]] in March 1936, encountering little opposition due to [[appeasement]].{{sfn|Adamthwaite|1992|p=52}} In October 1936, Germany and Italy formed the [[Rome\u2013Berlin Axis]].

In 1931, an [[Statism in Sh\u014dwa Japan|increasingly militaristic]] [[Empire of Japan]], which had long sought influence in China{{sfn|Myers|Peattie|1987|p=458}} as the first step of what its government saw as the country's [[Hakko ichiu|right to rule Asia]], staged the [[Mukden Incident]] as a pretext to [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invade Manchuria]] and establish the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]].{{sfn|Smith|Steadman|2004|p=28}}\n\nChina appealed to the [[League of Nations]] to stop the Japanese invasion of Manchuria.

The two nations then fought several battles, in [[28 January Incident|Shanghai]], [[Battle of Rehe|Rehe]] and [[Defense of the Great Wall|Hebei]], until the [[Tanggu Truce]] was signed in 1933.

The scene was filmed in front of a live audience at the [[Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)|Greek Theater]] in [[Los Angeles]], California.\n\n\"Shallow\" is a pivotal moment in ''A Star Is Born'', since it speaks about Ally and Jackson's conversations. Gaga wrote it from Ally's point of view with the self-aware lyrics asking each other if they are content being who they are. A [[rock music|rock]] [[sentimental ballad|power ballad]],<ref name=\"rock\"/> the song finds Gaga and Cooper trading verses and gradually moves toward the climactic final chorus with a vocal run by Gaga.

Nelson used his own band, Promise of the Real, as Jackson's band. Inspired by [[Eric Clapton]], he added a short acoustic guitar intro at the beginning of \"Shallow\", feeling it would contrast with Gaga's loud belting which follows later in the song. Gaga went to [[EastWest Studios]] to help Nelson with the track and direct the band. He recalled that with some of the instrumentation, like the cymbal crashes, they \"did that live in the studio based on the vision that we had\".<ref name=\"thrill\"/> As well as producing the track with Gaga, Benjamin Rice recorded it at EastWest and The Village West studios in Los Angeles, assisted by Bo Bodnar and Alex Williams.

Initially, \"Shallow\" was an end credits song, but when the script changed it became a love song about Jackson and Ally. Seeing the first trailer for the film, Ronson decided not to refine the track anymore and kept it as the final mix. For Gaga, the conversational nature of the lyrics helped to set up Shallow's [[aria]], which she recorded with a [[falsetto]] voice.
