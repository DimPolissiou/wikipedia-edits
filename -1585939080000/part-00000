Founded in 1850 by the [[Christian Connection]], the college began operating in 1852 as a non-sectarian institution; politician and education reformer [[Horace Mann]] became its first president. It was the founding, constituent college of [[Antioch University (system)|Antioch University System]], which Antioch College remained a part of from 1978 until 2008 when it closed. Thereafter, a group of alumni formed a new Ohio corporation, Antioch College Continuation Corporation, and bought from the University both the physical campus and a license to use the name \"Antioch College\".  The college remained closed for three years before reopening in 2011 as an independent institution.\n\nAntioch is one of only a few liberal-arts institutions in the United States featuring a [[cooperative education]] work program mandatory for all students. Democracy and shared governance, especially as a means to activism and [[social justice]], are at the heart of the college.<ref>{{cite magazine\n |title=Old College Try?

In the late 60s, as the administration added satellite centers across the country, the college adopted an academic program in Yellow Springs that gave students unprecedented independence in choosing their coursework. Then it doubled enrollment, to 2,000.\n\nIn 1973 the Nixon Administration threatened to cut federal aid. Financial-aid and New Directions students and activists demanded that Antioch guarantee their aid. On April 20, protesters barricaded the administration building and locked other buildings, shutting down the college for six weeks. Vandalism was extensive. The shutdown ended when county sheriffs came on campus to enforce a judge\u2019s injunction against the strike. That year\u2019s graduates received their diplomas by mail.\n\nThe strike and its notoriety resulted in many students transferring and a sharp decline in applications and enrollment that continued until the college's closing in 2008.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ysnews.com/old/stories/2003/november/112003_HistFront.html|title=\u201cStudent Strike Divided Antioch College Campus,\u201d Nov. 20, 2003.|last=|first=|date=|work=Yellow Springs News|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n====Birenbaum years====\nAfter consideration of 337 candidates, [[William Birenbaum]] was chosen as president of Antioch College in April 1976.

Citing the challenges of serving as both the college and University president, Guskin presided over the change to what he described as a federal model, wherein Antioch College became one of the campuses comprising Antioch University, which newly had its own central administration.  Guskin served as the university's first chancellor,  while James E. Crowfoot became the first president of solely Antioch College since Birenbaum.

Academic questions in their formal sense have not loomed large, and the magazine\u2019s policy of refusing to run footnotes is, in fact, a statement about the non- (rather than anti-) academic nature of the journal. Academics by the score have contributed, but always within a [[belles-lettres]] or journalistic tradition. So the magazine was open to both [[Malcolm Bradbury]] and [[Eric Bentley]], sans footnotes. The ''Antioch Review'' has always avoided narrow academic debates and tried to suggest that although professors may be for the academy, their commentaries can bear on larger social and intellectual processes.

Thereafter, a group of alumni formed a new Ohio corporation, Antioch College Continuation Corporation, and bought from the University both the physical campus and a license to use the name \"Antioch College\".  The college remained closed for three years before reopening in 2011 as an independent institution.\n\nAntioch is one of only a few liberal-arts institutions in the United States featuring a [[cooperative education]] work program mandatory for all students.

Citing the challenges of serving as both the college and University president, Guskin presided over the change to what he described as a federal model, wherein Antioch College became one of the campuses comprising Antioch University, which newly had its own central administration.  Guskin served as the university's first chancellor,  while James E. Crowfoot became the first president of solely Antioch College since Birenbaum.   Antioch College's enrollment figures never surpassed 1,000 students but the campus underwent renovations and buildings that had been boarded up were repaired and reopened, including South Hall, one of the college's three original buildings.\n\n====Sexual Offense Prevention Policy (SOPP)====\nA \"Sexual Offense Prevention Policy\" policy was initiated after two [[date rape]]s reportedly occurred on the Antioch College campus during the 1990\u201391 academic year.\n\nIn 1991 a group of students formed under the name \"[[Womyn]] of Antioch\" to address their concern that sexual offenses in general were not being taken seriously enough by the administration or some in the campus community.<ref name=SOPPAddA>{{cite news\n |title       = Antioch College Sexual Offense Prevention Policy, Addendum A\n |publisher   = Antioch College\n |url         = http://www.antioch-college.edu/Campus/sopp/adda.html\n |accessdate  = July 21, 2007\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070706201450/http://www.antioch-college.edu/Campus/sopp/adda.html\n |archivedate = July 6, 2007\n |url-status     = dead\n |df          = mdy\n}}</ref>  A \"Sexual Offense Prevention Policy,\" was created during a couple of late-night meetings in the campus Womyn's Center, as the Antioch College website commented \"this original policy was questionable.

Throughout the history of the magazine questions about race, ethnicity, sex, education, and the American experience have had a large place. Academic questions in their formal sense have not loomed large, and the magazine\u2019s policy of refusing to run footnotes is, in fact, a statement about the non- (rather than anti-) academic nature of the journal. Academics by the score have contributed, but always within a [[belles-lettres]] or journalistic tradition. So the magazine was open to both [[Malcolm Bradbury]] and [[Eric Bentley]], sans footnotes. The ''Antioch Review'' has always avoided narrow academic debates and tried to suggest that although professors may be for the academy, their commentaries can bear on larger social and intellectual processes. The Review has always tried to be a forum for new writers and ideas in poetry and the short story.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://review.antiochcollege.org/about-antioch-review#sthash.lddDkWfU.dpuf|title=About the Antioch Review - Antioch Review|work=antiochcollege.org}}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of Antioch College people}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Antioch College}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.antiochcollege.edu}}\n\n{{Antioch College|state=expanded}}\n{{Colleges and universities in Ohio}}\n{{Democratic schools}}\n{{GLCA}}\n{{Global Liberal Arts Alliance}}\n{{Portal bar|Education|Schools}}\n\n[[Category:Antioch College| ]]\n[[Category:Progressive colleges]]\n[[Category:1850 establishments in Ohio]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1850]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSexual Offense Prevention Policy (SOPP):Copyedit, fixing duplicated words:policy", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioch_College"}

The argument is that biological weapons cannot be controlled: the weapon could backfire and harm the army on the offensive, perhaps having even worse effects than on the target. An agent like [[smallpox]] or other airborne viruses would almost certainly spread worldwide and ultimately infect the user's home country. However, this argument does not necessarily apply to bacteria. For example, [[anthrax]] can easily be controlled and even created in a garden shed; the FBI suspects it can be done for as little as $2,500 using readily available laboratory equipment.<ref>{{cite news |title=Loner Likely Sent Anthrax, FBI Says|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/EPI/bioter/lonerlikelyanthrax.html|work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=30 March 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080407193942/http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/lonerlikelyanthrax.html| archive-date= 7 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Also, using microbial methods, bacteria can be suitably modified to be effective in only a narrow environmental range, the range of the target that distinctly differs from the army on the offensive. Thus only the target might be affected adversely. The weapon may be further used to bog down an advancing army making them more vulnerable to counterattack by the defending force. Note that these concerns generally do not apply to biologically-derived toxins - while classified as biological weapons, the organism that produces them is not used on the battlefield, so they present concerns similar to [[chemical weapons]]. \n\n===Anti-personnel===\n[[File:Biohazard symbol.svg|thumb|The international [[biological hazard]] symbol]]\n\nIdeal characteristics of a biological agent to be used as a weapon against humans are high [[infectivity]], high [[virulence]], non-availability of [[vaccine]]s, and availability of an effective and efficient [[delivery system]]. Stability of the weaponized agent (ability of the agent to retain its infectivity and virulence after a prolonged period of storage) may also be desirable, particularly for military applications, and the ease of creating one is often considered.  Control of the spread of the agent may be another desired characteristic.\n\nThe primary difficulty is not the production of the biological agent, as many biological agents used in weapons can be manufactured relatively quickly, cheaply and easily. Rather, it is the weaponization, storage and delivery in an effective vehicle to a vulnerable target that pose significant problems.\n\nFor example, ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' is considered an effective agent for several reasons. First, it forms hardy [[spore]]s, perfect for dispersal aerosols. Second, this organism is not considered transmissible from person to person, and thus rarely if ever causes secondary infections. A pulmonary anthrax infection starts with ordinary [[influenza]]-like symptoms and progresses to a lethal [[hemorrhagic]] [[mediastinitis]] within 3\u20137 days, with a fatality rate that is 90% or higher in untreated patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/our_work/biological-threats-and-epidemics/fact_sheets/anthrax.html |title=Anthrax Facts &#124; UPMC Center for Health Security |publisher=Upmc-biosecurity.org |access-date=2013-09-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302063353/http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/our_work/biological-threats-and-epidemics/fact_sheets/anthrax.html |archive-date=2 March 2013 }}</ref> Finally, friendly personnel and civilians can be protected with suitable [[antibiotic]]s.\n\nAgents considered for weaponization, or known to be weaponized, include bacteria such as ''Bacillus anthracis'', ''[[Brucella]] spp.'', ''[[Burkholderia mallei]]'', ''[[Burkholderia pseudomallei]]'', ''[[Chlamydophila psittaci]]'', ''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'', ''[[Francisella tularensis]]'', some of the [[Rickettsiaceae]] (especially ''[[Rickettsia prowazekii]]'' and ''[[Rickettsia rickettsii]]''), ''[[Shigella]] spp.'', ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', and ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''. Many viral agents have been studied and/or weaponized, including some of the [[Bunyaviridae]] (especially [[Rift Valley fever|Rift Valley fever virus]]), [[Ebola]]virus, many of the [[Flaviviridae]] (especially [[Japanese encephalitis|Japanese encephalitis virus]]), [[Bolivian hemorrhagic fever|Machupo virus]], [[Marburg virus]], Variola virus, and [[Yellow fever|yellow fever virus]].

These toxins and the organisms that produce them are sometimes referred to as [[select agent]]s. In the United States, their possession, use, and transfer are regulated by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]'s Select Agent Program.\n\nThe former [[US biological warfare program]] categorized its weaponized anti-personnel bio-agents as either '''Lethal Agents''' (''Bacillus anthracis'', ''Francisella tularensis'', Botulinum toxin) or '''Incapacitating Agents''' (''Brucella suis'', ''Coxiella burnetii'', Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B).\n\n===Anti-agriculture===\n====Anti-crop/anti-vegetation/anti-fisheries====\n{{see also|United States herbicidal warfare research}}\nThe United States developed an anti-crop capability during the [[Cold War]] that used plant diseases ([[bioherbicide]]s, or [[mycoherbicide]]s) for destroying enemy agriculture. Biological weapons also target fisheries as well as water-based vegetation. It was believed that destruction of enemy agriculture on a strategic scale could thwart [[Sino-Soviet relations|Sino-Soviet]] aggression in a general war. Diseases such as [[wheat blast]] and [[rice blast]] were weaponized in aerial spray tanks and cluster bombs for delivery to enemy watersheds in agricultural regions to initiate epiphytotics (epidemics among plants). When the United States renounced its offensive biological warfare program in 1969 and 1970, the vast majority of its biological arsenal was composed of these plant diseases.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Franz|first=David|name-list-format=vanc|title=The U.S. Biological Warfare and Biological Defense Programs|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/medaspec/Ch-19electrv699.pdf|journal=Arizona University|access-date=14 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219221907/http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/medaspec/Ch-19electrv699.pdf|archive-date=19 February 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Enterotoxins and Mycotoxins were not affected by Nixon's order.\n\nThough herbicides are chemicals, they are often grouped with biological warfare and chemical warfare because they may work in a similar manner as [[biotoxin]]s or bioregulators.

[[Biological agent|Biological weapon]]s (often termed \"bio-weapons\", \"biological threat agents\", or \"bio-agents\") are living [[organism]]s or replicating entities ([[virus]]es, which are not universally considered \"alive\"). [[Entomological warfare|Entomological (insect) warfare]] is a subtype of BW. \n\nBiological warfare is distinct from [[nuclear warfare]] and [[chemical warfare]], which together with biological warfare make up NBC, the military initialism for nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare using [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] (WMDs). None of these are considered [[conventional weapons]], which are deployed primarily for their [[explosion|explosive]], [[kinetic energy|kinetic]], or [[incendiary device|incendiary]] potential.\n\nBiological weapons may be employed in various ways to gain a strategic or [[Tactic (method)|tactical]] advantage over the enemy, either by threats or by actual deployments. Like some [[chemical weapon]]s, biological weapons may also be useful as [[area denial weapon]]s. These agents may be lethal or [[Non-lethal weapon|non-lethal]], and may be targeted against a single individual, a group of people, or even an entire population. They may be developed, acquired, stockpiled or deployed by [[nation state]]s or by non-national groups.

EW may employ insects in a direct attack or as vectors to deliver a [[biological agent]], such as [[plague (disease)|plague]]. Essentially, EW exists in three varieties. One type of EW involves infecting insects with a [[pathogen]] and then dispersing the insects over target areas.<ref name=\"sunshine\">\"[http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/bk/pdf/bk10en.pdf An Introduction to Biological Weapons, Their Prohibition, and the Relationship to Biosafety] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512163809/http://www.sunshine-project.org/publications/bk/pdf/bk10en.pdf |date=12 May 2013 }}\", ''[[The Sunshine Project]]'', April 2002.

The argument is that biological weapons cannot be controlled: the weapon could backfire and harm the army on the offensive, perhaps having even worse effects than on the target. An agent like [[smallpox]] or other airborne viruses would almost certainly spread worldwide and ultimately infect the user's home country. However, this argument does not necessarily apply to bacteria. For example, [[anthrax]] can easily be controlled and even created in a garden shed; the FBI suspects it can be done for as little as $2,500 using readily available laboratory equipment.<ref>{{cite news |title=Loner Likely Sent Anthrax, FBI Says|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/EPI/bioter/lonerlikelyanthrax.html|work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=30 March 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080407193942/http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/lonerlikelyanthrax.html| archive-date= 7 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Also, using microbial methods, bacteria can be suitably modified to be effective in only a narrow environmental range, the range of the target that distinctly differs from the army on the offensive. Thus only the target might be affected adversely. The weapon may be further used to bog down an advancing army making them more vulnerable to counterattack by the defending force. Note that these concerns generally do not apply to biologically-derived toxins - while classified as biological weapons, the organism that produces them is not used on the battlefield, so they present concerns similar to [[chemical weapons]]. \n\n===Anti-personnel===\n[[File:Biohazard symbol.svg|thumb|The international [[biological hazard]] symbol]]\n\nIdeal characteristics of a biological agent to be used as a weapon against humans are high [[infectivity]], high [[virulence]], non-availability of [[vaccine]]s, and availability of an effective and efficient [[delivery system]]. Stability of the weaponized agent (ability of the agent to retain its infectivity and virulence after a prolonged period of storage) may also be desirable, particularly for military applications, and the ease of creating one is often considered.  Control of the spread of the agent may be another desired characteristic.\n\nThe primary difficulty is not the production of the biological agent, as many biological agents used in weapons can be manufactured relatively quickly, cheaply and easily. Rather, it is the weaponization, storage and delivery in an effective vehicle to a vulnerable target that pose significant problems.\n\nFor example, ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' is considered an effective agent for several reasons. First, it forms hardy [[spore]]s, perfect for dispersal aerosols. Second, this organism is not considered transmissible from person to person, and thus rarely if ever causes secondary infections. A pulmonary anthrax infection starts with ordinary [[influenza]]-like symptoms and progresses to a lethal [[hemorrhagic]] [[mediastinitis]] within 3\u20137 days, with a fatality rate that is 90% or higher in untreated patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/our_work/biological-threats-and-epidemics/fact_sheets/anthrax.html |title=Anthrax Facts &#124; UPMC Center for Health Security |publisher=Upmc-biosecurity.org |access-date=2013-09-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302063353/http://www.upmc-biosecurity.org/website/our_work/biological-threats-and-epidemics/fact_sheets/anthrax.html |archive-date=2 March 2013 }}</ref> Finally, friendly personnel and civilians can be protected with suitable [[antibiotic]]s.\n\nAgents considered for weaponization, or known to be weaponized, include bacteria such as ''Bacillus anthracis'', ''[[Brucella]] spp.'', ''[[Burkholderia mallei]]'', ''[[Burkholderia pseudomallei]]'', ''[[Chlamydophila psittaci]]'', ''[[Coxiella burnetii]]'', ''[[Francisella tularensis]]'', some of the [[Rickettsiaceae]] (especially ''[[Rickettsia prowazekii]]'' and ''[[Rickettsia rickettsii]]''), ''[[Shigella]] spp.'', ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', and ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''.

These toxins and the organisms that produce them are sometimes referred to as [[select agent]]s. In the United States, their possession, use, and transfer are regulated by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]'s Select Agent Program.\n\nThe former [[US biological warfare program]] categorized its weaponized anti-personnel bio-agents as either '''Lethal Agents''' (''Bacillus anthracis'', ''Francisella tularensis'', Botulinum toxin) or '''Incapacitating Agents''' (''Brucella suis'', ''Coxiella burnetii'', Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B).\n\n===Anti-agriculture===\n====Anti-crop/anti-vegetation/anti-fisheries====\n{{see also|United States herbicidal warfare research}}\nThe United States developed an anti-crop capability during the [[Cold War]] that used plant diseases ([[bioherbicide]]s, or [[mycoherbicide]]s) for destroying enemy agriculture. Biological weapons also target fisheries as well as water-based vegetation. It was believed that destruction of enemy agriculture on a strategic scale could thwart [[Sino-Soviet relations|Sino-Soviet]] aggression in a general war. Diseases such as [[wheat blast]] and [[rice blast]] were weaponized in aerial spray tanks and cluster bombs for delivery to enemy watersheds in agricultural regions to initiate epiphytotics (epidemics among plants).

Health care providers and public health officers are among the first lines of defense. In some countries private, local, and provincial (state) capabilities are being augmented by and coordinated with federal assets, to provide layered defenses against biological weapon attacks. During the [[first Gulf War]] the United Nations activated a biological and chemical response team, [[Task Force Scorpio]], to respond to any potential use of weapons of mass destruction on civilians.\n\nThe traditional approach toward protecting agriculture, food, and water: focusing on the natural or unintentional introduction of a disease is being strengthened by focused efforts to address current and anticipated future biological weapons threats that may be deliberate, multiple, and repetitive.\n\nThe growing threat of biowarfare agents and bioterrorism has led to the development of specific field tools that perform on-the-spot analysis and identification of encountered suspect materials. One such technology, being developed by researchers from the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL), employs a \"sandwich immunoassay\", in which fluorescent dye-labeled antibodies aimed at specific [[pathogen]]s are attached to silver and gold nanowires.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news74433040.html|title=Physorg.com, \"Encoded Metallic Nanowires Reveal Bioweapons\", 12:50 EST, 10 August 2006.|access-date=24 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605231844/http://www.physorg.com/news74433040.html|archive-date=5 June 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], the company [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research|TNO]] has designed [[BiosparQ|Bioaerosol Single Particle Recognition eQuipment]] (BiosparQ).

In between, the race consisted of two stages suitable for [[Sprinter (cycling)|sprinters]], one for [[puncheur]]s and two for [[Climber (cycling)|climbers]]. The key stage of the race was stage 5, which involved a summit finish on [[Monte Terminillo]]. The defending champion from the [[2014 Tirreno\u2013Adriatico|2014 edition]] was [[Alberto Contador]] ({{Ct|TTS|2015}}), who was expected to be challenged by three of the strongest stage racers in the world, [[Nairo Quintana]] ({{Ct|MOV|2015}}), [[Vincenzo Nibali]] ({{Ct|AST|2015}}) and [[Chris Froome]] ({{Ct|SKY|2015}}). Froome, however, pulled out shortly before the race.\n\nThe first individual time trial was won by [[Adriano Malori]] ({{Ct|MOV|2015|nolink = y}}), who kept the lead for the first two stages. [[Greg Van Avermaet]] ({{Ct|BMC|2015}}) and [[Wout Poels]] ({{Ct|SKY|2015|nolink = y}}) won the next two stages, each taking the race lead for one day. The queen stage to Monte Terminillo was won by Quintana, who took the overall lead and was able to defend it to the end of the race. [[Bauke Mollema]] ({{Ct|TFR|2015}}) finished second, 18 seconds behind Quintana, with [[Rigoberto Ur\u00e1n]] ({{Ct|EQS|2015}}) third.\n\n[[Peter Sagan]] ({{Ct|TTS|2015|nolink = y}}) won the points classification, after he won one stage and finished in the top ten on three others. The mountains classification was won by [[Carlos Quintero (cyclist)|Carlos Quintero]] ({{Ct|COL|2015}}), while Nairo Quintana won the young riders classification as well as the overall race victory.\n\n== Teams ==\nAs Tirreno-Adriatico is a UCI World Tour event, all 17 [[List of 2015 UCI WorldTeams and riders|UCI WorldTeams]] were invited automatically and were obliged to send a squad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uci.ch/mm/Document/News/Rulesandregulation/16/82/39/2-ROA-20150619-E_English.pdf |title=UCI Cycling Regulations: Part 2: Road Races page 110 article 2.15.127 |work=[[Union Cycliste Internationale|UCI]] |accessdate=1 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702030045/http://www.uci.ch/mm/Document/News/Rulesandregulation/16/82/39/2-ROA-20150619-E_English.pdf |archivedate=2 July 2015 }}</ref> Five [[UCI Professional Continental|Professional Continental]] teams received wildcard invitations.<ref>{{cite news | date=19 January 2015 | first1=Gregor | last1=Brown | url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/racing/giro-ditalia/giro-ditalia-2015-wildcards-announced-ccc-colombia-153068 | title=Giro d\u2019Italia 2015 wildcards announced: CCC in, Colombia out | work=Cycling Weekly | accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n{{cyclingteamlist|title=WorldTeams|ALM|AST|BMC|OPQ|FDJ|IAM|LAM|LTB|MOV|OGE|GRS|GIA|KAT|BEL|SKY|TTS|TFR|year=2015}}\n{{cyclingteamlist|title=Wildcard teams|CSF|TNE|EUC|MTN|COL|year=2015}}\n\n== Pre-race favourites ==\nThe key stages on the general classification were expected to be the time trials and the summit finish.<ref name=cn-route /> The race was originally expected to be the first contest of the season between the four riders expected to contest the [[2015 Tour de France|Tour de France]]: the [[2014 Tirreno\u2013Adriatico]] champion [[Alberto Contador]] ({{ct|TTS|2015}}), the [[2013 Tirreno\u2013Adriatico]] champion [[Vincenzo Nibali]] ({{ct|AST|2015}}), [[Nairo Quintana]] ({{ct|MOV|2015}}) and [[Chris Froome]] ({{ct|SKY|2015}}).

Nibali, however, had not yet shown good form in the 2015 season, while Quintana had not raced for several weeks following a crash.

Stage 4 was a difficult, mountainous stage with a downhill finish. The following day's route had a summit finish on the {{convert|16|km|0|abbr=on}} climb of [[Monte Terminillo]].

As the riders entered the final {{convert|5|km|0}}, snow began to fall. As Contador drifted back in the pack, [[Nairo Quintana]] ({{ct|MOV|2015|nolink=y}}) attacked and immediately broke clear of the pack. Contador tried to respond but was unable to take Quintana's wheel. Contador ended up in a group of about 15 riders chasing Quintana. [[Vincenzo Nibali]] ({{ct|AST|2015|nolink=yes}}) was dropped at this point, while Quintana quickly caught up to Scarponi.<ref name=\"cn-s5-report\" /><ref name=\"cw-s5\">{{cite news | url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest-news/nairo-quintana-lays-early-season-marker-with-tirreno-adriatico-stage-win-162288 | title=Nairo Quintana lays early season marker with Tirreno-Adriatico stage win | work=Cycling Weekly | date=15 March 2015 | accessdate=18 March 2015 | author=Puddicombe, Stephen}}</ref>\n\nContador twice made attacks on the chasing group, but on both occasions was unable to break free, although the race leader, [[Wout Poels]] ({{ct|SKY|2015|nolink=y}}) was dropped. [[Rigoberto Ur\u00e1n]] ({{ct|EQS|2015}}) also made an unsuccessful attack. Finally, [[Bauke Mollema]] ({{ct|TFR|2015}}) put in a successful attack and dropped the group behind. Contador did most of the work in a group of five riders, including Ur\u00e1n, [[Joaquim Rodr\u00edguez]] ({{ct|KAT|2015}}), [[Thibaut Pinot]] ({{ct|FDJ|2015}}) and [[Adam Yates (cyclist)|Adam Yates]] ({{ct|OGE|2015}}). The group did not keep up a steady pace, however, and Quintana was able to reach the finish line with a lead of 41 seconds over Mollema and 55 seconds over Contador's group. Quintana therefore moved into the lead of the overall classification, 39 seconds ahead of Mollema and over a minute ahead of Contador. Poels, meanwhile, finished 16th on the stage, 1' 37\" behind Quintana, and dropped to tenth in the general classification.<ref name=\"cn-s5-report\" /><ref name=\"cw-s5\" />\n\nAfter the stage, several riders expressed displeasure with the extreme weather conditions. [[Fabian Cancellara]] ({{ct|TFR|2015|nolink=y}}) was prominent among them, as he had been in a dispute over hot weather at the [[2015 Tour of Oman]], with [[Filippo Pozzato]] ({{ct|LAM|2015}}) and [[Luca Paolini]] ({{ct|KAT|2015|nolink=y}}) expressing similar concerns. The conditions were particularly difficult for the riders in the [[gruppetto]], as the conditions they faced in the final kilometres were significantly worse than those faced by the race leaders.

The first and most important of these was the [[general classification]]. This was calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses were awarded to the first three finishers on road stages (stages 2\u20136): the stage winner won a ten-second bonus, with six and four seconds for the second and third riders respectively. Bonus seconds were also awarded to the first three riders at intermediate sprints (three seconds for the winner of the sprint, two seconds for the rider in second and one second for the rider in third. The leader of the general classification received a blue jersey and the winner of the classification was considered the overall winner of the race.{{sfn|RCS|2015|pp=124\u2013126}}\n\nThe second classification was the [[points classification]]. On each stage of the race, points were awarded to the top 10 riders. The winner won 12 points, with 10 for the second-placed rider, 8 for the third-placed rider and then one point fewer for each place down to tenth place. Points were also awarded to the top four riders at intermediate sprints, with five points for the winner of the sprint and three, two and one points for the riders in second, third and fourth places respectively. It was originally intended that points would not be awarded on stage 1 as it was a [[team time trial]]. After this was changed to an individual time trial, however, points were awarded on the stage, on the same scale as for an intermediate sprint. The winner of the points classification was awarded a red jersey.{{sfn|RCS|2015|p=124}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Classifica Punti di Tappa + Generale|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Speciali/TirrenoAdriatico/2014/it/download/T01_Classifica_Punti_Tappa_Generale.pdf|website=gazzetta.it|publisher=RCS|accessdate=19 March 2015|date=11 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe third classification was the [[mountains classification]]. On each of the road stages there were classified climbs on the route. The first riders to the top of the climb were awarded points in the mountains classification. For most of the climbs, the first four riders won points, with five, three, two and one points respectively. More points were awarded for the two most difficult climbs of the race. These were the summit finish to [[Monte Terminillo]] on stage 5 and the Poggio San Romualdo on stage 4. On these climbs, the winner won 15 points in the classification, with the next six riders also winning points. The rider with the most points was awarded the green jersey.{{sfn|RCS|2015|p=125}}\n\nThe final classification was the young riders classification. This was based on the general classification: the highest placed rider born after 1 January 1990 was the leader of the classification and was awarded a white jersey.{{sfn|RCS|2015|p=125}}\n\n{|

[[Tirreno\u2013Adriatico]] stage race. It took place from 11 to 17 March and was the third race of the [[2015 UCI World Tour]].<ref name=\"2015Schedule\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/uci-confirm-worldtour-calendar-2015 |title=UCI confirm WorldTour Calendar 2015 |accessdate=4 January 2015 |work=Cycling News}}</ref><ref name=\"Calendar\">{{cite web |url=http://www.uci.ch/road/calendar/detail#date=20150301&view=list&categ=257&country=0&classc=0 |title=2015 UCI Calendar |accessdate=4 January 2015 |work=UCI}}</ref> The race is one of the most important races in the early part of the cycling season and is used by riders preparing both for the [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tours]] and for the [[Classics (cycling)|classics]] season.\n\nThe route of the 2015 edition started and finished with [[individual time trial]]s, one of which was rescheduled from a team time trial shortly before the race began. In between, the race consisted of two stages suitable for [[Sprinter (cycling)|sprinters]], one for [[puncheur]]s and two for [[Climber (cycling)|climbers]]. The key stage of the race was stage 5, which involved a summit finish on [[Monte Terminillo]]. The defending champion from the [[2014 Tirreno\u2013Adriatico|2014 edition]] was [[Alberto Contador]] ({{Ct|TTS|2015}}), who was expected to be challenged by three of the strongest stage racers in the world, [[Nairo Quintana]] ({{Ct|MOV|2015}}), [[Vincenzo Nibali]] ({{Ct|AST|2015}}) and [[Chris Froome]] ({{Ct|SKY|2015}}). Froome, however, pulled out shortly before the race.\n\nThe first individual time trial was won by [[Adriano Malori]] ({{Ct|MOV|2015|nolink = y}}), who kept the lead for the first two stages. [[Greg Van Avermaet]] ({{Ct|BMC|2015}}) and [[Wout Poels]] ({{Ct|SKY|2015|nolink = y}}) won the next two stages, each taking the race lead for one day. The queen stage to Monte Terminillo was won by Quintana, who took the overall lead and was able to defend it to the end of the race. [[Bauke Mollema]] ({{Ct|TFR|2015}}) finished second, 18 seconds behind Quintana, with [[Rigoberto Ur\u00e1n]] ({{Ct|EQS|2015}}) third.\n\n[[Peter Sagan]] ({{Ct|TTS|2015|nolink = y}}) won the points classification, after he won one stage and finished in the top ten on three others. The mountains classification was won by [[Carlos Quintero (cyclist)|Carlos Quintero]] ({{Ct|COL|2015}}), while Nairo Quintana won the young riders classification as well as the overall race victory.\n\n== Teams ==\nAs Tirreno-Adriatico is a UCI World Tour event, all 17 [[List of 2015 UCI WorldTeams and riders|UCI WorldTeams]] were invited automatically and were obliged to send a squad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uci.ch/mm/Document/News/Rulesandregulation/16/82/39/2-ROA-20150619-E_English.pdf |title=UCI Cycling Regulations: Part 2: Road Races page 110 article 2.15.127 |work=[[Union Cycliste Internationale|UCI]] |accessdate=1 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702030045/http://www.uci.ch/mm/Document/News/Rulesandregulation/16/82/39/2-ROA-20150619-E_English.pdf |archivedate=2 July 2015 }}</ref> Five [[UCI Professional Continental|Professional Continental]] teams received wildcard invitations.<ref>{{cite news | date=19 January 2015 | first1=Gregor | last1=Brown | url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/racing/giro-ditalia/giro-ditalia-2015-wildcards-announced-ccc-colombia-153068 | title=Giro d\u2019Italia 2015 wildcards announced: CCC in, Colombia out | work=Cycling Weekly | accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n{{cyclingteamlist|title=WorldTeams|ALM|AST|BMC|OPQ|FDJ|IAM|LAM|LTB|MOV|OGE|GRS|GIA|KAT|BEL|SKY|TTS|TFR|year=2015}}\n{{cyclingteamlist|title=Wildcard teams|CSF|TNE|EUC|MTN|COL|year=2015}}\n\n== Pre-race favourites ==\nThe key stages on the general classification were expected to be the time trials and the summit finish.<ref name=cn-route /> The race was originally expected to be the first contest of the season between the four riders expected to contest the [[2015 Tour de France|Tour de France]]: the [[2014 Tirreno\u2013Adriatico]] champion [[Alberto Contador]] ({{ct|TTS|2015}}), the [[2013 Tirreno\u2013Adriatico]] champion [[Vincenzo Nibali]] ({{ct|AST|2015}}), [[Nairo Quintana]] ({{ct|MOV|2015}}) and [[Chris Froome]] ({{ct|SKY|2015}}). Shortly before the race, however, Froome withdrew on account of a chest infection (he had also withdrawn at the last minute in 2013).<ref>{{cite news|title=Froome withdraws from Tirreno-Adriatico|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/froome-withdraws-from-tirreno-adriatico|accessdate=17 March 2015|work=Cyclingnews.com|date=10 March 2015}}</ref> Following Froome's withdrawal, Contador was seen as the main favourite for the race; he had demonstrated his form when he and Froome fought a close battle in the [[2015 Vuelta a Andaluc\u00eda|Vuelta a Andaluc\u00eda]] a weeks earlier. Nibali, however, had not yet shown good form in the 2015 season, while Quintana had not raced for several weeks following a crash. Other riders considered to have a chance in the general classification included [[Rigoberto Ur\u00e1n]] ({{ct|EQS|2015}}), [[Joaquim Rodr\u00edguez]] ({{ct|KAT|2015}}), [[Dan Martin (cyclist)|Dan Martin]] ({{ct|GRS|2015}}) and [[Thibault Pinot]] ({{ct|FDJ|2015}}).<ref name=\"vn-preview\" /><ref>{{cite news|last1=Farrand|first1=Stephen|title=Tour contenders face off in Tirenno-Adriatico|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/tirreno-adriatico-2015/preview|accessdate=17 March 2015|work=Cyclingnews.com|date=10 March 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"cw-win\">{{cite news|last1=Puddicombe|first1=Stephen|title=Tirreno-Adriatico 2015: Who will win?|url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/racing/tirreno-adriatico-2015-who-will-win-161428|accessdate=17 March 2015|work=Cycling Weekly|date=9 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nAs well as losing Froome from the general classification battle, the race also lost one of the riders expected to challenge for stage wins. [[Marcel Kittel]] ({{ct|GIA|2015}}) withdrew from the race with a virus.

Stage 3 was also unlikely to change the general classification, though it included a steep uphill finish. The key stages, however, came on the weekend. Stage 4 was a difficult, mountainous stage with a downhill finish. The following day's route had a summit finish on the {{convert|16|km|0|abbr=on}} climb of [[Monte Terminillo]]. Stage 6 was another fairly flat stage and the race ended on the Adriatic coast with another individual time trial in [[San Benedetto del Tronto]].<ref name=\"cn-route\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Stage characteristics and winners\n|-\n!Stage\n!Date\n!Course\n!Distance\n!colspan=\"2\"|Type\n!Winner\n|-\n! 1\n|align=right| 11 March\n| [[Lido di Camaiore]]\n| <s>{{convert|22.7|km|1|abbr=on}}</s><br />{{convert|5.4|km|1|abbr=on}}\n| [[File:Time Trial.svg|22px|alt=|link=]]\n| <s>[[Team time trial]]</s><br />[[Individual time trial]]\n| {{flagathlete|[[Adriano Malori]]|ITA}}\n|-\n! 2\n|align=right| 12 March\n| [[Camaiore]] to [[Cascina]]\n| {{convert|153|km|1|abbr=on}}\n| [[Image:Plainstage.svg|22px]]\n| Flat stage\n| {{flagathlete|[[Jens Debusschere]]|BEL}}\n|-\n! 3\n|align=right| 13 March\n| [[Cascina]] to [[Arezzo]]\n| {{convert|203|km|1|abbr=on}}\n| [[Image:Hillystage.svg|22px|alt=|link=]]\n| Hilly stage\n| {{flagathlete|[[Greg Van Avermaet]]|BEL}}\n|-\n! 4\n|align=right| 14 March\n| [[Arezzo|Indicatore (Arezzo)]] to [[Castelraimondo]]\n| {{convert|226|km|1|abbr=on}}\n| [[Image:Mediummountainstage.svg|22px|alt=|link=]]\n| Medium-mountain stage\n| {{flagathlete|[[Wout Poels]]|NED}}\n|-\n! 5\n|align=right| 15 March\n| [[Esanatoglia]] to [[Monte Terminillo]]\n| {{convert|196.9|km|1|abbr=on}}\n| [[Image:Mountainstage.svg|22px]]\n| Mountain stage\n| {{flagathlete|[[Nairo Quintana]]|COL}}\n|-\n! 6\n|align=right| 16 March\n| [[Rieti]] to [[Porto Sant'Elpidio]]\n| {{convert|210|km|1|abbr=on}}\n| [[Image:Hillystage.svg|22px|alt=|link=]]\n| Hilly stage\n| {{flagathlete|[[Peter Sagan]]|SVK}}\n|-\n! 7\n|align=right| 17 March\n| [[San Benedetto del Tronto]]\n| {{convert|10|km|1|abbr=on}}\n| [[File:Time Trial.svg|22px|alt=|link=]]\n| [[Individual time trial]]\n| {{flagathlete|[[Fabian Cancellara]]|SUI}}\n|}\n\n== Stages ==\n\n=== Stage 1 ===\n\n'''11 March 2015&nbsp;\u2013 [[Lido di Camaiore]], {{convert|5.4|km|1|abbr=on}} ([[Individual time trial|ITT]])'''\n\nStage 1 was originally intended to be a {{Convert|22.7|km|4 = 1|adj = on}} [[team time trial]], but bad weather (high wind and torrential rain) in the week leading up to the event made this impossible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/tirreno-adriatico-team-time-trial-replaced-with-short-individual-test|title=Tirreno-Adriatico team time trial replaced with short individual test|author=Cycling News|work=Cyclingnews.com|accessdate=9 March 2015}}</ref> The race organisers reduced the race to a {{Convert|5.7|km|4 = 1|adj = on}} [[individual time trial]]; on the day of the race, this was shortened by a further {{Convert|300|m|4 = -1}}.

Br\u00e4ndle, however, was immediately overtaken by [[Adriano Malori]] ({{Ct|MOV|2015}}), the Italian national time trial champion, who had two previous stage wins in Tirreno\u2013Adriatico time trials.

The first and most important of these was the [[general classification]]. This was calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses were awarded to the first three finishers on road stages (stages 2\u20136): the stage winner won a ten-second bonus, with six and four seconds for the second and third riders respectively. Bonus seconds were also awarded to the first three riders at intermediate sprints (three seconds for the winner of the sprint, two seconds for the rider in second and one second for the rider in third. The leader of the general classification received a blue jersey and the winner of the classification was considered the overall winner of the race.{{sfn|RCS|2015|pp=124\u2013126}}\n\nThe second classification was the [[points classification]]. On each stage of the race, points were awarded to the top 10 riders. The winner won 12 points, with 10 for the second-placed rider, 8 for the third-placed rider and then one point fewer for each place down to tenth place. Points were also awarded to the top four riders at intermediate sprints, with five points for the winner of the sprint and three, two and one points for the riders in second, third and fourth places respectively. It was originally intended that points would not be awarded on stage 1 as it was a [[team time trial]]. After this was changed to an individual time trial, however, points were awarded on the stage, on the same scale as for an intermediate sprint. The winner of the points classification was awarded a red jersey.{{sfn|RCS|2015|p=124}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Classifica Punti di Tappa + Generale|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Speciali/TirrenoAdriatico/2014/it/download/T01_Classifica_Punti_Tappa_Generale.pdf|website=gazzetta.it|publisher=RCS|accessdate=19 March 2015|date=11 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe third classification was the [[mountains classification]]. On each of the road stages there were classified climbs on the route. The first riders to the top of the climb were awarded points in the mountains classification. For most of the climbs, the first four riders won points, with five, three, two and one points respectively. More points were awarded for the two most difficult climbs of the race. These were the summit finish to [[Monte Terminillo]] on stage 5 and the Poggio San Romualdo on stage 4. On these climbs, the winner won 15 points in the classification, with the next six riders also winning points. The rider with the most points was awarded the green jersey.{{sfn|RCS|2015|p=125}}\n\nThe final classification was the young riders classification. This was based on the general classification: the highest placed rider born after 1 January 1990 was the leader of the classification and was awarded a white jersey.{{sfn|RCS|2015|p=125}}\n\n{|

In one study, centred on globalization, she found that policy makers face \"pressures to adopt a simple reading of complex issues\" and \"to depoliticise and universalize all sorts of differences\". She claims that \"all research was framed under pre-defined and generic headings, such as business case points. The partners' reports were supposed to look the same. The standardization of research occurred via vehicles such as executive summaries: 'executives only read the summaries' we were told\u201d.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/apcity/unpan003381.pdf|title=\"Doing Critical Research for the Government of Australia By Amanda Sinclair\"|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2018}}</ref> Similarly [[Colin Leys]], writing in The [[Socialist Register]], argues that executive summaries are used to present dumbed down arguments:  \"there is remarkably little adverse comment on the steep decline that has occurred since 1980 in the quality of government policy documents, whose level of argumentation and use of evidence is all too often inversely related to the quality of their presentation (in the style of corporate reports, complete with executive summaries and flashy graphics).\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.comunicazione.uniroma1.it/materiali/19.25.02_THE%20CYNICAL%20STATE.doc |title=\"The cynical state\"  by Colin Lays, Socialist Register 2006 p1-27 |access-date=14 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006080305/http://www.comunicazione.uniroma1.it/materiali/19.25.02_THE%20CYNICAL%20STATE.doc |archive-date=6 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Business plan#Presentation formats|Business plan presentation formats]]\n*[[Introduction (writing)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.iea.org/textbase/npsum/weo2009sum.pdf An executive summary of a major report by an international body]\n* [https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/153139.pdf An executive summary published by the US Department of State]\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Business documents]]\n", "text_old": "An '''executive summary''' (or '''management summary''') is a short document or section of a document produced for [[business]] purposes.

For example, members of [[Texas A&M University]] Department of Agricultural Economics observe that \"An executive summary is an initial interaction between the writers of the report and their target readers: decision makers, potential customers, and/or peers. A business leader\u2019s decision to continue reading a certain report often depends on the impression the executive summary gives.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://agecon2.tamu.edu/people/faculty/williams-gary/429/Complete%20Writing%20Guidelines.pdf|title=Texas A&M University Department of Agricultural Economics|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Criticisms ==\n\nIt has been said that, by providing an easy digest of an often complex matter, an executive summary can lead policy makers and others to overlook important issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/article.aspx?id=409|title=Murky Media|website=www.vision.org|accessdate=7 October 2018}}</ref> Prof. Amanda Sinclair of the [[University of Melbourne]] has argued that this is often an active rather than a passive process. In one study, centred on globalization, she found that policy makers face \"pressures to adopt a simple reading of complex issues\" and \"to depoliticise and universalize all sorts of differences\". She claims that \"all research was framed under pre-defined and generic headings, such as business case points. The partners' reports were supposed to look the same. The standardization of research occurred via vehicles such as executive summaries: \u201cexecutives only read the summaries\u201d we were told\u201d.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/apcity/unpan003381.pdf|title=\"Doing Critical Research for the Government of Australia By Amanda Sinclair\"|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2018}}</ref> Similarly [[Colin Leys]], writing in The [[Socialist Register]], argues that executive summaries are used to present dumbed down arguments:  \"there is remarkably little adverse comment on the steep decline that has occurred since 1980 in the quality of government policy documents, whose level of argumentation and use of evidence is all too often inversely related to the quality of their presentation (in the style of corporate reports, complete with executive summaries and flashy graphics).\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.comunicazione.uniroma1.it/materiali/19.25.02_THE%20CYNICAL%20STATE.doc |title=\"The cynical state\"  by Colin Lays, Socialist Register 2006 p1-27 |access-date=14 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006080305/http://www.comunicazione.uniroma1.it/materiali/19.25.02_THE%20CYNICAL%20STATE.doc |archive-date=6 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Business plan#Presentation formats|Business plan presentation formats]]\n*[[Introduction (writing)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.iea.org/textbase/npsum/weo2009sum.pdf An executive summary of a major report by an international body]\n* [https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/153139.pdf An executive summary published by the US Department of State]\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Business documents]]\n", "name_user": "Yy958", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCriticisms:quote within a quote", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_summary"}

Hence there are two types of scores involved: a [[raw score]] and a scaled score.\n\nThe raw score is calculated for each section based on the number of questions one answered correctly, incorrectly, or left unattempted. Candidates are given +3 points for each correct answer and -1 point for each incorrect answer. No points are given for questions that are not answered. The raw scores are then adjusted through a process called equating. Equated raw scores are then placed on a common scale or metric to ensure appropriate interpretation of the scores. This process is called scaling.\n\nThe change in the total number of questions and number of questions per section in cat merely happens, on a broader perspective there are 100 number of questions combining each section. The very first section which is the verbal ability and reading comprehension (VARC) contains 34 questions, further bifurcating 24 questions of reading comprehension and 10 questions of verbal ability, then next section is of data interpretation and logical reasoning (DILR)  which contains 32 questions and the last section is of quantitative ability (QA) which contains 34 questions making it to 100 questions in total.\n\nCAT is conducted in two sessions.\n\n===Test pattern and duration===\n\nCAT exact exam pattern changes every year.

This process is called scaling.\n\nThe change in the total number of questions and number of questions per section in cat merely happens, on a broader perspective there are 100 number of questions combining each section. The very first section which is the verbal ability and reading comprehension (VARC) contains 34 questions, further bifurcating 24 questions of reading comprehension and 10 questions of verbal ability, then next section is of data interpretation and logical reasoning (DILR)  which contains 32 questions and the last section is of quantitative aptitude (QA) which contains 34 questions making it to 100 questions in total.\n\nCAT is conducted in two sessions.\n\n===Test pattern and duration===\n\nCAT exact exam pattern changes every year.

Burial sites dating back to the [[Neolithic Age]] and the [[Bronze Age]] include the oldest known such inland site at [[Jebel Al-Buhais|Jebel Buhais]]. Known as [[Magan (civilization)|Magan]] to the [[Sumer]]ians, the area was home to a prosperous Bronze Age trading culture during the [[Umm al-Nar culture|Umm Al Nar period]], which traded between the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley]], [[Dilmun|Bahrain]] and [[Mesopotamia]] as well as [[Iran]], [[Bactria]] and the [[Levant]]. The ensuing [[Wadi Suq culture|Wadi Suq period]] and three [[Iron Age in the United Arab Emirates|Iron Ages]] saw the emergence of nomadism as well as the development of water management and irrigation systems supporting human settlement in both the coast and interior. The Islamic age of the UAE dates back to the expulsion of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanians]] and the subsequent [[Battle of Dibba]]. The UAE's long history of trade led to the emergence of [[Julfar]], in the present-day emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, as a major regional trading and maritime hub in the area. The maritime dominance of the Persian Gulf by Emirati traders led to conflicts with European powers, including the [[Portuguese Empire]] and the [[British Empire]].\n\nFollowing decades of maritime conflict, the coastal emirates became known as the [[Trucial States]] with the signing of a Perpetual Treaty of Maritime Peace with the British in 1819 (ratified in 1853 and again in 1892), which established the Trucial States as a British [[Protectorate]]. This arrangement ended with independence and the establishment of the United Arab Emirates on 2 December 1971, immediately following the British withdrawal from its treaty obligations. Six emirates joined the UAE in 1971, the seventh, Ras Al Khaimah, joined the federation on 10 February 1972.<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates|last=Heard-Bey|first=Frauke|publisher=Motivate|year=2004|isbn=9781860631672|location=|page=370}}</ref>\n\n[[Islam]] is the [[official religion]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is the official language of the UAE.

Aware of the potential for the development of natural resources such as oil, following finds in Persia (from 1908) and Mesopotamia (from 1927), a British-led oil company, the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC), showed an interest in the region. The [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (APOC, later to become British Petroleum, or BP) had a 23.75% share in IPC.

Numerous islands are found in the Persian Gulf, and the ownership of some of them has been the subject of international disputes with both Iran and Qatar.

In general, the rulers of the emirates accepted the British intervention, but in the case of boundary disputes between Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and also between Dubai and Sharjah, conflicting claims were not resolved until after the UAE became independent.

This growth is mainly due to the influx of foreign workers into the country, making the national population a minority. The UAE features a unique labour market system, in which residence in the UAE is conditional on stringent visa rules. This system is a major advantage in terms of macroeconomic stability, as labour supply adjusts quickly to demand throughout economic business cycles. This allows the Government to keep unemployment in the country on a very low level of less than 3%, and it also gives the Government more leeway in terms of macroeconomic policies \u2013 where other governments often need to make trade-offs between fighting unemployment and fighting inflation.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBetween 2014 and 2018, the accommodation and food, education, information and communication, arts and recreation, and real estate sectors overperformed in terms of growth, whereas the construction, logistics, professional services, public, and oil and gas sectors underperformed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Business and finance===\n[[File:Abu dhabi skylines 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Abu Dhabi skyline]]\nThe UAE offers businesses a strong enabling environment: stable political and macroeconomic conditions, a future-oriented Government, good general infrastructure and ICT infrastructure.

This policy makes sense in the current situation of global and regional economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Also considering the fact that exports have become the main driver of the UAE's economic growth (the contribution of international trade to GDP grew from 31% in 2017 to 33.5% in 2018, outpacing overall GDP growth for the period), and the fact that the AED is currently undervalued, a departure from this policy \u2013 and particularly the peg \u2013 would negatively affect this important part of the UAE economy in the short term. In the mid- to long term, however, the peg will become less important, as the UAE transitions to a knowledge-based economy \u2013 and becomes yet more independent from the oil and gas sector (oil is currently still being traded not in AED, but in USD). On the contrary, it will become more and more important for the Government to have monetary policy at its free disposal to target inflation, shun too heavy reliance on taxes, and avoid situations where decisions on exchange rates and interest rates contradict fiscal policy measures \u2013 as has been the case in recent years, where monetary policy has limited fiscal policy effects on economic expansion.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAccording to [[Fitch Ratings]], the decline in property sector follows risks of progressively worsening the quality of assets in possession with UAE banks, leading the economy to rougher times ahead. Even though as compared to retail and property, UAE banks fared well. The higher US interest rates followed since 2016 - which the UAE currency complies to - have boosted profitability. However, the likelihood of plunging interest rates and increasing provisioning costs on bad loans, point to difficult times ahead for the [[economy]].<ref>{{cite_web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/3d537bae-cf30-11e9-b018-ca4456540ea6|title= UAE banks prepare for rough ride ahead|accessdate=18 October 2019|website=Financial Times}}</ref>\n\nSince 2015, economic growth has been more mixed due to a number of factors impacting both demand and supply. In 2017 and 2018 growth has been positive but on a low level of 0.8 and 1.4%, respectively. To support the economy the Government is currently following an expansionary fiscal policy. However, the effects of this policy are partially offset by monetary policy, which has been contractionary. If not for the fiscal stimulus in 2018, the UAE economy would probably have contracted in that year. One of the factors responsible for slower growth has been a credit crunch, which is due to, among other factors, higher interest rates. Government debt has remained on a low level, despite high deficits in a few recent years. Risks related to government debt remain low. Inflation has been picking up in 2017 and 18. Contributing factors were the introduction of a value added tax (VAT) of 5% in 2018 as well as higher commodity prices. Despite the Government's expansionary fiscal policy and a growing economy in 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, prices have been dropping in late 2018 and 2019 owing to oversupply in some sectors of importance to consumer prices.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Oil and gas===\nThe UAE leadership has driven forward economic diversification efforts already before the oil price crash in the 1980s, and the UAE is nowadays the most diversified economy in the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa]] (MENA) region. Although the oil and gas sector does still play an important role in the UAE economy, these efforts have paid off in terms of great resilience during periods of oil price fluctuations and economic turbulence. In 2018, the oil and gas sector contributed 26% to overall GDP. The introduction of the [[Value-added tax|VAT]] has provided the Government with an additional source of income \u2013 approximately 6% of the total revenue in 2018, or 27 billion [[United Arab Emirates dirham|United Arab Emirates Dirham]] (AED) \u2013 affording its fiscal policy more independence from oil- and gas-related revenue, which constitutes about 36% of the total Government revenue. While the Government may still adjust the exact arrangement of the VAT, it is not likely that any new taxes will be introduced in the foreseeable future. Additional taxes would destroy one of the UAE's main enticements for businesses to operate in the country and put a heavy burden on the economy.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:Dubai Marina Beach Panorama.jpg|thumb|[[Dubai Marina]] Beach]]\n\nTourism acts as a growth sector for the entire UAE economy.

Burial sites dating back to the [[Neolithic Age]] and the [[Bronze Age]] include the oldest known such inland site at [[Jebel Al-Buhais|Jebel Buhais]]. Known as [[Magan (civilization)|Magan]] to the [[Sumer]]ians, the area was home to a prosperous Bronze Age trading culture during the [[Umm al-Nar culture|Umm Al Nar period]], which traded between the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley]], [[Dilmun|Bahrain]] and [[Mesopotamia]] as well as [[Iran]], [[Bactria]] and the [[Levant]]. The ensuing [[Wadi Suq culture|Wadi Suq period]] and three [[Iron Age in the United Arab Emirates|Iron Ages]] saw the emergence of nomadism as well as the development of water management and irrigation systems supporting human settlement in both the coast and interior. The Islamic age of the UAE dates back to the expulsion of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanians]] and the subsequent [[Battle of Dibba]]. The UAE's long history of trade led to the emergence of [[Julfar]], in the present-day emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, as a major regional trading and maritime hub in the area. The maritime dominance of the Persian Gulf by Emirati traders led to conflicts with European powers, including the [[Portuguese Empire]] and the [[British Empire]].\n\nFollowing decades of maritime conflict, the coastal emirates became known as the [[Trucial States]] with the signing of a Perpetual Treaty of Maritime Peace with the British in 1819 (ratified in 1853 and again in 1892), which established the Trucial States as a British [[Protectorate]]. This arrangement ended with independence and the establishment of the United Arab Emirates on 2 December 1971, immediately following the British withdrawal from its treaty obligations. Six emirates joined the UAE in 1971, the seventh, Ras Al Khaimah, joined the federation on 10 February 1972.<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates|last=Heard-Bey|first=Frauke|publisher=Motivate|year=2004|isbn=9781860631672|location=|page=370}}</ref>\n\n[[Islam]] is the [[official religion]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is the official language of the UAE.

The [[First World War]] had a severe impact on the industry, but it was the [[depression (economics)|economic depression]] of the late 1920s and early 1930s, coupled with the invention of the [[cultured pearl]], that wiped out the trade.

Aware of the potential for the development of natural resources such as oil, following finds in Persia (from 1908) and Mesopotamia (from 1927), a British-led oil company, the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC), showed an interest in the region. The [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (APOC, later to become British Petroleum, or BP) had a 23.75% share in IPC. From 1935, onshore concessions to explore for oil were granted by local rulers, with APOC signing the first one on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Ltd (PCL), an associate company of IPC.<ref>{{Cite book|title = From Pearls to Oil|last = Heard|first = David|work= Motivate|year = 2013|isbn = 9781860633119|location = UAE|pages = 41\u201342}}</ref> APOC was prevented from developing the region alone because of the restrictions of the [[Red Line Agreement]], which required it to operate through IPC. A number of options between PCL and the trucial rulers were signed, providing useful revenue for communities experiencing poverty following the collapse of the pearl trade. However, the wealth of oil which the rulers could see from the revenues accruing to surrounding countries such as Iran, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia remained elusive. The first bore holes in Abu Dhabi were drilled by IPC's operating company, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd (PDTC) at Ras Sadr in 1950, with a {{convert|13000|ft|m|abbr=off|adj=mid|-deep}} bore hole taking a year to drill and turning out dry, at the tremendous cost at the time of \u00a31 million.\n\n[[File:Mid-20th century Dubai.JPG|thumb|left|Dubai in 1950; the area in this photo shows [[Bur Dubai]] in the foreground (centered on Al-Fahidi Fort); [[Deira, Dubai|Deira]] in middle-right on the other side of the creek; and [[Al Shindagha]] (left) and [[Al Ras, Dubai|Al Ras]] (right) in the background across the creek again from Deira]]\nThe British set up a development office that helped in some small developments in the emirates.

Most of the coast consists of [[Salt pan (geology)|salt pans]] that extend far inland. The largest [[harbor|natural harbor]] is at Dubai, although other ports have been dredged at Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and elsewhere. Numerous islands are found in the Persian Gulf, and the ownership of some of them has been the subject of international disputes with both Iran and Qatar. The smaller islands, as well as many [[coral reef]]s and shifting sandbars, are a menace to navigation. Strong tides and occasional windstorms further complicate ship movements near the shore. The UAE also has a stretch of the [[Al Batinah Region|Al B\u0101\u0163inah]] coast of the Gulf of Oman, although the [[Musandam Governorate|Musandam Peninsula]], the very tip of Arabia by the Strait of Hormuz, is an [[enclave and exclave|exclave]] of Oman separated by the UAE.\n\nSouth and west of Abu Dhabi, vast, rolling [[dune|sand dunes]] merge into the Rub al-Khali (Empty Quarter) of Saudi Arabia.

About {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} to the northeast of Liwa is the [[Al Buraimi Governorate|Al-Buraimi]] oasis, which extends on both sides of the Abu Dhabi-Oman border. [[Lake Zakher]] is a [[Man-made lake|human-made lake]] near the border with Oman.\n\nPrior to withdrawing from the area in 1971, Britain delineated the internal borders among the seven emirates in order to preempt territorial disputes that might hamper formation of the federation. In general, the rulers of the emirates accepted the British intervention, but in the case of boundary disputes between Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and also between Dubai and Sharjah, conflicting claims were not resolved until after the UAE became independent. The most complicated borders were in the [[Al Hajar Mountains|Al-Hajar al-Gharbi]] Mountains, where five of the emirates contested jurisdiction over more than a dozen enclaves.\n\n===Flora and fauna===\n[[File:1501200713074 Acacia tortilis.jpg|thumb|[[Acacia]] trees growing in desert suburbs near [[Fujairah]]]]\nThe oases grow [[Phoenix dactylifera|date palms]], [[acacia]] and [[eucalyptus]] trees. In the desert, the flora is very sparse and consists of [[grasses]] and thorn bushes. The indigenous fauna had come close to extinction because of intensive hunting, which has led to a conservation program on [[Sir Bani Yas]] Island initiated by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan in the 1970s, resulting in the survival of, for example, [[Arabian Oryx]], [[Arabian camel]] and [[leopard]]s.

This growth is mainly due to the influx of foreign workers into the country, making the national population a minority. The UAE features a unique labour market system, in which residence in the UAE is conditional on stringent visa rules. This system is a major advantage in terms of macroeconomic stability, as labour supply adjusts quickly to demand throughout economic business cycles. This allows the Government to keep unemployment in the country on a very low level of less than 3%, and it also gives the Government more leeway in terms of macroeconomic policies \u2013 where other governments often need to make trade-offs between fighting unemployment and fighting inflation.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBetween 2014 and 2018, the accommodation and food, education, information and communication, arts and recreation, and real estate sectors overperformed in terms of growth, whereas the construction, logistics, professional services, public, and oil and gas sectors underperformed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Business and finance===\n[[File:Abu dhabi skylines 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Abu Dhabi skyline]]\nThe UAE offers businesses a strong enabling environment: stable political and macroeconomic conditions, a future-oriented Government, good general infrastructure and ICT infrastructure.

This policy makes sense in the current situation of global and regional economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Also considering the fact that exports have become the main driver of the UAE's economic growth (the contribution of international trade to GDP grew from 31% in 2017 to 33.5% in 2018, outpacing overall GDP growth for the period), and the fact that the AED is currently undervalued, a departure from this policy \u2013 and particularly the peg \u2013 would negatively affect this important part of the UAE economy in the short term. In the mid- to long term, however, the peg will become less important, as the UAE transitions to a knowledge-based economy \u2013 and becomes yet more independent from the oil and gas sector (oil is currently still being traded not in AED, but in USD). On the contrary, it will become more and more important for the Government to have monetary policy at its free disposal to target inflation, shun too heavy reliance on taxes, and avoid situations where decisions on exchange rates and interest rates contradict fiscal policy measures \u2013 as has been the case in recent years, where monetary policy has limited fiscal policy effects on economic expansion.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAccording to [[Fitch Ratings]], the decline in property sector follows risks of progressively worsening the quality of assets in possession with UAE banks, leading the economy to rougher times ahead. Even though as compared to retail and property, UAE banks fared well. The higher US interest rates followed since 2016 - which the UAE currency complies to - have boosted profitability. However, the likelihood of plunging interest rates and increasing provisioning costs on bad loans, point to difficult times ahead for the [[economy]].<ref>{{cite_web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/3d537bae-cf30-11e9-b018-ca4456540ea6|title= UAE banks prepare for rough ride ahead|accessdate=18 October 2019|website=Financial Times}}</ref>\n\nSince 2015, economic growth has been more mixed due to a number of factors impacting both demand and supply. In 2017 and 2018 growth has been positive but on a low level of 0.8 and 1.4%, respectively. To support the economy the Government is currently following an expansionary fiscal policy. However, the effects of this policy are partially offset by monetary policy, which has been contractionary. If not for the fiscal stimulus in 2018, the UAE economy would probably have contracted in that year. One of the factors responsible for slower growth has been a credit crunch, which is due to, among other factors, higher interest rates. Government debt has remained on a low level, despite high deficits in a few recent years. Risks related to government debt remain low. Inflation has been picking up in 2017 and 18. Contributing factors were the introduction of a value added tax (VAT) of 5% in 2018 as well as higher commodity prices. Despite the Government's expansionary fiscal policy and a growing economy in 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, prices have been dropping in late 2018 and 2019 owing to oversupply in some sectors of importance to consumer prices.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Oil and gas===\nThe UAE leadership has driven forward economic diversification efforts already before the oil price crash in the 1980s, and the UAE is nowadays the most diversified economy in the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa]] (MENA) region. Although the oil and gas sector does still play an important role in the UAE economy, these efforts have paid off in terms of great resilience during periods of oil price fluctuations and economic turbulence. In 2018, the oil and gas sector contributed 26% to overall GDP. The introduction of the [[Value-added tax|VAT]] has provided the Government with an additional source of income \u2013 approximately 6% of the total revenue in 2018, or 27 billion [[United Arab Emirates dirham|United Arab Emirates Dirham]] (AED) \u2013 affording its fiscal policy more independence from oil- and gas-related revenue, which constitutes about 36% of the total Government revenue. While the Government may still adjust the exact arrangement of the VAT, it is not likely that any new taxes will be introduced in the foreseeable future. Additional taxes would destroy one of the UAE's main enticements for businesses to operate in the country and put a heavy burden on the economy.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:Dubai Marina Beach Panorama.jpg|thumb|[[Dubai Marina]] Beach]]\n\nTourism acts as a growth sector for the entire UAE economy.
