{"title_page": "List of scooter manufacturers", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nNote there is no single fixed definition of a '''[[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooter]]''' (also known by the full name '''motor-scooter'''), but generally a smaller motorcycle with a [[step-through frame]] is considered a scooter, especially if it has a floor for the rider's feet (as opposed to straddling the vehicle like a conventional motorcycle). Other common traits of scooters can include: bodywork (so the mechanicals are not exposed like a conventional motorcycle), motors combined with the suspension or wheel (rather than attached to the frame like a conventional motorcycle), leg shields, smaller wheels than a conventional motorcycle, and an alternative to a chain drive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scooterfocus.com/what_is_a_scooter.html|title=What is a Scooter, Moped or Motorcycle?|website=www.scooterfocus.com}}</ref> \n\nScooters share traits with [[moped]]s, and some models could even be considered both a moped and a scooter. Adding to the confusion in many areas most scooters are road registered in the same category originally designed for mopeds (and usually still called \"moped\" class), leading to scooters being referred to as \"mopeds\" in such areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.carolenash.com/insidebikes/news/scooter-moped-motorcycle/|title=What is a Scooter, Moped or Motorcycle?|date=August 20, 2015|website=Carole Nash}}</ref> [[Underbone |Underbones]] also share traits with scooters, but are generally not considered scooters as they do not have a floor. \n\n==Scooter brands in production==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Therefore, one diagnostic test for cortical blindness is to first objectively verify the optic nerves and the non-cortical functions of the eyes are functioning normally. This involves confirming that patient can distinguish light/dark, and that his/her pupils dilate and contract with light exposure. Then, the patient is asked to describe something he/she would be able to recognize with normal vision. For example, the patient would be asked the following:{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n* \"How many fingers am I holding up?\"\n* \"What does that sign (on a custodian's closet, a restroom door, an exit sign) say?\"\n* \"What kind of vending machine (with a vivid picture of a well-known brand name on it) is that?\"\nPatients with cortical blindness will not be able to identify the item being questioned about at all or will not be able to provide any details other than color or perhaps general shape. This indicates that the lack of vision is neurological rather than ocular. It specifically indicates that the occipital cortex is unable to correctly process and interpret the intact input coming from the retinas.\n\n[[Fundoscopy]] should be normal in cases of cortical blindness.  Cortical blindness can be associated with visual [[hallucinations]], denial of visual loss ([[Anton\u2013Babinski syndrome]]), and the ability to perceive moving but not static objects. ([[Riddoch syndrome]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Outcome==\nThe prognosis of a patient with acquired cortical blindness depends largely on the original cause of the blindness. For instance, patients with bilateral occipital lesions have a much lower chance of recovering vision than patients who suffered a transient ischemic attack or women who experienced complications associated with eclampsia.<ref name=\"aldrich\" /><ref name=\"hadley\" /> In patients with acquired cortical blindness, a permanent complete loss of vision is rare.<ref name=\"aldrich\" /> The development of cortical blindness into the milder [[cortical visual impairment]] is a more likely outcome.<ref name=\"aldrich\" />  Furthermore, some patients regain vision completely, as is the case with transient cortical blindness associated with [[eclampsia]] and the side effects of certain anti-epilepsy drugs.\n\nRecent research by Krystel R.

Therefore, one diagnostic test for cortical blindness is to first objectively verify the optic nerves and the non-cortical functions of the eyes are functioning normally. This involves confirming that patient can distinguish light/dark, and that his/her pupils dilate and contract with light exposure. Then, the patient is asked to describe something he/she would be able to recognize with normal vision. For example, the patient would be asked the following:{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n* \"How many fingers am I holding up?\"\n* \"What does that sign (on a custodian's closet, a restroom door, an exit sign) say?\"\n* \"What kind of vending machine (with a vivid picture of a well-known brand name on it) is that?\"\nPatients with cortical blindness will not be able to identify the item being questioned about at all or will not be able to provide any details other than color or perhaps general shape. This indicates that the lack of vision is neurological rather than ocular. It specifically indicates that the occipital cortex is unable to correctly process and interpret the intact input coming from the retinas.\n\n[[Fundoscopy]] should be normal in cases of cortical blindness.  Cortical blindness can be associated with visual [[hallucinations]], denial of visual loss ([[Anton\u2013Babinski syndrome]]), and the ability to perceive moving but not static objects. ([[Riddoch syndrome]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Outcome==\nThe prognosis of a patient with acquired cortical blindness depends largely on the original cause of the blindness. For instance, patients with bilateral occipital lesions have a much lower chance of recovering vision than patients who suffered a transient ischemic attack or women who experienced complications associated with eclampsia.<ref name=\"aldrich\" /><ref name=\"hadley\" /> In patients with acquired cortical blindness, a permanent complete loss of vision is rare.<ref name=\"aldrich\" /> The development of cortical blindness into the milder [[cortical visual impairment]] is a more likely outcome.<ref name=\"aldrich\" />  Furthermore, some patients regain vision completely, as is the case with transient cortical blindness associated with [[eclampsia]] and the side effects of certain anti-epilepsy drugs.\n\nRecent research by Krystel R.

The entrance to the airport is situated in the suburb of [[Bilinga, Queensland|Bilinga]] near [[Coolangatta]]. The runway itself straddles the state border of [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]]. During summer these states are in two different time zones. The Gold Coast Airport operates on Queensland Time all year round (year-round AEST / UTC+10).\n\nFor the 2015\u201316 financial year, Gold Coast Airport exceeded 6 million passengers. It is the [[List of the busiest airports in Australia|sixth-busiest airport in Australia]], and the busiest outside a state capital, in terms of passengers, and eighth-busiest in aircraft movements.<ref name=\"dit\"/> It is also the third-fastest-growing airport in the country.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Gold Coast Airport|url=http://goldcoastairport.com.au/corporate/about-gold-coast-airport/|publisher=Gold Coast Airport|accessdate=13 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415091858/http://goldcoastairport.com.au/corporate/about-gold-coast-airport/|archive-date=15 April 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nUntil 1999 the airport was known as ''Coolangatta Airport''. This is an [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] word meaning \"Place of Good View\". It originally consisted (1936) of three grass strips with the intention of only providing an emergency landing ground for airmail aircraft transiting between Brisbane and Sydney. Passenger flights took off for the first time in 1939 using the then grassy field of the current [[Coolangatta, Queensland|Coolangatta]] site. Regular services were started by Queensland Airlines and [[Butler Air Transport]] after the Second World War. Ansett started its own services in 1950 using [[Douglas DC-3|DC-3s]], while [[Trans Australia Airlines]] did the same in 1954 using DC-3s, too, as well as [[Douglas DC-4|DC-4s]] and [[Convair]]s to link other Australian cities.<ref name=\"goldcoastairport.com.au\">{{cite web|url=http://www.goldcoastairport.com.au/gcal-history.php|title=About|publisher=Gold Coast Airport|accessdate=30 May 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906045659/http://www.goldcoastairport.com.au/gcal-history.php|archivedate=6 September 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nBy 1958 the taxiways and runways were fully paved, with the latter upgraded a decade later to allow jet operations with [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|DC-9]] and [[Lockheed L-188 Electra|L-188 Electra]] aircraft to begin. The current terminal, known as the ''[[Eric Robinson (Australian politician)|Eric Robinson]] Building'', was officially opened in 1981 by Acting Prime Minister [[Doug Anthony|Douglas Anthony]], when at the time more than 650,000 passengers were using the airport. The following year, the main runway was lengthened to {{convert|2042|m|abbr=on|0}}, thus permitting the use of [[Wide-body aircraft|wide-body jets]] by the two domestic operators [[Ansett Australia]] and Trans Australia Airlines and their [[Boeing 767]] and [[Airbus A300]] respectively on flights from Melbourne and Sydney.<ref name=\"goldcoastairport.com.au\"/>\n\nFrom 1 January 1988, the airport was managed by the [[Federal Airports Corporation]] on behalf of the Government. A decade later, on 29 May 1998, the airport was privatised via a long term lease to [[Queensland Airports Limited]] (QAL). By 1999 the company's name had changed to become Gold Coast Airport Pty Ltd (GCAPL).<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title       = Gold Coast Airport History\n |url         = http://www.goldcoastairport.com.au/gcal-history.php\n |publisher   = Gold Coast Airport, Queensland\n |accessdate  = 15 February 2008\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120319001524/http://goldcoastairport.com.au/corporate/about-gold-coast-airport/\n |archivedate = 19 March 2012\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref> \nThe airport then suffered from the collapse of Ansett in 2001, as Ansett had operated direct services from the Gold Coast to 12 Australian destinations.\n\nIn 2003 GCAPL was taken over by QAL, which today also leases and operates [[Mount Isa Airport]], [[Townsville Airport]] and Longreach Airport.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qldairports.com.au/ |title=Queensland Airports Limited |publisher=Qldairports.com.au |accessdate=30 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606181304/http://www.qldairports.com.au/ |archive-date=6 June 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDespite the name change from ''Coolangatta Airport'' to ''Gold Coast Airport'', the airport retains its original [[IATA airport code|IATA code]], [[List of airports by IATA code: O#OO|OOL]] and [[ICAO airport code|ICAO code]], YBCG. The Airport ownership remains with the [[Government of Australia]].\n\nIn 1990 the airport welcomed its first international charter service from New Zealand, and by 1999 [[Air New Zealand]] [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost]] subsidiary [[Freedom Air]] started scheduled no-frills service from [[Hamilton, New Zealand]] with [[Boeing 737]]s. In 2007 the airport celebrated the arrival of [[AirAsia X]], which began services directly to [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia, and [[Tiger Airways Australia]], which started services to Melbourne.  Subsequently, the airport has had flights from [[Air Pacific]] from [[Nadi, Fiji|Nadi]], Fiji. [[Jetstar]] to [[Tokyo]] and [[Osaka]]. Services to New Zealand increased as well, with Jetstar, Air New Zealand and [[Pacific Blue Airlines|Pacific Blue]] flying to [[Auckland]], [[Wellington]] and [[Christchurch]].

The entrance to the airport is situated in the suburb of [[Bilinga, Queensland|Bilinga]] near [[Coolangatta]]. The runway itself straddles the state border of [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]]. During summer these states are in two different time zones. The Gold Coast Airport operates on Queensland Time all year round (year-round AEST / UTC+10).\n\nFor the 2015\u201316 financial year, Gold Coast Airport exceeded 6 million passengers. It is the [[List of the busiest airports in Australia|sixth-busiest airport in Australia]], and the busiest outside a state capital, in terms of passengers, and eighth-busiest in aircraft movements.<ref name=\"dit\"/> It is also the third-fastest-growing airport in the country.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Gold Coast Airport|url=http://goldcoastairport.com.au/corporate/about-gold-coast-airport/|publisher=Gold Coast Airport|accessdate=13 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415091858/http://goldcoastairport.com.au/corporate/about-gold-coast-airport/|archive-date=15 April 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nUntil 1999 the airport was known as ''Coolangatta Airport''. This is an [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] word meaning \"Place of Good View\". It originally consisted (1936) of three grass strips with the intention of only providing an emergency landing ground for airmail aircraft transiting between Brisbane and Sydney. Passenger flights took off for the first time in 1939 using the then grassy field of the current [[Coolangatta, Queensland|Coolangatta]] site. Regular services were started by Queensland Airlines and [[Butler Air Transport]] after the Second World War. Ansett started its own services in 1950 using [[Douglas DC-3|DC-3s]], while [[Trans Australia Airlines]] did the same in 1954 using DC-3s, too, as well as [[Douglas DC-4|DC-4s]] and [[Convair]]s to link other Australian cities.<ref name=\"goldcoastairport.com.au\">{{cite web|url=http://www.goldcoastairport.com.au/gcal-history.php|title=About|publisher=Gold Coast Airport|accessdate=30 May 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906045659/http://www.goldcoastairport.com.au/gcal-history.php|archivedate=6 September 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nBy 1958 the taxiways and runways were fully paved, with the latter upgraded a decade later to allow jet operations with [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|DC-9]] and [[Lockheed L-188 Electra|L-188 Electra]] aircraft to begin. The current terminal, known as the ''[[Eric Robinson (Australian politician)|Eric Robinson]] Building'', was officially opened in 1981 by Acting Prime Minister [[Doug Anthony|Douglas Anthony]], when at the time more than 650,000 passengers were using the airport. The following year, the main runway was lengthened to {{convert|2042|m|abbr=on|0}}, thus permitting the use of [[Wide-body aircraft|wide-body jets]] by the two domestic operators [[Ansett Australia]] and Trans Australia Airlines and their [[Boeing 767]] and [[Airbus A300]] respectively on flights from Melbourne and Sydney.<ref name=\"goldcoastairport.com.au\"/>\n\nFrom 1 January 1988, the airport was managed by the [[Federal Airports Corporation]] on behalf of the Government. A decade later, on 29 May 1998, the airport was privatised via a long term lease to [[Queensland Airports Limited]] (QAL). By 1999 the company's name had changed to become Gold Coast Airport Pty Ltd (GCAPL).<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title       = Gold Coast Airport History\n |url         = http://www.goldcoastairport.com.au/gcal-history.php\n |publisher   = Gold Coast Airport, Queensland\n |accessdate  = 15 February 2008\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120319001524/http://goldcoastairport.com.au/corporate/about-gold-coast-airport/\n |archivedate = 19 March 2012\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref> \nThe airport then suffered from the collapse of Ansett in 2001, as Ansett had operated direct services from the Gold Coast to 12 Australian destinations.\n\nIn 2003 GCAPL was taken over by QAL, which today also leases and operates [[Mount Isa Airport]], [[Townsville Airport]] and Longreach Airport.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qldairports.com.au/ |title=Queensland Airports Limited |publisher=Qldairports.com.au |accessdate=30 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606181304/http://www.qldairports.com.au/ |archive-date=6 June 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDespite the name change from ''Coolangatta Airport'' to ''Gold Coast Airport'', the airport retains its original [[IATA airport code|IATA code]], [[List of airports by IATA code: O#OO|OOL]] and [[ICAO airport code|ICAO code]], YBCG. The Airport ownership remains with the [[Government of Australia]].\n\nIn 1990 the airport welcomed its first international charter service from New Zealand, and by 1999 [[Air New Zealand]] [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost]] subsidiary [[Freedom Air]] started scheduled no-frills service from [[Hamilton, New Zealand]] with [[Boeing 737]]s. In 2007 the airport celebrated the arrival of [[AirAsia X]], which began services directly to [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia, and [[Tiger Airways Australia]], which started services to Melbourne.  Subsequently, the airport has had flights from [[Air Pacific]] from [[Nadi, Fiji|Nadi]], Fiji. [[Jetstar]] to [[Tokyo]] and [[Osaka]]. Services to New Zealand increased as well, with Jetstar, Air New Zealand and [[Pacific Blue Airlines|Pacific Blue]] flying to [[Auckland]], [[Wellington]] and [[Christchurch]]. [[Airnorth]] also started services to the airport from [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], via [[Mount Isa]]. In addition, [[Virgin Australia|Virgin Blue]] announced direct services from [[Canberra]] and [[Townsville]]. This opened up connections between all three [[Queensland Airports Limited|QAL]]-owned airports \u2013 [[Mount Isa Airport]], [[Townsville Airport]] and Gold Coast Airport.\n\n2010 saw Jetstar announce the airport as its newest hub, increased services to [[Cairns]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://biztravelguru.com/blogs/airline-hotel-news/archive/2010/08/24/jetstar-increases-flights-to-cairns.aspx |title=Jetstar increases flights to Cairns \u2013 Airline-Hotel-News |publisher=Biztravelguru.com |accessdate=30 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708011727/http://biztravelguru.com/blogs/airline-hotel-news/archive/2010/08/24/jetstar-increases-flights-to-cairns.aspx |archive-date=8 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and new direct services to [[Perth]]<ref>{{cite web |author=Dale Granger |url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/business/news/jetstar-to-slash-prices-and-put-on-18-extra-flights-to-perth/story-e6frg2qu-1225906360674 |title=Jetstar to slash prices and put on 22 extra flights to Perth, Latest Business & Australian Stock market News |publisher=Perth Now |date=17 August 2010 |accessdate=30 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020202857/http://www.perthnow.com.au/business/news/jetstar-to-slash-prices-and-put-on-18-extra-flights-to-perth/story-e6frg2qu-1225906360674 |archive-date=20 October 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> (discontinued in 2013) and [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]].<ref>[http://www.aviationrecord.com/SearchResults/tabid/37/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/2724/Jetstar-to-undercut-Queenstown-fares-by-30.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821204253/http://www.aviationrecord.com/SearchResults/tabid/37/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/2724/Jetstar-to-undercut-Queenstown-fares-by-30.aspx |date=21 August 2010 }}</ref> Tiger Airways also announced their newest base at [[Avalon Airport]] in [[Geelong]], and said that services from Avalon to the Gold Coast would commence later in the year;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tigerairways.com/au/en/real_deals.php |title=Tiger Airways |publisher=Tiger Airways |accessdate=30 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530090023/http://www.tigerairways.com/au/en/real_deals.php |archive-date=30 May 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> however, services to [[Adelaide]] would be cut due to delays in receiving new aircraft which were intended for their new Avalon base.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/tiger-cuts-routes-in-profit-review/story-e6frg8zx-1225909107353 |title=Tiger cuts routes in profit review |work=The Australian |date=24 August 2010 |accessdate=30 May 2011 |first=Steve |last=Creedy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826054356/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/tiger-cuts-routes-in-profit-review/story-e6frg8zx-1225909107353 |archive-date=26 August 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn 26 October 2010 Gold Coast Airport was named the 2010 Major Airport of the Year 2010 by the Australian Airports Association (AAA).<ref>[http://www.qldairports.com.au/pdf/mediarelease/mediarelease_81-2.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105215023/http://www.qldairports.com.au/pdf/mediarelease/mediarelease_81-2.pdf |date=5 November 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\n[[File:GoldCoastAirportTerminalFromJetstarAirbus320.jpg|thumb|Eric Robinson terminal from inside an [[Airbus A320]]]]\n[[File:Interior of Gold Coast Airport terminal.jpg|thumb|Inside the newly refurbished terminal building in 2015]]\nIt is anticipated that a railway station will be constructed at the airport if the [[Gold Coast railway line|Gold Coast line]] is extended.

It would be a [[Required navigation performance]] (RNP) system rather than a traditional ILS as this would allow planes to cross the coast at [[Currumbin, Queensland|Currumbin]] rather than [[Surfers Paradise, Queensland|Surfers Paradise]] and therefore fly over fewer houses.

The act of ventriloquism is '''ventriloquizing''', and the ability to do so is commonly called in English the ability to \"throw\" one's voice.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nOriginally, ventriloquism was a religious practice.<ref>Howard, Ryan (2013). ''Punch and Judy in 19th Century America: A History and Biographical Dictionary''. McFarland. p. 101. {{ISBN|0-7864-7270-7}}</ref> The name comes from the Latin for ''to speak from the stomach'', i.e. ''venter'' (belly) and ''loqui'' (speak).<ref>{{cite book | title = The Concise Oxford English Dictionary| year = 1984|page = 1192|isbn = 0-19-861131-5}}</ref> The Greeks called this gastromancy ({{lang-el|\u03b5\u03b3\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bc\u03c5\u03b8\u03af\u03b1}}). The noises produced by the stomach were thought to be the voices of the unliving, who took up residence in the stomach of the ventriloquist. The ventriloquist would then interpret the sounds, as they were thought to be able to speak to the dead, as well as foretell the future. One of the earliest recorded group of [[prophet]]s to use this technique was the [[Pythia]], the priestess at the temple of [[Apollo]] in [[Delphi]], who acted as the conduit for the Delphic Oracle.\n\nOne of the most successful early gastromancers was Eurykles, a prophet at [[Athens]]; gastromancers came to be referred to as ''Euryklides'' in his honour.<ref name=EB11>''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'', 1911, ''Ventriloquism''.</ref> \nIn the [[Middle Ages]], it was thought to be similar to witchcraft. One of the uses was by people pretending to be mediums or those claiming to be able to cast out evil spirits, and throwing the voice added to their credibility. It was not unusual for (particularly) women doing this to be accused and burnt as witches. As [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]] led to [[Magic (illusion)|stage magic]] and [[escapology]], so ventriloquism became more of a performance art as, starting around the 19th century, it shed its mystical trappings.\n\nOther parts of the world also have a tradition of ventriloquism for ritual or religious purposes; historically there have been adepts of this practice among the [[Zulu people|Zulu]], [[Inuit]], and [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] peoples.<ref name=\"EB11\"/>\n\n===Emergence as entertainment===\n[[File:Sadlers Wells Theatre edited.jpg|thumb|left|275px|[[Sadler's Wells Theatre]] in the early 19th century, at a time when ventriloquist acts were becoming increasingly popular.]]\nThe shift from ventriloquism as manifestation of spiritual forces toward ventriloquism as entertainment happened in the eighteenth century at the [[travelling funfair]]s and market towns. An early depiction of a ventriloquist dates to 1754 in England, where [[Sir John Parnell, 1st Baronet|Sir John Parnell]] is depicted in the painting ''[[Humours of an Election|An Election Entertainment]]'' by [[William Hogarth]] as speaking via his hand.<ref>Baldini, Gabriele, and Gabriele Mandel (1967). ''L'opera completa di Hogarth pittore''. Milano: Rizzoli. p. 112. {{OCLC|958953004}}.</ref> In 1757, the Austrian Baron de Mengen performed with a small doll.<ref name=Baron>{{cite web|title=The Art of Improving the Voice and Ear|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZT1aL2-XQBgC&pg=PA40|work=Book|accessdate=24 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nBy the late 18th century, ventriloquist performances were an established form of entertainment in England, although most performers threw their voice to make it appear that it emanated from far away, rather than the modern method of using a puppet. A well-known ventriloquist of the period, Joseph Askins, who performed at the [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]] in [[London]] in the 1790s advertised his act as \"curious ad libitum Dialogues between himself and his invisible familiar, Little Tommy\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/ron/1999/v/n16/005878ar.html|title=An Other Voice: Ventriloquism in the Romantic Period|author=John A. Hodgson|publisher=Erudit}}</ref> However, other performers were beginning to incorporate dolls or puppets into their performance, notably the Irishman James Burne who \"...&nbsp;carries in his pocket, an ill-shaped doll, with a broad face, which he exhibits&nbsp;... as giving utterance to his own childish jargon,\" and Thomas Garbutt.\n\nThe entertainment came of age during the era of the [[music hall]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[vaudeville]] in the [[United States]]. George Sutton began to incorporate a puppet act into his routine at [[Nottingham]] in the 1830s, but it is [[Fred Russell (ventriloquist)|Fred Russell]] who is regarded as the father of modern ventriloquism. In 1886, he was offered a professional engagement at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] in [[London]] and took up his stage career permanently. His act, based on the cheeky-boy dummy \"Coster Joe\" that would sit in his lap and 'engage in a dialogue' with him was highly influential for the entertainment format and was adopted by the next generation of performers. (A blue plaque has been embedded in a former residence of Russell by the British Heritage Society which reads 'Fred Russell the father of ventriloquism lived here').<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rk0sX1reV30C&dq=father+of+modern+ventriloquism&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Gender and Ventriloquism in Victorian and Neo-Victorian Fiction: Passionate Puppets|author=Davies, Helen|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:EdgarBergenandCharlieMcCarthyStageDoorCanteen1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Ventriloquist [[Edgar Bergen]] and his best-known sidekick, Charlie McCarthy, in the film ''[[Stage Door Canteen (film)|Stage Door Canteen]]'' (1943)]]\nFred Russell's successful comedy team format was applied by the next generation of ventriloquists. It was taken forward by the British [[Arthur Prince (ventriloquist)|Arthur Prince]] with his dummy Sailor Jim, who became one of the highest paid entertainers on the music hall circuit, and by the Americans [[The Great Lester]], Frank Byron Jr., and [[Edgar Bergen]]. Bergen popularized the idea of the comedic ventriloquist.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Bergen, together with his favourite figure, Charlie McCarthy, hosted a radio program that was broadcast from 1937 to 1956. It was the #1 program on the nights it aired. Bergen continued performing until his death in 1978, and his popularity inspired many other famous ventriloquists who followed him, including [[Paul Winchell]], [[Jimmy Nelson (ventriloquist)|Jimmy Nelson]], [[David Strassman]], [[Jeff Dunham]], [[Terry Fator]], [[Ronn Lucas]], [[Wayland Flowers]], [[Shari Lewis]], [[Willie Tyler]], [[Jay Johnson (ventriloquist)|Jay Johnson]], [[Nina Conti]], [[Paul Zerdin]], and [[Darci Lynne]]. Another ventriloquist popular in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s was [[Se\u00f1or Wences]].\n\nThe art of ventriloquism was popularized by [[Y. K. Padhye]] in and M. M. Roy in South India, who are believed to be the pioneers of this field in India. Y. K. Padhye's son [[Ramdas Padhye]] borrowed from him and made the art popular amongst the masses through his performance on television. Ramdas Padhye's son [[Satyajit Padhye]] is also a ventriloquist. Similarly, Indusree a female ventriloquist from Bangalore has contributed a lot to the art. She performs with 3 dummies simultaneously. [[Venky Monkey]], [[Shanthakumar]], Dr. K. Rao, an Equine Veterinary Surgeon serving for a reputeed Stud Farm in Indi and Mimicry Srinivos, the disciples of M. M. Roy, popularized this art by giving shows in India and abroad in thousands of numbers. Mimicrist Srinivos, in particular, did several experiments in ventriloquism.

The act of ventriloquism is '''ventriloquizing''', and the ability to do so is commonly called in English the ability to \"throw\" one's voice.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nOriginally, ventriloquism was a religious practice.<ref>Howard, Ryan (2013). ''Punch and Judy in 19th Century America: A History and Biographical Dictionary''. McFarland. p. 101. {{ISBN|0-7864-7270-7}}</ref> The name comes from the Latin for ''to speak from the stomach'', i.e. ''venter'' (belly) and ''loqui'' (speak).<ref>{{cite book | title = The Concise Oxford English Dictionary| year = 1984|page = 1192|isbn = 0-19-861131-5}}</ref> The Greeks called this gastromancy ({{lang-el|\u03b5\u03b3\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bc\u03c5\u03b8\u03af\u03b1}}). The noises produced by the stomach were thought to be the voices of the unliving, who took up residence in the stomach of the ventriloquist. The ventriloquist would then interpret the sounds, as they were thought to be able to speak to the dead, as well as foretell the future. One of the earliest recorded group of [[prophet]]s to use this technique was the [[Pythia]], the priestess at the temple of [[Apollo]] in [[Delphi]], who acted as the conduit for the Delphic Oracle.\n\nOne of the most successful early gastromancers was Eurykles, a prophet at [[Athens]]; gastromancers came to be referred to as ''Euryklides'' in his honour.<ref name=EB11>''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'', 1911, ''Ventriloquism''.</ref> \nIn the [[Middle Ages]], it was thought to be similar to witchcraft. One of the uses was by people pretending to be mediums or those claiming to be able to cast out evil spirits, and throwing the voice added to their credibility. It was not unusual for (particularly) women doing this to be accused and burnt as witches. As [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]] led to [[Magic (illusion)|stage magic]] and [[escapology]], so ventriloquism became more of a performance art as, starting around the 19th century, it shed its mystical trappings.\n\nOther parts of the world also have a tradition of ventriloquism for ritual or religious purposes; historically there have been adepts of this practice among the [[Zulu people|Zulu]], [[Inuit]], and [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] peoples.<ref name=\"EB11\"/>\n\n===Emergence as entertainment===\n[[File:Sadlers Wells Theatre edited.jpg|thumb|left|275px|[[Sadler's Wells Theatre]] in the early 19th century, at a time when ventriloquist acts were becoming increasingly popular.]]\nThe shift from ventriloquism as manifestation of spiritual forces toward ventriloquism as entertainment happened in the eighteenth century at the [[travelling funfair]]s and market towns. An early depiction of a ventriloquist dates to 1754 in England, where [[Sir John Parnell, 1st Baronet|Sir John Parnell]] is depicted in the painting ''[[Humours of an Election|An Election Entertainment]]'' by [[William Hogarth]] as speaking via his hand.<ref>Baldini, Gabriele, and Gabriele Mandel (1967).

A well-known ventriloquist of the period, Joseph Askins, who performed at the [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]] in [[London]] in the 1790s advertised his act as \"curious ad libitum Dialogues between himself and his invisible familiar, Little Tommy\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/ron/1999/v/n16/005878ar.html|title=An Other Voice: Ventriloquism in the Romantic Period|author=John A. Hodgson|publisher=Erudit}}</ref> However, other performers were beginning to incorporate dolls or puppets into their performance, notably the Irishman James Burne who \"...&nbsp;carries in his pocket, an ill-shaped doll, with a broad face, which he exhibits&nbsp;... as giving utterance to his own childish jargon,\" and Thomas Garbutt.\n\nThe entertainment came of age during the era of the [[music hall]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[vaudeville]] in the [[United States]]. George Sutton began to incorporate a puppet act into his routine at [[Nottingham]] in the 1830s, but it is [[Fred Russell (ventriloquist)|Fred Russell]] who is regarded as the father of modern ventriloquism. In 1886, he was offered a professional engagement at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] in [[London]] and took up his stage career permanently. His act, based on the cheeky-boy dummy \"Coster Joe\" that would sit in his lap and 'engage in a dialogue' with him was highly influential for the entertainment format and was adopted by the next generation of performers. (A blue plaque has been embedded in a former residence of Russell by the British Heritage Society which reads 'Fred Russell the father of ventriloquism lived here').<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rk0sX1reV30C&dq=father+of+modern+ventriloquism&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Gender and Ventriloquism in Victorian and Neo-Victorian Fiction: Passionate Puppets|author=Davies, Helen|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:EdgarBergenandCharlieMcCarthyStageDoorCanteen1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Ventriloquist [[Edgar Bergen]] and his best-known sidekick, Charlie McCarthy, in the film ''[[Stage Door Canteen (film)|Stage Door Canteen]]'' (1943)]]\nFred Russell's successful comedy team format was applied by the next generation of ventriloquists. It was taken forward by the British [[Arthur Prince (ventriloquist)|Arthur Prince]] with his dummy Sailor Jim, who became one of the highest paid entertainers on the music hall circuit, and by the Americans [[The Great Lester]], Frank Byron Jr., and [[Edgar Bergen]]. Bergen popularized the idea of the comedic ventriloquist.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Bergen, together with his favourite figure, Charlie McCarthy, hosted a radio program that was broadcast from 1937 to 1956. It was the #1 program on the nights it aired. Bergen continued performing until his death in 1978, and his popularity inspired many other famous ventriloquists who followed him, including [[Paul Winchell]], [[Jimmy Nelson (ventriloquist)|Jimmy Nelson]], [[David Strassman]], [[Jeff Dunham]], [[Terry Fator]], [[Ronn Lucas]], [[Wayland Flowers]], [[Shari Lewis]], [[Willie Tyler]], [[Jay Johnson (ventriloquist)|Jay Johnson]], [[Nina Conti]], [[Paul Zerdin]], and [[Darci Lynne]]. Another ventriloquist popular in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s was [[Se\u00f1or Wences]].\n\nThe art of ventriloquism was popularized by [[Y. K. Padhye]] in and M. M. Roy in South India, who are believed to be the pioneers of this field in India. Y. K. Padhye's son [[Ramdas Padhye]] borrowed from him and made the art popular amongst the masses through his performance on television. Ramdas Padhye's son [[Satyajit Padhye]] is also a ventriloquist. Similarly, Indusree a female ventriloquist from Bangalore has contributed a lot to the art. She performs with 3 dummies simultaneously. [[Venky Monkey]], [[Shanthakumar]], Dr. K. Rao, an Equine Veterinary Surgeon serving for a reputeed Stud Farm in Indi and Mimicry Srinivos, the disciples of M. M. Roy, popularized this art by giving shows in India and abroad in thousands of numbers. Mimicrist Srinivos, in particular, did several experiments in ventriloquism. He has popularized this art, calling it \"Sound illusion\", which was the topic of interest pertaining to the late M M Roy.
