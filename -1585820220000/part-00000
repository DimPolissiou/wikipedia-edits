McMahon and the Tibetans then signed the document as a bilateral accord with a note attached denying China any of the rights it specified unless it signed.

(This later paved the way to the [[Sino-Indian War]] of 1962 and the boundary dispute between China and India that persists today.)\n\nIn 1938, the British finally published the Simla Convention as a bilateral accord and demanded that the Tawang monastery, located south of the McMahon Line, cease paying taxes to Lhasa.

The Tibetans reacted vigorously. The Chinese governor was killed on his way to [[Chamdo]] and his army put to flight after an action near Batang; several missionaries were also murdered, and Chinese fortunes were at a low ebb when a special commissioner called Chao Yu-fong appeared on the scene.\n\nActing with a savagery which earned him the sobriquet of \"The Butcher of Monks,\" he swept down on Batang, sacked the lamasery, pushed on to Chamdo, and in a series of victorious campaigns which brought his army to the gates of Lhasa, re-established order and reasserted Chinese domination over Tibet. In 1909 he recommended that [[Sikang]] should be constituted a separate province comprising thirty-six subprefectures with Batang as the capital. This project was not carried out until later, and then in modified form, for the Chinese Revolution of 1911 brought Chao's career to an end and he was shortly afterwards assassinated by his compatriots.\n\nThe troubled early years of the Chinese Republic saw the rebellion of most of the tributary chieftains, a number of pitched battles between Chinese and Tibetans, and many strange happenings in which tragedy, comedy, and (of course) religion all had a part to play. In 1914 Great Britain, China, and Tibet met at the conference table to try to restore peace, but this conclave broke up after failing to reach agreement on the fundamental question of the Sino-Tibetan frontier. This, since about 1918, has been recognized for practical purposes as following the course of the Upper Yangtze. In these years the Chinese had too many other preoccupations to bother about reconquering Tibet. However, things gradually quieted down, and in 1927 the province of Sikang was brought into being, but it consisted of only twenty-seven subprefectures instead of the thirty-six visualized by the man who conceived the idea. China had lost, in the course of a decade, all the territory which the Butcher had overrun.\n\nSince then Sikang has been relatively peaceful, but this short synopsis of the province's history makes it easy to understand how precarious this state of affairs is bound to be. Chinese control was little more than nominal; I was often to have first-hand experience of its ineffectiveness. In order to govern a territory of this kind it is not enough to station, in isolated villages separated from each other by many days' journey, a few unimpressive officials and a handful of ragged soldiers. The Tibetans completely disregarded the Chinese administration and obeyed only their own chiefs. One very simple fact illustrates the true status of Sikang's Chinese rulers: nobody in the province would accept Chinese currency, and the officials, unable to buy anything with their money, were forced to subsist by a process of barter.\n\nOnce you are outside the North Gate [of Dardo or [[Kangting]]], you say good-by to Chinese civilization and its amenities and you begin to lead a different kind of life altogether. Although on paper the wide territories to the north of the city form part of the Chinese provinces of [[Sikang]] and [[Tsinghai]], the real frontier between China and Tibet runs through Kangting, or perhaps just outside it.

This army was supposed to be large and modern enough to not just defend Tibet, but to also conquer surrounding regions like [[Kham]] which were inhabited by Tibetan peoples. The Tibetan Army was constantly expanded during the 13th Dalai Lama's reign,{{sfnp|Jowett|2017|pp=235, 236}} and had about 10,000 soldiers by 1936. These were adequately armed and trained infantrymen for the time, though the army almost completely lacked machine guns, artillery, planes and tanks.{{sfnp|Jowett|2017|p=246}} In addition to the regular army, Tibet also made use of great numbers of poorly armed village militias.{{sfnp|Jowett|2017|pp=240, 246}} Considering that it was usually outgunned by their opponents, the Tibetan Army performed relatively well against various Chinese warlords in the 1920s and 1930s.{{sfnp|Jowett|2017|pp=235\u2013246}} Overall, the Tibetan soldiers proved to be \"fearless and tough fighters\" during the [[Warlord Era]].{{sfnp|Jowett|2017|p=245}}\n\nDespite this, the Tibetan Army was wholly inadequate to resist the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) during the [[Battle of Chamdo|Chinese invasion]] of 1950. It consequently disintegrated and surrendered without much resistance.{{sfnp|van Schaik|2013|pp=209\u2013212}}\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n{{see also|Nepalese Chamber of Commerce, Lhasa}}\nThe [[Warlord era|division of China into military cliques]] kept China divided, and the 13th Dalai Lama ruled but his reign was marked with border conflicts with Han Chinese and Muslim warlords, which the Tibetans lost most of the time. At that time, the government of Tibet controlled all of [[\u00dc-Tsang]] (Dbus-gtsang) and western [[Kham]] (Khams), roughly coincident with the borders of the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] today. Eastern Kham, separated by the [[Yangtze River]], was under the control of Chinese warlord [[Liu Wenhui]]. The situation in Amdo ([[Qinghai]]) was more complicated, with the [[Xining]] area controlled after 1928 by the [[Hui people|Hui]] warlord [[Ma Bufang]] of the family of Muslim warlords known as the [[Ma clique]], who constantly strove to exert control over the rest of Amdo (Qinghai).  Southern Kham along with other parts of Yunnan belonged to the [[Yunnan clique]] from 1915 till 1927, then to Governor and warlord [[Long Yun|Long (Lung) Yun]] until near the end of the [[Chinese Civil War]], when [[Du Yuming]] removed him under the order of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Within territory under Chinese control, war was being waged against Tibetan rebels in Qinghai during the [[Kuomintang Pacification of Qinghai]].\n\nIn 1918, [[Lhasa]] regained control of [[Chamdo]] and western Kham. A truce set the border at the [[Yangtze River]]. At this time, the government of Tibet controlled all of \u00dc-Tsang and Kham west of the [[Yangtze River]], roughly the same borders as the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] has today. Eastern Kham was governed by local Tibetan princes of varying allegiances. [[Qinghai]] province was controlled by ethnic [[Hui people|Hui]] and pro-[[Kuomintang]] warlord [[Ma Bufang]]. In 1932 [[Qinghai\u2013Tibet War|Tibet invaded Qinghai]], attempting to capture southern parts of Qinghai province, following contention in [[Yushu City, Qinghai|Yushu]], Qinghai over a monastery in 1932. Ma Bufang's Qinghai army defeated the Tibetan armies.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, China was divided by [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] and occupied with the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|anti-Japanese war]], but never renounced its claim to sovereignty over Tibet, and made occasional attempts to assert it.\n\nIn 1932, the Muslim [[Qinghai]] and Han-Chinese [[Sichuan]] armies of the [[National Revolutionary Army]] led by Ma Bufang and Liu Wenhui defeated the [[Tibetan Army|Tibetan army]] in the [[Sino-Tibetan War]] when the 13th Dalai Lama tried to seize territory in Qinghai and Xikang.

Smith, Jr.''China's Tibet?: Autonomy Or Assimilation,'' Rowman & Littlefield, 2009 p.14</ref> Slavery did exist, for example, in places like the [[Chumbi Valley]], though British observers like [[Charles Alfred Bell|Charles Bell]] called it 'mild'.<ref>Alex McKay, (ed.) ''The History of Tibet,'' Vol. 1, Routledge 2003 p.14-</ref> and beggars (''ragyabas'') were endemic. The pre-Chinese social system however was rather complex.\n\nEstates (''shiga''), roughly similar to the English [[Manorialism|manorial system]], were granted by the state and were hereditary, though revocable. As agricultural properties they consisted of two kinds: land held by the nobility or monastic institutions (demesne land), and village land (tenement or villein land) held by the central government, though governed by district administrators. Demesne land consisted on average of one half to three quarters of an estate. Villein land belonged to the estates, but tenants normally exercised hereditary usufruct rights in exchange for fulfilling their [[corv\u00e9e]] obligations. Tibetans outside the nobility and the monastic system were classified as serfs, but two types existed and functionally were comparable to [[tenant farmers]]. Agricultural serfs, or \"small smoke\" (''d\u00fcchung'') were bound to work on estates as a corv\u00e9e obligation (''ula'') but they had title to their own plots, owned private goods, were free to move about outside the periods required for their tribute labour, and free of tax obligations. They could accrue wealth and on occasion became lenders to the estates themselves, and could sue the estate owners: village serfs (''tralpa'')were bound to their villages but only for tax and corv\u00e9e purposes, such as road transport duties (''ula''), and were only obliged to pay taxes. Half of the village serfs were man-lease serfs (''mi-bog''), meaning that they had purchased their freedom. Estate owners exercised broad rights over attached serfs, and flight or a monastic life was the only venue of relief. Yet no mechanism existed to restore escaped serfs to their estates, and no means to enforce bondage existed, though the estate lord held the right to pursue and forcibly return them to the land.\n\nAny serf who had absented himself from his estate for three years was automatically granted either commoner (''chi mi'') status or reclassified as a serf of the central government. Estate lords could transfer their subjects to other lords or rich peasants for labour, though this practice was uncommon in Tibet. Though rigid structurally, the system exhibited considerable flexibility at ground level, with peasants free of constraints from the lord of the manor in order once they had fulfilled their corv\u00e9e obligations. Historically, discontent or abuse of the system, according to Warren W. Smith, appears to have been rare.<ref>Warren W.

Outer Tibet, approximately the same area as the modern [[Tibet Autonomous Region]], would be autonomous under Chinese [[suzerainty]]. In this area, China would refrain from \"interference in the administration.\" In Inner Tibet, consisting of eastern Kham and Amdo, Lhasa would retain control of religious matters only.<ref name=\"simla1914\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties16.html|title=Tibet Justice Center \u2013 Legal Materials on Tibet \u2013 Treaties and Conventions Relating to Tibet \u2013 Convention Between Great Britain, China, and Tibet, Simla (1914) [400]|publisher=}}</ref> From 1908 until 1918 there was a Chinese garrison in Kham and the local princes were subordinate to its commander.\n\nWhen negotiations broke down over the specific boundary between Inner and Outer Tibet, the British chief negotiator [[Henry McMahon (diplomat)|Henry McMahon]] drew what has become known as the [[McMahon Line]] to delineate the Tibet-India border, amounting to the British annexation of 9,000 square kilometres of traditional Tibetan territory in southern Tibet, namely the [[Tawang district]], which corresponds to the north-west extremity of the modern Indian state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]], while recognizing Chinese [[suzerainty]] over Tibet<ref>Article 2 of the [http://tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties16.html Simla Convention]</ref> and affirming the latter's status as part of Chinese territory, with a promise from the Government of China that Tibet would not be converted into a Chinese province.<ref>Appendix of the [http://tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties16.html Simla Convention]</ref><ref>Goldstein 1989, p. 75</ref>\n\nLater Chinese governments claimed that this McMahon Line illegitimately transferred a vast amount of territory to India. The disputed territory is called Arunachal Pradesh by India and South Tibet by China. The British had already concluded agreements with local tribal leaders and set up the Northeast Frontier Tract to administer the area in 1912.\n\nThe [[Simla Convention]] was initialled by all three delegations, but was immediately rejected by Beijing because of dissatisfaction with the way the boundary between Outer and Inner Tibet was drawn. McMahon and the Tibetans then signed the document as a bilateral accord with a note attached denying China any of the rights it specified unless it signed. The British-run Government of India initially rejected McMahon's bilateral accord as incompatible with the [[Anglo-Russian Entente|1907 Anglo-Russian Convention]].<ref>Goldstein, 1989, p80</ref><ref name=\"treaty1907\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tibetjustice.org/materials/treaties/treaties12.html|title=Tibet Justice Center \u2013 Legal Materials on Tibet \u2013 Treaties and Conventions Relating to Tibet \u2013 Convention Between Great Britain and Russia (1907)[391]|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe McMahon Line was considered by the British and later the independent Indian government to be the boundary; however, the Chinese view since then has been that since China, which claimed sovereignty over Tibet, did not sign the treaty, the treaty was meaningless, and the annexation and control of parts of Arunachal Pradesh by India is illegal. (This later paved the way to the [[Sino-Indian War]] of 1962 and the boundary dispute between China and India that persists today.)\n\nIn 1938, the British finally published the Simla Convention as a bilateral accord and demanded that the Tawang monastery, located south of the McMahon Line, cease paying taxes to Lhasa.

The Tibetans reacted vigorously. The Chinese governor was killed on his way to [[Chamdo]] and his army put to flight after an action near Batang; several missionaries were also murdered, and Chinese fortunes were at a low ebb when a special commissioner called Chao Yu-fong appeared on the scene.\n\nActing with a savagery which earned him the sobriquet of \"The Butcher of Monks,\" he swept down on Batang, sacked the lamasery, pushed on to Chamdo, and in a series of victorious campaigns which brought his army to the gates of Lhasa, re-established order and reasserted Chinese domination over Tibet. In 1909 he recommended that [[Sikang]] should be constituted a separate province comprising thirty-six subprefectures with Batang as the capital. This project was not carried out until later, and then in modified form, for the Chinese Revolution of 1911 brought Chao's career to an end and he was shortly afterwards assassinated by his compatriots.\n\nThe troubled early years of the Chinese Republic saw the rebellion of most of the tributary chieftains, a number of pitched battles between Chinese and Tibetans, and many strange happenings in which tragedy, comedy, and (of course) religion all had a part to play. In 1914 Great Britain, China, and Tibet met at the conference table to try to restore peace, but this conclave broke up after failing to reach agreement on the fundamental question of the Sino-Tibetan frontier. This, since about 1918, has been recognized for practical purposes as following the course of the Upper Yangtze. In these years the Chinese had too many other preoccupations to bother about reconquering Tibet. However, things gradually quieted down, and in 1927 the province of Sikang was brought into being, but it consisted of only twenty-seven subprefectures instead of the thirty-six visualized by the man who conceived the idea. China had lost, in the course of a decade, all the territory which the Butcher had overrun.\n\nSince then Sikang has been relatively peaceful, but this short synopsis of the province's history makes it easy to understand how precarious this state of affairs is bound to be. Chinese control was little more than nominal; I was often to have first-hand experience of its ineffectiveness. In order to govern a territory of this kind it is not enough to station, in isolated villages separated from each other by many days' journey, a few unimpressive officials and a handful of ragged soldiers. The Tibetans completely disregarded the Chinese administration and obeyed only their own chiefs. One very simple fact illustrates the true status of Sikang's Chinese rulers: nobody in the province would accept Chinese currency, and the officials, unable to buy anything with their money, were forced to subsist by a process of barter.\n\nOnce you are outside the North Gate [of Dardo or [[Kangting]]], you say good-by to Chinese civilization and its amenities and you begin to lead a different kind of life altogether. Although on paper the wide territories to the north of the city form part of the Chinese provinces of [[Sikang]] and [[Tsinghai]], the real frontier between China and Tibet runs through Kangting, or perhaps just outside it.

At that time, the government of Tibet controlled all of [[\u00dc-Tsang]] (Dbus-gtsang) and western [[Kham]] (Khams), roughly coincident with the borders of the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] today. Eastern Kham, separated by the [[Yangtze River]], was under the control of Chinese warlord [[Liu Wenhui]]. The situation in Amdo ([[Qinghai]]) was more complicated, with the [[Xining]] area controlled after 1928 by the [[Hui people|Hui]] warlord [[Ma Bufang]] of the family of Muslim warlords known as the [[Ma clique]], who constantly strove to exert control over the rest of Amdo (Qinghai).  Southern Kham along with other parts of Yunnan belonged to the [[Yunnan clique]] from 1915 till 1927, then to Governor and warlord [[Long Yun|Long (Lung) Yun]] until near the end of the [[Chinese Civil War]], when [[Du Yuming]] removed him under the order of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Within territory under Chinese control, war was being waged against Tibetan rebels in Qinghai during the [[Kuomintang Pacification of Qinghai]].\n\nIn 1918, [[Lhasa]] regained control of [[Chamdo]] and western Kham. A truce set the border at the [[Yangtze River]]. At this time, the government of Tibet controlled all of \u00dc-Tsang and Kham west of the [[Yangtze River]], roughly the same borders as the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] has today. Eastern Kham was governed by local Tibetan princes of varying allegiances. [[Qinghai]] province was controlled by ethnic [[Hui people|Hui]] and pro-[[Kuomintang]] warlord [[Ma Bufang]]. In 1932 [[Qinghai\u2013Tibet War|Tibet invaded Qinghai]], attempting to capture southern parts of Qinghai province, following contention in [[Yushu City, Qinghai|Yushu]], Qinghai over a monastery in 1932.

''The History of Tibet,'' Vol. 1, Routledge 2003 p.14-</ref> and beggars (''ragyabas'') were endemic. The pre-Chinese social system however was rather complex.\n\nEstates (''shiga''), roughly similar to the English [[Manorialism|manorial system]], were granted by the state and were hereditary, though revocable. As agricultural properties they consisted of two kinds: land held by the nobility or monastic institutions (demesne land), and village land (tenement or villein land) held by the central government, though governed by district administrators. Demesne land consisted on average of one half to three quarters of an estate. Villein land belonged to the estates, but tenants normally exercised hereditary usufruct rights in exchange for fulfilling their [[corv\u00e9e]] obligations. Tibetans outside the nobility and the monastic system were classified as serfs, but two types existed and functionally were comparable to [[tenant farmers]]. Agricultural serfs, or \"small smoke\" (''d\u00fcchung'') were bound to work on estates as a corv\u00e9e obligation (''ula'') but they had title to their own plots, owned private goods, were free to move about outside the periods required for their tribute labour, and free of tax obligations. They could accrue wealth and on occasion became lenders to the estates themselves, and could sue the estate owners: village serfs (''tralpa'')were bound to their villages but only for tax and corv\u00e9e purposes, such as road transport duties (''ula''), and were only obliged to pay taxes. Half of the village serfs were man-lease serfs (''mi-bog''), meaning that they had purchased their freedom. Estate owners exercised broad rights over attached serfs, and flight or a monastic life was the only venue of relief. Yet no mechanism existed to restore escaped serfs to their estates, and no means to enforce bondage existed, though the estate lord held the right to pursue and forcibly return them to the land.\n\nAny serf who had absented himself from his estate for three years was automatically granted either commoner (''chi mi'') status or reclassified as a serf of the central government. Estate lords could transfer their subjects to other lords or rich peasants for labour, though this practice was uncommon in Tibet. Though rigid structurally, the system exhibited considerable flexibility at ground level, with peasants free of constraints from the lord of the manor in order once they had fulfilled their corv\u00e9e obligations. Historically, discontent or abuse of the system, according to Warren W. Smith, appears to have been rare.<ref>Warren W.

A [[Now You See Me 2|sequel]] was released on June 10, 2016.\n\n==Plot==\n4 [[Magic (illusion)|stage magicians]], J. Daniel Atlas ([[Jesse Eisenberg]]), Merritt McKinney ([[Woody Harrelson]]), Henley Reeves ([[Isla Fisher]]), and Jack Wilder ([[Dave Franco]]), are each given a [[tarot card]] that leads them to the same empty New York City apartment where they discover a set of blueprints and a list of instructions from an unknown benefactor.\n\nA year later, the four have their first major performance as the Four Horsemenn in an elaborate Las Vegas show funded by insurance magnate Arthur Tressler ([[Michael Caine]]). Their final trick appears to transport one of the audience members to the vault of his bank, the Cr\u00e9dit R\u00e9publicain in Paris, where stacks of new euro bills are stored. At the magicians' command, the fans in the vault activate, drawing the bills into the vents and then showering the Las Vegas crowd with them. The euros are shown to be real, and the vault in Paris is found to be empty of its recent shipment of euros. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Dylan Rhodes ([[Mark Ruffalo]]), and [[Interpol]] agent Alma Dray ([[M\u00e9lanie Laurent]]), are then partnered to investigate the Horsemen. The two question the magicians but have no evidence to hold them. Dylan and Alma turn to Thaddeus Bradley ([[Morgan Freeman]]), a former magician and now a popular video host who makes millions of dollars exposing the tricks behind magic acts. Thaddeus demonstrates how the Horsemen used a mock vault under the Las Vegas stage, and explains that the group must have stolen the money in Paris before it arrived at the bank, and replaced it with [[Nitrocellulose|flash paper]] which ignited but left no residue as evidence.\n\nDylan, Alma, and Thaddeus follow the Horsemen to their next show in New Orleans. There, their final trick appears to transfer over 140 million dollars from Tressler's private accounts to those in the audience, made up of people that were denied insurance claims by Tressler's company in the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Dylan and Alma attempt to apprehend the four, but the magicians elude arrest. Tressler hires Thaddeus to expose the Horsemen in revenge for the loss of his money. Alma investigates the Horsemen and determines they are connected to a group called the Eye, a small group of magicians that claim to have access to real magic and only accept the best of the best magicians, who have to be invited and pass tests. She finds out that one of the Eye's members, Lionel Shrike, had previously been exposed by Thaddeus, but died in a locked-safe escape trick he was performing in an attempt to regain his standing. Alma suspects a fifth person is aiding the Horsemen.\n\nDylan discovers his cellphone has been stolen and bugged by the Horsemen, allowing them to access the FBI servers and remain ahead of the investigation. Tracking the real phone leads the FBI to a New York City apartment. When they raid it, three of the Horsemen escape while Jack recovers numerous documents and then leads the authorities on a high-speed car chase. Jack loses control of his car, causing it to flip and catch fire. Dylan is unable to save Jack, but manages to recover the papers, pointing to the Horsemen's next planned crime, stealing millions of dollars in cash out of a large safe of the Elkhorn company. By the time Dylan, Alma, and Thaddeus find the safe, it had just been stolen and loaded into a truck. They quickly apprehend the truck, arrange for it to be delivered to its arranged destination, and Dylan hides inside. But when it arrives and is opened by Bradley and his assistant, it contains nothing but balloon animals, revealing it to be a decoy.\n\nThe Horsemen broadcast that they will perform their final show that night at [[5 Pointz]], inviting the public to attend. The FBI and police converge on the scene and amid the chaos search for the Horsemen. The remaining Horsemen appear to the crowd, giving their fans a farewell and a message about an ulterior purpose, and then run to jump off a roof; Dylan attempts to shoot them but Alma pushes his arm so he misses. The three Horseman jump, turning into a shower of money over the crowd. The money is counterfeit, but the audience's race to collect it prevents the authorities from tracking the real Horsemen.\n\nAfter the show, Thaddeus walks to his car, only to find it full of the money stolen from the real Elkhorn safe, which is later revealed to have never been stolen from the company but was really hidden behind a giant mirror to make it look like it was gone. Assumed to be the fifth Horseman, he is arrested. Dylan speaks to Thaddeus in jail, where Thaddeus slowly comes to realize that Alma's theory was correct, and Dylan was the fifth Horseman. Dylan quietly walks away, leaving Thaddeus shouting \"Why?\" Elsewhere, the Horsemen (including Jack, who had faked his death using a cadaver and a duplicate car) meet at the carousel in Central Park, and use their tarot cards to turn it on. Dylan arrives and welcomes the four to the Eye.\n\nLater, at the [[Pont des Arts]], Dylan meets with Alma and reveals that he is Shrike's son. He brought the Horsemen together to get retribution for his father's death; the Elkhorn Safe Company for providing a faulty safe that led to the accident; Thaddeus, for humiliating and impoverishing his father and forcing him to try the new trick to regain his standing; and the Cr\u00e9dit R\u00e9publicain and Tressler's insurance companies for failing to pay out on Shrike's life insurance. Alma, who has come into a romantic relationship with Dylan, easily decides not to turn him in. She takes a lock and a key that Dylan produces, attaches the lock among the other [[love lock]]s on the railing, and throws the key into the [[Seine]].\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], the Horsemen, driving through a desert, approach a junkyard full of old magician memorabilia, before getting out of their car and slowly beginning to examine the area before coming upon a set of locked crates covered in the symbol of the Eye, but without their playing cards to open them.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- DO NOT change the order of the cast.

The film features an [[ensemble cast]] of [[Jesse Eisenberg]], [[Mark Ruffalo]], [[Woody Harrelson]], [[Isla Fisher]], [[Dave Franco]], [[M\u00e9lanie Laurent]], [[Michael Caine]], and [[Morgan Freeman]]. The plot follows an [[FBI]] agent and an [[Interpol]] detective who track a team of magicians who pull off bank heists and robberies during their performances and reward their audiences with the money, attempting to bring them to justice. This is the first installment of a [[Now You See Me (film series)|series]].\n\nThe film premiered in [[New York City]] on May 21, 2013 before its official release in the United States on May 31, 2013 by [[Summit Entertainment]]. The film received mixed reviews from critics but became a box office success, grossing $351.7 million worldwide against a budget of $75 million. The film won the Favorite Thriller Movie at the [[40th People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Awards]] in 2014 and also received nominations for the [[Empire Award for Best Thriller]] and the [[Saturn Award]] for Best Thriller Film and [[Saturn Award for Best Music|Best Music]]. A [[Now You See Me 2|sequel]] was released on June 10, 2016.\n\n==Plot==\nFour [[Magic (illusion)|stage magicians]], J. Daniel Atlas ([[Jesse Eisenberg]]), Merritt McKinney ([[Woody Harrelson]]), Henley Reeves ([[Isla Fisher]]), and Jack Wilder ([[Dave Franco]]), are each given a [[tarot card]] that leads them to the same empty New York City apartment where they discover a set of blueprints and a list of instructions from an unknown benefactor.\n\nA year later, the four have their first major performance as the Four Horsemen in an elaborate Las Vegas show funded by insurance magnate Arthur Tressler ([[Michael Caine]]). Their final trick appears to transport one of the audience members to the vault of his bank, the Cr\u00e9dit R\u00e9publicain in Paris, where stacks of new euro bills are stored. At the magicians' command, the fans in the vault activate, drawing the bills into the vents and then showering the Las Vegas crowd with them. The euros are shown to be real, and the vault in Paris is found to be empty of its recent shipment of euros. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Dylan Rhodes ([[Mark Ruffalo]]), and [[Interpol]] agent Alma Dray ([[M\u00e9lanie Laurent]]), are then partnered to investigate the Horsemen. The two question the magicians but have no evidence to hold them. Dylan and Alma turn to Thaddeus Bradley ([[Morgan Freeman]]), a former magician and now a popular video host who makes millions of dollars exposing the tricks behind magic acts. Thaddeus demonstrates how the Horsemen used a mock vault under the Las Vegas stage, and explains that the group must have stolen the money in Paris before it arrived at the bank, and replaced it with [[Nitrocellulose|flash paper]] which ignited but left no residue as evidence.\n\nDylan, Alma, and Thaddeus follow the Horsemen to their next show in New Orleans. There, their final trick appears to transfer over 140 million dollars from Tressler's private accounts to those in the audience, made up of people that were denied insurance claims by Tressler's company in the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Dylan and Alma attempt to apprehend the four, but the magicians elude arrest. Tressler hires Thaddeus to expose the Horsemen in revenge for the loss of his money. Alma investigates the Horsemen and determines they are connected to a group called the Eye, a small group of magicians that claim to have access to real magic and only accept the best of the best magicians, who have to be invited and pass tests. She finds out that one of the Eye's members, Lionel Shrike, had previously been exposed by Thaddeus, but died in a locked-safe escape trick he was performing in an attempt to regain his standing. Alma suspects a fifth person is aiding the Horsemen.\n\nDylan discovers his cellphone has been stolen and bugged by the Horsemen, allowing them to access the FBI servers and remain ahead of the investigation. Tracking the real phone leads the FBI to a New York City apartment. When they raid it, three of the Horsemen escape while Jack recovers numerous documents and then leads the authorities on a high-speed car chase. Jack loses control of his car, causing it to flip and catch fire. Dylan is unable to save Jack, but manages to recover the papers, pointing to the Horsemen's next planned crime, stealing millions of dollars in cash out of a large safe of the Elkhorn company. By the time Dylan, Alma, and Thaddeus find the safe, it had just been stolen and loaded into a truck. They quickly apprehend the truck, arrange for it to be delivered to its arranged destination, and Dylan hides inside. But when it arrives and is opened by Bradley and his assistant, it contains nothing but balloon animals, revealing it to be a decoy.\n\nThe Horsemen broadcast that they will perform their final show that night at [[5 Pointz]], inviting the public to attend. The FBI and police converge on the scene and amid the chaos search for the Horsemen. The remaining Horsemen appear to the crowd, giving their fans a farewell and a message about an ulterior purpose, and then run to jump off a roof; Dylan attempts to shoot them but Alma pushes his arm so he misses. The three Horseman jump, turning into a shower of money over the crowd. The money is counterfeit, but the audience's race to collect it prevents the authorities from tracking the real Horsemen.\n\nAfter the show, Thaddeus walks to his car, only to find it full of the money stolen from the real Elkhorn safe, which is later revealed to have never been stolen from the company but was really hidden behind a giant mirror to make it look like it was gone. Assumed to be the fifth Horseman, he is arrested. Dylan speaks to Thaddeus in jail, where Thaddeus slowly comes to realize that Alma's theory was correct, and Dylan was the fifth Horseman. Dylan quietly walks away, leaving Thaddeus shouting \"Why?\" Elsewhere, the Horsemen (including Jack, who had faked his death using a cadaver and a duplicate car) meet at the carousel in Central Park, and use their tarot cards to turn it on. Dylan arrives and welcomes the four to the Eye.\n\nLater, at the [[Pont des Arts]], Dylan meets with Alma and reveals that he is Shrike's son. He brought the Horsemen together to get retribution for his father's death; the Elkhorn Safe Company for providing a faulty safe that led to the accident; Thaddeus, for humiliating and impoverishing his father and forcing him to try the new trick to regain his standing; and the Cr\u00e9dit R\u00e9publicain and Tressler's insurance companies for failing to pay out on Shrike's life insurance. Alma, who has come into a romantic relationship with Dylan, easily decides not to turn him in. She takes a lock and a key that Dylan produces, attaches the lock among the other [[love lock]]s on the railing, and throws the key into the [[Seine]].\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], the Horsemen, driving through a desert, approach a junkyard full of old magician memorabilia, before getting out of their car and slowly beginning to examine the area before coming upon a set of locked crates covered in the symbol of the Eye, but without their playing cards to open them.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- DO NOT change the order of the cast.

M. W. Turner, R.A. making his sketch for the celebrated picture of Mercury & Argus (4674619).jpg|thumb|[[Charles Turner (engraver)|Charles Turner]], c. 1840, ''Portrait of J. M. W. Turner, making his sketch for the celebrated picture of 'Mercury & Argus' ''(exhibited in 1836)]]\nTurner traveled widely in Europe, starting with France and Switzerland in 1802 and studying in [[the Louvre]] in Paris in the same year. He made many visits to Venice. Important support for his work came from [[Walter Fawkes|Walter Ramsden Fawkes]] of [[Farnley Hall (North Yorkshire)|Farnley Hall]], near Otley in Yorkshire, who became a close friend of the artist. Turner first visited Otley in 1797, aged&nbsp;22, when commissioned to paint watercolours of the area. He was so attracted to Otley and the surrounding area that he returned to it throughout his career. The stormy backdrop of ''[[Snow Storm: Hannibal and his Army Crossing the Alps|Hannibal Crossing The Alps]]'' is reputed to have been inspired by a storm over [[the Chevin]] in Otley while he was staying at Farnley Hall.\n\nTurner was a frequent guest of [[George O'Brien Wyndham, 3rd&nbsp;Earl of Egremont]], at [[Petworth House]] in West Sussex and painted scenes that Egremont funded taken from the grounds of the house and of the Sussex countryside, including a view of the Chichester Canal. Petworth House still displays a number of paintings.\n\n=== Personal life ===\nAs Turner grew older, he became more eccentric. He had few close friends except for his father, who lived with him for 30 years and worked as his studio assistant.

Financial independence allowed Turner to innovate freely; his mature work is characterised by a chromatic palette and broadly applied atmospheric washes of paint. According to David Piper's ''The Illustrated History of Art'', his later pictures were called \"fantastic puzzles\". Turner was recognised as an artistic genius: the influential English art critic [[John Ruskin]] described him as the artist who could most \"stirringly and truthfully measure the moods of Nature\".<ref>(Piper 321)</ref> Turner's work drew criticism from contemporaries, in particular from [[Sir George Beaumont, 7th Baronet|Sir George Beaumont]], a landscape painter and fellow member of the Royal Academy, who described his paintings as 'blots'.<ref>{{cite book | last = Wilkinson | first = Gerald | title = The Sketches of Turner, R.A. | publisher = Barrie & Jenkins | location = London | date = 1974 }}</ref>\n\nTurner's imagination was sparked by shipwrecks, fires (including the [[burning of Parliament]] in 1834, an event which Turner witnessed first-hand, and transcribed in a series of watercolour sketches), and natural phenomena such as sunlight, storm, rain, and fog. He was fascinated by the violent power of the sea, as seen in ''Dawn after the Wreck'' (1840) and ''[[The Slave Ship]]'' (1840).\n\nTurner's major venture into printmaking was the ''[[Liber Studiorum]]'' (Book of Studies), seventy prints that he worked on from 1806 to 1819. The ''Liber Studiorum'' was an expression of his intentions for landscape art. The idea was loosely based on [[Claude Lorrain]]'s ''[[Liber Veritatis]]'' (Book of Truth), where Lorrain had recorded his completed paintings; a series of print copies of these drawings, by then at [[Devonshire House]], had been a huge publishing success.  Turner's plates were meant to be widely disseminated, and categorised the genre into six types: Marine, Mountainous, Pastoral, Historical, Architectural, and Elevated or Epic Pastoral.<ref>{{cite book| title=J.M.W.

In ''[[Snow Storm: Hannibal and His Army Crossing the Alps|Hannibal Crossing the Alps]]'' (1812), an emphasis on the destructive power of nature has already come into play. His distinctive style of painting, in which he used watercolour technique with oil paints, created lightness, fluency, and ephemeral atmospheric effects.<ref>Piper 321</ref>\n\nIn Turner's later years he used oils ever more transparently and turned to an evocation of almost pure light by use of shimmering colour. A prime example of his mature style can be seen in ''[[Rain, Steam and Speed \u2013 The Great Western Railway]]'', where the objects are barely recognisable. The intensity of hue and interest in evanescent light not only placed Turner's work in the vanguard of English painting but exerted an influence on art in France; the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], particularly [[Claude Monet]], carefully studied his techniques.\n\nHigh levels of volcanic ash (from the eruption of [[Mt. Tambora]]) in the atmosphere during 1816, the \"[[Year Without a Summer]]\", led to unusually spectacular sunsets during this period, and were an inspiration for some of Turner's work.\n\n[[John Ruskin]] said that an early patron, [[Thomas Monro (art collector)|Thomas Monro]], Principal Physician of [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]], and a collector and amateur artist, was a significant influence on Turner's style:\n<blockquote>His true master was Dr Monro; to the practical teaching of that first patron and the wise simplicity of method of watercolour study, in which he was disciplined by him and companioned by his friend [[Thomas Girtin|Girtin]], the healthy and constant development of the greater power is primarily to be attributed; the greatness of the power itself, it is impossible to over-estimate.</blockquote>\n\nTogether with a number of young artists, Turner was able, in Monro's London house, to copy works of the major topographical draughtsmen of his time and perfect his skills in drawing. But the curious atmospherical effects and illusions of [[John Robert Cozens]]'s watercolours, some of which were present in Monro's house, went far further than the neat renderings of topography. The solemn grandeur of his Alpine views were an early revelation to the young Turner and showed him the true potential of the watercolour medium, conveying mood instead of information.\n\n=== Materials ===\nTurner experimented with a wide variety of pigment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Townsend|first=Joyce H.|date=1993|title=The Materials of J.

As a result, many of his colours have now faded. Ruskin complained at how quickly his work decayed; Turner was indifferent to posterity and chose materials that looked good when freshly applied.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=w486V_or5P8C&q=turner+|title=Color: A Natural History of the Palette|last=Finlay|first=Victoria|publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks|year=2004|isbn=0-8129-7142-6|pages=134\u2013135}} {{subscription required|s}}</ref> By 1930, there was concern that both his oils and his watercolours were fading.<ref name=\"perth\">{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article83121606|title=Colors That Fade: Turner's Masterpieces: Can his works be saved?|date=9 January 1930|work=[[The Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|The Daily News]]|page=2|accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery of works==\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" heights=\"160px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Clare Hall, Turner 1793.jpeg|''Clare Hall and the West end of King's College Chapel, Cambridge'', 1793, watercolor on paper\nFile:Joseph Mallord William Turner 024.jpg|''Calais Pier'', 1801, oil on canvas, [[National Gallery, London]]\nFile:Joseph Mallord William Turner - Dutch Boats in a Gale - WGA23163.jpg|''Dutch Boats in a Gale'', 1801, oil on canvas.

He planned an almshouse at [[Twickenham]] with a gallery for some of his works.

His finished paintings were bequeathed to the British nation, and he intended that a special gallery would be built to house them. This did not happen due to disagreement over the final site. Twenty-two years after his death, the British Parliament passed an act allowing his paintings to be lent to museums outside London, and so began the process of scattering the pictures which Turner had wanted to be kept together.\n\nIn 1910, the main part of the Turner Bequest, which includes unfinished paintings and drawings, was rehoused in the Duveen Turner Wing at the [[Tate Britain|National Gallery of British Art]] (now Tate Britain). In 1987, a new wing at the Tate, the [[Clore Gallery]], was opened to house the Turner bequest, though some of the most important paintings remain in the National Gallery in contravention of Turner's condition that they be kept and shown together. Increasingly paintings are lent abroad, ignoring Turner's provision that they remain constantly and permanently in Turner's Gallery.\n\n[[St.&nbsp;Mary's Church, Battersea]] added a commemorative stained glass window for Turner, between 1976 and 1982.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://home.clara.net/pkennington/VirtualTour/windows_modern.htm#Turner| title=St. Mary's Church Parish website| quote=St Mary's Modern Stained Glass}}</ref> St Paul's Cathedral, Royal Academy of Arts and Victoria & Albert Museum all hold statues representing him.

After the society endorsed the Tate Gallery's Clore Gallery wing (on the lines of the Duveen wing of 1910), as the solution to the controversy of what should be done with the Turner Bequest, Selby Whittingham resigned and founded the Independent Turner Society. The Tate created the prestigious annual [[Turner Prize]] art award in 1984, named in Turner's honour, and 20 years later the [[Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours]] founded the Winsor & Newton Turner Watercolour Award.

He is known for his expressive colourisations, imaginative [[landscape painting|landscapes]] and turbulent, often violent [[Marine art|marine]] paintings.\n\nTurner was born in [[Maiden Lane, Covent Garden]], London, to a modest lower-middle-class family. He lived in London all his life, retaining his [[Cockney accent]] and assiduously avoiding the trappings of success and fame. A child prodigy, Turner studied at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] from 1789, enrolling when he was 14, and exhibited his first work there at 15. During this period, he also served as an architectural draftsman. He earned a steady income from commissions and sales, which due to his troubled, contrary nature, were often begrudgingly accepted. He opened his own gallery in 1804 and became professor of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] at the academy in 1807, where he lectured until 1828, although he was viewed as profoundly inarticulate. He traveled to Europe from 1802, typically returning with voluminous sketchbooks.\n\nIntensely private, [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] and reclusive, Turner was a controversial figure throughout his career. He did not marry, but fathered two daughters, Eveline (1801\u20131874) and Georgiana (1811\u20131843), by his housekeeper Sarah Danby. He became more pessimistic and morose as he got older, especially after the death of his father, after which his outlook deteriorated, his gallery fell into disrepair and neglect, and his art intensified. In 1841 Turner rowed a boat into the Thames so he could not be counted as present at any property.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51474049|title=census|website=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=14 February 2020}}</ref> He lived in squalor and poor health from 1845, and died in London in 1851 aged 76. Turner is buried in [[Saint Paul's Cathedral]], London.\n\nHe left behind more than 550 oil paintings, 2,000 watercolours, and 30,000 works on paper.<ref name=\"Turner Society Homepage\">{{cite web |title=Turner Society Homepage |url=http://www.turnersociety.org.uk/ |accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref> He had been championed by the leading English art critic [[John Ruskin]] from 1840, and is today regarded as having elevated landscape painting to an eminence rivalling [[history painting]].<ref>{{cite journal| quote=At the turn of the 18th century, history painting was the highest purpose art could serve, and Turner would attempt those heights all his life.

M. W. Turner, R.A. making his sketch for the celebrated picture of Mercury & Argus (4674619).jpg|thumb|[[Charles Turner (engraver)|Charles Turner]], c. 1840, ''Portrait of J. M. W. Turner, making his sketch for the celebrated picture of 'Mercury & Argus' ''(exhibited in 1836)]]\nTurner traveled widely in Europe, starting with France and Switzerland in 1802 and studying in [[the Louvre]] in Paris in the same year. He made many visits to Venice. Important support for his work came from [[Walter Fawkes|Walter Ramsden Fawkes]] of [[Farnley Hall (North Yorkshire)|Farnley Hall]], near Otley in Yorkshire, who became a close friend of the artist. Turner first visited Otley in 1797, aged&nbsp;22, when commissioned to paint watercolours of the area. He was so attracted to Otley and the surrounding area that he returned to it throughout his career. The stormy backdrop of ''[[Snow Storm: Hannibal and his Army Crossing the Alps|Hannibal Crossing The Alps]]'' is reputed to have been inspired by a storm over [[the Chevin]] in Otley while he was staying at Farnley Hall.\n\nTurner was a frequent guest of [[George O'Brien Wyndham, 3rd&nbsp;Earl of Egremont]], at [[Petworth House]] in West Sussex and painted scenes that Egremont funded taken from the grounds of the house and of the Sussex countryside, including a view of the Chichester Canal. Petworth House still displays a number of paintings.\n\n=== Personal life ===\nAs Turner grew older, he became more eccentric. He had few close friends except for his father, who lived with him for 30 years and worked as his studio assistant.

Financial independence allowed Turner to innovate freely; his mature work is characterised by a chromatic palette and broadly applied atmospheric washes of paint. According to David Piper's ''The Illustrated History of Art'', his later pictures were called \"fantastic puzzles\". Turner was recognised as an artistic genius: the influential English art critic [[John Ruskin]] described him as the artist who could most \"stirringly and truthfully measure the moods of Nature\".<ref>(Piper 321)</ref> Turner's work drew criticism from contemporaries, in particular from [[Sir George Beaumont, 7th Baronet|Sir George Beaumont]], a landscape painter and fellow member of the Royal Academy, who described his paintings as 'blots'.<ref>{{cite book | last = Wilkinson | first = Gerald | title = The Sketches of Turner, R.A. | publisher = Barrie & Jenkins | location = London | date = 1974 }}</ref>\n\nTurner's imagination was sparked by shipwrecks, fires (including the [[burning of Parliament]] in 1834, an event which Turner witnessed first-hand, and transcribed in a series of watercolour sketches), and natural phenomena such as sunlight, storm, rain, and fog. He was fascinated by the violent power of the sea, as seen in ''Dawn after the Wreck'' (1840) and ''[[The Slave Ship]]'' (1840).\n\nTurner's major venture into printmaking was the ''[[Liber Studiorum]]'' (Book of Studies), seventy prints that he worked on from 1806 to 1819. The ''Liber Studiorum'' was an expression of his intentions for landscape art. The idea was loosely based on [[Claude Lorrain]]'s ''[[Liber Veritatis]]'' (Book of Truth), where Lorrain had recorded his completed paintings; a series of print copies of these drawings, by then at [[Devonshire House]], had been a huge publishing success.  Turner's plates were meant to be widely disseminated, and categorised the genre into six types: Marine, Mountainous, Pastoral, Historical, Architectural, and Elevated or Epic Pastoral.<ref>{{cite book| title=J.M.W.

In ''[[Snow Storm: Hannibal and His Army Crossing the Alps|Hannibal Crossing the Alps]]'' (1812), an emphasis on the destructive power of nature has already come into play. His distinctive style of painting, in which he used watercolour technique with oil paints, created lightness, fluency, and ephemeral atmospheric effects.<ref>Piper 321</ref>\n\nIn Turner's later years he used oils ever more transparently and turned to an evocation of almost pure light by use of shimmering colour. A prime example of his mature style can be seen in ''[[Rain, Steam and Speed \u2013 The Great Western Railway]]'', where the objects are barely recognisable. The intensity of hue and interest in evanescent light not only placed Turner's work in the vanguard of English painting but exerted an influence on art in France; the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], particularly [[Claude Monet]], carefully studied his techniques.\n\nHigh levels of volcanic ash (from the eruption of [[Mt. Tambora]]) in the atmosphere during 1816, the \"[[Year Without a Summer]]\", led to unusually spectacular sunsets during this period, and were an inspiration for some of Turner's work.\n\n[[John Ruskin]] said that an early patron, [[Thomas Monro (art collector)|Thomas Monro]], Principal Physician of [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]], and a collector and amateur artist, was a significant influence on Turner's style:\n<blockquote>His true master was Dr Monro; to the practical teaching of that first patron and the wise simplicity of method of watercolour study, in which he was disciplined by him and companioned by his friend [[Thomas Girtin|Girtin]], the healthy and constant development of the greater power is primarily to be attributed; the greatness of the power itself, it is impossible to over-estimate.</blockquote>\n\nTogether with a number of young artists, Turner was able, in Monro's London house, to copy works of the major topographical draughtsmen of his time and perfect his skills in drawing. But the curious atmospherical effects and illusions of [[John Robert Cozens]]'s watercolours, some of which were present in Monro's house, went far further than the neat renderings of topography. The solemn grandeur of his Alpine views were an early revelation to the young Turner and showed him the true potential of the watercolour medium, conveying mood instead of information.\n\n=== Materials ===\nTurner experimented with a wide variety of pigment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Townsend|first=Joyce H.|date=1993|title=The Materials of J.

As a result, many of his colours have now faded. Ruskin complained at how quickly his work decayed; Turner was indifferent to posterity and chose materials that looked good when freshly applied.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=w486V_or5P8C&q=turner+|title=Color: A Natural History of the Palette|last=Finlay|first=Victoria|publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks|year=2004|isbn=0-8129-7142-6|pages=134\u2013135}} {{subscription required|s}}</ref> By 1930, there was concern that both his oils and his watercolours were fading.<ref name=\"perth\">{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article83121606|title=Colors That Fade: Turner's Masterpieces: Can his works be saved?|date=9 January 1930|work=[[The Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|The Daily News]]|page=2|accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery of works==\n<gallery widths=\"190px\" heights=\"160px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Clare Hall, Turner 1793.jpeg|''Clare Hall and the West end of King's College Chapel, Cambridge'', 1793, watercolor on paper\nFile:Joseph Mallord William Turner 024.jpg|''Calais Pier'', 1801, oil on canvas, [[National Gallery, London]]\nFile:Joseph Mallord William Turner - Dutch Boats in a Gale - WGA23163.jpg|''Dutch Boats in a Gale'', 1801, oil on canvas.

He planned an almshouse at [[Twickenham]] with a gallery for some of his works.

His finished paintings were bequeathed to the British nation, and he intended that a special gallery would be built to house them. This did not happen due to disagreement over the final site. Twenty-two years after his death, the British Parliament passed an act allowing his paintings to be lent to museums outside London, and so began the process of scattering the pictures which Turner had wanted to be kept together.\n\nIn 1910, the main part of the Turner Bequest, which includes unfinished paintings and drawings, was rehoused in the Duveen Turner Wing at the [[Tate Britain|National Gallery of British Art]] (now Tate Britain). In 1987, a new wing at the Tate, the [[Clore Gallery]], was opened to house the Turner bequest, though some of the most important paintings remain in the National Gallery in contravention of Turner's condition that they be kept and shown together. Increasingly paintings are lent abroad, ignoring Turner's provision that they remain constantly and permanently in Turner's Gallery.\n\n[[St.&nbsp;Mary's Church, Battersea]] added a commemorative stained glass window for Turner, between 1976 and 1982.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://home.clara.net/pkennington/VirtualTour/windows_modern.htm#Turner| title=St. Mary's Church Parish website| quote=St Mary's Modern Stained Glass}}</ref> St Paul's Cathedral, Royal Academy of Arts and Victoria & Albert Museum all hold statues representing him.

After the society endorsed the Tate Gallery's Clore Gallery wing (on the lines of the Duveen wing of 1910), as the solution to the controversy of what should be done with the Turner Bequest, Selby Whittingham resigned and founded the Independent Turner Society. The Tate created the prestigious annual [[Turner Prize]] art award in 1984, named in Turner's honour, and 20 years later the [[Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours]] founded the Winsor & Newton Turner Watercolour Award.
