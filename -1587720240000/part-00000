In a promissory coup, an incumbent elected government is deposed in a [[coup d'etat]] by coup leaders who claim to defend democracy and promise to hold elections in order to restore democracy. In these situations, coupmakers emphasize the temporary and necessary nature of their intervention in order to ensure democracy in the future.<ref name=\":02\" /> This is unlike the more open-ended coups that occurred during the Cold War. Political scientist Nancy Bermeo says that \"The share of successful coups that falls into the promissory category has risen significantly, from 35 percent before 1990 to 85 percent afterward.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> Examining 12 promissory coups in democratic states between 1990 and 2012, Bermeo found that \"Few promissory coups were followed quickly by competitive elections, and fewer still paved the way for improved democracies.\"<ref name=\":02\" />\n* '''Executive aggrandizement.''' This process contains a series of institutional changes by the elected executives, impairing the ability of the political opposition to challenge the government and hold it to account. The most important feature of executive aggrandizement is that the institutional changes are made through legal channels, making it seem as if the elected official has a democratic mandate.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=How Democracies Die|last=Levitsky|first=Steven|last2=Ziblatt|first2=Daniel|publisher=Crown|year=2018|isbn=|location=United States|pages=76\u201378}}</ref> Some examples of executive aggrandizement are the decline of media freedom and the weakening of the [[rule of law]] (i.e., judicial and bureaucratic restraints on the government), such as when judicial autonomy is threatened.<ref name=\":02\" />\n* '''Strategic harassment and manipulation during elections.''' This form of democratic backsliding entails the impairment of [[free and fair elections]] through tactics such as blocking media access, disqualifying opposition leaders, or harassing opponents. This form of backsliding is done in such a way that the elections do not appear to be rigged and rarely involves any apparent violations of the law, making it difficult for international [[election monitoring]] organizations to observe or criticize these misconducts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nDemocratic backsliding is often led by democratically elected leaders, and uses tactics that are \"incremental rather than revolutionary.\"<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://institute.global/sites/default/files/articles/The-Populist-Harm-to-Democracy-An-Empirical-Assessment.pdf|title=The Populist Harm to Democracy: An Empirical Assessment|last=Kyle|first=Jordan|last2=Mounk|first2=Yascha|date=December 2018|publisher=Tony Blair Institute for Global Change|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> This also makes it harder to pinpoint when a democracy breaks down, because as [[Steven Levitsky]] and [[Daniel Ziblatt]] pointed out, this happens \"slowly, in barely visible steps\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Causes of democratic backsliding==\n\n=== The Media ===\nThe Varieties of Democracy Project (V-Dem) contains more than eighteen-million data points relevant to democracy, measuring 350 highly specific indicators across 174 currently existing countries as of the end of 2016.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mechkova|first=Valeriya|last2=L\u00fchrmann|first2=Anna|last3=Lindberg|first3=Staffan I.|date=2017|title=How Much Democratic Backsliding?|journal=Journal of Democracy|language=en|volume=28|issue=4|pages=162\u2013169|doi=10.1353/jod.2017.0075|issn=1086-3214|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/052b0e535f6bc0da7bc418e74e614be39ef55154}}</ref> V-Dem's 2019 Democracy report discovered that the trend of autocratization continues, but global democracy levels are not in free fall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/99/de/99dedd73-f8bc-484c-8b91-44ba601b6e6b/v-dem_democracy_report_2019.pdf |access-date=2 January 2020|title=Democracy Facing Global Challenges|last=|first=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|year=2019}}</ref> One of the main challenges V-Dem discovered to democracy was that freedom of expression and the media are the areas under the most severe attack by governments around the world, followed by closing space for civil society, and an erosion of the rule of law.

In fact, we suggest that populism tends to play a positive role in the promotion of an electoral or minimal democracy, but a negative role when it comes to fostering the development of a full-fledged liberal democratic regime. Consequently, while populism tends to favor the democratization of authoritarian regimes, it is prone to diminish the quality of liberal democracies.  Populism supports popular sovereignty, but it is inclined to oppose any limitations on majority rule, such as judicial independence and majority rights. Populism-in-power has led to processes of de-democratization (e.g., [[Viktor Orban|[Viktor] Orb\u00e1n]] in Hungary or [[Hugo Chavez|[Hugo] Ch\u00e1vez]] in Venezuela) and, in some extreme cases, even to the breakdown of the democratic regime (e.g., [[Alberto Fujimori|[Alberto] Fujimori]] in Peru).<ref>[[Cas Mudde|Mudde, Cas]] and Kaltwasser, Crist\u00f3bal Rovira (2017) ''Populism: a Very Short Introduction''.

The authors examine the effect of populism on three major aspects of democracy: the quality of democracy in general, [[Checks and Balances|checks and balances]] on executive power and citizens' right to politically participate in a meaningful way. They conclude that populist governments are four times more likely to cause harm to democratic institutions than non-populist governments. Also, more than half of populist leaders have amended or rewritten the countries' constitution, frequently in a way that eroded checks and balances on executive power. Lastly, populists attack individual rights such as freedom of press, civil liberties and political rights.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn a 2018 journal article on democratic backsliding, scholars Licia Cianetti, James Dawson, and Se\u00e1n Hanley argued that the emergence of populist movements in [[Central and Eastern Europe]], such as [[Andrej Babi\u0161]]'s [[ANO 2011|ANO]] in the [[Czech Republic]], are \"a potentially ambiguous phenomenon, articulating genuine societal demands for political reform and pushing issues of good governance centre stage, but further loosening the weak checks and balances that characterise post-communist democracy and embedding private interests at the core of the state.\"<ref name=\"Cianetti\"/>\n\nIn a 2019 paper, presented to the International Society of Political Psychologists, Shawn Rosenberg argues that right wing populism is exposing a vulnerability in democratic structures and that \"democracy is likely to devour itself.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Democracy Devouring Itself: The Rise of the Incompetent Citizen and the Appeal of Right Wing Populism|last=Rosenberg, S|date=2019-01-01|publisher=eScholarship, University of California|oclc=1055900632}}</ref>\n\n===Economic inequality and social discontent===\nMany [[political economy]] scholars, such as [[Daron Acemoglu]] and [[James A.

In a promissory coup, an incumbent elected government is deposed in a [[coup d'etat]] by coup leaders who claim to defend democracy and promise to hold elections in order to restore democracy. In these situations, coupmakers emphasize the temporary and necessary nature of their intervention in order to ensure democracy in the future.<ref name=\":02\" /> This is unlike the more open-ended coups that occurred during the Cold War. Political scientist Nancy Bermeo says that \"The share of successful coups that falls into the promissory category has risen significantly, from 35 percent before 1990 to 85 percent afterward.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> Examining 12 promissory coups in democratic states between 1990 and 2012, Bermeo found that \"Few promissory coups were followed quickly by competitive elections, and fewer still paved the way for improved democracies.\"<ref name=\":02\" />\n* '''Executive aggrandizement.''' This process contains a series of institutional changes by the elected executives, impairing the ability of the political opposition to challenge the government and hold it to account. The most important feature of executive aggrandizement is that the institutional changes are made through legal channels, making it seem as if the elected official has a democratic mandate.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=How Democracies Die|last=Levitsky|first=Steven|last2=Ziblatt|first2=Daniel|publisher=Crown|year=2018|isbn=|location=United States|pages=76\u201378}}</ref> Some examples of executive aggrandizement are the decline of media freedom and the weakening of the [[rule of law]] (i.e., judicial and bureaucratic restraints on the government), such as when judicial autonomy is threatened.<ref name=\":02\" />\n* '''Strategic harassment and manipulation during elections.''' This form of democratic backsliding entails the impairment of [[free and fair elections]] through tactics such as blocking media access, disqualifying opposition leaders, or harassing opponents. This form of backsliding is done in such a way that the elections do not appear to be rigged and rarely involves any apparent violations of the law, making it difficult for international [[election monitoring]] organizations to observe or criticize these misconducts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nDemocratic backsliding is often led by democratically elected leaders, and uses tactics that are \"incremental rather than revolutionary.\"<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://institute.global/sites/default/files/articles/The-Populist-Harm-to-Democracy-An-Empirical-Assessment.pdf|title=The Populist Harm to Democracy: An Empirical Assesment|last=Kyle|first=Jordan|last2=Mounk|first2=Yascha|date=December 2018|publisher=Tony Blair Institute for Global Change|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> This also makes it harder to pinpoint when a democracy breaks down, because as [[Steven Levitsky]] and [[Daniel Ziblatt]] pointed out, this happens \"slowly, in barely visible steps\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Causes of democratic backsliding==\n\n=== The Media ===\nThe Varieties of Democracy Project (V-Dem) contains more than eighteen-million data points relevant to democracy, measuring 350 highly specific indicators across 174 currently existing countries as of the end of 2016.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mechkova|first=Valeriya|last2=L\u00fchrmann|first2=Anna|last3=Lindberg|first3=Staffan I.|date=2017|title=How Much Democratic Backsliding?|journal=Journal of Democracy|language=en|volume=28|issue=4|pages=162\u2013169|doi=10.1353/jod.2017.0075|issn=1086-3214|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/052b0e535f6bc0da7bc418e74e614be39ef55154}}</ref> V-Dem's 2019 Democracy report discovered that the trend of autocratization continues, but global democracy levels are not in free fall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.v-dem.net/media/filer_public/99/de/99dedd73-f8bc-484c-8b91-44ba601b6e6b/v-dem_democracy_report_2019.pdf |access-date=2 January 2020|title=Democracy Facing Global Challenges|last=|first=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|year=2019}}</ref> One of the main challenges V-Dem discovered to democracy was that freedom of expression and the media are the areas under the most severe attack by governments around the world, followed by closing space for civil society, and an erosion of the rule of law.

In fact, we suggest that populism tends to play a positive role in the promotion of an electoral or minimal democracy, but a negative role when it comes to fostering the development of a full-fledged liberal democratic regime. Consequently, while populism tends to favor the democratization of authoritarian regimes, it is prone to diminish the quality of liberal democracies.  Populism supports popular sovereignty, but it is inclined to oppose any limitations on majority rule, such as judicial independence and majority rights. Populism-in-power has led to processes of de-democratization (e.g., [[Viktor Orban|[Viktor] Orb\u00e1n]] in Hungary or [[Hugo Chavez|[Hugo] Ch\u00e1vez]] in Venezuala) and, in some extreme cases, even to the breakdown of the democratic regime (e.g., [[Alberto Fujimori|[Alberto] Fujimori]] in Peru).<ref>[[Cas Mudde|Mudde, Cas]] and Kaltwasser, Crist\u00f3bal Rovira (2017) ''Populism: a Very Short Introduction''.

The authors examine the effect of populism on three major aspects of democracy: the quality of democracy in general, [[Checks and Balances|checks and balances]] on executive power and citizens' right to politically participate in a meaningful way. They conclude that populist governments are four times more likely to cause harm to democratic institutions than non-populist governments. Also, more than half of populist leaders have amended or rewritten the countries' constitution, frequently in a way that eroded checks and balances on executive power. Lastly, populists attack individual rights such as freedom of press, civil liberties and political rights.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn a 2018 journal article on democratic backsliding, scholars Licia Cianetti, James Dawson, and Se\u00e1n Hanley argued that the emergence of populist movements in [[Central and Eastern Europe]], such as [[Andrej Babi\u0161]]'s [[ANO 2011|ANO]] in the [[Czech Republic]], are \"a potentially ambiguous phenomenon, articulating genuine societal demands for political reform and pushing issues of good governance centre stage, but further loosening the weak checks and balances that characterise post-communist democracy and embedding private interests at the core of the state.\"<ref name=\"Cianetti\"/>\n\nIn a 2019 paper, presented to the International Society of Political Psychologists, Shawn Rosenberg argues that right wing populism is exposing a vulnerability in democratic structures and that \"democracy is likely to devour itself.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Democracy Devouring Itself: The Rise of the Incompetent Citizen and the Appeal of Right Wing Populism|last=Rosenberg, S|date=2019-01-01|publisher=eScholarship, University of California|oclc=1055900632}}</ref>\n\n===Economic inequality and social discontent===\nMany [[political economy]] scholars, such as [[Daron Acemoglu]] and [[James A.

He also held the titles of [[Margrave of Moravia]] from 1247, [[Duke of Austria]] from 1251, [[Duke of Styria]] from 1260, as well as [[Duke of Carinthia]] and [[Margrave of Carniola|landgrave of Carniola]] from 1269.\n\nWith Ottokar's rule, the P\u0159emyslids reached the peak of their power in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. His expectations of the imperial crown, however, were never fulfilled.\n\n==Biography==\nOttokar was the second son of King [[Wenceslaus I of Bohemia]] (reigned 1230-1253). Through his mother, [[Kunigunde of Hohenstaufen| Kunigunde]], daughter of [[Philip of Swabia]], he was related to the Holy Roman Emperors of the [[House of Hohenstaufen| Hohenstaufen dynasty]], which became extinct in the male line upon the execution of King [[Conradin|Conradin of Sicily]] in 1268.\n\nNamed after his grandfather King [[Ottokar I of Bohemia |P\u0159emysl Ottokar I]], he was originally educated for the role of an ecclesiastical administrator, while his elder brother [[Vladislaus III of Moravia| Vladislaus]] was designated heir of the [[Bohemian kingdom]]. He was possibly educated by the Bohemian chancellor [[Philip of Spanheim]], who would later become a rival for the rule of the Duchy of Carinthia.\n\n===Rise to power===\nWhen his brother Vladislaus died in 1247, Ottokar suddenly became the heir to the Bohemian throne. According to popular oral tradition, he was profoundly shocked by his brother's death and did not involve himself in politics, becoming focused on hunting and drinking. His father appointed the new heir as [[Margraviate of Moravia|Margrave of Moravia]], and Ottokar took up residence in [[Brno]], where he was occupied with the reconstruction of the [[Moravia]]n lands devastated by [[Mongol invasion of Europe |Mongol raids]] of 1242.\n\nIn 1248 some discontented nobles enticed him into leading a rebellion against his father King Wenceslaus. During this rebellion he was elected{{by whom?|date=February 2019}} \"the younger King\" (''mlad\u0161\u00ed kr\u00e1l'') on 31 July 1248 and temporarily expelled his father from [[Prague Castle]]. P\u0159emysl Ottokar II held the title of King of Bohemia until November 1249. However, [[Pope Innocent IV]] [[excommunication|excommunicated]] Ottokar, whereafter Wenceslaus finally managed to defeat the rebels and imprisoned his son at [[P\u0159imda]] Castle.<ref>[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]</ref>\n\nFather and son eventually reconciled to assist the king's aim of acquiring the neighbouring [[Duchy of Austria]], where the last [[House of Babenberg| Babenberg]] duke, [[Frederick II, Duke of Austria|Frederick II]] had been killed in the 1246 [[Battle of the Leitha River]].{{sfn|Engel|2005|p= 106}} King Wenceslaus had initially attempted to acquire Austria by marrying his heir, Vladislaus, to the last duke's niece [[Gertrude, Duchess of Austria| Gertrude of Babenberg]]. That marriage came to an end after half a year with Vladislaus's death in January 1247, and in 1248 Gertrude married the [[House of Z\u00e4hringen| Z\u00e4hringen]] margrave [[Herman VI, Margrave of Baden| Herman VI of Baden]]. Herman, rejected by the Austrian nobility, could not establish his rule. Wenceslaus used this as pretext to invade Austria when Herman died in 1250 \u2014 according to some sources, the estates called upon him to restore order.\n\nWenceslaus released P\u0159emysl Ottokar very soon and in 1251 again made him Margrave of Moravia and installed him, with the approval of the Austrian nobles, as governor of Austria. The same year Ottokar entered Austria, where the estates acclaimed him as Duke. To legitimize his position, P\u0159emysl Ottokar married the late Duke Frederick II's sister [[Margaret of Austria, Queen of Bohemia| Margaret of Babenberg]], who was his senior by 30 years and the widow of the Hohenstaufen king [[Henry (VII) of Germany]].{{sfn|Haverkamp|1988|p= 266}} Their marriage took place on 11 February 1252 at [[Hainburg an der Donau| Hainburg]].{{sfn|Kuthan|1996|p= 14}}\n\nIn 1253 King Wenceslaus died and P\u0159emysl Ottokar succeeded his father as King of Bohemia. After the death of the German King [[Conrad IV of Germany |Konrad IV]] in 1254 while his son Conradin was still a minor, Ottokar also hoped to obtain the Imperial dignity - as [[King of the Romans]] - for himself. However, his election bid was unsuccessful and Count [[William II of Holland]], the German [[anti-king]] since 1247, was generally recognised.\n\n===Building an empire===\n[[File:Karte B\u00f6hmen unter Ottokar II.png|thumb|right|At the peak of his power, Ottokar II's realm stretched from the [[Sudetes]] to the [[Adriatic Sea]].]]\nFeeling threatened by Ottokar's growing regional power beyond the [[Leitha]] River, his cousin King [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary]] challenged the young king. B\u00e9la formed a loose alliance with the [[House of Wittelsbach| Wittelsbach]] duke [[Otto II Wittelsbach, Duke of Bavaria |Otto II of Bavaria]] and tried to install his own son [[Stephen V of Hungary|Stephen]] as Duke of [[Duchy of Styria| Styria]], which since 1192 had been ruled in [[personal union]] with Austria under the terms of the [[Georgenberg Pact]] of 1186. Papal mediation settled the conflict : the parties agreed that Ottokar would yield large parts of Styria to B\u00e9la in exchange for recognition of his right to the remainder of Austria.\n\nSubsequently King Ottokar II led the [[Prussian Crusade |two crusade expeditions]] against the pagan [[Old Prussians]] (1254-1255 and 1268).<ref> [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] (now [[Kaliningrad]], Russia), founded in 1255 by the [[Teutonic Order]], was named in his honour and later became the capital of the [[Duchy of Prussia]].\n\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Gladysz\n | first1 = Mikolaj\n | author-link1 = \n | translator1-last = Barford\n | translator1-first = Paul\n | orig-year = 2002\n | title = The Forgotten Crusaders: Poland and the Crusader Movement in the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries\n | trans-title = Zapomniani krzyzowcy\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=l9R2WMhnHHAC\n | series = The Northern World\n | volume = 56\n | location = Leiden\n | publisher = Brill\n | publication-date = 2012\n | page = 330, 344\n | isbn = 9789004185517\n | access-date = 22 Feb 2019\n | quote = Ottokar II must have been well-remembered in Poland due to his great Prussian crusade in 1254\u201355 [...].

This peace agreement was also sealed by a royal marriage. Ottokar ended his marriage to Margaret and married B\u00e9la's young granddaughter [[Kunigunda of Halych]], who became the mother of his children.{{sfn|Kuthan|1996|p= 17}} The youngest of them became his only legitimate son, [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|Wenceslaus II]].\n\nDuring the Imperial [[Interregnum (Holy Roman Empire)| Imperial ''interregnum'']] of 1250 to 1273, Ottokar could increase his personal influence while Richard of Cornwall and [[Alfonso X of Castile |Alfonso of Castile]] jostled to attain the Imperial dignity. In 1266 he occupied the [[Egerland]] in north-west Bohemia, and in 1268 he signed an inheritance treaty with the [[House of Sponheim| Sponheim]] duke [[Ulrich III, Duke of Carinthia |Ulrich III of Carinthia]], succeeding him in [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], [[March of Carniola|Carniola]] and the [[Windic March]] the next year. In 1272 he also acquired [[Friuli]]. His rule was once again contested by the Hungarians on the field of battle. After [[Peace_of_Pressburg_(1271)| another victory]], Ottokar became the most powerful king within the Empire.\n\n===The path to the final battle===\nAfter Richard of Cornwall died in April 1272 and [[Pope Gregory X]] rejected the claims raised by Alfonso of Castile, a new election for the Imperial German throne took place in 1273. However, the Bohemian king again failed to win the Imperial crown, as the [[Prince-elector |electors]] voted for the \"little count\" [[Rudolf I of Germany |Rudolf of Habsburg]], Ottokar's last and finally victorious rival.\n\nP\u0159emysl Ottokar refused to acknowledge Rudolf's election, and urged the Pope to adopt a similar policy. At a convention of the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)| Imperial Diet]] at [[Nuremberg]] in 1274, Rudolf decreed that all Imperial lands that had changed hands since the death of the last Hohenstaufen emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] must be returned to the crown. This would have deprived Ottokar not only of the Egerland, but also of the Austrian, Styrian, and Carinthian duchies. In 1275 Rudolf placed Ottokar under the [[Imperial ban]] and besieged his [[Hofburg Palace | Hofburg]] residence in [[Vienna]], while a rebellion led by the [[V\u00edtkovci]] noble [[Zavis of Falkenstein]] disrupted the Bohemian lands. This compelled P\u0159emysl Ottokar in November 1276 to sign a new treaty by which he gave up all claims to Austria and the neighboring duchies, retaining for himself only Bohemia and Moravia. Ottokar's son [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia| Wenceslaus]] became  betrothed to Rudolf's daughter [[Judith of Habsburg |Judith]]. There followed an uneasy peace.\n\nTwo years later, the Bohemian king made a last attempt to recover his lost lands by force. P\u0159emysl Ottokar again found allies in Bavaria, [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] and [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty|Poland]]. He collected a large army to meet the forces of Rudolf and his ally King [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary]] in the [[Battle on the Marchfeld]] on 26 August 1278, where he was defeated and killed.{{sfn|Tucker|2010|p= 289}} Rudolf had his body laid out in state at the [[Minoritenkirche (Vienna)|Minorites Church]] in Vienna. (In 1297 Ottokar's mortal remains were finally transferred to [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] in Prague.) His 6-year-old son Wenceslaus II succeeded him as King of Bohemia.\n\n==Marriage and children==\nOn 11 February 1252, P\u0159emysl Ottokar II married [[Margaret, Duchess of Austria|Margaret of Austria]].{{sfn|Haverkamp|1988|p=266}} Margaret was 26 years older than him and the couple's childless marriage ended with an annulment.{{sfn|Haverkamp|1988|p=266}} On 25 October 1261, Ottokar married [[Kunigunda of Slavonia]].{{sfn|Kuthan|1996|p=17}} They probably had four children:\n\n*Henry (1262\u20131263)\n*[[Kunigunde of Bohemia|Kunigunde]] (January 1265 \u2013 27 November 1321), married [[Boleslaus II of Masovia]]\n*Agnes (5 September 1269 \u2013 17 May 1296), married [[Rudolf II, Duke of Austria]]\n*[[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|Wenceslaus II]] (17 September 1271 \u2013 21 June 1305){{sfn|Sedlar|1994|p=443}}\n\nOttokar also had two extramarital sons and daughters. The most important was his firstborn, [[Nicholas I, Duke of Troppau|Nicholas]].{{sfn|Veszpremy|Schaer|1999|p=153}} He was never accepted as heir apparent to the Bohemian crown by the sitting pope, but was given the [[Duchy of Opava]] as fief in 1269.{{sfn|Veszpremy|Schaer|1999|p=153}} Other illegitimate children include John, provost of [[Vy\u0161ehrad Chapter]].\n\n[[File:King P\u0159emysl Otakar II of Bohemia - Alfons Mucha.jpg|thumb|left|In the painting, ''P\u0159emysl Otakar II: The Union of Slavic Dynasties'', part of [[Alfons Mucha]]'s 20-canvas work ''[[The Slav Epic]]'', Ottokar is depicted at his niece's wedding celebration, forging alliances with other Slavic rulers in attendance.]]\n\n==Legacy==\nP\u0159emysl Ottokar is considered one of the greatest kings of Bohemia, along with [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]]. He was a founder of many new towns (about 30 \u2014 not only in Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia, but also in Austria and Styria) and incorporated many existing settlements through civic charters, giving them new privileges. He was a strong proponent of trade, law and order. Furthermore, he instituted open immigration policies through which skilled German-speaking immigrants settled in major cities throughout his domains. As noted, the historic [[East Prussian]] city of [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] (''King's Mountain'') was named in his honor as a tribute to his support of the Teutonic Knights in their war with the pagan [[Old Prussians]].\n\nAs Czech traditional law was different from that of his other domains, many principles introduced during his reign formed core of the Czech law for the following centuries. From his time stems the oldest preserved source of Czech law, [[Zemsk\u00e9 desky]], and also the oldest written Czech communal law, recorded in the founding deeds of the respective towns. By supporting the city of [[Jihlava]] (German: Iglau) with its mines, he laid foundation of the silver wealth of later Bohemian kings. Privileges of civic charters usually excluded the towns from obedience to the traditional courts held by members of nobility. This can be seen as a step towards equality and a precursor of modern civil law.\n\nIn the country, Ottokar's introduction of the Law of [[Emphyteusis]] into the Czech law is sometimes interpreted as \"Germanization\". In fact it was creative, for it freed subjects from feudal obligations, except for rent \u2014 and tax, if such was levied. Free selling and leaving of estates could also be bought and soon became common. Thus, Ottokar can be reckoned an early Bohemian ruler who furthered Bohemian rights in medieval times. This change of legal environment in Bohemia was introduced by systematic founding of villages chartered under this law.\n\nHe issued also a general privilege to the Jews (1254), which established principles of integration of the Jews into the Czech society until 1848. The Jews were now eligible for various positions, such as servants of crown, thereby being somewhat less subject to discrimination. Instead of being able to claim only the support of individual lords, the Jews could from then on claim support of any royal officer.\n\nOttokar followed with a systematic policy of strengthening his domains by building fortifications. Besides supporting towns, he built many fortresses himself \u2014 [[Zv\u00edkov Castle]], [[K\u0159ivokl\u00e1t Castle]] or [[Bezd\u011bz Castle]] in Bohemia, and the famed [[Hofburg Palace]] in Vienna \u2014 and also induced his vassals to build castles. A sign of rising strength of Bohemia, it was also a reaction to the [[Mongol raids]] of the 13th century (see [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary]]). Conflict for the title of ownership to these fortified places built by members of nobility was probably the source of an uprising in 1276, which cost Ottokar the Austrian lands, and two years later (in an attempt for reconquest) his life.\n\nSome of the fortresses built by Ottokar were for centuries the strongest in Bohemia. Ironically, [[Bezd\u011bz Castle]] served as a prison for his son [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia]] for short time after Ottokar's death. The castle housed Bohemian legal records [[Zemsk\u00e9 desky]] and many spiritual and temporal treasures during the destructive civil strife of the [[Hussite wars]] (1419\u20131434) in Bohemia. It was conquered in 1620, during the [[30 Years' War]], but by then it was long deserted, and in that state was defended by rebelling subjects against an Imperial army.\n\nBefore his conflict with [[Rudolf of Habsburg]], Ottokar exacted influence over a number of relatives, allies and vassals in Germany, such as the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] \u2014 and spiritual principalities, including the [[Archbishopric of Salzburg]] and the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia (state)|Patriarchate of Aquileia]]. After the death of [[Konradin]] in 1268 he was an heir of the [[House of Hohenstaufen]]'s claim to the imperial crown. However, he did not raise this claim, remaining content with informal influence in Germany. In 1267 he was appointed protector of the royal domains (of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]) east of the Rhine by the German king, [[Richard of Cornwall]]. He held this office till 1273.\n\nOttokar is a significant figure in history and legend. In the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' by [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], Ottokar is seen outside the gates of Purgatory, in amiable companionship with his imperial rival Rudolf. He is also the protagonist of a tragedy by the 19th-century Austrian playwright [[Franz Grillparzer]], titled ''[[K\u00f6nig Ottokars Gl\u00fcck und Ende]]''.\n\nThere is a [[Statue of P\u0159emysl Otakar II|statue]] dedicated to him.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Crown of Ottokar II.jpg|Burial crown of Ottokar II of Bohemia at [[Prague Castle]]\nImage:Premyslnahrobek01.jpg|Tomb of Ottokar II in [[St. Vitus Cathedral]], Prague\nImage:Premysl2Gelnhausen.jpg|Ottokar II P\u0159emysl in a miniature from the Gelnhausen Codex\nImage:Jan-Goth-PremyslOtakar.jpg|''Ottokar is accepted as [[Duke of Austria]] in 1251''.

He also held the titles of [[Margrave of Moravia]] from 1247, [[Duke of Austria]] from 1251, [[Duke of Styria]] from 1260, as well as [[Duke of Carinthia]] and [[Margrave of Carniola|landgrave of Carniola]] from 1269.\n\nWith Ottokar's rule, the P\u0159emyslids reached the peak of their power in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. His expectations of the imperial crown, however, were never fulfilled.\n\n==Biography==\nOttokar was the second son of King [[Wenceslaus I of Bohemia]] (reigned 1230-1253). Through his mother, [[Kunigunde of Hohenstaufen| Kunigunde]], daughter of [[Philip of Swabia]], he was related to the Holy Roman Emperors of the [[House of Hohenstaufen| Hohenstaufen dynasty]], which became extinct in the male line upon the execution of King [[Conradin|Conradin of Sicily]] in 1268.\n\nNamed after his grandfather King [[Ottokar I of Bohemia |P\u0159emysl Ottokar I]], he was originally educated for the role of an ecclesiastical administrator, while his elder brother [[Vladislaus III of Moravia| Vladislaus]] was designated heir of the [[Bohemian kingdom]]. He was possibly educated by the Bohemian chancellor [[Philip of Spanheim]], who would later become a rival for the rule of the Duchy of Carinthia.\n\n===Rise to power===\nWhen his brother Vladislaus died in 1247, Ottokar suddenly became the heir to the Bohemian throne. According to popular oral tradition, he was profoundly shocked by his brother's death and did not involve himself in politics, becoming focused on hunting and drinking. His father appointed the new heir as [[Margraviate of Moravia|Margrave of Moravia]], and Ottokar took up residence in [[Brno]], where he was occupied with the reconstruction of the [[Moravia]]n lands devastated by [[Mongol invasion of Europe |Mongol raids]] of 1242.\n\nIn 1248 some discontented nobles enticed him into leading a rebellion against his father King Wenceslaus. During this rebellion he was elected{{by whom?|date=February 2019}} \"the younger King\" (''mlad\u0161\u00ed kr\u00e1l'') on 31 July 1248 and temporarily expelled his father from [[Prague Castle]]. P\u0159emysl Ottokar II held the title of King of Bohemia until November 1249. However, [[Pope Innocent IV]] [[excommunication|excommunicated]] Ottokar, whereafter Wenceslaus finally managed to defeat the rebels and imprisoned his son at [[P\u0159imda]] Castle.<ref>[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]</ref>\n\nFather and son eventually reconciled to assist the king's aim of acquiring the neighbouring [[Duchy of Austria]], where the last [[House of Babenberg| Babenberg]] duke, [[Frederick II, Duke of Austria|Frederick II]] had been killed in the 1246 [[Battle of the Leitha River]].{{sfn|Engel|2005|p= 106}} King Wenceslaus had initially attempted to acquire Austria by marrying his heir, Vladislaus, to the last duke's niece [[Gertrude, Duchess of Austria| Gertrude of Babenberg]]. That marriage came to an end after half a year with Vladislaus's death in January 1247, and in 1248 Gertrude married the [[House of Z\u00e4hringen| Z\u00e4hringen]] margrave [[Herman VI, Margrave of Baden| Herman VI of Baden]]. Herman, rejected by the Austrian nobility, could not establish his rule. Wenceslaus used this as pretext to invade Austria when Herman died in 1250 \u2014 according to some sources, the estates called upon him to restore order.\n\nWenceslaus released P\u0159emysl Ottokar very soon and in 1251 again made him Margrave of Moravia and installed him, with the approval of the Austrian nobles, as governor of Austria. The same year Ottokar entered Austria, where the estates acclaimed him as Duke. To legitimize his position, P\u0159emysl Ottokar married the late Duke Frederick II's sister [[Margaret of Austria, Queen of Bohemia| Margaret of Babenberg]], who was his senior by 30 years and the widow of the Hohenstaufen king [[Henry (VII) of Germany]].{{sfn|Haverkamp|1988|p= 266}} Their marriage took place on 11 February 1252 at [[Hainburg an der Donau| Hainburg]].{{sfn|Kuthan|1996|p= 14}}\n\nIn 1253 King Wenceslaus died and P\u0159emysl Ottokar succeeded his father as King of Bohemia. After the death of the German King [[Conrad IV of Germany |Konrad IV]] in 1254 while his son Conradin was still a minor, Ottokar also hoped to obtain the Imperial dignity - as [[King of the Romans]] - for himself. However, his election bid was unsuccessful and Count [[William II of Holland]], the German [[anti-king]] since 1247, was generally recognised.\n\n===Building an empire===\n[[File:Karte B\u00f6hmen unter Ottokar II.png|thumb|right|At the peak of his power, Ottokar II's realm stretched from the [[Sudetes]] to the [[Adriatic Sea]].]]\nFeeling threatened by Ottokar's growing regional power beyond the [[Leitha]] River, his cousin King [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary]] challenged the young king. B\u00e9la formed a loose alliance with the [[House of Wittelsbach| Wittelsbach]] duke [[Otto II Wittelsbach, Duke of Bavaria |Otto II of Bavaria]] and tried to install his own son [[Stephen V of Hungary|Stephen]] as Duke of [[Duchy of Styria| Styria]], which since 1192 had been ruled in [[personal union]] with Austria under the terms of the [[Georgenberg Pact]] of 1186. Papal mediation settled the conflict : the parties agreed that Ottokar would yield large parts of Styria to B\u00e9la in exchange for recognition of his right to the remainder of Austria.\n\nSubsequently King Ottokar II led the [[Prussian Crusade |two crusade expeditions]] against the pagan [[Old Prussians]] (1254-1255 and 1268).<ref> [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] (now [[Kaliningrad]], Russia), founded in 1255 by the [[Teutonic Order]], was named in his honour and later became the capital of the [[Duchy of Prussia]].\n\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Gladysz\n | first1 = Mikolaj\n | author-link1 = \n | translator1-last = Barford\n | translator1-first = Paul\n | orig-year = 2002\n | title = The Forgotten Crusaders: Poland and the Crusader Movement in the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries\n | trans-title = Zapomniani krzyzowcy\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=l9R2WMhnHHAC\n | series = The Northern World\n | volume = 56\n | location = Leiden\n | publisher = Brill\n | publication-date = 2012\n | page = 330, 344\n | isbn = 9789004185517\n | access-date = 22 Feb 2019\n | quote = Ottokar II must have been well-remembered in Poland due to his great Prussian crusade in 1254\u201355 [...].

This peace agreement was also sealed by a royal marriage. Ottokar ended his marriage to Margaret and married B\u00e9la's young granddaughter [[Kunigunda of Halych]], who became the mother of his children.{{sfn|Kuthan|1996|p= 17}} The youngest of them became his only legitimate son, [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|Wenceslaus II]].\n\nDuring the Imperial [[Interregnum (Holy Roman Empire)| Imperial ''interregnum'']] of 1250 to 1273, Ottokar could increase his personal influence while Richard of Cornwall and [[Alfonso X of Castile |Alfonso of Castile]] jostled to attain the Imperial dignity. In 1266 he occupied the [[Egerland]] in north-west Bohemia, and in 1268 he signed an inheritance treaty with the [[House of Sponheim| Sponheim]] duke [[Ulrich III, Duke of Carinthia |Ulrich III of Carinthia]], succeeding him in [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], [[March of Carniola|Carniola]] and the [[Windic March]] the next year. In 1272 he also acquired [[Friuli]]. His rule was once again contested by the Hungarians on the field of battle. After [[Peace_of_Pressburg_(1271)| another victory]], Ottokar became the most powerful king within the Empire.\n\n===The path to the final battle===\nAfter Richard of Cornwall died in April 1272 and [[Pope Gregory X]] rejected the claims raised by Alfonso of Castile, a new election for the Imperial German throne took place in 1273. However, the Bohemian king again failed to win the Imperial crown, as the [[Prince-elector |electors]] voted for the \"little count\" [[Rudolf I of Germany |Rudolf of Habsburg]], Ottokar's last and finally victorious rival.\n\nP\u0159emysl Ottokar refused to acknowledge Rudolf's election, and urged the Pope to adopt a similar policy. At a convention of the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)| Imperial Diet]] at [[Nuremberg]] in 1274, Rudolf decreed that all Imperial lands that had changed hands since the death of the last Hohenstaufen emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] must be returned to the crown. This would have deprived Ottokar not only of the Egerland, but also of the Austrian, Styrian, and Carinthian duchies. In 1275 Rudolf placed Ottokar under the [[Imperial ban]] and besieged his [[Hofburg Palace | Hofburg]] residence in [[Vienna]], while a rebellion led by the [[V\u00edtkovci]] noble [[Zavis of Falkenstein]] disrupted the Bohemian lands. This compelled P\u0159emysl Ottokar in November 1276 to sign a new treaty by which he gave up all claims to Austria and the neighboring duchies, retaining for himself only Bohemia and Moravia. Ottokar's son [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia| Wenceslaus]] became  betrothed to Rudolf's daughter [[Judith of Habsburg |Judith]]. There followed an uneasy peace.\n\nTwo years later, the Bohemian king made a last attempt to recover his lost lands by force. P\u0159emysl Ottokar again found allies in Bavaria, [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]] and [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty|Poland]]. He collected a large army to meet the forces of Rudolf and his ally King [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary]] in the [[Battle on the Marchfeld]] on 26 August 1278, where he was defeated and killed.{{sfn|Tucker|2010|p= 289}} Rudolf had his body laid out in state at the [[Minoritenkirche (Vienna)|Minorites Church]] in Vienna. (In 1297 Ottokar's mortal remains were finally transferred to [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] in Prague.) His 6-year-old son Wenceslaus II succeeded him as King of Bohemia.\n\n==Marriage and children==\nOn 11 February 1252, P\u0159emysl Ottokar II married [[Margaret, Duchess of Austria|Margaret of Austria]].{{sfn|Haverkamp|1988|p=266}} Margaret was 26 years older than him and the couple's childless marriage ended with an annulment.{{sfn|Haverkamp|1988|p=266}} On 25 October 1261, Ottokar married [[Kunigunda of Slavonia]].{{sfn|Kuthan|1996|p=17}} They probably had four children:\n\n*Henry (1262\u20131263)\n*[[Kunigunde of Bohemia|Kunigunde]] (January 1265 \u2013 27 November 1321), married [[Boleslaus II of Masovia]]\n*Agnes (5 September 1269 \u2013 17 May 1296), married [[Rudolf II, Duke of Austria]]\n*[[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|Wenceslaus II]] (17 September 1271 \u2013 21 June 1305){{sfn|Sedlar|1994|p=443}}\n\nOttokar also had two extramarital sons and daughters. The most important was his firstborn, [[Nicholas I, Duke of Troppau|Nicholas]].{{sfn|Veszpremy|Schaer|1999|p=153}} He was never accepted as heir apparent to the Bohemian crown by the sitting pope, but was given the [[Duchy of Opava]] as fief in 1269.{{sfn|Veszpremy|Schaer|1999|p=153}} Other illegitimate children include John, provost of [[Vy\u0161ehrad Chapter]].\n\n[[File:King P\u0159emysl Otakar II of Bohemia - Alfons Mucha.jpg|thumb|left|In the painting, ''P\u0159emysl Otakar II: The Union of Slavic Dynasties'', part of [[Alfons Mucha]]'s 20-canvas work ''[[The Slav Epic]]'', Ottokar is depicted at his niece's wedding celebration, forging alliances with other Slavic rulers in attendance.]]\n\n==Legacy==\nP\u0159emysl Ottokar is considered one of the greatest kings of Bohemia, along with [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]]. He was a founder of many new towns (about 30 \u2014 not only in Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia, but also in Austria and Styria) and incorporated many existing settlements through civic charters, giving them new privileges. He was a strong proponent of trade, law and order. Furthermore, he instituted open immigration policies through which skilled German-speaking immigrants settled in major cities throughout his domains. As noted, the historic [[East Prussian]] city of [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] (''King's Mountain'') was named in his honor as a tribute to his support of the Teutonic Knights in their war with the pagan [[Old Prussians]].\n\nAs Czech traditional law was different from that of his other domains, many principles introduced during his reign formed core of the Czech law for the following centuries. From his time stems the oldest preserved source of Czech law, [[Zemsk\u00e9 desky]], and also the oldest written Czech communal law, recorded in the founding deeds of the respective towns. By supporting the city of [[Jihlava]] (German: Iglau) with its mines, he laid foundation of the silver wealth of later Bohemian kings. Privileges of civic charters usually excluded the towns from obedience to the traditional courts held by members of nobility. This can be seen as a step towards equality and a precursor of modern civil law.\n\nIn the country, Ottokar's introduction of the Law of [[Emphyteusis]] into the Czech law is sometimes interpreted as \"Germanization\". In fact it was creative, for it freed subjects from feudal obligations, except for rent \u2014 and tax, if such was levied. Free selling and leaving of estates could also be bought and soon became common. Thus, Ottokar can be reckoned an early Bohemian ruler who furthered Bohemian rights in medieval times. This change of legal environment in Bohemia was introduced by systematic founding of villages chartered under this law.\n\nHe issued also a general privilege to the Jews (1254), which established principles of integration of the Jews into the Czech society until 1848. The Jews were now eligible for various positions, such as servants of crown, thereby being somewhat less subject to discrimination. Instead of being able to claim only the support of individual lords, the Jews could from then on claim support of any royal officer.\n\nOttokar followed with a systematic policy of strengthening his domains by building fortifications. Besides supporting towns, he built many fortresses himself \u2014 [[Zv\u00edkov Castle]], [[K\u0159ivokl\u00e1t Castle]] or [[Bezd\u011bz Castle]] in Bohemia, and the famed [[Hofburg Palace]] in Vienna \u2014 and also induced his vassals to build castles. A sign of rising strength of Bohemia, it was also a reaction to the [[Mongol raids]] of the 13th century (see [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary]]). Conflict for the title of ownership to these fortified places built by members of nobility was probably the source of an uprising in 1276, which cost Ottokar the Austrian lands, and two years later (in an attempt for reconquest) his life.\n\nSome of the fortresses built by Ottokar were for centuries the strongest in Bohemia. Ironically, [[Bezd\u011bz Castle]] served as a prison for his son [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia]] for short time after Ottokar's death. The castle housed Bohemian legal records [[Zemsk\u00e9 desky]] and many spiritual and temporal treasures during the destructive civil strife of the [[Hussite wars]] (1419\u20131434) in Bohemia. It was conquered in 1620, during the [[30 Years' War]], but by then it was long deserted, and in that state was defended by rebelling subjects against an Imperial army.\n\nBefore his conflict with [[Rudolf of Habsburg]], Ottokar exacted influence over a number of relatives, allies and vassals in Germany, such as the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] \u2014 and spiritual principalities, including the [[Archbishopric of Salzburg]] and the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia (state)|Patriarchate of Aquileia]]. After the death of [[Konradin]] in 1268 he was an heir of the [[House of Hohenstaufen]]'s claim to the imperial crown. However, he did not raise this claim, remaining content with informal influence in Germany. In 1267 he was appointed protector of the royal domains (of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]) east of the Rhine by the German king, [[Richard of Cornwall]]. He held this office till 1273.\n\nOttokar is a significant figure in history and legend. In the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' by [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], Ottokar is seen outside the gates of Purgatory, in amiable companionship with his imperial rival Rudolf. He is also the protagonist of a tragedy by the 19th-century Austrian playwright [[Franz Grillparzer]], titled ''[[K\u00f6nig Ottokars Gl\u00fcck und Ende]]''.\n\nThere is a [[Statue of P\u0159emysl Otakar II|statue]] dedicated to him.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Crown of Ottokar II.jpg|Burial crown of Ottokar II of Bohemia at [[Prague Castle]]\nImage:Premyslnahrobek01.jpg|Tomb of Ottokar II in [[St. Vitus Cathedral]], Prague\nImage:Premysl2Gelnhausen.jpg|Ottokar II P\u0159emysl in a miniature from the Gelnhausen Codex\nImage:Jan-Goth-PremyslOtakar.jpg|''Ottokar is accepted as [[Duke of Austria]] in 1251''.
