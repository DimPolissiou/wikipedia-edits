{"title_page": "All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace", "text_new": "{{other uses|All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace (disambiguation)}}\n\"'''All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace'''\" is a poem by [[Richard Brautigan]] first published in his 1967 [[All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace (poetry collection)|collection of the same name]], his fifth book of poetry. It is an enthusiastic description of a [[technological utopianism|technological utopia]] in which machines improve and protect the lives of humans. It is Brautigan's most frequently reprinted poem.\n\n==Synopsis and analysis==\nBrautigan wrote the poem and eponymous collection between January 17-26, 2005, while a poet-in-residence at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in [[Pasadena, California]].<ref name=barbermachines/><ref name=watson/> The poem describes a [[technological utopia]] in which humans and technology work together for the greater good. Brautigan writes about \"[[mammal]]s and [[computer]]s liv[ing] together in mutually [[computer programming|programming]] harmony\", with technology acting as caretakers while \"we are free of our labors and joined back to nature.\"<ref name=madrigal/><ref name=bokinsky/> Reviewers disagree whether it should be taken earnestly or ironically.\n\nMost critics take the poem as a [[counterculture]], [[communitarian]] adoption of [[Cold War]]-era technological visions. Brautigan's publisher, Claude Hayward, said it \"caught me with its magical references to benign machines keeping order ... [which] fit right in with our optimism over the promise of the computer\".<ref name=barberbook/> In Vijay Nambisan's review for ''[[The Hindu]]'' in 2000, he said: \"You cannot write a poem like this today. It is too childlike, too innocent. Indeed, college friends who were moved by Brautigan's work twenty years ago would now laugh at me for choosing it. That's more or less what happened to Brautigan.\"<ref name=nambisan/>\n\nOthers have interpreted it as an ironic, mocking critique of the technologically enabled utopia it purports to long for.<ref name=chicagoreader/><ref name=turner/> According to [[Stanford University|Stanford]]'s Carlos Seligo, there is an irony in the poem that \"is as subtle and complex as his mixed metaphors\", which Seligo says are \"always doing at least three\u2014and often four, five, or six things at once.\"<ref name=seligo/> Robert J. Grangeware noted how unusual it is for [[American poetry|American poets]] to take a positive view of our relationship with technology, but if viewed as ironic it \"joins the mainstream of [[anti-technology|antitechnological]] American verse.\"<ref name=grangeware/>\n\n==Publication history==\nThe poem was first published by the Communication Company in 1967, type-written on an {{convert|8.5|by|11|in|mm|adj=on|0}} mimeographed broadside with both the title and imprint hand-written.<ref name=barbermachines/>\n\nIt was the title poem in the April 1967 [[All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace (collection)|collection of the same name]], published in April 1967. 1,500 copies of the 36-page work were printed at the Communication Company, and all were given away for free.<ref name=barbermachines/>\n\nIt was included with the rest of the contents of the 1967 collection, along with other previously published collections and new material, in ''[[The Pill versus the Springhill Mine Disaster]]'' (1968).<ref name=barberpill/>\n\nBrautigan gave the poem to [[The Diggers (theater)|The Diggers]] to include in their August 1968 pamphlet, ''The Digger Papers''. The 24-page pamphlet was published in ''[[The Realist]]'' issue 81, and another 40,000 copies were printed by the Diggers and given away for free.<ref name=barberwho/>\n\n\"All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace\" is Brautigan's most frequently reprinted poem.<ref name=barberbook/> In the original 1967 publication, Brautigan included a [[copyleft]] statement which retains copyright but grants permission to reprint any poem in ''All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace'' so long as it's given away for free.<ref name=barbermachines/>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe documentary series ''[[All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace (TV series)|All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace]]'' was named after the poem, which is a favorite of director [[Adam Curtis]].

It is an enthusiastic description of a [[technological utopianism|technological utopia]] in which machines improve and protect the lives of humans. It is Brautigan's most frequently reprinted poem.\n\n==Synopsis and analysis==\nBrautigan wrote the poem and eponymous collection between January 17-26, 1967, while a poet-in-residence at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in [[Pasadena, California]].<ref name=barbermachines/><ref name=watson/> The poem describes a [[technological utopia]] in which humans and technology work together for the greater good. Brautigan writes about \"[[mammal]]s and [[computer]]s liv[ing] together in mutually [[computer programming|programming]] harmony\", with technology acting as caretakers while \"we are free of our labors and joined back to nature.\"<ref name=madrigal/><ref name=bokinsky/> Reviewers disagree whether it should be taken earnestly or ironically.\n\nMost critics take the poem as a [[counterculture]], [[communitarian]] adoption of [[Cold War]]-era technological visions. Brautigan's publisher, Claude Hayward, said it \"caught me with its magical references to benign machines keeping order ... [which] fit right in with our optimism over the promise of the computer\".<ref name=barberbook/> In Vijay Nambisan's review for ''[[The Hindu]]'' in 2000, he said: \"You cannot write a poem like this today. It is too childlike, too innocent. Indeed, college friends who were moved by Brautigan's work twenty years ago would now laugh at me for choosing it. That's more or less what happened to Brautigan.\"<ref name=nambisan/>\n\nOthers have interpreted it as an ironic, mocking critique of the technologically enabled utopia it purports to long for.<ref name=chicagoreader/><ref name=turner/> According to [[Stanford University|Stanford]]'s Carlos Seligo, there is an irony in the poem that \"is as subtle and complex as his mixed metaphors\", which Seligo says are \"always doing at least three\u2014and often four, five, or six things at once.\"<ref name=seligo/> Robert J. Grangeware noted how unusual it is for [[American poetry|American poets]] to take a positive view of our relationship with technology, but if viewed as ironic it \"joins the mainstream of [[anti-technology|antitechnological]] American verse.\"<ref name=grangeware/>\n\n==Publication history==\nThe poem was first published by the Communication Company in 1967, type-written on an {{convert|8.5|by|11|in|mm|adj=on|0}} mimeographed broadside with both the title and imprint hand-written.<ref name=barbermachines/>\n\nIt was the title poem in the April 1967 [[All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace (collection)|collection of the same name]], published in April 1967. 1,500 copies of the 36-page work were printed at the Communication Company, and all were given away for free.<ref name=barbermachines/>\n\nIt was included with the rest of the contents of the 1967 collection, along with other previously published collections and new material, in ''[[The Pill versus the Springhill Mine Disaster]]'' (1968).<ref name=barberpill/>\n\nBrautigan gave the poem to [[The Diggers (theater)|The Diggers]] to include in their August 1968 pamphlet, ''The Digger Papers''. The 24-page pamphlet was published in ''[[The Realist]]'' issue 81, and another 40,000 copies were printed by the Diggers and given away for free.<ref name=barberwho/>\n\n\"All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace\" is Brautigan's most frequently reprinted poem.<ref name=barberbook/> In the original 1967 publication, Brautigan included a [[copyleft]] statement which retains copyright but grants permission to reprint any poem in ''All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace'' so long as it's given away for free.<ref name=barbermachines/>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe documentary series ''[[All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace (TV series)|All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace]]'' was named after the poem, which is a favorite of director [[Adam Curtis]]. Its second part includes a recording of Brautigan doing a reading. According to the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'', \"For all the frenzy of the images, what dominates the sequence are Brautigan's voice and the languid piece of symphonic music on the soundtrack.\"<ref name=chicagoreader/>\n\nAt the [[Palais de Tokyo]], the poem inspired a show of the same name in 2017, curated by Yoann Gourmel.

Corrective lenses for myopia have negative powers because a divergent lens is required to move the [[far point]] of focus out to the distance. More severe myopia needs lens powers further from zero (more negative). However, strong eyeglass prescriptions create distortions such as prismatic movement and [[chromatic aberration]].

Corrective lenses for myopia have negative powers because a divergent lens is required to move the [[far point]] of focus out to the distance. More severe myopia needs lens powers further from zero (more negative). However, strong eyeglass prescriptions create distortions such as prismatic movement and [[chromatic aberration]].

The single is from Montana's third studio album, ''[[Montana (album)|Montana]]''.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nRvssian has had an interest in music from an early age, learning to play the piano and drums from his father Michael 'Micron' Johnston, the founder of Micron Music Limited.<ref>[http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20110607/life/life3.html Jamming with Michael Johnston | Lifestyle]. Jamaica Gleaner (7 June 2011). Retrieved on 9 December 2015.</ref> In December 2007, Rvssian decided to set up Head Concussion Records, a music production studio located in [[Kingston, Jamaica]].\n\nAfter graduating from [[ Ardenne High School]], Rvssian enrolled in the [[Edna Manley College of the Visual and Performing Arts]]. It was during this period that he met Vybz Kartel through fellow producers Jordan McClure (Chimney Records) and Stephen '[[Di Genius]]' McGregor.\nIn 2008, Rvssian created his first rhythm \"Liberty Riddim\", which featured [[Konshens]]' \"Ago Kill Me\" and [[Vybz Kartel]]'s \"Nah Hold We Down.\"\n\nTwo years later, Rvssian produced \"Life Sweet\" for [[Vybz Kartel]]. To develop his music career further, Rvssian decided to leave the [[Edna Manley]] College for Visual and Performing Arts.<ref name=\"jamaicaobserver1\"/>\n\n== Working with Vybz Kartel ==\n\nIn the wake of 2010, Rvssian and [[Vybz Kartel]] teamed up on the single \"Straight Jeans and Fitted.\" The song received over 25 million views on [[YouTube]] and went on to win \"Favorite Music Collaboration\" in the Feb 2011 Youth View Awards.<ref>[http://www.davibejamaica.com/actualites/1583-vybz-kartel-russian-youth-view-awards.html Vybz Kartel & Russian \u2013 Youth View Awards].

The latter, released in 2014 was recorded before [[Vybz Kartel]] went to prison.<ref>[http://urbanislandz.com/2014/12/18/video-vybz-kartel-rvssian-new-jordans/ VIDEO: Vybz Kartel & Rvssian \u2013 New Jordans \u2013 Urban Islandz].

The latter proved problematic due to the ambiguity and the fact that search engines displayed results relating to [[Russia]] (the country) and its citizens ([[Russians]]), making it hard to find Tarik \"RUSSIAN\" Johnston, the [[Record producer|music producer]]. This led to a name rebrand with Johnston altering the spelling, replacing \"U\" with \"V\". The pronunciation of \"RUSSIAN\" was however retained in \"Rvssian\".\n\n== Head Concussion Records ==\n\nShortly after forming Head Concussion Records in December 2007, Rvssian released a number of songs, working with notable dancehall acts like [[Demarco (musician)|Demarco]], [[Tarrus Riley]] and Blak Ryno.
