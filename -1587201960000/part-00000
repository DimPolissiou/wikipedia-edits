A popular destination for hiking, trail running, and mountain biking, these trails vary in difficulty. Sections can be challenging for users not acclimatized to the altitude or climate. The trail system is well marked, junctions include section maps and arrows to nearby junctions.\n\n== Trailheads and Access ==\n\n[[File:Sierra del Norte.jpg|thumb|Sierra del Norte trailhead sign]]\n\nAccess to the Dale Ball trail system can be made via dedicated trailheads or adjoining trails. The Cerro Gordo trailhead is located at the intersection of Upper Canyon and Cerro Gordo road. It has limited parking, and gives direct access to the Central and South Sections as well as the Nature Conservancy\u2019s [[Santa Fe Canyon Preserve Trail]]. The Sierra del Norte trailhead is located at the intersection of Hyde Park Road and Sierra Del Norte and provides ample parking. This trailhead serves the North and the Central sections of the trail system. The Dorothy Stewart trailhead, and Wilderness Gate trailhead, both located at Camino de Cruz Blanca, serve the Dorothy Stewart trails which connect to Dale Ball trails. Dale Ball trails can also be accessed from the [[Atalaya trail]], and the [[Little Tesuque Trail]] via La Piedra Trail.\n\n== Trail Information ==\n\nThere are maps available for download <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.santafenm.gov/trails_1|title=Trails &#124; City of Santa Fe, New Mexico|website=www.santafenm.gov}}</ref> at the city of Santa Fe website, and paper maps for free at the visitor center at 210 W Marcy Street. The Dale Ball trail system can be broken up into three sections: North, Central and  South. The landscape is undulating with [[juniper]], [[pinyon pine|pi\u00f1on]], [[yucca]] and [[Cylindropuntia|cholla]] cactus on the North and Central section, typical of a [[pinyon-juniper woodland]], while on the south section one can see ponderosa, white fir and douglas fir at higher elevations. The south section can be challenging due to baseline altitude and elevation gain. Picacho Peak (8,577ft) and Atalaya Mountain (9,121ft) are popular destinations on the southern section of the trail system.\n\n== Trail Conditions and precautions ==\n\nThe baseline elevation at the trailhead, the high desert conditions, and potential elevation gain, warrants some caution from the user. Overall the trail is well maintained and well marked, but connecting trails may not be.\n\n== Events ==\n\nThe \"Dale Ball Buster\", a running event, gained some notoriety due to a [[Runner's World|Runner's World magazine]] article written in 2012 <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.runnersworld.com/trail-running/a20821625/dale-ball-trails-santa-fe-new-mexico/|title=Dale Ball Trails, Santa Fe, New Mexico|first=Leslie|last=Kehmeier|date=October 30, 2012|website=Runner's World}}</ref>.

It is a pale blue gas with a distinctively [[pungent]] smell. It is an [[allotrope]] of [[oxygen]] that is much less stable than the [[diatomic]] allotrope {{Chem|O|2}}, breaking down in the lower atmosphere to {{Chem|O|2}} ([[dioxygen]]). Ozone is formed from dioxygen by the action of [[ultraviolet light]] (UV) and  electrical discharges within the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. It is present in very low concentrations throughout the latter, with its highest concentration high in the [[ozone layer]] of the [[stratosphere]], which absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation.\n\nOzone's odour is reminiscent of [[chlorine]], and detectable by many people at concentrations of as little as {{val|0.1|ul=ppm}} in air. Ozone's O<sub>3</sub> structure was determined in 1865. The molecule was later proven to have a bent structure and to be [[diamagnetic]]. In [[standard conditions]], ozone is a pale blue gas that condenses at progressively cryogenic temperatures to a dark blue [[liquid]] and finally a violet-black [[solid]]. Ozone's instability with regard to more common dioxygen is such that both concentrated gas and liquid ozone may decompose explosively at elevated temperatures or fast warming to the boiling point.<ref name=streng>{{Cite journal\n| doi = 10.1021/je00103a031\n| volume = 6\n| issue = 3\n| pages = 431\u2013436\n| last1 = Streng\n| first1 = A. G.\n| title = Tables of Ozone Properties\n| journal = [[Journal of Chemical & Engineering Data]]\n| year = 1961 }}</ref>\nIt is therefore used commercially only in low concentrations.\n\nOzone is a powerful [[Oxidizing agent|oxidant]] (far more so than [[dioxygen]]) and has many industrial and consumer applications related to oxidation. This same high oxidizing potential, however, causes ozone to damage mucous and respiratory tissues in animals, and also tissues in plants, above concentrations of about {{val|0.1|u=ppm}}. While this makes ozone a potent respiratory hazard and pollutant near ground level, a higher concentration in the ozone layer (from two to eight ppm) is beneficial, preventing damaging UV light from reaching the Earth's surface.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nThe [[trivial name]] ''ozone'' is the most commonly used and [[preferred IUPAC name]]. The systematic names ''2\u03bb<sup>4</sup>-trioxidiene''{{dubious|date=February 2019}} and ''catena-trioxygen'', valid [[IUPAC]] names, are constructed according to the substitutive and additive nomenclatures, respectively. The name ''ozone'' derives from ''ozein'' (\u1f44\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd), the [[greek language|Greek]] verb for smell, referring to ozone's distinctive smell.\n\nIn appropriate contexts, ozone can be viewed as [[trioxidane]] with two hydrogen atoms removed, and as such, ''trioxidanylidene'' may be used as a systematic name, according to substitutive nomenclature. By default, these names pay no regard to the radicality of the ozone molecule. In an even more specific context, this can also name the non-radical singlet ground state, whereas the diradical state is named ''trioxidanediyl''.\n\n''Trioxidanediyl'' (or ''ozonide'') is used, non-systematically, to refer to the substituent group (-OOO-). Care should be taken to avoid confusing the name of the group for the context-specific name for the ozone given above.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sch\u00f6nbein.jpg|right|thumb|[[Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein]] (18 October 1799 \u2013 29 August 1868)]]\n[[File:Smyths revised ozonometer, 1865.

While shorter wavelength light, extending to even the X-Ray limit, is energetic enough to dissociate molecular oxygen, there is relatively little of it, and, the strong solar emission at Lyman-alpha, 121&nbsp;nm, falls at a point where molecular oxygen absorption is a minimum.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://joseba.mpch-mainz.mpg.de/spectral_atlas_data/cross_sections_plots/Oxygen/O2_Lyman%20alpha%20line_lin.jpg|title = The MPI-Mainz UV/VIS Spectral Atlas of Gaseous Molecules of Atmospheric Interest: O2, Lyman-alpha|last = Keller-Rudek|first = Hannelore|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015120/http://joseba.mpch-mainz.mpg.de/spectral_atlas_data/cross_sections_plots/Oxygen/O2_Lyman%20alpha%20line_lin.jpg|archivedate = 2015-11-17}}</ref>\n\nThe process of ozone creation and destruction is called the [[Chapman cycle]] and starts with the photolysis of molecular oxygen\n\n: <chem>O2 ->[\\ce{photon}][(\\ce{radiation}\\ \\lambda\\ <\\ 240\\ \\ce{nm})] 2O</chem>\nfollowed by reaction of the oxygen atom with another molecule of oxygen to form ozone.\n:O + {{chem|O|2}} + M \u2192 {{chem|O|3}} + M\n\nwhere \"M\" denotes the third body that carries off the excess energy of the reaction.

This conversion of UV light into kinetic energy warms the stratosphere. The oxygen atoms produced in the photolysis of ozone then react back with other oxygen molecule as in the previous step to form more ozone.

The termination reaction is [[catalysis|catalysed]] by the presence of certain free radicals, of which the most important are hydroxyl (OH), nitric oxide (NO) and atomic chlorine (Cl) and bromine (Br). In the second half of the 20th Century the amount of ozone in the stratosphere was discovered to be declining, mostly because of increasing concentrations of [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFC) and similar [[Haloalkane|chlorinated and brominated organic molecules]]. The concern over the health effects of the decline led to the 1987 [[Montreal Protocol]], the ban on the production of many [[Ozone depletion|ozone depleting]] chemicals and in the first and second decade of the 21st Century the beginning of the recovery of stratospheric ozone concentrations.\n\n{{See also|Ozone-oxygen cycle|Ozone depletion}}\n\n====Importance to surface-dwelling life on Earth====\n[[Image:Ozone altitude UV graph.svg|thumb|Levels of ozone at various altitudes and blocking of different bands of ultraviolet radiation.

The small unabsorbed part that remains of UV-B after passage through ozone causes sunburn in humans, and direct DNA damage in living tissues in both plants and animals. Ozone's effect on mid-range UV-B rays is illustrated by its effect on UV-B at 290&nbsp;nm, which has a radiation intensity 350 million times as powerful at the top of the atmosphere as at the surface. Nevertheless, enough of UV-B radiation at similar frequency reaches the ground to cause some sunburn, and these same wavelengths are also among those responsible for the production of [[vitamin D]] in humans.\n\nThe ozone layer has little effect on the longer UV wavelengths called UV-A (315\u2013400&nbsp;nm), but this radiation does not cause sunburn or direct DNA damage, and while it probably does cause long-term skin damage in certain humans, it is not as dangerous to plants and to the health of surface-dwelling organisms on Earth in general (see [[ultraviolet]] for more information on near ultraviolet).\n\n===Low level ozone===\n{{Main|Tropospheric ozone|Photochemical smog}}\n\nLow level ozone (or tropospheric ozone) is an atmospheric pollutant.<ref name=who-Europe>[http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/112199/E79097.pdf Health Aspects of Air Pollution with Particulate Matter, Ozone and Nitrogen Dioxide].

The nonattainment standard indicates that an area does not meet the EPA's air quality standards. The Colorado Ozone Action Plan was created in response, and numerous changes were implemented from this plan. The first major change was that car emission testing was expanded across the state to more counties that did not previously mandate emissions testing, like areas of Larimer and Weld County. There have also been changes made to decrease Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions, which should help lower ozone levels.\n\nOne large contributor to high ozone levels in the area is the OIl and Natural Gas industry situated in the Denver-Julesburg Basin (DJB) which overlaps with a majority of Colorado's metropolitan areas.

[[Fuel line]]s made of reinforced rubber are also susceptible to attack, especially within the engine compartment, where some ozone is produced by electrical components. Storing rubber products in close proximity to a [[Direct Current|DC]] [[electric motor]] can accelerate ozone cracking. The [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] of the motor generates sparks which in turn produce ozone.\n\n====Ozone as a greenhouse gas====\nAlthough ozone was present at ground level before the [[Industrial Revolution]], peak concentrations are now far higher than the pre-industrial levels, and even background concentrations well away from sources of pollution are substantially higher.<ref>{{cite web|year=1998|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/TOP08-98/page004.html|title=Tropospheric Ozone in EU \u2013 The consolidated report|publisher=European Environmental Agency|accessdate=2006-05-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Atmospheric Chemistry and Greenhouse Gases|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/142.htm|publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|accessdate=2006-05-10|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710143636/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/142.htm|archivedate=2006-07-10}}</ref> Ozone acts as a [[greenhouse gas]], absorbing some of the [[infrared]] energy emitted by the earth.

Despite high levels in the lung tissues, however, their ability to clear bacteria appears impaired by exposure to ozone.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe adaptive immune system is the branch of immunity that provides long-term protection via the development of antibodies targeting specific pathogens and is also impacted by high ozone exposure.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/><ref name=\"Travers P 2001\"/> Lymphocytes, a cellular component of the adaptive immune response, produce an increased amount of inflammatory chemicals called \"cytokines\" after exposure to ozone, which may contribute to airway hyperreactivity and worsening asthma symptoms.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe airway epithelial cells also play an important role in protecting individuals from pathogens. In normal tissue, the epithelial layer forms a protective barrier, and also contains specialized ciliary structures that work to clear foreign bodies, mucus and pathogens from the lungs. When exposed to ozone, the cilia become damaged and mucociliary clearance of pathogens is reduced. Furthermore, the epithelial barrier becomes weakened, allowing pathogens to cross the barrier, proliferate and spread into deeper tissues. Together, these changes in the epithelial barrier help make individuals more susceptible to pulmonary infections.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nInhaling ozone not only affects the immune system and lungs, but it may also affect the heart as well.

The Canadian Centre for Occupation Safety and Health reports that:\n\n<blockquote>Even very low concentrations of ozone can be harmful to the upper respiratory tract and the lungs. The severity of injury depends on both by the concentration of ozone and the duration of exposure. Severe and permanent lung injury or death could result from even a very short-term exposure to relatively low concentrations.\"<ref>[http://www.the-o-zone.cc/research/abstracts/OSHC.pdf What are the main health hazards associated with breathing in ozone?], Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety</ref></blockquote>\n\nTo protect workers potentially exposed to ozone, [[U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] has established a permissible exposure limit (PEL) of 0.1 \u03bcmol/mol (29 CFR 1910.1000 table Z-1), calculated as an 8-hour time weighted average. Higher concentrations are especially hazardous and [[NIOSH]] has established an Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health Limit (IDLH) of 5 \u03bcmol/mol.<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/intridl4.html Documentation for Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health Concentrations (IDLH)]: NIOSH Chemical Listing and Documentation of Revised IDLH Values (as of 3/1/95)</ref> Work environments where ozone is used or where it is likely to be produced should have adequate ventilation and it is prudent to have a monitor for ozone that will alarm if the concentration exceeds the OSHA PEL.

H. Johnston Ozone Production.jpg|thumb|right | Ozone production demonstration, Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory, 1926]]\n\nOzone generators are used to produce ozone for cleaning air or removing smoke odours in unoccupied rooms. These ozone generators can produce over 3 g of ozone per hour. Ozone often forms in nature under conditions where O<sub>2</sub> will not react.<ref name=brown/> Ozone used in industry is measured in \u03bcmol/mol (ppm, parts per million), nmol/mol (ppb, parts per billion), \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, mg/h (milligrams per hour) or weight percent. The regime of applied concentrations ranges from 1% to 5% (in air) and from 6% to 14% (in oxygen) for older generation methods. New electrolytic methods can achieve up 20% to 30% dissolved ozone concentrations in output water.\n\nTemperature and humidity play a large role in how much ozone is being produced using traditional generation methods (such as corona discharge and ultraviolet light). Old generation methods will produce less than 50% of nominal capacity if operated with humid ambient air, as opposed to very dry air. New generators, using electrolytic methods, can achieve higher purity and dissolution through using water molecules as the source of ozone production.\n\n===Corona discharge method===\n[[File:Shkarkese elektrike.jpg|thumb|A homemade ozone generator. Ozone is produced in the corona discharge|alt=]]\nThis is the most common type of ozone generator for most industrial and personal uses. While variations of the \"hot spark\" coronal discharge method of ozone production exist, including medical grade and industrial grade ozone generators, these units usually work by means of a [[Corona discharge|corona discharge tube]] or ozone plate.<ref>https://www.a2zozone.com/blogs/news/ozone-tube-vs-ozone-plate</ref><ref>{{OrgSynth|last1=Smith|first1=L.

Fluctuations in ambient air, due to weather or other environmental conditions, cause variability in ozone production. However, they also produce [[nitrogen oxide]]s as a by-product. Use of an [[air dryer]] can reduce or eliminate nitric acid formation by removing water vapor and increase ozone production. At room temperature, nitric acid will form into a vapour that is hazardous if inhaled. Symptoms can include chest pain, shortness of breath, headaches and a dry nose and throat causing a burning sensation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Best Ozone Generator Reviews and Guide 2019 |url=https://www.freshairguide.com/best-ozone-generator/#ozgenfaq |website=www.freshairguide.com}}</ref> Use of an [[oxygen concentrator]] can further increase the ozone production and further reduce the risk of nitric acid formation by removing not only the water vapor, but also the bulk of the nitrogen.\n\n===Ultraviolet light===\n{{See also|Photochemistry}}\nUV ozone generators, or vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) ozone generators, employ a light source that generates a narrow-band ultraviolet light, a subset of that produced by the Sun. The Sun's UV sustains the ozone layer in the stratosphere of Earth.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Dohan |first=J. M. |author2=W. J. Masschelein |year=1987 |journal=Ozone Sci. Eng.|title=Photochemical Generation of Ozone: Present State-of-the-Art |volume=9 |pages=315\u2013334 |doi=10.1080/01919518708552147 |issue=4}}</ref>\n\nUV ozone generators use ambient air for ozone production, no air prep systems are used (air dryer or oxygen concentrator), therefore these generators tend to be less expensive. However, UV ozone generators usually produce ozone with a concentration of about 0.5% or lower which limits the potential ozone production rate. Another disadvantage of this method is that it requires the ambient air (oxygen) to be exposed to the UV source for a longer amount of time, and any gas that is not exposed to the UV source will not be treated. This makes UV generators impractical for use in situations that deal with rapidly moving air or water streams (in-duct air [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]], for example). Production of ozone is one of the [[ultraviolet germicidal irradiation#Potential dangers|potential dangers]] of [[ultraviolet germicidal irradiation]]. VUV ozone generators are used in swimming pools and [[spa]] applications ranging to millions of gallons of water. VUV ozone generators, unlike corona discharge generators, do not produce harmful nitrogen by-products and also unlike corona discharge systems, VUV ozone generators work extremely well in humid air environments. There is also not normally a need for expensive off-gas mechanisms, and no need for air driers or oxygen concentrators which require extra costs and maintenance.\n\n===Cold plasma===\nIn the cold plasma method, pure oxygen gas is exposed to a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] created by [[dielectric barrier discharge]]. The diatomic oxygen is split into single atoms, which then recombine in triplets to form ozone.\n\nCold plasma machines utilize pure oxygen as the input source and produce a maximum concentration of about 5% ozone. They produce far greater quantities of ozone in a given space of time compared to ultraviolet production. However, because cold plasma ozone generators are very expensive, they are found less frequently than the previous two types.\n\nThe discharges manifest as filamentary transfer of electrons (micro discharges) in a gap between two electrodes. In order to evenly distribute the micro discharges, a dielectric [[Electrical insulation|insulator]] must be used to separate the metallic electrodes and to prevent arcing.\n\nSome cold plasma units also have the capability of producing short-lived allotropes of oxygen which include O<sub>4</sub>, O<sub>5</sub>, O<sub>6</sub>, O<sub>7</sub>, etc. These species are even more reactive than ordinary {{chem|O|3}}.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gujral|display-authors=etal|first=Sarbjeet Singh|year=2013|title=Ozone Therapy: A Milestone in the Treatment of Ailments|url=http://www.iglobaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/8.-Sarbjeet-S-Gujral-et-al-IGJPS-2013_edited.pdf|journal=Indo Global Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences|volume=3 |issue=2|pages=167\u2013173|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Electrolytic===\nElectrolytic ozone generation (EOG) splits water molecules into H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub>.\nIn most EOG methods, the hydrogen gas will be removed to leave oxygen and ozone as the only reaction products. Therefore, EOG can achieve higher [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] in water without other competing gases found in corona discharge method, such as nitrogen gases present in ambient air. This method of generation can achieve concentrations of 20\u201330% and is independent of air quality because water is used as the source material. Production of ozone electrolytically is typically unfavorable because of the high [[overpotential]] required to produce ozone as compared to oxygen. This is why ozone is not produced during typical water electrolysis. However, it is possible to increase the overpotential of oxygen by careful catalyst selection such that ozone is preferentially produced under electrolysis. Catalysts typically chosen for this approach are [[lead dioxide]]<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Foller, Peter C. |author2=Tobias, Charles W. |title=The Anodic Evolution of Ozone|journal=Journal of the Electrochemical Society|volume=129|issue=3|pages=506|doi=10.1149/1.2123890|year=1982}}</ref> or boron-doped diamond.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Arihara, Kazuki |author2=Terashima, Chiaki |author3=Fujishimam Akira |title= Electrochemical Production of High-Concentration Ozone-Water Using Freestanding Perforated Diamond Electrodes|journal= Journal of the Electrochemical Society|volume= 154|issue= 4|pages= E71|doi= 10.1149/1.2509385|year= 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe ozone to oxygen ratio is improved by increasing current density at the anode, cooling the electrolyte around the anode close to 0&nbsp;\u00b0C, using an acidic electrolyte (such as dilute sulfuric acid) instead of a basic solution, and by applying pulsed current instead of DC.<ref name=\"Hale1919\">{{cite book|last=Hale |first=Arthur J. |title=The Manufacture of Chemicals by Electrolysis|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eDNDAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=12 September 2019|year=1919|publisher=D. Van Nostrand Co.|pages=15, 16}}</ref>\n\n===Special considerations===\nOzone cannot be stored and transported like other industrial gases (because it quickly decays into diatomic oxygen) and must therefore be produced on site. Available ozone generators vary in the arrangement and design of the high-voltage electrodes. At production capacities higher than 20&nbsp;kg per hour, a gas/water tube heat-exchanger may be utilized as ground electrode and assembled with tubular high-voltage electrodes on the gas-side. The regime of typical gas pressures is around {{convert|2|bar|lk=on}} absolute in oxygen and {{convert|3|bar}} absolute in air. Several megawatts of [[electric power|electrical power]] may be installed in large facilities, applied as one phase AC [[Electric current|current]] at 50 to 8000&nbsp;Hz and peak [[voltage]]s between 3,000 and 20,000 volts. Applied voltage is usually inversely related to the applied frequency.\n\nThe dominating parameter influencing ozone generation efficiency is the gas temperature, which is controlled by cooling water temperature and/or gas velocity. The cooler the water, the better the ozone synthesis. The lower the gas velocity, the higher the concentration (but the lower the net ozone produced). At typical industrial conditions, almost 90% of the effective power is dissipated as heat and needs to be removed by a sufficient cooling water flow.\n\nBecause of the high reactivity of ozone, only a few materials may be used like [[stainless steel]] (quality 316L), [[titanium]], [[aluminium]] (as long as no moisture is present), [[glass]], [[polytetrafluorethylene]], or [[polyvinylidene fluoride]]. [[Viton]] may be used with the restriction of constant mechanical forces and absence of humidity (humidity limitations apply depending on the formulation). [[Hypalon]] may be used with the restriction that no water comes in contact with it, except for normal atmospheric levels. [[Embrittlement]] or shrinkage is the common mode of failure of elastomers with exposure to ozone. Ozone cracking is the common mode of failure of elastomer seals like [[O-rings]].\n\n[[Silicone rubber]]s are usually adequate for use as [[gaskets]] in ozone concentrations below 1 wt%, such as in equipment for accelerated aging of rubber samples.\n\n===Incidental production===\nOzone may be formed from {{chem|O|2}} by electrical discharges and by action of high energy [[electromagnetic radiation]]. [[Arc suppression|Unsuppressed arcing]] in electrical contacts, motor brushes, or mechanical switches breaks down the chemical bonds of the atmospheric oxygen surrounding the contacts [{{chem|O|2}} \u2192 2O].

[[Electric motor]]s using [[brush (electric)|brush]]es can generate ozone from repeated [[spark gap|spark]]ing inside the unit.

Oxygen formation is a competing reaction.\n\nIt can also be generated by a [[high voltage]] [[Electric arc|arc]]. In its simplest form, high voltage AC, such as the output of a [[neon-sign transformer]] is connected to two metal rods with the ends placed sufficiently close to each other to allow an arc. The resulting arc will convert atmospheric oxygen to ozone.\n\nIt is often desirable to contain the ozone. This can be done with an apparatus consisting of two concentric glass tubes sealed together at the top with gas ports at the top and bottom of the outer tube. The inner core should have a length of metal foil inserted into it connected to one side of the power source. The other side of the power source should be connected to another piece of foil wrapped around the outer tube. A source of dry  {{chem|O|2}} is applied to the bottom port. When high voltage is applied to the foil leads, [[electricity]] will discharge between the dry dioxygen in the middle and form {{chem|O|3}} and {{chem|O|2}} which will flow out the top port.

This kind of air purifier is sometimes claimed to imitate nature's way of purifying the air without filters and to sanitize both it and household surfaces. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has declared that there is \"evidence to show that at concentrations that do not exceed public health standards, ozone is not effective at removing many odor-causing chemicals\" or \"viruses, bacteria, mold, or other biological pollutants\". Furthermore, its report states that \"results of some controlled studies show that concentrations of ozone considerably higher than these [human safety] standards are possible even when a user follows the manufacturer's operating instructions\".<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/ozonegen.html EPA report on consumer ozone air purifiers].

According to the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), it is \"amending the [[food additive]] regulations to provide for the safe use of ozone in gaseous and aqueous phases as an [[Antimicrobial|antimicrobial agent]] on food, including meat and poultry.\" Studies at [[California Polytechnic State University|California Polytechnic University]] demonstrated that 0.3 \u03bcmol/mol levels of ozone dissolved in filtered tapwater can produce a reduction of more than 99.99% in such food-borne microorganisms as salmonella, ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 and ''Campylobacter''.

Since ozone does not remain in the water long enough, ozone by itself is ineffective at preventing cross-contamination among bathers and must be used in conjunction with [[halogens]]. Gaseous ozone created by ultraviolet light or by corona discharge is injected into the water.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/mdbp/upload/2001_07_13_mdbp_alternative_disinfectants_guidance.pdf |title=Alternative Disinfectants and Oxidant Guidance Manual|date=April 1999|publisher = [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |accessdate=2008-01-14 }}</ref>\n\nOzone is also widely used in the treatment of water in aquariums and fishponds. Its use can minimize bacterial growth, control parasites, eliminate transmission of some diseases, and reduce or eliminate \"yellowing\" of the water. Ozone must not come in contact with fishes' gill structures. Natural saltwater (with life forms) provides enough \"instantaneous demand\" that controlled amounts of ozone activate bromide ions to [[hypobromous acid]], and the ozone entirely decays in a few seconds to minutes. If oxygen-fed ozone is used, the water will be higher in dissolved oxygen and fishes' gill structures will atrophy, making them dependent on oxygen-enriched water.\n\n===Aquaculture===\nOzonation \u2013 a process of infusing water with ozone \u2013 can be used in aquaculture to facilitate organic breakdown.

It is a pale blue gas with a distinctively [[pungent]] smell. It is an [[allotrope]] of [[oxygen]] that is much less stable than the [[diatomic]] allotrope {{Chem|O|2}}, breaking down in the lower atmosphere to {{Chem|O|2}} ([[dioxygen]]). Ozone is formed from dioxygen by the action of [[ultraviolet light]] (UV) and  electrical discharges within the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. It is present in very low concentrations throughout the latter, with its highest concentration high in the [[ozone layer]] of the [[stratosphere]], which absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation.\n\nOzone's odour is reminiscent of [[chlorine]], and detectable by many people at concentrations of as little as {{val|0.1|ul=ppm}} in air. Ozone's O<sub>3</sub> structure was determined in 1865. The molecule was later proven to have a bent structure and to be [[diamagnetic]]. In [[standard conditions]], ozone is a pale blue gas that condenses at progressively cryogenic temperatures to a dark blue [[liquid]] and finally a violet-black [[solid]]. Ozone's instability with regard to more common dioxygen is such that both concentrated gas and liquid ozone may decompose explosively at elevated temperatures or fast warming to the boiling point.<ref name=streng>{{Cite journal\n| doi = 10.1021/je00103a031\n| volume = 6\n| issue = 3\n| pages = 431\u2013436\n| last1 = Streng\n| first1 = A.

This same high oxidizing potential, however, causes ozone to damage mucous and respiratory tissues in animals, and also tissues in plants, above concentrations of about {{val|0.1|u=ppm}}. While this makes ozone a potent respiratory hazard and pollutant near ground level, a higher concentration in the ozone layer (from two to eight ppm) is beneficial, preventing damaging UV light from reaching the Earth's surface.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nThe [[trivial name]] ''ozone'' is the most commonly used and [[preferred IUPAC name]]. The systematic names ''2\u03bb<sup>4</sup>-trioxidiene''{{dubious|date=February 2019}} and ''catena-trioxygen'', valid [[IUPAC]] names, are constructed according to the substitutive and additive nomenclatures, respectively. The name ''ozone'' derives from ''ozein'' (\u1f44\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd), the [[greek language|Greek]] verb for smell, referring to ozone's distinctive smell.\n\nIn appropriate contexts, ozone can be viewed as [[trioxidane]] with two hydrogen atoms removed, and as such, ''trioxidanylidene'' may be used as a systematic name, according to substitutive nomenclature. By default, these names pay no regard to the radicality of the ozone molecule. In an even more specific context, this can also name the non-radical singlet ground state, whereas the diradical state is named ''trioxidanediyl''.\n\n''Trioxidanediyl'' (or ''ozonide'') is used, non-systematically, to refer to the substituent group (-OOO-). Care should be taken to avoid confusing the name of the group for the context-specific name for the ozone given above.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sch\u00f6nbein.jpg|right|thumb|[[Christian Friedrich Sch\u00f6nbein]] (18 October 1799 \u2013 29 August 1868)]]\n[[File:Smyths revised ozonometer, 1865.

While shorter wavelength light, extending to even the X-Ray limit, is energetic enough to dissociate molecular oxygen, there is relatively little of it, and, the strong solar emission at Lyman-alpha, 121&nbsp;nm, falls at a point where molecular oxygen absorption is a minimum.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://joseba.mpch-mainz.mpg.de/spectral_atlas_data/cross_sections_plots/Oxygen/O2_Lyman%20alpha%20line_lin.jpg|title = The MPI-Mainz UV/VIS Spectral Atlas of Gaseous Molecules of Atmospheric Interest: O2, Lyman-alpha|last = Keller-Rudek|first = Hannelore|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015120/http://joseba.mpch-mainz.mpg.de/spectral_atlas_data/cross_sections_plots/Oxygen/O2_Lyman%20alpha%20line_lin.jpg|archivedate = 2015-11-17}}</ref>\n\nThe process of ozone creation and destruction is called the [[Chapman cycle]] and starts with the photolysis of molecular oxygen\n\n: <chem>O2 ->[\\ce{photon}][(\\ce{radiation}\\ \\lambda\\ <\\ 240\\ \\ce{nm})] 2O</chem>\nfollowed by reaction of the oxygen atom with another molecule of oxygen to form ozone.\n:O + {{chem|O|2}} + M \u2192 {{chem|O|3}} + M\n\nwhere \"M\" denotes the third body that carries off the excess energy of the reaction.

This conversion of UV light into kinetic energy warms the stratosphere. The oxygen atoms produced in the photolysis of ozone then react back with other oxygen molecule as in the previous step to form more ozone. In the clear atmosphere, with only nitrogen and oxygen, ozone can react with the atomic oxygen to form two molecules of O<sub>2</sub>\n\n:{{chem|O|3}} + O \u2192 2 {{chem|O|2}}\n\nAn estimate of the rate of this termination step to the cycling of atomic oxygen back to ozone can be found simply by taking the ratios of the concentration of O<sub>2</sub> to O<sub>3</sub>. The termination reaction is [[catalysis|catalysed]] by the presence of certain free radicals, of which the most important are hydroxyl (OH), nitric oxide (NO) and atomic chlorine (Cl) and bromine (Br). In the second half of the 20th Century the amount of ozone in the stratosphere was discovered to be declining, mostly because of increasing concentrations of [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFC) and similar [[Haloalkane|chlorinated and brominated organic molecules]]. The concern over the health effects of the decline led to the 1987 [[Montreal Protocol]], the ban on the production of many [[Ozone depletion|ozone depleting]] chemicals and in the first and second decade of the 21st Century the beginning of the recovery of stratospheric ozone concentrations.\n\n{{See also|Ozone-oxygen cycle|Ozone depletion}}\n\n====Importance to surface-dwelling life on Earth====\n[[Image:Ozone altitude UV graph.svg|thumb|Levels of ozone at various altitudes and blocking of different bands of ultraviolet radiation.

The shorter portion of this band and even more energetic UV causes the formation of the ozone layer, when single oxygen atoms produced by UV [[photolysis]] of dioxygen (below 240&nbsp;nm) react with more dioxygen.

The small unabsorbed part that remains of UV-B after passage through ozone causes sunburn in humans, and direct DNA damage in living tissues in both plants and animals. Ozone's effect on mid-range UV-B rays is illustrated by its effect on UV-B at 290&nbsp;nm, which has a radiation intensity 350 million times as powerful at the top of the atmosphere as at the surface. Nevertheless, enough of UV-B radiation at similar frequency reaches the ground to cause some sunburn, and these same wavelengths are also among those responsible for the production of [[vitamin D]] in humans.\n\nThe ozone layer has little effect on the longer UV wavelengths called UV-A (315\u2013400&nbsp;nm), but this radiation does not cause sunburn or direct DNA damage, and while it probably does cause long-term skin damage in certain humans, it is not as dangerous to plants and to the health of surface-dwelling organisms on Earth in general (see [[ultraviolet]] for more information on near ultraviolet).\n\n===Low level ozone===\n{{Main|Tropospheric ozone|Photochemical smog}}\n\nLow level ozone (or tropospheric ozone) is an atmospheric pollutant.<ref name=who-Europe>[http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/112199/E79097.pdf Health Aspects of Air Pollution with Particulate Matter, Ozone and Nitrogen Dioxide].

There have also been changes made to decrease Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions, which should help lower ozone levels.\n\nOne large contributor to high ozone levels in the area is the OIl and Natural Gas industry situated in the Denver-Julesburg Basin (DJB) which overlaps with a majority of Colorado's metropolitan areas. Ozone is created naturally in the Earth's stratosphere, but is also created in the troposphere from human efforts. Briefly mentioned above, NOx and VOCs react with sunlight to create ozone through a process called photochemistry.

Products made using these polymers are especially susceptible to attack, which causes cracks to grow longer and deeper with time, the rate of crack growth depending on the load carried by the rubber component and the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere. Such materials can be protected by adding [[antiozonant]]s, such as waxes, which bond to the surface to create a protective film or blend with the material and provide long term protection. [[Ozone cracking]] used to be a serious problem in car tires,<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Layer|first1=Robert W.|last2= Lattimer|first2= Robert P.|title = Protection of Rubber against Ozone|journal = Rubber Chemistry and Technology|date = July 1990|volume = 63|number =3|pages = 426\u2013450| doi = 10.5254/1.3538264}}</ref> for example, but it is not an issue with modern tires. On the other hand, many critical products, like [[gasket]]s and [[O-ring]]s, may be attacked by ozone produced within compressed air systems. [[Fuel line]]s made of reinforced rubber are also susceptible to attack, especially within the engine compartment, where some ozone is produced by electrical components. Storing rubber products in close proximity to a [[Direct Current|DC]] [[electric motor]] can accelerate ozone cracking. The [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] of the motor generates sparks which in turn produce ozone.\n\n====Ozone as a greenhouse gas====\nAlthough ozone was present at ground level before the [[Industrial Revolution]], peak concentrations are now far higher than the pre-industrial levels, and even background concentrations well away from sources of pollution are substantially higher.<ref>{{cite web|year=1998|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/TOP08-98/page004.html|title=Tropospheric Ozone in EU \u2013 The consolidated report|publisher=European Environmental Agency|accessdate=2006-05-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Atmospheric Chemistry and Greenhouse Gases|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/142.htm|publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|accessdate=2006-05-10|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710143636/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/142.htm|archivedate=2006-07-10}}</ref> Ozone acts as a [[greenhouse gas]], absorbing some of the [[infrared]] energy emitted by the earth.

This means on a per-molecule basis, ozone in the troposphere has a [[radiative forcing]] effect roughly 1,000 times as strong as [[carbon dioxide]]. However, tropospheric ozone is a short-lived [[greenhouse gas]], which decays in the atmosphere much more quickly than [[carbon dioxide]]. This means that over a 20-year span, the [[global warming potential]] of tropospheric ozone is much less, roughly 62 to 69 tons [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] / ton tropospheric ozone.<ref>Life Cycle Assessment Methodology Sufficient to Support Public Declarations and Claims, Committee Draft Standard, Version 2.1.

Despite high levels in the lung tissues, however, their ability to clear bacteria appears impaired by exposure to ozone.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe adaptive immune system is the branch of immunity that provides long-term protection via the development of antibodies targeting specific pathogens and is also impacted by high ozone exposure.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/><ref name=\"Travers P 2001\"/> Lymphocytes, a cellular component of the adaptive immune response, produce an increased amount of inflammatory chemicals called \"cytokines\" after exposure to ozone, which may contribute to airway hyperreactivity and worsening asthma symptoms.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe airway epithelial cells also play an important role in protecting individuals from pathogens. In normal tissue, the epithelial layer forms a protective barrier, and also contains specialized ciliary structures that work to clear foreign bodies, mucus and pathogens from the lungs. When exposed to ozone, the cilia become damaged and mucociliary clearance of pathogens is reduced. Furthermore, the epithelial barrier becomes weakened, allowing pathogens to cross the barrier, proliferate and spread into deeper tissues. Together, these changes in the epithelial barrier help make individuals more susceptible to pulmonary infections.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nInhaling ozone not only affects the immune system and lungs, but it may also affect the heart as well.

Ozone reacts directly with organic double bonds. Also, when ozone breaks down to dioxygen it gives rise to oxygen [[free radical]]s, which are highly reactive and capable of damaging many [[Organic compound|organic molecules]]. Moreover, it is believed that the powerful oxidizing properties of ozone may be a contributing factor of [[inflammation]]. The cause-and-effect relationship of how the ozone is created in the body and what it does is still under consideration and still subject to various interpretations, since other body chemical processes can trigger some of the same reactions. A team headed by Paul Wentworth Jr. of the Department of Chemistry at the [[Scripps Research Institute]] has shown evidence linking the antibody-catalyzed water-oxidation pathway of the human [[Immune system|immune response]] to the production of ozone.

H. Johnston Ozone Production.jpg|thumb|right | Ozone production demonstration, Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory, 1926]]\n\nOzone generators are used to produce ozone for cleaning air or removing smoke odours in unoccupied rooms. These ozone generators can produce over 3 g of ozone per hour. Ozone often forms in nature under conditions where O<sub>2</sub> will not react.<ref name=brown/> Ozone used in industry is measured in \u03bcmol/mol (ppm, parts per million), nmol/mol (ppb, parts per billion), \u03bcg/m<sup>3</sup>, mg/h (milligrams per hour) or weight percent. The regime of applied concentrations ranges from 1% to 5% (in air) and from 6% to 14% (in oxygen) for older generation methods. New electrolytic methods can achieve up 20% to 30% dissolved ozone concentrations in output water.\n\nTemperature and humidity play a large role in how much ozone is being produced using traditional generation methods (such as corona discharge and ultraviolet light). Old generation methods will produce less than 50% of nominal capacity if operated with humid ambient air, as opposed to very dry air. New generators, using electrolytic methods, can achieve higher purity and dissolution through using water molecules as the source of ozone production.\n\n===Corona discharge method===\n[[File:Shkarkese elektrike.jpg|thumb|A homemade ozone generator. Ozone is produced in the corona discharge|alt=]]\nThis is the most common type of ozone generator for most industrial and personal uses. While variations of the \"hot spark\" coronal discharge method of ozone production exist, including medical grade and industrial grade ozone generators, these units usually work by means of a [[Corona discharge|corona discharge tube]] or ozone plate.<ref>https://www.a2zozone.com/blogs/news/ozone-tube-vs-ozone-plate</ref><ref>{{OrgSynth|last1=Smith|first1=L.

Fluctuations in ambient air, due to weather or other environmental conditions, cause variability in ozone production. However, they also produce [[nitrogen oxide]]s as a by-product. Use of an [[air dryer]] can reduce or eliminate nitric acid formation by removing water vapor and increase ozone production. At room temperature, nitric acid will form into a vapour that is hazardous if inhaled. Symptoms can include chest pain, shortness of breath, headaches and a dry nose and throat causing a burning sensation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Best Ozone Generator Reviews and Guide 2019 |url=https://www.freshairguide.com/best-ozone-generator/#ozgenfaq |website=www.freshairguide.com}}</ref> Use of an [[oxygen concentrator]] can further increase the ozone production and further reduce the risk of nitric acid formation by removing not only the water vapor, but also the bulk of the nitrogen.\n\n===Ultraviolet light===\n{{See also|Photochemistry}}\nUV ozone generators, or vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) ozone generators, employ a light source that generates a narrow-band ultraviolet light, a subset of that produced by the Sun. The Sun's UV sustains the ozone layer in the stratosphere of Earth.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Dohan |first=J. M. |author2=W. J. Masschelein |year=1987 |journal=Ozone Sci. Eng.|title=Photochemical Generation of Ozone: Present State-of-the-Art |volume=9 |pages=315\u2013334 |doi=10.1080/01919518708552147 |issue=4}}</ref>\n\nUV ozone generators use ambient air for ozone production, no air prep systems are used (air dryer or oxygen concentrator), therefore these generators tend to be less expensive. However, UV ozone generators usually produce ozone with a concentration of about 0.5% or lower which limits the potential ozone production rate. Another disadvantage of this method is that it requires the ambient air (oxygen) to be exposed to the UV source for a longer amount of time, and any gas that is not exposed to the UV source will not be treated. This makes UV generators impractical for use in situations that deal with rapidly moving air or water streams (in-duct air [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]], for example). Production of ozone is one of the [[ultraviolet germicidal irradiation#Potential dangers|potential dangers]] of [[ultraviolet germicidal irradiation]]. VUV ozone generators are used in swimming pools and [[spa]] applications ranging to millions of gallons of water. VUV ozone generators, unlike corona discharge generators, do not produce harmful nitrogen by-products and also unlike corona discharge systems, VUV ozone generators work extremely well in humid air environments. There is also not normally a need for expensive off-gas mechanisms, and no need for air driers or oxygen concentrators which require extra costs and maintenance.\n\n===Cold plasma===\nIn the cold plasma method, pure oxygen gas is exposed to a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] created by [[dielectric barrier discharge]]. The diatomic oxygen is split into single atoms, which then recombine in triplets to form ozone.\n\nCold plasma machines utilize pure oxygen as the input source and produce a maximum concentration of about 5% ozone. They produce far greater quantities of ozone in a given space of time compared to ultraviolet production. However, because cold plasma ozone generators are very expensive, they are found less frequently than the previous two types.\n\nThe discharges manifest as filamentary transfer of electrons (micro discharges) in a gap between two electrodes. In order to evenly distribute the micro discharges, a dielectric [[Electrical insulation|insulator]] must be used to separate the metallic electrodes and to prevent arcing.\n\nSome cold plasma units also have the capability of producing short-lived allotropes of oxygen which include O<sub>4</sub>, O<sub>5</sub>, O<sub>6</sub>, O<sub>7</sub>, etc. These species are even more reactive than ordinary {{chem|O|3}}.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gujral|display-authors=etal|first=Sarbjeet Singh|year=2013|title=Ozone Therapy: A Milestone in the Treatment of Ailments|url=http://www.iglobaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/8.-Sarbjeet-S-Gujral-et-al-IGJPS-2013_edited.pdf|journal=Indo Global Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences|volume=3 |issue=2|pages=167\u2013173|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Electrolytic===\nElectrolytic ozone generation (EOG) splits water molecules into H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub>.\nIn most EOG methods, the hydrogen gas will be removed to leave oxygen and ozone as the only reaction products. Therefore, EOG can achieve higher [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] in water without other competing gases found in corona discharge method, such as nitrogen gases present in ambient air. This method of generation can achieve concentrations of 20\u201330% and is independent of air quality because water is used as the source material. Production of ozone electrolytically is typically unfavorable because of the high [[overpotential]] required to produce ozone as compared to oxygen. This is why ozone is not produced during typical water electrolysis. However, it is possible to increase the overpotential of oxygen by careful catalyst selection such that ozone is preferentially produced under electrolysis. Catalysts typically chosen for this approach are [[lead dioxide]]<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Foller, Peter C. |author2=Tobias, Charles W. |title=The Anodic Evolution of Ozone|journal=Journal of the Electrochemical Society|volume=129|issue=3|pages=506|doi=10.1149/1.2123890|year=1982}}</ref> or boron-doped diamond.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Arihara, Kazuki |author2=Terashima, Chiaki |author3=Fujishimam Akira |title= Electrochemical Production of High-Concentration Ozone-Water Using Freestanding Perforated Diamond Electrodes|journal= Journal of the Electrochemical Society|volume= 154|issue= 4|pages= E71|doi= 10.1149/1.2509385|year= 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe ozone to oxygen ratio is improved by increasing current density at the anode, cooling the electrolyte around the anode close to 0&nbsp;\u00b0C, using an acidic electrolyte (such as dilute sulfuric acid) instead of a basic solution, and by applying pulsed current instead of DC.<ref name=\"Hale1919\">{{cite book|last=Hale |first=Arthur J. |title=The Manufacture of Chemicals by Electrolysis|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eDNDAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=12 September 2019|year=1919|publisher=D. Van Nostrand Co.|pages=15, 16}}</ref>\n\n===Special considerations===\nOzone cannot be stored and transported like other industrial gases (because it quickly decays into diatomic oxygen) and must therefore be produced on site. Available ozone generators vary in the arrangement and design of the high-voltage electrodes. At production capacities higher than 20&nbsp;kg per hour, a gas/water tube heat-exchanger may be utilized as ground electrode and assembled with tubular high-voltage electrodes on the gas-side. The regime of typical gas pressures is around {{convert|2|bar|lk=on}} absolute in oxygen and {{convert|3|bar}} absolute in air. Several megawatts of [[electric power|electrical power]] may be installed in large facilities, applied as one phase AC [[Electric current|current]] at 50 to 8000&nbsp;Hz and peak [[voltage]]s between 3,000 and 20,000 volts. Applied voltage is usually inversely related to the applied frequency.\n\nThe dominating parameter influencing ozone generation efficiency is the gas temperature, which is controlled by cooling water temperature and/or gas velocity. The cooler the water, the better the ozone synthesis. The lower the gas velocity, the higher the concentration (but the lower the net ozone produced). At typical industrial conditions, almost 90% of the effective power is dissipated as heat and needs to be removed by a sufficient cooling water flow.\n\nBecause of the high reactivity of ozone, only a few materials may be used like [[stainless steel]] (quality 316L), [[titanium]], [[aluminium]] (as long as no moisture is present), [[glass]], [[polytetrafluorethylene]], or [[polyvinylidene fluoride]]. [[Viton]] may be used with the restriction of constant mechanical forces and absence of humidity (humidity limitations apply depending on the formulation). [[Hypalon]] may be used with the restriction that no water comes in contact with it, except for normal atmospheric levels. [[Embrittlement]] or shrinkage is the common mode of failure of elastomers with exposure to ozone. Ozone cracking is the common mode of failure of elastomer seals like [[O-rings]].\n\n[[Silicone rubber]]s are usually adequate for use as [[gaskets]] in ozone concentrations below 1 wt%, such as in equipment for accelerated aging of rubber samples.\n\n===Incidental production===\nOzone may be formed from {{chem|O|2}} by electrical discharges and by action of high energy [[electromagnetic radiation]]. [[Arc suppression|Unsuppressed arcing]] in electrical contacts, motor brushes, or mechanical switches breaks down the chemical bonds of the atmospheric oxygen surrounding the contacts [{{chem|O|2}} \u2192 2O].

Oxygen formation is a competing reaction.\n\nIt can also be generated by a [[high voltage]] [[Electric arc|arc]]. In its simplest form, high voltage AC, such as the output of a [[neon-sign transformer]] is connected to two metal rods with the ends placed sufficiently close to each other to allow an arc. The resulting arc will convert atmospheric oxygen to ozone.\n\nIt is often desirable to contain the ozone. This can be done with an apparatus consisting of two concentric glass tubes sealed together at the top with gas ports at the top and bottom of the outer tube. The inner core should have a length of metal foil inserted into it connected to one side of the power source. The other side of the power source should be connected to another piece of foil wrapped around the outer tube. A source of dry  {{chem|O|2}} is applied to the bottom port. When high voltage is applied to the foil leads, [[electricity]] will discharge between the dry dioxygen in the middle and form {{chem|O|3}} and {{chem|O|2}} which will flow out the top port.

Where [[Electric power|electrical power]] is abundant, ozone is a cost-effective method of treating water, since it is produced on demand and does not require transportation and storage of hazardous chemicals. Once it has decayed, it leaves no taste or odour in drinking water.\n\nAlthough low levels of ozone have been advertised to be of some disinfectant use in residential homes, the concentration of ozone in dry air required to have a rapid, substantial effect on airborne pathogens exceeds safe levels recommended by the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] and [[Environmental Protection Agency]]. Humidity control can vastly improve both the killing power of the ozone and the rate at which it decays back to oxygen (more humidity allows more effectiveness). [[Spore]] forms of most pathogens are very tolerant of atmospheric ozone in concentrations at which asthma patients start to have issues.\n\nIndustrially, ozone is used to:\n*Disinfect laundry in hospitals, food factories, care homes etc.;<ref>{{cite web|date=2007-04-01|url=http://www.hdmagazine.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=2043080|title=Decontamination: Ozone scores on spores| work= Hospital Development|publisher=Wilmington Media Ltd.|accessdate=2007-05-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929000438/http://www.hdmagazine.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=2043080 |archivedate = 2007-09-29}}</ref>\n*Disinfect water in place of chlorine<ref name=brown />\n*[[Deodorize]] air and objects, such as after a fire.

This kind of air purifier is sometimes claimed to imitate nature's way of purifying the air without filters and to sanitize both it and household surfaces. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has declared that there is \"evidence to show that at concentrations that do not exceed public health standards, ozone is not effective at removing many odor-causing chemicals\" or \"viruses, bacteria, mold, or other biological pollutants\". Furthermore, its report states that \"results of some controlled studies show that concentrations of ozone considerably higher than these [human safety] standards are possible even when a user follows the manufacturer's operating instructions\".<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/ozonegen.html EPA report on consumer ozone air purifiers].

Its use can minimize bacterial growth, control parasites, eliminate transmission of some diseases, and reduce or eliminate \"yellowing\" of the water. Ozone must not come in contact with fishes' gill structures. Natural saltwater (with life forms) provides enough \"instantaneous demand\" that controlled amounts of ozone activate bromide ions to [[hypobromous acid]], and the ozone entirely decays in a few seconds to minutes. If oxygen-fed ozone is used, the water will be higher in dissolved oxygen and fishes' gill structures will atrophy, making them dependent on oxygen-enriched water.\n\n===Aquaculture===\nOzonation \u2013 a process of infusing water with ozone \u2013 can be used in aquaculture to facilitate organic breakdown.

Upon hearing the beat, given to him by St. Louis producer Antoine \"Bam\" Macon, Nelly began writing lyrics and then wrote a song out from it. He then decided to make the song a last-minute addition to his second album ''[[Nellyville]]'', which had already been completed prior to Bam giving him the track.<ref name=\"MossMaking\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1470044/20030220/nelly.jhtml|title=Road To The Grammys: The Making Of Nelly's 'Dilemma'|last=Moss|first=Corey|date=2003-02-20|publisher=MTV|accessdate=2009-02-23}}</ref> Once Nelly returned to the studio to record the track, his vision changed, wanting to add a female vocal onto it. He instantly thought of [[Destiny's Child]] member [[Kelly Rowland]], whom he had met during the ''[[Total Request Live|TRL]]'' tour in 2001. Nelly called Rowland by phone and agreed. After a few days of recording, during which Rowland re-recorded her part many times to achieve it \"just right\", \"Dilemma\" was completed.<ref name=\"MossMaking\"/>\n\nOnce ''Nellyville'' was released in the United States on June 25, 2002, radio programmers started playing \"Dilemma\". By July 2002, the track had reached the top ten of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] based on airplay alone. This prompted Nelly to release it as the album's second single, although it was not the original plan.<ref name=\"MossHitDC\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1456206/20020722/destinys_child.jhtml|title=Nelly Hit Forces Change In Plans For Destiny's Child LPs|last=Moss|first=Corey|date=2002-07-22|publisher=MTV|accessdate=2009-02-23}}</ref> The single was released on July 30, 2002. The decision affected the early plans for Destiny's Child members, as they were held on hiatus to pursue solo album releases. As part of their strategy, each of their albums were to be staggered, with member [[Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles]] releasing in October 2002 and Rowland's album expected in early 2003.<ref name=\"MossHitDC\"/> Their management rescheduled the dates: Rowland eventually released her debut solo album, ''[[Simply Deep]]'', on October 28, 2002, ahead of Knowles, which caused her to move and push back her album release to a June 2003 date. \"Dilemma\" was released as the first single from the album, which served as a propeller for her solo career.<ref name=\"MossMaking\"/> \"Dilemma\" is Rowland's first international solo single away from the group: she had previously appeared on R&B singer [[Avant (singer)|Avant]]'s single \"[[Separated (song)|Separated]]\", which was released in the United States in July 2000.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Critical reception==\n\"Dilemma\" was generally well received by critics.

The song had already reached number one on the Hot 100 before a video was ever shot as Nelly's record label did not expect the song to explode so fast and expected they could take their time with the video.

Upon hearing the beat, given to him by St. Louis producer Antoine \"Bam\" Macon, Nelly began writing lyrics and then wrote a song out from it. He then decided to make the song a last-minute addition to his second album ''[[Nellyville]]'', which had already been completed prior to Bam giving him the track.<ref name=\"MossMaking\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1470044/20030220/nelly.jhtml|title=Road To The Grammys: The Making Of Nelly's 'Dilemma'|last=Moss|first=Corey|date=2003-02-20|publisher=MTV|accessdate=2009-02-23}}</ref> Once Nelly returned to the studio to record the track, his vision changed, wanting to add a female vocal onto it. He instantly thought of [[Destiny's Child]] member [[Kelly Rowland]], whom he had met during the ''[[Total Request Live|TRL]]'' tour in 2001. Nelly called Rowland by phone and agreed. After a few days of recording, during which Rowland re-recorded her part many times to achieve it \"just right\", \"Dilemma\" was completed.<ref name=\"MossMaking\"/>\n\nOnce ''Nellyville'' was released in the United States on June 25, 2002, radio programmers started playing \"Dilemma\". By July 2002, the track had reached the top ten of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] based on airplay alone. This prompted Nelly to release it as the album's second single, although it was not the original plan.<ref name=\"MossHitDC\">{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1456206/20020722/destinys_child.jhtml|title=Nelly Hit Forces Change In Plans For Destiny's Child LPs|last=Moss|first=Corey|date=2002-07-22|publisher=MTV|accessdate=2009-02-23}}</ref> The single was released on July 30, 2002. The decision affected the early plans for Destiny's Child members, as they were held on hiatus to pursue solo album releases. As part of their strategy, each of their albums were to be staggered, with member [[Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles]] releasing in October 2002 and Rowland's album expected in early 2003.<ref name=\"MossHitDC\"/> Their management rescheduled the dates: Rowland eventually released her debut solo album, ''[[Simply Deep]]'', on October 28, 2002, ahead of Knowles, which caused her to move and push back her album release to a June 2003 date. \"Dilemma\" was released as the first single from the album, which served as a propeller for her solo career.<ref name=\"MossMaking\"/> \"Dilemma\" is Rowland's first international solo single away from the group: she had previously appeared on R&B singer [[Avant (singer)|Avant]]'s single \"[[Separated (song)|Separated]]\", which was released in the United States in July 2000.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Critical reception==\n\"Dilemma\" was generally well received by critics.
