It has a population of 9,525 inhabitants (INE 2018) and its municipality, of 503.33 km\u00b2, is the fourth largest in Aragon.\n\nIt obtained the title of city in the 19th century, as a result of the damage suffered in the Carlist Wars, by concession of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThere is a popular belief that the name of '''Caspe''' comes from ancient inhabitants of the city, originating from the Caspian Sea; However, this etymology lacks philological rigor despite its wide diffusion. The place name ''Casp'' appears documented in Andalusian sources such as Qsp, Qasp or Qasb and has been related to the Arabic word Casba. It is also possible that the name of the city derives from the Indo-European root Cass (holm oak) and the suffix pe (place of or below).\n\n== Geography ==\n'''Caspe''' is located at the 41.2 parallel of north latitude and on the Greenwich meridian. It is 104 km southeast of Zaragoza on the banks of the Guadalope river \u2014which no longer carries water in this section, having been diverted upstream when building the Mequinenza reservoir, also called the \u00abSea of Aragon\u00bb \u2014and a few kilometers from the Ebro. It is 152 meters above sea level in one of the most arid areas of Aragon, with an average temperature of 14.6 \u00b0 C and 325 mm of annual precipitation.\n\nIt is located at the crossroads of two axes: the Ebro \u2014 in an east-west direction, partly used by the railway \u2014 and, perpendicular to it, the one that, starting from Andorra, passes through Alca\u00f1iz and continues to Barbastro and Monz\u00f3n.\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\n'''Caspe''' is home to a great diversity of fauna and flora, due to the landscape combination of the steppe, river, forest and Mediterranean forest.\n\nin terms of birds, it is worth noting a diverse population of birds of prey, such as the golden eagle, griffon vulture, peregrine falcon, common buzzard, goshawk and sparrowhawk throughout the year; European merlin, kite and pale harrier in winter, as well as black kite, Egyptian vulture, European short-toed, alcotan, ash harrier and lesser kestrel in summer. As for nocturnal birds of prey, they live the small owl, owlet, scops owl and owl. Although not as extensive as in the surroundings, Caspe has a population of steppe birds that includes the great bustard, common curlew, both species of bargains, the Ortega and the Iberian, and the cr\u00edalo. The steppe landscape is made up of the juniper juniper and the black juniper, as well as captains, rosemary, thyme and reed beds.\n\nThe riverside forests create a complex habitat that joins the mountain landscapes and rainfed fields. Some waterfowl can be found, such as the mallard duck, gray heron, imperial heron, little bittern, little egret and kingfisher. The riverside forests are mainly made up of black poplars, reeds and reed beds. In the bush and bush landscape some forest species inhabit such as the aforementioned sparrowhawk and goshawk, in addition to countless birds, highlighting the common turtledove and bee-eater in summer, the crossbill, red partridge and the increasingly rare common quail. The Mediterranean and mount forests are mainly made up of Aleppo pine, black juniper and white sable, coscolla, ginesta, romerales and thyme.\n\nAs for mammals, the red deer stands out, since the only deer that never became extinct in Aragon lives in the area; also the wild boar, common badger, common fox, marten, genet, otter, weasel, roe deer, common rabbit, Iberian hare and rodents such as voles or field mice, among others. Caspe's diversity of habitats makes possible the presence of a considerable variety of amphibians and reptiles. In the rafts and puddles of the mountain they breed the common toad, the spur toad, the running toad, the spotted toad, the common frog and the viper snake. In addition, the Ocellated Lizard, Bastard Snake, Horseshoe Snake and Ladder Snake are found throughout the territory, as well as the leper turtle in the river. In some areas of the forest the rare snout viper lives.\n\nAlso, Caspe has a considerable population of white stork in the convent of Santo Domingo and the Collegiate Church of Santa Mar\u00eda la Mayor, with a total of 17 couples (2018).\n<br />\n\n== Prehistory and archeology ==\nThe municipality of Caspe seems to have been one of the last to be populated within Bajo Arag\u00f3n, either due to environmental problems for the prehistoric habitat or because erosion has destroyed the deposits.\n\nHowever, in the area of Cauvaca an amygdaloid biface has been discovered that can be ascribed to a generic Achelense or an initial Musterian, whose age is 150,000 - 100,000 years, and that demonstrates, at least, the passage through this area of groups of Neanderthal hunter-gatherers. Likewise, lithic pieces similar to the previous one have been found in Soto de Vinu\u00e9 V.\n\nWithin the ''Rock art'', the site of the Plano del Polido stands out. Located in a small open hole in the sandstone rock, it contains a set of Levantine-style cave paintings. The composition brings together several figures, highlighting a magnificent deer in an alert attitude to start the fight with another congener that appears with the low antlers. Between both figures a female doe can be seen, in a lower position, and there is also a fourth figure, quite lost, which is possibly another doe. Various remains of paint on the far right of the composition seem to correspond to the figure of an archer.\n\nThe great demographic and cultural emergence of Caspe took place around the 8th century BC with the appearance of innumerable towns and tumular necropolises of Indo-European, Celtic hallstatt from the first Iron Age, which correspond to populations mainly from the Segre basin and the high Ebro basin, especially from Navarra and \u00c1lava.\n\nAmong the deposits of this final Bronze, it is worth mentioning that of the Cabezos de Sancharanc\u00f3n. This town is located on the road from Caspe to Zaragoceta. On a conical hill with a large number of sandstone blocks that accumulate on the slopes, the quadrangular houses are distributed. The ceramic materials collected on the surface typologically fit with those of the advanced Middle Bronze, although there are also very few remains of vessels that can be attributed to the culture of the '''Urnfield culture''', in addition to flint-carved products.\n\nAnother interesting deposit is the Cabezo de Monle\u00f3n, on the Guadalope river, having identified 52 houses that make up a central street plan. Its population has been estimated at about 300 inhabitants and the life of those shepherds, metallurgists and cereal farmers could have been extended between 800 BC and iberization.\n\nThe deposit of Loma de los Brunos dates from the Iberian era, located in the vicinity of the Civ\u00e1n dam. It corresponds to the old phase of Iberian settlement (6th to 5th centuries BC). Chronologically later is the town of La Tallada, occupied since the 4th century BC. Until its destruction and abandonment in the 1st century BC. Located on the top of a hill, it is medium in size and consists of rectangular houses, many of them carved out of the rock.\n\nFrom the 1st century, the Ebro valley was fully Romanized and the sites, identified as Roman villas, of Azud de Civ\u00e1n, Boquera del Regallo I-II, Mas de Rabel, Campo de R\u00e1fales, Picard\u00edas, Soto de Ba\u00f1os, El Fond\u00f3n and Miralpeix date from that time. From this last enclave is the Miralpeix Mausoleum, which was moved to its current location as a result of the construction of the Mequinenza reservoir that led to the flooding of the monument. It was built in the late 2nd or early 3rd century AD. C.9\n\nLikewise, local historiography mentions the remains of the city of Trabia, an indigenous population destroyed by the Romans who came to coin money. Both Trabia and the nearby place of Valdurrios are pre-Roman place names. According to some authors, a medieval town was built on its ruins that did not last. Since the middle of the 12th century, Trabia had owned its ''carta puebla'', which indicates that the place had some importance. It was inhabited at least until 1440, year in which it is still recorded that the figure of Justice existed in the place\n\n==History==\n\nA legend says that Caspe was founded by T\u00fabal, son of Jafet and grandson of Noah, in the expedition that he carried up the waters of the Ebro to Logro\u00f1o.\n\n=== Old age ===\nIt has been maintained that, before the Roman conquest of Hispania, the lands that the municipality currently occupies were inhabited by the sedetanos, an Iberian group from the 3rd century BC. However, recent investigations place the tribe of the Ausetans or Ositans in the Caspe region, whose capital, Osicerda, would be located in the Cabezo Palao de Alca\u00f1iz. This city-state and its territory possibly reached the Ebro to the north and the Matarra\u00f1a river to the east, a border line between Ositans and ilercavones.\n\n=== Middle Age ===\nSince the arrival of the muslims in 713, to the Christian reconquest in the first half of the 12th century, the lands of the Ebro constituted the northernmost mark of Al-Andalus, a sector occupied by the Yemeni contingent. In this territory, the latin culture predominated over the Hispanic-Roman and Visigoth indigenous population of Christians and Jews; but from the 10th century on, the Arabization and Islamization of the population prevailed, leaving Christians and Jews relegated to a small percentage.\n\nBetween June and September 1169, Caspe was integrated into the Crown of Aragon by King Alfonso II. The conquest of the town was carried out under the direction of the Count of Pallars, Arnal de Mir, and his son Ram\u00f3n, in collaboration with other feudal lords. In the Annals of the Crown of Aragon by Jer\u00f3nimo Zurita, the following is narrated:<blockquote>At this time, the Moors who were in the region of the Edetanos in the castles and forces they had on the banks of the Algas river were waging a great war ... And Caspe was won, a very important place along the banks of the Ebro And from there the war continued on the banks of Guadalob and the Calanda river.</blockquote>It is estimated that the number of inhabitants of Caspe, at the time of the reconquest, could have been somewhat higher than 1,000 inhabitants, being its population overwhelmingly Islamic. Muslims were allowed to keep their religious practices, although they had a year to leave their own home before moving outside the walls. As for the Jews, although it cannot be specified when they arrived in Caspe, what is certain is that when the troops of Alfonso II entered, there were already Jews in the La Muela neighborhood living with the Muslims.\n\nThe town then passed to the Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem through the exchange carried out with Alfonso II for other assets of the order. Its castle was used as residence of the bailiwick of the Hospital. The population managed to stabilize in the last quarter of the 13th century, after Garcel\u00e1n de Timor was appointed commander of the Bailiwick of Caspe. The town, which then had about 1,500 inhabitants, expanded from La Muela to the surrounding farmhouse with the castle of the Order at the top and the church of Santa Mar\u00eda for the whole of the Christian community.\n\nIn 1392, Juan Fern\u00e1ndez de Heredia, grand master of the order, bought all the possessions in the town from the Ses\u00e9 family to found a convent. It elevated the church to the category of Collegiate Church and increased the importance of the Sanjuanista Convent by endowing it with treasures and relics such as the \"Lignum Crucis\". When he died, his body was brought from Avignon and buried in the convent church, in a tomb that he himself had carved.\n\nIn medieval times, Caspe was the largest aragonese center and one of the largest in Spain in the production of glass. It is known of the existence of thirty glass furnaces in its municipal area. The large amount of saline soils favored the growth of the ''barilla'', which together with the quality and quantity of the sand, were the basic elements for the production of glass. It seems that the Jews were the first involved in this industry, mainly between the 14th and 15th centuries. Much of the glaziers belonged to the most important families in the town.\n\nIn the fourteenth century, the black plague ravaged the Kingdom of Aragon; There is evidence that the epidemic was installed in Caspe in 1371, even forcing the transfer of the sessions of the Cortes Generales. According to the Anales de Valima\u00f1a, about 300 people died in the town, victims of the deadly disease.\n\nThe population was the scene in 1412 of the historic \"Compromiso de Caspe\", when Martin I of Aragon died without descendants. On April 22 of that year, the deliberations of the delegates began, and on June 28 he was proclaimed King Fernando de Trastamara, called that of Antequera, as Fernando I de Arag\u00f3n. In front of the door that gives access to the atrium of the Collegiate Church of Santa Mar\u00eda la Mayor a platform was erected from which the people were informed of the declaration of right voted by the delegates of the States of the Crown of Aragon in favor of Don Fernando . The following day, Fray Vicente de Ferrer preached at the church, who took a very active part in the sessions of the well-known Commitment.\n\nAfter the Commitment, Caspe remained for the rest of the XV century as a thriving town with its neighborhoods of La Muela, San Roque and El Pueyo, an agriculture that took advantage of the irrigation of the Ebro and Guadalope prospering. At that time the town had the visit of Pope Benedict XIII, better known as Pope Luna, who came to settle matters between his own family, the Luna, and the Urrea.\n\n=== Modern age ===\nUntil 1610, the Christian and Muslim communities continued to populate the town. Although they shared the old irrigated land, each had its own municipal area, as well as its own communal assets. Both were vassals of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem.\n\nDue to its geographical situation, Caspe has been one of the most affected populations by the different conflicts that have occurred in Spain since the 17th century. In the Catalan uprising (1640-1652), it was victim of incursions and raids by the Franco-Catalan troops, as well as fiscal exactions from the monarchy, both of which made a serious impact on its economic situation. In the War of Succession (1701-1711) it was a follower of the Bourbon cause while its neighbors opted for the Austrian aspirant.\n\n=== XIX century ===\nDuring the War of Independence, Caspe was occupied by French troops with little resistance on March 4, 1809. Abandoned soon after, it was definitively occupied from June 1809 to 1813. The most important figure in that period was that of the local lawyer Agust\u00edn de Quinto, ''afrancesado'' who collaborated in government tasks together with the French. In November 1810, Suchet appointed him as General Commissar of the left bank of the Ebro, making Caspe, thanks to Quinto's residence in the town, the capital of the lower half of Aragon. At the end of the war (June 1813), Colonel Ram\u00f3n Gay\u00e1n arrived in Caspe determined to take the city from the French. To lift the siege, which lasted fifteen days, he resorted to the construction of two mines: one, from Calle de San Juan to the cellars of the Convent, and the other from the Revuelta. The explosion of the latter damaged the basement of the Castle - where the French had barricaded themselves - but forced them to flee to Mequinenza.\n\nLater, the town was affected by the Carlist Wars, which had special relevance for the population. This was a consequence of the strategic location of the Caspe region, as well as the confiscation of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, which generated the discontent of the peasantry at the expectations created, and the loss of purchasing power of peasants, day laborers and artisans, due to the fall in the price of oil. These factors led to the start of the war a not very large group of Caspolinos escaped to the Carlist faction.14\n\nCaspe was the object of the Carlist incursions, suffering sieges, assaults and ephemeral occupations. In May 1835, during the First Carlist War, General Cabrera managed to seize part of the population; in the few hours that the Carlists occupied it, they took important spoils, looting the houses of the Queen's supporters. The following month, Llagostera took control of the first urban enclosure, burning the city afterwards; a year later he managed to take it again, to abandon it soon after. In November 1836 he returned to seize the town, retaining it in his power for eleven days. And in June 1837, Carlist troops took Caspe but, before retiring, burned the town. According to official reports, 223 houses burned, and the fire could not be quenched until the next day. The economic consequences derived from these events must have been significant, causing that henceforth, when there was news of the Carlists entering, the inhabitants flee to the farms. \n\nPascual Madoz, in his 1845 Geographic-Statistical-Historical Dictionary of Spain, describes Caspe in the following terms: <blockquote>It is located on the banks of the Guadalope river, near its confluence with the Ebro, on 3 or 4 small hills ... It is formed by 1,500 fairly regular houses, distributed in 70 fairly wide streets, 9 squares and a main square with an almost circular figure in the center of the town ... It also has a small fort supported by what was previously a parish church and the convent of San Juan.</blockquote>Regarding its production, it indicates that:<blockquote>The main of these is that of oil; many cereals are also harvested; the wine harvest has declined somewhat and the same happens with that of silk. There are abundant and exquisite fruits of all kinds and legumes and vegetables; likewise hemp and flax; sheep and goats are raised.</blockquote>In 1861, in the interval between the Second and the Third Carlist War, Caspe obtained the city title. However, the political instability of the revolutionary six-year period led to a new boom for Carlist activities and, with the proclamation of the First Republic (February 11, 1873), the Third Carlist War reached its greatest intensity. The most notable event took place in October of that same year when the Carlist troops from Vall\u00e9s entered Caspe without encountering any resistance; in fact, 600 caspolinos joined the Carlists, setting fire to the Bail\u00edo Castle and the old Convent of San Juan. In February 1874, a new Carlist raid took place, led this time by Marco de Bello, in order to raise funds for the purchase of weapons and to pay for the uniforms worn by his combatants.\n\nProbably, the most relevant economic event for Caspe in the 19th century was the arrival of the railway. In June 1876, the municipality agreed to grant a series of privileges to the company that carried out the layout more quickly. Thus, in September 1891, work began on the municipal area of \u200b\u200bthe city, finally reaching the route on October 13, 1893.\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nIn 1926 the Ebro Hydrographic Confederation was created in Caspe, an organization that manages the waters and irrigation of the Ebro hydrographic basin, the most important of the ten that have been created in the peninsular territory.\n\nAlready proclaimed the Second Spanish Republic, the draft of the Statute of Autonomy of Aragon of 1936 was drafted in this city, also known as the Statute of Caspe, which was not ratified by the Cortes at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. During the first part of the war, Caspe was the seat of the Council of Aragon, a government body created by the anarchists in 1936. This entity continued its functions until it was dissolved by government authorities in the summer of 1937, due to its independence from the Republican government. On August 4, the Minister of National Defense, Indalecio Prieto, issued orders to the Army and the 11th Division, under Enrique L\u00edster was sent to Aragon, officially dissolving the Council of Aragon on August. This dissolution took place through a military intervention that took Caspe by surprise.The CNT Local Federation of Trade Unions was taken by assault, tanks and artillery were concentrated at the exit of the city and some confrontations with casualties took place. Joaqu\u00edn Ascaso, President of the Council of Aragon, and its anarchist members were arrested on various charges.\n\nWith the offensive of Aragon in 1938, the republican chief of staff, General Vicente Rojo, installed his operations center in this city, concentrating there all the International Brigades that he was able to gather. On March 15 the Battle of Caspe began, when three Francoist divisions of the Moroccan Army Corps reached the suburbs of the town. The 1st Division of Navarra undertook the siege of Caspe, being present, in the first phase of the battle, the International Brigades XI, XIII and XV; In a second phase that took place on the right bank of the Guadalope river, XII and XIV intervened. Although the ''interbrigadistas'', especially those of the XV Brigade, deployed a strong defense against the attackers, at dusk on March 17 the town was finally conquered by Franco's troops.The war part of the \"national\" side recorded the fact with these words: <blockquote>This morning the important city of Caspe has been occupied, also establishing a bridgehead 5 kilometers to the east, despite the stubborn resistance opposed by five international brigades.</blockquote>After the conquest, the town became the headquarters of the Moroccan Army Corps, in charge of the troops of the Ebro river.\n\n== Demography ==\nIn the document of 1495 \u2014census of the Kingdom of Aragon ordered by King Fernando the Catholic\u2014, Caspe has 295 households, which is equivalent to an approximate population of 1,600 inhabitants. Among them were 10% of Mudejar Muslims, 5% of Jews and 6% of clerics, including Hospital Order knights.\n\nThe 1857 census of Spain, which inaugurated the statistical series, records a population of 10,609 inhabitants in the town, being at that time the third most populous nucleus in the province of Zaragoza, after the capital and Calatayud. Within the century XX, Caspe reached the maximum population, 9,981 inhabitants, in 1950. Starting in the 1960s, the rural exodus began, which affected all of Aragon, resulting in a decrease in the population.\n\nIn 2018 the population of Caspe reached 9,525 inhabitants, similar to the one it had in the middle of the 20th century. On the other hand, in recent years there has been a considerable increase in the immigrant population.\n<br />\n\n== Economy ==\nThe city's economy is based on agriculture and the service sector\n\nThe basic crop has been the olive tree; from it, an industrial and exporting activity of oil and olives is developed, being the region  included within the scope of the recently approved designation of origin production label. The existence of a benign microclimate and a good irrigation system - due to the confluence of the Guadalope and the Ebro - lead to numerous plantations of fruit trees, especially cherry trees. Around agricultural production there is an important industry of canned vegetables and pickles.\n\nLikewise, animal farming has a great development, existing in Caspe a municipal slaughterhouse and an agricultural market.\n\nAnother fundamental sector in the local industry is textiles, a sector that has a great expansion in Caspe and its region. Likewise, the manufacturing industries, metal processing and various workshops are especially numerous, being located in Caspe the General Warehouse for Spain of the sports firm Adidas. The city has four industrial estates, called \"El Castillo\", \"El Portal\", \"Cabezo Mancebo\" and \"Los Arcos\".\n\nAs for the fair activity, Caspe hosts an event in autumn \"Expocaspe\", the agricultural, livestock, industrial and commercial fair of Bajo Arag\u00f3n. Another convention that takes place in the city is \"Naupesca\", dedicated to hunting, fishing and water sports.\n\nThe \"Dynamization Plan of the Tourist Product of the Bajo Arag\u00f3n-Caspe / Baix Arag\u00f3-Casp Region\" is a recent initiative to turn tourism into an engine for economic development for the area.\n\n== Heritage ==\nRegarding with its history, Caspe has an important historical heritage. Among the oldest remains are the cave paintings in the shelter of the Plano del Pulido, declared a World Heritage Site by Unesco since 1998, as well as several Neolithic sites.\n\nFrom the Roman period is the Miralpeix Mausoleum, declared a national monument in 1931. It consists of a rectangular cella with side walls that support a barrel vault framed in front with two pilasters with Corinthian columns.\n\n=== Religious heritage ===\nThe Hermitage of Santa Mar\u00eda de Horta - rescued from the Mequinenza reservoir and rebuilt on top of a hill overlooking Caspe - is a Romanesque construction. The temple was erected by people from the town of Miralpeix in a popular Romanesque style between the end of the 12th century or the beginning of the 13th century. It is built in ashlar masonry and has an elongated keyhole-shaped plan, divided into five  sections.Also known as Santa Mar\u00eda del Fond\u00f3n, due to its primitive location, it has an interesting semicircular apse.\n\nThe Collegiate Church of Santa Mar\u00eda la Mayor del Pilar is by far the most monumental building in Caspe. It is one of the most notable examples of purist Gothic in Aragon, still influenced by the Cistercian style. The temple consists of three naves, the central nave being the widest and tallest, all of it covered by a ribbed vault. It was consecrated by Hadrian VI in 1522 and previously, in 1412, the mass proclaiming the ruling of the Caspe Commitment was held there. Located in the highest area of \u200b\u200bthe urban area, it was part of an acropolis organized by the Order of Saint John, which included the church, the castle, which has already been restored today to commemorate the sixth centenary of the celebration of the Commitment to Caspe, and the convent. In 1936 the altarpieces and the two superb Gothic tombs of the Collegiate Church were destroyed, including that of the great master Juan Fern\u00e1ndez de Heredia. Currently, the Vera Cruz de Caspe, one of the most important relics of Christendom, is guarded inside; It is one of the largest fragments of the cross on which Christ died (Lignum Crucis). In 1908 the church atrium was declared a National Monument and in 1931 the whole of the Collegiate Church was declared a National Monument.\n\nSeveral hermitages are preserved in the streets of Caspe, such as Santa Quiteria (1648), or Montserrat \u2014destroyed during the War of Independence but rebuilt in the 19th century\u2014, Magdalena (1790) and La Balma (1843). In the La Muela neighborhood, the oldest in Caspe, is the Hermitage of San Indalecio, a baroque temple from the 18th century, which consists of a central space with a square plan covered with a hemispherical dome on lunettes illuminated with a lantern.\n\nAnother religious complex is made up of the building and church of San Agust\u00edn, which were part of what was the Convent of San Agust\u00edn de Caspe. Completed the works in 1623, it is an example of ordered and functional architecture that follows the canon of the monastic model of the 17th century. The cloister is the main element of the ensemble.\n\nLocated in front of the railway station, is the Convent of Santo Domingo, whose church is completely in ruins. During the War of Independence it was a military hospital, cemetery, prison and fortress. Again it was a war hospital in the Civil War, being definitively abandoned in 1978.\n\n=== Civil heritage ===\nWithin the civil architecture, the Castle of Commitment stands out, whose origin is due to the knights of the Hospital Order. For years the site was used not only as a castle but also as a convent, along with the neighboring church of Santa Mar\u00eda. In the 19th century the castle almost disappeared, because during the War of Independence, the French troops blew up the convent and also, in the Carlist wars, it was involved in various combats, even being burned down. Currently, there is hardly any element of the fortress \u2014 a wall with a crenellated top with voussoirs decorated with shields \u2014 as well as the basements of the fortress.\n\nAnother notable bulwark is the Torre de Salamanca, which stands on a hill on the outskirts of the city. From the viewpoint located at the top, you can see a spectacular panoramic view of Caspe and the Ebro valley. It was built by order of General Salamanca in the last Carlist war - the third one - in 1874, being the most modern castle in Aragon. It houses the Heraldry Museum, which collects the heraldic symbols that were characteristic of the Crown of Aragon.\n\nIn the urban center, the Plaza Mayor constitutes an interesting complex. On one side of it remain the primitive arcades, in pointed form, called Arcos de Toril, while on the other side is the Town Hall, with a classicist facade from the 19th century, as well as the Casa Palacio Piazuelo Barber\u00e1n, the most notable of the city. On the other hand, Barrio Verde street evokes the Sephardic community, since in the past it was the main axis of the Jewish quarter.\n\nIn the municipal district of Caspe there are two watchtowers from the Carlist Wars: the Turl\u00e1n Tower, located in the Herradura area about 6 km from the city, and the Valdemoro Tower, in the Magdalena district. The latter, with a square floor plan and built in masonry, was erected during the Third Carlist War in order to monitor the Ebro pass. Another enclave of great beauty is the Puente de los Masatrigos, located 12 km from the town center. Although the current bridge is from the 18th century, it is supported by an earlier structure that dates back to the 13th-14th centuries.\n\n=== Natural heritage ===\nThe Mequinenza reservoir or \"Mar de Arag\u00f3n\" is an environment of great fauna and landscape richness. It extends from Mequinenza to the vicinity of S\u00e1stago, going up the old Ebro riverbed. Various facilities allow the practice of numerous water and land sports, but fishing is the star activity in this ecosystem. Caspe is the European capital of black bass or black bass, and fishermen from Europe and America visit this city annually to participate in national and international competitions. During the first weekend of every October the International Black Bass Fishing Championship is held, the most prestigious of all those held in Europe.\n\nAnother specie, the catfish, due to its large size, difficult and tiring fishing, is highly appreciated by the uninitiated. It is interesting to note that both black bass and catfish are newly introduced species. However, carp, crucian carp and alburno are the most abundant fish and the most fish, both spontaneously and in competition. The waters stored by the reservoir are thought to contain more than 50 million fish.\n\n== Parties and events ==\n\n* Fiesta de San Ant\u00f3n, the weekend closest to January 17. Snacks and dinners around multiple bonfires - called 'tederos' - take place throughout the city.\n\n* Easter, declared a festival of tourist interest in Aragon. Drums, drums and bugles accompany the steps of the processions. On Good Friday the Vera Cruz Procession takes place.\n\n* April 30 and May 1. Celebration of the labor party in the Mas de la Punta area, with night camping and musical performances.\n\n* Commemoration of the Caspe Commitment, the last weekend of June. It should be noted the great participation of all the people in the decoration of the streets as well as in the setting of the party with medieval costumes. It has also been declared a festival of regional tourist interest.\n\n* San Roque festivities, from August 12 to 17. On the 16th, the patron saint's feast, there is an offering of fruits as well as a procession to the Hermitage of San Roque. Dances, heifers, competitions and sports activities complete the festive program.\n\n* Regional fair \u00abExpocaspe\u00bb, from October 29 to November 1. It is an agricultural, livestock, industrial and commercial fair in Bajo Arag\u00f3n.\n\n== Sports ==\nIn soccer, the city is represented by the C.D. Caspe. Founded in 1923, its best historical classification was the third place obtained in the Third Division in the 1989/90 season. It disputes its parties like the premises in the field of the Rosales, located in the low part of the city.\n\n== Gastronomy ==\nThe fertile gardens of the municipality produce a series of products that distinguish the gastronomy of Caspe. These include virgin olive oil, olives in all their varieties \u2014 vines, roasts, squash or pat\u00e9\u2014, fried dried tomatoes \u2014 a local specialty \u2014 and cherries. Special mention deserves the unique ''turmas'' (Helianthus tuberosus), defined as \u00abtubers similar to potatoes, but smaller and somewhat harder\u00bb, as well as walnut wine.\n\nAs for confectionery, we must mention the almoj\u00e1banas, the puff pastries, the muffins, the shortbreads of spoon or butter and the renowned Balsa cakes, made with almonds as they were made in medieval times.\n\n== Illustrious Caspolinos ==\n\n* Indalecio, one of the seven apostolic men and first bishop of Almer\u00eda.\n* Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda Puyazuelo (1441 - 1521), who, in 1467, translated the Ethics of Cat\u00f3n in ''redondillas''.

It has a population of 9,525 inhabitants (INE 2018) and its municipality, of 503.33 km\u00b2, is the fourth largest in Aragon.\n\nIt obtained the title of city in the 19th century, as a result of the damage suffered in the Carlist Wars, by concession of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThere is a popular belief that the name of '''Caspe''' comes from ancient inhabitants of the city, originating from the Caspian Sea; However, this etymology lacks philological rigor despite its wide diffusion. The place name ''Casp'' appears documented in Andalusian sources such as Qsp, Qasp or Qasb and has been related to the Arabic word Casba. It is also possible that the name of the city derives from the Indo-European root Cass (holm oak) and the suffix pe (place of or below).\n\n== Geography ==\n'''Caspe''' is located at the 41.2 parallel of north latitude and on the Greenwich meridian. It is 104 km southeast of Zaragoza on the banks of the Guadalope river \u2014which no longer carries water in this section, having been diverted upstream when building the Mequinenza reservoir, also called the \u00abSea of Aragon\u00bb \u2014and a few kilometers from the Ebro. It is 152 meters above sea level in one of the most arid areas of Aragon, with an average temperature of 14.6 \u00b0 C and 325 mm of annual precipitation.\n\nIt is located at the crossroads of two axes: the Ebro \u2014 in an east-west direction, partly used by the railway \u2014 and, perpendicular to it, the one that, starting from Andorra, passes through Alca\u00f1iz and continues to Barbastro and Monz\u00f3n.\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\n'''Caspe''' is home to a great diversity of fauna and flora, due to the landscape combination of the steppe, river, forest and Mediterranean forest.\n\nin terms of birds, it is worth noting a diverse population of birds of prey, such as the golden eagle, griffon vulture, peregrine falcon, common buzzard, goshawk and sparrowhawk throughout the year; European merlin, kite and pale harrier in winter, as well as black kite, Egyptian vulture, European short-toed, alcotan, ash harrier and lesser kestrel in summer. As for nocturnal birds of prey, they live the small owl, owlet, scops owl and owl. Although not as extensive as in the surroundings, Caspe has a population of steppe birds that includes the great bustard, common curlew, both species of bargains, the Ortega and the Iberian, and the cr\u00edalo. The steppe landscape is made up of the juniper juniper and the black juniper, as well as captains, rosemary, thyme and reed beds.\n\nThe riverside forests create a complex habitat that joins the mountain landscapes and rainfed fields. Some waterfowl can be found, such as the mallard duck, gray heron, imperial heron, little bittern, little egret and kingfisher. The riverside forests are mainly made up of black poplars, reeds and reed beds. In the bush and bush landscape some forest species inhabit such as the aforementioned sparrowhawk and goshawk, in addition to countless birds, highlighting the common turtledove and bee-eater in summer, the crossbill, red partridge and the increasingly rare common quail. The Mediterranean and mount forests are mainly made up of Aleppo pine, black juniper and white sable, coscolla, ginesta, romerales and thyme.\n\nAs for mammals, the red deer stands out, since the only deer that never became extinct in Aragon lives in the area; also the wild boar, common badger, common fox, marten, genet, otter, weasel, roe deer, common rabbit, Iberian hare and rodents such as voles or field mice, among others. Caspe's diversity of habitats makes possible the presence of a considerable variety of amphibians and reptiles. In the rafts and puddles of the mountain they breed the common toad, the spur toad, the running toad, the spotted toad, the common frog and the viper snake. In addition, the Ocellated Lizard, Bastard Snake, Horseshoe Snake and Ladder Snake are found throughout the territory, as well as the leper turtle in the river. In some areas of the forest the rare snout viper lives.\n\nAlso, Caspe has a considerable population of white stork in the convent of Santo Domingo and the Collegiate Church of Santa Mar\u00eda la Mayor, with a total of 17 couples (2018).\n<br />\n\n== Prehistory and archeology ==\nThe municipality of Caspe seems to have been one of the last to be populated within Bajo Arag\u00f3n, either due to environmental problems for the prehistoric habitat or because erosion has destroyed the deposits.\n\nHowever, in the area of Cauvaca an amygdaloid biface has been discovered that can be ascribed to a generic Achelense or an initial Musterian, whose age is 150,000 - 100,000 years, and that demonstrates, at least, the passage through this area of groups of Neanderthal hunter-gatherers. Likewise, lithic pieces similar to the previous one have been found in Soto de Vinu\u00e9 V.\n\nWithin the ''Rock art'', the site of the Plano del Polido stands out. Located in a small open hole in the sandstone rock, it contains a set of Levantine-style cave paintings. The composition brings together several figures, highlighting a magnificent deer in an alert attitude to start the fight with another congener that appears with the low antlers. Between both figures a female doe can be seen, in a lower position, and there is also a fourth figure, quite lost, which is possibly another doe. Various remains of paint on the far right of the composition seem to correspond to the figure of an archer.\n\nThe great demographic and cultural emergence of Caspe took place around the 8th century BC with the appearance of innumerable towns and tumular necropolises of Indo-European, Celtic hallstatt from the first Iron Age, which correspond to populations mainly from the Segre basin and the high Ebro basin, especially from Navarra and \u00c1lava.\n\nAmong the deposits of this final Bronze, it is worth mentioning that of the Cabezos de Sancharanc\u00f3n. This town is located on the road from Caspe to Zaragoceta. On a conical hill with a large number of sandstone blocks that accumulate on the slopes, the quadrangular houses are distributed. The ceramic materials collected on the surface typologically fit with those of the advanced Middle Bronze, although there are also very few remains of vessels that can be attributed to the culture of the '''Urnfield culture''', in addition to flint-carved products.\n\nAnother interesting deposit is the Cabezo de Monle\u00f3n, on the Guadalope river, having identified 52 houses that make up a central street plan. Its population has been estimated at about 300 inhabitants and the life of those shepherds, metallurgists and cereal farmers could have been extended between 800 BC and iberization.\n\nThe deposit of Loma de los Brunos dates from the Iberian era, located in the vicinity of the Civ\u00e1n dam. It corresponds to the old phase of Iberian settlement (6th to 5th centuries BC). Chronologically later is the town of La Tallada, occupied since the 4th century BC. Until its destruction and abandonment in the 1st century BC. Located on the top of a hill, it is medium in size and consists of rectangular houses, many of them carved out of the rock.\n\nFrom the 1st century, the Ebro valley was fully Romanized and the sites, identified as Roman villas, of Azud de Civ\u00e1n, Boquera del Regallo I-II, Mas de Rabel, Campo de R\u00e1fales, Picard\u00edas, Soto de Ba\u00f1os, El Fond\u00f3n and Miralpeix date from that time. From this last enclave is the Miralpeix Mausoleum, which was moved to its current location as a result of the construction of the Mequinenza reservoir that led to the flooding of the monument. It was built in the late 2nd or early 3rd century AD. C.9\n\nLikewise, local historiography mentions the remains of the city of Trabia, an indigenous population destroyed by the Romans who came to coin money. Both Trabia and the nearby place of Valdurrios are pre-Roman place names. According to some authors, a medieval town was built on its ruins that did not last. Since the middle of the 12th century, Trabia had owned its ''carta puebla'', which indicates that the place had some importance. It was inhabited at least until 1440, year in which it is still recorded that the figure of Justice existed in the place\n\n==History==\n\nA legend says that Caspe was founded by T\u00fabal, son of Jafet and grandson of Noah, in the expedition that he carried up the waters of the Ebro to Logro\u00f1o.\n\n=== Old age ===\nIt has been maintained that, before the Roman conquest of Hispania, the lands that the municipality currently occupies were inhabited by the sedetanos, an Iberian group from the 3rd century BC. However, recent investigations place the tribe of the Ausetans or Ositans in the Caspe region, whose capital, Osicerda, would be located in the Cabezo Palao de Alca\u00f1iz. This city-state and its territory possibly reached the Ebro to the north and the Matarra\u00f1a river to the east, a border line between Ositans and ilercavones.\n\n=== Middle Age ===\nSince the arrival of the muslims in 713, to the Christian reconquest in the first half of the 12th century, the lands of the Ebro constituted the northernmost mark of Al-Andalus, a sector occupied by the Yemeni contingent. In this territory, the latin culture predominated over the Hispanic-Roman and Visigoth indigenous population of Christians and Jews; but from the 10th century on, the Arabization and Islamization of the population prevailed, leaving Christians and Jews relegated to a small percentage.\n\nBetween June and September 1169, Caspe was integrated into the Crown of Aragon by King Alfonso II. The conquest of the town was carried out under the direction of the Count of Pallars, Arnal de Mir, and his son Ram\u00f3n, in collaboration with other feudal lords. In the Annals of the Crown of Aragon by Jer\u00f3nimo Zurita, the following is narrated:<blockquote>At this time, the Moors who were in the region of the Edetanos in the castles and forces they had on the banks of the Algas river were waging a great war ... And Caspe was won, a very important place along the banks of the Ebro And from there the war continued on the banks of Guadalob and the Calanda river.</blockquote>It is estimated that the number of inhabitants of Caspe, at the time of the reconquest, could have been somewhat higher than 1,000 inhabitants, being its population overwhelmingly Islamic. Muslims were allowed to keep their religious practices, although they had a year to leave their own home before moving outside the walls. As for the Jews, although it cannot be specified when they arrived in Caspe, what is certain is that when the troops of Alfonso II entered, there were already Jews in the La Muela neighborhood living with the Muslims.\n\nThe town then passed to the Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem through the exchange carried out with Alfonso II for other assets of the order. Its castle was used as residence of the bailiwick of the Hospital. The population managed to stabilize in the last quarter of the 13th century, after Garcel\u00e1n de Timor was appointed commander of the Bailiwick of Caspe. The town, which then had about 1,500 inhabitants, expanded from La Muela to the surrounding farmhouse with the castle of the Order at the top and the church of Santa Mar\u00eda for the whole of the Christian community.\n\nIn 1392, Juan Fern\u00e1ndez de Heredia, grand master of the order, bought all the possessions in the town from the Ses\u00e9 family to found a convent. It elevated the church to the category of Collegiate Church and increased the importance of the Sanjuanista Convent by endowing it with treasures and relics such as the \"Lignum Crucis\". When he died, his body was brought from Avignon and buried in the convent church, in a tomb that he himself had carved.\n\nIn medieval times, Caspe was the largest aragonese center and one of the largest in Spain in the production of glass. It is known of the existence of thirty glass furnaces in its municipal area. The large amount of saline soils favored the growth of the ''barilla'', which together with the quality and quantity of the sand, were the basic elements for the production of glass. It seems that the Jews were the first involved in this industry, mainly between the 14th and 15th centuries. Much of the glaziers belonged to the most important families in the town.\n\nIn the fourteenth century, the black plague ravaged the Kingdom of Aragon; There is evidence that the epidemic was installed in Caspe in 1371, even forcing the transfer of the sessions of the Cortes Generales. According to the Anales de Valima\u00f1a, about 300 people died in the town, victims of the deadly disease.\n\nThe population was the scene in 1412 of the historic \"Compromiso de Caspe\", when Martin I of Aragon died without descendants. On April 22 of that year, the deliberations of the delegates began, and on June 28 he was proclaimed King Fernando de Trastamara, called that of Antequera, as Fernando I de Arag\u00f3n. In front of the door that gives access to the atrium of the Collegiate Church of Santa Mar\u00eda la Mayor a platform was erected from which the people were informed of the declaration of right voted by the delegates of the States of the Crown of Aragon in favor of Don Fernando . The following day, Fray Vicente de Ferrer preached at the church, who took a very active part in the sessions of the well-known Commitment.\n\nAfter the Commitment, Caspe remained for the rest of the XV century as a thriving town with its neighborhoods of La Muela, San Roque and El Pueyo, an agriculture that took advantage of the irrigation of the Ebro and Guadalope prospering. At that time the town had the visit of Pope Benedict XIII, better known as Pope Luna, who came to settle matters between his own family, the Luna, and the Urrea.\n\n=== Modern age ===\nUntil 1610, the Christian and Muslim communities continued to populate the town. Although they shared the old irrigated land, each had its own municipal area, as well as its own communal assets. Both were vassals of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem.\n\nDue to its geographical situation, Caspe has been one of the most affected populations by the different conflicts that have occurred in Spain since the 17th century. In the Catalan uprising (1640-1652), it was victim of incursions and raids by the Franco-Catalan troops, as well as fiscal exactions from the monarchy, both of which made a serious impact on its economic situation. In the War of Succession (1701-1711) it was a follower of the Bourbon cause while its neighbors opted for the Austrian aspirant.\n\n=== XIX century ===\nDuring the War of Independence, Caspe was occupied by French troops with little resistance on March 4, 1809. Abandoned soon after, it was definitively occupied from June 1809 to 1813. The most important figure in that period was that of the local lawyer Agust\u00edn de Quinto, ''afrancesado'' who collaborated in government tasks together with the French. In November 1810, Suchet appointed him as General Commissar of the left bank of the Ebro, making Caspe, thanks to Quinto's residence in the town, the capital of the lower half of Aragon. At the end of the war (June 1813), Colonel Ram\u00f3n Gay\u00e1n arrived in Caspe determined to take the city from the French. To lift the siege, which lasted fifteen days, he resorted to the construction of two mines: one, from Calle de San Juan to the cellars of the Convent, and the other from the Revuelta. The explosion of the latter damaged the basement of the Castle - where the French had barricaded themselves - but forced them to flee to Mequinenza.\n\nLater, the town was affected by the Carlist Wars, which had special relevance for the population. This was a consequence of the strategic location of the Caspe region, as well as the confiscation of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, which generated the discontent of the peasantry at the expectations created, and the loss of purchasing power of peasants, day laborers and artisans, due to the fall in the price of oil. These factors led to the start of the war a not very large group of Caspolinos escaped to the Carlist faction.14\n\nCaspe was the object of the Carlist incursions, suffering sieges, assaults and ephemeral occupations. In May 1835, during the First Carlist War, General Cabrera managed to seize part of the population; in the few hours that the Carlists occupied it, they took important spoils, looting the houses of the Queen's supporters. The following month, Llagostera took control of the first urban enclosure, burning the city afterwards; a year later he managed to take it again, to abandon it soon after. In November 1836 he returned to seize the town, retaining it in his power for eleven days. And in June 1837, Carlist troops took Caspe but, before retiring, burned the town. According to official reports, 223 houses burned, and the fire could not be quenched until the next day. The economic consequences derived from these events must have been significant, causing that henceforth, when there was news of the Carlists entering, the inhabitants flee to the farms. \n\nPascual Madoz, in his 1845 Geographic-Statistical-Historical Dictionary of Spain, describes Caspe in the following terms: <blockquote>It is located on the banks of the Guadalope river, near its confluence with the Ebro, on 3 or 4 small hills ... It is formed by 1,500 fairly regular houses, distributed in 70 fairly wide streets, 9 squares and a main square with an almost circular figure in the center of the town ... It also has a small fort supported by what was previously a parish church and the convent of San Juan.</blockquote>Regarding its production, it indicates that:<blockquote>The main of these is that of oil; many cereals are also harvested; the wine harvest has declined somewhat and the same happens with that of silk. There are abundant and exquisite fruits of all kinds and legumes and vegetables; likewise hemp and flax; sheep and goats are raised.</blockquote>In 1861, in the interval between the Second and the Third Carlist War, Caspe obtained the city title. However, the political instability of the revolutionary six-year period led to a new boom for Carlist activities and, with the proclamation of the First Republic (February 11, 1873), the Third Carlist War reached its greatest intensity. The most notable event took place in October of that same year when the Carlist troops from Vall\u00e9s entered Caspe without encountering any resistance; in fact, 600 caspolinos joined the Carlists, setting fire to the Bail\u00edo Castle and the old Convent of San Juan. In February 1874, a new Carlist raid took place, led this time by Marco de Bello, in order to raise funds for the purchase of weapons and to pay for the uniforms worn by his combatants.\n\nProbably, the most relevant economic event for Caspe in the 19th century was the arrival of the railway. In June 1876, the municipality agreed to grant a series of privileges to the company that carried out the layout more quickly. Thus, in September 1891, work began on the municipal area of \u200b\u200bthe city, finally reaching the route on October 13, 1893.\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nIn 1926 the Ebro Hydrographic Confederation was created in Caspe, an organization that manages the waters and irrigation of the Ebro hydrographic basin, the most important of the ten that have been created in the peninsular territory.\n\nAlready proclaimed the Second Spanish Republic, the draft of the Statute of Autonomy of Aragon of 1936 was drafted in this city, also known as the Statute of Caspe, which was not ratified by the Cortes at the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. During the first part of the war, Caspe was the seat of the Council of Aragon, a government body created by the anarchists in 1936. This entity continued its functions until it was dissolved by government authorities in the summer of 1937, due to its independence from the Republican government. On August 4, the Minister of National Defense, Indalecio Prieto, issued orders to the Army and the 11th Division, under Enrique L\u00edster was sent to Aragon, officially dissolving the Council of Aragon on August. This dissolution took place through a military intervention that took Caspe by surprise.The CNT Local Federation of Trade Unions was taken by assault, tanks and artillery were concentrated at the exit of the city and some confrontations with casualties took place. Joaqu\u00edn Ascaso, President of the Council of Aragon, and its anarchist members were arrested on various charges.\n\nWith the offensive of Aragon in 1938, the republican chief of staff, General Vicente Rojo, installed his operations center in this city, concentrating there all the International Brigades that he was able to gather. On March 15 the Battle of Caspe began, when three Francoist divisions of the Moroccan Army Corps reached the suburbs of the town. The 1st Division of Navarra undertook the siege of Caspe, being present, in the first phase of the battle, the International Brigades XI, XIII and XV; In a second phase that took place on the right bank of the Guadalope river, XII and XIV intervened. Although the ''interbrigadistas'', especially those of the XV Brigade, deployed a strong defense against the attackers, at dusk on March 17 the town was finally conquered by Franco's troops.The war part of the \"national\" side recorded the fact with these words: <blockquote>This morning the important city of Caspe has been occupied, also establishing a bridgehead 5 kilometers to the east, despite the stubborn resistance opposed by five international brigades.</blockquote>After the conquest, the town became the headquarters of the Moroccan Army Corps, in charge of the troops of the Ebro river.\n\n== Demography ==\nIn the document of 1495 \u2014census of the Kingdom of Aragon ordered by King Fernando the Catholic\u2014, Caspe has 295 households, which is equivalent to an approximate population of 1,600 inhabitants. Among them were 10% of Mudejar Muslims, 5% of Jews and 6% of clerics, including Hospital Order knights.\n\nThe 1857 census of Spain, which inaugurated the statistical series, records a population of 10,609 inhabitants in the town, being at that time the third most populous nucleus in the province of Zaragoza, after the capital and Calatayud. Within the century XX, Caspe reached the maximum population, 9,981 inhabitants, in 1950. Starting in the 1960s, the rural exodus began, which affected all of Aragon, resulting in a decrease in the population.\n\nIn 2018 the population of Caspe reached 9,525 inhabitants, similar to the one it had in the middle of the 20th century. On the other hand, in recent years there has been a considerable increase in the immigrant population.\n<br />\n\n== Economy ==\nThe city's economy is based on agriculture and the service sector\n\nThe basic crop has been the olive tree; from it, an industrial and exporting activity of oil and olives is developed, being the region  included within the scope of the recently approved designation of origin production label. The existence of a benign microclimate and a good irrigation system - due to the confluence of the Guadalope and the Ebro - lead to numerous plantations of fruit trees, especially cherry trees. Around agricultural production there is an important industry of canned vegetables and pickles.\n\nLikewise, animal farming has a great development, existing in Caspe a municipal slaughterhouse and an agricultural market.\n\nAnother fundamental sector in the local industry is textiles, a sector that has a great expansion in Caspe and its region. Likewise, the manufacturing industries, metal processing and various workshops are especially numerous, being located in Caspe the General Warehouse for Spain of the sports firm Adidas. The city has four industrial estates, called \"El Castillo\", \"El Portal\", \"Cabezo Mancebo\" and \"Los Arcos\".\n\nAs for the fair activity, Caspe hosts an event in autumn \"Expocaspe\", the agricultural, livestock, industrial and commercial fair of Bajo Arag\u00f3n. Another convention that takes place in the city is \"Naupesca\", dedicated to hunting, fishing and water sports.\n\nThe \"Dynamization Plan of the Tourist Product of the Bajo Arag\u00f3n-Caspe / Baix Arag\u00f3-Casp Region\" is a recent initiative to turn tourism into an engine for economic development for the area.\n\n== Heritage ==\nRegarding with its history, Caspe has an important historical heritage. Among the oldest remains are the cave paintings in the shelter of the Plano del Pulido, declared a World Heritage Site by Unesco since 1998, as well as several Neolithic sites.\n\nFrom the Roman period is the Miralpeix Mausoleum, declared a national monument in 1931. It consists of a rectangular cella with side walls that support a barrel vault framed in front with two pilasters with Corinthian columns.\n\n=== Religious heritage ===\nThe Hermitage of Santa Mar\u00eda de Horta - rescued from the Mequinenza reservoir and rebuilt on top of a hill overlooking Caspe - is a Romanesque construction. The temple was erected by people from the town of Miralpeix in a popular Romanesque style between the end of the 12th century or the beginning of the 13th century. It is built in ashlar masonry and has an elongated keyhole-shaped plan, divided into five  sections.Also known as Santa Mar\u00eda del Fond\u00f3n, due to its primitive location, it has an interesting semicircular apse.\n\nThe Collegiate Church of Santa Mar\u00eda la Mayor del Pilar is by far the most monumental building in Caspe. It is one of the most notable examples of purist Gothic in Aragon, still influenced by the Cistercian style. The temple consists of three naves, the central nave being the widest and tallest, all of it covered by a ribbed vault. It was consecrated by Hadrian VI in 1522 and previously, in 1412, the mass proclaiming the ruling of the Caspe Commitment was held there. Located in the highest area of \u200b\u200bthe urban area, it was part of an acropolis organized by the Order of Saint John, which included the church, the castle, which has already been restored today to commemorate the sixth centenary of the celebration of the Commitment to Caspe, and the convent. In 1936 the altarpieces and the two superb Gothic tombs of the Collegiate Church were destroyed, including that of the great master Juan Fern\u00e1ndez de Heredia. Currently, the Vera Cruz de Caspe, one of the most important relics of Christendom, is guarded inside; It is one of the largest fragments of the cross on which Christ died (Lignum Crucis). In 1908 the church atrium was declared a National Monument and in 1931 the whole of the Collegiate Church was declared a National Monument.\n\nSeveral hermitages are preserved in the streets of Caspe, such as Santa Quiteria (1648), or Montserrat \u2014destroyed during the War of Independence but rebuilt in the 19th century\u2014, Magdalena (1790) and La Balma (1843). In the La Muela neighborhood, the oldest in Caspe, is the Hermitage of San Indalecio, a baroque temple from the 18th century, which consists of a central space with a square plan covered with a hemispherical dome on lunettes illuminated with a lantern.\n\nAnother religious complex is made up of the building and church of San Agust\u00edn, which were part of what was the Convent of San Agust\u00edn de Caspe. Completed the works in 1623, it is an example of ordered and functional architecture that follows the canon of the monastic model of the 17th century. The cloister is the main element of the ensemble.\n\nLocated in front of the railway station, is the Convent of Santo Domingo, whose church is completely in ruins. During the War of Independence it was a military hospital, cemetery, prison and fortress. Again it was a war hospital in the Civil War, being definitively abandoned in 1978.\n\n=== Civil heritage ===\nWithin the civil architecture, the Castle of Commitment stands out, whose origin is due to the knights of the Hospital Order. For years the site was used not only as a castle but also as a convent, along with the neighboring church of Santa Mar\u00eda. In the 19th century the castle almost disappeared, because during the War of Independence, the French troops blew up the convent and also, in the Carlist wars, it was involved in various combats, even being burned down. Currently, there is hardly any element of the fortress \u2014 a wall with a crenellated top with voussoirs decorated with shields \u2014 as well as the basements of the fortress.\n\nAnother notable bulwark is the Torre de Salamanca, which stands on a hill on the outskirts of the city. From the viewpoint located at the top, you can see a spectacular panoramic view of Caspe and the Ebro valley. It was built by order of General Salamanca in the last Carlist war - the third one - in 1874, being the most modern castle in Aragon. It houses the Heraldry Museum, which collects the heraldic symbols that were characteristic of the Crown of Aragon.\n\nIn the urban center, the Plaza Mayor constitutes an interesting complex. On one side of it remain the primitive arcades, in pointed form, called Arcos de Toril, while on the other side is the Town Hall, with a classicist facade from the 19th century, as well as the Casa Palacio Piazuelo Barber\u00e1n, the most notable of the city. On the other hand, Barrio Verde street evokes the Sephardic community, since in the past it was the main axis of the Jewish quarter.\n\nIn the municipal district of Caspe there are two watchtowers from the Carlist Wars: the Turl\u00e1n Tower, located in the Herradura area about 6 km from the city, and the Valdemoro Tower, in the Magdalena district. The latter, with a square floor plan and built in masonry, was erected during the Third Carlist War in order to monitor the Ebro pass. Another enclave of great beauty is the Puente de los Masatrigos, located 12 km from the town center. Although the current bridge is from the 18th century, it is supported by an earlier structure that dates back to the 13th-14th centuries.\n\n=== Natural heritage ===\nThe Mequinenza reservoir or \"Mar de Arag\u00f3n\" is an environment of great fauna and landscape richness. It extends from Mequinenza to the vicinity of S\u00e1stago, going up the old Ebro riverbed. Various facilities allow the practice of numerous water and land sports, but fishing is the star activity in this ecosystem. Caspe is the European capital of black bass or black bass, and fishermen from Europe and America visit this city annually to participate in national and international competitions. During the first weekend of every October the International Black Bass Fishing Championship is held, the most prestigious of all those held in Europe.\n\nAnother specie, the catfish, due to its large size, difficult and tiring fishing, is highly appreciated by the uninitiated. It is interesting to note that both black bass and catfish are newly introduced species. However, carp, crucian carp and alburno are the most abundant fish and the most fish, both spontaneously and in competition. The waters stored by the reservoir are thought to contain more than 50 million fish.\n\n== Parties and events ==\n\n* Fiesta de San Ant\u00f3n, the weekend closest to January 17. Snacks and dinners around multiple bonfires - called 'tederos' - take place throughout the city.\n\n* Easter, declared a festival of tourist interest in Aragon. Drums, drums and bugles accompany the steps of the processions. On Good Friday the Vera Cruz Procession takes place.\n\n* April 30 and May 1. Celebration of the labor party in the Mas de la Punta area, with night camping and musical performances.\n\n* Commemoration of the Caspe Commitment, the last weekend of June. It should be noted the great participation of all the people in the decoration of the streets as well as in the setting of the party with medieval costumes. It has also been declared a festival of regional tourist interest.\n\n* San Roque festivities, from August 12 to 17. On the 16th, the patron saint's feast, there is an offering of fruits as well as a procession to the Hermitage of San Roque. Dances, heifers, competitions and sports activities complete the festive program.\n\n* Regional fair \u00abExpocaspe\u00bb, from October 29 to November 1. It is an agricultural, livestock, industrial and commercial fair in Bajo Arag\u00f3n.\n\n== Sports ==\nIn soccer, the city is represented by the C.D. Caspe. Founded in 1923, its best historical classification was the third place obtained in the Third Division in the 1989/90 season. It disputes its parties like the premises in the field of the Rosales, located in the low part of the city.\n\n== Gastronomy ==\nThe fertile gardens of the municipality produce a series of products that distinguish the gastronomy of Caspe. These include virgin olive oil, olives in all their varieties \u2014 vines, roasts, squash or pat\u00e9\u2014, fried dried tomatoes \u2014 a local specialty \u2014 and cherries. Special mention deserves the unique ''turmas'' (Helianthus tuberosus), defined as \u00abtubers similar to potatoes, but smaller and somewhat harder\u00bb, as well as walnut wine.\n\nAs for confectionery, we must mention the almoj\u00e1banas, the puff pastries, the muffins, the shortbreads of spoon or butter and the renowned Balsa cakes, made with almonds as they were made in medieval times.\n\n== Illustrious Caspolinos ==\n\n* Indalecio, one of the seven apostolic men and first bishop of Almer\u00eda.\n* Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda Puyazuelo (1441 - 1521), who, in 1467, translated the Ethics of Cat\u00f3n in ''redondillas''.

During his manager's daughter's wedding, he comes across Malarvizhi ([[Keerthy Suresh]]), a medical student from [[Kallidaikurichi]] in [[Tirunelveli district]], and immediately falls in love with her. When he goes to the [[CMBT|Koyambedu bus station]] to propose his love to Malar before she leaves Chennai, he notices her cornered by a group of thugs who plan to kill her as she was allegedly involved in an attack on a Union Minister's ([[Sharath Lohitashwa]]) son Charan ([[Roshan Basheer]]). However, they back off after receiving a call from one Periyakannu alias PK ([[Jagapathi Babu]]) from [[Tirunelveli]], who tells them not to harm her. Bairavaa confronts Malar, who tells him why PK spared her life.\n\nMalar studies in PK Medical College in Tirunelveli, whose chairman is PK, a criminal don and politician who runs Tirunelveli along with his right-hand man Kottai Veeran ([[Daniel Balaji]]). The college has no basic facilities, including a proper building and good doctors. Malar and her friend Vaishali ([[Aparna Vinod]]) lodged a complaint against the college to the [[Medical Council of India|MCI]], who decided to blacklist the college after noting the poor facilities. To save his reputation, PK made a deal with the MCI officials to revoke the suspension in exchange for them having sex with a girl from the college. Vaishali, who was the girl chosen by the officials, was found raped and killed the next morning. Malar's father ([[Aadukalam Naren]]), a sincere police officer, began an investigation into PK's involvement in Vaishali's death, but he too was killed by PK in retribution. After her father's death, Malar dragged PK to court, where the judge declared that Malar should not be expelled and must not be harmed till the case is resolved, even though she had filed the complaint against PK. Though PK respects the judge's decision, he harasses Malar indirectly through the college lecturers and by cutting power and water to her locality. He plans to kill her once the verdict is declared in his favour. During the marriage, Malar had given the video evidence of Vaishali being raped to Charan, since, being a Union Minister's son, he would have access to the [[National Informatics Centre|NIC]] where the video would be investigated. Charan was later attacked by PK's henchmen, who then took away the video evidence and put the blame on Malar. Bairavaa, on hearing Malar's story, decides to help her fight PK and get justice for Vaishali and leaves for Kallidaikurichi with her.\n\nPosing as an [[income tax]] officer, Bairavaa conducts a raid at PK's mansion, taking away all the evidence which holds PK responsible for Vaishali's death. PK soon realizes that Bairavaa is after him, and a cat-and-mouse game begins between Bairavaa and PK. In the process, PK gets back the evidence and destroys them, leaving Bairavaa with no evidence to implicate PK, though he manages to get five more days time from the court to get the required evidence. Meanwhile, Kottai Veeran's wife (Vishalini), who was terminally ill, passes away. Bairavaa decides to take advantage of Kottai Veeran's love for his wife to get him on his side and make him approver against PK. He switches PK's [[asthma]] inhaler with [[nitrous oxide]]. PK, who inadvertently inhales the gas before going to Kottai Veeran's wife's funeral, begins to laugh uncontrollably, even during the funeral, causing Kottai Veeran to turn against him and accept Bairavaa's offer of becoming approver. In revenge for betraying him, PK confronts Kottai Veeran and hacks him to death.\n\nBairavaa decides to finish off PK once and for all as that is the only way he can now get justice for Malar and Vaishali. He frames PK for plotting to assassinate the [[Prime Minister of India]] while he is on the way to the [[Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant]]. The news spreads all across India and soon it is ordered to shoot PK on sight. PK, realizing that he is cornered, tries to kill Bairavaa before he dies, but Bairavaa manages to dodge him. He then disguises himself as a [[National Security Guard|NSG]] commando, blends in with the real NSG commandos who have arrived at the building, and kills PK.\n\nIn the end, the verdict is declared in favor of Bairavaa and Malar. PK's henchmen are arrested, while the students of PK Medical College are shifted to another college. In a press conference, Bairavaa, while supporting private colleges, says that it is important that the person heading such colleges is honest and sincere enough to ensure that the students are safe and receive a good education.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] as Bairavaa \n* [[Keerthy Suresh]] as Malarvizhi \"Malar\"\n* [[Jagapathi Babu]] as Periyakannu \"PK\"\n* [[Daniel Balaji]] as Kottai Veeran\n* [[Sathish]] as Shanmugam\n* [[Thambi Ramaiah]] as Narayanan\n* [[Mime Gopi]] as Karuvadu Kumar\n* [[Sija Rose]] as Poongodi, Malar's sister\n* [[Harish Uthaman]] as Prabha, Malar's brother-in-law\n* [[Aparna Vinod]] as Vaishali\n* [[Papri Ghosh]] as Shailaja Venkatesan\n* [[Sriman (actor)|Sriman]] as PK's assistant\n* [[Aadukalam Naren]] as Malar's father\n* [[Sharath Lohitashwa]] as Union Minister\n* [[Roshan Basheer]] as Charan\n* [[Rajendran]] as M.

During his manager's daughter's wedding, he comes across Malarvizhi ([[Keerthy Suresh]]), a medical student from [[Kallidaikurichi]] in [[Tirunelveli district]], and immediately falls in love with her. When he goes to the [[CMBT|Koyambedu bus station]] to propose his love to Malar before she leaves Chennai, he notices her cornered by a group of thugs who plan to kill her as she was allegedly involved in an attack on a Union Minister's ([[Sharath Lohitashwa]]) son Charan ([[Roshan Basheer]]). However, they back off after receiving a call from one Periyakannu alias PK ([[Jagapathi Babu]]) from [[Tirunelveli]], who tells them not to harm her. Bairavaa confronts Malar, who tells him why PK spared her life.\n\nMalar studies in PK Medical College in Tirunelveli, whose chairman is PK, a criminal don and politician who runs Tirunelveli along with his right-hand man Kottai Veeran ([[Daniel Balaji]]). The college has no basic facilities, including a proper building and good doctors. Malar and her friend Vaishali ([[Aparna Vinod]]) lodged a complaint against the college to the [[Medical Council of India|MCI]], who decided to blacklist the college after noting the poor facilities. To save his reputation, PK made a deal with the MCI officials to revoke the suspension in exchange for them having sex with a girl from the college. Vaishali, who was the girl chosen by the officials, was found raped and killed the next morning. Malar's father ([[Aadukalam Naren]]), a sincere police officer, began an investigation into PK's involvement in Vaishali's death, but he too was killed by PK in retribution. After her father's death, Malar dragged PK to court, where the judge declared that Malar should not be expelled and must not be harmed till the case is resolved, even though she had filed the complaint against PK. Though PK respects the judge's decision, he harasses Malar indirectly through the college lecturers and by cutting power and water to her locality. He plans to kill her once the verdict is declared in his favour. During the marriage, Malar had given the video evidence of Vaishali being raped to Charan, since, being a Union Minister's son, he would have access to the [[National Informatics Centre|NIC]] where the video would be investigated. Charan was later attacked by PK's henchmen, who then took away the video evidence and put the blame on Malar. Bairavaa, on hearing Malar's story, decides to help her fight PK and get justice for Vaishali and leaves for Kallidaikurichi with her.\n\nPosing as an [[income tax]] officer, Bairavaa conducts a raid at PK's mansion, taking away all the evidence which holds PK responsible for Vaishali's death. PK soon realizes that Bairavaa is after him, and a cat-and-mouse game begins between Bairavaa and PK. In the process, PK gets back the evidence and destroys them, leaving Bairavaa with no evidence to implicate PK, though he manages to get five more days time from the court to get the required evidence. Meanwhile, Kottai Veeran's wife (Vishalini), who was terminally ill, passes away. Bairavaa decides to take advantage of Kottai Veeran's love for his wife to get him on his side and make him approver against PK. He switches PK's [[asthma]] inhaler with [[nitrous oxide]]. PK, who inadvertently inhales the gas before going to Kottai Veeran's wife's funeral, begins to laugh uncontrollably, even during the funeral, causing Kottai Veeran to turn against him and accept Bairavaa's offer of becoming approver. In revenge for betraying him, PK confronts Kottai Veeran and hacks him to death.\n\nBairavaa decides to finish off PK once and for all as that is the only way he can now get justice for Malar and Vaishali. He frames PK for plotting to assassinate the [[Prime Minister of India]] while he is on the way to the [[Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant]]. The news spreads all across India and soon it is ordered to shoot PK on sight. PK, realizing that he is cornered, tries to kill Bairavaa before he dies, but Bairavaa manages to dodge him. He then disguises himself as a [[National Security Guard|NSG]] commando, blends in with the real NSG commandos who have arrived at the building, and kills PK.\n\nIn the end, the verdict is declared in favor of Bairavaa and Malar. PK's henchmen are arrested, while the students of PK Medical College are shifted to another college. In a press conference, Bairavaa, while supporting private colleges, says that it is important that the person heading such colleges is honest and sincere enough to ensure that the students are safe and receive a good education.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] as Bairavaa \n* [[Keerthy Suresh]] as Malarvizhi \"Malar\"\n* [[Jagapathi Babu]] as Periyakannu \"PK\"\n* [[Daniel Balaji]] as Kottai Veeran\n* [[Sathish]] as Shanmugam\n* [[Thambi Ramaiah]] as Narayanan\n* [[Mime Gopi]] as Karuvadu Kumar\n* [[Sija Rose]] as Poongodi, Malar's sister\n* [[Harish Uthaman]] as Prabha, Malar's brother-in-law\n* [[Aparna Vinod]] as Vaishali\n* [[Papri Ghosh]] as Shailaja Venkatesan\n* [[Sriman (actor)|Sriman]] as PK's assistant\n* [[Aadukalam Naren]] as Malar's father\n* [[Sharath Lohitashwa]] as Union Minister\n* [[Roshan Basheer]] as Charan\n* [[Rajendran]] as M.

He has a romantic relationship with Angel Aasirvatham, a [[physiotherapy|physiotherapist]] who comically refuses to marry any groom at the last minute due to their love during her wedding. He has a running feud with a rival don named Daniel. One night, Daniel attacks Michael and his close friend Kathir, who is the coach of the [[Tamil Nadu]] women's [[association football|football]] team. Kathir suffers spinal injuries during the attack, due to which he is paralyzed for a year. To allow the women's football team to take part in the upcoming National Championship in [[Delhi]], Kathir requests to the Tamil Nadu Football Federation to replace him with his former teammate named \"Bigil\", who is none other than Michael. The story then shifts to Michael's past as a football player.\n\nSeven years earlier, Michael was an aspiring footballer and contributed to victories for the Tamil Nadu football team along with Kathir. His father was Rayappan, a don who had a feud with a rival don named Alex, who was Daniel's father. Rayappan encouraged his son's passion for football as he did not want him to end up as a criminal like him. When Michael was unable to make it to the [[India national football team|Indian football team]] due to Rayappan's criminal record, Rayappan personally took up the matter with the [[All India Football Federation]] president J. K. Sharma and forcefully ensured Sharma to include Michael and Kathir in the Indian team probable list. However, despite Rayappan's efforts, Michael's football career was cut short as he witnessed Rayappan being killed by Alex and Daniel, just when he was about to leave for Delhi to attend the selection trial for the Indian football team. Michael then killed Alex in front of Daniel, thereby taking revenge for Rayappan's death, and stayed back in Chennai to become the new leader of his father's gang.\n\nIn the present day, Michael accepts Kathir's request to coach the women's football team and leaves for Delhi with the team, with Angel also accompanying them as team physiotherapist. However, due to his criminal background, the girls refuse to cooperate with him, even blaming him for the team's opening loss to [[Manipur]] in the National Championship and requesting the Federation to have him removed. Dejected, Michael gives his resignation to Sharma, but he soon realises that Sharma is targeting him in revenge for the humiliation that he had faced at the hands of Rayappan to allow him into the Indian football team. Sharma sends armed assailants to attack Michael; however, Michael subdues the assailants and withdraws his resignation. He convinces the girls to support him and starts training them hard with the sole focus of winning the Championship. He even manages to bring back two former key players to boost the team's strength: Gayathri, a [[Tamil Brahmin|Brahmin]] girl who had to quit playing football after she was married to a conservative family; and Anitha, who went into depression and refused to leave her room after a man [[acid attack|threw acid]] on her face as she spurned his advances. Despite Sharma trying to rig the team's next match against [[Haryana]] so that they will be eliminated and sent home, they manage to beat Haryana and win all their remaining matches, eventually qualifying for the Final at Chennai, where they are to play Manipur again.\n\nOn the eve of the Final, one of the team's players, Vembu, is kidnapped and forcefully injected with [[cocaine]] by Daniel, who is hired by Sharma in order to sabotage the team's chances of winning the Championship. Though she recovers, she is unable to play in the final as she would fail the dope test. The team's captain, Thendral, is also kidnapped by Daniel, who attempts to forcefully inject cocaine on her as well; however, Michael manages to rescue her. Michael proceeds to kill Daniel once and for all, but when he sees Daniel's young son, he changes his mind and spares Daniel, as he does not want the young boy's future to end up like him by seeing his father die. The next day, Tamil Nadu plays the Final against Manipur without Vembu. The match turns out to be a thriller with Tamil Nadu winning the Championship through a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]]. Michael and the team dedicate their success to Kathir, who is watching the match from the dugout in a wheelchair.\n\nDuring the [[Closing credits|credits]], Michael gets Sharma framed for drug possession, leading to Sharma's arrest in [[Malaysia]], where he is on a holiday. A few months later, Michael, no longer a rowdy, takes up football coaching for children, with one of his wards being the son of Daniel, who has made peace with Michael.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] in dual roles as Michael (Bigil), and as his father, Rayappan\n* [[Nayanthara]] as Angel Aasirvatham, Michael's love interest\n* [[Jackie Shroff]] as J.

He has a romantic relationship with Angel Aasirvatham, a [[physiotherapy|physiotherapist]] who comically refuses to marry any groom at the last minute due to their love during her wedding. He has a running feud with a rival don named Daniel. One night, Daniel attacks Michael and his close friend Kathir, who is the coach of the [[Tamil Nadu]] women's [[association football|football]] team. Kathir suffers spinal injuries during the attack, due to which he is paralyzed for a year. To allow the women's football team to take part in the upcoming National Championship in [[Delhi]], Kathir requests to the Tamil Nadu Football Federation to replace him with his former teammate named \"Bigil\", who is none other than Michael. The story then shifts to Michael's past as a football player.\n\nSeven years earlier, Michael was an aspiring footballer and contributed to victories for the Tamil Nadu football team along with Kathir. His father was Rayappan, a don who had a feud with a rival don named Alex, who was Daniel's father. Rayappan encouraged his son's passion for football as he did not want him to end up as a criminal like him. When Michael was unable to make it to the [[India national football team|Indian football team]] due to Rayappan's criminal record, Rayappan personally took up the matter with the [[All India Football Federation]] president J. K. Sharma and forcefully ensured Sharma to include Michael and Kathir in the Indian team probable list. However, despite Rayappan's efforts, Michael's football career was cut short as he witnessed Rayappan being killed by Alex and Daniel, just when he was about to leave for Delhi to attend the selection trial for the Indian football team. Michael then killed Alex in front of Daniel, thereby taking revenge for Rayappan's death, and stayed back in Chennai to become the new leader of his father's gang.\n\nIn the present day, Michael accepts Kathir's request to coach the women's football team and leaves for Delhi with the team, with Angel also accompanying them as team physiotherapist. However, due to his criminal background, the girls refuse to cooperate with him, even blaming him for the team's opening loss to [[Manipur]] in the National Championship and requesting the Federation to have him removed. Dejected, Michael gives his resignation to Sharma, but he soon realises that Sharma is targeting him in revenge for the humiliation that he had faced at the hands of Rayappan to allow him into the Indian football team. Sharma sends armed assailants to attack Michael; however, Michael subdues the assailants and withdraws his resignation. He convinces the girls to support him and starts training them hard with the sole focus of winning the Championship. He even manages to bring back two former key players to boost the team's strength: Gayathri, a [[Tamil Brahmin|Brahmin]] girl who had to quit playing football after she was married to a conservative family; and Anitha, who went into depression and refused to leave her room after a man [[acid attack|threw acid]] on her face as she spurned his advances. Despite Sharma trying to rig the team's next match against [[Haryana]] so that they will be eliminated and sent home, they manage to beat Haryana and win all their remaining matches, eventually qualifying for the Final at Chennai, where they are to play Manipur again.\n\nOn the eve of the Final, one of the team's players, Vembu, is kidnapped and forcefully injected with [[cocaine]] by Daniel, who is hired by Sharma in order to sabotage the team's chances of winning the Championship. Though she recovers, she is unable to play in the final as she would fail the dope test. The team's captain, Thendral, is also kidnapped by Daniel, who attempts to forcefully inject cocaine on her as well; however, Michael manages to rescue her. Michael proceeds to kill Daniel once and for all, but when he sees Daniel's young son, he changes his mind and spares Daniel, as he does not want the young boy's future to end up like him by seeing his father die. The next day, Tamil Nadu plays the Final against Manipur without Vembu. The match turns out to be a thriller with Tamil Nadu winning the Championship through a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]]. Michael and the team dedicate their success to Kathir, who is watching the match from the dugout in a wheelchair.\n\nDuring the [[Closing credits|credits]], Michael gets Sharma framed for drug possession, leading to Sharma's arrest in [[Malaysia]], where he is on a holiday. A few months later, Michael, no longer a rowdy, takes up football coaching for children, with one of his wards being the son of Daniel, who has made peace with Michael.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] in dual roles as Michael (Bigil), and as his father, Rayappan\n* [[Nayanthara]] as Angel Aasirvatham, Michael's love interest\n* [[Jackie Shroff]] as J.

According to Plutarch, as a hereditary client of the Caecilii Metelli, one of the noble families which was then emerging as the dominant faction in Rome,{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=82}} Marius ran for election as one of the twenty-four special [[military tribune]]s of the first four legions who were elected (the rest were appointed by the magistrate who raised the legion). [[Sallust]] tells us that he was unknown by sight to the electors but was returned by all the tribes on the basis of his accomplishments. After election, he likely served [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Balearicus]] on the Balearic Islands helping him win a triumph.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=85}}\n\nNext, he possibly ran for the [[quaestor]]ship after losing an election for local office in Arpinum. The military tribunate shows that he was already interested in Roman politics before the quaestorship. Perhaps he simply ran for local office as a means of gaining support back home, and lost to some other local worthy. It is possible, however, that Marius never ran for the quaestorship at all, jumping directly to plebeian tribune.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=60-61}} He likely, however, participated in the major Roman victory of 121 BC which permanently cemented Roman control over southern Gaul.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=86}}\n\n[[File:John Vanderlyn - Caius Marius Amid the Ruins of Carthage - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|''Marius Amid the Ruins of Carthage'' by [[John Vanderlyn]].]]\n \nIn 120 BC, Marius was returned as [[Tribune of the Plebs|plebeian tribune]] for the following year. He won with the support of the Metelli faction,{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=86}} specifically [[Lucius Caecilius Metellus Dalmaticus]].{{sfn|Evans|1995|p=44-45}} According to Plutarch, the Metelli were one of his family's hereditary patrons; while this connection may be a latter-day exaggeration,{{sfn|Evans|1995|p=45}} it was not uncommon for prospective consuls to campaign for their candidates for the tribunate and lower the possibility of opposition tribunes exercising their vetoes.{{sfn|Evans|1995|p=176}}\n\n<!-- Evans p 51, says Marius' tribunate was mostly uneventful with some exaggeration by later authors. -->According to Plutarch, against the wishes of his patrons, he pushed through a law that restricted the interference of the wealthy in elections.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=86}} In the 130s, voting by ballot had been introduced in elections for choosing magistrates, passing laws and deciding legal cases, replacing the earlier system of oral voting. The wealthy continued to try to influence the voting by inspecting ballots and Marius passed a law narrowing the passages down which voters passed to cast their votes in order to prevent outsiders from harassing the electors.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} It is not clear, however, whether Plutarch's narrative history properly reflects how controversial this proposal in fact was: Cicero, writing at least during the Republic, describes this {{lang|la|lex Maria}} as quite straightforward and uncontroversial.{{sfn|Evans|1995|p=47}} But while the election procedures were supported by the plebs in Rome, Marius shortly thereafter alienated them by vetoing a bill for the expansion of the ever-popular grain dole, citing high cost.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=87}}\n\nSoon thereafter, in 117 BC, Marius ran for the [[aedile]]ship{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=57}} and lost.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=87}} It seems clear that by this time, simply due to the enormous financial difficulties that any prospective aedile would have to shoulder, Marius had either amassed or was availed of significant financial resources.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=53-54}} This loss was at least in part due to the enmity of the Metelli.<ref name=\"Hazel\">{{cite book\n | last = Hazel\n | first = John\n | authorlink = John Hazel\n | title = Who's Who in the Roman World\n | year = 2002\n | publisher = Routledge\n | isbn = 0-415-29162-3\n | pages = [https://archive.org/details/whoswhoinromanwo00john/page/187 187]\n | quote = <nowiki>[As tribune of the plebs]</nowiki> he threatened METELLUS Delmaticus for his opposition, thus earning the hostility of that family, which cost him the aedileship.\n | url = https://archive.org/details/whoswhoinromanwo00john/page/187\n }}</ref> In 116 BC he barely won election as [[praetor]] for the following year, coming in last,{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=90}} and was promptly accused of {{lang|la|[[ambitus]]}} (electoral corruption).{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=91}} Being accused of electoral corruption was common during the middle and late Republic and details of the trial are sketchy or apocryphal.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=59}} Marius, however, was able to win acquittal on this charge,{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=59}} and spent an uneventful year as praetor in Rome,{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=91}} likely as either {{Lang|la|praetor peregrinus}} or as president of the corruption court.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=209}} In 114 BC, Marius' [[imperium]] was [[Prorogatio|prorogued]] and he was sent to govern the highly sought-after province of Further Spain ({{Lang-la|Hispania Ulterior}}),{{Sfn|Evans|2008|p=80}}{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=91}} where he engaged in some sort of minor military operation to clear brigands from untapped mining areas.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=91}} Due to his success in Spain, Marius almost certainly returned to Rome in 113 BC with his personal wealth greatly enlarged.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=91}}{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=69}}\n\nHe received no [[Roman triumph|triumph]] on his return, but he did marry [[Julia (aunt of Caesar and wife of Marius)|Julia]], the aunt of [[Julius Caesar]].{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=91}} The Julii Caesares were a patrician family, but at this period seem to have found it hard to advance above the praetorship. The Julii had done so only once in the 2nd century, in 157 BC. The match was advantageous to both sides: Marius gained respectability by marrying into one most ancient patrician families in the Republic and the Julii received a great injection of energy and money.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=92}} Sources are unclear on whether Marius joined the annual race of former praetors for the consulship, but it is likely that he failed to be elected at least once.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=71}}\n\n===Subordinate to Metellus===\nThe [[Jugurthine War]] started due to \"Roman exasperation with the ambitions of [[Jugurtha]]\",{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=74}} who had killed his half-brothers, massacred Italians in his civil war against them, and bribed many prominent Romans to support him in the Senate.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=89-90}} After the start of hostilities, the first army sent to Numidia was apparently bribed to withdraw and the second army was defeated and forced to march under the yoke.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=74-75}} These debacles eroded trust in the ability for the aristocracy to adequately manage foreign affairs.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=75}}\n\nWhile Marius had seemingly broken with the Caecilii Metelli during his time as tribune and praetor, the Metellii did not seem to hold this rupture against him so much as to pass over him for selection as legate in the opening phases of the [[Jugurthine War]].{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=104}} In 109 BC, likely to improve his chances for the consulship,{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=76}} Marius joined then-consul [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus|Quintus Caecilius Metellus]], in his campaign against [[Jugurtha]].{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=104}} Legates (''legati'') were originally simply envoys sent by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], but men appointed as legates by the Senate were used by generals as subordinate commanders, usually becoming the general's most trusted lieutenant. Hence, Metellus had to have asked the Senate to appoint Marius as legate to allow him to serve as Metellus' subordinate.\n\nIn [[Sallust]]'s long account of Metellus' campaign no other legates are mentioned, so it is assumed that Marius was Metellus's senior subordinate and right-hand man. Metellus was using Marius' strong military experience, while Marius was strengthening his position to run for the consulship.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of the Muthul]] Marius' actions probably saved the army of Metellus from annihilation. Jughurtha had cut the Romans off from the River Muthul where they wanted to refill their water reserves. The Romans had to fight Jugurtha in the desert where the Numidian light cavalry had an advantage. The Numidian cavalry scattered the Romans into small detachments and soon had control of the battle field. Each group of Romans was fighting for their survival. At this point Marius re-organized a few detachments, and led a column of 2,000 men through the Numidans and linked up with Metellus. Together they led their men against the Numidian infantry who occupied a hill. After gaining control of the hill Marius and Metellus led their men against the rear of the Numidian cavalry. The Romans gained the initiative and the Numidians had no choice but to withdraw.<ref>[[Sallust]], ''Bellum Jugurthinum'', 48-55.</ref>\n\n===Run for the consulship===\n[[File:Marius Chiaramonti Inv1488.jpg|thumb|So-called \"Marius\" [[Roman sculpture|bust]], marble, [[Roman art]]work of the 1st century BC, restored by Alexander Trippel, now in the [[Vatican Museums]]]]\nBy 108 BC, Marius expressed his desire to run for the [[Roman consul|consulship]].{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=108}} Metellus did not give Marius his blessing to return to Rome,{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=76}} allegedly advising Marius to wait and run with [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius|Metellus's son]] (who was only twenty, which would signify a campaign 20 years in the future), Marius began to campaign for the consulship.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=108-109}}  [[Sallust]] claims that this was catalyzed, in part, by a fortune-teller in Utica who \"told him that great and wonderful things were presaged to him that he might therefore pursue whatever designs he had formed trusting to the gods for success, and that he might try fortune as often as he pleased for that all his undertakings would prosper.\"<ref name=\"Sallust, Bellum Iugurthinum\">{{Cite book |last=Sallust |title=Sallust, Florus, and Velleus Paterculus |publisher=George Bell and Sons |others=Translated by John Selby Watson |quote=Per idem tempus Uticae forte C..

The commander of the garrison, one Titus Turpilius Silanus, a client of Metellus, escaped unharmed. Marius allegedly urged Metellus to sentence Silanus to death on charges of cowardice, but then apparently turned on Metellus, arguing that the sentence was disproportionate and overly harsh.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=110}} Also sending letters back to Rome claiming that Metellus had become enamoured with the unlimited powers associated with his ''imperium'',{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=110}} Metellus, wary of an increasingly disgruntled and resentful subordinate, permitted Marius to return to Rome. According to Plutarch, with barely enough time to make it back for the consular elections;{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=111}}{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=80}} but according to Sallust, enough time to effectively canvass for votes.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=82}}\n\nWith growing political pressure towards a quick and decisive victory over Jugurtha, Marius was elected consul for 107 BC,{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=112}} campaigning against Metellus's apparent lack of swift action against Jugurtha, with [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)|Lucius Cassius Longinus]] as his colleague.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=85}} Because of the repeated military debacles from 113 BC to 109 BC and the accusations that the ruling oligarchy was open to flagrant bribery, it became easier for the virtuous new man who had worked with difficulty up the ladder of offices to be elected as an alternative to the inept or corrupt nobility.\n\nThe Senate prorogued Metellus' command in Numidia,{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=90}} thereby preventing Marius from assuming command. Yet, Marius got around this by inducing an ally of his, then-tribune [[Titus Manlius Mancinus]], to have the Assembly override the Senate's decision and appoint him in command.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=110}} Metellus shed bitter tears when he learned of the decision; refusing to personally hand over command to Marius, Metellus was surprised at a positive welcome. Metellus' family arranged for thronging crowds to greet his ship and induced the Senate to vote Metellus a [[Roman triumph|triumph]] and the ''[[agnomen]]'' ''Numidicus''.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=117}}\n\n===War in Numidia===\n{{main|Jugurthine War}}\nSeeking troops to bolster the forces in Numidia and win his promised quick victory, Marius found that Rome's traditional manpower reserves depleted. As inequality increased, fewer men of military age met the property requirements to serve in the legions.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=113}} Yet, thousands of poor Italians sat idly in Rome, ineligible to serve. Seeking to use them, and with precedent for waiving the property requirements during the existential crisis that was the [[Second Punic War]], Marius was exempted from the requirements.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=114}} With more troops mustering in southern Italy, Marius sailed for Africa, leaving his cavalry in the hands of his newly elected quaestor, [[Sulla|Lucius Cornelius Sulla]].{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=114}}\n\nMarius found that ending the war was more difficult than he had claimed.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=117}} Jugurtha was fighting a guerrilla war, it appeared that no strategy would work better than Metellus' strategy of denying Jugurtha reinforcement and support.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=118}} He arrived comparatively late in 107 BC but still fought and won a battle near Cirta.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p.31.</ref> At the end of 107 he surprised Jugurtha by a dangerous desert march to Capsa in the far south where, after the town surrendered, he put all the survivors to the sword.<ref>Mommsen, p.108; Lynda Telford, ''Sulla, A Dictator Reconsidered'', p.31.</ref> Keeping up the pressure he drove Jugurtha's forces southwards and westwards into [[Mauretania]]. Marius was supposedly unhappy at receiving the dissolute and libertine [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] as his [[quaestor]], but he proved a highly competent officer, well liked by the men.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=118}} Meanwhile, Jugurtha was trying to get his father-in-law king [[Bocchus I|Bocchus]] of Mauretania to join him in the war against the Romans. In 106 Marius marched his army far to the west, capturing a fortress by the river [[Molochath]]. Unfortunately, this advance had brought him near the dominions of Bocchus finally provoking the Mauretanian into action; in the deserts just west of Serif, Marius was taken by surprise by a combined army of Numidians and Mauretanians under the command of the two enemy kings.<ref name=\"LTS32\">Lynda Telford, ''Sulla A Dictator Reconsidered'', p.32.</ref> For once, Marius was unprepared for action and in the melee all he could do was form defensive circles.<ref name=LTS32/> The attack was pressed by [[Gaetulian]] and Mauretanian horsemen and for a time Marius and his main force found themselves besieged on a hill, while Sulla and his men were on the defensive on another hill nearby.<ref name=LTS32/> However, the Romans managed to hold off the enemy until evening and the Africans retired. The next morning at dawn the Romans surprised the Africans' insufficiently guarded camp and completely routed the Numidian-Mauretanian army.<ref name=LTS32/> Marius then marched east to winter quarters in Cirta. The African kings harried the retreat with light cavalry, but were beaten back by Sulla whom Marius had put in command of the cavalry.<ref>Mommsen, p. 109; Lynda Telford, ''Sulla, A Dictator Reconsidered'', p.33.</ref>{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=119}} It was by now evident that Rome would not defeat Jugurtha's guerrilla tactics through military means. Therefore, Marius resumed negotiations with Bocchus, who, though he had joined in the fighting, had not yet declared war.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=122}} Ultimately, Marius reached a deal with Bocchus whereby Sulla, who was friendly with members of Bocchus' court, would enter Bocchus' camp to receive Jugurtha as a hostage. In spite of the possibility of treachery on the Mauritanian's part, Sulla agreed; Jugurtha's remaining followers were treacherously massacred, and he himself handed over in chains to Sulla by Bocchus.<ref>Mommsen, p. 110</ref>{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=124}} In the aftermath, Bocchus annexed the western part of Jugurtha's kingdom, and was made a ''friend and ally of the Roman people''. Jugurtha was thrown into an underground prison (the [[Tullianum]]) in Rome, and ultimately died after gracing Marius' triumph in 104 BC.<ref>Mommsen, pp. 110, 111</ref>\n\nSince Marius held the imperium and Sulla was acting as his subordinate, the honour of capturing Jugurtha belonged strictly to Marius. But Sulla had clearly been immediately responsible and had a signet ring made for himself commemorating the event.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=128}} Sulla and his aristocratic allies encouraged this narrative to discredit Marius. This was to be one of the main causes of the eventual rivalry between Marius and Sulla that would end in civil war.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=128}}{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=128}}\n\n===Cimbri and Teutones===\n{{Main|Cimbrian War}}\n[[File:Marius and the Ambassadors of the Cimbri.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Marius and the ambassadors of the Cimbri]]The arrival of the [[Cimbri]] in [[Gaul]] in 109 BC and their complete defeat of [[Marcus Junius Silanus (consul 109 BC)|Marcus Junius Silanus]] had crippled Roman prestige, resulted in unrest among the [[Celt]]ic tribes recently conquered by the Romans in southern Gaul.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=119}} In 107 the consul [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)|Lucius Cassius Longinus]] was completely defeated by the [[Tigurini]], and the senior surviving officer (one [[Gaius Popillius Laenas (general)|Gaius Popillius]], son of the consul of 132) had saved what was left only by surrendering half the baggage and suffering the humiliation of having his army \"march under the yoke\".{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=119-120}} The next year, 106 BC, another consul, [[Quintus Servilius Caepio]], marched to Gaul with another new army to salvage the situation.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=120}} There, he captured the town community of ''Tolosa'' (modern day [[Toulouse]]), where he discovered a great treasure cache called the [[Gold of Tolosa]], believed to be stolen from the Greek temple of Delphi.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=121}} It was stolen when being transported to ''Massilia'' (modern day [[Marseille]]), with Caepio suspected of having organised the theft.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=121}} While Caepio was [[Wiktionary:prorogue|prorogued]] into the next year, the new consul for 105 BC [[Gnaeus Mallius Maximus]],{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=126}} was also assigned to southern Gaul with another army. Caepio's disdain for Mallius, a [[Novus homo|new man]] like Marius, and hunger for glory made it impossible for them to cooperate.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=126}}\n\nThe Cimbri and the [[Teutones]] (both migrating Germanic tribes) appeared on the [[Rh\u00f4ne]], and while Caepio was on the west bank he refused to come to the aid of Mallius on the left.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=126}} The Senate was unable to induce Caepio in cooperate with Mallius, which proved both generals' undoing. The Cimbri, at the [[Battle of Arausio]], overwhelmed and overran Caepio's legions with massively overwhelming numbers. Caepio's routed men crashed into Mallius' troops, which led to both armies being pinned against the River [[Rh\u00f4ne]] and annihilated by the numerically dominant Cimbrian warriors.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=126}}\n\nThe losses in the preceding decade had been bad enough, but this defeat, apparently caused by the arrogance of the nobility and its refusal to co-operate with talented non-nobles, thoroughly discredited the aristocracy's management of foreign threats. Not only had huge numbers of Romans lost their lives but Italy itself was now exposed to invasion from barbarian hordes.\n\nThe Republic, altogether lacking many generals who had recently in fact concluded successfully any recent military campaigns,{{Sfn|Evans|2017|p=96}} took the illegal step of electing Marius ''in absentia'' for a second consulship in three years.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=127}} While his election was not unprecedented, as [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus|Quintus Fabius Maximus]] had been elected for consecutive consulships{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=136}} and it was not unheard of for consuls to be elected ''in absentia'', it certainly was not with recent precedent.{{Sfn|Evans|2017|p=96}} Yet, since the Assembly had the ability to overturn any law, it simply set aside the requirements and made Marius consul.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=96}}\n\n====As consul====\nMarius was still in Africa when the Assembly elected him consul for 104 BC.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=127}} At the start of his consulship, Marius returned from Africa in spectacular [[Roman triumph|triumph]], bringing Jugurtha and the riches of North Africa to awe the citizenry.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=127}} Jugurtha, who had prophesied the purchase and destruction of Rome, met his end in the Roman prison after having been led through the streets of the city in chains.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=127-128}} Marius was assigned \u2013 it is unclear whether by the Assembly or sortition \u2013 the province of Gaul to deal with the Cimbric threat.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=99}}\n\nThe Cimbri, after their decisive victory at Arausio, marched west into Hispania.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=100}} Marius was tasked with rebuilding, effectively from scratch, the Gallic legions.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=130}} Basing his army around a core of trained legionaries from the last year, Marius again secured exemption from the property requirements and with his newly-minted reputation for glorious and profitable victory, raised an army of some thirty thousand Romans and forty thousand Italian allies and auxiliaries.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=131}} He established a base around the town of [[Aquae Sextiae]] and trained his men.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=131}}\n\nOne of his legates was his old quaestor, Sulla, which shows that at this time there was no ill-will between them. In 104 BC, Marius was returned as consul again for 103 BC. Though he could have continued to operate as [[proconsul]], it is likely that the people reelected him as consul so to avoid another incident of disputed command \u00e0 la Caepio and Mallius.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=100-101}} Marius seems to have been able to get exactly what he wanted, and it even seems that his support determined whom the people would elect as his colleagues (his choice was apparently determined, on several occasions, on the basis of their malleability: only Catulus in 102 BC, and Flaccus in 100 BC, would have been serious candidates in their own right without his support, and even Flaccus was described as more servant than partner in the office).{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nIn 103 BC, the Germans still did not emerge from Hispania, and Marius's colleague died, requiring Marius to return to Rome to call elections.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=101}} Lacking a decisive conclusion to the Cimbrian conflict over the last two years, it was not a foregone conclusion that Marius would win reelection.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=104}} To that end, he secured a political alliance with a firebrand populist tribune, [[Lucius Appuleius Saturninus]], who with considerable oratorical skill, helped Marius achieve reelection to the consulship for 102 BC.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=104}}\n\nOver his successive consulships, Marius was not idle. He trained his troops, built his intelligence network, and conducted diplomacy with the Gallic tribes on the provincial frontiers. And beyond building allies in anticipation for the return of the Cimbri, he executed significant and wide-ranging reforms to the legions.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=135}}\n\nOver this time, while the Republic raised men and prepared for the Cimbric threat, a [[Second Servile War|slave revolt]] engulfed Sicily. The revolt was tangentially related to the Republic's attempts to raise more troops by appeasing the Italians by emancipating Italians who had been enslaved for failure to pay tax. In 104 BC, a praetor by the name of [[Publius Licinius Nerva]] was instructed to establish a tribunal to identify and emancipate enslaved Italians.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=132}} The premature closure of the tribunal due to local pressure caused unrest and ignited an uprising that would consume the island until 100 BC.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=133}}\n\n==== Reforms to the military ====\n{{Main|Marian reforms}}\nIn the years preceding Marius, there was an increasing popular movement for the redistribution of land from the wealthy aristocracy to the urban poor. The [[Gracchi]]an [[agrarian reform]]s had been premised on the traditional Roman [[Feudal levies|levy]], which excluded from service those whose property qualification fell below the minimum property qualification for the fifth census class. One of the major arguments for these land reforms was to rebuild the manpower pool from which the legions recruited.\n\nWhile the [[Gracchi]] had tried to restore the smallholders who would constitute the majority of those qualified to serve, their land legislation did little to alleviate the growing manpower shortage that gave rise to that legislation. It seems that the minimum qualification for the fifth census class (the lowest one eligible for military service) was lowered from 11,000 to 3000 [[sestertius|sesterces]] of property, and already in 109 BC the consuls had had to seek suspension of [[Gaius Gracchus]]' restrictions on the levy.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} In 107 BC, Marius was granted authorisation to ignore property qualifications altogether for the war against Jugurtha.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=114}} And again, with the threat of the Cimbri, he was granted another exemption.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=131}}\n\nAfter the repeated disasters of the Cimbrian war, this need for men became ever more acute. Temporary lifting of property requirements became a permanent necessity to combat Rome's adversaries. Marius and his contemporaries' need for soldiers cemented a paradigmatic shift away from the levy-based armies of the middle Republic towards open recruitment. Thereafter, Rome's legions would largely consist of poor citizens (the \"[[capite censi]]\" or \"head count\") whose future after service could only be assured if their general could bring about land distribution and pay on their behalf. In the broad sweep of history, this reliance on poor men would make soldiers strongly loyal not to the Senate and people of Rome, but to their generals whom would be perceived as friends, comrades, benefactors, and patrons of soldiers.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=114}}\n\nMarius, however, in his successive consulships, also overhauled the training and logistical organisation of his men. Instead of baggage trains, Marius had his troops carry all their weapons, blankets, clothes, and rations.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=135}} This led to Roman soldiers of the time being referred to as Marius' mules. He also improved the ''pilum'', a javelin which (after improvement) when thrown and impacting the enemy, would bend so to be unusable.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=136}} While Marius is credited for many of the reforms in his period, there is no evidence to support the claim that it was Marius who changed the tactical unit of the army from the ''maniple'' to the ''cohort''.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=136}}\n\n==== Battle with the Germanic tribes ====\n{{Main|Battle of Aquae Sextiae|Battle of Vercellae}}The People's Assembly was nervous enough about the Cimbric threat and disunity in command to reelect Marius to three successive consulships (in 104, in 103 and in 102 BC).[[File:Gaius_Fundanius,_denarius,_101_BC,_RRC_326-1.jpg|thumb|250x250px|[[Denarius]] of the [[quaestor]] Gaius Fundanius, 101 BC.

Marius was awarded this triumph for his victory over the Teutones.<ref>Crawford, ''Roman Republican Coinage'', p. 328.</ref>]]\nIn 102 BC, the Cimbri returned from Hispania and, with a number of other barbarian tribes, invaded Italy. The Teutones and their allies the Ambrones were to head south and advance toward Italy along the Mediterranean coast;{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=140}} the Cimbri were to attempt to cross the Alps into Italy from the north by the [[Brenner Pass]]; and the [[Tigurini]] (the allied Celtic tribe who had defeated Longinus in 107) were to cross the Alps from the northeast.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=141}} This decision proved fatally flawed. The Germanic warriors divided their forces, making each contingent manageable, and the Romans could use their shorter lines of communication and supply to concentrate their forces at will.\n\nFirst, Marius had to deal with the Teutones and their allies the [[Ambrones]], who were in the province of [[Gallia Narbonensis|Narbonensis]] marching toward the Alps. He frustrated them by refusing to give battle, and withdrew to a ridge across the river near [[Aquae Sextiae]], which blocked their path.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=141}}<ref name=\"LTS62\">Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 62.</ref> The leading contingent of the Germanic warriors, the Ambrones, [[Battle of Aquae Sextiae|attacked]] the Roman position without waiting for reinforcements, they had to charge uphill while the Romans fought downhill, the Romans had the advantage and 30,000 Ambrones' warriors were killed.<ref name=LTS62/> While waiting for the Teutones to arrive, Marius sent one of his [[Roman legate|legates]], Claudius Marcellus, with 3,000 troops away from the battlefield and ordered him to remain undetected until a determined time when he would appear at the enemy rear.<ref>Marc Hyden, ''Gaius Marius'', pp 136-137.</ref> The next day when the main Germanic contingent finally attacked, the hidden Roman troops would fall on them from the rear. In the ensuing [[Battle of Aquae Sextiae]], the Teutones were completely annihilated, suffering somewhere between 100 thousand and 200 thousand dead.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=141}}\n\nMarius' consular colleague in 102 BC, [[Quintus Lutatius Catulus|Quintus Lutatius Catulus Caesar]], did not fare so well.

Rallying volunteers from the urban plebs and his veterans, Marius cut the water supply to the Capitoline hill and put Saturinus' barricades under a short and decisive siege.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=157}} After Saturninus and Glaucia surrendered, Marius attempted to keep Saturninus and his followers alive by locking them safely inside the [[Curia Hostilia|Senate house]], where they would await prosecution according to the law.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=157}} Possibly with Marius' implied consent, an angry mob broke into the building and, by dislodging the roof tiles and throwing them at the prisoners below, lynched those inside.<ref>Appian, ''BC'' 1.32</ref>{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=157-158}} Glaucia too was dragged from his house and killed in the street.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=158}}\n\nIn complying with the Senate's wishes, Marius tried to show the Senate, who had always been suspicious of his motives, that he was one of them instead of the outsider that Quintus Metellus said he was in 108 BC. Marius's overall concern, for his part, was always how to maintain the Senate's esteem: in the words of the scholar [[A.N. Sherwin-White]], Marius 'wanted to end his days as ''vir censorius'', like the other great worthies among the ''novi homines'' of the second century'.<ref>A.N. Sherwin-White, 'Violence in Roman Politics', ''JRS'' 46 (1956), p. 5</ref>\n\n=== 90s BC ===\nAfter the events of 100 BC, Marius at first tried to oppose the recall of Metellus Numidicus, who had been exiled by Saturninus in 103. However, seeing that opposition was impossible, Marius decided to travel to the east in 98 BC, ostensibly to fulfil a vow he had made to the goddess ''Bona Dea''.<ref name=\"Plutarch, Marius 31.1\">Plutarch, ''Marius'' 31.1</ref>\n\nPlutarch portrays this voluntary exile as a great humiliation for the six-time consul: 'considered obnoxious to the nobles and to the people alike', he was even forced to abandon his candidature for the censorship of 97.<ref>Plutarch, ''Marius'' 30</ref> Plutarch also reports that while in the East, Marius attempted to goad [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]] into declaring war on Rome, so that the Roman people might be forced to rely on Marius's military leadership once more.<ref name=\"Plutarch, Marius 31.1\" />\n\nHowever, scholars have pointed out that Marius's supposed 'humiliation' cannot have been too long-lasting. In c. 98\u201397 BC, he was given the unprecedented honour of being elected ''in absentia'' to the college of priestly [[augur]]s whilst away in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]].<ref>Cicero, ''Ad Brutum'' I.5.3</ref> Furthermore, Marius's mere presence at the trial of [[Manius Aquillius (consul 101 BC)|Manius Aquillius]] in 98 BC, his friend and former colleague as consul in 101 BC, was enough to secure acquittal for the accused, even though he was apparently guilty.<ref>Cicero, ''de oratore'' 2.194-6</ref><ref>Cicero, ''Pro Flacco'' 98</ref> In 95 BC, Marius also successfully acted as sole defence for T.

And in 90 BC, the Assembly carried a law, the {{Lang|la|[[lex Julia]] de civitate latinis et sociis danda}} to grant citizenship to Italians not yet under arms. In early 89 BC, with the expansion of the war slowing, the Senate dispatched [[Lucius Porcius Cato]] to take over the troops under Marius' command. Shortly after arriving, he forced Marius to resign his legateship by claiming he was in poor health.{{sfn|Duncan|2017|p=179}}\n\nMarius' experience in the conflict brought him few honours, though he served at a senior level and won at least a few victories.

Marius narrowly escaped capture and death on several occasions and eventually found safety with his veterans in Africa.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=199}} Sulla and his supporters in the Senate proscribed twelve men, including a death sentence passed on Marius, Sulpicius and a few other allies.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=197-198}} A few men \u2013 including Sulpicius \u2013 were executed but, according to Plutarch, many Romans disapproved of Sulla's actions.\n\nSome who opposed Sulla were  elected to office in 87 BC \u2013 [[Gnaeus Octavius (consul 87 BC)|Gnaeus Octavius]], a supporter of Sulla, and [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna]], a supporter of Marius and member of Sulla's extended family,{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=203}} were elected consuls \u2013 as Sulla wanted to demonstrate his republican ''bona fides''.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=203}} Regardless, Sulla was again confirmed as the commander of the [[First Mithridatic War|campaign against Mithridates]], so he took his legions out of Rome and marched east to the war.\n\n===Seventh consulship and death===\nWhile Sulla was on campaign in Greece, fighting broke out between the conservative supporters of Sulla, led by Octavius, and the popular supporters of Cinna over voting rights for the Italians.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=206}} When Cinna was forced to flee the city by Octavius' gangs, he was able to rally significant Italian support: some 10 legions including the Samnites.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=206-207}}\n\nMarius along with his son then returned from exile in Africa to Etruria with an army he had raised there and placed themselves under consul Cinna's command to oust Octavius.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=210}} Cinna's vastly superior army coerced the Senate into opening the gates of the city.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=211}}\n\nWhile Cinna had sworn an oath not to kill anyone, Marius and his soldiers had not.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=211}} They entered Rome and started murdering the leading supporters of Sulla, including Octavius.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=211}} Their heads were exhibited in the Forum. We know of fourteen victims important enough to be named, including six former consuls.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=213}} Lucius Licinius Crassus (older brother of [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|the triumvir]]), [[Gaius Atilius Serranus]], [[Marcus Antonius Orator]], [[Lucius Julius Caesar (consul 90 BC)|Lucius Julius Caesar]], his brother Caesar Strabo, Quintus Mucius Scaevola the Augur, Publius Cornelius Lentulus, Gaius Nemotorius, Gaius Baebius and Octavius Ruso.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=212}} For five days, the Marian faction purged the city of its enemies before putting an end to the terror.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 114.</ref> Following the short purge, Cinna organised elections, where he permitted two people to run for consul: himself and Marius.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=215}} Naturally, they were elected as consuls for 86 BC.\n\nPlutarch relates several opinions on the end of Marius: one, from [[Posidonius]], holds that Marius contracted [[pleurisy]]; Gaius Piso has it that Marius walked with his friends and discussed all of his accomplishments with them, adding that no intelligent man ought leave himself to fortune.<ref>Plutarch, Life of Marius, 45.</ref> Plutarch then anonymously relates that Marius, having gone into a fit of passion in which he announced in a delusionary manner that he was in command of the [[First Mithridatic War|Mithridatic War]], began to act as he would have on the field of battle; finally, Plutarch relates, that ever an ambitious man, Marius lamented, on his death bed, that he had not achieved all of which he was capable, despite his having acquired great wealth and having been chosen consul more times than any man before him.\n\nMarius died on 13 January 86 BC, just seventeen days into his seventh consulship.<ref>Plutarch, Life of Marius, 45 & 46.</ref> [[Lucius Valerius Flaccus]] succeeded Marius as consul.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 115.</ref> Cinna would lead the Marian faction into the civil war, which continued until Sulla won control of the state and made himself dictator with an undefined term.\n\n==Legacy==\nMarius was a highly successful Roman general and military reformer. In ancient sources, he is repeatedly characterised as having unending ambition and opportunism.{{Efn|This is especially the case of Marius' characterisation in the narratives of both Sallust and Plutarch.|name=|group=}} Plutarch says of him:\n\n{{bquote|if Marius could have been persuaded to sacrifice to the Greek Muses and Graces, he would not have put the ugliest possible crown upon a most illustrious career in field and forum, nor have been driven by the blasts of passion, ill-timed ambition, and insatiable greed upon the shore of a most cruel and savage old age.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Marius*.html |title=Plutarch, Life of Marius}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}This characterisation is not viewed by modern historians as entirely fair,{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=169}} for Marius' attempts to win the consulship and for self-aggrandisement were not out of the norm of politicians of the middle to late Republic.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=114}} Marius' legacy is heavily defined by his example: his five successive consulships, while seen contemporaneously as necessary for the survival of Roman civilisation, gave unprecedented power into the hands of a single man over a never-before-seen length of time.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=211}}\n\n=== Reforms to the legions ===\nThe Marian reforms to the logistics and organisation of the Roman armies were profound, increasing the speed and agility of the military to react to foreign threats.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=135}}\n\nIn the ancient narratives, his reforms to the recruitment process for the Roman legions are roundly criticised for creating a soldiery wholly loyal to their generals and beholden to their beneficence of ability to secure payment from the state.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=91}} However, this development did not emerge from Marius. And it was likely initially envisioned as nothing more than a temporary measure to meet the extraordinary threats of Numidia and the Cimbrian tribes.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=211}}\n\nFirst, \"the property qualification for army service had become nearly meaningless by 107\" with exemptions from the property qualifications becoming commonplace and recurrent.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=91}} Marius' recruitment reforms simply made plain what had been for some time commonplace,{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=91}} out of need for men or simply the expediency of calling up urban volunteers rather than conscripting farmers.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=92}}\n\nSecond, the decision to call up the {{Lang|la|proletarii}} would not be fully felt until the time to draw down the troops. As the spoils of war became increasingly inadequate as compensation for the soldiers \u2013 the spoils of war do not guarantee a long term stream of income \u2013 it became common practice to allocate land for the foundation of veteran colonies (generally abroad).{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=212}} Passage of the legislation necessary to establish these colonies became an \"increasingly irksome chore [dogging] the footsteps of senior politicians on their return ... from service overseas\".{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=212}}\n\n=== The Assemblies and foreign affairs ===\nMarius' repeated use of the Assemblies to overturn the Senatorial commands had significant negative effects on the stability of the state.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=93}} The Senate generally used [[sortition]] to choose generals for command posts, removing the conflict of interest between consuls.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=93}} In the late 120s BC, [[Gaius Gracchus]] passed a {{Lang|la|lex Sempronia de provinciis consularibus}} which required that commands be assigned before the election of consuls. Evans writes of this ''lex Sempronia'':\n{{Quote|text=The legislation is generally seen as popular legislation for foiling senatorial contrivance of commands, and for reducing the political intrigue which often accompanied the selection of generals. It was also a sound administrative device which cracked down on the ambitions of senators who sought the leadership of special military ventures.{{sfn|Evans|1995|p=94}}|sign=|source=}}\nMarius' use of the Assemblies to remove Metellus from command in Numidia spelled an end for collective governance in foreign affairs.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=91}} In later years, use of {{Lang|la|plebiscita}} became the main means by which commands were granted (or stolen) from other generals, adding to personal rivalries and diminishing the ability to govern the state.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=210}} The size of the rewards gained from manipulating the Assemblies was irresistible to future generations of ambitious politicians.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=211}}\n\nThe similar use of the Assemblies in an attempt to replace Sulla with Marius for the [[First Mithridatic War|Mithridatic War]] was unprecedented, as never before had laws been passed to confer commands on someone lacking any official title in the state.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=163}} Sulla's reaction of marching on the city proved disastrous for the Republic, leading to the normalisation of military interference in political affairs.\n\n=== Political violence ===\nWhile political violence had been increasingly normalised throughout the middle and late Republic, starting with the murder of the [[Gracchi|Gracchi brothers]], the passage of the {{Lang|la|[[senatus consultum ultimum]]}} against Saturninus and Glaucia in Marius' sixth consulship normalised the use of force not only against private citizens, but also \"against properly elected magistrates in order to preserve [the Senate's] own position\".{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=212}}\n\nMoreover, Marius' attempts to undermine Sulla's command at the start of the [[First Mithridatic War]] massively expanded the scope of that violence. No longer would only mobs clash in the streets of Rome. No longer would personal grudges solely be pursued in the courts:{{Efn|Examples of this are the extortion and treason courts set up by Saturninus and Gaius Mamilius' [[Mamilian commission]]}} political enemies would be executed en masse.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=169}}{{Efn|See both Sulla and Marius' purges of the city after they captured it under arms.|name=|group=}} At a broad level, the use of the Assemblies totally eroded senatorial control and created significant and prolonged instability,{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=167}} only resolved by the destruction of the Republican form of government and the transition to [[Roman Empire|Empire]].\n\n==Timeline==\n<timeline>\nImageSize  = width:1000 height:1000\nPlotArea   = left:40 right:0 top:10 bottom:10\nDateFormat = yyyy\nTimeAxis   = orientation:vertical format:yyyy order:reverse\nPeriod     = from:-160 till:-85\nAlignBars  = early\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:5 start:-160\nScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:-160\n\nColors =\n  id:gray value:gray(0.7)\n  id:lightsteelblue value:rgb(0.418, 0.609, 0.800)\n\nDefine $dx = 20 # shift text to right side of bar\n\nPlotData =\n  bar:event width:20 color:gray shift:($dx,-4)\n\n  from:start till:end color:lightsteelblue\n\n  mark:(line, white)\n  at:-157 fontsize:M text: BC 157 \u2013 Born in Arpinum\n  at:-134 fontsize:M text: BC 134 \u2013 Military tribune\n  at:-120 fontsize:M text: BC 120 \u2013 Plebeian tribune\n  at:-116 fontsize:M text: BC 116 \u2013 Praetor\n  at:-114 fontsize:M text: BC 114 \u2013 Sent to govern Lusitania\n  at:-110 fontsize:M text: BC 110 \u2013 Marriage to Julia\n  at:-109 fontsize:M text: BC 109 \u2013 Returned to army service as legate to Caecilius Metellus\n  at:-107 fontsize:M text: BC 107 \u2013 First consulship, abolished land ownership qualification for military service (Marian Reforms)\n  at:-101 fontsize:M text: BC 101 \u2013 Led successful Roman defense during the Germanic Invasions\n  from:-104 till:-100 fontsize:M text: Elected as consul for five consecutive years.\n  from:-91 till:-88 fontsize:M text: Returns to lead Roman army in the Social War\n  at:-87 fontsize:M text: BC 87 \u2013 Demands command against Mithradates in bargain with Sulpicius, Sulla assaults Rome and reclaims command, Marius exiled to Africa, returns from exile with an army and assaults Rome\n  at:-86 fontsize:M text: BC 86 \u2013 Seventh consulship alongside Cinna; died early January\n\n</timeline>\n\n==Consulships==\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Servius Sulpicius Galba (consul 108 BC)|Ser.

According to Plutarch, as a hereditary client of the Caecilii Metelli, one of the noble families which was then emerging as the dominant faction in Rome,{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=82}} Marius ran for election as one of the twenty-four special [[military tribune]]s of the first four legions who were elected (the rest were appointed by the magistrate who raised the legion). [[Sallust]] tells us that he was unknown by sight to the electors but was returned by all the tribes on the basis of his accomplishments. After election, he likely served [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Balearicus]] on the Balearic Islands helping him win a triumph.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=85}}\n\nNext, he possibly ran for the [[quaestor]]ship after losing an election for local office in Arpinum. The military tribunate shows that he was already interested in Roman politics before the quaestorship. Perhaps he simply ran for local office as a means of gaining support back home, and lost to some other local worthy. It is possible, however, that Marius never ran for the quaestorship at all, jumping directly to plebeian tribune.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=60-61}} He likely, however, participated in the major Roman victory of 121 BC which permanently cemented Roman control over southern Gaul.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=86}}\n\n[[File:John Vanderlyn - Caius Marius Amid the Ruins of Carthage - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|''Marius Amid the Ruins of Carthage'' by [[John Vanderlyn]].]]\n \nIn 120 BC, Marius was returned as [[Tribune of the Plebs|plebeian tribune]] for the following year.

The wealthy continued to try to influence the voting by inspecting ballots and Marius passed a law narrowing the passages down which voters passed to cast their votes in order to prevent outsiders from harassing the electors.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} It is not clear, however, whether Plutarch's narrative history properly reflects how controversial this proposal in fact was: Cicero, writing at least during the Republic, describes this {{lang|la|lex Maria}} as quite straightforward and uncontroversial.{{sfn|Evans|1995|p=47}} But while the election procedures were supported by the plebs in Rome, Marius shortly thereafter alienated them by vetoing a bill for the expansion of the ever-popular grain dole, citing high cost.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=87}}\n\nSoon thereafter, Marius ran for the [[aedile]]ship in 117 BC{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=57}} and lost.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=87}} It seems clear that by this time, simply due to the enormous financial difficulties that any prospective aedile would have to shoulder, Marius had either amassed or was availed of significant financial resources.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=53-54}} This loss was at least in part due to the enmity of the Metelli.<ref name=\"Hazel\">{{cite book\n | last = Hazel\n | first = John\n | authorlink = John Hazel\n | title = Who's Who in the Roman World\n | year = 2002\n | publisher = Routledge\n | isbn = 0-415-29162-3\n | pages = [https://archive.org/details/whoswhoinromanwo00john/page/187 187]\n | quote = <nowiki>[As tribune of the plebs]</nowiki> he threatened METELLUS Delmaticus for his opposition, thus earning the hostility of that family, which cost him the aedileship.\n | url = https://archive.org/details/whoswhoinromanwo00john/page/187\n }}</ref> In 116 BC he barely won election as [[praetor]] for the following year, coming in last,{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=90}} and was promptly accused of {{lang|la|[[ambitus]]}} (electoral corruption).{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=91}} Being accused of electoral corruption was common during the middle and late Republic and details of the trial are sketchy or apocryphal.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=59}} Marius, however, was able to win acquittal on this charge,{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=59}} and spent an uneventful year as praetor in Rome,{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=91}} likely as either {{Lang|la|praetor peregrinus}} or as president of the corruption court.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=209}} In 114 BC, Marius' [[imperium]] was [[Prorogatio|prorogued]] and he was sent to govern the highly sought-after province of Further Spain ({{Lang-la|Hispania Ulterior}}),{{Sfn|Evans|2008|p=80}}{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=91}} where he engaged in some sort of minor military operation to clear brigands from untapped mining areas.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=91}} Due to his success in Spain, Marius almost certainly returned to Rome in 113 BC with his personal wealth greatly enlarged.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=91}}{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=69}}\n\nHe received no [[Roman triumph|triumph]] on his return, but he did marry [[Julia (aunt of Caesar and wife of Marius)|Julia]], the aunt of [[Julius Caesar]].{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=91}} The Julii Caesares were a patrician family, but at this period seem to have found it hard to advance above the praetorship. The Julii had done so only once in the 2nd century, in 157 BC. The match was advantageous to both sides: Marius gained respectability by marrying into one most ancient patrician families in the Republic and the Julii received a great injection of energy and money.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=92}} Sources are unclear on whether Marius joined the annual race of former praetors for the consulship, but it is likely that he failed to be elected at least once.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=71}}\n\n===Subordinate to Metellus===\nThe [[Jugurthine War]] started due to \"Roman exasperation with the ambitions of [[Jugurtha]]\",{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=74}} who had killed his half-brothers, massacred Italians in his civil war against them, and bribed many prominent Romans to support him in the Senate.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=89-90}} After the start of hostilities, the first army sent to Numidia was apparently bribed to withdraw and the second army was defeated and forced to march under the yoke.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=74-75}} These debacles eroded trust in the ability for the aristocracy to adequately manage foreign affairs.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=75}}\n\nWhile Marius had seemingly broken with the Caecilii Metelli during his time as tribune and praetor, the Metellii did not seem to hold this rupture against him so much as to pass over him for selection as legate in the opening phases of the [[Jugurthine War]].{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=104}} In 109 BC, likely to improve his chances for the consulship,{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=76}} Marius joined then-consul [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus|Quintus Caecilius Metellus]], in his campaign against [[Jugurtha]].{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=104}} Legates (''legati'') were originally simply envoys sent by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]], but men appointed as legates by the Senate were used by generals as subordinate commanders, usually becoming the general's most trusted lieutenant. Hence, Metellus had to have asked the Senate to appoint Marius as legate to allow him to serve as Metellus' subordinate.\n\nIn [[Sallust]]'s long account of Metellus' campaign no other legates are mentioned, so it is assumed that Marius was Metellus's senior subordinate and right-hand man. Metellus was using Marius' strong military experience, while Marius was strengthening his position to run for the consulship.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of the Muthul]] Marius' actions probably saved the army of Metellus from annihilation. Jughurtha had cut the Romans off from the River Muthul where they wanted to refill their water reserves. The Romans had to fight Jugurtha in the desert where the Numidian light cavalry had an advantage. The Numidian cavalry scattered the Romans into small detachments and soon had control of the battle field. Each group of Romans was fighting for their survival. At this point Marius re-organized a few detachments, and led a column of 2,000 men through the Numidans and linked up with Metellus. Together they led their men against the Numidian infantry who occupied a hill. After gaining control of the hill Marius and Metellus led their men against the rear of the Numidian cavalry. The Romans gained the initiative and the Numidians had no choice but to withdraw.<ref>[[Sallust]], ''Bellum Jugurthinum'', 48-55.</ref>\n\n===Run for the consulship===\n[[File:Marius Chiaramonti Inv1488.jpg|thumb|So-called \"Marius\" [[Roman sculpture|bust]], marble, [[Roman art]]work of the 1st century BC, restored by Alexander Trippel, now in the [[Vatican Museums]]]]\nBy 108 BC, Marius expressed his desire to run for the [[Roman consul|consulship]].{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=108}} Metellus did not give Marius his blessing to return to Rome,{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=76}} allegedly advising Marius to wait and run with [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius|Metellus's son]] (who was only twenty, which would signify a campaign 20 years in the future), Marius began to campaign for the consulship.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=108-109}}  [[Sallust]] claims that this was catalyzed, in part, by a fortune-teller in Utica who \"told him that great and wonderful things were presaged to him that he might therefore pursue whatever designs he had formed trusting to the gods for success, and that he might try fortune as often as he pleased for that all his undertakings would prosper.\"<ref name=\"Sallust, Bellum Iugurthinum\">{{Cite book |last=Sallust |title=Sallust, Florus, and Velleus Paterculus |publisher=George Bell and Sons |others=Translated by John Selby Watson |quote=Per idem tempus Uticae forte C..

The commander of the garrison, one Titus Turpilius Silanus, a client of Metellus, escaped unharmed. Marius allegedly urged Metellus to sentence Silanus to death on charges of cowardice, but then apparently turned on Metellus, arguing that the sentence was disproportionate and overly harsh.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=110}} Also sending letters back to Rome claiming that Metellus had become enamoured with the unlimited powers associated with his ''imperium'',{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=110}} Metellus, wary of an increasingly disgruntled and resentful subordinate, permitted Marius to return to Rome. According to Plutarch, with barely enough time to make it back for the consular elections;{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=111}}{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=80}} but according to Sallust, enough time to effectively canvass for votes.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=82}}\n\nWith growing political pressure towards a quick and decisive victory over Jugurtha, Marius was elected consul for 107 BC,{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=112}} campaigning against Metellus's apparent lack of swift action against Jugurtha, with [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)|Lucius Cassius Longinus]] as his colleague.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=85}} Because of the repeated military debacles from 113 BC to 109 BC and the accusations that the ruling oligarchy was open to flagrant bribery, it became easier for the virtuous new man who had worked with difficulty up the ladder of offices to be elected as an alternative to the inept or corrupt nobility.\n\nThe Senate prorogued Metellus' command in Numidia,{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=90}} thereby preventing Marius from assuming command. Yet, Marius got around this by inducing an ally of his, then-tribune [[Titus Manlius Mancinus]], to have the Assembly override the Senate's decision and appoint him in command.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=110}} Metellus shed bitter tears when he learned of the decision; refusing to personally hand over command to Marius, Metellus was surprised at a positive welcome. Metellus' family arranged for thronging crowds to greet his ship and induced the Senate to vote Metellus a [[Roman triumph|triumph]] and the ''[[agnomen]]'' ''Numidicus''.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=117}}\n\n===War in Numidia===\n{{main|Jugurthine War}}\nSeeking troops to bolster the forces in Numidia and win his promised quick victory, Marius found that Rome's traditional manpower reserves depleted. As inequality increased, fewer men of military age met the property requirements to serve in the legions.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=113}} Yet, thousands of poor Italians sat idly in Rome, ineligible to serve. Seeking to use them, and with precedent for waiving the property requirements during the existential crisis that was the [[Second Punic War]], Marius was exempted from the requirements.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=114}} With more troops mustering in southern Italy, Marius sailed for Africa, leaving his cavalry in the hands of his newly elected quaestor, [[Sulla|Lucius Cornelius Sulla]].{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=114}}\n\nMarius found that ending the war was more difficult than he had claimed.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=117}} Jugurtha was fighting a guerrilla war, it appeared that no strategy would work better than Metellus' strategy of denying Jugurtha reinforcement and support.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=118}} He arrived comparatively late in 107 BC but still fought and won a battle near Cirta.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p.31.</ref> At the end of 107 he surprised Jugurtha by a dangerous desert march to Capsa in the far south where, after the town surrendered, he put all the survivors to the sword.<ref>Mommsen, p.108; Lynda Telford, ''Sulla, A Dictator Reconsidered'', p.31.</ref> Keeping up the pressure he drove Jugurtha's forces southwards and westwards into [[Mauretania]]. Marius was supposedly unhappy at receiving the dissolute and libertine [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] as his [[quaestor]], but he proved a highly competent officer, well liked by the men.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=118}} Meanwhile, Jugurtha was trying to get his father-in-law king [[Bocchus I|Bocchus]] of Mauretania to join him in the war against the Romans. In 106 Marius marched his army far to the west, capturing a fortress by the river [[Molochath]]. Unfortunately, this advance had brought him near the dominions of Bocchus finally provoking the Mauretanian into action; in the deserts just west of Serif, Marius was taken by surprise by a combined army of Numidians and Mauretanians under the command of the two enemy kings.<ref name=\"LTS32\">Lynda Telford, ''Sulla A Dictator Reconsidered'', p.32.</ref> For once, Marius was unprepared for action and in the melee all he could do was form defensive circles.<ref name=LTS32/> The attack was pressed by [[Gaetulian]] and Mauretanian horsemen and for a time Marius and his main force found themselves besieged on a hill, while Sulla and his men were on the defensive on another hill nearby.<ref name=LTS32/> However, the Romans managed to hold off the enemy until evening and the Africans retired. The next morning at dawn the Romans surprised the Africans' insufficiently guarded camp and completely routed the Numidian-Mauretanian army.<ref name=LTS32/> Marius then marched east to winter quarters in Cirta. The African kings harried the retreat with light cavalry, but were beaten back by Sulla whom Marius had put in command of the cavalry.<ref>Mommsen, p. 109; Lynda Telford, ''Sulla, A Dictator Reconsidered'', p.33.</ref>{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=119}} It was by now evident that Rome would not defeat Jugurtha's guerrilla tactics through military means. Therefore, Marius resumed negotiations with Bocchus, who, though he had joined in the fighting, had not yet declared war.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=122}} Ultimately, Marius reached a deal with Bocchus whereby Sulla, who was friendly with members of Bocchus' court, would enter Bocchus' camp to receive Jugurtha as a hostage. In spite of the possibility of treachery on the Mauritanian's part, Sulla agreed; Jugurtha's remaining followers were treacherously massacred, and he himself handed over in chains to Sulla by Bocchus.<ref>Mommsen, p. 110</ref>{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=124}} In the aftermath, Bocchus annexed the western part of Jugurtha's kingdom, and was made a ''friend and ally of the Roman people''. Jugurtha was thrown into an underground prison (the [[Tullianum]]) in Rome, and ultimately died after gracing Marius' triumph in 104 BC.<ref>Mommsen, pp. 110, 111</ref>\n\nSince Marius held the imperium and Sulla was acting as his subordinate, the honour of capturing Jugurtha belonged strictly to Marius. But Sulla had clearly been immediately responsible and had a signet ring made for himself commemorating the event.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=128}} Sulla and his aristocratic allies encouraged this narrative to discredit Marius. This was to be one of the main causes of the eventual rivalry between Marius and Sulla that would end in civil war.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=128}}{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=128}}\n\n===Cimbri and Teutones===\n{{Main|Cimbrian War}}\n[[File:Marius and the Ambassadors of the Cimbri.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Marius and the ambassadors of the Cimbri]]The arrival of the [[Cimbri]] in [[Gaul]] in 109 BC and their complete defeat of [[Marcus Junius Silanus (consul 109 BC)|Marcus Junius Silanus]] had crippled Roman prestige, resulted in unrest among the [[Celt]]ic tribes recently conquered by the Romans in southern Gaul.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=119}} In 107 the consul [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)|Lucius Cassius Longinus]] was completely defeated by the [[Tigurini]], and the senior surviving officer (one [[Gaius Popillius Laenas (general)|Gaius Popillius]], son of the consul of 132) had saved what was left only by surrendering half the baggage and suffering the humiliation of having his army \"march under the yoke\".{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=119-120}} The next year, 106 BC, another consul, [[Quintus Servilius Caepio]], marched to Gaul with another new army to salvage the situation.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=120}} There, he captured the town community of ''Tolosa'' (modern day [[Toulouse]]), where he discovered a great treasure cache called the [[Gold of Tolosa]], believed to be stolen from the Greek temple of Delphi.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=121}} It was stolen when being transported to ''Massilia'' (modern day [[Marseille]]), with Caepio suspected of having organised the theft.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=121}} While Caepio was [[Wiktionary:prorogue|prorogued]] into the next year, the new consul for 105 BC [[Gnaeus Mallius Maximus]],{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=126}} was also assigned to southern Gaul with another army. Caepio's disdain for Mallius, a [[Novus homo|new man]] like Marius, and hunger for glory made it impossible for them to cooperate.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=126}}\n\nThe Cimbri and the [[Teutones]] (both migrating Germanic tribes) appeared on the [[Rh\u00f4ne]], and while Caepio was on the west bank he refused to come to the aid of Mallius on the left.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=126}} The Senate was unable to induce Caepio in cooperate with Mallius, which proved both generals' undoing. The Cimbri, at the [[Battle of Arausio]], overwhelmed and overran Caepio's legions with massively overwhelming numbers. Caepio's routed men crashed into Mallius' troops, which led to both armies being pinned against the River [[Rh\u00f4ne]] and annihilated by the numerically dominant Cimbrian warriors.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=126}}\n\nThe losses in the preceding decade had been bad enough, but this defeat, apparently caused by the arrogance of the nobility and its refusal to co-operate with talented non-nobles, thoroughly discredited the aristocracy's management of foreign threats. Not only had huge numbers of Romans lost their lives but Italy itself was now exposed to invasion from barbarian hordes.\n\nThe Republic, altogether lacking many generals who had recently in fact concluded successfully any recent military campaigns,{{Sfn|Evans|2017|p=96}} took the illegal step of electing Marius ''in absentia'' for a second consulship in three years.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=127}} While his election was not unprecedented, as [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus|Quintus Fabius Maximus]] had been elected for consecutive consulships{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=136}} and it was not unheard of for consuls to be elected ''in absentia'', it certainly was not with recent precedent.{{Sfn|Evans|2017|p=96}} Yet, since the Assembly had the ability to overturn any law, it simply set aside the requirements and made Marius consul.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=96}}\n\n====As consul====\nMarius was still in Africa when the Assembly elected him consul for 104 BC.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=127}} At the start of his consulship, Marius returned from Africa in spectacular [[Roman triumph|triumph]], bringing Jugurtha and the riches of North Africa to awe the citizenry.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=127}} Jugurtha, who had prophesied the purchase and destruction of Rome, met his end in the Roman prison after having been led through the streets of the city in chains.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=127-128}} Marius was assigned \u2013 it is unclear whether by the Assembly or sortition \u2013 the province of Gaul to deal with the Cimbric threat.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=99}}\n\nThe Cimbri, after their decisive victory at Arausio, marched west into Hispania.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=100}} Marius was tasked with rebuilding, effectively from scratch, the Gallic legions.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=130}} Basing his army around a core of trained legionaries from the last year, Marius again secured exemption from the property requirements and with his newly-minted reputation for glorious and profitable victory, raised an army of some thirty thousand Romans and forty thousand Italian allies and auxiliaries.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=131}} He established a base around the town of [[Aquae Sextiae]] and trained his men.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=131}}\n\nOne of his legates was his old quaestor, Sulla, which shows that at this time there was no ill-will between them. In 104 BC, Marius was returned as consul again for 103 BC. Though he could have continued to operate as [[proconsul]], it is likely that the people reelected him as consul so to avoid another incident of disputed command \u00e0 la Caepio and Mallius.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=100-101}} Marius seems to have been able to get exactly what he wanted, and it even seems that his support determined whom the people would elect as his colleagues (his choice was apparently determined, on several occasions, on the basis of their malleability: only Catulus in 102 BC, and Flaccus in 100 BC, would have been serious candidates in their own right without his support, and even Flaccus was described as more servant than partner in the office).{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nIn 103 BC, the Germans still did not emerge from Hispania, and Marius's colleague died, requiring Marius to return to Rome to call elections.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=101}} Lacking a decisive conclusion to the Cimbrian conflict over the last two years, it was not a foregone conclusion that Marius would win reelection.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=104}} To that end, he secured a political alliance with a firebrand populist tribune, [[Lucius Appuleius Saturninus]], who with considerable oratorical skill, helped Marius achieve reelection to the consulship for 102 BC.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=104}}\n\nOver his successive consulships, Marius was not idle. He trained his troops, built his intelligence network, and conducted diplomacy with the Gallic tribes on the provincial frontiers. And beyond building allies in anticipation for the return of the Cimbri, he executed significant and wide-ranging reforms to the legions.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=135}}\n\nOver this time, while the Republic raised men and prepared for the Cimbric threat, a [[Second Servile War|slave revolt]] engulfed Sicily. The revolt was tangentially related to the Republic's attempts to raise more troops by appeasing the Italians by emancipating Italians who had been enslaved for failure to pay tax. In 104 BC, a praetor by the name of [[Publius Licinius Nerva]] was instructed to establish a tribunal to identify and emancipate enslaved Italians.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=132}} The premature closure of the tribunal due to local pressure caused unrest and ignited an uprising that would consume the island until 100 BC.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=133}}\n\n==== Reforms to the military ====\n{{Main|Marian reforms}}\nIn the years preceding Marius, there was an increasing popular movement for the redistribution of land from the wealthy aristocracy to the urban poor. The [[Gracchi]]an [[agrarian reform]]s had been premised on the traditional Roman [[Feudal levies|levy]], which excluded from service those whose property qualification fell below the minimum property qualification for the fifth census class. One of the major arguments for these land reforms was to rebuild the manpower pool from which the legions recruited.\n\nWhile the [[Gracchi]] had tried to restore the smallholders who would constitute the majority of those qualified to serve, their land legislation did little to alleviate the growing manpower shortage that gave rise to that legislation. It seems that the minimum qualification for the fifth census class (the lowest one eligible for military service) was lowered from 11,000 to 3000 [[sestertius|sesterces]] of property, and already in 109 BC the consuls had had to seek suspension of [[Gaius Gracchus]]' restrictions on the levy.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} In 107 BC, Marius was granted authorisation to ignore property qualifications altogether for the war against Jugurtha.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=114}} And again, with the threat of the Cimbri, he was granted another exemption.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=131}}\n\nAfter the repeated disasters of the Cimbrian war, this need for men became ever more acute. Temporary lifting of property requirements became a permanent necessity to combat Rome's adversaries. Marius and his contemporaries' need for soldiers cemented a paradigmatic shift away from the levy-based armies of the middle Republic towards open recruitment. Thereafter, Rome's legions would largely consist of poor citizens (the \"[[capite censi]]\" or \"head count\") whose future after service could only be assured if their general could bring about land distribution and pay on their behalf. In the broad sweep of history, this reliance on poor men would make soldiers strongly loyal not to the Senate and people of Rome, but to their generals whom would be perceived as friends, comrades, benefactors, and patrons of soldiers.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=114}}\n\nMarius, however, in his successive consulships, also overhauled the training and logistical organisation of his men. Instead of baggage trains, Marius had his troops carry all their weapons, blankets, clothes, and rations.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=135}} This led to Roman soldiers of the time being referred to as Marius' mules. He also improved the ''pilum'', a javelin which (after improvement) when thrown and impacting the enemy, would bend so to be unusable.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=136}} While Marius is credited for many of the reforms in his period, there is no evidence to support the claim that it was Marius who changed the tactical unit of the army from the ''maniple'' to the ''cohort''.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=136}}\n\n==== Battle with the Germanic tribes ====\n{{Main|Battle of Aquae Sextiae|Battle of Vercellae}}The People's Assembly was nervous enough about the Cimbric threat and disunity in command to reelect Marius to three successive consulships (in 104, in 103 and in 102 BC).[[File:Gaius_Fundanius,_denarius,_101_BC,_RRC_326-1.jpg|thumb|250x250px|[[Denarius]] of the [[quaestor]] Gaius Fundanius, 101 BC.

The Teutones and their allies the Ambrones were to head south and advance toward Italy along the Mediterranean coast;{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=140}} the Cimbri were to attempt to cross the Alps into Italy from the north by the [[Brenner Pass]]; and the [[Tigurini]] (the allied Celtic tribe who had defeated Longinus in 107) were to cross the Alps from the northeast.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=141}} This decision proved fatally flawed. The Germanic warriors divided their forces, making each contingent manageable, and the Romans could use their shorter lines of communication and supply to concentrate their forces at will.\n\nFirst, Marius had to deal with the Teutones and their allies the [[Ambrones]], who were in the province of [[Gallia Narbonensis|Narbonensis]] marching toward the Alps. He frustrated them by refusing to give battle, and withdrew to a ridge across the river near [[Aquae Sextiae]], which blocked their path.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=141}}<ref name=\"LTS62\">Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 62.</ref> The leading contingent of the Germanic warriors, the Ambrones, [[Battle of Aquae Sextiae|attacked]] the Roman position without waiting for reinforcements, they had to charge uphill while the Romans fought downhill, the Romans had the advantage and 30,000 Ambrones' warriors were killed.<ref name=LTS62/> While waiting for the Teutones to arrive, Marius sent one of his [[Roman legate|legates]], Claudius Marcellus, with 3,000 troops away from the battlefield and ordered him to remain undetected until a determined time when he would appear at the enemy rear.<ref>Marc Hyden, ''Gaius Marius'', pp 136-137.</ref> The next day when the main Germanic contingent finally attacked, the hidden Roman troops would fall on them from the rear. In the ensuing [[Battle of Aquae Sextiae]], the Teutones were completely annihilated, suffering somewhere between 100 thousand and 200 thousand dead.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=141}}\n\nMarius' consular colleague in 102 BC, [[Quintus Lutatius Catulus|Quintus Lutatius Catulus Caesar]], did not fare so well.

Rallying volunteers from the urban plebs and his veterans, Marius cut the water supply to the Capitoline hill and put Saturinus' barricades under a short and decisive siege.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=157}} After Saturninus and Glaucia surrendered, Marius attempted to keep Saturninus and his followers alive by locking them safely inside the [[Curia Hostilia|Senate house]], where they would await prosecution according to the law.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=157}} Possibly with Marius' implied consent, an angry mob broke into the building and, by dislodging the roof tiles and throwing them at the prisoners below, lynched those inside.<ref>Appian, ''BC'' 1.32</ref>{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=157-158}} Glaucia too was dragged from his house and killed in the street.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=158}}\n\nIn complying with the Senate's wishes, Marius tried to show the Senate, who had always been suspicious of his motives, that he was one of them instead of the outsider that Quintus Metellus said he was in 108 BC. Marius's overall concern, for his part, was always how to maintain the Senate's esteem: in the words of the scholar [[A.N. Sherwin-White]], Marius 'wanted to end his days as ''vir censorius'', like the other great worthies among the ''novi homines'' of the second century'.<ref>A.N. Sherwin-White, 'Violence in Roman Politics', ''JRS'' 46 (1956), p. 5</ref>\n\n=== 90s BC ===\nAfter the events of 100 BC, Marius at first tried to oppose the recall of Metellus Numidicus, who had been exiled by Saturninus in 103. However, seeing that opposition was impossible, Marius decided to travel to the east in 98 BC, ostensibly to fulfil a vow he had made to the goddess ''Bona Dea''.<ref name=\"Plutarch, Marius 31.1\">Plutarch, ''Marius'' 31.1</ref>\n\nPlutarch portrays this voluntary exile as a great humiliation for the six-time consul: 'considered obnoxious to the nobles and to the people alike', he was even forced to abandon his candidature for the censorship of 97.<ref>Plutarch, ''Marius'' 30</ref> Plutarch also reports that while in the East, Marius attempted to goad [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]] into declaring war on Rome, so that the Roman people might be forced to rely on Marius's military leadership once more.<ref name=\"Plutarch, Marius 31.1\" />\n\nHowever, scholars have pointed out that Marius's supposed 'humiliation' cannot have been too long-lasting. In c. 98\u201397 BC, he was given the unprecedented honour of being elected ''in absentia'' to the college of priestly [[augur]]s whilst away in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]].<ref>Cicero, ''Ad Brutum'' I.5.3</ref> Furthermore, Marius's mere presence at the trial of [[Manius Aquillius (consul 101 BC)|Manius Aquillius]] in 98 BC, his friend and former colleague as consul in 101 BC, was enough to secure acquittal for the accused, even though he was apparently guilty.<ref>Cicero, ''de oratore'' 2.194-6</ref><ref>Cicero, ''Pro Flacco'' 98</ref> In 95 BC, Marius also successfully acted as sole defence for T.

But in 95 BC, Rome passed a decree, the ''Lex Licinia Mucia'', expelling from the city all residents who were not Roman citizens. In 91 BC, [[Marcus Livius Drusus (tribune)|Marcus Livius Drusus]] was elected tribune and proposed a greater division of state lands, the enlargement of the Senate, and a conferral of Roman citizenship upon all freemen of Italy.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=162}} But after Drusus was assassinated,{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=171}} many of the Italian states then revolted against Rome in the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)|Social War]] of 91\u201388 BC, named after the Latin word for ally, ''socii''.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=172}}\n\nMarius, rather humiliatingly, had to serve as a legate with his nephew, the consul [[Publius Rutilius Lupus (consul)|Publius Rutilius Lupus]].

Either he had withdrawn under the pretext of ill-health because he felt he was being under-appreciated or he was genuinely ill.

And in 90 BC, the Assembly carried a law, the {{Lang|la|[[lex Julia]] de civitate latinis et sociis danda}} to grant citizenship to Italians not yet under arms. In early 89 BC, with the expansion of the war slowing, the Senate dispatched [[Lucius Porcius Cato]] to take over the troops under Marius' command. Shortly after arriving, he forced Marius to resign his legateship by claiming he was in poor health.{{sfn|Duncan|2017|p=179}}\n\nMarius' experience in the conflict brought him few honours, though he served at a senior level and won at least a few victories.

We know of fourteen victims important enough to be named, including six former consuls.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=213}} Lucius Licinius Crassus (older brother of [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|the triumvir]]), [[Gaius Atilius Serranus]], [[Marcus Antonius Orator]], [[Lucius Julius Caesar (consul 90 BC)|Lucius Julius Caesar]], his brother Caesar Strabo, Quintus Mucius Scaevola the Augur, Publius Cornelius Lentulus, Gaius Nemotorius, Gaius Baebius and Octavius Ruso.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=212}} For five days, the Marian faction purged the city of its enemies before putting an end to the terror.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 114.</ref> Following the short purge, Cinna organised elections, where he permitted two people to run for consul: himself and Marius.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=215}} Naturally, they were elected as consuls for 86 BC.\n\nPlutarch relates several opinions on the end of Marius: one, from [[Posidonius]], holds that Marius contracted [[pleurisy]]; Gaius Piso has it that Marius walked with his friends and discussed all of his accomplishments with them, adding that no intelligent man ought leave himself to fortune.<ref>Plutarch, Life of Marius, 45.</ref> Plutarch then anonymously relates that Marius, having gone into a fit of passion in which he announced in a delusionary manner that he was in command of the [[First Mithridatic War|Mithridatic War]], began to act as he would have on the field of battle; finally, Plutarch relates, that ever an ambitious man, Marius lamented, on his death bed, that he had not achieved all of which he was capable, despite his having acquired great wealth and having been chosen consul more times than any man before him.\n\nMarius died on 13 January 86 BC, just seventeen days into his seventh consulship.<ref>Plutarch, Life of Marius, 45 & 46.</ref> [[Lucius Valerius Flaccus]] succeeded Marius as consul.<ref>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered'', p. 115.</ref> Cinna would lead the Marian faction into the civil war, which continued until Sulla won control of the state and made himself dictator with an undefined term.\n\n==Legacy==\nMarius was a highly successful Roman general and military reformer. In ancient sources, he is repeatedly characterised as having unending ambition and opportunism.{{Efn|This is especially the case of Marius' characterisation in the narratives of both Sallust and Plutarch.|name=|group=}} Plutarch says of him:\n\n{{bquote|if Marius could have been persuaded to sacrifice to the Greek Muses and Graces, he would not have put the ugliest possible crown upon a most illustrious career in field and forum, nor have been driven by the blasts of passion, ill-timed ambition, and insatiable greed upon the shore of a most cruel and savage old age.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Marius*.html |title=Plutarch, Life of Marius}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}This characterisation is not viewed by modern historians as entirely fair,{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=169}} for Marius' attempts to win the consulship and for self-aggrandisement were not out of the norm of politicians of the middle to late Republic.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=114}} Marius' legacy is heavily defined by his example: his five successive consulships, while seen contemporaneously as necessary for the survival of Roman civilisation, gave unprecedented power into the hands of a single man over a never-before-seen length of time.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=211}}\n\n=== Reforms to the legions ===\nThe Marian reforms to the logistics and organisation of the Roman armies were profound, increasing the speed and agility of the military to react to foreign threats.{{Sfn|Duncan|2017|p=135}}\n\nIn the ancient narratives, his reforms to the recruitment process for the Roman legions are roundly criticised for creating a soldiery wholly loyal to their generals and beholden to their beneficence of ability to secure payment from the state.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=91}} However, this development did not emerge from Marius. And it was likely initially envisioned as nothing more than a temporary measure to meet the extraordinary threats of Numidia and the Cimbrian tribes.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=211}}\n\nFirst, \"the property qualification for army service had become nearly meaningless by 107\" with exemptions from the property qualifications becoming commonplace and recurrent.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=91}} Marius' recruitment reforms simply made plain what had been for some time commonplace,{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=91}} out of need for men or simply the expediency of calling up urban volunteers rather than conscripting farmers.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=92}}\n\nSecond, the decision to call up the {{Lang|la|proletarii}} would not be fully felt until the time to draw down the troops. As the spoils of war became increasingly inadequate as compensation for the soldiers \u2013 the spoils of war do not guarantee a long term stream of income \u2013 it became common practice to allocate land for the foundation of veteran colonies (generally abroad).{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=212}} Passage of the legislation necessary to establish these colonies became an \"increasingly irksome chore [dogging] the footsteps of senior politicians on their return ... from service overseas\".{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=212}}\n\n=== The Assemblies and foreign affairs ===\nMarius' repeated use of the Assemblies to overturn the Senatorial commands had significant negative effects on the stability of the state.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=93}} The Senate generally used [[sortition]] to choose generals for command posts, removing the conflict of interest between consuls.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=93}} In the late 120s BC, [[Gaius Gracchus]] passed a {{Lang|la|lex Sempronia de provinciis consularibus}} which required that commands be assigned before the election of consuls. Evans writes of this ''lex Sempronia'':\n{{Quote|text=The legislation is generally seen as popular legislation for foiling senatorial contrivance of commands, and for reducing the political intrigue which often accompanied the selection of generals. It was also a sound administrative device which cracked down on the ambitions of senators who sought the leadership of special military ventures.{{sfn|Evans|1995|p=94}}|sign=|source=}}\nMarius' use of the Assemblies to remove Metellus from command in Numidia spelled an end for collective governance in foreign affairs.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=91}} In later years, use of {{Lang|la|plebiscita}} became the main means by which commands were granted (or stolen) from other generals, adding to personal rivalries and diminishing the ability to govern the state.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=210}} The size of the rewards gained from manipulating the Assemblies was irresistible to future generations of ambitious politicians.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=211}}\n\nThe similar use of the Assemblies in an attempt to replace Sulla with Marius for the [[First Mithridatic War|Mithridatic War]] was unprecedented, as never before had laws been passed to confer commands on someone lacking any official title in the state.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=163}} Sulla's reaction of marching on the city proved disastrous for the Republic, leading to the normalisation of military interference in political affairs.\n\n=== Political violence ===\nWhile political violence had been increasingly normalised throughout the middle and late Republic, starting with the murder of the [[Gracchi|Gracchi brothers]], the passage of the {{Lang|la|[[senatus consultum ultimum]]}} against Saturninus and Glaucia in Marius' sixth consulship normalised the use of force not only against private citizens, but also \"against properly elected magistrates in order to preserve [the Senate's] own position\".{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=212}}\n\nMoreover, Marius' attempts to undermine Sulla's command at the start of the [[First Mithridatic War]] massively expanded the scope of that violence. No longer would only mobs clash in the streets of Rome. No longer would personal grudges solely be pursued in the courts:{{Efn|Examples of this are the extortion and treason courts set up by Saturninus and Gaius Mamilius' [[Mamilian commission]]}} political enemies would be executed en masse.{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=169}}{{Efn|See both Sulla and Marius' purges of the city after they captured it under arms.|name=|group=}} At a broad level, the use of the Assemblies totally eroded senatorial control and created significant and prolonged instability,{{Sfn|Evans|1995|p=167}} only resolved by the destruction of the Republican form of government and the transition to [[Roman Empire|Empire]].\n\n==Timeline==\n<timeline>\nImageSize  = width:1000 height:1000\nPlotArea   = left:40 right:0 top:10 bottom:10\nDateFormat = yyyy\nTimeAxis   = orientation:vertical format:yyyy order:reverse\nPeriod     = from:-160 till:-85\nAlignBars  = early\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:5 start:-160\nScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:-160\n\nColors =\n  id:gray value:gray(0.7)\n  id:lightsteelblue value:rgb(0.418, 0.609, 0.800)\n\nDefine $dx = 20 # shift text to right side of bar\n\nPlotData =\n  bar:event width:20 color:gray shift:($dx,-4)\n\n  from:start till:end color:lightsteelblue\n\n  mark:(line, white)\n  at:-157 fontsize:M text: BC 157 \u2013 Born in Arpinum\n  at:-134 fontsize:M text: BC 134 \u2013 Military tribune\n  at:-120 fontsize:M text: BC 120 \u2013 Plebeian tribune\n  at:-116 fontsize:M text: BC 116 \u2013 Praetor\n  at:-114 fontsize:M text: BC 114 \u2013 Sent to govern Lusitania\n  at:-110 fontsize:M text: BC 110 \u2013 Marriage to Julia\n  at:-109 fontsize:M text: BC 109 \u2013 Returned to army service as legate to Caecilius Metellus\n  at:-107 fontsize:M text: BC 107 \u2013 First consulship, abolished land ownership qualification for military service (Marian Reforms)\n  at:-101 fontsize:M text: BC 101 \u2013 Led successful Roman defense during the Germanic Invasions\n  from:-104 till:-100 fontsize:M text: Elected as consul for five consecutive years.\n  from:-91 till:-88 fontsize:M text: Returns to lead Roman army in the Social War\n  at:-87 fontsize:M text: BC 87 \u2013 Demands command against Mithradates in bargain with Sulpicius, Sulla assaults Rome and reclaims command, Marius exiled to Africa, returns from exile with an army and assaults Rome\n  at:-86 fontsize:M text: BC 86 \u2013 Seventh consulship alongside Cinna; died early January\n\n</timeline>\n\n==Consulships==\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Servius Sulpicius Galba (consul 108 BC)|Ser.
