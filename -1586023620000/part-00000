The bones of the jaws, the [[human mandible|mandible]] and [[maxilla]], are the [[bone]]s with the highest prevalence of [[cyst]]s in the human body. This is due to the abundant amount of [[epithelium|epithelial]] remnants that can be left in the bones of the jaws.  The [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] of [[teeth]] is formed from [[ectoderm]] (the precursor germ layer to skin and [[mucosa]]), and so remnants of epithelium can be left in the bone during [[odontogenesis]] (tooth development).

The vast majority of cysts expand slowly, and the surrounding bone has time to increase its density around the lesion, which is the body's attempt to isolate the lesion. \n\nCysts that have expanded beyond the normal anatomic boundaries of a bone are still often covered with a thin layer of new bone. At this stage, there may be a sign termed \"eggshell cracking\", where the thinned [[cortical bone|cortical plate]] cracks when pressure is applied. \n\nA lump may be felt, which may feel hard if there is still bone covering the cyst, or fluctuant if the cyst has eroded through the bone surrounding it.<ref name=\"Wray 2003\">{{cite book|vauthors=Wray D, Stenhouse D, Lee D, Clark AJ |title=Textbook of general and oral surgery|year=2003|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Edinburgh [etc.]|isbn=978-0443070839|pages=229\u2013237}}</ref> A cyst may become acutely infected, and discharge into the oral cavity via a sinus.

The bones of the jaws, the [[human mandible|mandible]] and [[maxilla]], are the [[bone]]s with the highest prevalence of [[cyst]]s in the human body. This is due to the abundant amount of [[epithelium|epithelial]] remnants that can be left in the bones of the jaws.  The [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] of [[teeth]] is formed from [[ectoderm]] (the precursor germ layer to skin and [[mucosa]]), and so remnants of epithelium can be left in the bone during [[odontogenesis]] (tooth development).

They also found that during storms, methane levels in the water column drop dramatically, when wind-driven air-sea gas exchange accelerates the ebullition process into the atmosphere.

We show here that concentrations of greenhouse gasses will probably have reached levels before the year 2100 that are sufficient to raise the temperature past this warming threshold.|bibcode = 2004Natur.428..616G }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Conference in Ilulissat, Greenland: Landmark political declaration on the future of the Arctic\">{{cite news|title=Conference in Ilulissat, Greenland: Landmark political declaration on the future of the Arctic |url=http://www.um.dk/en/servicemenu/News/ConferenceInIlulissatGreenlandLandmarkPoliticalDeclarationOnTheFutureOfTheArctic.htm |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark |date=28 May 2008 |accessdate=6 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615022625/http://www.um.dk/en/servicemenu/News/ConferenceInIlulissatGreenlandLandmarkPoliticalDeclarationOnTheFutureOfTheArctic.htm |archivedate=15 June 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"E SF, VR, FORMAS sign MOU to promote Global Environmental Change Research\">{{cite web | first = Corinne | last = Wininger | url = http://www.innovations-report.com/html/reports/environment_sciences/report-93680.html | title = E SF, VR, FORMAS sign MOU to promote Global Environmental Change Research | publisher = innovations-report.de | date = 26 October 2007 | accessdate = 26 November 2007}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eisenman2009\">{{cite journal | last = Eisenman | first = Ian |author2=Wettlaufer, J.S. |authorlink=Ian Eisenman| year = 2009 | title = Nonlinear threshold behavior during the loss of Arctic sea ice | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 106 | issue = 1 | pages = 28\u201332 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0806887106 | url = http://pantheon.yale.edu/%7Ejw378/articles/E&W_Bif_PNAS.pdf | pmid = 19109440 | pmc = 2629232 | bibcode = 2009PNAS..106...28E|arxiv = 0812.4777 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"esa\">{{cite web | url = http://www.esa.int/esaLP/ESAOMH1VMOC_LPcryosat_0.html | title = ESA's ice mission CryoSat-2 | date = 11 September 2008 | publisher = esa.int | accessdate = 15 June 2009}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"EUX\">{{cite news|title=Denmark aims for meeting of Arctic nations to discuss borders |url=http://www.eux.tv/article.aspx?articleId=14443 |format=online |work=Denmark-Diplomacy |publisher=[[EUX.TV]] the Europe channel |date=13 September 2007 |accessdate=16 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229021337/http://www.eux.tv/article.aspx?articleId=14443 |archivedate=29 February 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"From 2 Satellites, the Big Picture on Ice Melt\">{{cite news| url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/08/from-2-satellites-the-big-picture-on-ice-melt/ | work=The New York Times | first=Joanna M. | last=Foster | title=From 2 Satellites, the Big Picture on Ice Melt | date=8 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Global Environmental Change \u2013 The Role of the Arctic Region\">{{cite web | first = Annakarin | last = Svenningsson | title = Global Environmental Change \u2013 The Role of the Arctic Region | url = http://www.innovations-report.de/html/berichte/veranstaltungen/bericht-92741.html | publisher = innovations-report.de | date = 14 October 2007 | accessdate = 16 October 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110927124322/http://www.innovations-report.de/html/berichte/veranstaltungen/bericht-92741.html | archivedate = 27 September 2011 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"guardian\">{{cite news|author=Goldenberg S|date=24 July 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/24/greenland-ice-sheet-thaw-nasa |title=Greenland ice sheet melted at unprecedented rate during July |work=The Guardian |accessdate=4 November 2012 |location=London}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Increasing rates of ice mass loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets revealed by GRACE\">{{cite journal |author=Velicogna, I. |title=Increasing rates of ice mass loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets revealed by GRACE |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=36 |issue=19 |pages=L19503 |year=2009 |doi=10.1029/2009GL040222 |bibcode = 2009GeoRL..3619503V |citeseerx=10.1.1.170.8753 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ipcc\">[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] [[AR4]] chapter 10 [http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter10.pdf] Table 10.7</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"NASA -

From sonar measurements in recent years researchers quantified the density of bubbles emanating from the subsea permafrost into the Ocean (a process called ebullition), and found that 100\u2013630&nbsp;mg methane per square meters is emitted daily along the East Siberian Shelf, into the water column. They also found that during storms, methane levels in the water column drop dramatically, when wind-driven air-sea gas exchange accelerates the ebullition process into the atmosphere. This observed pathway suggests that methane from seabed permafrost will progress rather slowly, instead of abrupt changes. However, Arctic cyclones, fueled by [[global warming]] and further accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could contribute to more release from this methane cache, which is really important for the Arctic.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shakhova|first1=Natalia|last2=Semiletov|first2=Igor|last3=Leifer|first3=Ira|last4=Sergienko|first4=Valentin|last5=Salyuk|first5=Anatoly|last6=Kosmach|first6=Denis|last7=Chernykh|first7=Denis|last8=Stubbs|first8=Chris|last9=Nicolsky|first9=Dmitry|date=24 November 2013|title=Ebullition and storm-induced methane release from the East Siberian Arctic Shelf|url=http://www.homepages.ed.ac.uk/shs/Methane/Shakhova%202013.pdf|journal=Nature|volume=7|issue=1|pages=64\u201370|doi=10.1038/ngeo2007|accessdate=12 April 2014|via=|first10=Vladimir|last10=Tumskoy|first11=\u00d6rjan|last11=Gustafsson|bibcode=2014NatGe...7...64S}}</ref> An update to the mechanisms of this permafrost degradation, implying the possibility of being close to an acceleration of methane release was published in 2017.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/ncomms15872| pmid=28639616| pmc=5489687| title=Current rates and mechanisms of subsea permafrost degradation in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf| journal=Nature Communications| volume=8| pages=15872| year=2017| last1=Shakhova| first1=Natalia| last2=Semiletov| first2=Igor| last3=Gustafsson| first3=Orjan| last4=Sergienko| first4=Valentin| last5=Lobkovsky| first5=Leopold| last6=Dudarev| first6=Oleg| last7=Tumskoy| first7=Vladimir| last8=Grigoriev| first8=Michael| last9=Mazurov| first9=Alexey| last10=Salyuk| first10=Anatoly| last11=Ananiev| first11=Roman| last12=Koshurnikov| first12=Andrey| last13=Kosmach| first13=Denis| last14=Charkin| first14=Alexander| last15=Dmitrevsky| first15=Nicolay| last16=Karnaukh| first16=Victor| last17=Gunar| first17=Alexey| last18=Meluzov| first18=Alexander| last19=Chernykh| first19=Denis| bibcode=2017NatCo...815872S}}</ref>\n\n==Changes in vegetation==\n[[File:Bloody Falls Campsite.jpg|thumb|[[Bloody Falls]] in July 2007.]]\n[[File:Arctic Vegetation Index Trend (WH).png|right|thumb|Western Hemisphere Arctic Vegetation Index Trend]] \n[[File:Arctic Vegetation Index Trend (EH).png|right|thumb|Eastern Hemisphere Vegetation Index Trend]]\nChanges in vegetation are associated with the increases in landscape scale [[methane emissions]].<ref name=\"Methane is a greenhouse gas\">{{Cite journal| title = Thawing sub-arctic permafrost: Effects on vegetation and methane emissions | first8 = B.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instruments measure the intensity of visible and near-infrared light reflecting off of plant leaves.

Shades of green depict areas where plant productivity and abundance increased; shades of brown show where photosynthetic activity declined.  The maps show a ring of greening in the treeless tundra ecosystems of the circumpolar Arctic\u2014the northernmost parts of Canada, Russia, and Scandinavia. Tall shrubs and trees started to grow in areas that were previously dominated by tundra grasses. The researchers concluded that plant growth had increased by 7 to 10 percent overall.\n\nHowever, boreal forests, particularly those in North America, showed a different response to warming. Many boreal forests greened, but the trend was not as strong as it was for tundra of the circumpolar Arctic. In North America, some boreal forests actually experienced \u201cbrowning\u201d (less photosynthetic activity) over the study period.
