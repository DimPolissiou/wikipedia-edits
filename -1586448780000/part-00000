Other innovations to occur in the years after 1932 were the introduction of the [[AP Poll]] in 1934, the tapering of the ends of the [[ball (gridiron football)|football]] in 1934, the awarding of the first [[Heisman Trophy]] in 1935, the first [[1936 NFL draft|NFL draft in 1936]] and the [[1939 Waynesburg vs. Fordham football game|first televised game in 1939]].  Another important event was [[American football at the 1932 Summer Olympics|the American football game]] at the [[1932 Summer Olympics]], which combined with a similar demonstration game at the [[1933 World's Fair]], led to the first [[College All-Star Game]] in 1934, which in turn was an important factor in the growth of [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional football]] in the United States.<ref name=Schmidt/>  American football's explosion in popularity during the second half of the 20th century can be traced to the [[1958 NFL Championship Game]], a contest that has been dubbed the \"Greatest Game Ever Played\". A rival league to the [[NFL]], the [[American Football League]] (AFL), began play in 1960.  In 1966, the NFL initiated the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]] between the two leagues.  The merger lead to the creation of the [[Super Bowl]], which has become the most watched television event in the [[United States]] on an annual basis.<ref name=popular>{{cite web | url = http://www.coldhardfootballfacts.com/Documents/NFL_all_about_SB_1-07.pdf | title = NFL:America's Choice | year = 2007 | publisher=National Football League | accessdate =2007-08-15 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070808163024/http://www.coldhardfootballfacts.com/Documents/NFL_all_about_SB_1-07.pdf| archivedate = August 8, 2007}}</ref>\n\n{{History of American football}}\n\n== Modern history of intercollegiate football (1933\u2013present) ==\n\n=== Modernization of intercollegiate American football (1933\u20131969) ===\n[[File:Football signed by Gerald R.

Although before the mid-1920s most national powers came from the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] or the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], the trend changed when several teams from the South and the West Coast achieved national success. [[Wallace William Wade]]'s [[1925 Alabama Crimson Tide football team#1925|1925 Alabama]] team won the [[1926 Rose Bowl]] after receiving its first national title and [[William Alexander (coach)|William Alexander]]'s 1928 [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] team defeated [[California Golden Bears football|California]] in the [[1929 Rose Bowl]]. College football quickly became the most popular spectator sport in the South.<ref>Vancil (2000), pp 24\u201329</ref>\n\nSeveral major modern college football conferences rose to prominence during this time period. The [[Southwest Athletic Conference]] had been founded in 1915. Consisting mostly of schools from Texas, the conference saw back-to-back national champions with [[TCU Horned Frogs football|Texas Christian University]] (TCU) in 1938 and [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M]] in 1939.<ref name=1930s>MacCambridge (1999), pp 124</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = A Look Back at the Southwest Conference | work = 2006\u20132007 Texas Almanac | publisher = The Dallas Morning News | year = 2007 | url =https://texasalmanac.com/topics/sports/look-back-southwest-conference | accessdate = 2018-07-04}}</ref>  The [[Pacific Coast Conference]] (PCC), a precursor to the contemporary [[Pac-12 Conference]], had its own back-to-back champion in the [[USC Trojans football|University of Southern California]] which was awarded the title in 1931 and 1932.<ref name=1930s/>  The [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) formed in 1932 and consisted mostly of schools in the [[Deep South]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Ours | first = Robert M. | title = Southeastern Conference | encyclopedia=College Football Encyclopedia | publisher=Augusta Computer Services | year = 2007 | url = http://footballencyclopedia.com/sechome.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070510232409/http://footballencyclopedia.com/sechome.htm | archivedate = 2007-05-10 | accessdate =2007-05-31}}</ref>  As in previous decades, the Big Ten continued to dominate in the 1930s and 1940s, with Minnesota winning 5 titles between 1934 and 1941, and Michigan (1933, 1947, and 1948) and [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] (1942) also winning titles.<ref name=1930s/><ref name=1940s>MacCambridge (1999), pp 148</ref>\n[[File:Hutson-Don-1940-grainfix.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Don Hutson]] in 1940.]]\nAs it grew beyond its regional affiliations in the 1930s, college football garnered increased national attention. Four new [[bowl game]]s were created: the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]], [[Sugar Bowl]], the [[Sun Bowl]] in 1935, and the [[Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl]] in 1937. In lieu of an actual national championship, these bowl games, along with the earlier Rose Bowl, provided a way to match up teams from distant regions of the country that did not otherwise play. In 1936, the [[Associated Press]] began its [[AP Poll|weekly poll]] of prominent sports writers, ranking all of the nation's college football teams. Since there was no national championship game, the final version of the AP poll was used to determine who was crowned the [[Mythical National Championship|National Champion]] of college football.<ref>Vancil (2000), pp 30</ref>\n\nThe 1930s saw growth in the passing game. Though some coaches, such as General [[Robert Neyland]] at Tennessee, continued to eschew its use, several rules changes to the game had a profound effect on teams' ability to throw the ball. In 1934, the rules committee removed two major penalties\u2014a loss of five yards for a second incomplete pass in any series of downs and a loss of possession for an incomplete pass in the end zone\u2014and shrunk the circumference of the ball, making it easier to grip and throw. Players who became famous for taking advantage of the easier passing game included Alabama end [[Don Hutson]] and TCU passer [[Sammy Baugh|\"Slingin\" Sammy Baugh]].<ref>Vancil (2000), pp 28\u201330</ref>\n\nIn 1935, New York City's [[Downtown Athletic Club]] awarded the first [[Heisman Trophy]] to [[University of Chicago]] halfback [[Jay Berwanger]], who was also the first ever [[NFL Draft]] pick in 1936. The trophy was designed by sculptor [[Frank Eliscu]] and modeled after [[New York University]] player [[Ed Smith (football player)|Ed Smith]].

From 1941 to 1952, the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) allowed unlimited substitution. This change was originally made because of the difficulty in fielding highly skilled players during the years of the Second World War, in which many able-bodied college-age men volunteered for or were drafted into military service.<ref name=\"one\">Douglas S.

As most of these players had eligibility left on their college careers, some of them returned to college at [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], bringing Army back-to-back national titles in 1944 and 1945 under coach [[Earl Blaik|Red Blaik]]. [[Doc Blanchard]] (known as \"Mr. Inside\") and [[Glenn Davis (halfback)|Glenn Davis]] (known as \"Mr. Outside\") both won the [[Heisman Trophy]], in 1945 and 1946 respectively.

[[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]], under coach [[Bud Wilkinson]], won three national titles (1950, 1955, 1956) and all ten [[Big Eight Conference]] championships in the decade while building a record 47-game winning streak. [[Woody Hayes]] led Ohio State to two national titles, in 1954 and 1957, and dominated the Big Ten conference, winning three [[Big Ten Conference football champions|Big Ten titles]]\u2014more than any other school. Wilkinson and Hayes, along with Robert Neyland of Tennessee, oversaw a revival of the running game in the 1950s. Passing numbers dropped from an average of 18.9 attempts in 1951 to 13.6 attempts in 1955, while teams averaged just shy of 50 running plays per game. Nine out of ten Heisman trophy winners in the 1950s were runners. Notre Dame, one of the biggest passing teams of the decade, saw a substantial decline in success; the 1950s were the only decade between 1920 and 1990 when the team did not win at least a share of the national title. [[Paul Hornung]], Notre Dame quarterback, did, however, win the Heisman in 1956, becoming the only player from a losing team ever to do so.<ref>Vancil (2000), pp 41\u201345</ref><ref name=1950s>MacCambridge (1999) pp 172</ref>\n\nIn 1954, the NCAA emplaced a set of new rules ending free substitution, and thus requiring the use of the [[one-platoon system]], primarily due to financial reasons.<ref name=\"one\"/><ref name=\"thumbs\">Clarence Munn, [http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1128569/index.htm Thumbs Down On The One Platoon], ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', 29 November 1954, retrieved 20 January 2009. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The system allowed only one player to be substituted between plays, which effectively put an end to the use of separate specialized units.<ref name=\"border\"/> [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]] head coach \"General\" [[Robert Neyland]] praised the change as the end of \"chickenshit football\".<ref name=\"one\"/>\n\nFollowing the enormous success of the [[National Football League]]'s [[1958 NFL Championship Game|1958 championship game]], college football no longer enjoyed the same popularity as the NFL, at least on a national level.

In the 1950s, Notre Dame, which had a large national following, formed its own network to broadcast its games, but by and large the sport still retained a mostly regional following. In 1952, the NCAA claimed all television broadcasting rights for the games of its member institutions, and it alone negotiated television rights. This situation continued until 1984, when several schools brought a suit under the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]; the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[NCAA v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Oklahoma|ruled against the NCAA]] and schools are now free to negotiate their own television deals. [[ABC Sports]] began broadcasting a national Game of the Week in 1966, bringing key matchups and rivalries to a national audience for the first time.<ref>Vancil (2000) pp 46\u201348</ref>\n\nNew formations and play sets continued to be developed. [[Emory Bellard]], an assistant coach under [[Darrell Royal]] at the [[Texas Longhorns football|University of Texas]], developed a three-back [[option offense|option]] style offense known as the [[wishbone formation|wishbone]]. The wishbone is a run-heavy offense that depends on the quarterback making last second decisions on when and to whom to hand or pitch the ball to. Royal went on to teach the offense to other coaches, including [[Bear Bryant]] at Alabama, [[Chuck Fairbanks]] at Oklahoma and [[Pepper Rodgers]] at [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]]; who all adapted and developed it to their own tastes.<ref>Vancil (2000), pp 56</ref>  The strategic opposite of the wishbone is the [[spread offense]], developed by professional and college coaches throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Though some schools play a run-based version of the spread, its most common use is as a passing offense designed to \"spread\" the field both horizontally and vertically.<ref name=formations>Bennett (1976), Appendix pp 209\u2013217</ref>  Some teams have managed to adapt with the times to keep winning consistently. In the rankings of the [[NCAA Division I football win-loss records|most victorious programs]], [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]], [[Texas Longhorn football|Texas]], and [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish Football|Notre Dame]] are ranked first, second, and third in total wins.\n\nAfter the 1964 season, twelve years since the mandate requiring one-platoon, the NCAA repealed the rules enforcing its use and allowed an unlimited amount of player substitutions.<ref name=\"border\"/><ref>[http://www.athlonsports.com/college-football/4331/17-reasons-why-knute-rockne-wouldnt-recognize-this-game 17 Reasons Why Knute Rockne Wouldn't Recognize This Game], Athlon Sports, retrieved 20 January 2009.</ref> This allowed, starting with the 1965 season,<ref>Robert C.

Many schools, at the behest of the NCAA, commemorated the 1969 season by wearing a special decal on their football helmets.  The decal consisted of the numeral \"100\" inside a football shaped outline.  The decal was designed to commemorate the 1869 game between [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers]] and [[Princeton Tigers football|Princeton]], often cited as the [[1869 college football season|first college football game]].  Decals varied greatly from one team to another.  Some teams placed the decals unobtrusively on the front or back of the helmet.  Other teams placed them prominently on the side, either in addition to or in place of their regular team logo.  Colors and design of the decals also varied greatly between teams; with different numeral styles and color schemes in use.<ref>{{cite web | title = The College Football Centennial Logo | url = http://www.nationalchamps.net/Helmet_Project/1969.htm | work = The Helmet Project | publisher = NationalChamps.net | last = Arey | first = Charles | accessdate = 2010-04-24}}</ref>  One notable exception was [[Harvard Crimson football|Harvard]], which abstained from the 1969 commemoration, and had its own special helmet decal made for the [[1974 NCAA Division I football season|1974 season]], which commemorates an 1874 game that Harvard played against [[McGill University|McGill]] that Harvard claims was the \"real\" first American football game.<ref>{{cite web | title = Ivy League football helmets | url = http://www.nationalchamps.net/Helmet_Project/ivy.htm | work = The Helmet Project | publisher = NationalChamps.net | last = Arey | first = Charles | accessdate = 2010-04-24| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100324211654/http://www.nationalchamps.net/Helmet_Project/ivy.htm| archivedate=March 24, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Modern intercollegiate football (1970\u2013present) ===\n\n==== Growth of bowl games ====\n{{See also|Bowl game}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;\"\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''Bowl Game Growth'''<ref name=bowls1>{{cite news | last = Call | first = Jeff | title = Changing seasons: Y. reconnects with past, but bowl scene not the same | work=Deseret News | date = December 20, 2006 | page = D5}}</ref>\n|-\n!

By 1950, three more had joined that number and in 1970, there were still only eight major college bowl games. The number grew to eleven in 1976. At the birth of cable television and cable sports networks like [[ESPN]], there were fifteen bowls in 1980. With more national venues and increased available revenue, the bowls saw an explosive growth throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In the thirty years from 1950 to 1980, seven bowl games were added to the schedule. From 1980 to 2008, an additional 20 bowl games were added to the schedule.<ref name=bowls1/><ref name=hickok1>{{cite web | title = College Bowl Games | work=Hickok Sports | year = 2006 | url = http://hickoksports.com/history/collbowl.shtml | archiveurl = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020223060707/http://www.hickoksports.com/history/collbowl.shtml | archivedate = 2002-02-23 | accessdate =2007-06-01}}</ref>  Some have criticized this growth, claiming that the increased number of games has diluted the significance of playing in a bowl game.

As conferences became contractually bound to certain bowl games (a situation known as a [[Automatic bids to non-BCS bowls|tie-in]]), match-ups that guaranteed a consensus national champion became increasingly rare. In 1992, seven conferences and independent Notre Dame formed the [[Bowl Coalition]], which attempted to arrange an annual No.1 versus No.2 matchup based on the final AP poll standings. The Coalition lasted for three years; however, several scheduling issues prevented much success; tie-ins still took precedence in several cases. For example, the Big Eight and SEC champions could never meet, since they were contractually bound to different bowl games. The coalition also excluded the Rose Bowl, arguably the most prestigious game in the nation, and two major conferences\u2014the Pac-10 and Big Ten\u2014meaning that it had limited success. In 1995, the Coalition was replaced by the [[Bowl Alliance]], which reduced the number of bowl games to host a national championship game to three\u2014the [[Fiesta Bowl|Fiesta]], Sugar, and Orange Bowls\u2014and the participating conferences to five\u2014the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]], [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]], [[Southwest Conference|Southwest]], [[Big Eight Conference|Big Eight]], and [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East]]. It was agreed that the No.1 and No.2 ranked teams gave up their prior bowl tie-ins and were guaranteed to meet in the national championship game, which rotated between the three participating bowls. The system still did not include the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]], [[Pacific-10 Conference|Pac-10]], or the [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]], and thus still lacked the legitimacy of a true national championship.<ref name=hickok1/><ref name=BCS>{{cite web | title = BCS Chronology | publisher=FOX Sports on MSN | year = 2006 | url = http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/history | accessdate =2007-06-01|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070915010233/http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/history |archivedate = September 15, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==== Bowl Championship Series (1998\u20132013) ====\n{{Main article|Bowl Championship Series}}\n{{See also|NCAA Division I Football Championship}}\nIn 1998, a new system was put into place called the Bowl Championship Series. For the first time, it included all major conferences (ACC, Big East, Big 12, Big Ten, Pac-10, and SEC) and all four major bowl games (Rose, Orange, Sugar and Fiesta). The champions of these six conferences, along with two \"at-large\" selections, were invited to play in the four bowl games. Each year, one of the four bowl games served as a national championship game. Also, a complex system of human polls, computer rankings, and strength of schedule calculations was instituted to rank schools. Based on this ranking system, the No.1 and No.2 teams met each year in the national championship game. Traditional tie-ins were maintained for schools and bowls not part of the national championship. For example, in years when not a part of the national championship, the Rose Bowl still hosted the Big Ten and Pac-10 champions.<ref name=BCS/>\n\nThe system continued to change, as the formula for ranking teams was tweaked from year to year. At-large teams could be chosen from any of the [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] conferences, though only one selection\u2014[[2004 Utah Utes football team|Utah]] in 2005\u2014came from a non-BCS affiliated conference. Starting with the 2006 season, a fifth game\u2014simply called the [[BCS National Championship Game]]\u2014was added to the schedule, to be played at the site of one of the four BCS bowl games on a rotating basis, one week after the regular bowl game. This opened up the BCS to two additional at-large teams. Also, rules were changed to add the champions of five additional conferences ([[Conference USA]], the [[Mid-American Conference]], the [[Mountain West Conference]], the [[Sun Belt Conference]] and the [[Western Athletic Conference]]), provided that said champion ranked in the top twelve in the final BCS rankings, or was within the top 16 of the BCS rankings and ranked higher than the champion of at least one of the [[Power Five conferences|\"BCS conferences\"]] (also known as \"AQ\" conferences, for Automatic Qualifying).<ref name=BCS/> Several times since this rule change was implemented, schools from non-AQ conferences played in BCS bowl games. In 2009, [[2009 Boise State Broncos football team|Boise State]] played [[2009 TCU Horned Frogs football team|TCU]] in the [[2010 Fiesta Bowl|Fiesta Bowl]], the first time two schools from non-BCS conferences played each other in a BCS bowl game. The final team from the non-AQ ranks to reach a BCS bowl game was [[2012 Northern Illinois Huskies football team|Northern Illinois in 2012]], which played in (and lost) the [[2013 Orange Bowl]].\n\n==== College Football Playoff (2014\u2013present) ====\n{{Main article|College Football Playoff}}\nDue to the intensification of the [[College football playoff debate]] after more than a decade of the sometimes disputable results of the BCS, the conference commissioners and Notre Dame's president voted to implement a [[Plus-One system]] which was to be called the College Football Playoff.  The CFP is the annual postseason tournament for the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) and just as its predecessors, has failed to receive sanctioning from the NCAA.  The playoff began with the [[2014 NCAA Division I FBS football season]].<ref name=McMurphy>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/9204021/football-playoff-name-site|title=Football playoff has name and site|last=McMurphy|first=Brett|date=April 24, 2013|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe CFP system is centered on six major bowl games played on or near New Year's Day, often called the \"New Year's Six\". Three pairs of games rotate annually as hosts of CFP semifinals. The champions of the so-called [[Power Five conferences]] (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12, SEC) all receive guaranteed berths in one of the New Year's Six games, though not necessarily in the CFP semifinals. [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]], a football [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|independent]] but otherwise an ACC member, has its own arrangement for access to the New Year's Six should it meet specified criteria. A selection committee similar to those used by the [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|NCAA basketball tournaments for men and women]] releases a weekly ranking concurrently with the [[AP Poll]] starting with the Monday after Week 10 of the season. After the completion of the regular season, the committee selects the four teams that will compete in the CFP semifinals and the at-large entries to the New Year's Six games. One of the at-large entries is reserved for the top-ranking champion of the so-called \"Group of Five\" conferences ([[American Athletic Conference|American]], [[Conference USA]], [[Mid-American Conference|MAC]], [[Mountain West Conference|Mountain West]], [[Sun Belt Conference|Sun Belt]]).

Marshall, however, was likely not the only reason: the [[Great Depression]] had stoked an increase in racism and self-inflicted segregation across the country, and internal politics likely had as much of an effect as external pressure.<ref name=\"hof\"/> Marshall's hostility was specifically directed at the black race; he openly allowed (and promoted) Native Americans on his team, including his first head coach, [[Lone Star Dietz]], widely believed to be a Native American at the time.

That same year, [[Dallas]], Texas businessman [[Lamar Hunt]] led the formation of the rival [[American Football League]], the fourth such league to bear that name, with war hero and former South Dakota Governor [[Joe Foss]] as its Commissioner. Unlike the earlier rival leagues, and bolstered by television exposure, the AFL posed a significant threat to NFL dominance of the professional football world. In 1960, the AFL began play with eight teams and a double round-robin schedule of fourteen games. New NFL commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] took office the same year.<ref name=NFL1951/> The AFL generally avoided placing teams in markets where they directly competed with established NFL franchises. Although four inaugural AFL teams shared markets with NFL teams\u2014the [[Kansas City Chiefs|Dallas Texans]], [[San Diego Chargers|Los Angeles Chargers]], [[New York Jets|Titans of New York]], and [[Oakland Raiders]] (the latter sharing the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] with the [[San Francisco 49ers]])\u2014only the franchises in New York (renamed the New York Jets) and Oakland remained in direct competition with NFL teams after the league's early years. The Chargers moved to San Diego after the 1960 season and the Texans moved to Kansas City after the 1962 season, becoming the Chiefs.\n\nWhen [[Chuck Bednarik]] retired from playing [[linebacker]] and [[Center (American and Canadian football)|center]] for the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in 1962, he became professional football's last full-time two-way player.<ref>{{College Football HoF/url|id=1697|name=Chuck \"Concrete Charlie\" Bednarik|accessdate=20 January 2009}}</ref> After his retirement, Bednarik became an outspoken critic of the modern football player's lack of stamina under free substitution.<ref name=\"one\"/><ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A63604-2005Feb4_2.html Bednarik wants Eagles to lose Super Bowl], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 4 February 2005, retrieved 20 January 2009.</ref><ref>[https://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/06/sports/sp-bednarik6 Bednarik Showing His Bitter Side], ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', p.

The AFL worked hard to secure top college players, many from sources virtually untapped by the established league: small colleges and [[Historically black colleges and universities|predominantly black colleges]]. Two of the eight coaches of the [[Foolish Club|Original Eight]] AFL franchises, [[Hank Stram]] ([[Kansas City Chiefs|Texans/Chiefs]]) and [[Sid Gillman]] ([[San Diego Chargers|Chargers]]) eventually were inducted to the Hall of Fame. Led by [[Oakland Raiders]] owner and AFL commissioner [[Al Davis]], the AFL established a \"war chest\" to entice top talent with higher pay than they got from the NFL. Former Green Bay Packers quarterback [[Babe Parilli]] became a star for the [[Boston Patriots]] during the early years of the AFL, and University of Alabama passer [[Joe Namath]] rejected the NFL to play for the [[New York Jets]]. Namath became the face of the league as it reached its height of popularity in the mid-1960s. Davis's methods worked, and in 1966, the junior league forced a partial merger with the NFL. The two leagues agreed to have a common [[NFL Draft|draft]] and play in a common season-ending championship game, known as the AFL-NFL World Championship. Two years later, the game's name was changed to the [[Super Bowl]].<ref name=NFL1961>{{cite web | title = NFL History 1961\u20131970 | work=NFL.com | publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC | year = 2007 | url = http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1961-1970 | accessdate =2007-06-26}}</ref><ref name=AFL>{{cite web | title = Remember the AFL | publisher=American Football League Hall of Fame | year = 2003 | url =http://www.remembertheafl.com/AFL.htm | accessdate =2007-06-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = History of the Super Bowl | publisher=SuperNFL.com | url = http://www.supernfl.com/SuperBowl/SuperBowlHistory.html | accessdate =2007-06-26| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070608100947/http://www.supernfl.com/SuperBowl/SuperBowlHistory.html| archivedate = June 8, 2007}}</ref>\nAFL teams won the next two Super Bowls, and in 1970, the two leagues [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merged]] to form a new 26-team league. The resulting newly expanded NFL eventually incorporated some of the innovations that led to the AFL's success, such as including names on player's jerseys, official scoreboard clocks, national television contracts (the addition of ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' gave the NFL broadcast rights on all of the [[Big Three television networks]]), and sharing of gate and broadcasting revenues between home and visiting teams.<ref name=NFL1961/>\n\nThe Washington Redskins had no black players until [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Interior Secretary]] [[Stewart Udall]] threatened to evict them from [[RFK Stadium|D.

The Redskins first attempted to comply by drafting [[Ernie Davis]], who refused to play under Marshall; the Redskins in turn traded Davis to the [[Cleveland Browns]]. The Redskins eventually signed [[Bobby Mitchell]] and two other African American players by 1962, thus making them the last major professional football team in America to integrate.\n\n[[Vince Lombardi]] led the [[Green Bay Packers]] as both head coach and general manager during the 1960s, where his efforts led the team to three straight and five total [[National Football League]] championships in seven years, in addition to winning the first two [[Super Bowls]] following the [[1966 NFL season|1966]] and [[1967 NFL season|1967 NFL]] seasons.

In 1974, the [[World Football League]] formed and was able to attract such stars as [[Larry Csonka]] away from the NFL with lucrative contracts. However, most of the WFL franchises were insolvent and the league folded in 1975; the [[Memphis Southmen]], the team that had signed Csonka and the most financially stable of the teams, unsuccessfully sued to join the NFL. The [[American Football Association (1979&ndash;1982)|American Football Association]] formed as a continuation of the WFL's legacy in 1978, albeit on a much lower pay scale. That league lasted until 1982.\n\nIn 1970, [[Patricia Palinkas]] became the first woman to ever play on a men's semipro football team when she joined the Orlando Panthers.  In 1974, the [[National Women's Football League]] was founded, starting play with 7 teams.  By the mid-1970s, the average NWFL franchise entry fee was $10,000.  The Toledo Troopers had a record from 1971 through 1976 of 39 wins, 1 loss and 1 tie, but folded in 1980 due to financial problems.  The NWFL took a year off to restructure in 1987, but by the next year the league had split in two, with the remnants of the NWFL based in Toledo and the new Women's Tackle Football Association based in Grand Rapids, Michigan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/sports/womenfootball/nwflhistory.html|title=A History of Women in Tackle Football|website=www.angelfire.com|accessdate=May 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, the [[United States Football League]] formed as a spring league, and enjoyed moderate success during its first two seasons behind such stars as [[Jim Kelly]] and [[Herschel Walker]]. It intended to move its schedule to the fall in 1986, and tried to compete with the NFL directly, but despite winning an anti-trust suit against the older league the USFL was only awarded token damages, depriving the league of the funds it needed to stay solvent. The USFL ceased operations a month before its first fall season was to begin.\n\nThe NFL founded a developmental league known as the [[World League of American Football]] with teams based in the United States, Canada, and Europe. The WLAF ran for two years, from 1991 to 1992. The league went on a two-year hiatus before reorganizing as [[NFL Europa|NFL Europe]] in 1995, with teams only in European cities. The name of the league was changed to NFL Europa in 2006.

Other innovations to occur in the years after 1932 were the introduction of the [[AP Poll]] in 1934, the tapering of the ends of the [[ball (gridiron football)|football]] in 1934, the awarding of the first [[Heisman Trophy]] in 1935, the first [[1936 NFL draft|NFL draft in 1936]] and the [[1939 Waynesburg vs. Fordham football game|first televised game in 1939]].  Another important event was [[American football at the 1932 Summer Olympics|the American football game]] at the [[1932 Summer Olympics]], which combined with a similar demonstration game at the [[1933 World's Fair]], led to the first [[College All-Star Game]] in 1934, which in turn was an important factor in the growth of [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional football]] in the United States.<ref name=Schmidt/>  American football's explosion in popularity during the second half of the 20th century can be traced to the [[1958 NFL Championship Game]], a contest that has been dubbed the \"Greatest Game Ever Played\". A rival league to the [[NFL]], the [[American Football League]] (AFL), began play in 1960.  In 1966, the NFL initiated the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]] between the two leagues.  The merger lead to the creation of the [[Super Bowl]], which has become the most watched television event in the [[United States]] on an annual basis.<ref name=popular>{{cite web | url = http://www.coldhardfootballfacts.com/Documents/NFL_all_about_SB_1-07.pdf | title = NFL:America's Choice | year = 2007 | publisher=National Football League | accessdate =2007-08-15 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070808163024/http://www.coldhardfootballfacts.com/Documents/NFL_all_about_SB_1-07.pdf| archivedate = August 8, 2007}}</ref>\n\n{{History of American football}}\n\n== Modern history of intercollegiate football (1933\u2013present) ==\n\n=== Modernization of intercollegiate American football (1933\u20131969) ===\n[[File:Football signed by Gerald R.

Although before the mid-1920s most national powers came from the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] or the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], the trend changed when several teams from the South and the West Coast achieved national success. [[Wallace William Wade]]'s [[1925 Alabama Crimson Tide football team#1925|1925 Alabama]] team won the [[1926 Rose Bowl]] after receiving its first national title and [[William Alexander (coach)|William Alexander]]'s 1928 [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] team defeated [[California Golden Bears football|California]] in the [[1929 Rose Bowl]]. College football quickly became the most popular spectator sport in the South.<ref>Vancil (2000), pp 24\u201329</ref>\n\nSeveral major modern college football conferences rose to prominence during this time period. The [[Southwest Athletic Conference]] had been founded in 1915. Consisting mostly of schools from Texas, the conference saw back-to-back national champions with [[TCU Horned Frogs football|Texas Christian University]] (TCU) in 1938 and [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M]] in 1939.<ref name=1930s>MacCambridge (1999), pp 124</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = A Look Back at the Southwest Conference | work = 2006\u20132007 Texas Almanac | publisher = The Dallas Morning News | year = 2007 | url =https://texasalmanac.com/topics/sports/look-back-southwest-conference | accessdate = 2018-07-04}}</ref>  The [[Pacific Coast Conference]] (PCC), a precursor to the contemporary [[Pac-12 Conference]], had its own back-to-back champion in the [[USC Trojans football|University of Southern California]] which was awarded the title in 1931 and 1932.<ref name=1930s/>  The [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) formed in 1932 and consisted mostly of schools in the [[Deep South]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Ours | first = Robert M. | title = Southeastern Conference | encyclopedia=College Football Encyclopedia | publisher=Augusta Computer Services | year = 2007 | url = http://footballencyclopedia.com/sechome.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070510232409/http://footballencyclopedia.com/sechome.htm | archivedate = 2007-05-10 | accessdate =2007-05-31}}</ref>  As in previous decades, the Big Ten continued to dominate in the 1930s and 1940s, with Minnesota winning 5 titles between 1934 and 1941, and Michigan (1933, 1947, and 1948) and [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] (1942) also winning titles.<ref name=1930s/><ref name=1940s>MacCambridge (1999), pp 148</ref>\n[[File:Hutson-Don-1940-grainfix.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Don Hutson]] in 1940.]]\nAs it grew beyond its regional affiliations in the 1930s, college football garnered increased national attention. Four new [[bowl game]]s were created: the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]], [[Sugar Bowl]], the [[Sun Bowl]] in 1935, and the [[Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl]] in 1937. In lieu of an actual national championship, these bowl games, along with the earlier Rose Bowl, provided a way to match up teams from distant regions of the country that did not otherwise play. In 1936, the [[Associated Press]] began its [[AP Poll|weekly poll]] of prominent sports writers, ranking all of the nation's college football teams. Since there was no national championship game, the final version of the AP poll was used to determine who was crowned the [[Mythical National Championship|National Champion]] of college football.<ref>Vancil (2000), pp 30</ref>\n\nThe 1930s saw growth in the passing game. Though some coaches, such as General [[Robert Neyland]] at Tennessee, continued to eschew its use, several rules changes to the game had a profound effect on teams' ability to throw the ball. In 1934, the rules committee removed two major penalties\u2014a loss of five yards for a second incomplete pass in any series of downs and a loss of possession for an incomplete pass in the end zone\u2014and shrunk the circumference of the ball, making it easier to grip and throw. Players who became famous for taking advantage of the easier passing game included Alabama end [[Don Hutson]] and TCU passer [[Sammy Baugh|\"Slingin\" Sammy Baugh]].<ref>Vancil (2000), pp 28\u201330</ref>\n\nIn 1935, New York City's [[Downtown Athletic Club]] awarded the first [[Heisman Trophy]] to [[University of Chicago]] halfback [[Jay Berwanger]], who was also the first ever [[NFL Draft]] pick in 1936. The trophy was designed by sculptor [[Frank Eliscu]] and modeled after [[New York University]] player [[Ed Smith (football player)|Ed Smith]].

From 1941 to 1952, the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) allowed unlimited substitution. This change was originally made because of the difficulty in fielding highly skilled players during the years of the Second World War, in which many able-bodied college-age men volunteered for or were drafted into military service.<ref name=\"one\">Douglas S.

[[Doc Blanchard]] (known as \"Mr. Inside\") and [[Glenn Davis (halfback)|Glenn Davis]] (known as \"Mr. Outside\") both won the [[Heisman Trophy]], in 1945 and 1946 respectively.

[[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]], under coach [[Bud Wilkinson]], won three national titles (1950, 1955, 1956) and all ten [[Big Eight Conference]] championships in the decade while building a record 47-game winning streak. [[Woody Hayes]] led Ohio State to two national titles, in 1954 and 1957, and dominated the Big Ten conference, winning three [[Big Ten Conference football champions|Big Ten titles]]\u2014more than any other school. Wilkinson and Hayes, along with Robert Neyland of Tennessee, oversaw a revival of the running game in the 1950s. Passing numbers dropped from an average of 18.9 attempts in 1951 to 13.6 attempts in 1955, while teams averaged just shy of 50 running plays per game. Nine out of ten Heisman trophy winners in the 1950s were runners. Notre Dame, one of the biggest passing teams of the decade, saw a substantial decline in success; the 1950s were the only decade between 1920 and 1990 when the team did not win at least a share of the national title. [[Paul Hornung]], Notre Dame quarterback, did, however, win the Heisman in 1956, becoming the only player from a losing team ever to do so.<ref>Vancil (2000), pp 41\u201345</ref><ref name=1950s>MacCambridge (1999) pp 172</ref>\n\nIn 1954, the NCAA emplaced a set of new rules ending free substitution, and thus requiring the use of the [[one-platoon system]], primarily due to financial reasons.<ref name=\"one\"/><ref name=\"thumbs\">Clarence Munn, [http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1128569/index.htm Thumbs Down On The One Platoon], ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', 29 November 1954, retrieved 20 January 2009. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The system allowed only one player to be substituted between plays, which effectively put an end to the use of separate specialized units.<ref name=\"border\"/> [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]] head coach \"General\" [[Robert Neyland]] praised the change as the end of \"chickenshit football\".<ref name=\"one\"/>\n\nFollowing the enormous success of the [[National Football League]]'s [[1958 NFL Championship Game|1958 championship game]], college football no longer enjoyed the same popularity as the NFL, at least on a national level.

In the 1950s, Notre Dame, which had a large national following, formed its own network to broadcast its games, but by and large the sport still retained a mostly regional following. In 1952, the NCAA claimed all television broadcasting rights for the games of its member institutions, and it alone negotiated television rights. This situation continued until 1984, when several schools brought a suit under the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]; the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[NCAA v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Oklahoma|ruled against the NCAA]] and schools are now free to negotiate their own television deals. [[ABC Sports]] began broadcasting a national Game of the Week in 1966, bringing key matchups and rivalries to a national audience for the first time.<ref>Vancil (2000) pp 46\u201348</ref>\n\nNew formations and play sets continued to be developed. [[Emory Bellard]], an assistant coach under [[Darrell Royal]] at the [[Texas Longhorns football|University of Texas]], developed a three-back [[option offense|option]] style offense known as the [[wishbone formation|wishbone]]. The wishbone is a run-heavy offense that depends on the quarterback making last second decisions on when and to whom to hand or pitch the ball to. Royal went on to teach the offense to other coaches, including [[Bear Bryant]] at Alabama, [[Chuck Fairbanks]] at Oklahoma and [[Pepper Rodgers]] at [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]]; who all adapted and developed it to their own tastes.<ref>Vancil (2000), pp 56</ref>  The strategic opposite of the wishbone is the [[spread offense]], developed by professional and college coaches throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Though some schools play a run-based version of the spread, its most common use is as a passing offense designed to \"spread\" the field both horizontally and vertically.<ref name=formations>Bennett (1976), Appendix pp 209\u2013217</ref>  Some teams have managed to adapt with the times to keep winning consistently. In the rankings of the [[NCAA Division I football win-loss records|most victorious programs]], [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]], [[Texas Longhorn football|Texas]], and [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish Football|Notre Dame]] are ranked first, second, and third in total wins.\n\nAfter the 1964 season, twelve years since the mandate requiring one-platoon, the NCAA repealed the rules enforcing its use and allowed an unlimited amount of player substitutions.<ref name=\"border\"/><ref>[http://www.athlonsports.com/college-football/4331/17-reasons-why-knute-rockne-wouldnt-recognize-this-game 17 Reasons Why Knute Rockne Wouldn't Recognize This Game], Athlon Sports, retrieved 20 January 2009.</ref> This allowed, starting with the 1965 season,<ref>Robert C.

Many schools, at the behest of the NCAA, commemorated the 1969 season by wearing a special decal on their football helmets.  The decal consisted of the numeral \"100\" inside a football shaped outline.  The decal was designed to commemorate the 1869 game between [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers]] and [[Princeton Tigers football|Princeton]], often cited as the [[1869 college football season|first college football game]].  Decals varied greatly from one team to another.  Some teams placed the decals unobtrusively on the front or back of the helmet.

By 1950, three more had joined that number and in 1970, there were still only eight major college bowl games. The number grew to eleven in 1976. At the birth of cable television and cable sports networks like [[ESPN]], there were fifteen bowls in 1980. With more national venues and increased available revenue, the bowls saw an explosive growth throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In the thirty years from 1950 to 1980, seven bowl games were added to the schedule. From 1980 to 2008, an additional 20 bowl games were added to the schedule.<ref name=bowls1/><ref name=hickok1>{{cite web | title = College Bowl Games | work=Hickok Sports | year = 2006 | url = http://hickoksports.com/history/collbowl.shtml | archiveurl = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020223060707/http://www.hickoksports.com/history/collbowl.shtml | archivedate = 2002-02-23 | accessdate =2007-06-01}}</ref>  Some have criticized this growth, claiming that the increased number of games has diluted the significance of playing in a bowl game.

As conferences became contractually bound to certain bowl games (a situation known as a [[Automatic bids to non-BCS bowls|tie-in]]), match-ups that guaranteed a consensus national champion became increasingly rare. In 1992, seven conferences and independent Notre Dame formed the [[Bowl Coalition]], which attempted to arrange an annual No.1 versus No.2 matchup based on the final AP poll standings. The Coalition lasted for three years; however, several scheduling issues prevented much success; tie-ins still took precedence in several cases. For example, the Big Eight and SEC champions could never meet, since they were contractually bound to different bowl games. The coalition also excluded the Rose Bowl, arguably the most prestigious game in the nation, and two major conferences\u2014the Pac-10 and Big Ten\u2014meaning that it had limited success. In 1995, the Coalition was replaced by the [[Bowl Alliance]], which reduced the number of bowl games to host a national championship game to three\u2014the [[Fiesta Bowl|Fiesta]], Sugar, and Orange Bowls\u2014and the participating conferences to five\u2014the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]], [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]], [[Southwest Conference|Southwest]], [[Big Eight Conference|Big Eight]], and [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East]]. It was agreed that the No.1 and No.2 ranked teams gave up their prior bowl tie-ins and were guaranteed to meet in the national championship game, which rotated between the three participating bowls. The system still did not include the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]], [[Pacific-10 Conference|Pac-10]], or the [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]], and thus still lacked the legitimacy of a true national championship.<ref name=hickok1/><ref name=BCS>{{cite web | title = BCS Chronology | publisher=FOX Sports on MSN | year = 2006 | url = http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/history | accessdate =2007-06-01|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070915010233/http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/history |archivedate = September 15, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==== Bowl Championship Series (1998\u20132013) ====\n{{Main article|Bowl Championship Series}}\n{{See also|NCAA Division I Football Championship}}\nIn 1998, a new system was put into place called the Bowl Championship Series. For the first time, it included all major conferences (ACC, Big East, Big 12, Big Ten, Pac-10, and SEC) and all four major bowl games (Rose, Orange, Sugar and Fiesta). The champions of these six conferences, along with two \"at-large\" selections, were invited to play in the four bowl games. Each year, one of the four bowl games served as a national championship game. Also, a complex system of human polls, computer rankings, and strength of schedule calculations was instituted to rank schools. Based on this ranking system, the No.1 and No.2 teams met each year in the national championship game. Traditional tie-ins were maintained for schools and bowls not part of the national championship. For example, in years when not a part of the national championship, the Rose Bowl still hosted the Big Ten and Pac-10 champions.<ref name=BCS/>\n\nThe system continued to change, as the formula for ranking teams was tweaked from year to year. At-large teams could be chosen from any of the [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] conferences, though only one selection\u2014[[2004 Utah Utes football team|Utah]] in 2005\u2014came from a non-BCS affiliated conference. Starting with the 2006 season, a fifth game\u2014simply called the [[BCS National Championship Game]]\u2014was added to the schedule, to be played at the site of one of the four BCS bowl games on a rotating basis, one week after the regular bowl game. This opened up the BCS to two additional at-large teams. Also, rules were changed to add the champions of five additional conferences ([[Conference USA]], the [[Mid-American Conference]], the [[Mountain West Conference]], the [[Sun Belt Conference]] and the [[Western Athletic Conference]]), provided that said champion ranked in the top twelve in the final BCS rankings, or was within the top 16 of the BCS rankings and ranked higher than the champion of at least one of the [[Power Five conferences|\"BCS conferences\"]] (also known as \"AQ\" conferences, for Automatic Qualifying).<ref name=BCS/> Several times since this rule change was implemented, schools from non-AQ conferences played in BCS bowl games. In 2009, [[2009 Boise State Broncos football team|Boise State]] played [[2009 TCU Horned Frogs football team|TCU]] in the [[2010 Fiesta Bowl|Fiesta Bowl]], the first time two schools from non-BCS conferences played each other in a BCS bowl game. The final team from the non-AQ ranks to reach a BCS bowl game was [[2012 Northern Illinois Huskies football team|Northern Illinois in 2012]], which played in (and lost) the [[2013 Orange Bowl]].\n\n==== College Football Playoff (2014\u2013present) ====\n{{Main article|College Football Playoff}}\nDue to the intensification of the [[College football playoff debate]] after more than a decade of the sometimes disputable results of the BCS, the conference commissioners and Notre Dame's president voted to implement a [[Plus-One system]] which was to be called the College Football Playoff.  The CFP is the annual postseason tournament for the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) and just as its predecessors, has failed to receive sanctioning from the NCAA.  The playoff began with the [[2014 NCAA Division I FBS football season]].<ref name=McMurphy>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/9204021/football-playoff-name-site|title=Football playoff has name and site|last=McMurphy|first=Brett|date=April 24, 2013|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=April 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe CFP system is centered on six major bowl games played on or near New Year's Day, often called the \"New Year's Six\". Three pairs of games rotate annually as hosts of CFP semifinals. The champions of the so-called [[Power Five conferences]] (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12, SEC) all receive guaranteed berths in one of the New Year's Six games, though not necessarily in the CFP semifinals. [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]], a football [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|independent]] but otherwise an ACC member, has its own arrangement for access to the New Year's Six should it meet specified criteria. A selection committee similar to those used by the [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process|NCAA basketball tournaments for men and women]] releases a weekly ranking concurrently with the [[AP Poll]] starting with the Monday after Week 10 of the season. After the completion of the regular season, the committee selects the four teams that will compete in the CFP semifinals and the at-large entries to the New Year's Six games. One of the at-large entries is reserved for the top-ranking champion of the so-called \"Group of Five\" conferences ([[American Athletic Conference|American]], [[Conference USA]], [[Mid-American Conference|MAC]], [[Mountain West Conference|Mountain West]], [[Sun Belt Conference|Sun Belt]]).

Marshall, however, was likely not the only reason: the [[Great Depression]] had stoked an increase in racism and self-inflicted segregation across the country, and internal politics likely had as much of an effect as external pressure.<ref name=\"hof\"/> Marshall's hostility was specifically directed at the black race; he openly allowed (and promoted) Native Americans on his team, including his first head coach, [[Lone Star Dietz]], widely believed to be a Native American at the time.

That same year, [[Dallas]], Texas businessman [[Lamar Hunt]] led the formation of the rival [[American Football League]], the fourth such league to bear that name, with war hero and former South Dakota Governor [[Joe Foss]] as its Commissioner. Unlike the earlier rival leagues, and bolstered by television exposure, the AFL posed a significant threat to NFL dominance of the professional football world. In 1960, the AFL began play with eight teams and a double round-robin schedule of fourteen games. New NFL commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] took office the same year.<ref name=NFL1951/> The AFL generally avoided placing teams in markets where they directly competed with established NFL franchises. Although four inaugural AFL teams shared markets with NFL teams\u2014the [[Kansas City Chiefs|Dallas Texans]], [[San Diego Chargers|Los Angeles Chargers]], [[New York Jets|Titans of New York]], and [[Oakland Raiders]] (the latter sharing the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] with the [[San Francisco 49ers]])\u2014only the franchises in New York (renamed the New York Jets) and Oakland remained in direct competition with NFL teams after the league's early years.

The AFL worked hard to secure top college players, many from sources virtually untapped by the established league: small colleges and [[Historically black colleges and universities|predominantly black colleges]]. Two of the eight coaches of the [[Foolish Club|Original Eight]] AFL franchises, [[Hank Stram]] ([[Kansas City Chiefs|Texans/Chiefs]]) and [[Sid Gillman]] ([[San Diego Chargers|Chargers]]) eventually were inducted to the Hall of Fame. Led by [[Oakland Raiders]] owner and AFL commissioner [[Al Davis]], the AFL established a \"war chest\" to entice top talent with higher pay than they got from the NFL. Former Green Bay Packers quarterback [[Babe Parilli]] became a star for the [[Boston Patriots]] during the early years of the AFL, and University of Alabama passer [[Joe Namath]] rejected the NFL to play for the [[New York Jets]]. Namath became the face of the league as it reached its height of popularity in the mid-1960s. Davis's methods worked, and in 1966, the junior league forced a partial merger with the NFL. The two leagues agreed to have a common [[NFL Draft|draft]] and play in a common season-ending championship game, known as the AFL-NFL World Championship. Two years later, the game's name was changed to the [[Super Bowl]].<ref name=NFL1961>{{cite web | title = NFL History 1961\u20131970 | work=NFL.com | publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC | year = 2007 | url = http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1961-1970 | accessdate =2007-06-26}}</ref><ref name=AFL>{{cite web | title = Remember the AFL | publisher=American Football League Hall of Fame | year = 2003 | url =http://www.remembertheafl.com/AFL.htm | accessdate =2007-06-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = History of the Super Bowl | publisher=SuperNFL.com | url = http://www.supernfl.com/SuperBowl/SuperBowlHistory.html | accessdate =2007-06-26| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070608100947/http://www.supernfl.com/SuperBowl/SuperBowlHistory.html| archivedate = June 8, 2007}}</ref>\nAFL teams won the next two Super Bowls, and in 1970, the two leagues [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merged]] to form a new 26-team league.

In 1974, the [[World Football League]] formed and was able to attract such stars as [[Larry Csonka]] away from the NFL with lucrative contracts. However, most of the WFL franchises were insolvent and the league folded in 1975; the [[Memphis Southmen]], the team that had signed Csonka and the most financially stable of the teams, unsuccessfully sued to join the NFL. The [[American Football Association (1979&ndash;1982)|American Football Association]] formed as a continuation of the WFL's legacy in 1978, albeit on a much lower pay scale. That league lasted until 1982.\n\nIn 1970, [[Patricia Palinkas]] became the first woman to ever play on a men's semipro football team when she joined the Orlando Panthers.  In 1974, the [[National Women's Football League]] was founded, starting play with 7 teams.  By the mid-1970s, the average NWFL franchise entry fee was $10,000.  The Toledo Troopers had a record from 1971 through 1976 of 39 wins, 1 loss and 1 tie, but folded in 1980 due to financial problems.  The NWFL took a year off to restructure in 1987, but by the next year the league had split in two, with the remnants of the NWFL based in Toledo and the new Women's Tackle Football Association based in Grand Rapids, Michigan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/sports/womenfootball/nwflhistory.html|title=A History of Women in Tackle Football|website=www.angelfire.com|accessdate=May 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, the [[United States Football League]] formed as a spring league, and enjoyed moderate success during its first two seasons behind such stars as [[Jim Kelly]] and [[Herschel Walker]]. It intended to move its schedule to the fall in 1986, and tried to compete with the NFL directly, but despite winning an anti-trust suit against the older league the USFL was only awarded token damages, depriving the league of the funds it needed to stay solvent. The USFL ceased operations a month before its first fall season was to begin.\n\nThe NFL founded a developmental league known as the [[World League of American Football]] with teams based in the United States, Canada, and Europe. The WLAF ran for two years, from 1991 to 1992. The league went on a two-year hiatus before reorganizing as [[NFL Europa|NFL Europe]] in 1995, with teams only in European cities. The name of the league was changed to NFL Europa in 2006. After the 2007 season, the NFL announced that it was closing down the league to focus its international marketing efforts in other ways, such as playing NFL regular season games in cities outside of the U.S.<ref>{{cite web | title = NFL Europe homepage | url = http://www.nfleurope.com/ | year = 2007 | publisher=World League Licensing LLC | accessdate =2007-07-02}}</ref>\n\nShort-lived leagues such as the [[Regional Football League]] and [[Spring Football League]] formed in the wake of the [[dot-com boom]] but evaporated in short order after the boom ended.\n\nIn 2001, the [[XFL (2001)|XFL]] was formed as a joint venture between the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] and the NBC television network. It folded after one season in the face of rapidly declining fan interest and a poor reputation.

{"title_page": "Shirazi Turk", "text_new": "{{short description|14th-century poem by Hafez}}\n{{italic title}}\n'''''Shirazi Turk''''' is a ''[[ghazal]] (love poem)'' by the 14th-century Persian poet [[Hafez|H\u0101fez]] of [[Shiraz]]. It has been described as \"the most familiar of Hafez's poems in the English-speaking world\".<ref>Hillmann (1975), p. 164.</ref> It was the first poem of Hafez to appear in English,<ref>Loloi (2002).</ref> when [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] made his paraphrase \"A Persian Song\" in 1771, based on a Latin version supplied by his friend [[K\u00e1roly Reviczky]].  [[Edward Granville Browne]] wrote of this poem: \"I cannot find so many English verse-renderings of any other of the odes of \u1e24\u00e1fi\u1e93.\"<ref>Browne (1920), vol. 3, p. 304.</ref> It is the third poem in the collection (''[[Diwan (poetry)|d\u012bv\u0101n]]'') of Hafez's poems, which are arranged alphabetically by their rhymes.\n\nMore recently this ode has inspired a number of scholarly articles and some controversy. Should it be taken at face value, as a poem in which the poet describes his unrequited love for a handsome youth, and turns to wine as a consolation? Or does it also conceal a hidden [[Sufism|Sufi]] meaning describing the path of Love leading to union with God? Is the Turk male or female? Was he or she a real person or an imaginary one? Another topic that has been discussed is whether the poem is coherent, or whether it fails to have a unified theme.\n\nIn the century after Hafez's death, a famous anecdote was told of how the Mongol conqueror [[Timur]] (Tamerlane) met Hafez and criticised him for writing so disrespectfully of Bokhara and Samarkand in this poem. This story first appears in a work called ''Anis al-Nas'' by Shoja' Shirazi (1426),<ref>Ingenito (2018), p. 11.</ref> and it was elaborated on in a collection of biographies of poets (''Tazker\u0101t a\u0161-\u0160o'ar\u0101'') completed in 1486 by [[Dawlatshah Samarqandi]]. If this meeting took place, which is not certain, it must have been during Tamerlane's first visit to Shiraz in 1387, two years before Hafez's death.<ref>Browne (1920), vol. 3, pp. 188, 282.</ref>\n\nIt has been argued that the poem is likely to have been written after 1370, when Tamerlane began to develop Samarkand and make it famous as his capital.<ref>Ingenito (2018), p. 12.</ref> If so, it was probably written later in Hafez's life, since in 1370 he was 53 or 55.\n\n==The poem==\nThe transliteration given here is based on that approved by the United Nations in 2012, which represents the current pronunciation of educated speakers in Iran, except that to make scansion easier, the long vowels are marked with a macron (\u0101, \u0113, \u012b, \u014d, \u016b).<ref>''[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/UNGEGN/docs/10th-uncsgn-docs/econf/E_CONF.101_118_Rev.1_Transcription%20symbols%20for%20Persian_Updated.pdf New Persian Romanization System.

The version given above is that of Muhammad Qazvini and Qasem Ghani (1941).<ref>Hillmann (1975), p. 179</ref><ref>There is now a new critical edition of Hafez by Parviz Natel-Khanlari (1980, revised 1984); cf. Khorramshahi, Baha\u02be-al-Din and Ehsan Yarshater (2002, rev. 2012), [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hafez-vi \"Printed editions of the Div\u0101n of Hafez\"], ''Encyclopaedia Iranica''.</ref> However, of ten manuscripts examined by Mas'ud Farzaad, in fact only two have the above text.<ref>Bashiri (1979).</ref> \n\nNine of the ten manuscripts agree on the order of verses 1\u20135 and 9. But concerning verses 6\u20138 there is more disagreement. One manuscript has the order 1, 2, 7, 6, 3, 9, omitting 4, 5 and 8. Another manuscript omits verses 6 and 7. In the other manuscripts verses 6, 7, and 8 are found in various orders: 7, 8, 6; 8, 7, 6; and 6, 8, 7. \n\nBashiri (1979) argued that verses 6 and 7 are interpolations, and Rehder (1974) suggested that one or both of verses 4 and 8 might be spurious.<ref>Pritchett (1993), p. 128.</ref>\n\nEight of the manuscripts have a different version of verse 6 (see below). \n\n==A Sufic interpretation?==\nThe practice of [[Sufism]] (Islamic mysticism) was widespread in Iran during these centuries and greatly influenced Persian poetry.<ref>Pourjavady (2000).</ref> However, how far this poem of Hafez is to be taken in a mystical sense is disputed. One of those who interpreted it mystically is Clarke (1895), who explains that the Turk symbolises God, Samarkand and Bukhara signify this world and the next, the wine is the mysteries of love, and so on.<ref>Clarke, p. 40.</ref> \n\nHowever, not all scholars see a mystical interpretation in this poem. Gertrude Bell, for example, in her ''Poems from the Divan of Hafiz'' (1897), p. 129, wrote: \n\n:\"The whole poem has received a mystical interpretation which seems to me to add but little to its value or to its intelligibility.\"\n\nE. G. Browne in volume 3 of his ''Literary History of Persia'' wrote:<ref>Browne (1920), p. 299.</ref>\n\n:\"That many of the odes are to be taken in symbolic and mystical sense, few will deny; that others mean what they say, and celebrate a beauty not celestial and a wine not allegorical can hardly be questioned.\"\n\nSimilarly in the 16th century, the Turkish commentator on Hafez, [[Ahmed Sudi]], adopted a literal approach to Hafez's poetry, rejecting the excessively mystical interpretations of his predecessors S\u00fcruri and \u015eem\u02bfi.<ref>Inan (2018), pp. 277\u20138.</ref>\n\nThe ruler of Shiraz in Hafez's time, Shah Shoja', also found both aspects, spiritual and worldly, in Hafez's poems. He is said to have complained that Hafez's poetry was \"at one moment mystical, at another erotic and bacchanalian; now serious and spiritual, and again flippant and worldly\".<ref>Browne (1920), p. 281.</ref> Many modern commentators agree with Browne and Bell,<ref>Lewis (2002).</ref> and the majority accept the ode at its face value. \n\n[[Iraj Bashiri]] on the other hand argues strongly for a Sufic interpretation of this poem.<ref>Bashiri (1979).</ref> He compares this poem with another of Hafez's ghazals, ''[[S\u012bne m\u0101l\u0101m\u0101l]]'' (\"My heart is brimful of pain\"), which is more obviously Sufic in character. According to Bashiri, both poems describe the seven stages of Love an initiate must go through to achieve union with the Divine (loss of heart, regret, ecstasy, loss of patience, loss of consciousness, loss of mind, annihilation). \n\nBashiri also draws attention to certain apparent astronomical references: the Sun (which was sometimes known as ''Tork-e falak'' \"the Turk of the firmament\"), Saturn (sometimes referred to as ''Hend\u016b-ye \u010darx'' \"the Indian of the sky\"),<ref>[https://www.vajehyab.com/?q=%D9%87%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%88%DB%8C+%DA%86%D8%B1%D8%AE Dehkhoda's Dictionary].</ref> Venus and other bright planets (''L\u016bl\u012by\u0101n''), the seven planets (''Torkan''), the Pleiades (''Sorayy\u0101''), and the firmament itself (''falak''), all of which can be given Sufic meanings. His interpretation is at odds with that of Hillmann, who dismisses Bashiri's article as unscholarly.<ref>Hillmann (1980).</ref>\n\nHowever, even Hillmann acknowledges<ref>Hillmann (1975), p. 173.</ref> that in this poem there is a certain ambivalence \u2013 the ambiguity or ''\u012bh\u0101m'' for which Hafez is famous. \"The allusion to Joseph and Zulaykha may seem to some to be wholly in the spiritual area of the spectrum, whereas the minstrel-and-wine image in bayt 8 and the self-praise in bayt 9 perhaps can be taken only as part of the physical world.\" The question of the intent of the poem therefore is open to interpretation, some scholars taking it wholly as a physical description of love, others like Arberry as a \"grand philosophical utterance\".<ref>Hillmann (1975), p. 173.</ref>\n\n==Gender of the Turk==\nWhether the Turk is male or female is not expressed grammatically in Persian. Many of the earliest translators of this poem all translated it as though the Turk were female, beginning with William Jones, whose version begins: \"Sweet maid, if thou wouldst charm my sight...\".<ref>Arberry (1946).</ref> Herman Bicknell (1875) is an exception, writing \"If that Shir\u00e2zian Turk would deign to take my heart within his hand, To make his Indian mole my own, I'd give Bokh\u00e1ra and Samar\u1e33and.\"<ref>Bicknell (1875), p. 20.</ref>\n\nIn fact, although in the great Persian narrative epics and romances the love interest was always female, there was also a long tradition of love poetry in both Arabic<ref>Bauer (2014).</ref> and Persian in which, in the great majority of cases, the person whose beauty was praised was male.<ref name=EIr>EIr (2004).</ref> Among the Persian poets who wrote love poems of this kind were [[Farrukhi Sistani|Farrokhi]] (11th century), [[Manuchehri]] (11th century), [[Sanai]] (12th century), [[Anvari]] (12th century), [[Fakhr-al-Din Iraqi|Iraqi]] (13th century), [[Saadi Shirazi|Saadi]] (13th century) and [[Awhadi Maraghai|Awhadi]] (14th century).

However, there are some exceptions. Leonard Lewisohn, with reference to the Beloved, writes: \"Gender is always ambiguous in Persian, but in Hafiz\u2019s verse the Witness is nearly always female\".<ref>Lewisohn (2010), p. 48.</ref>\n\nAnother question is whether the Turk in this poem was really Turkish, and a real person, or simply a poetic invention. The 16th-century Bosnian-Turkish commentator on Hafez, [[Ahmed Sudi]] wrote:<ref>Inan (2018), pp. 284\u20135.</ref> \n\n:\"Turk: the word originally means the [[Tatars|Tatar]] people. Since Tatars are known as cruel, merciless and bloody people, Persian poets metaphorically compare their beloveds to them. And this is why these poets call their beloveds 'Turks'.\" \n\nBut Sudi also reports another theory: \n:\"Some people from Shiraz say that many soldiers in [the Mongol ruler] [[Hulagu Khan|Hulagu]]\u2019s army made the city of Shiraz their home and lived there for successive generations. So, literally speaking, it is not incorrect to call their descendants 'Turks of Shiraz'.\"\n\nA suggestion by Hafez's editor [[Qasem Ghani]] that the Turk might have been the son of [[Shah Shoja Mozaffari|Shah Shoja']], one of the rulers of the time, is dismissed as \"improbable\" by Hillmann in view of the fact that \"Turk\" usually simply means \"beloved\" and that the phrase had already been used by Saadi.<ref>Hillmann (1975), p. 180.</ref>\n\n==Notes on individual verses==\nArberry (1946) points out that most of the features of this ode are traditional stock motifs from Persian love poetry, and he quotes some lines of Saadi where the same themes recur.\n\n===Verse 1===\nThe ''x\u0101l-e Hend\u016b'' (\"mole of an Indian\" i.e. dark in colour) was regarded as a symbol of beauty on the face of the beloved. The phrase also appears in a ''ghazal'' of Saadi, quoted by Arberry, in which Saadi contrasts the darkness of the mole with the paleness of the beloved's face:<ref>[https://ganjoor.net/saadi/divan/ghazals/sh479/ Saadi, ''ghazal'' 479], verse 9; cf.

There is another internal rhyme in verse 9 of this poem: {{lang|fa-Latn|qazal goft\u012b o dor soft\u012b}}.

The phrase {{lang|fa-Latn|x\u0101l o xatt}} (or {{lang|fa-Latn|xatt o x\u0101l}}) is frequent in the poets, as in the following line of Hafez:<ref>[https://ganjoor.net/hafez/ghazal/sh89/ Hafez, ''ghazal'' 89], verse 3.</ref>\n\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0641\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u0634\u0634 \u062c\u0647\u062a\u0645 \u0631\u0627\u0647 \u0628\u0628\u0633\u062a\u0646\u062f}}\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0622\u0646 \u062e\u0627\u0644 \u0648 \u062e\u0637 \u0648 \u0632\u0644\u0641 \u0648 \u0631\u062e \u0648 \u0639\u0627\u0631\u0636 \u0648 \u0642\u0627\u0645\u062a}}\n\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|far<u>y\u0101d</u> ke 'az \u0161e\u0161 jahat-am <u>r\u0101h</u> bebastand}}\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|\u0101n x\u0101l o xat \u014d zolf o rox \u014d '\u0101rez o q\u0101mat}}\n\n:Alas! for they have blocked my way from six directions:\n:that mole and down, and hair and face, and cheek and stature.\n\n===Verse 5===\nIn verse 5, reference is made to the Qur'anic/Biblical story of Joseph and Potiphar's wife, who in Islamic tradition is called Zulaykh\u0101. Those who interpret this poem non-mystically do not give a satisfactory motivation for this verse. However, in Sufism, the story was widely used as an example. John Renard writes:<ref>Renard (2009), p. 260.</ref> \n:\"Sufi poets developed the character's personality well beyond the scriptural stories, understanding her as a type of the lover of God who loses her wits in the presence of the divine Beauty.

Arberry writes of the last verse: \"The 'clasp' theme here used is a very common one, but its present treatment is scarcely surpassed for beauty in the whole ''D\u012bv\u0101n''.\"<ref>Arberry (1946), p. 707.</ref> Hillmann writes: \"A first impression of the 'Turk of Shiraz' is of a texture of [[hyperbole]], [[paradox]], a sense of the ultimate or perfection, eloquence, and seriousness, with familiar images and conceits given new vitality through new combination and given form by means of verse patterning.\"<ref>Hillmann (1975), p. 167.</ref>\n\nSome critics, however, have questioned the coherence or unity of the poem, beginning with William Jones's friend and tutor in Persian, Count [[K\u00e1roly Reviczky]], who wrote in 1768 \"I did not translate the poem into Latin verse, on account of the incoherence of the verses\". Jones himself in his version used the phrase \"Like orient pearls at random strung\".<ref>Arberry (1946), p. 703.</ref> The chief critic in this area is Hillmann, who wrote: \"One might conclude that the \"Turk of Shiraz\" is not a wholly successful poem precisely because it seems lacking in unity, no other aspect or feature of the ghazal having been demonstrated to compensate for this lack.\"<ref> Hillmann (1975), p. 175.</ref>\n\nDefending the poem from such criticism, Arberry finds only two themes in it: \"The principal theme is \u2013 the fair charmer, beautiful, proud, unapproachable, the human, this-worldly reflection of the immortal loveliness of the Divine spirit. ... The subsidiary theme is \u2013 wine (and music) are the sole consolation of the lover, to compensate his sorrow over the incapacity of his love, and the transitory nature of mundane affairs.\"<ref>Arberry (1946), p. 706.</ref> He scorns the idea that the poem has no unity. Rehder finds that rather than thematic unity, the poem has \"an obvious unity of thought and mood\".<ref>Rehder (1974), quoted by Pritchett (1993), p. 121.</ref>\n\n==Further reading==\n* Arberry, A.

It has been described as \"the most familiar of Hafez's poems in the English-speaking world\".<ref>Hillmann (1975), p. 164.</ref> It was the first poem of Hafez to appear in English,<ref>Loloi (2002).</ref> when [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] made his paraphrase \"A Persian Song\" in 1771, based on a Latin version supplied by his friend [[K\u00e1roly Reviczky]].  [[Edward Granville Browne]] wrote of this poem: \"I cannot find so many English verse-renderings of any other of the odes of \u1e24\u00e1fi\u1e93.\"<ref>Browne (1920), vol. 3, p. 304.</ref> It is the third poem in the collection (''[[Diwan (poetry)|d\u012bv\u0101n]]'') of Hafez's poems, which are arranged alphabetically by their rhymes.\n\nMore recently this ode has inspired a number of scholarly articles and some controversy. Should it be taken at face value, as a poem in which the poet describes his unrequited love for a handsome youth, and turns to wine as a consolation? Or does it also conceal a hidden [[Sufism|Sufi]] meaning describing the path of Love leading to union with God? Is the Turk male or female? Was he or she a real person or an imaginary one? Another topic that has been discussed is whether the poem is coherent, or whether it fails to have a unified theme.\n\nIn the century after Hafez's death, a famous anecdote was told of how the Mongol conqueror [[Timur]] (Tamerlane) met Hafez and criticised him for writing so disrespectfully of Bokhara and Samarkand in this poem. This story first appears in a work called ''Anis al-Nas'' by Shoja' Shirazi (1426),<ref>Ingenito (2018), p. 11.</ref> and it was elaborated on in a collection of biographies of poets (''Tazker\u0101t a\u0161-\u0160o'ar\u0101'') completed in 1486 by [[Dawlatshah Samarqandi]]. If this meeting took place, which is not certain, it must have been during Tamerlane's first visit to Shiraz in 1387, two years before Hafez's death.<ref>Browne (1920), vol. 3, pp. 188, 282.</ref>\n\nIt has been argued that the poem is likely to have been written after 1370, when Tamerlane began to develop Samarkand and make it famous as his capital.<ref>Ingenito (2018), p. 12.</ref> If so, it was probably written later in Hafez's life, since in 1370 he was 53 or 55.\n\n==The poem==\nThe transliteration given here is based on that approved by the United Nations in 2012, which represents the current pronunciation of educated speakers in Iran, except that to make scansion easier, the long vowels are marked with a macron (\u0101, \u0113, \u012b, \u014d, \u016b).<ref>''[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/geoinfo/UNGEGN/docs/10th-uncsgn-docs/econf/E_CONF.101_118_Rev.1_Transcription%20symbols%20for%20Persian_Updated.pdf New Persian Romanization System.

The version given above is that of Muhammad Qazvini and Qasem Ghani (1941).<ref>Hillmann (1975), p. 179</ref><ref>There is now a new critical edition of Hafez by Parviz Natel-Khanlari (1980, revised 1984); cf. Khorramshahi, Baha\u02be-al-Din and Ehsan Yarshater (2002, rev. 2012), [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hafez-vi \"Printed editions of the Div\u0101n of Hafez\"], ''Encyclopaedia Iranica''.</ref> However, of ten manuscripts examined by Mas'ud Farzaad, in fact only two have the above text.<ref>Bashiri (1979).</ref> \n\nNine of the ten manuscripts agree on the order of verses 1\u20135 and 9. But concerning verses 6\u20138 there is more disagreement. One manuscript has the order 1, 2, 7, 6, 3, 9, omitting 4, 5 and 8. Another manuscript omits verses 6 and 7. In the other manuscripts verses 6, 7, and 8 are found in various orders: 7, 8, 6; 8, 7, 6; and 6, 8, 7. \n\nBashiri (1979) argued that verses 6 and 7 are interpolations, and Rehder (1974) suggested that one or both of verses 4 and 8 might be spurious.<ref>Pritchett (1993), p. 128.</ref>\n\nEight of the manuscripts have a different version of verse 6 (see below). \n\n==A Sufic interpretation?==\nThe practice of [[Sufism]] (Islamic mysticism) was widespread in Iran during these centuries and greatly influenced Persian poetry.<ref>Pourjavady (2000).</ref> However, how far this poem of Hafez is to be taken in a mystical sense is disputed. One of those who interpreted it mystically is Clarke (1895), who explains that the Turk symbolises God, Samarkand and Bukhara signify this world and the next, the wine is the mysteries of love, and so on.<ref>Clarke, p. 40.</ref> \n\nHowever, not all scholars see a mystical interpretation in this poem. Gertrude Bell, for example, in her ''Poems from the Divan of Hafiz'' (1897), p. 129, wrote: \n\n:\"The whole poem has received a mystical interpretation which seems to me to add but little to its value or to its intelligibility.\"\n\nE. G. Browne in volume 3 of his ''Literary History of Persia'' wrote:<ref>Browne (1920), p. 299.</ref>\n\n:\"That many of the odes are to be taken in symbolic and mystical sense, few will deny; that others mean what they say, and celebrate a beauty not celestial and a wine not allegorical can hardly be questioned.\"\n\nSimilarly in the 16th century, the Turkish commentator on Hafez, [[Ahmed Sudi]], adopted a literal approach to Hafez's poetry, rejecting the excessively mystical interpretations of his predecessors S\u00fcruri and \u015eem\u02bfi.<ref>Inan (2018), pp. 277\u20138.</ref>\n\nThe ruler of Shiraz in Hafez's time, Shah Shoja', also found both aspects, spiritual and worldly, in Hafez's poems. He is said to have complained that Hafez's poetry was \"at one moment mystical, at another erotic and bacchanalian; now serious and spiritual, and again flippant and worldly\".<ref>Browne (1920), p. 281.</ref> Many modern commentators agree with Browne and Bell,<ref>Lewis (2002).</ref> and the majority accept the ode at its face value. \n\n[[Iraj Bashiri]] on the other hand argues strongly for a Sufic interpretation of this poem.<ref>Bashiri (1979).</ref> He compares this poem with another of Hafez's ghazals, ''[[S\u012bne m\u0101l\u0101m\u0101l]]'' (\"My heart is brimful of pain\"), which is more obviously Sufic in character. According to Bashiri, both poems describe the seven stages of Love an initiate must go through to achieve union with the Divine (loss of heart, regret, ecstasy, loss of patience, loss of consciousness, loss of mind, annihilation). \n\nBashiri also draws attention to certain apparent astronomical references: the Sun (which was sometimes known as ''Tork-e falak'' \"the Turk of the firmament\"), Saturn (sometimes referred to as ''Hend\u016b-ye \u010darx'' \"the Indian of the sky\"),<ref>[https://www.vajehyab.com/?q=%D9%87%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%88%DB%8C+%DA%86%D8%B1%D8%AE Dehkhoda's Dictionary].</ref> Venus and other bright planets (''L\u016bl\u012by\u0101n''), the seven planets (''Torkan''), the Pleiades (''Sorayy\u0101''), and the firmament itself (''falak''), all of which can be given Sufic meanings. His interpretation is at odds with that of Hillmann, who dismisses Bashiri's article as unscholarly.<ref>Hillmann (1980).</ref>\n\nHowever, even Hillmann acknowledges<ref>Hillmann (1975), p. 173.</ref> that in this poem there is a certain ambivalence \u2013 the ambiguity or ''\u012bh\u0101m'' for which Hafez is famous. \"The allusion to Joseph and Zulaykha may seem to some to be wholly in the spiritual area of the spectrum, whereas the minstrel-and-wine image in bayt 8 and the self-praise in bayt 9 perhaps can be taken only as part of the physical world.\" The question of the intent of the poem therefore is open to interpretation, some scholars taking it wholly as a physical description of love, others like Arberry as a \"grand philosophical utterance\".<ref>Hillmann (1975), p. 173.</ref>\n\n==Gender of the Turk==\nWhether the Turk is male or female is not expressed grammatically in Persian. Many of the earliest translators of this poem all translated it as though the Turk were female, beginning with William Jones, whose version begins: \"Sweet maid, if thou wouldst charm my sight...\".<ref>Arberry (1946).</ref> Herman Bicknell (1875) is an exception, writing \"If that Shir\u00e2zian Turk would deign to take my heart within his hand, To make his Indian mole my own, I'd give Bokh\u00e1ra and Samar\u1e33and.\"<ref>Bicknell (1875), p. 20.</ref>\n\nIn fact, although in the great Persian narrative epics and romances the love interest was always female, there was also a long tradition of love poetry in both Arabic<ref>Bauer (2014).</ref> and Persian in which, in the great majority of cases, the person whose beauty was praised was male.<ref name=EIr>EIr (2004).</ref> Among the Persian poets who wrote love poems of this kind were [[Farrukhi Sistani|Farrokhi]] (11th century), [[Manuchehri]] (11th century), [[Sanai]] (12th century), [[Anvari]] (12th century), [[Fakhr-al-Din Iraqi|Iraqi]] (13th century), [[Saadi Shirazi|Saadi]] (13th century) and [[Awhadi Maraghai|Awhadi]] (14th century). Often the object of the poet's admiration was described as a \"Turk\" (Turks were supposed to be especially good-looking),<ref>Browne (1920), p. 228.</ref> as in the couplet below from a ''[[qasida]]'' of Manuchehri (see [[The Turkish harpist (Manuchehri)]]):<ref>Manuchehri, [https://ganjoor.net/manoochehri/divanm/ghaside-ghete/sh39/ qaside 39].</ref> \n\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0628\u06cc\u0646\u06cc \u0622\u0646 \u062a\u0631\u06a9\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u0648 \u0686\u0648\u0646 \u0628\u0631\u0632\u0646\u062f \u0628\u0631 \u0686\u0646\u06af\u060c \u0686\u0646\u06af}}\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0627\u0632 \u062f\u0644 \u0627\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0644 \u0628\u06af\u0631\u06cc\u0632\u062f \u0628\u0647 \u0635\u062f \u0641\u0631\u0633\u0646\u06af\u060c \u0633\u0646\u06af}}\n\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|b\u012bni \u0101n Tork-\u012b ke \u016b \u010don barzanad bar <u>\u010dang</u> \u010dang}}\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|az del-\u0113 abd\u0101l begr\u012bzad be sad far<u>sang</u> sang}}\n\n:Do you see that Turk, who when he places his hand ({{lang|fa-Latn|\u010dang}}) on the harp ({{lang|fa-Latn|\u010dang}}),\n:from the heart of devotees, a stone flees for a hundred [[league (unit)|leagues]]?\n\nSaadi, who like Hafez was from Shiraz, used the phrase \"Shirazi Turk\" a century before Hafez:<ref>[https://ganjoor.net/saadi/divan/ghazals/sh578/ Saadi Ghazal 578 (Ganjur edition), verse 5].</ref><ref>Ingenito, Domenico; in Pfeiffer, Judith (ed.)

Leonard Lewisohn, with reference to the Beloved, writes: \"Gender is always ambiguous in Persian, but in Hafiz\u2019s verse the Witness is nearly always female\".<ref>Lewisohn (2010), p. 48.</ref>\n\nAnother question is whether the Turk in this poem was really Turkish, and a real person, or simply a poetic invention. The 16th-century Bosnian-Turkish commentator on Hafez, [[Ahmed Sudi]] wrote:<ref>Inan (2018), pp. 284\u20135.</ref> \n\n:\"Turk: the word originally means the [[Tatars|Tatar]] people. Since Tatars are known as cruel, merciless and bloody people, Persian poets metaphorically compare their beloveds to them. And this is why these poets call their beloveds 'Turks'.\" \n\nBut Sudi also reports another theory: \n:\"Some people from Shiraz say that many soldiers in [the Mongol ruler] [[Hulagu Khan|Hulagu]]\u2019s army made the city of Shiraz their home and lived there for successive generations. So, literally speaking, it is not incorrect to call their descendants 'Turks of Shiraz'.\"\n\nA suggestion by Hafez's editor [[Qasem Ghani]] that the Turk might have been the son of [[Shah Shoja Mozaffari|Shah Shoja']], one of the rulers of the time, is dismissed as \"improbable\" by Hillmann in view of the fact that \"Turk\" usually simply means \"beloved\" and that the phrase had already been used by Saadi.<ref>Hillmann (1975), p. 180.</ref>\n\n==Notes on individual verses==\nArberry (1946) points out that most of the features of this ode are traditional stock motifs from Persian love poetry, and he quotes some lines of Saadi where the same themes recur.\n\n===Verse 1===\nThe ''x\u0101l-e Hend\u016b'' (\"mole of an Indian\" i.e. dark in colour) was regarded as a symbol of beauty on the face of the beloved. The phrase also appears in a ''ghazal'' of Saadi, quoted by Arberry, in which Saadi contrasts the darkness of the mole with the paleness of the beloved's face:<ref>[https://ganjoor.net/saadi/divan/ghazals/sh479/ Saadi, ''ghazal'' 479], verse 9; cf.

There is another internal rhyme in verse 9 of this poem: {{lang|fa-Latn|qazal goft\u012b o dor soft\u012b}}. Whenever such internal rhymes occur, they almost always coincide with the end of a metrical foot (see [[Persian metres#Internal rhyme]]).<ref>Thiesen, F. (1982), ''A Manual of Classical Persian Prosody'', p. 77.</ref>\n\n===Verse 3===\nConcerning the ''x\u0101n-e yaqm\u0101'' (\"table, or food-cloth, of plunder\"), Herman Bicknell explains: \"In Turkist\u00e1n, if we may believe tradition, there was formerly a military institution called the \"Feast of Plunder,\" at which the soldiers, when their pay-day came, violently carried off dishes of rice, and other dishes placed upon the ground. They were thus reminded that rapine and plunder were their lawful pursuits.\"<ref>Bicknell (1875), pp. 21\u201322.</ref>\n\nThe idea behind this line is that the \"Turk\" (beloved) plunders the heart of the poet, as in this verse of Saadi:<ref>[https://ganjoor.net/saadi/divan/ghazals/sh5/ Saadi, ''ghazal'' 5], verse 10; quoted in Arberry (1946), p. 708.</ref>\n\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u062a\u0648 \u0647\u0645\u0686\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0644 \u0634\u0647\u0631\u06cc \u0628\u0647 \u063a\u0645\u0632\u0647\u200c\u0627\u06cc \u0628\u0628\u0631\u06cc}}\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0646\u06cc \u0633\u0639\u062f \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u06cc\u063a\u0645\u0627 \u0631\u0627}}\n\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|to ham\u010den\u0101n del-e \u0161ahr-\u012b be qamze-'\u012b bebar\u012b}}\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|ke bandeg\u0101n-e ban\u012b <u>Sa'd</u> x\u0101n-e yaqm\u0101-r\u0101}}\n\n:You carry off the heart of a city with a coquettish glance in just the same way\n:as the slaves of the [[Banu Sa'd]] carried off the \"banquet of plunder\".\n\n===Verse 4===\nThe idea that a beautiful face has no need for cosmetics or jewellery is contained in the following verse of Saadi:<ref>[https://ganjoor.net/saadi/divan/ghazals/sh555/ Saadi, ''ghazal'' 555], verse 6; cf.

They are respectively named {{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0633\u0641\u06cc\u062f \u0622\u0628}} and {{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0633\u0631\u062e \u0622\u0628}} (\"{{lang|fa-Latn|saf\u00edd \u00e1b}}\" and \"{{lang|fa-Latn|sorkh \u00e1b}}\")\" (literally, \"white water\" and \"red water\").<ref>Bicknell (1875), p. 22.</ref> He also reports that women in Persia in his day made artificial moles or beauty spots, either permanent by tattooing them, or temporary ones.\n\nHillmann translates {{lang|fa-Latn|xat}} (\"line\") as \"eye-liner (peach-fuzz?)\"<ref>Hillmann (1975), p. 166.</ref> and Windfuhr as \"eyeline\".<ref>Windfuhr (1990), p. 406.</ref> However, the normal meaning of ''xat(t)'' (\"line\") in Persian love poetry is the line of the growing moustache which adorns an adolescent boy's lip.<ref>EIr (2004).</ref> If so, it would refer to an actual physical feature of the face rather than to make-up. The phrase {{lang|fa-Latn|x\u0101l o xatt}} (or {{lang|fa-Latn|xatt o x\u0101l}}) is frequent in the poets, as in the following line of Hafez:<ref>[https://ganjoor.net/hafez/ghazal/sh89/ Hafez, ''ghazal'' 89], verse 3.</ref>\n\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0641\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u0634\u0634 \u062c\u0647\u062a\u0645 \u0631\u0627\u0647 \u0628\u0628\u0633\u062a\u0646\u062f}}\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0622\u0646 \u062e\u0627\u0644 \u0648 \u062e\u0637 \u0648 \u0632\u0644\u0641 \u0648 \u0631\u062e \u0648 \u0639\u0627\u0631\u0636 \u0648 \u0642\u0627\u0645\u062a}}\n\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|far<u>y\u0101d</u> ke 'az \u0161e\u0161 jahat-am <u>r\u0101h</u> bebastand}}\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|\u0101n x\u0101l o xat \u014d zolf o rox \u014d '\u0101rez o q\u0101mat}}\n\n:Alas! for they have blocked my way from six directions:\n:that mole and down, and hair and face, and cheek and stature.\n\n===Verse 5===\nIn verse 5, reference is made to the Qur'anic/Biblical story of Joseph and Potiphar's wife, who in Islamic tradition is called Zulaykh\u0101. Those who interpret this poem non-mystically do not give a satisfactory motivation for this verse. However, in Sufism, the story was widely used as an example. John Renard writes:<ref>Renard (2009), p. 260.</ref> \n:\"Sufi poets developed the character's personality well beyond the scriptural stories, understanding her as a type of the lover of God who loses her wits in the presence of the divine Beauty. Major poets, including [[Jami]] and [[Rumi]], for example, depict her most sympathetically as a \"model\" of the mystical seeker. They emphasise especially that Zulaykh\u0101 was not culpable for her attempted seduction of Joseph, for she was hopelessly under the spell of bewilderment.\"\n\n===Verse 6===\nEight of the manuscripts have a different version of verse 6, namely:\n\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u0628\u062f\u0645 \u06af\u0641\u062a\u06cc \u0648 \u062e\u0631\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0645 \u0639\u0641\u0627\u06a9 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u06a9\u0631\u0645 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u06cc}}\n:{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|\u06a9\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u062a\u0644\u062e \u0645\u06cc \u0632\u06cc\u0628\u062f \u0644\u0628 \u0644\u0639\u0644 \u0634\u06a9\u0631 \u062e\u0627 \u0631\u0627}}\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|bad-am goft\u012b o xorsand-am; * 'af\u0101kall\u0101h karam kard\u012b!}}\n:{{lang|fa-Latn|kal\u0101m-\u0113 <u>talx</u> m\u012bz\u012bbad * lab-\u0113 la'l-\u0113 \u0161ekarx\u0101-r\u0101}}\n:\"You spoke harshly to me and I am pleased; God bless you, you did me a kindness!\n:bitter speech beautifies a ruby-coloured sugar-chewing lip.\"\n\nThe first of these two lines is actually a quotation from a ''[[ghazal]]'' of [[Saadi Shirazi|Saadi]].<ref>[https://ganjoor.net/saadi/divan/ghazals/sh536/ Saadi ghazal 536], verse 3; cf.

Arberry writes of the last verse: \"The 'clasp' theme here used is a very common one, but its present treatment is scarcely surpassed for beauty in the whole ''D\u012bv\u0101n''.\"<ref>Arberry (1946), p. 707.</ref> Hillmann writes: \"A first impression of the 'Turk of Shiraz' is of a texture of [[hyperbole]], [[paradox]], a sense of the ultimate or perfection, eloquence, and seriousness, with familiar images and conceits given new vitality through new combination and given form by means of verse patterning.\"<ref>Hillmann (1975), p. 167.</ref>\n\nSome critics, however, have questioned the coherence or unity of the poem, beginning with William Jones's friend and tutor in Persian, Count [[K\u00e1roly Reviczky]], who wrote in 1768 \"I did not translate the poem into Latin verse, on account of the incoherence of the verses\". Jones himself in his version used the phrase \"Like orient pearls at random strung\".<ref>Arberry (1946), p. 703.</ref> The chief critic in this area is Hillmann, who wrote: \"One might conclude that the \"Turk of Shiraz\" is not a wholly successful poem precisely because it seems lacking in unity, no other aspect or feature of the ghazal having been demonstrated to compensate for this lack.\"<ref> Hillmann (1975), p. 175.</ref>\n\nDefending the poem from such criticism, Arberry finds only two themes in it: \"The principal theme is \u2013 the fair charmer, beautiful, proud, unapproachable, the human, this-worldly reflection of the immortal loveliness of the Divine spirit. ... The subsidiary theme is \u2013 wine (and music) are the sole consolation of the lover, to compensate his sorrow over the incapacity of his love, and the transitory nature of mundane affairs.\"<ref>Arberry (1946), p. 706.</ref> He scorns the idea that the poem has no unity. Rehder finds that rather than thematic unity, the poem has \"an obvious unity of thought and mood\".<ref>Rehder (1974), quoted by Pritchett (1993), p. 121.</ref>\n\n==Further reading==\n* Arberry, A.
