By now the signature Scorsese style was in place: macho posturing, bloody violence, Catholic guilt and redemption, gritty New York locale (though the majority of ''Mean Streets'' was shot in Los Angeles), rapid-fire editing and a soundtrack with contemporary music. Although the film was innovative, its wired atmosphere, edgy documentary style, and gritty street-level direction owed a debt to directors Cassavetes, [[Samuel Fuller]] and early [[Jean-Luc Godard]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A99967-1991Nov24.html |title=Scorsese, Master Of The Rage |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=November 24, 1991 |first=Hal |last=Hinson|access-date=September 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203140433/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A99967-1991Nov24.html|archive-date=December 3, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1974, actress [[Ellen Burstyn]] chose Scorsese to direct her in ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'', for which she won an Academy Award for Best Actress.

Returning to Little Italy to explore his ethnic roots, Scorsese next came up with ''[[Italianamerican]]'', a documentary featuring his parents Charles and Catherine Scorsese.\n\n''[[Taxi Driver]]'' followed in 1976\u2014Scorsese's dark, urban nightmare of one lonely man's gradual descent into insanity.

This tribute to Scorsese's home town and the classic Hollywood musical was a box-office failure. The film was the director's third collaboration with Robert De Niro, co-starring with [[Liza Minnelli]]. The film is best remembered today for the title theme song, which was popularized by [[Frank Sinatra]]. Although possessing Scorsese's usual visual panache and stylistic bravura, many critics felt its enclosed studio-bound atmosphere left it leaden in comparison with his earlier work. Despite its weak reception, the film is regarded positively by some critics. Richard Brody in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote: {{quote|For Scorsese, a lifelong cinephile, the essence of New York could be found in its depiction in classic Hollywood movies.

By this stage the director had  developed a serious [[cocaine]] addiction. However, he did find the creative drive to make the highly regarded ''[[The Last Waltz]]'', documenting the final concert by [[The Band]]. It was held at the [[Winterland Ballroom]] in San Francisco on American Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1976, and featured one of the most extensive lineups of prominent guest performers at a single concert, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[Neil Young]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Paul Butterfield]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Ronnie Wood]], and [[Eric Clapton]]. However, Scorsese's commitments to other projects delayed the release of the film until 1978. Another Scorsese-directed documentary, titled ''[[American Boy: A Profile of Steven Prince|American Boy]]'', also appeared in 1978, focusing on Steven Prince, the cocky gun salesman who appeared in ''Taxi Driver''. A period of wild partying followed, damaging the director's already fragile health. Scorsese helped provide footage for the documentary ''[[Elvis on Tour]]''. Before the end of 1979, Scorsese married actress [[Isabella Rossellini]], and they stayed together for four years until their divorce in 1983.<ref>{{cite news |last=Halpern |first=Dan |title=Interview: Isabella Rossellini \u2013 Daddy's girl |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/may/01/features.features11 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |date=April 30, 2006 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418234306/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/may/01/features.features11 |archivedate=April 18, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== 1980s ===\n\nBy several accounts (Scorsese's included), Robert De Niro practically saved Scorsese's life when he persuaded him to kick his cocaine addiction to make his highly regarded film ''[[Raging Bull]]''.

From this work onwards, Scorsese's films are always labeled as \"A Martin Scorsese Picture\" on promotional material. ''Raging Bull'', filmed in high contrast black and white, is where Scorsese's style reached its zenith: ''Taxi Driver'' and ''New York, New York'' had used elements of [[expressionism]] to replicate psychological points of view, but here the style was taken to new extremes, employing extensive slow-motion, complex tracking shots, and extravagant distortion of perspective (for example, the size of boxing rings would change from fight to fight).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eufs.org.uk/films/raging_bull.html |title=Raging Bull |publisher=Eufs.org.uk |date=March 5, 2001 |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430185450/http://www.eufs.org.uk/films/raging_bull.html |archivedate=April 30, 2009}}</ref> Thematically too, the concerns carried on from ''Mean Streets'' and ''Taxi Driver'': insecure males, violence, guilt, and redemption.\n\n\nAlthough the screenplay for ''Raging Bull'' was credited to Paul Schrader and [[Mardik Martin]] (who earlier co-wrote ''Mean Streets''), the finished script differed extensively from Schrader's original draft.

This led to a more significant acting appearance in [[Bertrand Tavernier]]'s [[jazz]] film ''[[Round Midnight (film)|Round Midnight]]''. He also made a brief venture into television, directing an episode of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]''.\n\nWith ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'' (1985), Scorsese made an esthetic shift back to a pared-down, almost \"underground\" film-making style. Filmed on an extremely low budget, on location, and at night in the [[SoHo]] neighborhood of Manhattan, the film is a black comedy about one increasingly misfortunate night for a mild New York word processor ([[Griffin Dunne]]) and features cameos by such disparate actors as [[Teri Garr]] and [[Cheech and Chong]]. Along with the 1987 [[Michael Jackson]] music video \"[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)#Music video|Bad]]\", in 1986 Scorsese made ''[[The Color of Money]]'', a sequel to the much admired [[Robert Rossen]] film ''[[The Hustler (film)|The Hustler]]'' (1961) with [[Paul Newman]], which co-starred [[Tom Cruise]]. Although adhering to Scorsese's established style, ''The Color of Money'' was the director's first official foray into [[mainstream]] film-making. The film finally won actor Paul Newman an Oscar and gave Scorsese the clout to finally secure backing for a project that had been a longtime goal for him: ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]''.\n\nIn 1983, Scorsese began work on this long-cherished personal project. ''The Last Temptation of Christ'', based on the [[The Last Temptation of Christ (novel)|1955 novel]] written by [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], retold the life of [[Christ]] in human rather than divine terms. [[Barbara Hershey]] recalls introducing Scorsese to the book while they were filming ''Boxcar Bertha''.<ref name=TCM>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=194050 |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |title=Boxcar Bertha |accessdate=November 17, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006002322/http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=194050 |archivedate=October 6, 2010}}</ref> The film was slated to shoot under the [[Paramount Pictures]] banner, but shortly before principal photography was to start, Paramount pulled the plug on the project, citing pressure from religious groups. In this aborted 1983 version, [[Aidan Quinn]] was cast as Jesus, and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] was cast as [[Pontius Pilate]]. (In the 1988 version, these roles were played by [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[David Bowie]] respectively.) However, following his mid-1980s flirtation with commercial Hollywood, Scorsese made a major return to personal filmmaking with the project, which was ultimately released in 1988. Even prior to its release, the film (adapted by ''Taxi Driver'' and ''Raging Bull'' veteran Paul Schrader) caused a massive furor, with worldwide protests against its perceived [[blasphemy]] effectively turning a low-budget independent film into a media sensation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/cultureshock/flashpoints/theater/lasttemptation.html |title=Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ |publisher=[[Pbs.org]] |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830074627/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/cultureshock/flashpoints/theater/lasttemptation.html |archivedate=August 30, 2010}}</ref> Most of the controversy centered on the final passages of the film, which depicted Christ marrying and raising a family with [[Mary Magdalene]] in a [[Satan]]-induced [[hallucination]] while on the cross.\n\nLooking past the controversy, ''The Last Temptation of Christ'' gained critical acclaim and remains an important work in Scorsese's canon: an explicit attempt to wrestle with the spirituality underpinning his films up until that point. The director went on to receive his second nomination for a Best Director Academy Award (again unsuccessfully, this time losing to [[Barry Levinson]] for ''[[Rain Man]]''). Scorsese then married producer [[Barbara De Fina]] in 1985, his fourth of five marriages; their marriage ended in divorce in 1991. As a separate film project, and along with directors [[Woody Allen]] and Francis Ford Coppola in 1989, Scorsese provided one of three segments in the portmanteau film ''[[New York Stories]]'', called \"Life Lessons\".\n\n=== 1990s ===\n[[File:Scorsese 01.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Martin Scorsese in 1995]]\nAfter a decade of films considered by critics to be mixed results, some considered Scorsese's gangster epic ''[[Goodfellas]]'' (1990) his return to directorial form, and his most confident and fully realized film since ''Raging Bull''. De Niro and [[Joe Pesci]] offered a virtuoso display of Scorsese's bravura cinematic technique in the film and re-established, enhanced, and consolidated his reputation. After the film was released, [[Roger Ebert]], a friend and supporter of Scorsese, named ''Goodfellas'' \"the best mob movie ever\". It is ranked No. 1 on Ebert's movie list for 1990, along with those of [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Peter Travers]]', and is widely considered one of the director's greatest achievements.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19900902/REVIEWS/9020301/1023 |title=:: rogerebert.com :: Reviews :: GoodFellas (xhtml) |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date=September 2, 1990 |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730045115/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19900902%2FREVIEWS%2F9020301%2F1023 |archivedate=July 30, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/reviews/review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000623089 |title=GoodFellas |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date= |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050206091630/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/reviews/review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000623089 |archivedate=February 6, 2005 |first=Stephen |last=Dalton |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/goodf.html |title=GoodFellas (1990) |publisher=Filmsite.org |date= |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110122117/http://www.filmsite.org/goodf.html |archivedate=January 10, 2010}}</ref> The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and Scorsese earned his third Best Director nomination but again lost to a first-time director, [[Kevin Costner]] (''[[Dances with Wolves]]''). Joe Pesci earned the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance. Scorsese and the film also won a number of other awards, including five [[BAFTA]] Awards, a [[Silver Lion]] and more. The American Film Institute placed ''Goodfellas'' at No. 94 on the AFI's 100 Years&nbsp;... 100 Movies list. On the 2007 updated version, they moved ''Goodfellas'' up to No. 92 on the AFI's 100 Years&nbsp;... 100 Movies list (10th Anniversary Edition) and put ''Goodfellas'' at No. 2 on [[AFI's 10 Top 10#Gangster|their list of the top 10 gangster films]] (after ''[[The Godfather]]'').\n\nIn 1990, he released his only short-form documentary: ''[[Made in Milan]]'' about fashion designer [[Giorgio Armani]]. The following year brought ''[[Cape Fear (1991 film)|Cape Fear]]'', a remake of a cult [[Cape Fear (1962 film)|1962 movie]] of the same name and the director's seventh collaboration with De Niro. Another foray into the mainstream, the film was a stylized thriller taking its cues heavily from [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Charles Laughton]]'s ''[[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]'' (1955). ''Cape Fear'' received a mixed critical reception and was lambasted in many quarters for its scenes depicting [[misogynistic]] violence. However, the lurid subject matter gave Scorsese a chance to experiment with visual tricks and effects. The film garnered two Oscar nominations. Earning $80 million domestically, it stood as Scorsese's most commercially successful release until ''The Aviator'' (2004), and then ''The Departed'' (2006). The film also marked the first time Scorsese used wide-screen Panavision with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1. Throughout the early 1990s until 1997, Scorsese actively dated actress [[Illeana Douglas]] following his third divorce.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://people.com/archive/note-worthy-vol-51-no-8/ |title=Note Worthy|first= Dan|last= Jewel|date= March 1, 1999|work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |access-date=October 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181025225552/https://people.com/archive/note-worthy-vol-51-no-8/ |archive-date=October 25, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Scorsese acted in a small role as [[Vincent van Gogh]] in the film ''[[Dreams (1990 film)|Dreams]]'' by Japanese director [[Akira Kurosawa]]. Scorsese's 1994 cameo appearance in the Robert Redford film ''Quiz Show'' is remembered for the telling line: \"You see, the audience didn't tune in to watch some amazing display of intellectual ability. They just wanted to watch the money.\" De Fina-Cappa was the production company he formed that same year with producer Barbara De Fina.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://letterboxd.com/studio/de-fina-cappa |title=Films produced by De Fina-Cappa |work=[[Letterboxd]] |accessdate=November 15, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903011625/http://letterboxd.com/studio/de-fina-cappa/ |archivedate=September 3, 2014}}</ref> In the early 1990s, Scorsese also expanded his role as a film producer. He produced a wide range of films, including major Hollywood studio productions (''[[Mad Dog and Glory]]'', ''[[Clockers (film)|Clockers]]''), low-budget independent films (''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]]'', ''[[Naked in New York]]'', ''[[Grace of My Heart]]'', ''[[Search and Destroy]]'', ''[[The Hi-Lo Country]]''), and even the foreign film (''[[Con gli occhi chiusi]]'' (With Closed Eyes)).\n\n[[File:Martin Scorsese 03.jpg|thumb|left|Scorsese in 1995]]\n\n''The Age of Innocence'' (1993) was a significant departure for Scorsese, a period adaptation of the [[Edith Wharton]] [[The Age of Innocence|novel]] about the constrictive high society of late-19th century New York. It was highly lauded by critics upon its original release but was a [[box office bomb]], making an overall loss. As noted in ''Scorsese on Scorsese'' by editor\u2013interviewer Ian Christie, the news that Scorsese wanted to make a film about a failed 19th-century romance raised many eyebrows among the film fraternity; all the more when Scorsese made it clear that it was a personal project and not a studio for-hire job.\n\nScorsese was interested in doing a \"romantic piece\", and he was strongly drawn to the characters and the story of Wharton's text. Scorsese wanted his film to be as rich an emotional experience as the book was to him rather than the traditional academic adaptations of literary works. To this end, Scorsese sought influence from diverse period films that had had an emotional impact on him. In ''Scorsese on Scorsese'', he documents influences from films such as [[Luchino Visconti]]'s ''[[Senso (film)|Senso]]'' and his ''[[The Leopard (1963 film)|Il Gattopardo]]'' (The Leopard) as well as [[Orson Welles]]'s ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' and also Roberto Rossellini's ''[[La prise de pouvoir par Louis&nbsp;XIV]]'' (The Taking of Power by Louis&nbsp;XIV). Although ''The Age of Innocence'' was ultimately different from these films in terms of narrative, story, and thematic concern, the presence of a lost society, of lost values as well as detailed re-creations of social customs and rituals continues the tradition of these films. It came back into the public eye, especially in countries such as the UK and France, but still is largely neglected in North America. The film earned five Academy Award nominations (including  Best Adapted Screenplay for Scorsese), winning the Costume Design Oscar. This was his first collaboration with the Academy Award-winning actor [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], with whom he would work again on ''Gangs of New York''.\n\n''[[Casino (1995 film)|Casino]]'' (1995), like ''The Age of Innocence'' before it, focused on a tightly wound male whose well-ordered life is disrupted by the arrival of unpredictable forces. The fact that it was a violent gangster film made it more palatable to the director's fans who perhaps were baffled by the apparent departure of the earlier film. ''Casino'' was a box office success,<ref name=\"variety-gross\">{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/andrew-garfield-to-star-in-martin-scorseses-silence-exclusive-1200470625/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Scott |last=Foundas |title=Andrew Garfield to Star in Martin Scorsese's 'Silence' (EXCLUSIVE) |date=May 7, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430081104/http://variety.com/2013/film/news/andrew-garfield-to-star-in-martin-scorseses-silence-exclusive-1200470625/ |archivedate=April 30, 2014}}</ref> but the film received mixed-to-positive notices from critics. In large part this was due to its significant stylistic similarities to his earlier ''Goodfellas'', and its excessive violence, which garnered it a reputation as possibly the most violent American gangster film. Indeed, many of the tropes and tricks of the earlier film resurfaced more or less intact, most obviously the casting of both Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, with Pesci once again playing an unbridled psychopath. [[Sharon Stone]] was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress Academy Award]] for her performance. During the filming, Scorsese played a background part as a gambler at one of the tables.\n\nScorsese still found time for a four-hour documentary in 1995, titled ''[[A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies]]'', offering a thorough trek through American cinema. It covered the silent era to 1969, a year after which Scorsese began his feature career. He said, \"I wouldn't feel right commenting on myself or my contemporaries.\" In the four-hour documentary, Scorsese lists the four aspects of the director he believes are the most important as (1) the director as storyteller; (2) the director as an illusionist: D. W. Griffith or F. W. Murnau, who created new editing techniques among other innovations that made the appearance of sound and color possible later on; (3) the director as a smuggler\u2014filmmakers such as [[Douglas Sirk]], Samuel Fuller, and [[Vincente Minnelli]], who used to hide subversive messages in their films; and (4) the director as iconoclast. In the preface to this documentary, Scorsese states his commitment to the \"Director's Dilemma\", in which a successful contemporary director must be pragmatic about the realities of getting financing for films of personal esthetic interest by accepting the need of \"making one film for the studio, and (then) making one for oneself.\"\n\nIf ''The Age of Innocence'' alienated and confused some fans, then ''[[Kundun]]'' (1997) went several steps further, offering an account of the early life of [[Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama]], the [[People's Liberation Army]]'s entry into [[Tibet]], and the Dalai Lama's subsequent exile to India. Not only a departure in subject matter, ''Kundun'' saw Scorsese employing a fresh narrative and visual approach. Traditional dramatic devices were substituted for a trance-like meditation achieved through an elaborate [[tableau vivant|tableau]] of colorful visual images.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.timeout.com/film/78857.html |title=Kundun |magazine=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110232624/http://www.timeout.com/film/78857.html |archivedate=January 10, 2008}}</ref> The film was a source of turmoil for its distributor, [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures]], which was planning significant expansion into the Chinese market at the time. Initially defiant in the face of pressure from Chinese officials, Disney has since distanced itself from the project, hurting ''Kundun''{{'}}s commercial profile. In the short term, the sheer eclecticism in evidence enhanced the director's reputation. In the long term, however, it appears ''Kundun'' has been sidelined in most critical appraisals of the director, mostly noted as a stylistic and thematic detour. ''Kundun'' was the Scorsese's second attempt to profile the life of a great religious leader, following ''The Last Temptation of Christ''.\n\n''Bringing Out the Dead'' (1999) was a return to familiar territory, with the director and writer Paul Schrader constructing a pitch-black comic take on their own earlier ''Taxi Driver''.<ref>{{cite web |title=New York Stories: A Complete Ranking of Martin Scorsese's Films Read More: Ranking Martin Scorsese's Movies From Best to Worst |url=https://screencrush.com/scorsese-list/ |publisher=[[Screen Crush]] |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428142744/http://screencrush.com/scorsese-list/ |archivedate=April 28, 2014}}</ref> Like previous Scorsese-Schrader collaborations, its final scenes of spiritual redemption explicitly recalls the films of Robert Bresson.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.film-philosophy.com/vol4-2000/n12reinert |title=Reinert on Bringing Out the Dead |publisher=Film-philosophy.com |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174544/http://www.film-philosophy.com/vol4-2000/n12reinert |archivedate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> (It is also worth noting that the film's incident-filled nocturnal setting is reminiscent of ''After Hours''.)

With a production budget said to be in excess of $100 million, ''Gangs of New York'' was Scorsese's biggest and arguably most mainstream venture to date. Like ''The Age of Innocence'', it was set in 19th-century New York, although focusing on the other end of the social scale (and like that film, also starring Daniel Day-Lewis). The film marked the first collaboration between Scorsese and actor [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], who became a fixture in later Scorsese films.

This effect can be seen in ''Casino'' (it is used on Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci), ''Life Lessons'', ''The Departed'' (on Matt Damon), and ''Hugo''. Some of his films include references/allusions to Westerns, particularly ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'', ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'', ''[[Shane (film)|Shane]]'', ''[[The Searchers]]'', and ''[[The Oklahoma Kid]]''. Slow motion flashbulbs and accented camera/flash/shutter sounds are often used, as is the song \"[[Gimme Shelter]]\" by The Rolling Stones heard in several of Scorsese's films: ''Goodfellas'', ''Casino'', and ''The Departed''.\n\n===Cameo appearances===\nScorsese usually has a quick cameo in his films (''Who's That Knocking at My Door'', ''Boxcar Bertha'', ''Mean Streets'', ''Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore'', ''Taxi Driver'', ''The King of Comedy'', ''After Hours'', ''The Last Temptation of Christ'' (albeit hidden under a hood), ''The Age of Innocence'', ''Gangs of New York'', ''Hugo''), he is also known to contribute his voice to a film without appearing on screen (e.g. as in ''The Aviator'' and ''The Wolf of Wall Street''). In ''The Age of Innocence'', for example, he appears in the non-speaking role of a [[large format]] portrait photographer in one of the passing scenes of the film. He provides the opening voice-over narration in ''Mean Streets'' and ''The Color of Money''; plays the off-screen dressing room attendant in the final scene of ''Raging Bull'', and provides the voice of the unseen ambulance dispatcher in ''Bringing Out the Dead''.<ref>[http://www.filmsite.org/directorcameos1.html Most Famous Film Director Cameos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510072224/http://www.filmsite.org/directorcameos1.html |date=May 10, 2008 }} by Tim Dirks, [[Filmsite.org]] (online), 2008</ref> He also appears as the director of fictional newly formed Vatican Television in the Italian comedy ''[[In the Pope's Eye]]''.\n\n===Religious guilt===\nGuilt is a prominent theme in many of his films, as is the role of Catholicism in creating and dealing with guilt (''Who's That Knocking at My Door'', ''Mean Streets'', ''Raging Bull'', ''Bringing Out the Dead'', ''The Departed'', ''Shutter Island'').

(was) a crucial player in both gangland politics and the actual practical politics of the day, and the movie's key through line is the inseparability of those two realms. ''The Irishman'' is a sociopolitical horror story that views much of modern American history as a continuous crime in motion, in which every level of society\u2014from domestic life through local business through big business through national and international politics\u2014is poisoned by graft and bribery, shady deals and dirty money, threats of violence and its gruesome enactment, and the hard-baked impunity that keeps the entire system running.<ref>\"Watching ''The Irishman'' on Netflix Is the Best Way to See It.\" By Richard Brody.

The single exception is Kubrick's 1968 film ''2001: A Space Odyssey''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/sightandsoundpoll2012/voter/1058 |title=Martin Scorsese's Picks for 2012 Sight and Sound Polls |website=Bfi.org.uk |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |access-date=August 22, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160223005206/http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people//sightandsoundpoll2012/voter/1058 |archivedate=February 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== 1970s ===\nScorsese became friends with the influential \"movie brats\" of the 1970s: [[Brian De Palma]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[George Lucas]] and [[Steven Spielberg]].<ref name=\"BANDB\">{{Cite web |url=https://bedfordandbowery.com/2016/06/brian-de-palma-shed-light-on-a-crazy-rumor-about-scorsese-and-taxi-driver/ |title=Brian De Palma Shed Light on a Crazy Rumor About Martin Scorsese and Taxi Driver |last=Maurer |first=Daniel |date=June 9, 2016 |website=bedfordandbowery.com |url-status=live |access-date=January 9, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181111035443/http://bedfordandbowery.com/2016/06/brian-de-palma-shed-light-on-a-crazy-rumor-about-scorsese-and-taxi-driver/ |archive-date=November 11, 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"Adams1\">{{cite book |title=Adams, Veronika ''Martin Scorsese'' Ebook.GD Publishing ISBN 1-61323-010-9 |isbn=9781613230107 |last1=Adams |first1=Veronika |date=January 27, 2011}}</ref> It was De Palma who introduced Scorsese to [[Robert De Niro]].<ref name=\"BANDB\"/> During this period, Scorsese worked as the assistant director and one of the editors on the documentary ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' (1970) and met actor\u2013director [[John Cassavetes]], who became a close friend and mentor.

Following the film's release, Cassavetes encouraged Scorsese to make the films that he wanted to make, rather than someone else's projects.\n\nChampioned by influential film critic [[Pauline Kael]], ''Mean Streets'' was a breakthrough for Scorsese, De Niro, and Keitel. By now the signature Scorsese style was in place: macho posturing, bloody violence, Catholic guilt and redemption, gritty New York locale (though the majority of ''Mean Streets'' was shot in Los Angeles), rapid-fire editing and a soundtrack with contemporary music. Although the film was innovative, its wired atmosphere, edgy documentary style, and gritty street-level direction owed a debt to directors Cassavetes, [[Samuel Fuller]] and early [[Jean-Luc Godard]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A99967-1991Nov24.html |title=Scorsese, Master Of The Rage |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=November 24, 1991 |first=Hal |last=Hinson|access-date=September 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203140433/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A99967-1991Nov24.html|archive-date=December 3, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1974, actress [[Ellen Burstyn]] chose Scorsese to direct her in ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'', for which she won an Academy Award for Best Actress. Although well regarded, the film remains an anomaly in the director's early career as it focuses on a central female character. Returning to Little Italy to explore his ethnic roots, Scorsese next came up with ''[[Italianamerican]]'', a documentary featuring his parents Charles and Catherine Scorsese.\n\n''[[Taxi Driver]]'' followed in 1976\u2014Scorsese's dark, urban nightmare of one lonely man's gradual descent into insanity. The film established him as an accomplished filmmaker and also brought attention to cinematographer [[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)|Michael Chapman]], whose style tends towards high contrasts, strong colors, and complex camera movements.

This tribute to Scorsese's home town and the classic Hollywood musical was a box-office failure. The film was the director's third collaboration with Robert De Niro, co-starring with [[Liza Minnelli]]. The film is best remembered today for the title theme song, which was popularized by [[Frank Sinatra]]. Although possessing Scorsese's usual visual panache and stylistic bravura, many critics felt its enclosed studio-bound atmosphere left it leaden in comparison with his earlier work. Despite its weak reception, the film is regarded positively by some critics. Richard Brody in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote: {{quote|For Scorsese, a lifelong cinephile, the essence of New York could be found in its depiction in classic Hollywood movies.

By this stage the director had  developed a serious [[cocaine]] addiction. However, he did find the creative drive to make the highly regarded ''[[The Last Waltz]]'', documenting the final concert by [[The Band]]. It was held at the [[Winterland Ballroom]] in San Francisco on American Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1976, and featured one of the most extensive lineups of prominent guest performers at a single concert, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[Neil Young]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Paul Butterfield]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Ronnie Wood]], and [[Eric Clapton]]. However, Scorsese's commitments to other projects delayed the release of the film until 1978. Another Scorsese-directed documentary, titled ''[[American Boy: A Profile of Steven Prince|American Boy]]'', also appeared in 1978, focusing on Steven Prince, the cocky gun salesman who appeared in ''Taxi Driver''. A period of wild partying followed, damaging the director's already fragile health. Scorsese helped provide footage for the documentary ''[[Elvis on Tour]]''. Before the end of 1979, Scorsese married actress [[Isabella Rossellini]], and they stayed together for four years until their divorce in 1983.<ref>{{cite news |last=Halpern |first=Dan |title=Interview: Isabella Rossellini \u2013 Daddy's girl |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/may/01/features.features11 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |date=April 30, 2006 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418234306/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/may/01/features.features11 |archivedate=April 18, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== 1980s ===\n\nBy several accounts (Scorsese's included), Robert De Niro practically saved Scorsese's life when he persuaded him to kick his cocaine addiction to make his highly regarded film ''[[Raging Bull]]''.

From this work onwards, Scorsese's films are always labeled as \"A Martin Scorsese Picture\" on promotional material. ''Raging Bull'', filmed in high contrast black and white, is where Scorsese's style reached its zenith: ''Taxi Driver'' and ''New York, New York'' had used elements of [[expressionism]] to replicate psychological points of view, but here the style was taken to new extremes, employing extensive slow-motion, complex tracking shots, and extravagant distortion of perspective (for example, the size of boxing rings would change from fight to fight).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eufs.org.uk/films/raging_bull.html |title=Raging Bull |publisher=Eufs.org.uk |date=March 5, 2001 |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430185450/http://www.eufs.org.uk/films/raging_bull.html |archivedate=April 30, 2009}}</ref> Thematically too, the concerns carried on from ''Mean Streets'' and ''Taxi Driver'': insecure males, violence, guilt, and redemption.\n\n\nAlthough the screenplay for ''Raging Bull'' was credited to Paul Schrader and [[Mardik Martin]] (who earlier co-wrote ''Mean Streets''), the finished script differed extensively from Schrader's original draft.

This led to a more significant acting appearance in [[Bertrand Tavernier]]'s [[jazz]] film ''[[Round Midnight (film)|Round Midnight]]''. He also made a brief venture into television, directing an episode of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]''.\n\nWith ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'' (1985), Scorsese made an esthetic shift back to a pared-down, almost \"underground\" film-making style. Filmed on an extremely low budget, on location, and at night in the [[SoHo]] neighborhood of Manhattan, the film is a black comedy about one increasingly misfortunate night for a mild New York word processor ([[Griffin Dunne]]) and features cameos by such disparate actors as [[Teri Garr]] and [[Cheech and Chong]]. Along with the 1987 [[Michael Jackson]] music video \"[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)#Music video|Bad]]\", in 1986 Scorsese made ''[[The Color of Money]]'', a sequel to the much admired [[Robert Rossen]] film ''[[The Hustler (film)|The Hustler]]'' (1961) with [[Paul Newman]], which co-starred [[Tom Cruise]]. Although adhering to Scorsese's established style, ''The Color of Money'' was the director's first official foray into [[mainstream]] film-making. The film finally won actor Paul Newman an Oscar and gave Scorsese the clout to finally secure backing for a project that had been a longtime goal for him: ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]''.\n\nIn 1983, Scorsese began work on this long-cherished personal project. ''The Last Temptation of Christ'', based on the [[The Last Temptation of Christ (novel)|1955 novel]] written by [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], retold the life of [[Christ]] in human rather than divine terms. [[Barbara Hershey]] recalls introducing Scorsese to the book while they were filming ''Boxcar Bertha''.<ref name=TCM>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=194050 |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]] |title=Boxcar Bertha |accessdate=November 17, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006002322/http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article/?cid=194050 |archivedate=October 6, 2010}}</ref> The film was slated to shoot under the [[Paramount Pictures]] banner, but shortly before principal photography was to start, Paramount pulled the plug on the project, citing pressure from religious groups. In this aborted 1983 version, [[Aidan Quinn]] was cast as Jesus, and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] was cast as [[Pontius Pilate]]. (In the 1988 version, these roles were played by [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[David Bowie]] respectively.) However, following his mid-1980s flirtation with commercial Hollywood, Scorsese made a major return to personal filmmaking with the project, which was ultimately released in 1988. Even prior to its release, the film (adapted by ''Taxi Driver'' and ''Raging Bull'' veteran Paul Schrader) caused a massive furor, with worldwide protests against its perceived [[blasphemy]] effectively turning a low-budget independent film into a media sensation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/cultureshock/flashpoints/theater/lasttemptation.html |title=Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ |publisher=[[Pbs.org]] |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830074627/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/cultureshock/flashpoints/theater/lasttemptation.html |archivedate=August 30, 2010}}</ref> Most of the controversy centered on the final passages of the film, which depicted Christ marrying and raising a family with [[Mary Magdalene]] in a [[Satan]]-induced [[hallucination]] while on the cross.\n\nLooking past the controversy, ''The Last Temptation of Christ'' gained critical acclaim and remains an important work in Scorsese's canon: an explicit attempt to wrestle with the spirituality underpinning his films up until that point. The director went on to receive his second nomination for a Best Director Academy Award (again unsuccessfully, this time losing to [[Barry Levinson]] for ''[[Rain Man]]''). Scorsese then married producer [[Barbara De Fina]] in 1985, his fourth of five marriages; their marriage ended in divorce in 1991. As a separate film project, and along with directors [[Woody Allen]] and Francis Ford Coppola in 1989, Scorsese provided one of three segments in the portmanteau film ''[[New York Stories]]'', called \"Life Lessons\".\n\n=== 1990s ===\n[[File:Scorsese 01.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Martin Scorsese in 1995]]\nAfter a decade of films considered by critics to be mixed results, some considered Scorsese's gangster epic ''[[Goodfellas]]'' (1990) his return to directorial form, and his most confident and fully realized film since ''Raging Bull''.

After the film was released, [[Roger Ebert]], a friend and supporter of Scorsese, named ''Goodfellas'' \"the best mob movie ever\". It is ranked No. 1 on Ebert's movie list for 1990, along with those of [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Peter Travers]]', and is widely considered one of the director's greatest achievements.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19900902/REVIEWS/9020301/1023 |title=:: rogerebert.com :: Reviews :: GoodFellas (xhtml) |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date=September 2, 1990 |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730045115/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19900902%2FREVIEWS%2F9020301%2F1023 |archivedate=July 30, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/reviews/review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000623089 |title=GoodFellas |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date= |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050206091630/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/reviews/review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000623089 |archivedate=February 6, 2005 |first=Stephen |last=Dalton |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/goodf.html |title=GoodFellas (1990) |publisher=Filmsite.org |date= |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110122117/http://www.filmsite.org/goodf.html |archivedate=January 10, 2010}}</ref> The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and Scorsese earned his third Best Director nomination but again lost to a first-time director, [[Kevin Costner]] (''[[Dances with Wolves]]''). Joe Pesci earned the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance. Scorsese and the film also won a number of other awards, including five [[BAFTA]] Awards, a [[Silver Lion]] and more. The American Film Institute placed ''Goodfellas'' at No. 94 on the AFI's 100 Years&nbsp;... 100 Movies list. On the 2007 updated version, they moved ''Goodfellas'' up to No. 92 on the AFI's 100 Years&nbsp;... 100 Movies list (10th Anniversary Edition) and put ''Goodfellas'' at No. 2 on [[AFI's 10 Top 10#Gangster|their list of the top 10 gangster films]] (after ''[[The Godfather]]'').\n\nIn 1990, he released his only short-form documentary: ''[[Made in Milan]]'' about fashion designer [[Giorgio Armani]]. The following year brought ''[[Cape Fear (1991 film)|Cape Fear]]'', a remake of a cult [[Cape Fear (1962 film)|1962 movie]] of the same name and the director's seventh collaboration with De Niro. Another foray into the mainstream, the film was a stylized thriller taking its cues heavily from [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and [[Charles Laughton]]'s ''[[The Night of the Hunter (film)|The Night of the Hunter]]'' (1955). ''Cape Fear'' received a mixed critical reception and was lambasted in many quarters for its scenes depicting [[misogynistic]] violence. However, the lurid subject matter gave Scorsese a chance to experiment with visual tricks and effects. The film garnered two Oscar nominations. Earning $80 million domestically, it stood as Scorsese's most commercially successful release until ''The Aviator'' (2004), and then ''The Departed'' (2006). The film also marked the first time Scorsese used wide-screen Panavision with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1. Throughout the early 1990s until 1997, Scorsese actively dated actress [[Illeana Douglas]] following his third divorce.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://people.com/archive/note-worthy-vol-51-no-8/ |title=Note Worthy|first= Dan|last= Jewel|date= March 1, 1999|work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |access-date=October 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181025225552/https://people.com/archive/note-worthy-vol-51-no-8/ |archive-date=October 25, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Scorsese acted in a small role as [[Vincent van Gogh]] in the film ''[[Dreams (1990 film)|Dreams]]'' by Japanese director [[Akira Kurosawa]]. Scorsese's 1994 cameo appearance in the Robert Redford film ''Quiz Show'' is remembered for the telling line: \"You see, the audience didn't tune in to watch some amazing display of intellectual ability. They just wanted to watch the money.\" De Fina-Cappa was the production company he formed that same year with producer Barbara De Fina.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://letterboxd.com/studio/de-fina-cappa |title=Films produced by De Fina-Cappa |work=[[Letterboxd]] |accessdate=November 15, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903011625/http://letterboxd.com/studio/de-fina-cappa/ |archivedate=September 3, 2014}}</ref> In the early 1990s, Scorsese also expanded his role as a film producer. He produced a wide range of films, including major Hollywood studio productions (''[[Mad Dog and Glory]]'', ''[[Clockers (film)|Clockers]]''), low-budget independent films (''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]]'', ''[[Naked in New York]]'', ''[[Grace of My Heart]]'', ''[[Search and Destroy]]'', ''[[The Hi-Lo Country]]''), and even the foreign film (''[[Con gli occhi chiusi]]'' (With Closed Eyes)).\n\n[[File:Martin Scorsese 03.jpg|thumb|left|Scorsese in 1995]]\n\n''The Age of Innocence'' (1993) was a significant departure for Scorsese, a period adaptation of the [[Edith Wharton]] [[The Age of Innocence|novel]] about the constrictive high society of late-19th century New York. It was highly lauded by critics upon its original release but was a [[box office bomb]], making an overall loss. As noted in ''Scorsese on Scorsese'' by editor\u2013interviewer Ian Christie, the news that Scorsese wanted to make a film about a failed 19th-century romance raised many eyebrows among the film fraternity; all the more when Scorsese made it clear that it was a personal project and not a studio for-hire job.\n\nScorsese was interested in doing a \"romantic piece\", and he was strongly drawn to the characters and the story of Wharton's text. Scorsese wanted his film to be as rich an emotional experience as the book was to him rather than the traditional academic adaptations of literary works. To this end, Scorsese sought influence from diverse period films that had had an emotional impact on him. In ''Scorsese on Scorsese'', he documents influences from films such as [[Luchino Visconti]]'s ''[[Senso (film)|Senso]]'' and his ''[[The Leopard (1963 film)|Il Gattopardo]]'' (The Leopard) as well as [[Orson Welles]]'s ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'' and also Roberto Rossellini's ''[[La prise de pouvoir par Louis&nbsp;XIV]]'' (The Taking of Power by Louis&nbsp;XIV). Although ''The Age of Innocence'' was ultimately different from these films in terms of narrative, story, and thematic concern, the presence of a lost society, of lost values as well as detailed re-creations of social customs and rituals continues the tradition of these films. It came back into the public eye, especially in countries such as the UK and France, but still is largely neglected in North America. The film earned five Academy Award nominations (including  Best Adapted Screenplay for Scorsese), winning the Costume Design Oscar. This was his first collaboration with the Academy Award-winning actor [[Daniel Day-Lewis]], with whom he would work again on ''Gangs of New York''.\n\n''[[Casino (1995 film)|Casino]]'' (1995), like ''The Age of Innocence'' before it, focused on a tightly wound male whose well-ordered life is disrupted by the arrival of unpredictable forces. The fact that it was a violent gangster film made it more palatable to the director's fans who perhaps were baffled by the apparent departure of the earlier film. ''Casino'' was a box office success,<ref name=\"variety-gross\">{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/andrew-garfield-to-star-in-martin-scorseses-silence-exclusive-1200470625/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Scott |last=Foundas |title=Andrew Garfield to Star in Martin Scorsese's 'Silence' (EXCLUSIVE) |date=May 7, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430081104/http://variety.com/2013/film/news/andrew-garfield-to-star-in-martin-scorseses-silence-exclusive-1200470625/ |archivedate=April 30, 2014}}</ref> but the film received mixed-to-positive notices from critics. In large part this was due to its significant stylistic similarities to his earlier ''Goodfellas'', and its excessive violence, which garnered it a reputation as possibly the most violent American gangster film. Indeed, many of the tropes and tricks of the earlier film resurfaced more or less intact, most obviously the casting of both Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, with Pesci once again playing an unbridled psychopath. [[Sharon Stone]] was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress Academy Award]] for her performance. During the filming, Scorsese played a background part as a gambler at one of the tables.\n\nScorsese still found time for a four-hour documentary in 1995, titled ''[[A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies]]'', offering a thorough trek through American cinema. It covered the silent era to 1969, a year after which Scorsese began his feature career. He said, \"I wouldn't feel right commenting on myself or my contemporaries.\" In the four-hour documentary, Scorsese lists the four aspects of the director he believes are the most important as (1) the director as storyteller; (2) the director as an illusionist: D. W. Griffith or F. W. Murnau, who created new editing techniques among other innovations that made the appearance of sound and color possible later on; (3) the director as a smuggler\u2014filmmakers such as [[Douglas Sirk]], Samuel Fuller, and [[Vincente Minnelli]], who used to hide subversive messages in their films; and (4) the director as iconoclast. In the preface to this documentary, Scorsese states his commitment to the \"Director's Dilemma\", in which a successful contemporary director must be pragmatic about the realities of getting financing for films of personal esthetic interest by accepting the need of \"making one film for the studio, and (then) making one for oneself.\"\n\nIf ''The Age of Innocence'' alienated and confused some fans, then ''[[Kundun]]'' (1997) went several steps further, offering an account of the early life of [[Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama]], the [[People's Liberation Army]]'s entry into [[Tibet]], and the Dalai Lama's subsequent exile to India. Not only a departure in subject matter, ''Kundun'' saw Scorsese employing a fresh narrative and visual approach. Traditional dramatic devices were substituted for a trance-like meditation achieved through an elaborate [[tableau vivant|tableau]] of colorful visual images.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.timeout.com/film/78857.html |title=Kundun |magazine=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110232624/http://www.timeout.com/film/78857.html |archivedate=January 10, 2008}}</ref> The film was a source of turmoil for its distributor, [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Pictures]], which was planning significant expansion into the Chinese market at the time. Initially defiant in the face of pressure from Chinese officials, Disney has since distanced itself from the project, hurting ''Kundun''{{'}}s commercial profile. In the short term, the sheer eclecticism in evidence enhanced the director's reputation. In the long term, however, it appears ''Kundun'' has been sidelined in most critical appraisals of the director, mostly noted as a stylistic and thematic detour. ''Kundun'' was the Scorsese's second attempt to profile the life of a great religious leader, following ''The Last Temptation of Christ''.\n\n''Bringing Out the Dead'' (1999) was a return to familiar territory, with the director and writer Paul Schrader constructing a pitch-black comic take on their own earlier ''Taxi Driver''.<ref>{{cite web |title=New York Stories: A Complete Ranking of Martin Scorsese's Films Read More: Ranking Martin Scorsese's Movies From Best to Worst |url=https://screencrush.com/scorsese-list/ |publisher=[[Screen Crush]] |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428142744/http://screencrush.com/scorsese-list/ |archivedate=April 28, 2014}}</ref> Like previous Scorsese-Schrader collaborations, its final scenes of spiritual redemption explicitly recalls the films of Robert Bresson.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.film-philosophy.com/vol4-2000/n12reinert |title=Reinert on Bringing Out the Dead |publisher=Film-philosophy.com |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629174544/http://www.film-philosophy.com/vol4-2000/n12reinert |archivedate=June 29, 2011}}</ref> (It is also worth noting that the film's incident-filled nocturnal setting is reminiscent of ''After Hours''.)

The documentary foreshadowed the director's next project, the epic ''Gangs of New York'' (2002), influenced by (amongst many others) major Italian directors such as Luchino Visconti and filmed in its entirety at Rome's famous [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] film studios. With a production budget said to be in excess of $100 million, ''Gangs of New York'' was Scorsese's biggest and arguably most mainstream venture to date. Like ''The Age of Innocence'', it was set in 19th-century New York, although focusing on the other end of the social scale (and like that film, also starring Daniel Day-Lewis). The film marked the first collaboration between Scorsese and actor [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], who became a fixture in later Scorsese films.

The film does not cover Dylan's entire career; it focuses on his beginnings, his rise to fame in the 1960s, his then-[[Electric Dylan controversy|controversial transformation]] from an acoustic guitar-based musician and performer to an electric guitar-influenced sound and his \"retirement\" from touring in 1966 following an infamous motorcycle accident. The film was first presented on television in both the United States (as part of the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] ''[[American Masters]]'' series) and the United Kingdom (as part of the [[BBC Two]] ''[[Arena (UK TV series)|Arena]]'' series) on September 26 to 27, 2005. A DVD version of the film was released the same month. The film won a [[Peabody Award]] and the [[Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video]].

He began a lifelong correspondence with his younger brother, Hugues, and their dear sister, Ad\u00e8le, the three remaining very close throughout their lives.\n\nHis innumerable detailed letters to his siblings are still today an exceptional source of knowledge on every aspect of the life of a world traveller, explorer, and diplomat, during the [[French Revolution]], the Napoleonic Empire, and the [[Bourbon Restoration|Restoration]] of the French Monarchy, at the turn of the 19th century.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Pouqueville studied at the college of [[Caen]] before joining the [[Lisieux]] seminary. He became deacon and was ordained at 21. He then was vicar in his native county of Montmarc\u00e9.\n[[Image:Le Merlerault chuch.jpg|left|thumb|135px|''Le Merlerault church'']]\nInitially known for his convictions as young Royalist minister, he was protected and saved by his own congregation from the ''cleansing''  massacres orchestrated against the aristocrats by some uncontrolled revolutionary mobs during the ''[[Reign of Terror]]'' period.\n\nHowever, in these exalting times, like many of the young French [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]], he started supporting the rising democratic movement and, when on 14 July 1793 (year 2 of the French Republic) the primary Assembly of [[Le Merlerault]] adopted the new Constitution, Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville was its Secretary.\n\nHe was assistant to the mayor (1793), then 23 years old and finding his vocation with the events of the [[French Revolution]], he finally resigned from the clergy to become a teacher (1794), and a municipal assistant at Le Merlereault (1795). He remained a fervent Christian during all his life.\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ois de Pouqueville jeune.jpg|right|thumb|185px|''Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville 1805'']]\n\nHowever, his renunciation of the cloth, his strong Republican speeches, and his open criticisms of the [[Papacy]], made him the target this time of the resurgent royalists in Normandy, and he had again to seek refuge in hiding \u2013 probably in Caen<ref>''From my solitude'' 1795 \u2013 notes and journals of Fran\u00e7ois de Pouqueville (unpubl.)</ref> \u2013 until the defeat in [[Quiberon]] of the royalist forces joined by the bands of [[Fran\u00e7ois Athanase de Charette de la Contrie|Charette]]'s [[chouans]], destroyed by the Republican army led by [[Lazare Hoche|Hoche]], as it was done by Bonaparte \u2013 nicknamed Captain Canon \u2013 at the siege of [[Siege of Toulon|Toulon]] and later in Paris.\n\nWhen Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville returned to Le Merlerault, the town's physician, Dr Cochin, who had been his colleague at the college of Caen, took him as student-surgeon. He then introduced him to his friend the professor Antoine Dubois<ref>\nProfessor A. Dubois liked Pouqueville as his own son. However, years later, on 13 December 1810, Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville wrote to Ruffin: \"We are crossed, like friends can be, because I left the robe for the sword...Dubois looked at me as his own glory, and he was furious, when he saw me renegade. You can't imagine his anger truly comical: \"It takes twelve things to be a doctor.

He was 27.\nUnder Professor Dubois, he made rapid progress in medicine and surgery, and the following year, when then general [[Napoleon|Bonaparte]]'s expedition to [[Egypt]] was decided upon, Pouqueville was one of the surgeons of its accompanying [[Description de l'Egypte (1809)|''commission of sciences and arts of Egypt'']]. This turned to be a crucial decision which to considerable degree affected the rest of his life\n\nWith dreams of glory and fortune, Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville embarked in [[Toulon]] with the ill-fated French Fleet under the command of G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Bonaparte as it sailed towards Egypt. On the way, he witnessed the taking of [[Malta]],<ref>Having taken Malta, the French, in a typical magnanimous gesture, set free all the prisoners in the Maltese jails. Amongst those was Orouchs, a noted pirate who immediately went to the British Fleet to be rearmed, and resumed his criminal activities. It was him who, less than a year after being liberated in Malta, attacked the merchant vessel where Pouqueville was a passenger, took him prisoner and sold him to the Turks.

Converesely, his encounters with Nelson filled him with repugnance, so brutal and cruel the Admiral proved to be towards the French officers, and from then on, Pouqueville would only mention him under the epithet of \"blood-thirsty [[cyclops]]\".\n\nHis mission accomplished, and having caught a bad fever that restrained him from continuing his scientific researches, Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville was advised by Kleber to return to France to receive better medical attention.\n\nHe boarded the Italian [[merchant ship]] ''La madonna di Montenegro'' in [[Alexandria]]. She was sailing to Italy and approaching [[Calabria]] when being attacked by [[Barbary Coast]] pirates. Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville was among those taken prisoner.\n\n==Prisoner of the Turkish Sultan==\n\n===Peloponese: Pasha and physician===\n[[Image:Louis-Dupre-Helene.jpg|thumb|right|135px|''\"Greek beauty\" (The princess [[Helena Soutzos]])'' by [[Louis Dupr\u00e9 (painter)|Louis Dupr\u00e9]], 1820]]\nBrought to [[Pylos|Navarino]], and then to [[Tripolitza]], capital of [[Peloponnese]], he was remanded to the custody of the pacha of [[Morea]], Moustapha, the Ottoman Empire being at war with France.\n\nMoustapha Pacha received him with some indifference, but he still protected him against the brutalities of the Albanian soldiers who were guarding him since his capture, and he gave him a decent lodging.\n\nSoon after, the pacha was deposed and replaced by Achmet Pacha.<ref>17 years later, Pouqueville found Achmet Pacha banished in Larissa, and he brought him some financial help, but the former pacha died of starvation a short time afterwards.''An unpublished correspondence of Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville'' [[Henri Deh\u00e9rain]]. \u00c9douard Champion, Publisher, Paris 1921</ref>\n\nHaving learned that Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville practiced medicine, the new pacha treated him well and, after seeing how successful Pouqueville was when healing some members of his entourage, he named him official physician of his ''[[pashalic]]''.\n\nPouqueville took advantage of his new situation by exploring the surrounding regions and by researching the sites of ancient Greece.<ref>\"One can read in Pouqueville an exact description of Tripolitza, capital of the Peloponese.\" Chateaubriand, ''From Paris to Jerusalem''</ref>\n\nHe remained in Tripolitza through the harsh 1798 winter.\n\n===Constantinople: prisons and harems===\n[[Image:Yedikule-2.jpg|thumb|185px|The ''[[Yedikule Fortress|Yedikule]]'' today]]\nIn the spring, the Sultan ordered that he be transferred over land and sea with his co-prisoners to [[Constantinople]] where they were incarcerated for two years in the Fortress of Seven Towers, ''[[Walls of Constantinople#Yedikule Fortress|Yedikule]]''.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Pouqueville wrote that they found there, living in abject conditions, the members of the French embassy to whom the Sultan had refused, under insistent demands from the British, the usual diplomatic treatment of being kept on parole at the French embassy palace, which had been appropriated by the same British.\n\nPouqueville tried saving the life the dying Adjutant-general Rose, but it was too late. Rose had been France's representative in [[Epirus]] and had fallen victim of [[Ali Pasha of Ioannina]]<ref>Page 94 ''The life of Ali Pacha of Jannina'' 2nd Edition, Lupton Relfe, London (1823) available online at Google Books [https://archive.org/details/lifealipachajan00beaugoog]</ref>'s cruel perfidy. A few years later, he would be replaced in Ioannina by Pouqueville himself.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Pouqueville became friend with the French diplomat [[Pierre Ruffin|Ruffin]], held prisoner since the expedition of Egypt, whose health he attended to, whom he nicknamed the ''[[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] of the [[Orient]]'' and with whom he perfected his knowledge of ''[[oriental studies|orientalist]]''. Later, the two men continued their correspondence long after their release from prison, until Ruffin's death.\n\nSoon after arriving in Constantinople, Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville gained some liberty of movement, as his jailers had learned about his medical skills.\n\nHe succeeded in exploring the surroundings of the fortress, notably the Sultan's private gardens at the [[Topkap\u0131 Palace|Topkapi]] palace, and even the garden of his [[harem]], with the complicity of the Sultan's gardener whom he had befriended.\n\nOn occasions, he convinced his guards to let him travel through the City of Constantinople and along the [[Bosphorus]], all the way to the [[Black Sea]], to attend to other French prisoners who were gravely ill and held in a distant jail.\n\nAt the time, the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] was still active in the eastern parts of the Mediterranean regions. Pouqueville was determined in his researches of the proper medical methods to fight the terrible disease. His observations in the form of a thesis were highly regarded, when published in Paris upon his return.\n\nHis written accounts of such excursions were the first detailed descriptions by a westerner of the Turkish megalopolis and its diverse inhabitants, their way of life, customs and habits. These were received in Europe with great astonishment and curiosity, for 'The Gate of Asia' had previously remained practically unexplored by westerners since the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453.\n\n[[Image:Louis-Dupre-Pacha.jpg|thumb|left|235px|''\"Pasha\" by [[Louis Dupr\u00e9 (painter)|Louis Dupr\u00e9]] (1825)'']]\n\nWhile jailed, Pouqueville studied [[modern Greek]]. He translated [[Anacreon]], wrote several oriental pieces like ''The Pariah'', a short humoristic poem, ''La Gueuseade'', in four [[Gallican chant|chants]] and in [[sestet]]s, and a few lighter poems dedicated to Rose Ruffin.\n\nThroughout his captivity, Pouqueville kept a [[Diary|journal]] written in a [[secret code]] that he had devised and that he managed to hide from his guards, leading them instead in their occasional searches of his cell to other unimportant writings which he let them find and confiscate.\n\nIt is from this occult journal that he was able to write, a few years after his release, the 600 pages of the first two parts of the important book<ref>\"[[Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley]] (MWS) was concerned to describe accurately the geography of the area; she wrote to [[Charles Ollier]], the literary adviser for Henry Colburn, Mary's publisher: ''I am in great want of a book which describes minutely the Environs of Constantinople...you would oblige me if you would send it without delay''(MWS letters I, 431). She would doubtless have received Colburn's publication of Pouqueville's ''Travels in the Morea, Albania and other parts of the Ottoman Empire...etc''(1813, translated by Plumptre). Much of Mary's account of the geography and military history of the city could have been derived from Pouqueville's descriptions, maps and illustrations.\" afterwords by Joyce Carol Oates of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's ''The Last Man'' (Wordsworth Classics, 1826).</ref> he published in 1805 and that brought him fame and fortune, the 300 pages of part three being devoted to the astonishing adventures that his friends and brothers in arms ''(future Baron, General)'' [[Jean Poitevin|Poitevin]], ''(future General)'' [[Charbonnel]] and ''(future Consul General)'' [[Julien Bessi\u00e8res|Bessi\u00e8res]] encountered before and after their release from the fortress of seven towers.\n\n===Taking part in the emergence of Philhellenism<ref>\"...Philhellenism was a movement inspired from a love of classical Greece but was distinct from the equally popular antiquarian interest in the cultural products of classical antiquity. Philehellenism encompassed mobilization around the cause of the fate of modern Greeks, seen as the descendants of their putative classical progenitors, and included in its ranks Lord Byron and Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville.\" Umut \u00d6zkinimli & Spyros Sofos ''Tormented by History: Nationalism in Greece and Turkey'' Columbia University Press (25 April 2008)</ref>===\n[[Image:Greek boy.jpg|thumb|235px|''Greek boy defending his wounded father'' by [[Ary Scheffer]], a French painter(1795\u20131858)]]\nIn 1798, as a hostage of the Turks in [[Ottoman Greece]], Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville had an uneasy view of the Greeks he encountered in the close entourage of his Ottoman guards. Not unlike Lord Byron who later, at his death in 1824, also became a symbol of philhellenism,<ref>''\"Byron had yet to die to make philhellenism generally acceptable\"'' William Plomer ''\"The Diamond of Jannina\"'' (Taplinger Publishing New York 1970)</ref> Pouqueville felt at first unsure of the Greeks' sincerity.<ref>\"By-the-bye, I rather suspect we shall be at right angles in our opinion of the Greeks; I have not quite made up my mind about them, but you I know are decisively inimical.\" Lord Byron's Correspondence ''\"Letter to Hobhouse\"(1805)''</ref>\n\nHowever, his work as the pashalic's physician in Tripolitza caused his Turkish escort to become gradually sparser and his frequent contacts with authentic Greeks made him appreciate their rich cultural background under a new light. Even though it was being suppressed by the seven generations long occupation of Greece by their Ottoman rulers, the Greek social identity appeared very much alive to Pouqueville and, as a fervent believer of the French revolution's [[humanism]], he soon developed a growing sympathy for the budding Greek resurgence.\n\nHis condition as a prisoner of the Turkish Sultan prevented him at the time to do more than bringing medical attention and treatment to the oppressed population, but his writings already showed a strong new current of intellectual and emotional support.<ref>\"For the references, I am indebted to Pouqueville (Voyage de la Grece)\" ''Modern Greek folklore and ancient Greek religion: a study in revivals'' by John Cuthbert Lawson (1898)</ref>\n\nHis humane survey of Greece as early as 1798 is the 19th century's earliest manifestation of the [[philhellene]] movement. His impulse soon spread throughout Europe with the wide publication of his books setting in motion a constant trend amongst the greatest minds of the time to follow his steps across the newly revealed land of Greece.\n\nThe antique nation's rebirth ensued over the next decades with its war of independence and its liberation, with the break-up of the Ottoman Empire.<ref>''At the time, Greece was little known and was considered a Turkish province. Pouqueville proved that it was not so, that the Hellenes had retained their originality and their hopes, he predicted their success, he brought them the interest of Europe and of France in particular for their future rebellion.

To this you replied through your own interpreter, Mr Barthelemy, that as long as the British Government would observe a neutrality in the contest, between us and the Turks, you would remain an indifferent spectator, without taking part with either the one or the other. Notwithstanding this declaration, we state, with great pain, that we have obtained uncontroversible proofs that your conduit has not been conformable to your profession of neutrality. From the commencement of the contest you have constantly observed all our motions and resolutions for the purpose of informing our enemies. When the packet-boat from Malta, commanded by Mr Hunter, arrived at Patras, you sent to Prevesa to urge the Captain-Bey to send immediate succour to the Turks at Patras; and the captain-Bey, in fact, dispatched a brig, a corvette and a galley. You wrote also to the Pachas assembled before Jannina who sent Yusuf Pacha and the Kihaya of Mahmoud Pacha, with a considerable land armament. And, moreover, you continued to send to the Turks shut up in the citadel of Patras, intelligence of every thing that passed by means of persons devoted to your interest. We have more than once summoned you to pay our countrymen the sums due to them in consequence of your late purchases. Although the credit has expired, you still persis in refusing the payment*. You have, besides, sent your brother and your interpreter, who conducted Yussuf Pacha hither and acquainted him with the places by which he could most easily enter the citadel: you prepared and communicated yourself to the Turks the distinctive sign of the cross by which the Greeks recognize each other, that the Turks might attack us more advantageously under this disguise. Finally, you advised the Turks to light in the City of Patras that terrible fire by which all the goods in private houses, and the warehouses of the Company of Merchants have been destroyed. Immediately after the conflagration, the city was pillaged by the Turks and more particularly by those attached to your person. Thus, you have violated the rights of nations, and followed a conduct contrary to that prescribed by the declaration of neutrality made by your Government and yourself. You have occasioned losses amounting to several millions; you have exposed several Christians to death and captivity. By these presents we protest against you, in order that, at a suitable time, you may be called upon to render an account of all the disasters occasioned by you in contempt of the laws.

It was represented to him, that a Greek, of the name of Berouka, aged 76, his wife, three married daughters, and their children, forming altogether a family of 15 or 16 persons, had, after the massacre of Patras, from which they had escaped through the intervention of the French Consul, M. de Pouqueville, taken refuge in the island of Ithaca. These persons lived there in quiet until March last, when an order came from the Lord High Commissioner, directing them to depart out of the Ionian Islands. The unfortunate Greeks represented that they had, during their residence in the island, always conducted themselves in a proper manner, and entreated that they might be permitted to stay. The order for their departure was, however, iterated. The family next requested that they might be allowed to delay their departure until the sea which at that time was crowded with corsairs, should be in some degree cleared of these pirates; but even this indulgence was not conceded to them. The result was that almost immediately after they had set sail, they were attacked by an Algerine corsair, and after a short resistance, during which the old man was desperately wounded in the face, captured, carried into Algiers, and sold for slaves.

He was 27.\nUnder Professor Dubois, he made rapid progress in medicine and surgery, and the following year, when then general [[Napoleon|Bonaparte]]'s expedition to [[Egypt]] was decided upon, Pouqueville was one of the surgeons of its accompanying [[Description de l'Egypte (1809)|''commission of sciences and arts of Egypt'']]. This turned to be a crucial decision which to considerable degree affected the rest of his life\n\nWith dreams of glory and fortune, Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville embarked in [[Toulon]] with the ill-fated French Fleet under the command of G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Bonaparte as it sailed towards Egypt.

Converesely, his encounters with Nelson filled him with repugnance, so brutal and cruel the Admiral proved to be towards the French officers, and from then on, Pouqueville would only mention him under the epithet of \"blood-thirsty [[cyclops]]\".\n\nHis mission accomplished, and having caught a bad fever that restrained him from continuing his scientific researches, Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville was advised by Kleber to return to France to receive better medical attention.\n\nHe boarded the Italian [[merchant ship]] ''La madonna di Montenegro'' in [[Alexandria]]. She was sailing to Italy and approaching [[Calabria]] when being attacked by [[Barbary Coast]] pirates.

Rose had been France's representative in [[Epirus]] and had fallen victim of [[Ali Pasha of Ioannina]]<ref>Page 94 ''The life of Ali Pacha of Jannina'' 2nd Edition, Lupton Relfe, London (1823) available online at Google Books [https://archive.org/details/lifealipachajan00beaugoog]</ref>'s cruel perfidy. A few years later, he would be replaced in Ioannina by Pouqueville himself.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Pouqueville became friend with the French diplomat [[Pierre Ruffin|Ruffin]], held prisoner since the expedition of Egypt, whose health he attended to, whom he nicknamed the ''[[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] of the [[Orient]]'' and with whom he perfected his knowledge of ''[[oriental studies|orientalist]]''. Later, the two men continued their correspondence long after their release from prison, until Ruffin's death.\n\nSoon after arriving in Constantinople, Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville gained some liberty of movement, as his jailers had learned about his medical skills.\n\nHe succeeded in exploring the surroundings of the fortress, notably the Sultan's private gardens at the [[Topkap\u0131 Palace|Topkapi]] palace, and even the garden of his [[harem]], with the complicity of the Sultan's gardener whom he had befriended.\n\nOn occasions, he convinced his guards to let him travel through the City of Constantinople and along the [[Bosphorus]], all the way to the [[Black Sea]], to attend to other French prisoners who were gravely ill and held in a distant jail.\n\nAt the time, the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] was still active in the eastern parts of the Mediterranean regions. Pouqueville was determined in his researches of the proper medical methods to fight the terrible disease. His observations in the form of a thesis were highly regarded, when published in Paris upon his return.\n\nHis written accounts of such excursions were the first detailed descriptions by a westerner of the Turkish megalopolis and its diverse inhabitants, their way of life, customs and habits. These were received in Europe with great astonishment and curiosity, for 'The Gate of Asia' had previously remained practically unexplored by westerners since the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453.\n\n[[Image:Louis-Dupre-Pacha.jpg|thumb|left|235px|''\"Pasha\" by [[Louis Dupr\u00e9 (painter)|Louis Dupr\u00e9]] (1825)'']]\n\nWhile jailed, Pouqueville studied [[modern Greek]]. He translated [[Anacreon]], wrote several oriental pieces like ''The Pariah'', a short humoristic poem, ''La Gueuseade'', in four [[Gallican chant|chants]] and in [[sestet]]s, and a few lighter poems dedicated to Rose Ruffin.\n\nThroughout his captivity, Pouqueville kept a [[Diary|journal]] written in a [[secret code]] that he had devised and that he managed to hide from his guards, leading them instead in their occasional searches of his cell to other unimportant writings which he let them find and confiscate.\n\nIt is from this occult journal that he was able to write, a few years after his release, the 600 pages of the first two parts of the important book<ref>\"[[Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley]] (MWS) was concerned to describe accurately the geography of the area; she wrote to [[Charles Ollier]], the literary adviser for Henry Colburn, Mary's publisher: ''I am in great want of a book which describes minutely the Environs of Constantinople...you would oblige me if you would send it without delay''(MWS letters I, 431). She would doubtless have received Colburn's publication of Pouqueville's ''Travels in the Morea, Albania and other parts of the Ottoman Empire...etc''(1813, translated by Plumptre).

Philehellenism encompassed mobilization around the cause of the fate of modern Greeks, seen as the descendants of their putative classical progenitors, and included in its ranks Lord Byron and Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville.\" Umut \u00d6zkinimli & Spyros Sofos ''Tormented by History: Nationalism in Greece and Turkey'' Columbia University Press (25 April 2008)</ref>===\n[[Image:Greek boy.jpg|thumb|235px|''Greek boy defending his wounded father'' by [[Ary Scheffer]], a French painter(1795\u20131858)]]\nIn 1798, as a hostage of the Turks in [[Ottoman Greece]], Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville had an uneasy view of the Greeks he encountered in the close entourage of his Ottoman guards. Not unlike Lord Byron who later, at his death in 1824, also became a symbol of philhellenism,<ref>''\"Byron had yet to die to make philhellenism generally acceptable\"'' William Plomer ''\"The Diamond of Jannina\"'' (Taplinger Publishing New York 1970)</ref> Pouqueville felt at first unsure of the Greeks' sincerity.<ref>\"By-the-bye, I rather suspect we shall be at right angles in our opinion of the Greeks; I have not quite made up my mind about them, but you I know are decisively inimical.\" Lord Byron's Correspondence ''\"Letter to Hobhouse\"(1805)''</ref>\n\nHowever, his work as the pashalic's physician in Tripolitza caused his Turkish escort to become gradually sparser and his frequent contacts with authentic Greeks made him appreciate their rich cultural background under a new light. Even though it was being suppressed by the seven generations long occupation of Greece by their Ottoman rulers, the Greek social identity appeared very much alive to Pouqueville and, as a fervent believer of the French revolution's [[humanism]], he soon developed a growing sympathy for the budding Greek resurgence.\n\nHis condition as a prisoner of the Turkish Sultan prevented him at the time to do more than bringing medical attention and treatment to the oppressed population, but his writings already showed a strong new current of intellectual and emotional support.<ref>\"For the references, I am indebted to Pouqueville (Voyage de la Grece)\" ''Modern Greek folklore and ancient Greek religion: a study in revivals'' by John Cuthbert Lawson (1898)</ref>\n\nHis humane survey of Greece as early as 1798 is the 19th century's earliest manifestation of the [[philhellene]] movement. His impulse soon spread throughout Europe with the wide publication of his books setting in motion a constant trend amongst the greatest minds of the time to follow his steps across the newly revealed land of Greece.\n\nThe antique nation's rebirth ensued over the next decades with its war of independence and its liberation, with the break-up of the Ottoman Empire.<ref>''At the time, Greece was little known and was considered a Turkish province.

In addition he served with the Napoleonic forces in Egypt, then was, in turn, a prisoner of the Barbary pirates and the Turks. He lived as a prisoner in Greece.

To this you replied through your own interpreter, Mr Barthelemy, that as long as the British Government would observe a neutrality in the contest, between us and the Turks, you would remain an indifferent spectator, without taking part with either the one or the other. Notwithstanding this declaration, we state, with great pain, that we have obtained uncontroversible proofs that your conduit has not been conformable to your profession of neutrality. From the commencement of the contest you have constantly observed all our motions and resolutions for the purpose of informing our enemies. When the packet-boat from Malta, commanded by Mr Hunter, arrived at Patras, you sent to Prevesa to urge the Captain-Bey to send immediate succour to the Turks at Patras; and the captain-Bey, in fact, dispatched a brig, a corvette and a galley. You wrote also to the Pachas assembled before Jannina who sent Yusuf Pacha and the Kihaya of Mahmoud Pacha, with a considerable land armament. And, moreover, you continued to send to the Turks shut up in the citadel of Patras, intelligence of every thing that passed by means of persons devoted to your interest. We have more than once summoned you to pay our countrymen the sums due to them in consequence of your late purchases. Although the credit has expired, you still persis in refusing the payment*. You have, besides, sent your brother and your interpreter, who conducted Yussuf Pacha hither and acquainted him with the places by which he could most easily enter the citadel: you prepared and communicated yourself to the Turks the distinctive sign of the cross by which the Greeks recognize each other, that the Turks might attack us more advantageously under this disguise. Finally, you advised the Turks to light in the City of Patras that terrible fire by which all the goods in private houses, and the warehouses of the Company of Merchants have been destroyed. Immediately after the conflagration, the city was pillaged by the Turks and more particularly by those attached to your person. Thus, you have violated the rights of nations, and followed a conduct contrary to that prescribed by the declaration of neutrality made by your Government and yourself. You have occasioned losses amounting to several millions; you have exposed several Christians to death and captivity. By these presents we protest against you, in order that, at a suitable time, you may be called upon to render an account of all the disasters occasioned by you in contempt of the laws.

It was represented to him, that a Greek, of the name of Berouka, aged 76, his wife, three married daughters, and their children, forming altogether a family of 15 or 16 persons, had, after the massacre of Patras, from which they had escaped through the intervention of the French Consul, M. de Pouqueville, taken refuge in the island of Ithaca. These persons lived there in quiet until March last, when an order came from the Lord High Commissioner, directing them to depart out of the Ionian Islands. The unfortunate Greeks represented that they had, during their residence in the island, always conducted themselves in a proper manner, and entreated that they might be permitted to stay. The order for their departure was, however, iterated. The family next requested that they might be allowed to delay their departure until the sea which at that time was crowded with corsairs, should be in some degree cleared of these pirates; but even this indulgence was not conceded to them. The result was that almost immediately after they had set sail, they were attacked by an Algerine corsair, and after a short resistance, during which the old man was desperately wounded in the face, captured, carried into Algiers, and sold for slaves.

The Pope having met him at the Villa Albani, deigned to honour with his benediction the preserver of so many thousands of Christians; and it is not doubted, that if his voice could be heard at the Congress of Verona, it would induce Sovereigns to interest themselves in the cause of the Greeks. M. Pouqueville is said to be going to Marseilles.''</ref> Fran\u00e7ois Pouqueville saw his support to the Greek war of independence resulting in the French navy taking part in the [[Battle of Navarino]] on 20 October 1827, a naval victory which sealed the end of the 360 years of Turkish occupation of Greece, and in 1828, in the expulsion by the French troops of the Turkish garrison that had been holding on to the [[History of Patras|Patras citadel]].<ref>General [[Yannis Makriyannis|Makriyannis]], Memoirs (Excerpts).

Under the direction of the Translation Services Department, translation of the Old Testament in a particular language may be completed in as little as two years. During the period from 1963 to 1989, the ''New World Translation'' became available in ten additional languages. Since the formation of the Translation Services Department in 1989, there has been a significant increase in the number of languages in which the ''New World Translation'' has been made available.<ref name=translation>A Milestone for Lovers of God's Word (Watchtower October 15, 1999 pp. 30\u201331)</ref><ref name=\"YB 12, pg 26\">''2012 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'', p. 26</ref>\n\n=== 2013 revision ===\n\nAt the Watch Tower Society's annual meeting on October 5, 2013, a significantly revised translation was released.

The Hebrew texts, [[Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia]] and [[Biblia Hebraica Quinta]], were used for preparing the latest version of this translation. Other works consulted in preparing the translation include Aramaic [[Targum]]s, the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], the [[Samaritan Torah]], the Greek [[Septuagint]], the Latin [[Vulgate]], the [[Masoretic Text]], the [[Codex Cairensis|Cairo Codex]], the [[Aleppo Codex]], [[Christian David Ginsburg]]'s Hebrew Text, and the [[Leningrad Codex]].<ref name=\"autogenerated305\">[http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1101990132 \"All Scripture is Inspired of God and Beneficial\" 1990 pp. 305-314]</ref><ref>[http://www.jw.org/en/publications/bible/nwt/appendix-a/how-the-bible-came-to-us/ How the Bible Came to Us, Appendix A3 of 2013 REVISION]</ref>\n<gallery caption=\"Diagrammatic representation of textual basis\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:NWT-HS.jpg|Hebrew\nFile:NWT-GS.jpg|Greek\n</gallery>\n\nThe Greek master text by the [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] scholars [[Brooke Foss Westcott|B. F. Westcott]] and [[Fenton John Anthony Hort|F. J. A. Hort]] (1881) was used as the basis for translating the New Testament into English.{{sfn|Paul|2003|pp=85}} The committee also referred to the [[Novum Testamentum Graece]] (18th edition, 1948) and to works by Jesuit scholars Jos\u00e9 M. Bover (1943),{{sfn|Paul|2003|pp=85}} and Augustinus Merk (1948).{{sfn|Paul|2003|pp=85}} The [[United Bible Societies]]' text (1975) and the [[Erwin Nestle|Nestle]]-[[Kurt Aland|Aland]] text (1979) were used to update the footnotes in the 1984 version. Additional works consulted in preparing the ''New World Translation'' include the [[Armenian Bible translation|Armenian Version]], [[Coptic versions of the Bible|Coptic Versions]], the Latin Vulgate, [[Sixto-Clementine Vulgate|Sistine and Clementine Revised Latin Texts]], [[Textus Receptus]], the [[Johann Jakob Griesbach]]'s Greek text, the [[Emphatic Diaglott]], and various [[Papyrus#Collections of papyri|papyri]].<ref name=\"autogenerated305\"/>\n\n=== Other languages ===\nTranslation into other languages is based on the English text, supplemented by comparison with the Hebrew and Greek.<ref>Jehovah's Witnesses\u2014Proclaimers of God's Kingdom (1993) Chap. 27 p. 611, subheading Translation Into Other Languages.</ref> The complete ''New World Translation'' has been published in more than one hundred languages or [[writing system|scripts]], with the New Testament available in more than fifty additional languages.\n\nWhen the Writing Committee approves the translation of the Bible into a new language, it appoints a group of baptized Jehovah's Witnesses to serve as a translation team. Translators are given a list of words and expressions commonly used in the English ''New World Translation'' with related English words grouped together (e.g. ''atone'', ''atonement'' or ''propitiation''). A list of vernacular equivalents is then composed. A database of Greek and Hebrew terms is available where a translator has difficulty rendering a verse. The vernacular terms are then applied to the text in the target languages\n\n== Features ==\nThe layout resembles the 1901 edition of the [[American Standard Version]]. The translators use the terms \"Hebrew-Aramaic Scriptures\" and \"Christian Greek Scriptures\" rather than \"Old Testament\" and \"New Testament\", stating that the use of \"testament\" was based on a misunderstanding of 2 Corinthians 3:14.{{sfn|Chryssides|2009|pp=100}}<ref>Appendix 7E in the ''New World Translation'' reference edition</ref> Headings were included at the top of each page to assist in locating texts; these have been replaced in the 2013 revision by an \"Outline of Contents\" introducing each Bible book. There is also an index listing scriptures by subject.\n\nSquare brackets [ ] were added around words that were inserted editorially, but were removed as of the 2006 printing. Double brackets were used to indicate text considered doubtful. The pronoun \"you\" was printed in [[small capitals]] (i.e., <small>YOU</small>) to indicate plurality, as were some verbs when plurality may be unclear. These features were discontinued in the 2013 release. The ''New World Translation'' attempts to indicate progressive rather than completed actions, such as \"proceeded to rest\" at Genesis 2:2 instead of \"rested\". The 2013 release indicates progressive verbs only where considered contextually important.\n\n=== Use of ''Jehovah'' ===\n{{main|Jehovah}}\n{{see also|Names and titles of God in the New Testament}}\nThe name ''[[Jehovah]]'' is a translation of the [[Tetragrammaton]] ({{lang-he|\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4}}, transliterated as ''YHWH'', though the original pronunciation is unknown).

Kahle]] stated, \"We now know that the Greek Bible text as far as it was written by Jews for Jews did not translate the Divine name by [[Kyrios]], but the Tetragrammaton written with Hebrew or Greek letters was retained in such MSS (manuscripts). It was the Christians who replaced the Tetragrammaton by Kyrios, when the divine name written in Hebrew letters was not understood any more.\"<ref>''The Cairo Geniza'', Basil Blackwell, Oxford, 1959, p. 222</ref> However, according to professor Albert Pietersma, since pre-Christian times \u00ab adonai \u00bb and the Tetragrammaton where considered equivalent to the Greek term \u00ab kyrios \u00bb.

Translators are given a list of words and expressions commonly used in the English ''New World Translation'' with related English words grouped together (e.g. ''atone'', ''atonement'' or ''propitiation''). A list of vernacular equivalents is then composed. A database of Greek and Hebrew terms is available where a translator has difficulty rendering a verse. The vernacular terms are then applied to the text in the target language. Further editing and translation is then performed to produce a final version.<ref name=translation />\n\n== Features ==\nThe layout resembles the 1901 edition of the [[American Standard Version]]. The translators use the terms \"Hebrew-Aramaic Scriptures\" and \"Christian Greek Scriptures\" rather than \"Old Testament\" and \"New Testament\", stating that the use of \"testament\" was based on a misunderstanding of 2 Corinthians 3:14.{{sfn|Chryssides|2009|pp=100}}<ref>Appendix 7E in the ''New World Translation'' reference edition</ref> Headings were included at the top of each page to assist in locating texts; these have been replaced in the 2013 revision by an \"Outline of Contents\" introducing each Bible book. There is also an index listing scriptures by subject.\n\nSquare brackets [ ] were added around words that were inserted editorially, but were removed as of the 2006 printing. Double brackets were used to indicate text considered doubtful. The pronoun \"you\" was printed in [[small capitals]] (i.e., <small>YOU</small>) to indicate plurality, as were some verbs when plurality may be unclear. These features were discontinued in the 2013 release. The ''New World Translation'' attempts to indicate progressive rather than completed actions, such as \"proceeded to rest\" at Genesis 2:2 instead of \"rested\".

More research is needed to understand the ability to generalize Margolis' and Fisher's findings.\n\nA two-year research initiative published in 2000 by [[AAUW]] found that \"Girls approach the computer as a \"tool\" useful primarily for what it can do; boys more often view the computer as a \"toy\" and/or an extension of the self. For boys, the computer is inherently interesting. Girls are interested in its instrumental possibilities, which may include its use as an artistic medium. They express scorn toward boys who confuse \"real\" power and power on a screen. \"I see a computer as a tool,\" a high school girl declares. \"You [might] go play Kung Fu Fighting, but in real life you are still a stupid little person living in a suburban way.\"<ref>AAUW Educational Foundation Commission on Technology, Gender, and Teacher Education (2000).

The MIT Press.</ref> has highlighted such factors as:\n\n* Undergraduate classroom teaching in which the \"weedout\" practices and policies privileging competition over cooperation tend to advantage men.\n* Laboratory climates in which women are seen as foreign and not belonging at best, and experience blatant hostility and sexism at worst.\n* Well-meaning people who unwittingly create [[stereotype threat]] by reminding students that \"women can do computing as well as men\".\n* Strong resistance to changing the system in which these and other subtle practices are continuously reproduced.\n\nJust like in the pre-college situation, solutions are most often implemented outside of the mainstream (e.g., providing role models, mentoring, and women's groups), which can also create the perception among women, their male peers, and their professors that to be successful, women need \"extra help\" to graduate. Most people do not realize that the \"extra help\" is not academic, but instead access to the kind of peer networks more readily available to male students. Many women decline to participate in these extracurricular support groups because they do not want to appear deficient. In short, the conditions under which women (and underrepresented minority students) study computing are not the same as those experienced by men.\n\n===Lack of acknowledgment and promotion of skills===\nThe need for experience helped women a lot better than the requirement of a college degree.<ref name=\":09\">{{Cite book|last=Abbate, Janet.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/978591547|title=Recoding gender : women's changing participation in computing|date=2017|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-53453-3|edition=First MIT Press paperback edition|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=978591547}}</ref> They had more chances of gaining experience at a workplace than attaining a college degree.<ref name=\":010\">{{Cite book|last=Abbate, Janet.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/978591547|title=Recoding gender : women's changing participation in computing|date=2017|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-53453-3|edition=First MIT Press paperback edition|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=978591547}}</ref> \n\nWomen in technical roles often feel that the skills and feedback they bring to their jobs are not valued. According to a Catalyst report called \"Women in Technology: Maximizing Talent, Minimizing Barriers\", 65% of females in technical roles felt that those they reported to were receptive and responsive to their suggestions, as compared to 75% of women in non-technical roles.<ref name=\"catalyst.org\">Foust-Cummings, Heather; Sabattini, Laura; Carter, Nancy (2008). [http://www.catalyst.org/publication/36/women-in-technology-maximizing-talent-minimizing-barriers \"Women in Technology: Maximizing Talent, Minimizing Barriers\"]. Catalyst.</ref> This also speaks directly to the retention of females in the industry as females will commonly leave a company when they feel that what they are offering a company is not valued.<ref name=\"catalyst.org\" /> The report shows the concerns felt about this by sharing the following quote from an interviewee: \"I would like to be involved with more projects than I am currently involved in; I feel that I am being underutilized. I would prefer my supervisor give me an opportunity to expand my skill sets and my responsibility at work\".<ref name=\"catalyst.org\" />\n\nHowever, it is not enough to just acknowledge skills. Women also lack the support and advocacy needed to promote these skills.<ref name=\"catalyst.org 2\">(2003). [http://www.catalyst.org/publication/17/bit-by-bit-catalysts-guide-to-advancing-women-in-high-tech-companies \"Bit by Bit: Catalyst's Guide to Advancing Women in High Tech Companies\"].

Through this study they concluded that the image of computer science majors that is most prevalent in popular culture and in the minds of current undergraduates is someone who is highly intelligent, primarily obsessed with computers, and socially unskilled. This image can be considered to contrast with the more people-oriented, traditionally feminine image. According to this study, students continue to generate and propagate this stereotype when asked to describe people in computer science. Based on the results of their experiment based on this idea, they took a group of women and men undergraduates and had them read a stereotypical article and a non-stereotypical article. They found that women who read the non-stereotypical article were much more interested in computer science than those who read the article with the above-mentioned stereotypical computer science student.  Overall, they concluded that the underrepresentation of women in computing is not due to women's lack of interest. The study contests the perception that college major decisions are free choices, instead they discuss the implications that the major decisions are more constrained by the prevalent stereotypes. This has a negative consequence such that it prevents women from developing an interest in these technical fields. The finding suggests that the stereotypical image of the computer scientists is unattractive to women who would otherwise be interested if presented with a true representation or role model from the computer science field.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cheryan | first1 = Sapna |display-authors=etal | year = 2013 | title = The Stereotypical Computer Scientist: Gendered Media Representations As A Barrier To Inclusion For Women | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 69 | issue = 1/2| page = 58 | doi=10.1007/s11199-013-0296-x}}</ref>\n\nRacial stereotyping is also an issue, as computer scientists can often be thought of as white or Asian males, which can make it difficult for people who fall outside of those ethnicities to get hired.

Programs like all-girl computer camps, girls' after-school computer clubs, and support groups for girls have been instilled to create more interest at a younger age.<ref name=\"ramsey\"/> A specific example of this kind of program is the [[Canadian Information Processing Society]] outreach program, in which a representative is sent to schools in Canada, speaking specifically to grade nine girls about the benefits of Information Technology careers. The purpose is to inform girls about the benefits and opportunities within the field of information technology.<ref>[http://www.cips.ca/women \"Women in IT\"], Canada's Association of IT Professionals.</ref> Companies like [[IBM]] also encourage young women to become interested in engineering, technology and science. IBM offers EX.I.T.E. (Exploring Interests in Technology and Engineering) camps for young women from the ages of 11 to 13.\n\nAdditionally, attempts are being made to make the efforts of female computer scientists more visible through events such as the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women conference series which allows women in the field to meet, collaborate and present their work. In the U.S., the Association for Women in Computing was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1978. Its purpose is to provide opportunities for the professional growth of women in computing through networking, and through programs on technical and career-oriented topics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awc-hq.org/home.html |title=Association for Women in Computing |publisher=Awc-hq.org |accessdate=2013-10-02}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, the [[British Computer Society]] (BCS) and other organizations have groups which promote the cause of women in computing, such as [[BCSWomen]], founded by [[Sue Black (computer scientist)|Sue Black]], and the BCS Women's Forum.

Their goal is to help to create academic and work environments that are welcoming and fair for women. Their research shows that encouragement is one of the key elements to help women enter a primarily male-dominated field. They found women report more often than their male-counterpart that they entered computer science due to the influence of a teacher, family member, or friend's encouragement. Their findings conclude that support can make the difference in a woman's belief that she is competent enough to compete in computing. Thus, the NCWIT developed a program called Aspirations in Computing in order to provide girls with the necessary encouragement, a network of support, and female role models. In a survey done, nearly half of the girls polled said they would feel uncomfortable being the only girl in a group or class, one of the Aspirations main goals is to enable girls to feel less isolated in these predicaments. They have found that creating a sense of belonging or \"fitting in\" is fundamental for interest and current retention. The NCWIT Aspirations Award was created in order to involve women in a national competition, awardees are selected for their computing and IT aptitude, leadership skills, academics, and plans for graduate schooling. Due to their reach and awareness of the program, they saw a 54% increase in the girls applying in the 2013 season compared to the previous year.<ref>DuBow, Wendy M., et al. \"Bringing Young Women Into Computing Through The NCWIT Aspirationgs In Computing Program.\" Communications of the ACM 56.12 (2013): 34-37.

Through this program, twenty-four academic and corporate organizations added close to 1,000 \"Net New Women\" to the field of computer science by 2012. These Net New Women are women in the sciences that had not originally intended on pursuing a computer science degree. Pacesetters is the first program of its kind where different organizations come together to identify effective ways to broaden the participation of women in computer science. There are currently more than 300 corporations, academic institutions, government agencies and non-profit organizations devoted to this cause. Together they build internal teams in order to develop and fund the needed programs and share their overall results. Pacesetters organizations include some very prestigious companies such as AT&T, Intel, Microsoft, Google, Georgia Tech, Pfizer, and IBM to name a few. These are a few examples of their results due to the work with Pacesetters:\n\n*[[Google]]: built a new programs for undergraduate women and held a career development panel of engineers which gave women the chance to participate in mock interviews. Due to these efforts, the number of women applicants grew and Google doubled the number of women in their software engineering summer internship program in 2011 compared to 2010.\n*[[Intel]]: piloted a program called Command Presence Workshop in which senior technical women participated in specialized training,\n*[[Virginia Tech]]: created a team of CS faculty, advisors, and student mentors to interact with potential female undergraduates and high school students. They saw a 56% increase in the number of female students who showed interest in their science programs.\n<ref>\"Improving Gender Composition in Computing.\" Communications Of The ACM 55.4 (2012): 29-31.Business Source Premier.

McGrath Cohoon, senior research scientist for the National Center for Women & Information Technology, there are a few possible hypotheses for why women are underrepresented in computer sciences attributed to already established theories about the influence of gender and technology stereotypes. One gender related hypothesis is that women find it more difficult than men to contribute to the intellectual life of the field in the sense that reviewers of their work are unconsciously downgraded due to their status as women, or those women have lower confidence in this field that inhibits women's willingness to publicly present their technical findings. Due to this barrier of women as second-class citizens in the computing world, it creates an environment that is not accessible to women.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cohoon| first1 =  J.

Their findings reported that the most important factor in recruiting women to the computer science field is that women meet with a potential role model, regardless of gender of that role model, that conveys to the woman a sense of belonging in the field. This finding suggests that support and encouragement are the two most important aspects that can influence women participation in computing. In order for women to be more receptive to the field is if the environment became a more welcoming place by their male counterparts.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cheryan | first1 = Sapna | last2 = Drury | first2 = Benjamin J. | last3 = Vichayapai | first3 = Marissa | year = 2013 | title = Enduring Influence Of Stereotypical Computer Science Role Models on Women's Academic Aspirations | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 72\u201379 | doi=10.1177/0361684312459328}}</ref>\n\n[[Cordelia Fine]] in her book [[Delusions of Gender]] argues that apparent differences are due to constant exposure to societal beliefs of gender difference. Fine also argues that \"...while social effects on sex differences are well-established, spurious results, poor methodologies and untested assumptions mean we don't yet know whether, on average, males and females are born differently predisposed to systemizing versus empathising.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Forum {{!}} The Psychologist|url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-23/edition-12/forum|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Letters {{!}} The Psychologist|url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-1/letters|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Letters {{!}} The Psychologist|url = http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-2/letters|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}</ref>\n\nAnother argument for why women are less prevalent in computer science is the ill-defined nature of computing, according to Paul De Palma. In his article, \"Why Women Avoid Computer Science,\" he postulates that women find careers in computing unattractive. He finds that among the many reasons offered, he believes the nature of computing is what drives them away. He claims that young men who are drawn to computer science and engineering are those that like to tinker, those who like to use tools to create and dismantle objects. He further claims that computing is not a true profession, that traditional career paths such as law, business, and medicine are more certain and profitable on average than computing. He compares it to using a computer, computers nowadays do not come with lengthy manuals on the inner workings of the modern day computer, in fact our tools are always more complicated than their what they are used for, thus the tinkering nature of men, the drive born from gender stereotyping from birth, has made men successful in this field for they are more inclined to spend endless hours of tinkering with software and hardware. His claim revolves around the focus that boys and girls fall into gender stereotypes, girls who are usually given dolls and boys who are given trucks and toy tool boxes. He claims that these gender roles placed on children is one of the primary causes for the gender gap seen in computer science. He postulates that if we were to see more girls playing with trucks and other \"boy-related\" toys that perhaps we would see an increase in this tinkering nature and therefore, more participation of women in the computer science field.<ref>De Palma, Paul. \"Why Women Avoid Computer Science.\" Communications Of the ACM 44.6 (2001): 27-29.

More research is needed to understand the ability to generalize Margolis' and Fisher's findings.\n\nA two-year research initiative published in 2000 by [[AAUW]] found that \"Girls approach the computer as a \"tool\" useful primarily for what it can do; boys more often view the computer as a \"toy\" and/or an extension of the self. For boys, the computer is inherently interesting. Girls are interested in its instrumental possibilities, which may include its use as an artistic medium. They express scorn toward boys who confuse \"real\" power and power on a screen. \"I see a computer as a tool,\" a high school girl declares. \"You [might] go play Kung Fu Fighting, but in real life you are still a stupid little person living in a suburban way.\"<ref>AAUW Educational Foundation Commission on Technology, Gender, and Teacher Education (2000).

The MIT Press.</ref> has highlighted such factors as:\n\n* Undergraduate classroom teaching in which the \"weedout\" practices and policies privileging competition over cooperation tend to advantage men.\n* Laboratory climates in which women are seen as foreign and not belonging at best, and experience blatant hostility and sexism at worst.\n* Well-meaning people who unwittingly create [[stereotype threat]] by reminding students that \"women can do computing as well as men\".\n* Strong resistance to changing the system in which these and other subtle practices are continuously reproduced.\n\nJust like in the pre-college situation, solutions are most often implemented outside of the mainstream (e.g., providing role models, mentoring, and women's groups), which can also create the perception among women, their male peers, and their professors that to be successful, women need \"extra help\" to graduate. Most people do not realize that the \"extra help\" is not academic, but instead access to the kind of peer networks more readily available to male students. Many women decline to participate in these extracurricular support groups because they do not want to appear deficient. In short, the conditions under which women (and underrepresented minority students) study computing are not the same as those experienced by men.\n\n===Lack of acknowledgment and promotion of skills===\nThe need for experience helped women a lot better than the requirement of a college degree.<ref name=\":09\">{{Cite book|last=Abbate, Janet.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/978591547|title=Recoding gender : women's changing participation in computing|date=2017|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-53453-3|edition=First MIT Press paperback edition|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=978591547}}</ref> They had more chances of gaining experience at a workplace than attaining a college degree.<ref name=\":010\">{{Cite book|last=Abbate, Janet.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/978591547|title=Recoding gender : women's changing participation in computing|date=2017|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-53453-3|edition=First MIT Press paperback edition|location=Cambridge, Mass.|oclc=978591547}}</ref> \n\nWomen in technical roles often feel that the skills and feedback they bring to their jobs are not valued. According to a Catalyst report called \"Women in Technology: Maximizing Talent, Minimizing Barriers\", 65% of females in technical roles felt that those they reported to were receptive and responsive to their suggestions, as compared to 75% of women in non-technical roles.<ref name=\"catalyst.org\">Foust-Cummings, Heather; Sabattini, Laura; Carter, Nancy (2008). [http://www.catalyst.org/publication/36/women-in-technology-maximizing-talent-minimizing-barriers \"Women in Technology: Maximizing Talent, Minimizing Barriers\"]. Catalyst.</ref> This also speaks directly to the retention of females in the industry as females will commonly leave a company when they feel that what they are offering a company is not valued.<ref name=\"catalyst.org\" /> The report shows the concerns felt about this by sharing the following quote from an interviewee: \"I would like to be involved with more projects than I am currently involved in; I feel that I am being underutilized. I would prefer my supervisor give me an opportunity to expand my skill sets and my responsibility at work\".<ref name=\"catalyst.org\" />\n\nHowever, it is not enough to just acknowledge skills. Women also lack the support and advocacy needed to promote these skills.<ref name=\"catalyst.org 2\">(2003). [http://www.catalyst.org/publication/17/bit-by-bit-catalysts-guide-to-advancing-women-in-high-tech-companies \"Bit by Bit: Catalyst's Guide to Advancing Women in High Tech Companies\"]. Catalyst.</ref> Women feel alone and at a loss because they lack role models, networks, and mentors.<ref name=\"catalyst.org 2\"/> These support systems not only help women develop talent and opportunities for career advancement, but they are also needed to promote women to more senior roles.<ref name=\"catalyst.org 2\"/> It can be understood that advocacy is a major player in the advancement of females into senior tech roles.\n\n===Stereotyping computer scientists===\nOther research examines that undergraduates' stereotype of the people in computer science and how changing this stereotype through media can influence women's interest in computer science. Through this study they concluded that the image of computer science majors that is most prevalent in popular culture and in the minds of current undergraduates is someone who is highly intelligent, primarily obsessed with computers, and socially unskilled. This image can be considered to contrast with the more people-oriented, traditionally feminine image. According to this study, students continue to generate and propagate this stereotype when asked to describe people in computer science. Based on the results of their experiment based on this idea, they took a group of women and men undergraduates and had them read a stereotypical article and a non-stereotypical article. They found that women who read the non-stereotypical article were much more interested in computer science than those who read the article with the above-mentioned stereotypical computer science student.  Overall, they concluded that the underrepresentation of women in computing is not due to women's lack of interest. The study contests the perception that college major decisions are free choices, instead they discuss the implications that the major decisions are more constrained by the prevalent stereotypes. This has a negative consequence such that it prevents women from developing an interest in these technical fields. The finding suggests that the stereotypical image of the computer scientists is unattractive to women who would otherwise be interested if presented with a true representation or role model from the computer science field.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cheryan | first1 = Sapna |display-authors=etal | year = 2013 | title = The Stereotypical Computer Scientist: Gendered Media Representations As A Barrier To Inclusion For Women | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 69 | issue = 1/2| page = 58 | doi=10.1007/s11199-013-0296-x}}</ref>\n\nRacial stereotyping is also an issue, as computer scientists can often be thought of as white or Asian males, which can make it difficult for people who fall outside of those ethnicities to get hired.

Programs like all-girl computer camps, girls' after-school computer clubs, and support groups for girls have been instilled to create more interest at a younger age.<ref name=\"ramsey\"/> A specific example of this kind of program is the [[Canadian Information Processing Society]] outreach program, in which a representative is sent to schools in Canada, speaking specifically to grade nine girls about the benefits of Information Technology careers. The purpose is to inform girls about the benefits and opportunities within the field of information technology.<ref>[http://www.cips.ca/women \"Women in IT\"], Canada's Association of IT Professionals.</ref> Companies like [[IBM]] also encourage young women to become interested in engineering, technology and science. IBM offers EX.I.T.E. (Exploring Interests in Technology and Engineering) camps for young women from the ages of 11 to 13.\n\nAdditionally, attempts are being made to make the efforts of female computer scientists more visible through events such as the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women conference series which allows women in the field to meet, collaborate and present their work. In the U.S., the Association for Women in Computing was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1978. Its purpose is to provide opportunities for the professional growth of women in computing through networking, and through programs on technical and career-oriented topics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awc-hq.org/home.html |title=Association for Women in Computing |publisher=Awc-hq.org |accessdate=2013-10-02}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, the [[British Computer Society]] (BCS) and other organizations have groups which promote the cause of women in computing, such as [[BCSWomen]], founded by [[Sue Black (computer scientist)|Sue Black]], and the BCS Women's Forum.

Their goal is to help to create academic and work environments that are welcoming and fair for women. Their research shows that encouragement is one of the key elements to help women enter a primarily male-dominated field. They found women report more often than their male-counterpart that they entered computer science due to the influence of a teacher, family member, or friend's encouragement. Their findings conclude that support can make the difference in a woman's belief that she is competent enough to compete in computing. Thus, the NCWIT developed a program called Aspirations in Computing in order to provide girls with the necessary encouragement, a network of support, and female role models. In a survey done, nearly half of the girls polled said they would feel uncomfortable being the only girl in a group or class, one of the Aspirations main goals is to enable girls to feel less isolated in these predicaments. They have found that creating a sense of belonging or \"fitting in\" is fundamental for interest and current retention. The NCWIT Aspirations Award was created in order to involve women in a national competition, awardees are selected for their computing and IT aptitude, leadership skills, academics, and plans for graduate schooling. Due to their reach and awareness of the program, they saw a 54% increase in the girls applying in the 2013 season compared to the previous year.<ref>DuBow, Wendy M., et al. \"Bringing Young Women Into Computing Through The NCWIT Aspirationgs In Computing Program.\" Communications of the ACM 56.12 (2013): 34-37.

The organization was founded at Stanford University by now-alumnae Ellora Israni and Ayna Agarwal, who spearheaded the organization's inaugural conference in April 2012. The conference featured female speakers who held tech positions in companies like Google, Pinterest, and Facebook and was well attended. The conference inspired its organizers to continue with and expand upon she++ and now facilitates participation initiatives through hosting additional events such as a 2013 conference, curating a video library that features inspirational stories from technology professionals, and by offering a mentorship program.

Through this program, twenty-four academic and corporate organizations added close to 1,000 \"Net New Women\" to the field of computer science by 2012. These Net New Women are women in the sciences that had not originally intended on pursuing a computer science degree. Pacesetters is the first program of its kind where different organizations come together to identify effective ways to broaden the participation of women in computer science. There are currently more than 300 corporations, academic institutions, government agencies and non-profit organizations devoted to this cause. Together they build internal teams in order to develop and fund the needed programs and share their overall results. Pacesetters organizations include some very prestigious companies such as AT&T, Intel, Microsoft, Google, Georgia Tech, Pfizer, and IBM to name a few. These are a few examples of their results due to the work with Pacesetters:\n\n*[[Google]]: built a new programs for undergraduate women and held a career development panel of engineers which gave women the chance to participate in mock interviews. Due to these efforts, the number of women applicants grew and Google doubled the number of women in their software engineering summer internship program in 2011 compared to 2010.\n*[[Intel]]: piloted a program called Command Presence Workshop in which senior technical women participated in specialized training,\n*[[Virginia Tech]]: created a team of CS faculty, advisors, and student mentors to interact with potential female undergraduates and high school students. They saw a 56% increase in the number of female students who showed interest in their science programs.\n<ref>\"Improving Gender Composition in Computing.\" Communications Of The ACM 55.4 (2012): 29-31.Business Source Premier.

McGrath Cohoon, senior research scientist for the National Center for Women & Information Technology, there are a few possible hypotheses for why women are underrepresented in computer sciences attributed to already established theories about the influence of gender and technology stereotypes. One gender related hypothesis is that women find it more difficult than men to contribute to the intellectual life of the field in the sense that reviewers of their work are unconsciously downgraded due to their status as women, or those women have lower confidence in this field that inhibits women's willingness to publicly present their technical findings. Due to this barrier of women as second-class citizens in the computing world, it creates an environment that is not accessible to women.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cohoon| first1 =  J.

Their findings reported that the most important factor in recruiting women to the computer science field is that women meet with a potential role model, regardless of gender of that role model, that conveys to the woman a sense of belonging in the field. This finding suggests that support and encouragement are the two most important aspects that can influence women participation in computing. In order for women to be more receptive to the field is if the environment became a more welcoming place by their male counterparts.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cheryan | first1 = Sapna | last2 = Drury | first2 = Benjamin J. | last3 = Vichayapai | first3 = Marissa | year = 2013 | title = Enduring Influence Of Stereotypical Computer Science Role Models on Women's Academic Aspirations | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 72\u201379 | doi=10.1177/0361684312459328}}</ref>\n\n[[Cordelia Fine]] in her book [[Delusions of Gender]] argues that apparent differences are due to constant exposure to societal beliefs of gender difference. Fine also argues that \"...while social effects on sex differences are well-established, spurious results, poor methodologies and untested assumptions mean we don't yet know whether, on average, males and females are born differently predisposed to systemizing versus empathising.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Forum {{!}} The Psychologist|url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-23/edition-12/forum|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Letters {{!}} The Psychologist|url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-1/letters|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Letters {{!}} The Psychologist|url = http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-2/letters|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}</ref>\n\nAnother argument for why women are less prevalent in computer science is the ill-defined nature of computing, according to Paul De Palma. In his article, \"Why Women Avoid Computer Science,\" he postulates that women find careers in computing unattractive. He finds that among the many reasons offered, he believes the nature of computing is what drives them away. He claims that young men who are drawn to computer science and engineering are those that like to tinker, those who like to use tools to create and dismantle objects. He further claims that computing is not a true profession, that traditional career paths such as law, business, and medicine are more certain and profitable on average than computing. He compares it to using a computer, computers nowadays do not come with lengthy manuals on the inner workings of the modern day computer, in fact our tools are always more complicated than their what they are used for, thus the tinkering nature of men, the drive born from gender stereotyping from birth, has made men successful in this field for they are more inclined to spend endless hours of tinkering with software and hardware. His claim revolves around the focus that boys and girls fall into gender stereotypes, girls who are usually given dolls and boys who are given trucks and toy tool boxes. He claims that these gender roles placed on children is one of the primary causes for the gender gap seen in computer science. He postulates that if we were to see more girls playing with trucks and other \"boy-related\" toys that perhaps we would see an increase in this tinkering nature and therefore, more participation of women in the computer science field.<ref>De Palma, Paul. \"Why Women Avoid Computer Science.\" Communications Of the ACM 44.6 (2001): 27-29.

The war was fought mainly in Silesia, [[Bohemia]], and [[Upper Saxony]] and formed one [[theatre (warfare)|theatre]] of the wider [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. It was the second of three [[Silesian Wars]] fought between [[Frederick the Great]]'s Prussia and [[Maria Theresa]]'s Austria in the mid-18th century, all three of which ended in Prussian control of Silesia.\n\nThe conflict has been viewed as a continuation of the [[First Silesian War]], which had concluded only two years before. After the [[Treaty of Berlin (1742)|Treaty of Berlin]] ended hostilities between Austria and Prussia in 1742, the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]'s fortunes improved greatly in the continuing War of the Austrian Succession. As Austria expanded its alliances with the 1743 [[Treaty of Worms (1743)|Treaty of Worms]], Prussia entered a renewed alliance with Austria's enemies in the [[League of Frankfurt]] and rejoined the war, hoping to prevent a resurgent Austria from taking back Silesia.\n\nThe war began with a Prussian invasion of Habsburg Bohemia in mid-1744, and ended in a Prussian victory with the [[Treaty of Dresden]] in December 1745, which confirmed Prussian control of Silesia.

The war was fought mainly in Silesia, [[Bohemia]], and [[Upper Saxony]] and formed one [[theatre (warfare)|theatre]] of the wider [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. It was the second of three [[Silesian Wars]] fought between [[Frederick the Great]]'s Prussia and [[Maria Theresa]]'s Austria in the mid-18th century, all three of which ended in Prussian control of Silesia.\n\nThe conflict has been viewed as a continuation of the [[First Silesian War]], which had concluded only two years before. After the [[Treaty of Berlin (1742)|Treaty of Berlin]] ended hostilities between Austria and Prussia in 1742, the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]'s fortunes improved greatly in the continuing War of the Austrian Succession. As Austria expanded its alliances with the 1743 [[Treaty of Worms (1743)|Treaty of Worms]], Prussia entered a renewed alliance with Austria's enemies in the [[League of Frankfurt]] and rejoined the war, hoping to prevent a resurgent Austria from taking back Silesia.\n\nThe war began with a Prussian invasion of Habsburg Bohemia in mid-1744, and ended in a Prussian victory with the [[Treaty of Dresden]] in December 1745, which confirmed Prussian control of Silesia. Continuing conflict over Silesia would draw Austria and Prussia into a [[Third Silesian War]] a decade later. The Second Silesian War repeated the defeat of the Habsburg Monarchy by a lesser German power and contributed to the [[Austria\u2013Prussia rivalry]] that shaped German politics for more than a century.\n\n==Context and causes==\n===First Silesian War===\n{{Main|First Silesian War}}\n[[File:Maria Theresia of Austria Tuerkisch.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait painting of a young Maria Theresa|[[Maria Theresa]] of Austria {{circa|1744}}, by [[Martin van Meytens]]]]\n[[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI]] of [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] died in 1740 without a male heir; he was succeeded by his eldest daughter, who became ruler of the [[Archduchy of Austria]], as well as of the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Hungarian]] lands within the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], as Archduchess [[Maria Theresa]].<ref>{{Harvp|Asprey|1986|p=24}}</ref> During Emperor Charles VI's lifetime, this female succession was generally acknowledged by the [[imperial state]]s, but when he died it was promptly contested by several parties.<ref>{{Harvp|Clifford|1914|p=3100}}</ref> The newly crowned King [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II]] of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] took this Austrian succession crisis as an opportunity to press his dynasty's territorial claims in the Habsburg [[crown land]] of [[Silesia]], invading in December 1740 and beginning the [[First Silesian War]].<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|p=183}}</ref>\n\nAfter early Prussian successes, other powers were emboldened to attack the beleaguered Habsburg realm, widening the conflict into what became the [[War of the Austrian Succession]].<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|pp=193\u2013194}}</ref> Prussia, [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]] and others formed an alliance known as the [[League of Nymphenburg]] to support each other's efforts to seize Habsburg territory and Bavaria's bid for the [[imperial election of 1742|imperial election]].
