The original [[Czech language|Czech]] title of the work is ''Osudy dobr\u00e9ho voj\u00e1ka \u0160vejka za sv\u011btov\u00e9 v\u00e1lky'', literally ''The Fateful Adventures of the Good Soldier \u0160vejk During the World War''. \n\n\u0160vejk has become a [[Proverb|byword]] in the Czech Republic. The book is also the most [[translation|translated]] novel of [[Czech literature]]: it has been translated into over 50 languages.\n\n==Publication==\nHa\u0161ek originally intended ''\u0160vejk'' to cover a total of six volumes, but had completed only three (and started on the fourth) upon his death from [[heart failure]] on January 3, 1923. \n\nThe novel as a whole was originally illustrated (after Ha\u0161ek's death) by [[Josef Lada]] and more recently by Czech illustrator Petr Urban.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jare\u0161|first=Michal|author2=Tom\u00e1\u0161 Prok\u016fpek |title=Translated Title: The Good Soldier \u0160vejk and His Fortunes in the World War and Comics|journal=Czech Literature|year=2010|issue=5|pages=607\u2013625}}</ref>\n\nThe volumes are:\n# ''Behind the Lines'' (''V z\u00e1zem\u00ed'', 1921)\n# ''At the Front'' (''Na front\u011b'', 1922)\n# ''The Glorious Licking'' (''Slavn\u00fd v\u00fdprask'', 1922)\n# ''The Glorious Licking Continues'' (''Pokra\u010dov\u00e1n\u00ed slavn\u00e9ho v\u00fdprasku'', 1923; unfinished)\n\nFollowing Ha\u0161ek's death, journalist Karel Van\u011bk was asked by the publisher Adolf Synek to complete the unfinished novel. Van\u011bk finished the fourth book in 1923 and in the same year also released the fifth and the sixth volumes, titled ''\u0160vejk in Captivity'' (''\u0160vejk v zajet\u00ed'') and ''\u0160vejk in Revolution'' (''\u0160vejk v revoluci''). Novels were published until 1949. In 1991 volumes 5 and 6 were again released as ''\u0160vejk in Russian Captivity and Revolution'' (''\u0160vejk v Rusk\u00e9m zajet\u00ed a v revoluci''), in two volumes or combined.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u0160vejk v rusk\u00e9m zajet\u00ed a v revoluci 1/2|url=http://www.adplus.cz/173413-svejk-v-ruskem-zajeti-v-revoluci-12|website=Adplus.cz|language=cs}}</ref>\n\n==Themes==\nThe novel is set during [[World War I]] in [[Austria-Hungary]], a multi-ethnic empire full of [[Austria-Hungary#Ethnic relations|long-standing ethnic tensions]]. Fifteen million people died in the war, one million of them Austro-Hungarian soldiers including around 140,000 who were Czechs. Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek participated in this conflict and examined it in ''The Good Soldier \u0160vejk''.\n\nMany of the situations and characters seem to have been inspired, at least in part, by Ha\u0161ek's service in the 91st Infantry Regiment of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. The novel also deals with broader anti-war themes: essentially a series of absurdly comic episodes, it explores the pointlessness and futility of conflict in general and of military discipline, Austrian military discipline in particular. Many of its characters, especially the Czechs, are participating in a conflict they do not understand on behalf of an empire to which they have no loyalty.\n\nThe character of Josef \u0160vejk is a development of this theme. Through (possibly feigned) idiocy or incompetence he repeatedly manages to frustrate military authority and expose its stupidity in a form of [[passive resistance]]: the reader is left unclear, however, as to whether \u0160vejk is genuinely incompetent, or acting quite deliberately with [[dumb insolence]]. These absurd events reach a climax when \u0160vejk, wearing a Russian uniform, is mistakenly taken prisoner by his own side.\n\nIn addition to satirising [[Habsburg]] authority, Ha\u0161ek repeatedly sets out corruption and hypocrisy attributed to priests of the [[Catholic Church]].\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[Image:Svejk.jpg|thumb|Statue of Josef \u0160vejk in [[Sanok]], Poland]]\nThe story begins in Prague with news of the [[assassination in Sarajevo]] that precipitates [[World War I]].\n\n\u0160vejk displays such enthusiasm about faithfully serving the Austrian Emperor in battle that no one can decide whether he is merely an imbecile or is craftily undermining the war effort. He is arrested by a member of the state police, Bretschneider, after making some politically insensitive remarks, and is sent to prison. After being certified insane he is transferred to a madhouse, before being ejected.\n\n[[Image:2015 Przemy\u015bl, Pomnik J\u00f3zefa Szwejka na rynku.jpg|thumb|Statue of Josef \u0160vejk in [[Przemy\u015bl]], Poland.]]\n\u0160vejk gets his [[charwoman]] to wheel him (he claims to be suffering from [[rheumatism]]) to the recruitment offices in Prague, where his apparent zeal causes a minor sensation. He is transferred to a hospital for [[malingerer]]s because of his rheumatism. He finally joins the army as [[Batman (military)|batman]] to army [[chaplain]] Otto Katz; Katz loses him at cards to Senior Lieutenant Luk\u00e1\u0161, whose batman he then becomes.\n\nLuk\u00e1\u0161 is posted with his march battalion to barracks in [[\u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice]], in Southern Bohemia, preparatory to being sent to the front. After missing all the trains to Bud\u011bjovice, \u0160vejk embarks on a long [[wikt:anabasis|anabasis]] on foot around Southern Bohemia in a vain attempt to find Bud\u011bjovice, before being arrested as a possible spy and deserter (a charge he strenuously denies) and escorted to his regiment.\n\nThe regiment is soon transferred to [[Bruck an der Leitha]], a town on the border between Austria and Hungary. Here, where relations between the two nationalities are somewhat sensitive, \u0160vejk is again arrested, this time for causing an affray involving a respectable Hungarian citizen and engaging in a street fight. He is also promoted to company orderly.\n\nThe unit embarks on a long train journey towards [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] and the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]].  Close to the front line, \u0160vejk is taken prisoner by his own side as a suspected Russian deserter, after arriving at a lake and trying on an abandoned Russian uniform. Narrowly avoiding execution, he manages to rejoin his unit. The unfinished novel breaks off abruptly before \u0160vejk has a chance to be involved in any combat or enter the trenches, though it appears Ha\u0161ek may have conceived that the characters would have continued the war in a [[POW]] camp, much as he himself had done.\n\nThe book includes numerous anecdotes told by \u0160vejk (often either to deflect the attentions of an authority figure, or to insult them in a concealed manner) which are not directly related to the plot.\n\n==Selected characters==\n\nThe characters of ''The Good Soldier \u0160vejk'' are generally either used as the butt of Ha\u0161ek's absurdist humour or represent fairly broad social and ethnic stereotypes found in the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the time. People are often distinguished by the dialect and [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] of Czech or German they speak, a quality that does not translate easily. Many German- and Polish-speaking characters, for example, are shown as speaking comedically broken or heavily accented Czech, while many Czechs speak broken German; much use is also made of [[slang]] expressions.\n\nSome characters are to varying degrees based on real people who served with the [[K.u.K|Imperial and Royal]] 91st Infantry Regiment, in which Ha\u0161ek served as a one-year volunteer. (Much research has been conducted into this issue and the results are part of the [http://www.honsi.org/literature/svejk/?page=4&lang=en catalog of all 585 people], both real and fictitious, that appear in the novel.)\n\n;Josef \u0160vejk: The novel's hero: in civilian life a dealer in stolen dogs. Based partly on Franti\u0161ek Stra\u0161lipka, the young batman to Oberleutnant Rudolf Lukas, Ha\u0161ek's company commander.<ref>{{cite book|title=Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek: A study of \u0160vejk and the Short Stories|last1=Parrott|first1=Cecil|page=113|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GZltg9YugGUC&pg=PA114&lpg=PA114&dq=Svejk+based+on+jaroslave+stras&source=bl&ots=Z9SUeenyRg&sig=xr2OCJNiSW5-5PPe0RLqG3CDxHk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjPgLLgg8XSAhWEAcAKHTbECHsQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&q=Svejk%20based%20on%20jaroslave%20stras&f=false}}</ref>\n\n;Palivec: The foul-mouthed landlord of \u0160vejk's local pub \u2013 the \"U Kalicha\" (\"By the Chalice\") on Na Boji\u0161ti street, Prague. Despite refusal to discuss any politics (\"it smells of [[Pankr\u00e1c Prison|Pankr\u00e1c]]\") Palivec is eventually arrested by Bretschneider (see below) after commenting that flies shit on the portrait of [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] in the pub.\n;Police Agent Bretschneider: A secret policeman who repeatedly tries to catch \u0160vejk and others out on their anti-monarchist views. He is eventually eaten by his own dogs, after buying a succession of animals from \u0160vejk in an attempt to incriminate him.\n;Staff Warder Slav\u00edk: A cruel and corrupt prison official (revealed to have himself ended up in prison under the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Republic of Czechoslovakia]]).\n;[[Military chaplain]] Otto Katz: Has a fondness for drinking, especially good [[communion wine]], and gambling. \u0160vejk seems fond of Katz, but the latter loses the services of \u0160vejk to Lieutenant Luk\u00e1\u0161 in a game of cards.\n;[[Oberleutnant]] Luk\u00e1\u0161: \u0160vejk's long-suffering [[Company (military unit)|company]] commander. A Czech from South Bohemia, Luk\u00e1\u0161 is something of a womanizer but is depicted in a broadly sympathetic manner by Ha\u0161ek (the records of the real-life 91st Regiment show an Oberleutnant Rudolf Lukas \u2013 the same rank as the character \u2013 at the time of Ha\u0161ek's service; Ha\u0161ek admired Lukas and even wrote him a number of poems. Lukas was Ha\u0161ek's company commander.<ref name=parrottpxi>Parrott, C. \"Introduction\" to ''The Good Soldier Svejk'', Penguin, 1974, p. xi</ref>) Though \u0160vejk's actions eventually lead to Luk\u00e1\u0161' being labelled as a notorious philanderer in the Hungarian national press, he starts to miss \u0160vejk after the latter is promoted to company orderly.\n;Colonel Friedrich Kraus von Zillergut: An idiotic Austrian officer with a penchant for giving his colleagues long-winded, moronic explanations of everyday objects (such as thermometers and postage stamps) and situations; run over by a cart while attempting to demonstrate what a [[Sidewalk|pavement]] is. Kraus's dog is stolen by \u0160vejk as a gift for Luk\u00e1\u0161; the enraged colonel subsequently arranges Luk\u00e1\u0161's transfer to the front.\n;Captain S\u00e1gner: One of the regiment's professional officers and commander of \u0160vejk's [[march battalion]]; an ambitious careerist, he is later revealed to have been a closet Czech patriot in his youth. A Captain Vinzenz Sagner served in the 91st Regiment, where he was Ha\u0161ek's battalion commander.<ref name=\"parrottpxi\"/>\n;Colonel Schr\u00f6der: The bad-tempered [[colonel]] of \u0160vejk's regiment, and a caricature of typical German-speaking senior officers of the Austrian army.\n;Jurajda: The battalion's [[spiritualist]] cook; before military service he had edited an \"occultist\" journal. Spends time attempting to avoid frontline service through letters he is writing to his wife, in which he details meals he is intending to cook for senior officers.\n;2nd Lieutenant Dub: Dub is a Czech schoolmaster, reserve officer, and commander of the battalion's 3rd company: he has strongly monarchist views. As a conservative, pro-[[Habsburg]] Czech, Dub is the subject of some of Ha\u0161ek's most vicious satire. Repeatedly placed in humiliating situations, such as being found drunk in a [[brothel]] or falling off a horse (in all [[Slavic languages|Slavonic]] languages the word 'dub' ('oak') itself is a common synonym for a dull, idiotic person). He is said to have been based on a lieutenant of the reserve, Mech\u00e1lek, who served in Ha\u0161ek's regiment.<ref name=\"parrottpxi\"/>\n;Quartermaster Sergeant-Major Van\u011bk: Another recurring character, Van\u011bk (a chemist from [[Kralupy nad Vltavou]] in civilian life) is an example of an easy-going but self-serving senior [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]], whose main concern is to make his own existence as comfortable as possible. A Jan Van\u011bk served in Ha\u0161ek's regiment, and has some traits in common with the figure from the novel (domicile and occupation).<ref name=\"parrottpxi\"/>\n;Volunteer Marek: The character of one-year volunteer Marek is to some degree a self-portrait by the author, who was himself a one-year volunteer in the 91st. For example, Marek&nbsp;\u2013 like Ha\u0161ek&nbsp;\u2013 was fired from the editorship of a natural history magazine after writing articles about imaginary animals. Marek is appointed the battalion historian by S\u00e1gner and occupies himself with devising memorable and heroic deaths in advance for his colleagues.\n;[[First-Class Private]] Vodi\u010dka: A [[sapper]] friend of \u0160vejk noted mainly for his extreme hatred of [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], which leads to an unfortunate incident in [[Bruck an der Leitha]].\n;Lieutenant Biegler (Cadet Biegler): Biegler is a young junior officer with pretensions to nobility, despite being the middle-class son of a [[furrier]]. Biegler takes his military duties so seriously that he is ridiculed even by his senior officers, and is mistakenly hospitalised as a \"carrier of [[cholera]] germs\" after medical staff misdiagnose (for army PR reasons) a [[cognac]]-induced [[hangover]]. Cadet Biegler also had a real-life model in the 91st regiment (Cadet Johann Biegler, later lieutenant).<ref name=\"parrottpxi\"/>\n;Captain Tayrle: The brigade [[adjutant]] and a particularly disgusting example of a headquarters officer, whose interests appear to lie mainly in crude jokes and sampling of local [[prostitutes]].\n;General [[Fink von Finkenstein]]: An aristocratic, vicious and near-insane senior Austrian officer and commander of the garrison fort of [[Przemy\u015bl]], Fink treats his men with extreme brutality. He almost succeeds in having \u0160vejk executed after the latter is taken prisoner by his own side.\n;Chaplain Martinec: A chaplain plagued by drink-induced spiritual doubts, whose attempt to provide spiritual consolation to \u0160vejk ends in disaster.\n;\"Sergeant Teveles\": A man in possession of a silver [[Military Merit Medal (Austria\u2013Hungary)|Military Merit Medal]], purchased from a [[Bosnians|Bosnian]], and claiming to be a Sergeant Teveles, who had previously disappeared along with the entire 6th March Company during fighting in [[Belgrade]].\n;[[Private (rank)|Private]] Baloun: A [[miller]] from [[\u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov]] in civilian life, and \u0160vejk's successor as Luk\u00e1\u0161's [[batman (military)|batman]], Baloun is a glutton and is regularly punished for stealing Luk\u00e1\u0161's food. He eats raw dough, sausage skins, etc., when nothing else is available.\n\n==Literary significance and criticism==\nA number of literary critics consider ''The Good Soldier \u0160vejk'' to be one of the first anti-war novels, predating [[Erich Maria Remarque]]'s ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front]]''. [[Joseph Heller]] said that if he had not read ''The Good Soldier \u0160vejk'', he would never have written his novel ''[[Catch-22]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zenny.com/Heller.html |title=A personal testimony by Arno\u0161t Lustig |accessdate=2008-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Lustig |first=Arno\u0161t |authorlink=Arno\u0161t Lustig |title=3x18 (portr\u00e9ty a post\u0159ehy) |publisher=Nakladatelstv\u00ed Andrej \u0160\u0165astn\u00fd |year=2003 |language=Czech |isbn=80-903116-8-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/3x18portretypost0000lust/page/271 271] |url=https://archive.org/details/3x18portretypost0000lust/page/271 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=Chicago Tribune|title=Soldier of Misfortune|last1=Lauerman|first1=Connie|date=9 August 2000|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-08-09/features/0008090052_1_czech-republic-central-europe-war-front}}</ref>\n\n[[Sue Arnold]], writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', stated \"Every harassed negotiator, every beleaguered political wife and anyone given to ever-increasing moments of melancholy at the way things are should keep a copy of Hasek's classic 'don't let the bastards get you down' novel to hand.

Van\u011bk finished the fourth book in 1923 and in the same year also released the fifth and the sixth volumes, titled ''\u0160vejk in Captivity'' (''\u0160vejk v zajet\u00ed'') and ''\u0160vejk in Revolution'' (''\u0160vejk v revoluci''). Novels were published until 1949. In 1991 volumes 5 and 6 were again released as ''\u0160vejk in Russian Captivity and Revolution'' (''\u0160vejk v Rusk\u00e9m zajet\u00ed a v revoluci''), in two volumes or combined.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u0160vejk v rusk\u00e9m zajet\u00ed a v revoluci 1/2|url=http://www.adplus.cz/173413-svejk-v-ruskem-zajeti-v-revoluci-12|website=Adplus.cz|language=cs}}</ref>\n\n==Themes==\nThe novel is set during [[World War I]] in [[Austria-Hungary]], a multi-ethnic empire full of [[Austria-Hungary#Ethnic relations|long-standing ethnic tensions]]. Fifteen million people died in the war, one million of them Austro-Hungarian soldiers including around 140,000 who were Czechs. Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek participated in this conflict and examined it in ''The Good Soldier \u0160vejk''.\n\nMany of the situations and characters seem to have been inspired, at least in part, by Ha\u0161ek's service in the 91st Infantry Regiment of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. The novel also deals with broader anti-war themes: essentially a series of absurdly comic episodes, it explores the pointlessness and futility of conflict in general and of military discipline, Austrian military discipline in particular. Many of its characters, especially the Czechs, are participating in a conflict they do not understand on behalf of an empire to which they have no loyalty.\n\nThe character of Josef \u0160vejk is a development of this theme. Through (possibly feigned) idiocy or incompetence he repeatedly manages to frustrate military authority and expose its stupidity in a form of [[passive resistance]]: the reader is left unclear, however, as to whether \u0160vejk is genuinely incompetent, or acting quite deliberately with [[dumb insolence]]. These absurd events reach a climax when \u0160vejk, wearing a Russian uniform, is mistakenly taken prisoner by his own side.\n\nIn addition to satirising [[Habsburg]] authority, Ha\u0161ek repeatedly sets out corruption and hypocrisy attributed to priests of the [[Catholic Church]].\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[Image:Svejk.jpg|thumb|Statue of Josef \u0160vejk in [[Sanok]], Poland]]\nThe story begins in Prague with news of the [[assassination in Sarajevo]] that precipitates [[World War I]].\n\n\u0160vejk displays such enthusiasm about faithfully serving the Austrian Emperor in battle that no one can decide whether he is merely an imbecile or is craftily undermining the war effort. He is arrested by a member of the state police, Bretschneider, after making some politically insensitive remarks, and is sent to prison. After being certified insane he is transferred to a madhouse, before being ejected.\n\n[[Image:2015 Przemy\u015bl, Pomnik J\u00f3zefa Szwejka na rynku.jpg|thumb|Statue of Josef \u0160vejk in [[Przemy\u015bl]], Poland.]]\n\u0160vejk gets his [[charwoman]] to wheel him (he claims to be suffering from [[rheumatism]]) to the recruitment offices in Prague, where his apparent zeal causes a minor sensation. He is transferred to a hospital for [[malingerer]]s because of his rheumatism. He finally joins the army as [[Batman (military)|batman]] to army [[chaplain]] Otto Katz; Katz loses him at cards to Senior Lieutenant Luk\u00e1\u0161, whose batman he then becomes.\n\nLuk\u00e1\u0161 is posted with his march battalion to barracks in [[\u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice]], in Southern Bohemia, preparatory to being sent to the front. After missing all the trains to Bud\u011bjovice, \u0160vejk embarks on a long [[wikt:anabasis|anabasis]] on foot around Southern Bohemia in a vain attempt to find Bud\u011bjovice, before being arrested as a possible spy and deserter (a charge he strenuously denies) and escorted to his regiment.\n\nThe regiment is soon transferred to [[Bruck an der Leitha]], a town on the border between Austria and Hungary. Here, where relations between the two nationalities are somewhat sensitive, \u0160vejk is again arrested, this time for causing an affray involving a respectable Hungarian citizen and engaging in a street fight. He is also promoted to company orderly.\n\nThe unit embarks on a long train journey towards [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] and the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]].  Close to the front line, \u0160vejk is taken prisoner by his own side as a suspected Russian deserter, after arriving at a lake and trying on an abandoned Russian uniform. Narrowly avoiding execution, he manages to rejoin his unit. The unfinished novel breaks off abruptly before \u0160vejk has a chance to be involved in any combat or enter the trenches, though it appears Ha\u0161ek may have conceived that the characters would have continued the war in a [[POW]] camp, much as he himself had done.\n\nThe book includes numerous anecdotes told by \u0160vejk (often either to deflect the attentions of an authority figure, or to insult them in a concealed manner) which are not directly related to the plot.\n\n==Selected characters==\n\nThe characters of ''The Good Soldier \u0160vejk'' are generally either used as the butt of Ha\u0161ek's absurdist humour or represent fairly broad social and ethnic stereotypes found in the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the time. People are often distinguished by the dialect and [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] of Czech or German they speak, a quality that does not translate easily. Many German- and Polish-speaking characters, for example, are shown as speaking comedically broken or heavily accented Czech, while many Czechs speak broken German; much use is also made of [[slang]] expressions.\n\nSome characters are to varying degrees based on real people who served with the [[K.u.K|Imperial and Royal]] 91st Infantry Regiment, in which Ha\u0161ek served as a one-year volunteer. (Much research has been conducted into this issue and the results are part of the [http://www.honsi.org/literature/svejk/?page=4&lang=en catalog of all 585 people], both real and fictitious, that appear in the novel.)\n\n;Josef \u0160vejk: The novel's hero: in civilian life a dealer in stolen dogs.

Despite refusal to discuss any politics (\"it smells of [[Pankr\u00e1c Prison|Pankr\u00e1c]]\") Palivec is eventually arrested by Bretschneider (see below) after commenting that flies shit on the portrait of [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] in the pub.\n;Police Agent Bretschneider: A secret policeman who repeatedly tries to catch \u0160vejk and others out on their anti-monarchist views. He is eventually eaten by his own dogs, after buying a succession of animals from \u0160vejk in an attempt to incriminate him.\n;Staff Warder Slav\u00edk: A cruel and corrupt prison official (revealed to have himself ended up in prison under the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Republic of Czechoslovakia]]).\n;[[Military chaplain]] Otto Katz: Has a fondness for drinking, especially good [[communion wine]], and gambling. \u0160vejk seems fond of Katz, but the latter loses the services of \u0160vejk to Lieutenant Luk\u00e1\u0161 in a game of cards.\n;[[Oberleutnant]] Luk\u00e1\u0161: \u0160vejk's long-suffering [[Company (military unit)|company]] commander. A Czech from South Bohemia, Luk\u00e1\u0161 is something of a womanizer but is depicted in a broadly sympathetic manner by Ha\u0161ek (the records of the real-life 91st Regiment show an Oberleutnant Rudolf Lukas \u2013 the same rank as the character \u2013 at the time of Ha\u0161ek's service; Ha\u0161ek admired Lukas and even wrote him a number of poems. Lukas was Ha\u0161ek's company commander.<ref name=parrottpxi>Parrott, C. \"Introduction\" to ''The Good Soldier Svejk'', Penguin, 1974, p. xi</ref>) Though \u0160vejk's actions eventually lead to Luk\u00e1\u0161' being labelled as a notorious philanderer in the Hungarian national press, he starts to miss \u0160vejk after the latter is promoted to company orderly.\n;Colonel Friedrich Kraus von Zillergut: An idiotic Austrian officer with a penchant for giving his colleagues long-winded, moronic explanations of everyday objects (such as thermometers and postage stamps) and situations; run over by a cart while attempting to demonstrate what a [[Sidewalk|pavement]] is. Kraus's dog is stolen by \u0160vejk as a gift for Luk\u00e1\u0161; the enraged colonel subsequently arranges Luk\u00e1\u0161's transfer to the front.\n;Captain S\u00e1gner: One of the regiment's professional officers and commander of \u0160vejk's [[march battalion]]; an ambitious careerist, he is later revealed to have been a closet Czech patriot in his youth. A Captain Vinzenz Sagner served in the 91st Regiment, where he was Ha\u0161ek's battalion commander.<ref name=\"parrottpxi\"/>\n;Colonel Schr\u00f6der: The bad-tempered [[colonel]] of \u0160vejk's regiment, and a caricature of typical German-speaking senior officers of the Austrian army.\n;Jurajda: The battalion's [[spiritualist]] cook; before military service he had edited an \"occultist\" journal. Spends time attempting to avoid frontline service through letters he is writing to his wife, in which he details meals he is intending to cook for senior officers.\n;2nd Lieutenant Dub: Dub is a Czech schoolmaster, reserve officer, and commander of the battalion's 3rd company: he has strongly monarchist views. As a conservative, pro-[[Habsburg]] Czech, Dub is the subject of some of Ha\u0161ek's most vicious satire. Repeatedly placed in humiliating situations, such as being found drunk in a [[brothel]] or falling off a horse (in all [[Slavic languages|Slavonic]] languages the word 'dub' ('oak') itself is a common synonym for a dull, idiotic person). He is said to have been based on a lieutenant of the reserve, Mech\u00e1lek, who served in Ha\u0161ek's regiment.<ref name=\"parrottpxi\"/>\n;Quartermaster Sergeant-Major Van\u011bk: Another recurring character, Van\u011bk (a chemist from [[Kralupy nad Vltavou]] in civilian life) is an example of an easy-going but self-serving senior [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]], whose main concern is to make his own existence as comfortable as possible. A Jan Van\u011bk served in Ha\u0161ek's regiment, and has some traits in common with the figure from the novel (domicile and occupation).<ref name=\"parrottpxi\"/>\n;Volunteer Marek: The character of one-year volunteer Marek is to some degree a self-portrait by the author, who was himself a one-year volunteer in the 91st. For example, Marek&nbsp;\u2013 like Ha\u0161ek&nbsp;\u2013 was fired from the editorship of a natural history magazine after writing articles about imaginary animals. Marek is appointed the battalion historian by S\u00e1gner and occupies himself with devising memorable and heroic deaths in advance for his colleagues.\n;[[First-Class Private]] Vodi\u010dka: A [[sapper]] friend of \u0160vejk noted mainly for his extreme hatred of [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], which leads to an unfortunate incident in [[Bruck an der Leitha]].\n;Lieutenant Biegler (Cadet Biegler): Biegler is a young junior officer with pretensions to nobility, despite being the middle-class son of a [[furrier]]. Biegler takes his military duties so seriously that he is ridiculed even by his senior officers, and is mistakenly hospitalised as a \"carrier of [[cholera]] germs\" after medical staff misdiagnose (for army PR reasons) a [[cognac]]-induced [[hangover]]. Cadet Biegler also had a real-life model in the 91st regiment (Cadet Johann Biegler, later lieutenant).<ref name=\"parrottpxi\"/>\n;Captain Tayrle: The brigade [[adjutant]] and a particularly disgusting example of a headquarters officer, whose interests appear to lie mainly in crude jokes and sampling of local [[prostitutes]].\n;General [[Fink von Finkenstein]]: An aristocratic, vicious and near-insane senior Austrian officer and commander of the garrison fort of [[Przemy\u015bl]], Fink treats his men with extreme brutality. He almost succeeds in having \u0160vejk executed after the latter is taken prisoner by his own side.\n;Chaplain Martinec: A chaplain plagued by drink-induced spiritual doubts, whose attempt to provide spiritual consolation to \u0160vejk ends in disaster.\n;\"Sergeant Teveles\": A man in possession of a silver [[Military Merit Medal (Austria\u2013Hungary)|Military Merit Medal]], purchased from a [[Bosnians|Bosnian]], and claiming to be a Sergeant Teveles, who had previously disappeared along with the entire 6th March Company during fighting in [[Belgrade]].\n;[[Private (rank)|Private]] Baloun: A [[miller]] from [[\u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov]] in civilian life, and \u0160vejk's successor as Luk\u00e1\u0161's [[batman (military)|batman]], Baloun is a glutton and is regularly punished for stealing Luk\u00e1\u0161's food. He eats raw dough, sausage skins, etc., when nothing else is available.\n\n==Literary significance and criticism==\nA number of literary critics consider ''The Good Soldier \u0160vejk'' to be one of the first anti-war novels, predating [[Erich Maria Remarque]]'s ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front]]''.

[[Grandmama (The Addams Family)|Grandmama]] buys [[Uncle Fester|Fester]] time to evacuate Gomez, Morticia, and [[Thing (The Addams Family)|Thing]]. Gomez and Morticia decide to move to [[New Jersey]], a place \"no one would be caught dead in.\" There, Gomez, Morticia, and Thing find their \"perfect\" home in an abandoned asylum on a hill. They meet [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]], an escaped mental patient whom they hit when Thing was distracted driving the car, and immediately recruit him as their butler.\n\nThirteen years later, the Addams family continue to live their gloomy lives in isolation from the outside world. Gomez prepares his son [[Pugsley Addams|Pugsley]] for his upcoming [[Mazurka]], a rite of passage that every Addams family member takes. Morticia struggles to keep their daughter, [[Wednesday Addams|Wednesday]], from wanting to experience the world outside of the mansion after a balloon and confetti appear on their property, as the fog surrounding it begins to lift.\n\nElsewhere, reality TV host Margaux Needler, who is building a perfect [[planned community]] called \"Assimilation\" so her show will have a successful season finale, discovers the Addams family's household and becomes determined to rid the town of it when the family refuses to change. Wednesday then meets Margaux's neglected daughter Parker and convinces Morticia to let her attend junior high school. Pugsley struggles with the complicated traditions and pressure of his Mazurka, even with the guidance of Gomez and Uncle Fester. Grandmama arrives at the house for the event.\n\nAt school, Wednesday defends Parker and her twin friends Layla and Kayla from the school bully named Bethany and befriends them after she resurrects some [[dissection|dead frogs]] and commands them to attack Bethany. Later on, the two discuss their frustrations and change their dressing habits \u2013 Parker becomes more [[Goth subculture|gothic]] and Wednesday dresses more colorfully \u2013 to the shock of both of their mothers. After an argument with Morticia, Wednesday decides to run away in secret and stay with Parker for a while, which Pugsley inadvertently tells Morticia.\n\nWednesday and Parker discover a secret room under Parker's house revealing that Margaux has planted hidden cameras in every house she designed in town and has been spreading rumors about the Addams family through social media, claiming that they are freaks. Margaux catches the two and locks them in the attic, but Wednesday breaks them out. Margaux rallies an angry mob to attack the mansion just as [[Cousin Itt]] and the entire Addams clan arrive for Pugsley's Mazurka.\n\nDuring the Mazurka, Pugsley fails miserably in front of the whole family, but Gomez reassures him that he is an Addams nonetheless. The mob arrives flinging boulders, severely damaging the mansion and trapping the family inside. Pugsley uses his love of bombs and destruction to defend his family and manages to destroy the mob's [[trebuchet]]. Wednesday and Parker join in and help everyone out of the wreckage safely with help of the living tree Ichabod.\n\nAs Margaux tries to take control once more, her treachery is revealed to the people. They see that the Addams are not monsters, but a family, and Wednesday states that everyone is weird in their own unique way.

[[Grandmama (The Addams Family)|Grandmama]] buys [[Uncle Fester|Fester]] time to evacuate Gomez, Morticia, and [[Thing (The Addams Family)|Thing]]. Gomez and Morticia decide to move to [[New Jersey]], a place \"no one would be caught dead in.\" There, Gomez, Morticia, and Thing find their \"perfect\" home in an abandoned asylum on a hill. They meet [[Lurch (The Addams Family)|Lurch]], an escaped mental patient whom they hit when Thing was distracted driving the car, and immediately recruit him as their butler.\n\nThirteen years later, the Addams family continue to live their gloomy lives in isolation from the outside world. Gomez prepares his son [[Pugsley Addams|Pugsley]] for his upcoming [[Mazurka]], a rite of passage that every Addams family member takes. Morticia struggles to keep their daughter, [[Wednesday Addams|Wednesday]], from wanting to experience the world outside of the mansion after a balloon and confetti appear on their property, as the fog surrounding it begins to lift.\n\nElsewhere, reality TV host Margaux Needler, who is building a perfect [[planned community]] called \"Assimilation\" so her show will have a successful season finale, discovers the Addams family's household and becomes determined to rid the town of it when the family refuses to change. Wednesday then meets Margaux's neglected daughter Parker and convinces Morticia to let her attend junior high school. Pugsley struggles with the complicated traditions and pressure of his Mazurka, even with the guidance of Gomez and Uncle Fester. Grandmama arrives at the house for the event.\n\nAt school, Wednesday defends Parker and her twin friends Layla and Kayla from the school bully named Bethany and befriends them after she resurrects some [[dissection|dead frogs]] and commands them to attack Bethany. Later on, the two discuss their frustrations and change their dressing habits \u2013 Parker becomes more [[Goth subculture|gothic]] and Wednesday dresses more colorfully \u2013 to the shock of both of their mothers. After an argument with Morticia, Wednesday decides to run away in secret and stay with Parker for a while, which Pugsley inadvertently tells Morticia.\n\nWednesday and Parker discover a secret room under Parker's house revealing that Margaux has planted hidden cameras in every house she designed in town and has been spreading rumors about the Addams family through social media, claiming that they are freaks. Margaux catches the two and locks them in the attic, but Wednesday breaks them out. Margaux rallies an angry mob to attack the mansion just as [[Cousin Itt]] and the entire Addams clan arrive for Pugsley's Mazurka.\n\nDuring the Mazurka, Pugsley fails miserably in front of the whole family, but Gomez reassures him that he is an Addams nonetheless. The mob arrives flinging boulders, severely damaging the mansion and trapping the family inside. Pugsley uses his love of bombs and destruction to defend his family and manages to destroy the mob's [[trebuchet]]. Wednesday and Parker join in and help everyone out of the wreckage safely with help of the living tree Ichabod.\n\nAs Margaux tries to take control once more, her treachery is revealed to the people. They see that the Addams are not monsters, but a family, and Wednesday states that everyone is weird in their own unique way.

Although the [[Cavalier|Royalists]] under [[Ralph Hopton|Lord Hopton]] forced the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] under Sir [[William Waller]] to retreat from their hilltop position, they suffered so many casualties themselves and were left so disordered and short of ammunition that an injured Hopton was forced to retire.\n\n==Prelude==\nBy late May 1643, Lord Hopton's royalist army had captured most of the south west of England. Joined by the Earl of Hertford, he then advanced eastward into Parliamentarian-held territory. Sir William Waller's army held Bath, to obstruct their further advance. On 2 July 1643 the Royalists seized the bridge at [[Bradford on Avon]]. On 3 July, skirmishes took place at [[Claverton, Somerset|Claverton]] and at Waller's positions south and east of Bath. Waller retired to a strong position on Lansdown Hill, northwest of Bath while the main Royalist force moved north through [[Batheaston]] to [[Marshfield, Gloucestershire|Marshfield]].<ref name=\"barratt\"/>\n\nHopton's forces encountered Waller's position on Lansdown Hill on 4 July and were unpleasantly surprised at its strength. They withdrew {{convert|5|mi|km}} north-east to Marshfield, while their rearguard repulsed an attempt by Waller's cavalry to pursue.<ref>Plant.</ref><ref>Battle of Lansdown Hill, British Battles.</ref><ref>English Heritage Battlefield Report: Lansdown 1643.</ref>\n\n==Battle==\nEarly on 5 July, Waller moved to the north end of Lansdown Hill, where he built crude breastworks for his infantry,{{sfn|Plant|2009}} and sent some of his cavalry against Hopton's outposts. The Parliamentarians put to flight some badly-led Royalist cavalry, and the alarm caused all of Hopton's army to form up and to begin advancing west until they came in sight of Waller's position.\n\n[[Image:Battle of Lansdown marker.JPG|thumb|left|Battlefield marker]]\n\nThe two forces engaged in indecisive skirmishing for two hours until Hopton tried to withdraw. Waller once again sent his horse and dragoons against the Royalist's rearguard, and this time they routed the Royalist cavalry, although the infantry stood firm. Hopton's army then turned about and ultimately defeated the Roundhead cavalry in a confused action. With his Cornish foot regiments already advancing without orders, Hopton at last attacked Lansdown Hill.\n\nAs they charged up the steep slopes towards the Parliamentarian position on the crest, Hopton's cavalry suffered badly, and many panicked. 1,400 of them fled, some as far as Oxford. Under Sir [[Bevil Grenville]], Hopton's Cornish pikemen stormed Waller's breastworks, while Royalist musketeers outflanked Waller's forces through the woods on each side of his position. Grenville was mortally wounded in hand-to-hand combat as Parliamentarian horse counter-attacked and were driven off. Waller's infantry fell back to a wall across the crest of the hill from where they kept up musket fire until dark fell. During the night, they withdrew silently, leaving burning matches on the wall to deceive the Royalists that they still held the position.<ref>The Battle of Lansdown Hill, The Battlefields Trust.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe day after the battle, a Royalist ammunition cart exploded. Hopton was injured and temporarily blinded. The loss of the powder and the absence of most of their horse meant that the Royalists could not fight another action. Meanwhile, Waller had retired to Bath, where he was reinforced and was ready to attack again. Hopton's army retreated in low spirits to [[Devizes]]. Hopton's army was in such a poor situation before their retreat that Hopton's military opponent but old friend Waller offered him hospitality in Bath, though he refused it.\n\nA Cornish officer describing the battle wrote that Waller was ''\"... the best shifter and chooser of ground when he was not Master of the field that ever I saw\"''.
