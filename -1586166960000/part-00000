Pictures]] and based on characters that appear in [[American comic book]]s by [[DC Comics]]. The shared universe, much like the original [[DC Universe]] in comic books and the television programs, was established by [[Crossover (fiction)|crossing over]] common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. The films have been in production since 2011 and in that time Warner Bros. has distributed eight films, with a multitude of other planned films in various stages of development. It is the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing franchises and film series|eleventh-highest-grossing film franchise]] of all time, having grossed over $5.48 billion at the global box office. Its highest-grossing film is ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'', which earned over $1.15 billion worldwide, becoming the [[List of films based on DC Comics publications|highest-grossing DC film]] to date.\n\nThe films are written and directed by a variety of individuals and feature large, often [[Ensemble cast|ensemble]] casts. [[Henry Cavill]], [[Ben Affleck]], [[Gal Gadot]], [[Ezra Miller]], [[Jason Momoa]] and [[Ray Fisher (actor)|Ray Fisher]], among others, star in several films. However, unlike the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], the franchise has non-linear, loosely connected storylines, with greater autonomy for the filmmakers who create each individual film. The first film in the DCEU was ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' (2013), followed by ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016), ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016), ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' (2017), ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' (2017), ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'' (2018), ''[[Shazam! (film)|Shazam!]]'' (2019), and ''[[Birds of Prey (2020 film)|Birds of Prey]]'' (2020). The franchise will continue with ''[[Wonder Woman 1984]]'' in 2020, ''[[The Batman (film)|The Batman]]'', ''[[The Suicide Squad (film)|The Suicide Squad]]'', and ''Black Adam'' in 2021; and ''Shazam! 2'', ''The Flash'' and ''Aquaman 2'' in 2022.\n\n== Development ==\nIn 2002, [[Wolfgang Petersen]] was set to direct a ''[[Superman in film#Batman vs. Superman (2001\u20132002)|Batman vs. Superman]]'' film from a script by [[Akiva Goldsman]].<ref name=\"BvSNewsweek\"/> Warner Bros. canceled development to focus on individual Superman and Batman projects after [[J.

Several television series featuring DC characters and storylines have their own shared continuity, frequently referred to as the [[Arrowverse]].<ref name=\"Arrowverse\"/> DC's [[chief creative officer]] [[Geoff Johns]] explained DC's difference in approach to [[Marvel Studios]] and their cinematic universe, saying, \"We look at it as the [[multiverse]]. We have our TV universe and our film universe, but they all co-exist. For us, creatively, it's about allowing everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world. Everyone has a vision and you really want to let the visions shine through ... It's just a different approach.\"<ref name=\"GoeffJonesBuzzFeed\"/> In June 2015, Warner Bros. president of creative development Greg Silverman expanded on DC's approach to their cinematic universe, saying, \"We ... take these beloved characters and put them in the hands of master filmmakers and make sure they all coordinate with each other. You'll see the difference when you see ... the things that we are working on.\"<ref name=\"SilvermanTHR\"/>\n\nIn May 2016, following criticism of ''Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'', Warner Bros. established a [[DC Films]] division with Geoff Johns and Warner Bros. executive vice president Jon Berg as its heads,<ref name=\"GeoffJohnsVulture\"/> which oversees production to form a cohesive creative direction for the franchise.<ref name=\"Shakeup\"/><ref name=\"WarnerBrosResponse\"/> DC Films would not be fully autonomous, as Johns reported to DC president [[Diane Nelson (comics)|Diane Nelson]] and Berg reported to Silverman.<ref name=\"Shakeup\"/> [[Charles Roven]] was also moved from his day-by-day producer role on future DC films, which he had served since 2005's ''Batman Begins'', to an administrative executive producer role.<ref name=\"RovenFallout\"/> In December, Silverman was ousted from his role in Warner Bros., and [[Toby Emmerich]] was promoted to president and chief content officer, in his place.<ref name=\"EmmerichCCO\"/> By January 2017, Johns and Berg reported to Emmerich.<ref name=\"GreenLanternWriters\"/> Following the financial and critical success of ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' in June 2017, Johns stated that moving forward the films will focus on the heart, humor, hope, heroics, and optimism of the characters.<ref name=\"GeoffJohnsTheWrap\"/> As a result of [[Justice League (film)|''Justice League'']]'s underperformance at the box office, Berg left his position by January 2018 and became a production partner with [[Roy Lee]].<ref name=\"Shakeup2\"/><ref name=\"HamadaVariety\"/> DC also sought to deemphasize the shared nature of their films, with Diane Nelson stating, \"Our intention, certainly, moving forward is using the continuity to help make sure nothing is diverging in a way that doesn't make sense, but there's no insistence upon an overall storyline or interconnectivity in that universe... Moving forward, you'll see the DC movie universe being a universe, but one that comes from the heart of the filmmaker who's creating them.\"<ref name=\"RethinkVulture\"/>\n\nIn January 2018, [[Walter Hamada]] was appointed the President of DC Films and co-runner of the DCEU, replacing Berg.<ref name=\"HamadaVariety\"/> The following month, Chantal Nong was named Vice President of DC Films.<ref name=\"ChantalNongVP\"/> The pair were hired to oversee the franchise with Johns, as the key production team managers.<ref name=\"HamadaVariety\"/> However, Johns stepped down from his executive roles at DC in June 2018.

with the naming convention of the already established [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).<ref name=\"DCMarvelForbes\"/><ref name=\"DCCUYahoo\"/><ref name=\"DCCU-EW\"/> Keith Staskiewicz, writing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', coined the term \"DC Extended Universe\u2122\" as a joke in an article of his about ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' on July 1, 2015.<ref name=\"DCEU-EW\"/><ref name=\"DCEU-SR\"/> This term and the abbreviation DCEU quickly spread among the press and fans thinking of it as the official name of the franchise over the following years.<ref name=\"TheyAreLegend\"/><ref name=\"BvSEmpireCover\"/> According to ''[[Vulture.com|Vulture]]'' writer Abraham Riesman, DC confirmed to him in September 2017 that the term is not used internally and they do not consider it official.<ref name=\"DCEU-SR\"/> In 2016, as part of ''DC Films Presents: Dawn of the Justice League'', both Geoff Johns and [[Kevin Smith]] referred to the franchise's name as being the \"Justice League Universe\".<ref name=\"JLU-SR\"/> During the [[DC Films]] panel at [[San Diego Comic-Con]] 2018, a video banner displayed the words \"Welcome to the Worlds of DC\", after showcasing some upcoming films. As a result, some media outlets interpreted this as DC officially naming their shared film universe as the \"Worlds of DC\".<ref name=\"WoDC-SR\"/><ref name=\"WoDCForbes\"/> Despite this, there has been no official announcement from Warner Bros. nor DC Films to confirm this.}} is an unofficial term used to refer to an American [[media franchise]] and [[shared universe]] that is centered on a [[film series|series]] of [[superhero film]]s, distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] and based on characters that appear in [[American comic book]]s by [[DC Comics]]. The shared universe, much like the original [[DC Universe]] in comic books and the television programs, was established by [[Crossover (fiction)|crossing over]] common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. The films have been in production since 2011 and in that time Warner Bros. has distributed eight films, with a multitude of other planned films in various stages of development. It is the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing franchises and film series|eleventh-highest-grossing film franchise]] of all time, having grossed over $5.48 billion at the global box office. Its highest-grossing film is ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'', which earned over $1.15 billion worldwide, becoming the [[List of films based on DC Comics publications|highest-grossing DC film]] to date.\n\nThe films are written and directed by a variety of individuals and feature large, often [[Ensemble cast|ensemble]] casts. [[Henry Cavill]], [[Ben Affleck]], [[Gal Gadot]], [[Ezra Miller]], [[Jason Momoa]] and [[Ray Fisher (actor)|Ray Fisher]], among others, star in several films. However, unlike the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], the franchise has non-linear, loosely connected storylines, with greater autonomy for the filmmakers who create each individual film. The first film in the DCEU was ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' (2013), followed by ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016), ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016), ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' (2017), ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' (2017), ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'' (2018), ''[[Shazam! (film)|Shazam!]]'' (2019), and ''[[Birds of Prey (2020 film)|Birds of Prey]]'' (2020). The franchise will continue with ''[[Wonder Woman 1984]]'' in 2020, ''[[The Batman (film)|The Batman]]'', ''[[The Suicide Squad (film)|The Suicide Squad]]'', and ''Black Adam'' in 2021; and ''Shazam! 2'', ''The Flash'' and ''Aquaman 2'' in 2022.\n\n== Development ==\nIn 2002, [[Wolfgang Petersen]] was set to direct a ''[[Superman in film#Batman vs. Superman (2001\u20132002)|Batman vs. Superman]]'' film from a script by [[Akiva Goldsman]].<ref name=\"BvSNewsweek\"/> Warner Bros. canceled development to focus on individual Superman and Batman projects after [[J. J. Abrams]] submitted another draft for ''Superman: Flyby''.<ref name=\"DevelopmentHell\"/><ref name=\"BalePetersenMTV\"/> In February 2007, Warner Bros. hired husband and wife duo Michele and [[Kieran Mulroney]] to write a script for a ''[[Justice League]]'' film.<ref name=\"JusticeVariety2007\"/> [[Christian Bale]], who starred as Batman in ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005), was not approached to reprise the role,<ref name=\"BaleJusticeLeague\"/> nor was [[Brandon Routh]], who starred as Superman in ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006).<ref name=\"RouthJusticeLeague\"/> [[George Miller (director)|George Miller]] was hired to direct the film,<ref name=\"MillerVariety\"/> reportedly titled ''Justice League Mortal'',<ref name=\"JLMortalVariety\"/> with [[Armie Hammer]] cast as Batman, [[D. J. Cotrona]] as Superman, [[Adam Brody]] as Flash, [[Santiago Cabrera]] as Aquaman, [[Common (rapper)|Common]] as Green Lantern, [[Megan Gale]] as Wonder Woman, [[Hugh Keays-Byrne]] as [[Martian Manhunter]] and [[Jay Baruchel]] as [[Maxwell Lord]].<ref name=\"GaleWonderWoman\"/> The project was put on indefinite hold in January 2008, after failing to secure [[tax breaks]] for filming in Australia, as well as the [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike]] preventing progress on the script.<ref name=\"JusticeLeagueCancelled\"/>\n\nIn 2013, a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the [[Superman in film|''Superman'' franchise]], ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'', was set to lay the groundwork for future DC films.<ref name=\"ManOfSteelEW\"/> The film contained references to other characters in the [[DC Universe]], so if it were a success, it could launch a shared universe.<ref name=\"MoSBleedingCool\"/><ref name=\"ManofSteelSR\"/> Days before ''Man of Steel''{{'}}s release in June, it was reported that director [[Zack Snyder]] and screenwriter [[David S. Goyer]] would be returning for a sequel, which was being fast-tracked by Warner Bros.<ref name=\"GoyerMoSSequel\"/> In July, at [[San Diego Comic-Con]], it was revealed that the sequel would include Batman in a main role, establishing the shared universe.<ref name=\"LATimesCC2013\"/><ref name=\"EWCC2013\"/> In October 2014, Warner Bros. announced a slate of ten DC films.<ref name=\"2014Slate\"/>\n\n[[File:Geoff Johns by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|left|Geoff Johns has served in various positions in DC Films and the DCEU.]]\nWhile the rival [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) includes television productions, DC's crossover series is a shared continuity for films. Several television series featuring DC characters and storylines have their own shared continuity, frequently referred to as the [[Arrowverse]].<ref name=\"Arrowverse\"/> DC's [[chief creative officer]] [[Geoff Johns]] explained DC's difference in approach to [[Marvel Studios]] and their cinematic universe, saying, \"We look at it as the [[multiverse]]. We have our TV universe and our film universe, but they all co-exist. For us, creatively, it's about allowing everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world. Everyone has a vision and you really want to let the visions shine through ... It's just a different approach.\"<ref name=\"GoeffJonesBuzzFeed\"/> In June 2015, Warner Bros. president of creative development Greg Silverman expanded on DC's approach to their cinematic universe, saying, \"We ... take these beloved characters and put them in the hands of master filmmakers and make sure they all coordinate with each other.

The newspaper, owned by [[Ramnath Goenka]], was a focal point for the government's efforts at censorship.{{sfn|International Press Institute|ps=}} He became a fellow of the [[Indian Council of Social Science Research]] in 1976.{{sfnp|Magsaysay Foundation|2012|ps=}} In January 1979, Goenka appointed Shourie as executive editor of the newspaper, giving him a ''carte blanche'' to do with it as he saw fit.{{sfn|International Press Institute|ps=}} He developed a reputation as an intelligent, fearless writer and editor who campaigned for freedom of the press, exposed corruption and defended civil liberties such that, in the words of [[Martha Nussbaum]], \"his dedication to the truth has won admiration throughout the political spectrum\".{{sfnp|Nussbaum|2009|p=61|ps=}}\n\nShourie has been called a \"veteran journalist\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Remaking India: One Country, One Destiny|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRVtyruwoIgC&pg=PA25&dq=arun+shourie+|page=25|publisher=SAGE Publications|author=Arun Maira}}</ref><ref>http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/arun-shouries-speech-on-media-freedom-at-press-club-of-india-full-transcript-1710491</ref> Shourie was a winner of the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 1982, in the Journalism, Literature and Creative Communication Arts category as \"a concerned citizen employing his pen as an effective adversary of corruption, inequality and injustice.\"{{sfnp|Magsaysay Foundation|2012|ps=}} In 2000, he was named as one of the [[International Press Institute]]'s ''[[World Press Freedom Heroes]]''.

Claimed by the government to be a reinforcement of India's constitutional secularism, it was widely criticised by both Muslims and Hindus. The liberals among them, says [[Ainslie Embree]], saw it as \"a capitulation to the forces of Islamic obscurantism, a return&nbsp;... to the thirteenth century\"; the Hindu revivalist critics thought it was \"weakening Indian unity\". Shourie wrote articles that tried to show that the treatment of women as required by the Quran would in fact offer them protection, although the application of Islamic law in practice was oppressing them. He was in turn criticised for what was perceived as a thinly-veiled attack on Islam itself, with [[Rafiq Zakaria]], the Muslim scholar, saying that Shourie's concern for reform of Islam was in fact demonstrative of Hindu contempt that used the plight of Muslim women as an example of the backwardness of the community. [[Vir Sanghvi]] termed it \"Hindu chauvinism with a liberal face\".{{sfnp|Embree|1990|pp=107-111|ps=}}\n\nAfter the defeat of the BJP in 2009 general elections, Shourie asked for introspection and accountability within the party. He deplored factionalism within the party and those who brief journalists to aid their own agenda.{{sfnp|Indian Express|2009|ps=}}\n\nShourie has been described by [[Christophe Jaffrelot]], a political scientist, as \"a writer sympathetic to militant Hindu themes\"{{sfnp|Jaffrelot|1996|p=353|ps=}} and has publicly voiced support for the aims of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS), a nationalist [[Hindutva]] organisation. This has caused unease among some of those who admire his journalism.{{sfnp|Nussbaum|2009|p=62|ps=}} He has said that, although he sees a danger from perceived Muslim violence such as the [[Godhra train burning]] incident of 2002, people have tended to redefine the \"Hindutva\" term. He says that prominent members of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), of which he is a member and which has ties to the RSS&nbsp;\u2014 specifically, [[L. K. Advani]] and [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]]&nbsp;\u2014  have shown their opposition to sectarian hatred and in their attempts to make the BJP inclusive have tried to marginalise those on both the Muslim and Hindu extremes who promote such hatred.{{sfnp|Nussbaum|2009|pp=66-68|ps=}}As a political scientist he views that current leaders lack competency and integrity. He emphasised his views in a cultural conference called [[Tomorrow\u2019s India Global Summit]] and added that the pressure to bring about change in the present electoral system should come from the society.<ref>https://www.firstpost.com/politics/arun-shourie-says-pressure-to-change-electoral-system-should-come-from-society-4122739.html</ref>\n\n=== Writer ===\nArun Shourie has written numerous books. According to [[Martha Nussbaum]], the traits of his writings are: {{quote|recognisably the creation of a smart, determined, muckraking journalist, They are polemical, ad hominem, often extremely shrill in tone.&nbsp;... But despite their style, the books are obviously the work of a brilliant man, with a wide if idiosyncratic learning, a passion for the freedoms of speech and press, and a desire to get beneath current events to address underlying issues.{{sfnp|Nussbaum|2009|p=62|ps=}}}}\n\nHis writings have gained him a considerable following. They were initially on a diverse range of subjects related to his journalistic interests, including corruption{{clarify | date = July 2015 | reason = The sentence does not make sense. What do corruption against B.R. Ambedkar and left-wing historians mean?}} and polemics against left-wing historians.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} He subsequently concentrated his polemicism mostly on issues relating to the detrimental effects of religion on society, producing critiques of Christianity, Hinduism{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} and Islam. With the exception of [[Gandhi]], he has little time for any religious thinker and, says Nussbaum, his books \"nowhere&nbsp;... seek to provide balance; nowhere is there a sense of complexity. All have the same mocking, superior tone.\"{{sfnp|Nussbaum|2009|p=63|ps=}}\n\nHistorian [[Dwijendra Narayan Jha|D.N. Jha]] criticized Shourie's book ''[[Eminent Historians]]'', which concerned the [[NCERT controversy]], that it contains \"slander\" and \"has nothing to do with history.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Grist to the reactionary mill|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/grist-to-the-reactionary-mill/|work = Indian Express|date=9 July 2014|accessdate=9 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How History Was Unmade At Nalanda!

Claimed by the government to be a reinforcement of India's constitutional secularism, it was widely criticised by both Muslims and Hindus. The liberals among them, says [[Ainslie Embree]], saw it as \"a capitulation to the forces of Islamic obscurantism, a return&nbsp;... to the thirteenth century\"; the Hindu revivalist critics thought it was \"weakening Indian unity\". Shourie wrote articles that tried to show that the treatment of women as required by the Quran would in fact offer them protection, although the application of Islamic law in practice was oppressing them. He was in turn criticised for what was perceived as a thinly-veiled attack on Islam itself, with [[Rafiq Zakaria]], the Muslim scholar, saying that Shourie's concern for reform of Islam was in fact demonstrative of Hindu contempt that used the plight of Muslim women as an example of the backwardness of the community. [[Vir Sanghvi]] termed it \"Hindu chauvinism with a liberal face\".{{sfnp|Embree|1990|pp=107-111|ps=}}\n\nAfter the defeat of the BJP in 2009 general elections, Shourie asked for introspection and accountability within the party. He deplored factionalism within the party and those who brief journalists to aid their own agenda.{{sfnp|Indian Express|2009|ps=}}\n\nShourie has been described by [[Christophe Jaffrelot]], a political scientist, as \"a writer sympathetic to militant Hindu themes\"{{sfnp|Jaffrelot|1996|p=353|ps=}} and has publicly voiced support for the aims of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS), a nationalist [[Hindutva]] organisation. This has caused unease among some of those who admire his journalism.{{sfnp|Nussbaum|2009|p=62|ps=}} He has said that, although he sees a danger from perceived Muslim violence such as the [[Godhra train burning]] incident of 2002, people have tended to redefine the \"Hindutva\" term. He says that prominent members of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), of which he is a member and which has ties to the RSS&nbsp;\u2014 specifically, [[L. K. Advani]] and [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]]&nbsp;\u2014  have shown their opposition to sectarian hatred and in their attempts to make the BJP inclusive have tried to marginalise those on both the Muslim and Hindu extremes who promote such hatred.{{sfnp|Nussbaum|2009|pp=66-68|ps=}}As a political scientist he views that current leaders lack competency and integrity. He emphasised his views in a cultural conference called [[Tomorrow\u2019s India Global Summit]] and added that the pressure to bring about change in the present electoral system should come from the society.<ref>https://www.firstpost.com/politics/arun-shourie-says-pressure-to-change-electoral-system-should-come-from-society-4122739.html</ref>\n\n=== Writer ===\nArun Shourie has written numerous books. According to [[Martha Nussbaum]], the traits of his writings are: {{quote|recognisably the creation of a smart, determined, muckraking journalist, They are polemical, ad hominem, often extremely shrill in tone.&nbsp;... But despite their style, the books are obviously the work of a brilliant man, with a wide if idiosyncratic learning, a passion for the freedoms of speech and press, and a desire to get beneath current events to address underlying issues.{{sfnp|Nussbaum|2009|p=62|ps=}}}}\n\nHis writings have gained him a considerable following. They were initially on a diverse range of subjects related to his journalistic interests, including corruption{{clarify | date = July 2015 | reason = The sentence does not make sense. What do corruption against B.R. Ambedkar and left-wing historians mean?}} and polemics against left-wing historians.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} He subsequently concentrated his polemicism mostly on issues relating to the detrimental effects of religion on society, producing critiques of Christianity, Hinduism{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} and Islam. With the exception of [[Gandhi]], he has little time for any religious thinker and, says Nussbaum, his books \"nowhere&nbsp;... seek to provide balance; nowhere is there a sense of complexity. All have the same mocking, superior tone.\"{{sfnp|Nussbaum|2009|p=63|ps=}}\n\nHistorian [[Dwijendra Narayan Jha|D.N. Jha]] criticized Shourie's book ''[[Eminent Historians]]'', which concerned the [[NCERT controversy]], that it contains \"slander\" and \"has nothing to do with history.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Grist to the reactionary mill|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/grist-to-the-reactionary-mill/|work = Indian Express|date=9 July 2014|accessdate=9 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How History Was Unmade At Nalanda!

The oldest of five children growing up in Greek culture, Zenos admired, respected, and was drawn to Greek sculpture. Greek art influenced his aesthetic vision; additional inspiration came from sculptors [[Michelangelo]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux|Carpeaux]] and [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]]. The poetry of [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[Robert Frost|Frost]], [[Theodore Roethke|Roethke]] and [[Robert Graves|Graves]], is important to Zenos, as is philosophy.\n\n\nBorn in 1951 in [[San Francisco]], Frudakis was raised in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], and [[Gary, Indiana]], where he worked in the steel mills. He began drawing at a very young age, and in 1972 came to Philadelphia to study at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]]. He studied sculpture with two [[Prix de Rome]] winners: his elder brother, sculptor Evangelos Frudakis, and painter James Hanes. At the [[University of Pennsylvania]], he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Fine Art.<ref>Sarah Blackman, \"Sculpting a Life\" (feature article on Frudakis), ''The Pennsylvania Gazette'', Class of '82, November/December 2002, p. 3.</ref>\n\n\n==International Sculptures==\n* ''[[Reaching (sculpture)|Reaching]]''.

Utsukushi-ga-hara Open Air Museum, Japan.jpg|thumb|Reaching sculpture with Zenos Frudakis at the Utsukushi-ga-hara Open Air Museum in Japan.]]\n\n\n\n== Biography ==\nZenos' father, born in [[Greece]], came to the U.S. as a boy. The oldest of five children growing up in Greek culture, Zenos admired, respected, and was drawn to Greek sculpture. Greek art influenced his aesthetic vision; additional inspiration came from sculptors [[Michelangelo]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux|Carpeaux]] and [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]]. The poetry of [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[Robert Frost|Frost]], [[Theodore Roethke|Roethke]] and [[Robert Graves|Graves]], is important to Zenos, as is philosophy.\n\n\nBorn in 1951 in [[San Francisco]], Frudakis was raised in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], and [[Gary, Indiana]], where he worked in the steel mills. He began drawing at a very young age, and in 1972 came to Philadelphia to study at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]]. He studied sculpture with two [[Prix de Rome]] winners: his elder brother, sculptor Evangelos Frudakis, and painter James Hanes. At the [[University of Pennsylvania]], he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Fine Art.<ref>Sarah Blackman, \"Sculpting a Life\" (feature article on Frudakis), ''The Pennsylvania Gazette'', Class of '82, November/December 2002, p. 3.</ref>\n\n\n==International Sculptures==\n* ''[[Reaching (sculpture)|Reaching]]''.

The day was also meant to celebrate individual [[health care provider|health workers]] \u2013 the people who provide health care to those who need it, in other words those at the heart of [[health system]]s.\n\nThe Day also marked the launch of the WHO's ''[[World Health Report|World Health Report 2006]]'', which focused on the same theme. The report contained an assessment of the current crisis in the global health workforce, revealing an estimated shortage of almost 4.3 million physicians, midwives, nurses and other [[health care provider]]s worldwide, and further proposed a series of actions for countries and the international community to tackle it.<ref>''The world health report 2006: working together for health'', Geneva, [http://www.who.int/whr/2006 World Health Organization, 2006]</ref>\n\n# The World Health\n\n===2008: Protecting health from the adverse effects of climate change===\nIn 2008, World Health Day focused on the need to protect health from the adverse effects of [[climate change]] and establish links between climate change and health and other development areas such as environment, food, energy, transport.\n\nThe theme \"protecting health from climate change\" put health at the centre of the global dialogue about climate change. WHO selected this theme in recognition that climate change is posing ever growing threats to global public health security.<ref>World Health Organization:[http://www.who.int/world-health-day/previous/2008/en/index.html ''World Health Day 2008'']</ref>\n\n===2009: Save lives. Make hospitals safe in emergencies===\n[[File:Hartford Hospital main entrance.JPG|thumb|Hospital in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]]]\n\nWorld Health Day 2009 focused on the safety of [[health care provider|health facilities]] and the readiness of health workers who treat those affected by emergencies. Health centres and staff are critical lifelines for vulnerable people in disasters \u2013 treating [[trauma (medicine)|injuries]], preventing illnesses and caring for people's health needs. Often, already fragile health systems are unable to keep functioning through a disaster, with immediate and future public health consequences.\n\nFor this year's World Health Day campaign, WHO and international partners underscored the importance of investing in health infrastructure that can withstand hazards and serve people in immediate need, and urged health facilities to implement systems to respond to internal emergencies, such as fires, and ensure the continuity of care.\n\n===2010: Urbanization and health===\nWith the campaign \"1000 cities, 1000 lives\", events were organized worldwide during the week starting 7 April 2010. The global goals of the campaign were:<ref>World Health Organization: [http://www.who.int/world-health-day/2010/en/index.html ''World Health Day 2010'']</ref>\n* ''1000 cities'': to open up public spaces to health, whether it be activities in parks, town hall meetings, clean-up campaigns, or closing off portions of streets to motorized vehicles.\n* ''1000 lives'': to collect 1000 stories of urban health champions who have taken action and had a significant impact on health in their cities.\n\n===2011: Antimicrobial Resistance===\nThe theme of World Health Day 2011, marked on 7 April 2011, was \"[[Antimicrobial resistance]] and its global spread\" and focused on the need for governments and stakeholders to implement the policies and practices needed to prevent and counter the emergence of highly resistant [[microorganism]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4616&Itemid=3611&lang=en|title=World Health Day 2011 {{!}} PAHO WHO|last=Mitchell|first=Cristina|work=Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization|access-date=15 December 2017|language=en-gb}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[infection]]s caused by resistant microorganisms fail to respond to standard treatments, including [[antibacterial|antibiotics]] and other [[anti-microbial|antimicrobial]] medicines \u2013 also known as [[Multiple drug resistance|drug resistance]] \u2013 this may result in prolonged illness and greater risk of death.\n\nOn World Health Day 2011, WHO called for intensified global commitment to safeguard antimicrobial medicines for future generations. The organization introduced a six-point policy package to combat the spread of antimicrobial resistance:<ref>World Health Organization. ''World Health Day 2011: policy briefs''.

Life expectancy is going up in most countries, meaning more and more people live longer and enter an age when they may need [[health care]]. Meanwhile, birth rates are generally falling. Countries and health care systems need to find innovative and sustainable ways to cope with the demographic shift. As stated by John Beard, director of the WHO Department of Ageing and Life Course, \"With the rapid ageing of populations, finding the right model for [[long-term care]] becomes more and more urgent.\"<ref>[http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/90/1/12-020112.pdf \"Defusing the demographic \u201ctime-bomb\u201d in Germany.\"] ''Bull World Health Organ'' 2012;90:6\u20137.</ref>\n\nDifferent activities were organized by WHO as well as non-governmental and community organizations around the world to mark World Health Day 2012.<ref>World Health Organization.

The organization estimates one in 3 adults has raised blood pressure.\n\nSpecific objectives of the World Health Day 2013 campaign were to:\n* raise awareness of the causes and consequences of high blood pressure;\n* provide information on how to prevent high blood pressure and related complications;\n* encourage adults to check their [[blood pressure]] and follow the advice of healthcare professionals;\n* encourage [[self care]] to prevent high blood pressure;\n* to make blood pressure measurement affordable to all;\n* to incite national and local authorities to create enabling environments for [[Health promotion|healthy behaviours]].\n\n===2014: Small bite, Big threat===\n[[File:Aedes aegypti bloodfeeding CDC Gathany.jpg|thumb|''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' yellow fever mosquito feeding]]\n\nWorld Health Day 2014 put the spotlight on some of the most commonly known [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] \u2013 such as mosquitoes, sandflies, bugs, ticks and snails \u2013 responsible for transmitting a wide range of parasites and pathogens that can cause many different illnesses. Mosquitoes, for example, transmit [[malaria]] \u2013 the most deadly vector-borne disease, causing an estimated 660 000 deaths annually worldwide \u2013 as well as [[dengue fever]], [[lymphatic filariasis]], [[chikungunya]], [[Japanese encephalitis]] and [[yellow fever]].<ref>[http://www.who.int/campaigns/world-health-day/2014/event/en/index.html World Health Organization, \"World Health Day \u2013 17 April 2014.\"]</ref> More than half of the world\u2019s population is at risk of these diseases.\n\nThe goal of the World Health Day 2014 campaign was better protection from vector-borne diseases, especially for families living in areas where diseases are transmitted by vectors, and travelers to countries where they pose a health threat. The campaign advocated for health authorities in countries where vector-borne diseases are a [[public health]] problem or emerging threat, to put in place measures to improve surveillance and protection.\n\n===2015: Food Safety===\nThe WHO promoted improvement of [[food safety]] as part of the 2015 World Health Day campaign.<ref>World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/campaigns/world-health-day/2015/event/en/ World Health Day 2015: Food safety.] Geneva.

Changes in [[food production]], [[food distribution|distribution]] and [[food consumption|consumption]]; changes to the environment; new and emerging pathogens; and [[antimicrobial resistance]] all pose challenges to food safety systems.\n\nThe WHO works with countries and partners to strengthen efforts to prevent, detect and respond to [[foodborne disease]] outbreaks in line with the [[Codex Alimentarius]], advocating that food safety is a shared responsibility \u2014 from farmers and manufacturers to vendors and consumers \u2014 and  raising awareness about the importance of the part everyone can play in ensuring that the food on our plate is safe to eat.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Singh|first1=Ritu|title=World Health Day 2015: Make food safety a shared responsibility|url=http://zeenews.india.com/exclusive/world-health-day-2015-make-food-safety-a-shared-responsibility_1574214.html|website=Zee News|publisher=Zee_News|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2016: Diabetes===\n[[File:Diabetes world map - 2000.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Rates of diabetes worldwide (per 1,000 inhabitants) \u2014 world average was 2.8%.\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n{{legend|#b3b3b3|no data}}\n{{legend|#ffff65|\u2264&nbsp;7.5}}\n{{legend|#fff200|7.5\u201315}}\n{{legend|#ffdc00|15\u201322.5}}\n{{legend|#ffc600|22.5\u201330}}\n{{legend|#ffb000|30\u201337.5}}\n{{legend|#ff9a00|37.5\u201345}}\n{{Col-break}}\n{{legend|#ff8400|45\u201352.5}}\n{{legend|#ff6e00|52.5\u201360}}\n{{legend|#ff5800|60\u201367.5}}\n{{legend|#ff4200|67.5\u201375}}\n{{legend|#ff2c00|75\u201382.5}}\n{{legend|#cb0000|\u2265&nbsp;82.5}}\n{{col-end}} ]]\n\nThe WHO focused World Health Day 2016, on [[diabetes]] \u2013 a largely preventable and treatable [[non-communicable disease]] that is rapidly increasing in numbers in many countries, most dramatically in [[developing country|low- and middle-income countries]].

World Health Day is acknowledged by various governments and non-governmental organizations with interests in [[public health]] issues, who also organize activities and highlight their support in media reports, such as the [[Global Health Council]].<ref>Global Health Council: [https://www.globalhealth.org/news/article/10976 ''World Health Day''] by Lara Endreszl, 7 April 2009.</ref>\n\nWorld Health Day is one of eight official [[global health]] campaigns marked by WHO, along with [[World Tuberculosis Day]], [[World Immunization Week]], [[World Malaria Day]], [[World No Tobacco Day]], [[World AIDS Day]], [[World Blood Donor Day]], and [[World Hepatitis Day]].<ref>World Health Organization: [http://www.who.int/campaigns/en WHO campaigns.]</ref>\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==List of World Health Days themes==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* 1991: Should Disaster Strike, be prepared\n* 1992: Heart beat: A rhythm of Health\n* 1993: Handle life with care: Prevent violence and Negligence\n* 1994: Oral Health for a Healthy Life\n* 1995: Global [[Polio]] Eradication\n* 1996: [[Healthy city|Healthy Cities]] for better life\n* 1997: Emerging [[infectious disease]]s\n* 1998: Safe [[motherhood]]\n* 1999: Active [[aging]] makes the difference\n* 2000: Safe [[Blood]] starts with me\n* 2001: [[Mental Health]]: stop exclusion, dare to care\n* 2002: Move for health\n* 2003: Shape the future of life: healthy environments for children\n* 2004: [[Road safety]]\n* 2005: Make every mother and child count\n* 2006: Working together for health\n{{col-2}}\n* 2007: International health security\n* 2008: Protecting health from the adverse effects of [[climate change]]\n* 2009: Save lives, Make [[hospital]]s safe in emergencies\n* 2010: Urbanization and health: make [[Healthy city|cities healthier]]\n* 2011: [[Antimicrobial resistance]]: no action today, no cure tomorrow\n* 2012: Good health adds life to years\n* 2013: Healthy heart beat, Healthy [[Hypertension|blood pressure]]\n* 2014: [[Vector (epidemiology)|Vector-borne]] diseases: small bite, big threat\n* 2015: [[Food safety]]\n* 2016: Halt the rise: beat [[diabetes]]\n* 2017: [[Major depressive disorder|Depression]]: Let's talk\n* 2018: [[universal health care|Universal Health Coverage]]: : everyone, everywhere\n* 2019: [[universal health care|Universal Health Coverage]]: : everyone, everywhere\n* 2020: Support [[nurses]] and [[midwives]]<ref>{{cite web|title=World Health Day 2020|url=https://www.wplinequotes.xyz/2020/04/world-health-day-quotes-wishes-slogan-message-theme-facts-images-drawing-for-whatsapp-facebook.html|url-status=live|website=WpLINEQuotes|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Themes of World Health Days==\n===2006: Working together for health===\n[[File:SOWM2010 critical shortage.svg|thumb|Nations identified with critical health worker shortages]]\nIn 2006, World Health Day was devoted to the [[Health Human Resources|health workforce]] crisis, or chronic shortages of health workers around the world due to decades of underinvestment in their education, training, salaries, working environment and management. The day was also meant to celebrate individual [[health care provider|health workers]] \u2013 the people who provide health care to those who need it, in other words those at the heart of [[health system]]s.\n\nThe Day also marked the launch of the WHO's ''[[World Health Report|World Health Report 2006]]'', which focused on the same theme. The report contained an assessment of the current crisis in the global health workforce, revealing an estimated shortage of almost 4.3 million physicians, midwives, nurses and other [[health care provider]]s worldwide, and further proposed a series of actions for countries and the international community to tackle it.<ref>''The world health report 2006: working together for health'', Geneva, [http://www.who.int/whr/2006 World Health Organization, 2006]</ref>\n\n# The World Health\n\n===2008: Protecting health from the adverse effects of climate change===\nIn 2008, World Health Day focused on the need to protect health from the adverse effects of [[climate change]] and establish links between climate change and health and other development areas such as environment, food, energy, transport.\n\nThe theme \"protecting health from climate change\" put health at the centre of the global dialogue about climate change. WHO selected this theme in recognition that climate change is posing ever growing threats to global public health security.<ref>World Health Organization:[http://www.who.int/world-health-day/previous/2008/en/index.html ''World Health Day 2008'']</ref>\n\n===2009: Save lives. Make hospitals safe in emergencies===\n[[File:Hartford Hospital main entrance.JPG|thumb|Hospital in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]]]\n\nWorld Health Day 2009 focused on the safety of [[health care provider|health facilities]] and the readiness of health workers who treat those affected by emergencies. Health centres and staff are critical lifelines for vulnerable people in disasters \u2013 treating [[trauma (medicine)|injuries]], preventing illnesses and caring for people's health needs. Often, already fragile health systems are unable to keep functioning through a disaster, with immediate and future public health consequences.\n\nFor this year's World Health Day campaign, WHO and international partners underscored the importance of investing in health infrastructure that can withstand hazards and serve people in immediate need, and urged health facilities to implement systems to respond to internal emergencies, such as fires, and ensure the continuity of care.\n\n===2010: Urbanization and health===\nWith the campaign \"1000 cities, 1000 lives\", events were organized worldwide during the week starting 7 April 2010. The global goals of the campaign were:<ref>World Health Organization: [http://www.who.int/world-health-day/2010/en/index.html ''World Health Day 2010'']</ref>\n* ''1000 cities'': to open up public spaces to health, whether it be activities in parks, town hall meetings, clean-up campaigns, or closing off portions of streets to motorized vehicles.\n* ''1000 lives'': to collect 1000 stories of urban health champions who have taken action and had a significant impact on health in their cities.\n\n===2011: Antimicrobial Resistance===\nThe theme of World Health Day 2011, marked on 7 April 2011, was \"[[Antimicrobial resistance]] and its global spread\" and focused on the need for governments and stakeholders to implement the policies and practices needed to prevent and counter the emergence of highly resistant [[microorganism]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4616&Itemid=3611&lang=en|title=World Health Day 2011 {{!}} PAHO WHO|last=Mitchell|first=Cristina|work=Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization|access-date=15 December 2017|language=en-gb}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[infection]]s caused by resistant microorganisms fail to respond to standard treatments, including [[antibacterial|antibiotics]] and other [[anti-microbial|antimicrobial]] medicines \u2013 also known as [[Multiple drug resistance|drug resistance]] \u2013 this may result in prolonged illness and greater risk of death.\n\nOn World Health Day 2011, WHO called for intensified global commitment to safeguard antimicrobial medicines for future generations. The organization introduced a six-point policy package to combat the spread of antimicrobial resistance:<ref>World Health Organization. ''World Health Day 2011: policy briefs''.

Life expectancy is going up in most countries, meaning more and more people live longer and enter an age when they may need [[health care]]. Meanwhile, birth rates are generally falling. Countries and health care systems need to find innovative and sustainable ways to cope with the demographic shift. As stated by John Beard, director of the WHO Department of Ageing and Life Course, \"With the rapid ageing of populations, finding the right model for [[long-term care]] becomes more and more urgent.\"<ref>[http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/90/1/12-020112.pdf \"Defusing the demographic \u201ctime-bomb\u201d in Germany.\"] ''Bull World Health Organ'' 2012;90:6\u20137.</ref>\n\nDifferent activities were organized by WHO as well as non-governmental and community organizations around the world to mark World Health Day 2012.<ref>World Health Organization.

The organization estimates one in 3 adults has raised blood pressure.\n\nSpecific objectives of the World Health Day 2013 campaign were to:\n* raise awareness of the causes and consequences of high blood pressure;\n* provide information on how to prevent high blood pressure and related complications;\n* encourage adults to check their [[blood pressure]] and follow the advice of healthcare professionals;\n* encourage [[self care]] to prevent high blood pressure;\n* to make blood pressure measurement affordable to all;\n* to incite national and local authorities to create enabling environments for [[Health promotion|healthy behaviours]].\n\n===2014: Small bite, Big threat===\n[[File:Aedes aegypti bloodfeeding CDC Gathany.jpg|thumb|''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' yellow fever mosquito feeding]]\n\nWorld Health Day 2014 put the spotlight on some of the most commonly known [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] \u2013 such as mosquitoes, sandflies, bugs, ticks and snails \u2013 responsible for transmitting a wide range of parasites and pathogens that can cause many different illnesses. Mosquitoes, for example, transmit [[malaria]] \u2013 the most deadly vector-borne disease, causing an estimated 660 000 deaths annually worldwide \u2013 as well as [[dengue fever]], [[lymphatic filariasis]], [[chikungunya]], [[Japanese encephalitis]] and [[yellow fever]].<ref>[http://www.who.int/campaigns/world-health-day/2014/event/en/index.html World Health Organization, \"World Health Day \u2013 17 April 2014.\"]</ref> More than half of the world\u2019s population is at risk of these diseases.\n\nThe goal of the World Health Day 2014 campaign was better protection from vector-borne diseases, especially for families living in areas where diseases are transmitted by vectors, and travelers to countries where they pose a health threat. The campaign advocated for health authorities in countries where vector-borne diseases are a [[public health]] problem or emerging threat, to put in place measures to improve surveillance and protection.\n\n===2015: Food Safety===\nThe WHO promoted improvement of [[food safety]] as part of the 2015 World Health Day campaign.<ref>World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/campaigns/world-health-day/2015/event/en/ World Health Day 2015: Food safety.] Geneva. Accessed 25 November 2014.</ref> Unsafe food \u2014 food containing harmful bacteria, viruses, parasites or chemical substances \u2014 is responsible for more than 200 diseases, and is linked to the deaths of some 2 million people annually, mostly children. Changes in [[food production]], [[food distribution|distribution]] and [[food consumption|consumption]]; changes to the environment; new and emerging pathogens; and [[antimicrobial resistance]] all pose challenges to food safety systems.\n\nThe WHO works with countries and partners to strengthen efforts to prevent, detect and respond to [[foodborne disease]] outbreaks in line with the [[Codex Alimentarius]], advocating that food safety is a shared responsibility \u2014 from farmers and manufacturers to vendors and consumers \u2014 and  raising awareness about the importance of the part everyone can play in ensuring that the food on our plate is safe to eat.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Singh|first1=Ritu|title=World Health Day 2015: Make food safety a shared responsibility|url=http://zeenews.india.com/exclusive/world-health-day-2015-make-food-safety-a-shared-responsibility_1574214.html|website=Zee News|publisher=Zee_News|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2016: Diabetes===\n[[File:Diabetes world map - 2000.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Rates of diabetes worldwide (per 1,000 inhabitants) \u2014 world average was 2.8%.\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n{{legend|#b3b3b3|no data}}\n{{legend|#ffff65|\u2264&nbsp;7.5}}\n{{legend|#fff200|7.5\u201315}}\n{{legend|#ffdc00|15\u201322.5}}\n{{legend|#ffc600|22.5\u201330}}\n{{legend|#ffb000|30\u201337.5}}\n{{legend|#ff9a00|37.5\u201345}}\n{{Col-break}}\n{{legend|#ff8400|45\u201352.5}}\n{{legend|#ff6e00|52.5\u201360}}\n{{legend|#ff5800|60\u201367.5}}\n{{legend|#ff4200|67.5\u201375}}\n{{legend|#ff2c00|75\u201382.5}}\n{{legend|#cb0000|\u2265&nbsp;82.5}}\n{{col-end}} ]]\n\nThe WHO focused World Health Day 2016, on [[diabetes]] \u2013 a largely preventable and treatable [[non-communicable disease]] that is rapidly increasing in numbers in many countries, most dramatically in [[developing country|low- and middle-income countries]]. Simple lifestyle measures have been shown to be effective in preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes, including maintaining [[normal body weight]], engaging in regular physical activity, and eating a healthy diet. Diabetes can be controlled and managed to prevent complications through diagnosis, [[self care|self-management]] education, and affordable treatment.

It is located on [[Nicollet Island]].\n\n==History==\nDeLaSalle opened in 1900 and has been administered by the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|Christian Brothers]] throughout its history. The school's current president is Barry Lieske, AFSC.  Lieske has been an administrator at DeLaSalle since 1982 and has served as principal (chief operations officer) from 1993\u20132012.  Enrollment peaked at 1654 boys in 1964, dropped to the range of 400\u2013500 by the early 1970s despite the 1971\u201372 advent of co-education, and continued to decline to a 70-year low of 306 in 1991.  Over the past two decades DeLaSalle's enrollment has climbed, and the school now receives an average of 400 applications each year for ninth grade admission.  Strategic plans from 2000, 2007, 2012 and 2017 are based upon an optimum overall enrollment of 750\u2013800 students.\n\nThen-Archbishop John Ireland helped raise money in the late 1800s to build the new Catholic secondary school in Minneapolis. Ireland's goal was to provide education to sons of immigrants who were moving into Minneapolis neighborhoods from many European countries. Only a few months after groundbreaking, the \"DeLaSalle Institute\" building was ready for occupancy. Fifty boys joined three teaching Christian Brothers in the new school in October 1900. The number of pupils rapidly expanded, and by spring, a fourth Brother had arrived to handle the overcrowding. By 1907, an addition had been added to the original building, and in 1914, the Archdiocese, at Archbishop Ireland's direction, purchased the adjoining King property to provide space for eventual expansion. Enrollment stood at 352 boys.\n\nIn those early days, DeLaSalle was a commercial school. Through the work of Brother Hercules, the first graduating class, 13 members strong in 1903, all received positions with the leading business firms of Minneapolis before graduating.\n\nBy 1920, parents were calling for a high school that was primarily college preparatory. So Archbishop Dowling, Ireland's successor, went to all Minneapolis parishes to raise the $200,000 needed to build a new high school on the former King property, adjacent to the existing commercial building. Construction began in May 1922, and within a year, the new DeLaSalle High School building (today known as the \"B Building\") had opened.  Within six years, DeLaSalle was accredited as college preparatory by both the University of Minnesota and the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. (More than eight decades later, the school is still accredited by AdvancEd, the successor to North Central.)\n\nBy 1950, enrollment was growing significantly each year, so much so that ninth graders were being educated in a separate building at West 43rd Street and Wentworth Avenue in south Minneapolis.  The school's administration opened a new residence for the Christian Brothers in 1950, facing Grove Street on the back side of the DeLaSalle campus.  In 1960, in order to \"bring the freshmen back to the Island,\" the school opened the third classroom building on campus (today known as the \"A building\").  The original school building stood until February 1971, when a weekend electrical fire damaged much of the structure.  Because enrollment was dropping precipitously at the time, the original building was razed and not replaced.\n\nIn order to meet emerging educational and facility needs for a growing student body, in 2014 the DeLaSalle Board of Trustees authorized the construction of a new building. With funds and pledges raised from an ongoing five-year capital campaign run by the school's president, Barry Lieske, and the development office staff, DeLaSalle opened the new \"D building\" when the 2016\u201317 school year began. The centerpiece of the project is the \"Center for Innovative Learning,\" new learning spaces providing teachers and students enhanced educational technology and facilities that integrate more efficiently with the tablet- and cloud-technology used by all students. Within the project's scope, DeLaSalle also was able to replace decades-old boiler and electrical systems, improve the energy efficiency of the entire campus, enhance traffic circulation with new corridors and a new north-side entry, and relocate athletic and theatre / fine arts functions closer to the gymnasiums, athletic field, and auditorium respectively.\n\nIn the Strategic Plan of 1993 the school focused its curriculum only on college preparatory classes, in large part to maximize resources that could be available for financial assistance for families.  To this day, graduation requirements mirror typical college entrance requirements, plus requirements for completion of Christian Service hours and Theology coursework. Placement is available in one of two levels within a department:  Honors/Advanced Placement or regular college prep, with 13 different AP courses available to students.  Since 2000, over 98 percent of each graduating class has matriculated to college. De graduates are enrolled in colleges in 36 states.\n\nThe school was founded to provide a Catholic school option to poor and immigrant families (primarily European) moving into Minneapolis in the late 19th century.  This mission continues to this day, to provide a Catholic and college preparatory education to students from all family and socio-economic backgrounds. The school provides over $3.0 million of financial assistance to assist 53 percent of its students with reduced tuition. In addition to its socio-economic diversity, DeLaSalle is the most diverse [[Catholic School]] in the state of Minnesota as measured by almost all demographic areas:  45% of its students are people of color, 35% matriculate from single-parent households, and 33% have been raised in faiths other than Catholic.\n\nThe student body of 760 is drawn from over 120 parochial and public grade schools across the Twin Cities.  Over 85 students were born in other countries, some attending DeLaSalle because of its proximity to the University of Minnesota. DeLaSalle has launched an innovative Global Advantage Program, partnering with Hamline University, St. Mary's University, St. Catherine's University, and the University of Minnesota in areas of international academic travel and student exchange experiences.\n\nDeLaSalle is one of 13 Catholic high schools in the Twin Cities, one of two within the city limits of Minneapolis.\n\n==Sports and activities==\nOver 90 percent of DeLaSalle students participate in at least one school activity each year, and more than 75 percent will join two or more. Academic, fine arts, athletic and leadership/service groups and teams all are available to students.  The largest activities in terms of participation are theatre (six productions each year), music (both vocal and instrumental programs), and Lasallian \"Campus\" Ministry.\n\nSince 2000, teams or individuals from DeLaSalle have qualified for participation in the [[Minnesota State High School League|MSHSL]]'s championship tournaments in speech, one-act play, boys' and girls' basketball, football, boys' soccer, boys' and girls' track-and-field, wrestling, cross country, and baseball.  DeLaSalle students have succeeded in other programs not directed by the MSHSL, including competitive cheer (eight state titles), Quiz Bowl (eleven straight years qualifying for the National Championships), and musical theatre (20 group or individual awards earned in the annual Spotlight Program of the Hennepin Theatre Trust in 2017).  Of note, nearly 45 percent of the students are in a music program, one of three bands, two choirs or orchestra.\n\nDeLaSalle is a member of the [[Tri-Metro Conference (Minnesota)|Tri-Metro Conference]], a mix of private and public high schools throughout the Twin Cities that sponsors competitions, leadership programs, and other collaborative activities.\n\nOver its history, several dozen DeLaSalle alums have continued to participate in college athletic and arts programs, many with scholarship support from their colleges.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{alumni|date=April 2019}}\n[[File:Alan Anderson (basketball).JPG|thumb|180px|[[Alan Anderson (basketball)|Alan Anderson]]]]\n* Burt McGlynn `41, former chairman of McGlynn Bakeries\n* Al Crosson `48, former president of Hunt-Wesson Foods\n* Larry Gillis `53, retired president and CEO of Roto-Rooter, Inc.\n* [[John Francis Kinney|Bishop Emeritus John Kinney]] `55, Bishop of the St. Cloud diocese from 1998 to 2013.\n* Brother Michael Collins, FSC `55, former chief administrator of Fargo (ND) Shanley High School, St. Mary's (CA) College High School, Cretin-Derham Hall (MN), and DeLaSalle (MN)\n* [[Bob Wetoska]] `55, Notre Dame `59, retired NFL player\n*[[Albert Hofstede]] '58, former mayor of Minneapolis\n* John Derus `58, former Hennepin County Commissioner\n* Philip \"Skip\" Maas `58, former president of Boyer-Ford Trucks and former minority owner of the Minnesota Vikings\n* John Laux `59, retired chief of the Minneapolis Police Department and Bloomington (MN) Police Department\n* Bob Gavin `62, retired president of Macalester College (1984-1996) and Haverford College (1996\u201397)\n*[[Roy Gagnon]], retired NFL player\n* [[John M.

It is located on [[Nicollet Island]].\n\n==History==\nDeLaSalle opened in 1900 and has been administered by the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools|Christian Brothers]] throughout its history. The school's current president is Barry Lieske, AFSC.  Lieske has been an administrator at DeLaSalle since 1982 and has served as principal (chief operations officer) from 1993\u20132012.  Enrollment peaked at 1654 boys in 1964, dropped to the range of 400\u2013500 by the early 1970s despite the 1971\u201372 advent of co-education, and continued to decline to a 70-year low of 306 in 1991.  Over the past two decades DeLaSalle's enrollment has climbed, and the school now receives an average of 400 applications each year for ninth grade admission.  Strategic plans from 2000, 2007, 2012 and 2017 are based upon an optimum overall enrollment of 750\u2013800 students.\n\nThen-Archbishop John Ireland helped raise money in the late 1800s to build the new Catholic secondary school in Minneapolis. Ireland's goal was to provide education to sons of immigrants who were moving into Minneapolis neighborhoods from many European countries. Only a few months after groundbreaking, the \"DeLaSalle Institute\" building was ready for occupancy. Fifty boys joined three teaching Christian Brothers in the new school in October 1900. The number of pupils rapidly expanded, and by spring, a fourth Brother had arrived to handle the overcrowding. By 1907, an addition had been added to the original building, and in 1914, the Archdiocese, at Archbishop Ireland's direction, purchased the adjoining King property to provide space for eventual expansion. Enrollment stood at 352 boys.\n\nIn those early days, DeLaSalle was a commercial school. Through the work of Brother Hercules, the first graduating class, 13 members strong in 1903, all received positions with the leading business firms of Minneapolis before graduating.\n\nBy 1920, parents were calling for a high school that was primarily college preparatory. So Archbishop Dowling, Ireland\u2019s successor, went to all Minneapolis parishes to raise the $200,000 needed to build a new high school on the former King property, adjacent to the existing commercial building. Construction began in May 1922, and within a year, the new DeLaSalle High School building (today known as the \"B Building\") had opened.  Within six years, DeLaSalle was accredited as college preparatory by both the University of Minnesota and the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. (More than eight decades later, the school is still accredited by AdvancEd, the successor to North Central.) \n\nBy 1950, enrollment was growing significantly each year, so much so that ninth graders were being educated in a separate building at West 43rd Street and Wentworth Avenue in south Minneapolis.  The school's administration opened a new residence for the Christian Brothers in 1950, facing Grove Street on the back side of the DeLaSalle campus.  In 1960, in order to \"bring the freshmen back to the Island,\" the school opened the third classroom building on campus (today known as the \"A building\").  The original school building stood until February 1971, when a weekend electrical fire damaged much of the structure.  Because enrollment was dropping precipitously at the time, the original building was razed and not replaced.\n\nIn order to meet emerging educational and facility needs for a growing student body, in 2014 the DeLaSalle Board of Trustees authorized the construction of a new building. With funds and pledges raised from an ongoing five-year capital campaign run by the school's president, Barry Lieske, and the development office staff, DeLaSalle opened the new \"D building\" when the 2016-17 school year began. The centerpiece of the project is the \"Center for Innovative Learning,\" new learning spaces providing teachers and students enhanced educational technology and facilities that integrate more efficiently with the tablet- and cloud-technology used by all students. Within the project's scope, DeLaSalle also was able to replace decades-old boiler and electrical systems, improve the energy efficiency of the entire campus, enhance traffic circulation with new corridors and a new north-side entry, and relocate athletic and theatre / fine arts functions closer to the gymnasiums, athletic field, and auditorium respectively.\n\nIn the Strategic Plan of 1993 the school focused its curriculum only on college preparatory classes, in large part to maximize resources that could be available for financial assistance for families.  To this day, graduation requirements mirror typical college entrance requirements, plus requirements for completion of Christian Service hours and Theology coursework. Placement is available in one of two levels within a department:  Honors/Advanced Placement or regular college prep, with 13 different AP courses available to students.  Since 2000, over 98 percent of each graduating class has matriculated to college. De graduates are enrolled in colleges in 36 states.\n\nThe school was founded to provide a Catholic school option to poor and immigrant families (primarily European) moving into Minneapolis in the late 19th century.  This mission continues to this day, to provide a Catholic and college preparatory education to students from all family and socio-economic backgrounds. The school provides over $3.0 million of financial assistance to assist 53 percent of its students with reduced tuition. In addition to its socio-economic diversity, DeLaSalle is the most diverse [[Catholic School]] in the state of Minnesota as measured by almost all demographic areas:  45% of its students are people of color, 35% matriculate from single-parent households, and 33% have been raised in faiths other than Catholic.  \n\nThe student body of 760 is drawn from over 120 parochial and public grade schools across the Twin Cities.  Over 85 students were born in other countries, some attending DeLaSalle because of its proximity to the University of Minnesota. DeLaSalle has launched an innovative Global Advantage Program, partnering with Hamline University, St. Mary's University, St. Catherine's University, and the University of Minnesota in areas of international academic travel and student exchange experiences.\n\nDeLaSalle is one of 13 Catholic high schools in the Twin Cities, one of two within the city limits of Minneapolis.\n\n==Sports and activities==\nOver 90 percent of DeLaSalle students participate in at least one school activity each year, and more than 75 percent will join two or more. Academic, fine arts, athletic and leadership/service groups and teams all are available to students.  The largest activities in terms of participation are theatre (six productions each year), music (both vocal and instrumental programs), and Lasallian \"Campus\" Ministry.\n\nSince 2000, teams or individuals from DeLaSalle have qualified for participation in the [[Minnesota State High School League|MSHSL]]'s championship tournaments in speech, one-act play, boys' and girls' basketball, football, boys' soccer, boys' and girls' track-and-field, wrestling, cross country, and baseball.  DeLaSalle students have succeeded in other programs not directed by the MSHSL, including competitive cheer (eight state titles), Quiz Bowl (eleven straight years qualifying for the National Championships), and musical theatre (20 group or individual awards earned in the annual Spotlight Program of the Hennepin Theatre Trust in 2017).  Of note, nearly 45 percent of the students are in a music program, one of three bands, two choirs or orchestra.\n\nDeLaSalle is a member of the [[Tri-Metro Conference (Minnesota)|Tri-Metro Conference]], a mix of private and public high schools throughout the Twin Cities that sponsors competitions, leadership programs, and other collaborative activities.\n\nOver its history, several dozen DeLaSalle alums have continued to participate in college athletic and arts programs, many with scholarship support from their colleges.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{alumni|date=April 2019}}\n[[File:Alan Anderson (basketball).JPG|thumb|180px|[[Alan Anderson (basketball)|Alan Anderson]]]]\n* Burt McGlynn `41, former chairman of McGlynn Bakeries\n* Al Crosson `48, former president of Hunt-Wesson Foods\n* Larry Gillis `53, retired president and CEO of Roto-Rooter, Inc.\n* [[John Francis Kinney|Bishop Emeritus John Kinney]] `55, Bishop of the St. Cloud diocese from 1998 to 2013.\n* Brother Michael Collins, FSC `55, former chief administrator of Fargo (ND) Shanley High School, St. Mary's (CA) College High School, Cretin-Derham Hall (MN), and DeLaSalle (MN)\n* [[Bob Wetoska]] `55, Notre Dame `59, retired NFL player\n*[[Albert Hofstede]] '58, former mayor of Minneapolis\n* John Derus `58, former Hennepin County Commissioner\n* Philip \"Skip\" Maas `58, former president of Boyer-Ford Trucks and former minority owner of the Minnesota Vikings\n* John Laux `59, retired chief of the Minneapolis Police Department and Bloomington (MN) Police Department\n* Bob Gavin `62, retired president of Macalester College (1984-1996) and Haverford College (1996-97)\n*[[Roy Gagnon]], retired NFL player\n* [[John M.

Sweden, in its speech, called upon the international community to uphold human rights as enshrined in the [[Charter of the United Nations]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. One of the rights specifically mentioned was the freedom of expression, and how it must be protected even in the era of information technology.

The Delegation continued by stating that Ethiopia was using Eritrea as a scapegoat for the problems it had created Somalia. It further pointed out that it was Ethiopia\u2019s campaign in Somalia in 2006 that contributed to the rise of the Al-Shabaab, and not Eritrean support as Ethiopia claimed. Finally, it stated that Ethiopia had created one of the biggest humanitarian crises African had ever seen and that Ethiopia had significantly contributed to the destabilization of the Somalia. Eritrea finished by calling on Ethiopia to end its occupation of Eritrean territories in order to ensure stability in the region. \n<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Ethiopia''' <br>\nEthiopia used its Right of Reply to respond to Eritrea's Right of Reply.

India, in its speech, stated that, [[Jammu and Kashmir (state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] was is an integral part of India, and that it had been the target of Pakistan-sponsored militancy and terrorism. India called upon Pakistan to fulfill its commitment to not to allow territory under its control to be used for terrorism directed against India. India finished by stating that Pakistan could not impart lessons  on democracy and human rights to the international community as long as it continued to allow terrorism against India to remain unchecked.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gadebate.un.org/sites/default/files/gastatements/65/65_IN_en.pdf |title=Statement by H.E.

It also mentioned that the United Nations had adopted more than a dozen resolutions calling for the settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute through a free and fair plebiscite. Pakistan then reminded India that its first Prime Minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], had said in a speech on 2 January 1952 that \"Kashmir is not the property of either India or Pakistan. It belongs to the Kashmiri people. When Kashmir acceded to India, we made it clear\nto the leaders of the Kashmiri people that we would ultimately abide by the verdict of their plebiscite.\" Pakistan stated that India had continued to violate several United Nations resolutions, and failed to fulfill the commitments made by its leaders.\n\nPakistan then stated that India had used their speech to distract the international community from their human rights violations of Kashmiris in Indian-occupied Kashmir. It brought up statements by [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] which both had called on the Indian authorities to take steps to ensure respect for the right to life of Kashmiri demonstrators, as well as to respect the [[United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials]]. Finally, Pakistan accused India of maligning Pakistan on the issue of terrorism in order to conceal the state terrorism it had been using to stifle Kashmiri voices demanding the right to self-determination.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Azerbaijan''' <br>\nAzerbaijan used its Right of Reply to respond to statements made by Armenia in its General Debate speech before the Assembly. Armenia, in its speech, stated that Azerbaijan was a threat to regional peace and security through its continued denial of the right to self-determination by the people of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] by rejecting the [[1991 Nagorno-Karabakh independence referendum|1991 independence referendum]]. Armenia continued by accusing Azerbaijan of attempting to cleanse the people of Nagorno-Karabakh from their ancestral home via a brutal war. Azerbaijan was then accused of undermining the peace process by misleading the international community by distorting of the nature of the conflict, by undermining the [[OSCE Minsk Group|Minsk Group]] by rejecting its proposed principles and by rejecting proposals to come to an agreement on the non-use of force or threat of force. Armenia finished by condemning Azerbaijan's destruction of thousands of cultural and religious heritage objects in the Nagorno-Karabakh region.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gadebate.un.org/sites/default/files/gastatements/65/65_AM_en_fr_0.pdf |title=Statement by H.E.

It further accused Armenia of unleashing the war, attacking Azerbaijan, occupying its ancestral territories, carrying out ethnic cleansing and establishing a subordinate separatist entity on captured Azerbaijani territory along ethnic lines. Azerbaijan also called into the question the legitimacy of the 1991 referendum, claiming that it was not recognized by the Security Council and the General Assembly. Finally, it called on Armenia to realize that in order for peace to be achieved, there was no alternative but to put a prompt end to its illegal occupation of Azerbaijani territory.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Armenia''' <br>\nArmenia used its Right of Reply to respond to Azerbaijan's Right of Reply. It replied by stating that claims of any military expansionism by Armenia made by Azerbaijan were totally misleading; asserting that Armenia had never started any aggression whatsoever. Armenia continued by pinning the full blame of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict on Azerbaijan, accusing them of starting a full-scale war against the people of Nagorno-Karabakh, thus forcing them to take up arms in order to protect their lives and homes. Finally, it finished by stating that Armenia had fully complied with the [[List of United Nations Security Council resolutions on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict|various Security Council resolutions]] concerning the conflict, whereas Azerbaijan had not, and was attempting to find a peaceful solution to the conflict.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Republic of Korea''' <br>\nThe Republic of Korea (ROK) used its Right of Reply to respond to statements made by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK) in its General Debate speech before the Assembly. The DPRK, in its speech, stated that, its efforts towards peaceful development were being constantly threatened and undermined. It then commented on the situation regarding the [[ROKS Cheonan sinking|''Cheonan'' incident]], and how sabre-rattling and arms build-ups by the United States and the ROK were leading the Korean peninsula to brink of war. It further rejected the findings of the international team that was assembled to investigate the sinking, citing the ROK's refusal to allow a team from the DPRK to investigate the incident for scientific and objective verification. Finally, the DPRK castigated the ROK, accusing them of rejecting reunification efforts by creating tension on the Korean peninsula by waging war exercises with outside forces and by stepping up an atmosphere of war against their fellow countrymen.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gadebate.un.org/sites/default/files/gastatements/65/65_KP_en.pdf |title=Statement by H.E.

The delegation further added that it was unfortunate that the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] was not taking necessary steps in order to get Eritrea to comply with [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1907]], accusing Eritrea of being the \"principal architect of the complicated situation in Somalia\" through its support of [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gadebate.un.org/sites/default/files/gastatements/65/65_ET_en.pdf |title=Statement by H.E. Mr. Seyoum Mesfin, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, at the 65th Session of the United Nations General Assembly |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=23 September 2010 |website=United Nations General Assembly |publisher=United Nations |access-date=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nEritrea responded by accusing Ethiopia of using its speech to divert attention from its refusal to withdraw its troops from southern Eritrean territories, and of its [[Somali Civil War#TFG, Islamic Courts Union, and Ethiopia (2006\u201309)|failed attempt]] to support the [[Transitional federal government, Republic of Somalia|Transitional Federal Government of Somalia]]. The Delegation continued by stating that Ethiopia was using Eritrea as a scapegoat for the problems it had created Somalia. It further pointed out that it was Ethiopia\u2019s campaign in Somalia in 2006 that contributed to the rise of the Al-Shabaab, and not Eritrean support as Ethiopia claimed. Finally, it stated that Ethiopia had created one of the biggest humanitarian crises African had ever seen and that Ethiopia had significantly contributed to the destabilization of the Somalia. Eritrea finished by calling on Ethiopia to end its occupation of Eritrean territories in order to ensure stability in the region. \n<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Ethiopia''' <br>\nEthiopia used its Right of Reply to respond to Eritrea's Right of Reply. It reiterated that Eritrea was destabilizing the Horn of Africa, and that their sponsorship of various terrorist groups in the region had played a role. The Delegation further stated that despite Eritrea's role in the destabilization of the region, and the passage of UNSC Resolution 1907, that the international community had failed to take tangible measures to stop Eritrea. Ethiopia then accused the Eritrean regime of waging a campaign to deflect attention from itself by bringing up the border dispute between the two states, and making Eritrea out to be an \"underdog.\" Finally, it finished by calling upon the international community to exert more pressure on Eritrea to comply with UNSC Resolution 1907.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Pakistan''' <br>\nPakistan used its Right of Reply to respond to statements made by India in its General Debate speech before the Assembly. India, in its speech, stated that, [[Jammu and Kashmir (state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] was is an integral part of India, and that it had been the target of Pakistan-sponsored militancy and terrorism. India called upon Pakistan to fulfill its commitment to not to allow territory under its control to be used for terrorism directed against India. India finished by stating that Pakistan could not impart lessons  on democracy and human rights to the international community as long as it continued to allow terrorism against India to remain unchecked.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gadebate.un.org/sites/default/files/gastatements/65/65_IN_en.pdf |title=Statement by H.E. Mr. S. M. Krishna, Minister of External Affairs of India, at the General Debate of the 65th Session of the United Nations General Assembly |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=29 September 2010 |website=United Nations General Assembly |publisher=United Nations |access-date=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nPakistan responded by stating that Jammu and Kashmir is not an integral part of India, but rather, an internationally recognized disputed territory that is still being considered by the United Nations. It also mentioned that the United Nations had adopted more than a dozen resolutions calling for the settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute through a free and fair plebiscite. Pakistan then reminded India that its first Prime Minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], had said in a speech on 2 January 1952 that \"Kashmir is not the property of either India or Pakistan. It belongs to the Kashmiri people. When Kashmir acceded to India, we made it clear\nto the leaders of the Kashmiri people that we would ultimately abide by the verdict of their plebiscite.\" Pakistan stated that India had continued to violate several United Nations resolutions, and failed to fulfill the commitments made by its leaders.\n\nPakistan then stated that India had used their speech to distract the international community from their human rights violations of Kashmiris in Indian-occupied Kashmir. It brought up statements by [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] which both had called on the Indian authorities to take steps to ensure respect for the right to life of Kashmiri demonstrators, as well as to respect the [[United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials]]. Finally, Pakistan accused India of maligning Pakistan on the issue of terrorism in order to conceal the state terrorism it had been using to stifle Kashmiri voices demanding the right to self-determination.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Azerbaijan''' <br>\nAzerbaijan used its Right of Reply to respond to statements made by Armenia in its General Debate speech before the Assembly. Armenia, in its speech, stated that Azerbaijan was a threat to regional peace and security through its continued denial of the right to self-determination by the people of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] by rejecting the [[1991 Nagorno-Karabakh independence referendum|1991 independence referendum]]. Armenia continued by accusing Azerbaijan of attempting to cleanse the people of Nagorno-Karabakh from their ancestral home via a brutal war. Azerbaijan was then accused of undermining the peace process by misleading the international community by distorting of the nature of the conflict, by undermining the [[OSCE Minsk Group|Minsk Group]] by rejecting its proposed principles and by rejecting proposals to come to an agreement on the non-use of force or threat of force. Armenia finished by condemning Azerbaijan's destruction of thousands of cultural and religious heritage objects in the Nagorno-Karabakh region.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gadebate.un.org/sites/default/files/gastatements/65/65_AM_en_fr_0.pdf |title=Statement by H.E.

It further accused Armenia of unleashing the war, attacking Azerbaijan, occupying its ancestral territories, carrying out ethnic cleansing and establishing a subordinate separatist entity on captured Azerbaijani territory along ethnic lines. Azerbaijan also called into the question the legitimacy of the 1991 referendum, claiming that it was not recognized by the Security Council and the General Assembly. Finally, it called on Armenia to realize that in order for peace to be achieved, there was no alternative but to put a prompt end to its illegal occupation of Azerbaijani territory.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Armenia''' <br>\nArmenia used its Right of Reply to respond to Azerbaijan's Right of Reply. It replied by stating that claims of any military expansionism by Armenia made by Azerbaijan were totally misleading; asserting that Armenia had never started any aggression whatsoever. Armenia continued by pinning the full blame of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict on Azerbaijan, accusing them of starting a full-scale war against the people of Nagorno-Karabakh, thus forcing them to take up arms in order to protect their lives and homes. Finally, it finished by stating that Armenia had fully complied with the [[List of United Nations Security Council resolutions on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict|various Security Council resolutions]] concerning the conflict, whereas Azerbaijan had not, and was attempting to find a peaceful solution to the conflict.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Republic of Korea''' <br>\nThe Republic of Korea (ROK) used its Right of Reply to respond to statements made by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK) in its General Debate speech before the Assembly. The DPRK, in its speech, stated that, its efforts towards peaceful development were being constantly threatened and undermined. It then commented on the situation regarding the [[ROKS Cheonan sinking|''Cheonan'' incident]], and how sabre-rattling and arms build-ups by the United States and the ROK were leading the Korean peninsula to brink of war. It further rejected the findings of the international team that was assembled to investigate the sinking, citing the ROK's refusal to allow a team from the DPRK to investigate the incident for scientific and objective verification. Finally, the DPRK castigated the ROK, accusing them of rejecting reunification efforts by creating tension on the Korean peninsula by waging war exercises with outside forces and by stepping up an atmosphere of war against their fellow countrymen.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gadebate.un.org/sites/default/files/gastatements/65/65_KP_en.pdf |title=Statement by H.E. Mr. Pak Kil Yon, Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs and Head of Delegation of the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, at the sixty-fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=29 September 2010 |website=United Nations General Assembly |publisher=United Nations |access-date=27 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://gadebate.un.org/sites/default/files/gastatements/65/65_KR_en.pdf |title=Address by H.E.

Finally, it refuted the DPRK's claims that it was a nuclear-weapon state, citing reports of the [[2010 NPT Review Conference|eighth Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference]].<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/><ref>{{UN doc |docid=S/PRST/2010/13 |body=S |session=64 |type=PRST |resolution_number=13 |title=Statement by the President of the Security Council |date=9 July 2010 |accessdate= 27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n'''Eritrea''' <br>\nEritrea used its Right of Reply to respond to Ethiopia's Right of Reply. It stated that the key to resolving the problems between Eritrea and Ethiopia was the withdrawal of Ethiopian soldiers and institutions from Eritrean sovereign territories. It then mentioned that the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission had already delimited and demarcated the border, and that Ethiopia\u2019s dishonoring of the Commission's agreement by refusing to withdrawal its soldiers was irresponsible and shameful. Finally, it reminded the General Assembly that Ethiopia continues to be the only constant factor throughout the political crisis in Somalia, and that Ethiopia\u2019s continued meddling in the affairs of Somalia was dangerous to Somalis and to the rest of the region.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''India''' <br>\nIndia used its Right of Reply to respond to Pakistan's Right of Reply. India responded by stating that in its speech, Pakistan had made various baseless and false allegations against India. It continued by reminding Pakistan that it should concentrate on addressing the enormous challenges confronting it, such as terrorism, extremism and sectarianism, rather than making unsolicited remarks about the internal affairs of other states in an attempt to divert attention. Finally, it finished by stating that the [[Indian Constitution]] guaranteed the fundamental rights of all Indians, including those in Jammu and Kashmir, and that, contrary to claims made by Pakistan, free and fair elections in Jammu and Kashmir had been regularly held allowing people in the region to exercised their right to franchise in order to elect their representatives.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Azerbaijan''' <br>\nAzerbaijan used its Right of Reply to respond to Armenia's Right of Reply. It stated the United Nations should only be resorted to by\nMember States in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Organization and not misused for political advantage. It then accused Armenia of using the Organization to advocate for a culture of impunity and promote dangerous ideas of racial, ethnic and religious superiority. It further asserted that it considered Armenia's behavior an open challenge to the conflict settlement process and a threat to international and regional peace and security. Finally, it asked for the international communities help to persuade Armenia to cease its destructive policies, respect the generally accepted norms and principles of international law and negotiate in good faith with a view to achieving a durable solution to the conflict.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea''' <br>\nThe DPRK used its Right of Reply to respond to ROK's Right of Reply. It stated the ROK, in regards to the sinking of the ''Cheonan'' incident, was attempting to bring to the attention of the General Assembly an issue which not even the Security Council had prepared an appropriate judgement.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\nIt continued by reiterating that the DPRK had nothing to do with the sinking, and that the evidence presented by the ROK in the Joint Civilian-Military Investigation Group was not scientifically based or objective, and that it did nothing more but to raise conclusive doubts. It then mentioned that the ROK had rejected its offer to dispatch its own inspection group in order to verify the investigation's results objectively and scientifically, instead insisting that the international community should only accept the ROK's investigation results. It then stated that if the ROK had nothing to hide, then there was no reason for them not to accept the DPRK's inspection group to verify the investigation results, and that as long as the ROK refused to accept the inspection group, suspicion would continue to grow. \n\nFinally, it stated that it did not need the ROK, or any country, to recognize or accept the status of the DPRK as a nuclear State, and that their nuclear program was no created in order to intimidate, but rather as a means to deter attacks from the outside.<ref name=\"A/65/PV.24\"/>\n\n'''Ethiopia''' <br>\nEthiopia used its Right of Reply to touch upon the situation with Eritrea.
