{"title_page": "Ancient Egyptian technology", "text_new": "{{short description|devices, and technologies invented or used in Ancient Egypt}}\n'''Ancient Egyptian technology''' describes devices and technologies invented or used in [[Ancient Egypt]]. The [[Egyptians]] invented and used many [[simple machines]], such as the [[inclined plane|ramp]] and the [[lever]], to aid construction processes. They used [[rope]] [[truss]]es to stiffen the [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of ships. Egyptian [[paper]], made from [[papyrus]], and [[ancient Egyptian pottery|pottery]] were mass-produced and exported throughout the [[Mediterranean]] basin. The [[wheel]] was used for a number of purposes, but [[chariots]] only came into use after the [[Second Intermediate period]]. The Egyptians also played an important role in developing Mediterranean [[maritime history|maritime]] technology including [[ship]]s and [[lighthouse]]s. \n[[File:Ancient Egypt rope manufacture.jpg|thumb|222px|right|Ancient Egyptian depiction of women engaged in mechanical [[rope]] making, the first graphic evidence of the craft, shown in the two lower rows of the illustration]]\n\n==Technology in Dynastic Egypt==\nSignificant advances in [[ancient Egypt]] during the [[History of ancient Egypt|dynastic period]] include [[Egyptian astronomy|astronomy]], [[Egyptian mathematics|mathematics]], and [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|medicine]].

Egypt also was a center of [[Alchemy#Alchemy in Ancient Egypt|alchemy]] research for much of the western world.\n\n===Paper, Writing and Libraries===\n[[File:Egypt.Papyrus.01.jpg|thumb|222px|A section of the Egyptian [[Book of the Dead]], which is written and drawn on papyrus]]\nThe word ''paper'' comes from the Greek term for the ancient [[Egypt]]ian [[writing material]] called [[papyrus]], which was formed from beaten strips of [[Cyperus papyrus|papyrus plants]]. Papyrus was produced in Egypt as early as 3000&nbsp; BC, and was sold to ancient [[Greece]] and [[Rome]]. The establishment of the [[Library of Alexandria]] limited the supply of papyrus for others. According to the Roman historian [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] ([[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]] records, xiii.21), as a result of this, [[parchment]] was invented under the patronage of [[Eumenes II of Pergamon]] to build his rival library at [[Pergamon]]. However, this is a myth; parchment had been in use in Anatolia and elsewhere long before the rise of Pergamon.\n\n[[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], a [[phonetic]] [[writing system]], served as the basis for the [[Phoenician alphabet]] from which later alphabets, such as Hebrew, Greek, and Latin were derived. With this ability, writing and record-keeping, the Egyptians developed one of the \u2014if not ''the''\u2014 first [[Decimal|decimal system]].<ref>Georges Ifrah, The Universal History of Numbers.

According to Lucas and Harris, \u201creeds were plastered with clay in order to keep out of heat and cold more effectually\u201d.<ref>A. Lucas and J.

Some are in ruin from wear and tear, while others have been lost entirely. The Egyptian structures are among the largest constructions ever conceived and built by humans. They constitute one of the most potent and enduring symbols of Ancient Egyptian civilization. Temples and tombs built by a pharaoh famous for her projects, [[Hatshepsut]], were massive and included many colossal statues of her. Pharaoh [[Tutankamun]]'s rock-cut tomb in the Valley of the Kings was full of jewelry and antiques. In some late myths, [[Ptah]] was identified as the primordial mound and had called creation into being, he was considered the deity of craftsmen, and in particular, of stone-based crafts. [[Imhotep]], who was included in the [[Egyptian pantheon]], was the first documented engineer.<ref>{{cite we\nurl=http://whatiscivilengineering.csce.ca/history_engineering.htm |title=What is Civil Engineering: Imhotep |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112195627/http://whatiscivilengineering.csce.ca/history_engineering.htm |archivedate=2008-01-12 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:PHAROS2006.jpg|thumb|right|222px|The [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] on the island of Pharos.]]\nIn [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Hellenistic Egypt]], [[lighthouse]] technology was developed, the most famous example being the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]]. Alexandria was a port for the ships that traded the goods manufactured in Egypt or imported into Egypt. A giant cantilevered hoist lifted cargo to and from ships. The lighthouse itself was designed by [[Sostratus of Cnidus]] and built in the 3rd century BC (between 285 and 247&nbsp;BC) on the island of Pharos in [[Alexandria, Egypt]], which has since become a peninsula. This lighthouse was renowned in its time and knowledge of it was never lost. A 2006 drawing of it created from the study of many references, is shown at the right.\n\n====Monuments====\n{{main|Egyptian pyramids|Egyptian pyramid construction techniques}}\nThe Nile valley has been the site of one of the most influential [[civilization]]s in the world with its architectural monuments, which include the [[pyramids of Giza]] and the [[Great Sphinx]]\u2014among the largest and most famous buildings in the world.\n\n[[File:Egypt.Giza.Sphinx.01.jpg|222px|thumb|Giza Plateau, Cairo. Khafre's pyramid in the background]]\nThe most famous [[pyramid]]s are the [[Egyptian pyramids]]\u2014huge structures built of brick or stone, some of which are among the largest constructions by humans. Pyramids functioned as [[tomb]]s for [[pharaoh]]s. In Ancient Egypt, a pyramid was referred to as ''mer'', literally \"place of ascendance.\" The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] is the largest in Egypt and one of the largest in the world. The base is over {{convert|13|acre|m2}} in area. It is one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Seven Wonders of the World]], and the only one of the seven to survive into modern times. The [[Ancient Egypt]]ians capped the peaks of their pyramids with gold and covered their faces with polished white limestone, although many of the stones used for the finishing purpose have fallen or been removed for use on other structures over the millennia.\n\nThe [[Red Pyramid]] of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] (c.26th century BC), named for the light crimson hue of its exposed granite surfaces, is the third largest of [[Egyptian pyramids]]. [[Menkaure's Pyramid]], likely dating to the same era, was constructed of [[limestone]] and granite blocks. The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] (c. [[26th century BC|2580 BC]]) contains a huge granite [[sarcophagus]] fashioned of \"Red [[Aswan]] Granite.\" The mostly ruined [[Black Pyramid]] dating from the reign of [[Amenemhat III]] once had a polished granite [[pyramidion]] or capstone, now on display in the main hall of the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]] (see [[Dahshur]]). Other uses in [[Ancient Egypt]],<ref>[http://www.eeescience.utoledo.edu/Faculty/Harrell/Egypt/Mosques/CAIRO_Rocks_1.htm eeescience utoledo.edu : Cairo Rocks]</ref> include [[column]]s, door [[lintel]]s, [[Sill plate|sill]]s, [[jamb]]s, and wall and floor [[wiktionary:veneer|veneer]].\n\nThe ancient Egyptians had some of the first monumental stone buildings (such as in [[Sakkara]]). How the [[Egyptians]] worked the solid [[granite]] is still a matter of debate. Archaeologist [[Patrick Hunt (archeologist)|Patrick Hunt]]<ref>[http://hebsed.home.comcast.net/hunt.htm Arce/Nc Archives] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014031747/http://hebsed.home.comcast.net/hunt.htm |date=October 14, 2007 }}</ref> has postulated that the Egyptians used [[Emery (mineral)|emery]] shown to have higher [[Hardenability|hardness]] on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]]. Regarding construction, of the various methods possibly used by builders, the [[lever]] moved and uplifted [[obelisk]]s weighing more than 100 [[Tonne|tons]].\n\n====Obelisks and pillars====\n[[Obelisk]]s were a prominent part of the architecture of the ancient Egyptians, who placed them in pairs at the entrances of various monuments and important buildings, such as temples. In 1902, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica wrote, \"The earliest temple obelisk still in position is that of [[Senusret I]] of the XIIth Dynasty at Heliopolis (68&nbsp;feet high)\". The word \"obelisk\" is of Greek rather than Egyptian origin because Herodotus, the great traveler, was the first writer to describe the objects. Twenty-nine ancient Egyptian obelisks are known to have survived, plus the ''unfinished obelisk'' being built by [[Hatshepsut]] to celebrate her sixteenth year as pharaoh. It broke while being carved out of the quarry and was abandoned when another one was begun to replace it. The broken one was found at Aswan and provides the only insight into the methods of how they were hewn. The obelisk symbolized the sky deity [[Ra]] and during the brief religious reformation of Akhenaten, was said to be a petrified ray of the Aten, the sun disk. It is hypothesized by [[New York University]] [[Egyptologist]] Patricia Blackwell Gary and ''[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]]'' senior editor Richard Talcott that the shapes of the [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[pyramid]] and Obelisk were derived from natural phenomena associated with the [[sun]] (the sun-god [[Ra]] being the Egyptians' greatest deity).<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Patricia Blackwell Gary |author2=Richard Talcott |title=Stargazing in Ancient Egypt |journal=[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]] |pages=62\u20137 |date=June 2006 }}</ref> It was also thought that the deity existed within the structure. The Egyptians also used [[Column|pillar]]s extensively.\n\nIt is unknown whether the Ancient Egyptians had [[kite]]s, but a team led by Maureen Clemmons and Mory Gharib raised a 5,900-pound, {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} obelisk into vertical position with a kite, a system of pulleys, and a support frame.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Cite web |url=http://pr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12164.html |title=Caltech researchers successfully raised an obelisk with a kite to test theory about ancient pyramids |access-date=2007-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328212434/http://pr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12164.html |archive-date=2007-03-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Maureen Clemmons developed the idea that the ancient Egyptians used kites for work.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Ramps have been reported as being widely used in Ancient Egypt. A ramp is an inclined plane, or a plane surface set at an angle (other than a right angle) against a horizontal surface. The inclined plane permits one to overcome a large resistance by applying a relatively small force through a longer distance than the load is to be raised. In civil engineering the slope (ratio of rise/run) is often referred to as a grade or gradient. An inclined plane is one of the commonly-recognized simple machines. Maureen Clemmons subsequently led a team of researchers demonstrating a kite made of natural material and reinforced with shellac (which according to their research pulled with 97% the efficiency of nylon), in a 9&nbsp;mph wind, would easily pull an average 2-ton pyramid stone up the 1st two courses of a pyramid (in collaboration with Cal Poly, Pomona, on a 53-stone pyramid built in Rosamond, CA). \n[[File:Wells egyptian ship red sea.png|thumb|222px|Egyptian ship, 1250&nbsp;B.C.

This is governed by the [[science]] of [[aerodynamics]].<ref>A primary feature of a properly designed sail is an amount of \"[[draft (sailing)|draft]]\", caused by curvature of the surface of the sail.

They were made by winding molten glass around a metal bar and were highly prized as a trading commodity, especially blue beads, which were believed to have magical powers. The [[Egyptians]] made small jars and bottles using the core-formed method. Glass threads were wound around a bag of sand tied to a rod. The glass was continually reheated to fuse the threads together. The glass-covered sand bag was kept in motion until the required shape and thickness was achieved. The rod was allowed to cool, then finally the bag was punctured and the sand poured out and reused . The Egyptians also created the first colored glass rods which they used to create colorful beads and decorations. They also worked with cast glass, which was produced by pouring molten glass into a mold, much like [[iron]] and the more modern [[crucible steel]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.unc.edu/courses/rometech/public/content/arts_and_crafts/Susan_Hampton/Roman_Glass.html#Origin%20Myth| title = Glassmaking in Antiquity| accessdate = 2007-03-21| author = Susan Hampton| publisher = The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070405113459/http://www.unc.edu/courses/rometech/public/content/arts_and_crafts/Susan_Hampton/Roman_Glass.html| archivedate= 5 April 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Astronomy===\n{{main|Egyptian astronomy}}\n{{related|[[Egyptian calendar]]|[[Archaeoastronomy]]}}\nThe Egyptians were a practical people and this is reflected in their astronomy<ref>Ronald A Wells, \"Archaeoastronomy in Egypt\", in Walker, Christopher, Ed ''Astronomy before the telescope'', British Museum Press, 1996 p.28</ref> in contrast to Babylonia where the first astronomical texts were written in astrological terms.<ref>John Britton and Christopher Walker, Astrology and Astronomy in Mesopotamia, in Walker, Christopher, Ed ''Astronomy before the telescope'', British Museum Press, 1996 p. 42</ref> Even before Upper and Lower Egypt were unified in 3000 BCE, observations of the night sky had influenced the development of a religion in which many of its principal deities were heavenly bodies. In Lower Egypt, priests built circular mud-brick walls with which to make a false horizon where they could mark the position of the sun as it rose at dawn, and then with a plumb-bob note the northern or southern turning points (solstices). This allowed them to discover that the sun disc, personified as Ra, took 365 days to travel from his birthplace at the winter solstice and back to it. Meanwhile, in Upper Egypt a lunar calendar was being developed based on the behavior of the moon and the reappearance of [[Sirius]] in its [[heliacal rising]] after its annual absence of about 70 days.<ref>Tyldesley, Joyce, Pyramids: The Real Story Behind Egypt's Ancient Monuments, Viking, 2003, p. 74</ref>\n\nAfter unification, problems with trying to work with two calendars (both depending upon constant observation) led to a merged, simplified civil calendar with twelve 30-day months, three seasons of four months each, plus an extra five days, giving a 365-year day but with no way of accounting for the extra quarter day each year. Day and night were split into 24 units, each personified by a deity. A sundial found on Seti I's cenotaph with instructions for its use shows us that the daylight hours were at one time split into 10 units, with 12 hours for the night and an hour for the morning and evening twilights.<ref>{{Cite book | edition = 2 | publisher = [[Dover Publications]] | last = Neugebauer | first = Otto | author-link = Otto E.

Out of Egyptian myths such as those around Ra and the sky goddess [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]] came the development of the [[Egyptian calendar]], time keeping, and even concepts of royalty. An astronomical ceiling in the burial chamber of [[Ramesses VI]] shows the sun being born from Nut in the morning, traveling along her body during the day and being swallowed at night.\n\nDuring the [[Fifth Dynasty]] six kings built sun temples in honour of Ra. The temple complexes built by [[Niuserre]] at [[Abu Gurab]] and [[Userkaf]] at [[Abusir]] have been excavated and have astronomical alignments, and the roofs of some of the buildings could have been used by observers to view the stars, calculate the hours at night and predict the sunrise for religious festivals.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n[[File:Dendera.jpg|222px|thumb|The [[Dendera Zodiac]] was on the ceiling of the Greco-Roman temple of Hathor at Dendera]]\n\nClaims have been made that [[precession of the equinoxes]] was known in [[Ancient Egypt]] prior to the time of [[Hipparchus]].<ref>{{cite book |last=De Santillana |first=G. |last2=Von Dechend |first2=H. |title=Hamlet's Mill |year=1977 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ql7ATHGee50C |publisher=David R.

Fagan|page=123|chapter=Esoteric Egypt}}</ref>\n\nNote however that the Egyptian observation of a slowly changing stellar alignment over a multi-year period does not necessarily mean that they understood or even cared what was going on. For instance, from the Middle Kingdom onwards they used a table with entries for each month to tell the time of night from the passing of constellations. These went in error after a few centuries because of their calendar and precession, but were copied (with scribal errors) long after they lost their practical usefulness or the possibility of understanding and use of them in the current years, rather than the years in which they were originally used.\n\n===Medicine===\n{{main|Ancient Egyptian medicine}}the best place in the world\nThe [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]] is one of the first medical documents still extant, and perhaps the earliest document which attempts to describe and analyze the brain: given this, it might be seen as the very beginnings of [[neuroscience]].

Papyrus was produced in Egypt as early as 3000&nbsp; BC, and was sold to ancient [[Greece]] and [[Rome]]. The establishment of the [[Library of Alexandria]] limited the supply of papyrus for others. According to the Roman historian [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] ([[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]] records, xiii.21), as a result of this, [[parchment]] was invented under the patronage of [[Eumenes II of Pergamon]] to build his rival library at [[Pergamon]]. However, this is a myth; parchment had been in use in Anatolia and elsewhere long before the rise of Pergamon.\n\n[[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], a [[phonetic]] [[writing system]], served as the basis for the [[Phoenician alphabet]] from which later alphabets, such as Hebrew, Greek, and Latin were derived. With this ability, writing and record-keeping, the Egyptians developed one of the \u2014if not ''the''\u2014 first [[Decimal|decimal system]].<ref>Georges Ifrah, The Universal History of Numbers.

Some are in ruin from wear and tear, while others have been lost entirely. The Egyptian structures are among the largest constructions ever conceived and built by humans. They constitute one of the most potent and enduring symbols of Ancient Egyptian civilization. Temples and tombs built by a pharaoh famous for her projects, [[Hatshepsut]], were massive and included many colossal statues of her. Pharaoh [[Tutankamun]]'s rock-cut tomb in the Valley of the Kings was full of jewelry and antiques. In some late myths, [[Ptah]] was identified as the primordial mound and had called creation into being, he was considered the deity of craftsmen, and in particular, of stone-based crafts. [[Imhotep]], who was included in the [[Egyptian pantheon]], was the first documented engineer.<ref>{{cite we\nurl=http://whatiscivilengineering.csce.ca/history_engineering.htm |title=What is Civil Engineering: Imhotep |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112195627/http://whatiscivilengineering.csce.ca/history_engineering.htm |archivedate=2008-01-12 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:PHAROS2006.jpg|thumb|right|222px|The [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] on the island of Pharos.]]\nIn [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Hellenistic Egypt]], [[lighthouse]] technology was developed, the most famous example being the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]]. Alexandria was a port for the ships that traded the goods manufactured in Egypt or imported into Egypt. A giant cantilevered hoist lifted cargo to and from ships. The lighthouse itself was designed by [[Sostratus of Cnidus]] and built in the 3rd century BC (between 285 and 247&nbsp;BC) on the island of Pharos in [[Alexandria, Egypt]], which has since become a peninsula. This lighthouse was renowned in its time and knowledge of it was never lost. A 2006 drawing of it created from the study of many references, is shown at the right.\n\n====Monuments====\n{{main|Egyptian pyramids|Egyptian pyramid construction techniques}}\nThe Nile valley has been the site of one of the most influential [[civilization]]s in the world with its architectural monuments, which include the [[pyramids of Giza]] and the [[Great Sphinx]]\u2014among the largest and most famous buildings in the world.\n\n[[File:Egypt.Giza.Sphinx.01.jpg|222px|thumb|Giza Plateau, Cairo. Khafre's pyramid in the background]]\nThe most famous [[pyramid]]s are the [[Egyptian pyramids]]\u2014huge structures built of brick or stone, some of which are among the largest constructions by humans. Pyramids functioned as [[tomb]]s for [[pharaoh]]s. In Ancient Egypt, a pyramid was referred to as ''mer'', literally \"place of ascendance.\" The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] is the largest in Egypt and one of the largest in the world. The base is over {{convert|13|acre|m2}} in area. It is one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Seven Wonders of the World]], and the only one of the seven to survive into modern times. The [[Ancient Egypt]]ians capped the peaks of their pyramids with gold and covered their faces with polished white limestone, although many of the stones used for the finishing purpose have fallen or been removed for use on other structures over the millennia.\n\nThe [[Red Pyramid]] of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] (c.26th century BC), named for the light crimson hue of its exposed granite surfaces, is the third largest of [[Egyptian pyramids]]. [[Menkaure's Pyramid]], likely dating to the same era, was constructed of [[limestone]] and granite blocks. The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] (c. [[26th century BC|2580 BC]]) contains a huge granite [[sarcophagus]] fashioned of \"Red [[Aswan]] Granite.\" The mostly ruined [[Black Pyramid]] dating from the reign of [[Amenemhat III]] once had a polished granite [[pyramidion]] or capstone, now on display in the main hall of the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]] (see [[Dahshur]]). Other uses in [[Ancient Egypt]],<ref>[http://www.eeescience.utoledo.edu/Faculty/Harrell/Egypt/Mosques/CAIRO_Rocks_1.htm eeescience utoledo.edu : Cairo Rocks]</ref> include [[column]]s, door [[lintel]]s, [[Sill plate|sill]]s, [[jamb]]s, and wall and floor [[wiktionary:veneer|veneer]].\n\nThe ancient Egyptians had some of the first monumental stone buildings (such as in [[Sakkara]]). How the [[Egyptians]] worked the solid [[granite]] is still a matter of debate. Archaeologist [[Patrick Hunt (archeologist)|Patrick Hunt]]<ref>[http://hebsed.home.comcast.net/hunt.htm Arce/Nc Archives] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014031747/http://hebsed.home.comcast.net/hunt.htm |date=October 14, 2007 }}</ref> has postulated that the Egyptians used [[Emery (mineral)|emery]] shown to have higher [[Hardenability|hardness]] on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]]. Regarding construction, of the various methods possibly used by builders, the [[lever]] moved and uplifted [[obelisk]]s weighing more than 100 [[Tonne|tons]].\n\n====Obelisks and pillars====\n[[Obelisk]]s were a prominent part of the architecture of the ancient Egyptians, who placed them in pairs at the entrances of various monuments and important buildings, such as temples. In 1902, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica wrote, \"The earliest temple obelisk still in position is that of [[Senusret I]] of the XIIth Dynasty at Heliopolis (68&nbsp;feet high)\". The word \"obelisk\" is of Greek rather than Egyptian origin because Herodotus, the great traveler, was the first writer to describe the objects. Twenty-nine ancient Egyptian obelisks are known to have survived, plus the ''unfinished obelisk'' being built by [[Hatshepsut]] to celebrate her sixteenth year as pharaoh. It broke while being carved out of the quarry and was abandoned when another one was begun to replace it. The broken one was found at Aswan and provides the only insight into the methods of how they were hewn. The obelisk symbolized the sky deity [[Ra]] and during the brief religious reformation of Akhenaten, was said to be a petrified ray of the Aten, the sun disk. It is hypothesized by [[New York University]] [[Egyptologist]] Patricia Blackwell Gary and ''[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]]'' senior editor Richard Talcott that the shapes of the [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[pyramid]] and Obelisk were derived from natural phenomena associated with the [[sun]] (the sun-god [[Ra]] being the Egyptians' greatest deity).<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Patricia Blackwell Gary |author2=Richard Talcott |title=Stargazing in Ancient Egypt |journal=[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]] |pages=62\u20137 |date=June 2006 }}</ref> It was also thought that the deity existed within the structure. The Egyptians also used [[Column|pillar]]s extensively.\n\nIt is unknown whether the Ancient Egyptians had [[kite]]s, but a team led by Maureen Clemmons and Mory Gharib raised a 5,900-pound, {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} obelisk into vertical position with a kite, a system of pulleys, and a support frame.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Cite web |url=http://pr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12164.html |title=Caltech researchers successfully raised an obelisk with a kite to test theory about ancient pyramids |access-date=2007-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328212434/http://pr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12164.html |archive-date=2007-03-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Maureen Clemmons developed the idea that the ancient Egyptians used kites for work.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Ramps have been reported as being widely used in Ancient Egypt. A ramp is an inclined plane, or a plane surface set at an angle (other than a right angle) against a horizontal surface. The inclined plane permits one to overcome a large resistance by applying a relatively small force through a longer distance than the load is to be raised. In civil engineering the slope (ratio of rise/run) is often referred to as a grade or gradient. An inclined plane is one of the commonly-recognized simple machines.

They were made by winding molten glass around a metal bar and were highly prized as a trading commodity, especially blue beads, which were believed to have magical powers. The [[Egyptians]] made small jars and bottles using the core-formed method. Glass threads were wound around a bag of sand tied to a rod. The glass was continually reheated to fuse the threads together. The glass-covered sand bag was kept in motion until the required shape and thickness was achieved. The rod was allowed to cool, then finally the bag was punctured and the sand poured out and reused . The Egyptians also created the first colored glass rods which they used to create colorful beads and decorations. They also worked with cast glass, which was produced by pouring molten glass into a mold, much like [[iron]] and the more modern [[crucible steel]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.unc.edu/courses/rometech/public/content/arts_and_crafts/Susan_Hampton/Roman_Glass.html#Origin%20Myth| title = Glassmaking in Antiquity| accessdate = 2007-03-21| author = Susan Hampton| publisher = The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070405113459/http://www.unc.edu/courses/rometech/public/content/arts_and_crafts/Susan_Hampton/Roman_Glass.html| archivedate= 5 April 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Astronomy===\n{{main|Egyptian astronomy}}\n{{related|[[Egyptian calendar]]|[[Archaeoastronomy]]}}\nThe Egyptians were a practical people and this is reflected in their astronomy<ref>Ronald A Wells, \"Archaeoastronomy in Egypt\", in Walker, Christopher, Ed ''Astronomy before the telescope'', British Museum Press, 1996 p.28</ref> in contrast to Babylonia where the first astronomical texts were written in astrological terms.<ref>John Britton and Christopher Walker, Astrology and Astronomy in Mesopotamia, in Walker, Christopher, Ed ''Astronomy before the telescope'', British Museum Press, 1996 p. 42</ref> Even before Upper and Lower Egypt were unified in 3000 BCE, observations of the night sky had influenced the development of a religion in which many of its principal deities were heavenly bodies. In Lower Egypt, priests built circular mud-brick walls with which to make a false horizon where they could mark the position of the sun as it rose at dawn, and then with a plumb-bob note the northern or southern turning points (solstices). This allowed them to discover that the sun disc, personified as Ra, took 365 days to travel from his birthplace at the winter solstice and back to it. Meanwhile, in Upper Egypt a lunar calendar was being developed based on the behavior of the moon and the reappearance of [[Sirius]] in its [[heliacal rising]] after its annual absence of about 70 days.<ref>Tyldesley, Joyce, Pyramids: The Real Story Behind Egypt's Ancient Monuments, Viking, 2003, p. 74</ref>\n\nAfter unification, problems with trying to work with two calendars (both depending upon constant observation) led to a merged, simplified civil calendar with twelve 30-day months, three seasons of four months each, plus an extra five days, giving a 365-year day but with no way of accounting for the extra quarter day each year. Day and night were split into 24 units, each personified by a deity. A sundial found on Seti I's cenotaph with instructions for its use shows us that the daylight hours were at one time split into 10 units, with 12 hours for the night and an hour for the morning and evening twilights.<ref>{{Cite book | edition = 2 | publisher = [[Dover Publications]] | last = Neugebauer | first = Otto | author-link = Otto E.

Out of Egyptian myths such as those around Ra and the sky goddess [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]] came the development of the [[Egyptian calendar]], time keeping, and even concepts of royalty. An astronomical ceiling in the burial chamber of [[Ramesses VI]] shows the sun being born from Nut in the morning, traveling along her body during the day and being swallowed at night.\n\nDuring the [[Fifth Dynasty]] six kings built sun temples in honour of Ra. The temple complexes built by [[Niuserre]] at [[Abu Gurab]] and [[Userkaf]] at [[Abusir]] have been excavated and have astronomical alignments, and the roofs of some of the buildings could have been used by observers to view the stars, calculate the hours at night and predict the sunrise for religious festivals.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n[[File:Dendera.jpg|222px|thumb|The [[Dendera Zodiac]] was on the ceiling of the Greco-Roman temple of Hathor at Dendera]]\n\nClaims have been made that [[precession of the equinoxes]] was known in [[Ancient Egypt]] prior to the time of [[Hipparchus]].<ref>{{cite book |last=De Santillana |first=G. |last2=Von Dechend |first2=H. |title=Hamlet's Mill |year=1977 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ql7ATHGee50C |publisher=David R.

Fagan|page=123|chapter=Esoteric Egypt}}</ref>\n\nNote however that the Egyptian observation of a slowly changing stellar alignment over a multi-year period does not necessarily mean that they understood or even cared what was going on. For instance, from the Middle Kingdom onwards they used a table with entries for each month to tell the time of night from the passing of constellations. These went in error after a few centuries because of their calendar and precession, but were copied (with scribal errors) long after they lost their practical usefulness or the possibility of understanding and use of them in the current years, rather than the years in which they were originally used.\n\n===Medicine===\n{{main|Ancient Egyptian medicine}}\nThe [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]] is one of the first medical documents still extant, and perhaps the earliest document which attempts to describe and analyze the brain: given this, it might be seen as the very beginnings of [[neuroscience]].

The series features popular [[Music video|music videos]] played during its countdown, and was also used as a promotion tool by musicians, actors, and other [[celebrity|celebrities]] to promote their newest works to the show's target [[Teen culture|teen]] [[demographics|demographic]].\n\nDuring the original run of the program, ''TRL'' played the ten most [[Request (broadcasting)|requested]] music videos of the day, as voted by viewers via phone or online. The show generally aired Monday through Thursday for one hour, though the scheduling and length of the show fluctuated over the years. Although ''TRL'' was billed as a live show, many episodes were actually pre-recorded. Due to declining ratings, and the larger secular decline of music-based television in favor of online services, MTV would announce the cancellation of ''TRL'' on  September 15, 2008.<ref name=\"Report: MTV to Cancel TRL\">{{cite news|title=Report: MTV to Cancel TRL|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6596363.html|work=Broadcasting & Cable|date=September 15, 2008|accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref> The special three-hour finale episode, ''Total Finale Live'', aired on November 16, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1597023/20081014/knowles_beyonce.jhtml|title=Beyonce To Perform On 'TRL' Finale|publisher=}}</ref> \n\nLess than a decade later, ''TRL'' would be revived on October 2, 2017.<ref name=\"MTV Mines the Past\">{{cite web|last1=Koblin|first1=John|title=MTV Mines the Past for Its Future: \u2018Total Request Live\u2019|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/30/business/media/mtv-total-request-live-revival.html|website=New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref> In 2019, the show aired Saturday mornings at 10am ET as ''TRL Top 10''.\n\n==History==\n===Origin===\n''Total Request Live'' originated from several pre-existing programs on [[MTV]]. ''[[Dial MTV]]'', the first video request show on the network, had aired from 1986 to 1996. In 1997, MTV launched two new shows that became the predecessors of ''TRL'': ''[[Total Request]]'', a revival of the ''Dial MTV'' concept hosted by [[Carson Daly]], and ''[[MTV Live (U.S. TV program)|MTV Live]]'', which was hosted by [[Toby Amies]] and featured live performances and interviews from musical artists.\n\n{{MTV}}\n''Total Request'' was more subdued than ''MTV Live'', as Daly introduced music videos from an empty, dimly lit set. As the show progressed and gained more momentum with viewers tuning in, it was soon added to the list of daytime programming during MTV's ''Summer Share'' in [[Seaside Heights, New Jersey]]. The countdown would prove to be one of the most watched and most interactive shows in recent MTV history, demonstrating that it had potential to become an even larger success by combining with the element of live television.\n\n===Original Run (1998-2008)===\n====Carson Daly era ====\nIn Fall 1998, MTV producers merged the real-time aspect of ''MTV Live'' with the fan-controlled countdown power of ''Total Request'' into ''Total Request Live''. The program made its debut from MTV Studios on September 14, 1998. The show then grew to become MTV's unofficial [[flagship]] program.\n\nThe original host of ''TRL'', [[Carson Daly]], brought popularity to the show. The widely known abbreviation of ''TRL'' was adopted as the official title of the show in February 1999, after Daly and [[Dave Holmes (actor)|Dave Holmes]] began using the abbreviation on-air regularly. In the years following, the program was rarely referred to by its complete title. The show's countdown started off successfully while receiving hundreds of votes for Original Favorite Stars such as [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]], [[Aaliyah]], [[Eminem]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Korn]], [['N Sync]], and [[Backstreet Boys]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idolator.com/7667301/mtvs-total-request-live-trl-the-real-story-memorable-moments|title=MTV's Total Request Live (TRL): The Real Story & Memorable Moments|date=August 8, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n''TRL'' spent its first year developing a cult-type following.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/cool/etc/trl.html|title=Inside Total Request Live - Merchants Of Cool - FRONTLINE - PBS|website=www.pbs.org}}</ref> In the fall of 1999, a live studio audience was added to the show. By spring 2000, the countdown reached its peak, becoming a very recognizable pop culture icon in its first two years of existence. A weekend edition of the show known as ''TRL Weekend'', with a countdown consisting an average of the week's Top 10, aired for a short time in 2000.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn 2001, the popularity of ''TRL'' was at such a level that it spawned a country music spin-off, ''[[CMT Most Wanted Live]]'', on sister network [[Country Music Television|CMT]], until 2004.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nSome evolutionary changes were made to ''TRL'' throughout the next couple of years. The show received a new set and on-screen graphics for the debut of the fall 2001 season. A year later, on October 23, 2002, ''TRL'' celebrated its 1,000th episode. The number-one video on that day was \"[[Dirrty]]\" by [[Christina Aguilera]]. Also throughout the year of 2002, original host Carson Daly would be seen gradually less and less.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The show had near-daily segments from [[MTV News]] correspondents reporting on the latest in national or entertainment and music news from inside the studio.\n\n====Post-Carson Daly era====\nIn 2003, the next generation of ''TRL'' was ushered in as Carson Daly officially stepped down as host.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/carson-daly-looks-67039/|title=Carson Daly Looks Back as TRL Counts Down its Final Days|date=November 14, 2008|publisher=}}</ref> He left the show to host his own talk show, [[NBC]]'s ''[[Last Call with Carson Daly]]'', which premiered a year earlier. Following Daly stepping down, a revolving door of VJs hosted ''TRL'', including [[Damien Fahey]], [[Hilarie Burton]], [[Vanessa Minnillo]], [[Quddus (MTV)|Quddus]], [[La La Vasquez]], and [[Susie Castillo]]. Some of these VJs made their debut on the show in earlier years, so they already had the opportunity to host the show on days in which Daly was not present.\n\nSome changes were made to ''TRL'''s voting process in 2005. The show previously allowed anyone to vote online multiple times, but as part of these changes, only registered members on MTV.com could vote online. Additionally, a limit of one vote per day was added. Then, on July 10, 2006, MTV announced that votes would no longer be taken by phone, ending the legacy of the \"DIAL MTV\" phone number, which had been in use for voting on MTV since the premiere of the countdown show ''[[Dial MTV]]'' in the mid-1980s.\n\n[[File:TRL studios in Times Square in 2006.jpg|thumb|upright=1|''TRL'''s studios in Times Square in 2006.]]\n\nIn September 2006, ''TRL'' reached its eighth anniversary and, at that point, it was the longest-running live program that MTV had ever produced. It is also the third-longest-running program of all time in the network's history, following behind ''[[The Real World]]'', which has aired for the past 21 years, and ''[[120 Minutes]]'', which aired for 17 years. Around this time, ''TRL'' began airing officially on just four days a week (Monday through Thursday), as opposed to all five weekdays.\n\nOn November 2, 2006, ''TRL'' debuted what was billed as the first-ever [[hip hop]] [[public service announcement]] on [[global warming]]. The three-minute piece, titled \"Trees\", warned about deforestation and the dangers of global warming. The video corresponded with MTV's social campaign, ''Break the Addiction'', as part of ''think MTV''.\n\nThe hosts of ''TRL'' in 2008 were [[Damien Fahey]] and [[Lyndsey Rodrigues]]. Additionally, [[Stephen Colletti]], former cast member on ''[[Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County|Laguna Beach]]'', has appeared on ''TRL'' as host numerous times. The rest of the VJs are or have been working on separate projects. [[La La Vasquez]] went on to go work on her debut rap album {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. [[Hilarie Burton]] left ''TRL'' in 2004, after joining the cast of [[The WB]]/[[The CW|CW]]'s ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'', playing [[Peyton Sawyer]]. Quddus hosted from 2001 to 2006. He left to move to California to be a host of ''[[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]] Access''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/in/quddusphilippe|title=Quddus CV|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn May 22, 2007, ''TRL'' celebrated its 2000th episode, showing highlights from the past 2000 episodes, and a special countdown of ten of the most successful videos to ever appear on the show. [[Justin Timberlake]]'s \"[[Cry Me a River (Justin Timberlake song)|Cry Me a River]]\" topped the special countdown.\n\n====The end of ''TRL''====\nIn 2007, rumors began circulating stating that the ratings-challenged music video countdown show was to be canceled. In early 2007, an average of 373,000 viewers regularly watched the program.<ref name=\"forbes\">{{cite web|last=Hau|first=Louis|title=R.I.P.

In February 2007, MTV said the rumor was unfounded and claimed ''TRL'' will continue to air for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe producers of ''TRL'' experimented with web-based viewer interaction throughout the 2006\u20132007 season, showing [[viral videos]], allowing viewers to send feedback on a video via [[internet forum]]s and [[webcams]], along with a heavy emphasis on MTV's since discontinued Overdrive video portal. However, MTV still secretly planned to cancel the show and replace one with even more emphasis on viewer interaction, named ''YouRL'' (a [[homophone]] of [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]].)<ref>{{cite news|last=Becker|first=Anne|title=MTV Favors 'YouRL' Swap for 'TRL'|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/mtv-favors-%E2%80%98yourl%E2%80%99-swap-%E2%80%98trl%E2%80%99/82534|work=Broadcasting & Cable|date=April 30, 2007|accessdate=2015-01-27}}</ref>\n\nConsequently, in July 2007, it was reported that ''YouRL'' was not received well by test audiences and that the concept of YouRL has been abandoned for the time being.

The Rejects spent the entire episode assisting in the tear down of the set which was a theme for the episode.  At the end of the episode, Lindsey and Damien cooperatively added the last step in the demolition process by shutting down all the lights.  Preceding was a montage of cast and crew members saying their goodbyes by waving to the camera.\n\nA three-hour special marking the end of the show aired on November 16, 2008.<ref name=\"Report: MTV to Cancel TRL\"/> Several artists made appearances, including [[Ludacris]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Nelly]], [[Beyonc\u00e9]], [[50 Cent]], [[Fall Out Boy]], [[Backstreet Boys]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Kid Rock]], [[JC Chasez]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Travis Barker]], [[Taylor Swift]], [[Hilary Duff]], [[Eminem]], and [[Korn]]'s [[Jonathan Davis]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|date=November 11, 2008|title=Superstars Sign on For 'TRL' Finale|work=Billboard|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1043531/superstars-sign-on-for-trl-finale|accessdate=2008-11-11}}</ref> Former host Carson Daly described the media atmosphere after his departure from ''TRL'', in an interview with ''TV Guide'': \"MySpace was sold.

The program featured the return of a top ten countdown focusing on a specific playlist (Monday Motivation being the first countdown).<ref name=Andreeva2018/>\n\n2019 saw another retooling and name change as ''TRL Top 10'', which featured hosts Sway, Kevan Kenney and Jamila Mustafa. An off-shoot of the program, ''Fresh Out Fridays'', aired for several weeks on [[MTV2]] and covered everything new in music, pop culture, and fashion. TRL's ''Fresh Out Fridays'' aired a \"Playlist Of The Decade\" special on December 18, 2019 on [[MTV]], which covered the top 10 videos and pop culture moments of the 2010s. TRL has yet to return in 2020, but Fresh Out Fridays returned on February 7, 2020 on [[MTV]] as Fresh Out Live. Unlike its half-hour [[MTV2]] predecessor, Fresh Out Live has a runtime of around eight minutes. Starting Saturday, February 8, 2020, [[MTV]] airs a weekly one-hour block of music videos at 8AM ET under the name Fresh Out Playlist. This is the only block of long-form music videos [[MTV]] plays on its flagship channel.\n[[File:Trl-am-logo.jpg|thumb|upright=1|''Total Request AM'' logo]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Impact==\n{{fansite|section|date=December 2018}}\n''TRL'' is widely viewed as the show that launched the careers of many artists from the late 1990s and early 2000s. The show was featured as a main plot point in the movie ''[[Drake & Josh Go Hollywood]]'', produced by sister network [[Nickelodeon]].\n\n===Boy bands===\nEven though clean-cut [[boy band]]s like [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[NSYNC]] reached success before ''TRL'' began in the fall of 1998, both groups only reached their commercial peaks after their videos were seen on ''TRL''. In 1999, the Backstreet Boys' second LP, ''[[Millennium (Backstreet Boys album)|Millennium]]'', achieved the highest first week sales ever from an LP at the time.\n\nNSYNC also appeared on ''TRL'' in 2000, when their second LP, ''[[No Strings Attached ('N Sync album)|No Strings Attached]]'', topped the Backstreet Boys' first week sales. Once again, the large number of fans in attendance closed down the streets of Times Square. Throughout most of 1998, 1999, and 2000, videos by the Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC would claim the top position on the countdown.\n\n===Pop princesses===\nPop singers like [[Britney Spears]], [[Christina Aguilera]], and [[Jessica Simpson]] all made their music debuts on ''TRL'' as well. Britney and Christina became regulars on the show and would often appear as a guest. Simpson would not enjoy the same type of success until two years later, when she released the \"[[Irresistible (Jessica Simpson song)|Irresistible]]\" video, which reached number two on the countdown. [[Mandy Moore]] saw success on the show with her debut single's \"[[Candy (Mandy Moore song)|Candy]]\" in 1999 and \"[[I Wanna Be with You (Mandy Moore song)|I Wanna Be with You]]\", but did not score her first number-one video until her 2002 single \"[[Crush (Mandy Moore song)|Crush]]\" which she also performed on the show.\n\n[[Jessica Simpson]]'s younger sister [[Ashlee Simpson]] is another pop princess that has had some success on ''TRL'' with her first music video \"[[Pieces of Me (song)|Pieces of Me]]\" in 2004. Ashlee Simpson had three videos in the number one and one close to retirement. She would go on to score a number of number one videos on the show.\n\nThe artist with the most retirees videos is pop princess [[Britney Spears]] with 13 videos retired, an honorary retired video (\"[[I'm a Slave 4 U]]\") and three videos retired number one.\n\nA pop princess streak occurred in March 2007: The number one and number two spots were women for every show. There was no other month in the history of ''TRL'' where every show had a woman at the top spot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popfusion.net/forums/showthread.php?t=43280|title=ATRL \u2013 TRL Recap (March & April 2007)<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atrl.net/trlarchive/ |title=The TRL Archive \u2013 Recap, records, and statistics for MTV's Total Request Live |publisher=ATRL |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>\n\n===Rock bands===\nAlthough best known for featuring pop acts, ''TRL'' regularly featured videos and performances from rock bands in genres such as [[nu metal]], [[pop punk]] and [[emo pop]].

Started on [[MTV Italy]] on November 2, 1999, it was hosted by [[Marco Maccarini]] and [[Giorgia Surina]], followed by [[Federico Russo (presenter)|Federico Russo]] and Carolina Di Domenico. Since the 2005\u201306 season, Surina returned to ''TRL'' with a new co-host, [[Alessandro Cattelan]]. After the 2005\u201306 season, the show was hosted only by Alessandro Cattelan. For the season 2007\u201308 the show was hosted for the first moment by [[Alessandro Cattelan]] and Elena Santarelli, and for the summer the male host was replaced by Carlo Pastore. Later Carlo Pastore was still the main host, but the female host changed to [[Elisabetta Canalis]]. Throughout its 8 seasons, ''TRL'' was broadcast from [[Milan]], Rome, [[Venice]], [[Naples]], [[Genoa]] and [[Turin]]. ''TRL Italy'' is the longest-running show on MTV Italy: on December 23, 2004, a special two-hour event, \"TRL #1000\", was aired to celebrate the program's 1000th episode. From 2006 to 2012, there was also a program called ''[[TRL Awards (Italy)|TRL Awards]]'' where the people choose the artist of the year via web or mobile, and in summer 2007 was aired a special weekly-appointement called ''TRL Extra Live'', who famous Italian singers did a mini-concert. The last version of the program was hosted by Brenda Lodigiani, Alessandro Arcodia, Wintana Rezene and Andrea Cadioli, under the name ''TRL on the Road'', and ended on September 24, 2010.\n[[File:Trltitlescreen.jpg|thumb|upright|''TRL'' logo used in Italy.]]\n* [[MTV Rom\u00e2nia]] launched the Romanian version of ''TRL'' from an [[Orange Rom\u00e2nia|Orange]] concept store on [[Calea Victoriei]] (a major commercial avenue in the center of [[Bucharest]]) on January 23, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.ro/trl|title=MTV.ro|website=MTV.ro|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415152935/http://www.mtv.ro/trl/|archivedate=April 15, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The show aired two times a week, on Tuesday and Wednesday. The graphic was similar to that of the Italian version. The show has closed during 2009.\n* The British version, known as ''[[TRL UK]]'', was hosted by [[Dave Berry (presenter)|Dave Berry]], [[Alex Zane]], [[Jo Good]], and Maxine Akhtar. It was broadcast live from [[Viacom International Media Networks (Europe)|MTV Networks Europe]] Studios in [[Camden, London]], then moving to [[Leicester Square]] in London from second series. Following the second series' broadcast from Leicester Square, the top 10 countdown was removed from the show. The second series finished at the end of 2005 and the show never returned to air.\n* The Australian version of ''TRL'' began as a weekend show, but then began aired live Monday through Friday. It was hosted by Maz Compton, Lyndsey Rodrigues, Nathan Sapsford, and Jason Robert Dundas. In early 2006, it returned to airing only on Friday evenings. The show was cancelled at the end of 2006 and was replaced by \"The Lair\". A revival of ''TRL'' returned in 2019. It is hosted by Ash London, Angus O'Loughlin, Flex Mami, and Lisa Hamilton.\n* After a Polish version of ''TRL'' was unsuccessful, [[MTV Poland]] decided to launch a new chart show based on ''TRL''{{'}}s structure titled ''RMF MAXXX Hits'', which aired from Monday to Saturday at 2 p.m.\n* [[MTV France]] has launched the French version ({{lang|fr|Ton Request Live}}) of the American show on January 24, 2007. The format was different from the original concept: there wasn't the countdown with the 10 favourite videos and in every episode there was a movie's mini-documentaries entitled \"{{lang|fr|TRL en Movies}}\". The show closed after only an episode on January 25, 2007 and it has cancelled from the schedule of [[MTV France]].\n* The German version of ''TRL'' was very successful throughout Europe (after Italy), and it was known as ''Total Request Live Germany''. ''TRL Germany'' had the highest television ratings of all the ''TRL'' versions in Europe. The show was hosted by Joko Winterscheidt and [[Mirjam Weichselbraun]] or Patrice Bou\u00e9dib\u00e9la from Tuesday to Friday from 4:30 to 5:30&nbsp;pm, and it was divided in four versions: ''Urban TRL'' (hip hop music), ''Rock TRL'' (rock music), regular ''TRL'' (various genres), and ''TRL XXL'' (special live guest). It was replaced with ''MTV Home'' in summer 2009.\n* In Brazil, MTV aired a show similar to ''TRL'' known as ''[[Disk MTV]]''. This program was created before ''TRL'', existing since the launch of [[MTV Brasil]] in 1990, and has never changed its format as a top ten request show over the years. It aired weekdays from 6:00 to 7:00&nbsp;pm. On December 29, 2006, MTV Brasil aired the last ''Disk MTV'' episode. It had a week-long special about the best videos of its sixteen-year run; the last video shown in the program was [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]\". The show was cut due to the decision of network of not airing music videos on its 2007 schedule, claiming that videos are something that can be viewed online on their [[MTV Overdrive|Overdrive]] website.\n\n===Similar programs===\n* In Latin America, a version of ''TRL'' called ''[[Los 10+ Pedidos]]'' (''The 10 Most Requested'') airs daily. The show is hosted by \"Gabo\" and \"Macarena\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtvla.com/tv/los10/|title=TRL Latin America|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122014341/http://www.mtvla.com/tv/los10/|archivedate=November 22, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* [[MTV Tr3s]], a US channel targeted to bilingual [[Hispanic]] people, launched ''Mi TRL'' in September 2006. The show carried the same format and graphics as the English version of ''TRL''. ''Mi TRL'' was initially anchored by [[Carlos Santos (MTV Tr3\u0301s)|Carlos Santos]] and [[Susie Castillo]]. Since then, Castillo has been with another VJ, Denise Ramerez. [[MTV News]] segments on the show are delivered from Los Angeles by correspondent [[Liz Hernandez]].\n* Sister network [[BET]] featured its own hip-hop and rap-focused countdown, ''[[106 & Park]]'', and the two shows frequently competed with one another for guests, though by the end of the run of ''TRL'', both shows aired with some space between them, allowing guests to appear on both shows on the same day.\n* [[Noggin (brand)|Noggin]] featured a version of ''TRL'' called ''[[Jack's Big Music Show]]''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[TRL's Number Ones]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |title=Total Request Live: The Ultimate Fan Guide |publisher=Simon and Schuster |last=Jackman |first=Ian |year=2000 |isbn=9780743418508 |ref=harv |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/trlultimatefangu00jack_0 }}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0167735}}\n* {{tv.com show|trl}}\n\n{{MTV Networks}}\n{{Music based programs on MTV}}\n{{MTVNetwork Shows}}\n{{Teen Choice Award for Choice TV \u2013 Reality Series}}\n\n[[Category:1998 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2008 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:2017 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1990s American music television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American music television series]]\n[[Category:2010s American music television series]]\n[[Category:2020s American music television series]]\n[[Category:American music chart television programs]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:MTV original programming]]\n[[Category:Music chart shows]]\n[[Category:American television series revived after cancellation]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{tone|date=May 2017}}\n{{refimprove|date=January 2020}}\n{{fansite|date=January 2020}}\n}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=May 2015}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Total Request Live\n| image                    = Trl-top-ten-logo.jpg\n| show_name_2              = TRL\n| creator                  = \n| presenter                = <small>'''Original:'''</small><br />[[Carson Daly]]<br>[[Dave_Holmes_(actor)|Dave Holmes]]<br>[[Jesse Camp]]<br>[[Damien Fahey]]<br>[[Hilarie Burton]]<br>[[Vanessa Lachey|Vanessa Minnillo]]<br>[[Quddus (television personality)|Quddus]]<br>[[La La Anthony|La La Vasquez]]<br>[[Susie Castillo]]<br>[[Lyndsey Rodrigues]]<br><small>'''Revival:'''</small><br />[[DC Young Fly]]<br>Tamara Dhia<br>Amy Pham<br>Erik Zachary<br>Lawrence Jackson<br>Matt Rife<br><small>'''2018 retooling:'''</small><br>[[Sway Calloway|Sway]]<br>\n<small>'''2019 retooling:'''</small><br>Sway<br>Jamila Mustafa<br>Kevan Kenney\n| country                  = United States\n| language                 = English\n| num_seasons              = 20\n| num_episodes             = 2,254\n| runtime                  = 45\u201348 minutes (formerly)<br>20\u201323 minutes (final episodes)\n| network                  = [[MTV]]\n| first_aired              = <small>'''Original:'''</small><br />{{Start date|1998|9|14}} \u2013<br />{{End date|2008|11|16}}<br> <small>'''Revival:'''</small><br />{{Start date|2017|10|2}}\n| last_aired = present\n| website                  = http://trltop10.mtv.com/\n| image_alt                = \n| caption                  = \n| list_episodes            = \n| channel                  = \n| first_run                = \n| released                 = \n}}\n\n'''''Total Request Live''''' (known commonly as '''''TRL''''') is an American television program broadcast on [[MTV]] that premiered on September 14, 1998. The series features popular [[Music video|music videos]] played during its countdown, and was also used as a promotion tool by musicians, actors, and other [[celebrity|celebrities]] to promote their newest works to the show's target [[Teen culture|teen]] [[demographics|demographic]].\n\nDuring the original run of the program, ''TRL'' played the ten most [[Request (broadcasting)|requested]] music videos of the day, as voted by viewers via phone or online. The show generally aired Monday through Thursday for one hour, though the scheduling and length of the show fluctuated over the years. Although ''TRL'' was billed as a live show, many episodes were actually pre-recorded. Due to declining ratings, and the larger secular decline of music-based television in favor of online services, MTV would announce the cancellation of ''TRL'' on  September 15, 2008.<ref name=\"Report: MTV to Cancel TRL\">{{cite news|title=Report: MTV to Cancel TRL|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6596363.html|work=Broadcasting & Cable|date=September 15, 2008|accessdate=2008-09-15}}</ref> The special three-hour finale episode, ''Total Finale Live'', aired on November 16, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1597023/20081014/knowles_beyonce.jhtml|title=Beyonce To Perform On 'TRL' Finale|publisher=}}</ref> \n\nLess than a decade later, ''TRL'' would be revived on October 2, 2017.<ref name=\"MTV Mines the Past\">{{cite web|last1=Koblin|first1=John|title=MTV Mines the Past for Its Future: \u2018Total Request Live\u2019|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/30/business/media/mtv-total-request-live-revival.html|website=New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=July 30, 2017}}</ref> In 2019, the show aired Saturday mornings at 10am ET as ''TRL Top 10''.\n\n==History==\n===Origin===\n''Total Request Live'' originated from several pre-existing programs on [[MTV]]. ''[[Dial MTV]]'', the first video request show on the network, had aired from 1986 to 1996. In 1997, MTV launched two new shows that became the predecessors of ''TRL'': ''[[Total Request]]'', a revival of the ''Dial MTV'' concept hosted by [[Carson Daly]], and ''[[MTV Live (U.S. TV program)|MTV Live]]'', which was hosted by [[Toby Amies]] and featured live performances and interviews from musical artists.\n\n{{MTV}}\n''Total Request'' was more subdued than ''MTV Live'', as Daly introduced music videos from an empty, dimly lit set. As the show progressed and gained more momentum with viewers tuning in, it was soon added to the list of daytime programming during MTV's ''Summer Share'' in [[Seaside Heights, New Jersey]]. The countdown would prove to be one of the most watched and most interactive shows in recent MTV history, demonstrating that it had potential to become an even larger success by combining with the element of live television.\n\n===Original Run (1998-2008)===\n====Carson Daly era ====\nIn Fall 1998, MTV producers merged the real-time aspect of ''MTV Live'' with the fan-controlled countdown power of ''Total Request'' into ''Total Request Live''. The program made its debut from MTV Studios on September 14, 1998. The show then grew to become MTV's unofficial [[flagship]] program.\n\nThe original host of ''TRL'', [[Carson Daly]], brought popularity to the show. The widely known abbreviation of ''TRL'' was adopted as the official title of the show in February 1999, after Daly and [[Dave Holmes (actor)|Dave Holmes]] began using the abbreviation on-air regularly. In the years following, the program was rarely referred to by its complete title. The show's countdown started off successfully while receiving hundreds of votes for Original Favorite Stars such as [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]], [[Aaliyah]], [[Eminem]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Korn]], [['N Sync]], and [[Backstreet Boys]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idolator.com/7667301/mtvs-total-request-live-trl-the-real-story-memorable-moments|title=MTV's Total Request Live (TRL): The Real Story & Memorable Moments|date=August 8, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n''TRL'' spent its first year developing a cult-type following.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/cool/etc/trl.html|title=Inside Total Request Live - Merchants Of Cool - FRONTLINE - PBS|website=www.pbs.org}}</ref> In the fall of 1999, a live studio audience was added to the show. By spring 2000, the countdown reached its peak, becoming a very recognizable pop culture icon in its first two years of existence. A weekend edition of the show known as ''TRL Weekend'', with a countdown consisting an average of the week's Top 10, aired for a short time in 2000.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn 2001, the popularity of ''TRL'' was at such a level that it spawned a country music spin-off, ''[[CMT Most Wanted Live]]'', on sister network [[Country Music Television|CMT]], until 2004.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nSome evolutionary changes were made to ''TRL'' throughout the next couple of years. The show received a new set and on-screen graphics for the debut of the fall 2001 season. A year later, on October 23, 2002, ''TRL'' celebrated its 1,000th episode. The number-one video on that day was \"[[Dirrty]]\" by [[Christina Aguilera]]. Also throughout the year of 2002, original host Carson Daly would be seen gradually less and less.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The show had near-daily segments from [[MTV News]] correspondents reporting on the latest in national or entertainment and music news from inside the studio.\n\n====Post-Carson Daly era====\nIn 2003, the next generation of ''TRL'' was ushered in as Carson Daly officially stepped down as host.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/carson-daly-looks-67039/|title=Carson Daly Looks Back as TRL Counts Down its Final Days|date=November 14, 2008|publisher=}}</ref> He left the show to host his own talk show, [[NBC]]'s ''[[Last Call with Carson Daly]]'', which premiered a year earlier. Following Daly stepping down, a revolving door of VJs hosted ''TRL'', including [[Damien Fahey]], [[Hilarie Burton]], [[Vanessa Minnillo]], [[Quddus (MTV)|Quddus]], [[La La Vasquez]], and [[Susie Castillo]]. Some of these VJs made their debut on the show in earlier years, so they already had the opportunity to host the show on days in which Daly was not present.\n\nSome changes were made to ''TRL'''s voting process in 2005. The show previously allowed anyone to vote online multiple times, but as part of these changes, only registered members on MTV.com could vote online. Additionally, a limit of one vote per day was added. Then, on July 10, 2006, MTV announced that votes would no longer be taken by phone, ending the legacy of the \"DIAL MTV\" phone number, which had been in use for voting on MTV since the premiere of the countdown show ''[[Dial MTV]]'' in the mid-1980s.\n\n[[File:TRL studios in Times Square in 2006.jpg|thumb|upright=1|''TRL'''s studios in Times Square in 2006.]]\n\nIn September 2006, ''TRL'' reached its eighth anniversary and, at that point, it was the longest-running live program that MTV had ever produced. It is also the third-longest-running program of all time in the network's history, following behind ''[[The Real World]]'', which has aired for the past 21 years, and ''[[120 Minutes]]'', which aired for 17 years. Around this time, ''TRL'' began airing officially on just four days a week (Monday through Thursday), as opposed to all five weekdays.\n\nOn November 2, 2006, ''TRL'' debuted what was billed as the first-ever [[hip hop]] [[public service announcement]] on [[global warming]]. The three-minute piece, titled \"Trees\", warned about deforestation and the dangers of global warming. The video corresponded with MTV's social campaign, ''Break the Addiction'', as part of ''think MTV''.\n\nThe hosts of ''TRL'' in 2008 were [[Damien Fahey]] and [[Lyndsey Rodrigues]]. Additionally, [[Stephen Colletti]], former cast member on ''[[Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County|Laguna Beach]]'', has appeared on ''TRL'' as host numerous times. The rest of the VJs are or have been working on separate projects. [[La La Vasquez]] went on to go work on her debut rap album {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. [[Hilarie Burton]] left ''TRL'' in 2004, after joining the cast of [[The WB]]/[[The CW|CW]]'s ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'', playing [[Peyton Sawyer]]. Quddus hosted from 2001 to 2006. He left to move to California to be a host of ''[[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]] Access''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/in/quddusphilippe|title=Quddus CV|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn May 22, 2007, ''TRL'' celebrated its 2000th episode, showing highlights from the past 2000 episodes, and a special countdown of ten of the most successful videos to ever appear on the show. [[Justin Timberlake]]'s \"[[Cry Me a River (Justin Timberlake song)|Cry Me a River]]\" topped the special countdown.\n\n====The end of ''TRL''====\nIn 2007, rumors began circulating stating that the ratings-challenged music video countdown show was to be canceled. In early 2007, an average of 373,000 viewers regularly watched the program.<ref name=\"forbes\">{{cite web|last=Hau|first=Louis|title=R.I.P.

In February 2007, MTV said the rumor was unfounded and claimed ''TRL'' will continue to air for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe producers of ''TRL'' experimented with web-based viewer interaction throughout the 2006\u20132007 season, showing [[viral videos]], allowing viewers to send feedback on a video via [[internet forum]]s and [[webcams]], along with a heavy emphasis on MTV's since discontinued Overdrive video portal. However, MTV still secretly planned to cancel the show and replace one with even more emphasis on viewer interaction, named ''YouRL'' (a [[homophone]] of [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]].)<ref>{{cite news|last=Becker|first=Anne|title=MTV Favors 'YouRL' Swap for 'TRL'|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/news-articles/mtv-favors-%E2%80%98yourl%E2%80%99-swap-%E2%80%98trl%E2%80%99/82534|work=Broadcasting & Cable|date=April 30, 2007|accessdate=2015-01-27}}</ref>\n\nConsequently, in July 2007, it was reported that ''YouRL'' was not received well by test audiences and that the concept of YouRL has been abandoned for the time being.

The Rejects spent the entire episode assisting in the tear down of the set which was a theme for the episode.  At the end of the episode, Lindsey and Damien cooperatively added the last step in the demolition process by shutting down all the lights.

The show airs Monday and Tuesday at 11 PM. MTV announced plans to expand the show to three nights in the summer and four nights by the end of the year, but this never materialized.<ref name=Andreeva2018>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2018/04/trl-a-m-premiere-date-afternoon-show-return-delayed-april-1202359407/|title=\u2018TRL\u2019 Morning Edition\u2019s Launch Moved Up To April & Aligned With Afternoon Block Whose Return Is Delayed By 2 Weeks|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|work=Deadline|accessdate=April 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn April 23, 2018, MTV launched a pre-recorded, hour-long daily morning edition of ''TRL'' titled ''Total Request AM''. The show aired at 8am and was hosted by [[Sway Calloway|Sway]]. [[Vinny Guadagnino|Vinny]] from ''Jersey Shore'' was brought on as host for the week and the first guests were boy band [[PrettyMuch]]. The program featured the return of a top ten countdown focusing on a specific playlist (Monday Motivation being the first countdown).<ref name=Andreeva2018/>\n\n2019 saw another retooling and name change as ''TRL Top 10'', which featured hosts Sway, Kevan Kenney and Jamila Mustafa. An off-shoot of the program, ''Fresh Out Fridays'', aired for several weeks on [[MTV2]] and covered everything new in music, pop culture, and fashion. TRL's ''Fresh Out Fridays'' aired a \"Playlist Of The Decade\" special on December 18, 2019 on [[MTV]], which covered the top 10 videos and pop culture moments of the 2010s. TRL has yet to return in 2020, but Fresh Out Fridays returned on February 7, 2020 on [[MTV]] as Fresh Out Live. Unlike its half-hour [[MTV2]] predecessor, Fresh Out Live has a runtime of around eight minutes. Starting Saturday, February 8, 2020, [[MTV]] airs a weekly one-hour block of music videos at 8AM ET under the name Fresh Out Playlist. This is the only block of long-form music videos [[MTV]] plays on its flagship channel.\n[[File:Trl-am-logo.jpg|thumb|upright=1|''Total Request AM'' logo]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Impact==\n{{fansite|section|date=December 2018}}\n''TRL'' is widely viewed as the show that launched the careers of many artists from the late 1990s and early 2000s. The show was featured as a main plot point in the movie ''[[Drake & Josh Go Hollywood]]'', produced by sister network [[Nickelodeon]].\n\n===Boy bands===\nEven though clean-cut [[boy band]]s like [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[NSYNC]] reached success before ''TRL'' began in the fall of 1998, both groups only reached their commercial peaks after their videos were seen on ''TRL''. In 1999, the Backstreet Boys' second LP, ''[[Millennium (Backstreet Boys album)|Millennium]]'', achieved the highest first week sales ever from an LP at the time.\n\nNSYNC also appeared on ''TRL'' in 2000, when their second LP, ''[[No Strings Attached ('N Sync album)|No Strings Attached]]'', topped the Backstreet Boys' first week sales. Once again, the large number of fans in attendance closed down the streets of Times Square. Throughout most of 1998, 1999, and 2000, videos by the Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC would claim the top position on the countdown.\n\n===Pop princesses===\nPop singers like [[Britney Spears]], [[Christina Aguilera]], and [[Jessica Simpson]] all made their music debuts on ''TRL'' as well. Britney and Christina became regulars on the show and would often appear as a guest. Simpson would not enjoy the same type of success until two years later, when she released the \"[[Irresistible (Jessica Simpson song)|Irresistible]]\" video, which reached number two on the countdown. [[Mandy Moore]] saw success on the show with her debut single's \"[[Candy (Mandy Moore song)|Candy]]\" in 1999 and \"[[I Wanna Be with You (Mandy Moore song)|I Wanna Be with You]]\", but did not score her first number-one video until her 2002 single \"[[Crush (Mandy Moore song)|Crush]]\" which she also performed on the show.\n\n[[Jessica Simpson]]'s younger sister [[Ashlee Simpson]] is another pop princess that has had some success on ''TRL'' with her first music video \"[[Pieces of Me (song)|Pieces of Me]]\" in 2004. Ashlee Simpson had three videos in the number one and one close to retirement. She would go on to score a number of number one videos on the show.\n\nThe artist with the most retirees videos is pop princess [[Britney Spears]] with 13 videos retired, an honorary retired video (\"[[I'm a Slave 4 U]]\") and three videos retired number one.\n\nA pop princess streak occurred in March 2007: The number one and number two spots were women for every show. There was no other month in the history of ''TRL'' where every show had a woman at the top spot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popfusion.net/forums/showthread.php?t=43280|title=ATRL \u2013 TRL Recap (March & April 2007)<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atrl.net/trlarchive/ |title=The TRL Archive \u2013 Recap, records, and statistics for MTV's Total Request Live |publisher=ATRL |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>\n\n===Rock bands===\nAlthough best known for featuring pop acts, ''TRL'' regularly featured videos and performances from rock bands in genres such as [[nu metal]], [[pop punk]] and [[emo pop]]. The metal bands [[Korn]] and [[Limp Bizkit]] were particularly popular on the program in the late 1990s, and often shared airtime with [[Britney Spears]] and the [[Backstreet Boys]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Pop Vs.

The [[Jonas Brothers]] have had their songs \"[[Hold On (Jonas Brothers song)|Hold On]]\", and \"[[SOS (Jonas Brothers song)|SOS]]\" premiere; \"SOS\" made it on the countdown peaking at number six. \"[[When You Look Me in the Eyes]]\" was on the charts for several weeks before peaking at number one, after fans crushed and flooded the ''TRL'' site by requesting hundreds of times on March 19, 2008. \"[[Burnin' Up (Jonas Brothers song)|Burnin' Up]]\" has also made it to the number-one spot on ''TRL''. [[Ashley Tisdale]] premiered \"[[He Said She Said (song)|He Said She Said]]\" on ''TRL'' and it reached the number-one spot for sixteen days and these was retrieved at forty days in the countdown, becoming the most successful song for a Disney recording artist in the show. [[Aly & AJ]]'s videos for \"[[Rush (Aly & AJ song)|Rush]]\", \"[[Chemicals React]]\" and \"[[Potential Breakup Song]]\" have all been on the countdown with \"Rush\" peaking at number two and \"Chemicals React\" peaking at number four, and \"Potential Breakup Song\" peaking at number five. [[Miley Cyrus]]'s \"[[7 Things]]\" premiered on ''TRL'' and reached number four on the show.\n\n==Video game==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = 53.89%<ref name=GR>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/533011-mtv-total-request-live-trivia/index.html |title=MTV Total Request Live Trivia for PC |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=2014-11-26}}</ref>\n| MC = 48/100<ref name=MC>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/mtv-total-request-live-trivia |title=MTV Total Request Live Trivia for PC Reviews |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=2014-11-26}}</ref>\n| Allgame = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=35742&tab=review |title=MTV TRL Trivia \u2013 Review |last=Miller |first=Eden |publisher=[[AllGame]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116051011/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=35742&tab=review |archivedate=November 16, 2014 |accessdate=2014-11-26}}</ref>\n| GSpot = 4.1/10<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mtv-total-request-live-trivia-review/1900-2805968/ |title=MTV Total Request Live Trivia Review |last=Goble |first=Gord |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=August 20, 2001 |accessdate=2014-11-26}}</ref>\n| GameZone = 6.5/10<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r18828.htm |title=MTV Total Request Live Trivia Review \u2013 PC |author=The Badger |publisher=GameZone |date=August 15, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718060618/http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r18828.htm |archivedate=July 18, 2007 |url-status=dead |accessdate=2014-11-25}}</ref>\n| IGN = 5/10<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/08/13/trl-trivia |title=TRL Trivia |last=Morrissey |first=Mike |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=August 13, 2001 |accessdate=2014-11-26}}</ref>\n| PCGUS = 50%<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://pcgamer.com/reviews/review_2002-01-02a.html |title=MTV Total Request Live <nowiki>[Trivia]</nowiki> |last=Barnstone |first=Trina |magazine=[[PC Gamer]] |date=November 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020216201201/http://pcgamer.com/reviews/review_2002-01-02a.html |archivedate=February 16, 2002 |url-status=dead |accessdate=2014-11-26}}</ref>\n}}\n\nA PC video game called '''''MTV Total Request Live Trivia''''' was developed by [[Hypnotix]] and published by [[Take-Two Interactive]], with a release on August 14, 2001.

Started on [[MTV Italy]] on November 2, 1999, it was hosted by [[Marco Maccarini]] and [[Giorgia Surina]], followed by Federico Russo and Carolina Di Domenico. Since the 2005\u201306 season, Surina returned to ''TRL'' with a new co-host, [[Alessandro Cattelan]]. After the 2005\u201306 season, the show was hosted only by Alessandro Cattelan. For the season 2007\u201308 the show was hosted for the first moment by [[Alessandro Cattelan]] and Elena Santarelli, and for the summer the male host was replaced by Carlo Pastore. Later Carlo Pastore was still the main host, but the female host changed to [[Elisabetta Canalis]]. Throughout its 8 seasons, ''TRL'' was broadcast from [[Milan]], Rome, [[Venice]], [[Naples]], [[Genoa]] and [[Turin]]. ''TRL Italy'' is the longest-running show on MTV Italy: on December 23, 2004, a special two-hour event, \"TRL #1000\", was aired to celebrate the program's 1000th episode. From 2006 to 2012, there was also a program called ''[[TRL Awards (Italy)|TRL Awards]]'' where the people choose the artist of the year via web or mobile, and in summer 2007 was aired a special weekly-appointement called ''TRL Extra Live'', who famous Italian singers did a mini-concert. The last version of the program was hosted by Brenda Lodigiani, Alessandro Arcodia, Wintana Rezene and Andrea Cadioli, under the name ''TRL on the Road'', and ended on September 24, 2010.\n[[File:Trltitlescreen.jpg|thumb|upright|''TRL'' logo used in Italy.]]\n* [[MTV Rom\u00e2nia]] launched the Romanian version of ''TRL'' from an [[Orange Rom\u00e2nia|Orange]] concept store on [[Calea Victoriei]] (a major commercial avenue in the center of [[Bucharest]]) on January 23, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.ro/trl|title=MTV.ro|website=MTV.ro|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415152935/http://www.mtv.ro/trl/|archivedate=April 15, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The show aired two times a week, on Tuesday and Wednesday. The graphic was similar to that of the Italian version. The show has closed during 2009.\n* The British version, known as ''[[TRL UK]]'', was hosted by [[Dave Berry (presenter)|Dave Berry]], [[Alex Zane]], [[Jo Good]], and Maxine Akhtar. It was broadcast live from [[Viacom International Media Networks (Europe)|MTV Networks Europe]] Studios in [[Camden, London]], then moving to [[Leicester Square]] in London from second series. Following the second series' broadcast from Leicester Square, the top 10 countdown was removed from the show. The second series finished at the end of 2005 and the show never returned to air.\n* The Australian version of ''TRL'' began as a weekend show, but then began aired live Monday through Friday. It was hosted by Maz Compton, Lyndsey Rodrigues, Nathan Sapsford, and Jason Robert Dundas. In early 2006, it returned to airing only on Friday evenings. The show was cancelled at the end of 2006 and was replaced by \"The Lair\". A revival of ''TRL'' returned in 2019. It is hosted by Ash London, Angus O'Loughlin, Flex Mami, and Lisa Hamilton.\n* After a Polish version of ''TRL'' was unsuccessful, [[MTV Poland]] decided to launch a new chart show based on ''TRL''{{'}}s structure titled ''RMF MAXXX Hits'', which aired from Monday to Saturday at 2 p.m.\n* [[MTV France]] has launched the French version ({{lang|fr|Ton Request Live}}) of the American show on January 24, 2007. The format was different from the original concept: there wasn't the countdown with the 10 favourite videos and in every episode there was a movie's mini-documentaries entitled \"{{lang|fr|TRL en Movies}}\". The show closed after only an episode on January 25, 2007 and it has cancelled from the schedule of [[MTV France]].\n* The German version of ''TRL'' was very successful throughout Europe (after Italy), and it was known as ''Total Request Live Germany''. ''TRL Germany'' had the highest television ratings of all the ''TRL'' versions in Europe. The show was hosted by Joko Winterscheidt and [[Mirjam Weichselbraun]] or Patrice Bou\u00e9dib\u00e9la from Tuesday to Friday from 4:30 to 5:30&nbsp;pm, and it was divided in four versions: ''Urban TRL'' (hip hop music), ''Rock TRL'' (rock music), regular ''TRL'' (various genres), and ''TRL XXL'' (special live guest). It was replaced with ''MTV Home'' in summer 2009.\n* In Brazil, MTV aired a show similar to ''TRL'' known as ''[[Disk MTV]]''. This program was created before ''TRL'', existing since the launch of [[MTV Brasil]] in 1990, and has never changed its format as a top ten request show over the years. It aired weekdays from 6:00 to 7:00&nbsp;pm. On December 29, 2006, MTV Brasil aired the last ''Disk MTV'' episode. It had a week-long special about the best videos of its sixteen-year run; the last video shown in the program was [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]\". The show was cut due to the decision of network of not airing music videos on its 2007 schedule, claiming that videos are something that can be viewed online on their [[MTV Overdrive|Overdrive]] website.\n\n===Similar programs===\n* In Latin America, a version of ''TRL'' called ''[[Los 10+ Pedidos]]'' (''The 10 Most Requested'') airs daily. The show is hosted by \"Gabo\" and \"Macarena\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtvla.com/tv/los10/|title=TRL Latin America|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122014341/http://www.mtvla.com/tv/los10/|archivedate=November 22, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* [[MTV Tr3s]], a US channel targeted to bilingual [[Hispanic]] people, launched ''Mi TRL'' in September 2006.
