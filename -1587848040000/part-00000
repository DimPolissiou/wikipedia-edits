Median sediment concentration in the river water is 1.66 grammes per litre, but may go up to 40 g/L. The highest sediment concentrations occur at the beginning of the rainy season, when loose soil and dust is washed away by overland flow and ends up in the river.<ref name=\"matt\">{{cite journal |last1=Vanmaercke |first1=M. and colleagues |title=Sediment dynamics and the role of flash floods in sediment export from medium-sized catchments: a case study from the semi-arid tropical highlands in northern Ethiopia |journal=Journal of Soils and Sediments |date=2010 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=611\u2013627 |doi=10.1007/s11368-010-0203-9 |url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/854315 }}</ref> \nAs such water contains many nutrients (locally it is called \u201caygi\u201d), farmers estimate that it strengthens their cattle, which they will bring to the river.<ref name=\"chapriver\"/> All in all, average [[sediment yield]] is 497 tonnes per km\u00b2 and per year. All measurements were done at a purposively installed station near the mouth of the river, in the year 2006.<ref name=\"matt\"/>\n\n===Flash floods===\nRunoff mostly occurs in the form of high runoff discharge events that occur in a very short period (called [[flash floods]]). These are related to the steep topography, often little vegetation cover and intense convective rainfall. The peaks of such flash floods have often a 50 to 100 times larger discharge than the preceding [[baseflow]]. These flash floods mostly occur during the evening or night, because the convective rain showers occur in the afternoon.<ref name=\"chapriver\"/>\n\n===Changes over time===\nEvidence given by [[Aerial reconnaissance in World War II#Italian reconnaissance over Ethiopia|Italian aerial photographs of the catchment, taken in the 1930s]] show that 40% of the catchment was covered with woody vegetation (against 34% in 2014). This vegetation could slow down runoff and the runoff coefficient was smaller (11% in 1935 against 12% in 2014). As a consequence, discharges in the river were less than today.<ref>[https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8543686 Etefa Guyassa, 2017. PhD thesis.

Median sediment concentration in the river water is 1.66 grammes per litre, but may go up to 40 g/L.

All measurements were done at a purposively installed station near the mouth of the river, in the year 2006.<ref name=\"matt\"/>\n\n===Flash floods===\nRunoff mostly occurs in the form of high runoff discharge events that occur in a very short period (called [[flash floods]]). These are related to the steep topography, often little vegetation cover and intense convective rainfall. The peaks of such flash floods have often a 50 to 100 times larger discharge than the preceding [[baseflow]]. These flash floods mostly occur during the evening or night, because the convective rain showers occur in the afternoon.<ref name=\"chapriver\"/>\n\n===Changes over time===\nEvidence given by [[Aerial reconnaissance in World War II#Italian reconnaissance over Ethiopia|Italian aerial photographs of the catchment, taken in the 1930s]] show that 40% of the catchment was covered with woody vegetation (against 34% in 2014). This vegetation could slow down runoff and the runoff coefficent was smaller (11% in 1935 against 12% in 2014). As a consequence, discharges in the river were less than today.<ref>[https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8543686 Etefa Guyassa, 2017. PhD thesis.

It has historically been a rural area, but growth in the Barrie area and the [[Greater Toronto Area]] has meant greater residential development in Innisfil.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Innisfil'' comes from the [[Irish language|Irish]] ''[[Lia F\u00e1il|Inis F\u00e1il]]'', an ancient mythological name for [[Ireland]].\n\n==History==\nThe history of Innisfil spans a period in excess of 170 years. The Town was hewn from almost unbroken virgin forests which had been home to the [[Wyandot people|Huron Indians]], and was first [[surveying|surveyed]] in 1820. The area encompassed 68,653 acres (278&nbsp;km\u00b2), including the villages of Allandale, Tollendal, Painswick, Minets Point, and Holly at the time.\n\nThe first settlers were the Hewson and Soules families who came by way of the [[East Holland River]] and Lake Simcoe to settle at Point Endeavour that they then renamed Hewson's Point (later named Big Bay Point). The Hewsons settled on March 30, 1820, and the Soules in 1822. The Warnica family settled the following year, in 1823, in the area now known as Painswick. The first [[sawmill]] in the Township was built at Tollendal by George McMullen in 1829. At this time James Soules owned a sawmill on the south half of lot 26 concession fourteen (Big Bay Point), Innisfil where he made the lumber for the construction of the first frame house in Innisfil for Lewis J. Clement.\n\nJohn and George Warnica completed the clearing of the bush between Barrie and Churchill. John Cayton had won the contract to open the road between Churchill and the 11th line of West Gwillimbury but only made it one mile north to the 12th, known as Cayton's Corners. Owing to his slight acquaintance with the forest, he sub-let the work to John and George Warnica who completed Cayton's contract between the 4th line of Innisfil (Churchill) and the 12th line of West Gwillimbury, north of [[Bradford, Ontario|Bradford]]. This opened the land route, known as [[Penetanguishene Road]], which later became [[Highway 11 (Ontario)|Highway 11]] and is now [[Yonge Street]]. This route between York (now Toronto) and Barrie was completed in the fall of 1825.\n\nAlong this road the settlers came, and spread out along the concession lines to clear the lands and develop their farms.  There had been those who came ahead by way of the river and the lake; many settled near the shores of Lake Simcoe and Kempenfelt Bay. The only channels of communication were the public roads, and these were scant and poor.\n\nThe pioneer farms cut from the forest were mostly self-sustaining. What few products there were for sale found a market in nearby Barrie, which was then little more than a village. Distant York was reached in the winter when the ice and snow made for better roads.\n\nDuring this period, [[post offices]], [[church (building)|churches]], and stores were established, also a form of local government performed by commissioners was appointed under a provincial act. The first post office, then called Innisfil, was located at what is now called Barclay's Corners. The first school was built in 1838 and located at Myers Corners, later called Victoria (now the community of [[Stroud, Ontario|Stroud]]). The first church was also at Victoria, and was of [[Methodist]] denomination.\n\nMilling in Innisfil was first done at Tollendal in 1835. The need for a grist mill to grind wheat is an indication of the progress toward an agricultural community.\n\nThe earliest official record of a [[census]] shows that by 1842 the population of Innisfil was 762.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lemon|first1=Robert|title=A History of the Town of Innisfil|url=http://www.innisfil.ca/Visiting/history.php?T=1&ID=5&CID=49|publisher=Town of Innisfil|accessdate=14 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813090821/http://www.innisfil.ca/Visiting/history.php?T=1&ID=5&CID=49|archivedate=August 13, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Establishment===\nThe year 1850 marked the end of the old commissioners rule. The population had increased to 1,807 nearly tripling in under a decade. The first municipal council was established, replacing the government of appointed commissioners. The Corporation of the Township of Innisfil was born.\n\nThe settlement of Allandale became more prominent with the construction of the Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Railway (later the Northern Railway) from [[Toronto]] to [[Collingwood, Ontario|Collingwood]]. The first train from Toronto arrived in Allandale on October 11, 1853.\n\nThe continued building of public roads, together with the railway and the lake navigation, resulted in the establishment of more flourishing hamlet settlements.\n\n[[Bell Ewart, Ontario|Belle Ewart]] was formed in 1854. Henry's Corners, now [[Thornton, Ontario|Thornton]], was formed in 1833. Perry's Corners, now [[Cookstown, Ontario|Cookstown]], was formed around 1859. Hamlet settlement also resulted in a burgeoning resort development along the entire shoreline.\n\nIn 1891, 500 acres (2&nbsp;km\u00b2) of Innisfil became incorporated as the Village of Allandale, now part of the City of Barrie. Barrie annexed a further 500 acres (2&nbsp;km\u00b2) in 1897.\n\nInnisfil flourished over the years and by 1950, had a population of 3,500. However, paved roads, the automobile (the first recorded in the town was 1912), the price of fuel, and the cost of housing outside Toronto, encouraged commuter residents. This, in turn, gradually changed the nature of Innisfil's shoreline development. Seasonal housing evolved to permanent residential. Now,{{When|date=April 2017}} about 90% of the shoreline is permanent residences.{{Citation needed|reason=Statistic needs reference|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Modern development===\nCookstown, at the southwest extremity of the town, became an incorporated village in 1962, with 100 acres (400,000 m\u00b2) of Innisfil becoming part of Cookstown.\n\nIn 1967, 597 acres (2.4&nbsp;km\u00b2) were annexed from Innisfil by the City of Barrie to accommodate the establishment of the Formosa Spring Brewery.  This facility was purchased by [[Molson's]] and has since been closed and sub-let to other businesses.\n\nOn January 1, 1982, 8,623 acres (35&nbsp;km\u00b2) were annexed to the City of Barrie, with a further 737 acres (3&nbsp;km\u00b2) to be annexed January 1, 1987. As a result of the annexations, Innisfil's population was reduced by approximately 26.7% to 12,153 permanent residents, and its total assessment was reduced by 20.4%.\n\nOn January 1, 1991, by virtue of the South Simcoe Act, the Township of Innisfil, a northern section of the Township of West Gwillimbury, and the Village of Cookstown, were amalgamated and incorporated as the Town of Innisfil.\n\nIn 1993, the [[Ontario Stockyards]] livestock facility, located for a long time in [[The Junction]] / [[West Toronto]] area in Toronto, relocated to just east of the Cookstown town site, on Highway 89.\n\nThe County of Simcoe Act provided for further restructuring of Simcoe County on January 1, 1994, when the Village of Thornton was amalgamated with the Township of Essa and a small section of the [[Essa, Ontario|Township of Essa]], adjacent to Cookstown, was amalgamated with Innisfil.\n\nAs of 2006, Innisfil had a total permanent population of 31,175 and an estimated seasonal population of 4,000 people.

It has historically been a rural area, but growth in the Barrie area and the [[Greater Toronto Area]] has meant greater residential development in Innisfil.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Innisfil'' comes from the [[Irish language|Irish]] ''[[Lia F\u00e1il|Inis F\u00e1il]]'', an ancient mythological name for [[Ireland]].\n\n==History==\nThe history of Innisfil spans a period in excess of 170 years. The Town was hewn from almost unbroken virgin forests which had been home to the [[Wyandot people|Huron Indians]], and was first [[surveying|surveyed]] in 1820. The area encompassed 68,653 acres (278&nbsp;km\u00b2), including the villages of Allandale, Tollendal, Painswick, Minets Point, and Holly at the time.\n\nThe first settlers were the Hewson and Soules families who came by way of the [[East Holland River]] and Lake Simcoe to settle at Point Endeavour that they then renamed Hewson's Point (later named Big Bay Point). The Hewsons settled on March 30, 1820, and the Soules in 1822. The Warnica family settled the following year, in 1823, in the area now known as Painswick. The first [[sawmill]] in the Township was built at Tollendal by George McMullen in 1829. At this time James Soules owned a sawmill on the south half of lot 26 concession fourteen (Big Bay Point), Innisfil where he made the lumber for the construction of the first frame house in Innisfil for Lewis J. Clement.\n\nJohn and George Warnica completed the clearing of the bush between Barrie and Churchill. John Cayton had won the contract to open the road between Churchill and the 11th line of West Gwillimbury but only made it one mile north to the 12th, known as Cayton's Corners. Owing to his slight acquaintance with the forest, he sub-let the work to John and George Warnica who completed Cayton's contract between the 4th line of Innisfil (Churchill) and the 12th line of West Gwillimbury, north of [[Bradford, Ontario|Bradford]]. This opened the land route, known as [[Penetanguishene Road]], which later became [[Highway 11 (Ontario)|Highway 11]] and is now [[Yonge Street]]. This route between York (now Toronto) and Barrie was completed in the fall of 1825.\n\nAlong this road the settlers came, and spread out along the concession lines to clear the lands and develop their farms.  There had been those who came ahead by way of the river and the lake; many settled near the shores of Lake Simcoe and Kempenfelt Bay. The only channels of communication were the public roads, and these were scant and poor.\n\nThe pioneer farms cut from the forest were mostly self-sustaining. What few products there were for sale found a market in nearby Barrie, which was then little more than a village. Distant York was reached in the winter when the ice and snow made for better roads.\n\nDuring this period, [[post offices]], [[church (building)|churches]], and stores were established, also a form of local government performed by commissioners was appointed under a provincial act. The first post office, then called Innisfil, was located at what is now called Barclay's Corners. The first school was built in 1838 and located at Myers Corners, later called Victoria (now the community of [[Stroud, Ontario|Stroud]]). The first church was also at Victoria, and was of [[Methodist]] denomination.\n\nMilling in Innisfil was first done at Tollendal in 1835. The need for a grist mill to grind wheat is an indication of the progress toward an agricultural community.\n\nThe earliest official record of a [[census]] shows that by 1842 the population of Innisfil was 762.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lemon|first1=Robert|title=A History of the Town of Innisfil|url=http://www.innisfil.ca/Visiting/history.php?T=1&ID=5&CID=49|publisher=Town of Innisfil|accessdate=14 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813090821/http://www.innisfil.ca/Visiting/history.php?T=1&ID=5&CID=49|archivedate=August 13, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Establishment===\nThe year 1850 marked the end of the old commissioners rule. The population had increased to 1,807 nearly tripling in under a decade. The first municipal council was established, replacing the government of appointed commissioners. The Corporation of the Township of Innisfil was born.\n\nThe settlement of Allandale became more prominent with the construction of the Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Railway (later the Northern Railway) from [[Toronto]] to [[Collingwood, Ontario|Collingwood]]. The first train from Toronto arrived in Allandale on October 11, 1853.\n\nThe continued building of public roads, together with the railway and the lake navigation, resulted in the establishment of more flourishing hamlet settlements.\n\n[[Bell Ewart, Ontario|Belle Ewart]] was formed in 1854. Henry's Corners, now [[Thornton, Ontario|Thornton]], was formed in 1833. Perry's Corners, now [[Cookstown, Ontario|Cookstown]], was formed around 1859. Hamlet settlement also resulted in a burgeoning resort development along the entire shoreline.\n\nIn 1891, 500 acres (2&nbsp;km\u00b2) of Innisfil became incorporated as the Village of Allandale, now part of the City of Barrie. Barrie annexed a further 500 acres (2&nbsp;km\u00b2) in 1897.\n\nInnisfil flourished over the years and by 1950, had a population of 3,500. However, paved roads, the automobile (the first recorded in the town was 1912), the price of fuel, and the cost of housing outside Toronto, encouraged commuter residents. This, in turn, gradually changed the nature of Innisfil's shoreline development. Seasonal housing evolved to permanent residential. Now,{{When|date=April 2017}} about 90% of the shoreline is permanent residences.{{Citation needed|reason=Statistic needs reference|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Modern development===\nCookstown, at the southwest extremity of the town, became an incorporated village in 1962, with 100 acres (400,000 m\u00b2) of Innisfil becoming part of Cookstown.\n\nIn 1967, 597 acres (2.4&nbsp;km\u00b2) were annexed from Innisfil by the City of Barrie to accommodate the establishment of the Formosa Spring Brewery.

Writer [[George Elliott Clarke]] has cited a [[McGill University]] study which found that fully 43 per cent of all Black Canadians were not counted as black in the 1991 Canadian census, because they had identified on census forms as British, French or other cultural identities which were not included in the census group of Black cultures.<ref>[http://news-archive.mcgill.ca/w97/black.htm \"The Complex Face of Black Canada\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304222923/http://news-archive.mcgill.ca/w97/black.htm |date=4 March 2016 }}, [[George Elliott Clarke]], ''[[McGill News]]'', Winter 1997.</ref>\n\nAlthough subsequent censuses have reported the population of Black Canadians to be much more consistent with the McGill study's revised 1991 estimate than with the official 1991 census data, no study has been conducted to determine whether some Black Canadians are still substantially missed by the self-identification method.\n\n==Terminology==\nOne of the ongoing controversies in the Black Canadian community revolves around appropriate terminologies. Many Canadians of [[Afro-Caribbean]] origin strongly object to the term ''African Canadian'', as it obscures their own culture and history, and this partially accounts for the term's less prevalent use in Canada, compared to the consensus ''African American'' south of the border.\n\n[[Black Nova Scotians]], a more distinct cultural group, of whom some can trace their Canadian ancestry back to the 1700s, use both terms, ''African Canadian'' and ''Black Canadian''. For example, there is an Office of African Nova Scotian Affairs and a [[Black Cultural Centre for Nova Scotia]].\n\n''Caribbean Canadian'' is often used to refer to Black Canadians of Caribbean heritage, although this usage can also be controversial because the Caribbean is not populated only by people of African origin, but also includes large groups of [[Indo-Caribbean]]s, [[Chinese Caribbean]]s, European Caribbeans, Syrian or Lebanese Caribbeans, Latinos and [[Amerindians]]. The term ''[[West Indian]]'' is often used by those of Caribbean ancestry, although the term is more of a cultural description than a racial one, and can equally be applied to groups of many different racial and ethnic backgrounds. The term ''Afro-Caribbean-Canadian'' is occasionally used in response to this controversy, although this term is not widely in common usage.\n\nMore specific national terms such as ''[[Jamaican Canadian]]'', ''[[Haitian Canadians|Haitian Canadian]]'', or ''[[Ghanaian Canadian]]'' are also used. There is no widely used alternative to ''Black Canadian'' that is accepted by the Afro-Caribbean population, those of more recent African extraction, and descendants of immigrants from the United States as an umbrella term for the whole group.<ref name=\"pruegger\" />\n\nOne increasingly common practice, seen in academic usage and in the names and mission statements of some Black Canadian cultural and social organizations but not yet in universal nationwide usage, is to always make reference to both the African and Caribbean communities.<ref>\"Black History Month Celebrations in Markham\". ''Markham Guiding Star'', 12 February 2008.</ref> For example, one key health organization dedicated to HIV/AIDS education and prevention in the Black Canadian community is now named the ''African and Caribbean Council on HIV/AIDS in Ontario'', the Toronto publication ''Pride'' bills itself as an \"African-Canadian and Caribbean-Canadian news magazine\", and [[CKFG-FM|G98.7]], a Black-oriented community radio station in Toronto, was initially branded as Caribbean African Radio Network.<ref name=carnset>[https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/article/932525--caribbean-radio-station-set-for-toronto-at-98-7-fm \"Caribbean radio station set for Toronto at 98.7 FM\"]. ''[[Toronto Star]]'', 2 February 2011.</ref>\n\nIn [[French language|French]], the terms ''Noirs canadiens'' or ''Afro-Canadiens'' are used. ''N\u00e8gre'' (\"[[Negro]]\" or \"[[Nigger]]\") is considered derogatory; Quebec film director [[Robert Morin]] faced controversy in 2002 when he chose the title ''[[The Negro (film)|Le N\u00e8g']]'' for a film about anti-Black racism,<ref>\"Montreal film, Le Neg, stirs up controversy about racism, bigots\".

At this time Halifax was undergoing a major construction boom initiated by [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn]]'s efforts to modernize the city's defences. The many building projects had created a labour shortage. Edward was impressed by the Maroons and immediately put them to work at the [[Citadel Hill (Fort George)|Citadel in Halifax]], Government House, and other defence works throughout the city.\n\nFunds had been provided by the Government of Jamaica to aid in the resettlement of the Maroons in Canada.<ref>John N.

Small farm lots were provided to the Maroons and they attempted to farm the infertile land. Like the former tenants, they found the land at Preston to be unproductive; as a result they had little success. The Maroons also found farming in Nova Scotia difficult because the climate would not allow cultivation of familiar food crops, such as [[bananas]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[pineapples]] or [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]].  Small numbers of Maroons relocated from Preston to Boydville for better farming land. The British Lieutenant Governor [[John Wentworth (governor)|Sir John Wentworth]] made an effort to change the Maroons' culture and beliefs by introducing them to [[Christianity]]. From the monies provided by the Jamaican Government, Wentworth procured an annual stipend of \u00a3240 for the support of a school and religious education.<ref name=\"Grant_1973\">John N.

That same year, the new Legislative Assembly became the first entity in the [[British Empire]] to restrict slavery, confirming existing ownership but allowing for anyone born to a female slave after that date to be freed at the age of 25.<ref>[http://guelph.ca/museum/BlackHistory/slavery.htm Black History in Guelph and Wellington County] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060206102816/http://guelph.ca/museum/BlackHistory/slavery.htm |date=6 February 2006 }}</ref> Slavery was all but abolished throughout the other [[British North America]]n colonies by 1800. The [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Slave Trade Act]] outlawed the slave trade in the British Empire in 1807 and the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|Slavery Abolition Act]] of 1833 outlawed slave-holding altogether in the colonies (except for India).  This made Canada an attractive destination for many refugees fleeing slavery in the United States, such as minister [[Boston King]].\n\n===War of 1812===\nThe next major migration of black people occurred between 1813 and 1815. Refugees from the [[War of 1812]], primarily from the [[Chesapeake Bay]] and Georgia [[Sea Islands]], fled the United States to settle in Hammonds Plains, Beechville, [[Lucasville, Nova Scotia|Lucasville]], [[North Preston, Nova Scotia|North Preston]], [[East Preston, Nova Scotia|East Preston]], [[Africville]] and [[Elm Hill, New Brunswick]]. An April 1814 proclamation of Black freedom and settlement by British Vice-Admiral [[Alexander Cochrane]] led to an exodus of around 3,500 Black Americans by 1818.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|url = https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/acadiensis/article/view/10708/11414|title = \"We Can Do As We Like Here\": An Analysis of Self Assertion and Agency Among Black Refugees in Halifax, Nova Scotia, 1813\u20131821|last = Whitfield|first = Harvey|date = 2002|journal = Acadiensis|volume = 32|issue = 1|access-date = |page = 36}}</ref> The settlement of the refugees was initially seen as a means of creating prosperous agricultural communities; however, poor economic conditions following the war coupled with the granting of infertile farmland to refugees caused economic hardship.<ref name=\":1\" /> Social integration proved difficult in the early years, as the prevalence of enslaved Africans in the Maritimes caused the newly freed Black Canadians to be viewed on the same level of the enslaved.<ref name=\":1\" /> Politically, the black Loyalist communities in both Nova Scotia and Upper Canada were characterized by what the historian James Walker called \"a tradition of intense loyalty to Britain\" for granting them freedom and Canadian blacks tended to be active in the militia, especially in Upper Canada during the War of 1812 as the possibility of an American victory would also mean the possibility of their re-enslavement.<ref name=\"Walker\"/> Militarily, a [[Black Loyalist]] named [[Richard Pierpoint]], who was born about 1744 in Senegal and who had settled near present-day [[St. Catharines]], Ontario, offered to organize a Corps of Men of Colour to support the British war effort.

From the late 1820s, through the time that [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|the United Kingdom itself forbade slavery in 1833]], until the [[American Civil War]] began in 1861, the Underground Railroad brought tens of thousands of [[fugitive slave]]s to Canada. In 1819, [[Sir John Robinson, 1st Baronet, of Toronto|Sir John Robinson]], the Attorney-General of Upper Canada, ruled: \"Since freedom of the person is the most important civil right protected by the law of England...the negroes are entitled to personal freedom through residence in Upper Canada and any attempt to infringe their rights will be resisted in the courts\".<ref>Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 93.</ref> After Robinson's ruling in 1819, judges in Upper Canada refused American requests to extradite run-away slaves who reached Upper Canada under the grounds \"every man is free who reaches British ground\".<ref>Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 27.</ref> One song popular with African Americans called the ''[[Song of the Free]]'' had the lyrics: \"I'm on my way to Canada, That cold and distant land, The dire effects of slavery, I can no longer stand, Farewell, old master, Don't come after me, I'm on my way to Canada, Where colored men are free!\".<ref>Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 25.</ref>\n\nIn 1850, the United States Congress passed the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]], which gave bounty hunters the right to recapture run-away slaves anywhere in the United States and ordered all federal, state and municipal law enforcement to co-operate with the bounty hunters in seizing run-away slaves.<ref name=\"Hill, Daniel page 32\">Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 32.</ref> Since the Fugitive Slave Act stripped accused fugitive slaves of any legal rights such as the right to testify in court that they were not run-away slaves, cases of freemen and freewomen being kidnapped off the streets to be sold into slavery become common.<ref name=\"Hill, Daniel page 32\"/> The U.S justice system in the 1850s was hostile to black people, and little inclined to champion their rights. In 1857, in the [[Dred Scott v. Sandford]] decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that black Americans were not and never could be U.S. citizens under any conditions, a ruling that appeared to suggest that laws prohibiting slavery in the northern states were unconstitutional. As a result of the Fugitive Slave Act and legal rulings to expand slavery in the United States, many free blacks living in the United States chose to seek sanctuary in Canada with one newspaper in 1850 mentioning that a group of blacks working for a Pittsburgh hotel had armed themselves with handguns before heading for Canada saying they were \"...{{nbsp}}determined to die rather be captured\".<ref name=\"Hill, Daniel page 32\"/> The ''Toronto Colonist'' newspaper on 17 June 1852 noted that almost every ship or boat coming into Toronto harbor from the American side of Lake Ontario seemed to be carrying a run-away slave.<ref name=\"Hill, Daniel page 32\"/> One of the more active \"conductors\" on the Underground Railroad was [[Harriet Tubman]], the \"Black Moses\" who made 11 trips to bring about 300 run-away slaves to Canada, most of whom settled in St. Catherines.<ref>Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 35.</ref> Tubman guided her \"passengers\" on nocturnal journeys (travelling via day was too risky) through the forests and swamps, using as her compass the north-star and on cloudy nights seeing what side the moss was growing on trees, to find the best way to Canada.<ref name=\"Hill, Daniel page 38\">Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 38.</ref> Such trips on the Underground Railroad involved much privation and suffering as Tubman and her \"passengers\" had to avoid both the bounty-hunters and law enforcement and could go for days without food as they travelled through the wilderness, always following the north-star.<ref name=\"Hill, Daniel page 38\"/> Tubman usually went to Rochester, New York, where Frederick Douglass would shelter the run-aways and crossed over to Canada at Niagara Falls.<ref>Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 38-39.</ref> Unlike the U.S. customs, which under the Fugitive Slave Act had to co-operate with the bounty hunters, the customs authorities on the Canadian side of the border were far more helpful and \"looked the other way\" when Tubman entered Canada with her \"passengers\".<ref>Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 39.</ref>\n\n[[File:Samuel Ward.jpg|thumb|200px|Rev.

On 26 February 1851, the Toronto chapter of the Anti-Slavery Society was founded with what was described by the ''Globe'' newspaper as \"the largest and most enthusiastic meeting we have ever seen in Toronto\" that issued the resolution: \"slavery is an outrage on the laws of humanity and its continued practice demands the best exertions for its extinction\".<ref name=\"Hill, Daniel page 20\">Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 20.</ref> The same meeting committed its members to help the many \"houseless and homeless victims of slavery flying to our soil\".<ref name=\"Hill, Daniel page 20\"/> The Congregationalist minister, the Reverend [[Samuel Ringgold Ward]] of New York, who had been born into slavery in Maryland, wrote about Canada West (modern Ontario) that: \"Toronto is somewhat peculiar in many ways, anti-slavery is more popular there than in any city I know save Syracuse...I had good audiences in the towns of Vaughan, Markham, Pickering and in the village of Newmarket. Anti-slavery feeling is spreading and increasing in all these places. The public mind literally thirsts for the truth, and honest listeners and anxious inquirers will travel many miles, crowd our country chapels, and remain for hours eagerly and patiently seeking the light\".<ref name=\"Hill, Daniel page 20\"/> Ward himself had been forced to flee to Canada West in 1851 for his role in the [[Jerry Rescue]], leading to his indictment for violating the Fugitive Slave Act. Despite the support to run-away slaves, blacks in Canada West, which become Ontario in 1867, were confided to segregated schools.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\nAmerican bounty-hunters who crossed into Canada to kidnap black people to sell into slavery were prosecuted for kidnapping if apprehended by the authorities.<ref>Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 42.</ref> In 1857, an attempt by two American bounty hunters, T.G. James and John Wells, to kidnap Joseph Alexander, a 20-year-old run-away slave from New Orleans living in Chatham, was foiled when a large crowd of black people surrounded the bounty hunters as they were leaving the Royal Exchange Hotel in Chatham with Alexander who had gone there to confront them.<ref name=\"Hill, Daniel page 43\">Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 43.</ref> Found on one of the bounty hunters was a letter from Alexander's former master describing him as a slave of \"saucy\" disposition who had smashed the master's carriage and freed a span of his horses before running away, adding that he was keen to get Alexander back so he could castrate him.<ref name=\"Hill, Daniel page 43\"/> Castration was the normal punishment for a male run-away slave. Alexander gave a speech to the assembled by-standers watching the confrontation denouncing life in the \"slave pens\" of New Orleans as extremely dehumanizing and stated he would rather die than return to living as a slave.<ref name=\"Hill, Daniel page 43\"/> Alexander described life in the \"slave pens\" as a regime of daily whippings, beatings and rapes designed to cow the slaves into a state of utter submission. The confrontation ended with Alexander being freed and the crowd marching Wells and James to the railroad station, warning them to never return to Chatham.<ref name=\"Hill, Daniel page 43\"/>     \n[[File: William Hall VC.jpg|thumb|left|200px|William Hall of Horton, Nova Scotia was the first black man to win the Victoria Cross]]\nThe refugee slaves who settled in Canada did so primarily in South Western Ontario, with significant concentrations being found in Amherstburg, Colchester, Chatham, Windsor, and Sandwich.

many of the Black Canadian villages and hamlets in Ontario and Nova Scotia, some which were founded in the 18th century as Loyalist settlements, became abandoned as their inhabitants moved to the

In 1942, newspapers gave national coverage when the five Carty brothers of Saint John, New Brunswick all enlisted in the RCAF on the same day with the general subtext being that Canada was more

gunner on a Halifax bomber, flying 35 missions to bomb Germany and was wounded in action.<ref name=\"Profiles in Courage\"/> The mobilization of the Canadian economy for \"total war\" gave increased economic opportunities for both Black men and even more so for Black women, many of whom for the first time in their lives found well-paying jobs in war industries.<ref name=\"veterans.gc.ca\"/>\n\nIn general racism became less fashionable during World War II with two incidents in 1940 illustrating a tendency towards increased tolerance as feelings of wartime national solidarity made displays of prejudice less acceptable.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 420\"/> A Vancouver bar that refused to serve a Black man was fined by a judge when the said man complained while in Toronto a skating rink that turned away blacks found itself the object of a boycott and demonstrations by students from the University of Toronto until the owners of the rink finally agreed to accept Black patrons.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 420\"/> The incidents in Toronto and Vancouver, as small as they were, would have been inconceivable ten or even five years before.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 420\"/> Winks wrote that if the Second World War was not the end of racism in Canada, but it was the beginning of the end as for the first time that many practices that been considered normal were subject to increasing vocal criticism as many Black Canadians started to become more assertive.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 420\"/>\n\nIn 1942, following complaints from Black university graduates that the National Selective Service board assigned them inferior work, a campaign waged by the ''Globe & Mail'' newspaper, the Canadian Jewish Congress, and the ''Winnipeg Free Press'' led to a promise from the National Selective Service board to stop using race when assigning potential employees to employers.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 423\">Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 423.</ref> During the war, unions became more open to accepting Black members and Winks wrote the \"most important change\" to black Canadian community caused by World War II was \"the new militancy in the organized black labor unions\".<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 423\"/> The most militant Black unions was the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, which during the war won major wage increases for Black porters working on the railroads.<ref>Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 pages 424\u2013425.</ref> In Winnipeg, a Joint Labor Committee to Combat Racial Intolerance was formed to end discrimination against Jews and Ukrainian-Canadians, but soon agreed to take cases concerning Black Canadians.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 423\"/> In 1944, Ontario passed the Racial Discrimination Act, which banned the use of any symbol or sign by any businesses with the aim of racial discrimination, which was the first law in Canada intended to address the practice of many businesses of refusing to take Black customers.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 427\">Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page

In 1946, her decision to sit in the whites-only section of a theatre in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, led to her conviction in a controversial case, for which she was pardoned for in 2010.]]\n\nIn 1946, a Black woman from Halifax, [[Viola Desmond]], watched a film in a segregated cinema in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, which led to her being dragged out of the theatre by the manager and a policeman.<ref name=\"Reynolds, Glenn page 61\">Reynolds, Glenn ''Viola Desmond's Canada'', Halifax: Fernwood Publishing, 2016 page 61.</ref> Desmond was convicted and fined for not paying the one cent difference in sales tax between buying a ticket in the white section, where she sat, and the Black section, where she was supposed to sit.<ref name=\"Reynolds, Glenn page 61\"/> The Desmond case attracted much publicity as various civil rights groups rallied in her defense. Desmond fought the fine in the appeals court, where she lost, but the incident led the Nova Scotia Association for the Advancement of Coloured People to pressure the Nova Scotia government to pass the Fair Employment Act of 1955 and Fair Accommodations Act of 1959 to end segregation in Nova Scotia.<ref>Reynolds, Glenn ''Viola Desmond's Canada'', Halifax: Fernwood Publishing, 2016 p. 62.</ref> Following more pressure from Black Canadian groups, in 1951 Ontario passed the Fair Employment Practices Act outlawing racial discrimination in employment and the Fair Accommodation Practices Act of 1955, which outlawed discrimination in housing and renting.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 427\"/> In 1958, Ontario established the Anti-Discrimination Commission, which was renamed the Human Rights Commission in 1961.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 427\"/> Led by the American-born Black sociologist [[Daniel G. Hill]], the Ontario Anti-Discrimination Commission investigated 2,000 cases of racial discrimination in its first two years, and was described as having a beneficial effect on the ability of Canadian Blacks to obtain employment.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 428\">Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 p. 428.</ref> In 1953, Manitoba passed the Fair Employment Act, which was modeled after the Ontario law, and New Brunswick, Saskatchewan and British Columbia passed similar laws in 1956, followed by Quebec in 1964.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 428\"/>\n\nThe town of [[Dresden, Ontario]] was especially notorious for segregation with the majority of its black residents living along two blocks on Main Street.<ref>Reynolds, Glenn ''Viola Desmond's Canada'', Halifax: Fernwood Publishing, 2016 page 55</ref> In 1949, the journalist Sidney Katz wrote in ''Maclean's'' the article \"Jim Crow Lives in Dresden\" that:\"...although Dresden citizens do not like to talk about it, Negroes cannot eat at the town's three restaurants serving regular meals, cannot get a haircut in the four regular barbershops, cannot send their wives to the only beauty parlor\".<ref name=\"Reynolds, Glenn page 55\">Reynolds, Glenn ''Viola Desmond's Canada'', Halifax: Fernwood Publishing, 2016 page 55.</ref> Katz found that the majority of businesses discriminated against black Dresdeners because of the influence of Morley McKay, the outspokenly racist owner of the very popular Kay's Grill restaurant, who vocally objected to any businesses that might open its doors to black customers.<ref name=\"Reynolds, Glenn page 55\"/> McKay got around the Racial Discrimination Act of 1944 by simply refusing to allow black customers to enter Kay's Grill, a practice that was followed by many Dresden businesses who feared that McKay would organize a boycott by white customers.<ref>Reynolds, Glenn ''Viola Desmond's Canada'', Halifax: Fernwood Publishing, 2016 page 56.</ref> However, there was no segregation in Dresden's schools, and Katz wrote it was common \"to see colored and while children walking the streets arm and arm\".<ref>Reynolds, Glenn ''Viola Desmond's Canada'', Halifax: Fernwood Publishing, 2016 page 55-56.</ref>\n\nTo end segregation in Dresden, [[Hugh Burnett]], a black World War II veteran who owned a carpentry business in Dresden, founded the National Unity Association (NUA) in 1948.<ref name=\"Reynolds, Glenn page 58\">Reynolds, Glenn ''Viola Desmond's Canada'', Halifax: Fernwood Publishing, 2016 page 58.</ref> Most of leaders of the NUA were World War II veterans, who were incensed at the widespread discrimination in Dresden.<ref name=\"Reynolds, Glenn page 58\"/> After the all white council of Dresden dismissed Burnett's demand that a non-discrimination clause be added to all business licences, Burnett formed an alliance with [[Kalmen Kaplansky]], the president of the [[Jewish Labour Committee]].<ref name=\"Reynolds, Glenn page 58\"/> Burnett and Kaplansky waged an effective media campaign highlighting the injustice of veterans being treated like second class citizens, and in 1949 met with the Premier, [[Leslie Frost]], to press their case.<ref name=\"Reynolds, Glenn page 58\"/> Frost proved to be sympathetic and in response to the lobbying of Burnett and Kaplansky, toughened the Racial Discrimination Act in 1951, passed the Fair Employment Practices Act the same year, followed by the Fair Accommodations Act of 1954.<ref name=\"Reynolds, Glenn page 59\">Reynolds, Glenn ''Viola Desmond's Canada'', Halifax: Fernwood Publishing, 2016 page 59.</ref> When McKay continued to turn away black customers from Kay's Grill, he was convicted of racial discrimination.<ref name=\"Reynolds, Glenn page 59\"/> On 16 November 1956, two black members of the NUA finally entered Kay's Grill and were served without incident.<ref name=\"Reynolds, Glenn page 59\"/>\n\n===1960s and 1970s===\n\nOn 21 March 1960, in the [[Sharpeville massacre]], the South African police gunned down 67 Black South Africans protesting ''apartheid'', which in a sign of changing racial attitudes caused much controversy in Canada.<ref>Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 446.</ref> There was considerable public pressure on the Prime Minister [[John Diefenbaker]] to ask for South Africa to be expelled from the Commonwealth following the Sharpeville massacre with many noting that the South African prime minister [[Hendrik Verwoerd]] was an admirer of Nazi Germany.<ref>Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 pages 446\u2013447.</ref> At the conference of the Commonwealth prime ministers in London in 1960, Diefenbaker tried to avoid discussing the subject of expelling South Africa, but at the next conference in London in 1961, he played a leading role in passing a resolution declaring racial discrimination incompatible with Commonwealth membership, which led to Verwoerd storming out of the conference and quitting the Commonwealth.<ref>Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 pages 447\u2013448.</ref> The subject of condemning South Africa for ''apartheid'' benefited the Black Canadians since it suggested that racism was no longer acceptable anywhere in the Commonwealth at a time when Commonwealth membership mattered greatly to Canadians.<ref>Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 449.</ref>\n\nCanada maintained its restrictions of immigration until 1962, when racial rules were eliminated from the immigration laws. This coincided with the dissolution of the [[British Empire]] in the Caribbean. By the mid-1960s, approximately 15,000 Caribbean immigrants had settled in Toronto.<ref>[http://journals.hil.unb.ca/index.php/acadiensis/article/view/15385/16525#re1no2 \"Confederation\u2019s Casualties: The \"Maritimer\" as a Problem in 1960s Toronto\"], ''Acadiensis''.

Between 1950 and 1995, about 300,000 people from the West Indies settled in Canada.<ref name=\"Walker\"/> Outside of the Maritime provinces, where the majority of the black population are the descendants of black Loyalists and American runaway slaves, the majority of black Canadians are descended from immigrants from the West Indies.<ref name=\"Walker\"/> Since then, an increasing number of new immigrants from Africa have been coming to Canada;<ref name=canada/> they have also immigrated to the United States and Europe. This includes large numbers of refugees, but also many skilled and professional workers pursuing better economic conditions. About 150,000 people from Africa immigrated to Canada between 1950 and 1995.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\nHowever, a sizeable number of Black Canadians who descend from freed American slaves can still be found in Nova Scotia and parts of [[Southwestern Ontario]]. Some descendants of the freed American slaves, many of whom were of mixed race descent, have mixed into the white Canadian community and have mostly lost their ethnic identity. Some descendants returned to the United States.

As the Hall building burned and the policemen beat the students, onlookers in the crowds outside chanted \"Burn, niggers, burn!\" and \"Let the niggers burn!\".<ref name=\"Lambeth\"/> Afterwards, the protesting students were divided by race by the police with charges laid against the 97 black students present in the Hall building. The two leaders of the protest, [[Rosie Douglas|Roosevelt \"Rosie\" Douglas]] and [[Anne Cools]], were convicted and imprisoned with Douglas being deported back to Dominica after completing his sentence, where he later became Prime Minister.<ref name=\"Lambeth\"/> Cools received a royal pardon and was appointed to the Senate in 1984 by Pierre Trudeau, becoming the first black senator. The riot at Sir George Williams University spurred-through it did not start-a wave of \"black power\" activism in Canada with many blacks taking the view that the police response was disproportionate and unjustifiably violent while many white Canadians who had believed that their country had no racism were shocked by a race riot in Canada.<ref name=\"Lambeth\"/>\n\nIn July 1967, the [[Caribana]] festival was started in Toronto by immigrants from the West Indies to celebrate West Indian culture that has become one of the largest celebrations of Caribbean culture in North America.

Its population was relocated and it was demolished in the 1960s to facilitate the urban expansion of the city. Similarly, the [[Hogan's Alley, Vancouver|Hogan's Alley]] neighbourhood in [[Vancouver]] was largely demolished in 1970, with only a single small laneway in [[Strathcona, Vancouver|Strathcona]] remaining.\n\nThe [[Wilberforce Colony]] in Ontario was also a historically Black settlement. It evolved demographically as Black settlers moved away, and became dominated by ethnic Irish settlers who renamed the village [[Lucan, Ontario|Lucan]]. A small group of Black American settlers from San Francisco were the original inhabitants of [[Saltspring Island]] in the mid-19th century.\n\nOther notable Black settlements include [[North Preston, Nova Scotia|North Preston]], Sunnyville, [[Lincolnville, Nova Scotia|Lincolnville]], [[Tracadie, Nova Scotia|Tracadie]] and [[Upper Big Tracadie]] in Nova Scotia, [[Priceville, Ontario|Priceville]], [[Shanty Bay, Ontario|Shanty Bay]], [[South Buxton, Ontario|South Buxton]] and [[Dresden, Ontario|Dresden]] in Ontario, the [[Maidstone, Saskatchewan|Maidstone]]/[[Eldon No. 471, Saskatchewan|Eldon]] area in Saskatchewan<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/~dsucha/shiloh.html |title=Shiloh Baptist Church Cemetery |publisher=Ucalgary.ca |accessdate=22 January 2011}}</ref> and [[Amber Valley, Alberta|Amber Valley]] in Alberta. North Preston currently has the highest concentration of Black Canadians in Canada, many of whom are descendants of Africville residents. [[Elm Hill, New Brunswick|Elm Hill]] in [[Hampstead Parish, New Brunswick|Hampstead Parish]] is the last remaining black community in [[New Brunswick]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Spray|first1=William |title=The Blacks in New Brunswick|date=1972|publisher=Brunswick Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pCQVAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=7 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most famous Black-dominated urban neighbourhoods in Canada is [[Montreal]]'s [[Little Burgundy]], regarded as the spiritual home of Canadian [[jazz]] due to its association with many of Canada's most influential early jazz musicians. In present-day Montreal, Little Burgundy and the boroughs of [[C\u00f4te-des-Neiges\u2013Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ce]], [[LaSalle, Quebec|LaSalle]], [[Pierrefonds-Roxboro]], [[Villeray\u2013Saint-Michel\u2013Parc-Extension]], and [[Montr\u00e9al-Nord]] have large Black populations, the latter of which has a large Haitian population.

Writer [[George Elliott Clarke]] has cited a [[McGill University]] study which found that fully 43 per cent of all Black Canadians were not counted as black in the 1991 Canadian census, because they had identified on census forms as British, French or other cultural identities which were not included in the census group of Black cultures.<ref>[http://news-archive.mcgill.ca/w97/black.htm \"The Complex Face of Black Canada\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304222923/http://news-archive.mcgill.ca/w97/black.htm |date=4 March 2016 }}, [[George Elliott Clarke]], ''[[McGill News]]'', Winter 1997.</ref>\n\nAlthough subsequent censuses have reported the population of Black Canadians to be much more consistent with the McGill study's revised 1991 estimate than with the official 1991 census data, no study has been conducted to determine whether some Black Canadians are still substantially missed by the self-identification method.\n\n==Terminology==\nOne of the ongoing controversies in the Black Canadian community revolves around appropriate terminologies. Many Canadians of [[Afro-Caribbean]] origin strongly object to the term ''African Canadian'', as it obscures their own culture and history, and this partially accounts for the term's less prevalent use in Canada, compared to the consensus ''African American'' south of the border.\n\n[[Black Nova Scotians]], a more distinct cultural group, of whom some can trace their Canadian ancestry back to the 1700s, use both terms, ''African Canadian'' and ''Black Canadian''. For example, there is an Office of African Nova Scotian Affairs and a [[Black Cultural Centre for Nova Scotia]].\n\n''Caribbean Canadian'' is often used to refer to Black Canadians of Caribbean heritage, although this usage can also be controversial because the Caribbean is not populated only by people of African origin, but also includes large groups of [[Indo-Caribbean]]s, [[Chinese Caribbean]]s, European Caribbeans, Syrian or Lebanese Caribbeans, Latinos and [[Amerindians]]. The term ''[[West Indian]]'' is often used by those of Caribbean ancestry, although the term is more of a cultural description than a racial one, and can equally be applied to groups of many different racial and ethnic backgrounds. The term ''Afro-Caribbean-Canadian'' is occasionally used in response to this controversy, although this term is not widely in common usage.\n\nMore specific national terms such as ''[[Jamaican Canadian]]'', ''[[Haitian Canadians|Haitian Canadian]]'', or ''[[Ghanaian Canadian]]'' are also used. There is no widely used alternative to ''Black Canadian'' that is accepted by the Afro-Caribbean population, those of more recent African extraction, and descendants of immigrants from the United States as an umbrella term for the whole group.<ref name=\"pruegger\" />\n\nOne increasingly common practice, seen in academic usage and in the names and mission statements of some Black Canadian cultural and social organizations but not yet in universal nationwide usage, is to always make reference to both the African and Caribbean communities.<ref>\"Black History Month Celebrations in Markham\". ''Markham Guiding Star'', 12 February 2008.</ref> For example, one key health organization dedicated to HIV/AIDS education and prevention in the Black Canadian community is now named the ''African and Caribbean Council on HIV/AIDS in Ontario'', the Toronto publication ''Pride'' bills itself as an \"African-Canadian and Caribbean-Canadian news magazine\", and [[CKFG-FM|G98.7]], a Black-oriented community radio station in Toronto, was initially branded as Caribbean African Radio Network.<ref name=carnset>[https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/music/article/932525--caribbean-radio-station-set-for-toronto-at-98-7-fm \"Caribbean radio station set for Toronto at 98.7 FM\"].

At this time Halifax was undergoing a major construction boom initiated by [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn]]'s efforts to modernize the city's defences.

Small farm lots were provided to the Maroons and they attempted to farm the infertile land. Like the former tenants, they found the land at Preston to be unproductive; as a result they had little success. The Maroons also found farming in Nova Scotia difficult because the climate would not allow cultivation of familiar food crops, such as [[bananas]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[pineapples]] or [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]].  Small numbers of Maroons relocated from Preston to Boydville for better farming land. The British Lieutenant Governor [[John Wentworth (governor)|Sir John Wentworth]] made an effort to change the Maroons' culture and beliefs by introducing them to [[Christianity]].

From the late 1820s, through the time that [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|the United Kingdom itself forbade slavery in 1833]], until the [[American Civil War]] began in 1861, the Underground Railroad brought tens of thousands of [[fugitive slave]]s to Canada. In 1819, [[Sir John Robinson, 1st Baronet, of Toronto|Sir John Robinson]], the Attorney-General of Upper Canada, ruled: \"Since freedom of the person is the most important civil right protected by the law of England...the negroes are entitled to personal freedom through residence in Upper Canada and any attempt to infringe their rights will be resisted in the courts\".<ref>Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 93.</ref> After Robinson's ruling in 1819, judges in Upper Canada refused American requests to extradite run-away slaves who reached Upper Canada under the grounds \"every man is free who reaches British ground\".<ref>Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 27.</ref> One song popular with African Americans called the ''[[Song of the Free]]'' had the lyrics: \"I'm on my way to Canada, That cold and distant land, The dire effects of slavery, I can no longer stand, Farewell, old master, Don't come after me, I'm on my way to Canada, Where colored men are free!\".<ref>Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 25.</ref>\n\nIn 1850, the United States Congress passed the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]], which gave bounty hunters the right to recapture run-away slaves anywhere in the United States and ordered all federal, state and municipal law enforcement to co-operate with the bounty hunters in seizing run-away slaves.<ref name=\"Hill, Daniel page 32\">Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 32.</ref> Since the Fugitive Slave Act stripped accused fugitive slaves of any legal rights such as the right to testify in court that they were not run-away slaves, cases of freemen and freewomen being kidnapped off the streets to be sold into slavery become common.<ref name=\"Hill, Daniel page 32\"/> The U.S justice system in the 1850s was hostile to black people, and little inclined to champion their rights. In 1857, in the [[Dred Scott v.

As a result of the Fugitive Slave Act and legal rulings to expand slavery in the United States, many free blacks living in the United States chose to seek sanctuary in Canada with one newspaper in 1850 mentioning that a group of blacks working for a Pittsburgh hotel had armed themselves with handguns before heading for Canada saying they were \"...{{nbsp}}determined to die rather be captured\".<ref name=\"Hill, Daniel page 32\"/> The ''Toronto Colonist'' newspaper on 17 June 1852 noted that almost every ship or boat coming into Toronto harbor from the American side of Lake Ontario seemed to be carrying a run-away slave.<ref name=\"Hill, Daniel page 32\"/> One of the more active \"conductors\" on the Underground Railroad was [[Harriet Tubman]], the \"Black Moses\" who made 11 trips to bring about 300 run-away slaves to Canada, most of whom settled in St. Catherines.<ref>Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 35.</ref> Tubman guided her \"passengers\" on nocturnal journeys (travelling via day was too risky) through the forests and swamps, using as her compass the north-star and on cloudy nights seeing what side the moss was growing on trees, to find the best way to Canada.<ref name=\"Hill, Daniel page 38\">Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 38.</ref> Such trips on the Underground Railroad involved much privation and suffering as Tubman and her \"passengers\" had to avoid both the bounty-hunters and law enforcement and could go for days without food as they travelled through the wilderness, always following the north-star.<ref name=\"Hill, Daniel page 38\"/> Tubman usually went to Rochester, New York, where Frederick Douglass would shelter the run-aways and crossed over to Canada at Niagara Falls.<ref>Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 38-39.</ref> Unlike the U.S. customs, which under the Fugitive Slave Act had to co-operate with the bounty hunters, the customs authorities on the Canadian side of the border were far more helpful and \"looked the other way\" when Tubman entered Canada with her \"passengers\".<ref>Hill, Daniel ''The Freedom-Seekers'', Agincourt: Book Society of Canada, 1981 page 39.</ref>\n\n[[File:Samuel Ward.jpg|thumb|200px|Rev.

Another source of estrangement was the work of one of Canada's leading progressives, the feminist [[Emily Murphy]]. In a series of articles for ''[[Maclean's]]'' in the early 1920s, which were later turned into the 1922 book ''The Black Candle'', Murphy blamed all of the problems on drug addiction amongst white Canadians on \"Negro drug dealers\" and Chinese opium dealers \"of fishy blood\", accusing Black Canadians and Chinese Canadians of trying to destroy white supremacy by getting white Canadians addicted to drugs.<ref name=\"MacQueen\">{{cite web\n |last        = MacQueen\n |first       = Rod\n |title       = Why it's time to legalize marijuana \n |website        = \n |publisher   = Maclean's  \n |date        =  10 June 2013\n |url         = https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/why-its-time-to-legalize-marijuana/\n |accessdate  = 29 May 2008\n}}</ref> ''The Black Candle'' was written in a sensationalist and lurid style meant to appeal to the racial fears of white Canadians, and in this Murphy was completely successful.<ref name=\"MacQueen\"/> Due to the popularity of ''The Black Candle'', Chinese immigration to Canada was stopped via the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1923.  Marijuana was also banned in 1923 out of the fear prompted by Murphy that marijuana was a drug used by Black Canadians to \"corrupt\" white Canadians.<ref name=\"MacQueen\"/> A report by the Senate in 2002 noted: \"Early drug legislation was largely based on a moral panic, racist sentiment and a notorious absence of debate.\"<ref name=\"MacQueen\"/> Perhaps even more importantly, Murphy established a perceived connection between Black Canadians, drugs, and crime in the minds of white Canadians that continues to this day.\n\nMontreal was the largest and most wealthiest city in Canada in the 1920s and also the most cosmopolitan, having a French-Canadian majority with substantial English, Scots, Irish, Italian, and Jewish communities. The multi-cultural atmosphere in Montreal allowed a black community to be established in the 1920s. The Black community that emerged in Montreal in the 1920s was largely American in origin, centring on the \"sporting district\" between St. Antoine and Bonaventure streets, which had a reputation as a \"cool\" neighbourhood, known for its lively and often riotous nightclubs that opened at 11:00 pm and closed at 5:00 am, where the latest in Afro-American jazz was played, alcohol was consumed in conspicuous quantities, and illegal gambling was usually tolerated.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 333-334\">Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 pp. 333\u2013334.</ref> The Nemderloc Club (nemderloc being \"colred men\" spelled backwards), which opened in 1922, was the most famous black club in Montreal, being very popular with both locals and Americans seeking to escape Prohibition by coming to Canada, where alcohol was still legal, hence the saying that American tourists wanted to \"drink Canada dry\".<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 333\">Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 333.</ref> Many of the Afro-Americans who settled in the \"sporting district\" of Montreal came from Harlem to seek a place where it was legal to drink alcohol.<ref>Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 p. 333</ref> Relations between the police and the black community in Montreal were unfriendly with the St. Antoine district being regularly raided by the police looking for illegal drugs and gambling establishments.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 333-334\"/> Despite its reputation as the \"coolest\" neighborhood in Montreal, the \"sporting district\", now known as the [[Little Burgundy]] neighborhood was a centre of poverty with the water being unsafe to drink and a death rate that was twice the norm in Montreal.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 333\"/>\n\nAs the Afro-Americans who came to work as railroad porters in Canada were all men, about 40 per cent of the Black men living in Montreal in the 1920s were married to white women.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 333\"/> This statistic excluded those in common-law relationships, which were also common, and which estranged the Black community of Montreal from the conservative and deeply Christian rural Black communities in Ontario and Nova Scotia, who were offended by the prevalence of casual sex and common-law relationships in the Black community in Montreal.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 334\">Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 p. 334.</ref> The Afro-American community in Montreal was seen, perhaps not entirely fairly, as a centre of debauchery and licentiousness by the other Black communities in Canada, who made a point of insisting that Montreal was not all representative of their communities.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 334\"/> The West Indian communities in the Maritime provinces, with the largest number working in the Cape Breton steel mills and in the Halifax shipyards always referred pejoratively to the older Black community in Nova Scotia as the \"Canadians\" and the Black communities in Quebec and Ontario as the \"Americans\".<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 334\"/> The West Indian communities in Nova Scotia in the 1920s were Anglican, fond of playing cricket, and unlike the other Black communities in Canada were often involved in Back-to-Africa movements.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 334\"/>\n\nThe historian Robin Winks described the various Black Canadian communities in the 1920s as being very diverse, which he described as being made up of \"rural blacks from small towns in Nova Scotia, prosperous farmers from Ontario, long-time residents of Vancouver Island, sophisticated New York newcomers to Montreal, activist West Indians who were not, they insisted, Negroes at all\" \u2013 indeed so diverse that unity was difficult.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 335\">Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 335.</ref> At the same time, Winks wrote that racism in Canada lacked a \"consistent pattern\" as \"racial borders shifted, gave way, and stood firm without consistency, predictability or even credibility\".<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 335\"/> Inspired by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in the United States, in 1924 J. W. Montgomery of Toronto and James Jenkins of London founded the Canadian League for the Advancement of Coloured People as an umbrella group for all of the Canadian Black communities.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 335\"/> Another attempt to provide unity for the Black communities in Canada was made by the followers of [[Marcus Garvey]]'s United Negro Improvement Association, which opened its first Canadian branch in Montreal in 1919.<ref>Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 414.</ref> After his deportation from the United States in 1927, Garvey settled in Montreal in 1928.<ref>Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 415.</ref> However, when Garvey urged his American followers not to vote for Herbert Hoover in the 1928 election, the American consul in Montreal complained about this \"interference\" in American politics and Garvey was expelled from Canada at the urging of the U.S. government.<ref>Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 pages 415\u2013416.</ref> Garvey was allowed to return to Canada in 1936 and 1937 where he held rallies in Toronto preaching his Back-to-Africa message.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 416\">Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 416.</ref> Garvey, an extremely charismatic man who inspired intense devotion in his followers, proved to be a divisive and controversial figure with his Back-to-Africa message and his insistence that black people embrace segregation as the best way forward.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 416\"/> Most Black Canadian community leaders rejected Garvey's message, arguing that Canada, not Africa, was their home and that embracing segregation was a retrogressive and self-defeating move.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 416\"/>\n\nThe Great Depression hit rural Canada very hard and Black Canadian farmers especially hard.<ref name=\"Walker\"/> One consequence was that many of the Black Canadian villages and hamlets in Ontario and Nova Scotia, some which were founded in the 18th century as Loyalist settlements, became abandoned as their inhabitants moved to the cities in search of work.<ref name=\"Walker\"/> In turn, the movement of Black Canadians to the cities brought them brutally face to face with racism as a series of informal \"Jim Crow\" restrictions governed restaurants, bars, hotels, and theatres while many landlords refused to rent to black tenants.<ref>Reynolds, Glenn ''Viola Desmond's Canada'', Halifax: Fernwood Publishing, 2016 pp. 53\u201354.</ref> In October 1937, when a Black man purchased a house in [[Trenton, Nova Scotia]], hundreds of white people stormed the house, beat up its owner and destroyed the house under the grounds that a Black man moving into the neighbourhood would depress property values.<ref>Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 419.</ref> Inspired by the unwillingness of the police to protect a Black man, the mob then destroyed two other homes owned by Black men, an action praised by the mayor for raising property values in Trenton, and the only person charged by the police was a Black man who punched out a white trying to destroy his home.<ref>Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 pages 419\u2013420.</ref> Many Black Nova Scotians moved into a neighbourhood of Halifax that came to be known as Africville, which the white population of Halifax called \"Nigger Town\".<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 420\">Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 420.</ref> Segregation in Truro, Nova Scotia, was practised so fiercely that its Black residents took to calling it \"Little Mississippi\".<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 420\"/> The 1930s saw a dramatic increase in the number and activities of Black self-help groups to deal with the impact of racism and the Depression.<ref>Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 pages 411\u2013414.</ref> Another change wrought by the Depression was a change in Black families as most married Black women had to work in order to provide for their families, marking the end of an era when only the husband worked.<ref>Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 pages 412.</ref>\n\n===1940s and 1950s===\n\nIn the Second World War, Black volunteers to the armed forces were initially refused, but the Canadian Army starting in 1940 agreed to take Black volunteers, and by 1942 were willing to give Blacks officers' commissions.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 421\">Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 421.</ref> Unlike in World War I, there were no segregated units in the Army and Canadian Blacks always served in integrated units.<ref name=\"veterans.gc.ca\"/> The Army was rather more open to Black Canadians rather than the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) and the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), which both refused for some time to accept Black volunteers.<ref name=\"veterans.gc.ca\"/> By 1942, the RCN had accepted Canadian Blacks as sailors while the RCAF had accepted blacks as ground crews and even as airmen, which meant giving them an officer's commission as in the RCAF airmen were always officers.<ref name=\"veterans.gc.ca\"/> In 1942, newspapers gave national coverage when the five Carty brothers of Saint John, New Brunswick all enlisted in the RCAF on the same day with the general subtext being that Canada was more tolerant than the United States in allowing the Black Carty brothers to serve in the RCAF.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 421\"/> The youngest of the Carty brothers, Gerald Carty, served as a tail gunner on a Halifax bomber, flying 35 missions to bomb Germany and was wounded in action.<ref name=\"Profiles in Courage\"/> The mobilization of the Canadian economy for \"total war\" gave increased economic opportunities for both Black men and even more so for Black women, many of whom for the first time in their lives found well-paying jobs in war industries.<ref name=\"veterans.gc.ca\"/>\n\nIn general racism became less fashionable during World War II with two incidents in 1940 illustrating a tendency towards increased tolerance as feelings of wartime national solidarity made displays of prejudice less acceptable.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 420\"/> A Vancouver bar that refused to serve a Black man was fined by a judge when the said man complained while in Toronto a skating rink that turned away blacks found itself the object of a boycott and demonstrations by students from the University of Toronto until the owners of the rink finally agreed to accept Black patrons.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 420\"/> The incidents in Toronto and Vancouver, as small as they were, would have been inconceivable ten or even five years before.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 420\"/> Winks wrote that if the Second World War was not the end of racism in Canada, but it was the beginning of the end as for the first time that many practices that been considered normal were subject to increasing vocal criticism as many Black Canadians started to become more assertive.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 420\"/>\n\nIn 1942, following complaints from Black university graduates that the National Selective Service board assigned them inferior work, a campaign waged by the ''Globe & Mail'' newspaper, the Canadian Jewish Congress, and the ''Winnipeg Free Press'' led to a promise from the National Selective Service board to stop using race when assigning potential employees to employers.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 423\">Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 423.</ref> During the war, unions became more open to accepting Black members and Winks wrote the \"most important change\" to black Canadian community caused by World War II was \"the new militancy in the organized black labor unions\".<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 423\"/> The most militant Black unions was the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, which during the war won major wage increases for Black porters working on the railroads.<ref>Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 pages 424\u2013425.</ref> In Winnipeg, a Joint Labor Committee to Combat Racial Intolerance was formed to end discrimination against Jews and Ukrainian-Canadians, but soon agreed to take cases concerning Black Canadians.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 423\"/> In 1944, Ontario passed the Racial Discrimination Act, which banned the use of any symbol or sign by any businesses with the aim of racial discrimination, which was the first law in Canada intended to address the practice of many businesses of refusing to take Black customers.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 427\">Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 427.</ref>\n\n[[File: Viola Desmond.jpg|thumb|left|Viola Desmond. In 1946, her decision to sit in the whites-only section of a theatre in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, led to her conviction in a controversial case, for which she was pardoned for in 2010.]]\n\nIn 1946, a Black woman from Halifax, [[Viola Desmond]], watched a film in a segregated cinema in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, which led to her being dragged out of the theatre by the manager and a policeman.<ref name=\"Reynolds, Glenn page 61\">Reynolds, Glenn ''Viola Desmond's Canada'', Halifax: Fernwood Publishing, 2016 page 61.</ref> Desmond was convicted and fined for not paying the one cent difference in sales tax between buying a ticket in the white section, where she sat, and the Black section, where she was supposed to sit.<ref name=\"Reynolds, Glenn page 61\"/> The Desmond case attracted much publicity as various civil rights groups rallied in her defense. Desmond fought the fine in the appeals court, where she lost, but the incident led the Nova Scotia Association for the Advancement of Coloured People to pressure the Nova Scotia government to pass the Fair Employment Act of 1955 and Fair Accommodations Act of 1959 to end segregation in Nova Scotia.<ref>Reynolds, Glenn ''Viola Desmond's Canada'', Halifax: Fernwood Publishing, 2016 p. 62.</ref> Following more pressure from Black Canadian groups, in 1951 Ontario passed the Fair Employment Practices Act outlawing racial discrimination in employment and the Fair Accommodation Practices Act of 1955, which outlawed discrimination in housing and renting.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 427\"/> In 1958, Ontario established the Anti-Discrimination Commission, which was renamed the Human Rights Commission in 1961.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 427\"/> Led by the American-born Black sociologist [[Daniel G. Hill]], the Ontario Anti-Discrimination Commission investigated 2,000 cases of racial discrimination in its first two years, and was described as having a beneficial effect on the ability of Canadian Blacks to obtain employment.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 428\">Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 p. 428.</ref> In 1953, Manitoba passed the Fair Employment Act, which was modeled after the Ontario law, and New Brunswick, Saskatchewan and British Columbia passed similar laws in 1956, followed by Quebec in 1964.<ref name=\"Winks, Robin page 428\"/>\n\nThe town of [[Dresden, Ontario]] was especially notorious for segregation with the majority of its black residents living along two blocks on Main Street.<ref>Reynolds, Glenn ''Viola Desmond's Canada'', Halifax: Fernwood Publishing, 2016 page 55</ref> In 1949, the journalist Sidney Katz wrote in ''Maclean's'' the article \"Jim Crow Lives in Dresden\" that:\"...although Dresden citizens do not like to talk about it, Negroes cannot eat at the town's three restaurants serving regular meals, cannot get a haircut in the four regular barbershops, cannot send their wives to the only beauty parlor\".<ref name=\"Reynolds, Glenn page 55\">Reynolds, Glenn ''Viola Desmond's Canada'', Halifax: Fernwood Publishing, 2016 page 55.</ref> Katz found that the majority of businesses discriminated against black Dresdeners because of the influence of Morley McKay, the outspokenly racist owner of the very popular Kay's Grill restaurant, who vocally objected to any businesses that might open its doors to black customers.<ref name=\"Reynolds, Glenn page 55\"/> McKay got around the Racial Discrimination Act of 1944 by simply refusing to allow black customers to enter Kay's Grill, a practice that was followed by many Dresden businesses who feared that McKay would organize a boycott by white customers.<ref>Reynolds, Glenn ''Viola Desmond's Canada'', Halifax: Fernwood Publishing, 2016 page 56.</ref> However, there was no segregation in Dresden's schools, and Katz wrote it was common \"to see colored and while children walking the streets arm and arm\".<ref>Reynolds, Glenn ''Viola Desmond's Canada'', Halifax: Fernwood Publishing, 2016 page 55-56.</ref>\n\nTo end segregation in Dresden, [[Hugh Burnett]], a black World War II veteran who owned a carpentry business in Dresden, founded the National Unity Association (NUA) in 1948.<ref name=\"Reynolds, Glenn page 58\">Reynolds, Glenn ''Viola Desmond's Canada'', Halifax: Fernwood Publishing, 2016 page 58.</ref> Most of leaders of the NUA were World War II veterans, who were incensed at the widespread discrimination in Dresden.<ref name=\"Reynolds, Glenn page 58\"/> After the all white council of Dresden dismissed Burnett's demand that a non-discrimination clause be added to all business licences, Burnett formed an alliance with [[Kalmen Kaplansky]], the president of the [[Jewish Labour Committee]].<ref name=\"Reynolds, Glenn page 58\"/> Burnett and Kaplansky waged an effective media campaign highlighting the injustice of veterans being treated like second class citizens, and in 1949 met with the Premier, [[Leslie Frost]], to press their case.<ref name=\"Reynolds, Glenn page 58\"/> Frost proved to be sympathetic and in response to the lobbying of Burnett and Kaplansky, toughened the Racial Discrimination Act in 1951, passed the Fair Employment Practices Act the same year, followed by the Fair Accommodations Act of 1954.<ref name=\"Reynolds, Glenn page 59\">Reynolds, Glenn ''Viola Desmond's Canada'', Halifax: Fernwood Publishing, 2016 page 59.</ref> When McKay continued to turn away black customers from Kay's Grill, he was convicted of racial discrimination.<ref name=\"Reynolds, Glenn page 59\"/> On 16 November 1956, two black members of the NUA finally entered Kay's Grill and were served without incident.<ref name=\"Reynolds, Glenn page 59\"/>\n\n===1960s and 1970s===\n\nOn 21 March 1960, in the [[Sharpeville massacre]], the South African police gunned down 67 Black South Africans protesting ''apartheid'', which in a sign of changing racial attitudes caused much controversy in Canada.<ref>Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 446.</ref> There was considerable public pressure on the Prime Minister [[John Diefenbaker]] to ask for South Africa to be expelled from the Commonwealth following the Sharpeville massacre with many noting that the South African prime minister [[Hendrik Verwoerd]] was an admirer of Nazi Germany.<ref>Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 pages 446\u2013447.</ref> At the conference of the Commonwealth prime ministers in London in 1960, Diefenbaker tried to avoid discussing the subject of expelling South Africa, but at the next conference in London in 1961, he played a leading role in passing a resolution declaring racial discrimination incompatible with Commonwealth membership, which led to Verwoerd storming out of the conference and quitting the Commonwealth.<ref>Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 pages 447\u2013448.</ref> The subject of condemning South Africa for ''apartheid'' benefited the Black Canadians since it suggested that racism was no longer acceptable anywhere in the Commonwealth at a time when Commonwealth membership mattered greatly to Canadians.<ref>Winks, Robin ''The Blacks in Canada'', Montreal: McGill Press, 1997 page 449.</ref>\n\nCanada maintained its restrictions of immigration until 1962, when racial rules were eliminated from the immigration laws. This coincided with the dissolution of the [[British Empire]] in the Caribbean. By the mid-1960s, approximately 15,000 Caribbean immigrants had settled in Toronto.<ref>[http://journals.hil.unb.ca/index.php/acadiensis/article/view/15385/16525#re1no2 \"Confederation\u2019s Casualties: The \"Maritimer\" as a Problem in 1960s Toronto\"], ''Acadiensis''. Retrieved 5 February 2014.</ref> Over the next decades, several hundred thousand Afro-Caribbeans arrived, becoming the predominant black population in Canada. Between 1950 and 1995, about 300,000 people from the West Indies settled in Canada.<ref name=\"Walker\"/> Outside of the Maritime provinces, where the majority of the black population are the descendants of black Loyalists and American runaway slaves, the majority of black Canadians are descended from immigrants from the West Indies.<ref name=\"Walker\"/> Since then, an increasing number of new immigrants from Africa have been coming to Canada;<ref name=canada/> they have also immigrated to the United States and Europe. This includes large numbers of refugees, but also many skilled and professional workers pursuing better economic conditions. About 150,000 people from Africa immigrated to Canada between 1950 and 1995.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\nHowever, a sizeable number of Black Canadians who descend from freed American slaves can still be found in Nova Scotia and parts of [[Southwestern Ontario]]. Some descendants of the freed American slaves, many of whom were of mixed race descent, have mixed into the white Canadian community and have mostly lost their ethnic identity. Some descendants returned to the United States. [[Bangor, Maine]], for example, received many Black Canadians from the Maritime provinces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?dest=9999999997&product_id=4029034 |title=Black Bangor: African Americans in a Maine Community, 1880\u20131950 \u2013 Wal-Mart |publisher=Walmart.com |date=8 November 2006 |accessdate=22 January 2011}}</ref>\n \nLike other recent immigrants to Canada, Black Canadian immigrants have settled preferentially in provinces matching the language of their country of origin.

As the Hall building burned and the policemen beat the students, onlookers in the crowds outside chanted \"Burn, niggers, burn!\" and \"Let the niggers burn!\".<ref name=\"Lambeth\"/> Afterwards, the protesting students were divided by race by the police with charges laid against the 97 black students present in the Hall building.

Its population was relocated and it was demolished in the 1960s to facilitate the urban expansion of the city. Similarly, the [[Hogan's Alley, Vancouver|Hogan's Alley]] neighbourhood in [[Vancouver]] was largely demolished in 1970, with only a single small laneway in [[Strathcona, Vancouver|Strathcona]] remaining.\n\nThe [[Wilberforce Colony]] in Ontario was also a historically Black settlement. It evolved demographically as Black settlers moved away, and became dominated by ethnic Irish settlers who renamed the village [[Lucan, Ontario|Lucan]]. A small group of Black American settlers from San Francisco were the original inhabitants of [[Saltspring Island]] in the mid-19th century.\n\nOther notable Black settlements include [[North Preston, Nova Scotia|North Preston]], Sunnyville, [[Lincolnville, Nova Scotia|Lincolnville]], [[Tracadie, Nova Scotia|Tracadie]] and [[Upper Big Tracadie]] in Nova Scotia, [[Priceville, Ontario|Priceville]], [[Shanty Bay, Ontario|Shanty Bay]], [[South Buxton, Ontario|South Buxton]] and [[Dresden, Ontario|Dresden]] in Ontario, the [[Maidstone, Saskatchewan|Maidstone]]/[[Eldon No. 471, Saskatchewan|Eldon]] area in Saskatchewan<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/~dsucha/shiloh.html |title=Shiloh Baptist Church Cemetery |publisher=Ucalgary.ca |accessdate=22 January 2011}}</ref> and [[Amber Valley, Alberta|Amber Valley]] in Alberta.
