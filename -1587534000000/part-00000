Co. to produce railway and logging equipment at its plant in West Seattle. In February 1908, the Seattle Car Manufacturing Co. opened a modern railcar manufacturing plant in Renton. The destruction of Seattle Car's Youngstown plant by fire, coupled with the repercussions of the national financial panic of 1907, had placed the company in voluntary receivership. The new plant gave the business new momentum and company president William Pigott (1860-1929) and in particular the company vice president Oliver D. Colvin successfully shepherded the company through this difficult period. The company later with Twohy Brothers of Portland in 1915 to become '''Pacific Car and Foundry Company''', a name it retained for the next 55 years. In 1924, William Pigott sold control of the company to [[American Car & Foundry]] Company.\n\nPaul Pigott, son of the founder, acquired a major interest in the company from American Car in 1934. Under his leadership, the company expanded its products and introduced the Carco line of power winches for use on crawler tractors in the logging industry. This product line later became the basis for PACCAR Winch, located in [[Oklahoma]], which now includes Braden, Carco and Gearmatic.\n\nThe company entered the heavy-duty truck market in 1945 with its first major acquisition, [[Kenworth|Kenworth Motor Truck Company]] of [[Seattle]]. Pacific Car and Foundry greatly expanded its heavy-duty truck capability with the purchase of [[Peterbilt|Peterbilt Motors Company]] in 1958. That same year, the acquisition of Dart Truck Company permitted its entry into the entirely new market of mining vehicles.\n\nThe company's Structural Steel division fabricated the steel for the construction of the Space Needle for the [[Century 21 Exposition|1962 Seattle World Fair]]. Later, it played a major part in the construction of the [[Grand Coulee Dam]]'s third powerhouse as well as the [[World Trade Center]] in [[New York]].\n\nIn 1960, Kenworth expanded into Mexico, with 49 percent participation in an affiliate company, Kenworth Mexicana S.A. de C.V. In 1966 PACCAR entered the Australian truck market with the establishment of a Kenworth truck assembly plant near [[Melbourne]].\n\nAlso in 1960, Carco Acceptance Corporation, currently PACCAR Financial Corp, was launched to facilitate domestic sales of trucks.\n\nIn 1968 the Dynacraft division was formed to provide belts, hoses, adapters, and other accessories for Kenworth and Peterbilt truck plants. \n\nKenworth Australia purchased 28&nbsp;acres (11&nbsp;ha) of land at suburban [[Bayswater, Victoria|Bayswater]] \u2013 18&nbsp;miles (30&nbsp;km) east of Melbourne, in 1969, to build a factory and office complex. By the end of 1970, the 56,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft (5,200&nbsp;m\u00b2) complex was completed. Initially, trucks were produced on a [[Knock-down kit|completely knocked down]] basis. During Kenworth Australia's subsequent history, it become a major force in the local, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea markets.\n\nBelieving \"Pacific Car and Foundry Company\" no longer accurately reflected the company's products and activities, directors and shareholders voted to adopt PACCAR Inc as its new name in 1972.\n\nIn 1972, PACCAR International was formed in [[Bellevue, Washington]] to consolidate the sales and service of company products abroad. PACCAR Parts was established in [[Renton, Washington|Renton]] a year later to supply aftermarket parts.\n\nIn 1975 PACCAR purchased International Car Company of [[Kenton, Ohio]], North America's leading [[caboose]] manufacturer.\n\nPACCAR Leasing Corporation was formed in 1980 to offer full-service leasing and rental programs through PACCAR's dealer network. A year later, PACCAR became a European truck manufacturer with the acquisition of [[Foden Trucks]] in England.<ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/27th-september-1980/5/saviour-for-fodens Saviour for Fodens] ''[[Commercial Motor]]'' September 27, 1980 page 5</ref><ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/18th-october-1980/5/fodens-takeover-1600-jobs-lost Fodens takeover: 1,600 jobs lost] ''Commercial Motor'' October 18, 1980 page 5</ref>\n\nPACCAR's new Technical Center opened in July 1982. Located approximately 65 miles north of Seattle, the multimillion-dollar center underscored the company's commitment to technical excellence, quality and value in the products it manufactures.\n\nIn 1986, PACCAR acquired Trico Industries, manufacturing oil field pumps and accessories. In December 1997 Trico was sold to EVI of [[Houston]].\n\nIn 1987, PACCAR acquired Washington-based Al's Auto Supply, an aftermarket retailer and wholesale distributor of auto parts and accessories. In 1988, PACCAR expanded its subsidiary PACCAR Automotive. when it purchased Grand Auto, a [[California]] based retailer of auto parts and accessories. In October 1999, PACCAR Automotive was sold to CSK Auto.\n\nPACCAR solidified its place in the Mexican heavy-duty truck market by purchasing the remaining portion of its Mexican operation, VILPAC, S.A. in 1995.\n\nThe acquisition of [[DAF Trucks]] in 1996 and [[Leyland Trucks]] in 1998 established PACCAR as one of the major truck manufacturers in the world.<ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/10th-october-1996/6/paccar-set-to-take-over-daf-trucks Paccar set to rake over Daf Trucks] ''Commercial Motor'' October 10, 1996</ref><ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/7th-may-1998/26/paccar-aims-to-cut-queue-by-charles-young-paccars Paccar aims to cut queue] ''Commercial Motor'' May 7, 1998</ref><ref>[http://europe.autonews.com/article/19980511/ANE/805110836/paccar-acquires-leyland-trucks Paccar acquires Leyland Trucks] ''Automotive News Europe'' May 11, 1998</ref> DAF Trucks is a Netherlands-based truck company with production facilities in [[Eindhoven]], The Netherlands and [[Westerlo]], Belgium.

Co. to produce railway and logging equipment at its plant in West Seattle. In February 1908, the Seattle Car Manufacturing Co. opened a modern railcar manufacturing plant in Renton. The destruction of Seattle Car's Youngstown plant by fire, coupled with the repercussions of the national financial panic of 1907, had placed the company in voluntary receivership. The new plant gave the business new momentum and company president William Pigott (1860-1929) and in particular the company vice president Oliver D. Colvin successfully shepherded the company through this difficult period. The company later with Twohy Brothers of Portland in 1915 to become '''Pacific Car and Foundry Company''', a name it retained for the next 55 years. In 1924, William Pigott sold control of the company to [[American Car & Foundry]] Company.\n\nPaul Pigott, son of the founder, acquired a major interest in the company from American Car in 1934. Under his leadership, the company expanded its products and introduced the Carco line of power winches for use on crawler tractors in the logging industry. This product line later became the basis for PACCAR Winch, located in [[Oklahoma]], which now includes Braden, Carco and Gearmatic.\n\nThe company entered the heavy-duty truck market in 1945 with its first major acquisition, [[Kenworth|Kenworth Motor Truck Company]] of [[Seattle]]. Pacific Car and Foundry greatly expanded its heavy-duty truck capability with the purchase of [[Peterbilt|Peterbilt Motors Company]] in 1958. That same year, the acquisition of Dart Truck Company permitted its entry into the entirely new market of mining vehicles.\n\nThe company's Structural Steel division fabricated the steel for the construction of the Space Needle for the [[Century 21 Exposition|1962 Seattle World Fair]]. Later, it played a major part in the construction of the [[Grand Coulee Dam]]'s third powerhouse as well as the [[World Trade Center]] in [[New York]].\n\nIn 1960, Kenworth expanded into Mexico, with 49 percent participation in an affiliate company, Kenworth Mexicana S.A. de C.V. In 1966 PACCAR entered the Australian truck market with the establishment of a Kenworth truck assembly plant near [[Melbourne]].\n\nAlso in 1960, Carco Acceptance Corporation, currently PACCAR Financial Corp, was launched to facilitate domestic sales of trucks.\n\nIn 1968 the Dynacraft division was formed to provide belts, hoses, adapters, and other accessories for Kenworth and Peterbilt truck plants. \n\nKenworth Australia purchased 28&nbsp;acres (11&nbsp;ha) of land at suburban [[Bayswater, Victoria|Bayswater]] \u2013 18&nbsp;miles (30&nbsp;km) east of Melbourne, in 1969, to build a factory and office complex. By the end of 1970, the 56,000&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft (5,200&nbsp;m\u00b2) complex was completed. Initially, trucks were produced on a [[Knock-down kit|completely knocked down]] basis. During Kenworth Australia's subsequent history, it become a major force in the local, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea markets.\n\nBelieving \"Pacific Car and Foundry Company\" no longer accurately reflected the company's products and activities, directors and shareholders voted to adopt PACCAR Inc as its new name in 1972.\n\nIn 1972, PACCAR International was formed in [[Bellevue, Washington]] to consolidate the sales and service of company products abroad. PACCAR Parts was established in [[Renton, Washington|Renton]] a year later to supply aftermarket parts.\n\nIn 1975 PACCAR purchased International Car Company of [[Kenton, Ohio]], North America's leading [[caboose]] manufacturer.\n\nPACCAR Leasing Corporation was formed in 1980 to offer full-service leasing and rental programs through PACCAR's dealer network. A year later, PACCAR became a European truck manufacturer with the acquisition of [[Foden Trucks]] in England.<ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/27th-september-1980/5/saviour-for-fodens Saviour for Fodens] ''[[Commercial Motor]]'' September 27, 1980 page 5</ref><ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/18th-october-1980/5/fodens-takeover-1600-jobs-lost Fodens takeover: 1,600 jobs lost] ''Commercial Motor'' October 18, 1980 page 5</ref>\n\nPACCAR's new Technical Center opened in July 1982. Located approximately 65 miles north of Seattle, the multimillion-dollar center underscored the company's commitment to technical excellence, quality and value in the products it manufactures.\n\nIn 1986, PACCAR acquired Trico Industries, manufacturing oil field pumps and accessories. In December 1997 Trico was sold to EVI of [[Houston]].\n\nIn 1987, PACCAR acquired Washington-based Al's Auto Supply, an aftermarket retailer and wholesale distributor of auto parts and accessories. In 1988, PACCAR expanded its subsidiary PACCAR Automotive. when it purchased Grand Auto, a [[California]] based retailer of auto parts and accessories. In October 1999, PACCAR Automotive was sold to CSK Auto.\n\nPACCAR solidified its place in the Mexican heavy-duty truck market by purchasing the remaining portion of its Mexican operation, VILPAC, S.A. in 1995.\n\nThe acquisition of [[DAF Trucks]] in 1996 and [[Leyland Trucks]] in 1998 established PACCAR as one of the major truck manufacturers in the world.<ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/10th-october-1996/6/paccar-set-to-take-over-daf-trucks Paccar set to rake over Daf Trucks] ''Commercial Motor'' October 10, 1996</ref><ref>[http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/7th-may-1998/26/paccar-aims-to-cut-queue-by-charles-young-paccars Paccar aims to cut queue] ''Commercial Motor'' May 7, 1998</ref><ref>[http://europe.autonews.com/article/19980511/ANE/805110836/paccar-acquires-leyland-trucks Paccar acquires Leyland Trucks] ''Automotive News Europe'' May 11, 1998</ref> DAF Trucks is a Netherlands-based truck company with production facilities in [[Eindhoven]], The Netherlands and [[Westerlo]], Belgium.

PACCAR invested $400 million in the PACCAR Engine factory and technology center in Columbus, Mississippi, to manufacture the proprietary engines.\n\nIn 2013, PACCAR expanded its global operations with the opening of a new DAF factory in [[Ponta Grossa]], Brasil. The company invested $320 million in the 300,000 sq ft assembly facility on 569 acres. The factory assembles the DAF XF and CF vehicles for the South American market.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ttnews.com/articles/paccar-begins-production-daf-trucks-brazil|title=Paccar Begins Production of DAF Trucks in Brazil|date=2 October 2013|publisher=Transport Topics|accessdate=16 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nPACCAR announced its Silicon Valley Innovation Center in [[Sunnyvale]], California in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2017/07/25/paccar-to-open-silicon-valley-innovation-center.html|title=Truck giant Paccar plans to open innovation center in Silicon Valley|date=25 July 2017|publisher=Puget Sound Business Journal|accessdate=16 August 2019}}</ref> The center coordinates next-generation product development and identifies emerging technologies that will benefit future vehicle performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.paccarinnovation.com/|title=PACCAR Innovation Center}}</ref>\n\n==Divisions==\n[[File:Paccar MX engine.jpg|thumb|Paccar MX engine]]\n* [[Peterbilt]]\n* [[Kenworth]]\n* [https://www.kenworth.com.au/ Kenworth Australia]\n* [https://www.kenworth.com.mx/ Kenworth Mexico]\n* [[DAF Trucks]]\n* [[Leyland Trucks]]\n* PACCAR Parts\n* PACCAR Financial Services\n* PACCAR Powertrain\n* PACCAR ITD (Information Technology Division)\n* [https://www.paccarwinch.com/ PACCAR Winch] (Braden, Carco and Gearmatic brands)\n* Dynacraft\n* PACCAR Leasing\n\n==Financials==\n:''{{As of|2019}}''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.paccar.com/investors/sec-filingsdata-archive/|title=Investors - Investor & Shareholder Information {{!}} PACCAR|website=www.paccar.com|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It runs parallel to Naushad Ali Road (previously [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]]), a popular sea-front and promenade. Both roads are situated in Mumbai's [[Bandra]] (West) suburb (H-West Ward).\n\nSituated mainly on rolling hills with alternate steep and shallow sides, it garnered the name Pali Hill, although more than one hill is present. The main route of the road was smoothed and paved. The buildings and bungalows are set within the \"valleys\" and \"crests\" of the hills. Nearby localities include [[Pali Village]] and [[Pali Naka]].\n\n==History==\nUntil the 1950s, the area was mainly forested with dense undergrowth. Over the years, it was converted  to grow fruits and crops. At one time, the sea was plainly visible from the foothills.\n\nA few buildings were constructed by entrepreneurs and builders. However, most people lived in cottages or bungalows. Construction of apartment buildings commenced in the mid to late 1960s, including Nibbana Apartments.\n\nCottage dwellers slowly sold their homes to real estate developers and Pali Hill grew into an affluent neighbourhood.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n''[[K. Street Pali Hill]]'' (2004\u20132006), a thriller television soap on [[StarPlus]], produced by [[Ekta Kapoor]] ([[Balaji Telefilms]]) was set in the suburb.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nPali Hill has an expanse of trees that form arches over the roads. Originally an area of orchards, fields and untamed forests, from 1980-2020 it was deforested and made suitable for residential habitation. A few giant trees remain in building compounds, bungalow gardens and on the roads. The most widely seen tree is the [[Delonix regia|gulmohar tree]]. Large (and rare in Mumbai) [[banyan trees]], [[peepul tree]]s, [[mango trees]], [[ashoka tree]]s, wild [[almond trees]], wild [[neem tree]]s as well as a variety of shrubs, grasses, bamboos and trees, like those of the [[papaya]], [[jackfruit]], [[custard-apple]], and [[guava]]<nowiki/>are abundant.\n\nFlowering shrubs are cultivated and sometimes grow wild. Most abundant are [[bougainvillea]], [[jasmine]]s, [[Bird of paradise (flower)|birds of paradise flowers]] and other wild, indigenous varieties.\n\nPali Hill is frequented by migratory birds, present during different seasons. Although the native species are sparrows, [[Asian koel]]s, cuckoos, wrens, pigeons, crows and ravens; rare birds (from other parts of Mumbai/India) are present. Bai Avabai Framji Petit Girls High School sees egrets, storks, owls and other rare birds. Ashy dorus, kites, kestrels, hummingbirds, woodpeckers as well as seagulls and kingfishers (both \u2013 the small blue kingfisher as well as the more colourful variant) are present. Ornithologist [[Salim Ali]] was known to walk around Pali Hill with his binoculars and a notebook taking notes and listening to or making bird calls.\n\nMammals such as dogs (from street strays to pedigrees), cats and small bats are abundant.\n\n==Landmarks==\nPali Hill's landmarks are its buildings and bungalows. At the southern end is Rajendra Kumar Junction (Chowk). Its four roads lead west to Carter Road (via Pali Mala Road), north to Pali Hill, east to [[Pali Naka]] and south to the Auxilium Convent High School. At the northern end is Union Park, another crossing and the area around it. Candies eatery is another local landmark.\n\nThe road diverges downhill on the East side \u2013 the Zig Zag Road (named after its steep incline and acute curves). At this junction was the Anand Bungalow (owned by [[Dev Anand]]). Also at this junction is the bungalow of the Narangs, hoteliers, and owners of the Croissants patisserie and the Ambassador Flight kitchen. On Nargis Dutt road, further down on the west side is the House Of Sushil Kumar Shinde (former Chief Minister of Maharashtra & former Home Minister Of The Govt of India). On the other side residence of the late Rajni Patel ( Rajni Patel was a lawyer, trade union leader and politician \u2013 and much more \u2013 who dominated the political landscape of Bombay in the 1970s. He was a close associate and adviser of Indira Gandhi. A Cambridge-educated lawyer, he had been on the watch list of British authorities during his days in Britain and upon his return to India, got involved in cooperative movements and public life in general. His legal battles in the courts are legendary)Rajni Patel's widow Bakul Patel was a former Sheriff of Mumbai. More down the road on the hill is BSES Niwas, a property now being developed for and by [[Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group|Reliance ADAG]]now Adnani. lying adjacent is the Reservoir at 'The Top Of The Hill' holding and supplying Water to the residents of both sides of the Hill. Further down the southern slopes of the hill resided the Late Nargis Dutt and her husband the late Sunil Dutt, the two besides been thespians were also connected politically Mr. Sunil Dutt, a politician, after he joined the Indian National Congress party, he had the unique distinction of getting elected to the Parliament of India for five terms from the Mumbai North West constituency.\nOn the bend is the Residence of the famous Dilip Kumar whose thespian wife Saira Banu lives therein.\n\nDown towards Union Park & Golf Links at the North end if the hill is the residence of the former chief minister of Maharashtra Mr Narayan Rane.\nThe Golf Course today is no more, it is filed by high rise buildings over seeing the nets of The \"Danda' fishing Village.\n\nOther landmarks include Kangaroo Kids Nursery and Playschool, Juice Salon, Sundaram Stores, cozy home apartments. At Union Park lies Bai Avabai Framji Petit Girls' High School.\ndown the slope on the eastern side is the Pali Market, now under reconstruction.\nIn the 19th Century Pali Hill was called Pakhari HIll\n\n==Notable residents==\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2016}}\n* President of The Indian Music Industry & Phonographic Performance Ltd. and Ex-Chairman of Polygram Music Ltd. and Universal Music India, Vijay Lazarus;<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.indianmi.org/newsletter/August%201/The%20President's%20Desk.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=21 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018013738/http://www.indianmi.org/newsletter/August%201/The%20President's%20Desk.html |archive-date=18 October 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[[Indian Music Industry]]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.radioandmusic.com/biz/music/representative-bodies/imi/imi-president-vijay-lazarus-differences-radio-industry-need-be-bridged|title=IMI president Vijay Lazarus - Differences with the radio industry need to be bridged|website=www.radioandmusic.com}}</ref>\n* Late politician and actor, [[Sunil Dutt]]'s bungalow, as well as his daughter and Member of Parliament [[Priya Dutt]]'s and her brother [[Sanjay Dutt]]'s building;\n*[[Kripashankar Singh]] EX- Home Minister of Maharashtra, Presidents of [[Mumbai Regional Congress Committee|Mumbai Congress]], & MLA From [[Kalina (Vidhan Sabha constituency)|Kalina]] \n* [[Kumar Gaurav]] of Love Story fame\n* Actor [[Dilip Kumar]]'s and [[Saira Banu]]'s bungalow (currently caught in a heritage structure row and in a semi-ruin state);<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/cover-story/We-dont-want-Bollywood-in-our-backyard/articleshow/16119072.cms|title=We don't want Bollywood in our backyard|last=Apr 18|first=Updated|last2=2011|website=Mumbai Mirror|language=en|access-date=2019-07-31|last3=Ist|first3=02:40}}</ref>\n* Film personality Nasir's Hussain's bungalow \u2013 Pali Annexe (now being renovated); with grandson [[Imran Khan (Bollywood actor)|Imran Khan]]\n* [[Rajendranath Zutshi]] at Summer Palace\n* [[Aamir Khan]]'s flat at Belavista and [[Faisal Khan]] at Marina Apartments near the Bai Avabai Framji Petit Girls' High School at Union Park;\n* Film maker and director [[Rakeysh Om Prakash Mehra]]'s bungalow \u2013 Mamta\n* [[Gulzar]], poet, lyricist, writer, at his bungalow Boskiyana\n* [[Gulshan Bawra]], lyricist<ref name=down>{{cite web |title=Down the memory lane with Gulshan Bawra |url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/features/2007/07/09/2839/index.html |date=9 July 2007 |publisher=Screen Weekly }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n* [[Rishi Kapoor]], his wife [[Neetu Kapoor]] at the bungalow Krishna Raj\n*[[Ranbir Kapoor]] at Vastu Apartment with [[Alia Bhatt]]\n* [[Narayan Rane]] at Gautam Apartments\n* Actors [[Sanjeev Kumar]] near Petit School \n* [[Prem Chopra]], [[Moushmi Chatterjee]], [[Vinod Mehra]] and others\n* [[Anil Dhawan]], at Nibbana Apartments; \n* [[Amjad Khan (actor)|Amjad Khan]] and his family\n* Actor [[Pran (actor)|Pran]] and other eminent Film production icons\n* [[Mahesh Bhatt]] and [[Pooja Bhatt]] who used to stay at Green Acres\n* Models [[Tapur Chatterjee]] and [[Kirat Bhattal]] \n* [[Anna Singh]], fashion designer\n* [[Sameer Pitalwalla]], CEO of [[Culture Machine]]\n* [[Haresh Chawla]], CEO of [[CNBC-TV18]]\n* [[Kunal Kapoor]], film director\n* [[Emraan Hashmi]], Bollywood Actor; at Nibhana\n* [[Asha Sachdev]] at Sunset Heights\n* [[A.M.

It runs parallel to Naushad Ali Road (previously [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]]), a popular sea-front and promenade. Both roads are situated in Mumbai's [[Bandra]] (West) suburb (H-West Ward).\n\nSituated mainly on rolling hills with alternate steep and shallow sides, it garnered the name Pali Hill, although more than one hill is present. The main route of the road was smoothed and paved. The buildings and bungalows are set within the \"valleys\" and \"crests\" of the hills. Nearby localities include [[Pali Village]] and [[Pali Naka]].\n\n==History==\nUntil the 1950s, the area was mainly forested with dense undergrowth. Over the years, it was converted  to grow fruits and crops. At one time, the sea was plainly visible from the foothills.\n\nA few buildings were constructed by entrepreneurs and builders. However, most people lived in cottages or bungalows. Construction of apartment buildings commenced in the mid to late 1960s, including Nibbana Apartments.\n\nCottage dwellers slowly sold their homes to real estate developers and Pali Hill grew into an affluent neighbourhood.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n''[[K. Street Pali Hill]]'' (2004\u20132006), a thriller television soap on [[StarPlus]], produced by [[Ekta Kapoor]] ([[Balaji Telefilms]]) was set in the suburb.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nPali Hill has an expanse of trees that form arches over the roads. Originally an area of orchards, fields and untamed forests, from 1980-2020 it was deforested and made suitable for residential habitation. A few giant trees remain in building compounds, bungalow gardens and on the roads. The most widely seen tree is the [[Delonix regia|gulmohar tree]]. Large (and rare in Mumbai) [[banyan trees]], [[peepul tree]]s, [[mango trees]], [[ashoka tree]]s, wild [[almond trees]], wild [[neem tree]]s as well as a variety of shrubs, grasses, bamboos and trees, like those of the [[papaya]], [[jackfruit]], [[custard-apple]], and [[guava]]<nowiki/>are abundant.\n\nFlowering shrubs are cultivated and sometimes grow wild. Most abundant are [[bougainvillea]], [[jasmine]]s, [[Bird of paradise (flower)|birds of paradise flowers]] and other wild, indigenous varieties.\n\nPali Hill is frequented by migratory birds, present during different seasons. Although the native species are sparrows, [[Asian koel]]s, cuckoos, wrens, pigeons, crows and ravens; rare birds (from other parts of Mumbai/India) are present. Bai Avabai Framji Petit Girls High School sees egrets, storks, owls and other rare birds. Ashy dorus, kites, kestrels, hummingbirds, woodpeckers as well as seagulls and kingfishers (both \u2013 the small blue kingfisher as well as the more colourful variant) are present. Ornithologist [[Salim Ali]] was known to walk around Pali Hill with his binoculars and a notebook taking notes and listening to or making bird calls.\n\nMammals such as dogs (from street strays to pedigrees), cats and small bats are abundant.\n\n==Landmarks==\nPali Hill's landmarks are its buildings and bungalows. At the southern end is Rajendra Kumar Junction (Chowk). Its four roads lead west to Carter Road (via Pali Mala Road), north to Pali Hill, east to [[Pali Naka]] and south to the Auxilium Convent High School. At the northern end is Union Park, another crossing and the area around it. Candies eatery is another local landmark.\n\nThe road diverges downhill on the East side \u2013 the Zig Zag Road (named after its steep incline and acute curves). At this junction was the Anand Bungalow (owned by [[Dev Anand]]). Also at this junction is the bungalow of the Narangs, hoteliers, and owners of the Croissants patisserie and the Ambassador Flight kitchen. On Nargis Dutt road, further down on the west side is the House Of Sushil Kumar Shinde (former Chief Minister of Maharashtra & former Home Minister Of The Govt of India). On the other side residence of the late Rajni Patel ( Rajni Patel was a lawyer, trade union leader and politician \u2013 and much more \u2013 who dominated the political landscape of Bombay in the 1970s. He was a close associate and adviser of Indira Gandhi.

Frances divorced Andrew Clooney in the late 1930s, and Frances remarried William Stone in 1939 and they had one daughter Gail in 1945. Frances & Bill lived in [[Oakland, California]].\n\nThe family resided in the [[John Brett Richeson House]] in the late 1940s. Clooney's paternal grandfather sang in his mayoral election campaigns, which he won three times. The two sisters were close.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Sister act===\nRosemary and Betty Clooney were a close sister act, and sang together. The family lived in [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] in the early 1940s, where the girls continued to vocalize. In 1945, the sisters won a spot on Cincinnati's [[WLW]] Radio Station as singers. One day they were heard by bandleader Tony Pastor. The bandleader originally hesitated on hiring both sisters, but soon relented and so The Clooney Sisters hit the road with the Pastor band. They appeared in a movie short with the Pastor Orchestra in 1947. The Clooney Sisters recorded a number of songs for Columbia with the Tony Pastor Band like \"The Secretary Song\", \"I'm My Own Grandpa\", and \"If I Had A Million Dollars\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greatentertainersarchives.blogspot.co.uk/2011/11/forgotten-ones-betty-clooney.html|title=A TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE|publisher=Greatentertainersarchives.blogspot.co.uk|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1948, Rosemary was called to [[New York City]] to record \"[[Come On-a My House]]\" and Betty returned home to Cincinnati.

H. Almaas''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0251\u02d0|l|m|\u0259|s}} {{respell|AHL|m\u0259ss}}) is the pen name of '''A. Hameed Ali''' (born 1944), a [[Kuwaiti American]] author and spiritual teacher who writes about and teaches an approach to spiritual development informed by modern psychology and therapy which he calls the [[Diamond Approach]]. \"''Almaas''\" is the [[Arabic]] word for \"diamond\". \n\nAlmaas is originally from [[Kuwait]]. He is the spiritual head of the Ridhwan School. He may be described, among other things, as an [[Integral theory (philosophy)|Integral theorist]], [[mysticism|mystic]], [[spiritual teacher]] and an exponent of the [[perennial philosophy]].\n\nAlmaas' books were originally published by the Ridhwan School, under the Diamond Books publishing title, but are now published by [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]].\n\nThe Diamond Approach is a contemporary spiritual path integrating the teachings and practices of the ancient wisdom traditions with modern [[depth psychology]] ([[object relations theory]] in particular). The Diamond Approach is derived from the experiences of Almaas, along with Karen Johnson and Faisal Muqaddam (who split off early on to develop his own approach). They were among the first students of [[Claudio Naranjo]], an early pioneer of the integration of spiritual and therapeutic work.\n\nThe curriculum of the work draws upon the founders' backgrounds in [[Sufism]], [[Buddhism]] and the [[Fourth Way]]. Teachers of the Diamond Approach focus on the students' specific perception of their own immediate work issues.<ref>https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/frequently-asked-questions-faqs#Who_can_teach \"Q: Who can teach the Diamond Approach?\"</ref> Presentation of a canonical body of knowledge and practice is introduced over time as required.\n\n== Life ==\nA. Hameed Ali was born in [[Kuwait]] in 1944. He was a victim of [[polio]] at 18 months old and now walks with a crutch as a result.<ref>{{cite news\n | author=[[Tony Schwartz (author)|Schwartz, Tony]]\n | title = Uncovering The Essential Self\n | work = New Age Journal\n | date = May 1995\n | url =https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/uncovering-essential-self\n | accessdate = 16 April 2020\n}}</ref> At the age of 18, he moved to the United States to study at the [[University of California]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. Ali was working on his PhD in physics when he reached a turning point in his life that led him more and more into inquiring into the psychological and spiritual aspects of human nature. His interest in the truth of human nature and the true nature of reality resulted in the creation and unfoldment of the Diamond Approach.<ref name=bio>{{cite web|last=Almaas|first=A.H.|title=A. Hameed Ali|url=https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/founders|website=diamondapproach.org}}</ref>\n\n== Diamond Approach ==\nThe Diamond Approach is a spiritual teaching that utilizes a distinctive form of inquiry into realization, where the practice is the expression of realization. Its aim is absolute freedom that can be described as living realization, a dynamic enlightenment where transcendent truth lives personally in the world. This inquiry opens up the infinite creativity of our being, transforming our lives into a runaway realization, moving from realization to further realization.<ref>{{cite web|last=Almaas|first=A.H.|title=The Diamond Approach \u2013 Hameed Ali (A. H. Almaas)|url=http://www.ahalmaas.com/|website=ahalmaas.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Ridhwan Foundation is the nonprofit spiritual organization established to support and preserve the integrity of the Diamond Approach teaching. The Ridhwan Foundation is legally recognized as a church and the role of a teacher is equivalent to that of a minister. People are ordained as spiritual teachers of the Ridhwan Foundation, which is the name given to its ministers.\n\n=== Spiritual practice as a phenomenology of being ===\nThe Diamond Approach is described as a \"response to an important need that is being felt in many quarters, a need for a spiritually informed psychology, or conversely, for a psychologically grounded spirituality. This perspective does not separate psychological and spiritual experience, and hence sees no dichotomy between depth psychology and spiritual work... This body of knowledge is not an integration or synthesis of modern depth psychology and traditional spiritual understanding. The inclination to think in terms of integration of the two is due to the prevailing belief in the dichotomy between the fields of psychology and spirituality, a dichotomy in which the Diamond Mind understanding does not participate.\" (Almaas)<ref>Almaas, A. H. ''The Void: Inner Spaciousness and Ego Structure'', Shambhala Publications, Boston MA, 1986.</ref>\n\nThe Diamond Approach, according to its followers, can be called a Phenomenology of Being that offers a precise description of the various aspects and dimensions of Spirit or Being and is also a form of [[Spirituality|spiritual]] psychotherapy which seeks to heal the wounds of the soul by reconnecting it to Spirit.\n\n=== Principal ideas ===\n\n==== Structure of reality ====\nIn the Diamond Approach, reality is seen as consisting of three elements: God/Being/Spirit, Soul/Self and World/Cosmos.\n\n''Being'' is understood as the inner source and true nature of reality, which is the focus of the great spiritual traditions of both East and West, and is known as ''[[Dharmakaya]]'', ''[[Shunyata]]'', ''[[Brahman]]'' or ''[[Tao]]''. Being is understood as consisting of five co-emergent \"boundless dimensions\": Divine Love, Pure Presence, Nonconceptual Awareness, The Logos, and The Absolute.\n\n''Soul'' is understood to be the individual consciousness that connects the world with Being, an idea found in ancient [[Chinese philosophy]]. It is believed in the Diamond Approach that the soul can be experienced as a living presence that contains the thoughts, feelings and sensations usually called our \"self\".\n\n''World'' is understood as the outer manifestation of reality, the multitude of physical forms that all people are familiar with.\n\n==== Essence and the essential aspects ====\nWhile most spiritual paths conceive of Being as universal, the Diamond Approach also pays a great deal of attention to a more individual way of experiencing Being, called Essence. The concept of Essence is similar to the Hindu idea of ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]''. While Being is the true nature of all of reality, Essence is the portion of it that forms the true and personal nature of the soul. It is experienced as a substantial fluid Presence which can differentiate into various qualities or aspects, such as compassion, strength, will, joy, peace, love, value, humanness, personalness, identity, and space.<ref>Almaas, A. H. ''Essence'' Weiser Books, Boston MA, 1986.</ref><ref>[http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/e/essence.htm Essence & Spiritual Presence] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707032123/http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/e/essence.htm |date=7 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==== Theory of holes ====\nAs our soul develops it is faced with a double challenge: it must learn to function in the World, while also remaining connected to Spirit. For various reasons, some innate and others environmental, we slowly become alienated from our Essence through the development of fixed patterns of perception and behaviour known as the personality or ego. Each of these patterns or ego structures disconnects us from a specific Essential Aspect. In other words, it is built around the \"Hole\" of this aspect. By exploring its structure, both cognitively and experientially, one eventually confronts the Hole and by going through it the lost aspect is retrieved.<ref>Ch. 2 \u2013 \"The Theory of Holes.\" Almaas, A. H. ''Diamond Heart Book 1'', Shambhala, 2000.</ref>\n\n=== Methodology ===\nThe Diamond Approach uses methods which its founders learned from Claudio Naranjo. Almaas' scientific background (he studied physics at Berkeley<ref name=bio />) helps explain the emphasis on rigorous (self) inquiry. Several contexts for participation are provided, including regular one-on-one sessions with a trained teacher, seminars and participation in various formats of organized ongoing groups.<ref>[https://www.diamondapproach.org/ways-to-engage Ways to Engage with The Diamond Approach]</ref>\n\n==== Presence ====\nThe practice referred to as \"presence\" is based on two methods, learning to sense one's body (especially one's arms and legs) in an ongoing manner and regularly focusing one's attention on a point in the belly called the \"kath center\" (known in Chinese philosophy as the ''[[dantian]]'' and in Japanese culture as the [[Hara_(tanden)|hara]]). These methods help a person to become more grounded in the body and in physical reality and also, in time, to develop the ability to experience oneself as the presence of Essence.\n\n==== Inquiry ====\nThe Diamond Approach centers on practice of investigation of the self, experience and perception.  \"Inquiry\" answers the question posed by [[Socrates]]: \"How does one set up as the object of one's investigation, that about which one knows nothing?\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}  One starts by wanting to find out, living a question, while recognizing preconceptions, preconditions and expectations as to the nature of what one may learn and instead attending to one's immediate or present experience. While not explicitly acknowledged as such, inquiry in effect combines (as a descriptive mechanism only, as the inquiry process is beyond mere language) the practice of [[Edmund Husserl]]'s \"transcendental phenomenological reduction, or epoch\u00e9\", with [[Sigmund Freud]]'s psychodynamic exploration. An important feature of inquiry is that a person learns to be aware of both the content of experience (emotions, thoughts, sensations) and the attitudes and reactions towards it. In this way the subject-object dichotomy is transcended and one learns to relate to oneself without having to create inner splits. Open-ended inquiry is both a path to, and the state of, a realized person and in time is understood to be a self-revelation of the mysteries of Being.\n\n=== Motivation ===\nThe main motivation for embarking on the spiritual journey in this approach is love for the Truth. \"Truth\" refers to seeing things as they really are, which ultimately comes down to recognizing Being as the true nature of everything. Love for the truth therefore combines the traditional [[bhakti]] and [[jnana]] perspectives on spirituality.<ref>https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/frequently-asked-questions-faqs#Goal_of_DA \u2013 \"Q: What is the goal of the Diamond Approach?\"</ref><ref>[http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/t/truth.htm Truth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725054112/http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/t/truth.htm |date=25 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Critiques ==\nThe fees associated with the retreats and other methodologies that are part of the structure of the school have been criticized.<ref name=\"dailyCamera\">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_12960184 |title=New path: Ridhwan teaches new way of looking at the world |date= 17 April 2009 | work=[[Daily Camera]]|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> However, the fees are relatively low compared to other spiritual schools and retreats.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  Furthermore, the founder and lead teacher, Hameed Ali, regularly points out that the Diamond Approach is only one path to truth and cannot in itself be all-encompassing.

H. Almaas''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0251\u02d0|l|m|\u0259|s}} {{respell|AHL|m\u0259ss}}) is the pen name of '''A. Hameed Ali''' (born 1944), a [[Kuwaiti American]] author and spiritual teacher who writes about and teaches an approach to spiritual development informed by modern psychology and therapy which he calls the [[Diamond Approach]]. \"''Almaas''\" is the [[Arabic]] word for \"diamond\". \n\nAlmaas is originally from [[Kuwait]]. He is the spiritual head of the Ridhwan School. He may be described, among other things, as an [[Integral theory (philosophy)|Integral theorist]], [[mystic]], [[spiritual teacher]] and an exponent of the [[perennial philosophy]].\n\nAlmaas' books were originally published by the Ridhwan School, under the Diamond Books publishing title, but are now published by [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]].\n\nThe Diamond Approach is a contemporary spiritual path integrating the teachings and practices of the ancient wisdom traditions with modern [[depth psychology]] ([[object relations theory]] in particular). The Diamond Approach is derived from the experiences of Almaas, along with Karen Johnson and Faisal Muqaddam (who split off early on to develop his own approach). They were among the first students of [[Claudio Naranjo]], an early pioneer of the integration of spiritual and therapeutic work.\n\nThe curriculum of the work draws upon the founders' backgrounds in [[Sufism]], [[Buddhism]] and the [[Fourth Way]]. Teachers of the Diamond Approach focus on the students' specific perception of their own immediate work issues.<ref>https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/frequently-asked-questions-faqs#Who_can_teach \"Q: Who can teach the Diamond Approach?\"</ref> Presentation of a canonical body of knowledge and practice is introduced over time as required.\n\n== Life ==\nA. Hameed Ali was born in [[Kuwait]] in 1944. He was a victim of [[polio]] at 18 months old and now walks with a crutch as a result.<ref>{{cite news\n | author=[[Tony Schwartz (author)|Schwartz, Tony]]\n | title = Uncovering The Essential Self\n | work = New Age Journal\n | date = May 1995\n | url =https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/uncovering-essential-self\n | accessdate = 16 April 2020\n}}</ref> At the age of 18, he moved to the United States to study at the [[University of California]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. Ali was working on his PhD in physics when he reached a turning point in his life that led him more and more into inquiring into the psychological and spiritual aspects of human nature. His interest in the truth of human nature and the true nature of reality resulted in the creation and unfoldment of the Diamond Approach.<ref name=bio>{{cite web|last=Almaas|first=A.H.|title=A. Hameed Ali|url=https://www.diamondapproach.org/public-page/founders|website=diamondapproach.org}}</ref>\n\n== Diamond Approach ==\nThe Diamond Approach is a spiritual teaching that utilizes a distinctive form of inquiry into realization, where the practice is the expression of realization. Its aim is absolute freedom that can be described as living realization, a dynamic enlightenment where transcendent truth lives personally in the world. This inquiry opens up the infinite creativity of our being, transforming our lives into a runaway realization, moving from realization to further realization.<ref>{{cite web|last=Almaas|first=A.H.|title=The Diamond Approach \u2013 Hameed Ali (A. H. Almaas)|url=http://www.ahalmaas.com/|website=ahalmaas.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Ridhwan Foundation is the nonprofit spiritual organization established to support and preserve the integrity of the Diamond Approach teaching. The Ridhwan Foundation is legally recognized as a church and the role of a teacher is equivalent to that of a minister. People are ordained as spiritual teachers of the Ridhwan Foundation, which is the name given to its ministers.\n\n=== Spiritual practice as a phenomenology of being ===\nThe Diamond Approach is described as a \"response to an important need that is being felt in many quarters, a need for a spiritually informed psychology, or conversely, for a psychologically grounded spirituality. This perspective does not separate psychological and spiritual experience, and hence sees no dichotomy between depth psychology and spiritual work... This body of knowledge is not an integration or synthesis of modern depth psychology and traditional spiritual understanding. The inclination to think in terms of integration of the two is due to the prevailing belief in the dichotomy between the fields of psychology and spirituality, a dichotomy in which the Diamond Mind understanding does not participate.\" (Almaas)<ref>Almaas, A. H. ''The Void: Inner Spaciousness and Ego Structure'', Shambhala Publications, Boston MA, 1986.</ref>\n\nThe Diamond Approach, according to its followers, can be called a Phenomenology of Being that offers a precise description of the various aspects and dimensions of Spirit or Being and is also a form of [[Spirituality|spiritual]] psychotherapy which seeks to heal the wounds of the soul by reconnecting it to Spirit.\n\n=== Principal ideas ===\n\n==== Structure of reality ====\nIn the Diamond Approach, reality is seen as consisting of three elements: God/Being/Spirit, Soul/Self and World/Cosmos.\n\n''Being'' is understood as the inner source and true nature of reality, which is the focus of the great spiritual traditions of both East and West, and is known as ''[[Dharmakaya]]'', ''[[Shunyata]]'', ''[[Brahman]]'' or ''[[Tao]]''. Being is understood as consisting of five co-emergent \"boundless dimensions\": Divine Love, Pure Presence, Nonconceptual Awareness, The Logos, and The Absolute.\n\n''Soul'' is understood to be the individual consciousness that connects the world with Being, an idea found in ancient [[Chinese philosophy]]. It is believed in the Diamond Approach that the soul can be experienced as a living presence that contains the thoughts, feelings and sensations usually called our \"self\".\n\n''World'' is understood as the outer manifestation of reality, the multitude of physical forms that all people are familiar with.\n\n==== Essence and the essential aspects ====\nWhile most spiritual paths conceive of Being as universal, the Diamond Approach also pays a great deal of attention to a more individual way of experiencing Being, called Essence. The concept of Essence is similar to the Hindu idea of ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]''. While Being is the true nature of all of reality, Essence is the portion of it that forms the true and personal nature of the soul. It is experienced as a substantial fluid Presence which can differentiate into various qualities or aspects, such as compassion, strength, will, joy, peace, love, value, humanness, personalness, identity, and space.<ref>Almaas, A. H. ''Essence'' Weiser Books, Boston MA, 1986.</ref><ref>[http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/e/essence.htm Essence & Spiritual Presence] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707032123/http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/e/essence.htm |date=7 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==== Theory of holes ====\nAs our soul develops it is faced with a double challenge: it must learn to function in the World, while also remaining connected to Spirit. For various reasons, some innate and others environmental, we slowly become alienated from our Essence through the development of fixed patterns of perception and behaviour known as the personality or ego. Each of these patterns or ego structures disconnects us from a specific Essential Aspect. In other words, it is built around the \"Hole\" of this aspect. By exploring its structure, both cognitively and experientially, one eventually confronts the Hole and by going through it the lost aspect is retrieved.<ref>Ch. 2 \u2013 \"The Theory of Holes.\" Almaas, A. H. ''Diamond Heart Book 1'', Shambhala, 2000.</ref>\n\n=== Methodology ===\nThe Diamond Approach uses methods which its founders learned from Claudio Naranjo. Almaas' scientific background (he studied physics at Berkeley<ref name=bio />) helps explain the emphasis on rigorous (self) inquiry.
