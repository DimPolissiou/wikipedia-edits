Founded in 1895, Fortuna entered the league in 1913 and was a fixture in the top flight from the early 1920s up to the creation of the [[Bundesliga]] in 1963. 2019\u201320 is their 25th season in the Bundesliga and the second in a row since getting promoted from the 2. Bundesliga in the 2017\u201318 season.\n\n==History==\n===Foundation to World War II===\nThe earliest roots of the association go back to the establishment of the gymnastics club Turnverein Flingern on 5 May 1895 in the village of [[Flingern]], today one of the eastern quarters of D\u00fcsseldorf. Two other sides figure in the club's early history: D\u00fcsseldorfer Fu\u00dfballklub Spielverein, founded in 1908, and FK Alemania 1911, which was founded in 1911 and became Fortuna 1911 the following year. In mid-1913, these two clubs merged to form D\u00fcsseldorfer Fu\u00dfball-Club Fortuna 1911 which played its debut season in the Westdeutschen Spielverband in 1913\u201314. TV Flingern joined Fortuna to create D\u00fcsseldorfer Turn- und Sportverein Fortuna on 15 November 1919.<ref name=\"Gr\u00fcne, Hardy 2001\">Gr\u00fcne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag {{ISBN|3-89784-147-9}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1920s, Fortuna won its first honours as a first tier side; it captured a district level Bezirksliga title in 1927, sent its first representative to the [[Germany national football team|Germany national team]] in 1928 ([[Ernst Albrecht (footballer)|Ernst Albrecht]]), and took a second Bezirksliga title in 1929. The team continued to perform well into the 1930s, winning its third and fourth district titles en route to a [[Western German football championship]] in 1931 and its greatest success, a [[German football championship]] in 1933 against [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]], which was on the verge of becoming the era's dominant side in Germany. Fortuna was the first team to win the title without conceding a goal in the final rounds of the tournament. It beat [[Vorw\u00e4rts-Rasensport Gleiwitz]] (9\u20130), [[Arminia Hannover]] (3\u20130), [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] (4\u20130) and finally Schalke 04 (3\u20130) en route to becoming the first national champion from the industrial [[Rhine-Ruhr]] area.\n\nIn the following season, the club began playing in [[Gauliga Niederrhein]], 1 of 16 top-flight divisions formed in the re-organization of German football under the [[Third Reich]]. D\u00fcsseldorf dominated the division through the 1930s as five-time champions between 1936 and 1940, and made losing appearances in the national championship final in 1936 (1\u20132 to [[1. FC N\u00fcrnberg]]) and the final of the Tschammerpokal, the predecessor of today's [[DFB-Pokal]], in 1937 (1\u20132 against Schalke 04). The club was [[Promotion and relegation|relegated]] in 1942 but made a prompt return to the top flight the following season. In 1944\u201345, it began play as the combined wartime side Kriegsspielgemeinschaft TSV Fortuna/SC 99 D\u00fcsseldorf with partner D\u00fcsseldorfer Sport Club 1899, but took part in only two matches as [[Nazi Germany]] fell before the advance of Allied armies.<ref>Gr\u00fcne, Hardy (1996). Vom Kronprinzen bis zur Bundesliga. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag {{ISBN|3-928562-85-1}}</ref>\n\nThe most notable players of that era were [[Paul Janes]], Germany's most capped player from 1942 to 1970 (71 caps), German team captain (1939\u20131942) and member of the Breslau Eleven that beat [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] 8\u20130 in [[Breslau]] in 1937 and went on to win 10 of 11 games played during that year; [[Stanislaus Kobierski]], who earned 26 caps and scored Germany's first ever [[FIFA World Cup]] goal; [[Ernst Albrecht (footballer)|Ernst Albrecht]]; and [[Jakob Bender]].\n\n===Post War era===\n[[File:Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf Performance Chart.png|260px|thumb|Historical chart of Fortuna league performance after WWII]]\nAfter [[World War II]], Allied occupation authorities ordered the dissolution of all sports organizations in Germany. Fortuna was re-formed in 1945 and then played most of their football in the [[Oberliga West]] (I) in the years between 1947 and the creation of the [[Bundesliga]], Germany's professional football league, in 1963. It played as a lower-to-mid-table side but did earn three appearances in the DFB-Pokal final in&nbsp;\u2013 1957, 1958 and 1962&nbsp;\u2013 but was not able to take the prize, losing each of those matches to [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], [[VfB Stuttgart]] and 1. FC N\u00fcrnberg. It was also during this era that [[Toni Turek]], goalkeeper for Germany's \"Miracle of Bern\" side at the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954 World Cup]]; [[Erich Juskowiak]] (30 caps and World Cup player in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]]); and later national team coach [[Jupp Derwall]] all represented Fortuna.\n\n===1960s and 1970s===\nFortuna's performance was not good enough to earn them a place among the original 16 teams chosen for the newly founded Bundesliga in 1963, but the club did manage to play its way into the premier division three years later for a cameo appearance in [[1966\u201367 Bundesliga|1966\u201367]]. Despite a sensational 2\u20131 away win at recently crowned [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] winners [[Borussia Dortmund]] in its Bundesliga debut, Fortuna was immediately relegated, though only to return in 1971 for a stay that lasted 16 seasons and included two third-place league finishes (in [[1972\u201373 Bundesliga|1972\u201373]] and [[1973\u201374 Bundesliga|1973\u201374]]). On 9 December 1978, Fortuna recorded a 7\u20131 victory against Bayern Munich, to date the highest away defeat for Bayern in its entire Bundesliga history. In addition, Fortuna continued its prosperous play in the DFB-Pokal, making another three appearances. After losing in its fifth appearance in the final in [[1978 DFB-Pokal Final|1978]] against local rivals [[1. FC K\u00f6ln]] (0\u20132), the club finally broke through and came away as champions in [[1979 DFB-Pokal Final|1979]], prevailing 1\u20130 against [[Hertha BSC]], then repeating as champions [[1980 DFB-Pokal Final|1980]] with 2\u20131 victory against 1. FC K\u00f6ln. During this period, the club established a record for consecutive DFB-Pokal match victories, with 18-straight between 1978 and 1981.\n\nFortuna is among a group of four teams which have made frequent appearances in the DFB-Pokal final only to come away empty-handed. Like [[1. FC Kaiserslautern]], Fortuna has just two wins against fives losses. 1. FC K\u00f6ln has four wins and six losses in the Cup final, while Schalke 04 has been frustrated most often, with five wins and seven losses. Four of the D\u00fcsseldorfer's losses were by a single goal and two of those were in extra time.\n\nThe club's best turn in European competition was in the [[1979 European Cup Winners' Cup Final]], where it finished as runners-up to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], losing 4\u20133 in extra time in an exciting finale at [[Basel]]. It was the first of four occasions that the Catalan club won the tournament.\n\nFortuna achieved its success mostly with hometown players like the famous Allofs brothers ([[Klaus Allofs]] and [[Thomas Allofs]]) or players like [[Gerd Zewe]] (440 games in the Bundesliga), [[Dieter Herzog]], [[Reiner Geye]], [[Wolfgang Seel]] and [[Rudi Bommer]] who joined the team as nearly unknown players and ended as internationals. Between 1960 and 1967, [[Peter Meyer (footballer)|Peter Meyer]] scored 119 goals in 174 games.\n\n===1980s to the new century===\n[[File:LTU arena - Warsteiner.jpg|thumb|right|Esprit arena in D\u00fcsseldorf. View from the Warsteiner Trib\u00fcne. Match: Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf vs. [[FC St. Pauli]].]]\nSince its relegation in 1987, Fortuna has bounced back and forth between leagues, spending five more seasons in the Bundesliga in 1989\u201392 and 1995\u201397 and slipping as low as [[Oberliga Nordrhein]] (IV) in 2002\u201304. In 2001, the club escaped relegation to tier IV only because two other clubs were denied licenses to play in tier III for financial reasons. Fortuna had its own money problems at the time but have since managed to arrange its finances more or less back into order. Between 2001 and 2003, the club was sponsored by German punk rock band [[Die Toten Hosen]].<ref name=\"FAZ-online article\">{{cite web|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/sport/fussball-tote-hosen-steigen-mit-million-bei-fortuna-duesseldorf-ein-124221.html|title=\"Tote Hosen\" steigen mit Million bei Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf ein|website=faz.net|accessdate=10 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Recent seasons===\nIn [[2008\u201309 3. Liga|2008\u201309]], Fortuna competed in the newly established [[3. Liga]], finishing second and gaining automatic promotion to the [[2. Bundesliga]], where it finished fourth in its comeback season, [[2009\u201310 2. Bundesliga|2009\u201310]]. In this season, Fortuna was the only side unbeaten in home-matches in the three top German (nationwide) leagues.\n\nAfter a promising 2009\u201310 season, the [[2010\u201311 2. Bundesliga|2010\u201311 season]] began poorly for Fortuna. After the first six games of the season, the club was in last place, having lost every match. During these first six matches, the club managed to score only two goals&nbsp;\u2013 one of which was an own-goal by the other side. Despite this discouraging start, Fortuna bounced back and finished the season in seventh place. [[2011\u201312 2. Bundesliga|2011\u201312]] began very differently: after the first half of the season, Fortuna was in first place in the table with a remarkable record of 12 wins, 5 draws and 0 losses. The \"Herbstmeister\" title gave the team and the fans hope that this could be the year Fortuna returned to the Bundesliga. The second half of the season was more challenging, as Fortuna was unable to maintain its pace: it suffered four losses and a number of draws, slipping to third place in the final standings. Nonetheless, this was sufficient for them to qualify for the two-game relegation playoff against the third-last place team in the Bundesliga&nbsp;\u2013 Hertha BSC. The first game of the relegation was played on 10 May 2012 in [[Berlin]], with Fortuna winning 2\u20131. Fortuna drew the deciding game which was played on 15 May in D\u00fcsseldorf. Hertha fans, however, threw firecrackers at the field and the players, and one minute before the match ended, overexcited Fortuna fans stormed the field.\n\nThe promotion to the Bundesliga represented an extraordinary personal achievement for team captain [[Andreas Lambertz]], as he became the first player in German football history to be promoted three times with the same club, from the then fourth-tier Oberliga to the Bundesliga. For striker [[Sascha R\u00f6sler]], it marked the fourth time in his career that he was promoted from the Second Division into the Bundesliga.\n\nComing with the recent promotion, the club achieved a new record in German football history, becoming the only German club that has been relegated from the Bundesliga down to a fourth-tier league (time period of downfall: 1997\u20132002) and promoted back to the Bundesliga afterwards (time period of uprising: 2004\u20132012).\n\nFortuna started the [[2012\u201313 Bundesliga]] season strongly: after five games, it was in fifth place in the table<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/spieltag/1-bundesliga/2012-13/5/0/spieltag.html|title=1. Bundesliga 2012/13, der 5. Spieltag|first=kicker online, N\u00fcrnberg|last=Germany|website=kicker online|accessdate=3 June 2017}}</ref> and concerns about relegation seemed to have been put to rest. However, Fortuna's 1\u20130 home win over [[SpVgg Greuther F\u00fcrth]] on 16 February would prove to be the club's final victory of the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/vereine/1-bundesliga/2012-13/fortuna-duesseldorf-13/vereinstermine.html|title=Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf \u2013 Alle Termine der Saison 2012/13|first=kicker online, N\u00fcrnberg|last=Germany|website=kicker online|accessdate=3 June 2017}}</ref> The season concluded with Fortuna playing in [[Hannover 96]], a match Fortuna lost 0\u20133. This defeat, combined with an [[FC Augsburg]] win over Greuther F\u00fcrth and a bizarre and unlikely victory by [[TSG 1899 Hoffenheim|1899 Hoffenheim]] over second-place Borussia Dortmund, resulted in Fortuna dropping two places.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rp-online.de/sport/fussball/fortuna/ansatz-des-gut-spielens-zu-hoch-angesiedelt-aid-1.3408379|title=Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf: 'Ansatz des gut Spielens zu hoch angesiedelt'|first=RP|last=ONLINE|website=RP ONLINE|accessdate=3 June 2017}}</ref> ''Fortuna'' finished 17th and were again relegated back to the 2. Bundesliga.\n\nFortuna's relegation was the result not only of this unlikely series of occurrences on the final day of the season, but also a poor conclusion to the year. Of its final eight matches, it did not win a single one; just one win would have secured its position for the following season's Bundesliga. This poor performance contributed to the dismissal of head coach [[Norbert Meier]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rp-online.de/politik/fortuna-duesseldorf-trennt-sich-von-trainer-meier-aid-1.3428158|title=D\u00fcsseldorf: Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf trennt sich von Trainer Meier|first=RP|last=ONLINE|website=RP ONLINE|accessdate=3 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nRelegation to the 2. Bundesliga led to a period of generally disappointing performance. Fortuna spent the years between 2013 and 2017 in the middle of the table, often battling against relegation and rarely challenging for promotion back to the Bundesliga. During these years, the club went through a series of coaching changes, with Oliver Reck, Frank Kramer, and former player Mike Buskens among others leading the club at various points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldfootball.net/teams/fortuna-duesseldorf/9/|title=Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf - Manager history|accessdate=10 September 2019}}</ref> Success however remained elusive.\n\nIn March 2016, Friedhelm Funkel \u2013 a native of Neuss \u2013 took over as coach of Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf.

Bundesliga.\n\n==Rivalries and fan culture==\nFortuna's fiercest rivalry is with 1. FC K\u00f6ln, which stems from the geographic proximity of D\u00fcsseldorf and Cologne as well as the historic rivalry between the two cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businessimmo.com/eu/research/78427/rivalry-on-the-rhine-cologne-vs-dusseldorf|title=Rivalry on the Rhine - Cologne vs Dusseldorf|website=businessimmo.com|accessdate=10 September 2019}}</ref> However, in recent seasons the clubs have rarely played in the same division making head-to-head encounters increasingly rare. The 2013\u201314 season marked the last time the two clubs met in competitive matches when both played in the Second Division. For the 2018\u201319 season, Fortuna was promoted to the 1. Bundesliga precisely as 1. FC K\u00f6ln was demoted from the Bundesliga to the Second Division, again avoiding the \u201cRheinland Derby\u201d.\n\nFortuna\u2019s other historic rivals are Rot-Weiss Essen, Bayer 04 Leverkusen, and Wuppertaler SV. During the 1970s, all four clubs played in the Bundesliga. Both Essen and Wuppertal have since dropped to lower leagues. Bayer Leverkusen, on the other hand, has emerged as a powerful force in the Bundesliga. Leverkusen\u2019s financial support from the Bayer chemical conglomerate has led to many D\u00fcsseldorf fans criticizing the club as \u201cplastic\u201d and inauthentic, without any real tradition. During the seasons when they both played in the Second Division, Fortuna\u2019s matches against MSV Duisburg and Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach were hotly contested and were often referred to as \u201cLower Rhein Derbys\u201d. Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf and Rot-Weiss Essen have played one another 59 times and many fans still regard this as a heated rivalry, but direct matches have been rare in recent years. Fortuna also has inter-city rivalries with D\u00fcsseldorf SC99 and TuRU D\u00fcsseldorf, yet these have also lost their intensity. During the post-war years, no other club within the D\u00fcsseldorf city limits has ever played in a higher division than Fortuna.\n\nBecause of the dominance of FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen in recent decades, Fortuna also has a competitive rivalry with the Bavarians. Although D\u00fcsseldorf has not mounted a serious challenge for the Bundesliga championship since the early 1970s, matches between Fortuna and FC Bayern have been fiercely contested. In a 1975 match, Bayern led at halftime 4:2, but Fortuna came back to win 6:5. On 9 December 1978, Fortuna defeated FC Bayern 7:1,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/spieltag/1-bundesliga/1978-79/16/0/spieltag.html|title=16. Spieltag - Bundesliga 1978/79|website=kicker.de|accessdate=10 September 2019}}</ref> an outcome which to this day remains FC Bayern\u2019s worst-ever away loss. During the 1985\u201386 season, Fortuna was the only team to win both of its games against the eventual champions from Munich, winning 4:0 and 3:2. \nThe band [[Die Toten Hosen]], many of whose members are enthusiastic fans of Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf, have celebrated the team's success against FC Bayern in their song \"Bayern\" which appears on their album \"Immortal\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/3530822107858599545/|title=Die Toten Hosen - Bayern Lyrics|website=songmeanings.com|accessdate=10 September 2019}}</ref>\nThe last Bundesliga game was a draw after Munich had led 3\u20131. Fortuna scored two goals, 3: 3 in 10 minutes.\n\nThe club has a particular strong affiliation with English League One side [[Ipswich Town]], with their supporters making annual visits to see them at their home ground, [[Portman Road]], since 2003. Ipswich fans have also done the same, with some coming to cheer Dusseldorf on at the Merkur Spiel-Arena.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/supporters-club-from-germany-travel-to-ipswich-to-cheer-on-the-blues-1-4849421 |title=Supporters Club from Germany Travel to Ipswich to Cheer on Blues |date=14 January 2017 |accessdate=4 April 2019 |publisher=Ipswich Star}}</ref>\n\nFortuna D\u00fcsseldorf enjoys a strong a spirited fan base, and supporters in the \"ultra\" curve of the stadium are well known for their elaborate choreographed displays<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.faszination-fankurve.de/index.php?head=Fortuna-Duesseldorf-Choreo-zur-besten-Aktion-gewaehlt&folder=sites&site=news_detail&news_id=14607|title=Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf: Choreo zur besten Aktion gew\u00e4hlt|website=faszination-fankurve.de|accessdate=10 September 2019}}</ref> and enthusiastic support for their club, which occasionally includes the lighting of \u201cBengalos\u201d or fireworks in the stands.\n\nMembers of the band [[Die Toten Hosen]], including lead singer Campino, are often present at Fortuna matches at home and on the road, and when Fortuna celebrated its recent 2. Division championship in front of thousands of fans at D\u00fcsseldorf's city hall on 14 May 2018, the band appeared with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.express.de/duesseldorf/mannschaft-rockt-mit-den-toten-hosen-so-laeuft-die-grosse-fortuna-party-am-rathaus-30189528|title=Mannschaft rockt mit den Toten Hosen - So l\u00e4uft die gro\u00dfe Fortuna-Party am Rathaus|website=express.de|accessdate=10 September 2019}}</ref> The band is also highly regarded by the club for serving as sponsors during the 2001\u201302 and 2002\u201303 seasons, when the club had been relegated to the Regional League and faced financial difficulty.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*{{Official website}}\n\n{{Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf}}\n{{2.

Founded in 1895, Fortuna entered the league in 1913 and was a fixture in the top flight from the early 1920s up to the creation of the [[Bundesliga]] in 1963. 2019\u201320 is their 25th season in the Bundesliga and the second in a row since getting promoted from the 2. Bundesliga in the 2017\u201318 season.\n\n==History==\n===Foundation to World War II===\nThe earliest roots of the association go back to the establishment of the gymnastics club Turnverein Flingern on 5 May 1895 in the village of [[Flingern]], today one of the eastern quarters of D\u00fcsseldorf. Two other sides figure in the club's early history: D\u00fcsseldorfer Fu\u00dfballklub Spielverein, founded in 1908, and FK Alemania 1911, which was founded in 1911 and became Fortuna 1911 the following year. In mid-1913, these two clubs merged to form D\u00fcsseldorfer Fu\u00dfball-Club Fortuna 1911 which played its debut season in the Westdeutschen Spielverband in 1913\u201314. TV Flingern joined Fortuna to create D\u00fcsseldorfer Turn- und Sportverein Fortuna on 15 November 1919.<ref name=\"Gr\u00fcne, Hardy 2001\">Gr\u00fcne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag {{ISBN|3-89784-147-9}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1920s, Fortuna won its first honours as a first tier side; it captured a district level Bezirksliga title in 1927, sent its first representative to the [[Germany national football team|Germany national team]] in 1928 ([[Ernst Albrecht (footballer)|Ernst Albrecht]]), and took a second Bezirksliga title in 1929. The team continued to perform well into the 1930s, winning its third and fourth district titles en route to a [[Western German football championship]] in 1931 and its greatest success, a [[German football championship]] in 1933 against [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]], which was on the verge of becoming the era's dominant side in Germany. Fortuna was the first team to win the title without conceding a goal in the final rounds of the tournament. It beat [[Vorw\u00e4rts-Rasensport Gleiwitz]] (9\u20130), [[Arminia Hannover]] (3\u20130), [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] (4\u20130) and finally Schalke 04 (3\u20130) en route to becoming the first national champion from the industrial [[Rhine-Ruhr]] area.\n\nIn the following season, the club began playing in [[Gauliga Niederrhein]], 1 of 16 top-flight divisions formed in the re-organization of German football under the [[Third Reich]]. D\u00fcsseldorf dominated the division through the 1930s as five-time champions between 1936 and 1940, and made losing appearances in the national championship final in 1936 (1\u20132 to [[1. FC N\u00fcrnberg]]) and the final of the Tschammerpokal, the predecessor of today's [[DFB-Pokal]], in 1937 (1\u20132 against Schalke 04). The club was [[Promotion and relegation|relegated]] in 1942 but made a prompt return to the top flight the following season. In 1944\u201345, it began play as the combined wartime side Kriegsspielgemeinschaft TSV Fortuna/SC 99 D\u00fcsseldorf with partner D\u00fcsseldorfer Sport Club 1899, but took part in only two matches as [[Nazi Germany]] fell before the advance of Allied armies.<ref>Gr\u00fcne, Hardy (1996). Vom Kronprinzen bis zur Bundesliga. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag {{ISBN|3-928562-85-1}}</ref>\n\nThe most notable players of that era were [[Paul Janes]], Germany's most capped player from 1942 to 1970 (71 caps), German team captain (1939\u20131942) and member of the Breslau Eleven that beat [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] 8\u20130 in [[Breslau]] in 1937 and went on to win 10 of 11 games played during that year; [[Stanislaus Kobierski]], who earned 26 caps and scored Germany's first ever [[FIFA World Cup]] goal; [[Ernst Albrecht (footballer)|Ernst Albrecht]]; and [[Jakob Bender]].\n\n===Post War era===\n[[File:Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf Performance Chart.png|260px|thumb|Historical chart of Fortuna league performance after WWII]]\nAfter [[World War II]], Allied occupation authorities ordered the dissolution of all sports organizations in Germany. Fortuna was re-formed in 1945 and then played most of their football in the [[Oberliga West]] (I) in the years between 1947 and the creation of the [[Bundesliga]], Germany's professional football league, in 1963. It played as a lower-to-mid-table side but did earn three appearances in the DFB-Pokal final in&nbsp;\u2013 1957, 1958 and 1962&nbsp;\u2013 but was not able to take the prize, losing each of those matches to [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], [[VfB Stuttgart]] and 1. FC N\u00fcrnberg. It was also during this era that [[Toni Turek]], goalkeeper for Germany's \"Miracle of Bern\" side at the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954 World Cup]]; [[Erich Juskowiak]] (30 caps and World Cup player in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]]); and later national team coach [[Jupp Derwall]] all represented Fortuna.\n\n===1960s and 1970s===\nFortuna's performance was not good enough to earn them a place among the original 16 teams chosen for the newly founded Bundesliga in 1963, but the club did manage to play its way into the premier division three years later for a cameo appearance in [[1966\u201367 Bundesliga|1966\u201367]]. Despite a sensational 2\u20131 away win at recently crowned [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] winners [[Borussia Dortmund]] in its Bundesliga debut, Fortuna was immediately relegated, though only to return in 1971 for a stay that lasted 16 seasons and included two third-place league finishes (in [[1972\u201373 Bundesliga|1972\u201373]] and [[1973\u201374 Bundesliga|1973\u201374]]). On 9 December 1978, Fortuna recorded a 7\u20131 victory against Bayern Munich, to date the highest away defeat for Bayern in its entire Bundesliga history. In addition, Fortuna continued its prosperous play in the DFB-Pokal, making another three appearances. After losing in its fifth appearance in the final in [[1978 DFB-Pokal Final|1978]] against local rivals [[1. FC K\u00f6ln]] (0\u20132), the club finally broke through and came away as champions in [[1979 DFB-Pokal Final|1979]], prevailing 1\u20130 against [[Hertha BSC]], then repeating as champions [[1980 DFB-Pokal Final|1980]] with 2\u20131 victory against 1. FC K\u00f6ln. During this period, the club established a record for consecutive DFB-Pokal match victories, with 18-straight between 1978 and 1981.\n\nFortuna is among a group of four teams which have made frequent appearances in the DFB-Pokal final only to come away empty-handed. Like [[1. FC Kaiserslautern]], Fortuna has just two wins against fives losses. 1. FC K\u00f6ln has four wins and six losses in the Cup final, while Schalke 04 has been frustrated most often, with five wins and seven losses. Four of the D\u00fcsseldorfer's losses were by a single goal and two of those were in extra time.\n\nThe club's best turn in European competition was in the [[1979 European Cup Winners' Cup Final]], where it finished as runners-up to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], losing 4\u20133 in extra time in an exciting finale at [[Basel]]. It was the first of four occasions that the Catalan club won the tournament.\n\nFortuna achieved its success mostly with hometown players like the famous Allofs brothers ([[Klaus Allofs]] and [[Thomas Allofs]]) or players like [[Gerd Zewe]] (440 games in the Bundesliga), [[Dieter Herzog]], [[Reiner Geye]], [[Wolfgang Seel]] and [[Rudi Bommer]] who joined the team as nearly unknown players and ended as internationals. Between 1960 and 1967, [[Peter Meyer (footballer)|Peter Meyer]] scored 119 goals in 174 games.\n\n===1980s to the new century===\n[[File:LTU arena - Warsteiner.jpg|thumb|right|Esprit arena in D\u00fcsseldorf. View from the Warsteiner Trib\u00fcne. Match: Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf vs. [[FC St. Pauli]].]]\nSince its relegation in 1987, Fortuna has bounced back and forth between leagues, spending five more seasons in the Bundesliga in 1989\u201392 and 1995\u201397 and slipping as low as [[Oberliga Nordrhein]] (IV) in 2002\u201304. In 2001, the club escaped relegation to tier IV only because two other clubs were denied licenses to play in tier III for financial reasons. Fortuna had its own money problems at the time but have since managed to arrange its finances more or less back into order. Between 2001 and 2003, the club was sponsored by German punk rock band [[Die Toten Hosen]].<ref name=\"FAZ-online article\">{{cite web|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/sport/fussball-tote-hosen-steigen-mit-million-bei-fortuna-duesseldorf-ein-124221.html|title=\"Tote Hosen\" steigen mit Million bei Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf ein|website=faz.net|accessdate=10 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Recent seasons===\nIn [[2008\u201309 3. Liga|2008\u201309]], Fortuna competed in the newly established [[3. Liga]], finishing second and gaining automatic promotion to the [[2. Bundesliga]], where it finished fourth in its comeback season, [[2009\u201310 2. Bundesliga|2009\u201310]]. In this season, Fortuna was the only side unbeaten in home-matches in the three top German (nationwide) leagues.\n\nAfter a promising 2009\u201310 season, the [[2010\u201311 2. Bundesliga|2010\u201311 season]] began poorly for Fortuna. After the first six games of the season, the club was in last place, having lost every match. During these first six matches, the club managed to score only two goals&nbsp;\u2013 one of which was an own-goal by the other side. Despite this discouraging start, Fortuna bounced back and finished the season in seventh place. [[2011\u201312 2. Bundesliga|2011\u201312]] began very differently: after the first half of the season, Fortuna was in first place in the table with a remarkable record of 12 wins, 5 draws and 0 losses. The \"Herbstmeister\" title gave the team and the fans hope that this could be the year Fortuna returned to the Bundesliga. The second half of the season was more challenging, as Fortuna was unable to maintain its pace: it suffered four losses and a number of draws, slipping to third place in the final standings. Nonetheless, this was sufficient for them to qualify for the two-game relegation playoff against the third-last place team in the Bundesliga&nbsp;\u2013 Hertha BSC. The first game of the relegation was played on 10 May 2012 in [[Berlin]], with Fortuna winning 2\u20131. Fortuna drew the deciding game which was played on 15 May in D\u00fcsseldorf. Hertha fans, however, threw firecrackers at the field and the players, and one minute before the match ended, overexcited Fortuna fans stormed the field.\n\nThe promotion to the Bundesliga represented an extraordinary personal achievement for team captain [[Andreas Lambertz]], as he became the first player in German football history to be promoted three times with the same club, from the then fourth-tier Oberliga to the Bundesliga. For striker [[Sascha R\u00f6sler]], it marked the fourth time in his career that he was promoted from the Second Division into the Bundesliga.\n\nComing with the recent promotion, the club achieved a new record in German football history, becoming the only German club that has been relegated from the Bundesliga down to a fourth-tier league (time period of downfall: 1997\u20132002) and promoted back to the Bundesliga afterwards (time period of uprising: 2004\u20132012).\n\nFortuna started the [[2012\u201313 Bundesliga]] season strongly: after five games, it was in fifth place in the table<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/spieltag/1-bundesliga/2012-13/5/0/spieltag.html|title=1.

Bundesliga.\n\nFortuna's relegation was the result not only of this unlikely series of occurrences on the final day of the season, but also a poor conclusion to the year. Of its final eight matches, it did not win a single one; just one win would have secured its position for the following season's Bundesliga. This poor performance contributed to the dismissal of head coach [[Norbert Meier]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rp-online.de/politik/fortuna-duesseldorf-trennt-sich-von-trainer-meier-aid-1.3428158|title=D\u00fcsseldorf: Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf trennt sich von Trainer Meier|first=RP|last=ONLINE|website=RP ONLINE|accessdate=3 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nRelegation to the 2. Bundesliga led to a period of generally disappointing performance. Fortuna spent the years between 2013 and 2017 in the middle of the table, often battling against relegation and rarely challenging for promotion back to the Bundesliga. During these years, the club went through a series of coaching changes, with Oliver Reck, Frank Kramer, and former player Mike Buskens among others leading the club at various points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldfootball.net/teams/fortuna-duesseldorf/9/|title=Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf - Manager history|accessdate=10 September 2019}}</ref> Success however remained elusive.\n\nIn March 2016, Friedhelm Funkel \u2013 a native of Neuss \u2013 took over as coach of Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf.

1\u20130 victory against [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen U23]] that meant promotion into the 2. Bundesliga.\n\n==Rivalries and fan culture==\nFortuna's fiercest rivalry is with 1. FC K\u00f6ln, which stems from the geographic proximity of D\u00fcsseldorf and Cologne as well as the historic rivalry between the two cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businessimmo.com/eu/research/78427/rivalry-on-the-rhine-cologne-vs-dusseldorf|title=Rivalry on the Rhine - Cologne vs Dusseldorf|website=businessimmo.com|accessdate=10 September 2019}}</ref> However, in recent seasons the clubs have rarely played in the same division making head-to-head encounters increasingly rare. The 2013\u201314 season marked the last time the two clubs met in competitive matches when both played in the Second Division. For the 2018\u201319 season, Fortuna was promoted to the 1. Bundesliga precisely as 1. FC K\u00f6ln was demoted from the Bundesliga to the Second Division, again avoiding the \u201cRheinland Derby\u201d.\n\nFortuna\u2019s other historic rivals are Rot-Weiss Essen, Bayer 04 Leverkusen, and Wuppertaler SV. During the 1970s, all four clubs played in the Bundesliga. Both Essen and Wuppertal have since dropped to lower leagues. Bayer Leverkusen, on the other hand, has emerged as a powerful force in the Bundesliga. Leverkusen\u2019s financial support from the Bayer chemical conglomerate has led to many D\u00fcsseldorf fans criticizing the club as \u201cplastic\u201d and inauthentic, without any real tradition. During the seasons when they both played in the Second Division, Fortuna\u2019s matches against MSV Duisburg and Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach were hotly contested and were often referred to as \u201cLower Rhein Derbys\u201d. Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf and Rot-Weiss Essen have played one another 59 times and many fans still regard this as a heated rivalry, but direct matches have been rare in recent years. Fortuna also has inter-city rivalries with D\u00fcsseldorf SC99 and TuRU D\u00fcsseldorf, yet these have also lost their intensity. During the post-war years, no other club within the D\u00fcsseldorf city limits has ever played in a higher division than Fortuna.\n\nBecause of the dominance of FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen in recent decades, Fortuna also has a competitive rivalry with the Bavarians. Although D\u00fcsseldorf has not mounted a serious challenge for the Bundesliga championship since the early 1970s, matches between Fortuna and FC Bayern have been fiercely contested. In a 1975 match, Bayern led at halftime 4:2, but Fortuna came back to win 6:5. On 9 December 1978, Fortuna defeated FC Bayern 7:1,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/spieltag/1-bundesliga/1978-79/16/0/spieltag.html|title=16. Spieltag - Bundesliga 1978/79|website=kicker.de|accessdate=10 September 2019}}</ref> an outcome which to this day remains FC Bayern\u2019s worst-ever away loss. During the 1985\u201386 season, Fortuna was the only team to win both of its games against the eventual champions from Munich, winning 4:0 and 3:2. \nThe band [[Die Toten Hosen]], many of whose members are enthusiastic fans of Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf, have celebrated the team's success against FC Bayern in their song \"Bayern\" which appears on their album \"Immortal\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/3530822107858599545/|title=Die Toten Hosen - Bayern Lyrics|website=songmeanings.com|accessdate=10 September 2019}}</ref>\nThe last Bundesliga game was a draw after Munich had led 3\u20131. Fortuna scored two goals, 3: 3 in 10 minutes.\n\nThe club has a particular strong affiliation with English League One side [[Ipswich Town]], with their supporters making annual visits to see them at their home ground, [[Portman Road]], since 2003. Ipswich fans have also done the same, with some coming to cheer Dusseldorf on at the Merkur Spiel-Arena.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/supporters-club-from-germany-travel-to-ipswich-to-cheer-on-the-blues-1-4849421 |title=Supporters Club from Germany Travel to Ipswich to Cheer on Blues |date=14 January 2017 |accessdate=4 April 2019 |publisher=Ipswich Star}}</ref>\n\nFortuna D\u00fcsseldorf enjoys a strong a spirited fan base, and supporters in the \"ultra\" curve of the stadium are well known for their elaborate choreographed displays<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.faszination-fankurve.de/index.php?head=Fortuna-Duesseldorf-Choreo-zur-besten-Aktion-gewaehlt&folder=sites&site=news_detail&news_id=14607|title=Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf: Choreo zur besten Aktion gew\u00e4hlt|website=faszination-fankurve.de|accessdate=10 September 2019}}</ref> and enthusiastic support for their club, which occasionally includes the lighting of \u201cBengalos\u201d or fireworks in the stands.\n\nMembers of the band [[Die Toten Hosen]], including lead singer Campino, are often present at Fortuna matches at home and on the road, and when Fortuna celebrated its recent 2. Division championship in front of thousands of fans at D\u00fcsseldorf's city hall on 14 May 2018, the band appeared with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.express.de/duesseldorf/mannschaft-rockt-mit-den-toten-hosen-so-laeuft-die-grosse-fortuna-party-am-rathaus-30189528|title=Mannschaft rockt mit den Toten Hosen - So l\u00e4uft die gro\u00dfe Fortuna-Party am Rathaus|website=express.de|accessdate=10 September 2019}}</ref> The band is also highly regarded by the club for serving as sponsors during the 2001\u201302 and 2002\u201303 seasons, when the club had been relegated to the Regional League and faced financial difficulty.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*{{Official website}}\n\n{{Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf}}\n{{2.

In fact, he says he was so unprepared for the start of hostility that he barely escaped arrest, losing his passport in the process, and lost touch with the party for a couple of days.<ref>Chin Peng, ''My Side of History'', pp 215-222.</ref>\n\nLi Weilun, an [[Esperanto]] professor at the [[Beijing Language and Culture University]], was born in Sungai Siput in 1936.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espero.com.cn/2013-07/19/content_29470963.htm |title=Esperanto kaj la vivo en la Pekina Lingva Universitato |last=Fiocchi |first=Pietro |date= 2013-07-19 |website=El Popola \u0108inio |publisher= |access-date= 2017-12-19 |quote=Nia samideano naski\u011dis en 1936 en Malajzio, en la urbo Sungai Sipud. }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"3\"| Ethnic groups in Sungai Siput , 2010 census\n|-\n!
